THE GENERAL PRACTICE OF PHYSIC: Containing all inward and outward parts of
the body, with all the accidents and infirmities that are incident unto them,
even from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot:Also by what means
(with the help of God) they may be remedied: very meet and profitable, not
only for all Physicians, Chirurgions, Apothecaries, and Midwiues, but for all
other estates whatsoever; the like whereof as yet in english has not been
published.

Compiled and written by the most famous and learned Doctor CHRISTOPHER
VVIRTZVNG, in the Germane tongue, and now Translated into English, in diverse
places corrected, and with many additions illustrated and augmented,

TO THE READER.
AS the true scope of all actions and endeavors ought chiefly to tend to the
glory of God, and to the good and common utility of many: so are those men
worthy of great praise and commendation, who not regarding their private gain
or glory, have labored their wits, and spent their studies, in composing,
translating, and publishing in our vulgar tongue either their own works, or
such learned writings of others, as they think most necessary for the
public weal; imitating therein the most famous Authors of ancient and
modern age: namely such as Hippocrates, Galen, Auicen, Paracelsus and others,
that have in their native tongues opened and revealed to posterity the very
depths and secrets of that excellent art of Physic: which as it is more
ancient, more necessary, more profitable, and more pleasant, than any other
art or knowledge whatsoever (except the knowledge of true felicity:) so it
may boldly be said (though not without apprehension of grief) no art more
falsified nor more abused in these days, as well by the presumptuous
intermedling of audacious and unskillful persons; as for lack of good and
wholesome writings in English for the instruction and safe direction of all
those that have not always a good and learned Physician at hand. Therefore
(gentle Reader) that you may the better avoid these and such like mischievous
inconveniences, here is presented to your view the learned work of that
worthy Physician CHRISTOPHER VVIRTZVNG, first written and published by
himself in the high Dutch or German language, wherein it has been more
often printed there, than any other Work of like nature: Afterward
translated into the low Dutch or Flemmish tongue, by CAROLVS BATTVS Doctor in
Physic, whose judgment and experience, the City of Dort in Holland does
willingly acknowledge: and now likewise Englished for the public benefit of
our country, by JAMES MOSE Doctor in Physic. What pains and labor has
been taken in the translating, it is referred to your own favorable censure,
after you shall have perused and made trial of it. Only this for the present
may with your good favor be boldly added out of the testimonies of men learned
and skillful in this faculty, that there is not published in our English
tongue the like work, wherein the whole body of Physic is so succinctly, so
absolutely, or so artificially digested and compiled. For whether you consider
the matter therein delivered, or the manner of the delivery it self, which as
it is altogether profitable, so is it easy and methodicall, descending from
the head to the foot, showing all manner of diseases incident to each part of
our body, and setting down first the causes from whence they spring, secondly
the signs and tokens whereby they are known, and thirdly the remedies and
helps whereby they may be cured and eased. There is no doubt but when you have
indifferently perused, and heedfully noted the same, you will not only
concur in judgment with others, but also accept in all kindness the work
it self, and make such favorable construction of the good endeavors of those
that have labored for your preservation, as your self would look to be
rewarded withal in the like.

Farewell.

The end of the Contents of this Book.
A very meet and necessary introduction, for the better understanding of all
such things as are handled in this present Practice of Physic.
The Contents of the Jntroduction.
THE misery of man's life caused by sin, has constrained us to think on
such means, by the which the diseases that daily are incident unto it, might
be eased: which truly by the mercy of God, and Phisickes rule, at length have
been found out. The profit and necessity whereof together, are just causes
why Physic may thoroughly be praised. And because the sicknesses are manifold,
and the body of man also divided into many and sundry parts and members, but
principally into four: the Head, the Breast, the Belly, and the external or
outward parts: Every Malady has her due remedy: also where, when, how, and
in what sort every remedy is to be gotten, gathered, and kept: likewise if any
superfluity were in it, how and what is to be separated from it, what regiment
or order is to be observed in Purging, Letting of blood, Cupping, or fastening
of Horsleaches. Then is showed the due and true use of the Air, of moving,
and quietness: of waking and sleeping, of meat and drink. At length also are
expounded the weights and measures which are used in Physic.

Of the manifold miseries and calamities of mankind. The first Chapter.
THe innumerable miseries, calamities, dangerous diseases and sores, which the
life of man is daily and hourly subject unto, has even from the beginning of
the world until this day, moved, nay rather constrained diverse learned men,
to examine and try whatsoever the earth and nature her self has yielded, by
that means to find ease for the disease and wretchedness of mankind. Some
Philosophers there be, that wholly have employed and applied themselves, to
amend and heal the infirmities of the mind, have extolled virtue, advanced
honesty, and planted reason in the heart of man: they have also set forth
vice in a most ugly shape, so to fear men from it, and to induce them to lead
an honest and virtuous life. But because all this was grounded only upon the
reason of man, and altogether without a sure foundation, it has pleased God of
his infinite mercies to supply the wants by his spirit in the holy Scripture,
and there to teach whatsoever is necessary unto a virtuous and honest life:
yet is the nature of man by sin so overtaken, by the first fall so
ouer-reached, so wrapped and rooted in iniquities, that at no time in him any
goodness either is or may be found.

Others there are, that have taken no less pains, in seeking out the means
to cure and help the innumerable maladies, accidents, sicknesses, and sores of
the body, and therefore are forced to try and approve all the creatures of
God, as Roots, Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, Stones, Woods, Metals, all living
beasts, yea every element, each by himself, to find out the hidden virtues and
properties, and to know to what use they might rightly be applied. This was the
first finding and foundation of this noble science of Physic, and has been
from time to time by diverse and sundry experience of the old Physicians
diligently observed, truly taught and written: and at the last also imparted
unto us, and shall be reserved until the end of the world.

The wretchedness of man's life.
And indeed, if we behold our own wretchedness, we shall evidently perceive,
that we in the whole course of our short life in this world, are as it were
swimming in a boisterous and bottomless sea, where wave upon wave incessantly
covers us, and is ready to swallow us up: where we are tossed too and fro,
not finding any place to rest our foot, or free our head from water: and
albeit at length (with much ado) we do from stormy seas arrive on shore; yet
there we find as many thistles and thorns, calamities and miseries about us,
which do prick and plague us on every side, until our miserable flesh at the
last return (whence it began) to the dust and worms meat. This it is, that
the Prophet Esaias acknowledges, when he says: What is man? All flesh is
grass, and all the glory thereof is as the flower of the field. Behold, the
grass withers, and the flower falls away, for the breath of the Lord
blows on them. And David says: What is man that thou art so mindful of
him, and the son of man, that thou visitest him? Man is as it were nothing:
his days pass away like a shadow. With many such like sayings in diverse
places of his Psalms. And in very truth, if we rightly weigh our estate, what
is our life (so long as we remain on earth) more then a continual anguish and
pain, labor, fear, sorrow, and alas altogether troublesome? Wretchedness of
newborn babes.
Behold our wretchedness, even from the hour of our birth: we are brought
forth not only in peril and danger of our selves, but hazarding also our
mothers life. But granting that happily we are borne, yet are we not able in
any wise, or any way to help or aid our selves, but are as it were thrust
headlong into an everlasting and terrible prison: for we are no sooner come to
the world, but presently we are fettered and bound both hand and foot: then
must we eat and drink what others command, we must sleep and awake when
others will: there lie we wrapped in our own filth, then do we abide pain in
the belly, gnawing of the worms, ach of the gums and teeth, neither can we
(which is the greatest misery of all) complain and show our pain and grief,
but lie weeping and wailing evermore. Beside all this, how long creep we upon
all four, not having use of leg or hand? how long live we, before we chat or
prate any whit at all? Thus without hand, without foot, without tongue, yea
without any joint that does his duty aright, live we (though not seeming to
live) some years together: and thus we spend infancy in misery. Afterward
coming peradventure a little further, what follows more than stripes and
blows, braulings and chidings of the parents, schoolemasters, and ouerseeers,
till at the last (if so it please God to preserve us) we, with no small sorrow,
care, and trouble of our parents, leave childhood and enter into youth? But now
alas, with much travel and pain being come to youths estate, Of youth.
we are in ten thousands of perilles both of body and soul: for now we grow
wanton and lascivious, stubborn and obstinate toward our parents, vicious and
ungodly in the sight of God, as by experience daily we find and see, and need
not any further proof. What sorrows and cares after all these, bring man's
years with them? great labor and pains taking do they again require to
maintain himself, his wife, his children and family to feed and find them
honestly and well, to supply their wants, to esteem of friends, to beware of
enemies, and to take care for the Commonwealth. If then at length peradventure
he come to any preferment, office, or governance in that place where he lives,
he is not only constrained to set behind and omit his own affairs and
business, but is hated also and envied of others, now soroweth, dow ioyeth for
his countries estate, now with one thing, now with another troubled and vexed
in mind. Furthermore, the turmoile and pains he takes, rests neither night
nor day, otherwhiles called upon for one matter, straight way for another, and
then at the last reapeth his pains for his labor, and is rewarded with
ingratitude, yea oftentimes he is endangered of goods, of honor, of life and
all. Thus with much travel, with many perils, and with great pains gains he
nothing but gray hairs and old age. Old age a sickness of it self.
And to conclude, what is old age else then a very sickness it self, feeble,
weak, full of sorrows, and an heap of cares, not regarded and esteemed of
those that should most account of it? I will not rehearse here the temptations
of satan, vexations and troubles in mind, pricking of the conscience, and many
other heavy matters, which age is subject unto, but end with this, that the
old man goes with one foot in the grave, and has nothing more surer then
death at his door. When we begin to bethink with our selves, either what
sicknesses we have had and withstood, or what we have seen in others, and what
diseases we are subject unto, what strange, how diverse, and what incurable
calamities, even from the hour of our birth, till our dying day are incident
unto us, as leprosy, falling sickness, lamenesse, blindness, deafness, etc.
Out of all which we may easily gather, and evidently see, that our short life
is nothing else but a long dying day, in yt which all miseries meet. This may
well be a just cause to admonish us to think upon another home, which is
promised and prepared for us, of that most cunning Physician and Savior of our
souls Christ Jesus, which we shall find to be without all troubles or cares,
without wants, and without end.

The second Chapter. The causes of man's miseries and wretchedness.
THe reason of man (as always if has done even from the beginning) seems to
complain greatly, The cause of man's wretchedness
that our nature should be subject unto so many infirmities, miseries and
calamities: yea it does as it were chide with God, and accuse him of tyranny,
for creating of man so wretched. And in very deed, a worldly minded man, that
neither acknowledges God, nor the cause of his natural imperfections, might
easily be brought, and carried away with such like opinions, and with great
reason bewail the infinite wretchedness of mankind, seeing he finds no
creature on the face of the whole earth, that is vexed with so many
adversities, but man only: But contrariwise, they that are endued with the
knowledge of God and godliness, will not accuse him of tyranny that is most
gentle; will not accuse him of evil, that has created and made all things
most perfect and good, nay, that never could or would do harm. Adam was
created in the beginning sound and whole, perfect wise, absolute, and without
any blemish or spot whatsoever: but by disobedience, transgressing the
commandment of God, in that he would without contradiction be made like unto
God, and know both good and evil, which he did of his own stubborn head, and
in despite and contempt of his Creator: herewith has he not only brought and
wrought unto himself, but unto all his posterity after him, an everlasting
mishappe and infelicitie, as a well worthy and deserved punishment for his and
our misdeedes together. Wherefore sin is the first and only cause of all our
distress, of all our sicknesses and heaviness here on earth: which has
brought us to that estate, that after all our turmoyling and pains taking, we
must at the last taste and take death as a merit and payment for our sins.

This if a godly man consider with himself, Christians bear their cross with
patience.
and (as Saint Paul says) sigheth for sins fake, then does he bear the
cross patiently, acknowledges it to be a fatherly warning and rebuke, uses
due and true means: First, calls to God even from the bottom of his heart,
commits both his life and his death into his hands: afterward comes unto
Physic, the which it has pleased God of his mercy to ordain for the
behoof and need of man, and has taught it his servants the physicians. Also
it is his will and pleasure, that we should use his creatures in our
necessity, and give him praise and thanks for them. And to the end the
aforesaid means might the better be used, he has mercifully lent and sent us
the Physician and physic, and has showed us a way, by which those means
might best be wrought.

And to the end, this might in our native language be better published and
showed abroad, I thought good not to bury, but to employ this little talent of
mine, which for this end and purpose I have received of God.

In which work, my purpose and intent is, to begin and divide the body of man
orderly from the crown of the head, and so descend downward from joint to
joint, til I come to the sole of the foot: and withal to show, what
infirmities every part and member is most subject unto: And lastly, how, and by
what means they may be cured.

But seeing this cannot be done without physic and physicians help; I
thought it best, first to show the just dignity and worthy praise of them
both, before we go forward with our intent and purpose.

The third Chapter. Of the necessity, profit, and praise of Physic.
The need and praise of Physic.
SEeing it has pleased almighty God, that we should, with many infirmities of
body, and with great and heavy troubles and vexations of mind, run on and
continue this our race and pilgrimage on earth; and that we might preserve this
lump of clay, fly and avoid those things that might harm it, take away the
incident infirmities, and to keep our bodies a pure habitation for God and his
holy Spirit, as it pleases him to grant us life, he has also of his infinite
mercy and goodness created (as is above showed) natural and effectual
means, revealed them, and in pity, so bountifully by the art of Physic
imparted and communicated unto man, that Jesus Sirach says in this manner:
Honor the Physician with that honor that is due unto him, because of
necessity: for the Lord has created him; for the most high comes healing,
and he shall receive gifts of the King: The knowledge of the Physician lifts
up his head, and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration: The Lord
has created medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them.
Was not the water made sweet with wood, that men might know the virtue thereof?
So he has given men knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wondrous
works. And gives thereupon a good lesson well to be noted and kept, as that
we should leave off from sin, and not fail in our sickness that we should
pray unto God that he would heal us, and afterward give place to the
Physician.

What greater praise also can we have of physic, than that only example of
Christ our Lord and Savior? what else was his whole life, whilst he was
amongst us here upon earth, but first, as it were a spiritual curing and
healing of the soul, and afterward also of the body, showing thereby that he
was the true Physician, the only healer and helper both of body and soul of
man? He made the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the
lame to go, he cleansed the lepers, stayed the bloody flixe, which all
Physicians could not do, drove the devils out of the possessed, and to
conclude, he raised the dead. Such expert and cunning Physicians after him were
his Apostles: who oftentimes have expounded this healing of the sick, to be a
shadow of our salvation, and mystery of his holy word, and a rule or pathway
for the whole life of a Christian. Is not this a sufficient praise and
commendation of this Art?

The heathen and wise men heretofore, have so esteemed of this great gift of
God, that they have not only ascribed the Art it self unto the gods, but also
have reverenced all those that were skillful in it, with such honor, as was
due unto their gods; as we may read of Apollo, Aesculapius, Chiron, Machaon,
Paeon, and also Hippocrates.

Physic is a sure pawn.
If thou regard riches: what expert Physician ever lacked wealth, (as Galen
testifies) that respects and cares for it? Most true it is, that Physic
is a most firm and sure pawn, that defends the possessor from extreme
poverty: An approved Physician may go whither he will, every where finds he
store of sick and diseased people, and if peradventure some speak not well of
him, yet others will, so that never he can want where ever he be. Neither is
there any vocation under the Sun that is less hated and envied, then the
estate of a Physician: for the greatest tyrant in the world, if he fall into an
extremity of sickness, and know a renowned Physician, whom he has ever
hated and greatly iniuried, his counsel will he seek in the time of his
infirmity, forgetting all rancor and evil will, and laying aside all the
injuries that passed between them, yea he will commit both life and death into
his hands, and afterward reward him honorably. A godly Physician also may save
the soul of an ungodly and vicious man: for although he were never so wicked,
that never had once thought on God, or his judgment to come, and falling into
a great sickness of body, very seldom seeks for God, but sends only for
the physician of the body: who coming, may very conveniently mix spiritual
physic with his corporal medicines, admonish the diseased to repentance, to
sorrow for his sins, and to lead a more righteous life hereafter: The sick
takes his counsel kindly, assuring himself that it proceeds from a good
mind, and spoken by him that seeks not only to save and prolong his life;
but also by Gods help, to cure him of his present infirmity. And indeed we
find by daily experience, that in such a case a godly Physician more
effects, than a good Divine or Preacher: It is also an even pathway for the
Physician to obtain the blessing of God, when he says: Come ye blessed,
inherit the kingdom of my Father, which has been prepared for you, even from
the beginning of the world: for I have been sick, and you have visited and
comforted me, etc.

Physic is thus defined or described: Physic is an art, which does no less
maintain health, The definition of Physic.
then cure and take away sickness.

Physic is a supplying of that which is wanting, and a diminishing of that
which abounds: If any one list to hear a longer and larger discourse of
this, let him read Galen in his book De Art medendi.

And albeit, that there have been some learned men heretofore, and peradventure
yet are, that do seem to scoff and mock at physic and Physicians: as Cato,
Pliny, and the rest: yet let them say what they list, the art of physic
shall to the end of the world well and worthily be esteemed and accounted.
Neither needs any one to be offended, for that there are many, that falsely
use and abuse the name and title of the Physician, thrusting themselves into
physic, that never learned the art, neither studied or made any one thing in
it: deceiving all men under a color of fair speeches, and flattery, with
costly apparel, with chains of gold and jewels so bedeckt, and so adorned
with every costly thing, that many are induced to wonder at them. In Egypt were
all Physicians very gallantly and well maintained, although they had but one
particular remedy for one only disease. A Physician (as Homer says) is a
man, that is to be esteemed as a great number of men: and Seneca, speaking in
the commendation of physic, says, we buy of the Physician an inestimable
treasure, namely, life and health of body: and we do daily find by experience
both in Court and country, that there is not a more ample vocation, than that
of physic: for certainly we see that every one strives to be a Physician:
and no sooner can any one either be pricked with a pin, or stung with a Be,
yea scant bitten with a flea, but every one straight ways gives his counsel,
and as it were presents himself to be Physician for the aggrieued patient.

The fourth Chapter. The division of this present work.
THe causes that have induced me to compile and make this present book, The
division of the whole work.
I have partly showed before: partly also entreated and very earnestly
requested by such persons, whom I could not, and willingly would not deny a
greater matter then this was: as that I would comprehend in writing, not only
such things as by long experience my self have approved, but also whatsoever I
had either seen, read, heard, or duly and truly observed and noted, amongst
the most expert and learned Physicians of all nations, as well the ancient as
later writers. And that I would not only write according to the common
custom: Fiat secundum artem: but as much as is possible, and as need shall
require, add also the preparation of every remedy: for in this if a little
error be once committed, a great displeasure and fault might easily ensue, the
operation of the medicine weakened, and oftentimes altogether lost and perished.

In fine, this whole work was made, to the intent, that every good householder
in the time of sickness, having neither Physician nor Apothecaries near him,
or at least none skillful in that Art, might himself know how to prepare and
use any medicine that might serve for his disease, or what he might as best and
meetest send for at the Apothecaries for his purpose. In like sort also may he
judge of the properties and virtues of compou^ded or mixed medicines, as
Electuaries, Syrupes, Pills, Powders, etc. and which of them in every disease
might rightly be applied and used. Furthermore, I have very diligently observed
and noted the just dosis, proportion, or quantity of every medicine that is at
one time to be used, and what things are to be avoided and shunned. And for
this cause, have I parted it into six treatises or parts, named and showed
diverse kinds of poisons, to the end that better heeded might be taken in
shunning them, and if by some mischance they had been taken inwardly, how to
infringe and break the force and violence of them. And albeit some things
there be noted and set down in this book, which might seem better to have
been passed over in silence, yet was it done to such an end, that the deceits
and knaueries, by which the common sort of people is oftentimes illuded, might
be disclosed and bewrayed, to teach them also to take heed hereafter of those
that would deceive them, and only to regard those things that are grounded on
reason and skill.

All such things as are noted with Latin names, are either those that have no
English name as yet known, or else that are not growing here in England, but
are commonly found at the Apothecaries.

The method we have observed in this book, is according to the customs and
orders of the ancient phisical writers, who dividing man's body into four
general parts, to wit, the Head, the Breast, the Belly, and the external or
outward parts: so also have I divided and cut this present work into four
books: The one for the head: the other for the breast: the third for the
belly: and the fourth for the outward members: as at large in the beginning of
every of them shall be showed. Unto these four first are adjoined other four
books, and not without cause: for that the method and order I have observed,
requires and asks no less, as shall be showed hereafter.

The ancient Physicians have (as is already said) for sundry and very
necessary causes, divided the body of man into four general parts. The
first part contains the head, and stretches no further than unto the neck:
the second part has the breast unto the midriffe, or to the lowermost short
ribs: the third part is the belly, with all that is in it, even unto the
hippes: the fourth part are the outward members, as Arms, Hands, Thighs,
Legs, Feet, etc. with all their particular parts and joints. This very same
method (if God of his infinite mercy give me grace) do I purpose in this my
work to follow.

And this may suffice, to let us see the wretchedness of man's nature: the
fountains and causes of all infirmities, and also the necessity, profit and
praise of physic. But before I proceed any further in describing of diseases
with their appropriate remedies, I think it were very meet and necessary to
give a more clearer instruction in some points of physic, to the end that
such as shall use this book might have the better understanding in the
preparing of medicines.

The fifth Chapter. How all manner of Roots, Barks, Herbs, Flowers, Fruits,
and such like may be gathered and kept.
The best time to gather roots.
THe best time and most convenient to dig or pluck up roots, according to some
men's judgment, is the harvest or Autumn, when the leaves do wither and fall
away. Others suppose the spring time to be most meet for the same intent, when
the herb does first begin to appear and creep forth of the ground: But
the greatest and fittest observation in the gathering of them is this, to note
the place or ground they grow in, the time when they are sappiest and fullest
of juice, and the use, as either that we must needs have them, or that we must
have them green and fresh. We must endeavor also to have them fresh new dug
out of the ground, to wash them clean, to separate the small hairs and lesser
branches from the root, to crop off the stalks and tops, to cut away that
which is rotten and worm eaten. All these roots which are woodie within, as
of Fennel, of Cichorie, of Parsley, etc. shall the hard and woodie heart be
taken out of. The biggest roots must be split asunder, and afterward dried in
the shade and in open air. And if it be moist and wet weather, they are to be
put in a warm place, where no ill smoke comes, with often turning them
vpside down. They must also be kept free from Sun, moisture, dust and
smoke, and be hanged up in such a place, where the wind and fresh air may
sometime come to them. The lesser roots, as of Sparage, Valerian, Azarabacca,
are kept longer then a year, and continue of like force and virtue. The great
and hard roots, as of Brionie, Gentian, and Aristologie, as also amongst the
lesser, both kinds of Neesewort may well be reserved three years together,
without any let or hinderance to their virtue: The rindes of the roots being
separated (as is aforesaid) from the innermost wooddie parts, shall in like
sort be dried and kept.

As concerning herbs, it is the common opinion, Herbs.
that they ought to be gathered within thirty days, as from the 15. of
August, unto the 15. of September. But seeing that some herbs do sooner come to
their full perfection and growth, other some later: (which difference for the
most part depends on the diversity of the country, or else of the ground
and place where they grow) the best time of gathering them shall be either
when they bear their flower, or when the leaf is at the biggest, and when
they smell strongest and are best colored. They must be dried in the shade,
or else in a reasonable warm place, where neither dust nor smoke can come at
them. They continue not in their full virtue and strength above one year.

All manner of Flowers shall be gathered when they are full blown and wide
open, Flowers.
while they be fresh and not withered, not when they have lost their smell.
Roses must be gathered when they begin to blow, and as yet not full blown:
None of them all may be kept above one year, except the flowers of Cammomil,
and that is by reason they be naturally dry: the sweet smelling flowers are
longest preserved and kept in boxes of Lentill wood.

Concerning Fruits, Nature it self teaches us, Fruits.
that they ought to be gathered or plucked from the tree, not bruising them, at
such a time when they are at the ripest: those that have stones in them, may
have the stones (if it so seem good) taken forth, afterward thoroughly and
well dried, or preserved and confected in honey or sugar, as is taught in the
8. part of this book.

Seeds are ripest and of most virtue, when the fruits are full ripe, Seeds.
and when herbs are at their full growth, all dust shall be sifted or fanned
from them, then bound up in paper, which longest keeps them good. Some seeds
may be kept longer in their full virtue and strength, others must be new
gathered every year, but easily it may be discerned by the taste, which of them
has lost his virtue, and which has not.

Addition.
For the gathering of simples and their parts, there be almost as many minds
and diversities of opinions, as Authors that write of them. The one will have
them gathered when they bear their flower: the other before, or when the leaf
is at the biggest, and they ready to have flowers: the third sort, when they
are but young and new come forth of the ground. Some do gather one and the
self same herb at sundry times, as when it first springs out of the
earth, when it bears his flower, and when it bears seed: adding, that the
first is for children and young folks, the second for middle aged, and the
last for old men. Other some would have the leaf, the stalk, the root, the
flower and the seed each gathered and reserved apart, affirming each part of
them to serve for sundry uses. There are yet others, that gather all manner of
herbs in their several months, beginning the month still when the Sun
enters into one of the twelve celestial signs, saying, that every herb
has most virtue when it most flourishes: some add unto this the full Moon.
But howsoever it be, this I know by experience, that not only the diversity
of the time in gathering them, in preparing and in reserving them, but also the
manifold uses of them, are just causes of sundry, nay, clean contrary
effects and operations in them. For this I have seen, that one and the self
same Simple being gathered at sundry times in one and the self same place,
shall purge and bind, which are quite contrary effects. And therefore it is no
marvel, if sometimes we miss of our expected purpose and hope, in not finding
those virtues in the Simples, that by Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides and
others, are ascribed unto them, seeing they are of diverse men gathered without
regard of time or place, prepared without care, reserved and kept they pass
not how nor how long. I remember, that as I traveled through the Dukedom of
Brownswicke, I heard of a woman that was very famous (in the town there called
Gosler) for women's diseases, but especially in staying and provoking their
menstruall fluxes: with whom when I had conferred about her art, I found that
it was one only herb, but gathered at sundry times. The reason of all these
opinions and sundry operations, because it is not our intent nor meaning here
to recite them, we will defer them till a more fit opportunity be offered.

The sixth Chapter. Of the preparation of some things for Physic, as follows.
The preparation of simples.
IT is also very necessary and convenient, to know the true preparation of
diverse and sundry things and simples, that are used in physic, and to take
away or diminish, or at the least correct that which is and might be hurtful in
them, For if this should not be done, they would oftentimes, by reason either of
their sharpness or venomous nature, do a great deal more harm than good.
Neither shall it be amiss, to show and declare the nature and properties of
the principal simples and drugs in physic.

What Aloes Hepatica is.
Aloepatica is the juice of a very sappie herb, which grows in the
countries that lie Eastward, and is in taste marvelous bitter. The best is that
which glistereth, is light, clear, like a liver, without sand or gravel
admixed, and as yet cleaving to the skin wherein it is brought. There is
another kind of Aloes, called Aloes Caballinum, which in color is very black,
and not used in Physic.

The virtues of (...).
Aloes is hot in the first, and dry in the third degree, purges gall or
choler, and waterish phlegm. It is corrected two sundry ways, as follows:

Hisp^ (...).
Take of very fine powdered and sifted Aloes, as much as thou will, put twice as
much rain water to it, stir and mix them well together, let it then rest all
a night, that the sand, stones and other filth may fall to the bottom: in the
morning after, strain of the clearest, cover it with a linen cloth, and set
it in the hot Sun, or in some other warm place till it be somewhat dried,
then make little rowles of it.

The other manner of washing Aloes is done with spices, thus: Take of Aloes (as
before) powdered and sifted six ounces, of the sweet wood called Cassia Lignea,
Spikenard of India, Asarrabacca, sweet Cane, Cubebes, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom,
Xylobalsami, Saffron, Mastick, prepared Lacca: of each one ounce and a half.
Boil all these together in a glass or pot in water, until all the virtue be
boiled out of the ingredients and gone into the water: then strain it through
a cloth: after this dissolve your Aloes in this water, stirring it continually,
and at the last strain and dry it as is aforesaid. This is called of the
Apothecaries Aloe Lota, or washed Aloes, either with or without spices: of this
may boldly without any danger be given a quarter of an ounce at once.

To make burned Allume.
How to calcine Allume.
Take of the best Alum, as much as thou will, beat it not very small, put it
into an earthen pot upon a little cole of fire, boil it till it be thick,
white and light, and stir it well in the boiling: if it were not altogether
dry, then take it out by pieces, and lay it in the hot fire, and it will be
dried incontinently.

Ammoniacum
Ammoniacum and such like gums, that cannot be beaten small, and are very
unclean, are cleansed as follows: Put strong vinegar upon them, and let them
melt together on the fire, strain and press them through a strong linen
cloth, to separate pieces of wood, straw, and whatsoever else is with it, let
it afterward boil till it be thick, power it out on a stone that is
be-oyled, and make it up as pleases thee best.

Oil of olives
Sallet Oil or Oil of Olives: it is oftentimes commanded to use old oil of
Olives: in place of which (if it be not to be had) thou shall take one part of
Oil and two parts of water, and let them boil together easily on the fire
till the Oil become as thick as honey, and so use it. Others add more water
to their oil, but that comes all to one end.

Pitch.
Pitch is sometimes used in form of powder, and is prepared on this manner:
Take one part of Pitch and twenty parts of water, let them boil together in a
great pot, til such time, as that the Pitch do no more smell as it was wont to
do, and be molten again together: then let fall one or two drops upon a cold
stone, and if (it being cold) thou can rub it to powder between thy fingers,
it is sufficiently prepared. Turpentine.
After the very same manner is also Turpentine Rosine, and such like things
prepared. Rosine.


Pearls shall be beaten very small, and searced through a lawne searce,
Pearls. Precious stones.
then moule or grind them on a mortar or marble stone with rose water, until
thou find or feel no sharpness or sandinesse between thy fingers, then let
them dry in such a place where no dust can come at them: On this manner are
all other precious stones prepared.

Lead being burned to ashes is used to many purposes, and it is thus to be
burned: Lead calcined.
Take as much Lead as thou will, put it in a little pipkin, and stop it very
close, set it in a potters furnace, there let it glow and burn whiles his pots
be a baking, then let it cool: if it be not calcined or burned enough, lute it
and set it in the furnace again, and so burn it till it be so fine as ashes.
Lead is also washed and prepared thus: Take Lead and beat it in a leaden
mortar, Lead washed.
put rain water to it, and beat them both together a good while till the
water begin to be very thick, and troubled like puddle, strain this through a
cloth very well, and let it dry in a warm place.

Take Bloudstone which now is in use at the Apothecaries, is the mine of
Quicksiluer: Bloudstone.
powder it, and searce it finely, then put it in a mortar, and power clear
fresh water on it: stir them well together, and let it settle to the bottom,
then power away the foul water on the top, and put more clean water to it,
and do as before, till it be clean washed, but much better it is to wash this
stone with plantaine water.

The preparation of Bucks blood is this: In the summer time when the sun is
in the Lion, Bucks blood.
thou shall then take a black bucke or he goat, that is some three or four
years old, keep him by himself the space of three weeks, and feed him with
nothing else but these herbs, as Smallage (which is so good for the grauel,
that of some for that cause it is called the hand of God) Parsley, Mallows,
Pimpinell, Iuie of the oak, Paul's Betony Saxifrage, Saxifrage of the wall,
and such like herbs with their roots: Item Straberie leaves, Bean husks,
the lesser branches of the vine: give him these herbs one after another: Thou
shall also give him red wine to drink, but every third day give as much fair
water as he is able to drink. Now when he has thus been fed three weeks
together, he shall at the first full moon be killed or stuck: The first blood
shall thou let pass away, and receive that which is the middlemost or second,
dry this in the sun until thou can powder it: or else if it cannot be
done at the sun, dry it in an oven, and so reserve it in some dry place,
etc.

Those that take great delight in distillations, do feed the bucke with meat
and drink, The distillation of bucke blood.
as is before said, only excepted that they give him no water at all; They
take ten pounds of this blood, and five pounds of wine vinegar that has bin
twice or thrice distilled, one pound of salt, of Radish, of Cicorie, Pimpinell,
of each of them three ounces, Valerian, Cichorie roots, Ginger, Winter
Cherries, white Amber, Sulphur viue that has bin well washed in wine,
Cinnamom, Anniseedes, Fennel seed, Commin seed, Wild Rape seed, Parsley
seed, of each two ounces: of the juice of Agramonie, Rue, Penniroyall, and of
Paul's Betonie, of each six dragmes: These things being cut somewhat small, and
well mixed together, they shall be put into a pot close luted and stopped, and
buried in horse dung for one fortnight or three weeks, then distilled in a
glass limbecke: The first water that distilleth is very clear, and so soon
as the color of the water alters, thou shall change thy recipient or
receiver: this iterate in changing of recipients as often as thou see the
color of that which distilleth to change. Others distill it all over together
into one receiver, and afterward reiterate or repeat their distillations twice
or thrice, till neither the taste nor the smell do offend them: In the first and
second distillation ascends also some oil with the water, which shall be let
alone with the liquor: and albeit the liquor do seem nothing troubled or
thick, thou shall not regard that, for it is but so much the stronger. This
liquor and oil together, if it be kept close stopped, remains good and
virtuous two or three years after the first making of it. Of this may thou
give at one time two dragmes, or half an ounce in wine or meade, against
gravel and dropsies before meat: it does also wonderfully provoke sweat.

Bolus Armenus or Bole Armenacke, is a red stone or earth that is brought from
Armenia: Bole Armenacke.
This has an especial virtue to purge melancholy: the weight of a crown at
once is sufficient, for it purges somewhat violently: but if it be washed,
thou may exhibit the weight of two crowns at one time, for then purges it
gently.

Beat as much of this Bole as thou will, power upon it Rhenish or French wine,
or fair water, stir and mix them well together, let it settle again, power
off the humiditie or water, or wine, and put on fresh and stir it again as
before: this do as long as thy water comes colored from it, which will be
some sixteen or twenty times: after this, wash it yet ten times with rose
water. Some there be that do add such things as do comfort and strengthen the
heart, which in very deed is not to be misliked.

Camfire.
Camfire will in no wise be beaten to powder, except it be rubbed and chafed in
a mortar, in the which mortar has first been beaten some piece or part of an
almon or almons, according to the quantity of Camfire which thou will prepare.

Ca^^ia.
Cassia which is in the pipe, quill, or cane, is one of the best purging
medicines, and is sufficiently known. The best pipes are chosen by weight, and
in which the kernels do not rattle, which is a sure sign that the pith or
marrow in them is succulent and moist, and nothing withered or dried. It is
used on this manner: Take as many of the pipes as pleases thee, beat upon
them softly from one end to the other until they rend or split asunder, take
out all that is in it with a knife into a hairen strainer, and lay it over a
boiling pot of water, that the hot vapor may come to it: When the Cassia is
reasonable warm, take off the hairen strayner or sieue, hold it over a dish,
and with a round pestell squise it thorough the strainer, and all the black
pith will pass thorough and hang on the outside of the strainer, which thou
shall scrape off with a knife, and keep it: then set thy sieue or strainer
over the boiling water, as is aforesaid, and afterward squise it thorough
again as at the first. This work shall thou do again so long, till no more
pith pass thorough, and nothing but kernels remain in thy strainer: this
prepared Cassia is called by the Apothecaries Cassia cribrata.

Note, that when thou will use this Cassia, it must always be new taken out of
the pipes: for being reserved out of the pipe, presently it waxes sower, and
especially in the summer time. Of this strained Cassia may thou exhibit at
one time one ounce, or one ounce and a half, in hot burning agues unto
children and women in child bed, to every of them more or less, as they are
able to bear.

Also if thou will have this Cassia to purge more effectually, then put either
the blossoms or leaves of the Peach tree in the boiling water, before thou
hold thy Cassia over the vapor of it. The virtue of Cassia is, to purify and
clear the blood, to quench thirst, and to allay heat, being taken with Endive
water; also to purge the stomach, to drive out choler and phlegm without any
danger: for it has no sharpness or corroding virtue in it. In like sort it is
very comfortable for the breast and liver, and is very good for the kidneys,
being mixed with the appropriate waters that drive out gravel, and beaten
Licorise, then ministered, it does scowre away the gravel, and hinders the
growing of the stone. It is used in a confection with Manna, and it is also
prepared for Clisters.

Coloquint.
Coloquint is a very bitter apple, and is oftentimes sown in gardens for
pleasure sake, yet it is found very seldom to be ripe. The use of that which
is brought us from Venice or other places, is this, and no otherwise. The
innumerable white kernels being cast away, the rest shall be beaten very small,
and sifted through a very fine searce, and so be brought to as fine a powder as
possible may be: when it is wet, it swells as if it had never been powdered:
and for that cause it is straightly charged to be reduced into so fine a dust:
for if never so little a piece should by chance remain in the stomach or
guts, it would easily excoriate and hurt them, so that hereby the sinews might
take some harm, yea lamenesse and crampes ensue of it. The right preparation
of it is this that follows.

Take of the aforesaid fine powdered Coloquint two ounces and a half, rub it a
great while with two ounces of oil of Roses, then take of the gum Tragacanth,
of gum Arabicke, of Bdellium, of each of them. ss. steep them in a little rose
water until they be dissolved: put of this mixture unto the beaten Coloquint,
and form little cakes of it, let them dry, beat them small again, and
fashion your cakes again with the gum water, and keep them: On this wise
prepared are they more safe than the crude Coloquint, and are called Throcisci
Alandali: To what end they be used in physic, shall be showed hereafter.

This prepared Coloquint may be exhibited from. j. to. j. ss.. ij. but it
purges vehemently, it draws the tough flegmaticall humors from the head and
other parts.

Coloquint is supposed of some to be hot and dry in the second: of others, in
the third degree.

Corrall.
Corrall both red and white is prepared in that manner as is aforesaid of the
Pearls.

Coriander seed being hurtful unto the brain, both by his hot nature and by
his strong smell, Coriander seeds.
is very profitable for many uses: ye shall correct it as follows. Steep it
the space of twelve hours in good strong wine vinegar: afterward euaporate or
dry away your vinegar from it in a warm place, then it is prepared. Black
Coriander is the seed of Nigella, Nigella seeds.
and is prepared as that above said.

Dates both sweet and sower do purge very easily, especially in hot diseases
and great drithes: Dates.
being pressed close together as they are brought unto us, they are kept good a
long time: you may minister of them from two ounces to four at once. They
need no preparing or correcting at all, for that they purge so gently, and can
do no harm.

Gems or precious stones are prepared as is aforesaid of pearls. Gems.


Horsleaches, the blood sucking water worm, Horsleaches.
shall be kept some days in fresh water before they be used: putting a little
blood and bran into the water for their food, then do they lose their venom.

Scoria ferri, the refuse of iron, shall thou cast into fair water: wash it,
Scoria ferri, Refuse of iron.
and let it settle to the bottom, power of the water from it until it remain
very clean and pure, afterward put it in an earthen pot that is well leaded
or glassed within: put as much vinegar to it as will wet it only, and not
ouerflow it: let them stand so both together the space of thirty days, in the
mean while oftentimes stirring them: afterward moule or grind them on a
marble, as thou did the pearls.

Polipodium, little fern or polipodie does willingly grow on old walls and
mossie stones, Polipodie.
but the best grows on oaks: it purges gall and slimie superfluities: it is
somewhat hurtful to the stomach, it is therefore corrected with Annise seeds,
Fennel seeds, Cloves, Cumine seeds, and is administered either with honey
water, or else with the water of grapes, and very seldom by it self alone.

Epithymus, Dodder is used in many profitable medicines: Dodder.
the gold colored and strong smelling Dodder is the best: four dragmes of it
in powder, or at the most six, drives out melancholy and choler. It is almost
never given by it self, but always admixed with other things, but specially
it is sodden in drinks or potions, at which time thou may use one ounce at
once. It is put in last of all into the boiling potion.

The juice of wild Cucumbers (called in Greek Elaterium) is pressed out of the
wild Cucumbers: the Physicians command that it should not be used till it be
two years old, Elaterium,
it may be kept ten years together, the older it is, the better: and when it
is moistened it is like unto milk: being put to the fire, it does presently
burn. It purges phlegm, water, and all superfluous humidities most violently,
and in like sort gall and choler also. It ought not to be used unadvisedly, or
without the counsel of a skillful Physician, for that an error might be
committed in a few grains.

Euphorbium, is a strange gum so called, Euphorbium.
amongst all the purging simples the strongest and hottest, very sharp and
biting on the tongue, it seems to burn in the nostrils, and provoke
neesings, it stops the breath, as if it would choke one, if the dust of it be
received. Therefore great heed is to be given: for two or three dragmes of it
is rank poison. In extreme diseases of phlegm and dropsies, when no other
remedies will help, thou may use it from four grains unto twelve, but no
more: Masticke and Spike of India do greatly diminish his hurting quality. The
ancient Physicians did minister it with meade or honey water.

Sewets and marrowes of sundry beasts are prepared as follows: Sewets.
Marrowes.
First wash them clean and often in cold water, then chop and melt them
together with a little fire in a several pot with boiling water and wine, or
else with rose water: after this press and strain them through a cloth, and
keep it in a vessel or pot of pewter in a cold place. The marrow must
especially be taken out of the bones in the beginning of winter.

Iuorie is thus prepared: take of it in quantity as you please: cut it in thin
chips, Iuorie.
put them into a new pot, and stop him close with a pot lid that is vnbaked:
put him into a potters furnace amongst other pots to be burned. When your pot
is cold, take out your Iuorie, beat it to a small dust or powder, and searce
it through a fine hairen searce: put it into a leaded or glassed pot, pouring as
much rose water on it till it be clean covered. Afterward, take for every
twelve ounces of Iuorie half an ounce of Camfere: moule or grind them on a
marble together, and when it is hard like dow, form or make little square
cakes of it called Trochises: keep them in a glass well stopped, that they
lose not their smell. Note also, that if thy pot he not very closly luted and
covered, that thy Iuory cannot be burned white, and that it loses a great
deal of his virtue. This is used against all manner of poisons.

Hermodactils.
Hermodactils, some suppose it to be our Daffodils, and indeed I do take it to
be a kind of them, but the Greeks do call their Hermodactilon, Ephemeron, and
Colchicon, of the place where it grows. And although this root may kill a
man in one day (as also our Daffodils do excitate a flux or laske in the belly
even till the very blood do follow) yet has it his use, as in other places
shall be showed. This root shall be dug up out of the earth in the beginning
of the summer, and those that are sappiest and whitest within, shall be
reserved. Those that are withered and soft, have lost their virtue: such as
grow in wet, watrish and low ground, are very venomous. And albeit that they
be very clean and dry, yet shall they not be used in half a year, and are
very seldom in request. One dragme, or one dragme and a half at the most is
sufficient at one time. Cinnamom, Ginger, Mastix, long Pepper do greatly
correct their venomous quality: they are given in the vinegar of Squils, honey
of Roses, or Oximel.

Hartshorne. (...).
Hartshorne is prepared as is aforesaid of Iuorie.

Lacca the gum or sap so called, do we not use very often, notwithstanding
that, we will not pass over her preparation, which is as follows: Take of
Hartwort, of Fenegreeke, of each one ounce: boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water, until the fourth part be consumed, and that there remain
but ten ounces: being strained, put into this liquor eight ounces of the
aforesaid Lacca, boil them together on a little fire, till the water become as
red as blood, and all the best of the gum be dissolved in the water: then
strain it through a cloth, and let your bloody liquor boil in a glass in
water, till it become thick unto a sirupe, and more thicker and harder: make it
up into little cakes, and dry them.

Agaricus.
Agaricus, a kind of well known Mushrome: the white, compacted light and
soft, is always the best: that which is hollow, full of holes and black, is
rejected. The one is taken to be the male, and the other the female kind: the
best is at the first in taste sweet, but presently afterward very bitter.
Being given by it self, one dragme or one dragme and a half, is enough at
once: but being boiled in drinks, or other decoctions, thou may use half an
ounce. It is hot in the first, and dry in the second degree. It does purge
tough phlegm, and opens all obstructions. When thou will administer it, thou
shall add a little salt Gem and Ginger to it, also Oximel and honey of Roses,
by the which his venomous quality is very much delayed. The Apothecaries do
diversely prepare this Agaricus, as follows: Take of it as much as thou will,
cut it small, mole or rub it in a mortar (for it will not be beaten to powder)
make it in form of a dow with wine, in which ginger has been steeped eight
or ten hours, and then make little cakes or Trochiscos of it. The other manner
of preparing is this: Take Malmesey or Muscadell four ounces, vinegar of
Squils three dragmes, white ginger two dragmes, Spike of India half a dragme
let them boil together with a soft fire: strain it, and steep in this liquor
three ounces of the beaten Agaricus, but not too fine powdered, and let it
stand and dry very well in a glassed pot; and when it is almost dry, make
little cakes of it with the flime of Polipodie. They purge the head and the
breast of superfluous and stinking humidities, they are called at the
Apothecaries Trocisci de Agarico.

Manna.
Manna may we call (as it is indeed) a deaw of heaven, seeing that this
precious liquor falls in the morning with the deaw from heaven. This is now
in great quantity and very good brought unto us out of Calabria, situated
beyond Italy. The best is that which is a little yellow, and somewhat
perspicuous, or clear like Masticke, in taste sweet, and without any filth
admixed. This Manna is an easy, harmless, cooling and fine purging medicine,
which may be given to women in childbed and to young children, with distilled
waters, or any broth of meat, from one ounce and a half until two ounces and
more at once; when it is moulten in the waters, on hot coals, strain it
through a cloth, that all the uncleanness might be separated. It needs no
correction, for it has no venomous or bad quality at all with it.

Mirobolani.
Mirobolani, these are strange fruits, of the which there are five sorts: of
some of them are the rindes or barks dried: of others is the whole substance
dried and brought unto us. All of them do purge and draw tough phlegm from the
head; they dry the brain, etc. But every one of them has an especial and
several virtue, which ought to be noted.

Curini, these are yellow, having a thick skin or rind with a hard stone or
stony kernel.

They purge choleric and hot humors.

Emblici do comfort and dry the brain, and are confected or preserved.

Bellirici have the same virtues with the first.

Kebuli are big, black and somewhat long, dark and of a Chestnut color: the
heauiest and thickest of rind are the best. They purge phlegm, and may also be
preserved.

Indi, of these are the barks only brought unto us, which are in color
black, for which cause they are also called Nigri: they are weighty as the
others also are: they do purge melancholy.

The powder of either of them by it self (which is not usual) may be given
the weight of one dragme or twain: they be commonly used with an admixtion of
many things: with Almonds, Currants, Fennel seeds, Spike of India, in the
whay of goats milk, and the juice of Fumitorie, they may very meetely be
administered.

Neesewoort, of this are two sorts or kinds, the white and the black,
Neesewort.
and it is concluded amongst Physicians, that the best time to gather them is
the time of harvest: they purge both upward and downward, and must therefore be
very warily used: yea if it be possible it is good to refrain from them
altogether. The whiter that one of them is, the better it is: it ought also to
be soft, unperished, and not too sharp or biting on the tongue. With this root
have ancient Physicians done great maruels, and have had many strange opinions
of it, that it should strengthen memory, sharpen the wit, and should be very
commodious against the falling sickness. They compare it to a captain, who
placing his soldiers to the battle, is himself the first that forsakes the
field. Both of them may be used, but (as is above said) with great
circumspection; for that they be venomous, as presently appears in the
digging of them up: for if the sent of them chance to ascend into the face and
nostrils of the digger, it does grievously disturb his brain, and causes
both a great pain and swelling to follow: And for this cause shall they be
dug up in have, and he that diggeth them shall stand with his back to the
wind, that the smell of them may not annoy him; and before he begin to dig he
shall eat garlic, and drink some wine. The white Neesewoort purges very
violently by vomit, and is not so hurtful for beasts as it is for man; of
neither of them may be given above a dragme at a time, and that in no wise
unprepared, that the patient be not choked with it. It is corrected by the
addition of pepper, Parsley seed, Anniseedes, Marierome, and wild Mints.

The black Neesewoort kills horses, oxen and hogs, and purges by stool. In
fine, these roots may the ancient Physicians praise as highly as they list,
yet it is forbidden that neither women nor old men, nor children, nor men of a
weak constitution, nor those that have a short breath should in any wise use
them. To what other uses they are put, shall be showed hereafter.

Opium is the juice of a strange kind of poppie dried, being too much used it
kills by sleep: Opium.
it has a strong and unpleasant smell, which may be corrected as follows:
take a little pair of tongs, which is somewhat broad before, make it red hot,
hold a little piece of Opium in it, and lay it down again presently, and so
do as much as thou will.

Rhabarbarum, Rubarbe, Rubarbe.
how far this precious root is esteemed above all other purging simples, shall
openly appear in this book. The best is that which is without, of a Chestnut
and darkish color, but commonly that which is brought unto us has the rind
taken off, and is yellow colored. That is also commended which is reasonable
heavy, in the breaking spongious, and not hard, very red, with white specks,
also that which has yellow spots, and in chewing colors like Saffron. The
preparation of it is very easy, for that it is so harmless that it may be
used without any addition, yet do Physicians commonly use to add to every
dragme of Rubarbe three or four grains of Spikenard, Squinanth, or sweet
Cane, or Masticke, and most fittest with whay of goats milk; in the winter
time with wine the weight of one dragme, or one dragme and a half being finely
powdered; but steeped, two or three dragmes, according to the state and
ability of the patient.

The saps or juices of herbs, flowers and roots, for sirupes and other
compositions, Juices.
are thus prepared: Press out your juice into an earthen pot, let it boil on
ye fire three or four bubbles; then let it settle from the fire, til all the
thickest dross be sunk to the bottom power of the clearest from the top by
inclination, which only shall be reserved and used, casting away the vnpure
setlings.

Wild Saffron, or Carthamus is very offensive for the stomach, Wild saffron
and is hot in the third degree. Of this is used the innermost part or kernel
of the seed, it purges all superfluous humidities, dropsies and phlegm. It is
given to the weight of half an ounce in barley water sodden, and well
expressed, but not without the admixtion of such things as do comfort the
stomach. It is also used to other intents, as hereafter in this book shall
appear.

Scammoni^.
Scammonie or Scammonia, is a strange juice, and used in many compositions and
purging medicines, to increase and sharpen their purging quality: the best
Scammonie is brought to us from Asia: when it is prepared, it is called
Diagridion. It is given from four grains unto twelve at the most in one day,
or at one time. The best is discerned by that, that it is black, lean, or not
gummy, shining, and with many little holes, much like unto bread; and as soon
as it is touched with the tongue, that presently becomes milkie white, not
sharp or biting, not sandy, not heavy or weighty, and very brittle. In the
second year is Scammonie in her flower and most virtue: afterward does it
decay, and waxes obsolete and old. It is thus prepared: Take two ounces of
Scammonie, powder it very finely in a mortar, put a little oil of Ireos to
it, to bring it to the consistence of dow: then make hollow a Quince, in which
thou shall put thy Scammonie, and stop the hole with a piece of a Quince very
close; wrap the Quince in dow, and let it bake in an oven. Afterward take one
ounce of yellow Myrobalans, steep them four and twenty hours in two ounces
of the juice of Quinces, setting it on warm ashes; then press them very hard
through a cloth, mingle it with the Scammony, and let it dry in a warm place.
Some men do admixe some Mastick with it; others take nothing else but the juice
of Quinces: but the former preparation is that which is commonly used.

Juice of Sloes.
The juice of Sloes is every where taken and used likewise for the strange sap
Acatia, yet it does not agree in all points with the virtues of Acatia. The
true Acatia is the sap of the tree, from which the gum Arabeck is taken.
Notwithstanding if any man would make a mixture that might have the same
virtues with Acatia, Valerius Cordus does teach it him thus: Take the kernels
of sower Dates, seed of Sumach, of each one pound: bruise them, and put upon
them three or four pints of rain water: let them steep together four and
twenty hours, then strain them through a cloth, boil that is strained till
one third remain, clarify it with the white of eggs, set it on the coals
again, and let it boil softly, till it be as thick as the juice of Sloes,
which then may boldly be used.

(...).
Brimstone is thus prepared: Melt thy Sulphur or Brimstone at the fire, then
power it into the water of Lettice: this reiterate eight or nine times: when it
is dry, beat it to powder. This is commonly used to stop the blood, as
hereafter shall be showed.

Seen leaves.
Seen leaves with the husks and their seed is a common purgation for every
man, for that it purges all bad humors, and especially choler and phlegm.
Great store of it is brought from Florence. It is also set in our gardens, but
the very best is brought from Alexandria. The husks of them are of more force
and virtue than the leaves. Two dragms of them in powder is a sufficient dose
at once: but either steeped or sod, an ounce is little enough, as in this book
shall appear. They are corrected with Ginger or salt Gem: and may be given in
the decoction of Borage Buglosse, Violets, Mastix, Cloves, and Cardimonie, or
else being powdered, may any of these be admixed with them, and so exhibited.

White Mustard seed.
White Mustard seed may in no wise be inwardly used, except it be first
corrected as follows: Steep it one day and a night in good Aqua vitae, and
then euaporate or dry it away from it: then power upon it fresh Aqua vitae,
that has been made of the best Malmesey, or of some other strong wine with
Lauander flowers in it: then let it stand and soke as before, and afterward
also euaporate: then is thy seed prepared. This seed may be made up in Sugar,
or confected and so used, or by it self but very little of it at once. It is
very good to be mingled with any stomachical powder: it dries up all
moistures of the brain, it helps the swimming in the head, falling evil,
and the dead palsy: but unprepared may it in no way be used.

(...).
Mezercon* of some Spurge, or Chamelaea, of the Apothecaries Coccognidion. The
ancient Physicians were wont to give seven or eight of the seeds of it,
wrapped up in a green fig or date; but experience does teach us, that three of
the seeds are sufficient enough to purge the body. Sops of bread may be used
in stead of the figs or days: for it is only done to the intent, that they by
reason of their extreme heat should not harm the throat. They also commanded a
good draught of water to be presently drunk after them. But fly the use of
such medicines, which are described for none other cause, than that we might
know and shun them: let Empericks and the outcasts of physic use them.

Take the filings of Steel, cast them into fair water, Steel.
rub them well between thy hands in the water, power away the unclean water
from thy Steel remaining on the bottom: this washing reiterate so often, that
the water come clear from it. Then put the Steel into a well glassed earthen
pot, power strong wine vinegar upon it, as much as will only moisten it and
not cover it: let them so stand together thirty days, but in the mean while
oftentimes stirring it; afterward beat it to powder, and mole it on a marble,
as is before said of the pearls.

Turbith is the bark of a root, and at the Apothecaries well known and very
common, Turbith.
for that it is added unto many purging confections. It is thought to be a kind
of Wolfes-bane. It is given in powder from one dragme unto two at once; but
being decocted, half an ounce every time. It purges phlegm mightily. All his
maliciousness is corrected by the addition of one third part of Ginger, and
so, either with honey of Roses, or the water of grapes, exhibited. When it is
used in powder, it must not be beaten very small.

Tutia, Tuttie is commonly used for the eyes, Tuttie.
and in all kind of infirmities where exsiccation is required, and is thus
prepared: Make it red hot in a Goldsmiths crusible or melting cruse: then
extinguish it in the urine of a male child: this reiterate the seventh time,
afterward also five times in Fennel water: then powder it as thou did the
pearls. Item glow it, as is now said, five or six times, and ever cast it
into rosewater, and powder it as above. This is the common preparation of Tutia.

Wolfes-liuer must be taken fresh out of the wolf, and be washed with good
warm wine: Wolfes liver.
cut it into little pieces, put it into a pot, and set it into a warm bakers
oven: keep it in a dry place well wrapped in wormwood, lest the worms do
spoil it.

Esula, is taken for the root only at the Apothecaries. It is a strong
purging root, Esula.
and ought not to be used unadvisedly: being prepared, not above the weight of
a dragme or less, as occasion serves. There be seven kinds of it called
Tithymalus, and are all more fit to be used outward, then inward in the body.
It purges choler and melancholy. Take either the bigger or the lesser roots
of Esula, steep them four and twenty hours in wine vinegar, and let them
dry again. When thou will use them, cut off and cast away all the hairie and
hard parts of them, and beat the rest to fine powder.

The seed of Palma Christi or Ricinus, being purified, Palma Christi seeds.
does by his purging virtue drive out choler and phlegm. The ancient
Physicians do command not above ten in number at once to be exhibited: but
because they are very greatly hurtful to the stomach, they shall in no wise
be used: but in place of them, other things which are less hurtful. There is
a false opinion amongst the common sort of this Palma Christi, to wit, that if
the seed in the gathering of it be plucked upward, it provoke vomit: if it
be plucked downward, it should move stools; but howsoever they be gathered,
by reason of their venomous and hurtful quality, they may purge both upwards
and downwards.

Laureole, Daphnoidis, and Laureola, Laurel. These leaves have a sharp
purging quality, Laurel.
to drive out phlegm and choler. Of the powder of them prepared may be taken
from four grains unto six and no more: and with other spices and simples
corrected, not above one dragme. There is nothing of it in use, but only the
leaves: it is prepared by steeping of it four and twenty hours in wine
vinegar, and then dried.

Sugar is used in many things, as hereafter in this book may appear, Sugar.
but to boil it there be diverse and sundry ways: and first of al shall be
showed, how the common and course Sugar must be severed from his filth and
dregs, and clarified for sirupes, and other necessaries in physic.

Take (for example) two pounds of common Sugar, put it into a certain
quantity of water: How to clarify Sugar.
set it on the fire until it be ready to boil or seethe: then have in a
readiness the white of five eggs, beaten to water with a little rod, and
sprinkle them with thy rod into thy boiling Sugar: let it boil afterward a
pretty while, then does the filth of the Sugar adioyne himself to the whites
of the eggs: then set it from the fire, and when it cease boiling, take away
the filth from it with a skimmer, boil it again, besprinkle it, and skim it
as before, so often, until thou find it bright and clear. For sirupes and
other confections let this Sugar boil somewhat longer, let two or three drops
of it fall on a cold stone, dip thy finger in them, and see if it do string or
glue or draw out in a thread, which is a sign of a sufficient cocture.

Manus Christi
For to make Sugar cakes or Manus Christi, the foresaid Sugar must boil yet
longer: and if thou will know if it be sufficiently boiled for this thy
purpose, take a little of it on spattens or skimmer, and throw it from thee into
the air: if it fly very white and fiery from it, then is it boiled enough:
set it from the fire, stirring it continually until it begin to be stiff or
hard, then add and mix those things with it, which thou will: then very
speedily cast it on a cold stone, whereupon a little flower has been cast or
sifted before, lest they should stick or cleave fast to the stone.

Saccharum Penidium, called Sugar pennets, is best made of the whitest sugar
that is brought from the yland of S. Thomas. Take of this (if thou can tell
how to work it) from two until five pounds at once, power upon it a good
pretty quantity of water, and if it be very unclean, clarify it as before,
continue the boiling easily until it begin to be thick, and that it rise up
in great bubbles: then have a spindle or the like little round stick being wet
with cold water, thrust it into the boiling sugar about a fingers breadth, that
some of thy sugar may cleave to it, and cool it in cold water: if then it
easily come from thy spindle or stick, if it be reasonable hard, and if in the
biting or chewing it stick and cleave not to thy teeth, then it is ready to
be wrought: Take it from the fire, let the bubbles settle themselves, power it
out upon a stone or table, that is moistened all over with the oil of Olives:
when it is run flat or abroad, take up the ends, corners, or edges of it, and
throw them upon the midst of it: this continue, until such time as it all do
remain in a heap or lump: then dippe thy hands in fine flower lest the sugar
stick to them; hang or fasten the whole lump of sugar upon a strong hook or
crooked nail fastened in a wall, and draw one part of thy sugar toward thee
about a cubits length: fasten the end in thy hand on the hook again, and pull
again; thus continue pulling and fastening, until thy Sugar become very
white. There must at the least be a couple to work it, that the one being
weary, the other may go forward with it; besides that, by reason of the great
heat of the sugar, it is not possible that one should do it well alone. Now
when it waxes white and cold, thou shall draw it out in long ropes, and lay
them on a table whereupon a little flower is sprinkled, and so make it up in
rowles. This whole work must be done in have: for otherwise the sugar will
wax too hard, which notwithstanding, it is not spoiled: But if thou will bring
it into Sugar pennets again, it will be somewhat blacker than otherwise it
would be.

This shall suffice at this present concerning the principal purging simples,
and after what sort they are best prepared and corrected: and those things that
have as yet not been spoken of, shall hereafter (as need shall require) be
showed and entreated of at large.

Addition.
Succus rosarum, the juice of Roses, or their infusion, purges choler gently,
and cools withal. It may be given from one unto two ounces very safely.

Serum lactis, whay of milk or of cheese, is a lenitiue and laxatiue medicine,
it does also purge choler. It is exhibited from three unto five ounces.

Mechoacha (in English Mechecan) is an Indian root, of some called white
Rubarbe. It may be taken in substance from two scruples unto one dragme with
broth, wormwood wine, or sweet wine, as follows: Take Mechecan one dragme,
Gentian one scruple, Cinnamom half a scruple, beat them into a fine powder,
and exhibit it three hours before meals with wormwood wine. It purges
phlegm and waterish humors without any molestation or trouble unto the
patient. It is given for the pain in the head, that has continued long; for
agues, for the collicke, for the dropsy, and for the shortness of the breath.

Opopanax is the juice of the herb Ferula. The best is white within and yellow
without, bitter, brittle, and of a strong sent. It is commonly given from one
unto two dragmes. It euacuateth the gross and tough fleagme that is inherent
in the brain, nerves, breast and joints.

Sagapenum is a certain juice or gum so called, of a dark yellow color,
white within and strong in taste. It may be given from half a dragme unto a
whole, with the water of Rue, or of Elecampane. It does in like manner purge
gross and tough humors. Both these gummes are corrected with Masticke and
Spica, etc. Taken out of Dioscorides, Mathiolus, We^ereus, and others.

The seventh Chapter.
. 1. A general rule to be observed in purging.
FOrasmuch as the especiallest point in sanation is to unburden the body of
man of abounding superfluities, A rule for purging.
and cleanse it of all corruption and uncleanness; which indeed may be done,
either by prescribing a moderate diet in meat and drink, by leading a well
ruled life, or rather if in these any thing be wanting, by purgations:
Therefore it seems needful here to set down a general rule, which every
man is to observe and keep, that purposes to purge, as thus: He must have a
great regard of the nature of the disease, of the diseased, of his age, of the
time of the year, and such like. And where (as it is already said) all
sicknesses and inward griefs do proceed of corruption of the blood and bad
humors, (as in this our work does appear,) necessity therefore does require
that such superfluities and corruptions should be expelled and banished out of
the body, which for the most part is perfected by drying or purging medicines,
whereof now shall be mentioned. The best counsel therefore is, that not
unadvisedly, but very warily thou meddle with strong medicines. For as in all
infirmities purgings are very needful and profitable, so also the use of bad
and too strong purgations is very hurtful and dangerous. Wherefore in sharp
and perilous diseases shall the advice of a learned Physician be asked, or
else in his absence to choose and use things that are easy and safe, of which
in this book every where may thou have choice.

What persons shall abstain from purging, and the impediments thereof.. 2.
ALL such as use a moderate diet, What persons are to refrain from purging
and eat nothing but that which ingendreth good blood, they have no need of
any purgation.

Those that do abound in blood, may in like sort omit purging: but good it is
for them to be let blood.

If any matter or bad humor do settle it self in the concauitie or
hollownesse of the articles or joints, and is inherent, as in the Leprie, and
such like happens, in vain it is also for them to purge; for if such humors
be moved only, and not wholly expelled, they might easily be drawn to some
noble and principal part of the body, whereby the diseased might be greatly
weakened, and fall into a worse incouenience than before.

In great heat or cold may thou not purge, for the heat divides and
spreads the matter over all the body, and weakeneth greatly: at which time if
thou purge, thou do stir and move the humor, and do overthrow the
strength of nature. In great cold is the matter tough and thick, and
altogether unapt for Physic to work upon.

It is also forbidden in weak persons, whether their weakness proceed from
nature or some other accidental cause, to purge strongly, although gentle
purgations for their ease in some sort be allowed.

Hot and dry natures must forbear purgings, for all purging medicines for
the most part are hot and dry, and by that means do they augment heat and
drought, and hurt the body.

Very nice and dainty persons shall not take any strong purgation, for in them
are the humors easily moved.

In like sort might fat bodies, which commonly are but weak, by strong
purgations incur the danger of stifling.

Young children and old men shall shun purgations: and those also that labor
much, and carry great burdens: for they are always weary, which is contrary to
all purgations.

What is to be observed in and after the taking of a purgation.. 3.
(...), and after purguing.
AFter the taking of a purge, is a moderate motion up and down, and stirring of
the arms commodious, that the matter fall and remain not all upon an heap in
the body. But if thou fear that thou shall cast up the purgation, thou shall
be at rest and quiet till thy stomach be stayed.

If the purgation that thou have taken be gentle, and a little potion or
drink, thou shall forbear to sleep after it: but upon hard or solid
medicines, as pills, tabulats, and such like, is sleep and rest granted, that
by the inward and natural heat the substance of the pills might the sooner
be dissolved and dispersed.

The purgation being taken, it is not amiss to use some sower thing after it,
as a Pomegranate, unripe Grapes, Oranges, etc. for that strengthens the
stomach, that it draws no ill humor to it, and it stays all the vomiting.
It is also good after the taking of any purgation to drink a draught of whay
or warm beer; it helps the operation of the medicine, and dulleth her
sharpness. It is also good to keep the belly warm, least by force he draw
away the medicine from the stomach. To this end is nothing more commodious than
warm water to set thy feet in, for that warmeth all the body. The belly may
also be covered with a little bag, and some bran in it.

When the medicine begins to purge, it is not much amiss to move the body
somewhat: for by that motion descends it downwards, and all the harm or
badnesse which the medicine has with it, is thereby taken away: the motion
helps also to expel the humors.

Whilst the medicine does yet purge, thou shall neither eat nor drink, least
it hinder the operation thereof. Notwithstanding if the patient cannot forbear
so long, let him use the broth of a hen, or some such like thing, or else the
sirupe of Violets, to delay the heat of the stomach, and to preserve him from
an ague. For a great quantity of choler being drawn into the stomach by
reason of hunger, might easily cause such an accident as might be very hurtful
for the diseased. Secondly, if a great hunger should overtake him, he may
boldly take a piece of a toast and dip it in good wine, or any such like
liquor, but not so much in quantity, that the medicine might be hindered of her
operation.

Sleep after the operation of the purge is permitted: for as the purge does
weaken and distemper the body, so does rest and sleep strengthen it again.

After thy sleep thou shall make but a small and easy meal: for considering
that the natural powers and virtues of the body be somewhat weakened, they might
by too much and too hasty eating be quite overthrown: so that this is a
general rule; The more the medicine has purged, the less ought to be eaten
after it.

The next day after purging, is good to bathe in warm water, if at the least
the feeble estate of the patient do not dissuade from it: for thereby are the
relikes that are left after purging moistened and digested, and it suppleth
also the dry body.

On the third day shall a vein be opened, by the which the vapors (of the
humors that were moved and expelled) are taken away, which otherwise would be
no small hurt unto the body. This shall suffice as concerning the rules and
ordinances that ought to be observed in purging.

The eight Chapter.
. 1. Of Phlebotomie in general.
Phlebotomie
THe health of man is no less maintained, and being in decay restored by right
use of Phlebotomie, than by purging; and therefore ought it not at this present
time to be passed over in silence. As concerning every particular disease and
causes of it, shall hereafter particularly be mention made. First, one that is
in in good health needs neither boxing nor cupping, nor the letting of blood.
Also the Phlebotomie is fruitless to such as have so strong a nature, that
(being ouerladen) is able to expel all superfluities through natural
passages, as by bleeding at the nose, by the piles or hemorhoides, by the
flowers in women, and such like: to such is nothing else to be done, but to
aid nature in opening of those passages that she has chosen to ease her
self by. But now might some man ask this question; Why, or for what cause is
Phlebotomie used? Whereunto may thus be answered: When the aboue-named natural
euacuations have not their course, then are there four reasons why this
letting of blood might be used. First, when blood abounds, as commonly in
those that have a hot liver, full veins, a high color and brownish, and are
not too fat and corpulent: also in those that eat and drink abundantly, live
at ease, and that use meats that engender much blood; which when nature cannot
altogether digest, does smother, rot and corrupt in the veins; from which
dangerous and deadly diseases do ensue. Wherefore if phlebotomie be in due
season adhibited, it has these commodities with it: First, that the whole
body, or the part affected, may more surely by this means then by
administration of inward Physic be eased. For in the letting of blood, being
ruled by art, thou may draw as little as thou will, and as much as seems
needful; which in purging can in no wise be done: for that which is taken into
the body, that remains there, whether it be too much or too little, whether
it do good or evil. Furthermore, Phlebotomie does strengthen the brain,
comfort the sight, warmeth the cold marrow in the bones, freeth the inward
parts of many infirmities, stays vomiting, helps also oftentimes the flixe
or laxe, clears the senses, restores sleep, reuiueth the spirits, because
melancholy blood is by it diminished, cures deafness, reduces the lost
voice, augmenteth the powers and virtues of all the body, by reason that it is
by this means rid of superfluities. In the same sort also is anger delayed by
it, because that choler or gall is by Phlebotomie also diminished. The
abundance of blood is known no less by the thickness and troubled
consistence of urine, than by the signs before mentioned.

Secondly, although the blood be not inflamed, but only superabounding, yet
does it cause grievous agues and other perilous diseases: wherefore,
whenever we find an inflammation and an abundance of blood, presently we
open a vein. Also if any one every morning about the dawning of the day does
use commonly to sweat, it is a sign of a superfluity in the veins.

Thirdly, where bad and cold blood is, there must a purgation preceede
phlebotomie; otherwise the good blood will be drawn forth, and the thick,
tough and cold blood remain in the veins.

Lastly, it is profitable at sometimes to be let blood, not for any of the
aforesaid causes, but only that the blood might be led or drawn from the one
vein into the other. For example, If a woman do ouerpasse the time wherein she
should have her flowers, then do we open the vein Saphea in the foot, thereby
intending to draw the blood downwards. Others comprehend all these particulars
in these two points, namely, such ought to be phlebotomized that abound in
blood and for that cause are very subject unto sickness. Secondly, that are
full of bad humors, or that do abound in a corrupted mass of blood, and are
diseased: of all which points, and how every vein shall be opened, we will
more at large speak hereafter, where we shall treat of every sickness in
particular.

Of the causes that prohibit or forbid phlebotomie.. 2.
WE have before showed what persons ought to be phlebotomized: Causes that
hinder phlebotomie.
also what profit this letting of blood causes. Now we will declare what
persons must for bear it, and what might hinder it. First, Galen commands
that no body before the foureteenth year of his age should be let blood: but
his successors the latter Physicians, will that no man should have a vein
opened before the seventeenth year: also those that are above threescore and
ten years old should in no case meddle with it: adding, that youth being hot
and moist, does consume much, and therefore needs much blood for the
sustenance of life. In like sort also have old men small store of good blood,
but rather great store of bad humors; where the letting of blood might take
away the best blood and leave the worst behind: Beside this, they are weak,
and their strength does daily decay. But those that are of a middle age from
thirty to fifty, may most safely use phlebotomie: for that they neither
incline to the one, nor to the other.

To those that are cold of complexion is phlebotomie forbidden, as also to such
as dwell in cold countries: for their blood lies deep in their bodies, is
chicke, and unapt to be educed. Also where there is a great pain shall it be
omitted, except it were in a hot ague: and there shall so much be drawn that
the patient do swoune, to the intent the whole body thereby might be cooled,
and the heat taken away.

Also it is not good presently after a bath to be let blood, nor after the use
of Venery, nor after any long lasting sickness, unless the patient do abound
in unclean blood: neither must any one that has ouerladen his stomach with
meat or drink, and as yet is undigested, use phlebotomy. They that are
constrained to much vomiting of choler in the stomach, must also forbear it,
otherwise it will greatly weaken them.

Lastly, no man shall after much bleeding at the nose, or much bleeding of the
hemorrhoides or piles, or after great store of the flowers in women, be
phlebotomized; for it will cast him down and weaken him, because the blood is
the treasure of life.

At what time and in what sign a vein ought to be opened.. 3.
FOr the preservation of health, it is best to be let blood in April or in
May, When phlebotomie ought to be used.
because at that time man does most abound in blood, and it shall be done on
the right side, either in the hand, arm, or foot: for in these months and in
Summer also increases choler, which proceeds from the liver and gall, that
both lie on the right side.

In harvest grows melancholy blood, and then must the vein of the spleen be
opened on the left side, and in winter also.

In like sort it is ordained to be let blood for diseases of the heart in the
spring, of the liver in summer, of the feet in harvest, and of the head in
winter. And to the end it might more clearly appear at what special times
phlebotomie may be used, it shall now be showed from month to month, which
times are most convenient, and which are not.

In January shall thou by no means be let blood, except necessity constrain
thee, January.
and that in diseases of the head.

In February, if necessity require, may thou use it. February.


In March it is altogether forbidden. March.


In April it is always convenient to open a vein, but not the median. April.


In May it is very good and convenient, but not in legs nor feet. May.


In June (if need require) thou may sometimes phlebotomize. June.


In July it is hurtful, by reason of the heat. July.


In August likewise, unless it be toward the latter end of the month. August.


In September it is as convenient as it was in April or May. September.


October No^ember.
In October and November may thou also phlebotomize.

December.
In December is phlebotomie prohibited, partly by reason of the extreme cold,
partly also because at such time there is small store of blood in the body of
man.

There is a great abuse among the common people committed, to look for the
sign in the Almanacke, and so where the Moon rests. They make also great
difference between the height and lowness, drith and moistness of the
signs: also whether the Moon be new or full, increasing or decreasing, and
diverse things more, which of some very superstitiously are observed.
Furthermore, if the Moon be in Aries, then it is forbidden to let blood in the
head vein and under the tongue. And if the Moon be in Taurus, it is thought
unmeet to open any veins in the neck, or to box or cup about the neck or
shoulders. When the Moon is in Gemini, which rule the arms, and is supposed
to be a hot and moist sign, the places governed are not to be touched. Cancer
is cold and moist, where if the Moon be, neither the hand nor the left arm
ought to be touched. Because Leo is hot and dry, no phlebotomie is permitted
concerning the heart. Virgo is thought to be a very bad sign, and to be cold
and dry, and to rule the guts: at which time ought neither phlebotomie nor
any purgation to be used, but all kind of Physic to be abandoned.

But I take it to be a great deal more meet that every Physician examine well
the estate and manner of the diseased patient, and to judge wisely thereof: and
first to feel the pulses, and seek out the infallible signs of the
infirmity, before he run up to heaven to see the celestial signs: for in
sharp and very hot diseases there is no leisure to expect a good sign
celestial, but immediately to open a vein, and that so often reiterated as
need shall require. But in such like infirmity must be the counsel of an
expert Physician be always used: for if phlebotomy in the like extremities be
not in time adhibited, life it self might oftentimes be endangered.

An admonition to those that let others blood.. 4.
ALl those that let others blood, must take great heed they enter not too deep
with their launcet, for fear of pricking an artery or sinew, because they are
placed very near, underneath, and about the veins. And if a sinew be wounded
or hurt, great danger is like to ensue, as Spasmus, great tumors and swellings,
or other more grievous accidents, and at the last a terrible and hard death or
at the least a resolution or lamenesse of the whole member so grieved; for a
wounded sinew is counted incurable, as at another time and place at large shall
be showed. Also if an Artery be touched, then either gusheth forth that
excellent blood of the heart, in which the soul of man rests; or else
Sinouia, which very hardly will be stinted, because rest and quietness in all
consolidations and healings are required, where indeed all arteries are in
continual motion. But to stay the running of the Sinouia, thou shall have very
good and expert remedies in the fifth part of this book. Notwithstanding it is
sometime permitted to open an artery, but only when the greatest need requires
that may be, because (as is already said) it can by no means be done without
great danger. But because there is no such peril in the opening of some veins
as is in others, let this instruction that follows he diligently observed.

Head vein ^ate Median somewhat dangerous. Liver vein dangerous. The spleen
vein.
The Cephalicall or head vein is without danger, for that there is neither
artery nor sinew near it.

The Median is somewhat perilous, for there lies a sinew just under it, which
is to be regarded.

Basilica or liver vein is not without danger, for under it is placed both an
artery and a sinew.

The Spleen vein has no other danger, but that it is small and hard to be
pricked: and therefore shall the hand first be laid in warm water. But
whatsoever is more to be said of these and the like other veins, shall
immediately hereafter be declared.

Incision great or small.
In this point all Physicians do agree, that wheresoever is great store and very
thick and gross blood, there must the incision be made the larger, that the
vapors and bad blood might the better issue forth: for if it be not large
enough, then comes forth the thin and subtle blood, and that which is
gross and bad remains behind. But if the patients be very weak, then of
necessity must the issue be made the less, that their little strength be not
overthrown, and their vital spirits let out.

What is to be done before, in, and after the letting of blood.. 5.
Whenever thou do purpose to be let blood, use some four days before
meats that are subtle, light and easy of digesture, especially if thy blood
be gross, thick and heavy, that thereby it be made thinner, more flued and
subtle, and so much the easier issue forth: neither is it amiss to bathe thy
self two or three days before, but not on the day appointed for letting of
blood. It is also good in the precedent days to use the sirupes of vinegar.

Note also, that thou be not phlebotomised presently after awaking out of thy
sleep, but rather two or three hours after it, and when thou have walked
before. All the learned Physicians also do counsel (although it be against the
common custom) not to open any vein, the patient being fasting, or not having
eaten a new laid egg, and drunk a good draught of wine upon it; then to be
let blood, and three hours after to break his fast again: the cause whereof
is, that when the stomach has taken a little food, nature is most strong.

The member likewise which is to be phlebotomised, ought first to be somewhat
chafed and rubbed with warm clothes, that the humors thereby might be drawn
thither. It is also not amiss to bind the member with a band: for that in like
sort draws the humors into the veins.

It befalls often in phlebotomie, that the blood by no means can be stenched
or stopped: for the which thou shall find in the fifth book diverse approved
remedies; but for the same is the powder of calcined or burned Vitrioll very
highly commended, being cast upon it.

If the patient chance to faint in the letting of blood, let him drink a cup
of good wine, for that reuiueth the vital spirits, strengthens the heart, and
refreshes the blood. Use also for the same those things that do comfort the
heart, which thou shall find in the second book.

If the opened vein should swell and puff up, then boil Rue in the oil of
Olives, and apply it to the vein. This also is very good to be used after
cupping, if the place should begin to rankle.

After the letting of blood the patient shall forbear sleep at the least six
hours, and not eat in the time above specified, that the homors now stirred
and troubled in the body might be settled again in the mean while. Afterward
let him use light meats, abstain from milk or any thing that is made
thereof, and then at the last commit himself to sleep. Lastly, he is not to
use any thing either inwardly or outwardly, but that might warm and comfort
the body, and to follow that most learned man Ioachimus Camerarius, who
excellently and briefly observed these rules after the letting of blood.

Prima coena die sit misso sanguine parca:
Lux abeat laetis aucta secunda modis.
Tertia sed placidae debetur tota quieti:
Quarta and quinta sibi mollius esse volunt.
Balnea sexta petit: mox septima colligit auras,
Fertque vagos circum rura nemusque pedes.
Octaua amplexus dilectae coniugis: and quae
Ante fuit, vitam restituisse solet:
That is, The first day not much meat be spent:
The second day to mirth be bent:
The third day use thy rest and ease:
The fourth and fifth eat what thou please:
The sixth day bathe in any case:
The seventh walk from place to place:
The eight may thou lie with thy wife,
and after live thy wonted life.


What veins ought in every disease to be opened.. 6.
SEeing that the body of man is every where full of veins, here shall now be
showed which of them ought to be opened for the ease of any one member, or for
cure and help of any disease whatsoever. First therefore shall be noted, that
phlebotomie may be used in diverse parts of the body, partly as the disease
requires, partly also according as the veins are apparent. Amongst others,
there are six from the armepit downward to the elbow, with those on the hand,
that may be opened. The first is called Cephalica, the head vein: the second
Basilica, in Latin Hepatica, the liver vein: the third Mediana, Cordiaca,
Corporalis, Nigra, Matrix and Communis, that is, the median, heart, corpulent,
black, mother and common vein. The fourth Axillaris, the vein of the
armepit, because in the armepit it most plainly appears. The fifth on the
beginning of the hand, which now is no longer phlebotomised. The sixth is also
on the outside of the hand, between the little and the fourth finger, which of
the Physicians is called Sceiles, Splenetica, Saluatella, that is, the spleen
vein.

The lower parts of the body (as the legs and feet) have three special veins:
the one Ischiadica, the hip vein: the other is Saphea or Saphena, the womb
vein: the third Poplitis, the knee vein, which is the just middle vein. They
are the special veins that commonly are opened: of which and others more, we
will hereafter speak at large.

Of the head vein Cephalica.. 7.
THis vein is also called Humeralis the shoulder vein, because it eases all
the veins that are above and beneath the neck, whenever it is opened. This
vein being opened, it does much help the headache called Hemicran^a,
madness, and such like, that proceed of an extraordinary heat. It begins to
appear about the armpits, and passes along by the left arm.

To the end then that the Reader might more clearly understand and know, in
what infirmities this vein may conveniently be opened, I will briefly rehearse
out of other places of this our book, and show when it is usually opened: As
for example; in headaches with agues, heat and flures: in tumors of the
armepits: in the pains, inflammations and apostumations, with other
impediments of the eyes: in frensies or madness, in the night mare or hag: in all accidents of the mouth and throat: in all rheumes, in hot agues with an
infection of the lungs. Here may thou perceive and see manifestly, that this
may justly be called the head vein.

Of the liver vein Basilica.. 8.
AMongst all others is this liver vein Basilica the principallest, whose name
is sufficiently known both in Greek and English. This being opened,
vnburdeneth all the parts below the neck, as breast, liver, etc. of their
superfluous blood; so that if any of these be any kind of way diseased, it may
by that means be recovered again: it takes her beginning of the armepit
vein or Axillaris, and goes down to the elbow. The diseases in the which it
is usually phlebotomised, are these: In tumors of the eyes, in unmeasurable
bleeding at the nose, in wheesing or ringing of the ears, in extreme
melancholy, in rheumes with heat and agues, and in all infirmities of the
lungs, in broken veins or varices of the breast, in the panting or beating of
the heart, in great faintness, in ruptures, in bleeding of the hemorrhoides,
in barrenness of women that proceeds of heat, in an obdurated and hardened
liver, in melancholy, in hot swellings of the stomach, in obstructions of the
urine, in impostumes of the womb, in the pain of the hips, in the gout, in
wrenchings of the joints, in broken veins, in great inflammations, in the
pox, and in the measles.

Of the Median or middle vein.. 9.
THis is for the most part of all our Physicians and Chirurgians called by the
Latin name Mediana: because it lies between the abouesaid veins, and takes
his beginning also from them both. This being opened in all infirmities does
most good, for that it eases both the upper and the lower parts of the body;
for which cause it is called Vniuersalis, the common vein, and not as some
suppose, because it comes from the heart. Here is to be observed, that if the
head vein or Cephalica should be opened, and it no where appears; in stead
of it the Median shall rather be used than the Liver vein: likewise if the
Liver vein be not seen, open rather the Median than the head vein. As for
example, this vein is conveniently opened in swollen eyes, bleeding at the
nose, outrageous melancholy, hot rheumes, panting of the heart, ruptures, to
procure children in women of hot complexions, bleeding of the hemorrhoides or
piles, and to procure the flowers in women, etc. by which every skillful man
may guide himself.

Of the armepit vein Axillaris.. 10.
THe fourth vein is called (as is aforesaid) Axillaris: it is a branch of the
great liver vein, called Vena caua, the hollow vein, which comes from
thence into the arms, and shows it self in the bending of the arm. It has
great correspondence with the head vein, as is already sufficiently showed.
After the same sort it is with the fifth, which is on the end of the arm: so
that all that has bin said before, and which shall be said hereafter of the
Spleen vein, the very same may be said of these two.

Of the Spleen vein or Saluatella.. 11.
THe sixth principal vein lies between the little and fourth fingers, on the
outside of both hands. It is oftentimes opened, because it cleanses the
spleen, liver and breast, cleereth the voice, preserves the internal parts,
but especially the stomach and mouth from all accidents whatsoever; eases the
pain of the heart, and takes away all the superfluous blood of the before
named inward parts. The later Physicians make this distinction: they call this
vein on the left hand Splenetica, the spleen vein; and on the right hand
Saluatella: for this cause have diverse opened that on the left side, letting it
bleed till of it self it stanched, supposing thereby to heal all infirmities
of the spleen. It is also opened in blood spittings, in obstructions of the
spleen, and in the French pox. That on the right hand in infirmities of the
liver, in shaking palsies, in contractures of the mouth, in all manner of
stitches, in the gout, in the pockes, and in fine, almost in all other diseases.

Of the hip vein.. 12.
AFter the description of the veins that are in the arms and hands, it
follows now to treat of the three principal veins apparent in the legs and
feet. The first and uppermost of them is called in Greek Ischiadica, and in
English the hip vein. It is commonly opened upon the left foot, thereby to
draw the blood downwards, and to ease all the maladies of the same side, of
the kidneyes, of the womb, and such like: also to make the piles bleed, to
help the pain of the hip, to cease the raging of the gout, if it be opened
hard by the little toe, although it specially appear upon the ankle on the
outside of the leg.

Of the womb vein or Saphena.. 13.
THis comes from the great liver or hollow vein, and descends from the
foreside of the leg down to the inward ankle, where it very manifestly
appears: for the which cause it is also called Manifesta, the apparent or
manifest vein, otherwise Saphea, and not Saphena. This is especially opened to
draw the blood downwards from the privy parts of man, from the womb in
women, in sore eyes, in madness, in the palsy, in the night mare, falling
evil, blood spittings, women's flowers, and barrenness of them, in the
suffocation of the matrix, or the rising up of the womb or mother, in the
gout, and in the plague.

Of the hamme or knee vein.. 14.
THis also is a median or middle vein, which descends downwards through the
calfe of the leg into the foot, as the median of the arm does into the hand:
and it is more meet to be opened to the aforesaid infirmities, than either the
hip or womb vein, because it is nearer adjacent to the womb with her annexed
parts than either of them, and therefore draws with more force.

Of the vein in the forehead.. 15.
IN the midst of the forehead is also a very apparent vein, which usually
was opened in all pains of the hinder part of the head and neck, although it
have continued very long; also in all pains of the eyes, but first of all
ought the head vein to be opened. It is also used in the frenzy, night mare,
and palsy.

Of the veins of the eyes.. 16.
THese little veins appear in the corners of the eyes, hard by the nose
upwards toward the forehead. They are commonly opened in inflammations of the
eyes: but first of all open the vein of the head.

Of the vein in the temples of the head.. 17.
IN the temples of the head are veins, which some men do counsel to be opened
in the pain of the eyes, if the same proceed of hot humors or windiness, as
is before said. But it is not without great danger, because there is an artery
hard by it, which easily may be felt. The same may be said of the veins behind
the ears, which also are very commodiously opened in great pains of the head,
as Hemicrania, in a continual pain and swimming in the head. But Auicenna
supposes, that such as use it thereby are made barren or unfruitful.

Of the vein upon the nose.. 18.
IN like manner also is there a vein upon the nose close by the forehead,
which may be opened: but first must a towell or napkin be tied hard about the
neck and throat, that the vein may swell or puff up, and be the better seen.

Of the veins in the lips.. 19.
THese are opened in all putrifactions and rottings of the gums, and many other
infections of the mouth, but not before the head vein.

Of the veins of the almonds or kernels in the throat.. 20.
THere be four of these veins apparent, the which being opened, help very
greatly in all rheumes and defluxions, as also in the toothache, but it is not
good to open them but when the rheum begins to fall.

Of the veins under the tongue.. 21.
Under the tongue are also some veins, which in dangerous diseases may well be
opened, and especially in the squinancy, and in all other flegmaticall tumors
of the throat, in the night mare, and all maladies of the tongue.

Of the veins of the neck.. 22.
TO conclude, there be certain veins in the neck, called of the Arabians
Guingedes, which usually were opened in the beginning of the leprie, in the
pain of the throat called Angina, in shortness and oppression of the breath,
impostumes of the lungs, in affections of the spleen and sides. Thus ending
this Chapter of the opening of all kind of veins, we will treat of boxing or
cupping, which also is greatly commended in Physic.

The ninth Chapter. Of Cupping.
THis is the second means, whereby the abundance of blood in man's body is
diminished. Galen did so highly esteem of it, that he terms it a precious
help, and commends it in many diseases, but especially where phlegm and
windiness does exceed. He ascribes unto it the attraction of humors, ceasing
of pain, diminishing of phlegm, dissipation of windines, to provoke hunger, to
withdraw and to stay rheumes, and to stanch bleeding. He advises also to use
it in a great pain of the belly proceeding of wind, as the most true and
present remedy, namely, to fasten a great box or cup on the place pained, and
often to renew it: for thereby is the wind maruellously drawn forth and
dissipated: and not only for this, but for the hardness and other accidents of
the spleen, but without picking or opening of the skin. But note that this
boxing or cupping ought not to be used, except the patient have first of all
thoroughly been purged: otherwise it does draw the superfluous humiditie, which
lies deep underneath, outward to the skin. These boxes also are not to be set
just upon the place affected, but hard by it thereabout, that by them the
matter might be dissipated and withdrawn: As for example, if a woman had too
many of her flowers continuing, the cups or boxes shall be set upon her breasts.
In too much bleeding at the nose, upon the navel, and so in more places
contrary still to the course of the blood, or else upon the veins whence the
cause proceeds: likewise to provoke or move the terms in women, the cups
shall be fixed upon the thighs: in sore eyes, behind the neck, as in many
places in this book shall be showed. Thus much for the cupping without opening
the skin..

But if thou will open the skin also, as commonly is used in diverse parts of
the body, and especially in any hard tumor or Schyrrhus, or other swellings
with a great distention and pain. In like manner when thou will draw the
peccant matter from the infected place to another, as to remove headache, the
cups are fixed on the caves of the legs with opening of the skin: which also is
done if the terms or flowers in women be stayed, and in such like other
accidents, as hereafter in this book at large shall appear.

The tenth Chapter. Of the diminishing of the blood by Horsleaches.
THe third means whereby the blood is drawn forth of the body, is that blood
sucking water worm, which the ancient Physicians by their experience for the
help of man have found out. These Horsleaches are of diverse and sundry
colors, some black, some red some greenish, and of many other colous. They
are all of them somewhat venomous, but especially those that be party colored
with green stripes, big, and live in stinking pooles, which altogether are to
be avoided. Others that appear in May, and most of all about noone, abide in
other pooles and waters where also they are taken: how to prepare them for to
use, has been showed in the sixth Chapter.

Before they be fastened, the place must first be well chafed, with water
moistened, and well scratched with the nails; then take they the better hold.
When they are fast, anoint the place with warm oil that it cool not: and if
they be fixed to either hands or feet, then put that part into lukewarm
water, whereon they be fastened: but if they draw or suck not strong enough,
c^^ off a little piece of their tails, that the blood may pass through them;
for they will not leave sucking for all that, unless a little salt or a few
ashes be cast upon their heads, or that they be stricken on the head with a
little wand or rod, or that they be burnt with a wax candle. After they be
fallen off, thou shall fasten a box or cup upon the same place to draw out the
remaining blood and venom, or else moisten it with a warm sponge: and if it
continue bleeding, cast some meal on it, and lay sheep wool dipped in oil
upon that, or some other thing; as in the fifth part of this book is taught how
to stanch blood.

Here is also to be observed, that these horsleeches do not draw the blood out
of the inward parts of the body, but only that which lies in the flesh
thereabout, so that they can only be used in place of boxes, and especially in
black melancholy blood, which by nature they only suck forth. And this is all
the difference between the use of them and of cups.

In the application or fastening of Horsleaches, they must be put into a quill,
reed or cane, that they take hold of no other place but where they should.

It is furthermore well known, that great store of superfluous humidities are
expelled by baths, sweat, rubbing, vomiting, and such like: but because these
things must be altered, augmented and diminished according to the estate of the
person, great heed ought to be given, what here and there in this book is
spoken of them.

The eleventh Chapter. Of the six things not natural, called of the
Physicians Res non naturales.
THe cause why we make no mention of these six things, is, for that by them a
general rule of the life is to be observed, but most of all in the time of
sickness, when every one (according as necessity requires) is taught what
order is to be kept in every of them.

The first is air, to wit, what air ought to be elected, what to be refused,
and if neither of these may be, by what means to correct it.

The second is moving or motion, which is not a little to be regarded, because
some diseases require much moving, others little, and some none at all.

The third is sleep and watching, which is of no less account than motion.

The fourth is fullness and emptiness, which teaches what order is to be
followed in meat and drink, as also in hunger and abstinence: the means also
to restore that which either is wanting in the one or in the other.

The fifth, the accidents or motions of the mind, as anger, fear, gladness,
sorrow, love, hatred, etc. which oftentimes cause great change and alteration
both in sickness and in health.

The sixth is meat and drink; which is meet for every disease, which unmeet.
Of the which in every particular disease, several instructions shall be given:
this general rule presupposed, that no man diseased shall ouerlade his
stomach with meat or drink, except it were to vomit it up again. It is also
better to eat thrice a day, and a little at once, than but twice abundantly.

If of all these things thou will have a more just explication, look in the
second part of the wheesing and stopping of the breath, by the which thou
may also rule thy self in other infirmities.

Furthermore, whatsoever might be said of the four complexions or humors of
man's body, as blood, choler, phlegm and melancholy, with their encompassed
mixtures called Intemperies, which are eight fold, and what else does
appertain unto them, shall sufficiently as opportunity serves hereafter be
declared.

The twelfth Chapter. An explication of all the weights and measures which
commonly are used in Physic.
THere be two sorts of pounds: the common pound contains sixteen ounces, but
the physical pound has but twelve ounces. It is abbreuiated thus, lib. but to
avoid all errors, we have set down the word pound: and where a physical
pound was meant, there are twelve ounces specified.

An ounce contains eight dragmes, which every where is noted by the name
ounce.

Half an ounce is four dragmes, which is noted by the Physicians and
Apothecaries with this mark. ss. which might breed error, and therefore do
we set the name of half an ounce.

Dragma is the eight part of an ounce, which we write thus, dragme or drag.
least by the character some error might be committed.

Scrupulus is the third part of a dragme, and shall be written after this
manner, scruple or scrup.

Granum a grain, is the weight of a barley corn, whereof twenty do make one
scruple: but because that barley corns are bigger in one country than in
another, thou shall in steed of them use pepper corns, and so take twenty of
them for a scruple: This shall be noted by the name grain.

Manipulus is a handful of herbs, flowers or seeds, and this shall be marked
thus with an M. and half an handful, which is called of the Apothecaries
Pugillus, shall be noted thus, half M.

Measures of water, honey and such like liquors, do we esteem every wine-pint
at eighteen ounces.

Note also, that if thou happen to find any unknown name or word in this
book, either in Latin or English, that thou shall find it in the Table or
Index at the end.

After all the instructions we will by Gods grace come to the principal, and
beginning at the uppermost part of the body, that is the head, descend
downward to the foot.

The most high Physician God our most dear father, through Jesus Christ our
only Savior, give us his blessing and grace to finish it.

The end of the Introduction.
The first part of this Book contains the Head, with all the parts thereof,
to the very neck, as Face, Hair, Beard, Scull, Brain, Nose, Ears, Lips,
Mouth, Tongue, Teeth, Speech, etc. with all such accidents as are incident unto
them, and their appropriate remedies.
The first Chapter. Of pain in the Head.
THere are many pains of the head, by the Arabians commonly called Soda: which
as they proceed of diverse causes, so do they also differ in nature. They are
delivered unto us either in particular, proper, principal or universal
affections, under which all the other are comprehended, as Cephalalgia,
Cephalaea, Hemicrania, and Congelation.

Of giddiness of the head, falling evil, dead palsy, and such like
infirmities shall be spoken hereafter, where we entreat of the brain: for that
these and diverse other diseases are caused for the most part of a debilitie and
weakness of the brain.

Of all outward accidents, as blows, bruises, wounds, and falls on the head,
shall be showed in the Chapter of the braine-pan or scull.

Cephalalgia.
Cephalalgia, by the Greeks so termed, is such a disease that almost affects
the whole head: which sometimes is very violent, otherwhiles more tolerable,
and either continues long, or passes over speedily.

Cephalaea.
Cephalaea is an intolerable headache, which (notwithstanding that it has some
communion with the aforenamed Cephalalgia) does maruellously weaken all the
powers of the head, and at sometime cease, seeming as though it would not
return again, yet (in manner like unto the falling sickness) by fits
returns with such violence, such noise in the ears, such beating in the
forehead, such thrusting forth of the eyes, and finally with such swelling up
of all the veins of the head, that both hearing and sight thereby decays:
yea takes diverse with that extremity, that it seems unto them as if
something did beat on the inside of their head with a hammer, and would rend
and tear their head asunder. This ach sometimes comes in the sinews of the
eyes, and does opilate and harm them greatly, and at the length induces
blindness altogether. And albeit this affection of the head often times grows of
a light and small cause, yet procures it diverse times very heavy and grievous
accidents.

Hemicrania
Hemicrania is also an head ach, wherewith either the right or the left side,
the back or forepart of the head is infected: it takes commonly the one side
of the head, even from the midst of the forehead, and so passes through the
boll or concauity of the scull to the very back part of the head. It does also
very often so disease the eyes, that it perishes the sight of them: insomuch
that this pain is so like to the above named Cephalaea, that Galen and many
others do not only describe them both together, but use also one and the
selfsame remedies for them both, as hereafter may appear.

Congelatio.
The fourth kind of headache is Congelatio, as it were a cold nummednesse: this
proceeding from the back part of the head takes away all sense and feeling of
the patient, and therefore it is not unlike unto that heavy and drowsy disease
Lethargus and Stup^r, wherein also the affected body is suddenly deprived both
of sense and feeling.

Of the causes of headache.. 1.
THe common causes of headache in general are innumerable; as heat of the
Sun, bathings, change of air, a continual South wind, a strong sent of
spices, whether they be hot or cold by nature: also the smell of wine,
drunkenness, stinking meat, garlic, onions, mustard, strokes or blows,
bruisings or great motions of the brain, sleep presently after dinner, much
bleeding, worms in the ears, nostrels, or stomach, choler in the stomach,
fumes and vapors out of the same, too much repletion of the stomach,
Intemperies or an unnatural mixture of the humors, with many more, which for
breuities sake we omit, and will treat of more necessary matters. But for the
most part (as has already been said) this pain in the head proceeds of the
intemperature of the four humors, namely of blood, choler, phlegm and
melancholy. The Physicians have found out eight kinds of this intemperature,
with their appropriate and due remedies, as hereafter at large shall be showed.
As concerning the aches and pains of the head, we do divide them into hot or
cold aches, in which all others that we purpose to treat of are comprehended,
and so begin with the hot pains of the head.

The signs of a hot headache that proceeds from choler.. 2.
IN this kind of headache are these common signs, belching or breaking of wind
upward with lothsomnesse and thirst, dryth of the mouth, tongue and nostrels.
The pain is pricking, sharp, and rather in the right than in the left side of
the head, heat over all the body, but especially in the nostrels, no appetite,
no sleep, the pulses hasty and quick, the urine reddish, the face yellow.
The surest notes are, if the time of the year be hot and dry, the patient
young, and has used those things that procure heat and dryth.

The causes and signs then being known, now follow the first and especiallest
means to ease it, namely in shunning those things that in any way might either
procure or continue it, as hot wines, the sent of hot and strong things, the
use of meats hot in operation: then to begin (not only in this, but in all
other infirmities whatsoever) with the easiest remedies at the first, and most
of all if this hot pain of the head be but new and of no continuance: at
which time, to delay the heat, thou may safely use these things that follow.

Applications, Ointments, Plasters, Lotions.
OXyrrhodinum applied outwardly is greatly commended, that is, oil of roses,
water and vinegar of roses, of each a like quantity: in this mixture dippe
double linen clothes, and lay them so cold and wet to the forehead, from one
temple to another, and as often as it dries must it be refreshed again.
Others make it stronger thus: Take of Rose water five ounces, of Melilot water
four ounces, water of Nightshade two ounces, oil of Roses one ounce and a
half, Rose vinegar one ounce, use it as the other before. These two
compositions, by reason of the Oil and vinegar of Roses which are in them, are
called Oxyrrhodina: unto which (if the heat be very extreme) thou may add
one dragme of Camfere. Also take the white of an egg well beaten, Rose water
one ounce, water of Elder, and Fennel water, of each half an ounce, five
small Nuts well beaten in a mortar, a little Saffron; lay this to the forehead
with wool. Another that is more stronger, the water of the white water-Lilly,
water of Endive, of each three ounces, red, white, and yellow Saunders, or one
of them, of each one dragme, beaten Rose leaves half a dragme, beaten Camfere
half a dragme, mix them all together, and use them as is above showed. This
cools greatly, and eases the pain of the head.

The ointment of Roses described by Mesues.
TAke fresh or new hogs grease, as much as thou will; wash it very often with
warm water, afterward with cold water: then take as many Roses in weight as
thy grease weighs, beat them both together in a mortar, let them so rest the
space of seven days: then strain it through a cloth, and beat as many Roses
with thy grease as before, and so let them stand other seven days; strain
them again, and add to thy grease half the weight of the juice of Roses, and
the sixth part of the oil of sweet Almonds, and boil them together until all
the juice be consumed, which thou shall know thus: put one or two drops of it
into the fire, where if it make no noise or hissing like unto water, then it is
sufficiently boiled: then take it from the fire, stirring it continually with a
wooden pestell until it waxes stiff and white: some add a little Opium
unto it to make it cool the more, but it is needless; for if it be necessary,
thou may add it at all times afterward. This ointment is an especial good
remedy in Cephalalgia and heat of the head, it stays flegmaticall rheumes
and flegmons, it mitigateth the canker, it is also good for the heat of the
stomach, liver, kidneyes, etc.

A cooling unguent, Infrigidans Galeni.
TAke two ounces of white or virgin wax, melt it easily, and wash it often
with fair water, and at the last with white vinegar: then add unto it four
ounces of the oil of Roses, which also has been washed as before. It may also
be made up in form of a plaster or Ceratum. It eases both the heat of agues
and of the head, being applied to the forehead and temples: it is also very
good against the pain of the kidneys. If thou will use it for the pain of the
head, melt it on a little fire, then wash it with vinegar, and with the juice of
Plantaine and Nightshade, anoint the forehead with it, especially on those
seames of the scull: then lay vine or willow leaves upon it, and thou shall
find great ease. To the same intent is the Poplar unguent or Vnguentum Populeum
also used, which is found ready made in all Apothecaries shops. Likewise take
Rose leaves, Willow leaves, water Lillies, Mallows, of each one handful,
boil them in water, and irrigate thy head with it. Also take Violets, Barley
beaten in a mortar, beaten Gourd seeds or the bark of Gourds, Poppy heads,
seeds of Hollihocke, Purslaine seeds, Lettice seeds, of each one handful:
boil them in water, and let the decoction being warm drop from on high upon
thy head. Note also that if necessity and the violent pain should require
stronger remedies, then use the juice of such herbs as are cold and dry, as
of Plantaine, of Shepherds purse, of Nightshade, of Housleeke, of
Pomegranates, and in the greatest extremity add a little Opium unto it, of
Henbane: adding the juice of Southernewood or of poppie unto it, and applying
them to the head as is above said. Here is also to be observed, that these
stupefactiue or narcolicall things are not to be used, but only in the
greatest extremities. Neither may any such cold remedies be adhibited to the
back-part of the head, but only to the forehead. In fine, wheresoever these and
such like may be omitted, there are they not at al to be used: notwithstanding
if the extremity be such that no other remedies would serve the turn, and any
danger might ensue of any obstupefaction or numming of any one part, this shall
be sometimes used: Take the wood of Cassia small beaten one dragme, mix it
with oil, and drop it into the ears and nostrels: and if peradventure the
patient should loose both sense and feeling, then mix half a dragme of Beuer
Cod, a scruple of Saffron, and a little oil of Olives, or rather oil of
Chestnuts together.

Also make this emplaister: Take of the Vine buds, beat them small, and add
as much oil of Roses and Barley flower as shall suffice, then lay it
plaisterwise to the forehead: in the want of Vine buds take Housleeke, or the
juice of Nightshade, of Shepherds purse, or of Lettice. Or else take yellow
Saunders, Roses, water Lillies, of each half an ounce, Camfere one scruple,
Spica of India half one scruple: wet them together with Rose water, boil
them, and receive the vapors at your nose through a funnell: likewise take
Roses, the blossoms of the Pomegranate tree, shells of Pomegranates, seeds or
berries of the Myrtle tree, shells of Citrones, of each one dragme, Agarick as
much; boil them in lie a little while, and wash the head with it. This
cools, dries and strengthens the brains. Otherwise take Venice hard or
cake Soap, slice it small into a flat earthen pan, power a good strong ley upon
it, cover it with a linen cloth, and set it in the warm sun while the Soap
be molten: stir it oftentimes til the ley be euaporated or dried away, then put
Rose water upon it, and let it dry again: this reiterate so often till the
Soap have lost her strong and unsavory smell, and imbibe the sweet smell of
the Rose water. Take of this prepared Soap one pound, white or yellow Saunders,
Roses, of each half one ounce, water Lillies two dragmes, Camfere one dragme,
being all beaten to powder mix them with the Soap, and make it up in little
cakes, dry them, and reserve them for thy use.

Of the pain in the head with agues, and laske or flixe of the belly.. 3.
WHereas this pain of the head is oftentimes cause of diverse other maladies,
it shall not be amiss to describe that headache which reigned in the year of
our Lord 1564 in Mosbach, and in the whole Dukedom of the Palsgraue of Rhene:
at which time I compiled this present work.

This pain began with a shiuering cold, presently ensued an ague with a little
heat, but with great drithe and thirst, which continued about one fortnight or
more. It returned unto diverse after they had bin clear of it a month or
twain, and that twice or thrice together: others were intolerably troubled in
the head, and some so vehemently vexed with a flixe of the belly without
blood, that it could by no means by stayed, yea they oftentimes very miserably
perished with it.

In this headache were these remedies found very effectual and good. First, if
nothing do dissuade from it, thou shall open the head vein, especially if the
patient be young, full of blood, and be of body strong and able enough to bear
it. Children shall then purge with easy medicines, as Cassia, Manna, sirupe of
Roses, Seen leaves decocted with some cooling herbs. The bigger sort shall be
purged with sharp pills and other purgations, if they have no laske withal:
and if nothing else could be had out of hand, thou shall make this decoction or
drink: Take Sena leaves one ounce, Cinnamom, Annise and Fennel seeds,
Currants, of each as much as thou can hold between two of thy fingers,
Licorise the length of thy finger, if it be a thick stick take less of it,
one fig, both cut small, sweet Marioram, Rosemarie, as much as thou can take
up between thy fingers, Sugar one ounce: boil them all in a quart of water,
till half be consumed: of this give to a child to drink two ounces, to an old
body four ounces, to a strong body may thou boil half an ounce of Seen
leaves with it. For women and children to be boxed on the sholders and legs is
very good, or to rub their arms and legs with warm clothes downwards. It is
also good for them to bathe their feet in the decoction of Cummomill, Roses
and Betonie. Wines of all sorts must be shunned in this infirmity, and all
things that are hot, as Spices, Onions, Garlic and such like: for daily
drink take two handfuls of Barley, Anniseedes half an ounce, Raisins one ounce
and a half: boil these together in a pottle of water, till the Barley do
burst: then add three dragmes of Cinnamom grossly beaten, and let it boil a
little, and so cool. Seeing then this sickness provoke thirst, thou may
not altogether bar the diseased from any kind of drink, but let him take
enough of the prescribed decoction, with the sirupe of Roses, of Violets or of
Citrones admixed. Thou may also give him ye conserve of the same flowers,
with the water of Endive, Succorie, Borage, and of Lettice, for that it does
comfort the heart. For his meat he shall commonly use French Barley boiled with
a hen in broth, veale, kids flesh, or stewed Prunes, and such like light
meats. But if a flixe or looseness in the body be adjoined to the former
infirmity, the affected party shall in any wise take great heed of such
light and loosing meats: and only use roasted veale, pullets roasted, and other
small birds, stewed Quinces, or any such like thing. Or if he would have any
other meat dressed, it shall be done with stilled water, which is made as
follows: Take as much fair water as thou will, set it on the fire, and cast
a good piece of steel into it, being first made red hot three or four times
together: then let the water cool, and use it as thou will. In like sort also
may thou prepare water of iron, of gold, of silver, and of flints for the
same purpose: thus is wine, the milk of a cow and of goats also steeled.

But to come to our purpose again: as long as this looseness of the body does
continue, thou shall annoint the stomach twice a day with the oils of Mastix
and of Quinces. If it be about the time of the year that Sloes be ripe, take
as many of them as you please, put them into a pot, and power boiling water
upon them; stop or cover them very close: give unto the infirmed body three or
four of these a little before his meat: noting always, that in four and
twenty hours he use not above twenty of them at the most.

Contrariwise, if the body be bound, thou shall seek by all means thou
may, to loose it: otherwise many vapors ascend up into the head, and there
augment both the heat and the pain, yea oftentimes bereave the patient of his
wits. Wherefore first of all thou shall try to open the body by
suppositories, which if they will not suffice, use common Clisters, which
herafter in the third part for the binding and stopping of the body are
prescribed. Otherwise, if these do not please thee, use some cooling purgation,
or else that purging potion above described. There be above set down many
unguents, salues, and waters, but all are very good for the pain of the head.
But in this kind of headache, this remedy that follows is expressly
described: Take of the water of Lettice, Nightshade, and of Housleeke, of each
two ounces, water of Camomill an ounce and a half, good strong vinegar one
ounce, Camfere beaten four grains: mix them all together, or take Rose
water, Rose vinegar, Melilot water, Betonie water, of each, or of as many as
are to be had, what quantity thou please, wet linen clothes in them, and lay
them to the forehead.

In this infirmity oftentimes is both the tongue and throat very raw and sore,
by reason of the great heat; for the which look the remedies that are set
down in the Chap. 13.. 6. of this first part, for the infirmities and heat of
the tongue: and the gargarismes for the pain in the throat in the first Chapter
of the second part.

The sirupe of Mulberies with Plantaine, Knotgrasse, and Selfeheale water
admired, conduces and helps very much: likewise, take the seed of Quinces,
and the seed of Fleawoort: then take a little stick, and tie to the end of it
a little skarlet or linen cloth with one dragme of these seeds in it, steep
it in the water of Selfeheale: when thou will cleanse thy tongue, rub it easily
with that cloth so steeped: it cleanses, moisteneth, cools and heals all
the chops or clifts in it.

To comfort the heart, use Manus Christi, with Pearls, conserve of water
Lillies, Pomegranates preserved Citrons, and others such like.

This binding water has done very many much good: Take a hot wheaten loaf
new taken out of the oven, take out all the crum of it, put a good quantity of
steeled water unto it, with one ounce and a half of Nutmegs, stop it close,
and let it so stand one whole day in a warm place: then still of the water in
a glass Lembecke: give of this to the patient every morning two ounces, and
let him fast two hours after it: two hours after his meat, give him as much
more, not forgetting first to warm it always, and let him then fast till
night. The third potion or draught he shall take the next morning fasting (as
before) after the same: this is not only in this kind of flixe, but in all
other flixes experimented and approved. Note also, that if the flixe be without
heat, thou may take red wine in stead of the water: for then will it be of
better force and virtue.

Heat of the head with melancholy.. 4.
THis infirmity is described by these signs following: the pain is not so
great as the former, but with a dryness and sadness: the heat is more
evident in the left side of the face than in the right, it causes
disquietnesse, and albeit the sick sometimes takes rest, yet it is an
unnatural sleep, it makes the affected faint hearted, fearful and careful,
the color of the face is red and blew, with a sower taste in the mouth: if the
patient be old, if it be about the Autumn, then are the signs the surer. Thou
shall use those remedies for this malady which are prescribed against
melancholy, as sufficiently shall appear hereafter. Also use this Clister:
Take Mallows, Violet leaves, Buglosse, Fumitorie, Bran, of each one M.
Polipody, Epithymus, or Dodder, of each one drag. boil them together in a
sufficient quantity of water, take twelve or sixteen ounces of this
decoction, oil of Olives, three ounces. Stronger Clisters shall thou find
elsewhere described. Thou may also make these or the like suppositories: Take
Coloquint, Salamoniacke, of each one dragme, Ox gall two dragmes, sodden or
boiled honey three ounces: make them reasonable thick and long: they are very
effectual and strong.

Headache proceeding from emptiness of the stomach.. 5.
IT befalls oftentimes, that this headache vexes many every day, especially
before they eat or drink any thing, and presently after meals departs;
wherefore to avoid this emptiness of the stomach, thou shall every morning
take one bit of bread dipped in vinegar, or in the juice of Pomgranates, or
veriuice.

The order of diet in hot headaches.
THose that are troubled with a headache that proceeds of heat, must
altogether abstain from wine, as has been already said, and not eat any
flesh at all or very little: for both of them do engender much blood. Their
meat must be things cold by nature, as Lettice sodden and stewed, Spinach,
Purslaine, Panadoes, broths, beer and bread sodden together, Apples and Pears
stewed, broths of veale, of hens, being sharpened with a little veriuice. Their
drink shall be small beer, whay of milk, Barley water, with a little of the
juice of Pomegranates or Limons.

Of Cephalaea and Hemicrania certain pains of the head.. 6.
IF this headache do come with quick and hasty pulls, and with heat, then
shall it seem good first of all to purge the body: and if the circumstances
of the infirmity permit it, the patient shall use this lenitiue medicine, which
is thus prepared: Take of the greater and lesser Endive, Lettice, of each one
handful, Poppy heads, two ounces, seeds of Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and of
Pompions, of each two dragmes, grossly beaten half an ounce; Violets, Roses,
white and yellow Saunders, of each two dragmes: boil them all in a sufficient
quantity of water, till the third part be consumed, then add twelve ounces of
Sugar, boil it to the consistence of a sirupe, and then clarify it with the
whites of eggs. Of this give to the sick one ounce and a half at once, with
the water of Borage, or Endive, or Buglosse: use this three or four times
every morning.

Because there is a great use of sirupes in this book, How to make sirupes.
I will now show and set down the perfect order and way how to make and
prepare them. First see thou have fresh and clear water, with which thou will
make thy sirupe: put into it those things first which are hardest, as roots,
woods and such like, let them boil as long as thou would sees a couple of
eggs: then cast into it thy seeds grossly beaten, then thy herbs being cut,
after them thy flowers and Currants: let them boil well together, that their
strength may come forth, and if Epithymus be one of the ingredients, let it be
put in last of all, and when it is sodden sufficiently, add thy honey or sugar
unto it, and clarify it with the whites of eggs, as has been taught in the
Introduction, namely, in the clarifying of Sugar: after this manner may thou
also deal in the purifying of honey.

But to come to the purpose again; thou shall note, that if the choler be
supple and thin, then shall thou take sirupe of Endive, of Violets, of water
Lillies, of each three drag. admixed with the above named waters: if the choler
be gross and thick, then take in stead of the sirupes, the like quantity of
Oxysaccharu^ compos. Rasis counsels to give this purgation after it: Take
Damask Prunes ten drag. sour Dates one ounce: boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water: in this decoction steep the rind or bark of yellow
Mirobalans two dragm. grossly beaten, the next day strain and press out all the
liquor, and give three or four ounces of it in the morning. Others boil
Violets and water Lillies, of each one ounce, Stechas or French Lauander, two
ounces, with half an ounce of Mirobalans: this always give at the first. They
are both of them easy and safe purgations: for which cause also it is found
good sometimes (according to need) to add three grains of Diagridium to them,
or else to mix with them of the conserve of Prunes, or of Electuarium de succo
Rosarum, three dragmes. Also in stead of the foresaid potion or drink, thou
may use this confection that follows: Take of both the confections before
named, of each half an ounce, sirupe of water Lillies as much as suffices to
mix them withal, and cast some Betonie roots powdered and a little Sugar
upon it.

Likewise if thou had rather use pills: take two dragmes of Rubarbe, Mastix
one scruple, Scammonie half a dragme: make pills of them with the juice of Rue,
or with wine, and take a dragme at one time of them.

For the same purpose are sower Dates approved to be an especial good remedy,
and may in this hot kind of headache very safely and with very great effect be
adhibited. But thou must take three or four ounces of them at once, as thou
may behold their description and virtues in our Introductio^. This manner of
purging is set for an example, which according to the circumstances both of the
disease and of the diseased, may either be changed or used at pleasure.

The body then being purged, the oil of Roses, or of water of Lillies shall be
dropped, or by some other means put into the patients nose, and let him smell
to Camfere, Rose water, or the water of Violets. Or take oil of Violets, of
Roses, of water Lillies of each half an ounce, Camfere three grains: rub them
well together, and put them into his nose.

In like sort also take oil of the seeds of Gourds, Willow leaves, and oil
of Roses, and use it as before: likewise in place of the foresaid oiles, thou
may use cooling herbs, as Nightshade, Housleeke laid to the forehead with
tow and double linen clothes. Also to the same end is women's milk mixed very
well with the white of an eg, and so laid to the forehead especially approved:
or let the patient bath and rub his legs with the decoction of Vine leaves,
water Lillies, Violets, Gourds, Cucumber, and Melon leaves; and if for all this
the pain would still increase, thou may mix two or three grains of Opium
or Camfere with it, and often iterate the dropping of the oil of Willow leaves
into the ears and nostrils: for this purges the head greatly. But see thou
forget not that which before has bin said de Narcoticis and obstupefactiue
things.

A sweet ball for the headache approved: Take Violets, water Lillies, Willow
leaves, Roses, of each one ounce, Camfere two grains, beat them all together,
and bind them up together in a fine piece of silk or linen cloth, and wet it
often with a little Rose water. Others beat the foresaid simples into fine
powder, and with molten wax make it up in form of a ball; but this is not so
good. Many such like cooling bals are described in the treatise of the plague,
in two diverse places of the sixth part, as well to recreate and restore the
sick, as to preserve the sound.

Headache proceeding of the sun or south wind.. 7
IF the pain of the head be caused by the heat of the sun, then may it
easily be remedied with the above described Oxyrrhodinum, unguent of Roses, the
cooling unguent of Galen, etc. And if those would not suffice, use the juices
of the before named cold herbs. Also the oils of Roses, of Violets, mix with
them as much strong vinegar, as thou take of one of the oiles, beat them
well together, dip a woollen cloth in it, and lay it where the pain is.
Furthermore, the patient shall observe and keep the same diet that is above
set down in the Chapter of Cephalalgia: eat things light of digesture,
abstain from al things that might any way trouble or vex the head, and if
need require, to purge with cooling medicines, as above is already showed.

Headache that comes of drunkenness.. 8.
OF the disease that proceeds from drunkenness, shall be spoken hereafter:
now we will only entreat of headache without any other infirmity adioining
with it. Needelesse it is at this present to recite any signs of this kind of
headache, for that every thing is most evident, whether this pain take her
beginning of drunkenness by wine or beer. The first remedy is to vomit; the
second, to sleep long, to fast it out, the broth of Colewoorts, or of Beetes a
good quantity being taken: also to drink much cold water, and to eat sower
fruits; but the best meat is first of all to eat sodden Lentils, Colewoorts
and Pullets dressed with veriuice or Limons. The patient shall also smell to
Roses or Camfire: let the uttermost parts of his body be rubbed, drink wine
allayed with water, and two days after eat astringent and binding meats, with
Pomegranates. The first day also shall it not be amiss to anoint the forehead
and temples with the oil of Roses, the next day with the oil of Cammomill or
of Lillies: and if peradventure the pain as yet would not cease, he shall (as
need does require) be purged, especially if any vapors ascend up into the
head. Likewise he may also use this powder following: Take Colewoort seeds,
Barbary seeds, Endive seeds, Lentils, Roses, calcined or burnt Iuorie, or
Elephants tooth, of each two drag. make it into a very supple powder, give of
this two drag. at once, Camfire prepared, three grains, with the sirupe of
Pomegranates or Citrons.

Headache proceeding of a stroke or fall.. 9.
IF any one were hurt in the head by a stroke, a fall, or the throwing of a
stone without any wound or breaking of the skin, or fracture of the skull, he
shall first of all be let blood in the head vein, and afterward (if need
require) take a common Clister: and (if he have not an ague) he shall be purged
with Pilulae Cochiae. And first of all lay on his head being shaven, this that
follows: Take the shelles and flowers of Pomegranates, the juice of Sloes,
Hyppocystis, fine Bole, Sanguis Draconis, Terra sigillata, of each one drag.
beat them all into powder, mix it with the whites of eggs, and lay it upon the
place affected or bruised. Or take the decoction of Roses, of Myrtle seed, or
of Willow leaves, applying it three or four times a day: then take oil of
Mirtles, and of Roses, of each one ounce, Myrtle seeds, juice of Sloes,
Hyppocystis, of each one dragme, mix them together with a little molten wax,
and if there be no suffusion or congealed blood, anoint the place with it two or
three days together.

Thou may also make a pultis of Roses, Cammomill, and Melilot flowers, adding
a little fine Bole to it, and mixing it with the oils above named. If an ague
be present, use either cold or lukewarm things: also let him smell to cooling
things, as Violets, Camfire, Willow leaves, and Myrtle leaves, etc.

The second Chapter. Of the pain of the head that is caused by cold.
IF the pain of the head proceed of cold flegmaticke humors and continue
long, then are these the signs: wearisomnesse of all the parts, and as if all
the body were beaten and broken into pieces: the pain is not extreme,
without any swelling or thirst, fleepinesse, much spitting at the mouth, much
moisture at the nose: for such like humidities do daily increase in the
diseased; the face is always palely colored, and somewhat swollen, the eyes
run, and the mouth is quite out of taste. In such cold headaches, must contrary
remedies be used, that is, warming and drying medicines. Also we must begin
here likewise with the gentlest and easiest remedies first, as this example
following shows: which always must be holden in the mouth, chewing it
continually, and casting forth the slime and spittle, which thereby is
gathered. Take Mastix, Nutmegs, Diptamer of Candie, Pepper, Stauesaker,
Pellitorie of Spain, Cubebs, Ginger, bound up in a little cloth.

The manner of purging in this infirmity.. 1.
SEeing that purging is very needful in this kind of headache, purge
therefore both head and body in manner as follows: Take Sage, Lauander
gentle, Bayberies, wild Mints, Hysope, Marioram, sweet Marioram, garden Mints,
Calmus, of each one M. seeds of Fennel, Persley, Sparage, Endive of each two
dragmes, Raisins, Nux Pinea, seeds of Melons, of Pompions, of Gourds, and of
Cucumbers, Roses, roots of wild Smallage, Annise seeds, of each half an
ounce, Cubebs, Pionie seeds, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each a drag and a half,
Spikenard of India, Ginger, Cinnamom, Pepper, of each half a drag. boil these
things in a sufficient quantity of water, then press out all the moisture
from them, and boil it the second time with honey or Sugar to the consistence
of a sirupe. This if thou would have to purge, add unto it seeds of wild
Saffron, Hermodactils, of each half an ounce, Agaricke six dragmes, Salt gem
half one scruple, Turbit two dragmes: knit up these together in a little bag,
and boil them in the foresaid liquor. Afterward sharpen thy sirupe with the
vinegar of Squils as follows. Of this sirupe thou may give one ounce and a
half, or two ounces at once, mingled with good wine, or else with some other
distilled waters that may serve to the same end, three or four days
continually together.

^^nell of Squi^om^^^.
The composition of the vinegar of Squils is as follows: Take the Squill
(called in Latin Scilla) take away the external shells from it, till thou come
to the white: these white ones take off by themselves severally with thy hand,
or else with a wooden Spattin or knife, and not with iron, for that is hurtful:
also leave out the heart, the innermost part of the Squill, and take only the
middle white shiuers of it: fasten all these on a thread, that the one touch not
the other, and hang them up to dry forty days in a cool place and in the
shade. But this way that follows, is much better: Take away all the uttermost
parts until thou come to the white, then wrap it up in dow, and bake it in an
oven: afterward part it in shiuers as before, and dry it as is already said.
Take of this dried Squils as much as thou will, cut it into little pieces with
a wooden or been instrument, put four times as much vinegar upon it in a
glass and let it so continue forty days in the sun.

Having taken the foresaid potion as has bin taught before, thou shall give
him Pillula Cochiae. If thou will have them strong, take two dragmes of them;
Coloquint, Bdellium, of each one scruple, make them into pills with the water of
Sage: of these give but one dragme at one time because they be very strong: to
the same purpose likewise serve the pills Alephangina, Aureae, and Aloes
prepared, being taken a dragme at once. But if the sick would rather take a
potion than these pills: Take Lauander gentle, flowers of Borage and Buglosse,
Currants, of each one ounce, Basil seed one dragme, Agarick, Turbit, of each
one dragme, boil them in a sufficient potion of water, until there remain
about ten ounces, steep in this liquor one ounce and a half of the barks of
Mirobalans called Chebuli, and set it so in warm ashes all one whole night:
then press it out hard, and give three ounces of it at once. Also take Hiera
picra, Agarick, of each one dragme, Lauander, Saffron, of each one scruple,
Salt gem, two grains, mix them with some broth that Nutmegs and Sage has bin
boiled in. In like manner may thou use this that follows: Take honey of
Roses, sirupe of Stechas, of each three dragmes, Agarick, Turbit, of each two
scruples, Spica, three grains, prepared Turpentine, half an ounce; beaten to
powder all what thou can beat, melt thy Turpentine in some hot broth, and
when it is as cold that it may be drunken, mix the powders and sirupes with
it, and give it early in the morning. This must be either diminished or
augmented in quality, according to the ability of the patient.

If the diseased can bear no kind of Physic, then use this Clister: Take
Mallows, herb Mercury, Dill, Rue, Bran, of each one handful, boil them in
a sufficient quantity of water, take of Colatare twelve or sixteen ounces,
mix with it of Hiera picra, of white Sugar, of each half an ounce or somewhat
more, Salt, two dragmes, oil of Dill and Rue, of each one ounce and a half,
and minister it warm.

Gargarismes also are very good for this malady, because they draw forth a
great deal of slime and filthiness from the head. Take Mastix, Calmus,
Licorice, Currants, of each half an ounce, Hissope, Ireos, of each two dragms,
Pellitorie of Spain, Saxifrage, Ginger, Mustard seeds, of each one dragme,
beat them all together, and boil them in fresh water: use it three or four
times a day warm.

Some do counsel to take a vomit of Radish water and Oxymell, but it is not
without some danger, for that it does oftentimes greatly disturb the head:
otherwise it might do some good.

There are also diverse confections and Electuaries made for the same, which
might warm and dry a cold and a moist brain: Take conserve of Roses two
ounces and a half, conserve of Betonie one ounce and a half, green Ginger half
an ounce, Cinnamom one dragme, Cloves, Annise seeds, of each one dragme, beat
and mix them all together: and if it be too dry, add as much of the sirupe of
Citrons unto it, as shall suffice, or as much of any other sirupe. Of this
e^hibite every morning the bigness of a nut in quantity.

Another Electuarie of life. This is described by Paulus Riccius, Paulus
Riccius Phisiti^^ to the Emperor his Electuarie.
head Physician to the Emperor Maximilian, and is very comfortable for the
head, for it does both warm and dry it. Take Currants six ounces, Licorice, two
dragmes, boil these in the waters of Buglosse, Scabious, and Betonie, of each
twelve ounces; then strain it and press out all the humiditie, in the which,
being yet warm, steep one dragme of Rubarbe, Lauander five grains: being
bound up together in a cloth, put them together in a pot, and stop it close,
and boil it a good while in a kettle with water, press it out and put into it
as much Rubarbe and Spike as before, letting them there remain all a night,
press it out again as before, and steep in it the barks of Mirobalans, to
wit, Chebuli, Indi, Bellirici, and yellow Mirobalans, of each one ounce,
Emblici two dragmes, boil them al together, and strain them through a linen
cloth; then ad Sugar six ounces, Manna two ounces, and let it boil to the
consistence of a sirupe: when it begins to cool, mingle in it Cinnamom
half an ounce, Cloves, Galingale, Nutmegs, of each one dragme, Lagnum Paradisi
half a dragme, seeds of Fennel and Annise, of each half an ounce: mix them
well together, and reserve it in a gally pot. This following is likewise
greatly commended for the same: Take conserve of Betonie, three ounces and a
half, conserve of Sage two ounces and a half, conserve of Rosemarie one ounce
and a half, conserve of Borage and Buglosse of each one ounce, of the foresaid
confection of life two ounces, Cinnamom two dragmes, preserved Chebuli half an
ounce, preserved Emblici two dragms, six leaves of beaten gold, ad as much
sirupe of Betonie as may suffice. This confection also comfort the heart:
Calamus Aromaticus
The right Calamus Aromaticus of the ancient Phisitio^s, as it is described in
the beginning of the eight part of this present book, takes away all cold
headaches, and sharpneth the wit.

Another conserve which is greatly commended for this kind of headache: Take
Cinnamom one ounce, Cubebs, Mirobalans, Chebuli, and Emblici, of each two
dragms, red Rose leaves, red Saunders, red Coral, of each one dragme,
Cardamonie, Mace, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each half a dragme, Sugar sixteen
ounces, dissolve your Sugar in rose water and Lauander water: boil it till it
be hard, and make it up into a cake or Manus Christi.

What virtues the confects of Coriander, Annise seeds, Fennel seeds, Commin
seeds, bitter Almonds, Haselnutg, and such like have to help, comfort and
strengthen a cold brain, as also how they keep back and hinder the fuming
vapors that would ascend from the stomach into the head, is at large declared
in the eight part.

An especial medicine of the ancient Physicians for the cold headache.
CUt the roots of Horseradish small, dry them and beat them into powder,
give of this one spoonefull in wine or broth, and let him sweat in his bed
very well, and fast two hours after it. Let his meat be light of digesture,
as pullets, and such like. But I must needs mislike of this remedy, for that
the Horseradish is very strong, and does more harm than good to the brain:
neither seems it any way convenient to sweat upon.

Certain wines composed for the cold headache.
TAke Rosemarie two M. Nutmegs one ounce, dried Betonie 2. ounces, Cloves two
dragmes being cut very small, put upon them eight quarts of good Rhenish wine,
let them so stand together three or four days. For the weakness of the
stomach drink a good draught of it in the beginning of thy meals: but for
the headache, at the latter end.

This wine is very good for a cold and moist brain, and hurtful for young
folks and hot complexions.

Another for the same: Take roots of Buglosse one M. roots of Cicorie half
as many, flowers of Buglosse, of Borage, of Roses, of Rosemarie, Hearts tongue, of
each half a M. boil them in four quartes of wine the space that thou may
boil an eg hard: let it cool, strain it, and then take four quarts of wine
more, and steep in it six Sage leaves, and as much Rosemarie, long Pepper one
ounce, Galingale one ounce and a half, Cloves, Cubebs, of each half an ounce,
Cardamonie two drag. Cinnamom, Currants prepared, Coriander seeds, of each one
ounce: these things being well beaten, tie them in a cloth, and boil them with
the wine, but not above twenty bubbles; then put both wines together in a
little rundlet, and let the spices steep in them eight days together,
pressing them out once a day. If this wine be too strong for thy drinking (as
it is most like to be) then mix other wines therewithal before thou drink it.

Of other Cephalicall herbs and spices, thou shall find a description in the
eight part of this book.

Hitherto we have abundantly treated of cold headaches with their appropriate
remedies internal: now because that outward applications oftentimes are of no
less effect than the inward medicines, I do purpose at this present to set
down diverse external remedies.

^^manders (...) the cold (...).
A Musk ball for the same: Take Laudanum half an ounce, Lignum Paradisi,
Styrax Calamita of each one drag. Cloves, Nutmegs, Basil seeds, of each half
a drag. Rose water with which a little Musk is dissolved, make it up into a
ball: if thou add a small quantity of Amber, it will be the better. Thou
shall find diverse sorts of these sweet smelling bals in sundry places of this
book described.

These bals are made after this manner: Take a warm mortar and pestell, and
put into it a little of the foresaid Rosewater, with the Laudanum and Wax:
stir them with the pestell together till they be molten, then mix the other
powders with them, except the Musk and Amber, and make it up in bals of what
bigness thou please; last of all, prick them full of little holes, but not
very deep, into the which thou shall put the Musk and Amber mixed first with
Rose water: then take some finely prepared Cotton, wipe the mortar with it, and
wrap the sweet ball in it, or keep it in a little red piece of sindal. It is
also good to snuff up some of the foresaid powder into the nose, or else a
little musk.

To perfume with all: Take Frankencense, wood of Paradise, Mastix, Nutmegs,
Styrax Calamita, of each by it self, or of them all as much as thou will. Also
take Frankencense, Sandaracha, wood of Paradise, of each a like quantity:
throw it on glowing coals, and receive the vapor or smoke.

The manner of making lies and sopes for the same, with which the head being
washed the brain is comforted, her moisture dried, and her overmuch cold
changed into warmth, for which purposes thou shall use these things following:
Take Roses, Seen leaves, Betonie, Marioram, Agaricke, of each one drag. steep
them in hot lie the space of four or five hours: others first boil them in
wine, and afterward mingle it with lie.

Take Mace three drag. Stechas, Marioram, of each one drag. blossoms of the
wild Vine, Roses of each two drag. Spica one drag. cut them all into small
pieces, put them into a little bag, and then steep them in the ley: this
comfort the head, brain and memory, and helps also the swimming or
giddiness of the head.

Also take Spica half an ounce, Lauander flowers, Roses, Marioram, Rosemarie,
roots of the blew flower deluce, of each two drag. cut them into pieces, and
being put into a bag, steep them in ly, and wash thy head with it: this
strengthens the brain, all the senses, and the memory very much.

Also take wild Mints, Nep, course Marioram, Hyssope, Bay leaves, of each sort
two M. Rosemarie blossoms, Stechas, Gold flowers of each half a M. and sees
them in ly: take also Marioram, Sage, Cammomill, Bay leaves, Stechas, of each a
M. lay them in steep in the waer of ly, as is aforesaid.

Washing bals for the cold pain of the head.
Here follows diverse sorts of washing bals very meet and necessary for the
cold, and humors of the head. Take Venice Soap, half a pound, bruise it and
stamp it in a warm mortar with a hot pestell, and make it somewhat moist
with Rosewater, or Lauander water, until it be like unto dowe, then beat one
ounce of Ireos roots, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamom, Cardamonie, Stechas,, of each
a drag. Roses, Basil, Rosemarie, Lauander blossoms, of each half a drag. all
dried and beaten to powder, and then mingle the same with the dowe of the Soap,
and take oil of Spikenard, and rubbing your hands therewithal, then make up
the bals.

Also prepare or dress the Soap in like sort as before is mentioned, and then
mingle therewithal these powders hereafter following, to wit, Lauander half
an ounce, Roses, Marioram, Basil, of each a quarter of an ounce, Ireos 3.
quarters of an ounce, Benzoin, Styrax Calamita, Stechas, of each a drag. Spike
a quarter of an ounce, and mingle them with Rose water. Then anoint the
temples of the head, and it will give a very sweet smell or fume, and comfort
the head and brain.

Also take of the foresaid Soap prepared in the like manner as before is
specified, two ounces, and mix therewithal a quarter of an ounce of Agaricke:
Ireos, Cloves, of each half a dragme, Camfire a scrup. Then make bals thereof
in what sort you desire them.

Also take Venice Soap four ounces, Ireos, Cloves, Betonie, of each three
dragm. Marioram, Macis, Galigan, Lignum Aloes, Ciperus, Calmus, Sandaracha, of
each a scrup-liquid Stirax a drag. and a half, Musk four grains, then
dress the Soap with Lauander water, as before is specified. Also heretofore in
Chap. 1.. 2. is mentioned, how the strong smell of the Soap may be taken away
and made very commodious and fit for use to diverse purposes.

Here is to be noted, that if the bals be for present use, then are the bags
herafter mentioned not needful: but for the bags, you are to take dry Betonie
a M. Borage, Melilot, Millet a little dried in a pan, of each half an ounce,
Rosemarie flowers, Stechas, of each a quarter of an ounce; make the bag so
great, as the place of the grief, and put the same therein, and lay it to the
place where the grief is. This following is stronger: Take dry Betonie, Rue,
of each half a M. Rosemarie blossoms, Stechas of each an ounce, Basil seed,
Rue, of each half an ounce: beat them in a mortar together, and put them in a
little bag, and lay them to the head. Millet scorched or dried a quarterne: the
like quantity of salt, and also as much Cammomill, put them in a little bag,
and lay them warm upon the head: this is also very good.

Also take Stechas, Cammomill, wild Mints, Marioram, Bay leaves, of each a
handful, Seen leaves, Cyprus, Citron shells, of each two drag. Cubebs, Nutmegs,
Cloves, of each a drag. Macis, Spike of India, Ciprus roots, Calmus, of each
two drag. beat these together in a mortar; then put the same into two little
bags: and if thou will have it warmer, then take Doves doung and Mustard
seed, of each three dragmes, Beuer cod, and Euphorbium of each a dragme.

Note also very specially, that neither Roses nor other stopping things be put
in the bags, neither are these plasters following, in any wise serviceable;
and although they be strong, yet do they but hinder the dividing of the matter.
Therefore you shall not use the bags in certain hours after you have washed
it with the Soap before mentioned.

A powder for the head: Take Nutmegs, Macis, Rosemarie, Cloves, Frankencense,
Marioram, Lauander, Stechas, of each a like quantity, beat it small, and rub
the head well therewithal upon the seame of the head, and then cover and keep
warm the head with a cap, that the smell of the powders may the longer remain.

Also take Betonie, Marioram, Stechas, Roses, of each a M. Sage, Rue, course
Marioram, of each half so much, Rosemarie two drag. Citron shells one ounce,
Bark of Frankencense, Myrrh, Frankincense, Mastix, Sandaracha, of each half
an ounce, Cloves half a drag. beat them all into powder. This is very good
for the moist and rheumaticke head, to dry it and to procure warmth.

Plasters and salues: Take Aloes, Penniroyall, Citron shells, wild Mints,
Sandaracha, Frankencense, of each half an ounce, oil of Roses one ounce,
Laudanum six ounces, beat these small in a warm mortar, with a warm
pestell, put thereunto six ounces of molten wax, the other being very small
beaten, then spread it upon leather, and cover it over with red farsnet: this
shall thou lay upon the head of the party grieved in the morning whilst he is
fasting: this dries very strongly, warmeth the head, and comfort the
brains.

Another: Take of the best Laudanum two ounces, Maces, five dragm. Millet that
is scorched or dried two drag. Turpentine and oil of Cammomil so much as shall
be needful for one plaster, and then use the same as before is mentioned.
Some take four ounces of Laudanum, and Horehound in the place of Mace.

This plaster following is very strong, and of great heat: Take Beuer cod,
Euphorbium Pepper, white Mustard seed, Styrax Calamita, Rue, Horehound, of
each a like quantity: this beat all together with wine until it be like
dowe, and thereof make cakes of a like weight, let them dry. When you will use
them, rub them with oil of Costus (otherwise Balsam) or Cammomill oil until
it be made fit for a plaster or a salve, then lay it upon the forehead: for it
is very good for any old or cold pain of the head, but lay it not unto the
forehead only, but also drop some into the ears, and it will be very warm,
and therefore I do not counsel you to take much thereof.

This is of special account: Treacle or Mithridate, with the juice of bruised
Mints, make it thick as pap, and then anoint the forehead therewithal in the
time of rest, and principally in Hemicrania, and where you find the head most
cold, there use it oftenest.

Also take the roots of wild Cucumbers, wormwood, of each two M. sees them
together with a soft fire in three ounces of water, and as much common oil,
until it be sodden to a third part. With this moisture rub the head till it be
wet, and of the rest make a plaster, and lay it to the place of the pain.

Also take of the usual plaster Apostolicon four ounces, make it soft with
the oil of Cammomill, and then rub the place of the pain therewithal.
Always understanding that the hair is to be first cut off very close.

Hereunto may also of the oil of Spikenard, of Costus, of Beuer cod, of
Cammomill, and Dil be used, of each a like quantity, and then stamping all the
foresaid herbs and roots with them.

Addition.
The herbs and simples that are used in a cold headache are these: Iris
Illirica, oil of the wild Olive, oil of Almonds, the seeds of the chaste
tree, bitter Almonds, Lana succida, water Mints, the juice of Iuie leaves,
Aloes, Mints, wild Time, Melilot, the leaves of Baccharis, Rue, Scammonie,

Housleeke, white Saunders, the decoction of Seen, Camfire, etc. Some of these
are used only inwardly, some only outwardly, and some also both ways, and
for that cause they are not to be used without great circumspection.

Of neesing for a cold and rheumaticke head.. 2.
MAny do advise to provoke neesing, for to cleanse the brain and head thereby:
but it is also to be doubted, that the same will rather distemper the head, so
that it must prouidently be dealt with, as shall presently hereafter be
expressed. Therefore it is also needful to speak somewhat of neesing, which
does men much good or ill.

Neesing, Sternutatie, is a motion of nature, or of the expulsive virtue to
drive out all that hinders the air from the brains. Or, neesing is a
special motion of the brains expelling superfluous moisture or matter, and
that through the help of the attracted air, which drives out the same
speedily thorough the mouth and nose.

The causes of neesing are sharp things, as Onions, Lillies, Hellebore,
Pepper, Mustardseeds, and such like in smelling, eating and drawing them into
the nose. To hold up the nostrils against the Sun, to tickle in them with
some sharp things. But for more safety this is mine advice, that Neesewort be
refrained as much as is possible, as also Pieretrum, Euphorbium, and such like
more, and principally by themselves alone. In like manner, although the wild
Cucumber does draw forcibly, yet notwithstanding it is a great deal too
sharp. But if it be found good advice to use neesing, then are these
compounded remedies hereafter following much safer and milder to cleanse the
head and brains: Take Marioram one quarter of an ounce, Nigella seeds,
Rosemary flowers, Neesing powders.
of each one dragme, Cloves two scruples; beat them small, and smell thereto.

Item take beaten Marioram one quarter of an ounce, Pieretrum one scrup. Ginger
one scru. white Hellebore nine grains, and beaten all small together.

Item take Pyretrum ten grains, Betonie a drag. Marioram one drag. and a
half, and beat them all together.

Item take Laudanum, Myrrh, Amanacum, white Hellebore, of each one drag.
Frankencense, Euphorbium, Coriander, Ginger, long Pepper, of each half a drag.
these beaten all to fine powder, it is very good for the cold murre.

Item take Pyretrum, black Hellebore, of each half an ounce, white Hellebore,
Beuer cod, of each two drag. Marioram half a drag. beat them to powder: of
this use but a little, and not very often; for it is very strong.

Oil of Spike being put into the nose, does provoke neesing. There may also be
drawn up into the nose two ounces of Marioram water, and afterward wash the
forehead and face warm therewith.

For what end neesing is commodious or hurtful, you shall perceive here and
there in this book.

Lotions for the feet. All Physicians do commend for sundry sicknesses, and
also for cold ach in the head, this lotion of the feet: Take Betonie, Roses,
Elderne flowers, Cammomill, Marioram and Sage, of each four handfuls: sees
them together, and every evening put the feet deep enough therein, and so
continue about half an hour therein: this may be kept good three days
together.

If so be that the patient cannot sleep he may use this three or four times a
week: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Violet leaves, of each one handful, water
Lillies, half a handful, Poppie heads broken in pieces one ounce: sees and
use them as before.

The order of diet for the cold pain of the head.. 3.
STrong wine is good, but not too much, to the end it do not disturb the head:
once in eight days he must bath and wash his head with the decoction of
Cammomill, Marioram, and Stechas: or he may use according to the importance of
the sickness, one of the foresaid lies or sopes: before meals is his head to be
rubbed with warm clothes, and after meats take a little Marmalade, thereby to
hinder the vapors of the stomach from ascending to the head, and provoking of
new pain.

Outward bruisings of the head.. 4.
ALl outward bruisings or wounds of the head, whereof is not only caused great
pain, but also great peril of life, do belong chiefly to Chirurgerie,
notwithstanding where we shall hereafter discourse of the Scull, somewhat shall
be spoken thereof.

What does convey the medicines toward the head.. 5.
WE have hitherto described many kinds of remedies and medicines that are
meet for the hot, cold, and other pains of the head: but because the laxatiue
and purging medicines through their own power do not expel all humors (for
which they be given) out of all members indifferently, without the addition of
such things as may convey their operation toward some certain member, the
which one desires to have them to purge: therefore we will discourse here
somewhat thereof. And that you may by example clearly understand the same, then
behold the Oxymel that shall immediately be described: it prepares or digesteth
flegmaticke humors indifferently as well in one member as in another. But if
so be you mix therewith Nutmegs, Pionie seeds, or Cubebs, then does it only
purge the head, and none other part of the body: and if you put thereto
Tamariscus and Caper roots, then does it purge out of the milt, and so forth
with all the rest. Now because we write here only of the head, these are the
principallest simples or herbs, that do conduct the medicines toward the
head; to wit, Nutmegs, Cubebs, and Pionie, Penniroyall, Marioram, Balsam wood
and seeds, Frankincense, Beuer cod, Laudanum, Melilot, the right Acorus,
Lignum Aloes, Myrrh, Chamedris, Squils, Nuces pinea, Spikenard, Gentian,
Hysope, Pepper and Sagapenum or Serapinum.

There are many things more here and there discovered in this book, which the
diligent reader shall find to be very meet for the headache.

Additions unto the pain of the head.
FOr the forementioned pain of the head there are certain things commemorated,
that are commodiously and much used, and yet are not discovered how they should
be prepared.

Thus, to the end the reader might be satisfied, we will here describe certain
of them, and begin with Oxymel.

Diverse kinds of Oxymel.. 6.
FIrst we will begin with that which at the Apothecaries is called Oxymel
simplex: for that it is made only of honey and vinegar: now for to make the
same, take clarified honey four ounces, power thereto two ounces of clear
water: sees the same together, and scum it, until all the water be sodden
away: put thereto two ounces of vinegar, let it sees together unto a sirupe.
This consumes all tough slime and thick humors, opens all obstructions,
cleanses the breast, and makes an easy breathing.

The second Oxymel is called at the Apothecaries Compositum or Diureticum. It
is made in this manner: Take Fennel roots, and roots of Smallage, of each
two ounces, the seeds of Parsley, of Butchers broom, of Sparage, of Smallage,
and of Fennel, of each an ounce: take out the core of the roots, chop them,
and sees them in a quart of water until they be mellow, afterward wring them
out through a cloth, and add to the decoction six ounces of sharp vinegar,
twelve ounces of cleansed honey, let them sees together unto a sirupe. This is
much stronger for all uses then the former: it does attenuate all tough slimes,
it drives them out of the members, opens the obstruction of the liver, of
the milt, and of the kidneys, it expels the urine and sweat.

The third Oxymel is made of Squils called Scyllinum, or at the Apothecaries
Squilliticum: for this, take vinegar of Squils which is described before in the
second Chapter,. 1. against the cold pain of the head, four ounces, clarified
honey six ounces, and sees it al together unto a sirupe.

The fourth is Oxymel Scyllinum compositum, the which is thus made: Take the
roots of Smallage; of Fennel, of each two ounces, the roots of Parsley, of
Butchers broom, of Sparage, the seeds of Smallage, and of Fennel, of each
half an ounce: sees them together in a quart of water until the roots be
mellow: unto this decoction add twelve ounces of vinegar of Squils, clarified
honey 18. ounces, and then sees it to a sirupe.

They are both very good to attenuate the tough slimes, to strengthen the
stomach, and to provoke urine: but the first is stronger to open all
obstructions, and is special good against all quotidian and quartaine agues.

Purging sirupe of Roses.. 7.
TAke a pound of red or damask Rose leaves, put them into a pot with a narrow
neck, power thereon about three times so much of hot clear water, let it
stand so 8. or 12. hours covered very close, afterward wring it hard out with
thy hand, strain the liquor clear through a cloth: then take again fresh
Roses as before, and power the strained liquor seething hot upon it, let it
stand as before: wring it out again, and do this afterward 8. or 12. times
together (the oftener the better) and it will be the stronger in purging.

Lastly, wey all that strained juice of Roses, and put half so much Sugar unto
it, and clarify it with the white of an egg, until it be very clear:
afterward let it sees to a sirupe. Some do stamp the Roses, that the virtue
might come out the better.

Others do make it after this manner, as follows: Take red or damask Rose
leaves two pound and a half, power thereon ten quarts of May deaw or clear
rain water made meetly hot: let them infuse together in a warm place a whole
day and a night stopped very close. The next day wring it out hard: make the
broth not seething, but only meetely hot: then power it again upon two pound
of fresh Rose leaves: let them stand and steep, as before. The third time take
one pound and a half of Roses; the fourth time one pound, and so the fifth and
sixth time: last of all, after the four last times, take each time half a
pound of Roses: afterward, the liquor being strained, put unto three parts of
it one part of Sugar: sees it well, clarifying it unto a sirupe. Of one of
these sirupes may be given to a full grown person three, four, or five ounces
at one time: unto a young child one ounce: unto one of eight or nine years
old, two ounces, and further after the same rate, according to the greatness
or smalnesse.

This sirupe does quench the thirst and heat in all hot agues, it does
strengthen the stomach and the hot liver, defends the heart from all venime
and stinch: therefore it is also good for the plague, and loses very gently.

It is also prepared with Rubarbe and other things, according to the opinion of
every Physician.

Barley water.. 8.
IT is ordained before, for the hot pain of the head, to give unto the sick
body Barley water for his daily drink, the which is prepared after diverse
manners, but is commonly prepared thus: Take unto a good deal of water one
ounce of peeled Barley, let it sees until it break. Some do steep it two or
three hours before in clear water. And albeit that such Barley water have
small force, yet it is better than bare water, when the patient is forbidden to
drink wine.

There are also other things more, according to the importance of the sick
person, put unto it, as Masticke, Barberies that do color it like unto wine.
In like manner are also herbs, roots, and all that one will, decocted
therein.

Manus Christi with Pearls.. 9.
THis cordial Sugar is very common, and is made thus: Take 12. ounces of the
whitest Sugar, sees it with Rose water like as is taught in our introduction,
afterward when it begins to be cold, stir an ounce of prepared Pearls
amongst it, and make Tabulates or Manus Christi of it. It is good for all
faintness, hot agues, heavy fantasies and imaginations.

The Apothecaries do commonly not take more then a dragme of Pearls upon a
pound of Sugar, because men will not go to the cost thereof.

Without Pearls the Apothecaries do call it Manus Christi simplex, they decoct
the Sugar with Rose water, without putting any thing else unto it. It is made
also with violet water, Cinnamom water, and howsoever that one will have them.

The third Chapter. The Hair of the Head.
EVen as we have discoursed of all kind of pains of the head, so we w^l now
begin certain other things of the same in particular, and of that which makes
show outwardly in the top of the head, to wit, the ha^^e, the which grows
there of it self, garnisheth the head, decketh and ^ouereth it. And although
the same hair (like as the nails also) has no other government but only the
growing and garnishing by nature: nevertheless it has that secret in it, that
through his color, his hardness, softness, finenesse, curling, evenness, and
other marks, it does sufficiently give knowledge how the brains which lie
under it are inclined; to wit, the cold, warmth, drith, moisture, as also their
mixed complexions, as cold and drith, warmth and moisture, whereby it may be
known what humor or moisture does most abound, or whether ones hair also will
quickly fall off or not. These weighty and other causes have planted by nature
in all men, specially in women, a carfulness to look unto, and maintain it:
the one with making it grow more or thicker than the other, to change the
color, to make it fall away, to keep it clean from all vermin, and to free
and clear it from all defaults. Because therefore that this is so greatly
esteemed, it is requisite to prosecute our attempted method, and to write also
somewhat thereof. And first of all, of those things which cause the hair to
grow: afterward, to take that away which hinders, or to draw or pluck it
out.

To cause the hair to grow, and to color it.. 1.
ALl they that desire to have their hair grow thick and apace, are to anoint
the place oftentimes with honey where they will have it grow: also to make a
ley of herbs (to wit, for young maidens and women) who bear the name thereof,
Gallitrichon, fair haired, Politrichon, much hair, Capillus Veneris: Venus
hair. And if any body have a bald patch: then take garden snails plucked out
of their houses, Horsleaches, Bees, Waspes, Salt, of each a like quantity:
powne them not too hard one amongst another, put them into a glassed pot that
is pitched beneath, and having a small hole, bury it the space of eight days
in warm horse dung, and receive the moisture that droppeth out in another
glass bound under it: and annoint therewith the baldness, rubbing well the
place first: wash the head with the decoction of urine, Wormwood, Southernwood,
and of Lineseede well parched: goats milk does likewise make the hair grow
fair. You shall also find more things hereafter in the description of the eye
brows, and of the beard.

Of the dying of the hair in general.. 2.
IF any desire to die the hair otherwise than it is grown by nature, then is
this generally to be observed: that he always before wash the hair with ley
made of vine stocks, wherein a piece of Alum is dissolved: for the Alum
makes a preparatiue for to receive all colors, as is well known to all Dyers.

Here do now follow certain sorts of colors.

Amongst Dutchmen there is no color more highly commended then the gold color
or yellow, like as it was much esteemed of the Romans: so that sometimes they
dyed their beards and hair with gold: but these things following are also meet
for this purpose.

Yellow hair.
Take ashes of the Vine sticks, eight ounces, of Barley straw two handfuls, of
Licorice two ounces, sees them together in a great quart of water; afterward
let it settle, and wash the head with this ley, and let it dry of it self.

Item take shaven Beechen wood, Gold flower, Venus or maiden hair, of each one
handful, Licorice half an ounce, Saffron one scrup. let this mollify in ley,
wash the head, and let it dry of it self: also as often as one combeth him,
he must wet the comb therein.

Item take Willow leaves, white beaten Mustard seed, Consolida Saracenica,
broad Plantain, Water Cresses, Radishes, white Hellebore, Bryonie, Onions, of
each half an ounce: cut them all in pieces, and let them sees al together a
while in ley, temper one ounce of Honey amongst it, and then let it stand
until the herbs do putrify: afterward put more fresh herbs therein, and
sees them with as much honey as there is of the decoction, until it be
thick, and annoint the place where you desire to have the hair grow: but
look well to it that you touch no other hair with it, for it would be
disordered thereby, but I advise no man to use much of this salve, for it is
hurtful for the head.

Item in March take Poplar buds and sees them with ley; take also powned
Colewoort seed, temper it with the oil of Walnuts like to a salve, and
annoint the head therewith.

Or take nettle roots, horse Radish, the gum of the Birch, make it hot upon
the fire with the ley, and wash the head therewith. Juniper oil anointed
thereupon after washing, will easily make yellow hair to grow: but note that
this oil is hot. This should also the fruit of the Beechen tree do, being
laid in ley.

Black hair.
Black hair: Some that by nature have black hair, do diligently seek to
augment that color: others will cloak therewith the misshapen hair, many will
die gray hairs therewith, which to effect, they anoint it with the juice of
Sage.

Burn Hasell nuts, as many as you please, in a luted pot, stamp them to
powder, then make them unto a salve with the tallow of a Bear or Goat: this
does not only die black, but makes also the hair to grow.

Item take beaten Gal nuts six ounces, sees them in nine ounces of Sallet
oil, as long as one would sees an egg hard: afterward wring them out, mix
amongst it pounded Priuet, burnt Vitriol, Salt gem, of each one quarter of an
ounce: let it sees a good while together, having washed the hair with the
decoction of Blites and Elderne flowers, then make it fat with the foresaid
oil.

Item take the green shales of Walnuts, stamp them and sees them, anoint the
hair with it, and it will be as black as Pitch. For this also helps Cipers
nuts, Bean straw, burnt shales of Hasell nuts, peeles of Pomegranates,
vnsleckt Lime, Priuet, and oil of Nuts.

For to make curled hair, take Mallows laid in ley; if one would die his hair
gray, Curled hair.
then make ashes of the innermost bark of Iuie, and wash you oftentimes
therewith, or anoint your hair with Badgers grease.

To hinder Gray Hairs.. 3.
TO be gray, is only proper to man's head, which comes through the abatement
of the natural warmth, or thorough the ryoting life, whereby Flegma is
increased, and it is sometimes also caused as well thorough unnatural heat as
cold: but if any be gray before his time, that comes by use of much fruit
and fish: but to utter the truth, the gray hairs are none other then an
Ensign or banner for us, that death planteth upon our heads, signifying that
it will shortly have victory over us. But as there be many that would hide
their age, and would rather be thought young men, them old fools; So has it
been also found out, not how to turn away gray hairs, but how to prevent the
same, whereof we will here write somewhat.

The chiefest is the daily purging of phlegm, and specially with vomits and
clisters, for which are fit Pilulae Cochiae, Trifera Saracenica, these pills
following.

Take Coloquint, Turbith, Aloe, of each a dragme, Fennel seed, Annis seeds,
Persley seed, black prepared Hellebore and Pepper, of each half a dragme,
Diagridion two scrup. make thereof a mass with the juice of Wormwood, take a
dragme thereof at the most at one time, for they be strong: good heed is to be
taken in this purging, that age for gray hairs be not thereby taken away.

The ancient Physicians do describe many things for preventing gray hairs,
what is to be eaten, drunk, and refrained: also what is to be used a whole
year in youth, and that one must eat snailes: so that it grieueth me to enter
into so needless a matter (when one would stay and prevent the course of
nature) I will therefore be brief. Anoint thy head with the oil of Beuer cod,
with the oil of a Bear, fresh oil of Roses, or oil of Mustard seed: all
which are meet to prevent gray hair: or take the spleen of an old dog, and
rub the hair therewith. Also the oil of Priuet does prevent gray hair.

Item take Tassell, sees it in ley and use it daily: steep in the ley Myrtle
leaves, Cipers nuts, Juniper wood cut, the bark of Fir-wood with the leaves,
Gall nuts, and such like.

To take away hair.. 4.
TAke a pint of wine, drown twenty green frogs therein, or as many as can be
drowned therein, then set the pot forty days in the warm Sun: afterward
strain it hard through a cloth, anoint the place therewith where you will take
away the hair.

Make the place oftentimes moist with the juice of yellow Lillies, which is
wild Flower deluce. Take Ants eggs and rub the place therewith, wherein you
would have the hair taken away, it will fall off and grow no more again. Item
anoint the hair place with the juice of Sloes, and it will make the hairie
place bald and smooth.

Will you pluck out hair without breaking the skin? To pluck out hair.
Then take six ounces of Turpentine set it on the fire in a new pot, and let it
sees somewhat; then power it into a pan full of cold water, and stir it
continually about with a wooden stick until it run together. Then power
therein other fresh water, and pluck it with your fingers well from another,
whereby it may be well washed; and do this so long, until it wax fair and
white; afterward temper amongst it one ounce of beaten Masticke in the
foresaid pot, sees it all together as before, and wash it also afterward as
before is done, and keep it always covered with water, and when you will use
it power out the water: let it melt with the fire, spread it on a cloth, and
lay it no where but on the place whence you would have the hair drawn out,
and when it is cold (as it will be quickly) pull off the plaster with
violence. Then will the skin remain very white and bare of hair, then have a
piece of fresh larde ready, and therewith annoint the place, and then wipe it
by and by away with a cloth: then will the skin be bald and smooth.

Of diverse defaults of the hair.. 5.
THe cunning and expert Physicians do reckon nine kinds of defaults of the
hair: Contorsio, Decoloratio, Quassatio, Fractio, Atrophia, Canities,
Alopecia, De fluxio and Ophiasis. The first, Contorsio, is called a curling or
intangling of the hair. The second, Decoloratio, a deformity of the color.
The third, Quassatio, which is a splitting or cleaving asunder of the hair.
The fourth, Fractio, a short breaking away of the hair, that it snappeth
asunder. The fifth is, Atrophia, that is as much as a drying away or consuming
of the hair for lack of food. The sixth is Canities, when the hair before
his due time becomes gray or white. The seventh is Alopecia or Arca, which is
baldness or falling off of the hair. The eight is Defluxio, which is also a
falling away of the hair, like as in them who lost their natural heat, or
recover after a long continued sickness. The last is Ophiasis, which has her
name of the snake: it is also a changing of color not unlike to the other; for
it is parti-colouring like to a snake.

Of baldness and falling off of the hair.. 6.
BAldnes and falling away of the hair is three fold: as the falling off of the
hair of the head, of the eye brows, and of the beard. Of the two last we will
discourse in their place: here we will only speak of the first falling away
of the hair. The causes of the same are inflamed moistures, whereby the hair
before was fed: which thorough inflammation thereof is taken away, as already
has bin rehearsed: for whenever that it wants sustenance, the hair must
of necessity dry away, and fall off with his roots, as may be seen in them
that have hot brains, and become bald betimes: and contrariwise women,
children, and they that be gelded very seldom. Thus to speak of the means:
the first proof is, whether the hairs may be restored or not, to rub the bald
place: and if it be not forthwith red, then is there no hope at hand: but if
it wax red, then it is a sign that there is still some good blood, and
therefore good hope also. And to come unto it, first must good order of diet be
observed, to refrain strong wine, Borage, rear eggs, and all that is light of
digesture is commodious for him, and to drink white, clear, and small wine,
that is sweetish. Bathing and rubbing is very meet for this disease; if the
person be full of blood, open ye head vein, or that on the nose, or the vein
behind the ears, and also purge, if it be needful, of whatsoever occasion it
be that the falling away of the hair happens. These means following are
always convenient for it: Take Euphorbium, burnt Hasill nut shells, burnt
Chestnut shells, Cresses seeds, Indie Spica, Verbascum, of each one drag. bitter
almonds with their pills burnt, one quarter of an ounce; make salve thereof with
vine ^uict, oil of Radishes or Barberies.

Item take Euphorbium, wild Rue, Boreas, Mustard seed, Mugwoort, of each a like
much; beat them all together and make thereof a salve with the juice of Onions:
let the head be rubbed until it be red, and then anointed therewith. Of such
like remedies are many more described by the ancient Physicians: but omitting
them, ye have some here that are certain and common.

Take Pigeons dung, burn it to ashes, then power ley upon it, and let him be
washed therewith.

Or Hasell nuts with the shells beaten small, and tempered with Bears grease,
is very good.

Oil of eggs does defend and keep the falling out, and makes the hair for to
grow again where it is fallen away. Forasmuch as the oil of eggs is so good
for this, and for many other things more, it is needful to teach here how to
make the same.

The oil of Eggs and his virtue. Take hard sodden yolks of eggs as many as you
will, Oil of Eg^.
break them in pieces, and parch them in a pan until they wax ruddy, then
shall you see oil run out: then without ceasing must you stir them about, and
when they be thoroughly parched, press them hard through a woollen cloth.

It is many times approved and found, that this oil does not only cause the
hair that is fallen off to grow again, but does prevent and stay the hair
from falling. It also heals, and causes all other itches and sores to heal.

Further: Take well salted Barley bread, burn it to powder, and temper it with
Bears grease, and anoint your head therewith.

Item slake a glowing steel in the ly wherewith you will wash you: use it
often without any thing else therein.

Take Myrtle seeds and the leaves: sees them in water, and wash the head
therewith.

All that is taught hereafter against the falling off of the hair in the
eybrowes and the beard, is also meet for this purpose.

Of the scales of the head, of the beard, and eyebrowes.. 7.
THe Latinists do call the scales of the head Furfures, which is bran, well
known of all people, and are very common in all men's heads. They grow there
through a hot complexion, and when they abound much and above custom, then
were they wont to be messengers of leprosy. They that have them so excessive,
do get them through a licentious life, and surfeiting in eating and drinking,
through incontinencie, strong wine, much use of garlic, onions and mustard,
whereby the blood is burnt to ashes.

For this must one begin with purging, like as in all dry itches shall be
expressed. But if the person have much blood, then is he to be let blood; if
not, then are to be used neesing powders, gargarismes, and boxing cups are to
be set on the shoulders and neck, and afterward these things: Sees Mallows
or Venus hair in water, wash therewith the head and face, and always rub well
the head; or boil fennel seed, Licorice, Fleawort, Lupins, Hollihocke roots,
take out the muscilage as shall be taught hereafter, and temper them with the
juice of Melons. Item take Nuttree wood, or Nut shells burnt to ashes, put them
in the ly and wash you therewith. Item take Charuill, Southernwood, make a lie
thereof with a little vinegar. Item burn Hay flowers to ashes, and pour ly
upon it. Item take Elecampane roots, and infuse them a good while in ly.

Or take Storkes bill, let it sees in water, and foment well the scales
therewith, that they be well frothed, and afterward lay the herbs on the top
of it, and they will wear away.

Will you yet have stronger things? then take the gall of a Bull, Coloquint,
Sal Alcali Boras, of each one drag. Gals, pills of Pomegranates and their
blossoms, of each one scrup. and temper them together.

Item take narrow Plantaine, Henbane seeds, and salt, of each a little, sees
them in water and rub the scales therewith: the same also does Aqua vitae with
Brimstone amongst it.

Heretofore in the second chapter and. 1. you have a bag for ly, which
begins, Take Spica etc. you may use the same also for the scales, and put
thereto two ounces of Orange peels, whereof some of the white is cut away.

For to draw the muscilage out of the seeds and roots, the Apothecaries do
call the slime drawn out of all seeds and roots Muscilagines; it is much used
in this matter, and is thus prepared.

Take roots and seeds, chop and stamp each according to the quality, How to
make the slime or muscilage of seeds and root.
sees them until the liquor be very slimy and muscilaginous: this being done,
pour it al together into a long bag that is piked beneath, and bind it hard to
a staff; afterward take two little boordes and fasten the said bag between
them, wring it hard from above downwards, then runs the slime or muscilage
out of it, receive it in a clean porrenger; and after this fashion wring or
press out all the slime that will come forth.

For to drive away Lice and Vermin.. 8.
Lice.
THis loathsome and (especially to children) troublesome worm, has his most
abode in the foresaid hair of the head, and they do grow through moisture of
the flesh, or (to speak properly) of a gross and moist vapor that fumeth out
at the pores, and through natural warmth becomes outwardly a Louse, and
receives also a vital spirit, and is altered into a little worm with six
feet, increasing and seeking their meat in the place of their generation:
therefore are children and women more plagued then men that are dry by nature,
and be much less hurtful to young children then to full grown persons, yet
they have this commodity thereby, that they that have most lice be wholly freed
from the headache.

Their cause.
The cause whence they are engendered, may be overmuch eating and small
digesture, or eating of meats that be very moist, as diverse fruits, and
especially figs and chestnuts: also overmuch carnal copulation, unclean
clothes, and such as are worn ouerlong.

Their remedies.
Now that one may be rid of this vermin, anoint the head with the broth of Salt
fish, with the juice of Alehoofe, the juice of Fumitory mixed with Vinegar: take
Gentian and sees it in ly, and wash the head therewith.

Take Bay berries, or (if you have them not) the oil of Bay, Vinegar, powned
Bay berries, burnt Hearts horn, sees them together in water or ly, and wash
the head therewith.

Salues. Take half a pound of Barrowes grease, mix and temper amongst it one
ounce of Quicksiluer, and one ounce of the oil of Bay, Licebane and white
Hellebore, of each half an ounce, Salgem one dragme, and a little vinegar:
temper them all together, and therewith anoint the head, and put a kercher on
the head, and in the morning wash the head with lie.

Another. Take Barrowes grease half a pound, beaten Liver four ounces, Wolves
bane, and white Hellebore roots, of each half an ounce, oil of Bay one
ounce, temper amongst it one ounce and a half of quicksiluer so well that one
cannot see it, salt one drag. use a little thereof, for it is strong.

Item take unprepared Coriander, sees it in water, wash therewith the head,
and all places where there are any lice, and wash the clothes in like manner, it
drives away lice and fleas: you may also try the same with Coriander leaves.

Crab-lice.
Against Crab-lice you are to use all the former things. They grow of a stinking
matter, that nature expels through the hairy skin, as in the eybrowes, beard
and priuities: they are most plagued with them that eat many kinds of meats,
use small exercises, and much bathing. For to consume this unclean matter, he
is to be purged with Pillulae Cochiae, and to use oftentimes gargarismes with
the sirupe of vinegar, and a little mustard seed, and to wash the place with
Allume water, and salt water, or that wherein Stauesacre is decocted.

Iem take Stauesacre and Allume, of each one drag. beat them together, temper
it with honey, and anoint therewith: Others do take Salarmoniac, Aloe and
Borras amongst it, and in steed of honey, vinegar of Squils: also the white of a
roasted egg is commended for it, wrapped up in a cloth, and held as hot upon the
place as may be suffered. This being done three or four times, they will fall
away.

Lice in childrens feet.
Sometime young children have also lice growing in their feet: for them take new
laid hen eggs, let them be sodden hard, cut the white in pieces in the breadth;
beat then the yolks, and with fine linen rags lay it on the feet, and then
the white upon it; and so being well bound certain hours, the lice will
creep to the white of the egg.

The Lousy evil, Phthiriasis, a miserable sickness.. 9.
EVen as we have written of the Lice, so we will adioyne thereto the Lousy
evil, which the Grecians do call Phthiriasis. This is a wonderful and terrible
sickness, that a man should be eaten up with such baggage worms, and so bereft
of his life. It happens that these worms do breed of moisture of a man's flesh,
and begin commonly in the eybrowes, and in some scabs, or among some scurfe
therein when they do break of themselves or are opened. Then do lice creep
out, and so by little and little out of the whole body, with such danger, that
very skillful Physicians have enough to do therewith, and yet nevertheless are
these medicines following ordained for the same: Take the juice of Fumitory,
Borage, Germander, of each two ounces, Mirobalam, Chebuli, Indi, Citrini, of
each four scrup. black pepared Hellebore one quarter of an ounce, prepared
Agarick half an ounce, Aloe three quarters of an ounce, Epithymum, Seen leaves,
roots of Polipody, of each one ounce: powne all that is to be powned, and
temper them with the juice; if it be too soft, let it dry, and form a lump or
mass, thereof take one drag, and make si^e pills of it, of the which you are to
take twice or thrice every week, two at one time, an hour before supper.

Prepare this ly ensuing: Take Aristology, Swines bread, of each half an ounce,
of Gentian, Rhapontica, of each three drag. Centory one quarter of an ounce,
sees these things in ly, and wash therewith.

Item take Ireos half a ounce, Squils one ounce, Centory half an ounce,
Myrtle seed one ounce, Cloves three quarters of an ounce, bitter Almonds four
ounces, Vinegar, as much as is needful: let them sees together stopped well in
a glass in water by a soft fire about the space of four hours: afterward
wring it out well, and with this oil anoint the pushes or scabs whence the
lice do issue and breed.

A salve. Take Juniper berries powned well, one ounce, of sallet oil three
ounces, of white wine one ounce and a half: sees them together til the wine
be consumed, afterward wring it out; then take two ounces of Barrowes grease,
Elecampane roots roasted under the ashes, one ounce and a half, Litharge of
gold one ounce, prepared Quicksiluer one ounce and a half, temper them and
anoint the scabs therewith, but beware of the eyelids that you do not anoint
them therewith.

In this lousie evil is commanded to mortify the Quicksiluer as hereafter
follows: How to prepare and mortify Quicksiluer.
take wild Fern and the roots three M. Limons and Oranges cut in pieces, of
each three drag. sees them in water until the third part be consumed:
afterward strain it through a clean cloth, and temper the quicksiluer well
amongst it. There are other means more to kill the quicksiluer, like as has
been showed in the other salues for Lice.

Of the bad sore, Scurfe or Scall of the head, and such like.. 10.
AS through the unnatural moisture of the head Lice do grow: so does there
come thereof bad sores or scals of the head, as is seen in children which are
full of moisture. And although these scabs are for the most part always an
expulsion of nature, whereby children are cleared from other accidents and
noisome diseases, for which cause they ought rather to be provoked then healed:
nevertheless heed must be taken that this breaking out come not to grow old,
and to be changed into the bad sore or scall, the which is not to be helped in
people of years, nor yet in young children, therefore will we here write
somewhat thereof.

Of a Scald head.
THis is a detestable disease, to wit, the soreness or scals of the head with
scurfe, spoil and falling off of the hair, with much itch, stench, and
loathsome mishape or ilfauorednesse: the one sort are dry, the other are moist;
nevertheless all are to be cured after one manner.

At the first does this bad sore appear small and little: but if they be not
quickly looked unto, then runs it forthwith from the one side of the head to
the other, until the whole head be full: the causes are dry burnt humors, or
moisture and putrified blood.

If it come only of Phlegma, then yields it moisture, whereof we will make
further mention.

If it be dry and old, then do all the learned conclude upon it that it is
incurable; and although it should heal in continuance of time, and through
much advise, and with trouble, nevertheless must not one cease therefore. And to
this end are these things following acknowledged to be good for the same.

First it is needful to begin the cure with a good order of diet, wherein
nevertheless there is no certain order to be made, because that this disease
is incident to young children, albeit sometimes also to people in years, wherein
great difference is to be made. But generally to eschew all things which makes
heavy, melancholic and flegmatike blood, whereof are many instructions given
in many places of this book. First of all, a full grown man must always apply
himself as hereafter follows.

Above all he must beware of strong and sharp wines, and (as is said) from all
melancholic meat, as cheese, coleworts, salt flesh, and such like, and must
rather use them that be light of digestion, and make good blood, as fowls that
haunt high grounds, rere eggs, Borage, sweet fish of fresh waters. He must also
oftentimes purge, according as the person is, and as the sores be great and
noisome.

If a man's age will permit it, and the the patient be abounding in blood, which
may be perceived by the greatness of the veins, it is advised to open the
head veins in both arms, likewise the veins in the forehead, and behind the
ears. Nevertheless some do suppose that the two last mentioned veins are not
often to be opened. To the end one might recover hair, for which this blood is
requisite, upon the places where it is red and raised, and shows bloody, are
horse-leaches and boxing cups to be set, and plasters to be applied that do
raise blisters, whereof shall be more spoken in time. If there be any disease
where hair grows, there must it be shorn off twice a week, and always
before there be laid any salve upon it, the hair must be clean shorn away,
and be also well rubbed with course linen, and afterward anoint it over with
the juice of onions or of radishes. These are now the beginnings of the cure.

First of all must the gross burned moisture be attenuated and prepared for
expulsion, the which is to be effected with Oxymel of Squils called Compositum,
and is described in the second Chapter,. 6. for which also does serve the
sirupe of Fumitory. The melancholic and flegmatike humors are to be purged
with the pills Cochiae; and if one have strong folks in hand, he may use
thereunto Epithymum, Coloquint, and prepared Hellebore: yet a man is always to
be advised herein by a learned Physician. And for example in a dry scall: Take
prepared black Hellebore one drag. Seen leaves, Epithymum, of each one drag.
Agaricus one drag. and a half, Mastick one drag. Aloe half an ounce, make pills
thereof with the iuce of Smallage, and give thereof one dragme at one time.

But if the scall be moist, then purge with these pills following: Take Cochiae
one drag. and a half, Epithymum half a drag. make pills thereof for to use at
two times: or take Agaricus, Coloquint, and Mastick of each one drag. Aloe
half an ounce, temper them all together with the juice of Garlic take one
drag. at once. Mirobalans, Chebuli tempered with Epithymu^ and Seen leaves are
also meet for this.

Take of these remedies, of which we shall write against both sorts of these
scals, and begin first with the least.

Fumitory, after what sort soever it be taken, does much cleanse the blood,
therefore it is to be used for this disease. Also wash the head with wormwood
wine, for that it dries the moisture, and specially heals the scals, with
the white scall or scurfe.

Anoint the scals with oil of white Lillies mixed together with the oil of
Cammomill.

Take the yolks of eggs, fry them well in swines grease, and put unto it as much
Tupentine, let them melt together, they dry very gently.

Take oil of Roses, Juniper oil, of each half an ounce, quick brimstone,
Pigeons dung, Verdigrease, of each 3. drag. a little wax, melt them together, it
is very certain, and healing all scals.

Take stamped Lupins, temper them in vinegar with Barrowes grease.

Take oil of Bay and Oatmeale, of each a like much, Basil seed, one quarter of
either of them, anoint the head, and lay leaves of this herb upon it. But it
is too mild for the scall, and besides the Basil seed is hurtful to the head.

Take two handfuls of Sage, beat them small, temper them with salt, hogs grease
and vinegar: let it sees well, and anoint therewith the scald head every
other day. Upon the day between both, it is very good to wash the head with
the decoction of Mallows and Dock roots.

This salve is certain, and approved many times: Take butter which is burnt
black, Soote out of the chimney, and salt, of each a like much: stir them both
well amongst the butter, until the butter be stiff, and therewith anoint the
scals. And if it be not needful every day, then about the third day wash the
head with a small ley, and do this as often as is needful; when the scurfe
falls away, anoint the red place with this salve. Also this remedy following
is much in use: take pure turpentine two ounces, and wash it well with clear
water, fresh butter one ounce washed well, half an ounce of small bruised salt,
one Orange beaten all to pieces and wroong out hard, the yolks of three new
laid eggs, oil of Roses half an ounce; temper them all together by a small
fire. This is a certain salve, it may be used for all itches and scabs.

This salve following is exceeding sharp, and therefore it is not to be used
but at great need, and for the most venomous scabs of the head.

Take two ounces and a half of Barrowes grease, oil of Bay, Wax, powned
Frankincense of each an ounce, salt one quarter of an ounce, Quicksiluer
mortified three dragmes: first melt the wax, oil of Bay and grease by a small
fire, and put one ounce of the juice of Plantaine and Fumitory with it, let
them boil till the juices be consumed; then take it from the fire and temper
with it the Frankincense and Quicksiluer, and stir it so long until you see no
more Quicksiluer; it is then prepared: and you are to anoint this salve only
upon the scall, and if you mix half an ounce of Mastix with it, it would make
it the better.

Some have another manner to heal the scall of the head, and do first thus:
first they cause the head to be shaven bald, afterward they anoint it the
space of three days with oil of nuts, oil of Palma Christi seeds, and oil
of Cammomill tempered together.

The fourth day do they let the head to be pricked in diverse places, that it
may bleed: afterward they let it be washed with the decoction of Fumitory,
Dock roots, and of Cammomill; and afterward they put into the same decoction
Argall Squils, or Garlic; they sees it all together, and forthwith do rub the
head therewith, and dry it with hot clothes: and this do they twice or thrice a
day for the space of three days. The fourth day they wash it again with the
former decoction, and then shave off all the hair: if the skin be not yet
clean, use rubbing again with the Argal, and continue it so long until the
skin be through clean, then anoint the head with the salve following. If you
have a woman to cure, then take a woman's hair; if you have a man, then take a
man's hair, burn it in a pot of ashes, take thereof an ounce, burnt hazle nuts
one ounce and a half, the dregs of sallet oil four ounces, clarified honey
three ounces, Myrrh one ounce and a half, Aloe half an ounce, Saffron three
dragmes; temper them together unto a salve. This preserves the skin, and
permits not the moisture to putrify under it, but makes the hair to grow.
But if it happen that through this or any other salues the skin is distempered,
then must it be used no further, but with these decoctions following (which are
much commended) it is to be washed, to wit, with the decoction of Willow leaves
and Woodbind, for which these also are more requisite, Blites, Fumitory, wild
Time Dock roots, Sorell, Storks bill, all together, or which one can get,
decocted or bathed therewith.

This following is a very good salve, not only for the scals of the head, but
also for all other scabs and scurfs, itch, falling off of the hair, nits and
lice.

Take Gals, red Arsnick, Aristology, of each 3. drag. Hemlock seeds one quarter
of an ounce, foot of a chimny, brimstone, bitter Almonds, Coloquint, Caper
roots, fig leaves, Elmtree leaves, Verdigrease, Plume Allume, Sieff memithae
plain Coegal, Myrrh, Aloe, frankincense and pitch of each one drag. and a
half, stamp all that is to be stamped, and temper it with vinegar, set it
eight days or more in the sun until it be well tempered, and then use it.

In like manner is this highly commended, although the scall had continued many
years.

The black and white Hellebore, Brimstone viue, Vitrioll, Gold litharge,
vnslekt Lime, Shoomakers blacking, Aloe, Gals, soot of the chimny, Woad ashes,
of each half an ounce, mortified Quicksiluer, Verdigrease, of each one quarter
of an ounce, stamp all that is to be stamped. Further, take the juice of
Borage, Scabiose, Fumitory, Dock roots, of each two ounces, mix them all
together with three ounces of old dregs of sallet oil and as much vinegar: let
this sees upon a mild fire half an hour, and then temper the other things
amongst it, and put an ounce of molten Turpentine amongst it, Wax as much as is
needful for to make a salve. This is marvelous much commended for all scurfe
and diseases of the skin.

A sharp ley. The ancient Physicians will make a clean head with sharp ley: but
I cannot advise, especially if one will often use the same.

Take a pound of Argall beaten small, and bind it in a cloth, power thereon a
pint of water, and let it lie so the space of half an hour; afterward lay
cloth and all in the fire, and so burn it three hours long, then beat it
again, and bind it up as before, and burn it two hours more, beat it to
powder and put it in an Hippocras bag, pour the foresaid water upon it, let it
run through six or eight times, and make a ley thereof: it dries
vehemently, and has almost the sharpness of blew Tartary.

Of the plucking away of the scall.
MAke nine caps of blew cloth or blew linen, as big as the head is scallie,
anoint it inwardly with molten pitch and rosin, and put it upon the shaven
head, and so leave it thereon three days: afterward pluck it off by force,
and it will take away with it the hair and all the scurfe. But if there
remain any hairs in it, then pluck them out with small mullets, and then
wash the head with water (like as is said) wherein is decocted Fumitorie and
Docke roots, etc. And when it is dry, then set another cappe upon it: do as
before, and so until nine times, afterward use one of the foresaid salues.

Of the skin of the head.. 11.
FOrasmuch as the foresaid scall hangs most on the skin of the head, and the
foresaid skin is not only fastened to the head, but also to the whole body,
covering it as with a clothing, and is laid under the hair as his ground:
therefore are we somewhat admonished here, and afterward occasioned once
again to write thereof in the first part.

The skin which covers the head, is not of one kind of nature: for this
whence the hair grows is hard, dry and thick: the skin of the forehead,
as much as it is without hair, has her free motion: that which is under the
eye cannot be separated but with great trouble, and has no motion, like that
of the forehead. The skin of the lips is a mixture of the skin of the
muscles, so that they may be called with both the names. Thus much may suffice
at this present time.

The fourth Chapter. Of the Scull of the head.
BY this name we will not only have Cranium, but also all the uppermost bones
of the head to be understood, whereof there be seven commonly told, the which
through five Suturas, which is sewings or conioining, very naturally are in
each other knit together. But for the same one may look into the Anatomicos:
concerning this our purpose, the head is parted into six parts, whereof the
first is Frons, the forehead, which is beginning from the eyebrows till there
where the hair begins on both sides even unto the ears, it is but one
proper bone called by the Chirurgians and other mo Coronalis, like as men do
use to wear on this place of the head the garland. The second is fast by it
covered with hair, they call it Sinciput, it is with us the former part, and
has two bones which we call Parietalia, the side bones: they touch both of
them the future that passes over the middle of the head, are thick bored
through with small holes and weak. The third do they call Occiput, the hinder
part of the head, the neck is a great strong bone with a great hole, where the
first joint Vertebra of the backbone has his winding about. The fourth is
Vertex, the crown, the height and middle, from which, as from a point or
circle, the hair does spread abroad it self round about, but that which is
between both the ears and eyes be called Tempora, with us the temples.

Lastly, is all that begins under the forehead and the eyebrows unto the
end of the chin, as eyes, ears, nose, mouth, called Facies, that is, the face.
These are now the outward parts of the head, which do also comprehend the
bones, of which hereafter particularly mention shall be made.

As much as then concerns the scull, that is outwardly after diverse manner of
means bruised and perished, as through stripes, fractures, wounds, and such
like, which accidents do specially appertain unto Chirurgions, nevertheless
we are minded to discourse somewhat thereof. And this for a beginning.

Of the compression of the skull in young children.. 1.
IT comes to pass otherwhiles that newborn children have their skuls
doubled one over another or compressed; for which lay this plaster upon it:
Take Lodestone, Pumice stone, salt, of each a like much, bruised small, and
make with honey a plaster thereof.

Of the fracture of the skull.. 2.
WHen it is time after the first dressing to look to the wound of the head,
then take off the tow, cover the wound with a fine linen cloth made wet in
this Aqua vitae following: Take Aqua vitae made only of Wine one ounce,
wherein put powned Aloe and Myrrh of each one dragme, Masticke half a dragme,
stop it fast; then strew of the powder which is powned together of the three
things upon the wet cloth, cover it with another cloth, and anoint the wound
round about with oil of roses, cover the head gently with a linen cap or
kercher.

Item take woman's milk that gives suck to a boy, wet a piece of silk therein
and cover the wound therewith, afterward take the well brayed white of an eg,
put powned Frankincense unto it, spread it on a cloth and lay it over the wound
above upon the first cloth which is made wet in the woman's milk, and let it
lie so three days: if the brains be quiet, then is it a good sign of life:
afterward dress him with the black plaster or salve that shall hereafter
follow: but if the wound stanch not bleeding, then is this powder following
marvelous good; Take Frankincense two dragmes, Aloe one dragme, and therewith
strew the bleeding wound.

A water. Take Rosemary with the flowers, Sage, Betonie, of each one M. steep
them 24. hours in good wine and distill it, put thereto Myrrh half an ounce,
Aloe one ounce, Saffron ten grains, Sarcocolla, Frankincense of each one drag.
This you are to keep in a fast closed glass until you have need to use it.

After that the wound is dressed, and that it has not bled much, some do
advise that the head vein is to be opened, and that is very truly advised,
that for all such wounds the head vein once at the least should be opened, and
the patient purged: for it happens oftentimes that the pain of the head,
impostumation, or other mischances may thereby be hindered and prevented.

But to return again to the Surgery. It happens oftentimes that there
befalls with it pain of the throat and of the almonds, for which is meet
this gargarisme.

Take Masticke, Frankincense, of each one drag. Plantaine, the juice of Sloes,
Acorne cups, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice an ounce, Pieretrum,
Pomegranate pills, of each one quarter of an ounce: sees them together in a
quart of sower red wine until the third part be sodden away, put thereto
prepared Bolus Armenus half an ounce, burnt Allume one ounce and a half. Lay
this plaster following then upon it to heal it withal: Take oil of Roses
eight ounces, oil of Masticke one ounce, sheep and calves sewet of each
twelve ounces, silver litharge bruised small two ounces, red lead one ounce,
and a pint of wine; then let this boil softly until it be brown or black:
then put thereto four ounces of Turpentine, Masticke two ounces, Gummi Elenij
half an ounce, white wax as much as is needful for to make a plaster. This
plaster is especial good to cure a wound in the head, although one used naught
else, yet is the wound oftentimes to be washed with warm water: and if it were
wholly impostumated, then in stead of water use wine, wherein Myrtle seeds and
blossoms of Pomegranates with a little Allume has decocted.

Another plaster, which is also commended for good, and to have bin approved.
Take Gummi Elenij one ounce and a half, white rosin two ounces, Wax two or
three ounces, oil of Roses two ounces and a half, Ammoniack one ounce,
Turpentine one ounce and a half, make a plaster or salve of it: some add Rye
meal unto it: others black Bean meal: the third sort beat Plantaine seeds:
some also use wine in stead of oil.

A salve. Take white rosin five dragmes, powned Aloe half an ounce, An
especial salve for the fracture of the skull.
oil of Roses and wax as much as is needful, let it melt by a mild fire:
when it is cold, put thereto half an ounce of Gummi Elenij: with boiling may
be made a tough plaster thereof. It draws the matter out of the broken
skull, and from the bottom or depth asswageth the pain.

Yet one more that is stronger; Take the upright Balsame, or in stead thereof
oil of Cloves, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, of each three ounces, white rosin, Gummi
Elenij, of each one ounce, Frankincense, Myrrh, Sarcocolla, beaten small, of
each one dragme and a half, oil of roses two ounces, wax as much as is
needful: make a tough salve thereof, and sees it in four ounces of the juice
of Woodbinde until all the juice be consumed.

Of the skins or tunicles of the brains, called Dura and Pia matter, when they
be perished.. 3.
THese two skins or tunicles that cover the brains under the skul, do the
Greeks call Meninges, the vpmost is called Dura matter, the hard Mother, for
that in comparison of the other it is very hard and full of holes where the
veins pass thorough. Pia matter, the good Mother, is very spare and thin,
therefore also very dangerous if the same be wounded: for which these salues
following are ordained and found requisite.

Take Woodbind, Betonie, Pimpernell, of each two M. Gummi Elenij, Dragon blood,
of each three quarters of an ounce; sees them together in two ounces of oil
of roses, and sufficient quantity of red wine until all the moisture be
consumed, wring it out, and let it be cold, make it as thick as you will with
molten wax.

Or take Turpentine, Rosin, Wax, of each one ounce, Frankincense one quarter of
an ounce, oil of Roses three ounces, Cummi Elenij three dragm. Mastix one
quarter of an ounce, Betonie, Wood bind, of each three drag. These herbs must
be sodden in red wine until all the moisture be sod away, afterward wring it
out, temper the other things with it, stir it well about until it be a salve.

But if the skull only be broken, whether it be by falling, throwing or
beating, and a swelling withal, then take Wormwood, Roses, Cammomill, of each
one M. sees them in red wine and oil of roses as much as is needful, temper
a good quantity of Bean meal with it, and so apply it.

Item, take Wormwood, Cammomill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Stechas, Betonie,
Woodbind, Bolus, Dragons blood, of each half an ounce, Barley meal two
ounces, oil of roses as much as will suffice for a plaster or salve, yet if
you would have it hard, add wax unto it.

The trial when the plaster is sodden enough.. 4.
IF any will put juices, wine or any other moisture in plasters, then are you
to let the juice be sod away: and when they be sufficiently sodden, you shall
know it hereby: let a drop or twain fall upon the fire, if it do not sisse as
water is wont to do, then it is enough.

The fifth Chapter. The face a part of the head.
IT is before declared in the beginning of the fourth Chapter, that in dividing
of the head, the face is the sixth part, beginning and ending from the eyebrowes
unto the end of the chin, of which parts disease we will now discourse.

As much as concerns the face in general, man has purchased the same above
all living creatures, for it cannot be said of any beast that it has a face,
Faciem, but only of mankind: and it is also to be wondered at, that nature has
planted so many parts in so small a compass; for that there be eyes that see
and lead the whole body; a mouth that speaks and takes in meat for the
sustenance of the whole body; a nose that smells, and can discern what is
pleasant or unpleasant in smell or savor, that also does discharge and
unburden the brains of all superfluous moisture; ears for to hear, whereby
men may understand one another; a beard for to distinguish one man from
another; eyebrowes to the garnishing and defense of the eyes. cheeks,
wherewith to manifest and show shamefastness, fear, peace, and friendship, as
shall be more at large showed hereafter: consequently, the face is a looking
glass of the mind, of the inward intention and unrevealed thought. But we will
not make long discourse thereof at this present, but only to discourse of the
diseases of the face, and how to cure them.

Of all stains or spots of the face.. 1.
FOr to take away this disorder or misfiguring of the face, may these remedies
following be used: make a little cruse of dow, as it were a small pastie meetly
thick, put therein six ounces of Cerusse, make it fast on the top, that there
fly no vapor out of it; let it stand so in an oven the space of an hour, that
it be not too hot: and when it is waxen cold, take it out and bruise it small,
and put thereto a sufficient quantity of Elderne water, and so set it in the
Sun close stopped; stir it every day about four or five times, wash the face
therewith fourteen days long, or as long as is needful with a cloth which
is wet therein. This is oftentimes approved.

Item take fresh roots of Salomons seal, beat and anoint it on the spots: or
take Goats milk wherein Salomons seal roots are decocted, and use it as is
aforesaid. The water of distilled honey does take them also away.

Maidens milk, Lac virginis, the which the ancient Physicians do so name, Lac
virginis or maidens milk.
is a good and sure water, not only for stains in the face, but also for many
other diseases, as shall be hereafter more at large declared, and the same shall
be prepared thus: take half a pound of litharge of gold, beat it small, and
put it into a pot, pour half a pint of vinegar upon it, let it sees a little,
afterward when it is settled pour of the clear into another glass and keep
it; you may preserve the litharge for to make a plaster with it afterward.

Secondly, take a good handful of salt, put four ounces of water upon it,
sees it to the half, and keep it also in a glass by it self: whenever
you will use it, then take three parts of salt water, and one part of the
foresaid vinegar, temper it well, then will it be as milk: will you have this
better, then put a little Rose water and Sal Armoniack unto it. It is good for
all scurfes: some do use it in the eyes also, but it is very sharp, chiefly if
one take Sal Armoniack with it.

Tristrams water.
TAke twelve ounces of Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger, Grains, Cloves, of each half an
ounce, Rubarb one ounce, Beuer cod, Spikenard, of each half an ounce, oil of
Bay two ounces, leave the spices unbeaten, pour to it four quarts of wine,
cover it close, and let it stand so the space of four weeks, afterward pour
away the wine, powne all the spices to pay, and put it again to the foresaid
wine, let it stand well stopped three days, stir it well about: then distill it
in hot water without seething, and preserve it well. Besides that this water
does take away all spots of the face and of the body, there is ascribed more
unto it these wonderful virtues, to wit, some holden in the mouth takes away
the toothach. Also venison laid therein should continue good a year and a day.
Also al manner of fruits and flowers laid therein do the like: a little thereof
put into faint wine, makes the same fresh and quick: a little drunk thereof
does break all inward impostumes, it keeps a man in good constitution, also
the stomach, the liver, the milt, the lights and the bowels; a cloth dipped
therein put on wounds does heal the same: it preserves from al dead palsies,
it dries al moist and rheumaticke brains: if any drink the same, or anoint
the head therewith, it takes away a stinking breath: also it keeps one long
youthful if one drink a little of it in the morning, as many times has been
proved.

A salve for the spots: Take oil of Roses, unguent of Roses, of each half an
ounce, oil of Violets one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Plantaine half an
ounce, Muscilage of Fleawort, of Mallows, of Violet leaves, of each one ounce
and a half: let it sees till the Muscilage be consumed, afterward with
molten wax make a salve thereof.

For the freckles which one gets by the heat of the Sun: Take a little
Allume beaten small, temper amongst it a well brayed white of an eg, put it on
a mild fire, stirring it always about that it wax not hard; and when it
casts up the scum then it is enough, wherewith anoint the freckles the space
of three days: if you will defend your self that you get no freckles on the
face, then anoint your face with the whites of eggs.

Of the redness of the face.. 2.
TAke the whites of two eggs brayed well with Rose water, temper the juice of
Plantaine and of Docks amongst it, of each a like much, afterward three
grains of small powdered Sublimate also mixed amongst it, anoint the
redness with it.

Afterward take about eight ounces of vinegar and rose water, temper one
quarter of an ounce of Brimstone amongst it, Allume one quarter of an ounce,
let it sees softly until about one third part be sodden away, wash therewith
the red face.

It is also good that the bad blood may be drawn out to set a horsleach or
twain to it, for it is found that the rednes of the face and the pushes can
never be better taken away, than with this fastening of the leaches, but one
must always purge beforehand.

A water. Take Sulfure viue half an ounce, salt one drag. Camfere half a
scruple, rose water, the water of blew Flowerdeluce, of each two ounces; set it
fourteen days well stopped in the sun, stir it oftentimes together, make a cloth
wet in it, and therewith wash the face.

Another. Take one ounce of Ceruise, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Myrrh
half a drag. let them be sifted through a lawne searce together, put them into
a mortar, and pour thorough a little sallet oil and vinegar, and with long
stirring it about make a salve thereof.

For all white pushes of the face.. 3.
FOr this is first of all good, the water of broken Ceruise with Elderne water,
which is described in the first.

This salve may be also used for it.

Take sheep sewet, fresh marrow out of the stags bones, melt them together on
the fire, and anoint the face therewith. Item take Camfere half a drag. grind
it small with three ounces of rose water, stir it often, and wash the face
therewith.

For this is also highly commended, the oil of Spike, besides the good savor,
it gives the face a good color.

With the white pushes of the face, we do also understand all scabs, blisters,
and other spices of leprosy in the face, Montag^a.
which the Grecians do call L^chenas, and the Latinists Montagram for that all
such diseases do commonly appear with dry white scabs, and itching scurfe
about the chin, the which does at length spread it self from thence over the
whole body; for which these remedies following are very good.

The Goats milk that comes warm from the beast, the water of
Liriconfansie, of each eight ounces, the whites of three new laid eggs which
come warm from the neast, the crusts of two warm white loaves, Salomons seal
one M. Camfere half a drag. This shall be distilled together in seething
water, then temper the Camfere amongst it, and wash oftentimes the face
therewith.

The face comes also otherwhiles full of little red blisters, whence issues
a sharp moisture mixed with blood, the which if it be not remedied in time, it
will degenerate into the right leprie, against which these means following are
to be used.

Take water distilled of water-snegs or of muscles three ounces, Ceruise washed
with Hearts tongue water, one ounce and a half, the juice of wild cucumbers or
the water thereof as much as is needful for to make a salve thereof: but this
following is more forcible.

Take Sarcocolla, Ceruise, Starch that is steeped four days in ly, of each
three ounces, al these are you to temper with the white of an egg: Lastly, put
thereto two grains of Muscus, and one dragme and a half of Camfere, make a
salve thereof, and therewith anoint the face.

But this following is above all other to be commended: Take Litharge of gold
which is well decocted in vinegar and well cleansed, bruise it very small, and
temper with it oil of roses: but amongst all the rest this is to be noted for
a rule, that the use of this foresaid nointing is not to be done but only at
the evening.

For to make a clean face.. 4.
IF any one have a dark and sad countenance, he is to be purged with Hiera
piera, afterward he must every morning fasting take Gentian, Wormwood, bitter
Almonds, of each one drag. beaten small together with three ounces of Wormwood
water certain days together: he is to wash the face oftentimes with vinegar
tempered with Rose water. This following is also very sure: Take Litharge of
silver an ounce and a half, Sulfure viue half an ounce, Camfere half a drag.
burnt Allume half an ounce, make a fine powder thereof; put thereto the water
of Lillies and of Liriconfansie, of Bean blossoms, Salomons seal, of each one
ounce and a half, keep it in a close stopped glass, and when you will use it
stir it well about.

Item take Beans as many as you will, steep them all a night in sharp
vinegar, take off the peeles, and dry them in a warm place; beat them to
powder, and put some of it in warm water when you will go to bed, and wash thy
face therewith.

It is counseled for women, that if they will have a well colored face, to eat
oftentimes course Marierom: for this it is also good to drink wine, for it
maintains a lively color.

In like manner are much commended for this purpose the Aromaticall wines, that
have rosemary in them, not only to be drunken, but to wash the face also with
them. Betonie infused a whole night in wine makes a good color.

For congealed blood after any blows remaining.. 5.
TAke Comfrey, daisie leaves, of each three ounces; Cammomil, Melilot, of each
one ounce; Bean meal two ounces; boil them together and beat it to grout,
and when you will use it add oil of Roses to it. Item this following is very
good: take Comfrey, Daisie leaves of each three ounces, Cammomill, Melilot, of
each two ounces, Saffron one drag. Bean meal four ounces, fresh butter two
ounces, Fenegreek meal one ounce and a half, boil the roots in water, beat
them and make a plaster of it: this is very good for bruised members with
congealed blood, it suppleth and swageth the pain, put also Wormwood and
Comin unto it, of each one ounce, then has it not his like.

How to make a good color.. 6.
TAke the roots of Cuccowpint, Ceruse, of each half an ounce, beaten small,
mix them with Rose water and anoint the cheeks with it: or take the lesser
three leafed grass beaten, rub the face therewith; it makes a fair face and
a clear skin: It is also ascribed to the Mithridate that it should also
beautify the face, but young hot folks are not to use it.

The sixth Chapter. Eyebrowes, Eyelids, with all that appertains unto them.
IN the beginning of the description of the face in the fifth chapter is showed
that the same has his entrance at the eyebrowes; therefore does the division
of man's body require somewhat to be written of the same.

This is here specially to be noted, that provident nature does wonderfully
defend the eyes, not only with these, but also with other members mo, from
many kinds of external accidents: for first there be Cilia, the hair of the
lids placed on the edges of the uppermost and undermost eylids, which stand out
before with hard and stiff hairs, whereby all small things, as flies, dust,
and such like, that might fall into the eyes, should be therewith withstood.
Afterward are both the eyelids Palpebrae, whereof the undermost stands very
fast, and the uppermost most swiftly moves, so that it covers the eye
against all that might fall into it: they do thus preserve and keep the eyes
in the sleep, they cover them from the ayrie light, to the end that the whole
body might the more commodiously take rest. Thirdly, they have above in the end
of the forehead as is said, Supercilia, eyebrowes set upon a high bulk
garnished with much hair, to the end that all things that might fall down, and
specially the sweat, which thorough his salt nature might do the eyes much
harm, should be kept of these as it were with a bulwark or fortress. And in
like sort have both the cheeks also two bunches in the midst of the two sides
separated and defended with the height of the nose, like as also the outsides,
both of them with hard bones preserved and provided for, called of the
Anatomists Ingales, the temples: so that the eyes are on every side fortified
that they might lie the surer in the depth. It is not needful to speak more
ampler thereof, but only to discourse of those things which are convenient for
the healing of the maladies that are incident to those members.

Of the swelling of the eyelid.. 1.
THere do fall many maladies into the eylids, as swellings, impostumes,
blerednes, and other mo, which maladies also oftentimes with the falling away
of the hair are augmented. But we will begin with the swelling, these have many
causes, first that the defluction of the eielids comes of a gross and tough
humor, their rednes, itch and smart make manifest, whereby they be exulcerated,
and the hair falling away by no means grows again as long as this disease
endures, the which does hurt the sight and the eyes. This patient first of all
if he be full of blood, is to have a vein opened, afterward to prepare the
matter with Oxymel compositum and sirupe of Fumitory, and afterward to purge
with these pills following, Take yellow Mirobalan barks half an ounce, Aloe
one quarter of an ounce, Turbith one drag. Dragagant, Roses, Diagridio^, Seen,
the juice of Fumitory, temper them all together, and give thereof one dragme at
once or four scruples. They do purge the burnt matter and salt phlegm: water
baths are also very profitable for this, wherein Mallows, Sorrel Docks and
Verueins are decocted, used oftentimes.

At night lay this plaster following thereon, take Endive, Purslaine, Priests
crown, of each a like much, beat them to pappe, and temper them with the
white of an egg, and with a little oil of Roses: you may also wet a cloth in
the juice of those herbs, and so lay it thereon. Item take sodden Lentils,
power out the broth, bray them with a little Rose water, and lay it thereon
like as the former. Or take Lentils, Pomegranate pills, Roses, Sumack, of each
one ounce; beat these together, and make a pap thereof with Rose water: make
the eyes often moist with stilled Rose water, or well water wherein Sorrel is
decocted. Or do thus: Take Dandelion, Sorrel, Roses, Docke leaves and Lentils,
of each a like much. Item, take prepared Sarcocolla, and bruise it in the juice
of Celendine, and anoint the eyes therewith, is very good. The order of diet
is like, as hereafter in Ophthalmia shall be showed. But if this defluxion or
redness of the eylids be of long continuance, then must one let blood, and
purge the oftener, and outwardly use the stronger things, as this ensuing,
called Sieff viride: Take Verdigrease one drag. burnt Vitrioll one quarter of
an ounce, Orpiment, Seafome, Saltpeter, of each one scrup. Sal Ammoniac two
scrup. temper them together with the juice of Rue, and anoint it upon the
eylids. This is very good indeed to expel all such diseases: but it is very
strong, and somewhat perilous to be used in the eyes, yet outwardly not a whit.

This following is somewhat milder: Take Verdigrease one dragme, Dragagant
three drag. Saffron and Pepper of each one drag. make it as thick as honey with
sour wine, and use it as before.

Item, take white Wine, Rose water, of each two ounces, Aloe, Saffron, of each
one dragme, wherewith wash the eyelids, take water wherein Sumacke is decocted,
Rose water and white Wine, of each three ounces, Vitrioll, Verdigrease, and
burnt Aloe, of each one drag. wash it cold therewith: or take Roses one quarter
of an ounce, prepared Tutia three drag. Antimony, burnt Copper, of each half a
drag. Wine six ounces, Fennel water one ounce and a half: temper them and wash
the eyes therewith.

The other manner of swelling or distension of the eyelids and brows, does
come of subtle moisture or vapors. Also if there be something thrown into the
eye, stung of wasps, or perished through any other inconveniences. In like
manner if one rub the eyes with any strong herbs, as Nettles, Rue, Esula, etc.
Also these accidents may proceed of a bad digesture of the stomach, of overmuch
watching or sleeping, like as it comes to pass in the Lithargy, and also in
the Dropsy.

Item, if the swelling be caused through stripes or hurt, then take the white
of an eg brayed, temper it with Rose water, or oil of Roses, and lay upon it
as often as it is dry: two or three days after put Cammomill in a little bag,
and let it sees in Wine, and wet the swollen eyes therewith.

Item, if this swelling be caused through wind or vapors, then take powned
Millet and Cumin, of each a like much, make a plaster thereof with fennel
water, and lay a roasted apple upon it. You may anoint it also with the juice
of Sloes.

But if the swelling do come through the stinging of Waspes or Bees, then take
Theriaca, Mithridate, or the confection of Triphera, tempered with a little
Aloe, bruised with Rose water, and anoint it therewith. Some do temper salt
Gemme amongst it: You may read further thereof afterward in the seventh part,
of the stinging of Bees.

Or if this swelling be caused through rubbing of hot herbs or such like,
anoint it with Populcon, oil of Roses tempered with the white of an egg: for
this also the juice of Housleeke tempered with oil of Roses, or with juice of
Plantaine, making clothes wet therein, is good. If it be caused by much
watching, then is sleep requisite: and also for a bad digesture, to suffer
hunger and thirst, etc. If the same be caused through cold, then take
Asarabacca Daffodil, of each half an ounce, prepared Tutia, and anoint the
swelling therewithal: there may also oil of roses and white wax be molten
amongst it, that it may be like a salve. The third sort of swelling of these
members, is like as it were a fatness that shows it self throughout the
brows, where the same aggrauateth and hinders the lids that one cannot well
open them. This distension is without pain, and if one press his finger upon
it, then is the mark seen stand a good while afterward therein. The occasion
of this is dry or gross slime, and withal some moisture of the eyes, it does
matter in the corners of the eyes, that sticks so fast to the eyelids. But
one must first try to remedy it by fomentation, and to take for it the
decoction of Wormwood, Cammomill, fennel, Annise, and such like: afterward
make a plaster of prepared Ammoniack or Diachylon, and some salt Armoniack and
Ireos tempered amongst it: and if it will not away therewith, then is it
certain that it proceeds not of moisture or vapors but of rottenness; for
which many strong things are to be used, for that will not easily be consumed,
even as you may apparently perceive, if you let water and fat sees together,
that the water is much sooner wasted than the fat: therefore we are also to use
the things following that are rehearsed hereafter in the first place of this
distension.

Especially if the premises will not help, he is to purge, like as is said in
the first swelling or distension of the eyelids: but if so be that the water be
subtle and fluxible with choler, then is a purgation to be tempered with
yellow Mirobalans and Woodbind water, and also to let blood if it be needful.
Warm clothes wet with well water are also very good laid thereon: also to
bathe otherwhiles. And when one goes to bed to lay upon it the white of an
egg brayed well. In the morning are the eyes to be fomented again with warm
water: if then the matter be gross, and the swelling be any thing big, then
take Fenegreeke and Linseed, lay them to steep in woman's milk, then wring out
the muscilage, but foment the eyes with warm water before, and lay the
foresaid Muscilage upon it; if there be then pain with it, anoint the place
with the fat of a hen. This does also the Muscilage of Linseeds alone, tempered
with a little Wax and oil of Roses and laid thereon. This tough matter we
must seek to consume with the foresaid Collyrium of Tutia, Pepper, and such
like, and therewith continue somewhat, because health cannot follow so soon
after it. There comes also other whiles pain of the eyelids, which presses
none otherwise than as if one were constrained to hold his eyes shut: for which
the Mithridate is very good laid upon the eyes and the forehead, and held in
the mouth.

The fourth kind of the swelling is called Hailstones, by reason of their
hardness, which is not throughout like to the fat swelling, but only in one
place whether it be within or without the eyelids: for this is first to be
sought to mellow it, as shall be hereafter taught. If this cannot be effected,
then if it may be come by outwardly, it is to be cut out.

The fifth kind receives her name of the Barley which it resembles, for it is
such a swelling of the eyes that stretches him from one corner of the eye to
the other, and is greatest in the middle and smallest in the corners, and has
this difference with the aforenamed Hailstones, that they remain hard
throughout, but this not so, unless it were so hardened through long
continuance of time.

For to cure this, the head vein is first to be opened and purged: afterward
to lay upon it Opopanacum molten in Cammomill oil. Afterward a plaster made
of prepared Galbanum and Barley meal, of each a like much, prepared with oil
of Lillies and laid thereon: for this is also very good, Hens grease warm. The
eyes must be often bathed with warm water, wherein Barley and Cammomil is sod,
and afterward anointed with the blood of Pigeons, Turties, or Partridges.

Another plaster: Take Galbanum, Ammoniacum, of each half an ounce, Boreas
one dragme, mix them together and lay them upon the eye. Or take Frankincense
and Myrrh, of each one quarter of an ounce, Landanum half an ounce, Boreas,
Allume, Wax, of each one dragme, the dregs of the oil of Lillies as much as
is needful: melt therein the Laudanum and Wax, the rest temper and beat
amongst it: use this so long until it be all consumed.

Of the itch and smarting of the eyelids.. 2.
IT is mentioned in the former distension or swellings of the eyelids, that the
same comes with great itching and smarting, whereof we must speak more at
large. This happens oftentimes in the infusion of the eyes Ophthalmia,
through salt and sharp rheumes, whereof shall be hereafter discoursed, and
also of Lice, whereof is before spoken in the third Chapter and eight. and
shall immediately hereafter follow in the discourse of the brows.

Otherwhiles this itch and smart does proceed of hot blood, or such like other
moisture, and in case then the rubbing and scratching do come to it, then has
the humor the more recourse thither, whence follow scabs and scurfe, not much
differing from bran or sawdust, which does harden and continually smarteth. And
although in the former swelling of the eyelids (as is said) there be good
remedies declared, meet also for this disease, yet nevertheless it is very
needful to speak somewhat more thereof. If it do come through heat and
redness, use for it all that is there rehearsed: if it come of any sharp
matter, purge (as before in the first swelling is showed) once every month. Or
purge with the whay of Goats milk, wherein is sodden Epithymum, in the which
shall be steeped and wroong out Mirobalani, Chebuli, three dragmes, Annis seeds
half a dragme; and if this be too much, then prepare these pills following:
Take Aloe, Rubarb, of each one drag. Annis seeds half a drag. Diagridion two
scrup. make pills thereof with the juice of Fumitory, take thereof one dragme at
the uttermost at one time: afterward open the veins in the corners of the
eye, and set boxing cups behind in the neck. Also use either of these
fomentations of the eyes, whereof has been spoken in many places of the
distension and swelling of the eyelids. Or take yellow Amber one quarter of an
ounce, Pomegranate peeles three dragmes, temper them with honey, and anoint the
eyes with it where the itch is. Or take Sal Armoniack two drag. Aloe half an
ounce, mix them together in a brazen mortar. But if the itch be not too great
after the letting of blood and purging them, only foment the eyes with warm
water, wherein is decocted Mallows, Docks, and Sorrel, with some Rose water
put amongst it: or take white wine three ounces, Aloe one quarter of an ounce,
anoint the eyes therewith after the fomenting.

Item, take Butchers broomeseed, Pursian seeds, Lentils, of each a like much,
powne them all together, close it with the white of an egg and oil of Roses:
Sarcocolla tempered with the juice of Celendine is always very good for this
purpose.

Of clefts in the eyelids.. 3.
THese clefts and infection of the eyelids are caused of heat, or of a sharp
and salt humor that falls into the eielids after the purging and letting of
blood (whereof is said so oftentimes) Sees pills and blossoms of Pomegranates
very soft, afterward stamp them in vinegar, and therewith anoint the eylids
certain days together; and afterward temper some Saffron and the yolke of an
eg amongst it, and lay it upon it, for it heals much, like as does also the
Sieff de Thure, which is approved for all rheumes of the eyes, and to be sought
for in the Register.

Of Warts upon the Eylids.. 4.
OF these there be two sorts: the one not very hard and without rankling, which
is caused of melancholic humors: the other hard, like to a small Mulbery,
standing commonly about the corner of the eyes: both of these must be cut or
burnt, and afterward things laid upon it, which hereafter for the cure of the
excrescence of the flesh, of the fistula and corners of the eye are dicoursed.
But of the warts shall be more amply written hereafter in the fifth part.

Of the inuersion of the eyelids, where the inward red flesh appears
outwardly.. 5.
IT happens also that through the increase of flesh the eyelids do turn, and
the inside does appear outwardly. There are two sorts of this: the one when
the eyelids being turned about be red and sore, which is a kind of
scabbednesse: the other does cover and hide the whole apple of the eye with red
and meetely big veins: both of them are of long continuance, and hard to be
healed. Therefore it is advised that at the very first there be somewhat laid
unto it: and although the cure of this disease have the same intention with all
other forementioned infirmities of the eyes yet nevertheless it is required
for this disease, that if the party be in health, he must purge with these
pills: Take Agaricus, Coloquint, Bdellium, Mastick of each one dragme, Aloe
half an ounce, Turbith one ounce and one quarter, make pills thereof with the
juice of Betony, whereof you are to give one drag. at once. Or take Pillulae
aureae two scrup. Cochiae one scrup. make pills thereof, and fast six hours
upon it. But if one have once purged, then is the head vein to be opened
between the thomb and the forefinger, and in like manner in the forehead, and
to set boxing cups behind in the neck. Allume boiled in white wine, and washed
therewith, is also very good. Afterward this plaster following shall be laid
thereon: Take Fenegreeke meal six ounces, Cammomil, Roses, one ounce of each,
red wine as much as is needful for to make a plaster, whereof take as much as
you will use at one time: temper amongst it the whites of two well brayed eggs,
and say it upon it. Afterward you are eight days one after another to use
this sirupe following: Take sirupe of Roses one ounce, sirupe of Vinegar
Compositum half an ounce, Fennel and Licorice water, of each an ounce: after
this must you by and by take the foresaid pills again; and further then every
fifth day once, two hours after supper, the inuerted eyelids are in the day
time often to be anointed with the juice of smallage, and that enduring the
space of eight days. The next eight days afterward, they are to be made
moist softly with the water wherein Sal Ammoniac is dissolved, and then being
anointed with the foresaid juices, lay this plaster following upon it: Take
the plaster De Muscilaginibus as hereafter it is described, one ounce, of
Allume, Vitriol, both burnt, of each one dragme, melt this plaster with old
wine, temper the powders amongst it into a tough plaster.

After the use of this plaster and the foresaid water, then use this powder
following: Take Antimony half an ounce, prepared Tutia, Orpiment, Bloodstone,
Litharge of gold, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a very fine powder of
it: this eats away all the superfluous flesh, heals the sore eyes, dries
and takes away the itch. But if it be too strong, then leave out the Orpiment,
and take only Verdigreace two drag. Tutia three drag. Antimony half an ounce;
but have care of the apple of the eye. And if this disease wax old, then it is
needful that this scabbednesse be rubbed until it bleed, which may most
commodiously be effected with fig leaves. The other must be opened with a
lancet, with a hot iron, and the pain assuaged with the braied white of an eg.
But these are cures of cunning and expert Chirurgians, to whom only the same is
to be referred. But this drying powder is not here to be concealed, which is
also discovered in other places: Take egshels of very new laid eggs, lay them
the space of nine days in vinegar, dry them and make thereof a subtle
powder, and strew it upon the disease.

These sick persons shall beware of all meats that fume into the head as of al
spices, mustard, strong wine, and eschew especially drunkenness: but let them
eat rere eggs, Spinach, fennel, Borage, Parsley, young flesh, and drink watered
wine.

The other manner of inuersion of the eylids happens when the uppermost eylid
shrinketh up, or is drawn up, so that it cannot cover the apple of the eye: we
call it the Hares sleep; it does sometimes cover but one part. Thirdly when
the uppermost of the eyelids cannot reach to the lowermost. But if it come by
nature, then is it not possible to be helped.

There comes also otherwhiles a pain in the eyebrowes, which wringeth sore
(as if one were constrained to keep them always shut) for which Mithridate is
very good being spread upon the eyes and on the forehead, and likewise some
thereof holden in the mouth.

Of the Consolidation or growing together of the Eyelids.. 6.
IT happens otherwhiles, that after the taking off of the skin, or cutting
off of the flesh in the corner of the eyes (if it be not well looked unto) that
the eyelids do grow unto the apple of the eye, or one fast to another,
wherewith the whole eye is covered.

For to prevent this, must the eyelids which are not yet grown, be raised up
softly, and the place be anointed with a soft fether with the decoction of
fennel and Carraway, then put in some of the white of an egg; do this every
day two or three times: now if there remain any flesh, the fourth day are
sharp Collyria to be used, which hereafter are described in the eyelids.

Of the neathermost Eyelid which pricketh the Apple of the Eye.. 7.
FUrther, it comes also to pass, that the Eyelids do alter their natural
course in growing, not growing right but inwards: and because (as has been
said) next to the Apple of the eye, they are very subtle, not sensible at all,
they make the more pain with their pricking: for to amend this, these means
following are to be used.

If there be but one or two hairs, then take Masticke, Gummi Arabicum, make
them somewhat moist, turn the eyelids about and anoint them therewith: if it
will not be well therewith, then are the hairs to be plucked quite out, and you
must burn the holes with a glowing needle that it may not grow out again. Or
you may use this salve following: Take the juice of the roots of Southernwood,
Muscilage of Fleawort, a little vinegar and Camfere, anoint the same in the
same hole. Item take Opium one grain, Mastick half a scrup. make it soft with a
drop of vinegar, and anoint the hole therewith. Or take the blood and gal of a
Hedgehog, iron dross, of each like much, make a flat cake like to a Lentill,
or fish scale, and lay it on the place where the hair is drawn forth; that
swageth the pain within the space of an hour, and will not suffer the hair
to grow there any more. Or take the rust of iron, temper it with fasting
spettle. In like sort may also be powned Ants eggs, and used. But amongst all is
the plucking out and burning most surest.

If the hairs be many that grow inward, then must one cut off the outer edges
of the eyelids; so that the roots of the hairs be taken away, the which must
be done by expert Chirurgions, otherwise must the eyelids not be cut overthwart
at any hand, for that they could not grow together any more.

Plaster de Muscilaginibus.
A plaster de Muscilaginibus, promised to be described in the fifth. Take
Fenegreek, Linseed, Hollihock roots, of each three ounces: boil them, and draw
out the slime or the Muscilage, besprinkle it besides with a little vinegar,
afterward temper 3. ounces of small beaten Litharge of gold sodden softly with
six ounces of oil of Sesamum, and put thereto the foresaid slime, and then
sees it to a plaster or salve.

For falling off of the Hair in the undermost eyelids.. 8.
THe falling off of the hair is of many sorts; whereof heretofore in the
imperfections of the hair are many things described in the third Chapter, 6..
and furtherin the description of the beard shall be declared. The cause of the
falling off of the hair out of the lower eyelids, is a sharp salt matter,
which consumes the humors that should feed the hair, and dries away the
roots thereof, that they must fall away, which is oftentimes seen by them that
recover of a sore sickness. It may also happen in the soreness and scabs of
this place, as hertofore is sufficiently declared. Also experience does teach
us, that the hairs do fall from the eyelids of those that lead an unchaste
life. Also that the crab lice do grow thereof is sufficiently declared before
in the former Chapter, 8.. But if the cause of all this be a sharp, salt,
smarting matter, let the body be purged, like as heretofore is specified for
the itch of the eyelids, and so for the like in others.

But for a beginning, one must keep a good order in eating and drinking;
afterward make this plaster: Take Hares dung, Bucks dung, of each one quarter
of an ounce, burnt Hasill nuts three drag-goates fat as much as is needful for
a salve, therewith anoint the eyelids. Or take Antimonie, burnt Pepper, of
each one drag. and washed Lead half an ounce, Indie Spica, Squinant, of each
one drag* and a half, burnt Date stones five drag. Goats and Bears fat, as
much as is needful for a salve.

Item take Swallows dung, Mice dung, of each half a drag. burnt Date stones,
Lasure stones, of each one drag. Indie Spica one scrup. make a salve thereof
with clarified honey, and use it as the aforesaid.

If the falling off of the hair be caused of redness, smarting, or scurfe,
then take a Pomegranate, cut it in eight pieces, and sees it in vinegar until
it be soft, and unto growt or pap: afterward strain the juice through a cloth,
and use it so long until it be through whole.

The seventh Chapter. Of the Eyes.
THey are thus described: The eye is an instrument of the sight, whose nature
and complexion is moist, round, yet a little flattish, with seven pannicles and
three humors complete and conjoined, the definition whereof would here be too
long to rehearse. These two members are accounted in comparison of all the rest
to be very small, yet notwithstanding so precious, that our Lord God has
planted marvelous things, and showed his power and omnipotency most
excellently in them: whereof it is not here needful to write any more, yet it
is not amiss to rehearse those things which in the beginning of the first
Chapter have been said of the face: to wit, that for the most part al humane
affections, inward desires, and cogitations of the heart, do most forcibly
appear in the eyes. For what is there, that the inward thoughts, will and
desires of the heart and the mind could counterfeit more naturally, than these
members? For they show through their rolling about, looking downwards, sudden
motions, winking, and other such like, mirth, sorrow, anger, hatred, and other
affections of the heart. They do give also sure knowledge of the secret lusts:
for there cannot be so many inclinations in the breast of man, but there may be
a sign thereof discerned in the eyes: so that one may justly say, the eyes are
most true messengers of the heart and of the mind. Of them have the
Physiognomici known the manifold nature of men, and adjudged that the eyes
which stand so deep in the head do see much sharper, than they that stand wide
out. Those eyes that stand far out (they say) do decipher a fool and light
brained person: they say also, that the eyes which do so twinkle and close the
eyelids so often, do always signify fearful persons: contrariwise, they
that hold the eyes strong open, are stout and invincible, and such like more,
with which natural causes the daily experience agrees. In fine, there is
nothing more costly, nor more needful in a living body, then the sight: It is
also amongst the motions of the body an only thing, that makes a difference
between life and death. And this is sufficient in general to be said of the
eyes: we will now come to their diseases and their cures.

Of the pain in the eyes in general.. 1.
BEfore that we do come to the effect of the matter, these things are to be
observed in all pains of the eyes: to wit, the nature of the patient, his age,
the time of the year, the sickness he has had before, and all other
circumstances: so that all things, according as occasion serves, may be either
augmented, diminished, or altered. In general, it is always good in all
pains of the eyes, that the patient do keep him in a dark place, free from
air and wind, lie high in the bed, so that the rheum may not tarry in the
eyes, but may fall down to the cheeks: sleep is very meet: for it consumes
and digesteth the matter. All vexation is also to be eschewed, and all that may
breed or bring any trouble to the head, as sorrow, anger, ill favor, and such
like. Also to refrain much venerie, to feed on light meats, to avoid strong
sents, as Mustard, Onions, Garlic, Beans, nuts, wine, vinegar, and all sour
meats. He must keep himself very quiet, as long as the grief of the eyes
endures. This is now a general and brief declaration, because that we
shortly hereafter (in the description of the Gnats that seem to swarm before
the eyes) shall give a longer and ampler instruction of the eyes. What
concerns the letting of blood, purging, and other sorts of remedies, that
shall particularly be taught in their proper places.

First some remedies are here described which may be used for all pains of the
eyes: and for that this is a general rule, that as oftentimes, and so long as
the pain of the eyes endures, you shall lay thereon the white of an egg,
brayed together with oil of Roses; for it stays the course of the humors,
and swageth all pains.

Item take the juice of Celendine and honey, of each a like much, beat them
together by a soft fire; afterward scum them, and anoint the eyes therewith.
The juice of Fennel and the juice of Betonie is also very good for this
purpose.

Item take broad Plantaine, Eiebright, Fennel, sees them together in a pot,
and receive the vapor into the eyes.

Take a young Pigeon, open the veins under the wings, and let the blood drop in
your eyes; but use not this in the beginning, (for it is too hot) but at the
last when the course of the humors begins to abate. Or you may use this
following:

Take the blood of a Turtle dove, temper it with Rosewater, and put it into the
eyes. This is many times approved for the pain of the eyes. Others do only
anoint their eyelids with it.

A very good Collyrium, which diminishes and discusseth the pain. Take
prepared Tutia, Camfire bruised very small, of each one scruple, Rosewater one
ounce, white Wine half an ounce, temper them well: when you will use it stir
it well about, and put a drop or twain in the eye.

The white powder of Rasis for the eyes.
Rasis his white powder which maruellously asswageth the pain. Take prepared
Sarcocolla five drag. Sief memthe (which is hereafter described) one ounce:
temper it well with Fennel water, or woman's milk. But by reason that woman's
milk is oftentimes used, therefore we will admonish here, that woman's milk
must not be used except it be very fresh: for it sowreth very quickly, and
loses her force, whereby it might do more hurt then good.

Sief memithe
Sief memithe which is here and in other places mentioned, is thus prepared:
Take the juice of the strange herb Glancium, called by the Arabians Memithe,
Chamedrios, barks of Frankensence, Myrrh, Aloe, Sarcocolla, burnt Vitriol,
Aristologi, of each a like much: make this together into a most fine powder,
and use it like as is taught.

Of the corners of the Eyes and their diseases.. 2.
FIrst there grows in the corners of the eyes sometimes as much of the flesh,
that the sight thereby is hindered. Contrariwise there comes also sometimes
such drying away or consumption, that they wholly wax sore, and always run,
so that the rude and unskillful people do deem no other, then that it is a
Fistula. The cause of this growing is overmuch blood and moisture, as it also
comes to pass in the diminishing of the eyelids, the same being not rightly
handled, the affluent humors make flesh to grow again. The diminishing and
abating is caused of drowth. The signs of both these are apparent to the
sight: they are both almost incurable, but that there must be sharp medicines
used unto them which the eyes cannot suffer, wherefore it is strictly to be
commanded to the vulgar Occulists, that they have special care of their
incisions and cauterisings in such perilous places.

For ease may one use one of these remedies following, which are very meet for
it, if the corners of the eyes do run much and impostumate.

For this, is the body first to be cleansed, afterward to be bathed every
day, and to sweat, but not too much: for yt thereby should the moisture be
drawn out of the body, and be consumed.

Afterward shall this powder be used oftentimes, made after the subtilest
manner.

Take prepared Tutia, one ounce and a quarter, red Coral, yellow Mirobalans,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Pepper half a drag. strew that in the
corners: Or take prepared Tutia one drag. Antimonie half a drag. prepared
Pearls, Nihil, red Coral, of each one quarter of an ounce, burnt silk houses
half a drag. make an impalpable powder thereof, it dries very strongly, and is
also safe. Or take Aloe, Acatia, Litium, fine Bolus, Gummi Arabicum, of each
one drag. This being powdered together, is to be mixed with the white of an
egg^, or dissolved Dragagant: afterward anoint therewith the forehead and
eyelids. Item t^^e the juice of Housleek, or Nightshade, and veriuice, of each
one ounce: mix beaten Acornes amongst it, Myrrh, sine Bolus, of each one
dragme, lay it on the eyes, as is said before.

Item take Cipers nuts, Mommie, Dragon blood, Masticke, Dragagant, of each one
quarter of an ounce, beat them small, and make with the white of an egg, or
dissolved Dragagant, a salve of it.

Item wash the eyes oftentimes with rain water, wherein Galnuts, Myrtle
seeds, fine Bolus, and Cipers nuts have been decocted. These things are all
good to drive back the moisture. Or take burnt Mirobalans, Chebuli stones
beaten small, make with water of Mints a Collyrium of them. Item take one drag.
of Tutia steeped in Myrtle water and*washed, white Coral, burnt stones of
Chebuli, Butchers broom seeds. Gal nuts, Aloe, Mastick, Frankincense, Opiu^,
of each one scrup. all beaten together after the smallest manner, make a
powder, or temper it in water wherein Gummi Arabicum or Dragagant is dissolved.

Now because that in this Collyrium, as also in other mo medicines for the
eyes, Opium is used: Opium not ways to be used for the eye.
therefore must I here admonish, that the same is not to be taken but in time
of great extremity: for it might easily happen, that whereas one meant to ease
the pain, that the disease for evermore were made altogether incurable, yea
that blindness might follow after it. Therefore are men to take good heed unto
this.

A plaster. Take Laudanum, Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, Mastick five dragm.
parched Millet two ounces, beat it all small, make with Cammomill oil a
plaster four fingers broad, and one quarter of a yard long, the which lay
upon the seame of the scull.

Hereafter do follow many more remedies, which are also very good for it: but
this present is prepared rather for the running corners of the eyes, for to
dry them, and to stay the rheum.

Of the disease in the eyes called Ophthalmia.. 3.
SOme have supposed that this Greek word did generally signify the pain in
the eyes: but other have defined it thus, Ophthalmia is an infirmity that
comes in the eyelids and in the eyes, spreading it self so wide abroad, that
it covers the whole apple of ye eye. Or Ophthalmia is a hot disease, with only
assayleth the eyes (after a natural manner) through blood or Choler; or
outwardly of corrupted matter, of cold Rheumes, or is caused of blood or
vapors, and thereby whatsoever moisture is in the eye it is ouerheated: yet do
all learned conclude with Galen, that it is Phlegm of the eyes. Of this do also
come other moistures, which the Latinists do call Lippitudinem, that is, the
blearnes of the eyes, which is caused of three special causes, like as is said
at the first, to wit, of outward, and inward: Of outward, as the Sun, smoke,
dust, and such like: so match also the unnatural alteration of the times, use
of vaporous meats, as Onions, Garlic, Mustard, strong compounded Wines, cause
the same. The inward causes are the affluxe of certain humors, be they mixed
or not: but this infirmity of the eyes may be caused of the blood, Cholera,
Phlegma, or Melancholia, of which signs we will here somewhat discourse.

O^ blood.
If it proceed of blood, then are the eyes and their veins puffed up, red, the
temples of the head do beat, the uppermost eyelids do swell, the eyes are
moist, yet with little pain; but with such moisture that in sleep the eyes do
bake to: for this does also the time of the year avail, as does the
clearenesse, youth, warm and moist country, and meats that engender much
blood. If it do come of Cholera, C^^holer.
then is there pricking, burning, with great pain and swelling, not so red as
aforesaid, but moist and burning, that thereby also the apple of the eye is
otherwhiles perished. If it proceed of Phlegma, O^ P^legme.
then is there a compression and ponderositie in the eyes, with great pain,
without heat or redness, but some whiteness, and by reason of the great
moisture, much soreness and swelling.

Of Melanch^lie
If it be caused of Melancholia, then is there also great ponderositie, with
sallow color, without redness or compression: the eyes do not bake together in
the sleep, for that the Catarre or the Rheum is too dry. The Physicians do
herein make more differences and signs, which are to be commended to the
Philosophers. But this may suffice for our purpose and intention.

Nevertheless, this is also to be noted, that these defluxions, soreness, or
impostumations of the eyes (that befall for the most part in the corners of the
eyes with a sharp salt Rheum, which has been spoken of in the. 2.) are the
beginning and true signs of this Ophthalmia. The corners of the eyes are
four, two besides the nose, which are the greatest, the other smaller.
Whenever then the Ophthalmia does appear in this place, occasioned of blood;
then must it be prevented with letting of blood, be it in the head vein, or
other, in one, or both the arms, and let out much or little according to the
ability of the patient. And if the matter were subtle and ran sore, one may
also let him blood in the temple of the head. In like manner, horsleaches
applied to the forehead, and boxing cups on the neck. But if all this will not
help, there is to be made and applied on the top of the head upon the Sutura
Coronalis a Cauterium, whether it be potentiall or actual. Afterward the
patient is to be purged, and to use no other outward means but to betake him
to a good order of diet. Now to proceed to the especial infirmities of the
eyes or Ophalthmia, this shall be the first.

Of the redness of the eyes.. 4.
THis is caused outwardly of stripes, thrusts, concourse of blood,
superabundance of blood in the veins, which (as is said) spreads it abroad
in the eyes. For this, it is advised to open the head vein on the contrary
side, or at least to set boxing cups upon the shoulders: afterward to purge.
Further, to apply outward things which drive ye matter back again. For this is
first, the white of an egg brayed with woman's milk, most highly commended and
safe, a drop or twain dropped into the eye. Or sees Linseed and make a sponge
wet in that decoction, and lay it warm on the eyes: but if this will not help
much, then do in like manner with the decoction of Fenegreeke or of Cammomill.

Item take the juice of Nightshade, temper it with the brayed white of an egg,
and with oil of Roses, make a cloth wet in it, and lay it on the eye. Item, if
the eyes be bloudshot, take the juice of wormwood, bray it well with the white
of an egg, and drop into the eyes.

Take Coriander, sees it in water, wring it out with this decoction, make
muscilage of Fleawort, temper it with fine Bolus, and lay it on the eyes with
wet clothes.

Or make Cotton wet in the brayed whites of eggs with oil of Roses, and lay it
to his forehead, eyes, and temples. Also you may temper amongst it fine Bolus,
or Frankincense, which you will.

But if the matter be subtle, then must one labor to discuss the blood: for
which end, you are to take young Pigeons or Turtle doves blood, like as is
taught before in the. 1. for that has been found many times to be good.

Item take Frankincense, Sal gemmae, of each one drag. beat it small, and make
it with woman's milk into a Collyrium.

Take broad Plantaine water about one pint, small bruised Verdigrease one ounce,
fine Bolus, Dragon blood, of each half an ounce, Camfire one quarter of an
ounce: distill this in a glassen helm in seething water: it is not only good
for red eyes, which are painful, Vlcerations o^ he priuiti*
and for swolen eyelids that have long continued: but also to all sore stinking
mouths, and especially for all vlcerations of the privy members.

Item take Aloe three parts, Camfire one part, steep them in Rosewater, and
use it.

Radish water is also marvelous good for all redness of the eyes. Take the
water of Verueine, of Eyebright, of Marioram, of each half an ounce, Fennel
water one ounce, Camfire half a drag. the gall of a great Pickerell: temper
and stir it all together, and use it as the rest.

Item take prepared Tutia, prepared in piss and Fennel water (like as is
taught in the Introduction) half an ounce, of Mace three drag. of Camfire six
grains, of Malmsey one small pint: beat all these as small as may be, mix
them together, and keep it.

You have also other preparations mo of this Tutia, like as there are twain
expressed in the Introduction of this book: but for the redness of the eyes
is this especially recommended: Tutia prepared.
take half an ounce of Tutia, make it glowing, and quench it 15. times in
Rosewater: then bruise it small, and put unto it one quarter of an ounce of
Calamint stone, three cloves, half a pint of Malmsey: mix all these together.
These three Collyria are for all redness of the eyes and other things very
highly commended of the ancient Physicians.

Also to befume the eyes with white Amber, is much praised. Item take Hyssope,
Marioram, Fenegreek, Cammomill, Melilot, Roses, and such like: sees them, and
let the vapor go into the eyes.

A plaster for the redness of the eyes. Take Radish leaves well made clean
and washed, and Currants of each half an ounce, Pigeon dung one quarter of an
ounce: beat them well together, and lay it thereon.

The same may also be done with powned Willow leaves, and laid upon it.

Salues. Take Tutia half an ounce, oil of Bay one quarter of an ounce, honey
and vinegar of each a spoonefull, Camfire one drag. make a salve thereof, and
therewith anoint the eielids. This is also meet for inuerted eyelids.

Eiesalue called Nihil. Take prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, red Coral
one dragme, Pearls one drag. Nihil albi one quarter of an ounce, Camfire half
a scrup. Barrow grease 4. ounces: temper it well anoint of this salve the
quantity of a Coriander seed in the corner of the eye, in the evening when
you go to bed: it heals the redness of the eye, and takes away all rheumes
that fall into the eyes. After this form is the salve of Roses much commended,
which is described in the first Chapter and 2.. whereof take one ounce,
prepared Tutia, four scrup. and anoint the eyelids therewith.

Confected Chebuli being eaten do withstand the redness of the eyes, and
defend the sight. In like manner Nutmegs confected in honey.

Hot eyes.. 5.
FOrasmuch then as that there can be no redness of the eyes without heat,
therefore must we discourse somewhat thereof, and use these remedies following
for it: Take the water of Eyebright, of Fennel, of Celendine, of each one
ounce, prepared Tutia three scrup. prepared Sarcocolla and pearls, of each
half a drag. temper it together. This Collyrium is much in use at Augusta.

Another. Take Rue, Fennel, Verueine, of each like much, stamp it, and pour
thereon Rosewater and white wine, so that the herbs be covered: let it stand a
night, afterward distill it in a glassed helm and in water. Item take
prepared Sarcocolla half an ounce, white Dragagant, Frankincense, Iron dross,
Pearls, of each three dragm. Indy Spica, Silver and gold Litharge, of each one
drag. and a half, Starch, Ceruise, of each one quarter of an ounce, Tutia,
three drag. bruise this all together unto a small powder, make a dough thereof
with Rose water, afterward make small trocisces thereof, and let them dry:
powne them afterward again, and make them moist with the juice of
Pomegranates, and dry them again. Thirdly, make them moist with the water of
Nightshade like as before: put thereto one drag. of Camfire, white Sugar one
drag. and a half. When ye will use of it, stir it with Rosewater, white of
an egg, and woman's milk: Take Aloe, Tutia, Honey, Sugar, Fenegreeke, Fennel,
of each a like much, sees them in Wine, and receive the vapor, or apply it
unto them; it is very good for the hot eyes. Item, take white Wine four
ounces, Aloe, Serapinum, Myrrh, Sugar, Fennel, of each one drag. let it sees
moderatly: this is also good for a Collyrium.

Take the water of Fennel, of Eybright, of Celendine, of each half an ounce,
Serapinum one drag. dissolve this gum, and temper it all together.

Item, take green Agrimonie, stamp and temper it with the white of an egg:
make towe wet therein, and lay it upon the eyes.

To set boxing cups on both shoulders, is also very commodious for this
infirmity, woman's milk, letting of blood, Roses and Fennel, with Tutia:
sodden Fenegreeke and eggs sodden warm and laid upon the eyes is also much
commended.

Hot Blisters and pricking in the Eyes.
THese are caused through moisture which sets it self in the white of the
apple of the eye, and there rankleth. The blisters are sometimes great, and
sometimes small, white, red, dark, and also black with pain and pricking,
according as the matter is. The deeper, the greater they be, and the more
hurtful and dangerous to be cured, because of the nobleness and tenderness
of this member. But this in the beginning is always good for it. Take Licium,
Saffron, of each half a drag. Acatia or the juice of Sloes one scrup. mix
this with Rosewater, and drop a little in the eyes: he must also be let blood,
and purged. But this foresaid water for the eyes must be dropped into them with
the white of an egg, and whilst the disease is in Augmento, or the increase:
then take Fenegreeke, Linseed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Melilot one
quarter of an ounce; sees it in fair water, and wash the eyes oftentimes
therewith, let a drop thereof drop otherwhiles into the eyes: that ripeneth,
draws out the corruption, and swageth the pain. When as the blister is
broken out, then heal it like other sores of the eyes. Item, take the fat of
the fish Tymalus, and annoint it on the apple of the eye: it is very strong,
therefore it is better for horses then for men. But this following is more
surer: take the crumme of white bread, make it wet in water: but it is stronger
in woman's milk, and lay it on, where it is dry make it wet again, or take a
fresh.

This confection following is very good for all heat of the eyes, swelling,
and pricking: take Eyebright, Fennel, Cinnamom, of each three drag. long
Pepper, Mints, Mace, Marioram, Verueine, Calmus, Rosemarie, of each one drag.
and a half, Sugar pennets three ounces, white Sugar five ounces: with the
Sugar sees these juices following, of Roses, of Verueine, of each two drag.
the juice of Fennel that is well clarified five ounces, the juice of
Celendine, of Rue, of each one ounce and a half: let them sees so thick as a
sirupe, afterward temper amongst it the rest well beaten.

Item take young Endive, stamp and temper it with the oil of Violets, or
rather the oil of Roses: anoint therewith the hot corners of the eyes and
the eyelids: the same takes away the pain, and swageth the heat. If that
will not help; take the meal of Lintels, Sumacke seed, Roses, Pomegranate
kernels, powned together and tempered with vine cuicte, use this as the rest.

Item if this help not, then must the head vein in the forehead be opened, or
in the corners of the eyes, which you will; which does void away the sharp
matter that setleth in the eyelids. In like manner purge always with such
medicines which expel the Cholera, and salt matter. It is also good to bath
other whiles, and to sweat moderately, whereby the sharp daefluxion is
delayed: or in stead of sweating may you foment the eyes with a sponge made wet
in lukewarm water. Lastly, it is very good to wash the eyes with water of
Fennel, of Celendine, of Verueine, and of Eyebright, mingled together one
amongst another.

Itch and Scabs of the Eyes.. 6.
THese biting dry scabs of the eyes do otherwhiles manifest themselves on the
lids of the eyes, so that one cannot forbear but to rub them, the which does
the eyes and face great hurt, making the same more hotter and redder.

This defluxion is a salt matter, which is sharp and pricking. Against this,
he must first reframe from rubbing of the eyes, eat and drink soberly, purge
choler, open the head vein, and also lay thereon outwardly at the first fresh
water or Rosewater two or three days: afterward he must foment and wash the
eyes with the decoction of Mallows, Violet leaves, Celendine and Verueine, or
with Rosewater also alone. If then of this or any other occasions there come
any swelling to it, then look to that which is ordained for red and hot eyes.

Watering or running Eyes.. 7.
IT is manifest, that the mattering of the eyes does proceed of many
occasions, as of mirth, sorrow, weakness of the retentiue power, and
superfluous moisture of the brains that falls upon the eyes; like as of
thrusts, stripes, sharp winds, smoke, cough, sharp sauors of Onions, Saffron,
etc. all the which do perish the eyes, so that the eyes do stand as if the
eyelids were newly plucked off, or that a Cataract had bin couched in them, or
as if they had suffered any other disease, the which also happens if any body
drink too much wine: wherefore that many may afterward bewail the miseries of
drunkenness, what concerns the outward causes, those may be learned of the
patient himself. But if this running of the eyes be caused through any disease
of the brains, and not through heat: then does the patient always feel some
heavy puffing up of the veins in the forehead, and in the temples of the
head: and this defluxe is for the most part always augmented by the neesing.
This running or watering is very strong, falling as well into the eyes as into
the nose, with a sharpness in the throat. But if this defluxion be through
heat, then is the humor so hot, that through the heat it bites open the
eyelids, which cause the hair to fall out of the eyelids, yea that the heat
may be perceived, through feeling with the hands. But if it come through cold,
then are all things contrary to all these that we have now spoken of. Now the
remedies of these running eyes be these.

They that be caused of outward causes, may be easily remedied, that is, by
taking away of the cause of this defluxion: but as much as does concern the
inward causes where heat is the cause, it is specially advised, that the body
be purged sometimes with Pills Cochiae, Aurea, with Succo Rosarum, or with Pills
of the five kinds of Mirobalans. And it is not enough that this and the letting
of blood be once performed, but oftentimes: to wit, in the beginning, in the
augmenting, and in the standing still of the disease, that thereby the
sickness may be thoroughly helped.

The order of Diet.
FOr this must all drying things be used, and all moist attenuating meats and
drinks eschewed, like as Lentils, Colewoorts, Lettice, Purslaine, salt fish
and flesh, Milk, Cheese, Onions, Scallions, Garlic, and all that fumeth into
the head: some forbid to eat in the evening. When it is caused through heat,
he must smell to Roses, Saunders, Camfere, and such cooling things: like as
also the Pomanders are commodious for these causes, ordained in the discourse
of the Plague.

When the patient is purged, and the pain of the eyes be yet in the beginning;
then take (like as is is oftentimes advised at the first) the brayed white of
an egg, and drop a drop thereof in the eye. Take also milk of a young woman
which has a daughter sucking upon her, put it fresh into the eye: or take two
ounces of Rosemarie amongst it, then beat the white of an egg, and drop a
drop or two thereof in the eye.

Some do take only fresh water mixed with vinegar, and use it as is rehearsed,
specially after bathing, and have thereby found great amendment.

This is also much praised: Take unripe Grapes, burn the same to ashes, bruise
them very small, and blow somewhat thereof into the eyes; it dries the
running, and does drive away the redness.

Or take the slime of Fleawoort, Quince kernels, or Dragagant one quarter of an
ounce, the white of an egg well brayed, woman's milk that has a daughter
sucking, half a drag. tempered well; if the pain be very great, then draw out
the slimes or muscilage with water, wherein before Poppie heads have been
sodden. You may also use Sieff de Rosis which follows hereafter.

Take fresh Rose leaves half an ounce, Saffron, Spica of Indie, Gummi Arabicum
of each one quarter of an ounce, beat all small, and make cakes thereof with
rain water: and when you will use them, then take one dragme thereof, and lay
them to steep in the beaten white of an egg. This is special good in the
beginning of the hot Ophthalmia: for it repelleth the matter back, it
consumes and asswageth the pain. In like manner, is this also following much
commended: Take washed Ceruse, prepared Sarcocolla, Dragagant, Licium, Acatia,
pills of Pomegranates and Frankincense, of each one dragme, Pearls, Opium, of
each half a scruple, and the juice of Pomegranates (which is very clear) as
much as is needful for to make cakes or troscisces thereof when you will: then
use thereof. Then lay a dragme thereof to steep in Rose water; this has a
constringent virtue: it dries and cools all hot humors: but when the pain
is at the most, then temper among the foresaid medicines two or three grains
of Opium, or of Sieff album, called Sieff Rasis.

Take washed Ceruse one ounce, Gummi Arabicum half an ounce, Opium, Dragagant,
of each half a dragme: this must you bruise very small, and temper it with
the well brayed white of an egg and woman's milk. Take also the juice of
Fennel well scummed one ounce and a half, Aloe two dragmes and a half, a
leaf of well beaten gold: temper them well, and afterward put unto it the
weight of seven grains of Frankincense: dissolve them in good white wine, and
mix them all together with Fennel and Rose water: you must drop of this water
twice a day in the eyes.

Item take good Aloe steeped in the juice of Fennel: put thereto the weight
often grains of Frankincense burning therein, kindled at a candle, use it as
before.

Other waters more. Take Rose water four ounces, quench therein glowing gold,
afterward put thereto Aloe, Frankincense, Masticke, Litharge of silver, of
each one drag. let it sees until a third part be consumed: afterward,
strain it through a cloth, and use it as it is needful.

Item take Dragon blood, Aloe, Sarcocolla, of each half a dragme, Saffron,
Camfere, of each half so much, prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, bruise
it very small, and temper amongst it wine of Nutmegs four ounces, and as much
Rose water: also let it sees in water in a glass, until about three parts be
consumed: it dries and heals without any danger.

Item take Aloe, Tutia, honey, Rue, Fenegreeke, Fennel; sees it in wine: it is
especial good for all ouerhote eyes.

This water following is also very appropriate for the same disease: Take
prepared Tutia one ounce, prepared Bloudstone one dragme, Frankincense,
Mastick, Pepper, of each a scrup. Fennel water, Eyebright water, of each one
ounce, Rose water and Violet water, of each two ounces, old fine wine three or
four ounces: put it into a glass, and let it sees in water even to the
half, afterward strain it through a cloth.

A salve. Take the juice of Rue, of Framboyes oil, of Myrtle, of each one
ounce, let it boil until all the juice be sodden away: then wring it through a
cloth, and set it again upon the fire: mix amongst it prepared Sapphire half
a dragme, Iacint one scruple, Antimonie one dragme, burnt Copper one scruple,
prepared Tutia three dragmes, let it sees softly with the foresaid fire: put
thereto three dragms of Wax be it more or less, accordingly as you desire to
have it hard: wherewith anoint the eyelids. This swageth the pain, stays
all defluxions in the eyes, and takes away the cause of them wonderfully.

In running and ouermoyst eyes, take Myrrh half a dragme, Bloudstone one
dragme, the uppermost sprigs of Framboyes, and of the Rose tree, of each one
ounce; sees them together in a glass in water unto the half: afterward
strain it forth through a cloth, and drop at least four times a day one drop
in the eyes. Secondly, the forehead and temples of the head are oftentimes, or
at least against the evening, to be anointed softly with the juice of Roses.

But if this rheum be but in his increasing, or in Statu, which is at the
highest; then may he very freely put therein all the foresaid things, and
chiefly woman's milk (which is much commended for this) also temper Dragagant
amongst it, and drop in them. In like manner take prepared Tutia, Camfere, of
each a scruple te^pered with half an ounce of white wine. It dries and
swageth all pain. This is also very good, Tutia tempered in Fennel water, in
water of Celendine, of Rue, of Verueine, and in Rose water, and a gal of a
Pickerell, or a Partridge put thereto, and the same kept in a Copper vessel,
until it be to be used: or take prepared Tutia one quarter of an ounce, white
Amber one drag. Fennel and Rosewater, of each four ounces, take also washed
Ceruise one quarter of an ounce, prepared Sarcocolla, Dragagant, Opium, of each
half a drag. Gummi Arabicum, Saffron, of each half a scrup. This being
altogether beaten as small as may be, temper it with rain water, and let it
dry. And when as you will use it, mix it with woman's milk.

Here is to be noted, that rain water for all pain of the eyes is very meet,
for that it is subtle.

But whenever this Ophthalmia comes to abate, then may bathing be used: or
that which is more sure, sees Cammomill and Melilot in water, and make a
spoonge wet therein, wringing it out a little, and so hold it warm upon the
eye, and when it is cold to make it warm again. Or take fresh Wormwood,
Lycium, Fenegreeke of each two ounces, Sarcocolla one ounce and a quarter, the
juice of Celendine half an ounce, Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Saffron,
Seafroth, of each one drag. sees that which is to be sodden, in rain water
unto a pap, and temper amongst it all that is beaten, and lay it warm over the
eyes. It is also very good to wash hands, feet, and face oftentimes with the
warm decoction of Wormwood, Melilot, and of Cammomill. In like manner also is
the yellow powder of Rasis in the declination of this defluxion much commended,
which is thus to be made: Take Sarcocolla five drag. Aloe, Saffron, Lycium, of
each one drag. Myrrh half a drag. make a powder thereof.

Bleared eyes of a cold cause.
IF this defluxion or rheum come through cold, then at the first when it
begins to fall, use this confection: Take Indie Spica five drag. Agaricus
one dra. and a half, Cinnamom one ounce, Masticke, as much as the weight of
them all: also make a confection thereof with clarified honey, and use thereof
every day.

This patient is to smell unto all warming and drying things, as Muscus,
Lauander, Marioram, Amber, Betonie, Styrax Calamita, and such like, as also
unto the pomanders that every where in this book are specified.

It is also very convenient to chew and to eat a good deal of Fennel seed
every morning, Likewise also Rue and Verueine chewed, and the eyes anointed
with the spettle.

If so be that the eyes be filled with cold moisture that flows out of the
brains: for that is this following very good to be used. Take prepared
Bloudstone one quarter of an ounce, Roses, burnt Yuorie, red and white Coral,
Amber, yellow Mirobalans, of each one drag. the juice of the sprigs of
Fromboyes four ounces, temper them together, and so keep it well stopped: of
this juice put daily into the eyes, and anoint also the eyelids therewith.
This does dry the rheum marvelous much, and does strengthen the eyes from
taking any such moisture.

Or take the juice of Fennel, of Rue, of each one ounce, childrens urine half
an ounce, Aloe three drag. let it sees somewhat, and then strain it through a
cloth, and put a drop of the same in the eye: it cleanses, dries, and
sharpeneth the sight.

Item take Frankincense, Masticke, Cipers nuts, Myrrh, Aloe, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Tutia, Sarcocolla, of each one drag. and a half, Dragons
blood, Sumach, Barberies, Roses, of each one scrup. make them to powder, or to
trocisces with the juice of Fennel, and use it with Rose water or Fennel
water.

Item roast three apples, cleanse them of the pills and kernels, then temper them
with the yolks of three new laid eggs, and then lay it warm to the eyes.

Item take Acatia, Dragons blood, of each one drag. fine Bolus one quarter of
an ounce: this being beaten together, then make it to a plaster with the white
of an egg, and lay it round about the eyes from whence the rheum does come:
you may lay it also upon the forehead, and upon the lids of the eye: but then
you must leave out the Bolus.

In winter time may one wash his eyes with the urine of a man child and wine:
in summer with the urine and with Rose water: that drives away the rheum, and
preserves the sight wonderfully.

This water following does dry much the cold catarres: Take Gummi, the
Muscilage of Fenegreeke seeds, of each one quarter of an ounce, of prepared
Sarcocolla, Spicanardi, Myrrh, Cinnamom, Aloes, Beuer cod, of each half a
scrup. this powdered all together small and made up with woman's milk.

This following dries also much the defluxion: Take an ounce of Tutia, bruise
it very small in a mortar, put thereto 12. ounces of old sower wine, power some
upon it, and bruise it well with the stamper: afterward, power wine upon it
again: afterward let it sees together in a copper pan. When it is from the
fire, then temper amongst it Aloes beaten small, one quarter of an ounce, put
two or three drops thereof in the eyes. Then lie upon your back the space of
two hours. This discusseth the blood also in the eyes, and takes away all
sharpness, and biting Rheumes.

In like manner if this defluxion do make much pain, then take unwashed
sheep wool, burn it to ashes in a close stopped pot, bruise it as small as
may be, and mix it with the white of an egg: lay it on your forehead and on
the temples of the head: this swageth the catarre very quickly, and abateth the
pain.

Another. Take the sower juice of a Pomegranate (sees the same to the half,
and scum it well) fire ounces, Sieff Memithe, Aloe, Licium, Saffron, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Hydromel half an ounce, put them all together in a
glass stopped close; set the same the space of four days in the Sun, and
use it morning and evening, it is good and approved: it helps much the
obscurity of the eyes.

A plaster. It is also profitable for such cold catarres, to have a plaster
laid upon the temples of the head. The same is to be made thus: Take Aloe,
Myrrh, Myrtle leaves, Acatia, of each one drag. Masticke, Frankincense, of
each half a drag. beaten small together, make it to a plaster with the white
of an egg. and lay it as is said on the forehead and temples of the head.

Another. Some do counsel for to take Assa foetida one ounce, Pepper one
quarter of an ounce: melt and sees the Gum in vinegar until it be thick,
then stir Pepper amongst it, lay it over the eyes: but have good regard, that
there come none of it into the eye: it will stink much, and is very dangerous
for the eye. But there be other things that may be used for this purpose.

Of actual cauterisation in the neck in all Rheumes of the head.
THis has oftentimes also been more remembered, and is often used by the
ancient Physicians, even as many Italian Physicians do advise, that in these
cold rheumes or defluxions, the neck is to be opened with an actual or
potentiall Cauterie, whereof diverse may be sought in the Register, and must be
kept open about forty days.

What is convenient for purging.
THat is to be effected with the pills Cochiae, which be sharpened with the
trocisces of Alhandali, also with the confection of Hiera, and such like. In
the declination of the rheum through cold, bathing is very meet, to wash
himself with urine, to drink wine moderately, to apply unto it the foresaid
sponge with the warm decoction of Cammomil and Melilot.

Sore eyes with or without matter.. 8.
THese diseases do come commonly through outward occasions, as of pricking,
striking, or any other manner of bruising: in like manner, of inward causes, as
hot, sharp, and salt rheumes, which do eat in and perish the pannicles of the
eyes.

If then there be perceived great pain with pricking, beating, and with moist
rheumes in the eyes, and the eyebrowes be fallen, the eyes stand wide open, the
white of the eye looking red, and that some whiteness be seen upon the
black: then is there an impostume growing, and indeed such accidents do
verily require an expert Surgeon: for (as the common proverb is) there is
no jesting with the eyes. Therefore to this end and intent shall hereafter be
presented and delivered many good medicines: and we will first begin with
things which are caused through inward sharp Rheumes: It is to be noted, that
the Impostume that comes in the white of the eye, is not so much to be
feared, as they that come upon the star or black: for that they are the most
dangerous. Amongst which, one is called the Canker, which comes of
melancholicke humors: and the signs be, that this Impostume does show it
self with heat and heaviness of the mind: the face and the eyes are of a
leaden color: It makes great pricking pain in the eyes, and in the temples
of the head, on the side whereas the disease is. And if there be applied
thereto any hot things, then does the pain increase manifestly, the appetite
to meat is lost, and all the face gets another color: Therefore when that
is seen and perceived, then must it be with all speed prevented. And first to
begin with a necessary letting of blood, and purging: The patient must be
forbidden wine, and flesh, and specially sweet wines. His meat must be
cooling herbs, as Spinach, Lettice, Purcelane, Gourds: Endive water must be
his best drink: much letting of blood (if the party may suffer it) is good.
And if so be that the impostume do appear very great, then is the patient to
be let blood the more in the Median or in the Saphea, on the same side:
afterward in the liver vein, always regarding the time of the year, and the
patients ability. But if the Impostume be not so great, you may be content
with the opening of the liver vein or Median only: hereby will the Rheum be
cut off, that it cannot fall any more into the eyes.

For this are meet also boxing cups set upon the shoulders and higher, with
picking: But if the matter be sharp and bitting, one must purge with
Mirobalans, Manna, laxatiue juices of fruits, and such like. Afterward the
patient must be caused to neese, and to gargarise, whereof you have before in
the second Chapter and. 2. good instruction, and shall have hereafter in other
more places. When as this is effected and done, you may use of these medicines
which you will. First there is Sief album, (not long since described in the
7..) tempered with woman's milk. If it leave beating, then it is a good token,
and hope that the soreness or pain will wear away without impostumation: but
if it come to impostumate, then must it be cleansed with Hydromel, or honey of
Roses, tempered with rain water, making a linen cloth wet therein, and so
laid on it. Secondly, with astringent things; as the Sief de Thure, which is
forcible for all humors and defluxions of the eyes. Thirdly, with drying
medicines; as with well prepared Tutia, and chiefly with the plaster de
Muscilaginibus, which is described in the sixth Chapter, and in the end of the
7.. Will you then have some part of the Catarre repelled? Then put thereto the
Muscilage of Fleawoorte, or of Quince kernels, the which must three or four
times a day be laid upon the eyes, mixed always with Sief de Thure: to wit, as
long as the matter cleaves to the apple of the eye, and no longer.

A good salve. Take Tutia prepared in Rosewater half an ounce, fresh Swines
grease one ounce, Starch three quarters of an ounce: bruise it long in a mortar
one amongst another: afterward wash it three times in the water of Nightshade,
and anoint the forehead, the temples of the head, and the eyelids with it,
without and within. This salve is marvelous good for all impostumate and
running eyes, as also for all pains of the eyes, bloudshots, scabs, and wounds
of the eyes. Some do use also the maiden milk, or Lac Virginis, (which is
described in the fifth Chapter and the 1..) but it is somewhat sharp in the
eyes.

If there be any sharp Catarre that falls into the eyes; take warm white
bread, steep it in women's (or any other) milk, and lay it upon the eyes.

Item take a white loaf, cut slices thereof a finger thick, lay them to
steep in Well water, and lay them on the eyes.

Oil of burnt linen is also very good for the impostumate eyes, which is to
be made as hereafter follows.

Lay clean and washed linen clothes in a glassen helm, strew powned glass
upon it, again afterward another lay of clothes, and glass again, until
the helm be half full: afterward distill it in sand. Some do burn it in gilt
boules, and give it for the plague. Item set the clothes on fire with a candle,
lay them upon an even piece of iron, tin, or silver, and put them presently
out again. Then shall you always find a drop of oil, the which take up with
a feather, and so gather it. This heals marvelous well the impostumation of
the eyes, takes away the pain, and is good for the fistula and wounds in the
eyes.

Clarified honey anointed in the corners of the eyes does heal all diseases.

This Collyrium following is above all measure much commended; a little of it
being dropped often in the eye, for it heals and strengthens the sight
mightily.

A precious water for the eyes.
Take Rue, Roses, Endive, Betonie, Veruein, Venus hair, Agrimonie, Cleuers,
Milfoile, Eybright, Chamedris, Pimpernell, Sage, of each two M. cut them small,
steep them a day and a night in good Wine: afterward wring them out, and
spread them on a board that the moisture may run off: ten hours afterward
beat them gross, and distill them in water, and keep it stopped close.

Item, take the juice of Celendine one ounce, the juice of Fennel one ounce
and a half, Ox gall five drag. and one scrup. Wolfes gall three quarters of
an ounce, prepared Tutia, half an ounce, temper them all together, this dries
much the impostumate eyes.

Item, take Poppy leaves one M. Verueine, Eyebright, Fennel, Mallows,
Hollihockes, Cammomill, of each half a M. chop it and stamp it to pap, mix
it with oil of Roses, make a cloth wet therein, and lay it over the eyes. It
is a general commandment, that where one uses water for the eyes, you must
bind it hard with twice double linen, whereby the medicines applied fall not
off through neesing, coughing, or any other stirring or motion of the head.

Impostumes of the eyes through outward occasions.
IF so be that the impostumes of the eyes be caused through any outward
occasion, as through thrusts, strokes, and such like, then are the deep
thrusts or pricks dangerous and most to be feared, lest blindness do ensue.
But these means following are to be used for the same: Take vnpared Quinces,
the kernels being taken out, beat them small, and temper meal of Lentils
amongst them, and a little honey, that there may be a plaster made of them:
lay the patient upon his back, and apply some thereof upon his eye. Or take a
whole Pomegranate, between sour and sweet; sees it in a little Vinegar, A
drying and astringent Collyrium.
stamp it, and use it as before. Item, take the yolke of a roasted egg, lay it
with towe upon the eye. Item, use also waters for the eyes that are drying and
astringent, as hereafter follows: take powned Bloudstone that is nine times
washed in the urine of a man child or boy, one quarter of an ounce, Gummi
Arabicum, Dragagant, burnt Copper, of each one dragm. burnt and washed Pumis
stone, Opium, of each a scrup. Fennel water as much as is needful for to
form small trocisces thereof: when you will use them, then steep them in
white wine. The eyes are also to be often washed with water wherein Roses are
decocted, or well water tempered with Vinegar and four Wine: for this is also
fit, Olive leaves, and if they cannot be had, then in the stead of them is the
juice of Shepherds purse used, wherein burnt lead bruised small is to be
tempered, also the juice of Quince leaves, and Medlar leaves, and then sallad
oil must be put amongst it, and so lay it over the sore eye.

Where the eyes do bake together in the sleep.
TAke the juice of Housleeke, and anoint the eyes therewith: it does soke them
softly, and cool them.

Item, take juice of Agrimonie alone, or tempered with woman's milk: also
Rosewater, and other waters for to soke therewith the dried matter of them.

Of Aegylops, a certain swelling between the nose and the corner of the eye..
9.
THere comes otherwhiles a small impostume between the nose and the corner
of the eye, the which the Physicians call Aegylops. If the same be not helped
betimes, then does it infect the bone. The Surgeons do heal the same in
this manner: they cut up the uppermost skin, and wring out the impostume
which lies locked in a little bladder, and cut it off as near as may be, the
rest do they take away with an actual or potentiall Cauterie. The same
swelling does settle it self otherwhiles in the length of the eyelids, yet
both are to be helped with Oatmeale, Wine, and Tutia tempered together in
manner of a Salve.

Of Blemishes or spots in the Eyes.. 10.
THese are two special kinds; red, and white: The red are caused thorough
blood, when there appears in the eye a red drop, or a dark (like as a
congealed blood) which at times is also black: that is wont to be caused of
blows, falls, great labor, much weeping, and such like. In like manner also
of inward causes, as has been said of Ophthalmia, and of red or ouerheated
eyes.

For this is also much commended, the blood of Turtle doves, wild Pigeons, or
(if one cannot have them) of common house Pigeons being let blood under the
wings, (like as is already rehearsed) and chiefly in the beginning, if one
temper some fine Bolus among it, and the eyes to be fomented with warm water
wherein wild Time, Marioram, Fennel and Barley is decocted.

A water for the eyes. Take the seed of Ameos, Comin, Fennel roots and the
seeds sodden together, and a little Salgemmae tempered amongst it: you shall
oftentimes let some thereof drop into the eyes.

If it be needful to use any stronger thing for it, then take one quarter of
an ounce of Orpiment, put eight ounces of water unto it, stir it well about,
and then let it settle: power the water clear from it, that no substance of
the Orpiment run with it, and drop thereof in the eye. But good heed must be
taken in the use of this sharp venime, that there follow no bad accident after
it: therefore it is more sure to use this following:

Take prepared Bloodstone three drag. burnt Copper one quarter of an ounce, red
Coral, Pearls, of each half a dragm. Gummi, Tragacant of each two dragmes
and a half, Pepper the weight of thirty grains, washed Ceruise one drag.
Orpiment, Dragon blood, Saffron, Amber, of each half a drag. make a dough
thereof with the blood of Turtle doves, of Hens, or common Pigeons blood, and
form Trocisces thereof about the weight of one dragm. When you will use these,
bruise them in woman's milk, and put a drop thereof in the eye.

It is also very good for the skins of the eyes, whereof we purpose to
entreat hereafter.

A plaster. Take Doves dung, make it with wine and vinegar into a plaster,
and apply it lukewarm upon the eyes.

Or take that which follows which is most certain. Take Raisins, put out the
stones, powne them, and put vinegar to it, use it as before.

Item take fresh cheese meetly salted, Radishes roasted in ashes, Melilot,
Cammomill, of each one ounce, roasted Lilly roots, meal of Lentils, Dragon
blood, of each half an ounce, Saffron one quarter of an ounce: temper them all
together with the brayed white of an egg, unto a plaster.

In like manner it is also good to foment the eyes with the decoction of
Coleworts, and the leaves thereof (sodden together in wine in manner of a
plaster with Cammomill) laid upon the eyes.

Now concerning the white spots which do come commonly after the Impostume of
the eyes. Of these some are thin, and some are thick. But they that stand upon
the white and be thin, do the sight no hurt: but those that are thick, and lie
upon the apple of the eye, they remain and are almost impossible to be healed,
but to be somewhat eased, and rather in children then in aged folks.

Now albeit that this is hardly effected without the manual operation of an
Occulist: yet nevertheless are these things very good for it, and especially
if the same be white and thin.

First of all, he is to bath oftentimes in water, or at the leastwise to foment
his face and eyes so long with warm water, until the face be thoroughly red and
sweating: and if that thereby be caused a redness or pain of the eyes, it is
to be omitted certain days, and afterward begin again. Also you may use
water wherein Mallows, Hollihocke roots, Oaten straw, Barley, Otes, and
chiefly Fenegreeke are decocted; for this is a certain and approved receipt.
After this fomenting, strew this powder therein: take Sarcocolla, white Sugar,
Spuma maris, of each a like much, and bruise it very small.

Item take Cuttle bone powdered small, and temper it with woman's milk.

Take swallows dung, honey as much as is needful, and if you will make it
soft, mix it with Fennel water. But the story of Tobias does show that this
medicine is especially perilous.

Make the eyes oftentimes moist with fresh woman's milk, but if you cannot get
it, then use the waters wherein Mallows and Hollihock roots be decocted:
afterward you may put thereto the Sieff de Thure, the which you must prepare
like as hereafter follows.

Take Frankincense five dragmes, Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla, of each two dragmes
and a half, Saffron one dragme, beat them all unto an impalpable powder, and
with the muscilage of Fenegreeke make it into trocisces: use it with woman's
milk, it does mundifie the eyes apparently.

In like manner, the Seiff de Plumbo does engender flesh where there be small
sores and spots, and it is thus made: Take burnt Lead, Antimonie, prepared
Tutia, burnt Copper; Gummi Dragagant, of each half an ounce, Opium fiteene
grains: make it very subtle, and form Trocisces thereof with rain water: It
is very good for all diseases of the eyes, it cleanses and drives the matter
out of the eyes, when it is mixed with Rose water, it takes away all manner of
uncleanness out of the eyes, and stays the defluxion also, but preserves
especially the sight of the eye.

Item, take Litharge of silver bruised very small, Comin, Bayberies,
Gallingall, Ginger, Aristologie, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each one dragme beaten
small, put a pint of Malmesey unto it, or any other strong Wine: stir it well
about three or four days, afterward strain it through a cloth into an other
glass, and preserve it well stopped, for it is good for all spots of the eyes,
and also for all fractures of the bones, and it draws the wounds together
without stitching. First take water that droppeth from distilled honey two
ounces, Sugarcandie one quarter of an ounce, Virtues of Sugar candy. Water of
Rosemarie for the eyes.
drop it twice a day in the eyes. Sugarcandie is good for all diseases of the
eyes, and for the sight. Rosemary water made under the earth is also very good
for these blemishes of the eyes, the which some do thus prepare: Fill a glass
with Rosemary flowers, stop it with wax on the top, and bury it in the
Dogdayes about half a foot deep in the earth forty days long, and then
yields it a water.

When the pearls or Velmes be new.
WHen the pearls or spots be new, there are four kinds of waters to be used
for the^. First of all (as is sometimes admonished) let woman's milk be dropped
into it, and afterward fine bruised Cuttle bone blown into the eyes. Secondly,
take the juice of Corneroses and of Centorie, of each one ounce, honey two
ounces. Thirdly, take Swallows dung bruised small and dry, half an ounce,
honey as much as it needful. For to make a dough, let it dry: take thereof
one dragme and a half, Eybright water two ounces, temper them together: this is
wonderful, but (as is already said) perilous. Fourthly, take Cuttle bone two
dragmes, Sugar one dragme, make a subtle powder thereof, and let some of it be
blown into the eyes: But if the fleckes be out, then are they to be fomented
with woman's milk, or with the decoction of Hollihock roots, Mallows, Barley
or Oate straw: afterward this following is good. Take fresh egg shells, burn
them a little, the dung of a green Lizard, Spuma maris, Sarcocolla, that has
lain certain days in the juice of Celendine, washed Ceruise, of each one
dragme, prepared Tutia, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each half a dragme,
Cuttlebone, Ginger, of each one scruple, Kites gall two scruples, powne all
that is to be powned, and temper it with the water of Celendine.

For this serves also the foresaid Rosemary water, which is made under the
earth. Fourthly take Verdigreace one dragme, Frankincense two dragmes, Vitrioll
half a dragme, Spuma maris, Celendine, Rue, Roses, Rosemary, of each one ounce
and a half: sees well the last four, until there remain about four ounces:
mix the other powders with this decoction, and let it dry. Afterward beat
it again, and temper it as before, do this four times together. Lastly, make
a subtle powder of it, and use it upon the pearls. It does strengthen the
sight, and takes away the white pearls without pain: but if it be thick or
old, so that none of these will help it, then is the last mean to take it
away with the needle, which belongs only to the manual operators or
Occulists.

Of the Fistula in the corner of the eye.. 11.
THere be many Surgeons that describe these Fistulaes amongst other ulcers
of the eyes: in which place, namely, in the fifth part of this book we shall
describe their natures, and what vlcerations they be: but we will here only
write of this Fistula, which is wont to appear in the corner of the eye. The
causes of this are badde humors, and for the most part cold, which do a long
time in this place settle themselves, putrify, and lstly impostumate. The
signs thereof are humors of the place: and if any wring it, then it does
pain one: it is somewhat reddie, gives afterward green matter; and it
happens, that it oftentimes hurts the eyelids and the nose. But before that
the Fistula be touched with any application or cauterie, the patient must be
prescribed an order of diet, and must purge well. For diet: first, he must
beware of all fat and strong sauouring meats, of milk, moist fruits,
Onions, Garlic Mustard, and all that is much salted. In like sort, all that
may replenish the head with hot vapors, as Spices, sleep immediately after
meals, and doing violent exercise.

For to purge, one drag. of the pills of Hiera Composita is to be taken: Make
five or six pills thereof with the sirupe of Calamintha: If you will first
use preparatiues, then take of the foresaid sirupe one ounce, Oxymel Compositum
half an ounce, decoction of Mace three ounces. Are you afraid of the heat of
the liver? Take some cooling things therewith, as Cicorie water, or any such
like. One may use four of these potions in the space of eight days; in the
morning, and at the same time that the body is stopped. He is to take every
other day, or every day, one pil of Aloephangine before meat, or washed Aloe.
After the taking of these four potions, these pills following are to be used,
Pil. de Sarcocolla two scrup. Cochiarum one scrup. make with the sirupe of
Roses seven pills of them: afterward you are to use every morning this
Collyrium following: and after that, apply this plaster on the corner of the
eye. Take prepared Antimonie, Frankincense, of each one scrup. prepared
Sarcocolla, one drag. Licium, Dragon blood, burnt Iuorie, parched Dragagant,
prepared Iron dross, of each three drag. Rue, Nightshade, and Celendine
waters, of each one ounce; let this dry, until one may form dowe thereof:
when you will use thereof, then dissolve it in the foresaid waters, and put two
or three drops thereof in the eyes.

For a plaster: Take Mommy, fine Bolus, the juice of Sloes, Frankincense,
Hippocystis, Masticke, of each three drag. Acorne cups, Cipers nuts, Gals that
are woorme eaten, Isenglas, Dragagant, Gum, of each one ounce. The Isenglas
must be dissolved in red vinegar, and temper the other ingredients amongst it,
and make thereof a plaster.

If it be then perceived that the corner of the eye waters, and if one wring
or press upon it, there come matter out of it: then it is a Fistula, and the
actual cauterie is the best mean to heal it: for otherwise it is very
uncertain as Rasis writes: he found this medicine first, that the Fistula
does thereby cease certain months, that one would think the same to be
through whole, and is thus prepared.

Take Aloe, Frankincense, Sarcocolla, Dragon blood, blossoms of Pomegranates,
Antimonie, Allume, of each a like much, Verdigrease the fourth part of one of
them, make a powder thereof: when it is then needful, wring the Fistula so
long, until it yield matter. Lay the patient on the contrary side where the
Fistula is not, and temper this powder with a little woman's milk, and drop a
drop in it. Now, and a certain season afterward one more, and so four times
one after another: let him lie the space of three hours. Do this the space of
a week, and look well to it that the Fistula be wrung out, and yield no more
corruption or matter.

Now although (as it is said) the accident is uncertain to be healed, yet is
there amongst all the rest, Rue most highly commended for it. When that the
Fistula is made wet with the juice of Rue, and wine of Pomegranates, and
covered with a double cloth, also if the cause require to open the Fistula so
wide until one may see the bottom of the same, which may be effected with the
dry root of Gentian, Elderne pith, or with an Iron. Secondly, the spoongions
flesh which lies at the bottom, and is the right root of the Fistula, must
be killed. The which must be effected with an actual or potentiall cauterie.
The corosiue is made thus: Take Orpiment, Vitrioll, Cantarides the heads and
wings taken off, quick Lime, Salarmoniack, Alum, of each one scruple: beat
them to powder, and make a dough thereof with the urine of a man child; let the
same dry, and lay somewhat thereof every morning in the fistula: the will
cleanse it. Also you may use this following, which is also very good.

Take Ginger three dragmes, Verdigrease one dragme, beat them small together,
and sees them in half an ounce of vinegar until it be thick: anoint the
taint with it, or that which you shall lay in the fistula.

Item take fresh Rue, Agrimonie, Celendine, of each a dragme, beat them and
sees them in six ounces of Aqua vitae, or water of Rue, unto the half; put
some thereof every day in the fistula, two or three times. Thirdly, it must be
cleansed, which is to be effected with Hydromel, and Rue water, and honey of
Roses, or with sour wine wherein Roses are sodden. Fourthly, for to cause the
flesh to grow or incarnate; you shall take Aloe, Frankincense, Sarcocolla,
steeped in Fennel water, oil of Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax
as much as is needful for a salve: one may put thereto one quarter of an ounce
of Ineos. In like manner Agrimonie is highly commended, and Rue leaves, of each
one dragme decocted unto the half in a pint of wine, the same being wrong
out, and used every day, like as is aforesaid.

If Gnats, Flies, or any such like thing seem to swarm before the Eyes.. 12.
THis disease proceeds of flegmaticke and melancholy humors which fall out
of the brains into the eyes, oppilating the sinews of the sight more or
less, according as the defluxion is tough, hard, thin, much, or little.

The Physicians do call this accident Catarractam, as a cadent water. It does
sometimes proceed of a foul stomach, or through some disease of the eyes:
but if it be caused of the stomach, then is the danger not so great: for
as soon as the occasion is taken away, then auoideth that which is caused
thereof. But the other is much to be feared, and very needful to be looked
unto, whilst it is yet time: but when it waxes old it is incurable by
Physic: and can by no means be helped, but through the needle, and that is
also uncertain.

That which is caused from the stomach, makes before both the eyes buzzing
and flying, as if there were Gnats or somewhat else, that swarmed so before the
eyes; and that much more, if the stomach be full, then when it is empty. Also
whenever such fantasies do continue, enduring before the eyes the space of a
month or twain without any alteration of the apple of the eye, or disclosing
of any other signs; then may one assuredly judge, that these diseases are
caused of the stomach: for this patient is a certain order of diet to be
ordained, and he must purge with Pillul^s Cochijs.

But if this swarming of the Gnates or flies be only before one eye, and not
to be wiped off; then may it well be deemed that this disease comes by reason
of some moisture with lies closed in the eyes, especially if one see no dark
thing in the eye: but if one perceive any dark thing therein, then without all
doubt the sinew of the eye is stopped and obstructed. Now for to help this
infirmity, there is nothing more to be advised then to begin with a good diet:
first is heed to be taken, that the whole body, and especially the head be
covered well, and kept warm: he must refrain all moist air and dwelling, and
not look much into the water (specially where it is much stirred with the
wind) he must oftentimes fasting rub and comb his head. He must bath his feet
before supper with this decoction following: Take Bay leaves, Sage, Betonie,
Stechas, Penniroyall, and such like, except Smallage and Dill. Item let him be
often times rubbed with warm clothes from the neck to the shoulders
downwards: after meat he must refrain from forcible exercise, and (if it be
possible) he must abstain three hours from writing, and beware of all hard
meat; but use all that warmeth.

And to recite somewhat thereof in particular, well salted and raised bread is
not amiss to be used, wherein Fennel seed or Fennel powder is baked.
Concerning flesh, there is nothing more commodious, then sucking Veale, young
Mutton, Roe dear, Kids, and Hares. Of fowls, young Hens, Pullets, Capons,
young Pigeons, (and chiefly wild ones, which have a secret virtue to strengthen
the brains) Partridges, Snipes, Fesants, and Quails: the Blackbird is also
permitted for this, River fish are more wholesome then other: nevertheless
other fish are tolerated measurably used and broyled, dressed with Pepper,
Ginger, Fennel, Annis seed, Parsley, Verueine, Eybright, and Rue. One may
eat eggs after what manner he list: only so that they be not hard baked,
sodden, or roasted. Further, Sugar, Honey, Veriuice, the juice of Limons, and
Citrons, herbs of a warm nature, as Sage, all manner of Mints, Penniroyall,
Hyssope, and wild Thime, are all good. All kind of Rapes, all their seed
confited does strengthen the sight. Of all fruits are allowed fresh Figs,
Almonds, roasted hasil Nuts, Pistacies, roasted Chestnuts, Corans, Raisons,
Sallet oil, Oil of Walnuts, Oil of sweet Almonds. These Spices following may
he also use, as Pepper, Galingale, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger, Cynamom,
Grains, Lignum Aloes, Comin, fresh Fennel, Eyebright strewed upon his meat,
or take half an ounce of Eyebright, one quarter of an ounce of Mace; and
always take one scrup. thereof before meat, for this has been found to have
oftentimes helped them that had their sight blemished: Rue seed is also very
good, and for them that have this passion in the eyes, are the herbs, roots,
and seeds of Pyonie good, howsoever they be prepared for the taking. Also
Treacle and Mithridate, have a special property to put away the clouds, and
all that swarm before the eyes. Auenzoar does write, that all they which be
burdened with the forementioned Cataracts or dimnesse, that if they look
earnestly into the eye of an Ass, thereby the defluxion should be stayed: but
if so be that this be true, it is a wonderful work of nature. This powder
following may also be used for an approved thing, for many have been helped
thereby.

Take Eyebright with the flowers beaten small, Mace, of each an ounce and a
half, silver mountain three quarters of an ounce, Sugar four ounces and a
half: make a powder thereof.

It is also very good, that one hold his face oftentimes over the vapor of the
decoction of Celendine, Fennel, and Eyebright: but such like more shall follow
hereafter.

What these patients must refrain.
EVery such patient must beware of those things that make great disturbance in
the head, as anger, calling, crying aloud, raging, sorrow, stench, and from
much watching, because they much weaken the natural heat. But he must
oftentimes let blood, and use boxing cups. But as concerning his meat: there
are hurtful for him all still standing waters, seafish, and all fish which are
taken in moorish waters, to be eaten rather sodden then broyled if one should
often eat of them, Crabs, Eeles, Tenches is he utterly: to forbear: also
milk, and all that is dressed with milk, and he must not use much vinegar but
only outwardly. All herbs of cold and moist natures, as Endive, Beetes,
Spinach, Purslain, Lettice, Cucumbers, Gourds, and chiefly Colewoorts which
darken the sight, are to be eschewed and left. Of all roots are chiefly
forbidden Garlic, Onions, Radishes. In like manner also all pottages (except
red pease, which be called Cichelings) Rice, Wheat, and Barley: all fruits
which be sweet and cold, as Apples, Cherries, Pingles (whether they be
confected or not) are to be refrained. And he must chiefly beware of all that
which provoke neesing, and the cough. There is nothing better for his drink,
then clear wine of a good taste, and that is meetly strong, but a little at
once. But they that drink no wine, or have no wine, may use from October unto
March this following: Take Verueine, Celendine, Rue, Eyebright, of each one
quarter of an ounce, sees them in twelve quarts of water, until the third
part be consumed, put 14. pound of honey unto it: sees it again until about
the third part be sodden away, always skumming it, then strain it through a
cloth, and keep it stopped close in a pot. Now if the sick person desire it,
then may wine (that is meet for the eyes) the fifth or sixth part be tempered
amongst it. By this drink has been perceived much amendment, and that in
ancient folks who had a dark sight have been helped therewith. Also Hydromel,
which is honey water or mead, is much commended for this, without any addition.
Every one may diminish or increase the quantity of the honey even as it
pleases him best.

For as much as concerns purging, which is exceeding needful, he must know
to direct him according to the time of the year, otherwise in winter then in
summer, otherwise in the spring of the year then in harvest, or fall of the
leaf, which were too long to rehearse at this present, and therefore we will
recommend that to the Physicians. But there are to be commonly used Pilulae
Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, Sine quibus, De hiera Composita, Lucis, of the
confections Hiera Picra, Benedicta laxatiua, and Hiera longodion. The Clisters
are to be decocted with the common herbs, and tempered with one ounce of
Hiera. Further it is then commanded to take in winter a piece of confected
Ginger: in like manner also after dinner and supper to use one of the tabulats
following: Take Spec. de Xylo, Aloe three drag. Diacinamomi one drag. white
Sugar four ounces, sees them with Fennel water, and cast Tabulates thereof
of a meetly bigness.

And if he begin to perceive any clearenesse, he must in the beginning of March
drink of this decoction following four ounces always four hours before
meat in the morning: first, take Ginger, white Pepper, Calmus, of each one
drag. flowers of Eyebright, Balsam wood, of each a quarter of an ounce, three
cleansed Hermodactils, stamp them all together, and sees them in three pints
of water, until two parts be consumed. Secondly, take the juice of Fennel,
common ley which is not sharp, of each two ounces, Tutia prepared with the
urine of a manchild one drag. and a half: set this the space of 20. days in
the Sun, and use it as shall be declared hereafter. Thirdly, take juice of
Roses one drag. common ley, Eyebright water, of each one ounce, set it (as is
said) in the Sun, and make the eyes therewith moist every morning and evening
two hours before meat: use also the juice of Roses alone, anoint therewith
the forehead and the temples of the head.

Before supper he is to take all the spring time a quarter of an ounce of
Diacorum. Fourthly, take Gall, Masticke, sealed earth, the juice of Sloes, of
each one dragm. Sandaraca one ounce, the juice of Roses as much as is needful
to steep the same in: bray it all together in a mortar until it be meetly
thick: annoint therewith always every third day when you go to bed, the
forehead, and the temples of the head.

Fifthly, take Mace, Eybright, of each one drag. and a half, Lignum Aloe one
quarter of an ounce, Fennel, Comin, Ameos, of each half a drag. Amber two
scrup. Sees this all together in a pint of Fennel water unto the half: take
always four ounces at once tempered with Sugar: drink thereof four times a
week, three hours before meat.

In the summer you are to use this following every morning, at the least every
second day, then must you chew (but not swallow) a piece of Masticke and
Cucubes. Item, take Fennel, Celendine, Rue, the juice of Roses of each three
ounces, Sugarcandie, white Sugar, of each six ounces, Sugar pennets, four
ounces, of Fennel seed, Licorice, Violets, Roses, Eyebright, of each one
ounce, Pistaces three drag. that have been steeped five days in Eyebright
water, and be dried again: powne them all to powder. The Sugar is to be sodden
unto a Sirupe for to make a confection thereof, and take thereof every morning
about half an ounce. Secondly take the juice of Verueine two ounces, the juice
of Roses, of Fennel, water wherein Licorice has been sodden, of each two
ounces, the gall of a Pickrell one drag. temper it, and set it 15. days in the
Sun. This Collyrium is to be put once or twice into the eyes before meat, or
at least moisten them therewith, for it is very good and sure.

In the beginning of harvest, and after purging, one must use to chewe
sometimes Calmui, otherwhiles Nutmegs, Galingall, or as much Agaricus as the
bigness of a bean: spew out the slime (as is said) and then use the
confection with the salve of the forehead.

A plaster for the head: Take clean Laudanum half an ounce, Rosen one
quarter of an ounce, Celendine, Lignum Aloes, of each one drag. Cloves half a
drag. melt the two first in sharp Vinegar, temper them afterward with strong
Wine, and let them all sees thick with the herbs: put the spice unto it, and
make a plaster thereof, and spread it on lether, cover it with red Syndall,
make it that it be as large til it come over the eyes: this warmeth, dries
moderately, and strengthens the brains. This powder following may also be
strewed upon the head, take Lignum Aloes, Eyebright, wild Time, Hysope,
Stechas, of each one drag. Mace three quarters of an ounce, Violets one drag.
and a half, powne each of them by themselves, and temper them well: thereof
strew upon the head always two hours after supper, on the top of the crown
about the weight of a scruple, and that once in three or four days: the same
helps much. Or take this powder following: Lignum Aloes, Cloves, Cardamome,
of each half a drag. Amber, Eyebright, Fennel, flowers of Celendine, Roses, of
each one scrup. Mace one drag. make thereof a fine powder, and use it as
before: but take not more then six grains thereof at one time, and when you
will strew more upon it, then first brush off the former.

Item, wind small stamped Marioram in a piece of silk, and smell oftentimes
thereto, fume also your head or hat oftentimes with Lignum Aloes over the fire.

There may also sometime be used drying head ley, whereof every where many be
discovered. Famous Physicians do also require to take every month an ounce and
three quarters of Hiera Piera, tempered with Fennel water, and that without
any fear, for that it is a gentle medicine. There may be taken every month in
the stead of the other, two scruples of the powder of Centorie, with Fennel
water, and fast six hours after it.

With the things that are to be dropped in, one must go to work very
prouidently, and that not carelessly, but only in great need, and when the
body is well cleansed. Amongst the same be these commended, which are also the
least: Take the juice of Fennel well cleansed two ounces, let one dragme of
Salgemma be dissolved therein, put three or four times a day one drop thereof
into the eye. Or take the juice of Fennel as it is, or that which is thick
one dragme, bruise it in an ounce of the water of Eyebright, use it as before.
For this are also good the gals of ravening birds, and also of Fesants,
Partridges, and such like, which eat no flesh. This simple Collyrium following
is very much commended: Take the gall of a Pickerell one quarter of an ounce,
Salgemma half a scruple; let them melt together. In like manner this
following: Take the fresh liver of a sownd Bucke being washed, prick it well
through, and fill it with long Pepper, Fennel and Eyebright powder, of each a
like much: put it on a spit, and let it roast by a gentle fire, receive the
juice that droppeth from it in a clean pot, and use it as a Collyrium.

Or take in the end of April the juice of Fennel, stop it tight in a glass,
and set the same fifteen days in the sun: afterward strain it through a
cloth, and temper Aloes unto it six ounces, one ounce of Lignum Aloes beaten
small: let it afterward stand fifteen days in the sun, and strain it again
through a cloth, and use it as is rehearsed already.

This following is also many times well approved. Take Swallows heads, burn
them to ashes in a covered pot; take one quarter of an ounce thereof, clarified
honey three ounces, the juice of Fennel one ounce; temper them all together in
a glass, stop them tight, and sees them in water unto the half: use thereof
morning and evening, and before and after meat, one drop.

Item burn Fennel stalks to ashes, power lie upon it, wash therewith the eyes
and eyelids, for it is very good. It is likewise also good that each one use
his own urine, or that of a man child.

Forasmuch then as for these diseases there be many kinds of remedies
described, therefore may one choose that which likes him best, and to follow
all that one finds to do good, for there are not so many described that they
should altogether be used, but because that one might choose thereof, and use
only all that one may get most easily.

Of the Skin of the Eye.. 13.
IT is declared in the beginning, that out of old Catar acts there does easily
engender a skin, and the star, which will take away the sight; whereof we now
mean to write: there be therefore commonly two kinds of them discovered by
the Physicians; as the red and the white. The red do the Arabians name Sebet,
which comes of abundance of blood in the small veins of the eyes, which
does spread it self abroad over the whole eye, so that it seems to be a red
cloth; whereof insueth a great itch. The patient can abide by no means any
light, nor sun, nor fire. This disease will be sometimes also (as is
reported) inherited from the parents, but it infecteth not any body else. It is
grievous and tedious to be cured, it so be that the manual operation be not
used used thereto. For this, one of the chiefest things is to lead an ordered
life, to use that which is good, and to eschew that which is ill, like as is
sufficiently showed in the 12.. and is meet for this purpose. For purging are
the Pillulae Cechiae or such like requisite. Also for this is advised to open
the head vein: And for the itch, to wash the eyes with water wherein Roses,
Sorrel and Mallows are decocted. Or you may prepare this powder: take fresh
eg shells, that have been infused nine days in vinegar, afterward sees them a
good space in the same vinegar, dry them in the shadow, stamp and bruise the
same: this powder is to be used oftentimes in the eyes.

Some do temper amongst it Sarcocolla, Aloe, Ginger, Gum, of each the third
part of the eg shells, and make it with Eybright water unto a Collyrium: It may
be used in manner of a powder, being beaten small.

Item take Ceruise which is washed nine times in Rosewater, one drag. burnt
Copper, Gummi Dragagant, prepared Sarcocolla, Beuer cod, Aloe, Frankincense,
Opium, prepared Pearls, Camfere, of each a drag. temper this with the juice of
Celendine, make your hands fat with the oil of bitter almonds, and make
trocisces thereof, the weight of half a dragme. Afterward dissolve one of
them in Fennel water, and when you will use it, put some thereof into the eyes:
it cleanses them, and takes away the skin from the eyes.

Item make this powder following, which is good to take off the white skin when
it is but new: the same is also good for running and sore eyes. Take Ginger,
Pepper, Mirobalani Indi, and of the yellow Mirobalans, of each five drag. Aloes
one drag. and a half, Cuttle bone three quarters of an ounce, Antimonie three
drag. Cassia wood and Cloves, of each half an ounce: make all this unto a
subtle powder, and let it be blown into the eyes. And if so be that these
foresaid things do not help, then must the skin be plucked off; whereof it is
not our meaning here to show the manner.

Vngula.
Now as concerning the white skin of the eyes, which the Physicians do call
Vngulam, which is a nail; for that it is likened to a nail of the finger,
which is of nature between skin and flesh, and grows from the corner of
the eye toward the middle of the same: Of these some be hard, and some be
soft, yellowish, darkish and reddish, and have some society with the foresaid
Sebell, whereof some be light, and others very hardly cured by manual
operation. They do grow out of all corners and sides of the eyes, until that
in part or in whole they cover the apple of the eye. The cause of this are many
tough and thick humors, like as one may see in horses and four footed beasts
mo, which are fed with gross food. Now what one is to beware of in this
sickness, has been before beclared at large in the 12..

For this (like as also in all other) is very good the letting of blood and
purging, with all other things which repel this defluxion, for the beginning of
the cure, like as is sufficiently showed in the former instructions. Now
henceforth we will go and discourse of the smallest and newest skins.

Take Mallows, Cammomill, Hollihocke roots, Lineseede, of each half a M. let
it seethe well, and receive the vapor into the eyes: afterward use the
Collyrium which is described before in the eight. and begins thus: Take
beaten Bloudstone, etc.

Item, take Vinum Punicinum, put a good deal of Rue therein, and let it stand
in a glass the whole Summer in the Sun, drop thereof into the eyes. The same
does drive away the new skin, and all darkness of the eyes. The juice of
Celendine, of Beetes, of Fennel, of Verueine, each a part or mixed, being put
into the eyes, do take away the heat of the eyes, and all darkness of the
same.

Or take the flowers of Cicorie, as many as you will, put them into a glass
stopped, cover the glass with thick dow, put it then into an oven. The water
which runs from these flowers, use to the skin of the eyes. This also may be
approved: Take Juniper leaves, and the berries that grow thereon: distill
water thereof, and put it into the eyes. Item, take fine honey, bruise some
Camfere amongst it and use it as all the rest.

Break a fresh piece of Beuer cod in pieces, wherein you shall find some
moisture: temper this with wine, and put it into the eyes.

For this is also good, great Ants bruised in pieces, and made to pap with the
fat of Quails, Myrrh, and Fennel water.

Take six grains of Pepper, and as much Allume, vinegar one ounce, sees it
unto the third part, and keep it for daily use.

Take Grasshoppers, but not the green, nor them that be big, nor too little:
bind them on a thread, and dry them in the Sun, then beat them to powder,
bind them in a cloth, and lay it all night in wine, drop thereof into the eye;
it is very sharp. Others do but make a cloth wet therein, and so lay it upon
the eye, and that is surer. Some do use Elderne pith.

Item take the innermost skins of the mawe of a Sparrow, half an ounce,
Verbascum seeds three drag. beat them very small, and make it into a salve with
the oil of sweet Almonds: afterward take Verdigrease, white Vitrioll,
Salarmoniacke, burnt Copper, of each half a scrup. long, white, and black
Pepper, green earthen potsheards, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each one dragme,
Bucks gals one quarter of an ounce: Powne very small what is to be powned,
temper them with some honey, and put of the juice of Marioram or water unto it,
that thou may use it for a Collyrium. There may many be found wherein the
venime Orpigmentum is put, the which I do not willingly rehearse; because that
where any thick and old skin does cover the eye, it is to be taken off with
the needle, so that it is unnecessary to vex the eyes with any such perilous
things.

Of the mists and clouds of the Eyes.. 14.
THe Nebula (which is also called by reason of her whiteness Albugo) is
diverse: Nebula. Albugo.
it has also other causes than the foresaid white eye skins.

There be two sorts of these: the first is meetely thick, like the white of a
sodden egg to look unto: the other is much subtiller, and is like to a cloud,
and it is also easier to cure than the other: both proceed through the
defluxion of moistures out of the head, and will be according to the nature of
that moisture, thick or subtle. There comes also otherwhiles a third sort
into the eyes, as of some kind of bruise, or old impostume, or of any blisters
of the eyes, which are a long time in curing.

Nevertheless it has been found, if young children through the pockes do
retain any such clouds, and the eyes with the body be waxen greater; that
the same clouds do lessen in time. The thick whiteness is thus to be cured:
Every morning fasting are the eyes to be fomented with clear warm water, or
with water of these herbs following, whereof we mean to use the juice: Take
the juice of corn Roses, the juice of Centorie, temper them together, or use
each by it self. Item take the dried juice of Celendine three dragm. Ameos one
quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof.

Item take white Sugarcandie: each put apart in the eye, is very good. Take
Pumicestone, prepared Sarcocolla, Aristologie, white Sugar, of each a like
much: make a powder thereof. Cuttle bones alone, or tempered with one of the
foresaid, are also very profitable: woman's milk after the foresaid bones,
milkt in the eyes, and used often, mollifieth the white skins. This following
is also highly commended: Take Pumicestones, Cuttle bones, prepared Sarcocolla,
Aristologie, red Coral, Boreas, of each one drag. Sugarcandie three quarters
of an ounce, make thereof a subtle powder. Take the burnt shells of Sea crabs,
prepared Tutia, and Sugar: beat them as small as may be. Now to the end the
eyes may be cleansed, and the clouds taken away, this honey following is to be
put therein: Take clarified honey two ounces, the juice of Centorie, the juice
of Fennel, of each an ounce and a half, let it sees somewhat, and scum it
till it be clear: drop thereof on the white cloud of the eye. Will you have
the honey more sharp? then put thereto three dragmes of Boreas.

Take one part of Swallows dung, Honey three parts, temper them together: this
will apparently help, but it is sharp like as is said already.

Dispersion, or contraction of the eye beams or sight.. 15.
BEcause that these parts or skins of the apples of the eye (called Ragodis
and Vuea) are sometimes disgregated through inward and outward occasions, so
that they be stretched out even to the white of the eye, whereby the sight is
not a little hurt: it is therefore first to be marked, whether this disease be
from the nativity, or proceed of the great pain in the head, Cephalaea. If
it be borne with one, there is then small hope to have it cured: but if it be
caused through any other occasions, as falls, blows, thrusts, many humors that
disperse themselves abroad, or of some former impostume that has not long been
past, then it is still to be helped: first, by letting of blood in the head
vein on the contrary side where the disease is afterward through purging
with the pills of Cochiae, and through a well governed diet. This is one of
the best medicines, for it consumes all humidities, not only of the head but
also of the whole body. Afterward one may make a plaster for it with fine
Bolus, Myrtle seed, of each half an ounce, Linseede beaten small two ounces,
Rose water, and the juice of Barberies: or take Nightshade, Plantaine, the
juice of Housleeke, of each a like much, and lay it over the eyes with a cloth.
Item, wet a cloth in Rosewater wherein Tutia has been infused, and lay it over
the eyes: for this is cauterization in the neck very much commended: but if
this disgregation of the sight be small, then it will be easily cured with the
Sieff of Gals, which herafter shall follow, which foresaid Sieff of Gals, or de
Fellibus is thus prepared.

(...) de Felli^^s.
Take the Gals of these aforenamed beasts, to wit, of Cranes, Pickrels, Buckes,
Hobbies, Sparhaukes, or of any other ravening birds whatsoever, of each two
drag. and a half, Euphorbium, Coloquint, Sagapenum, of each one drag. melt the
gum, powne all that is to be powned, and temper it with the gals, and with two
ounces of the juice of Fennel, and use it like any other Collyrium: It is also
specially good for those that are purblind, whereof shall be hereafter spoken.

But if the star or beam of the eye be dispersed because it is hurt, there
is then no great care to be taken, for the same is easily to be helped: make
this plaster following. Take beans and Barley meal, of each one quarter of an
ounce, oil of Roses half an ounce, the yolke of an egg, temper it well with
the juice of Endive, as much as is needful.

Take Nightshade, Housleeke, and Rosewater, of each one ounce, and the white of
an egg, make a cloth wet therein, and lay it upon the eyes. For this is also
good, the gall of a Bucke, ashes of the burnt head of a Magpie, of each a like
quantity, tempered with Honey and the juice of Celendine, and so laid upon
the eye: this is commended for a very approved receipt.

And if so be that the apple of the eye be contracted and wax smaller, it is
then caused through drought; and although naturally the small apple of the eye
be good, yet is the diminishing of the same very bad. For this are good moist
meats to be used, to bath in sweet waters, to use oftentimes woman's milk, and
drop of the foresaid mildest Collyrium into the eyes.

Of the extuberation of the Eyes, as if they would fall out.. 16.
THis is caused through many occasions, as for that the head is full of humors,
or that the eyes of themselves do swel through a full body, and otherwhiles
through wind, and otherwhiles through some kind of impostume, if there be much
blood or phlegm with it, whereof mention is before made in the 8.. It may
happen also that the sinews of the muscles about the eyes are feebled and
lamed thorough some superfluous humor of the head, like as it may well happen
by reason of the great pain of the head through extreme vomiting, and strong
straining of going to stool, of hard coughing, and of such like strong
motions: and this happens especially in the dropsy, if it come through
fullness of the body, then does the patient feel a strong pricking and pain
about the eyes: if through wind, then is the pricking not so strong, but rather
contracting: if it come through much blood, that do the red veins declare,
with heat, Cholera makes pricking and smarting. If this infirmity be new,
then it is easily to be helped (in case that it is not caused through the
dropsy) and that only through good government of diet. But if this infirmity
be but small, then lay cotton on the eye, and tie it to a linen band: eat and
drink but little, sleep much, and refrain from all labor. But if the grief
be much, and with great pain, open the head vein, and purge with Hiera and
with Pills ordained in Ophthalmia. Set boxing cups with picking on high upon the
shoulders, foment the eyes with wool which is dipped in warm vinegar and
water, or with water and vinegar wherein Pomegranate blossoms and peeles,
Gals, and Sumach is decocted, and make the whole face wet therewith. And if
therewith be great heat, then make a plaster of the herb Shepherds purse,
Plantaine, and Housleek, and so apply it upon the eye. But if it proceed
through weakness of the sinews, then purge the head, use Gargarismes, and the
Salues that hereafter are taught in Paralysi and contraction of the mouth, make
a fomentation of warm herbs, or this plaster: take Frankincense, Masticke,
Cipers nuts, and the leaves of each a like much beaten, tempered with oil of
Cammomill; but if you will put some of the juice of Sloes unto it you may.

Of eyes that be burnt.. 17.
IF any bodies face be burnt, so that one have fear of his eyes, and that they
do swell, then take water of Verueine, steep Quince kernels therein, wring the
slime through a cloth, and anoint the face therewith, and the eyelids: but
look for that which is written before of white and red eyes, what cools all
kinds of inflammations, or that is declared in the first part.

Whenever any be stricken in or upon the eye.. 18.
TAke powned Wormwood, temper it with the brayed white of an egg, and lay it
over the eye.

Item, take the juice of Verueine, the white of eggs well brayed, lay it on the
eyes with a wet cloth: look also thereof in the sixth Chapter and the first. of
the humors of the eyelids.

If any thing be fallen into the eyes.. 19.
IF so be that the eye (through any thing that might fall therein) be bruised
or perished, that must forthwith be helped, to the end that it do not
inueterate: for this it is advised to take fresh clear water in the mouth, and
spout the same into the sore eye so long, until all that whatsoever be in it
may be washed out.

Yet woman's milk is more commodious, sprouted into it out of the breast. This
may also be done with white wine, for it causes the eyes to run better; and if
one wring thereon, then comes that which is fallen into it with more ease out
of it again.

Or take a piece of white Rosen, let it be made warm in the sun, or after
another manner, then draw it very softly on the apple of the eye, then does it
remain hanging thereon.

This operation or power is attributed also unto Rubies and Saphires being
stroked in the eyes.

Roll the upper eyelid about, and wipe it with a soft linen cloth, then does
it remain hanging on the cloth.

Item, take Betony, Celendine, Eyebright, Hyssope, Penniroyall, of each a like,
sees them in meely water, and wash the eyes with this whilst that it is warm.

How to cure the diminishing, feebleness, and darkness of the eyes.. 20.
THe sight is many times of some disease of the eyes (like as in Ophthalmia is
declared) lessened, and also enfeebled, as the shining of the Sun, looking
glasses, shining copper, lightnings, fire, long darkness, watching, the
beholding of white things, like as when one walks far in the snow, cold
air, or that chalk, dust, or any things else come into the eyes, through much
looking upon small things, to let much blood, or that one does it not if he be
accustomed, also through an unchaste life. Further, the eyes are much weakened
with great laskes, great labor, odoriferous things, and specially the
Basilicon, of which we are not to omit this admirable work of nature, that is,
if one eat too much of this, then will the sight be weakened, where
notwithstanding the juice thereof dropped into the eyes does strengthen the sight
and dries up the moisture.

These patients must beware of all gross meats, as cheese, old flesh,
coleworts: also from overmuch eating and drinking, and from fasting. Also all
such diminishing of the sight is caused through great pain of the head,
swimming and great heat, which dries too much. Also through cold moistures,
which obstructeth the sinews of the sight. There are three kinds of the
weakness of the sight, the first of all diminishes, when a thing is seen
imperfect, and when it is thought to be less; the second kind is a spoiled or
corrupted sight, whereas one sees any thing otherwise then it is, like as
happens in the disease Scotoma. Thirdly, it is a contracted sight, when one
can discern nothing by the sight, like as in the blindness. For all these
aforesaid infirmities, shall the patient first use preparatiue potions, and
purge with the pills Cochiae or Stomachicae, and also use Clisters which draw
all humors downwards. Fennel seed used in all meats is especial good both
before and after meat: then as it commonly happens, that the feebleness of
the eyes do proceed of a bad full stomach, which does cause many bad vapors in
the head; then do the ancient Physicians advise, that these sick persons shall
be caused to vomit, for that will dry and cleanse the stomach from all bad
corruptions and intolerable moistures. Also there be drying powders to be put
into the eyes, whereof there be many before described. But if with this
imperfection of the sight, there be an abatement or consumption of the body,
like as one sees in all those that recover after a languishing sickness, they
must be fed with good meat, for that if one be fasting or hungry, the pain
will be the greater and more forcible. Also he is to be let sleep well, and
given wine to drink, to make the head oftentimes moist with warm water, or to
bath: but beware that he sweat not too much.

In the nose and ears is he to drop the oil of sweet Almonds, and besprinkle
the eyes oftentimes with young woman's milk.

Hereafter do follow certain medicines: first a government of life, for that a
good order of diet is no less of importance for this, then it is in any other
sickness. First of all one is above all the other foresaid things to abstain
from very clear air, unmeasurable Venery, reading small prints or writings,
etc. from going to sleep with a full stomach, from all salt and strong
meats, from drunkenness, and all that replenisheth the head. If the cause be
moisture, then is likewise to be feared bathing, much sleep, letting blood,
cupping, and vaporous meats, new Wine, Beans, Pease, and other pottages,
Lettice, Vinegar, and Radishes, much fish, Pears, Apples, and all moist
fruits, especially after meat. In like manner all moist, dark and mistie
weather, smoke, wind, dust, moist dwellings, going idle, unleavened bread, old
and gross flesh, and all that makes gross blood. On the contrary side, there
be many commodious things that strengthen the weak sight, as the sight of
green fields, trees, the precious stone Smaragdus, green glass, green
linen, and such like more, which are to be set before our eyes, to the end it
may thereby be quickened. In like manner also all blew colors, and all other
orient colors, as to look into a steel looking-glass, in the clear water,
gold, the stars of heaven, the precious Saphir stone, flowers of Borage, of
Eyebright, and specially of Larks spurs, which are chiefly commended.

(...).
The like operations are ascribed unto the Wine and the conserve of Eyebright,
and that not without reason, for that they be both forcible for to strengthen
the sight, and to make it clear and fresh, so that many old folks through the
use of these have continued and strengthened their sight with them. They do
also deopilate the obstruction of the Milt and Liver being daily used, they
cleanse the stomach, and withstand all agues that proceed out of the stomach:
for what they serve else, and how they are to be prepared, the Register shall
make mention. Therefore has the wine of Eybright also, and the conserve of the
same, not their names in vain: for they have like power in strengthening of
the sight, to dry the moistnes of the brains, and to clear all dark sights.

Further, it is very commodious that one do kembe well once a day, especially
ancient folks: youths are to wash their eyes often with fresh water, also to
suffer hunger and thirst sometimes, and to drink sweet water. In like manner
all that is meet for the strengthening of the memory, is also very fit for the
sight, as hereafter shall be showed: and all that is accounted good for the
five senses, as the sight, the hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling. Clear
fair air is always good, bread well raised, good wine soberly drunk, also
light meats which fume not into the head. This is now sufficiently written of
the order of dict. Now we will come to the medicines, and waters for the eyes.
The water of the Emperor Frederick^ for (...) sight.
Hereunder is one which was ordained and made for the Emperor Frederick the
third, the which unto this present day is very highly commended, and is thus
prepared: Take Betony, Rue, Verueine, Celendine, Eyebright, Roses, all of them
green, of each six good handfuls, Aloe one ounce, long pepper, Cloves, of
each half a drag. some also put thereto three handfuls of Woodbind and the
flowers. This being all chopped, is to be distilled through a glass helm:
drop thereof into the eyes, and anoint all the face therewith. Or take the
juice of Fennel and of Verueine, each by it self, or mixed amongst other, drop
it into the eyes, lay it over them with a cloth, it takes away the dimnesse.
There is also described before in this Chapter and first. ^ water for the eyes,
of Celendine decocted with honey, which is specially good for all darkness of
the eyes.

Another. Take Fennel, Eyebright, and Rose water, of each one ounce,
Sarcocolla, Tu^^a both prepared, Sugarcandy, of each one scup. the gall of a
Pickerell, five leaves of beaten gold: put these together in a glass, and let
it sees a while in hot water in a glass, and use it as a Collyrium.

This preserves the sight maruellously.

Item take Fenegreeke, Hollihock roots, of each two ounces, cleanse them well,
and let them sees well in clear water with a mild fire unto the half: wring
them out hard and strain them through a cloth, tempered with Aloe, a quarter
of an ounce, Sugarcandy or Sugar of Roses one ounce, strain it with the Rose
water through a cloth, and let it sees together unto a sirupe: preserve it
stopped close in a glass, and use it as other eye-waters. Take prepared Tutia
one drag. white Amber half a dragme, Camfere half so much, fennel water and
Rose water, of each two ounces, temper them together. The water that is
gathered of the vapor of hot bread maruellously cleereth dim eyes: Take Rose
water as much as you please, Sugarcandy as much also; let it stand before that
you use it a certain time in the Sun. All gals of ravening birds, as also of
Partridges, of Bulls, Hares, Wolves, Foxes, and above all the Buckes gall does
dry the eyes and sharpen the sight. But one of these or more must be decocted
with much juice of fennel and clarified honey (once as much more as the other)
and dropped into the eyes. Take the gals of Partridges, Balsam oil, of each one
quarter of an ounce, the juice of Celendine one dragme, temper and use them as
the other. The ancient Physicians have highly praised this following: Take the
juice of Pomegranates which be neither lower nor sweet, two ounces: sees them
in a silver vessel unto the half: then add clarified honey one ounce, let it
boil well, strain it through a cloth, let it stand certain days in the
sun, and drop it into the eyes. Item the juice of sower and sweet
Pomegranates, of each two ounces, set it in the Sun two months, then strain
it, and temper thereto one drag. of Aloes, long pepper half a drag. And if you
desire it to be more drying and biting, put thereto one scrup. of Sal
Armoniack: the older this is, the better.

Hereafter follow certain simples which strengthen the sight, as the juice of
roasted Onions tempered with honey dropped into the eyes, the brains of flitter
mice or Bats tempered with honey and dropped therein, the ashes of the same blown
into the eyes especially in the beginning. Rue has an especial property in
the eyes, is good eaten, and the juice of it tempered with the juice of fennel
and honey dropped into them. Hyssope used in meat is also very meet for the
sight, Rapes and sodden young Doves are very good, also their broth drunken: so
are also Swallows and Magpies eaten, good for the strengthening of the sight,
and the ashes of them tempered with honey and put into the eyes; Calmus raw and
confected is very meet; burnt Coral dries and consumes all moisture of the
eyes: Acatia strengthens and sharpeneth the sight, and expels the
redness; Almonds are also very good. All odoriferous herbs, as Lauander,
Rosemary, Gilloflowers, Roses, and all pleasant smelling fruits, are good for
the eyes.

Pomanders. Take Rosemary, Nep, Marioram, Penniroyall, of each one drag.
Pomanders fit for a bad sight.
Lignum Aloes, Marioram gentle, and Mace, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Muscus, Ambra, of each two grains, make thereof a powder, bind it in a piece
of red silk, and smell oftentimes to it. They may also use the same which have
the disease of the Cataract, whereof is much admonished before.

The ancient Physicians were of opinion, if one anointed oftentimes the eylids
with Coral, precious stones and gold, or did behold them, that it were to
strengthen and clear the sight.

This powder following of Rasis is much commended for to strengthen the sight
therewith: Take prepared Tutia ten drag. make this to paste with the fresh
juice of Marioram gentle when it has stood a night and be well settled:
afterward let it dry well, beat it again and put Ginger unto it, long and
black pepper, and Celendine, of each a drag. Sal Armoniack half a drag. al
beaten small, and maid moist with the clear juice of fennel: Let it dry
again, and so preserve it. When you will occupy it, then beat it unto an
impalpable powder, and put it into the eye.

This powder following is to be strewed upon the head: Take Cloves, Liguum
Aloes, Betonica, Sandaraca, burnt Iuory, Styrax Calamita, of each half a drag.
make thereof a powder, strew all the head therewith. As oftentimes as you will
use it, then kembe the head before, to the end the first may come off,
afterward use twice a month when you go to sleep one quarter of an ounce of
the trocisces of Diambra, hold them long in the mouth until they do melt.

Item take Cumin which is steeped one night in vinegar, and afterward dried,
Annis seeds, prepared Coriander, of each three ounces, Fennel seed six
ounces: temper them all together. You may also let them be confited with Sugar,
and use it after meat: this strengthens the stomach, stays the vapors
from gathering upwards toward the head, and consumes al cold matter in the
stomach and the head.

A powder to be used with meat.
TAke Silver mountain, Ginger, Cucubes, Cloves, long pepper, Nutmegs, the
roots of Celendine, Diptamer roots, of each half an ounce, prepared Cumine,
Fennel seed, Annise seeds, flowers of Eyebright with the leaves, of each three
quarters of an ounce, prepared Coriander one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much
as you please: this is to be beaten small together and used daily in meat; it
strengthens the sight, and defends against blindness.

This following is also to be observed for a special mean, that one must
gargarise every ten days: two days together in the morning and evening eight
or ten times together. Take Marierom gentle, one handful, Licorice half an
ounce, sees them in a pint of water unto the half: take a good cruse full
thereof, temper amongst it one dragme and a half of Hiera Picra: gargarise
with it (as is said) it is very requisite, but bitter.

After supper take one of these Tabulates: Take Spec Diambrae one dragme and a
half, Eyebright, Celendine, Fennel, Verueine, of each one scrup. the seed of
Rue, of Silver mountain, of each half a drag. Sugar five ounces: sees all
these with Eyebright water, and cast Tabulates of it. Lastly, take Rue,
Celendine, Eyebright water, of each two ounces, Fennel and the juice of
Verueine, of each one ounce, the gall of a Pickerell three drag. Lignum Aloes
beaten small half a drag. the seed of Rue, of Celendine, Marioram gentle, of
each one dragme, temper them with the foresaid water, stop it tight in a
glass, and sement it with dow: afterward set it in an oven when the bread is
taken out, and let it stand a whole day therein. The next day take of the dow
again, and set it the space of twelve days in the Sun; afterward strain it
through a tight cloth, but wring it not out, and keep it in a stopped glass,
whereof put every morning and evening one drop in the eye, and lie upon your
back, then shall you perceive an apparent amendment of the sight.

Pillul^e, Pills.
TAke white beaten Eyebright half an ounce, Caroway sodden in vinegar and
dried, Marioram gentle three quarters of an ounce: Lignum Aloes, Indie Spica,
of each one ounce, the seeds of Sorrel five scrup. temper them with the Iulep
of Roses, whereof you are to take at one time a half or a whole drag. once in
three or four days in the evening when you go to bed.

Will you then make a powder thereof? put thereto prepared Coriander, Cinnamom
and Fennel, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please. This
may you take after supper.

The con^^ction of Montagnana for a bad sight.
This following is a costly confection, and strengthens the sight, therefore
it is called of Montagnana, Electuarium Occulistae, because it is very
profitable for the abating of the sight which proceeds through flegmaticall
humors; for besides that it strengthens the brains, it restores the lost
sight again, and makes also the spirits of the sight subtiller and stronger.

Take Silver mountain seed, Eyebright, fennel, and Cucubes, of each a drag.
Cardamome, Mace, of each one drag. and a half, the seed of Celendine, of Rue,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Rosemary one ounce, Annis seed, Lignum Aloes,
Caroway, Consolida Sarracenica, of each half an ounce, sugar or honey as much
as is needful for to make thereof a confection.

Another.
TAke dried Betony, Celendine, Eyebright, Hyssope, Penniroyall, of each one
drag. fennel, Silver mountain, Annis, prepared Coriander and Marioram gentle
seeds, Basil seeds, Cardamome, Cinnamom, Ginger, Galingale, Nutmegs, Cloves,
long Pepper, Lignum Aloes, Masticke, Spikenard, of each half a drag. preserved
Citron pills three drag. conserues of Borage, of Rosemarie, of each one quarter
of an ounce, Sugar decocted in Fennel and Rosewater as much as is needful for
to make a confection. This patient shall take also after purging the second or
third day one drag. of Treacle, Aurea Alexandrina, or Mithridate. Or make a
potion: Take half a dragm. of Treacle, break it in wine, water of Rue or
Fennel, and take it once every week: yet this is best of all that one may use
for a weak sight, preserved Chebuli eaten fasting does much strengthen the
sight; some chew every morning Juniper berries, spetting it afterward into the
hands, and letting the fume go into the eyes: the which can also strengthen the
sight much. The same virtue has also chewed Annis, Cumine, and especially
Fennel seed, whether they be confected or no.

All later and ancient writers do commend this remedy following, as well for
the strengthening of the sight, as for those that be purblind: Take the liver
of a Bucke, take off the Gall, cut broad pieces out of it, lay therein whole
long Pepper, cover it with another piece of liver and Pepper as before, thus
continuing till all the pieces be laid one upon another, so that above and
beneath be nothing but liver. Put this then into an oven, and dry it well
away: then take of the Pepper, beat it small, and mix some Muscus amongst it,
and with the moisture which droppeth from the liver, moisten therewith the
powder, and make losinges thereof, preserve it until you have need of it,
then temper it with Eyebright water, or such like, and use it as the other. To
these spices of medicines are three kinds of commodities ascribed: the first to
drop fatness into the eyes: the second to receive the warm vapor into the
eyes: thirdly, that the patient eat thereof many times a year, every time
three days together.

One more (which is almost like unto it) does hereafter follow: Roast a hogs
Liver, wet the eyes with the dampe of this rostmeate, and rub the fatness on
the eyelids.

Take a slip of Rue, drink the infusion of it at your meal, it is also very
good for this.

Take Cinnamom, Cloves, Mace, of each a like much, power Malmesey upon it, and
use it as you please.

When one has then used a good deal of these foresaid things, and there be
yet perceived much more moisture in the eyes: there is sometimes to be used for
to dry the brains of this juice following, drawing it up through the nose, to
wit, of Marioram gentle and Dane weed.

There are also twice a week two of these pills following to be taken after
supper: Take Paula lucis, Rubarbe, of each one scrup. and a half, and make
thereof five or seven pills.

Of all those that after the rising of the Sun, do see nothing at all, or
very badly.. 21.
THis infirmity of the sight is of two kinds. The first is when one can see
well in the day time, but against the evening and night can see nothing or very
badly. The other to the contrary, when one in the day time does see little or
badly, moving the eyes up and down, when he does come into the clearenesse,
without holding them open, therefore be they commonly called in Dutch blind
Cats: but when it grows toward evening, then begin they to amend, and can
see much better. Both these infirmities do proceed of like causes, and
according as the spirits of the sight be formed, whereof the Philosophers do
dispute much. The Grecians do call them Nyctilopas, the Latinists Lusciosos, in
English purblind, whereof Galenus speaks generally, that it is a disease
which proceeds of no manifest cause. Others write, that it is incident rather
to black eyes then to other: what concerns the signs, they are to be
inquired of them that have this infirmity.

First, for this is reputed good, if the party be full of blood, that first of
all the head vein, afterward the veins in the corners of the eyes be opened:
others do advise to open the median and the vein in the forehead. Afterward
whether it be of a Phlegma or Melancholia, purge with the pills Cochiae or
Lucis, and then to take Mithridate or Treacle. In the eye is to be used the fat
of the Bucks liver (described before) or to temper it with a little of the
Bucks gall, or the Buckes gall alone decocted with a little vinegar, applied
likewise as aforesaid: for in this disease is most of all commended that which
comes from the Bucke or Goat. Plini^ admonishes that some have advised,
that one should wrap the Goats dung with wax, and so swallow it down. He
writes also that this blindness is to be helped with Goats blood, and it may
come thereby, for that it is said that those beasts do see as well by night as
by day: therefore it was commanded to Nycripolis to eat the Buckes and Goats
liver roasted. And how the same shall be dressed is shortly before declared, where
we have discoursed of the diminished and weak sight.

When one is waxed almost blind.. 22.
IF there fall any moisture in the eyes which makes one almost stark blind,
then it is found out by experience, that the decoction of a Viper, the head and
tail chopped off, has helped (yet the intrailes plucked out and stuffed with
Fennel seeds) like as also helps if one eat the flesh of this Serpent
boiled. This is reported of the nature of the Viper snake.

The like virtue also has the decoction of Guaiacum used after his manner or
kind, the which is not only meet for this, but also in certain confections
for the sight, which Pope Innocentius the third did send to an Abbot, who was
almost blind, and is made thus: Take Fennel seed half a pound,
Siluermountaine seed, and blew Chamedris, of each four ounces, Smallage,
Annis, Parsley seeds, Peniroyall, Hyssope, Saxifrage, Juniper berries, of each
one dragme, the seed of Stauesacre two ounces: this being beaten small with
Honey or Sugar, and a confection made thereof, and use thereof morning and
evening, and you shall see maruels.

Comes the cause of the hinderance in sight through obstructions of the
sinews whereby the sight comes into the eyes? then use the Pills Cochiae and
Lucis of each half a dragme, make 7. or 8. pills thereof, swallow them in the
morning betimes and fast five hours upon it, use them once every month.
Afterward use this confection, take Peniroyall, Rue, Betony, Celendine, of
each one handful, Saxifrage, Louage, Annis, Cammomil, Ginger, Fennel, Parsley,
Hyssop, Marioram, Siluermountaine, of each two dragmes and a half, Gallingall
half an ounce, powne all very small that is to be powned, and temper it with
Sugar which is clarified in Fennel water, it requires half a pound of Sugar
at the least, cast Tabulates of it, and then lay them upon the tongue, and let
them melt of themselves: this do and continue it the space of two or three
months, all after that the blindness is great and has long continued.

Of Squintnesse.. 23.
THis is a distractio^ of the eyes out of their natural places toward the
right or left side, upwards or downwards: the occasion of this is sometimes
through resolution of the sinews, where the whole place does draw that
infirmed unto it. Also it may be a crampe in the same sinews, whereto the
contrary the shrinking sinews do draw the whole unto them; it comes also very
well through a custom, when young children in the cradle do lie always upon
one side, and open but one eye: but if the squintnes do come through slacknesse
of the sinews or the crampe, that is seen and showed by the signs which are
described in Paralysi, or in the crampe. This disease could the ancient
Physicians heal very badly, and it is very uncertain in young children,
nevertheless we will not pretermit to show our advise for it: on the side
where the disease is put some clearenesse, to the end the eye may be drawn to
his natural place: also when it is carried about on the arm, the ancient
Physicians have used all those things which were wont in Paralysi and in the
distraction of the mouth to be adhibited.

Hydromell, honey water: how to make and use the same.. 24.
IT is before oftentimes mentioned, and therefore it is very worthy for to
describe here how to make it: The ancient Physicians took rain water and honey
decocted therewith, scumming it well, and using it for a common drink, in the
stead of water or wine, like as also it stands discovered in many places of
this book; now it is for the most part made with well water and honey. In fine,
Hydromell is no other thing but our common meade without any addition: of other
sorts of meade is spoken hereafter in the eight part.

The eight Chapter. Of the Nose.
THis is also one of the principallest outward members of the face,
artificially conjoined of sinews and gristles, and by nature ordained for many
kind of uses: for who knows not how exceeding needful it is for the life,
and for preservation of the good breath, and for discerning of al smells and
sauors: in behalf of both these two causes is the Nose set in the height of
the body, and endued with such a property that it might refresh and cool the
heart, the lights and all inward parts with continual breathing, without the
which no man lives.

Besides this it has power to discern and judge the savor of the meat: it is
set besides and above the mouth, to the end it might adiudge and give evidence
to all before it goes into the mouth, what is pleasant and what is to be
eschewed, or is necessary or hurtful: it stands also in the midst of the
face not only for a garnishing, but also for a stay or defense between both
the eyes for to defend them (as has been said before.) It is also a right pipe
or gutter to purge and cleanse thereby all the moisture of the brains and the
head; to the end there should nothing fall down upon the breast or other
principal parts that might there cause great sickness. This member is subject
also to many kind of diseases, as Impostumes, Obstructions, Rheumes, excessive
bleeding, loss of smelling, of all which and others mo, shall be hereafter
spoken.

Of Obstruction or stopping in the Nose.. 1.
THis infirmity is caused through inward or outward occasions: If the nose be
stopped through falling, striking, or thrusting; then must it swell: if it be then
swolen, then be the ways thorough which the breath and smell comes stopped:
yea also the smell otherwhiles wholly lost. It may also be well stopped through
some gross moisture, that falls out of the head and brains, which cannot
pass thorough the nose, for that the nose vents are thereby stopped. As much
as then concerns any outward brusing, there must be salues and plasters laid
upon it, like as upon other tumors. The same being healed, the vents and pores
will be open again, and the smelling restored, yet it is always good advice
to set boxing cups upon the neck and shoulders, and to lay upon the breast
brayed whites of eggs, tempered with some Camfere. But of this stopping shall
be spoken more at large hereafter, especially in the loss of the smelling.

Of the Ulcers in the nose.. 2.
THese impostumations do the Writers divide into Vlcera and Apostemata, which
we do english, Ulcers and Impostumes; the Ulcers are always dry or moist:
dry when they make hard scurse, and contrarily when they yield out much
moisture, like as if the nose were rubbed on the inside and thereby bled, and
yielded yellow, green or black matter; both proceeding of sharp, salt, and
burnt matter that descends out of the head into the nose. The signs thereof
may one easily discern: if there be pain in the nose, then is to be seen
against the bright Sun where the disease is. For this accident the patient is
to be purged with the Pills Cochiae, or Hiera, and such like. This is also a
common rule in the curing of all Ulcers, to wit: that it be begun with no
strong medicine, or that the party be purged before. Like as for example, if
the patient be plethoricke in body, and the ulcer be great, open the Median,
and let out four or five ounces of blood according to the strength of the
patient: but if the disease be not so great, then open the head vein upon the
arm or upon the hand, at all times upon that side where the disease is not,
and sometimes very well in the veins of the nose. In like manner also are cups
to be set in the neck, thereby to seduce the matter. This being done, the
patient is to use the space of eight days or six days this preparatiue
potion: take Oxysacchara (which shall be immediately hereafter described) the
sirupe of water Lillies of each three quarters of an ounce, Sorrel water, and
Fennel water, of each three quarters of an ounce, drink it lukewarm in the
morning. The purgation upon it is this.

Take half an ounce of the confection De succo Rosarum, Cassia prepared with
the water of Violets one ounce, temper all together with three ounces of Barley
water meetly warm* for otherwise it is too thick. Immediately after purging
lay this plaster following upon the nose, that it may be covered every where
with it: Take small Housleeke, and the juice of Plantaine, the juice of
shepherds purse, of each one ounce, the whites of two eggs, Camfere bruised
small four scrup. prepared Tutia, and Butchers broomeseedes of each one drag.
burnt Coral and Amber of each two scrup. Starch one ounce and a half, bruise
these together in a leaden mortar some hours together, this is to be used
three or four times a day.

Another.
PVt the juice of Tassell leaves three or four times a day into the nose, it
may be drawn up into the nose: but if you fear that it will cool too much,
then temper the third part of the juice of Betonie amongst it.

Oxysacchara.
THis kind of Sirupe may easily be made by all housekeepers, it has also great
virtue and operation, for it does consume the mixed and flegmaticke humidities
which do pinch or annoy the uppermost parts, and cause the unruly double
Tertian and quartaine Agues: Take six ounces of white Sugar, the juice of
Pomegranates four ounces, sharp Vinegar two ounces: sees them in a little
pot by a mild fire, until they be of the thickness of a common Sirupe.

Item, if there be scurfe in the nose: Then take Sallad oil, the grease of a
Capon as much as you please, and power a little molten wax amongst it, and
anoint therewith the scurfs: likewise take warm water, draw it up into the
nose certain days together, in the morning it is also good. Item, take the
gum of a Cherrie tree, the gum of a Palm tree or Dragagant, dissolve them in
Rosewater which thou will, anoint the Muscilage or slime in the nose with a
feather. Or take the marrow of an Ox bone, new wax, of each half an ounce,
oil of water Lillies one quarter of an ounce, melt and use it as before. Or
you must in stead of the oil of water Lillies, take also the oil of Roses.

Another: Take Dragagant and the seed of Fleawoort, steep them in Rosewater
and cile of Violets, anoint the nose oftentimes with this muscilage. You may
also make this salve: Take Duckes and Hens grease, the fatness of Sheep
wool, Hearts sewet, honey, of each half an ounce, burnt Mirobalans, Gals, of
each a drag temper them together. This asswageth and dries much.

In like manner this salve following is very convenient: Take oil of sweet
Almonds one ounce, oil of Roses one ounce, washed Butter, Hens grease, the
Muscilage of Dragagant, of each one quarter of an ounce, and a little wax.

Or take fresh marrow out of the Calves bones, and gum, of each one quarter of
an ounce, oil of white Camelina one ounce and a half, wax as much as is
needful. The same does also butter washed well with fair water, likewise also
decocted Hollihocks, Nightshade or Malows.

Another, almost as the former. Take the marrow of Calves bones, the yolks of
eggs, Dragagant and gum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of Camelina one
drag. and a little wax.

But if the impostume only begins to run: then dip Cotton in strong and
well salted vinegar, put it into his nostrils, herewith they will be dried. But
this following is better: Take prepared Tutia which is slaked in the urine of a
man child of two years old, and Ceruse, of each two drag. and a half, the
juice of Housleeke five ounces: rub this at the least the space of three days
together, the space of three hours every day in a leaden mortar, set it
afterward well stopped in the Sun when it is too dry: then power again other
juice unto it, and bruise it as before: do this so three or four times
together: with this salve are you to anoint the disease three or four times a
day. This salve is so forcible, that many people which have had the canker and
Polypum, Canker Polypus.
thereby have preserved their life a long time.

And if so be (through the great uncleanness of this ulcer) there behooves
stronger things, and the disease be also old: then make first of all the
scurfes moist with wine, wherein Agrimonie, Verueine and honey is decocted,
dry it and make it moist again, afterward use this following: Take Vitrioll,
red and yellow Orpiment, of each half a drag. beat and steep it in the gall
of a Bull or Ox, and refresh it daily until the matter be white; then put
thereto Antimonie and Myrrh, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax as much as
will make an ointment, anoint therewithal, and stop it in the nose: if you
will have this somewhat milder, then put thereto beaten Horsemints and
Mallows, to the quantity of one quarter of an ounce. This that follows is
not so strong.

Take Cypers roots, Allume, Gals, Myrrh, Saffron, of each one quarter of an
ounce, beat them to powder, and blow it into the nose. Or make thereof a salve
with honey. Also you may use the salve Vnguentum Apostolicum, the which is made
thus: Take Turpentine, white wax, Vnquentum. Apostolicum.
white Rosen, Ammoniacum, of each one drag. Opopanacum, Verdigrease, of each
half a drag. the Litharge of gold two scrup. sallad oil six ounces in the
Somer, but in the winter nine ounces, vinegar as much as is needful for to
dissolve the Gum with it, make a salve thereof. This salve is common at the
Apothecaries, and is not only good for this, but also for all sore eyes,
Fistulaes, for cleansing the wounds, wherein it has a marvelous operation:
for it consumes the bad flesh, incarnateth afterward, and heals all hard
swellings: so that there is not almost the like unto this.

Item take burnt lead well washed, Ceruse, Litharge of gold, of each a like
quantity, oil of Roses, and Wax as much as is needful for a salve. This
also following is much commended and is certain: take one sower Pomegranat,
others take sower, mean, and sweet Pomegranates, of each one stamped with
their pills, wrung out and decocted a while in a little pot and clarified, dip a
taint in it and put up into the nose; but if there be any ulcers with it, then
use this following. Take Ceruse, Myrrh, Litharge of gold, burnt Copper, Gals
that are parched a little, Allume, of each one drag. oil of Roses three
ounces, Wax as much as is needful for a salve: this heals and dries. Item
take Ceruse one ounce and a half, calcined and washed Ceruse, Litharge, of
each half a drag. Vinegar, Wax, of each one spoonefull: make it with oil of
Mirtles unto a salve, wash the nostrils with warm wine and piss, wherein
Myrrh and Frankincense is decocted. And if this ulcer will not be healed with
the foresaid things, it is then to be taken for a secret Canker, which one may
not touch with sharp things; as presently hereafter shall appear.

Obstruction or stopping in Childrens noses without any other infirmity.. 3.
IT happens oftentimes, that young, yea newborn children do suffer great
stopping in the nose: their breasts must be anointed well with the oiles of
sweet Almonds, and of Violets, and to them that give suck wine is forbidden.

And if the childrens breast be full, then is the oil of Violets with Sugar to
be put into the mouth. Ancient folks (if they cannot abide the oil of Violets
by reason of the smell) then take sallad oil, or oil of sweet Almonds in
stead thereof.

Impostumations of the Nose.. 4.
THe second kind of exulcerations in the nose are much more perilous and
worse, and are called Apostemata, Hemorrhoides, Polypus Canker.

The first is a soft excrescence of flesh, which gives moisture when one
wringeth the nose; soft in feeling, and bleeding quickly: this proceeds of
moist water which falls out of the brains, rotteth there, and degenerateth
into the flesh, the which otherwhiles grows out so long that it hangs
without the nose: it takes away the speech, the breath, and also the smelling,
sometimes showing red and sometimes white and blackish. But the Polipus is
hardish, has many roots and veins: he is so called after the name of a fish
which has many feet: and for many more similitudes and properties that are
between them. This is caused of melancholicke humors tempered with slime or
Phlegma, and stops the nose through his increase.

This Canker is wholly hard and fast: it manifests himself also on the
outside upon the nose, with many black veins of melancholic blood, whence
this sore takes his offspring, and does bring with it an intolerable stench
(which the Physicians do call Ozenam.) The cause of these tumors is the
affluence of bad humors: but that which causes Hemorhoides is a sweet
Phlegma, which is without blood but rotten, very moist without pain, therefore
is better to be healed then this following.

But in Polypo is corrupted blood, whereto does come a stinking Phlegma.

The Canker is a burnt, rotten, and hardened Melancholia. Both these last are
uncertain, yea wholly impossible to be helped: nevertheless there be many
kinds of remedies ordained and used as follows.

When as then the first sort does appear with softened or white flesh which
fills the whole nose, then is the head vein first to be opened; afterward a
taint anointed with this salve following, to be put into the nostrels where
the disease is. Take yellow Orpiment, Coperas, Verdigreace, of each half an
ounce, Quicksiluer, Salarmoniacke of each one ounce; bruise these small, and
cast it into lime ley: this may you use so: or make it with honey unto a salve.
Others do use this sharp water following: Take yellow Orpiment, quick Lime,
Verdigreace, Quicksiluer, of each one ounce and a half, Salarmoniacke half a
dragme; beat them clean, and let it sees well in water: when it has stood a
while, then will it be very sharp. In like manner, gets also a corroding
quality, the water wherein quick lime is quenched, and wherein quicksiluer is
put.

This is more gentle, take Allume, Verdigreace, of each half an ounce, yellow
Orpiment one scruple, temper them, and stick a taint in Vinegar, sprinkle it
with this powder and so stick it in the nose where the disease is. Of the
mean Corsiues is also taken for an approved thing, powned Vitrioll blown into
the nose in the morning and evening. There is also described in this Chapter in
the 2.. a medicine with the juice of Pomegranats, which are especially good for
this, amongst which you are to temper a little Antimonie and Verdigreace. But if
this will not help, then are stronger things to be used, as an actual
cauterie or incision, and although this do seldom prosper, nevertheless we
will discourse somewhat thereof. For this soft excrescence of flesh whereof we
have spoken at the first is not wholly incurable, but may through these means
be cured, which nevertheless is very impossible in the Canker: but if it were
found that there ought to be used either the actual cauterie or incision, then
must the cauterized place be anointed with fresh butter, and the brayed white
of an eg, and cover the nose and the whole face with vinegar and water, or Rose
water, or take the yolks of an eg, temper it with oil of Roses, and the juice
of Roses, this swageth almost all the pain of the Cauterie.

Here do now follow certain sharp, yet good means, which are most surest in
greatest necessity, the first is, that these superfluous excrescences be clipped
off with a sharp pair of Cisors even to the bottom, afterward take away the
rest that remains behind with this salve following: Take one ounce of honey,
vinegar one quarter of an ounce, Sarcocolla, Ammoniacum, of each half an
ounce, sees these upon a mild fire, and therewith anoint your taints which
you thrust into the nose, it has a special virtue of healing and drying. The
other means, if this were not sufficient, then burn the disease with an iron
that is flat before, thrust it through a copper pipe which is wrapped in clothes
wet in Rose water, to the end that the sound part of the nose be not burnt, do
this so long until one can perceive no remanence of it more. Afterward
anoint the cauterized place with butter, until that the escarre falls off,
and heal it with Basil and the ointment of Ceruse, or with the salve that is
described in the 2.. in the ulcers of the nose with Tutia.

The third mean to expel this accident: Take a long and strong horse hair,
thrust it into the nose until you bring it out of the mouth again: fasten it
on both ends and pluck it hitherwards over the accident, and that so often
times til it be cut out at the bottom. This being accomplished, stanch the
blood with this powder, take Mirrhe, Sarcocolla, fine Bolus, Dragon blood, of
each one dragme, prepared Tutia half a dragme, this powder must be blown in
the place where it bleedeth, or strew a taint with it and stop it into the
nose; now the blood being stanched, heal it with the foresaid salve.

Of the Canker in the Nose.. 5.
THe causes of this Canker in the nose, and the signs thereof are discovered
before. First, it shows it self small like a corn of wheat, but afterward
will be as big as a hazle nut or almond: it yields seldom matter, and
remains always (as is said) hard and dry: it will abide no strong things, as
actual or potentiall cauteries, but it must be softly meddled with, and easy
remedies used thereto, as to let blood, laxatiue things, and Master Tristrams
water, which is described in the fifth chapter and first. Also oil of blew
Flowerdeluce anointed thereon, and chiefly Treacle and Mithridate thrust into
the nostrils, and to hold the same in the mouth and eat it. Also it is very
good to purge the head with this potion: Take Mirobalani Indi one ounce and a
half, Seen, Epithymum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugarcandy four
ounces, sees them together in nine ounces of water even to the half, strain
it then through a cloth, and temper it with Manna and sower Dates amongst it,
of each one ounce. In like sort may one purge also with the Pillulis foetidis
or Siomachicis. The place of the accident is also to be twice a day at the
least strengthened with the oil of Roses wherein Camfere is tempered, and lay
a cloth therein dipped in them, or made as it were into a salve, and anointed
therewithal. Yet in steed of this he may use the juice of Nightshade. The
patient must much beware of all pottages, cheese, hard flesh, and all which
ingendreth melancholic blood: but must use drying meats. His drink must be
wine tempered with water. For the defluxion Ozena, which the Canker brings
with it, is this following very meet: Oz^^a.
Take one ounce and a half of oil of Roses, half an ounce of white Wax, a
little vinegar, and the brayed white of an egg, milk one ounce, washed Ceruse
one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Lettice, of Plantaine, of Nightshade, of
each half an ounce, stir them together the space of two or three hours in a
Leaden mortar.

Of the Murre.. 6.
WE have taught in the description of the Nose, that it is by nature ordained
for a channel, thereby to cleanse the moisture of the head and of the brains,
like as is brought to pass through this course of the Murre, the which the
Grecians do call Catarrhum, especially this murre which falls down into the
nose, do they call Coryzam: of the other two kinds, whence comes so much
badnes, which be salt catarrhes or rheumes, which descend into the throat and
upon the breast, shall be taught at large in their places. We will only here
now discourse of all those maladies that concern the nose: that this course or
running proceeds out of heat and cold, which is Cholera and Phlegma, that
shall be showed at large in the discourse of the pain in the throat in the
second part, where is spoken of the catarrhe or rheum. Here is no other thing
discovered but only of the murre, how that that is most caused when one
comes suddenly out of great warmth into cold; and to the contrary, out of
great cold speedily into warmth: like as when one runs bare headed out of
the bath into the wind; or as one runs out of the great cold into the warm
stew: and this is also the cause wherefore the people for the most part in the
latter end of winter or summer are plagued therewith. Now when this murre or
sniuell is salt and biting, then does it soon cause these accidents, Ozena,
Cancer or Polypus* therefore the sniuel is not to be esteemed so small, but
rather endeavor by and by to provoke and move this defluxion, to the end the
matter may be carried out, whereto this fume following is convenient: Take
Cloves, Myrrh, Frankincense; odoriferous fruits and herbs, as Quinces and
their parings, Rue, Marioram gentle, and such like. Lotions for the feet are
also very fit for this purpose, like as follows: Take Sage, Lauander, Betony,
field mints, or any other, three or four handfuls, sees them in water, and
put the feet therein, use it oftentimes, and meetly deep.

The cleansing of the head.
IN all the former cases, the most principal remedy was always to cleanse the
head and the brains, whereto this water following is very good: Take four
ounces of the juice of wild Cucumbers, Salarmoniacke powned small, half an
ounce tempered in a glass, and fill it half full with water, stir it
oftentimes about, and snuff it up into the nose in the morning fasting five or
six times together warm, and do this always about the second day. This
opens all obstructions that hinder smelling, whether it be in impostumes or
ulcers of the nose: it draws also the matter out and consumes it, and it
strengthens all the instruments that are created for smelling.

Item take the juice of Marioram and Penniroyall, of each one ounce, Muscus two
grains, use it as before. Make also this powder following: Take Penniroyall,
Marioram and Nep, of each one drag. Grains three drag. powne all and bind them
in a fine cloth, and smell oftentimes to it.

Take oil of Violets, oil of Saffron, of each three drag. Ireos, long Pepper,
Euphorbium, of each two grains, make a salve thereof with a little wax,
whereof you shall take the quantity of a pease, and anoint it in the nose when
you go to bed, it purges and cleanses the brains.

Some do use Hellebore or Pepper for the nose, but it is not without danger,
for it troubles too much the brains: but how and through what means the head
is to be cleansed with neesing, look in the first and second Chapters of the
pain in the head.

Of the excessive bleeding at the Nose.. 7.
THe excessive bleeding at the nose has diverse causes, which were too long to
discover them all at this present time, it only suffices us to show the inward
and outward causes: as concerning the outward causes of bleeding, are blows,
falls, thrusts, sore labor, and the heat of the sun: all these things do
open the veins, and make subtle blood, which is easily moved to run out.
The causes thereof can easily be perceived and inquired of the patient. The
inward causes be superfluity, sharpnes and heat of the blood, the which is
over all the whole body, head, liver, milt, womb and other places.

In like manner also through agues and other great sickness, through pain of the
head, a forcible expulsive power, and feebleness of the retentiue virtue, in
full bodies and abounding of blood is the bleeding at the nose requisite, it
emptieth the head and other parts. In Phthisi and other sicknesses more, it is
commanded to provoke it, whereof shall be more at large spoken in other
places. Therefore if there be perceived an vnburthening through this bleeding at
the nose, then it is a good sign of health: like as to the contrary a sudden
and excessive bleeding is very dangerous, and a sign of death. But if this
bleeding happen through any bruising of the skin of the brains, then it is
very hard, yea in danger never to be helped.

And whenever the bleeding is above 48. ounces, then it is a bad token, and
yet badder if it do surpass it: if it come then unto twenty or 24. pound,
every pound reckoned at twelve ounces, then must death follow after it
immediately.

In like sort the signs of death are, if the bleeding person be not only of a
bleake color, but also dark, green or leady colored.

An order of diet.
THis bleeding at the nose comes through some causes that require always a
good order of life to be observed. For this purpose is this most common, that
those things be always used that cool the blood, and make it thick: if there
be any agues with it, then must light things be used (which be cooling) as
Lettice, Purslain, Endive, small Endive, vinegar, veriuice. Is then the
bleeding strong and vehement? to the end it might once be stayed, use Beans,
Pease, Lentils, Rye, Colewoorts, Cheese, Beef, Hares and Hearts, also thick
red wine, all hot spices, white wine (if so be that they be not well watered)
are to be eschewed.

Now we will show how the blood is to be stanched.

For to perform the same, there be six kind of means: first, by the foresaid
cooling things (which be to be eaten) these things following are to be dropped
into the nose, and laid thereon: in like manner also upon the forehead, the
juice of Lettice, of Housleeke, of Nightshade, corn Roses or Nettles: in like
manner the water of water Lillies, of Cichory, of Roses, and Cumin water: Also
the herb of Poppy, Willow leaves, or their juice. Item also Horstaile,
Shepherds purse, vinegar and Camfere, and if it be very great need, Opium: for
these things altogether make thick blood, that it cannot run so hastily out of
the veins. It is also good to irrigate his head with cold water, so long
continuing until his head be so cold, that he get thereby a shiuering and
shaking, or trembling. In fine, to keep the head cold, and not to stir it
much, is very commodious: also wet a cloth or napkin in cold water, in vinegar,
or in Rose water, wring it not out too hard, and wrap it so about the neck.

Item take the whites of twelve eggs, powned Allume four ounces, beat it well
together, wet a cloth in it, and wrap it about the neck, about the forehead and
temples, afterward take Hares hair, or the hair of a Roebuck, stop the
nostrill full thereof, and that at the first.

Also it is commended that both the thombes and their arms be bound hard about
the elbowes; but let them not be bound too hard, but being sometimes made
loose, to bind them again.

Or make one of these plasters, take the juice of Nightshade six ounces, Rose
water one ounce and a half, Barley meal as much as is needful for to make a
plaster, lay this upon the liver, if the blood run forth of the right nostrill.

The second mean to stanch the blood effected with stopping things, as the
juice of Sloes, red Coral, Momy, Aloe, Horstaile, Amber, Bloodstones,
Hippocystis, Bolus, flowers of Pomegranats, Lentils, gals, Sumach, Shepherds
purse, Medlers, Services, Quinces, pears, and other sour pears amongst the
compounded things, Trocisces de Carabe, Terra sigillata, which foresaid things
all that be of this nature do draw and shut the veins together.

For this are also meet these plasters following, take the juice of Plantaine
and Rose water, of each two ounces, vinegar half an ounce, and the white of an
egg, sealed earth, or in the steed thereof time as much as is needful for to
make it meetly thick: lay it upon the forehead and the temples of the head.

Another. Take Dragon blood, parched gum, parched starch roses, the juice of
Sloes, Hippocystis, burnt Iuory, the blossoms of Pomegranats, Bolus, sealed
earth, bloodstone, red Coral, and Amber, of each one drag. and a half, Poppy
seed, Purslane seed, of each one drag. Opium half a drag. powne all that is to
be powned thereof, and with the juice of Plantaine make it to a plaster, and
use it as before.

This following is not much unlike to the former: Take Dragon blood, parched
gum, the yellow seeds of Roses, the juice of sloes, Hippocystis, burnt Iuory,
blossoms of Pomegranats, Bolus, sealed earth, bloodstone, red Coral, of each
one dragme and a half, Poppy seeds, Purslane seeds, burnt Hearts horn, ashes
of gals, Cipers nuts, of each one drag. beat them all small, and mix them
amongst the other with the juice of Plantaine, afterward make small cakes of
it; when you will now use it, then beat it to powder and blow it into the
nostrils: but you may use it as a plaster for to lay upon the forehead and
temples of the head.

Item take well beaten Momy as much as you please, mix it with copwebs and the
white of an egg, dip cotton or lint in it, and then stop it into the nose.
First take Hearts bones, burnt Iuory Verbascum powned with vinegar, temper the
foresaid powder amongst it, according to that you will have of it little or
much put it into the nose, all these things stanch blood, tempered together or
each alone, or mix Aloe with the white of an eg, use it as aforesaid. Item
take the whites of four eggs well braied and tempered amongst Aloe one drag.
Frankincense one quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood and fine Bolus, of each
half a drag. use this, yet putting therein Hares hair made wet.

Secondly, take well brayed whites of eggs, and temper Gips or plaster amongst
them, so that

Thirdly, the blood is to be stopped with astringent things, as Dragagant, Gum,
Frankincense,

Fourthly, the bleeding is to be inhibited by potentiall cauteries, as Coperas,
Orpiment, make an escarre. But this is to be feared, if so be that the blood be
not quenched therewith, that it might afterward bleed the sorer, therefore it
is not without great danger to use this mean.

Terms in (...).
this plaster is also meet against the excessive terms or flowers of women,
put into the neck of the womb, and also applied to their priuities.

This is also very good: Amber, Purslaine, garden Mints, and their juice with
copwebs, thrust up into the nose.

Philonium Persicum with Purslaine water: they have also, as has been said,
powdered Troc. de Carabe and blown into the nose.

It is also very good to set boxing cups on the shoulders and on the legs,
understanding well, that if the blood run out of the right nostril, then set
the boxes vnpickt upon the liver: if it run out of the left nostril, upon the
Milt in the left side: also the legs, the arms and the breast are to be
bounden, to rub the outward members, and also under the armpits and other
places of the body with burnt nettles for to draw therewith the blood
downwards.

Besides all these aforesaid, I am to manifest one remedy more that exceedingly
stops also bleeding: Take sleckt lime, make a plaster thereof with vinegar,
lay it over the nose, it will stop presently. Others suppose also that this
lime is to be blown into the nostrils, or made up with the white of an egg,
to be so put with a taint into the nose. This also (as some suppose) will the
wool or flax do, that flies from the herb Carduius Benedictus, cut small
and thrust into the nose.

Item it has been oftentimes found, that an extreme frighting has caused
blood by and by to stanch and cease for that the blood runs then toward the
heart. In this also has superstition and unbelief taken place, whenever one
holds in his hand a dead man's bone, and the moss that grows upon a dead
bodies scalp be stopped into ye nose, then is the blood stanched out of hand. In
like manner also, albeit that it be somewhat more natural, if one lay the moss
of the black (or sloe) thorn in the shoes and go thereon, it does stanch
blood.

Item take broad Plantaine and the juice of Shepherds purse, of each three
ounces, prepared Bloodstone, fine Bolus, sealed Earth, Dragon blood, of each
one dragme and a half, spread it on a cloth, and lay it on the place of the
nose where the blood comes, and refresh it oftentimes. Or take beaten Bean
meal, temper it with the white of an egg, and use it as before. It comes
also otherwhiles to pass (and is also no wonder) that such superfluous blood
of the nose does bring swouning with it; for the which are sick persons hands
and feet to be rubbed with salt and vinegar, to bind fast the arms and legs,
and to bind and unbind them again, also to use other outward means, which
here afterward in the second part shall be described for the swouning.

Item if the blood run out at the right nostrel, set a boxing cup vnpickt upon
the Liver: and so whenever the swouning is past, the Liver vein is to be
opened, or the Salnatella in the left side, and to smell to cold things, as that
which is made of Quince pears, and to use Lettice, Purslaine, Beans, and
other pottages, until that the blood waxes thick.

For a conclusion, you have hereafter many remedies in the fifth part for to
stanch blood, which are also good for this purpose.

Enfeebled or lost smelling.. 8.
THis is no small disease to man, for if one be borne with it, or have had it
long, he is esteemed by the Grecians incurable, unless it be through continuance
of time and with great trouble: nevertheless the ancient and latter
Physicians have employed all diligence to devise all necessary means; and
first described three several kinds thereof. The first kind, where thoroughly
and wholly the smell is lost.

The second is a diminishing of the smell, where a thing is smelt like as it
is, yet imperfectly: and this disease is much more with men then with beasts,
for that they be of a moister brain, and all beasts have their brains much
drier, therefore they do also smell sharper and further.

The third kind is a corrupted smell, where one receives the smell otherwise
then it is of it self, like as when one adiudgeth stinking things for
odoriferous. The cause that the smell is utterly lost, is when the conduits
that go toward the brains be thoroughly obstructed, that the air received
cannot come to the skin of the brains, which obstruction may happen through
some violent motion or blows on the head. Also if about the place and
instuments of smelling there engender any wart or fleshly excrescence, or any
vlceration: or also through any other gross humors that will settle there, and
stop up the conduits of smelling. Lastly through repletion of the head and of
the whole body.

The cause of the diminishing of the smelling is as before, but is not so
great: it may also be caused by cold or by hot medicines, which be used at the
nose. The cause of a corrupted smell is a bad moisture, which lies hidden in
the same place, and there makes stinking vapors: and so may also the canker of
the nose be caused and procured.

The signs of the obstructions are, that no moisture comes out of the nose
without pain, unless the brains had some impediment: but if any moisture
does appear without pain, then does the same moisture obstruct the conduits
of smelling.

If it proceed of heat and drought, then may you perceive the heat in the
forehead and nose: if of cold, it is also discerned by the same places: or if
it be some stinking moisture, then does all stink that he smells unto, and
all what is near him, also his breath is unsavory and stinking.

Other infirmities or lets are known by sight, they may also be discerned by
the pain and by the matter. The cure of them all consists especially in
comforting and cleansing the infirmities of smelling and the brains, whence
most commonly all these infirmities do proceed.

It may also be perceived by the former reasons, that all these obstructions
and sorenesses, the diminishing and loss of smelling does proceed of humors:
now to remedy the same, are you to begin the cure by a good diet, wherefore all
meats easy of digestion are best, as broths, yolks of eggs, Hares brains,
which have a proper and secret virtue for this infirmity, Pullets, young
Pigeons, Partridges, Fesants, Veale, Cawdles, and all of them distilled with
Sage, Marioram, Rosemary, and Betony: parched hasel nuts are also very good for
this purpose: small white wine shall be his drink, neither may you omit to purge
the body: if the sickness be caused of cold, then is he to be purged as has
bin said in the second chapter and first. of the cold pain of the head; but if
blood and heat do cause it, then are you to proceed as has bin showed in the
first chapter and sixth.

Afterward you are to cleanse the head with neesing in them that have lost
their smelling without any excrescence of flesh or soreness of the nose: for
which purpose you may look the second chapter and second. also in the sixth. of
this present chapter: but these simples are especially to be used for it, to
wit, Amber, Rosemary, Cinnamom, Cloves, Lignum Aloes, Nigella, to which he must
smell often and long, for they open the obstructions of the head; which is also
effected with these dried herbs following; namely, Rue, Germander, field
Cipers, Nep, and Marioram: but for to provoke sternutation or neesing, take
Lignum Aloes, pepper, and Stauesacre. Also the vapor of boiling vinegar
received into the nostrils very often is of good effect, for because the same
has a biting nature, it does move neesing. Also you may sees one of these
things following in wine, and receive the vapor as is said into the nostrils.

Take Calmus, Gentian, Bay leaves, Penniroyal, field mints, Annise and Fennel
seeds, parsley, and roots of Smallage: or receive often in one day the vapor of
warm water wherein Melilot or Fumitory be decocted, the water of Asarabacca or
of Elder is also good for this use. Also the seeds of Nigella bounden in a
cloth, carried with him and smelt oftentimes unto it; the same strewed upon hot
coals, and to receive the fume of it.

Item take the powder of Nigella, Ireos, of each 3. quarters of an ounce,
Marioram gentle, Cammomill, Bay leaves, Nep, Stechas, of each half a handful;
sees all in sufficient water until about the third part be wasted: mix the
powders amongst it, and draw thereof into the head, it does cleanse the head
very well. Also this powder following may be prepared: Take Nardus seed which
has lain a day and a night in sharp vinegar and is dried again, one ounce,
Beuercod and Nutmegs, of each one drag. and a half, red and white Behen,
Galingal, white pepper, Marioram and Nep, of each a scrup. Costus roots,
Sagapenum, the seed of Rue and Basil, of each one ounce; stamp each apart,
and bind it being tempered in a piece of Syndall, and smell oftentimes unto it.
This is good against all hinderance of the smelling which comes through
coldness, be it with or without obstructions.

Pomanders.
TAke red Storax, Nutmegs, Cucubes, Cloves, Nardus seed, Lignum Aloes, Indy
Spica and Cinamom, of each one drag. Muscus and Amber of each one scruple,
Laudanum one ounce, make a Pomander thereof, like as there be many described in
the sixth part, and is also taught how the same is to be made. Or use Cammomil,
Melilot, Rue, Marioram, decocted in half wine half water. But if these things
will not help, then take the juice of blew Flower deluce, and a little beaten
Piretrum, anoint that, or stop it into the nose: do the like with oil of
Spike, wherein is tempered a little Euphorbium and Muscus, for both of them be
strong and hot.

This following is commended for a worthy receipt, whereas the smelling is lost:
Take small powned Nardus seed, temper it with oil of Olives, bend the head
backward as much as is possible, and let three or four drops fall into the
nose, but take the mouth full of water, to the end the oil may run the lesfe
into the mouth. Item take Nardus seed which has lain three days in vinegar,
and is dried again, one quarter of an ounce, steep them in three ounces of
the juice of Marioram gentle, or at the least in fair water, and use it as
aforesaid three or four times between day and night, and so shall you see
maruels. Take oil of Tiles, like as shall be described hereafter, half an
ounce, Muscus two grains, stroke them in the nose being made warm. The
gargarismes are also commodious, like as here follows: Take Radish, Marioram,
Calmus, Betony, Penniroyall, of each half a M. let them sees in a pint and a
half of wine, until about the third part be sodden away; put thereto as much
honey as you please, Mustard seed, Piretrum, of each one drag. use it in the
morning. The like also gargarized with decocted Rue and Hyssop, also Piretrum,
Masticke and Zeduary, or one of these, are to be taken and chewed in the mouth,
and to spet out the moisture: likewise is also very good to strew this powder
following upon the head.

Take Briony, Lignum Aloes, grains, of each one drag. Marioram gentle, Cloves,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Beuercod one scrup. Muscus, Amber, of each one
grain and a half, powned apart, and then mixed: of this powder take four
grains, and strew it upon the head before where the hair begins to the
crown of the head.

For conclusion: because amongst the foresaid remedies there be some violent,
which may provoke much pain in so precious a member as the nose is; therefore
drop therein when the pain is too great, the oil of Gourds seed, and pour
warm water upon the head, that will assuage the heat and pain: so will also
all whatsoever cools and moisteneth, whether it be used inwardly or
outwardly, or stopped inwardly into the nose: like as for example, a cloth made
wet in Rose water and laid upon the nose, or Rose water drawn up into the nose.

Oil of Tiles or Brickes, called Oleum Philosophorum.
THis oil is worthy for her virtues sake, that it should be here described:
for it is not only good for the lost smelling, but also for all cold
sicknesses, for it is warm and piercing, it consumes all though moisture of
the members, and expels all swelling: it is also very good against the
falling sickness, swimming of the head, the dead palsy, loss of memory,
crampe, and pain of the back, and against all manner of goutes: it is also
highly commended in all diseases of the milt, the bladder, and of the kidneyes,
in all ulcers, lepry, scals and fresh wounds. This oil is made as hereafter
follows.

Take a very old Tile or Brick, beat it in pieces as big as Walnuts, make it
glowing hot, cast one piece after another in old Sallad oil, leave them
therein so long, until they be well soked through with the oil; afterward
beat them to fine powder, and put them in a glass helm, the which is clean
over well luted, lute also the helm and the recipient, afterward distill it in
sand or ashes, but first with a mild fire augmenting the same a little; the
oil which comes out of it, preserve it well stopped.

The ninth Chapter. Of the Ears.
THere be more parts of the face, to wit, the Ears, in truth precious and
necessary members, the which nature has ordained as instruments for receivers
and judges of the voice and their noise, whereof as well men as beasts have
always twain, on each side of the head one, that always stand open, because
that as well sleeping as waking we have need of hearing. They be also outwardly
shapen with diverse crooked entrances, to the end they may receive much air,
and noise might retain and discern the same the longer: which crooked ways
are also meet for this, that there may not easily fall any thing therein, which
otherwise might befall if the entrance were right out, whereto is always the
moistnes in the entrance of the ears, which we call the wax of the ears, and
is as it were birdlime, to the end that the small flies, fleas, and other such
like that would otherwhiles creep into the ears, might be first stayed therein.
It is also very seldom seen that men can stir their ears, the which
nevertheless is seen in all fourefooted beasts.

The ears are also subject to many kind of diseases, the which are divided by
the learned into three principal kinds.

The first is when any one is wholly and thoroughly bereft of his hearing, the
which we call with one word deafness.

The second is when the hearing is diminished or weakened, like as when one
hears not but when one calls alowd to him.

The third kind is when the hearing only is lost or altered, like as one
thinks that he hears one pipe, sing, rush or any thing else, the which in
truth is not so.

But of this and of other more that concern the ears, we will write thereof
more at large.

The causes which may hurt both these, are almost incurable, some be natural,
some also through some outward and inward accidents, to wit, as to come out of
too hot or too cold air, sudden alteration of cold or heat, from warm water
to cold water, or any thing else that might come into the ears, as thrusting,
falling, striking, wounds, beasts that may creep therein, vnslackt lime, etc.
In like manner also disturbance of the brains, of the head, and of the whole
body, rheumes of the head, and chiefly cold, toothach, pain of the sinews,
and of other members which do touch the hearing: or impostumations, swellings,
and worms that do grow in the ears. All these and other more have their
special signs. If the deafness or diminishing of the hearing proceed of
outward causes, the same may be well demanded of the patient: Does it come
from the brains? then will also the sight, smelling, and especially the taste
be annoyed. If it be caused through hot impostumes, or swelling of the sinews,
then is there intolerable pain, panting, trembling, and some frenzy with it,
yea hot agues, and lastly death it self, if so be that there be not some good
advise taken for it in time. If it be caused through cold humors, there is then
impostumation and cold always about the same places. Be winds the causes? then
is there always some sissing with it. Impostumations do yield matter: worms
may be perceived by their stirring or rumbling, and if otherwhiles one fall
out: what now concerns the description of their remedies, our beginning shall
be first of all of the pain of the ears, and afterward of all other
infirmities of the ears.

Pain of the Ears in general.. 1.
FIrst it is herein to be noted, that the pain of the ears is not rightly nor
properly spoken; for that which touches the outward part of the ear, the same
can suffer no great pain: and although the pain were great, yet is there no
danger of life with it, for that they be no principal members of the life:
nevertheless this is wont to be called, the pain in the ears which is within
the head, and in the instruments of the hearing, as in the sinews of the
hearing, which are near unto the brains, and are knit therewith; of which
intolerable pain deadly agues and frensies do proceed. Therefore we will here
express sundry remedies for the strengthening and cleansing of the brains,
from whence these terrible accidents do come, like as already has been done in
the description of the head, in the first and second Chapter, and more yet
where we have discoursed of the pose or murre, that for this are especially
these following gentle cleansings of the head commanded to be used.

Take two ounces of Marioram gentle, white wine one ounce, the seeds of
Licebane, Piretrum, of each one scrup. temper it and drop it into the ears:
such cleansing of the head is not to be spared, as long as the pain of the
ears or head endures. Or when he perceives that it will come again, it is
forthwith to be prevented and cut off: but if the pain get the upper hand,
which is caused through blood, the which the red and swollen face with beating
of the brains does show; then is the head vein on the same side where the
pain is to be opened, that the matter may be drawn downwards.

If there run any choler amongst it, then may the same be purged with yellow
Mirobalans, sower Dates, sirupe of Roses, Cassia, de Succo Rosarum. After both
these remedies following, or one of both are to be used outwardly.

Take oil of Roses, of Willow leaves, of each a like much, temper a little
vinegar amongst it, and drop it lukewarm in the ears. Or take warm woman's
milk like as it comes from the breast, and dropped it oftentimes therein. Both
of them do slack the heat, and assuage the pain. For this is also good the
braied white of an egg, tempered with a little oil of Violets and some
Camfere: others do use oil of water Lillies alone, or tempered with others.

A general rule of the outward applications into the Ears.
FOrasmuch as now it is of much importance, how that is to be used which is to
be put into the ears, therefore we will (before we run any further) declare
this rule following. First there ought nothing to be dropped into the ears
before that the body and especially the head be purged: but before we come to
this, he may use the fomentations, bags, vapors, and plasters that are to be
used most safely: for this application has always some more danger in causing
some obstruction or stopping. And if so be that with them nothing can be
effected, then is the imposition to be attempted; yet the ears are first of
all to be cleansed with clothes: also there is nothing to be put therein, which
by nature is either too hot or too cold, but al whatsoever is middle, mean and
lukewarm: also not too much, but from one to four drops, and to hold the same
not above three hours in the ears; howbeit nevertheless others do suppose this
time to be too short, for that the medicine in so short time cannot perform
his operation, therefore do they prescribe six or eight hours. In the
imposition shall the patient lie upon his whole ear, yet not to drop it in, if
so be that it be not first run out: the which through neesing, crying, strong
blowing of the nose is done. And this is also to be noted, that there is never
any repelling medicines therein to be used, to the end that the pain be not
driven to the brains. Now for to come to the hot pains of the ears, then take
the water of Purslaine, grated Gourds (the juice pressed out) temper them, or use
each alone like as is already taught.

Or take the seeds of Gourds, Melons, Pompions and Cucumbers, of each one drag.
and a half, beat them and sees them in six ounces of vinegar until that
two ounces be consumed; strain them through a cloth, and use them like as all
the other.

Take the juice of Housleeke, oil of Roses, of each half an ounce, and temper
them: or take the juice of Roses, of Housleeke, of each half an ounce, oil of
Sesamum two drag. temper them together. Or take the oil of Roses two ounces,
sharp vinegar half an ounce, let them sees until the vinegar be sodden away,
then temper therein Philonium Romanum one quarter of an ounce, and rub it in and
about the ears.

Take the juice of Housleeke, temper it with woman's milk and use it. Also you
may take the juice of Peach leaves, tempered with a little vinegar.

Item take a small glass with a narrow neck, put therein the fresh leaves of
Violets half full, put more unto it afterward twenty Ants eggs, and then fill
full the glass with the foresaid Violet leaves, stop it tight: bury it the
space of sixteen days in the ground wherein Ants are; afterward wring them
out, and drop thereof into the ear: and if one perceive thereby no amendment,
and that the pain be yet augmented, then are stronger things to be used for it
as follows.

Take Opium one scrup. oil of Roses one ounce, temper them together, and drop
a little thereof in the ear, it asswageth the pain and procures sleep: but
do this but seldom, for we have oftentimes warned you from the Opium. The same
may you also do with the juice of Southernwood, with the foresaid oil. In like
manner also garden Snailes decocted in the oil of Almonds. Eyewaters may also
be used for this, which are ordained for the hot and sharp pain of the eyes,
like as here before in the seventh Chapter, in the fourth and fifth. is
declared, if so be that the pain be intolerable.

This plaster following is very highly commended for all pain of the ears:
Take dry Violets and Cammomil, of each one ounce; temper amongst it well
decocted and beaten Henbane roots, with Barley meal, of each one ounce and a
half, the fat of Hens one ounce, oil of Cammomill as much as is needful; let
them sees thick together, and lay it upon the ears, and upon the temples of
the head: when it is cold, then lay another upon it that is warm. It must also
not be neglected to rub the patient softly behind his ears with the foresaid
oil, being made lukewarm, once or twice a day. But if the occasion of this
pain be through cold, then parch first Millet and salt upon the fire, and lay
it warm over it in a cloth, and purge the patient, like as hereafter shall be
taught of the diminishing of hearing.

For to put into the ears, are to be taken these things following which are
extant or in readiness, as oil of Baies, oil of Costus, oil of Radish seeds,
the juice of Marioram gentle, the which also is good each apart, or mixed and
dropped therein. Also oil of Rue, oil of Spike, of Beuercod, and of Behen: the
ears are to be rubbed round about with the salve of Martiaton, and covered
with unwashed sheep wool, and to do this twice in 24. hours.

Take oil of Roses or of Eggs, and the juice of Sage, of each two ounces,
stamp therein one or two Scarabees (which are of the small beasts that fly
abroad in the evening with or without horns) also as many Earthwormes washed in
wine, sees this by a soft fire until all the moisture be wasted: afterward
strain it through a cloth, and drop thereof in the ear every morning and
evening lukewarm two or three drops.

Item temper Beuercod with woman's milk, use it as aforesaid: if this help not
so soon, then take Ants, bruise them and temper them with woman's milk: the
juice of Radish dropped therein the space of three days shall also take away the
pain.

Take the juice of Paul's betony, of strawberry leaves, of Sage, of Housleeke,
of each one ounce, Mastick and Frankincense of each one drag. and a half,
temper them together; the decoction of Coleworts two ounces: drop thereof into
the ear, should also take away all pains.

Of the order of life or diet.
Whereas we have showed many causes of the disease in the ears, yet can there
no certain order or rule be yielded for it. But one must direct him according
to the quality or importance of the cause.

But generally whereas pain or impostume of the ears be approaching, then must
one keep him always sober in eating and drinking, and to eschew all that
which ascends to the head, whereof is already sufficiently expressed: also
all that makes wind, as pottages, moist fruit, cheese, smoked and salted
flesh, unleavened bread, and great fishes, small or watered wine is he to
drink, and to eat roast meat: Comin, Annise, Caraway, and Fennel are very
requisite for all diseases of the ears which proceed through cold: so also is
prepared Coriander after meat.

Of the noise and hissing in the ears.. 2.
THis disease has many causes, as blows without wounds, overmuch vomiting,
great stirring of the head and the whole body, great cold or heat, wind,
moisture of the head, or the impostumation of any other member: but the
principallest cause of this sissing is, that the vapor and winds of the brains
do fall into the ears; and according to the importance thereof, do forcibly
rush like water, which either continues always without intermission, or at
some times also cease. Now pretermitting many subtle differences; this
hissing proceeds most through the feeblenes or imbecility of hearing, by
reason it is not thoroughly clear and clean, so that it may be thereby known,
to wit, that it is less perceived fasting and when one is hungry, than when
one has eaten; for that the ascending vapors of a full stomach do much take
away all such pureness in hearing.

This hissing must be prevented betimes, for that when it endures continually,
it is not to be cured through good government and necessary medicines; then
commonly follows after it a perfect deafness: and for this are commonly used
these following: Pillulae de Hiera, Mastichinae, Cochiae, Sine quibus, de
Agarico, and Trocisci de Agarico. These diseases of the head be cleansed with
the things which are described in the first. of the pain of the ears through
neesing and otherwise.

Certain ancient Physicians have more violently dealt with it, and advised to
temper two grains of Opium in oil and to put it into the ears, but the same
is so perilous that some thereby have remained utterly deaf: but if Opium must
needs be used, then is this more safe.

Take Opium, Beuercod, of each one grain, break them with one quarter of an
ounce of vinegar, and drop a drop or twain into the ears: yet is this
following much safer.

Take Sallad oil wherein Poppy seed and Myrtle seed are decocted, and use it
as is expressed. But if the sissing come with anguish of the head, and
specially through cold causes, feebleness of the hearing and windy vapors,
whether it be from the stomach, the womb, or any other parts of the body, then
use for it the juice of Marioram with woman's milk.

Use also which of these oils you will, as the oil of Radish seed, of Bays,
of Roses (wherein some Beuercod is mixed) of Mustard seeds, Costus, and of
Sesamum, and above all is the oil of bitter Almonds commended. In like sort
these things following which have the same efficacy are to be used, temper
Radish water with oil of Bays, the juice of great Hearts tongue with honey, the
juice of an Onion alone steept well in Rue water, afterward take bitter
Almonds and the juice of Rue, of each half an ounce, and prepared Euphorbium
bruised small and tempered amongst it: but if so be that these foresaid things
do not help, then it is a token that this sissing of the ears proceeds of a
great moisture which lies enclosed in the pannicles, which cover the brains.

And then must the brains be oftentimes purged with the pills of Hiera cum
Agarico, and Pillulae Cochiae and to take them in the evening after meat. Will
you then according as it is advised use preparatiue potions before? then take
Oximel, and Oximell of Squils, honey of Roses, sirupe of Betony and of Stechas
(which you think good) each time one ounce and a half, or two ounces,
tempered with the water of Baulme or such like, continuing this three or four
mornings one after another. After the purging take Marioram gentle, Stechas,
Sea-mints, Wormwood, Marioram, of each half a M. sees them, and let the warm
vapor go into the ears.

Item, take Rosemary, Sage, Betony, Cammomill, Marioram gentle, of each a
little sodden together, and used as aforesaid. Item, for this is also good, the
vapor of vinegar wherein Wormwood is decocted: also the juice of Onions and of
Rue decocted in oil, and two or three drops put into the ear; boil the
Betony alone in wine, and let the vapor go into the ear: the juice of Marioram
put into the ear oftentimes in the day, drives away all sissing of the ears,
which comes through any wind or cold matter, and hinders sleep.

We have before showed how to mix Euphorbium in the oil of bitter Almonds,
for which one may take the oil of Elderne, of Rue, of Cammomill and Dill, also
of Licebane, Peach kernels, oil of Walnuts, of Bays, or which you will: or
you may use one of these foresaid which you will alone or with oil of
Beuercod, and of Euphorbium, which is not so hot. Item take the gall of an Ox,
or of a Sheep, the oil of bitter Almonds, of each half an ounce, the juice of
onions or of garlik and honey, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them and
use them as is aforesaid. Take oil of Spike (at the Apothecaries) and the
juice of Onions, of each a like much, use it warm as before, it is very
forcicble.

Item take one dragme and a half of Aristologie, temper it together with the
juice of Bays, and use it as before.

Hissing in the Ears with bad hearing.
TAke white Hellebore, Beuercod, of each one dragme, Rue, Saltpeter, long
Pepper, of each two scruples, Euphorbium one scruple, the juice of Radish and
Garlic, the oil of sweet and bitter Almonds, oil of Dill, of Cammomill and
Nardus, of each one ounce, let them sees alone in a pot of water until the
juice be consumed: afterward strain them through a cloth, and drop two or
three drops in the ear with a chip or slice of Cipers wood, whereon is laid a
good deal of the stamped leaves of Maioram. These little Cipers boordes are
very highly commended of famous Physicians, made warm and laid always before
meat upon the diseased ear and temples until it be cold, and this continued
so long until the hissing be gone away: also when one goes to sleep he may
lie down upon his ear, putting always the stamped Marioram unto it.

And if any body through the great hissing cannot sleep, then is he to prepare
this bag following, and after that it has layen certain hours in lie, to
wash and rub himself therewith.

Take the innermost of the Coloquint, field Cipers, Asarabacca, Centory, of
each one handful, Maioram, field milts, Penniroiall, of each two handfuls,
water mints one handful and a half, chop it small, and make two bags thereof:
lay them in lie and wash your head therewith, afterward wring them out well,
and lay them warm upon the head, or on the hissing ear. It is an approved
remedy.

Item in like manner may you take a dry bag for to hold before the ear, to
wit, of Betony, Stechas, Marioram gentle, and Cammomil, lay these warm upon
the ear. Take Mastick half an ounce, Piretrum one drag. beat it small, and
temper it with as much honey of Roses that you may form Trociscos thereof, chew
it in the mouth and spet it out again: they do draw much slime out of the head.

Treacle and Mithridate are not only good against this hissing, but also
against all the diseases of the ears and hearing: therefore it is commanded in
the disease for to take after purging one dragme of fine Treacle with conserve
of Buglosse.

After meat you shall use Mermelade or any such like that detaineth the
ascending vapors out of the stomach toward the head: it is also commended not
to eat much in the evening, nor to drink late: but rather to take a spoonful
of Caraway seed (which is steeped in vinegar) and so go to bed, or you may use
also Annise, Fennel, and prepared Coriander.

What meats are to be refrained.
BEware of all whatsoever does ascend upwards toward the head, as Garlic,
Mustard, Onions, Horseradish, nuts, strong wine, and all that is made of dow
and milk; of Coleworts, sodden fish, and especially from Eeles and Tenches,
also from all broths, but especially in the evening: also it were not amiss
every fourth day before the supper, or two or three hours after, to take these
pills following.

Take Beuercod five grains, pills of Sarcocolla half a drag. washed Aloe one
quarter of an ounce, make pills thereof with the juice of Nep; after this use
the vapor described in this. where it begins: Take Marioram gentle, Stechas,
etc. afterward this bag or cap laid upon the head, that both the ears even
to the neck be covered therewith: Take Nep, marsh Mint, Penniroyall, Marioram
and Rue, all dry, of each one handful, Mace half an ounce, Ameos, Borage
seeds, and Caraway, of each half a handful, two white Poppie heads, stamp all
these to powder, and make thereof a cap or bag.

Another. Take Asarabacca, Nep, Penniroyall, Stechas, of each one handful and
a half, Spiknard, Spica Romana, Rosemary flowers, Basil, Lignum Aloes, of
each half a drag. Mace half an ounce, powne this together, and make a cap
thereof; make it warm between two Cipers boords, and lay it on the head as
before. Capital powders are also commended for this purpose: Take Lignum
Aloes, Cucubes and Cloves, powne each apart, and strew this in the hair on the
top of the whole head, as is taught before.

Will you then have a mixed or compounded powder? then take one quarter of an
ounce of Lignum Aloes, Spica Indica, Cucubes and Cloves, of each one dragme,
Sandaraca and Roses, of each two dragmes, Mace three dragmes, make thereof a
powder; strew this upon the head two hours after supper, and early in the
morning, like as is said. Whereto all such patients are oftentimes to smell, is
sufficiently alleged here before in the eight Chapter and eight. in the
diminishing or lost smelling.

Of the binding or rubbing in the hissing of the Ears.
FOr this rushing or hissing of the ears is very good that the shoulders even
unto the rump; and the knees unto the feet, be forcibly rubbed and chafed
downwards so long until they be through red.

It is also very commodious to bind them hard and again quickly to make loose
and undo them: also to bind hard the brawne beneath the knees, and then
afterward ascending by little and little, even to the very priuities.

In like manner are also good for this, boxing cups without picking, applied
from the buttockes upwards even to the shoulders.

Lastly if there appear in the face or on the temples any extuberating, then
can it not be ill to let two or three ounces of blood out of the Median. To
these we will add a very old superstition, whereof Plinius has written 1500.
years ago, which is, When ones right ear itcheth, then is there somewhere
some good thing spoken of him: but if any ones left ear itch, then is there
some ill speaking of him: which misbeleefe continues with many even to this
present day.

Impostumes and sores in the Ears.. 3.
IT happens very seldom that nature accustometh to purge her superfluous
moisture through the impostume of the ears, nevertheless it chances in young
newborn children which are full of moisture; this appears oftentimes in the
first described sissing of the ears, but when this has ceased and abides
away, yet comes again and endures the space of three days; then it is a
sign that there is an impostume of the ears at hand, for which maturatiues
must serve, and when it is broken up, mundification. The running and mattering
of the ears is moved through three kinds of causes, to wit, of an impostume,
or of some ulcers of the ears, or through any defluxion into the eyes that
afterward falls toward the ears, and there putrefying, is altered into
corruption and matter.

For all these foresaid, a sober life is fit and requisite, whereby this course
of matter may be diminished. Also the patient must refrain from all gross and
vaporous meats: moderate exercise is meet and commodious for him: he is
always to hold the body loose: if he be hot and full of blood by nature, then
is his head vein to be opened, in the hand or in the arm. And if so be this
(by reason of occasion) might not be compassed, then are boxing cups to be
set upon the shoulders, also to purge with the pills Cochiae, and otherwhiles
move neesing, for that it draws the matter into the nose, whereby it may be
easily purged and drawn, for the gargarismes are also very meet which are
prescribed in Paralysi: for this are also outward things to be used, wherewith
the impostumation may quickly be maturated, the matter euacuated, and the ulcer
mundified, the which can be by no surer means effected then by this: Take oil
of Sesamum half an ounce, Ducks and Hens grease of each one quarter of an
ounce, melt them together, and drop them oftentimes in the ear, or use
Hydromell, which is described in the end of the seventh Chapter.

Item take salt water wherein fish has bin sodden, or the pickle of salt
Olives, and use them as before: the same may you do also with the leaves of
Betony sodden in wine, which are very good for all pain of the ears: or take
the juice of Hearts tongue tempered with honey, afterward are to be used one of
these things following.

First. This is a commodious plaster for to draw out the matter therewith,
take two ounces of Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Turpentine and Wax, of each half an
ounce, Serapine one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Onions one drag. and a
half, Myrrh, Beuercod, of each one drag. dissolve the Gums in a little Wine,
and powne all that is to be powned, afterward mingle them and work thoroughly
this salve with oily hands, so that there be made a hard plaster of it.

Another. Take one ounce and a half of fine wheat flower, the muscilage of
Linseed, of Fenegreeke seed, Eeles grease (which droppeth off when they are
roasted), gold Litharge, Ceruse, and Frankincense, of each one drag. make a
plaster of it, and lay it all over the ear, and rub it also in the ear. Item
take fresh Hollihocke roots beaten small, two ounces, Linseed and Fenegreeke
seed both beaten, of each one ounce, Dill seed and Cammomill of each half in
ounce: let them sees somewhat together in butter: afterward make a soft
plaster thereof, and lay it upon the ear as is aforesaid.

Another, which is not unlike unto this former: Take the muscilage of
Hollihocke roots, of Linseeds and Fenegreek seed, of each three dragmes, Lilly
roots sodden and stamped as much as is needful for a plaster: temper amongst
it one ounce of seeds of Dill, two ounces of Cammomil, butter six ounces; if
it be too thin, let it sees til it be thicker, anoint al over the ear
therewith, and lay it upon it.

But when the pain begins to cease, it is then a sign that the impostume
is ripe and will break. But for to draw out the matter the better to mundifie
and heal, you are then to use this that hereafter follows.

Take Sarcocolla, Aloe, Dragon blood, Iron dross, Verdigrease, Myrrh and
Frankincense, of each half a dragme, temper al together with vinegar, dip a
taint therein and put it into the ear. The same does also the well known salve
called Apostolorum, whether it be new or old. Iron dross alone bruised small
and tempered with vinegar until that it be as thick as honey, rub the same in
the ear, it dries much. The like also does burnt Allume tempered with honey.

This ensuing is also marvelous good for all kinds of impostumes of the ears:
Take honey five drag. vinegar half an ounce; let them sees; put thereto one
drag. of Verdigrease bruised small: lay it with wool in the impostumated ear.
Item, whether you see the impostume in the ear or not, you are to wash the
ear with water wherein Willow leaves and Agrimony are decocted and mixed with
Oximell. If there be great pain with it, then look in the first. choose there
what you please to assuage the same: but if this matter and impostume be caused
of a hot corruption, the which may be known by the former signs, then is the
head vein to be opened, and let him bleed. Lastly also purge, as is alleged
in the pain of the ears through heat, and drop oftentimes new woman's milk.
For this is also good oil of Roses decocted with vinegar until all the vinegar
be consumed.

Some do take oil of Roses, of Violets and Vinegar, of each half an ounce,
Henbane seeds half a drag. and let them sees till the vinegar be wasted away,
then strain it through a cloth: this may be done the first three or four
days, and then use this drying and healing salve.

Take Iron dross as much as you please, make it glowing hot, and then slack
it in vinegar, and do this so five times together; afterward take thereof one
quarter of an ounce beaten small, and bruise it very small upon a bruising
stone; temper amongst it one ounce and a half of the oil of Roses, vinegar
seven dragmes, wax as much as is needful for to make a soft salve; spread
thereof upon the taint, and stop it into the ear, or sees it in vinegar and
oil. Take sheep wool with the fat called Hyssopus humida, temper therewith
as much oil of sweet Almonds, and use it in the ear, it is very wholesome:
likewise is also Verueine and Nightshade sodden.

Item take the leaves of Nightshade, beat them very small, temper some salt
amongst them, make a plaster thereof, and lay upon the ears. Take oil of
Roses and clarified Honey, of each a like much, temper it well, and drop it in
the ear: this is good for all impostumated and sore ears.

Will not the pain cease, but rather increase? then take Opium one scrup. oil
of Violets three drag. use it like as in the pain of the ears is expressed in
the first.

Or take two grains of Philonium Romanum, and a little woman's milk, drop it
in the ear, it asswageth the pain. This is to be laid on the outside, take
the muscilage of Linseed and Fenegreeke seed.

Item take Ducks grease, Hens grease, the suet of Foxes, or which you will,
tempered together with oil of Sesamum, it delayeth the pain.

If the impostume be very hot, temper Goats suet with honey, this maturateth
and asswageth the pain. For this is also meet Butter alone, or else tempered
with Calves feet oil and honey.

Item, melt Honey and oil of Cammomill together, temper some Goose dung amongst
it, let it sees a little, and then wring it through a cloth; this helps for
the opening of the impostumes. But this ensuing is more better, and more
profitable for to maturate and open all impostumes.

Take Litharge of gold and Ceruse, of each half an ounce, white Rosin,
Frankincense and Mildust, of each one ounce and a half, Sallad oil six
ounces, Fox grease, Goats suet, and hogs grease (altogether fresh) of each one
ounce and a half, muscilage of Linseed and of Fenegreeke as much as is
needful, let them sees unto a plaster, and lay it over the ears upon the
forehead and temples of the head. You must also keep a part soft with the
water of the greater Withwind, and when you will occupy it to mollify it with
Honey and moisten Cotton therein, and so use it in the ear. But if the
impostume do come through cold, the which may be perceived through the small
pain, less beating, by cold weather, continuance, and such like, then is he
to be purged again with the pills Cochiae. For this is also meet the
forementioned suets and greases, tempered with oil of Spike.

Item take a good handful of Millet, parch it in a pan that thereby it may
lose the moisture, and may warm the better, put it in a bag and lay it so
warm upon the ear: this does also parched Bran mixed with Salt: in like manner
also dried Betony laid warm in a bag upon the ear.

Item, hold the ear oftentimes over hot water, wherein Mints, Stechas, and
Marioram are decocted.

Take Rue, onions, both or each apart, use them as before. This warmeth also
the matter, and prepares it to break out. The oil of Hemp seeds dropped into
the ear, helps also to mundifie. The juice of Onions and Rue, of each a like
much meetly salted, does much dry the running of the ears: likewise also the
juice of Radishes.

In like sort are requisite for this these juices ensuing, to wit, that of
Daffodils, of shepherds purse, of Verueine, Knotgrasse, each alone or mixed:
the juice of Betony tempered with oil of Roses, and so used is very good for
all impostumes and pain of the ears.

Item take Beanestraw, sees it in water and receive the vapor in the ear, for
it is especial good for all hissing impostumes and pain of the ear which
proceed through cold.

But if these foresaid things will not help, then take one ounce and a half of
Sallad oil, steep one quarter of an ounce of Turbith a whole day therein,
then let it sees somewhat, and temper one ounce of the oil of Lillies amongst
it, Euphorbium, Beuercod, of each one drag. use it as the former: this
disperseth the matter mightily.

In like sort it is oftentimes found, that the water which runs out of the
green Ash wood laid on the fire, does help maruellously if one let a drop or
twain thereof fall into the ear.

Here before is an oil also described which is made with Beetles, which are
called in Latin Scarabaeos, the which in time of need is also to be used:
these beasts do fly in the euenings always in Summer.

Item take the salve Basilicum, melt it in the oil of Lillies, or the salve
Martiaton molten in the oil of Spike, and rub it all over about the impostume.

Bathing is also very meet with warm herbs wherein Stechas, Cammomill and Bay
berries be decocted: but first to purge with the pills Cochiae, otherwise it is
not commodious.

And if so be this impostume would fistulate, then temper Ox gall with as much
urine of a young boy, and drop it into the ear: or take the oil of Rue, Hens
grease, and Ox gall, of each half an ounce, Swines bread one quarter of an
ounce, Comin one drag. both beaten: let these sees in two ounces of vinegar
until the vinegar be consumed, whereof being strained, you shall twice a day
drop into the ear. Item, take wine wherein white Frankincense is sodden.
Another: Take red wine and honey, of each half an ounce, white Hellebore one
dragme and a half, steep a linen taint therein, and stick it in the ear.
For this is also good whatsoever is described for the fistula of the eye.

Outward sores of the Ears.. 4.
ABout the ears do also engender mo kinds of outward swellings, which are
called Parotidae or Gemelli. For that commonly there comes one under each
ear, chiefly in the time of the plague, whereof is more at large discoursed in
the sixth part. These are somewhat perilous, not only in the time of plague,
but also hurtful for the brains at other times, for that they be causes not
only of franticknes, but also of death. In like manner also if the matter
descends toward the throat, it does sometimes cause a squinancy, whereby the
patient comes otherwhiles in great peril, and might be strangled therewith.

These foresaid swellings may proceed from the blood Cholera, Phlegma, and
Melancholia: the signs of blood are fulness and hardness; if it be wroong with
the finger, the place where the finger was shows white, and in the twinkling
of an eye spreads with red: also with heavy breath and ill swallowing. If the
grief do come through Cholera, or of the subtillest blood, then there is a
biting pain and great heat, without any impediment either of breathing or
swallowing. But if it proceed of Phlegma, then is there a little pain in the
feeling, without heat or great rednes. As the other be, the Melancholia gives
great hardness and little pain, and is leaden colored: these are to be cured
as follows. First, if the patient be of a plethoricke constitution, then the
matter of the same is to be avoided and drawn away with Clisters and letting
of blood: also to be helped with setting of cups, especially if there be no
headache or Ague at hand, that thereby one do not aggrauate pain with pain:
but if there be great pain with it, then use outwardly warming and moistening
things, as butter, the yolks of eggs, sodden Hollihocke roots, Swines grease,
Figs, muscilage of Linseed, of Fenegreeke seed, oil of Olives, warm water and
such like. And if the same swelling incline to maturation, then make a plaster
of these things following which are in a readiness, as Mil dust, Linseed
meal, and Fenegreeke meal, or Wheat meal; temper them with water wherein
Mallows, Hollihocke roots, Figs or Fenegreeke are decocted; these things do
mollify, consume and maturate: when they be ripe they are to be opened, the
matter is to be let out, and the issue so long continued until all the ulcer
be fresh and well mundified. But if the swelling be caused through cold, then
are hotter things to be used for to maturate it, as oil of Cammomil, oil of
Lillies, and old Swines blood tempered amongst it, or Goats dung, Sheep dung
sodden in wine and a little honey put thereto. This is very forcible also, Ox
tallow with honey, oil of Lillies, the juice of Onions, Linseed oil, Pease
meal, and such like tempered together.

But if the malady be old, then must strong things be used thereunto, as Ireos,
Pigeon dung, of the foresaid grease or tallow of old beasts; for how much older
the beast is, so much the better is the grease.

For this is also good Badgers grease, Bears suet, the marrow of Hearts bones:
of these foresaid things may plasters be made: take which you will: of the gum
Ammoniacum, the fatnes of Sheep wool, Sal gemme, and such like, are you to
mix amongst it.

Of the bleeding at the Ears.. 5.
THis unaccustomed bleeding of the ears does come of falling, or of blows on
the head, but seldom of superfluous blood, but often through very subtle
blood, the which opens the veins in and about the ear: if it come in hot
Agues, or in great pain of the head, then follows great ease afterward: if
it be caused of falling or blows, then is the head vein to be opened on the
same side, for that thereby the blood will be drawn down and hindered that it
congeale not in the ear, and so cause an impostume: if there be pain with it,
use oil of Cammomill, Wormwood, or the juice of the same with so much wine
wherein hot bread is steeped, and so laid over all the ear. Item sees gals in
vinegar and water, and drop thereof in the ear. Take a whole Pomegranate, sees
it in vinegar, and wring it out well. Also for this is good Hares grease
decocted in vinegar. But if you be afraid of any gored or congealed blood in
the ears, for that use the juice of Garlic tempered with vinegar. If there
be any heat with it, then take the juice of Shepherds purse, the juice of
Plantaine, the juice of Housleeke, which you will, tempered with wine. These
are cooling and astringent.

Item take both the kidneyes of a Steer or Ox, with some of the tallow about
it; salt it meetly well, let them roast: of the fat which droppeth off, put a
little into the ears. All that is also described in the eighth Chapter and
seventh. of the bleeding of the nose, that is also very fit for this purpose.

Of little worms that grow in the Ears, and that do creep into them
outwardly, and such like.. 6.
Worms do grow as well in the ears as in the intrailes, although that the
same be not so common: these do make an itch with great pain. Besides that, it
happens oftentimes if one do lie upon the bad ear, that the worms do creep
or fall out. Against this are you to use any of these juices following; of
mints, of Peach leaves, Peach kernels, and water wherein Aloes is dissolved,
put of each a drop in the ear; for that they kill al worms whether it be
that they be grown or crept into them, as fleas or earwigs. The same does also
the juice of Wormwood, of Lupins, of Caper roots, Coriander roots, which have
therein an especial property; and also the juice of green nut shells: some do
decoct in wine a little Hellebore, and so drop it therein. But if these
maladies may otherwise be cured, then is the use of these roots to be omitted.

Item take burning nettles, stamp them and strain out the juice, put it into
the ears, and give him to eat of the root, it will help immediately. Take Aloe
half an ounce, Coloquint, Agaricus, of each half a drag. beat them together,
and temper them with hot water, bruise them and use as aforesaid. Take a slice
of well tosted bread, hold it to the ear, then will the worms, fleas, earwigs
and such like come out: or hold the ear wherein the worms be, on the vapor of
hot new milk, then do the worms creep after the vapor of the said milk.

Another. Take one quarter of an ounce of Wine, Honey, and oil of Roses, of
each three drag. temper them together with the brayed whites of two eggs; make
cotton moist therein, and stop the ear therewith, lie about an hour on that
side, afterward pluck it suddenly out, then will the worm hang upon it: the
same does also the wool steeped in honey. Item set a great boxing cup or glass
on the ear, then will it be drawn out whatsoever is within it.

Obstruction or stopping of the Ears through inward and outward causes.. 7.
IF the ears be stopped, and thereby the hearing hindered, the same must proceed
either through an inward or outward cause. The inward cause may be some tough
slime or moisture, worms growing in them, congealed blood, matter,
impostumations, excrescence of flesh, warts, and such like. Outward causes are
if there come any thing into them whereof we will speak severally. Do now
these obstructions proceed of excresce^ces, warts, and such like, which one
cannot see nor come at with the hand? then is it taken to be incurable: as
contrariwise if it may be seen, it may very well be cured, the which is
committed to the Chirurgians, otherwise the oil of Bay, Ox gall, Hemp oil,
are very good, each used apart. If then the stopping be through slime, matter,
or any other uncleanness, mollify it with oil of bitter Almonds, or drop honey
water warm into it two days together, and oftentimes use the one in steed of
the other: afterward take a warm tile, sprinkle it with wine, cover it with a
cloth, lay the ear upon it, to the end that the matter may run out. For this
is also good Goats gall tempered with oil, or Scorpion oil: for the stopping
with worms you have heretofore in the sixth. the remedies.

If any thing be gotten into the Ears from without.. 8.
THese things are of two sorts, as it also happens, that the one child does
put peason, small stones, or cherrie stones into the ear of another: the other
be soft things, as water, Fleas, Earewigs, and such like. If this happen, then
is not the same to be slept upon or delayed, for th^^e things require help and
advice with all speed, for there is great danger imminent, especially if that
which is cropen therein be of any bad nature, for of that comes great pain,
and consequently great sickness.

For this accident, first one of these foresaid Oils is to be dropped therein,
afterward to bath, and to sit there a good while, move neesing, and to hold in
the breath for to drive out whatsoever is in the ears: but if this will not
help, then is the same to be done with manual operation with instruments. But
if that which is gotten in be liquid and soft, as water; then use oil again,
and bend the neck always toward the side of the disease, and exercise your
self with leaping and iumping: and if so be that it come not out thereby, then
endeavor your self again to neesing. Also you may often cleanse the ear with
an ear picker covered with wool, or with a piece of a sponge, or to tie the
pith of Elderne wood at a third, and so to thrust it into the ear, or through
a little pipe let the moisture be sucked out, the which in like manner may be
done with the woormes. One may also hold the ear over the vapor of hot wine,
wherein Cammomill, Linseede, Annis seeds and such like are decocted. But if
fleas or worms be gotten into them, they do raise great pain through their
iumbling, especially the fleas: for the which take a Taint and anoint it with
a little cleaving salve made of Turpentine and Rosin, to the end that the fleas
being fast thereat, may remain hanging at it, and so be drawn out.

If this cannot be effected, then use that which is heretofore described in the
6.. of the worms in the ear, and wherewith they be to be destroyed.

Of the diminishing of hearing.. 9.
THe diminishing of hearing may proceed of many sundry occasions: the outward
causes are these, strong fumes, unexpected, vehement, and sudden noise, as when
the thunder strikes one, oftentimes has been seen that some thereby have
lost their hearing, and have been stark deaf. In like manner the South wind
does also cause it, by reason that it fills the brains with moisture,
whereby the sense of hearing is infeebled. What now concerns deafness, and
the diminishing of the hearing, thereupon do all learned men first conclude,
That if we be borne with it, or that it continue the space of two years, that
there is no hope at all left for to cure the same: and if the same do proceed
of any moisture, water, matter, or other cause, whereby the hearing is
weakened, that may be known by these means ensuing.

Take a sponge, make it very dry and warm; bind it in a double linen cloth,
and when you go to bed lay it under the ear: if you then in the morning see
the cloth spotted, then may you well adiudge, that there is some matter in the
ear whereby the hearing is hindered: but if the cloth be clean and fair,
then depends it on another cause.

If that this disease do then come through heat, yet without any
impostumation, the which thereby may easily be discerned: if the patient
complain of no heaviness, but much rather of lightness in the head, the
heat perceived in the feeling may well abide cold things, and hot things very
ill: where this is found and perceived, then to take away the great heat is
first to be endeavored, and to drop those things ensuing into it lukewarm.

The oil of Roses, oil of Violets, oil of water Lillies, temper them
together, or use each alone. Item, take a Pomegranate, wring out the juice, put
vinegar and oil of Roses unto it, of each a spoonefull, powned Frankincense
one drag. and a half, let it sees a little, and drop it therein.

Take the water of Lettice, the water of a cut Vine, mix them together, or use
each alone, the braied whites of eggs with woman's milk (mingled together or each
used alone) that gives suck to a maiden child, are also very good: the juice
of Housleek alone, or tempered with other things is also good.

Take Mallows, Hollihocke roots, Lettice, Purslaine, Willow leaves,
Nightshade, of each half a handful, let them sees together, and receive the
vapor.

But if this deafness, as it chiefly happens through cold matter, which
cannot be without wind, then is the patients head always heavy, the face
puffed up or swolen, casts out much moisture through the mouth and nose: For
this is the head vein to be opened, certain potions to be used, as Oximel of
Squils, or sirupe of Stechas, one ounce and a half, in a broth wherein
Marioram gentle, Hyssope and Fitches be decocted: and afterward to purge with
the pills Cochiae every 14. day once, in the weight of a French crown. Some
do use the Hieralogodion: two days after purging he is to gargarise with this
decoction following.

Take Hyssope, Marioram, field Mints, of each half a handful, Calmus, Mustard
seed, of each three drag. stamp and beat it with honey unto a confection,
take thereof one quarter of an ounce, temper it in eight ounces of water,
wherein Dane weed, Fullers grass, or Licebane is decocted. Also to provoke
neesing is very meet: how that is to be effected, look in the first Register.

In like manner, Masticke does draw out much slime. Also Ginger and Pieretrum,
oil of bitter Almonds alone is to be dropped into the ear, oil of Bay tempered
with a little oil of Roses, and some Pepper amongst it, or the juice of an
Onion, of Radish, of Garlic, of Daffadils (which you will) as much strong
vinegar with it, and for every ounce four grains of Euphorbium, tempered
amongst it: The vapor of water wherein woormwood is decocted, and the warm
vapor of Vinegar received into the ear opens all obstructions, and consumes
all moistures.

Take Hares gall, Fox fat, molten Pitch, of each a little quantity, temper
them together, it is very good for deafness. In like sort Sheep gall,
Sallad oil, the oil of bitter Almonds, and wine decocted together until the
wine be clean euaporated.

Of this ensuing it is said, that it has helped deafness, which has
continued thirty years, and they that find it so may justly say, Probatum est.

Fill a hottell with the blossoms of Walnuts, stop it fast with wax, that it
do not putrify, and that there come no vapor out of it, bury it in horse
dung, that it stand covered all about three quarters of a yard: let it stand so
a whole year: when you then open it, then shall you find therein a kind of
oil or moistness, that must you strain out and set in the sun certain days
together, then put a drop thereof into the ear, and you shall quickly find
amendment: At the first opening it has a loathsome stench: therefore must the
ears and nostrils be stopped, and to eschew as much as is possible the
receiving of this vapor.

But if the infirmity of the hearing do come out of any uncleanness, then is
the same to be remedied with the things described in this Chapter, in the. 3.
of the impostume of the ears, or else if it be needful, to use the manual
operation for it: and if so be that there be no matter appearing, and that the
disease does breed through repletion, or of some great former sickness, then are
the ears to be fomented with the water wherein Marioram gentle, Wormwood
Stechas, Mints, and Marioram is decocted, for that this vapor does consume and
expel all winds and thick vapors, which do stop the conduits of the hearing.
Also one pound of fresh or new Sallad oil sodden, and the vapor thereof
received into the ears is also very convenient.

Trocisces.
FVrther you are to prepare these Trocisces: Take Coloquint half an ounce,
Boras one scrup. Beuer cod, Aristologie, the juice of Wormwood, of each half a
dragm. the root of Costus 1^. gra. Euphorbium ten grains, Cowgalles as much
as is needful for to fashion Trocisces thereof: when you will use them, then
break it with the oil of bitter Almonds, and drop thereof into the ear.

This medicine is very fit for all infirmities or diminishing of the hearing,
which proceeds of wind and flegmaticke humors.

Item take Aloe, Coloquint, Euphorbium, of each one scrup temper it all
together with Cowgall, afterward divide it in small pieces and let them dry:
when you will use this, then bruise it on a stone, and mix it wit the juice of
Radish, and so drop it lukewarm into the ear, and anoint it also therewith.
Item take oil of Bay, and sees therein a cast skin of a Snake.

Take beaten Bay berries half an ounce, sees them in the oil of Lillies;
afterward wring it through a cloth, and use it as before.

Or take Balsam, oil of Juniper, the oil of bitter Almonds, temper them
together, or use each alone.

Item, take the juice of Sage, as much as you please, temper it with Ox gall,
or Goose grease, or the fat of an Eele.

Item take oil of Scorpions, of sweet Almonds, and Wormwood, of each a like
quantity, mix them together, or use each alone. The same does also the herb
Coriander decocted with Onions and water.

Or take Ants eggs, powne them, and put thereto a fresh hares Gall, as much
honey as both of them, temper them together, and use them lukewarm.

Item take a reasonable big radish, wind it about with wet towe, roast it under
the ashes, cleanse it, and afterward stamp it, wring out the juice, then put
as much Sallad oil unto it, and use it as the other.

Take Ox gall, the juice of blew flower deluce, oil of bitter Almonds, of
each a like quantity; drop it warm into the ear. Take also the juice of
Peach leaves, the juice of Wormwood, of each a like much: This is very forcible
for the impostumation of the ears, and pain of the same.

Master Tristrams water described before in the discourse of the face, and 1..
is very good for this infirmity of the hearing being dropped into them, and used
otherwise.

But if this disease be caused of too much fasting or too much watching,
whereby the face is clean fallen away, and waxen lean, and the eyes stand
deep in the head, then must one bathe oftentimes, eat well, and drink more
then before, sleep longer: to power oftentimes upon the head warm water and
oil, and to keep it moist.

The tenth Chapter. Of the Lips.
IN the face is comprehended the mouth that outwardly does not appear in
sight, but only the lips, which do hide all that is contained therein, and
accordingly are described among the inward members.

The use of the foresaid lips is diverse: First and before all they are most
needful for the speech, therefore they also by nature are wholly mooueable and
light, yea made more swift to move then any other muscle of the body: so that
justly they may be called neither skin nor flesh only, but a musklie skin.
They do cover (I say) and shut the mouth, to the end there come nothing into it
against ones will: also that they might cover the teeth from all cold air, and
whatsoever else; they do retain the spettle, that otherwise would always
driuell apparently out of the mouth. So do they also keep in the meat, the
which the tongue does thrust amongst the teeth, and might fall out of the mouth.
Lastly, both for man and beasts they are behoouefull to draw in the drink,

The learned do ascribe four kinds of maladies unto the lips, as chops and
clifts, impostumation and quauerings: others do write only of the chopping and
the swelling, as hereafter shall appear.

Of the chops or clifts of the Lips.. 1.
THis is otherwhiles caused through falls, strokes, great heat or cold, whether
it be inward or outward, and very often of nipping cold winds: the signs of
the outward causes are to be perceived by the patient. Be they then provoked
through sharp hot catarres or rheumes, which do fall out of the head? then is
there a manifest heat and drouth in the lips: in like manner also in the
forehead and in the nose: if there be no such, then is it a sign that it does
proceed of vapor. If now these chops proceed of a burnt matter, as salt
Phlegma, Cholera, or Melancholia, then are the same to be prepared for
expulsion, and to use three or four mornings together the sirupe of Fumitorie,
of Wormwood, or Oxysacchara tempered with Endive water, or such like; and then
to purge with these pills following, which are approved especial good for all
such burning matter: Take the rindes of yellow Mirobalans, Chebuli, Seen,
Epithymum, of each two scrup. Mastick half a scrup. Agaricus, and Rubarb, of
each one scrup. Diagridion two scrup. Fumitorie half a drag. make thereof pills
with the juice of Fumitorie: one may give of these pills one drag. unto one
drag. and a half. Afterward lay a Nut upon hot coals, until the shell be
somewhat blackish, then wring the oil out of the kernel, and anoint the
clifts therewith.

Item take Dragagant or gum of Cherrie trees (which you will) in the mouth,
until it begin to dissolve, afterward rub it with the tongue upon the clifts,
or dissolve it in Rosewater, and so use it.

Item, take fresh Butter, the muscilage of Fleawort, Calves sewet, Duckes
grease, honey, oil of Roses, of each a like much, melt them and temper well
amongst them the well braied white of an egg and Pease meal.

Item, burn the herb Fern to ashes, it heals marvelous well: or the Wax,
Hens grease, of each half an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, Dragagant half a
drag. Gals one quarter of an ounce, melt them all together with a little oil,
and mix the rest amongst it.

This following also is altogether wholesome: Take the Caul of the Heart or
Stag, lay it the space of three days in ley, wash it every day with fresh
water, and renew the ley every day, let it dry: the third day cut it small,
and melt it by the fire: then temper amongst it half so much hearts sewet,
Ceruse bruised small, six ounces, Camfire one dragm. or beaten Ginger and
Cloves, temper them together: but if so be that the chops do eat in, then
leave out the Ceruse.

Pomade.
POmade is especial good and safe. Take the sewet of a Heart, fresh Butter or
Barrowes grease, of each three ounces, let them melt together on the fire, put
thereto four or five small cut apples, also white wine six ounces: let all
these seethe together, until that the apples be soft; then bruise them well
together, and put Camfire unto it, Cinnamome, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each half a
drag. beaten small together, also Muscus four grains, Rosewater two ounces;
sees these again in another pot in boiling water, until all the Rosewater be
wasted away: afterward wring it through a cloth, and wash it so long with
Rosewater, until it be white. This Pomade is also good for all chops of the
hands and otherwise. For this is the Poplar ointment also good.

Item, take white Wax, Hens grease, the sewet of a Weather sheep, the juice
of Rue, of Cammomill, Dragagant, of each a like quantity, temper them together.

Take Gum, fresh oil of Almonds and Hens grease, of each a like much, Wax as
much as is needful: these two last are also special good for the
impostumation of the nipples and women's breasts, although they give suck unto
children.

The blood of the lips (do the Physicians call Haemorrhoidae) it is to be
healed like the vlceration and bleeding of the nose, which has been showed in
the eight Chapter.

The trembling or quiuering of the lips is commonly a messenger of imminent
vomiting, the which afterward cease again: what is to be used for this
quiuering, look in the Register.

If the lips be hot and swollen: for that do some advise that the navel is to
be anointed with Sallad oil, the which is easily to be approved. You have in
many places else what is to be done to all such hot swellings: of the
inuersion of the lips, shall be spoken hereafter amongst the diseases of the
mouth.

The eleventh Chapter. Of the Beard.
THis is the last part of the face which one sees outwardly, and also a goodly
ornament of man; therefore men do desire to have it grow, and stayed from
falling out.

For the growing of the Beard.. 1.
FOr to make the beard grow thick and speedily, take Southernwood, Squinanth,
of each a handful, power oil of Dill upon it, stop it close, and let it stand
a night; then afterward sees it in water two or three hours space, temper
then more amongst it, about half an ounce of powned Southernwood: after this
strain it through a cloth, and anoint the place therewith, where you desire
to have a beard.

Another.
TAke oil of Dill two ounces, of Southernwood half a handful, Squils two
scrup. wine three ounces, let these sees so long together until all the wine
be consumed, and then strain it through a cloth and use it as before. Look
for this also in the third Chapter. 1.

Against the falling out of the Beard.. 2.
TAke as many Bees as you please, kill them and lay them in the sun or
elsewhere, beat them to powder, make with Sallad oil a salve thereof, and
anoint therewith the bald place. Take five drag. of Wax, the oil of Palma
Christi seeds two drag. and a half, liquide Styrax and Myrrh, of each 3.
drag. Laudanum one ounce, Euphorbium, wild Rue, Gum, Cantharides, of each three
drag. powdered Bees or Waspes two ounces, melt all that is to be molten, and
temper the powned things amongst it: therewith anoint the place of the beard
when you go to bed; but chafed well first: and in the morning wash it off
again; let also the beard be often shaven away.

This ensuing is also good for the hair of the head and of the eyebrowes.

Take the oil of Behen, sees Cantharides therein, whereof the head and wings
be abated, make it smell well with Muscus and Amber, and use it as before.

Even as of all outward accidents of the head and the face, mention has been
made before; so will we now also speak of all inward diseases and members of
the same. And first of the Brains.

The twelfth Chapter. The Brains, and all that concerns them.
LIke as is already alleged, the brains are the uppermost and chiefest of
all the inward members of man's body, a place and abode of the understanding,
memory and judgment, the which are shapen, and by nature fashioned with many
kinds of wonderful, several, and proper shapes, for they be without blood,
without flesh, soft and congealed together like as a scum, also as marrow,
moist, cold, and of themselves insensible; where they nevertheless through the
sinews, do impart and send to all other members the sensiblenesse and motion.
With this part of the body are all beasts endued (which have much or little
blood) but most of all men above all beasts, and the men more than the women:
the foresaid brains are also moister in man than in any beast.

Hence do also spring all the sinews, that thence (as is specified) do spread
themselves thorough the back over all the whole body, strengthening and
conioyning it, making it moveable and sensible. Unto the brains do also
stretch and reach the right beginning of all veins out of the heart, and there
do they end: from thence comes also sleep, which imparteth rest unto the
whole body.

It is also the second part (next to the heart) that is formed in the mothers
womb.

This precious and tender part is also subject unto many accidents, which bring
with them very great inconveniences, like as for example, if so be that the
brains through falls or strokes be annoyed or molested; then does it oftentimes
come to pass, yea commonly, that the patient becomes mute and dumb: like as
also in the dead palsy the members are altogether nummed or utterly lamed, and
so loss of understanding ensues. But before that we do come to these
infirmities, we purpose here to admonish, that before the description of other
diseases of the head, those things are not discovered, which might be
convenient for the brains; as Neesing, Treacle, Mithridate, Eyebright wine,
conserve of the same, and such like. With these may be also well annexed, all
that strengthens the brains, dries the superflous moisture, takes away
heat, and whatsoever might be else. But because our whole book is full with
such like things, therefore it is the less needful for to write much thereof.

For to dry the brains.
FOr to dry and strengthen the brains, you have amongst other, many and
sundry remedies. When you go to bed, swallow down two or three little pieces
of Frankincense, this strengthens and dries the brains marvelous much. The
smell of Sugar is also very good received at the nose.

Certain Aromaticall wines which in the last part are described with their
operations, and other more, as Calmus, compounded waters, Master Tristrams
water, are also very good for this use.

And especially this following: Take Ireos three ounces, Lauander flowers,
Rosemarie flowers and the herb, Rose leaves, of each one ounce and a half,
red Styrax, Benzuin, of each one ounce, Nigella, prepared Coriander, Epithymum,
Stechas, of each one dragm. make a powder thereof, furre a cap therewith and
wear it on the head. You shall have also many more such like whereas we shall
discourse of the giddiness of the head.

But if you desire any cooling things for the brains, whereto you have not
only commodious things to lay thereon in the first Chapter and second. but
also in other places where we discourse of the Ague and Plague, as much as
concerns their virtues and infections of the brains; we will begin with that
costly treasure of memory.

Of the Memory.. 1.
Memory is a retaining of acts either heard or seen: Or memory is a
comprehension of the things ouerpast; the which the mind, as present, does
keep and retain.

Item, memory is a retaining, establishing, and preserving of matters which
have been conceived in the spirit. If so be that this memory be hurt, then
follows forgetfulness of matters which be past and done. And there be two
sorts described thereof by the Physicians: The first they do call the greater
Lethargus, Lethargus.
the sleeping disease, whereof we will speak apart hereafter. The other is
less and without Ague, that may in time so take the upper hand, that not only
the memory will be enfeebled, but also that men lose their understanding, and
become childish and foolish. The cause of this is commonly a bad and cold
complexion: otherwhiles also adjoined with cold and moisture which ouerruleth
the hinder part of the head. If it be caused only through cold, Stupor. Cold
brain.
then it is Stupor, astonishment: These sick persons do speak neither of
things past, nor yet things to come; they care for nothing, they sleep and
wake meetly, they feel no drought of the tongue nor yet of the nose.

Cold and dry.
But if this disease be caused through cold and drith, then can the patient
sleep, thinks well upon things which be over past, but not of any thing that
is present: the mouth and nose are always dry. Cold and moist
If it come through moisture and cold, then it is the sleeping disease, which
forgets all former things wholly and thoroughly, and all present very
quickly: they have very moist brains; so that the moisture runs out at the
nose and mouth. If heat and drith be causes, Mania.
then comes it to Mania, that is, the right madness.

To the end now, that this precious treasure of memory may be continued and
kept: thereof you shall have sufficient instructions which you find of the
sleeping sickness, astonishment and madness: so that we will only speak
here of that kind of forgetfulness which is caused of cold and moisture
together, and is not an absolute Lethargus: nevertheless does reign most.

For this is to be applied for a general rule to defend the head from al
superfluous moisture, how the same is to be effected you have many and sundry
means, especially there whereas it is discoursed of the cold pain of the
head, in the first Chapter. 2. and also hereafter where we shall speak of
giddiness.

But to the end we have an orderly rule for to prevent this forgetfulness,
therefore we will here prescribe an orderly means for an example.

If this disease proceed of an e^cessiue uncleanness, surfeiting of meat, of
drink, of cold, and such like outward causes, then are they to be shunned, and
good government observed, whereof we will once again speak more at large.

For this, must also strong Clisters be used, take Consolida Saracenica,
Betonie, S. John's woort, both kinds of Sage, both sorts of Centorie, Rosemarie,
Stechas, Flouramour. Cammomill, of each half a handful, Baulme a handful,
Coloquint one drag. and a half: al these things are to be bounden in a cloth
and sodden in sufficient water, afterward wrung, out and to take of this
decoction 12. or 16. ounces, wherein shall be tempered Hiera Picra, Benedicta
Laxatiua, of each five drag. Salt one quarter of an ounce, oil of Lillies two
ounces and a half. This Clister (as is expressed) is strong; will you then
have a milder? then use them that be described for the cold pain of the head:
for a preparatiue potion is meet Oxymel Squilliticum, with the decoction of
Galingale, or Calmus. Afterward purge with these pills following, take Pillulae
Cochiae one drag. Coloquint, Mastrix, Bdellium, of each half a dragm. make
pills thereof with the juice of Baulme, you may give them all together to a
strong man, although they be strong. Hereafter you may use certain days
Treacle, Mithridate, or Aurea Alexandrina one drag. at one time: afterward
purge again with Hiera Logodion, or Simplici, according to the importance of
the matter. You must anoint the head with Beuercod dissolved in vinegar, and
oil of Lillies, or rub the neck with some of these waters of life hereafter
described, like as most of all those waters are requisite for this use which be
described in the eight part. For this, is also convenient, Ginger, Masticke,
Pieretrum chewed or bounden in a cloth by reason of his heat, they draw out
much moisture. In like manner are things of a good savor or smell to be holden
before the nose, and those that be of hot nature, as Muscus, Ambra, Lignum
Aloes, Cloves, Nutmegs, Indie Spica, Flouramour, and such like sauors: take
Frankincense, Pepper, Cipers roots, and Myrrh, of each a like much; make with
decocted honey a conserve thereof, give thereof a dragm. at one time.

The ancient Physicians commend much to take every morning one drag. of
Frankincense, Pepper half a scrup. and that with a draught of wine.

Order of Diet.
FOr forgetfulness of cold and moist causes are always warming and drying
things to be used; the dwelling place must be clear and clean, and carnal
copulation as much as is possible to be refrained, and that not only therein,
for it is seldom found, that they that be immoderate therein, have a good
memory or understanding: Mustard, Garlic, and all things which be of cold
nature: in like manner, all excess of meat and drink is also very hurtful:
likewise also Mutton, Marrow of Mutton bones, sleep immediately after meat,
and such like: to the contrary all dry fruits which be parched, as Hasell
nuts, and Chestnuts be very good.

Also all Fowls are very meet for this, and the brains of the same, whereof
we have made mention in the other description of diet, where we have spoken of
the memory, ordinary going to stool, and making water, etc. moderate mirth,
fresh water wherein Baulme, Fennel, Bay leaves, and such like are decocted.

The head may also twice a week be washed with ley wherein Cammomill,
Rosemarie, Sage, Baulme, Betonie, or which one will, is steeped or decocted.

Like as for example to be followed, here we describe for these matters.

A good powder.
An especial powder for memory.
TAke three ounces of Seen leaves, Seduarie, Cumin, Parsley, and Dill seed, of
each one ounce, Ginger half an ounce, Cloves, Nutmegs, Calmus, Galingall,
Pimperuel roots, Sage, Rue, Valerian, Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Sugar three ounces, powne all small, and temper them together; take thereof in
the morning and evening about one drag. at one time: this powder does not only
strengthen the brains, but also the memory: it is also good against
giddiness of the head, cleanses blood, and is good for the stomach,
strengthens the womb, preserves the lights from all superfluous humors,
withstandeth all diseases of the heart, pain of the liver, of the milt, of the
gall, drives away the cough, makes a good color and a clear face. It is also
good to be used against all swellings, and against all pestilential air:
holden in the mouth, it takes away all toothach, stinking breath, and keeps
men in good health.

The water of Carduus Benedictus is said to strengthen the memory, to take
away the pain of the head, to amend the giddiness, and all other accidents of
the head, if so be that one take the water or the decoction of the herb every
morning two or three ounces at one time.

Coriander seed and bitter Almonds confected with Sugar, do strengthen also
the memory and the brains.

You have heretofore in the second Chapter and first. of two ley bags which
strengthen memory, and in like manner in the eight Chapter 8.. of the oil of
Bricks which is also requisite for it. Secondly, there be also prepared for
this many compounded wines, as the wine of Marioram gentle, which not only
strengthens the memory, but also causes it, if it were lost, to return
again.

Another mean for to strengthen the memory.
THere was by our time at Canterbury here in England, a Canon, a Doctor of
Divinity and also in the Law, Johannes Coletus.
named Johannes Coletus, to whom by that time he was sixteen years old, was
an experiment imparted by a Christened Jew, whereby he obtained such a
marvelous strong memory, that he retained and kept all that ever he read in
all his life time: the which when he was in his 39. year of age, he lying at
the point of death, his friends prayed him to disclose and reveal this secret
remedy and experiment unto them: where he has declared that before he had a
very gross and hard understanding; but through the use of this experiment he
afterward obtained such a sharp wit and memory, that he could not only
remember and hold in mind that which he read, but also all that he heard and
saw: Insomuch that he could recite by heart from word to word the Decreta,
Decretals, the orders of all the Emperors laws, with their expositions,
Aristotle and other authors which he had seen and read. Also how many names
that were rehearsed before him, he could afterward without missing one repeat
them again.

Therefore may this experiment be reputed of a great value, and as a gift of
God, because that thereby men may with so little trouble attain unto so great
a matter.

First, the head is to be cleansed with these things following: Take Pieretrum,
Marioram, Galingale, Ginger, Caraway, seed of broad Plantaine, prepared white
Mustard seed, of each a like much: this being beaten gross together, and if
this powder wey about two ounces, then sees it in a quart of water stopped close
too, when it has now sodden well, then put a quart of strong wine unto it, and
an ounce of clear honey, let it sees again until about two fingers breadth
of the liquor be wasted: herewith are you once every morning (in the increasing
of the moon) to gargarise well and many times, holding it long and warm in
the mouth, to the end it may vapor up into the head.

Afterward make this potion following: Take Ginger, long Pepper, of each one
dragme, Galingall one scrup. Cloves, Cubebs, of each one drag. and a half;
powne them al together to powder, and bind them in a linen cloth, let them
sees well together in two quarts of Wine stopped fast as aforesaid: afterward
let it stand covered until it be clear, whereof you are to drink every morning
fasting, and at evening going to bed a good draught, and that before you shall
have anointed with the salve which shall hereafter be described. The virtue of
this wine is for to draw a superfluous moisture out of the head.

This being done, then place your self in Somer time in the Sun, and in
Winter season by the fire, and kembe your hair softly a long time; so that
thereby the pores may be opened: afterward wash your head with the water of
Rue, and drink a good draught of wine, and thereupon eat a bit or twain of
bread that has been steeped in the wine, then fast so unto the evening. Your
supper must also be sober, your sleep quiet and undisturbed: continue this
many days together, the longer the better.

When now the veins be warm with kembing, then anoint the head and the
temples with this salve following. Take white Lillies, Colewoort leaves, wild
Baulme, of each one drag. powne them together, put them in a pot, power therein
two ounces of Sallad oil, fresh butter as much as all the rest, three
spoonefuls of the spirit of wine (which has been rectified at least four
times) water of Rue, of Sage, of Celendine, of each two spoonefuls, old white
wine five spoonefuls, temper them well together, set it so six or eight hours
in a warm place, then strain it through a cloth; afterward sees the liquor
until it be as thick as honey, (and that by a small mild fire) then set it in
the Sun so long till it be of the color of Copper: This salve must be
always made betimes, and it can continue good the space of two years. Also it
behooves to gather all the herbs for distillation when the days be at the
longest: and then may also most meetely this salve be prepared. This salve must
you (as is rehearsed) use after that the head is purged, you must anoint well
the hinder parts of the head and the temples with it; afterward cover it with
a leatherne cap or hat, so that the head may be warm that the said salve may
have her operation the better in the blood and brains. In the evening is the
head to be washed with good warm wine, and one must keep a good diet, and use
meats that be light of digestion, also use moderate drinking. This order is to
be kept at the first by the space of four days, and so to continue it the
space of a whole year, every eight weeks once two or three days together.

The next year afterward you may choose one day upon which it is good to take
Physic, and then use this salve every three months once, when the Moon
increases: The third year it is sufficient once in twelve months, and
afterward so long as you live, once in two years.

Of the giddiness of the head, and infirmity of the Brain.. 2.
THis disease is called of the Grecians Scotomia, and of the Latinists Vertigo,
which is a giddiness or swimming of the head, we call it also the swimming of
the head, for that it seems, that all which one sees runs round about: or
the sight fails when he will behold any thing, and he thinks that he sees
swarming before his eyes many maruels, and things which be of strange colors,
yea it often happens, that his eyes be very dark, and must fall to the
ground: like as also it sometime happens to a sound body, if they run too
much about: or to such as look too much downward from a great height, or upon
a quick turning thing, or into running waters.

This disease do they chiefly get, that are wont to frequent much the Sun,
and their heads have been ouerheated: It is also caused of the stomach, if
that it be ouercharged with any superfluity, whereby the mouth of the stomach
is harmed, and sends some bad vapors toward the head, which do cause this
swimming or giddiness.

In winter time and when the wind is southerly, then are all people more
subject to this giddiness, than in dry summer. Of this giddiness the
Physicians do make many kinds, like as also it is diverse according to the
nature of the humor whereof it is caused: but to speak of the foresaid
giddiness, when any one thinks that all that he sees runs round about,
the sight vanishes as he would fall to the ground, the face and the eyes wax
red, the veins swell, the ears show themselves great and full of blood,
thereby it may easily be adjudged, that it is caused through superfluous blood
in the head, the which troubles and molesteth the brains: therefore is this
sick person to procure presently afterward to open the vein behind the ear,
and to let out three or four ounces of blood; for that is a certain remedy
for this disease. And further, for all other spices of this swimming, of
whatsoever cause that they may proceed: for if so be that this giddiness do
continue long, it is much to be doubted, that the falling sickness or the dead
palsy may come thereby. In like manner are boxing cups vnpickt to be set above
upon the head, in the neck, upon the shoulders, and on the legs. For this also
are certain lotions of the feet to be used, made with herbs which do
strengthen the head, whereof before in the first Chapter 3.. for the heat of
the head, and in the second Chapter 12.. sundry are described. But although
these foresaid veins do not appear and make show, and nevertheless the face
were always red, then must the median be opened, boxing cups, as is said, to
be used, to moysten the head with vinegar of Roses, and with oil of Roses, and
to eschew all hot meats, much sleep, long watching, to look from great
height downwards, and such like things: Lintels, milk, kids flesh prepared
with veriuice, juice of Pomegranates or with vinegar, roasted pears or apples
after supper are very good for him: of herbs, Lettice and Purslaine with
vinegar may he also eat well: for his drink he may also temper vinegar or the
juice of Pomegranates, Sugar water decocted with Fleawoort, or any small thin
wines.

For purging are meet yellow Mirobalans, especially if the giddiness be
caused of Cholera, the which are thus to be used: Take one ounce and a half of
yellow Mirobalans beaten gross, sees them in eight ounces of water at the
least, put thereto one ounce of sower Dates, let them sees together unto the
half; then temper amongst it three or four ounces of sirupe of Violets, or of
Roses, and so give it to the patient in the morning fasting.

Take six ounces of whay, lay therein to steep one dragme and a half of
Rubarbe a whole night, wring it afterward out, and give it to the sick person
cold or lukewarm.

Take ten dry Prunes, sower Dates one ounce, sees them in six ounces of
water, then take thereof three ounces, and mix amongst them two dragmes and a
half of the Electuarie De succo Rosarum, and drink it warm. Item take sower
Dates, Manna, of each one ounce, temper them with three or four ounces of
Prune broth.

Also these pills following may be used: Take Pillula foetidae, de Sarcocolla,
of each one scruple, temper them, and make thereof seven pills.

After the purging he is to keep him quiet, and to cover the belly with warm
clothes. But if to this giddiness there happens no redness in the face, nor
any ague, it may be concluded thereof, that the cause proceeds of cold, whereof
the matter lies in the stomach, which there provoke the patient to wambling
and vomiting, whereto the patient is then to urge himself, thereby to be rid
of it; and that through this means: Take Radishes, or Horseradish, one ounce,
the seed of Orage and of Asarabacca, of each half an ounce, sees all this in
twelve ounces of water unto four ounces: unto this strained decoction you are
to add half an ounce of Oil, Saffron one drag. vinegar four ounces, give
thereof two spoonefuls in the evening after meat. Preparatiue potions are to be
used according to ye cause of the disease, for the space of certain days, and
then to take these pills following, Aurea or Cochia, the weight of one dragm. Or
in the stead of these pills, to use half an ounce of Hiera Picra, and Oxymel
Compositum one ounce, with four ounces of water, wherein Hyssope and Zeduarie
is decocted.

It chances also oftentimes, that at the first this giddiness does come with
some swarming or fantasies which appear before the eyes, the which
nevertheless in truth is nothing so. This the Physicians do call Scotomiam and
Imaginationes, whereof before in the seventh Chapter and 12,. is spoken at
large. Of the which very many be helped by these means following: Take
Eyebright two ounces, Mace half an ounce, beat them small; give thereof after
the purging half a drag. or two scruples with wine or flesh broth. What further
concerns this kind of giddiness, you may discern hereafter, where we speak
of Paralysis, with yt which this swimming does agree. This patient must
refrain from all meats and drinks which be cold of nature: but Kids, Mutton,
Pullets, Partridges, Pheasants, and all other fowls that have their abode in
hilly countries, he may well eat them, yet rather roasted than sodden: in like
sort eggs and all that is dressed with wheat or Rice: small red wine, or rather
honey water is to be his ordinary drink. But if this will not help, and the
foresaid giddiness do still continue, then is this commended for a principal
remedy, to wit, to open the head by actual or potential Cauteries above upon
the seame (which is called Sutura Coronalis) to the end that thereby all bad
vapors, which cause these infirmities in the brains might exhalate. Some use
in stead of ye foresaid Cauterie this corrosiue salve following: Take
Cantharides (the heads and wings broken off) two ounces, sower dow half an
ounce, temper them with spirit of wine or vinegar, lay them behind in the
neck, and behind upon the brawnes of the legs, in bigness of half a doller;
let them lie so long until they raise a blister, that is, about twelve hours
or somewhat more. These blisters are to be holden and kept open, with the
laying upon them of a Colewoort leaf as long as is possible. But if so be that
neither ague, nor vomiting, nor any other impostume do befall with it, and yet
nevertheless the giddiness persist and endure, then is the sick person
oftentimes to be purged with the pills Cochiae, and to withdraw him (as is said)
from cold meats, because that the cause of this disease proceeds of cold.
Further, he is to be let smell to a little bag of Annis seeds, and in like
sort must he wear a cap with Annis seeds upon his head, and receive the vapor
of the decoction of Annis seeds into his nose; for that the smell is very
requisite, because it dries and warmeth well. Also the head is to be cleansed,
as oftentimes has been showed: but this ensuing is especially good for it:
Take the juice of wild Cucumbers one ounce, honey water wherein Marioram is
decocted, two ounces; temper and draw them into the nose: but take before, thy
mouth full of clear water, so that it may come the less into the mouth.

Gargarismes.
GArgarismes are also to be used for this purpose, thereby to expel all
flegmaticke humors which cause this malady: Take Betonie, Hyssope, of each one
handful, Licorice, Rue, and Raisons (the stones being taken out) of each one
ounce, Pieretrum, Ireos, of each half an ounce, Mustard seed, Licebane, Ginger
and Masticke, of each one quarter of an ounce, clarified honey three ounces,
seethe them in sufficient store of water, and scum them well, take thereof
before and after meat, at each time two spoonefuls in the mouth, holding it
long therein, and having gargarized, spet it out again.

With this may you also use chewed Mastick, Picretrum decocted in wine or
water, or steeped. But always (as is admonished before) the roots knit in a
cloth: for it is otherwise too strong.

Item, take Mustard seed, Marioram, Pieretrum, long Pepper and Sage, of each
one quarter of an ounce, seethe it to the half, being strained, use it as
before.

The Pieretrum has an especial operation against the giddiness, therefore it
is also to be decocted and beaten to pap with the whites of eggs, and so laid
upon the head.

A powder for meat.
TAke Nutmegs, prepared Coriander, of each half an ounce, Misselden of the
Oak, Piony seed peeled, and Galingale, of each one drag. Calmus, Betonie,
Cubebs, and Cumin, of each half a drag. Sugar, as much as you please. You have
heretofore in the first. a good powder for the memory, which is also meet for
this purpose: and this following is very necessary for it.

Take the juice of Fennel one ounce, Sugar two ounces, sees it together like
to Manus Christi.

An Electuarie.
TAke a pound of Currants (well cleansed) Licorice cut small, Buglosse water and
Endive water, of each six ounces, set them sees together, and afterward
wring it out hard: in this decoction are you to put of preserved Mirobalans,
Chebuli and Emblici, of each six ounces, honey of Roses and Sugar, five
ounces; let it sees until it be somewhat thicker than honey: afterward
clarify it with the whites of eggs: when it is now cold, then temper amongst it
one drag. and a half of Cinnamom powder, preserved Nutmegs one ounce, Lignum
Aloes, Cloves, of each one drag. Fennel and Annis seeds, of each half a
drag. conserve of Roses two ounces and a half. Of this confection you are to
use every week the quantity of a Walnut. Item take Cinnamom, Cloves, Fennel,
Galingall, chew them long in the mouth, and afterward spet it out again. The
confected Calmus is also much commended for this giddiness, and in like manner
confected Coriander, as is more said in other places, where we have entreated
of the memory.

Preserved Mirobalans are also especial good after meat, also being dry to
chew them in the mouth; for that they do hinder the vapors ascending up to the
head, and consume all watery moisture: also how good Carduus Benedictus water
is for this use, look in the place where we have spoken of the memory: the
Treacle and Mithridate are also much commended for this purpose.

The order of diet.
THey that be troubled with this giddiness ought to live very soberly and
moderately, to leave wine, or to water it well: if the disease come through
heat, then is heat to be eschued; if through cold, then is cold to be
shunned: after meals take a piece of tosted bread and eat it. His meats must
be light of digestion, and use little: like as is sufficiently showed in the
hot headache.

Of franticknesse, madness, or doting, and such like infirmities.. 3.
THe diseases of the brains are divided into three kinds, to wit, first if
their accustomed operation be hindered. Secondly, if they be perished and
enfeebled. Thirdly, if they be altered from their good disposition and nature
into another: like as when a man falls into foolishness and forgetfulness,
that he forgets his writing, reading, and his nearest kindred, yea his own
name: the which in truth, proceeds out of a coldness of the brain, like to
the palsy, and falling sickness, and such like accidents which suddenly
assault men. But if this foresaid disease (whether it happen in the
understanding or in the memory) be small, then it is a sign that the
coldness is not great, Delirium.
for these diseases have also their greatness and smalnesse. Delirium, doting
childishness, be it howsoever it will, it comes of some bad humor and
distemperance of the brains, and is an erring, troubled and spoiled motion of
the principal virtues of the mind; and if so be that an Ague befall with it,
Phrenitis.
then it is a right Phrenitis, that is Frenzy; which is not only caused
through hot humors, but is also admixed with some Phlegma in the brains: but
in case there be no ague with it, Mania.
then is this malady called Mania, madness; and springs out of hot humors,
and chiefly of Cholera, which inflameth the brain too much; Melancholia, of
which issue only despair, Dementia.
sorrow and fear, and that which is called in Latin, Dementia, (to wit, when a
man is wholly out of his right mind) proceeds only of cold humors, like as
hereafter again shall be more at large declared.

Of dotage and childishness, called in Latin Delirium.. 4.
THis disease is for the most part in all sicknesses or infirmities of the
brains, for that in case the same be distempered, (be it by whatsoever manner
that may be) then will the understanding be thereby wholly or in part
enfeebled, according to the greatness or smalnesse of the humor whence this
disease is caused.

When now these doting conceits and strange thoughts do come without crying,
Melancholia.
calling, or noise, as if he were possessed, then it is the very true
Melancholia.

But if the madness do come with chiding, scolding, leaping, cursing, and such
like misdemeanors, then it is the right Mania, or madness, with all her
syptomes, which do assail him no otherwise then as if he were possessed.

If there be with this madness laughing, merriment, friendly semblance, then
is the same always better then any of the rest: but if this come through burnt
melancholicke humors, then it is the worst, and the behavior none otherwise
then as if he were possessed. Others make of these Delirium or Desipientia, 12.
kinds, whereof the most part are here described.

And to the end we might first of all have an example how that these kinds of
sicknesses are best to be helped; therefore we will set before us a youth that
has lost his understanding, and is become distraught.

At the first is very meet for it a very good government or order of diet, and
to use all things which be warm and moist, to eat good raised bread, which is
above three days old, otherwise he is to eschew all things that are made of
dow: young Veale, Mutton, Lamb, Pullets, Capons, young wild swine; in fine, he
is to eat all that is young whether it be wild or tame, and to refrain all
that is old.

Of herbs are meet for him Endive, Spinach, Purcelane. As concerning fruit,
fresh Almonds, Hasell nuts, sweet Cherries, Melons, Gourds, Pompions, fresh
Figs, Grapes, sweet Pears, Apples, oil of sweet Almonds, or fresh Butter.
He must refrain from Vinegar; or if he will use it, he must delay it with
Sugar or water: yet is he rather to use the juice of Limons or Veriuice, but
seldom, and that made sweet with Sugar.

For his drink he is to take sweet wine, and clear wine well watered, for
that he will be very soon drunken, which is hurtful for him. In this country
in stead of the foresaid wine, small beer is commonly to be used: he is to
forbear all old and salt flesh.

But if so be he cannot forbear wine, and were yet notwithstanding inclined to
drink much, then are you to steep therein prepared Coriander seed, Sorrel
seed, Purcelane seed, with the flowers of water Lillies, this will resist and
withstand all drunkenness.

Can he be satisfied with drinking of water? then let him drink none other
then barley water or sugared water.

Buglosse leaves or the roots of the same are always good, whether they be
used in meats or drinks, and all that may be made with Buglosse. Buglosse
good for Melancholy.


He must also moderately move and stir in going and standing. Copulation must
he utterly eschew, because that thereby the best blood of a man is wasted, and
worn away and the natural forces infeebled.

He must kembe the head oftentimes, sing much, use music which is very
commodious for all melancholicke persons, his sleep must be somewhat longer
then it was wont to be when he was in health.

Because that this matter is very hard to be purged, and yet nevertheless it
must be done for the most part, then is always the advice of a learned
Physician to be followed, the opening of the Piles or Hemorrhoides is
especially commended for this disease. One may also drink many days together,
three ounces of the juice of Buglosse, for it is marvelous good for all kinds
of melancholy. Also is very good two ounces of the juice of Hops (being wrong
out) if it be presently taken without settling, preserved Citron pills one
spoonful taken in the morning early, and in the evening two hours before
meat are very meet, or two ounces of the sirupe of Citron pills, with three
ounces of Lettice water used before purging,

Comfortable Electuaries.
TAke the flesh of a roasted Partridges breast twelues ounces, the roots of
white Behen the flowers of Borage, Buglosse, Seduary, of each one dragme,
Saffron one scruple, Mace, Saxifrage, of each one scruple, Iacint, Smaragd,
Saphires, and Hearts bones, of each half a scruple, three leaves of beaten
gold, fired gold half a dragme, prepared pearls one dragme, three ounces of
fresh Pine apple kernels: let this steep 24. hours with the flesh in foures
ounces of white wine, and two ounces of the juice of Quinces, powne them all
small, and sees 12. ounces of white Sugar with the foresaid liquor, temper it
all together: give thereof every morning half an ounce, and drink thereupon
two ounces of Buglosse water: afterward take before dinner and supper one
quarter of an ounce of it: for besides that it is good for the giddiness, it
does also strengthen all the members of the body.

In like manner mark, that all which strengthens the heart, whether it be
hot or cold, the same also strengthens the brain.

Of Phrenitis, or franticknesse with an Ague.. 5.
WE will now discourse of that kind of franticknesse, which the learned call
Phrenitis, which we define thus: Phrenitis is a frenzy or bereauing of the
wits with an hot Ague, or Phrenitis is a doting and distraction or spoil of
the understanding, which endures not always, and that assaileth one with
quiuering, small voice, and with an ague, which does also most proceed of some
inflammation or swelling in the brains. And although there be many kinds of
franticknesse, yet may they be divided into two principal sorts; the one which
is caused of blood, the other of Cholera: out of both which, the third kind
which is Melancholia, as a mixture does sprout and spring.

They that be burdened with the first kind, they may adiudge all things like as
they be, know what it is; but how to think of it and use it do they know
nothing at all. They that have the second kind of franticknesse, they do know
in their thoughts or forecast nothing at all: but adiudge much otherwise of all
that ever they see then it is. For both these sorts have you a notable history
recited of Galen. They which be charged with the third sort, they be so
distraught of their wits, that they can neither discern right, nor adiudge
right. And now for to come to the right signs of the foresaid diseases, we
will rehearse these following.

The signs of (...).
First inward Agues, heaviness of the head, drought, redness of the eyes and
face, pain of the head, shunning of light, and strong motion of the pulse.
Item, unquietness, much and filthy talk, drith and blackness of the tongue,
tumbling up and off from the bed: their urine white, quick and strong
breathing, crying out in the sleep, fear, impudency, do not cover their
priuities being uncovered, forgetfulness of all that is passed, terrible
dreams, etc.

And if, besides the foresaid signs, the tongue be red and yellow, and the
understanding enfeebled with much watching: then it is a perfect Phrenitis,
that is, franticknes, with a strong Ague. For this the remedy is not to be
delayed, but before they (which do proceed of blood) do take root, he is
strongly to be let blood in the head vein, even till he swoune, if nature may
abide and suffer it.

But if so be that the sickness have endured already past the fourth day, and
settled it self, then is the vein of the forehead also to be opened on the top
of the nose, and to be diligent for to open the Hemorrhoides, the which is very
requisite and sure.

And if so be that for some causes the opening of a vein be hindered, then is
blood to be forced out of the nose, or at the least to set boxing cups on the
shoulders.

But if the cause be of Cholera, then is the body to be purged through
Clisters, as hereafter follows.

Take two handfuls of Lettice, Barley half a M. Mallows, Mercury, Violet
leaves, of each half a handful, the flowers of water Lillies one ounce, and a
little bran: sees these together in a sufficient quantity of water: then take
of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, put thereto Sallad oil, and
prepared Cassia, of each one ounce, extracted Prunes five dragm. set this
Clister fasting.

Another: Take Mallows, Blites, Mercury, Violet leaves, and water Lillies, of
each one M. let them sees together in sufficient water: afterward take twelve
ounces thereof and temper amongst it Triphera Sarrecenica one ounce, strained
Prunes an ounce and a half, oil of Violets, two ounces, Salt half a drag.
Further to purge withal, sour Dates are especially fit: for they do not only
expel the bad humors, but also alter them. These are thus to be prepared.

Take twelve ounces of sour Dates, sees them in 24. ounces of water until
the fourth part be consumed: this decoction is to be strained through a cloth,
and to give him five ounces thereof at once. Item, take three ounces of Manna,
temper it in the decoction of Prunes, and give it him in the morning.

But if so be that the humors be burnt, then sees with the Prunes a few Seen
leaves, a little Fumitorie, and Epythimum, of each one quarter of an ounce, the
roots of Polypodium one ounce, and in four ounces of this decoction, temper
the Manna and sour Dates.

Another. Take yellow Mirobalans one ounce and a half, stamped Prunes two
ounces: sees them together in ten ounces of water unto the half, or till that
there remain four ounces over: then give it so.

Or take one quarter of an ounce of Rubarbe, decoction of Prunes four ounces,
beat the Rubarbe and so temper it amongst the decoction; add unto it two
ounces of sirupe of Violets: let this stand together the space of twelve
hours, and give it him early in the morning. But if so be that the humor be
burnt, then put some Seen leaves unto it, Epithymum, and the roots of
Polipodie, of each one quarter of an ounce.

After the foresaid purging, may the head vein upon the hand or in the elbow,
be safely opened, and boxing cups fixed upon the shoulders. Also to open the
Saphea, and to move the Hemorrhoides, if so it seem requisite.

If this sickness be caused of blood.
TAke twelve ounce of the juices of Plantaine, juice of Shepherds purse and
Rosewater, of each four ounces, Vinegar two ounces; make clothes or two wet
therein, and then lay them on the forehead, and so over half the head.

Item, take Violet leaves, Lettice, and powned Barley, of each 1. M. Poppie
heads, roots of Southernwood, and water Lillies, of each half a handful,
Henbane, Poppie seeds, and Lettice seed, of each half an ounce, Cammomill,
Melilot and Mallows, of each half an M. Sees them all together in a
sufficient quantity of the water of Sage: afterward take a Sponge and
therewith moisten from the forehead, or from thence where the hair begins,
unto the neck behind as often as you please. Item, take the juice of
Housleeke, of Lettice, of Purslaine, and of Nightshade, of each three ounces,
Rosewater two ounces, Vinegar one ounce, temper and use them as before: this
brings also sleep with it, and especially if one temper therewith two ounces
of the juice of Poppie heads: cannot you get the juice? then take the distilled
water it self, if you will have a plaster of it, temper Barley meal amongst
it.

Note also that these cooling things are to be used only in the beginning of
the frenzy: for that if it be seen that the matter begins to yield, there
are other things to be adhibited; as when it beg inneth to depart, then take a
sucking whelpe and take out the bowels, and so lay it warm upon the patients
forehead, or rather on the top of the forehead when the hair is shorn off.

Item, take another whelpe (the intrailes being taken out as is said) bestrew
it inwardly with Henbane seed, and lay it warm upon the head, this makes the
frantic to sleep: the same do also young Doves and Cocks opened in the back,
and laid upon the head: or take the warm lights of a Weather, hold it upon the
forehead, when it is waxen cold make it warm again in warm water, but wring
it well out, and lay it again upon the forehead, and reiterate the same
oftentimes.

Of the dwelling of a frantic man, and other remedies concerning this disease.
THe dwelling of any frantic persons must be temperate, more cold then warm:
Bestrew his Chamber and bed with cold herbs, as Lettice, Purslaine,
Housleeke, small and great Willow leaves, water Lillies, and Nightshade: have
also clothes made wet in common water, round about him pluck away all pictures
out of his eyes, for that they bring fantasies and troubles unto him, let
honest people come amongst them, to the end he may be ashamed; let him smell to
Roses, Violets, water Lillies, flowers, and Camfere, whereof may also bags be
made, this is prescribed for an example, how all manner of frantic men are to
be governed, now will we proceed forward.

But if it be feared, that a man would become frantic, then take quick
Brimstone, and Masticke of each one drag. and a half, temper them well beaten
with half an ounce of good Treacle, and give a youth thereof half a drag. at
once mixed with Cicorie water, an old body one drag. with old wine. He is to
sweat thereupon as long as he is able to endure it: does it not help at one
time? then do it mo times, but the patient is to beware of cold and wind.

Take Cammomill, the herb Dill, Roses, Marioram gentle, of each one M. sees
them and make clothes wet with it, and lay them warm oftentimes upon the
patients forehead.

Take Violet leaves, Melilot, Mallows, Rosemarie, Bay leaves, and Poppie
heads, of each two handfuls, let them sees together and use it as before: the
conserve of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, and especially of Pyonie flowers, is very
convenient for this above all other, and not only for this disease, but also
against all strange fantasies, frightings and fear, the which people have a
nights and without any cause.

A precious water.
THis is much commended above all things for to keep men in their good
understanding, and to restore the same if it were lost: take May Lillies stripped
off from their stalks, power Muscadell, Malmsey, or any other old wine upon
them, put this in a glass and stop it fast, and let it so stand certain
days: afterward distill it through soft seething in a kettle of water. This
is not only good against the frenzy, but also in the dead palsy, where the
speech is lost, against all faintnes, against all consumption: it repugneth
also all venime, and strengthens the heart; a spoonefull taken thereof at
once.

These frantic persons are to be always kept sober in eating and drinking,
as is expressed, and to use cooling things, for necessity requires the same:
They must eschew wine, and be content with small beer and Barley water,
wherein the sirupe of Violets, of Roses, or of water Lillies be mixed. He is to
eat Orgemond or Ptisane (called Ptisana) or any other water paps. Also all
other cold herbs stewed, as Lettice, Spinach, and Sorrel, yea some require
this order to be kept so directly, that they will not allow any other thing in
the world. But regard is always to be had to the ability of the patient: and
heed must also above all things be taken, that this patient be not made
angry, nor feared, and not frighted; but as much as is possible to be kept
with mirth.

For to bring the sick to sleep and rest.. 6.
FOr that this malady does bring with it much unnatural watching, therefore
it is needful to write somewhat thereof, for that is very hurtful in the
disease, because it does dry the whole body, takes away ye appetite, troubles
the mind, contracteth the sinews, weakeneth the wits: also causes some Ague,
and brings with it other inconveniences more; as also the loss of sleep,
which is a very bad sign in all hot diseases.

The causes why one cannot sleep are many, as anger, sorrow, pain, heavy
thoughts, a full and crude stomach, hard meats; as Toad estoooles, Beans,
Oinions, and Mustard seed, the which do all bring terrible dreams: Also when
there is an impostume in the brains, great disquiet, barking dogs, and such
like more which may hinder the sleep: these are the common causes which do
keep one awake. But how the same is to be redressed, and how that the reviving
sleep is to be restored, shall be showed hereafter.

But now to prosecute our method, there be in the frenzy (called Phrenitis)
which is with strong Agues, these things following prescribed.

If it happen that this patient can attain to no sleep, like as it commonly
chances in such diseases, whereby the sickness is aggrauated; then may the
sleep be provoked well with inward and outward things: whereto these safe
remedies are very meet.

Take woman's milk, of one that gives suck to a daughter, four ounces and a
half, the brayed whites of four eggs, and white powned Poppy seed as much
as is needful to make them to a salve; spread thereof upon the forehead and
the temples. Take the sirupe of Poppy heads, the water of white water Lillies,
and oil of Violets, each alone or mixed together, and use them (as has been
said.) Take Henbane seeds, and sees them so long in wine until it be
thickish, anoint the temples of the head, the nose, and ears therewith: this
is very strong, but use it not but only in great need. Item, take Poppy seed,
and Henbane seed, of each a like much, beat them small, and temper them with
the white of an eg, woman's milk, and with a little Vinegar; use them as
before. When one is come out of his natural sleep, or enfeebled in his wits,
then make a sponge wet in this water following, and lay it warm on his
forehead and on the temples of his head: being waxen cold it is to be renewed.

Take Lettice, Violet leaves, pilled Barley, Poppy heads, the roots of
Mandragora, the white water Lillies of each a handful, Henbane seed, Poppy
seed, Lettice seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cammomill, Melilot, and
Mallows, of each half a handful: let this sees together in water.

Take Cassia wood one dragme, Opium two dragmes, and Saffron one dragme, make a
powder thereof, and at the most take one scrupe thereof, let it steep in
Vinegar and Rose water; anoint the temples with it, it is very strong and
safe. In like manner will be for this (amongst the common things) Oxyrrhodinum
used: whereof some stand described in the first Chapter and second.

A Salve.
TAke one ounce of Poplar salve, oil of Violets half an ounce, Henbane
seeds, the roots of Mandragora, of each half a drag. Saffron, Cassia wood,
of each one scrup. temper this together: the sleep was wont also to be
procured with this following, binding it about the neck, and to lay it upon
men's priuities, and women's breasts.

Take cold water and Rosewater, of each five ounces, vinegar one ounce and a
half, wet a double linen cloth therein, and lay it over it.

Item, take herbs of cold natures, as Willow leaves, water Lillies, Vine
leaves, and Lettice, seethe them in water, and wash the foresaid place, also
the hands and feet therewith. This does also, to set the hands and feet in
cold water.

A potion and such like to procure sleep.
TAke white Poppie seeds half an ounce, roots of Mandragora, Henbane seed,
of each half a dragme, unbeaten Saffron four grains, stamp them all
together, and bind them in a cloth, and then lay them in steep in five ounces
of the water of water Lillies the space of six hours, afterward wring it
out, and give it to the sick person two hours before supper or dinner, from
one ounce unto three ounces, according to the importance of the sickness and
ability of the patient.

Item, take water Lillies twelve ounces, Opium one drag. steep them together
in three pints of Malmsey the space of 24. hours, then cast therein one
quarter of an ounce of Salt, white beaten Poppie seeds half an ounce, Henbane
seeds one quarter of an ounce, Lettice seed three drag. distill the same in
seething water, whereof you are to give going to bed, from half a drag. unto a
drag. This is strong enough for to cause the patient to sleep six hours:
wine does also provoke sleep if one drink somewhat excessiuely; in like sort
also wine of Wormwood, yet that drives away heavy dreams.

A confection and what else may be taken.
TAke conserve of Violets and water Lillies, of each one ounce, white Poppie
seeds, white Henbane seeds, of each half an ounce, Ginger three dragmes:
temper this together, and when you go to bed, then take the bigness of a
Hasell nut rather more than less: the Ginger is put thereto, to the end that
his power might penetrate.

Another. Take white Poppie seeds, Endive seeds, Lettice seeds, and
Purslaine seeds, of each two ounces, Melon seed pilled, Pompion seed, Gourd
seeds, and Cucumber seeds, of each a drag. and a half, Mandragora apples one
ounce and one quarter, Saffron, Cammomill, Dill seed, of each one drag. and a
half, Lignum Aloes, one drag. Sugar twelve ounces, honey of Violets six
ounces: the Sugar and honey you are to sees in the water of water Lillies
until it be thick; when it is almost cold, temper the other beaten small
amongst it, and use it as before from one quarter of an ounce unto half an
ounce. It is good for frantic persons to anoint the forehead, the temples,
the nose and the pulse veins therewith, or to take it with the water of
Lettice one hour after meat.

Another not so strong.
TAke white Poppie seed three quarters of an ounce, the seeds of Violets, of
Lettice, of Endive, of each one quarter of an ounce, pilled Melon seed,
Pompion seeds, Gourd seeds, Cucumber seed, of each half a drag. Sugar one
quarter of an ounce, temper this as thick as you will have it, with the sirupe
of Poppie seeds.

Here may you see that Poppie seeds are used almost in all receipts for the
sleep, likewise all that is made of Poppie is good to procure sleep, as the
confection Diapapauer, Loch de papauere, Syrupus de papauere, and Diacodion.

A powder. Take Lettice seed and white Poppie seed, of each half an ounce,
Endive seed, Henbane seed and Ginger, of each one drag. Sugar four ounces,
make a powder thereof.

But if all these things will not help, then must Opium of necessity be used,
to the end that nature may get some rest. But with what providence this is to
be used, that do all experienced Physicians sufficiently know, without whose
counsel the same is not to be done.

Of the ouerheated children, when they awake out of sleep.
TAke water Lillies or Purslaine, Willow leaves, Vine leaves, and Poppie seed
with the heads, of each one handful, let these seethe together in a pot of
water, when it is then lukewarm set the child his feet therein, and stroke
him well downwards, likewise also from the shoulders to the elbow. This ensuing
is much more safe and expert than any thing else anointed on the temples of
the head.

Item make a cloth wet in his mothers milk, or if the same be not to be had,
in warm Goats milk, lay thereof upon the forehead, and on the temples of the
head, it cools well, and also causes to sleep.

Of Mania, another kind of franticknesse, which we commonly called Madness.. 7.
IT is discovered how that the Mania is a mad Phrenesis, without an ague, and
is described by the learned, and defined after diverse manners, which are meet
to be here rehearsed. Mania (some say) is a distemperature of the
understanding, which alters the right and reasonable thoughts, with loss of
voice, of wit, and of judgment, which were good in health.

Other say thus, This Mania is a dottage or madness, and therefore a disease of
the mind, which no otherwise distempereth the mind, but as any other sickness
of the body, whereby can be no health. In fine, it is such a Melancholia, in
case that it begin to root in one, that they become raging mad, and must be
bound, yea the common sort think no otherwise, but that he is possessed with a
spirit.

The chiefest signs of Mania be these, unsteadfastness, alterations in words
and deeds done without sense or reason, like as much talk and prating, much
waking, leaping, great troubles, and such like.

But if they be caused of a cholerike Melancholia, then is the patient the more
unquiet, and so much the more inclined to chiding, calling, and great madness:
but if it be mixed with burnt blood, then do they only rage, and hold also their
peace otherwhiles, the which comes straight way again afterward with so
wonderful much talk, that they are hardly induced to hold their peace: they
will be lean over all their body, they have heavy dreams, spet out
otherwhiles some gall, which falls seething upon the ground, their pulse is
slow and weak, and their arteries hard.

This is verily a terrible sickness, not only for the patient himself, but
for all them that do assist and keep him: and is cured through the same means
that are prescribed for Phrenitis, and for this Melancholia following.

Of Melancholia, or Dementia, a wonderful madness.. 8.
THis word Melancholia is to be taken after two ways: First, for one of the
four humors of a man's body, the black part of man's blood, whereof we have as
yet not admonished. Secondly, for a certain sickness which annoyeth and
weakeneth the brain and mind, with great trouble and heaviness: and is thus
described. Melancholia is a corruption of the judgment and thoughts, altered
from their natural kind, into an unnatural and spoiled manner, tempered with
fear and care: through which the black blood causes a troubled and changed
spirit; like as it is also true, that it is common with all melancholicke
persons (be it of whatsoever cause it will) to be always fearful and
sorrowful: and if you demand of them the occasion, they know not to declare
or allege any occasion unto you: they be so full of fantasies and marvelous
imaginations. Otherwhiles they be weary of their life; nevertheless they shun
death: they complain not any otherwise but that they be persecuted and
murdered, or that some wild beasts will devour them; yea some be also moved
in their wits; albeit that they fear death much, nevertheless sometimes
destroy themselves. Other also being infected with this disease, they fall into
ridiculous fantasies: (for an example) like as we do read in Galen of one that
had a strong imagination; so that he thought he was an earthen pot, and
therefore shunned the way from all such as met him, fearing that they would
break him.

There was another that so surely minded the fall of the Giant Athlas, which
should carry heaven, that he thought that he also carried heaven, and was so
weary thereof that he could no longer carry so great a burden, and yet would
not cast it down for fear he should bruise him self and all men in the world
to fitters.

Some suppose and imagine that they be Emperors, Kings, Wolves, Devils,
Fowls, and what may be more: some weep, some laugh, others shun the water.
Also it has been seen before times that learned men being plagued with this
disease, afterward did not know one letter. To the contrary, unlearned men did
know wonderful arts, could speak strange languages, who also prophesied: and
others that did those things that seemed to be against nature. Some fear the
things which be not to be feared, nor never can come to pass. But in this they
be like to fearful men, yea all those men who always fear darkness: for
like as such outward darkness brings fear with it; so does Melancholia also
cause a dark black blood, which makes darkness in a bodies mind, and a
fear withal.

This is also a cause wherefore the melancholicke persons are easily possessed
with the falling sickness.

The cause of these melancholicke fantasies do proceed most from the nature of
the meats which engender melancholicke blood; to wit, all Venison, but
especially Hares, Conies, and all old flesh, whether it be of Oxen, Goats,
Bucks, Kine, wild Oxen, and rather if they be salted than fresh.

Also of great sea fishes, Salmons, Sturgeons, etc. The like also of all herbs
which do not moysten, especially of Colewoorts, and all other Pottages, as
Beans, Lintels, Pease, etc. The black thick Wine, old Cheese, unleavened
bread, and such like, do also increase Melancholy.

The melancholicke persons are also to beware of great labor, sorrow, heavy
thoughts, much watching, from great hunger, and great thirst; and eschew also
great cold, dry countries and dwellings.

To the contrary is also good for them, young Mutton, Kids, Lamb, Pullets,
Hens, fresh flesh broth, Eggs, and whatsoever else is easily to be digested, and
makes good blood, as Burrage, Buglosse, etc.

His bread must be white, light and well raised: To bath oftentimes without
tarying long in it, is very meet for them. In like manner the hearing of
music and all mirth, and all well sauouring and odoriferous things carried
about them: this is now a general rule for all those that be assailed with this
Melancholy.

But forasmuch as this grief of the mind, or heaviness, does commonly
proceed out of two parts of man's body, as out of the brains, and the Milt or
Spleen; therefore is good heed to be taken, viz. when these grievous thoughts
and fantasies do assail a body, as fear, sorrow, and also when anger does get
the masterie, then it is a sign that the Melancholy proceeds out of the
Spleen, and that the rather when it appears with swelling, and ache in the
belly, loathsome color, lost appetite, and vomiting: if it then come so far
that the patient do disclose his thoughts in words or deeds, then it is a sign
that the melancholy has fast settled herself, and that it is high time to use
good advise for it: for if this malady do take root, then it is incurable.
Therefore first the Liver vein is to be opened in the hand; and if the blood
be black, then let it bleed as long as the sick person may suffer it: but if
it be fair red, then stanch it presently again. And if with this franticknes
were not the foresaid signs, but that this Melancholy (according to the
frenzy) were caused through long continuance in the sun, or that the patient
be beaten on the head, then is his head vein to be opened, and he is also to
use purging, and meat as is before said; his head is to be irrigated with
warm water from on high, and afterward to be anointed with oil of Roses,
Vinegar, and woman's milk, and let him smell to things which be cool of
nature, as Roses, Violets, Sanders, Camfere, etc. In fine, that which is before
prescribed for frenzy, and in the first part of this book for Cephalaea and
Hemicrania, is also good for this purpose.

And if so be that none of the foresaid signs be present or apparent, then
does the melancholy not aggrieue the head only, but it has also communion with
the heart and liver. For this, the Median must be opened, and the sick person
governed (as is said before) a certain space, otherwhiles holding up and
interceassing, and then to begin again with physic, and continuing this so
long, till he be thoroughly whole.

Now in general to write of this sickness, it is first to be noted, that no
medicine is meet for this which purges by vomit, for because that the matter
is heavy of it self, it does covet to be purged by stools, therefore it is
good that he use some preparatiue potions, according to the advice of a learned
Physician, and according as the patient is able. Some also commend for this a
potion of Epithymus, thus prepared.

A potion of Epithymus.
THis decoction or potion do we here describe to be made after three manners,
the which also is a sure sign that the same as well by the ancient
Physicians, as of later time, is of estimation and price.

The first makes Rasis thus: take Mirobalans Indi one ounce and a quarter, the
roots of Polypodie five drag. Seen leaves nine drag. Turbith half an ounce,
Epithymus 10. drag. sees them all together (except the Epithymus) in 36.
ounces of water; then at last cast in the Epithymum, afterward take it from
the fire and let it cool: strain it, and reserve it.

The second manner. Take Epithymum, Stechas, Mirobaloni Indi, of each one
ounce, Mirobalani Chebuli, Emblici, Bellirici, Turbith, the herb Pyony and
Agaricus, of each two dragm. and a half, Polypody roots, and Seen, of each
three drag. Fumitory, Squinant, of each one drag. and a half, rinds of black
Hellebore roots one drag. Salgemme two scrup. Corants three quarters of an
ounce; sees them all together (except the Epithymum) in a pot of water a good
space, then put thereto the Epithymum at the last, and let them sees until
three parts remain: when it is lukewarm, then strain it, and keep it in a
cold place covered.

The third manner. Take Fumitorie, Endive, Cicorie, of each one handful,
roots of Polypody three quarters of an ounce, Cuscuta, Sorrel, Buglosse, of
each one handful, Thymus, Epithymus, of each one ounce and a quarter, Corants
one ounce, Dates and Figs, of each one ounce, Seen leaves 7. drag. Turbith
three drag. Agaricus half an ounce, sees them altogether in a pint and a
half of water of Fumitorie, until the third part be spent; then strain it,
and lay to steep in this warm decoction two drag. and a half of good
Rubarbe, Rinds of Mirobalani Chebuli one drag. and a half, Indi one drag. let
them stand together: wring it oftentimes out, and keep it until you have
need of it.

But before this potion, these pills are first to be used: Take Agaricus two
scrup. Aloe one dra. Indy salt, half a drag. black Hellebore half a scr. make
as many pills as you will with it for to take at twice. Three hours before the
potion also you may in stead of these pills, use the confection, Hamech, or
Diasena. When as now it has thus been continued certain days (according to
the ability of the patient) then let him rest three days, and live soberly
(drinking small white wine, and then purging again as before) and so until
four times one after another, for (as is said before) melancholy is wonderful
hard to be purged. In fine, delay is in no wise meet, and the Physician is to
do his very best for to make the sick person fat, for if that can be effected,
then shall he quickly recover his health.

And if it chance that he could not use this potion, then may he take in stead
thereof the pills which expel black Choler, yet to use always before some
preparatiue medicine, for which you are according to the importance of the
cause, to follow the advice of a learned Physician. This potion following is
very convenient, take Mirobalani Indi one ounce and a half, dried Prunes one
ounce, seethe them together in 8. ounces of water, even to the half:
afterward strain them through a cloth, then dissolve therein two ounces or two
ounces and a half of Manna, and use it in the morning betimes. All the time
that he shall rest, may he use these things, as Laetificans Almansoris,
Laetificans Almansoris.
the which is thus prepared: Take Balm, the pills of Citrons, Cloves, Galliae
Muscatae, Mace, Cinnamome, Nutmegs, Cardamome, red and white Behen, Pionie seed
pilled, Seduarie great and small, Basil seed, of each one drag. and a half,
Muscus nine grains, afterward 20. Mirobalani, Chebuli, and 30. Emblici, power
twelve ounces of water thereon, bray them so long in a mortar, until the fifth
part remain: afterward strain it through a cloth, and mix therewith six
ounces of clear honey: sees it so long, until all the water be consumed:
weigh that which is overplus, and temper always with twelve ounces of this
decoction, one quarter of an ounce of the foresaid spices, or one ounce and a
half in the whole quantity, and then make a confection of it. But if you will
have tabulats or rotuls, take unto twelve ounces of Sugar one ounce, or at the
most nine drag. of the foresaid spices; you shall take of the confection the
quantity of a Hasell nut; it strengthens all the principal parts of man's
body, and helps much the natural warmth and concoction; it withstandeth all
grievous thoughts, and makes also merry, and a good color.

A very precious Confection.
TAke Lignum Aloes, Cloves, Cardamome, Amarantus, which is burnt to powder,
Roses, Burrage, and flowers of Buglosse, of each one quarter of an ounce,
parched Hasell nuts half a dragme, sweet Almonds, and Iuiubes, of each one
ounce, prepared fine Bolus 3. drag. Annis, Fennel, of each two ounces, Saffron
two scrup. Doronicum, Hearts bones, Seduary, Iacinth, Smaragd, and Saphires, of
each one scrup. prepared pearls one quarter of an ounce, Basil seed one
drag. 8. leaves of beaten gold, you are to sees this together in the juice of
Chamaedrios, of field Cypers, and juice of Buglosse, of each three ounces,
until all the juice be consumed. But note, that the precious stones, gold, and
Saffron must not be sodden with it, but be at the last tempered amongst it. Of
this is to be given in the morning early three dragm. in a draught of wine
before dinner and supper, one drag. and a half to eat, and half an ounce of
conserve of Buglosse after it. This is especially fit for the burnt
melancholy, of whatsoever occasion the same does proceed. If you will use it
also in Mania, minister it with the water of Violets, and of water Lillies. Now
for to provoke sleep, you are to give the decoction of Poppy heads, or
lukewarm water of water Lillies one quarter of an ounce, and that two hours
after supper.

Another Confection.
TAke burnt silk, prepared Coral, of each half a scrup. burnt Hearts horn
two scrup. prepared Pearls one drag. Cardamome four scrup. prepared Pingles
two ounces, Hyssop, and Licorice, of each two scrup. Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace,
Indie Spica, Cypers roots, Cucubes and Galingale, of each one drag. and a
half, Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one scrup. white Sugar 24.
ounces, sees this with Buglosse water, until it be as thick as honey, and
then temper the rest with a little Musk amongst it.

A Powder which is much commended.
IT is said that it has been many times found, that they which had this
melancholic passion, have only through this powder recovered health both of
body and mind.

Take Epithymum one ounce and a half, Azure stone, Agaricus, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Diagridion one drag. 20. Cloves, this being beaten
together and tempered, you are twice a week to give thereof, but at the most
one quarter of an ounce at once. Or you may use for this the confection
Diamargarition, and all that is described before for the strengthening of the
head, and shall be described hereafter for the comforting of the heart. To
moisten the dry brains in this Melancholia, take the broth wherein the head
of a Weather, or the feet be decocted: let certain Poppie heads be sod flue
or six waumes, and so lay thereof wet clothes upon the head. Or take the
flowers of Borage, of Buglosse, Thymus, Epithymus, of each a like quantity,
sees this together, and wash the head therewith.

Take the juice of Borage, and of Fumitorie, of each six ounces, foment
therewith the head with a spoonge which is made wet therein: if you cannot get
this juice, then take the water of the same herbs.

Neesing is also very fit for this use: and that is to be provoked like as is
taught in the second Chapter and 2.. The learned do advise, that in this
disease, after the purging, the head before and behind above the neck is to be
cauterized even to the very bone, and to hold the holes open the space of 14.
days. In fine, to rehearse the whole manner of curing this Melancholy, it
consists only therein, that the black Melancholic blood is first and last
to be purged, through all means possible. Also good heed is to be taken unto
the Liver, and the physic to be ordained thereafter.

Of the Palsy in general.. 9.
THis is indeed a swift, grievous and terrible disease, which (like as is said
before) has his offspring from the brain. It is of diverse natures, each one
worse then the other, which we will comprehend in five kinds: the first is
Lethargus, which is the sleeping sickness: the second is Stupor or Tremor,
which is astonishing and quaking, which some call the small palsy: the third
is Paralysis, that is, the right or dead Palsy: the fourth is Epilepsia, which
is the falling sickness, and all kinds of such like paroxismes, sometimes in
old men, and otherwhiles in young children: the fifth is Apoplexia, that is the
most grieuousest, which not without reason, we do call the power or hand of God.

Because that these said sicknesses do resemble each other in many things,
therefore we will before all briefly discover what difference there is between
them, and wherein they do accord together. First therefore Apoplexia and
Epilepsia, have this difference, that the last mentioned is placed before in
the head, the man fallen neither calls nor cries out, the sinews stir,
and are contracted toward the brain, he has the breath almost wholly free,
and comes quickly to himself again. To the contrary, the Apoplecticus, or
he that is stricken with the dead Palsy, the sickness is over his whole head,
cries in falling, the sinews will be slack, they have a grievous or no
breath, and come slowly to themselves: but they resemble each other so like,
that they be both caused of flegmaticke humors in the brain.

The Palsy or Apoplexia, is also differing from the numbednesse and sleeping
sickness, which is Lethargus, Subeth, and Congelatio: but in Congelatione, there
is no restraint of the breath, as there is in the Palsy: secondly, it forcibly
assaileth the sick persons; they thrust, cry out, and such like, which is
nothing so cum Apoplecticis.

Thirdly, that the sleeping disease comes slowly, and the dead Palsy very
suddenly. But herein they accord, that all they be altogether deprived of their
understanding. Subet or Stuper, does therein disagree with Lethargus and
Congelatio, that at the last there assaileth in Lethargus an Ague, and an
Impostume in the hinder part of the head: where contrariwise Subet or Stuper
comes without an Ague, and always without any soreness, and in the forepart
of ye head.

Of the sleeping disease Lethargus, Veternus, Torpor.. 10.
THe nature of this disease is clean contrary to the foresaid frenzy: for
that like as they be plagued with an immoderate watching; so are they in this
sickness vexed with an insatiable sleeping. It begins first with an
alteration in the color in the skin over the whole body, and with a feeble
pulse, sometimes with a small, and otherwhiles with a great and hurtful ague.
It is also caused out of a cold moisture of the head and brains, whereby not
only the understanding is enfeebled, but is for the most part always so
spoiled, that they utterly forget all that they do speak, hear and see. The
which also the greek name Lethargus does signify; for this cold slime does
through his toughness obstruct the hindmost tunicles of the brains, where the
memory has her seat. Amongst many causes this is one of the commonnest,
namely, all that augmenteth melancholy, that causes this sleepie sickness:
but which they be, look in other places, viz. where the melancholy is
described, which the first Register discovers especially. This malady is
caused of all meat and drink which ascends toward the head, as Onions,
Garlic, Penniroyall, Mustard (howsoever they be dressed) and such like more:
Also if he ouercharge himself, lives in filthiness, sleeps much, and
especially lies on the back, whereby that the heavy flegmatike vapors do
ascend into the hindermost parts of the head, which do cause there otherwhiles
an impostumation or deprauation of the understanding, and sometimes much gaping
or yawning.

Here is also to be noted, that there be four kinds of diseases contained and
comprehended amongst these sleeping sicknesses.

First, Lethargus it self; Congelatio, which is the numnesse; Stupor, that is,
senslesnesse; Subet, which is called of the Arabians, a very deep sleep. And
although it appear that all these be one kind of sort, nevertheless they have
notable differences.

The numnesse and sleeping sickness do therein accord, viz. that they do both
infect the hinder part of the brain, do take away understanding, and all
sensiblenesse, and prefer forgetfulness.

But they disagree herein, that in Lethargo the eyes be shut; and in the
numnesse they remain open, like as is sufficiently showed before in the 9..
But to the end we might speak somewhat of their signs, these are the
commonest; small continual agues with a deep sleep, and the patient lies
always with closed eyes; if one call him, he opens the eyes, and shuts
them close again by and by; the pulse is strong, but slow and sweatie, with
forgetfulness of all that is past and done, and of present things, yea in such
manner, if they ask for meat and drink, they forget to shut their mouth to:
they draw their breath slowly, and with great trouble; the going to privy or
stool is always thin, the urine thick and troubled, as of a four footed
beast. If all these signs (or any of them) be marked, then it is easily to be
adjudged, that it is none other but the sleeping disease. But if there befall
something else with it (whereof it were too long to write) then do these
foresaid signs alter and change.

Now for the first mean all diligence is to be done, to let and stay that
these sick persons fall not in any deep sleep, through the strong binding of
the outward members, like as is taught in the ninth Chapter and second. and in
other places of the Hissing of the ears, frothing and rubbing the same hard:
also the plucking by the nose or beard, and women by the hair of their
priuities, loud crying, and making great noise, yea if it were needful, by
fearing them, to the end they may be sorrowful.

Some Physicians begin first the cure with letting blood and opening of the
head vein: and if there be no other occasions which may let and hinder it, few
days after the vein on the forehead above the nose. They also do further ye
bleeding at the nose, by thrusting in of swines bristles and such other.
Afterward they use strong Clisters, and two or three days afterward neesing
powder, for to expel sleep therewith: and if all these will not help, then
is one to look if he can bring the patient to parbraking and vomiting, whether
it be through thrusting in of his fingers, feathers, plumes, or wax candles
into the throat, or through the juice of Radishes tempered with Oxymel, or
taking a Radish, sticking here and there into it pieces of black Hellebore
laid al night in a celler, taking out the roots in the morning, and boiling
the Radish in water, and straining it through a cloth: tempering therein one
dragme of Saffron and four ounces of vinegar, whereof two spoonefuls are to be
given him immediately after meat.

The order of diet.
Because that this malady is short, and inclines speedily to life or to
death; therefore is no great heed to be taken for meat and drink in this
sickness: but thin Meade must be his only drink, for it digesteth and
expels. Also he is to occupy the broth of Fitches and Barley decocted with
Hen broth: it is a commodious meat for him; but of all fruits, and meats of
cold nature, he must beware.

But as much as concerns the foresaid Clisters, we shall speak thereof when
we discourse of the Apoplexia: for thereby be the brains discharged from all
that hurtful matter. You must also in stead of the same, use these
suppositories: Take stone salt, and beaten Beuercod, of each one dragme,
clarified Honey two ounces: make meetely thick and long suppositories of it.

For to purge, this ensuing is very requisite: Take Hiera Picra half an ounce,
Honey water three ounces; it is thin and bitter: or break the Pills Cochiae one
dragme, sirupe of Roses one ounce, in three or four ounces of honey water: also
he must drink sometimes of this honey water following: Take four parts of
water, and one part of honey, sees it so long as it will cast up any scum. The
above mentioned Oxyrrhodinum three days together laid upon the head is also
much commended. Or make this water, Stechas, Rue, Marioram gentle, Marioram,
Bay leaves, Hyssop, and Nep, of each half a handful: sees them all together
in sufficient water unto the half: dip a spoonge therein, and apply it warm
to the head. This foresaid water may from on high be irrigated upon the head,
and the herbs being wrung out to be laid in a little bag on the top of the
head.

Item, take Pigeon dung, temper it with Honey, and so lay it upon the head; you
must rub well the neck with Lilly roots or with Squils. For this are also
good all these oils ensuing used each by it self or mixed together, as the
oil of Beuercod, of Spike, of Piretrum, of Mustard seed, and oil of Bays,
the juice of Rue, or the herb decocted in Wine, and laid in the neck, is very
highly commended.

Because then the causes require (like as is said) that the head be purged
through neesing, take the things whereof we have at sundry times spoken, like
as the first Register shall show thee: if it be needful to purge yet more, you
have further instructions for it in the foresaid places, where we have
discoursed of the Palsy.

Lastly, the patients hair is to be shorn off, and afterward he must have
the head anointed with a salve of Mustard seed, Beuercod, and Vinegar
tempered together, for it is strong and hot for to consume all melancholicke
humors in the hinder part of the head. There may also those things be used for
it which are ordained for the Palsy, which be worthy of observation.

Of Numnesse and Astonishing, which is Stupor, Congelatio, whereon depends
Tremor, which we call trembling.. 11.
THe second kind of this sleeping disease have we ascribed to Stupor and
Tremor, that is, the numnesse and trembling which commonly follow each other.

What the first is for a disease, that is discovered in the beginning of this
our book, viz. a strong cold, which comprehends the hinder part of the head
(like to Lethargus) and makes immovable and senseless the party affected,
and therefore is likened therein to the Paralysi, for that also (as is said) it
is called a small Paralysis or Palsy. In this sickness the patient lies none
otherwise then as if he slept, but has the eyes open, and stirs neither the
eye lids, nor any other member of the body. If they do get this numnesse, as
they stand, they remain standing, or as stiff as a stick: if they get it
writing, so do they continue sitting, as if they wrote: or if they get it with
looking into the Sky, so they also remain seeing without any alteration;
whereby then the common people do get an unbelief, saying, that they be taken
away, and that they speak with God or with an Angel: amongst which
otherwhiles Satan does mingle his wiliness, whereby some do take and hold
them for Saints, like as they sometimes show forth, that they have seen
maruels in Purgatory and in heaven. In fine, these be likened to Idols, that
do not see with open eyes, do not smell, nor hear, do not speak with open
throat, neither go on their legs, like as the Psalm says. This numnesse or
stiffness does also most commonly take one in their sleep, that is, if any one
have a leg or a foot stiff, like as the learned and we also call it steeping,
and has lost for the space of a certain time his feeling, and motion, the
which happens if that one member lie too hard upon the other, whereby the
vital spirits are kept back: but with what infirmities of the brain this
numnesse agrees, is sufficiently before rehearsed and showed.

This disease is to be helped as the sleeping sickness Subet is cured, as you
find written in the first Chapter. 6. and afterward of Cephalaea: but for this
is especially commanded not to tarry long from taking of good advise, for that
if one let this numnesse grow old, then follows after it a perfect palsy.

Therefore, if any body have their feet or other member benumned, or will
wax stiff, then are the remedies to be used for it, which are good for the
palsy, and those that shall be hereafter described, and a good diet to be
observed in eating and drinking. Also all such meats to be chosen which be
warm and dry by nature, as Pullets with their brothes, and all other Fowls
which make their abode in the hilly country. If this patient may also be
brought to sweating, it would be very good. The neck and all other stifned
members are every where to be anointed with Dialthaea, or Martiaton: for this
is also good oil of Costus, with a little Benercod tempered amongst it, which
is special good for trembling. But if the malady wax old, then purge with
the pills Cochijs, and use otherwhiles the confection Anacardina, which is also
much commended for the same: or take the oil of Elderne flowers one ounce and
a half, temper it amongst one quarter of an ounce of Euphorbium, and anoint
the head therewith.

In like manner the head may also be anointed with the oil of Elderne leaves,
Beuerrod, and of Euphorbium, or use this water following, which is more milder.

Take Burrage, Buglosse, Fumitorie, Stechas, Tymus, Tymiama, of each half a
handful: seethe them all together in sufficient water, and let the head be
therewith irrigated warm, or made moist with a spoonge. The neesing is also
very requisite, and this is to be done in the numnesse or stiffness with black
Hellebore, by reason that the same vehemently riddeth away al melancholy,
whereof two kinds are here described. Clisters are also very commodious for this
kind of numnes, take Mercury, Balm, Seen leaves, roots of Polypody, Burrage,
Buglosse, Annis seeds, and Fennel seeds, of each half a M. Also take Bran,
sees all these together in sufficient water, and take thereof 12. or 16.
ounces. Temper amongst it Hiera Ruffi, Logodionis, of each half an ounce, oil
of Rue four ounces, salt half a drag. then make a Clister thereof.

The second. Take Burrage, Buglosse, both the roots and herbs, Fumitory,
Mercury, of each one M. Cuscuta, Fennel, Tymus, Tymiama, Stechas, and
Amaranthus, of each half a M. also a little Bran: sees this altogether, and
take of this decoction as much as before: afterward put more thereto, oil of
Lillies, and Honey, of each one ounce and a half, Salgemma, one drag. Hiera
logodion, or Ruffi, three quarters of an ounce more or less according as the
patients ability requires.

Of the shaking Palsy.. 12.
COncerning the shaking Palsy, the which is a kind of this forementioned
disease, it is therefore added to the numnesse, for that they both proceed
from one kind of cause.

There be diverse spices of this, which are here especially reckoned amongst
the contagions of the brains, although they be caused through some offense or
perishing of the sinews, and are thus described: The shaking is a continual
strife of the natural powers, which willingly and after a natural manner are
raised without ceasing, and is overcome by sickness. Also, this shaking is a
weakening or diminishing of motion.

This happens of many causes, as if one look from great height into the depth,
or like as any body should speak to a severe Prince, a Tyrant, or any other
great Sir, or Ruler; or if one see any devouring beast before his eyes. Also
this shaking or trembling comes of great anger, great joy, hard binding,
through great cold and darkness, like as daily experience shows. Item
through great heat, unbridled incontinencie, much bleeding, and also when
there is little blood and spirit extant, as one sees by them which be
recovered of a long sickness. But because that it plainly appears by the
foresaid reasons, that this disease is caused by diverse means and accidents,
therefore there be generally diverse remedies appropriate unto it, wherefore if it
proceed of perishing of the sinews, and cold causes (like as it most comes
to pass) then is to be used for it all that is ordained for the Crampe and
Palsy. Generally of all other herbs there is praised for this, Three leaued
grass, Comin, and Stechas, whether it be in Clisters or otherwise: of oils,
the oil of wild Cucumbers, of Dill, of Cleauers, Articocae, which herb is
marvelous forcible against the shaking or trembling.

For his meat, are very meet for it the brains of Hares, young Stares, and
young Beuers, and also for all other diseases of the sinews. These Clisters
following are also to be used, take Centorie, wild and garden Sage, Rue and
Cowslips, S. John's woort, and Mercury, of each half a M. also peeled wild
Saffron seed one drag. Rue seed, Basil seed, silver mountain seed, of each
half an ounce, Agaricus five drag. Stechas and Amaranthus, of each half an
ounce: let them sees together in sufficient water, take 12. or 16. ounces of
this decoction, Honey, and oil of Lillies, of each one ounce and a half, Sal
gemma, Pil. Cochiae, of each half a drag. temper them well for a Clister, this
is also good for the palsy and stiffness: but if the trembling come of excess
drinking of wine, then is the same to be forborne, or at least tempered with
Sage water, or common water wherein Sage is decocted: Meade is much more meet
for this then wine, or common water tempered with the juice of Pomegranates, or
Veriuice. There is also to be demanded, what the cause is, that the head
always shakes most of all, and next after the hands: like as by experience is
seen. The answer: For that the brain is a very flegmaticke part, the which
imparteth her moisture to the other members. And for that the hands are next of
all to the head with their sinews, and far from the natural warmth: they are
also most annoyed with outward causes, for that they be seldom covered. Now
that one may chiefly help this shaking of the head, (out of which might
proceed much damage) first is the patient to eschew all moist and cold meat,
as fish, and especially sodden Crabbes and Eeles. He is also to refrain from
Spinach, Beetes, Purslaine, Cucumbers, and such like herbs, and all that is
made of dowe, except leauened bread. Item, from all sorts of pottages, except
red and white pease, and Rise. All fruit is also hurtful unto him, except
Oranges and Limons which be preserved. Milk, and all that is made of milk is
he to shun like poison; and if he love his health, he must drink no wine. But
his meat is to be wheaten bread with the bran: Also Veale, Kids flesh, and
lean powdered flesh, Fennel, Mints, Rosemarie, Sage, wild Time, yellow Rapes,
Parsneps, Capers, and such like, are also very commodious. For his drink is
this to be prepared; take six quartes of fresh Well water, and one ounce of
dried Rosemarie flowers; let it seethe until two quartes be wasted: afterward
temper thereto four and twenty ounces of Honey, let it then sees again, and
scum it well, until there be about a quart consumed: Afterward strain it
through a tight cloth, and let him drink thereof in stead of wine: but if he
cannot well drink it, then temper a little red clear wine amongst it. But if
so be that he must and will drink wine, then take Rosemarie wine; for it
strengthens the members, and also the sinews, whether it be drunken, or the
members rubd with it. The same does also the wine of Clarie, Sage, and
Wormwood, but above all others Rosemarie wine.

But if so be that the person be young and full of blood, then after the use of
the foresaid Clisters open the Liver vein in the elbowe, or upon the hand, and
let out of it four or five ounces of blood, and the next day afterward let
him take these pills following: as Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, of each half a drag.
with the juice of Roses, whereof are seven pills to be made, and he must fast
after them five hours. Also to drink afterward a good draught of warm wine,
and an hour after he is to break his fast. After purging he is to drink
every morning this potion following the space of a month, and to fast four
hours after it. Take water of Artichokes, of Betonie, and Rosemarie of each
one ounce, sirupe of Stechas and Oxymel, of each three quarters of an ounce:
and once in twelve days he is to use these pills following: as Pill.
foetidarum, two scrup. Cochiarum one scrup. whereof you are to make with the
sirupe of Roses seven pills, every evening when he goes to bed he is to eat
one quarter of an ounce of Calmus, and thereupon to drink a draught of
Artichoke water. He is also from the neck downwards to the rumpe along the
back bone, to be rubbed with warm clothes, and thereupon anoint it with the
oil of Artichokes. He is also to drink half a drag. of the powder of a Hares
head burned, and that one hour before meat, with Meade, or water of
Artichokes. Now after that the patient is well purged, then may he every day
two or three hours before meat, set boxing cups vnpickt behind in the neck.

A Powder.
TAke field Cypers, Cowslips, Lignum Aloes, Ireos, Hermodactils, Stechas,
Marioram, Mints, of each half a dragme, Indy Spica, Grains and Rue, of each
one scruple: this beaten each by himself, and then tempered, bestrew all the
head therewith when it is shorn.

The Confection of Diamargariton.
THis Confection following is very meet for all manner of shaking: it does
maruellously strengthen the heart in all venomous accidents, and is amiable to
the stomach.

Take Cinnamom, Lignum Aloes, Cloves, Indy Spica, Galingall, Licorice,
Trociscos de Violis sine Scammonio, Specierum, Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each five
drag. Nutmegs, Aliptae muscatae, Seduarie, Spiknard, Mace, Rubarbe, and red
Storax, of each half an ounce, prepared Pearls, burnt Iuorie, Hearts bones,
Ginger, Blatia Byzantia, of each two dragmes and a half, Muscus, Ambra,
Cardamom, Louage seed, Basil seed, of each one dragme and a half, Camfere
one dragme and three ounces of clarified Honey: temper these all together, and
you shall give thereof early in the morning, and as often as is needful in
the day time; to wit, one quarter of an ounce at once.

If you will then have Tabulats thereof, then take twelve ounces of Sugar, and
one ounce of the foresaid ingredience: sees Sugar with Lauander water; or if
you desire it more cooler, then take Buglosse water, there is also at many
Apothecaries Diamargariton frigidum, which is yet more cooling, because that
the former is of a warm nature.

Against the trembling or shaking are all Aquae Comp. good, which are described
in the eighth part, taking thereof, or the trembling member washed or rubbed
therewith.

Item take Garlike, beat it with wine, and rub the shaking members with it: In
like manner also, with the juice of wild Cucumbers, tempered with oil of three
leafed grass, or used by it self. Take a sponge which grows on the Juniper
tree in May, before the rising of the sun: put it into a glass, set it in the
sun, and then will it change to water; wherewith wash the shaking and
trembling hands, and let them dry of themselves. There is much taught in the
second part, of the palpitation of the heart, which is also meet for this
shaking.

For the Resolution of the sinews or dead Palsy.. 13.
OF the third kind of Palsy we have told heretofore in the beginning of the
8.. of the Resolution in the sinews, what manner of sickness it is that does
suddenly take away the free motion and action of a part in man's body
particularly, or wholly, and makes it dead and insensible. We do call the same
a resolution of the sinews, or a dead Palsy, and them that be troubled with
it, Paralyticos.

This is now called by the learned, the great or dead Palsy or Resolution, for
a difference of the foresaid trembling and shaking. In this are two kinds of
natures hidden; whereof the one is Epilepsia, when it takes the left or right
side, and not all the whole body, and is called in Latin Resolutio, or
Dissolutio neruorum, that is, a resolution or unbinding of the sinews, that
the members have no strength or might in them, whereof we will here speak more
at large, for this Palsy concerns not the head at all: for if so be that the
head be therewith infected, then is it a right Apoplexy.

The Palsy or Resolution, whereof we at this present do speak, has many
causes: first, it is properly caused of cold moist meats, as fish, Swines
flesh, Milk, and all that is dressed therewith: all fruits, except Almonds,
Hasel nuts, and Pistaces: also all cold herbs, as Beets, Spinach, etc. In
fine, all that is moist and cold is hurtful for this sickness. But if one
will eat fish, Porke, and red Pease, then are they to be prepared with
Rosemarie, wild Time, Mints, Sage, and such like. The surfeiting with meat and
drink, is in this sickness very prejudicial, like as also much sleeping, and
chiefly for all them that be of a cold nature, and be old, or dwell in a cold
or moist country.

This disease may also proceed of beating, or racking of the sinews, of
anger, of fear, great cold, hard binding of any of the members, and such like
more. For this, all drying and warming meats are good; as well salted and
leauened bread, Partridges, Fesants, Turtle doves, and all small fowls: also
Mutton and Veale dressed with the foresaid herbs. Some commend much Kids flesh
salted, the which should strengthen much the sinews. For this is also meet
all kind of drying and warming Conserues, whether they be of roots, herbs,
flowers, or spices: but wine is to be refrained as much as is possible. But in
case that the patient, by reason of his age, cannot forbear wine, then choose
old red wine, which he is to drink tempered with a little Rosemarie water: and
if that like him not, then he may drink Rosemarie water alone, whether it be
decocted or distilled. If the red wine be against him or not to be gotten, then
take thin white wine, and temper it with water wherein Cardamome is decocted.

Now all they that will be defended from this Palsy, they are to use much
confected Coriander, fasting and before meals; as also to use white prepared
Mustard seed therewith.

For this is also very good the blood of Turtle doves drunken. This sickness
commonly appears with a new and full Moon, against which you are to prepare
these things following.

Take good Treacle three quarters of an ounce, Beuercod one quarter of an
ounce, and temper it with Lauander water, and take it in the morning fasting.

But if so be there appear any beginning of this sickness, then do many
advise (and that rightly) that then the thumb and great toe are to be hard
rubbed, chafed and stretched out; and likewise to rub with warm clothes the
neck and the back bone downwards, that the blood may be drawn from the head
and from the heart. Also there must be a little Treacle thrust behind in his
throat.

Beuercod holden in the mouth and under the tongue is also very good. Some do
also give Beuercod and Pepper to drink, of each one drag.

For this is also much commended Asa foetida, whether it be taken inwardly,
used on the outside, or in gargarismes: and if you would take the same, then is
one drag. and a half enough, with Pepper and Rue, of each half a drag.
tempered with wine. This is good for all diseases of the sinews.

The distilled water of black Cherries is also much praised for this sickness
at the first, and especially if one put thereto as much Lauander water, and so
take thereof three or four ounces at one time.

The common order of this sickness is, that all remedies for this disease are
applied to the hinder part of the head, and in the beginning before the fourth
and seventh, or also before the fourteenth day to use no strong medicines, but
only preparatiues. And if so be that the sick person will yield unto it, then
it were not amiss that he drunk no other thing the first four or five days,
and did eat almost naught else but only honey water, yea also (if it be
possible) to suffer hunger and thirst with it. The fourth day he is to have
given him one drag. or a drag. and a half of Treacle or Mithridate, with
waters meet for this disease.

It is also found by experience, that all they that be burdened with this
disease, shall get great ease, if they accustom to drink every morning three
ounces of Rosemarie or Lauander water, with three drag. of the powder of
Pieretrum tempered amongst it.

Item take the water of the blossoms of the Tillet tree, of May Lillies, and
of black Cherries, of each one ounce, give it him so to drink. In like manner
also stilled woman's milk is highly commended for it, and all kinds of Aquae
Compos.

Take ^^ced Licorice, and Annis seeds, of each one ounce, Elecampane half an
ounce, Pyonie roots one drag. Nutmegs one ounce, Spirit of wine sixteen
ounces, Honey eight ounces: temper these all together and conserve them well. In
winter put thereto one quarter of an ounce of long Pepper, use thereof every
morning a spoonefull or twain. This is marvelous much commended for a
special remedy.

Another.
TAke Lauander water six ounces, water of the May Lillies three ounces, Elixer
vitae, and the water of wild Poppey, of each two ounces, oil of Beuercod one
ounce and a half; temper it in a glass, and then set it in the Sun the space
of eight days, whereof in time of need take a spoonefull, and anoint
therewith the temples of the head. M. Tristrams water is also very fit for this
purpose.

Of Purging.
FOrasmuch as purging is very needful in this sickness, therefore for example
will we describe here a purgation. But it is above all advised, yt the sick
body drink every morning four or five days together five ounces of Rosemary
water, and fast four hours upon it. Afterward he is to take half an ounce
of Hiera logodion, tempered in two ounces of Agrimonie water, in the morning,
and to fast five hours after it; or to use these pills following: take Agaricus
a scrup. Asa foetida half a scrup. Ginger twelve grains, Diagridion one
grain: make pills thereof with the juice of Hyssope. When the patient is
purged, then he is to use this potion following, for the space of eight days
together: Take the water of Agrimonie, and of Sothernwood, of each two ounces,
put some Sugar amongst it.

Other do rather advise this following: Take Calmus half an ounce, Cowslips
three M. Saint John's woort, field and garden Sage, Betonie, Balm, Rue, Bay
leaves, of each one M. Silver mountain, Balsame wood, Balsame fruit, and
Basil seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Licorice, Corants, Lauander
flowers, Amaranthus, of each one ounce, clarified Honey six ounces, rayn water
which is clarified with the white of an egg, twelve ounces; let all these
sees together unto a sirupe.

Another.
TAke Calmus six ounces, Sage three M. Stechas three ounces, clarified honey
six ounces, white Sugar nine ounces; sees them together in eighteen ounces
of rain water unto a sirupe, whereof you may take one ounce and a half, or two
ounces at once, tempered with Sage water.

Also you may use the sirupe of Stechas, for all they be very commodious for
this disease. Afterward take the former purgation again, or the pills of
Euphorbium, de Serapino, and de Opopanaco. And if the patient by drinking of
these potions do remain bound in body, then is he every evening before supper
to swallow one of these pills following.

Take of the pills of Alephanginae one drag. Trocisci Alhandali, Agaricus, of
each half a scrup. Indie salt five grains, whereof make sixteen pills.

Clisters.
TAke Sage, Rue, Stechas, Centorie, Mallows, Mercury, and Bran, of each half
a handful: let them sees all together, and take twelve ounces of this
decoction; temper amongst it Hiera logodion half an ounce, Salt one quarter of
an ounce, Sallad oil three ounces, minister it warm. But for them that have
newly gotten this dead Palsy, there is to be sodden in these Clisters, half
an ounce of roots of Brionie, or of Pyonie, for both these are good for the
disease.

Powder for sauce to meat.
THis powder is he to strew upon the meat in stead of spice: Take picked
Cinnamom one ounce an a half, prepared Coriander, Cloves, Galingall, Pepper,
Cucubes, Mace, Nutmegs, of each one ounce, Calmus two ounces, Coutchenell half
an ounce, Sugar six ounces: this is to be tempered together.

Another.
TAke Pepper two drag. and a half, Cloves, Cardamome, long Pepper, Seduarie,
of each one dragm. Indy Spica, Mace, Saffron, of each one scrup. Sugar as much
as you please: temper them well together.

Item, about the third day is the patient before the rising of the Sun, to take
one dragm. of Treacle tempered with the water of wild Sage. This medicine is
most highly commended of diverse Physicians.

Of Bathing.
IN this sickness is also bathing much commended; whereof there be two kinds
naturally, as sea water; or that is sulferish by nature: Others which be
prepared with herbs and such like.

For the herb bath: Take the same herbs, roots, and seeds, which be named
in the last sirupes, and one is only to receive the vapor, and sweat withal:
or make this ensuing.

Take Bay berries, Juniper berries, and Pepper, of each as much as you please,
stamp it to gross powder, and set the patient in a dry bath: power of this
powder on hot irons, tempred with Lauander water, to the end he may sweat well
with the vapor thereof, then rub all his members infected with Venice Soap,
until the Soap be dry again: Also his body is not to be made wet at any
time with any thing, but only as he steppeth out of the bath with Lauander
water, which is to be powered on a glowing Iron, and so moisten him with this
vapor. And after bathing, tarying in a warm place, the lame joints are to be
rubbed hard with the grease of Storkes, until they be dry; and afterward
with the sewet of a Wether; and lastly with Buckes sewet. This being continued
so the space of four days, the great vein on the foot is to be opened, and
boxing cups set upon the arms: then will he be helped.

An especial Bath.
TAke a Fox, uncase him, and (the bowels being taken out) sees him in a
sufficient quantity of water, and bath the sick person with it: but yet not
before that the body be purged, it is not otherwise permitted.

Fomentations in stead of Bathes.
TAke Sage six M. Juniper berries four M. the strong wine lees seven quarts;
let them sees together by a small fire: afterward put it all together in a
necessary kettle or pot, to the end the vapor thereof may euaporate and ascend
unto the lame member, and use this so twice every day.

Item, take dry Sage three M. seethe it in a pint of rain water until the
third part be sodden away: at the length cast therein one ounce and a half of
Stechados, let it sees a waume or two: then temper amongst it half a pint of
wine, or salt water, with half so much white wine, clarified honey two ounces:
anoint and rub therewith the lame members. This (and other more which follow
hereafter) is approved for this disease, if one cannot get the natural bath,
or will not use artificial bathes, which is always to be used before the
anointing, therewith before hand to open the pores.

Take a hot Tile, sprinkle it with good strong wine, receive the vapors unto
the lame members, when they then be warmed and besweated, dry them with warm
clothes, and anoint them with some of the foresaid things, now with the one,
and then with the other, and cover well the lame members with a good woolfes
furre, or with somewhat like unto it.

In like manner it is also good to rub the lame side with good burnt wine, or
spirit of wine only, or half so much white wine tempered amongst it: but if
you will have it yet more forcible, then take in the stead of the spirit of
wine, one of these Elixers vitae following.

A water for Inunction.
TAke Rosemarie, Marioram gentle, and Bay berries, of each one handful, Venice
Soap as much as the yolke of an egg, six ounces of Lauander water, temperall
these together in a mortar, and let it stand a day: afterward wring it through
a cloth, the which is thus to be used: First rub the member well with a warm
cloth, and anoint the water upon it.

Also he is twice a week for to swallow or slide down, 9. or 11. prepared
Mustard seeds, and to drink thereupon two or three ounces of Lauander water,
and so to continue this the space of three weeks: otherwhiles he may anoint
the lame side with the oil of Juniper, but not too often: for thereby might
come great hurt. The oil of Costus is also especially recommended for this
use, which is thus made.

Oil of Costus.
Take the roots of Costus one ounce, Pepper, Pieretrum, Euphorbium, of each
eight scruples, Beuer cod half an ounce, melt these all together in six
ounces of the oil of Wall flowers, or in oil of Bay which is more forcible.

Another.
TAke powned Pieretrum, half an ounce, sees it in six ounces of Sallad oil,
until the third part be consumed, let the sick person be anointed therewith
four times in four and twenty hours: it is much commended of all ancient
and later Physicians.

A marvelous Oil called Hypobalsamus.
THis oil is most highly commended for the dead palsy, and for all
resolutions of the sinews, and is thus made: Take clear Turpentine six
ounces, oil of Bays one ounce, Galbanum, Gummi Helenij, of each three ounces,
Gummi Hederae, Olibanum, Lignum Aloes, of each one ounce, Masticke one quarter
of an ounce, Myrrh, Laudanum, Aloes, Beuer cod, of each three dragmes, powne
it gross; then ad unto it two ounces of spirit of wine, let it stand three
days, afterward take Galingale, Cloves, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Zeduarie, Cucubes,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Diptamus, Comfrey, of each one ounce and a
half: power thereon two ounces of spirit of wine: let it stand so four days,
stirring it oftentimes about, distill it afterward in a glass helm. This
water is called also Balm water, which must be preserved alone, so also do
with the oil: for it swageth and strengthens all the sinews marvelous much.

For this is also meet the oil of Marierom gentle, the oil of Juniper, of
wild Cucumbers, of Tyles, and two precious balmes which shall be hereafter
described in the eight part, which are especial good for the lame members.

This salve following is very good for all lame hands: Take Lauander, Sage, of
each one handful, Juniper berries three ounces, sees all together in wine,
and rub the fingers and other members with it. And if you will have this more
forcible, temper it with the former oils unto a thin salve, which is
wonderfully commended.

Another.
TAke Squils, Rue, Calmus, Nettle roots, Agrimonie, Cowslips, of each a
handful, powne them all together, and power oil of Nuts upon it, and old
Sallad oil four and twenty ounces, and well salted water or wine as much
also: let these sees together until the moisture be wasted away, wring it
hard through a cloth, and temper amongst it Saltpeter, Euphorbium, Pepper, oil
of Bay, of each one ounce and a half, Galbanum, Turpentine, of each two
ounces, Wax as much as is needful for to make a salve thereof. This is
marvelous good against the Crampe, against the cold Gowte, and whatsoever ache
else may proceed of cold.

Also you may make of all the foresaid oil, salues, if you temper amongst it
any grease of Bears, of Badgers, wild Cats, Hens, and Geese, of which you will.

Item take Calmus, the roots of Lillies, roots of Costus, of each half an
ounce, Pepper Pieretrum, Beuercod, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sage three
dragmes, Stechas one dragme and a half, Spicanardi, Squinant, of each one
dragme, and the juice of Cowslips which is well settled one ounce, of the oil
of Indie nut kernels, of the oil of crabs, and wine, of each three ounces:
afterward powne all that is to be powned, the rest are to be bruised by
themselves: sees this by a mild fire so long, until the wine be consumed,
afterward put as much wax unto it as is needful for the salve.

Item, it is reported that this salve ensuing does preserve men from the dead
Palsy: Take Bay leaves, Marioram, Rosemarie, Sage, Costus roots, Scariola,
Mints, Millet, Consolida minor, Sanicle, of each one M. Spicanardi, broad and
picked Plantaine, Agrimonia, Buglosse, and Rue, of each one M. and a half,

Hyssope, nettles, and Tansey, of each half a handful: beat them al together,
and sees them in three pound of fresh butter, until all the juice be consumed:
afterward strain it through a cloth, and temper amongst it white molten Wax
three ounces, Masticke two ounces, Sallad oil one ounce, and make thereof a
salve. This is also good to preserve one from the Gowte.

Another Salve highly commended.
TAke a plucked Goose, taking clean out all the intrails, and wash it with
vinegar; afterward make a dow of Sage, Frankincense, Mastick, powned Earth
worms, Wolves and Cats grease, fill the Goose therewith, and let her be gently
roasted: the fatness which droppeth off is to be gathered in a pot, with some
vinegar. This is a very piercing salve, which does maruellously resolve and
consume all hardness. But if the Wolves or Cats grease cannot be gotten, then
take sheep suet in stead thereof, and anoint the neck and lame members
therewith.

It is also very requisite after the use of this salve, to wear a plaster
upon the lame member, whereto this following is very meet: Take six ounces of
the juice of Rue, which is very clear, and Pigeons dung as much as is needful
for to make a plaster. This plaster is to be laid on the lame part.

Also you shall many times find many kinds of remedies mo in the fourth part,
of the lamenesse and extenuation of the members.

To be noted.
IN this Resolution or Palsy, are two principal members, which are to be
healed with the foresaid oils, waters, salues, and plasters, viz. the member
which is taken, and the beginning of the sinews which are next to the same
member. Take for example, if the Palsy or Resolution is in the one hand, then
is the same, and all the parts of the back, from the neck unto the huckle
bone to be anointed, for that the sinews of the hand have their offspring from
thence.

Further, boxing cups vnpickt are to be applied upon the beginning of the
sinews, which do also help well, because that they do warm and dry them: it
is good also to rub the same places with Salt, Nettles, and Mustard seed. But
always after purging certain days together, whilst that the patient stays
and cease from purging, bathing, and such like, then is he to take every
morning half an ounce of the confection Anacardina, for that it is commended
above all measure in the cold Palsy: and if so be that there be any sweat or
small Ague with it, (like as accustometh to happen, which his heat causes)
then it is a good sign: but if this follow not, then is the patient to
forbear ten days long from all use of Physic, and to continue only with
good meat and drink.

It is also here to be noted, that all that is described before, is only fit
for the resolution which proceeds of cold causes: but if they proceed of
hot causes, the sickness will be augmented thorough the foresaid remedies.

Palsy through falls or blows.
IF so be that one do fall so hard, or be beaten or stricken, that thereby
forthwith he be taken with the Palsy, then it is not to be helped: but if it
come slowly afterward upon one, the^ this salve is very meet for it.

Take Beuercod two scrup. Euphorbium one scrup. Pepper three grains, Pieretrum
half an ounce: sees all these in ten ounces of Sallad oil unto the half,
then temper with it five drag. of Brimstone, and a little wine: It is also
especial good for the Spasmus or Crampe.

Item, take Myrrh, Opopanacum, of each five dragm. Beuercod three dragm.
Euphorbium one quarter of an ounce, oil of Lillies, and of Narcissus, of each
two ounces, make a strong plaster thereof with wax, and spread it upon a
cloth, and lay it upon the place aggrieued.

But good heed is always here to be taken of the lamenesse (and of all that
might concern the same) with heat or without heat, like as we have already
admonished, that it may be known to apply the remedy thereafter.

Lauander, Rosemarie, Spicanardi, (which have almost the same operation) are
inestimably good for the Resolution which proceeds through cold causes.
Therefore all conserues which be made thereof, are not only profitable for
these causes, but also for all lost speech and lamed limbs. If so be that any
will use any wine in this sickness, then is there none fitter nor better then
wine of Rosemarie, or Wormwood wine. Conserve of Sage and of Cowslips are also
much commended; with other things more which are declared in the Palsy.

Conuulsion of the mouth through the Palsy.. 14.
THis disease is thus described of the Physicians: Contorsio is a disease which
alters the natural shape of the face: or, Contorsio is a conuulsion of the
mouth and lips to the right or left side; so that it does otherwhiles clear
shut up one eye, and also the breath issues out but at one corner of the
mouth, whereby sometimes also the whole face is changed in color.

In fine, it is a Crampe, with a contraction and shortening of the sinews,
which draws the lips hither or thitherwards, and these be the most causes,
(like as in the Crampe and Palsy has been showed) that if it proceed of
moisture, then it is a kind of Palsy: whenever it is caused through drith,
then it is a kind of Crampe.

Also this contorsion or contraction comes sometimes by reason of an
impostume, like as in the pain of the throat, which quickly strangleth a body.

This Crampe or contraction of the mouth assaileth a body oftentimes suddenly,
as in Phrenitide and such like, whereof at this present shall not be spoken,
because that the same is commonly a sign of death: it comes also not through
repletion of the body, but through inanition and drith. But we speak here
only of that which is caused of Spasmus or the Crampe, which distendeth the
sinews from hour to hour, therefore is there some advice to be done and taken
for it.

But for to expel this disease there is somewhat to be done unto it out of
hand, that there breed not a worse matter of it, as Epilepsia, or Apoplexia.
This cure is first to be begun with Clisters, especially if the patient be
bound, and to acuate the Clisters by little and little.

Afterward he is to be let blood, if it be not that this accident be so small,
that there were time sufficient first to take a purgation, and to take good
heed whether the urine be clear and well colored, and then to open the
Saluatella, besides the little finger upon the right hand, and to let out three
or four ounces of blood, and after that to purge.

These preparatiue potions is he to take first of all: take Calmus six ounces,
Ginger and Nutmegs of each one ounce, clarified Honey nine ounces, make a
clear sirupe thereof, and give the sick person thereof certain days
together every morning two or three ounces tempered with the decoction of Sage.

Afterward he is to take these Pills: take Pill. Cochiae, de Sarcocolla, de
Hermodactylis, of each one scrup. and Dysagridion two grains, make thereof 7.
pills, with the juice of Rue, and take them early in the morning fasting, and
fast six hours upon it: for this use are also good the pills Foetidae. Will
you then have them more forcible? then take two drag. of the pills Cochiae,
prepared Coloquint, and Bdellium, of each one drag. make pills thereof as big as
a pease, and if the patient be reasonable strong, then give him a drag. at once.

Item, let his head be shaven and rubbed softly with warm clothes, until the
skin begin to be red, and then anoint it with this following: take the juice
of Swines bred three ounces, Stechados, Penniroyall, Mints, Hyssop, of each one
ounce beaten, and one quarter of an ounce of Violets, temper them all together.

When he has then purged well, and the matter is prepared, which is done in
four days, then is he to use every day before meat this Gargarisme.

Take white Mustard seed two ounces, Vinegar one ounce and a half, Honey three
ounces, sees them all together in a pint of water unto the half, and skimme
it well. But it is here to be noted, that these Gargarismes must not be used at
the first, that they make not an affluxe of the humors, and the accident
thereby be augmented.

Item, take Nutmegs, Pieretrum, Stechados, of each half an ounce, sees them
and use them as before. You may also temper amongst it Oxymel of Squils.

Another. Take three ounces of Calmus, Vinegar one ounce, and use it as before.

This contraction of the mouth sometimes also yields much spettle, and to
further the same and to make it run the better, make this Masticatorie.

Take Licebane, Mastick, white Mustard seed, Pieretrum, of each a like
quantity, temper it with molten virgin wax, make small balls or pellets of
it as big as Hasell nuts. This is to be chewed and spit out: the same does
frankincense and Mastick also together, or each chewed by it self.

Neesing.
NEesing is very good: wherewith it might be effected, you are to seek for
that in the first Register.

Salues.
ALso the nape and hinder part of the head, the throat, the face, and the
forehead are to be anointed with the oil of Costus: but it were good, that
one made first a Cypers board hot, and bound it in a cloth, and laid it so long
on the neck and shoulders, until the same parts were thoroughly warmed, and
afterward anointed.

Item take the oil of Costus one ounce and a half, oil of Euphorbium half an
ounce, Mints, the seed of Rue, Stechas, Penniroyall, Lignum Aloes, of each
half a drag. oil of Beuercod one ounce, white Wax as much as is needful;
besprinkle it with some Vinegar of Squils, and therewith anoint all the neck
from the nape to the rumpe four times in 24. hours.

Item take Calmus four ounces and a half, Ginger, Nutmegs, of each three
drag. oil of Costus four ounces, wine as much as is needful: let them sees
together by a mild fire until the wine be consumed, strain it, and make a
salve thereof with molten wax.

A Plaster.
TAke Betonie six ounces, white water Mints, field Mints, Penniroyall,
Marioram, of each one ounce and a half (altogether green,) Stechas two
ounces, Pease meal one ounce and a half, Bean meal two ounces, Saffron
half a drag. sees these herbs in sharp lie unto grout; afterward temper
the meal and Saffron unto it, also oil of Beuercod, oil of Pepper, and of
Rue, of each two ounces: lay it morning and evening warm upon the head, and
upon the temples of the head, where this contorsion is.

Another.
TAke Opopanacum three ounces, Calmus three drag. Ginger, Nutmegs, of each one
dragme, Turpentine one quarter of an ounce, melt the Gum and Turpentine, and
temper it with the rest unto a plaster; then spread it upon a cloth, and lay
it behind upon the head, upon the neck, and over all the nape.

Item, Take fresh Swines bread half an ounce, Marioram gentle seven drag.
Lignum Aloes, one drag. and a half, sees them in a pint of water unto the
half: but before that the patient draws up this into his nose, he must first
take his mouth full of honey, or sugared water, and then hold some of the said
decoction in his hand, and draw of it three times through the right nostrill,
and thrice also through the left nostrill, and that one hour before supper: the
like also in the morning and at noone. This is very requisite for health: he is
also every day two or three hours before supper to swallow down two or three
corns of Myrrh.

A capital Powder.
TAke Stechas, Penniroyall, white water Mints, and Betonie, of each one drag.
and a half, Pieretrum, Costus roots, Licebane, of each one drag. Marioram
gentle, powne it, and temper it all together: Strew therewith the uppermost
part of the head, rubbing it gently. Also it is to be strewed thereon, when he
has anointed him with the oil of Costus.

A Lotion for the feet.
IT is also very good to use these Lotions for the feet before meat, wherein
Woodbind is sodden. Also the feet, the legs, the thighs, the hands, the arms
and face may be washed with this decoction following: Take Bay leaves two
handfuls, Juniper leaves three handfuls: sees them all together in a good
deal of water, until it smell sweet.

Order of Diet.
THis patient is to keep himself from eating and drinking; and all other
things, as is taught in the Palsy, and Apoplexy: viz. to eschew wine, to
drink honey water, to eat Kids, or young Goats, Roebucks, and Hares, rather
roasted then boiled.

All his other meats are to be besprinkled with Rosemarie, Sage, Wormwood,
white water Mints, garden Mints Penniroyall, and Comin. And albeit that hot
spices are also good for him, yet may he in stead thereof use these following.

Take Nutmegs one ounce, long Pepper, Beuercod, Galingall, of each one scrup.
Seduarie half a drag. powne all small and temper them together.

Item take Nutmegs, Ginger, of each three drag. of the confection of Calmus
three ounces, Sugar as much as will suffice to make an electuarie: this ought
he to use in the morning fasting. Eggs howsoever they be dressed, Rice,
Colewoorts, and Rapes he may eat. But from milk, and all that is dressed with
it, from all fruit, and all that is of cold a and moist nature must he refrain.
A dark habitation is also meet for him, and to look oftentimes into a
looking glass, and to force himself to set his mouth right: great labor also
is not fit for him, but rather rest and moderate sleep. To warm him, he is to
burn that wood which is warm of nature, as Fur wood, and Juniper wood: he
is always to keep his head covered with a Fox furre, and to hold always a
piece of Nutmegge in the mouth, in the place affected, or in stead of that
these Trociscos: Take Calmus two ounces and a quarter, Ginger half an ounce,
Nutmegs two drag. and a half, powne them all together, and steep them two
days in water of Sage. Now if it be too moist, then let it dry away upon
warm ashes, and then with honey make Trociscos of it, of the weight of a drag.
and a half, and hold them in the mouth: if you can swallow them, they will do
no hurt.

And if these things will not help, then must he purge again, and lastly make
an issue behind in the nape of the neck, and on the veins under the ear, or
under the chin with an hot iron or corrosiue, and to hold it long enough open.

Of the Crampe, and conuulsion of the sinews by the Palsy.. 15.
THis disease is also a kind of Paralysis, called of the Grecians Spasmus, and
by the Latinists Conuulsio, and it has also no small agreement with the
foresaid contraction or contorsion of the mouth, (like as has been said
already:) in like manner also with the Epilepsia, and all other diseases which
be reckoned amongst such like infections, and it is described thus: Spasmus or
Conuulsio, is a contraction of the sinews and muscles against our wills, which
sometimes do conuulse but one part, and otherwhiles the whole body. The
Grecians for diverse causes, do give this Crampe, sundry names, Opisthotonos,
that is, when the sinews are drawn backwards; Emphrosthotonos, when they be
drawn forwards; Tetanos, when one member waxes stiff like to a stick. The
causes of these are otherwhiles when any one is thrust into a sinew, wounded or
ouerburdened with too much labor or work. Also it is caused through great
scowring of the body, through excessive bleeding, through unbridled lechery,
fright and worms, etc. In fine, the causes do proceed of an intemperate
nature, as cold which is augmented, and heat which is diminished: also of
drith and moisture, according to that the body is full or empty. Of these
differences there be yet more, which are here too long to be rehearsed.

Nevertheless, yet can I not omit, that this Spasmus (of whatsoever cause that
it do proceed, and especially if it be caused of a hot Ague) is not only a bad
sign, but also that it is incurable: for by reason of the heat the sinews
will be a great deal too dry, and shrunk up short, like as one for example
may see by a leather lace, or such like, if one hold it by the fire, then will
it be hard and shrinketh. On the contrary, if it be holden in a moist place,
it will be lithier or limber.

When as then such kind of Crampes do assail the whole body, and that the
patient begins to be childish, and addicted much to sleep, then is the
disease in the marrow of the backebone, which has his offspring from the
brain. Also this disease comes either suddenly, or slowly: that which
comes suddenly, proceeds of repletion of the body, and is through purging
(as has been said of the Palsy) to be remedied.

But it must be more and oftener anointed and rubbed with the oil of Costus,
for that the humor is much grosser than in the Palsy, and may worse be
consumed. But if so be that this sickness be by little and little bred and
grown, then is the cure to be taken in hand after another manner, viz. at the
first to use preparatiues, and afterward digestiues are to be used, as
follows hereafter.

The rubbing of the lims downward is very meet, for that it disperseth and
digesteth the moisture, and opens the pores: afterward are these salues or
oils following to be used: to lay plasters upon it, to cover the limbs with
Fox, Wolves, or Cats furre, and to keep them warm: or if so be that one
member alone be conuulsed, it is to be wrapped about with warm clothes.

Suppling or mollifying Salve.
TAke the Muscilage of Fenegreeke, and of Linseede, of each half an ounce,
fresh butter and sewet, of each two ounces, and a little wax, and make a salve
thereof.

Digestive Salve.
THis Salve is described before in the 13.. viz. where it begins: Take
Calmus, Lilly roots, etc. Of these two salues the patient is to use at the
first the mollifying ointment the first two days, and afterward the other so
long also, and so forth, now the one, and then the other, until that the
matter begin to avoid.

Item, take a fat young Cat, pluck off the skin, and take out the intrailes,
chop her small, and fill therewith a Goose, let her roast softly, gather the
drippings, and preserve it well, for it is also good for the palsy through
cold. You have before in the 13.. one salve almost like unto this, and also one
other salve more in the said discourse where it begins thus: Take Beuercod,
etc.

Take Euphorbium, Cinnamome, Saffron, Frankincense, Beuercod, Pith, Opopanacum,
the juice of wild Rue, and dry Hyssope, of each half an ounce, Wax one ounce
and a half, Pieretrum, Ammoniacum, of each half a drag. Sallad oil as much
as is needful for to make a salve, therewith are you to anoint the whole
body.

Take oil of sweet Almonds six ounces, beaten Saffron one drag. and a half,
good wine euict 12. ounces, sees them all together in a tin pan on a mild
fire, until the wine be consumed, and anoint therewith the cramped limbs,
this is a noble remedy.

Many kinds of sewets or fats are very requisite for this, for to make salues
thereof, viz. of Lions, Bears, Badgers, Hens, Goats, Capons, and such like,
as shall be hereafter discoursed in the fifth part, where we shall speak of the
lame and extenuated members.

There are many more common plasters and salues good for this, which are to be
found ready at all Apothecaries, as follows hereafter. Ceratum de Hyssopo,
Vnguentum Arragon, Martiaton, Emplastrum de Meliloto, Diachilon, Oxycroceum
dissolved with the oil of Lillies, oil of Tyles, oil of Foxes, of Beuercod,
of Rue, and of blew Flower de luce, and all other which be warm of nature. Of
the things which are to be taken inwardly, Treacle, Mithridate, confected
roots of Eringus, and also Wormwood wine are very good.

Of Bathing.
ALl Bathes which be by nature Allomie, or Sulphurish, or made artificially,
are much commended. Also one may prepare a bath in this manner: take wild and
tame Rue, Juniper tops, Wormwood, Sothernwood, Penniroyall, Bay leaves, Cypers
roots, Dragon blood, Squinant, of each one M. seethe them all together in
sufficient water for to bath therein, put the patient into it, and afterward
lay him in a bed, that he may sweat. In like manner is meet for this a dry
bath; but one must not abide in it long, for avoiding of swo^ning: you may also
use the bath which is discovered before in the 13.. Also gargarismes and
neesings.

Of the Crampe through emptiness and heat.
IF this contagion assail one not suddenly, but by little and little, as after
an Ague, through great scowring, vomiting, or through much bleeding, then it is
very hard, and almost incurable, by reason that it is caused through
emptiness, to wit, of Exinanitione, nevertheless necessary means are not to
be omitted.

First, Barley water is good for this patient, especially if there be Crabbes or
prepared wood-Snailes decocted therewith, for that this drink will almost
wholly and thoroughly turn to nourishment.

Secondly, he may drink well watered Wine, rear eggs, and Henbroth prepared as
hereafter follows: Take a Hen, chop her small, and put her in a Can, power
Rosewater upon it, and Wine, of each a good spoonefull, stop it tight that
there can come no vapor out, and so put the Can into a Kettle of seething
water, and take clean away the fatness. But if the patient be very weak, the^
take a Capon and roast him a little, afterward drip it with unsalted Lard, A
comfortable broth.
beat him and press out hard the juice, temper it amongst the foresaid
Henbroth, then will the same be the stronger.

A better Broth.
LAy a dressed Capon in wine, powned and distilled in a glassed helm; that water
strengthens much in extreme debilitie: temper also amongst it the yolke of an
egg. Item, chop a Pullet, hang the pieces on threeds in a great glass or pot,
stop it tight, and seethe it three hours long in a Kettle of water, and use
the liquor that has dropped out of it. If you will make it more cordial, then
lay therein ten or twelve pieces of gold. For this is also milk meet; first
woman's milk: secondly, Asses milk: thirdly, Goats milk, as new as you can
get it. If so be that there come a scowring with it, then steel the milk with
steel or flint stones.

The meat which he is to use and take whensoever there is an ague with it,
ought to be Kids, Lambs, and Hens, wherein Spinach, Mallows, Beetes,
Purslaine, Lettice, or such be decocted. Watered wine is also permitted, if
there be no heat perceived.

For Strengthening.
TAke Pullets or Kids flesh which is meetely sodden seven ounces, chop it
small; temper amongst it Cardamome, Cloves, Cucubes, Galingall, Ginger,
Nutmegs, Dragagant, and Gum, of each one drag. Mace, Saffron, of each two
scrup. Starch. Licorice, Currants, pilled Almonds, Pine apple kernels,
Sebestes, Pistacies, pilled Melon seed, Pompeon seed, Gourds, and Cucumber
seeds, white Poppie seed, Lettice seed, and Purslaine seed, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Sugar pennets four ounces; dissolve it in Buglosse water,
with other Sugar as much as is needful for to make a confection thereof.

Of Bathing.
FOr this disease is also commanded for to bath in luke warm water. But to
the end it might be the more forcible, cooling herbs may be decocted therein;
as water Lillies, Violet leaves and Willow leaves. For this purpose also,
bathing in milk is much commended. Item, at last shall the beginning of the
sinews be anointed with warm oil of Violets, oil of Pompeons, and such
like, thereby to stay the exsiccation of them.

This salve following is also marvelous good: Take Hens and Ducks grease, and
the marrow of Calves bones, of each half an ounce, the muscilage of Fleawoort,
Dragagant, and Gum, of each three drag. oil of water Lillies, and Willowes, of
each one ounce and a half, Wax as much as is needful for a salve, anoint
therewith all the back bone. It is also good for all other members.

Crampe through wounding.
But if this Crampe or contraction of the sinews do come through any wounds
then are the oiles of Cammomill, Dill, and Flax tempered together, or each
alone requisite and fit for it.

Item take wine lees, temper some beaten Allume amongst it: this is of a
marvelous force and operation.

Take Linseede, and Fenegreeke meal, powned Dill seed, Henbane roots, and
Annis seeds, of each a like quantity: temper them with the foresaid oil, and
lay it warm upon it.

Here be also two experiments which every one may prove: Take Victorialis
longa, otherwise called Allium Alpium, and wear it always hanging about the
neck: it should defend a body from the crampe. The second: Pluck off an Eeles
skin, and let it be dressed like leather; when you be plagued with the crampe,
then lay it upon it; and when the skin is warm, then cease the pain.

Of the hag or mare Ephialte, and Incubus. 16.
ALthough that we have reckoned among the five species of the palsy or
Apoplexy, the falling sickness Epilepsia to be the fourth; yet does method
first of all require, to write of this sickness, the which through unbelief
is with us called the hag or mare, because that this Incubus is a messenger of
a future falling sickness.

The unbelievers make thereof Daemonium insultans, which is an vpstarting and
pinching Devil, the which we also in this country, as is said, make one
another to believe, that they be witches. But in truth it is none other but a
natural sickness, as hereafter shall more evidently appear.

The Incubus is thus described: Incubus is a sickness which vexes the body,
whereby both motion and speech is taken away. Or more larger; Ephialtes is a
sickness, when a body is in his first sleep, lying on his back, does suppose
and also believe none other, but that somewhat creeps upwards from his feet
unto the breast, the which wringeth, and vexes him there as it were a ghost,
and so wholly hinders his breath and voice, that he cannot call for any help,
yea it seems that it would murder him: therefore is otherwhiles heard of
them, that be vexed therewith, such a kind of groaning, that as soon as the
vexation or torment is past, they awake with great fear and trembling.

And albeit that this disease of it self alone is troublesome enough,
nevertheless somewhat else is to be feared thereby, viz. the conuulsion or
madness which is Mania, and (like as it is already said) the falling sickness
Epilepsia, and especially of them which have great head veins; because that
the brains (as the place of the understanding) are thereby enfeebled.

Now when as such accidents come, then is there no long delay to be looked for:
therefore it is meet indeed that there be advice taken for it out of hand, and
first of all to take good heed, whether the sick person have a good color.
And if so be that also his veins be full, then is the Saphaea to be opened;
secondly (if need require) the Cephalaea; thirdly, the vein of the forehead,
or under the tongue. And if great heat of the time, or any thing else do hinder
it, then set thereon two boxing cups with picking, the one upon the right
brawne of the leg toward the heel, the other hard by the ham: but if it amend
not thereby, then set two upon the shoulders.

Also it is very needful to observe good order in eating and drinking, and to
refrain from wine, sweet things, and especially of all that engenders blood.

Some allow wine, yet that which is thin, white, clear, and well watered,
drunken soberly.

For his meat are all fowls good which have abode in hilly countries, better
than any four footed beasts: yet of these, the wild are always better than
the tame.

Item new laid eggs sodden rear, Capers, with Oxymel are good for him in the
beginning of supper; he is to eschew fish, and especially sodden fish: he is to
shun all fruit, except Raisons, Pingles, Pistacies, confected Pears, Quinces,
and such like.

All herbs be also forbidden him, except Fennel, Dill, and Buglosse: but Rue,
Sage, Marierom gentle, Hyssope, and Rosemarie are especial good for him, which
are rather to be reckened for medicine than for nourishment.

Furthermore, he is to refrain these things, as the Sun, cold winds, the
fire, the smoke, incontinencie, bathing, weariness, care, much vexation, deep
speculation, and especially two hours after meat, all great noise, to look
from any height, to look upon whirling things, or that turn suddenly about,
and all that shines much, all strong sauors, long sleep, especially after
noone, much watching, and such like: but meetely moving after dinner is very
good. Also he must be rubbed otherwhiles from the shoulders to the breast,
until beneath upon the legs, with warm clothes.

And when that is done, then is the head to be kemmed and well rubbed. Piony
roots worn about the neck, and smelling oftentimes unto them, are also very
good. 15. Piony kernels peeled and drunken in honied water, do much hinder and
let that the vapors which might obstruct the brains, should not ascend
upwards, and do also strengthen the brains.

Confected Mirobalani Chebuli taken every morning does strengthen the head and
the brains, and drive away the mare. If the sick body look bleake in the
face, then it is a sign of Melancholy. Therefore is he to use the pills
Cochiae oftentimes, to the end he may be well purged. Further, he is no
otherwise to order himself in eating and drinking, than as is showed in
Epilepsi^; for that Incubus is none other than a small falling sickness, or
Epilepsia.

This water following is very good for to purge: Take Hyssope two handfuls,
Currants one ounce, sees this together in a pint and a half of rain water
unto the half, take thereof three ounces, of Oxymel of Squils one ounce and a
half, drink it every morning continuing the space of eight or ten days,
meetely warm.

When the body is purged, then is the head also to be purged with this
gargarisme ensuing: Take Hyssope, Currants, and Oxymel sodden together with
water, and gargarise therewith. Neesing is also behoouefull, like as has many
times been expressed.

In like manner may you carry these little bals or pellets in the mouth. Take
Penniroyall one ounce, seven fresh Figs, long Pepper one dragme, Pieretrum
half a dragme, powne them all together, and make pellets or round bals of it.
It is also marvelous good twice a week in the evening and morning to take a
half a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, with three ounces of water wherein
Piony roots are decocted.

If this disease be caused through great cold of the head, then it is to be
anointed with the oil of Costus, of Rue, or oil of Bay: But if it be caused
through ouercharging of the stomach, then it is to be helped with vomiting,
clisters, and such like.

For this is also to be sought to strengthen the heart and the brains, which is
very conveniently done with this confection following.

Take red Coral, Hearts bones, Pearls, and burnt Silk, of each half a
dragme, Galingale, Cardamome, Grains, long Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, cleansed
Myrtle, and Piony kernels, of each one ounce and a half, Cinnamom one ounce,
Mace, Saffron, of each one dragme, white Sugar thirty four ounces, sees it
unto a sirupe in Buglosse water, and make an Electuarie of it. In the winter
honey is to be used in stead of Sugar, whereof you are to take in the evening
and morning the quantity of a great nut, and thereupon to drink a draught of
water wherein Piony roots are decocted.

The confection of Diathamaron and Diambrae are also very meet for this
purpose.

For a conclusion, if so be that these foresaid remedies brought not health
with them, then are they once again to be used.

At the last cast or need, there must be plasters laid upon the head, that
corrode the flesh and skin on the forehead, wherein the scul is joined together,
which is to be made with Mustard seed or Cantharides, as is taught in this
Chapter in the second. and in other places, or to open it by an actual
cauterie.

Of the falling sickness, called Epilepsia.. 17.
WE name this sickness with sundry names. And albeit that it be but one kind
of sickness: notwithstanding it seems by diversity of the names to have
some small difference. The Grecians do call it Epilepsia, the Latinists Morbus
Comitialis, Caducus, Herculeus, and Lunaticus: the which we have comprehended
all under four kinds of Apoplexies, and taught also thereby, that this falling
sickness (as also all other) is an infection of the brain.

This is a quick and speedy distraction of the understanding, whereby the
party is so spoiled and robbed of all his wits, powers, remembrance, and all
the use of his members, that he must suddenly and unawares fall down to the
earth, some, and lie a certain space without motion, sees not, hears not,
neither feels, and sometimes, also does forcibly stir and cast him self
about; when he comes to himself again, he knows nothing of it, what is
happened unto him, although there be some that know all that was done with or
about them.

The causes of this sickness are diverse, for that it proceeds of the four
humors of the body, and does chiefly take his beginning of Phlegma, next of
Melancholia, sometime of the blood, and seldom of Cholera. This is also
increased by excessive eating, drunkenness, all sauors of meats; and of all
things which fume up into the head, as Onions, Garlic, raw fruits, and such
like, that be of a cold and moist nature, worms of the belly, whereof the
venomous vapors ascend upwards out of the stomach toward the head,
putrefaction of the detained natural seed, of obstructed terms in women,
like as oftentimes also happens to women which have first conceived, to sit
long in the Sun with a full stomach, to eat or smell to Bucks livers. Also
thunder and lightening do hurt them, whereby they are wont quickly to fall, as
also long and much sleep, and all that increases Phlegma.

There hurts them also, who are infected with this sickness, the South wind,
cold and moist countries, and the smell of these five things following, as
Goats horns, which is so forcible, that they that suppose to be clean rid of
this sickness, receiving the sewet thereof, must immediately fall to the ground.
Item Galbanum, Myrrha, Benzuin, and above all the herb Smallage, like as it is
found, that it has caused one to fall only through looking upon it, therefore
such persons must and are to be kept from them. Youth is also more subject to
this disease than age: but it is easier to be cured in young persons than in
old, like as shall be more at large taught hereafter.

The signs of one that has the falling sickness, are these: if he fall
suddenly to the earth, bends him, beats or strikes from him, loses his
understanding, and tometh at the mouth, if thereby his urine, nature, or
excrements pass away; then it is a sign, that the sickness is the stronger.

Order of Diet.
IT imports as well young as old people in this sickness, like as in all
other sicknesses, but for this sickness must regard be had, especially of the
age and youth, nature, custom, and ability of the patient.

In common falling sicknesses is first to be eschewed all cold moist and watrie
places, in like sort also all meats cold of nature, all that brings with it
slime, and obstructions, as Dow, Milk, Fish, Gourds, Lettice, Beetes, Spinach,
Purslaine, Cucumbers, and fat flesh. Item all strong things, as Onions,
Garlic, Scallions, Radishes, Coleworts, Mustard seed, all that is much
salted, and all Spices. Item, fresh water, all strong wine, be it red or white,
and chiefly sweet, they are very hurtful: like as is also to eat too much,
and to swallow down meat vnchewed, and to eat again before the former be
digested, long sleep, and principally to sleep by day, he is utterly to
eschew.

But on the contrary, all his meats are to be drying, as Mutton, Partridges,
Pheasants, all wood Fowls, with some Pepper, Zeduarie, and Galingall prepared,
and always rather roasted then sodden: his drink must be thin, clear, small
red wine; but if the wine be somewhat strong, then it is to be tempered with the
water of Buglosse, or the water wherein Betonie roots are decocted. Great
motion is not fit for him, but rather much rest.

The remedies which are to be used for this falling sickness are most of them
here before (where we have discoursed of the hag or mare) described, which
according to the importance of the cause must be used for old folks, which be
burdened and troubled with this disease.

And because (like as before is discovered) the young children by reason of
their moisture, whereof they be full, are more subject to this sickness;
therefore we will first (as much as shall concern that) describe these means,
and remedies following.

Of the Falling sickness in children.
With sucking children nothing is safer to be taken, than that the mother or
nurse do observe a good order of diet, eat meat that is light of digestion,
and that moderately warmeth, that she refrain man, and all that makes gross
blood. And if she be conceived, then is the child to suck no more at any hand:
before meat she is to move and stir well, and to drink watered wine or small
Beer: she is to refrain and leave all fruits, and especially those that be
cold and moist. In fine, she is not to govern her self otherwise than if she
were her self infected with the falling sickness.

When as the child does wax stronger, and begins to feed on other meat,
then it is to be governed according to the importance of his age, and of his
sickness, like as by this prescription (and other Chapters written to this end)
may be seen.

These are always the remedies which by the ancient Physicians be commended
for young childrens falling sickness, and are found profitable.

Take water of Rue, May Lillies, of each a like quantity; give a spoonefull
thereof or more, according to the bigness of the child, make pieces of Tiles
hot, lay chopped Rue thereon sprinkled with vinegar, hold him that before his
nose: the same is also good for ancient people.

Temper Conserve of Violets in Endive water, or Pyony water; this is very good
if there be any heat mixed amongst it.

Make thick Almond milk, temper therein as much Sugar that it be as thick as
pappe, wipe thereof in the child's mouth, it nourishes well, brings sleep
with it, and defends the stomach from all foul stinking humors: the water
of Chickweeke is also very requisite for this.

Others do commend much for this, the water of Cowdung: and if it cannot be
had, then is the Cowdung to be broken into fair water, and strained through a
cloth, and to give thereof half an ounce at least.

Item, take the water of black Cherries, water of Tillet blossoms, of each a
like quantity: give it in the time of sickness, or when it is thought to be
at hand.

The fish that is called Mustella Fluutatilis, or Trinca, called Trisca in
Latin, has two small bones lying upon the brains, which are to be dried and
powdered, and given to the child. These are marvelous good: but these small
bones are to be taken out of an vnsodden fish, for when they be sodden they
have lost their virtue.

It happens also, that children when they be full of worms do get the falling
sickness, which is very dangerous: against which you shall find hereafter in the
third part, where we shall discourse of the worms, sundry good aduises.

Take young Magpies out of the nest, distill water of them, and give to young
children a spoonefull for the Falling sickness.

Another. Take three young Magpies that cannot fly, Vngula Alcis, three drag.
Hearts horn shaven one drag. and a half, distill them together, and use them
as before: it has been often proved.

Item, take Carduus Benedictus water two ounces, Lauander water half an ounce,
when you perceive that the falling sickness will assail any body, whether
they be young or old, then look that you get a young hare, which sucketh
still, take the maw out of it, (hang it in the air that the milk may dry in
it) whereof give to the sick person one drag. or less (according to the
importance) powdered with fresh water: for this are Pyony kernels good, worn
about the neck, and also the powder thereof taken, the root sodden, and
dronken thereof, and the powder strewed upon the meat, is also very good.

A good Powder.
TAke prepared Pearls one drag. red Coral half a drag. Miscleden one drag.
and a half, prepared Amber two scrup. Hearts bones one drag. Pyonie seed, and
the roots, of each half a drag. white Sugar one ounce, beaten gold six
leaves: of this powder is every week one drag. to be given with Betonie water:
Sometime also half a dragme or a dragme tempered with a little broth.

A Powder.
TAke half a drag. of the scull of an executed man, prepared Pearls one drag.
Hearts horn two scrup. Tormentill, Seduarie, of each two scrup. Sugar candy
one ounce and a half, five leaves of beaten gold; temper them all together,
and give it to the sick body with Pyonie water and such like.

A Confection.
FEtch these things following at the Apothecaries: take Diapenidium at the
Apothecaries three drag. Pliris Arcoticon, one drag. Diambra half a drag.
Cinnamome one drag. and a half, Nutmegs, Cucubes, of each two scrup. Ginger
one drag. Sugar eight ounces, melt them in Pionie water, and make a Confection
thereof.

All that is before written of young children, is also to be used for aged
people, taking always good heed, whether the sickness be great or small, and
also with that which follows hereafter.

Yet more of the Falling sickness.
But if so be that the Falling sickness does assail young, full grown, or
ancient people, then (besides all that is already discovered) this is one
common and necessary rule, that every one which is infected with this
sickness, keep himself at home in rainie weather, in places which be warmed
with fuming works and fire, and be also dry. The chamber is to be strewed
with herbs, which are necessary for the falling Evil as Rue, wild Time,
Rosemarie, of each half a M. powne them, and make them in a bag three
quarters long, at night lay it on both sides under the head.

If there be then any one infected with this sickness, that perceives
something to ascend or clime up out of any member of the body toward the
head, then must he, as soon as is possible, and before that he falls or
goes beside himself, bind hard the place where he feels it creeping upwards,
wring hard the fingers and rub the feet, set boxing cups behind on the neck,
without picking, thereby to suppress the ascending vapors, and afterward (if
it may be possible) for to set or minister unto him this Clister following.

Take Swines bread, black Hellebore, Centorie, fresh white Daffodill, of each
one drag. wild Saffron seed half an ounce, sees this in a quart of water
until the half. Take 13. ounces of this decoction, temper therein Hiera
logodion, one ounce, oil of Euphorbium 10. drag. Salgemme one drag. and a
half, temper all these together, it is a very strong Clister for to draw the
matter out of the head.

Set also great boxing cups on the inside of the thighs, besides the
buttockes, and rub well his arms and legs downward.

Take the juice of Swines bread, the seed of Rue, the Rennet of Hares mawes,
of each one quarter of an ounce, stir them together in a mortar, blow that
into his nose through a Vultures quill: there have been before times maruels
wrought thereby.

There is also a great noise to be made about the patient, to open his eyes,
and hold great light before them: when he is come to rest again, then is he to
purge often with these pills Cochiae (or some other) but using always before
certain Iuleps, thereby the more easily to take away the humor. Whilst that
he uses these potions, he must presently upon it, likewise also two hours
before meat, take and use the quantity of a Nutmeg of this conserve following.

Take Pistacies shaled, which have been steeped one night in Pionie water three
ounces, Doronicum, Hearts bones, Burrage, and Buglosse flowers, Violets, Roses,
of each one quarter of an ounce, red and white Behen, of each one drag. and a
half, Basil, red Coral, of each two drag. and a half, Iacint, Smaragda,
Saphir, of each one scrup. Grains, Lignum Aloes, of each two scrup. water
Lillies, and Yuorie, of each four scrup. five leaves of beaten gold, Muscu^,
Ambra, of each five grains, Honey of Roses, sirupe of Citron peeles, of each
five ounces, Sugar three ounces: you are to sees the sirupe and Sugar in four
ounces of Buglosse water until the water be clean consumed: break the Musk
and Amber in a little Lauander water, and temper all the rest amongst it. This
may be also used whenever he uses not the other pot^ons, and so forth now
the one, and then the other.

It is also advised to cover the place whence the disease is caused with
plasters, which make blisters, and to let them lie so long upon it, until the
blisters be drawn full of water, and break of themselves, and run out; the
which are not to be suffered to shut in ten days; to the end the moisture have
his full course, for this is one of the most principal remedies that is meet
for this malady.

Plasters which raise and draw blisters.
TAke Mustard seed, Pepper, and Euphorbium beaten small, of each one drag.
Honey of Anacardio, as much as is needful for a plaster: spread this upon a
cloth the bigness of a Doller, and lay it on the place where you desire.

But this ensuing is generally used: Take Cantharides (heads and wings broken
off) one quarter of an ounce, Honey of Anacardio, and sour dowe, of each one
drag. strong vinegar as much as is needful for to temper it together: lay this
upon it as is said, when the blister is full, open it with a needle with a
thread in it, and leave the thread behind, that thereby the humidity may be let
out. Item, take black Soap, quick Lime, of each one quarter of an ounce, mix
them together.

A Stronger.
TAke Cantharides prepared as before, quick Lime, of each a like quantity,
temper them with the juice of Daffodils, some do burn it with iron or gold.

When as these blisters have run enough, they are to be healed with this salve:
Take Aristologie, Ireos, Myrrh, Frankincense, Sarcocolla, of each one drag.
oil of Roses four ounces, Wax as much as is needful; make a salve thereof.
For this also is advised to set boxing cups with small picking upon the same
place: And if the patient, before the sickness assailed him, were grieved with
any kind of vomiting, with griping and panting of the heart, and came thereby
to fall: then is the vomiting or casting to be furthered by all manner of
means.

Take blew flower de-luce roots one ounce, Aristologie half an ounce,
Centorie, garden Mints, Wormwood, Rue, Sage, Hyssope, Polypodie, Mallows,
Mercury, of each a M. Silver mountain, Ameos, Dill seed, wild Rape seed,
and Basil seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, beaten Pionie seed, and a
little Bran: sees these all together in a good deal of water: of this
decoction you are to take 14. ounces, temper therein one ounce and an half of
Honey, salt one quarter of an ounce, Hiera Picra, three quarters of an ounce,
oil of Rue two ounces, make a Clister thereof.

For to Purge.
Half an ounce or one ounce of Hiera Picra taken oftentimes, is very
convenient. But it is better to use first some preparatiue potions, which are
thus to be composed.

Take blew flower de luce roots, or Ireos, Pyonie roots, Fennel roots, and
Aristologie, of each one ounce and a half, prepared Squils one ounce, garden
Mints, and Wormwood, of each one handful and a half, wild Thyme, Miscleden,
wild and tame Sage, and Rue, of each one M. Annise, Fennel seed, Pyonie
seeds pilled, of each one ounce; Silver mountain, Bas^^l seed, of each half
an ounce; Licorice, Raisins, and Stechas, of each one ounce, the juice of
Fumitorie (or the water) two ounces, clarified honey six ounces, Sugar nine
ounces: sees the herbs, seeds, and roots all together; afterward wring it
out hard, and with the decoction, the Honey and Sugar make a clear sirupe:
give thereof to the patient the space of certain days together one ounce and
a half, or two ounces, with any of the waters meet for it. And because that
the foresaid Hiera is gentle in purging, and this sickness does require strong
things; therefore take Hiera Picra two drag. and a half, prepared Coloquint,
and Bdellium, of each half a scrup. Masticke three grains, make pills thereof
with the juice of Wormwood, and give the patient one drag. at night going to
bed.

In like sort when he goes to bed, then is this salve following, the quantity
of a Hemp seed, to be wiped at the least thrice a week in the patients nose:
Take Ox gall one quarter of an ounce, Starch half a drag. Nigella seed half
a scrup. Marioram gentle six grains, white Hellebore 5. grains, Euphorbium
3. grains, powne all reasonable small and temper it well together.

After Purging.
AFter purging is the sick person to use a comfortatiue, as hereafter
follows: Take prepared Pearls half a drag. Galingall and Cinnamom, of each
two scrup. Seduarie half a scrup. prepared Coriander, red Coral, of each one
drag. Nutmegs, Cloves, Cucubes, Coutchenell, Annise and Fennel, of each
fifteen grains, yellow Saunders, and Masticke, of each five grains,
Diptamus, Misselden, pilled Pyonie seeds, of each two scrup. confected Citron
pills half an ounce, Sugar Candy half an ounce, conserve of Roses, and of
Stechados, of each three dragm. but if the Conserve of Stechas cannot be had,
take powned Stechas one dragme, six ounces of Sugar decocted to a sirupe in
Rose water, and then temper the rest amongst it. In like manner are other
stomachicall things to be used; for which Masticke is highly commended.

For strengthening of the stomach is this shield worn: Take Mastick three
ounces, Spikenard, Roses, Frankincense, of each one drag. stamp them all
together, and make it to a plaster with odoriferous wine, spread upon leather,
and lay it upon the stomach: if it will not cleave fast, add wax, and oil
of Masticke as much as is needful unto it.

Another.
TAke Laudanum, and Masticke, of each one ounce and a half, Frankincense one
quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Seduarie, and Annise seeds, of each one drag.
and a half, Roses, red and white Saunders, of each one drag. garden Mints, and
Bloodstone, of each one quarter of an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, melt the
Laudanum in the Tuipentine in a warm mortar with a little of the juice of
wormwood, temper the rest beaten small amongst it, and make a plaster or
shield of it: you shall have more of these shields for the stomach in the third
part.

After the use of the purgation, the patient is to take once a week at least,
early in the morning, one drag. of Mithridate tempered with Balm water, and
thereupon to remain lying the space of four hours, and to sleep if he can
without using any thing else the same day.

A Bag.
TAke Species Electuarij de gemmis, Laetificantis Almansoris, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Mace one drag. Marioram, Indy Spica, Lignum Aloes, and red
Stirax, of each half a dra. each stamped alone, make a silk bag and wear
it on the left breast; when it is besweat, then let it dry again.

Here follows yet many a good remedy.
TAke Pieretrum, Masticke, of each a like quantity, temper them with molten
Wax, and make small bals or pellets thereof, of the bigness of a Hasel nut,
chew them and spet out the slime, kembe your head oftentimes, and anoint it
with the oil of Masticke and Spikenard: the Gargarismes which follow hereafter
are very meet for this sickness, Take Ireos, prepared Squils, of each one
ounce and a half, Hyssope, wild Thyme, of each one M. Pieretrum one quarter of
an ounce, Licebane, Masticke, of each one drag. white Hellebore one quarter of
an ounce, Pyonie seed pilled, and Ginger, of each five drag. Raisins (the
stones taken out) two ounces, Vinegar half an ounce, clarified Honey three
ounces: sees all that is to be sodden, afterward temper the vinegar and honey
amongst it.

Neesing.
THe Neesing (like as it is oftentimes said already) is very special good,
thereby to purge the brain. But for this sickness are Pyonie roots beaten
commended above measure, and blown into the nose. If you temper this powder
with the juice of Rue, and drop it into the nose, then will it be more
forcible, for the Rue has a marvelous operation against the falling
sickness, like as has also Spikanardus: these foresaid things are also good
beaten, and smelled to the other, as this small bag following.

Take wild Rue beaten half an ounce, Silver mountain one quarter of an ounce
red Stirax one drag. and a half, Pyonie roots five drag. temper them well
together, and bind them in a little bag or cloth and smell unto it.

Of things that may be hanged about the neck.
IN this falling sickness are some things highly commended of all the famous
Physicians, to be hanged about the neck, and they allege thereto also
certain reasons and experiences, wherewith they do prove and show, that they
that wear them about the neck, do not fall, and omitting it, their disease
presently returns. This is also no misbelief, like as the common people
thinks: but it is the smell or savor, which does most vehemently withstand
this evil, and therefore is the same at no hand to be omitted. Some write
also, that the red Coral and the Emerald has the same virtue, which
experience must teach us. This happily has bin (as has been said) a cause of
some superstition, as commonly it befalls, that good things are abused: for
every one can tell, that the Gospel of Saint John, pieces of the cross, and
other such like fantastical relics, also sentences of the holy Scripture,
have been used to vnwitch and bless those that have been forespoken. It has
also been faithfully credited, that thereby great maruels might be wrought, if
they were only either spoken over the patient, or hanged about his neck, for
the which this piece of Iugling might also be used, wherein it is counseled,
that a girdle be cut out of a Woolfes skin, even from the head thereof to the
very tail, and so wear it about the body. But because it is not easy for
every man to catch a Woolf, the same is also ascribed to the skin of an Ass.
These things for the most part are accounted as gospel of old doting women:
like as it is also with the gut of a Wolf, that is of many women applied to
the naules of young children against the Collicke and gripings of the belly:
but these remedies following are of better estimation, and of a more secret or
hidden virtue, to wit; Bryonie worn about the neck: also Thyme, Hyssope, Rue,
and Southernwood worn likewise in the bosom, for by reason of their smell
they may have some effect.

A capital Unguent.
TAke Marioram gentle, Rosemarie flowers, of each half an ounce, Lignum Aloes
one ounce, beat them together, and rub them well with strong wine in a mortar;
temper one ounce of Barley meal, Starch two ounces amongst it, apply this to
the head being shaven; it eases the falling evil maruellously. Item, take
oil of Rue, oil of Pepper, of each one ounce, sweet Costus roots, Pieretrum,
Ginger, Galingall, Rue seeds, of each one drag. and a half: mix them all
together, and so apply them warm over both the shoulders. Item, take Beuercod
cut small four ounces, oil of Olives six ounces, Juniper berries beaten
grossly three ounces, put a pint of strong wine upon them, cover it well, and
let it boil a while: with this is the patient to be anointed in the hammes,
in the armepits, and on the pulses of his hands. Also it is very good in this
infirmity to anoint the forehead with the sewet of a Stagge.

Indian Baulme is in like sort good for all kind of falling evils, being
anointed on the roof of the mouth; and albeit that it cures not the
sickness wholly, yet will it greatly hinder his return.

Vngula Alcis.
IT is a common error to wear a ring of this beasts hoof on his finger
against the falling sickness, I have proved it oftentimes, but with no ease unto
the patient.

A Confection or Electuarie for the falling evil.
TAke Pieretrum, Costus roots, Stechas, of each ten drag. Agaricke five drag.
Dill seed, Assafoetida, Aristologie, of each two drag. and a half, juice of
Squils, clarified Honey, of each 14. ounces: boil the juice and the honey with
a gentle fire, until it wax meetely thick; afterward when it begins to
cool, mix the other ingredients with it: take of this every morning three
drag. and fast four hours after it. Montegnana takes God to record, that he
has known a thousand cured thereby. This following is not much unlike the
former, take Pieretrum, Silver mountain, Stechados, of each ten drag. Agaricke
five drag. Cardamome, Assafoetida, Aristologie, of each one drag. and a half,
juice of Squils, and Honey twice as much as of all the rest, or as much as is
needful: let them boil sufficiently, and temper the other things being
powdered amongst them. The patient shall use every day of this confection one
quarter of an ounce, and beware of gross meats.

These two Electuaries following are very good for all manner of falling evils,
except that which is caused of blood: take prepared Pearls one dragme, Cloves,
Galingall, Nutmegs, Cucubes, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom one scruple,
Couchenell, Lignum Aloes, red Stirax, of each half a scruple, red Saunders,
Calamus, Doronicum, of each five grains, Piony seeds peeled, Mistleto,
Diptamer, of each one drag. Currants one ounce, conserve of Roses, conserve of
Stechados, conserve of Burrage, of each two dragmes, white Sugar clarified in
Rose water twelve ounces, make a confection of them.

Another. Take Piony roots one ounce, Mace, Indian Spike, Saffron, red Coral,
prepared Pearls, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom, Cloves, Nutmegs, Ginger,
Pepper, long Pepper, Cardamome, Grains, of each two dragmes, Licorice five
dragmes, Anacardium one ounce and a half, Musk, Amber, of each seven grains,
clarified Honey or Sugar twelve ounces, make an electuary of them: take of this
the bigness of a Nutmeg, and drink a little Meade after it. It is very good
against the falling sickness, the Palsy, and such like other infirmities more,
it comfort the brain, makes a good memory, and expels the lethargy,
and al obliuiousnesse.

One may use either of these prescribed medicines, or this powder following,
take Cinnamo^, Cloves, Galingall, Nutmegs, Mace, Cucubes, of each two dragmes,
black, white and long Pepper, Cardamome, Annis seeds, Fennel seeds, peeled
Piony seeds, Hissope, Diptamer, Mistleto, of each one dragme, Saffron two
dragms, Sugar candy five dragmes, make a powder of them, keep it in a leather
sack, and use it in all thy meats.

Item, take the seeds of Maiden hair half an ounce, Mistleto one ounce,
Tormentill one ounce and a half, make them into powder and minister two dragmes
of it at once, with the decoction of Piony roots when you fear the access of
the disease. For this purpose serves also white Mustard seeds prepared,
conserve of Betony, the juice, the water, the herb, and the flowers: in fine,
all that is made of Betony is very good for the falling sickness of the head,
and for all other infirmities of the same. So is also the conserve of Piony
roots, seeds, water, wine of Piony, and all what may be prepared thereof, as
may evidently be seen by the former receipts: the preserved Eringus roots are
also very profitably used therein.

In like sort also Lauander, Rosemary, Spikenard, their leaves, flowers, wine,
and whatsoever else is made of them: we have also mentioned of the taking of
Mithridate and Treacle: likewise Guaiacum is very commodiously used for this
infirmity. After due euacuation of the body, this is also much commended in
the falling sickness, take the juice of Rue two ounces, Assafoetida half a
dragme, mix them together, and so take them.

Item, take the skull of a sound man calcined or burnt, pilled Piony seeds, of
each half an ounce, Tormentill, Mistleto, of each two dragmes, give it to the
patient as before: the same does also burnt Hearts horn taken with wine, as
also the liver of a Kite, and dried blood of a Sheep, the bladder of a Boar
with the urine dried in an oven, and every day the bigness of a bean taken with
Oxymel. Item, Ravens eggs, Swallows flesh, Wolfs, Hearts, Fox flesh, either
boiled or otherwise, the blood and flesh of a Wesell tempered with the urine of
a man-child. Item, Buckes blood taken, the hoof of an Ass burnt and mixed
with strong Vinegar, and so anointed about the head.

The liver of an Ass taken fasting, the gall of a Bear powdered, the fume of
Peacoks dung or otherwise used, Partridges livers dried, and one dragme and a
half dronken, the brains of Camels, or of Wesels used with vinegar, the bones
of a man calcined, the blood of a Tortoise that lives in fresh water, a Cuckoo
put into a pipkin close stopped, and burnt to ashes, the stones of a Boar, of
a wild Boar, of a Ram, and of a Bear dronken with water, the brains of
Sparrowes, with many strange things more that are highly commended of diverse
famous Physicians, but above all other things is the reuming of a Leueret much
commended, as has been said before. Every one may use of the premises those
that he has approved to be good: but if this falling evil (which very seldom
befalls) be caused of blood, then appears it with redness of the face, red
eyes, and with large veins. In this case is the Saphaea to be opened, boxing
cups to be set on the thighs, and legs, and on al other parts of the body.
Three ounces of oil of Roses mixed with an ounce of Vinegar, and other cooling
things more, are to be applied to the head: also to beware of these meats,
that fume into the head, and that engender much blood, as has been said,
neither may the patient use any Wine, sower Fruits, as Citrons, Lemons,
Veriuice: Pomegranates may he measurably use either raw by themselves, or mixed
with his drink.

Of the Friction.
THe patient is to be rubbed downwards, to wit, from the neck to the very
rump, from the breast to the legs, and from the thighs to the feet, the lower
the better, with rough cloths warmed, thereby to draw the matter downwards:
after that, he is to use a reasonable motion, walking, and kembing of the head.
Some counsel to rub the pulses with Strawberry water: and if all this will not
help, then is an actual Cautery to be used for the extremest and last
remedy, whereof has sufficiently been spoken before.

Of the Apoplexy or dead Palsy.. 18.
EVen as we have generally spoken of this fearful disease in the 9.. this
Apoplexia is the most vehement and last of all the former five infirmities,
because it is more hurtful and perilous then all the rest; for it often
befalls, that these Apoplectici do not only lose their speech, senses, and
memory, but also all motion, natural warmth and nourishment, yea remain
wholly dumb, which happens by reason that all the passages of the brains
are obstructed, whereby the vital spirits cannot be spread over the whole
body: and because they are without sense, without feeling, and without all
motion, do the Latinists call them Attonitos.

This Apoplexia is described after two manner of ways, the one bereaueth a man
of all sense and feeling, and that otherwhiles so long, that the patient
seems to be dead, wherefore it is also commanded, that he should not be
buried before the fourth day: and to be assured that there is no life more to
be expected, thou shall hold a little feather at his mouth, which if it neither
move nor wagge, and that the body waxes stiff, then is he departed. Likewise
a glass of water is to be set upon his breast, and if the same be not stirred,
then it is a sure sign of death.

The other Palsy is somewhat easier, it does first infect the breast, whereby
all the sinews are constrained to move immoderatly, and to hinder respiration,
and this is rightly called Apoplexia. Others do divide it into three kinds:
whereof the first is, when the patient does draw a little breath, but with
great difficulty, as also when he fometh, his breath is not heard, but his
voice a little, as if he were choked, and this is the worst and deadliest
Palsy.

The second has a variable respiration or breathing, sometimes not perceived
at all, and anon returning to his former course, without foam at the mouth:
this also is not without great danger, and albeit that it were cured, yet does
it turn to some other sickness.

The third kind is, when the breath remains in due order. The causes of these
sicknesses are superaboundant humors either in the brain, or in the blood,
ouercharging the stomach with meat or drink, ouerwatching, debility of the
brains, drinking of cold water, cool winds, rainie weather, blows, falls, use
of many cold meats, as fruits, fishes, lettice, overmuch sleep, carnal
copulation presently after meals, long rest or quiet, binding in the body,
overmuch bleeding either by opening of a vein, or otherwise. This disease is
both very common, and very dangerous for old folks, especially if they have
kept an immoderate diet before. The common and surest signs of it are these,
to wit, if the patient be quickly snorting and not sleeping, be handled or
pinched without sense or feeling. Likewise, the vehemency or debilitie of this
disease may be discerned by the snorting: also it is to be taken for a most
sure and infallible sign thereof, if he foam at the mouth, and is by no means
possible to be cured; so that all Physicians herein agree, that nothing can be
done but only to satisfy his friends, yet without all hope of recovery.

But if the patient snort not hard, then is the Apoplexy the less, and to be
brief, a strong Apoplexy makes quick dispatch of the patient, or else there
ensues a dead palsy, which is much easilier cured: wherefore it is altogether
needless to make any great discourse of this Apoplexy, and the rather,
because that all the remedies serving for cure of this sickness, are declared in
the treatise of the falling evil, and of the palsy.

Afterward heed is also to be taken, whether the face wax red, black, or
green, as it commonly befalls if some part be tied or bounden about hard:
for this, are both the Saphaenae to be opened on the feet, and awhile after
both the head veins, afterward in the forehead above the nose. This being
done, the arms above the elbowes, and the legs beneath the knees are to be
very strongly bound, that the blood might be drawn to the pains, yet (as it
has oftentimes been said before) not to let them be bounden too long without
untying them, and then afterward tying them again. Also you are to pinch the
fingers of the patient very hard, and rub both his ears and his nose so
roughly, that it might be painful unto him.

Some do counsel that the outward parts should be stroked downwards with
wine, wherein Ireos or Calamus has been decocted: also suppositories,
Clisters, and boxing cups, and such like not to be omitted, nor yet the
application of Oxyrrhodinum to the head.

But if none of the foresaid signs do appear in the patient, but only a
little rattling in the throat when he breaths, then it is an infallible sign
of many watrish humors, for the which this Clister following is to be used.
Take Centory, wild and garden Sage, Rue, Southernewood, Marioram, white water
Mints, of each half a M. a little Bran, and half a Coloquint tied up in a
cloth, boil them al together in sufficient water. Take of this decoction 16.
ounces, and mix with it mel anacardinum, and oil of Costus, of each one ounce
and a half, Sal gemmae one dragme, Hiera Picra 7. dragmes stir them well
together, this is very meet for the Apoplexy.

To draw the phlegm out of the head, shall thou provoke neesings with
Ellebore, for the which this root is very appropriate, or use this following:
Take white Ellebore, or neesing-woort one dragme, Beuercod half a dragme,
Lignum Aloes one scruple, beat them to powder, and blow it into the nose; and
if he could abide vomiting, the use thereof will not be unprofitable for him,
open his mouth and power therein Oxymel of Squils with warm water, oil of
Roses, and of Lillies. Item, boiled Radishes, or horse radishes in water. Also
this vomiting may be provoked by putting a feather into the throat: give unto
him not much meat, and if it be possible, give him nothing to drink but
Meade, and the next day let him drink one dragme or one dragme and a half of
the decoction of Annis seeds.

Thou shall call alowd and make a great noise about this patient, also use
music, thereby to awake him out of his deadly sleep, which if it will not
help, then is he to be pulled, pinched, and very roughly to be handled.

It is also very meet, that this patient take every day one dragme, more or
less of the confection Anacardina with Oxymel, thereby to bring an ague
according as the cause requires, for it is very hot: wherefore the learned
dispute greatly whether an ague be a good or a bad sign in the Apoplexy.

Of outward applications.
TAke Cammomill, Melilot, Penniroyall, wild Thyme, Marioram, Baulme, Marioram
gentle, of each one M. boil them in water, and bath or foment the head
therewith warm, stamp the herbs, put to them oil of Rue, and of Lillies, of
each one ounce and a half, and apply them warm to the head; if it be cold
weather, then anoint the head with oils that are warm of nature, and with
the oil of Daffodils, of Beuercod, of Pieretrum, and such like: and not only
the head, but also the neck and the whole back bone. Or make this salve
following. Take Calmus, bitter Costus roots, of each half an ounce, Silver
mountain, Basil seed, of each an ounce, oil of Spikenard, of Cammomill, of
Lillies, of each two ounces, white Wine three ounces: melt all that is to be
molten, and boil them together on a small fire of coals, until the wine be
consumed, then mix the oil amongst it, and anoint the whole head therewith,
and the back bone downwards to the very end thereof: And if this will not
help, then shave off all the hair on the head, and apply this plaster
following, being spread on a piece of leather or a piece of fustian, and make
it as big that the whole head may be covered therewith. Take Galbanum,
Sagapenum, Opopanacum, of each two dragmes, Sulfer vife one dragme and a half,
Turpentine one ounce, melt and mix them well together.

Now to finish this part of the brains, we must first remember two things
briefly: First that it is most necessary for this patient altogether to
forbear wine, and to drink some small beer, or to continue with this Meade
following, which is made of twelve quarts of water, and three or four quarts
of Honey being well sodden and scummed. Concerning his meat has sufficiently
been spoken before.

Secondly, if his speech be altogether or very much decayed, then is the water
of Liriconfansie to be used, as it is described in the 5.. before, and with it
all manner of waters of life, which are specified in the eight part. Also
Wormwood wine, Lauander wine, Spikenard wine, and the conserve of the same:
but remember always, that all other wines be straightly prohibited: wherefore
these ought also very circumspectly to be used.

The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Mouth, and all that appertains unto it.
AFter the description of the Brains, which are the uppermost inward member of
the head, we will now speak of other parts, as of the Mouth and Lips. In the
mouth, first is the pallet, the tongue, the gums, the roof, the teeth, the
almonds, with all the other adjacent parts; as the voice, which is made and
brought forth with the lips, tongue, teeth, and with other parts more.

After them follow all manner of accidents that are incident unto the^.

Now to speak of the whole mouth it is to be admired, as also al other parts
that are created by God: for above all that it contains, it is the only
means, whereby every living thing receives food for the whole body. Also by
this the nostrels, the heart and lungs receive air, without which it is
impossible to live.

Thirdly, out of this proceeds the voice and speeches, whereby one man
understands an other, and whereby a man is different from all other beasts,
which have nothing common with us but only the voice.

These things are manifold, as hereafter shall appear more at large. Of the
outward parts, to wit, of the lips, has been spoken in the tenth Chapter: but
before we come to this particular treatise, we will first of all show all that
belongs unto the mouth.

Of putrifactions and exulcerations in the Mouth.. 1.
THese exulcerations or putrifactions of the mouth are of many sorts: one
deep, an other not: some perurulent, some corroding, virulent, as well in the
tongue as in the gums, consuming and spoiling them otherwhiles wholly. They
proceed of diverse causes, and amongst all other of these; to wit, if one scald
his mouth with hot meats, or use any thing which is hot by nature; likewise
also hot vapors which ascend from the stomach and vlcerate the mouth.

If these exulcerations be red, the face also red and inflamed, and especially
about the place where the sore appears; thereby may be adjudged, that it
proceeds only of the blood: but if the color in the face be yellowish, with
heat and drith in the mouth, redness in the eyes, of the throat, and with
blisters in the mouth, without any great swelling, and that the patient cannot
abide any hot thing in his mouth; then proceeds it of Cholera: but if the
ulcers be white, without great pain, without any great swelling of the lips
and gums, and if the spettle be saltish, then rises the same of Phlegma. The
melancholic humor brings her own signs with her, to wit, obscurenesse,
hardness, and blackness.

These infections are thus described: The putrefaction in the mouth is, when
many blisters and ulcers are engendered, which do arrode the gums, tongue, and
throat painfully, running from one place to another, and so spoil the mouth.

Before thou take these exulcerations in hand, look whether they be deep
eaten into the flesh or not, new or old. If they be not big but fresh, and not
ouerladen with much moisture: then use these things following, which may
suffice with some astringent and binding things admixed, as to wash the mouth
with Well water, Plantaine water, and Rosewater, wherein the blossoms of
Pomegranates and their pills, and also Gals have been decocted. You may also use
Rose water mixed with vinegar.

Item, the decoction of Fleawoort seeds, or of dried Prunes, by it self, or
tempered with vinegar. Item take rain water, boil therein the yellow seeds
of Roses, with Galls as much as you please, and wash the mouth therewith: or
extinguish Steel made red hot in milk, and wash thy mouth often therewith.
Item, take Gals one dragme, Rose water six ounces, vinegar one ounce and a
half, put them together. Or take Roses, burnt Iuorie, Coriander, Sumach,
Lentils, Purslaine seeds, peeled Gourd seed, and Cucumber seeds, of each
half an ounce, beat and mix them together; and lastly add a little Camfere
unto them. Take of this powder half an ounce, Rose water, vinegar, of each two
ounces, use it as has been said before: mix Well water with the juice of
Pomegranates or wine: likewise the decoction of Barley mixed with Sugar,
cleanses the mouth. The water of Sage heals all exulcerations, if the mouth
be renced often therewith. Also in a hot cause are very good all fruits that are
sower, cold and astringent, being chewed, as Medlars, Mulberies, Choke pears,
Quinces, Services, Framboies, and such like, especially if they be not over
ripe. Also the juice of Vine leaves, and sower and tart herbs may be used for
gargarismes.

But if these gentle remedies do no good, then purge the patient as the cause
requires, as before has often been showed. But because this is for the most
part caused through heat, he is to be purged with Cassia, sower Dates, or with
the Electuarie of Roses, afterward open the vein under the tongue, or those
that appear on the inside of the lower lip, which is very commodious for all
hot infirmities of the lips.

If sucking children be troubled with it, then is the nurse to be fed with
cooling things, for by the alteration of their milk they are easily restored
to health again: for this purpose is the oil of Sulphur very good, as well in
young children as ancient people, but there are many common things that are
altogether as good as that.

Item, take the yellow seeds of white Roses, blossoms of Pomegranates.
Starch, burnt Iuorie, milk of Lentils, Purslaine seeds, Coriander, Seen
husks, of each a like much, and a little Camfere: make a powder of them, and
rub the ulcer easily therewithal, or hold it in thy mouth with vinegar of
Roses, Rose water, and oil of Roses. Item, for this hot exulceration thou
shall take the water of Shepherds purse, of broad Plantaine, of Roses and of
Purslaine, of each two ounces, the juice of Mulberies, honey of Roses, of each
one ounce, mix them well together, and gargarise with it often.

Item, take Gals, Pomegranate blossoms, and Cypers nuts, of each one ounce,
Roses, white Bryer, two dragmes, Acorne cups half an ounce; beat them
grossly, and boil them in water, and wash thy mouth with it. When by these
means the pain is somewhat abated, then mix fresh butter with honey of Roses,
and anoint the place therewith: this may thou well account one of the best
remedies. Or stamp a four Pomegranate with the pills, wring it out hard, and
add as much honey to the juice; let them sees together until it be thick. If
thou will have it stronger, add the third part of beaten Acornes with it. The
application of boxing cups is also very meet and fit for it: and if the
patient be full of blood, then is the head vein to be opened.

But if the blisters be white, then is the patient to be purged with
Diaturbith, or with their pills following: Take Species Hiera Picra two dragmes,
Species medicaminis turbith, two dragmes and a half, Coloquint half a dragme,
make pills thereof with wine, take of them one dragme or one dragme and a half
at once. It is also very good to rub them with honey and salt; but these things
following are more in use, and more fit for this purpose: Take Alum one ounce,
boil it in Plantaine water; you may also put Plantaine leaves unto it, and
wash the mouth often therewith. Take honey of Roses, warm water, and a little
Alum, half as much vinegar as water, use it as before, it is very good. Take
Roses one ounce and a half, Plantaine one ounce, burnt Alum half a dragme,
Myrtle seeds half as much, Pomegranate blossoms and pills of each one
scruple, let them sees well together and use it as the other. Item take one
pint of water, and a good piece of Ireos cut small, and as much Alum, honey of
Roses 2. spoonfuls, let it boil away two fingers breadth. In fine, whenever
Phlegma is cause of the ulcers, then must drying and astringent remedies be
used, Cypers nuts, barks of the Frankincense tree, Frankincense and Masticke:
and although one should mix these warm things with others that are cold and
astringent, as Gals, Pomegranate pills, Roses, Myrtle seeds, and such like; yet
is not that any error at all, but rather a help. Also of these things
following may gargarismes be made, or little bals with the juice of Pears, or
Quinces to hold in the mouth.

There is in the seventh Chapter and fourth. a water described for the eyes,
beginning? Take broad Plantaine water, with Verdigrease, and Dragons blood.
This may you use if the sore run much, and were very unclean, for it dries
and heals much: Take Plantain water, boil therein gross beaten Myrtle
seeds. This cleanses the sores, and cures them: Conserve of Roses held in
the mouth long does cleanse the same. Oxycraton, that is, wine, water, and
vinegar mixed together, is also very good.

If this exulceration of the mouth proceed of Melancholy, then shall thou purge
as follows: Take Currants one ounce, Burrage flowers, and of Buglosse,
Epythimus, and Seen, of each one drag. boil them in water wherein Mirobalani
Indi, and Chebuli, of each half an ounce have bin steeped and decocted, give
three or four ounces thereof in the morning. In like manner may you purge with
Hiera Ruffi, you shall also use a gargarisme made with Currants and Annise
seeds, and mixed with honey. Hereafter do diverse good things ensue for the
infirmities of the tongue, that are also very good for this present purpose.

Of the swollen Almonds.. 2.
IT chances also sometimes, that in these infirmities the Almonds or the
pallet in the throat do exulcerate: of this pallet shall hereafter especial
mention be made. But for the tumor of the Almonds, and other exulcerations in
the throat, are these remedies following ordained. Take a quart of red wine,
Roses three M. peeles of two Pomegranates, four Gals grossly beaten, Licorice
half an ounce, Currants two dragms, boil them together until the fourth part
be wasted: before thou do adhibite this, wash thy mouth with a cloth dipped
in wine, then use it warm: if it be with any exulceration, then add honey of
Roses unto it, and wash it every day five or seven times.

Aqua Iohannis.
THis water is very good and effectual to gargarize withal, both in blisters
and ulcers: Take Sulphur vife, red Mints, Allume, and Sugar, of each half an
ounce, Mastick, Frankincense, of each two drag. Pieretrum half a dragme, Aqua
vitae three ounces: beat all what is to be beaten, and temper them together:
Take Allume, Sugar, of each half an ounce, boil them together in Plantaine
water, mix it with the juice of Mulberries, wash the mouth therewith, it
asswageth the swelling, dries and heals. The same does also the sirupe of
Myrtle seeds, and of the juice of Nutshels that hereafter are described. In
like manner also Milk, and the juice of Lettice, each by it self. If the
throat be exulcerated within, then take Frankincense, Sandaraca, Masticke, of
each one drag. red Stirax half a dragme: beat them together and receive the
fume thereof at the mouth oftentimes: afterward gargarize with Barley water and
honey of Roses.

For all impediments, putrifactions, and exulcerations of the mouth, are three
diverse gargarismes prescribed and ordained: whereof some are specified
hereafter, wherewith is also declared how that commendable juice of Mulberies,
honey of Roses, and more other things, are to be prepared.

Of outward exulcerations, and contractions of the mouth, has been spoken in
the twelfth chapter, and. 14.

Of a stinking mouth and breath.. 3.
THis infirmity proceeds not only from the mouth, but of many other
accidents more, which the learned comprehend in the number of eight: first, when
the gums do putrify and stink: secondly, bad and hollow teeth: thirdly,
stinking humors that fall down from the head into the pannicles of the mouth,
and there make the spettle to stink: fourthly, stinking slime of the stomach:
fifthly, the corruption of the lights: sixthly, stinking matter and purulencie,
as in Phthisi: seventhly stopping in the nose, or some exulceration of the
same, as in Ozena: eighthly, the corruption before mentioned of the mouth.

Of the foresaid infirmities have diverse Authors sufficiently spoken, as also
hereafter in many places shall appear. Here we entreat only of the
corruption of the mouth, in the which we may comprehend the three last causes.
And first of all, if this stench proceed from the brain, and settle it self
in the tunicles of the mouth, which most commonly comes of heat, then is
there present a great itch, heat, thirst, and drought. For this shall thou
open the head vein, set boxing cups in the neck, purge the head with Pillulae
aurea, or Cochiae, wash thy mouth often with Plantaine water, or water of
shepherds purse, receive the vapor of decocted Mallows or Lettice, and smell
of Roses, Violets, Waterlillies, Willow leaves, Saunders, or of Cammomill.

If it proceed of cold, then use some days together potions of Oxymel
Compositum, or Oximel of Squils, purge with pill. Cochiae, and gargarize with
this water following.

Take Ireos, Cypers roots, Juniper berries, Marioram gentle, field Mints, wild
Time, garden Mints, all of them, or as many as you please, use it often: you
may also draw it up into the nose; you must beware of Fruits, Fishes, Beans,
all hard meats, and such as putrify speedily in the stomach.

If the corruption of the mouth do cause this stinking breath, then shall you
gargarize very often with the decoction of Agrimonie, and Olive leaves, adding
as much Honey unto it, as you think good. Item, take Vinegar and extinguish it
in gold, made red hot a good many times, with Cloves decocted in it; wash the
mouth with it, this takes away the stench: also gold only held in the mouth is
very good: so likewise does chewed Ireos. Take green oken leaves, beat them
to powder, and take of this one drag. every day fasting with Wine, it takes
away the stench. In the 12. Chapter and first. in the description of the
Memory you may find a good powder, which begins, Take Seen leaves,
Seduarie, etc. Item, take Cinnamome, Cloves, Sage, Marioram gentle, Balm,
Nutmegs, Angelica roots, and such like odoriferous things, eat and chew them
in thy mouth, spet them out, and take in fresh: they take away all bad savors
and stenches.

Of what cause soever this infection proceed, these simples following are very
commodious for it, each by it self, to wit, Auence, Cypers roots,
Frankincense, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamome, Citron seeds, Rape seeds, Cloves,
Myrrh, Blatta byzantia, Mastick, Cardamome, Agnus castus, Spica, Squinanth,
Citron leaves, Roses, Saunders, Campher, water Lillies, Rosewater, prepared
Coriander, odoriferous apples, Quinces, Tormentill roots, and such like.

Take white Saunders, Roses, of each five drag. red Saunders, Citron pills,
Squinanth, Gallia muschata, of each two drag. make a powder or little bals
thereof to hold in thy mouth.

A Gargarisme for all infections of the mouth.. 4.
GArgarismes are commonly made for all infirmities of the mouth, throat, and
lips, to cleanse, to heal, and to cure them, but because we have described
many such accidents, and have promised to show some gargarisme for them, which
shall be done at this present: and for that in all gargarismes three principal
things are tempered, as the sirupe of Mulberies, honey of Roses, and the juice
of Nut shells, we will therefore first of all show how they are to be prepared.

The Sirupe of Mulberries Diamoron.
THis Sirupe is diversely prepared. The common people take half Mulberries and
half Blackberries, and boil them like to a Conserve: of this do they give in
hot diseases to comfort. Others take only the juice of black Mulberies,
wringing them through a strainer as soon as they are gathered, and so with
Sugar make it to a sirupe.

The Apothecaries prepare it thus: Take six ounces of the juice of Mulberies,
12. ounces of the juice of Blackberries, both the berries as yet being not full
ripe, clarified honey 11. ounces, sweet wine three ounces: let them sees
together over a gentle fire till it be reasonable thick, and keep it in a pot.

The fourth and best means. Take juice of Mulberries, Blackberries, Framboys,
and of Strawberries, of each four ounces, clarified Honey eight ounces, boil
them with a mild fire till they wax reasonable thick. But note (as already
has been said) that the berries be not altogether ripe; and because the
Framboyes and Strawberries be ripe before the rest, their juices are to be
sodden with half as much Sugar, and so to be kept until the rest be red, all
these sirupes have an especial virtue to cure all infirmities of the mouth, to
cleanse, to cool and to dry: for which cause also they are good to be used
against the Squinancie, and all infections of the throat. But if thou will make
it stronger, then temper Allume, Myrrh, Saffron, and Veriuice, of which thou will amongst it, according as the cause requires,

Honey of Roses.
THis honey of Roses is also made diversely, but commonly as follows: Take
Roses that are not fully blown, cut off the yellow tops, and to one pound of
Roses put three pound of honey which has been clarified very well, and so place
it in the sun.

One that is stronger: Take Rose buds (as before) one pound, beat and boil
them in a pint and a half of rain water, wring it out hard, ad to the
expressed liquor four ounces of the juice of Roses, clarified honey two pound,
boil them together till it be thick enough.

The third manner. Take clarified honey two pound and a half, juice of Roses
new made four ounces, set them on the fire, and when it begins to boil,
mix one pound of chopped Rose leaves amongst it, let them boil till all the
juice be consumed: afterward strain it through a cloth, and keep it close
stopped; for the older it is, the better it is. This honey of Roses has an
easy astringent virtue, it cools, and is very good in all sharp rheumes
that fall from the head into the mouth: it withstandeth all putrifactions,
corrosions, and white exulcerations in the mouth: it expels all stinking
humors of the stomach, that are caused of the gall, if it be used in hot
fevers; otherwise it does cleanse the stomach of all sliminesse, provoke
sweat. That which is made with the juice of Roses, loses, and outwardly it
cleanses all ulcers, stinking wounds, and such like. If any man had taken
physic, and would not willingly vomit it up again, he shall take a little of
this honey of Roses after it.

There is yet another manner of making this honey of Roses. Take six ounces of
dry Rose leaves, put 15. ounces of boiling water upon them in a pot that may be
close covered, let it infuse so eight hours, then wring it out hard, and take
as many Roses more; make the liquor boiling hot again, put it on the Roses,
and let it infuse as before; this reiterate thrile and no more: afterward
weigh the liquor, and to five ounces of it put three ounces of honey; boil and
clarify it: this binds the body, and comfort the stomach.

The sirupe of Nut shells.
THe Apothecaries do call this sirupe Rob nucum, and Diacaridion, which is thus
prepared; Take the green shells of Nuts, beat them and press out their juice:
of this take one pound, clarified honey half a pound, boil them to a sirupe.
Some do take of the juice and honey of each a like quantity: this sirupe is
very good for women and weak folks troubled with hot rheumes that swell. You
may add other things unto it, according as the accident requires.

The gargarismes which are most meet for the mouth, the throat, and the
adjacent parts are these: Take Rose water, Pla^taine water, of each four
ounces, honey of Roses one ounce, sirupe of Mulberies half an ounce, burnt
Alum one dragme, white wine eight ounces, let them sees together as long as
you would do an eg, gargarise therewith warm, it dries and cleanses, Take
Plantaine, Knot grass, and Barley, of each one handful, boil them until the
Barley burst, strain it through a cloth, and add to it honey of Roses, sirupe
of Mulberies, of each half an ounce: use it as above. Item, take Barley half a
handful, roots of Buglosse as many, juice of Quinces one drag. and a half,
Violets, Currants, and Stauesacre, of each two drag. boil them in a good pint
of water, until the Barley swell: this heals, and alayeth the pain.

Take Pomegranate pills, broad and long Plantaine, of each one handful, let
them boil together in a pint and a half of water being strained, ad to it
Vnguenti Aegyptiaci, sirupe of Mulberries, and Nut shells, of each half an
ounce, temper them all together: this dries maruellously, and heals all
stinking exulcerations. But you may not swallow any of it down, by reason of
^he Verdigrease which is in the ^^lue.

In great heat of the mouth and throat, with a sharp matter adjoined, which
excoriateth this place: Take water of Nightshade and Purslaine, of each three
ounces, water of Burrage and of Violets, of each two ounces, seeds of
Fleawoort half a drag. Quince kernels half a drag. Dragagant a drag. and a
half, steep it in Rosewater, press out the slime or muscilage, and mix them
all together.

Take Plantaine water and wine, of each four ounces, burnt Allume half a
drag. honey of Roses, sirupe of Mulberies, of each one ounce, boil them a
little, and gargarise often therewith: this is especial good in all tumors of
the throat, and also in the squinancie. There are many more such like
gargarismes prescribed for many other diseases, as every where may appear.
There are also diverse Physicians, which without any exception, use in all
gargarismes Scrophularia, and that not amiss: for it has a wonderful virtue.

Of the Pallet, and the falling down thereof.. 5.
IT is called by the Grecians Epiglottis, that is, the little tongue, by the
Latinists Lingula, Vuula, and by us the pallet. It is also a very needful
part and member of the tongue, it has five several parts: first, the two
almonds, Tonsillae, that engender the spettle, and moisten the tongue; and if
they wax dry, then do they hinder the speech. Secondly, the Aspera Arteria,
or Trachea, and Oesophagus. Lastly the pallet it self. This is the only
instrument of the voice, whereby the same is fashioned, and for that cause it is
placed in the midst of the throat, because it should cover one part of the
throat, and preserve the breast, heart and lights, should direct the meat and
drink received, to the mouth of the stomach. It befalls often, that it
hangs down, and so troubles one very much, which he is not accustomed to
have before, as may be seen when the tongue is pressed down.

If this proceed of heat, then is the pallet red, the veins about the eyes
swollen, the face red, and the spettle sweetish; all which are signs of
overmuch blood.

But if it be white, the^ it is caused of a cold rheum, which falls into the
mouth abundantly: the voice is hoarse, the face pale, the pallet white, and
much longer than it ought to be.

Of the tumor and falling down of the pallet through heat.
IF the pallet be red, then is the whole back bone from the very neck
downwards, and both the arms to be rubbed with warm clothes, the legs are to
be tied hard, and untied again; afterward boxing cups are to be fastened on
the thighs, against the fire; also if need require, the head vein may be
opened upon the right hand.

Item, a visicatorie unguent shall be applied to the shoulders (which is
diversely described in the twelfth Chapter and 16..) and so let it remain
thereon two hours long.

Item, take Roses, Gals, and Pomegranate pills, of each one drag. Allume one
scrup. Salt half a scrup. make them into powder, and bear up the pallet with
it. Or take Rosewater and vinegar mixed together, gargarize with it; or in the
stead of Rosewater, you may take Well water.

Water of Plantaine, and Nightshade is also very meet for the same, but it
must not be taken down.

Item, mix the sirupe of Mulberies and a little vinegar with water, and
gargarize therewith.

Another. Take the yellow seeds of Roses, and a few Citron seeds, boil them
in Plantaine water, afterward mingle some honey and a little vinegar with it.

This following is of no less virtue then the former: Take the sirupe of
Nutshels, one ounce and a half, the decoction of Sumach two ounces, temper
them together, and use it certain days continually: if you will have it
milder, then take Barley water in stead of the other, and mix some Pomegranate
wine with it.

Item, another that is stronger, and especially at the first: Take two ounces
of Rosewater, one ounce of red vinegar, Acorne cups, Hypocistis, juice of
Sloes, calcined plume Allume, of each one scrup. mingle them together for a
gargarisme.

A Powder.
TAke the green shells of Nuts dried, beat them small, and take a little
spoonful of the powder; hold it to the pallet, and bear it up therewith
continually: this has oftentimes bin approved. Another. Take Allume (that is
called Allumen lamenum) burn it, and use it as before: or burn Salarmoniacke,
and use it as the other.

Note also, that all the powders may most conveniently be used, after that the
patient has gargarized: nevertheless they may be used when one thinks good.

Of swelling, and falling down of the pallet through cold.
IF the pallet be white, then take Cinnamome, Ginger, Pepper, Pieretrum,
Pomegranate pills, Gals, and Roses, of each a like much, make them into powder,
and hold it to the pallet as before.

Item, take long Pepper three drag. Ginger one drag. and a half, Album
Graecum, that is, a white Dogs turd (of a dog that eats naught else but
bones) one drag. Allume four scruples, Sal gemmae, half a drag. use it as all
the rest: abhor not the dogs turd, for in this extremity it has a
marvelous operation.

Item, take Sage, Mustard seed, of each one drag. boil them together in
water, until there remain about eight ounces, then add one ounce of honey of
Roses unto it.

Take Album Graecum, being well dried, fine Bolus, of each one drag. Allume
half a dragme, Pepper and Salt, of each half a drag. make them into powder,
and use it as above.

Take Oxymel, Mustard seed beaten, and vinegar, of each a like quantity,
anoint the pallet therewith.

Item, shave off the hair that grows on the future of the scull called
Sagittalis, apply a great boxing cup unto the bare place, and let it there
remain a whole hour long. This may you reiterate three or four times a day;
it draws the pallet up again.

What is to be done in the greatest extremity.
IF the patient have long hair, then let a strong man take hold of it, and
pull it upward violently, until such time as one may perceive that the skin is
severed or parted from the scull; then also does the pallet ascend, because it
is fast to the skin: it has been found by experience that it has helped
immediately, and has preserved the patient from choking.

But if this infirmity be of long continuance, and that the pallet seems to
hang only at a little skin, and the nether end of it is much swollen, then
there can be no other means used (although one is loath to follow it) but by
incision to take it away; afterward you are to use this gargarisme following:
Take the decoction of Ireos, and Licorice, of each a like much, mingle as much
honey with it as you please, and a little vinegar.

Item, vinegar and water wherein the blossoms of Pomegranate trees have been
decocted.

The order of Diet.
IN this infirmity proceeding of cold, use excalefactiue meats, drinks, and
habitations, beware of all manner of violent motions, anger, vexation of mind,
fear, and such like. The confections, Diatrion, Pipereon, Diamoscu, Diambra,
and Mithridate are very commodious in this malady: or else to gargarize with
Miua Citoniorum, and the water of Sloes.

Take beaten Cucubes half a drag. make thereof with the juice of Roses or
their water, two pills; they are very effectual. These pills following do also
hinder the falling of the rheum into the mouth. Take Pill. Elephanginae one
drag. Mastick, one scruple, make eight pills of them, take twain after supper
at each time.

Of the Tongue.. 6.
THe parts of the tongue are flesh, muscles, veins, and sinews combined
together, spoongious and soft; which member amongst all living creatures, or
amongst them that have a tongue is most different, not only by reason of her
form, but rather by the voice: and indeed it is no less, for by her
wonderful motion (whereof there be three in general) does she bring maruels
to pass.

First, by the manner of the words and speech, whereby we can declare
whatsoever we conceive in mind, and make it known to another body. By this
grows wars and peace, friendship and enmity, concord and discord: by this is
both God and man praised and dispraised. In fine, by this is done both good and
harm, as that merry Aesopus says in his fables, that the tongue is the best and
woorst piece of flesh.

The second is the taste, whereby it can discern which is bitter, which
sweet, sower, tarte, sharp, cold, hot, or any such like: also it adiudgeth
what is good or bad for the stomach.

The third is the sense of feeling, whereby it perceives what is hard or soft,
hot or cold, etc. Besides all this, it helps to hold the meat received
between the teeth, that there it might be chewed, and thence conveyed into the
stomach. Also it serves to gather the slime and moisture of the mouth
together, and to spet it out, which by no means can be effected without it, as
it evidently appears in those that have a dead palsy, and cannot wag or move
their tongue.

This member is subject to diverse and sundry infirmities, as when the tongue is
heavy and flow, hard and immovable, hot and dry; for which cause it is
especially infected of Alcola, which causes it to swell, harden, and
exulcerate, etc. whereof we purpose to speak hereafter.

Of the loss and imperfectness of tasting.
AMongst the before mentioned infirmities, this is also to be placed, that in
the taste, as in the sight and hearing, oftentimes happens that it be quite and
clean decayed, so that there remain not one whit of taste; otherwhiles also is
the tasting only diminished, as when one can perceive some taste, yet not
perfect and to the full. Also it is oftentimes quite spoiled, as when one takes
sower for sweet, etc. As it befalls to them that have the yellow Iaundies,
or to them that are troubled with a hot ague, wherein the patient adiudgeth all
what he tastes to be salt, bitter, sweet, or without savor, according to the
quality of the disease.

The signs of the humor that causes this infirmity, are these: The blood
yields a sweet taste. Phlegma also somewhat sweetish, with much spettle,
humiditie of the head, of the tongue, and of the whole body. Cholera causes
bitterness, saltness, and gives a salt fleame. If there be no taste at all,
then is the mouth of the stomach pestered with many bad and superfluous
humors. If it proceed of melancholy, then is the taste tart, and astringent,
of all that he takes into the mouth.

There may also very sure signs be taken of the tongue: the which if it be
white, then it is not only a sign of cold, but also that the stomach, head,
and liver are full of Plegma: If it be red then does it signify that this
malady is caused of blood, and of hot rheumes: The yellowness is a sign that
Cholera is cause of all: If it be of the color of lead, and blackish, it
shows Melancholy to be the cause of it, unless it should proceed of some
unnatural heat, as in hot Fevers it commonly chances.

Now concerning the remedies for this lost, bad, or corrupted taste: If it come
of a hot sickness or Fever, and the patient be full of blood, then is first
the head vein, after the vein under the tongue to be opened, and a good diet
to be kept, and all manner of cooling things to be used.

He is also to be purged with a potion of the sirupe of Roses, of yellow
Mirobalans, or with these pills following.

Take of the Species Hierae one dragme and a half, shales of yellow Mirobalans
three drag. Diagridij and Annise seed, of each half a drag. temper them with
sirupe or the juice of Roses, and give a dragme of them at once, more or less,
according to the ability of the patient. Or take five dragmes of the Electuarie
of the juice of Roses, or some such like matter: afterward is he to hold in
his mouth vinegar mixed with the juice of Pomegranats: otherwhiles also the
juice of Lettice, of Purslaine, muscilage of Fleawoort, and of Dragagant, made
with Rose water, and held in the mouth a long time, sometimes Rose water by it
self used as before. These pills following are also to be made, and holden
continually in the mouth: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, and Bayberries, of each a
quarter of an ounce, pilled Melon seeds, Gourd seeds, Cucumber seeds,
Pompeon seeds, Lettice seeds, Purslaine seeds, Endive seeds, Dragagant, of
each one drag. make it into pills with the Dragagant dissolved; afterward he is
to gargarize with the juice of Endive, and of Nightshade, or with the decoction
of Roses, Verueine, and Myrtle seeds. Thou shall rub his tongue with pieces of
fresh Melons or Gourds. All these things alter the bad savor and taste of the
mouth in a hot cause.

But if the loss of taste proceed of heat and drought with any humor with it,
which may be perceived, if the tongue be dry, red, and without any spettle;
then are contrary things to be used for it, to wit, cold and moist remedies.

Contrariwise, if it be caused by cold, then note if there be any affluxe of
humors with it, or not: if there be (as commonly it befalls) any
superabundant humors with it, and if the body be full of blood, then is
purging and letting of blood (as opportunity serves) to be used: if not,
minister unto him Oxymel compositum, or of Squils, with the decoction of
Hyssope, Marioram, Sage, and Stechas: afterward purge him with the pills
Cochiae.

A Gargarisme for the same.
TAke Hyssope, and Licorice, of each an ounce, twenty sappie Figs, Honey six
ounces: boil them in water, and gargarize therewith, and hold it a good while
in thy mouth. If there be no agues with it, use this gargarisme: Take the juice
of Squils one ounce, Vinegar twelve ounces, Well water and Honey, of each six
ounces: let it boil a while scumming it. If the patient do abhor every
thing, supposing them to taste very unsavory, then he is to be purged with an
ounce of fresh Cassia, with Oxymel, and with the before mentioned water.

For this purpose serve also sharp meats, as Onions, Garlic, Leekes,
Mustard seeds with vinegar, juice of Limons, juice of Citrons mixed with other
meats: also otherwhiles salt meats.

Of a heavy and slow Tongue.
THese infirmities are of two sorts, the one natural, and the other
accidental, as when the tongue cannot pronounce the letters aright, but in
pronouncing the vowels A, E, I, O, V, is no want in it, because that the tongue
then need not much to be stirred: also in the saying of B, M, P, Q, wherein
the lips do the greatest labor. But in these letters following must the tongue
be most of all used, to wit, in C, D, G, H, L, N, R, S, T, X, Z. In the naming
of F, must the breath be blown out between the upper teeth and the lower
lip. If any of these be any hinderance, then may the same be ascribed to the
tongue, especially if the same be inueterated through a long custom, which
after remains for ever incurable.

The other that proceeds of outward causes, and lurketh in the sinews of the
tongue, may be cured by Physic.

Both these infirmities are caused of four sundry occasions. The first af a
cold matter, that lies in the sinews of the tongue, which is to be perceived,
if they cannot pronounce perfectly the letters above showed in the third row,
and especially the R. Besides this also their sight and hearing decreaseth: or
when one would speak hastily, and therewithal dribbleth against his will, the
which is a messenger of the dead Palsy.

Secondly, it is also sometimes caused of hot agues: then can the patient not
draw his tongue backward, and it waxes black and rough.

Thirdly, this infirmity may proceed of the toughness of the humor that
stays the tongue, as if it were fastened underneath, and therefore could not
be put forth by the patient.

Fourthly, it is otherwhiles caused of certain flesh that grows under the
tongue, the which if the tongue be lifted up apparently may be seen.

The first which grows of cold, and without an ague, is thus to be cured: to
wit, that after the patient has been purged, he open also a vein, and
afterward wash his tongue with this water following, but he is to take great
heed he swallow none of it down. Take Salarmoniacke, Pepper, Ginger, white
Mustard seeds, Pieretrum, Licebane, Borras, Salt, salt of Indie, Marioram,
seeds of Nigella, Marioram gentle, of each one drag. boil them al together in
a quart of water unto the half, and use it as has been said.

Item, boil Pieretrum in vinegar, and gargarise therewith. Look also that
these things do not excoriate the throat, and make it raw: for the Pieretrum
is very strong, and therefore it is commanded (as often has been said) to tie
it in a fine piece of cloth, and to chew it.

A Powder.
AFter the long continuance of this gargarization, take Salarmoniacke,
Pieretrum, Pepper, and white Mustard seeds, of each a like much, make it into
powder, and rub the tongue often with it: but childrens tongues may you rub
only with the powder of Sage, or wash it with Oxymel.

Item, take honey of Roses two ounces, Sal gemmae two drag. mix them together,
and rub the tongue often with it.

Also make this gargarisme following: Take Sage, Hyssope, Calmus, of each a
like quantity, boil them in water. Take Costus roots that are sweet, white
Pepper, Ginger, Licebane, Rue seeds, of each one drag. Pieretrum three drag.
Grains half a drag. Masticke dissolved in vinegar one ounce, temper them
together, and make pills of it of the bigness of small Nuts. Take one of these in
thy mouth otherwhiles and chew it, they are very meet to draw the phlegmatic
matter out of the tongue which there hinders the speech.

But of the bereauing of the speech by reason of the dead palsy have I showed
before how the party so troubled is to be purged and dealt withal, yet
notwithstanding that, I will proceed in teaching all what might happen unto
the tongue.

If the same seem to be caused of a cold and moist matter, then is the tongue
to be often rubbed with Hiera Picra, tempered with a little Stauesacre, Mustard
seed, and Pieretrum, but this is very hot and bitter, so that the patient
shall hardly be able to abide it: but this following is milder.

Take Salarmoniacke and Ginger, of each a like much, temper them with the juice
of Squils and rub the tongue with it.

Item, Oxymel of Squils, and water wherein one or more of the former things have
been decocted, is very commodious: but anoint the neck and the hinder part of
the head with oil of Bays, and of Beuercod, afterward apply this plaster
following upon it, being spread on Leather.

Take Gum three drag. Stechas and Marioram gentle of each one drag. oil of
Marioram gentle, and wax as much as is needful for a plaster.

Take Beuercod, wet it with the juice of Sage, and make pills of it, and hold
them in thy mouth, or else take Nutmegs, Indian Nuts, Cloves, Pieretrum, Assa
foetida, of each one scrup. Laudanum, Dragagant, of each one drag. make them
into pills with wine, and hold them in thy mouth. So also may you hold a piece
of a Nutmeg in the mouth, and chew it. Treacle, Mithridate, and such like
confections are commended in this infirmity. The patient must also speak much
and plainly.

But if it come with the infection of any other sinews, then it is to be cured
by the means that are prescribed in the Palsy.

But if it proceed of an Ague, with a contracture of the tongue, then must you
irrigate the patients neck and shoulders from on high with warm water, for
that moisteneth and warmeth the same place and the tongue also: afterward
anoint it with oil of Olives.

How to moisten the tongue.
IF then a great drith of the tongue happen with it (as it commonly befalls
in hot Feauers) then is the patient to hold in his mouth oil of Roses or of
Violets; but especially ought that to be observed which has been said before
in the loss of the taste, where it begins thus: Afterward he is to hold in
his mouth, etc.

For this use serve also these things, to wit, preserved black Cherries,
preserved Raspises, and whatsoever else is made of them, preserved Peaches,
Barberries and their sirupe, the preserved red Cherries with their sirupe, and
such like more, sirupe of Mulberies, of Nutshels, conserve of Roses, conserve of
water Lillies, and many more such like, as is showed in hot diseases and
pestilentiall Fevers.

Diatragacanthum frigidum is very good in this and in all other hot diseases
whatsoever.

For this purpose serves also Sugarcandie, the muscilage of Fleawoort, of
Quince kernels, and to wash the mouth often with warm water, Vinegar, and
Rosewater.

If there be any tumor with it, then use the Iulep of Violets, and of Roses,
dried Prunes, dried Cheries, juice of Licorice, sour Dates, Manna, or which of
them you please: but if the tongue were fast some where, then is it to be loosed
with some instrument, and afterward to bestrew the place with Ginger and
Allume.

Lastly, if a piece of flesh should grow under the tongue, as if it were a
frogge, then does the same proceed of a gross and tough humor: when the
tongue is lifted up, then may you see it very red, and it is otherwhiles little
or big like unto a little tongue. It is also sometimes round like a Hasell nut,
and bigger, whereby both the speech and eating is hindered. Here must the
patient first be purged, let blood under the tongue, and observe a good diet, as
in any other impostume of the head, that might also proceed of fleagm.
Afterward is the frogge to be rubbed with Salarmoniack, Gals, Salgemmae, or
parched salt: or else you may prepare this for it. Take Pieretrum, Ginger, of
each two drag. Salarmoniack, Salgemmae, of each a drag. and a half, Marioram,
Calmus, Ireos, Daffodils, Mastick, of each half a dragm, make a powder of
them. Of this powder may you take one part, and with the white of an egg make
it into Trocisces, and when thou will use them, dissolve them in Aqua vitae,
and so anoint the frogge under the tongue with it.

With this water following may you also wash the mouth very often. Take
Marioram, Mints. Penniroyall. Nettle roots, of each one M. Pi^retrum two drag.
boil them together in a pint and a half of water, till the third part remain.

But if this malady do once inueterate and wax old, then it is to be cured
with those things that are described hereafter in bleeding of the gums; amongst
which this following is rehearsed: Take Sugar, Allume, Verdigrease, of each a
like much, mix them with honey, and rub it therewith.

Item, if this infirmity wax too big, then it is to be cut, taken away and
healed, as all other sores of the mouth. Some do counsel to burn it, which is
uncertain in this place: but this is to be observed, if this frog be hard and
black, then it is doubtless the true Canker, which is altogether incurable.

For the Alcola, or hardness and cliffes in the tongue.
THis Alcola of the tongue proceeds of the foresaid hot and dry causes,
when the tongue waxes black, dry, hard and full of cliffes. For this must the
patient first be purged with this purgation following.

Take Rubarbe three drag. Spica half a drag. Squinant one scrup. of the
decoction of fruits, called at the Apothecaries Decoctio fructuum, which shall
hereafter be described, eighteen ounces; let them infuse in this decoction a
whole night, in the morning press it out, take four ounces of the Colature,
sirupe of Pomegranates one ounce, sirupe of Limons half an ounce, temper them
together, and so take it three mornings together.

If these potions have not sufficiently purged (for they be very gentle) then
take of these pills, Cochiae, Foetidae, Aureae, of each one scrup. and of them
all one dragme; make seven pills of it, gargarise after that purging with
warm Goats milk, and eat five or six Cherries after it.

And because wine is very hurtful in such a heat, this water following shall
be very meet for it. Take half a handful of Barley, thirty dry Prunes,
Barberies, Cinnamome, of each half an ounce; boil them in four pintes of
water until the fourth part be consumed. In like manner may you use this
potion for to cool: Take the juice of Quinces one ounce and a half, Rob de
Berberis half an ounce, water of Purslaine three ounces, temper them together.

For this purpose serves also whatsoever has been written in the first. of
the corruption of the mouth, but especially the gargarismes.

Of the tumor and swelling of the Tongue.
THis is caused of blood, or of phlegm that falls down out of the head. It
happens sometimes that the tongue does so swell, that it lies before in the
mouth, whereby the spetting and all other her actions are hindered. In this you
are to purge the head with the foresaid pills.

If it then proceed of cold phlegm, which is discerned, that the tongue or face
are always white, and the mouth always full of moisture, then is the tongue to
be rubbed so long with the juice of Onions, of Citrons, sirupe of Raspes, or
with sower Pomegranate wine, until all the spettle and slime be gone away: for
these foresaid things do separate the matter.

Item, take Ireos, white Mustard seed, Pieretrum and such like, all of them,
or each a part, boil them, and use it in the washing of the tongue.

Item, boil Dates, Raisins and Figs, of each a like much in sweet wine.

This gargarisme is also good being used oftentimes. Take Fenegreeke, Raisins,
Fennel seed, Lilly roots, and Figs, of each half an ounce, boil them
together in a quart of water, until the third part be wasted, afterward
temper three ounces of honey of Roses amongst it.

Item, take Squils and Oxymel three ounces, mix them with the decoction of
Beuercod. Or boil Rue, Cypers roots and Pepper together, or which you please,
in vinegar.

But if heat be cause of this tumor, that will be perceived by the redness
and swelling up of the face and tongue, without any spettle, and with sweetness
of the mouth: for this you shall presently open the head vein, then under the
tongue; for this asswageth the pain, and cools the blood.

If it be needful, then purge with the Electuarie de Succo Rosarum, sirupe of
Roses, or with Cassia, fasten boxing cups in the neck, that the affiuent
matter might somewhat be withdrawn. Also the patient is to gargarize with sower
and astringent remedies, as with the juice or sirupe of Raspes and of Limons:
the juice of Lettice is also good for it, likewise the juice or wine of
Pomegranates.

Of the impostume of the Tongue.
THe tongue does otherwhiles impostumate through abundance of blood, which is
known by the redness, the tumor, the sweetness in the mouth, and by the
puffing up of the face with redness.

If it proceed of Cholera, then it is perceived by the great burning, vehement
pain, and bitterness of the mouth.

Or if it be caused of phlegm, that may be seen by the palenesse, by the small
store of pain, and much spettle, without any great swelling being spread over
the whole tongue.

When this infirmity comes of Melancholy, then grows the tongue hard, ash
colored, and with small pain.

But if it proceed of heat, then purge the patient as has been showed in the
tumor of the tongue and Alcola: and in the beginning make gargarismes of cold
things, as of Gourds, Shepherds purse, Purslaine, Endive, and especially of
Lettice, Milk, Rose water, or the decoction of Roses, and rub the tongue with a
Peach, which is very profitable for this purpose. But if by these means it do
nothing amend, then use oftentimes honey, milk, and the decoction of Lilly
roots and Raisins, Fenegreeke, and of Fennel seed.

For his meat he may use Colewoorts, Orage dressed with oil of Almonds or of
Olives, Figs, Raisins, and Lineseede chewed and spet out again with the slime.

When this tumor or impostume is broken up, then take any one of these things
following, to wit, Butchers broom, Barberies, Myrtle seed, of each half an
ounce, Agrimonie one handful, boil them in a pint of water until the half,
then add Meade or honey unto it two ounces, and gargarize therewith often. It
preuenteth great harm that might ensue. Old wine is also very good, being held
in the mouth, and spet out again.

But if it proceed of cold, then purge the patient with pills Cochiae, or with
the confection Diaturbith, and make this gargarisme following for him. Take
Fenegreeke, Lilly roots, and Fennel seeds, of each one ounce, ten Figs,
Currants one ounce and a half, Bay berries one ounce; boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water: let him hold this in his mouth, and wash his mouth with it
very often. It eases the pain and ripeneth all impostumes of the mouth and
throat, especially if you add honey unto it.

This impostume is accounted the middlemost thing between the ulcers of the
mouth and the Squinancie: for they do agree together both in their causes and
their remedies, as has bin showed before in the first.

Of the loss of speech.
But if of any of the foresaid causes the speech is hindered or taken away, and
yet the voice remain, and that the patient could not utter his mind, then is
he to take twice a week one drag. and a half of Hiera logodion, with the
decoction of Rosemarie.

A Gargarisme.
TAke a drag. of Coloquint, Hearts tongue two dragmes, Ginger, Galingall, Costus
roots, Greines, of each half a drag. boil them together in a pint and a
half of water even to the half; wring it out hard, and temper with it Oxymel
of Squils six ounces, and let it boil a while longer: afterward hold it
warm in thy mouth, and wash thy mouth therewith. This will not deceive thee.

Take Mithridate or Treacle two drag. water of Sage, of Marioram gentle, and
Rosemarie,, of each three ounces, or which of them you can come by; wash thy
mouth with it in the morning and at night, and spet it forth again: and thus
much for the tongue.

Of the Gums and Mandibles.. 7.
IT is sufficiently known that children are borne with the Gums and Mandibles,
whence first the teeth do grow: wherefore it is first needful to write of the
root, and then of the tree. These Mandibles have their situation one near to
the other, called by the Latinists Praesepioliae, that is, little mangers, for
so in the old time were the mangers of beasts wont to be parted. In them are
the teeth fastened, with veins and sinews at the bottom.

These Mandibles or Gums are subject unto many infirmities, as impostumes,
putrifactions, corrosions, aquefactions, bleeding, increase and decrease of the
Gums, the which are caused of the rheumes in the head, or else of vapors
ascending out of the stomach: of the which, and first of all of the impostume,
now shall be spoken.

Of the impostumation of the Gums.
IF with this impostumation be great pain admixed, so that the impostumated
Gums be red, then it is caused of heat. In this case is the head to be purged
with water wherein Prunes have been decocted, and Rubarbe or Manna mixed with
it, and afterward to use mild Clisters: also to open the head vein, and to be
let blood under the tongue: lastly, to fasten boxing cups to the shoulders, and
to hold this following in the mouth a good while. Take honey of Roses one ounce
and a half, Vinegar half an ounce: when you spet it out you are to take in
fresh again. If then any other sores do happen unto them, they are to be opened
with a fleame, and then to wash it thrice a day with water wherein Allume,
Myrrh, or Salt is sodden.

Item, take half a pint of the water of Knotgrasse, Allume half an ounce;
dissolve it in the water, wash the teeth and Gums with it: Afterward take
Pomegranate pills beaten, dippe a cloth in them, and rub them gently with it.
In like manner you may also find in the first. those things that are very meet
for this purpose, because both these infirmities do proceed of one cause.

Item, wash the mouth often with vinegar and Allume; afterward with the wine
of Pomegranates with a little Allume dissolved in it. Look the description of
the sirupe of Mulberries in the fourth. before.

Item rub thy gums in the mornings with the unguent of Egypt, but swallow
none of it down: and gargarise often with honey of Roses and sirupe of
Mulberies, of each a like much, mingled with the water of Plantaine.

For all impostumes and corruptions of the gums or teeth, which procure a
stinking breath, and if there be much blood and moisture with it, then is the
party to be purged according to his ability with yellow Mirobalans and sower
Dates, then to open the vein of the head, and to apply a great boxing cup in
the neck, to rub the gums until they bleed, and to wash the mouth with this
water following.

Take blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Acorne cups, and Roses, of each half
an ounce, Stauesacre two dragms, boil them very well together. This following
is to be used for to heal and to dry it: Take Roses, Cypers nuts, Gals, and
burnt Allume, of each a like much; boil them together in Vinegar and water, ad
unto this decoction as much honey as you please. After the use of this
Gargarisme strew this powder upon the sores: Take burnt Allume two dragmes,
blossoms of Pomegranates, plume Allume, Myrtle seeds, of each one dragme and a
half, burnt Hearts horn one dragme, mix them well together. He is also often
times to be purged with the foresaid capital pills Cochiae.

Of the bleeding of the Gums.
THis may happen of some outward accide^t, as of blows, falls, and such like,
the which must be known of the patient. The inward causes are either heat or
cold of a sharp matter falling down out of the head, corroding the gums and
the sinews of the teeth, and making them to impostumate: in so much that if it
once begin to inueterate, it soon changes into the Canker, whereby all the
teeth fall out. But if this blood be thin and subtle, then are these four
things following to be put in practice. First, to take away the corrupted gums:
Secondly, to mundifie and cleanse that which is infected: Thirdly, after
mundification, to astringe or draw together and heal them: Fourthly and
lastly, to confirm and strengthen the gums and jaws, that the matter may not
have recourse thither again.

First there are many kind of powders in such vehemency used, that the venime
Orpiment is added thereto: but my counsel is to omit it, and to use this
following in stead thereof: Take roots of Daffodils and Pomegranate pills of
each a like much, make them into powder and rub thy gums therewith, and an
hour after wash thy mouth with warm wine or vinegar.

Secondly, you may make this decoction following: Take Olive leaves one M. and
a half, Pieretrum half an ounce, Ginger, Masticke, Ireos, of each one dragme.
Honey two ounces, boil them together in a pint of water to the half, wash thy
mouth therewith.

This following is very good for all infections of the gums and jaws. Take
honey of Roses three ounces, warm water one ounce, dip a cloth in them and rub
the gums with it, and an hour after wash thy mouth with Wine or water wherein
dried Roses have been decocted.

In like manner this following mundifieth very well: Take water of Cammomill
one ounce, honey of Roses three dragmes, temper them together and wet the place
infected with it: afterward wash thy mouth with wine wherein dried Roses have
been decocted.

Thirdly, they are to be cured with this powder: Take Frankincense, Aloes,
Sarcocolla, and Dragons blood, of each one dragme: beat them small, and strew
them in the gums.

Item, take Laudanum, Masticke, Frankincense, and Coral, of each a like much;
make them into fine powder, and apply it to the place infected: it confirms,
hardneth and cleanses the gums and jaws: and when the sore is well mundified,
then it does also incarnate and engender flesh.

Fourthly, this following is highly commended. Take Cypers leaves, or nuts,
half an ounce, Well water a pint, boil it until the half part remain, dip
a cloth in it and apply it to the grief: this does not only confirm and
strengthen the gums, but defends them also from all bad rheumes.

Another.
TAke blossoms of the Pomegranate tree, Allume, Roses, Hounds tongue, Acorne
cups, and Plantaine, of each a like quantity, boil them all in wine and wash
thy mouth therewith: it strengthens the gummes and teeth, and hinders the
bleeding.

Item, boil Gals, Olive leaves, Lentils, Mugwoort, and Pomegranate pills, of
each a like much in water, and wash thy mouth with it.

Another that is stronger.
TAke Pieretrum, Lilly roots, of each one drag. the outward ^ind of Gals, and
blossoms of the Pomegranate tree, of each two drag. beat them small, and rub
the gummes therewith. Take the same ingredience, but in greater quantity, boil
them in red Wine, and add the fourth part of vinegar unto it; with this thou
shall wash thy mouth.

By all these former things is easily to be seen, that many remedies there be
for the former infection of the teeth and gummes, which are also very good for
all ulcers and corruption of the gummes.

Of the outward applications.
FOr both the former infirmities, and for all pain and griefs of the gummes,
these things following are very good, which may be outwardly applied. Take
Linseede oil, Cammomill beaten, Hollihocke roots, meal of Fenegreeke,
Butter, of each half an ounce, oil of Dill or of Cammomill four ounces, this
asswageth the pain, maturateth and digesteth.

Item, sheep wool unwashed, wet it in the juice of Roses, of Violets, or of
Willow leaves: Or make a bag the breadth of ones hand full of dried Roses,
decoct it in vinegar and water, wring it out hard, and then apply it outwardly.

Take cold water only or vinegar mixed with Rose water or wine of
Pomegranates, and wash the mouth therewith.

Item, use the juice of cold herbs, as of Nightshade, of the bigger and lesser
Housleeke, of Plantaine, of Purslaine, or which of them you can get.

For this purpose serves all the wine wherein Gals have been decocted.

If then neither the pain nor bleeding will cease, then is the same place to
be opened with a Lancet, or Horsleaches to be fastened unto it.

But if the gummes be not apt to bleed, not exulcerated nor painful, nor the
face any thing swollen, and that the patient be not well after meat, but when
he has eaten meats cold by nature, then may you easily guess, that this
infirmity proceeds of a cold phlegm. Wherefore every such patient is to be
purged with Pil. Cochiae, Hiera Picra, exacuated with a little of the trocisces
of Coloquint, or Diaturbith. Afterward he is to wash his mouth with astringent
decoctions, as of the blossoms and pills of Pomegranats, Akorne cups, Allume,
Salt, juice of Rue, and such like. Also for a change he may gargarize with the
decoction of Figs, Fennel seeds, and seeds of Lillies.

The roots of the blew Flower deluce provoke the gummes to bleed much,
whereby the pain is assuaged. The decoction of Agrimonie tempered with Allume
is approved to be very meet. Of this matter look into the first. where you
shall find many good remedies for this purpose.

Of the Fistula in the gummes.
WHat a bad accident this Fistula is shall be showed in the fifth part, for it
appears in this place, as in all other places with salt and sharp
deflurions: you shall cure them with those remedies that have been described
before in the infections of the tongue, and putrefaction of the gummes, so that
at this present time I purpose not to write much of it. Take Gals one ounce,
Myrrh half an ounce, make them into powder, and strew it on the sore. Wash
thy mouth often with Vinegar of Squils, or take Gals, Roses, Lentils, Acorne
cups, Bedegar blossoms, and peeles of Pomegranates, of each a like much, boil
them all in water, if it proceed of a hot cause: but if of a cold, then boil
them in wine.

If the Fistula be deep, and the gums corroded, then take the blossoms of
Pomegranates, plume Allume, of each a like quantity, make them into powder,
strew it once in three hours upon the sore. For this serve also the blossoms
of Pomgranates boiled in Vinegar and Honey, and the mouth washed with the
decoction. Amongst diverse other dentifrices, this that follows is the safest.
Take calcined Allume, Plume Allume, blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Ireos,
Pieretrum, Sumach, Barbaries, Gals, Acorne cups and Dragon blood, of each a
like much, make a powder of them. This powder may also be tempered with vinegar
and hon^ and wash the mouth therewith, it is very good for all manner of
exulcerations of the mouth.

When the Fistula is mundified to the bottom, then are you to use incarnatiues.

Others do commend the use of actual and potentiall cauteries, but they are
nothing commendable but at the last need, and in the greatest extremity.

Of the wasting away and consumption of the Gums.
TAke Cinnamome one ounce, Frankincense, Roses, of each two drag. Dragon blood,
three drag. bestrew the gums therewith very often.

Take Myrrh, Masticke, shells of pine apples, Date stones, burnt Hearts horn
and Iuorie blossoms of Pomegranats, Roses, Dragon blood, of each a like much,
use it as before: it confirms the teeth.

Take Pease meal, make it into little cakes with honey, and dry them until
you can powder them again, take of this two dragmes, Dragon blood,
Frankincense, Masticke, of each two drag. Aristologie and Ireos, of each one
drag. rub the gums therewith.

Of the mollification of the Gums.
FOr this infirmity are all those remedies very meet, that shall be
prescribed for the wagging or looseness of the teeth.

For a conclusion.
ALthough the gums were altogether corrupted and black, yea although all the
teeth were loose, yet these remedies following have done wonderful much good.
Take Worm-eaten Gals, Sumach, Myrtle seeds, Acorne cups, and Plantaine seed,
of each one drag. white Vitrioll, plume Allume, of each one drag. and a half,
yellow seeds of Roses, and refuse of Cloves, of each two drag. and a half,
beat them all grossly, and let it boil in a sufficient quantity of water:
when it has sodden a good while, then ad forty young buds of the Mulbery tree,
and so let them sees until the half part remain. Wash thy mouth often with
this decoction, afterward thou may strew this powder following upon thy
gums: Take Mastick, Sandaraca, juice of Sloes, Hippocystis, of each one scrup.
prepared Tu^ia one drag. white Vitrioll four scrup. make them into powder.

Of the Teeth.. 8.
MAn has for the most part 32. teeth, although some there be that have but 28.
or 30. and they are differing in form. First, there are four above and as
many beneath, that are sharp and broad, therewith to cut and divide the meat
as it were with a knife, for the which cause they are called of the Latinists
Incisores, they have but one root only.

Afterward there are on each side of the former four more above and below,
which are broad above and thin below, and for that they are called by the
Grecians and Latinists Dog teeth, because they be most like unto the teeth of
Dogs: they have but one long root, and are made to break that which the
former have as yet not sufficiently broken.

Thirdly, there are above and beneath on both sides commonly twenty teeth,
albeit that some have but sixteen, and others but six on each side, which are
called in Latin Molares, that is, grinding or cheek teeth. Their office is to
grind and chew whatsoever the former teeth have not as yet sufficiently broken
and chewed. Those that are in the uppermost mandible, are fastened unto three
roots, the lowermost only unto two: although that sometimes it befalls,
that the two former of them have three roots.

The Philosophers do write, that the foremost teeth are engendered of a pure and
superfluous moisture of the scull; the middlemost of a reasonable good humor;
and the very hindermost of a gross humiditie of the foresaid scull.

The pains and griefs of the teeth are diverse, insomuch that amongst the
Physicians there are accounted twelve or thirteen kinds of them of the which
we shall speak hereafter. These infirmities have all of them sundry causes, to
wit, outward and inward: which difference we purpose also to observe.

Of the pain in the teeth through outward causes.
THis is caused through the continual use of sower and astringent things, as
unripe fruits, through much picking of them with pins, and other stinking
things that remain in them* also through falls, blows and thrusts, sharp
wind, too hot or too cold meats, but especially of those that be dressed with
honey, which causes must be known and inquired of the patient, thereby to order
and govern himself.

Of the pain in the teeth through inward causes.
THis kind of toothach is of diverse sorts, and it has also sundry causes.
First, if it proceed out of the head or brain, then is the patient not without
some pain in the head: out of which there falls continually great store of
slime. If this pain be caused of the mandibles and teeth, that does manifestly
appear. But if one doubt which tooth might first have provoked this pain, then
let the patient bite somewhat between his teeth, first between two, then
between two more, and so from tooth to tooth until you come to the tooth it
self where the pain rests. By this means also you may know whether the
pain be in the sinews or no, because the other teeth be nothing painful. If
it proceed from the stomach, then is there pain felt in the same, after which
does ensue vomiting, and especially of a sower and stinking matter. If it be
procured by the blood, then may it be known by the heat and redness. If of
Cholera, then is the pain with pricking and shooting. That which comes of
Melancholy, is known by the great and hard swellings. Of Phlegma, by the
whiteness of the face, and by the small pain. If it be caused of many humors,
then is the patient heavy headed, with much spettle in the mouth. The pain
that proceeds of drought, is thereby discerned: if of windiness, then shall
you perceive much beating and stirring with it. Wherefore of these inward
means, to wit, of the four humors may this impediment be caused. The teeth
grow hollow and full of holes, they rot, the worms do spoil them, and the
sinews are weakened, that at the last they fall away, and are so that they may
easily be drawn out. How to prevent and remedy the same, shall be showed
hereafter.

How to procure teeth in children without pain.
NOt without reason are we to bethink our selves how to ease the young and
tender babes of that pain and grief which they do suffer in breeding their
teeth, especially if the pain continue long, as it often has bin seen, that
it has continued three or four years.

This is for the most part caused of the debility of their nature, or of
worms, which do consume the moisture, whereby the teeth should grow.

When this delay in teeth is caused through the debility and weakness of
nature, then must the child be fed with roasted birds, bread dipped in brothe of
flesh, and such like, according to the age of the child. They have also a great
laske commonly with it, which must be staid. The mandibles where the teeth
appear are to be rubbed softly: and amongst all other remedies that may be
invented for this purpose, the brains of a Hare dressed with the milk of a
Bitch are the best. If you cannot get them, then take butter, oil of Lillies,
the fat of Hens or of other birds, each by it self, or mixed all together.

And because that in these remedies following there be many sharp ingredients,
as Orpiment, Neesing wort, Coperas, Stauesacre, Southernwood, Henbane, Opium
and such like more (of which we will make mention but little) which are in no
wise to be taken down: wherefore here we will admonish and show how they ought
in the greatest need with the most safety to be used.

First, they are to be applied only to the dolorous and painful tooth with a
piece of Wax covered about, to the end it should touch but only the place
aggreeued. Otherwise they might also harm the good and sound teeth. The
patient must also hold his mouth open, and downwards, that the spettle and
slime might run out; neither are they to be applied too hot or too cold.

If this pain proceed of cold rheumes, as also of the use of cold meats, then
put the patient into a warm place, cover his head with warm clothes until he
feel the warmth apparently. Afterward anoint his head with the oil of
Cammomill, of Rue, of Behen, of Beuercod, and of Spica, or in place of them
with Aqua vitae three days together. A hard yolke of an egg applied to the
tooth is also very good, and afterward is the tooth to be washed with warm
wine: Or take vinegar, wherein Pieretrum, white Mints, and Marioram has been
decocted.

Item take Pieretrum, white Mustard seed, pepper, Borras and Ginger, of each a
like much, make a powder of them, and rub the teeth therewith; or strew it on a
little cotton, and apply it to the very root of the tooth.

But before you use any other kind of remedy, take heed you purge the head very
well, that you draw not down more humors out of it unto the teeth, the which may
be effected through the pills or potions which every where are sufficiently
described. After purging you may use any one of these things following: Take
Mastick one ounce, Sage a M. beat and boil them in eight ounces of wine or
vinegar until the half remain, wash thy mouth therewith.

Item take good white wine six ounces, temper half an ounce of Sandaraca with
it, boil them together until one quarter of it be wasted, and hold it in thy
mouth warm, and if you add one drag. of Philonium Romanum, then will it be so
much the stronger. Or take of the foresaid Philonium two drag. red wine four
ounces, and hold it lukewarm in thy mouth. Gals decocted in vinegar are also
very good for this purpose. In like manner Betony or Plantaine decocted in
vinegar or water, and used warm. Pellitory of Spain bound up in a cloth and
chewed in the mouth, draws out much slime.

Take Assa foetida, and Frankincense, of each a like quantity, hold it on the
painful tooth. The decoction of Alehoofe is also very good for it. Likewise the
conserve of Gilliflowers, of Lauander, of Spikenard: Rosemary wine, Sage wine.
Item take the roots of Sperage, boil them in water, and wash thy mouth often
therewith. Others do commend Garlic, Ginger, Agrimony, each by it self, or
mixed together, and so applied to the tooth. Also the water of Marioram gentle
should be very good for this use. In like sort M. Tristrams water which is
described in the fifth chapter and first.

Item take white and long pepper, Cucubes, Saxifrage, the bark of the Mulberry
tree, Caper roots, and roots of Southernwood, of each a like much, boil them
according to the quality of the pain in water, wine, or vinegar tempered
together, or each by it self: it is very good, and confirms the gums.

Pepper, Pellitory of Spain, roots of Diptamer, and Licebane chewed together,
or each by it self, are commonly very commodious for the toothach.

These remedies following are more cooling.
TAke a little branch of a Cherry tree, scrape off the outmost rind, take the
yellow rind and boil it in wine, take of this decoction in thy mouth as warm
as thou can suffer it.

In like manner if the rheum fall into the teeth, then boil Oken leaves in
wine, and hold it often in the mouth: it draws out the slime very well. The
water that issues out of a Vine being cut, is also very good for the toothach,
if it be held in the mouth.

Yet more remedies that are approved.
TAke eight ounces of wine, boil it in half an ounce of Esula, wash thy teeth
therewith three times in a month, it preserves the teeth from pain, but it
is very violent and dangerous to be used: but this that follows is safer and
better.

Take Roses and boil them in milk, hold them a good while in thy mouth, and
lay the leaves to thy teeth. Take Camfere the bigness of a pease, boil it in
two ounces of vinegar, and hold it in thy mouth, it is very good for all manner
of pain in the teeth. Item take of a Hearts horn, to wit, that which has bin
cast off in March, cut it into small pieces and boil it in well water, take
the decoction into thy mouth warm, repeat it three or four times, and after
the use of it (as many men suppose) the pain should not return again:
whosoever shall approve it and find it true, may commend and love the
experiment. Others do counsel to take of the skin of a Snake that has bin
cast off by her, one drag. and to boil it in three ounces of vinegar unto the
half, and to take it into the mouth: it should also be an approved remedy. Oil
of Roses lukewarm only held in the mouth asswageth the pain. Boil a Frog in
water and vinegar, until the flesh part from the bones, and wash the teeth
therewith. The juice of Beetes dropped into the contrary ear of the pain, is
also counseled of some men: likewise of Cichory, of Daffodils, and of earth
worms.

But if this toothach proceed of a hot cause, then hold any of these things
following warm in thy mouth, as the oil of Willow leaves, oil of Poppy
heads, and oil of Roses (as has bin said before.) The juice of Sorrel slaketh
the heat greatly. You may also anoint the place with the juice of Nightshade,
of Purslaine, of Lettice, of Endive. Item boil the roots of Nettles and Sage
in wine. Henbane seed and Opium mixed with oil of Roses, do make the tooth
insensible.

If Cholera be admixed, then is the patient to be purged with the Electuary of
Succo Rosarum, with Cassia, sower Dates, or yellow Mirobalans.

If it be caused of overmuch blood, then is the head vein, the vein in the
lips, and that under the tongue to be opened, or the gums made to bleed, and
boxing cups to be applied behind in the neck.

What else may be used for the pain in the teeth.
Above in the twelft chapter and first. have I described a good powder, which
begins, Take Seen leaves, etc. which is also very commodious for this
purpose. Item take Myrrh two drag. Frankincense half a drag. Mastick one
drag. and a half, Cuttle bone, and red Coral, of each 15. grains, Argoyle
two drag. Glass small powdered five drag. Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom, Cloves,
Sarcocolla, of each half a drag. make them into powder: it confirms and
whiteneth the teeth, and it cures the sore gums being rubbed therewith.

Item take Pellitory of Spain, Licebane, of each a like much, beat them and
temper them with a little white Wax, and cover the tooth therewith of all sides.

A wonderful remedy. Take the liver of a green Euet, and the fruit of
Tamariske, roots of wild Cucumbers, and Propolis, which is taken out of the
hole of ye Bee-hiues, of each a like quantity. This may you use for all manner
of toothach, either in washing with it, or applying it to the tooth, or in
using it outwardly.

Of the outward applications.
PArched Millet applied unto it is very good. Item take Mallows, fry them in
butter until they be soft, and so lay it outwardly unto the pain. Item toast
a slice of bread upon hot coals, and apply it to the cheek where the pain
is, and renewing it still being cold with another that is hot; do this eight or
ten times together: for when the pain is departing then it is most grievous,
wherefore leave it not off.

But if the foresaid means do not ease the pain, then make this composition:
Take Beuercod, Pepper, Ginger, red Storax, Opium, of each half a scrup. this
being beaten, temper it with honey of Roses, and put the quantity of a Hemp seed
unto the root of thy tooth.

Item take Opium the bigness of an Hemp seed, warm it in thy hand until it be
soft, and apply it to the painful tooth, it asswageth the pain.

If you will forbear the Opium, then use any of these juices following, to
wit, juice of Southernwood, of Henbane, of Poppy, or to use the Philonium
Romanum, as has been before said: yet are you always to add unto them a
little saffron, Cassia wood, or Cammomils, to mitigate their great cold. For
this purpose serves also Mithridate either inwardly or outwardly adhibited,
for it is very good for all infirmities of the teeth.

It is also advised that the patient abstain from meat as long as is
possible, and that he use a dry bath to sweat, and meetly exercise. But if
the pain be not mitigated by all these means, then is the root of the tooth
to be seared with a hot iron, or to be drawn out altogether.

Of the toothache in the Pox.
Mix the juice of Wormwood with the white of an egg, and apply it to the
pain. For the same use serves the decoction Guaiac. holden in the mouth
warm; and all those things that have been mentioned before.

Of hollow and rotten teeth.
THe cause why these teeth wax hollow and rotten, is some stinking matter
adjacent unto the tooth, the which does putrify the same. To prevent this
impediment, is the putrefaction to be taken away; which has bin showed before,
and shall more largely be declared hereafter.

You shall in no wise omit to pick and cleanse your teeth after meals with a
toothpicker, and afterward to wash thy mouth with wine. The remedies that
hinder the putrefaction of the teeth are these, namely Lycium, Frankincense,
Mints, Myrtle seeds, Spica, Gallia muscata, Cypres roots, Masticke, Gals,
Turpentine, Pepper, Campher, and seeds of Nigella, if there be heat with it.
This water following should also prevent this putrefaction, or (if it were once
entered) take it away, and alay the pain. Take of the middle rind of the
Mulberry tree one ounce and a half, of the best Ginger one ounce, boil them in
strong vinegar unto the half, and wash thy mouth therewith in the morning.

Item take the ashes of Rosemary, bind them in a cloth, and rub thy black and
putrified teeth therewithal. Take Aristology beaten, temper it with honey, and
use it as before. Take the water of wild three leafed grass, mix as much
Allume and Honey unto it as thou please, and wash thy rotten teeth with it.

Or take the inward part of gals, and as much Pellitory of Spain, beat them
to powder, and add some Stauesacre unto it, and lay somewhat of it on the
rotten teeth.

Item Borras and Stauesacre decocted together, or each by it self. This remedy
following is no less commended than any of the former: Take Pellitory of
Spain one drag. Ammoniacum and Opium of each one drag. melt the gum, and mix
the rest being beaten small with it: thrust some part of it into the hollow
tooth, it takes away the sense and feeling of the same.

Item take prepared Coral, blow it through a little quill into the hollownesse
of the tooth, it takes away the pain, and preuenteth the putrefaction of the
tooth. Al these things may be mixed with Treacle, and so used. We have also
showed diverse and sundry remedies before in the 13. Chapter and the 1.. against
the corruption of the mouth, which may also be used very well in this
necessity. Wash thy mouth often with the decoction of Roses, Nep, and a little
Pellitory of Spain.

Thou may also put a little of the spirit of wine into thy hollow tooth: also
any of the waters of life that shall be described in the eight part of this
book. Some men do use Aqua fortis, and it helps much, but you must deal
very warily with it.

These stinking teeth are oftentimes the cause of a stinking breath. If the
tooth be altogether corrupted, then is the only and best remedy to draw it out;
otherwise must one wash the mouth always after meals, with water sodden with
Sal Ammoniac, or otherwhiles with vinegar, wherein has been decocted some
Pellitory of Spain, and Stauesacre. Vinegar of Squils tempered therewith is
also very good. After meals (as has before bin admonished) is the hollownes
of the tooth to be picked and cleansed of al superfluity. If this pain
proceed of cold, then are you to thrust into the hollow tooth a little piece of
Galingal, of ginger, of Cloves, of pepper, frankincense, or of Myrhe. If it be
caused of heat, then use Roses, Sanders, Campher, and such like.

Of the worms that are in the teeth.
IT is evidently known, that if the pain be not overmuch, but that there be
felt a continual stirring and crawling in the teeth, that the same was wont to
proceed of worms: for if (...) wash his mouth with warm water, and hold the
hollownesse of the tooth up toward the Sun, then may the worms apparently
be seen to stir in them. For this thou shall take Aloes one drag. Myrrh
half a drag. make them into little pills with wine, and thrust them into the
hollow tooth. Item boil Coloquint in fair water, and wash thy mouth with it.
Make a fomentation of Henbane seed, or (which is safer) of Onion seeds, or of
Garlic seeds, then wash thy mouth with warm water, and spit it into cold
water, then shall thou see the worms swim in it.

Take Myrrh, Aloes, and red Storax, of each a like much, put a little of it
into thy tooth where the worms are. Or take Calmus bruised, boil it in a
little wine, dip a little cotton in it, and lay it over or in the hollow tooth.

In the greatest extremity make a fume with Opium, Beuercod, and Onion seeds,
or with white Henbane seeds or Mustard seeds, receive this fume through a
tunnel into thy hollow tooth: but at one time take but the quantity of a barley
corn to fumigate withal, and take heed the fume pass only into the
hollownesse of the tooth, although you should get a little pipe of purpose to
put into thy hollow tooth, and to fit it unto the tunnel. If all these means
bring no ease, then let it be drawn out, and bleed thoroughly.

Of grinding of the teeth in children.
THis commonly happens unto children in their sleep, through the debility of
the muscles that stir and move the jaws: this after a while leaves them
altogether. It may also be caused of worms that are in the stomach or
intestines, but then their grinding of their teeth is not all after the same
manner, they rub their noses, etc. Of which thou shall have further direction
in the treatise of the worms, where also shall be showed how this is to be
remedied. But if this infirmity do continue for some other cause, then it is
commonly the messenger of the dead palsy, contracture, or of some other
affection of the sinews: for the which you are to use those things as are
thought meet for every such infirmity. But for this it is especial good to
anoint the cheeks and the whole neck with Vnguentum Martiatum, or the oil
of Beuercod, of Spikenard, of Juniper, of Bays, and such like.

Of the pain in the teeth that comes through the application or use of cold
things.
AL manner of oiles that are warm by nature, applied to the tooth, or holden in
the mouth, do ease this pain. Item take Bay berries, Aristologie, and Allume,
of each a like much, boil them in a sufficient quantity of wine, wash thy
mouth with it warm. If thou will have it stronger, add Hiera Picra unto it.
The same operation has old Treacle mixed with wine, and a good while after not
to take any other moisture in the mouth.

Note also that whatsoever is used or applied to the teeth, may not be hot: for
they are thereby corrupted and spoiled.

Of the standing an edge of the teeth.
THis proceeds otherwhiles of a sharp and astringent slime or rheum, which
falls into the roots of the teeth: or of some other sower matter that lies
in the stomach, and fumeth up into the mouth and teeth, whereby the teeth are
set an edge. But for the most part it is caused of sower and unripe fruits, as
of unripe Grapes, Limons, Raspes, Corna, Sloes, and such other: for this
purpose serves Purslaine with her seed beaten together, and vinegar put upon
it, bitter or sweet Almonds, Licorice, and the juice thereof, Salt water,
milk of an Ass, to wash the mouth with the decoction of Aristology and Bay
leaves. These things may you mix together, use or chew them as you please. To
hold warm wine in the mouth is also very commodious. Or as soon as ever you
do perceive this infirmity, then chew six of the grains of pepper, and
afterward wash thy mouth with warm wine, this helps immediately.

This does also oftentimes proceed of cold, as has been before said. For when
one will cure the toothach with ouercold things, then will thereby the small
heat of them be extinguished, so that they loose their sense and feeling. Now
to cure the same, you must take some kind of oil that is warm by nature, as I
have showed you before, and also bite the yolks of eggs hard roasted, or hot
bread: to anoint the gums with the oil of Spikenard, and afterward to hold
warm wine in the mouth, wherein Cubebs have been sodden. Lastly, to chew
Masticke in the mouth a great while, and then to wash it with warm wine.

How to confirm and fasten Teeth that be loose.
THe cause of this looseness of the teeth may be blows, thrusts, defluxions
that fall out of the head into the teeth, that (as it were) resolve and slacken
their sinews, and loose their roots. It may also proceed of a great drought,
as it happens unto them that recover of a long lingering disease: the corruption
of the mouth and teeth may also cause the same. The signs of this loosenes of
the teeth may be discerned by beholding them diligently.

The cure of this infirmity is comprehended in two principal points: to wit,
in a good regiment or diet, and in the adhibition of good remedies. First, he
must take heed not to bite hard upon any thing, but to use soft meats: also
not to speak much, thereby to eschew the cold air: also he is not to sleep
with an open mouth, neither are the teeth to be touched roughly either with the
fingers or with the tongue.

If this looseness of the teeth do come of blows and such like, with an
evident heat, then is he to use the pills and blossoms of Pomegranates,
Medlars with their leaves and rinds, Services, Quinces, Lycium, Gals, Butchers
broom, burnt Iuory, Roses, Saunders, Ambers, Mirabolan stones, Date stones,
red Costus pills, Hypocistis, sealed earth, fine Bole, burnt Hearts horn, sea
Muscles, and all that may be made and sodden with these things. But if these
proceed of cold, then use Laudanum, Frankincense and her bark, parched Cumin
seed, Cresses seeds, parched Annise seeds, Allume, pitch, Myrrh, parched salt,
Cipres nuts and leaves, Mastick, Sarcocolla, Sandaraca, and all that may be
made with it. Here now do follow some things that confirm and fasten the
teeth, gums and their sinews.

Take garden Mints, fresh Olive leaves (if they may be had) of each an ounce,
Roses, Myrtle seed, Butchers broom seed, wood of the Barberry tree, and the
fruit of the same, of each half an ounce, beat, cut, and boil it in unripe
wine, and hold it in the mouth. Water of Nightshade, of Plantaine, and of
Shepherds purse do fasten the teeth; and if in this water and vinegar together
you boil the blossoms of Pomegranates and Myrtle seeds, then will it be the
better.

In like manner you may boil Gals, Medlars, Lentils and Services, of each half
an ounce. For this purpose serve also Cipres nuts and leaves, Acorne cups and
Seen leaves, al together, or each by it self, decocted in wine, and used as
the former.

Item take Allume, Frankincense, Masticke, Cypres nuts, Rosemary flowers, of
each a like much, boil them together in a sufficient quantity of rain water
and red wine, and wash thy mouth with it very often warm. Item take Hearts
horn, salt and Myrrh, all of them burnt, of each two drag. boil them in
honey, and rub thy gums therewith within and without.

Item take burnt Allume half an ounce, Rose buds half a handful, Bedegar,
red wine one pint, boil them unto the half, take of this being warm into thy
mouth often, and hold it a good while therein, for it is very good.

Another. Take Ireos, Coral and Frankincense, of each half a drag. temper it
with honey of Roses to a confection, anoint the teeth therewith, and in the
morning wash them with wine wherein has been decocted Sage, Rosemary and
Roses, of each a like much. Item take Alum, burnt Hearts horn, Roses, Dragon
blood, Acorne cups, Hyppocistis, blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Gals, of
each a like quantity, boil them in strong red wine or in vinegar, and wash thy
mouth therewith.

Vinegar and Oxymel of Squils are also especial good for this use. To wash the
mouth oftentimes with Rosemary wine, confirms the gums, and fasteneth the
teeth.

Of the falling out and drawing of the teeth.
THe last and extremest means for the toothach, is, that the teeth might
either fall of themselves, or be drawn out. To prevent the falling of them is
impossible to many men, yet are these things following prescribed for it,
amongst which this that follows is very sharp, and yet for all that very
safe and good to be used.

Take the bark of a Mulberry tree, Caper roots, Pieretrum, the bigger and the
lesser Esula, red Orpiment, roots of Coloquint, of each two drag. put as much
vinegar on them as will cover them, let it so rest eight days, and every day
put a little more vinegar unto it, and use it as has been said.

Open the gums round about the tooth as much as is possible with some kind of
instrument, then rub them ten times in one day with the foresaid water; it
makes the tooth loose, and separateth the root. Item open the gums as before,
anoint it with oil wherein Frogs have been decocted: and when the tooth is
very loose, then take it out. You may also do as hereafter follows: Take
Pellitory of Spain, Scammony, white Hellebore, Euphorbium, of each one drag.
beat and steep it in vinegar, open and loose the gums about the tooth, and
rub it often therewith; it is very forcible, and therefore to be the more
regarded.

Item take Nettle seeds, roots of the Mulberry tree, and roots of Celendine, of
each a like quantity, boil them in wine or vinegar: this should have the same
operation with the former, and it is much safer.

Another. Open the gums, and lay bare the root of the tooth, and strew
Euphorbium in it, this will doubtless loose the tooth, that it may easily be
taken out: afterward wash thy mouth with the decoction of Myrrh, for thereby
will the place or hole be drawn together, and all pain abated.

Take the dregs or lees of strong vinegar, and apply it to the tooth many days
together: afterward draw out the tooth. But if it will not stir, then rub
the place with fresh butter or some other grease of birds, and especially with
the brains of a Hare sodden, which have a hidden virtue and operation for this
purpose, as before has been said.

This remedy following applied to the tooth, makes the same to fall out
without any pain. Dissolve two drag. of Ammoniacum in vinegar, temper Henbane
seeds beaten amongst it, and anoint the tooth and the root thereof.

Item take the juice of Esula with meal, make a dow of it, temper it well, and
let it boil a while, and apply it to the tooth.

Of the double tooth.
OTherwhiles two teeth grow unnaturally one before the other, which is not
only unseemly, but hinders also very much; wherefore it must be taken away
with an instrument, and with applications. If you will take it away by
application, then are you first to loose the gums from it, and make a little
ball of Wax, and mix the juice of Esula or of Neesewoort with it. The same
does also the blood of a leaf frogge. Or take the root of a Mulberry tree and
Pellitory, of each half an ounce, wet them in vinegar, and dry them in the Sun
until they be as thick as honey, then temper them with the foresaid juice of
Esula, and anoint the tooth thrice a day with it, and it will easily fall out.
The juice of the roots of Nettles mixed equally with Galbanum should do the
same. In like manner also beaten Fig leaves applied to the tooth.

To make and to keep the teeth clean.
TAke Cuttle bone, white sea Muscles, Spuma maris, Allume, Aristology, parched
Barley, Sulfer vife, Cinnamom, and long pepper, of each a like much, temper it
with honey, and rub the teeth often therewith. Or take Argoile two drag. beat
it small and searce it, wash it with good wine, rub the teeth once a day with
it, and afterward wash thy mouth in the winter with warm, and in summer with
cold wine. This following is highly commended.

Take two drag. of Date stones, red Coral prepared three drag. Lupins, and the
roots of the yellow Flower deluce, of each three drag. beat all that is to be
beaten, and afterward make a confection of it with clarified honey, which must
be so hard that you may make small placents or trocisces of it, dry them in the
shadow: when you will use them, then dissolve one of them in wine or vinegar,
and wash thy teeth therewith every morning, when thou have first rubbed them
well with a cloth, and keep the moisture a good while in thy mouth. Item take
burnt Oister shells, and Sandaraca, of each half an ounce, Ireos two drag.
Aristology, Gentian and Centory, of each half a dragme, use it as before. It is
bitter, but it dries and cleanses much.

Or take one drop of the oil of Vitriol, wet the teeth with it, and rub them
afterward with a course cloth: this takes away all blacknes of the teeth, but
it is very sharp.

The same operation is ascribed unto the oil of Sandaraca Take Allume and
salt, of each a like much, beat it small, distill it in a glass Lembicke, and
rub thy teeth therewith. These last three things are very strong, and my
counsel is to refrain them.

But if one would keep his teeth clean, then are not those things to be used
that do change the natural white color of the teeth into another hew. The
causes are both outward and inward, as the long use of tincting or coloring
meats, and the continual dressing of the same in brass pots. There grows
also a hard substance to the teeth, which may be called Argoile. The inward
causes may be a corrupted and foul stomach, which commonly does color them
green, and especially when one has oftentimes eaten many Toadstooles. The cure
thereof is this: if it be caused of bad meats, then must the patient first of
all be let blood. If the teeth be pestered with Argoile, then is the same to be
taken or scraped off gently. And because this coloring of the teeth does only
proceed of bad humors, they are therefore often to be rubbed with parched salt,
afterward with the dentifrices or powders that make white teeth, (which shall
be described hereafter) and rub them therewith: and last of all with a piece of
Scarlet dipped in honey.

How to make the teeth white.
TAke Venice glass, mole it upon a marble stone until it be very small, add
unto it white pibble stones burnt, in like sort poudered, and Ireos, of each a
like quantity, rub the teeth therewith. Item take burnt Date stones, red Coral
prepared, of each two drag. put them mixed together in a piece of linen cloth,
steep it in wine, and rub the teeth with it: this makes them white and strong.

Another. Take Pumice stone, Cuttle bone, and red brick, eg shells, the white
skin taken out of them, prepared red and white Coral of each half an ounce,
Pellitory of Spain, burnt Alum, of each two drag. and a half, Ireos two drag.
Sandaraea three drag. Mastick, Myrrh, of each half an ounce, make them into
powder, and use it for a dentifrice. Item take Pellitory of Spain, burnt
Alum, of each two drag. and a half, Dragons blood, blossoms of the
Pomegranate tree, of each half a drag. mix them together, and use it as
before. Some do use the Cuttle bone only, others only egshels, they are both
very good and safe.

How to preserve the teeth from all accidents.
MAny Physicians do write, that whosoever will preserve and keep good teeth,
he must observe two things especially: first they do command not to use Milk,
Fish, Radishes, dry Figs, dates, sodden honey, and al other meats that be
dressed therewith. Also to abstain from sower and green apples and pears,
prunes, Services, Medlars, Limons and Garlic, all which by nature are hurtful
unto the teeth. In like manner all things that are very hot or very cold, and
especially the sudden change of hot or cold meats.

A good diet is also very commodious for this purpose; vomiting (as before has
bin showed) is very bad and hurtful: also to bite on very hard things. The
teeth are always to be kept clean, that nothing remain between them and
stink.

The means whereby the teeth are preserved and kept good, are these, to wit,
that you rub them often with the bark of Tamariske, with the peels of
Pomegranates, with the rind of an Ash tree, with blossoms of the Pomegranate
trees, or with red blossoms of the Peach tree: they cleanse the teeth and
confirm the gums. You may also temper white Sugar with Honey, and rub the teeth
therewith: in cold causes with the oil of Behen; in hot causes with the oil
of Roses. Item take the powder of a burnt Hares head, rub the teeth and gummes
therewith: or take Honey and Salt, and burn them to ashes: beaten Lupins are
also very commendable with any addition. Item beat Myrrh and plume Allume
into powder, or temper burnt Allu^^ with vinegar, and wash thy mouth with it:
or else take burnt Hearts horn, seeds or flowers of Tamariske, Cipres roots,
Roses, Spikenard, of each one scrup. Salt half a scrup. make it into powder
and rub thy teeth with it. Myrrh sodden in Wine, and the teeth washed
therewith, fasteneth the teeth, and dries the superfluous humidity of them.
Chew Mastick and rub the teeth and gums with it, it makes them clean and
strong.

The teeth also are always to be kept clean and pure, and not to pick them
with an iron, but with a toothpicker made of Lentiscus, which is the tree
whereof droppeth Mastick, which is much commended for the teeth: remember also
to wash the teeth after every meal.

The fourteenth Chapter. Of the Voice.
WE have concluded before in the 13. Chapter the voice to be the last part or
portion of the mouth, which part is only proper unto all those living
creatures that have lungs: for although fishes and some other beasts seem to
have a voice, yet it is nothing else but a noise; for a true voice proceeds
of an open breast. Also the voices of all females are much less (except the
Cow) then of males. But it is not our intent to speak of any other voices, but
only of the humane voice.

Amongst all living creatures you shall hardly find any thing more changeable
and inconstant than the voice. For behold a man or woman from childhood even to
old age, and you may easily perceive the mutability of it: and which is above
all things to be admired, that those children which speak very timely or young,
begin to go very late. It is also no less marvel that this voice being shut up
and included in something, can nevertheless be understood. As for example, put a
long trunk to another bodies ear, speak in it what and as softly as you
please, yet shall he perfectly understand every word of your saying. Likewise
you may as well know one by the voice as by sight: for it is most sure, that if
you hear one speak and see him not, you shall as well know him by his voice,
as if you saw him and heard him not.

In like manner the voice makes great difference both in words and in names in
diverse speeches over all the world. It breeds great delight by abreuiating,
and extending, by singing high or low, soft or aloud in music. And in this it
exceeds all other parts whatsoever, and is the only means, whereby we may
disclose and make known our hidden thoughts and secret conceits of the mind
unto our friend: also there is nothing else in which we differ from brute
beasts but only in the voice.

We will not speak of any weak voices, which are caused of some long sickness:
for we have already written of them before in the thirteenth chapter. But we
purpose only to treat of those things that do corrupt or spoil the voice, as
of hoarsnesse and such like.

If the voice be decayed of a cold cause, then drink half a drag. of beaten
cubebs at your lying down, sodden in three ounces of the decoction of Guaiacum.

The common people think it a good experiment to steep Horstongue in wine,
and to drink the same.

But the tabulats of Diaireos are especially commended, which are made as
follows: Diaireos.
Take Ireos half an ounce, Penniroyall, Hyssope, Licorice, of each three drag.
Dragagant, bitter Almonds, Pine apple kernels, Cinamom, Ginger, Pepper, of each
one drag. and a half, figs, dates, Currants, of each five scrup. red Styrax
three scrup. and a half; and for every ounce of this powder, take twelve
ounces of Sugar, cut the fruits small, beat all the rest and make tabulats, or
an Electuary of them. This is called at the Apotheries Diaireos Salomonis.

Another. Take Ireos half an ounce, Sugarcandy, and the abouenamed spices
without Sugar two dragmes, Sugar twelve ounces, boil it in the water of Hyssop
until it be thick, then make tabulats of it. Both these kinds of Diaireos are
good for the cough, proceeding of a cold rheum, and for a wheesing breath.

Of Hoarsnesse.. 1.
THis hoarsnesse proceeds of many and sundry causes, but especially of cold
and sharp humors that fall out of the head into the throat, and there make it
dry, whereof shall be spoken at large when we shall speak of the infirmities
of the throat: we will now only show what is convenient for the roughness and
hoarsnesse of the same; for the which Sugarcandy holden in the mouth very often
is very commodious: also the confectio^ Diatragacanthum, whereof there be two
sorts, to wit, the hot and the cold, which may be made as hereafter follows.

The cold Electuary of Diatragacanthum.
TAke white Dragagant one ounce, gum Arabeck five drag. Starch two drag.
Licorice, peeled Melon seeds, Gourds seeds, Cucumber and Pompeon seeds, of each
one drag. Campher five grains, sugar pennets one ounce and a half, beat them
to powder. If thou will make tabulats of it, then take of this powder one
ounce, of the best Sugar twelve ounces, boil it in water of Violets as it
behooves. This confection is also very good for all infections of the lights,
and of the breast, which do proceed of heat and drouth, and especialy for them
that are declining to a consumption, and them that have a dry cough does it
much help.

The hot confection of Diatragacanthum.
TAke Dragagant, Hyssop, of each two ounces, pine apple kernels, sweet Almonds,
and Linseed, of each three drag. Fenegreeke, Cinnamom, of each two drag. juice
of Licorice, Ginger, of each one drag. make it into an electuary or confection
as before. This is very good for them that have a tough and slimy cough, and
that cannot get up any thing: also for all them that have a wheesing and short
breath, and that are subject to a consumption.

Take Iuiubes, boil them in water, steep Cotton seeds in it, and hold them in
thy mouth a long time: it has a marvelous operation in all hoarsnesse,
drought, and roughness of the throat.

Amongst all other things that have bin found good by experience, the tabulats
of Diatragacanth are much conmended: wherefore every night when you go to bed
shall you dissolve one of them in sweet wine, adding half a scruple of Saffron
unto it, and drink them all together; this has cured many men of an
inueterate hoarsnesse.

A good potion. Take five pints of water, half a pint of honey, six Figs, one
ounce of Currants, two drag. of Licorice, boil one pint of it away, and scum it
well, drink every morning fasting a good cupfull warm: you shall also temper
or mix your wine with it. This potion is also very commodiously used against
the cough. Honey of Roses is also very good for all drouth and hoarsnes of the
throat, for it moisteneth and eases it. In like manner also the conserve of
Roses, oil of sweet Almonds, sirupe of Violets and Honey water, which commonly
allayeth all roughness of the throat.

But if this hoarsnesse proceed of a cold rheum, then is Fennel seed very
profitably used, howsoever it be adhibited: but for this purpose are confected
Cumin seeds, Caru^ and confected Almonds much better. Likewise whatsoever shall
be written hereafter in the second part of this book for the cough, may also
be used in this infirmity.

How to make a clear voice.. 2.
ONions and Garlic, as also the Hyssop wine, are much commended for to make a
clear and good voice, also the tabulats called Diaireos Nicolai.

This electuary following is also much commended for this purpose. Take Cabbage
seeds, Hyssope, Elecampane roots, Fool foot, roots of the Flower deluce,
Horehound, of each half an ounce, Annis seeds, Fennel seeds, Ameos, Cubebs,
Aristology, of each one drag. and a half, Oxymel compositum, Sirupus de
Prassio, of each three ounces, Sugar pennets three drag. Pineapple kernels that
have bin infused in Vine cuict two days four ounces, Saffron one drag.
clarified honey twelve ounces, temper it to a confection or electuary. Take of
this in the morning half an ounce, with two ounces of the decoction of Nettle
roots. If it be not too much trouble for you, take one half of it in the
morning, and the other half at night, mixed with a little Sugar. This may be
used for all harshnes and hoarsnesse of the throat. The water may you alter or
change according to the quality of the disease. And so we end the first part of
this our Book.

The second part of this Practice of Physic, Contains the Breast.
THe Anatomici, by dividing man's body into the outward and inward members, do
affirm the second part of the same to begin in the uppermost part next under
the Head; thence to extend it self downwards unto the Midriffe, which is a
skin that parts the Heart and the Lights from the Belly. This part makes
show outwardly of very few members, to wit, of the Neck, of the Breast, Ribs,
Shoulders, and upper parts of the Back; and contains inwardly two of the
principallest members, as the Heart and Lights: of the which, and of the
diseases of the same, and how they are to be helped, shall now be shown.

The first Chapter. Of the Neck.
THere is none other disease to be seen in the Neck outwardly, then a
swelling or tumor, which is called Bronchocele, the which either comes by
nature, or else of some outward cause: the same chances also sometimes to
swell inwardly, although that commonly depend and is caused of the first
swelling.

Of Bronchocele.. 1.
IF any man have this tumor in the throat by inheritance or descent from his
parents, and naturally is borne with it, as commonly happens in Bintsgaw, and
in many places more, whereof at this present shall not be spoken: for that all
Physicians hereupon conclude, that they are altogether incurable. But that
which is not natural, which proceeds commonly of flegmaticke or waterish
humors; with the which otherwhiles wind is admixed (by joining both together)
breeds knots on the neck. For by experience it has bin found, that when
these Tumors have bin opened by incision, that sometimes there is found nothing
in them but water, therefore is the same called a watery Bronchocele. Sometimes
there will be therein a thick matter like Honey, and otherwhiles a tough
ashcoloured slime, as it were snot or sniuel. Lastly, it has also bin seen,
that there is but a little water in it, with much wind, which in opening (even
as other wind) is let out and flies away. These tumors are caused most of cold
raw Northern winds, and of thick slimy phlegm, whereby all such flegmaticke
defluxions are increased: also through continual use of gross meats that
augment Phlegma. When as such swellings appear, then must you not delay and
rest thereon, but seek some remedy betimes, and not follow the counsel of
such as do say, that it will wear away of it self.

The order of diet.
IT is first needful that he take heed of eating unleavened bread: in like
sort of all young sucking beasts, and that are fat and slimy, as Swines flesh,
fish, and chiefly sod milk, and all that is dressed therewith: also of moist
fruits, as Cherries, Pears, Apples, Haselnuts, and Melons: also of cold and
moist herbs, as Beetes, Spinach, Lettice, Endive, Purslaine, Veriuice, and
fresh butter. But contrariwise, warm and dry dwellings, situate in the East
and South, are very good, and not much sleeping, for that increases much
phlegm: also quiet and idleness are hurtful. Therefore are all such patients
to endeavor themselves to go and walk much, and to hold always the head
upright. And if that cannot be done, let them be rubbed with hot clothes from
their heads downwards toward their feet, until the skin be red therewith,
and also both their feet. Their heads shall be seldom washed, and then only
with lie and Soap after the driest manner, like as you may find a good
instruction thereof in the discovery of the headache. Their drink shall be
small white Wine, that is old and of a good taste, the which must be delayed
with decocted water: in their meats they must beware of all superfluity, and
arise from their meals with appetite: also they must chew their meat well
before they swallow it.

Now to the remedy of this Tumor, first you shall prepare the humor whereby
this swelling is caused with Oximel of Squils, which is acuated with Pepper and
Pellitory of Spain. This must be continued certain days fasting, taking two
or three ounces mingled with wine. In like manner (if need require) open a
vein: afterward use this laxatiue powder following, whereby the corruption
may be drawn out of the head and out of the stomach, the brains
strengthened, and all humors consumed that run toward the swelling. Take
beaten Hermodactili, Turbith, of each one drag. Ginger two scrup. Diagridion
six grains, flowers of Esula half a drag. mingle them together: you are to
give at once half a drag. of this powder or two scrup. at the most, tempered
with three ounces of Meade once every week, and that early in the morning;
whereupon he must fast four hours. And this shall he take continually a whole
month together.

Prepare also this following, and it will consume the corruption and the wind,
whereby the Tumor is caused: Take Cammomill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Annise
seeds, Rue, of each one ounce and a half, dried Goose and Pigeon dung, Sal
gemmae, of each two ounces, all beaten grossly. Of this compound take a
handful, and steep it eight hours long in Sopers lie, and then let it sees
a little; make a sponge wet therein, and bind it warm on the grief. Take one
of these waters following, the which you can get best, to wit, water of
Aristologie, of wild Cucumbers and Rosemary, make a sponge wet that will cover
the same and the places about it, wring it out, and lay it warm thereon, and
renew it often. You must also anoint the part infected and the places about it
with warming oiles, and then lay this plaster following.

Take of Diaculum magnum (called the Apostolicon plaster) Ammoniacum, of each
a like quantity, temper therewith Ireos, and Sal gemmae, both beaten, as much
as the other, spread thereof upon leather: three dragmes of Opopanacum,
Litharge of silver, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, of each one drag. Myrrh, Miscleden,
Frankincense, of each one drag. and a half, Gipa, Bolus, Aloe, of each half a
dragme, the muscilage of Hollihocke half an ounce, Tupentine one ounce, or as
much as is needful: powne all that is to be powned, dissolve the gums in
vinegar, and temper the powder therein, and then make it into a plaster with
wax. This is also good for Bronchocele.

Diverse powders for the same.
TAke Hasell nuts, Spunges, Sea-bals, writing paper burnt all together, Cuttle
bones, and seeds of Plantaine, of each half an ounce, Pepper, Ginger, Sal
gemmae, Pumice stones, Nutmegs, Gals, white and long pepper, Cinnamom, black
and white Hellebore, of each one quarter of an ounce; make them into powder,
and give thereof every morning half a drag. The Hellebore or Neesewort is
somewhat dangerous, therefore this following is safer: Take new spunges, and
burn them in a luted pipkin or pot until they may well be beaten, and give him
thereof every morning with wine one drag. Another which is much used: Take
clean washed spunges four ounces, burn them in a luted pot with half an
ounce of Sponge stones, Pumice stones, and Cuttle bones, of each one drag. red
cloth burnt like to the spunges, half an ounce, mingle them and use them as
before. Make also this gargarisme: Take Oxymel of Squils one ounce, sirupe of
Calamint one quarter of an ounce, blew Ireos and Marioram gentle, of each two
ounces, temper them all together, and therewith you are to gargarize morning
and evening every other day. Let him smell to this that follows: Take
Rosemary flowers, Marioram gentle, and Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Lignum Aloes one drag. and a half, Mace, Ameos Laudanum, red Storax, of each
one drag. Amber half a drag. powne each a part, and bind it up in a piece of
silk, and let him hold it always in his hand for to smell to.

Capital powders.
TAke Cucubes, Nutmegs, Lignum Aloes, Rosemary flowers, Swines bread, of each
half a drag. Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce; powne them and temper them
together: take every morning five greines thereof, and strew it on the top of
the head. Or make a little bag five singers long and three fingers broad, and
lay it on the head. Take the herb called Hearts tongue, beat it small, mingle
it with eggs and meal, bake cakes thereof, and take always thereof before
meals, especially one hour or more before noone, about one quarter of an
ounce.

If one have something sticking in his throat.. 2.
IF one have a great bit of meat sticking in his throat, then are you to clap
him behind above and under his neck, that thereby the meat may be removed,
either by vomiting it out, or swallowing it down toward the stomach. In like
manner also, you are to give him water oftentimes, or rather oil of Roses to
gargarize therewith, and let it down: for it dilateth the throat, and makes
it slippery, whereby the same bit will sink down the better. And this is also
good for all slimy things, as Raisons and Figs sod in Meade. Item take bread,
chew it not too small, and swallow it down. Do the like with Figs, for they
are very commodious for this purpose. Item take a bit of hard sodden flesh,
bind it on a strong thread, and slide it down, and afterward pluck it out
again: if the bone or any thing else that sticks therein cannot be forced
downwards, then with a mullet or other instrument draw it out. But if so be
that all those things will not help, then may you use a leaden pipe which is
thoroughout full of holes, somewhat smooth without, and somewhat bent, which
you may thrust into his throat to the nether part by force.

Take the muscilage or slime of Linseed, Butter, prepared Cassia, oil of
Almonds, of each a like much, lay them on the throat. The vomiting after meat
is also found good for this intent, and is therefore to be moved.

When a Horsleach taken in drink remains sticking in the throat.. 3.
ONe shall perceive this, not only by the place where the same was drunken,
but also by the biting and tickling in the throat, and by the clear blood
that he auoideth, and by the wambling and vomiting. For this you are to press
his tongue downwards, and to look into his mouth whether the Leach can be
seen or not; if yea, to take it by the head with a mullet and draw it out; if
not, then must you make a gargarisme with Mustard seed and vinegar, or with
vinegar and Assa foetida, or with vinegar and salt, which you will, and
gargarize therewith. Or you may blow beaten Mustard seed, and Nigella seed into
his throat. Also you may gargarize with Onions, or the decoction of Garlic.
The ashes of our Ladies thistle blown into the throat, is commended above all
the rest. The root of Gentian beaten, and all that is bitter. When as the
Horsleach is fallen away, then sees the blossoms of Pomegranates in water,
and gargarize therewithal.

To stay the blood, take the blossoms of Pomegranates, Frankincense, Sang.
Draconis, and Starch, of each one drag. blow this powder into his throat. Item
take the blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Sumach seeds, and Sang. Draconis,
boil them in water, and gargarize therewith. You may also blow the foresaid
things into the throat, or boil them in Wine and drink it.

Another. Take Garlic, Lupins, and Coloquint, of each one drag. Gith seeds
half a dragme, Mustard seeds one drag. and a half; boil them all together in
sixteen ounces of vinegar till the fourth part be consumed: then dissolve
three drag. of Salarmoniack in it, and gargarize therewith.

But if the Leach be gone down into the stomach, then are you to use the same
remedies that are prescribed against worms, and there kill it. Or take meal
of Lupins, Turbith, Stechas, Penniroyall, Gith, of each one quarter of an
ounce, mix it with the juice of Wormwood, and make trociskes of it of the
weight of a drag. of which dissolve one in three ounces of the decoction of
Gith, and take it fasting. It is very forcible, but fafer and easier things may
be used for it.

Of the Squinancie or swelling in the throat.. 4.
THis Squinancie have the learned given many kinds of names, and that of the
place in the throat where it appears, or according to the quality and
nature of it: as Angina, Cijnanche or Synanche, which last name the Physicians
have altered, naming the same Squinanchem or Squinantiam. And with all these
names have they meant but one sickness, to wit, a tumor in the throat; even as
they call Pleuritis the pleurisy.

They describe the Squinancie thus: Angina is a strong perilous sickness, that
arises about the throat, in the mouth, and about the throat boll, and very
quickly stops the breath. Or Angina is a flegmaticke defluxion, that sinketh
into the outward part of the throat, and there swells so that all the inward
parts of the throat are thereby shut up, and the breath hindered.

The causes are diverse: for it is engendered as well through great heat, as
through great cold, and also through sharp Northern winds; but especially
when the same blows presently after a South wind: Likewise also if one sit
bare headed in the Mooneshine a long time. But this sickness does chiefly come
and proceed of defluxions that fall out of the head into the throat, and there
cause a swelling; and chiefly in the falling of the leaf or harvest, when the
rheumes are most of all mingled with sharp Cholera; like as the same are in
winter for the most part mingled with Phlegma. Sleeping also immediately after
meals with hanging of the head increases the same. Fat meat, and all that is
dressed with milk, Melons, and violent motions straight after meats, cause also
this sickness. The same do also denimous things, as black Hellebore, and all
Toadstooles. So are sometimes blood, Cholera, Phlegma and Melancholia occasions
of this sickness, which nevertheless do seldom strangle a man.

The signs of Angina are a short breath, with bad swallowing; otherwhiles
blistering of the tongue, so that the drink taken will be driven out at the nose
again: the speech goes through the nose more or less, as the sickness is of
importance.

If the blood be cause of it, then is the pulse strong, the face, eyes and
tongue red, the mouth sweet, great pain and retaining of the breath. If it come
of Cholera, then is there great heat with little spettle, thirst, blistering,
and drought of the tongue, bitterness of the mouth, and great pain with it: the
breath is not so short as of blood, the tongue is yellowish: this is also
augmented in harvest, and in summer, and if one be choleric also.

If this sickness proceed of Phlegma, then is there too much tough moisture in
the mouth, sometimes salt, and of an evil taste, the face is bleake and the
tongue also: then is but little pain, little thirst, and a little tumor.

But if it proceed of Melancholia, then is therewith sowernesse in the mouth,
the swelling is hard, his face ashcoloured. Also this Squinancie comes by
little and little, and not so sudden as the other.

Now to ease this disease, there is nothing better then to eat and drink but
little: the drink shall be a Iulep of Roses tempered with Well water, or Sugar
water, or any things Meade.

Further, he is to eat light meats, as bread mollified in fresh flesh broth,
and such like. He shall also oftentimes two hours after meat take Pillulas
Elephanginas, and let his head be offer combed and stroked. And let him
gargarize with wine of Pomegranates and barley water mingled together.
Afterward he is to cleanse his mouth with six ounces of Barley water, wherein
is tempered one ounce of the sirupe of the outward green nut shells. Before
meat he is to use water to wash his feet, wherein Woodbind, Bay leaves,
Marioram gentle, and Rosemary are decocted, and he shall rub his legs
downwards with these herbs. Also he is often to use three ^^ four grains of
Masticke, and one grain of Cucubes, or Lignum Aloes, to chew it in the
morning, and to hold it in his mouth.

For this infirmity it is also very commodious for one to avoid much filth
through the nose.

And as this Squinancy is caused diversely, so do the learned also divide the
same into four kinds: First, when the throat and the bulk, with the parts
round about them, do swell: Secondly, if about the throat there be no swelling
seen on the outside, notwithstanding above all this, that the breath is so
short that one would think that the patient would be strangled: Thirdly, when
there appears a swelling on the outside of the throat: Fourthly, when the
throat swells as well within as without.

But after what manner soever it comes, it is always a perilous sickness,
and especially the second kind, for that it is very quick and speedy, so that
oftentimes it dispatcheth one in two or three days; and commonly it is more
dangerous for children then for aged folk: therefore do the Latinists call this
kind of Squinancy Strangulatorem, which is, Strangler, as it were somewhat that
fell into the throat, the which then so stopped the breath, that one must
therewith be strangled. For Strangulatio they say, is naught else but a speedy
death, by reason that one can get no breath, even as it happens when the throat
is stopped. And this is the difference between them: the Squinancy (as it is
said) kills one very hastily: Peripneumonia (which is a sickness of the
lights) does with a painful breath strangle by little and little. But if rheumes
fall into the throat, then are they a cause of strangling, for that thereby the
pipes of the lights in time are stopped.

If in swallowing he feel a narrowness and pain that the breath be painfully
drawn, and that the patient have scarcenes of breath, and is constrained to
hold open his mouth, then is the Squinancy at hand, which is great or small, as
may appear by the vehemence of the signs. And for that this disease
proceeds as well of blood, Cholera, and heat, as of cold and Phlegma, and so
requires special remedies, therefore we will hereafter in particular speak
of them.

Of the Squinancie or pain in the throat through heat.. 5.
FOr this Squinancy, regard is to be had to the face and the eyes, whether they
be red, and the face puffed up, and whether the patients spettle be sweet: Also
whether he (being healthy) has used much nourishing meat and drink, for when
these signs (as is said) do appear, then it is certain that this Squinancy
proceeds of superfluous blood and heat, then is the head vein to be opened
without all delay on the right hand, and to let out four or five ounces of
blood, according to the ability of the person, and to use this Clister by and
by after it.

Take Mallows, Hollihocke roots, Violet leaves, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each a
handful, sees these in sufficient water unto the half part. Take 12. or 16.
ounces of this decoction, oil of Dill, and of Saffron, of each one ounce, oil
of Beuercod half an ounce, Hiera logodion one ounce, the juice of Swines bread
(if you can get it) one scruple, Diagridion half a scrup. salt one drag.
minister it warm. If the sickness be somewhat tolerable, then within twelve
hours after set two great boxing cups on the shoulders hard by the neck very
warm, and let them bleed well.

But if the patient be corpulent, then is the Median to be opened on the same
side, or the little veins under the tongue. This letting of blood is not to be
done at one time only, but if the patient may well abide it, shall be the
oftener reiterated, and the less at once, for it dispatcheth and drives the
matter from them.

But until the patient be let blood, Clistered, and boxed, he must be rubbed
with warm clothes, and first, from beneath the knees even to the feet;
afterward, from the thighs to the knees; thirdly, from the shoulders unto the
huckle bone; fourthly, from the shoulders unto the hands: or at the leastwise
bind the same members hard, and make them loose often, as has been said.

Then both before and after purging are presently to be used all cooling and
astringent gargarismes, whereof diverse are described in the third Chapter and
the fourth.

Or make it thus, Lay the seeds of Sumach to steep in Rice water, and
gargarize therewith. Or take Coriander, Sumach, Gals, Hippocistis, Pomegranate
pills, of each a like quantity, sees these in sufficient water until the half
be consumed.

This following is also very good (being used within the first three days)
Take the water of Purslaine and Plantaine, of each four ounces, sirupe of
green Nutshels three ounces, tempered and holden long in the mouth.

Item, to gargarize with warm milk eases the pain. Take sirupe of Poppy
heads, and sirupe of Mulberries, of each one drag. Rose water three ounces,
tempered and used as the other before.

Or take Barley water as much as you will, and mingle amongst it sirupe of
Pomegranats, Mulberies, and honey of Roses as much as you will.

Item take small sliced Licorice, Currants, Figs, Fleawort, Quince kernels, and
white Poppy seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, barley one ounce and a half,
sees it in sufficient water till that the barley break, put unto it two ounces
of the honey of Roses. This is very good to be used after the purging.

Take Acornes that be old, beat them small, give of them to the patient twice
a day half a drag. at each time, in what you please. This is special good
against the swelling of the throat: it is also good to take the fume of them
into the throat.

Item take dried white dogs dung, half an ounce beaten small, tempered with
the sirupe of Mulberies, and give it to the patient to swallow by little and
little: it helps and dries maruellously.

What ought to be used outwardly.
BEfore there be any salues, plasters, or any other thing laid upon the
outside thereof, you are to froth and rub the patients arms and legs (even as
before is said) and anoint the same members afterward with fresh butter, or
with the oil of sweet Almonds. Or use this following: Take the salve Dialthea
one ounce and a half, muscilage of Fleawort and of Quince kernels, of each one
quarter of an ounce, prepared Cassia and fresh butter, of each one drag. Leven
and Dates, of each half an ounce, oil of Violets two ounces, and make a salve
of them.

Item take a Swallows neast, and sees it in Well water, strain the same
through a narrow seeue, and in this water boil the roots of Lillies,
Mallows, Hollihockes, Violet leaves, Pellitory, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each
one handful: stamp them all together with Barley water and Linseed meal, of
each one ounce, Cammomill two ounces, and thereof make a plaster.

Another of Montagnana. Take a Swallows neast, Mallows and Hollihock roots,
of each one handful, Cammomill, Adiantum, of each two handfuls, barley meal
three ounces, oil of Cammomill one ounce, and lay it warm on the throat.
Afterward if any impostume appear, then take Figs, Fenegreeke, and Squils, of
each half an ounce, sees them together in a pint of water till but half
remain, temper it with three ounces of Oxymel, and then gargarize with it. And
if you think that it be too mild, then open the swelling (if you can come to
it) and wash the mouth often with wine and honey.

For purging thereof.
THis purging must be effected with cool things, as sower Dates, Prunes,
Confections, Cassia and Manna (as shall seem good:) also mild clisters are to
be used, as hereafter follows.

Take Mallows, Hollihock roots, Violet leaves and Orage, of each a handful,
of the seed of Melons, Cucumbers, Gourdes and Pompeons stamped gross together,
of each one drag. and a half: sees them all together in sufficient water,
take of this decoction 12. or 16. ounces, Cassia one ounce, salt one drag.
minister it warm.

Good heed is also to be taken, that the patient have a soluble body; and to
that end serve suppositories made of Venice soap, using the same oftentimes.

If the same ach of the head be mixed with Cholera, the which may be known
hereby, that is, if with the swelling there be a pricking and gnawing pain,
yellow color, bitterness in the mouth: also if that he in time of health have
eaten such meats as augment Cholera, then is the sick body to be purged with
the abouesaid things. Rubarbe is also very commodious for it, in this manner
following: Take one ounce of Manna, Rubarbe one dragme or twain, steep them
in six ounces of prune-broth six hours long; then strain it out hard:
afterward use the Clister which is described in the twelfth Chapter of the
first part 5.. for madness or frenzy which begins thus, Take Lettice, etc.

Hereupon you are to open the head vein on the hand, and set cups on the neck
and shoulders. Use also these aforesaid gargarisms, or this following: Take the
juice of Nightshade that is well settled, six ounces, Roses, sliced Licorice
and Fitches, of each half an ounce, good white wine three ounces, let it sees
meetly well; then temper it amongst one ounce and a half of Cassie, and
gargarize therewith often. This helps and eases the pain. In the increase
of the sickness, there is sometimes used Myrrh sodden with wine. In like
manner also the muscilage of Barley tempered with Goats milk, Sugar,
Nightshade, and a little Saffron.

Thus may then the bad matter be drawn outwardly: Take Sheep wool dipped in
oil of Cammomill and Sallad oil, and lay it upon the sore. Or (if one can get
it) take one quarter of an ounce of Snakes skins, which the Snakes do cast
every year, and sees it in an ounce of oil of Almonds: then wet a cloth
therein, and lay it on the place where the sore is a whole day and a night.

This plaster following is to this end also much commended. Take Fenegreeke
and Linseed meal, of each one quarter of an ounce, Hollihocke seeds,
Cammomill, Hyssope, of each one handful. These three last sees, and stamp to
pap, and then mingle it with the foresaid meal, and with two ounces of
Cammomill oil, and two ounces of the oil of Lillies: afterward sees it all
together until it be somewhat thick, and then lay it warm on the neck.

In like manner are highly commended the swallows with their young ones, burnt
in a pot to ashes, and the same blown into the throat, or tempered with
honey, and the throat anointed therewith, or gargarized, which is a passing
good remedy.

But above all other is Oxymel with Rosewater and vinegar in the beginning most
commended. Likewise the sirupe of Mulberries and green Nut shells: so that the
skillful Physicians do write, that those three last are the best remedies of
all others. Prepare also these pills to hold under the tongue: Take Assa
foetida one drag. Ireos half an ounce, make them up with the juice of
Colewoorts.

If you think that the patient will be strangled and cannot swallow, then take
Hemlocke seed, Radish seed, Assa foetida, Borras, Myrrh, Ammoniacum, and
common Salt, of each a like quantity: of these altogether, or of some of these
make a powder, and blow thereof into the throat. A great boxing cup (without
pricking or otherwise) set behind in the neck, helps that the meat and
drink will be the easier swallowed down.

But in case that the impostume be broken, then are you often to gargarize with
Meade and wine, wherein Sugar and Ireos be sodden. Iulep of Violets is very good
for these kind of pains.

Pain in the throat through Phlegma, and cold taking.. 6.
IF the face and the eyes be not red nor fiery, and that the patient have his
mouth always full of spettle, and is hoarce without great pain, with other
signs more of Phlegma: then shall Treacle and Mithridate be used, for that they
mitigate the pain, expel all swellings, and cleanse all exulcerations
wonderfully. Further, you may use this gargarisme following: Take Ireos half
an ounce, Hyssop, Adiantum, of each one drag. Licorice, Currants, and Figs, of
each one ounce, Fenegreek and Lineseede, of each half an ounce, Barley one
ounce and a half, let it sees together in sufficient water until the half
be spent. Also you may make choice out of the last mentioned gargarismes in the
13. Chapter and 4.. of that shall best like you, and that is special good
which is prepared of the sirupe of Mulberries and sirupe of green Nut shells,
for a foul mouth: for both of these are specially commended for all pains of
the throat, as daily experience teaches. The root of Devils bit sodden in
water, and therewith gargarized, does maruellously ease the squinancie.

For to purge are very requisite the pills Cochiae, Foetidae, de Hiera, and the
powder Medicamen de Turbith, according as need shall require. And if need be,
let a strong Clister be made and ministered, as you shall find in the twelfth
Chapter and the 17.. that which is very meet for this, which begins, Take
Centorie, etc.

There are Trocisces also used that are to be holden in the mouth, and are to
be made and dressed thus: Take Masticke, Frankincense, Raisins, red Storax, and
Nep, of each one quarter of an ounce, beat them all to powder, and make
trocisces thereof in weight half a drag. The ancient Physicians did use to
take a green Elderne stick, to shave from it the uttermost bark, and did take
the green and yellow rind of it, and strewed them with wheat flower, and so
held them in the mouth. They do warm and dry much.

Outwardly you must anoint the neck with Sallad oil, Cammomill oil, and
oil of sweet Almonds, or with the ointment of Dialthaea, and washed Sheep
wool laid upon it, and afterward the plaster before mentioned in the 5..
with Cassia, or this that hereafter follows, for that there is small
difference between them both.

Take the unguent of Althaea one ounce and a half, the muscilage of Fenegreeke
and Linseede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cassia, fresh Butter, of each
one quarter of an ounce, sour dough, and fat Dates one ounce, oil of sweet
Almonds two ounces, and thereof make a salve or plaster.

Or take Wheat, Fenegreeke, and Lineseede meal, of each two ounces, water
six ounces, oil of Cammomill two ounces, sees them till they be thick
enough, and afterward spread it on a cloth, and lay it about his neck.

Item, take Goose dung, and Swines blood, of each a like quantity, mingle
them, and lay it five times in 24. hours about his neck.

Some ancient Physicians do counsel to take warm Honey of Anacardio, Mel
Anacardium, and let the neck be anointed thick clean over, that blisters
may be raised, whereby the matter might have an issue forth.

Item, take white dogs dung (of a dog that eats nothing but bones) Swallows
dung, or Wolfes dung, which you can get, beat them to powder, afterward
temper it with honey, and anoint the neck therewith. This may you make for a
gargarisme, or blow into the throat with a pipe.

If sudden strangling be feared, then are you to clip or shave off as much
hair from the top of his head, that a great boxing cup may be set thereon,
which must be often fastened, and taken off again.

In greatest extremity is wont to be made a vent in the patients throat
between the two gristles, that he through the same vent may take air and
breath, the which vent afterward when the swelling is gone, is to be cured as
other wounds are.

Of the Ulcers of the throat.. 7.
WHen as then the foresaid Squinancie or any other defluxion has so annoyed
the throat, that thereby the skin is broken, and the throat exulcerated,
then take Cypers nuts, Calmus, Sulfer viue, burnt Allume, Roses, Pomegranate
pills, Masticke, Frankincense, and Pieretrum, of each one drag. and twelve
ounces of Aqua vitae, temper them all together and keep them for thy use.

Then in the time of need, take a little thereof, and gargarize therewith, for
it dries, cleanses and heals marvelous well. If this be too strong, then
allay it with Plantaine water, Knotgrasse water, or Prunella water. For this
purpose is also good a decoction of Guaiacum. In like manner also Aqua
Iohannis, which is described in the twelfth Chapter of the first part and 5..
But of all such things that do greatly hinder the same, you shall find good
instructions herafter in the beginning of the description of the stomach.

The second Chapter. Of all Rheumes and Defluxions in general.
THis Greek word Rheuma, termed also in English a rheum, is nothing else but
a defluxion which descends or falls from the head into the throat or
breast, which does otherwhiles so stop there the pipes of the lights and
throat, that the patient seems to strangle or choke. Also these Rheumes do
often fall into the nostrels, where they cause the Pose, which is described in
the second part the eight Chapter, and 6..

And forasmuch as these kinds of Rheumes, according to their several natures
have several names, as that which falls into the nostrels is called Coryza:
that which descends into the breast, Rheuma: that which comes into the
throat, Bronchus: Nevertheless, all tough and slymie defluxions which fall
from one member into another, are called rheumes or defluxions; for that they
provoke (as is said) not only the strangling in the throat, but also are both
noisome and troublesome unto the breast; whereof we shall shortly write:
therefore it is very requisite that we make mention of them at this present.

First these rheumes do proceed of diverse causes, like as when the humors of
the brain, through the same, through bathes, vaporing meats; as Onions,
Garlic, Mustard, Pepper, and such like, are made thin and fluxible.

Secondly, these are caused of great cold, whereby the parts of the head be
thrust and compelled together, and the humors forcibly expelled; even as water
is wrong out of a sponge. In like manner may they be stirred up of the
superabundance of some humors, be it of Cholera or Phlema, or of some other
outward alterations, as of a sharp Northerly wind, that blows suddenly after
a South wind.

In fine, the plasters that are neither too hot nor too cold, are auailable
for all such defluxions; to wit, as follows: Take Rosin two ounces, Laudanum
half an ounce, Myrrh, Masticke, of each half a dragme Sandaraca one quarter
of an ounce, Bean meal, Pease meal, of each half an ounce; dissolve the
Rosin and Laudanum in one ounce of lie, and let them sees till they be very
soft: then put it into a mortar, and mix the meal amongst it: Spread this
warm upon a cloth, and lay it upon the whole head. If you will have it harder
then leave out the meal, and temper together with the other one drag. and a
half of Wax. This comfort the brains, stays the rheum, dries all tough
slime that falls into the nostrels, mouth, and throat, and would choke one.
For it is often found, that those that have been at the point of death, have by
this means been recovered.

Item take new Barley meal two ounces, Nigella seeds, Mustard seed, and Mice
dung, of each one ounce, Ox gals, or the urine of a manchild, as much as
suffices therewith to make a plaster. Or take fresh Bryonie roots twelve
ounces, Wormwood, Rosemary, Marioram, all green, of each a handful and a
half, Barley meal two ounces, Saffron one dragme, Scammony half a dragme,
oil of Lillies three dragms: sees well all the roots in water, afterward
stamp them well to growt or pap amongst the other herbs, and therewith temper
all the rest, except the Saffron which must be also added unto them. Last of
all spread thereof upon a cloth, and then lay them all warm over all the
polled head, covering the same warm.

This is also commodious for all old headaches, especially for such as proceed
of cold humors: for it consumes all defluxions and bad vapors of the brains
that fall out of the head into the eyes, ears, teeth, and throat: it is twice
a day to be renewed.

These two plasters following are also highly commended to be very good for
the same: first, put above upon the head a meetly great box or cup vnpickt
upon the same, on the seame of the scul (the hair being cut off before) and
the place that the cup is fastened unto must be first well rubbed, till it be
red, and let the cup draw it well. Afterward lay this plaster following
thereon: Take Laudanum, Gummi Heleni, Sandaraca, Frankincense, white and red
Storax, and Rosin, of each a like much, melt the Laudanum, Rosin, and the
liquid Storax together, and temper the other with them: But if it be hard, then
make it softer with oil of Lillies plaisterwise.

The second is more forcible than the first. Take Aloe, wild Mints, and Citron
pills, of each a like much; mix them together with Laudanum in a warm mortar,
with as much juice of Sloes as will make it soft.

Of Rheumes that proceed of cold.. 1.
THe cause of these rheumes are strong cold Northern winds, and chiefly if
there did blow before that, a mild moist Southwest wind, as has been told
already. Also to lie bareheaded in the nights when it is cold, whereby the
moisture is forcibly driven together, and chiefly if warmth follow after, as
has been heretofore showed of the Sponge. Also moist fruits do cause these
distillations, as Cherries, Apples, Pears, Peaches, and such like.

These Rheumes are known by these signs following: as weariness and heaviness
of the whole body, sleepiness, heaviness of the head and forehead, palenes
of the face, with full veins, stuffing of the head or nose, bereauing of the
sense of smelling, swelling up of the eyes, pain in the throat, motion to
vomit, dropping of the nose, and swelling of the Almonds.

In like manner is the head also in the feeling found cold, and the rheum is
neither sharp nor biting at all.

The which is commonly engendered and maintained, if the complexion, the time,
the age, and the weather be cold.

As for example. If that any one do run into the cold air bareheaded out of
a bath, or after any other great warmth, especially in the nights, and begin to
get a tickling in the nose, then is it a sure sign that he has already
gotten a defluxion, and then must the patients head be covered so long with
warm clothes, that he feels manifestly that his head begins to warm
inwardly, or in stead thereof he shall lay these things following upon his head.

Take beaten Millet four ounces, Salt one ounce, parch them in a pan, and
lay this upon his head as hot as may be suffered. Or take a good quantity of
Salt, power thereto as much Wine as is requisite to dissolve the same Salt, and
being a little sodden, wet clothes therein, press them out, and lay them very
dry upon his head, this dries and is safe. You may also prepare this salve.
Take Pigeons dung, wild Rue, Beuercod, and white Mustard seed, of each one
drag. oil of Rue three ounces, Euphorbium half a drag. Wax as much as will
suffice for a plaster, but let the forepart of the head be shorn, and the
place anointed therewith where the sore is, it is forcible and dries much.

Will you now have more plasters and salues for the same? then look into the
first part of the description of the cold pain of the head, for these things
are also very commodious for this pain.

Yet note this, that all that is here discoursed, is to be speedily effected:
for if this disease be to be maistered, the same must be done at the beginning,
when as the patient is incontinently to have a vein opened on the right hand
between the thumb and the forefinger, letting out four or five ounces of
blood.

Clisters.
AFter the full dispatch of letting of blood, minister a Clister unto him at
night. Take Branne, Mallows, roots of blew Flower deluce, Beetes of each one
handful, sees it all together in sufficient water, and then take of this
decoction 12. or 16. ounces, confection of Beuercod a drag. and a half,
prepared Cassie and Tho. Sugar, of each five drag. oil of Lillies and
Cammomill, of each one ounce and a half, Salt one quarter of an ounce, mingle
them all together, and minister it meetly warm. The next morning following
give these pills: take pills of Hiera composita two scruples, Cochiae one
scruple, make seven pills and use them at one time.

Against the evening let him be rubbed with rough warm clothes, even as is
said not long ago in the first Chapter and 5.. of the pain of the throat. And
this is to be observed certain days every morning and evening.

Gargarismes.
If therefore these rheumes be cold, thin, and wateris, then can you not do
better, than to make the same thick, the which may be performed with Mastick,
Frankincense, Cypers nuts, and such like, if one do gargarize oftentimes
therewith, or use this following. Take Myrrh, and Frankincense, of each one
ounce, Cypers nuts, Nutmegs, and Masticke, of each half an ounce, beat them
all together, and boil them in twelve ounces of red Wine unto the half, and
gargarize therewith.

Cakes to be holden under the Tongue.
TAke Masticke, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, of each half a dragme, red Storax, and
Frankincense, of each one dragme and a half, fat Raisins (the stones taken
out) Sugarpane, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a dough thereof with
Meade, and then make Cakes thereof as big as small Beans, the which you are to
hold continually day and night under the tongue.

Syrupes and purgations.
FOr a sirupe, Take Sage, Cypres leaves, of each one ounce, Lignum Aloes one
quarter of an ounce, clarified honey and Sugar, of each six ounces, and let
them sees together in a sirupe, as has been often taught.

Another. It is also very needful, that in such diseases the head be well
purged, whereto this sirupe following serves well: Take Elecampane roots,
Ireos, Currants and Licorice, of each one ounce, Hyssope, Adiantum, of each a
handful, Masticke, Frankincense, of each one dragme, Nutmegs, Cypres nuts, of
each half an ounce, sees this together (as is beforesayd) with Sugar, and give
him certain days continually two ounces which three ounces of this water.

Take twenty Iuiubes, thirty Sebestes, Currants one ounce and a half, dried
Violets half an ounce, cut Licorice five dragmes, and ten figs, sees them all
together in a pint and a half of water, unto the half; afterward strain it
out, and let it settle. You have also here before in the first part for the
cold pain of the head, sirupes and other things that serve for these rheumes.
For purging these pills following are special good, as Hiera Composita and
Cochiae.

Three days after purging, there is to be set above the buttockes two great
boxing cups vnpickt, two hours before supper, and let them draw well, and the
next morning take of this confection following the quantity of a Walnut: Take
Ginger two ounces, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Cloves Nutmegs, and
Cardamom, of each one drag. and 18. ounces of refined white Sugar; temper them
all together one amongst another.

Another, Take Cinnamome one dragme and a half, Nutmegs, red Storax, of each
half a dragme, Licorice, Currants, of each one ounce, Sugar candy half an
ounce, refined Sugar five ounces, make a confection thereof, and take half an
ounce thereof every evening when you go to to bed. The seventh day after that
the patient has been purged, he shall every day two hours before meals, at
noone and at night, twice every month wash his mouth with water wherein Costus
and Asarabacca, of each half an ounce is decocted. Take of this water four
ounces, of Oxymel Compositum two ounces, therewith shall he gargarize two days
one after another, till he have washed it eight times. For this cold rheum is
also special good the herb Calmus, as it is described in the eight part of
this book. Three corns of white Frankincense swallowed down before he go to
bed are also commended: And if so be that the rheum be waren a little thicker,
then is there no better advice in the world: for it comfort and dries not
only the brains, but stops the rheum also from falling. It is also good
counsel after purging every third or fourth day, three or four hours before
meals, that you take a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, the which is better
for aged than for young folks.

Capital Powder.
AFter letting blood, you are every evening two hours after supper, to strew
the head with this powder following: Take red Storax, Roses, burnt Iuorie, wild
Vine leaves, Cloves, Sandaraca, of each one dragme, and make a powder thereof.

Another for to smell on: Take Nigella that is parched on the sire, bind it in
a cloth, and smell often thereto. Or take Lignum Aloes, red Storax, of each one
dragme and a half. Nutmegs, Cypers, Frankincense and Cloves, of each one
dragme, parched Nigella seeds one quarter of an ounce: stamp them all
together, and bind them in a cloth. The vapor or smell of Sugar is also good
for the brains, and drives away all cold rheumes.

In this behalf Pomanders may be made also, as follows: Pomanders.
Take Laudanum and Horehound, of each half an ounce, Lignum Aloes, red Storax,
of each one drag. and a half, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, Frankincense and Cloves,
of each one drag. Amber half a drag. powne all small that is to be powned, and
dissolve the Laudanum with Rose water in a warm mortar, and make thereof a
pomander. Another: Take one dragme of Laudanum, Lignum Aloes, red Storax,
Frankincense, of each half a drag. Nigella, Cinnamom and Cloves, of each two
scruples, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts and Sandaraca, of each one drag. Galliae
Muscatae one drag. Myrrh, Lauander spike, Masticke, Costus roots, of each one
scrup. Amber half a scrup, Muscus three grains: dissolve the Laudanum with a
little Wax, and temper the rest being powdered amongst it, form thereof
pomanders as big as you will have them: afterward make holes in them, and put
into them the Musk and Amber mixed with a little Rose water. Such like
pomanders shall you have more hereafter in the sixth part.

You may also make bags with all these foresaid compositions.

For this disease some do counsel to neese, and some suppose it hurtful: but
if these things do help the patient, then I counsel that this neesing be
omitted, that the brains and the head be not thereby disquieted.

Plasters.
TAke Pigeon doung, Rue seeds, Mustard seed, Frankincense, Masticke, Nigella,
of each half an ounce, mingle these things with Oxymel of Squils, and then put
the rest amongst it, spread it upon leather, and lay this plaster on the top
of the head. This plaster dries the superfluous moisture of the head, and
strengthens the same, and you may put thereto Stechas, Rosemarie, Marioram
gentle and Cloves.

Of the Diet in these rheumes.
EVery such patient must have special care, that he never lie upon his back:
for if the rheumes fall backwards, then is it to be feared that they will
provoke the crampe or palsy, or might choke one.

His dwelling place or chamber shall be prepared for drith and warmth, yea in
summer season also: for if he should use moist things, then it will be the
worse for him, and be in danger of the palsy.

In fine, the greatest care of all must be, that his dwelling be free from all
moisture, and if the place be not so by nature, then take fire, and cast
therein these things following, (or one alone) therewith to fume his chamber:
to wit, Sandaraca, Laudanum, Rosin of both sorts, Frankincense, red Storax, and
such like. Make also a fire with Juniper wood, Baytree wood, Tamarisk wood, or
with any thing of that nature: and the patient must be warm clothed, and have
a special regard to his head, and he shall wear always on the breast a soft
small cushion, filled with down or Hares hair, or (which is better) with
Squirrels hair, the which he is to keep about him night and day.

Concerning his meat and drink, every such patient must refrain from wine as
much as is possible, and drink only Sugar water tempered with wine or juice
of Pomegranates, to wit, the sixth or seventh part of it. So that nature finding
no superfluity of the meat, may the more easily work upon the moisture of
the rheum, and therewithal consume it.

Here is to be noted, that one ought not to eat unless hunger urge thereto:
otherwise might one evil light upon another, and the stomach thereby be
weakened. But when natural hunger comes, then may he eat, yet evermore
arise and cease with appetite, and avoid all superfluity, especially if he
feel any distemperature in the stomach, and drink not before meat, unless
the meat before were passed thorough the stomach, which happens at least
eight hours after that it is taken.

His bread shall be in winter and in the spring time wheaten bread with the
bran: but in harvest and in summer he may eat boulted bread. Also it were not
hurtful for him in case the same bind him not overmuch, that always after
meat he eat a little biscuit baked with Annis seed, in which bread (be it
howsoever it will) is to be observed, that it be baked light, rising or puffed
up, and salted a little more then ordinary, and that it be not above three
days old.

Concerning his flesh, all kinds are good for him, Veale, Kids flesh, young
Mutton, and lean Porke, but not too much, nor too often. All old and fat flesh
must he shun and forbear. Of wild beasts, Bucks and Does flesh is best of all.
Hares flesh, albeit it be somewhat melancholic, yet nevertheless because it
dries, is not very unwholesome for him, yet chiefly if it be dressed with
Pepper, but he must forbear Conies and Hedgehogs.

It is also requisite to show what parts of the beasts are most wholesome for
this sickness: to wit, the stomach, the heart; the skin, the sinews, the
milt, the intrailes, the brains, the lights and such like of the foresaid
beasts, are hard of digesture, and their fat is windy.

Other parts are much easier of digestion and warmth of nature: reasonable fat
flesh is easy to be digested, the wings or pinnions and the legs are good for
him at noone, being sodden; and at night are good roasted: but fried in a pan is
not for his diet.

All fowls, as Capons, Cocks, and chiefly Hens, wild and tame Pigeons which
are not fully feathered, and have been killed a day or twain before, and are
well dressed: these may he eat frank and freely.

Young Peacocks, Geese and Ducks, shall he also refrain, or at least eat of
them very seldom, and that roasted. Of all wild birds, these are good for him,
Partridges, Fesants, and small birds; as also Stares, Finches, Nightingales,
Larkes, Sparrowes, Snites, Dishwashers, and such like; by reason that all their
flesh is much drying.

Swallows, Magpies, and Woodpigeons are not to be used: Quails shall he also
abstain from, in regard they are hurtful for the stomach, and breed
loathsomeness.

No kind of fish is to be used: but in case that he will eat them, then let
them be hard broiled; to wit, Roches, Pikes, Gugeons, Perches, and such like:
and they will hurt the less if they be dressed with Parsley and Mints: and they
are always better broyled or fried, than sodden and stued: also the salt fish
is better than the fresh. The Eele, the Tench, and the Creuets are also
forbidden. Likewise Milk and all that is dressed therewith: but he may eat ^eare
eggs out of their shells, or poched; but hard eggs are naught.

Of all manner of Pottages, there is only allowed of Panicum, red Pease, and
Rice.

The herbs that are commodious for this must be in operation drying and
warming, as Sage, Fennel, Mints, wild Thyme, Rosemary, Marierom gentle, Basil
Dill. Contrariwise he must forbear Lettice, Endive, Spinach, Cherries, and all
that are cold and moist. In like manner also Radish, Leekes, and Onions, (after
what manner soever that they be dressed) shall he forbear.

Rapes or Turnips have much superfluous moisture, therefore are not to be used:
but Olives and Capers are good for him. He must avoid all cold and moist
fruits, parched Hasell nuts, Almonds, Figs, Raisins, Pinapple kernels:
Pistacium may he use without danger. All meats that are between sower and
sweet; in like manner that which is dressed with Ginger, Annis seed, Fennel,
Parsley, Saffron, Cinnamom, Nutmegs, and Mace, are very commodious for him; and
the rather if they be sweetened with honey than with Sugar.

Item a Sallad made of Parsley, Mints, wild Thyme, and Vinegar, is very
profitable for him. His best drink is honey water or Meade, Cinnamom and
Licorice wine, amongst which are to be tempered some of the foresaid waters:
And if he will needs drink wine without mingling it at all with water, then
is to be taken (as is said) a thin and pleasant white Wine, the which ought
to be drunken delayed with steeled water.

Lastly is the patient after meals to use somewhat that closes the stomach,
that the vapors ascend not into the head; as prepared Coriander, toasted bread,
roasted Quinces, or such as be confected with honey.

In the morning fasting, to go or walk on foot, or to ride a horseback
softly, is very commodious for these Rheumes. And if the patient be not so
strong, then may one use in stead thereof to rub him with warm clothes, (even
as is oftentimes before said) and after meals to keep himself quiet two or
three hours.

Of watching and sleeping.
THis patient must wholly forbear sleeping on the day time, unless he be
otherwise distempered, and must forbear it at the leastwise two hours after
meat: first he must lay himself on the right side and then on the left side,
and not on the back; for how hurtful the same is, has been showed
sufficiently before.

The heat of the sun and of the fire must he avoid, and forbear loud
calling and speaking. And to conclude, touching these cold and stifling
rheumes, we will tell how they are to be prevented, the which may be effected
through these means following.

And for that this disease proceeds of a cold and moist stomach and brains,
all things (measurably warm and dry) are good for it, as these confections
following.

These Species, Diatrion piperion, Aromaticum Rosatum, of each half a drag.
Mace one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamom one drag. and a half, Sugar three
ounces, sirupe of Roses five ounces; the Sugar and the sirupe sees till they
be meetly thick; afterward mix the other spices amongst them in a mortar:
take every day four hours before meals, as much as a Nutmeg. And this must
you continue a month together, and afterward three times a week, as long as
you please.

Or make this confection to be used after meat, and take thereof three dragmes
at one time: Take Species Di^mbrae, de xylo Aloe, of each one drag. and a half,
Violets, Water Lillies, Sorrel seeds, and Endive seeds, of each one scrup.
Sugar four ounces, sees it in water of Violets, and make Manus Christi of
them.

A plaster for the stomach.
TAke Laudanum and Rosin, of each five drag. prepared Coral and Yuorie, small
Endive seed and Purslaine seed, of each one scrup. The two first you shall
dissolve in sharp vinegar, and put thereto molten wax as much as is needful,
and thereof make a plaster or twain for the stomach, and wear them all the
winter upon it.

When these rheumes are a dividing, then must you prepare a dry bath, as
hereafter follows.

Take a sweating tub, make it meetly wet with wine and Rosewater, afterward
hail the same over a glowing fire till that it be through dry: then make the
same wet again with a sponge or cloth, as before: and do this so long, until
that the tub be through hot; and then set the patient therein, and cover the
tub over with clothes, which must stay upon the hoopes, yet holding his head
without: and let him sit so sweating one hour or twain.

Hot Rheumes.. 2.
AS in the beginning is generally treated of rheumes, so are there also
declared certain causes of the hot rheum, therefore it is needless to
rehearse the same again. These rheumes are much provoked through idleness,
through sleeping a days, through superfluous eating and drinking. Also if the
head be too hot covered, great labor, ouerheating of himself, and such like.

The signs and tokens that one has the rheum, are these: to wit, the face is
red, mixed with bleaknesse or pale color, great heat in the nose, with
itchings, when as the mouth and the throat are full of bitterness and
sharpness. And if the head be hot in feeling: the which rheum is thus to be
cured.

First, it has not been a little disputed of amongst the learned, whether a
vein must be opened or not; but for the most part they affirm it: some would
open the head vein, other the median, and some the Liver vein. But this
letting of blood must be effected, according as the rheum falls more on the
one side than the other, and when the rheum is almost stayed. For it has been
often seen, that they that have been let blood in the beginning of the rheum,
have always remained and been the hotter. But to diminish all such subtle
courses of the rheum, and to make it thick, then must he hold in his mouth
these gargarismes and losinges.

Of Gargarismes.
TAke sirupe of Iuiubes, of Violets and Poppie seeds, of each a like much,
temper them with Barley water: Or take Iuiubes, Sebestes, Violets, white Poppie
seeds, and Quince kernels decocted with Barley water, use it in the evening
after meat; it is passing good.

Item, take sirupe of Poppie seeds, sirupe of Mulberries, of Roses, and Well
water, of each three ounces, wine of Pomegranates one ounce, make it warm, and
gargle therewith.

Losinges.
TAke white Poppie seeds, Purslaine seed, and Lettice seeds, of each one
dragme, Dragagant, Gummi Arabicum and Saffron, of each half a drag. Opium five
grains: powne all that is to be powned, and make it with the sirupe of Poppie
heads to a dow, then make losinges thereof as big as small beans, and hold
one of these in thy mouth. And for this also are commodious these common
losinges, Diapapauer, and the cold Diatragacantha.

Item, take Gummi Arabicum, Dragagant, Starch, Licorice, Quince kernels, and
seeds of Fleawoort, beat all these small together, make thereof as aforesaid
losinges with the muscilage of Fleawoort, and hold them under thy tongue.

Also there may otherwhiles be made for a change the small losinges, called
Bechion, of Diachodion, Diamargariton, and all the sorts of losinges, which are
here worthy to be described.

The preparation of the losinges for the cough and rheum after diverse manners.
THe black losinges are called at the Apothecaries, Bichion, or Bechion, the
which are made after two sorts; to wit, as follows: Take the juice of
Licorice, and Sugar, of each half an ounce, Starch, Dragagant, pilled Almonds,
of each one quarter of an ounce, the Muscilage of Quince kernels, as much as is
needful for to make losinges with it: these do thicken al subtle rheumes, and
delay their sharpness.

Another sort: Take Pine apple kernels that have been steeped a whole night in
Rosewater, and bitter Almonds pilled, of each three quarters of an ounce, juice
of Licorice two ounces, beaten Licorice three drag. make a dow with Rosewater,
and then make thereof losinges: they are very good against the Cough, and
against all raw swellings of the throat.

The white losinges are thus prepared: Take white Sugar, and Sugar candy, of
each a like, Starch the fourth part, beat them all together, and with
Dragagant dissolved in Rose water, make losinges of them.

Item, take six ounces of white Sugar, Sugar candy, and Sugar pennets, of
each two ounces, beaten Ireos three quarters of an ounce, Starch almost five
drag. beat these all together with Dragagant dissolved in Rosewater, and make
losinges of them.

The third manner is this: Take Sugar pennets one ounce, Sugar candy three
quarters of an ounce, Manus Christi without pearls and with Rose water, half
an ounce, fine Bolus one drag. and a half, white Sugar one ounce and a
quarter; make losinges thereof with Dragagant as aforesaid.

If that then need require that these rheumes must be yet more suppressed and
made thicker, then take Starch, Dragagant, pilled Almonds, Bean meal, black
and white Poppy seed, Gum, and fine Bolus, of each a like much: this must you
beat together with the muscilage of Fleawoort or Quinces; and make losinges
thereof.

For to Purge.
Necessity also requires in this sickness for to purge: Decoctio pectorales.
the which is to be begun with the sirupe of Iuiubes and Sebestes, or with the
drink at the Apothecaries called Decoctio pectoralis, the which is thus
prepared: Take Burrage, Buglosse, Violet flowers, of each one drag. Iuiubes and
Sebestes, of each fifteen, Venus hair, Scabious, Folefoote leaves, of each a
handful, Annis seeds two ounces, Figs and Dates, of each five, Licorice cut
small three drag. husked Barley half a handful: let all these sees together
in a pint and a half of water until the third part be sodden away, strain
it, and take the clearest of it, and keep it in a cool place.

Take small cut Licorice one ounce, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each ten, sees
them all together in sufficient water, and make it as abouesaid. In this manner
are there many more made: but these are the commonest.

For purging, take three or four ounces of the first mentioned decoction,
break therein Cassia and Manna, of each one ounce, mingle them together, and
drink it warm, and you may drink a good draught of the two foresaid pectorall
decoctions.

Another purgation. Take Violets and water Lillies, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Damask Prunes ten or twelve, sower Dates one ounce, sees them all
together in eight or ten ounces of water till the half part be consumed: you
are to take three or four ounces of this decoction: temper therein one ounce
of new Cassia, confection of Succo Rosarum, or conserues of Prunes three
dragmes, mingle them, and give them early in the morning.

The third purgation. Take four ounces of broth wherein Prunes are sodden,
steep therein a quarter of an ounce of gross beaten Rubarbe all night, and in
the morning strain them, and temper therewith two ounces of the sirupe of
Roses, and give it fasting in the morning, in the summer cold, and in winter
warm.

But if you had rather have pills, then prepare them thus: Take the shales of
yellow Mirobalans half an ounce, Rubarbe one ounce, Aloe, Diagridion, of each
five drag. Masticke and Licorice of each one scrup. beat them all together
with the muscilage of Quinces unto a mass: you are to take thereof a dragme at
once.

After Purging.
Have regard whether the matter be yet waterie and thin, then are you to give
to the sick body somewhat that is made with Poppie seeds. For this is also
good cold losinges of Dragagant, conserve of Roses and water Lillies, also he
must smell to things that are cold of nature, as Rosewater (the which he must
also draw up into the nose) Camfere, Roses, Saunders, Pomanders of cold
natures, whereof some are described in the sixth part. But if the rheum be
tough and thick, then is all that to be forborne that is made of Poppey heads,
and make this water following: Take dried Hyssope, Licorice, Venus hair, Figs,
Hollihock seeds, and seeds of Mallows, of each a like much, and he shall hold
in his mouth Dragagant with a little loch de Pino.

Because these salt rheumes have some communion with the liver, then is highly
commended for this, strange bathes, that flow from iron or other mines in the
ground.

When this patient will go to bed, then is he to take a quarter or half an
ounce of the conserues of water Lillies, and use also one of these two capital
powders following: Take Mace one quarter of an ounce, red Coral, burnt Iuorie,
red and white Saunders, of each one scrup. Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce,
water Lillies one drag. and a half, Cloves half a drag. temper them together
being all beaten small, and therewith bestrew the crown of the head, and every
other day when you will strew other powder thereon, brush off the first.

This following is more cooling: Take Roses, Myrtle seed or leaves, Coral,
and Butchers broom seeds, of each a like much. This being powdered small, use
it as before.

The order of Diet.
THe best meat that this patient may use (when he is not ouerweake) are paps
of Barley, of Spelt, of Starch, of Oten meal, and always add some Sugar
pennets. In like manner may he eat these herbs following dressed or sod with
other meats: as Spinach, Orage, Purslaine, Mallows, and Beetes, also Melons,
Gourds, Cucumbers. But if he be weak, then is he to eat Kids, Hens, and such
like sodden with these foresaid herbs and mildly salted, rear eggs, Oil of
sweet Almonds, and all small birds are very meet.

The best that he may use for drink is Barley water, or Sugar water, and both
having Licorice sodden in them. Item clean fresh Well water tempered with
sirupe of Roses or Violets. He must wholly forbear wine: but if that will not
be, then must he use a thin wine tempered with a little veriuice.

It is also good counsel for all rheumaticke persons to sleep as little as is
possible, and that with the head upright. The which together with the whole
body must be well covered, and in the mean whiles if any sweat follow, he
must let the same have his course.

It is also thought good, that the forehead, the temples, and the whole breast
be anointed with oil of Violets, water Lillies and Roses, mingled together,
or with each a part: Or that his breast be anointed with oil of sweet Almonds
and fresh Butter. When as the sickness is declining, then is the patients head
to be washed (if ever he used the same) with clear lie, wherein is decocted or
steeped Marioram gentle, Roses, Cammomill, and Melilot, and afterward he is to
be combed, and dried with warm clothes.

Of Rheumes with agues.. 3.
IF in case that through the foresaid remedies the rheum will not be stayed,
which happens often through the abundance of humors, then befalls
oftentimes a cough and ague to follow it, whereby one may well guess, that the
same proceeds of a choleric humor, that lies still hidden in the veins.
Therefore is the letting of blood very needful for this, and especially in the
liver vein. Afterward you must purge the body with Cassia and Manna, or
concerning the same take the counsel of a learned Physician.

For this also must continually be used those Losinges wherein is no Ireos. And
for to take away this hurtful matter of the rheum, it is specially advised,
that the same be derived from the breast into the nose where the same may be the
better euacuated.

To this end, take Ammoniacum half an ounce, small beaten Pellitorie of Spain
one quarter of an ounce, make this with the juice of blew Flower deluce into
dow, and thereof take a little on a knife, and put it in the nose, and
forthwith you shall see the water to run out of the nose. This is a secret.
Item, take the juice of the root of blew Flower deluce one ounce, beaten
Stauesacre and Pieretrum, of each one drag: make some cotton moist herein, and
so put it warm into his nose.

He must also be prevented and kept from eating of flesh, and drinking of wine
as long as the ague and the cough endure. Barley water tempered with Iulep of
Violets and sirupe of Violets must be his drink: for this suppleth, moistneth,
and cools the breast, and makes the matter thicker. But if it proceed of
cold, then are you to boil Venus hair, Hyssope, and Licorice amongst them.

When as then the ague and cough begin to cease (which one may feel as the
drouth and spettle begins to cease) then are you to prepare this water
following: Take five fat Figs, ten Iuiubes, twenty Sebestes, Raisins (the
stones taken out) one ounce and a quarter, Licorice cut small five drag. let
them sees well together in sufficient water. Afterward strain it, and take
thereof three ounces, sirupe of Violets five drag. temper them all together,
and you shall give him this potion, if the rheum proceed of heat: but if it
proceed of cold, and the phlegm or spettle will not be loosed, then sees Venus
hair and Currants with the foresaid things, and leave out the sirupe of Violets.

If the Rheum would not pass through the nose.. 4.
TO conclude, we are to add this following to the rest. If so be this rheum
do stop the nose a great while, and that there is no heat with it, then are
fumes to be used for it. And heed is to be taken, that if the moisture that
issues out at the nose be subtle, sharp or yellow: make a smoke with a
little Sulphur, that has been steeped in a little vinegar, and is dried
again, or with husked Barley or Beans peeled, that were also steeped in
vinegar and are dried again, and beaten to powder. For this also serves
Saunders, and the Fume of Sugar. Or you may prepare this following: Take gross
beaten brimstone one quarter of an ounce, sees it in 8. ounces of red vinegar,
and receive the vapor of into your nose. Or sprinkle the Sulphur with wine, and
lay it on a hot stone.

Item, make a vapor of sodden Barley, water Lillies, and white Poppie seed.
Also you may sprinkle vinegar alone upon an hot iron. For this is also good the
vapor or smoke of Partriges feathers. But if there be no heat nor rednes in
the face, then make a fume of Costus roots and Frankincense. Or take Gith
seeds steeped in wine, and so sprinkle it on a hot stone. Take also Lignum
Aloes, Mastick and Frankincense, of each a like much being powned together, and
receive the vapor thereof. Likewise is commodious for this, Sandaraca steeped
in vinegar, and the same sprinkled on a hot stone, and the vapor thereof
received into the nose. And for as much as there is very much written at this
present of this rheum, and shall be more discovered thereof in the description
of the rheum, of the cough, and pursiuenesse: therefore will we here make an
end of this Chapter.

The third Chapter. Of the foremost part of the Breast, Thorax.
THat which we generally call the Breast, has his beginning there where the
neck ends, downwards unto the lower rib; albeit that Aristotle ascribes
the whole body from beneath under the neck without the arms, even to the
priuities below, unto it: yet this Thorax includes the foremost and hindmost
part of the body, from the neck even to the midriffe. The foremost part is in
the middle of it downwards, somewhat lower and heightened again where the
breasts or paps are; even so in the hinder part down along the back bone it
is lower, and on both the sides higher toward the shoulder blades and ribs.
This place is not altogether bonie like to the scul, nor of one piece, but very
orderly the one with the other intermingled, and filled with bones and muscles:
so that the ribs comprehend and defend behind and before the inward parts, even
as it were with a bulwork. And even as this part of man's body is outwardly
defended with bones: even so are also the inner parts with veins, arteries,
and strong sinews joined together, and fashioned very formally, thereby to
take air into it, and to yield it out again, whereby the heart the lights, and
other parts should be refreshed, and preserved in their estate.

Also the breast (like as other parts of man) is subject to many kinds of
maladies: as partly may be seen in the description of the rheum. For when
these mischievous rheumes fall upon the breast, then do they harm the lights,
stop the wind pipes, make a man pursiue, stinking breathed, much coughing, and
anguish: so that at the last they rid matter and filth, with many more such
accidents, whereby the lights are perished and hurt, whereof afterward more at
large and plainly shall be parcelwise discovered. And to follow our woonted
method, we will first speak of the outward parts of the Breast.

Of women's breasts, milk, and of their diseases.. 1.
THe women's breasts are by nature endued with two kinds of wondrous works: The
first, that through their means the newborn child receives his food, to
wit, from the blood, which through natural warmth is altered and brought into
milk.

The second, that they are a defense and cover of the heart, whereby when they
warm them, they are also in like manner kept warm of the said heart. Even as
our body warmeth the clothes, so do the clothes also keep the body warm.
And this comes more to pass in women than in men, by reason that their
breasts are bigger by ods. The substance of women's breasts is a soft flesh, by
nature spongeous, thereby to draw much moisture unto it. Contrariwise, men's
breasts are hard and clung together, especially in them that are not ouercharged
with fatness: both of them have their nipples in the midst of their breasts:
The which in women are very meet and comely instruments for to give their newborn children their said sustenance. Man's milk.
Otherwhiles also men's breasts do give milk: but this is a token rather of
unable humors than otherwise. Thus to proceed with women's breasts, they are
subject to diverse and sundry accidents. Otherwhiles they grow a great deal
too big, the which seems not only ill, but is also sometimes an occasion of
other diseases. But this comes rather by nature or inheritance, and according
to that one woman is fatter and corpulenter of body than another. But by
nature (as it has been said) they are vessels of milk, whereby in some women
it is too little, and in some too much. Therefore it is very needful to seek a
remedy, how in the one to lessen them, and in the other to augment them. For
where milk is too abundant, there provoke it many kinds of diseases, to
wit, that it does clod and congeale in the breast, whereof hardness, heat,
swellings, canker, woormes, and such like do ensue.

In like manner the nipples do also chop, which brings thereby great anguish
to them that give suck, and infect the children that suck the matter and
blood into their bodies, with sundry sicknesses.

Of the overmuch growing and hanging down of the Breasts.. 2.
WHen as this superfluous and overmuch growing of the breasts happens in hail,
young and plethoricall women, there shall (in my best opinion) the nature be
suffered to have her free course, least by taking them away, some greater
mishap be procured: yet some do counsel for a sure remedy, that if one
anoint the breast with the gall of a Hare, that then they will not grow too
great. Item, take Barley meal, and Goats milk, of each a like much, vinegar
half so much, let them sees well, and be laid on the breast: it is taken for
a certain remedy: in like manner fry Mallows in Sallad oil, and lay it
over the breast.

These things following are yet stronger: Take Hypocistis, the pills and
blossoms of Pomegranates, Acorne cups, and burnt lead, of each three drag.
Allume, Ceruse, the juice of Sloes, and roasted Lentils, of each one drag.
Snailes with their houses burnt, and Southernwood, of each two drag. and a
half: Make a salve thereof with the juice of Plantaine, and therewith anoint
the breast. Item, take Frankincense, Masticke, of each one ounce, sea Muscles
one drag. and a half, temper them together with red vinegar.

All that is taught here does not hinder only the growing of the Breasts, but
also that they be not loose or hanging down: these things may also be used
against the falling down of the Mother, even as in the third part shall be
further declared, in the description of the diseases of the womb or mother.

Pills.
TAke Fern roots, Sarcocolla, and Allume, of each one drag. Sandaraca half a
drag. make five pills thereof with the juice of Ireos, whereof take one, and
fast four hours after it. These pills do not only consume all superfluity,
but also the natural fatness of man's body, if they be oftentimes used.

Secondly, he or she may (if they will) strew beaten Amber upon all their
meat: and if you will have it work better, put the powder in wine; for the
wine carries the force of it very quickly into the veins.

Thirdly, take beaten Gals, Cypers nuts, of each six ounces, Allume prepared,
Iron dross, of each three ounces, sees them together in a good deal of
Tanners lie, and wash therewith meetely warm, and make often wet therewith the
hands, feet, face, and breast with a sponge. The like are you to do also on the
privy members: Or take stamped Henbane seed, sees it in wine, and then lay
the wine over the Breasts. But I cannot counsel you to take this by reason of
his great cold.

Of Milk in general.. 3.
FOrasmuch as this wonderful alteration of the red blood into so fair and
white a color, daily happens in women and also in beasts, therefore is
their force and might accounted the less: nevertheless has God ordained it
for all creatures that are borne alive, for their first and most requisite
nourishment. Of the difference of women and beasts Milk, it is not our meaning
here to discourse: but concerning women's Milk, the yellow is always better
than the white; so is also the same more forcible in brown women then in
white. In Ponto by the River Astaeo it is said that milk in women and in
beasts is black. But without any circumstances, we will only discourse of the
Breasts of women, and of the accidents incident unto them.

Of the want or scarcity of Milk.. 4.
IF women that give suck have want of Milk, then must we search out the cause
thereof: This may proceed sometimes of some hot or dry, or of some cold
quality of the Breast, that the blood which should alter into Milk, be dried
out. Likewise both these infirmities may also be cause of some infection of the
liver, yea and sometimes of the whole body; that if their complexion be too
dry that then the increasing of Milk is not to be effected, but of pure
blood. Item, the want of Milk may also be caused through want of meat, or by
the use of such meats as make much blood: as if they be cold and dry. Much
bleeding (be it by what means soever it will) and the bad digesture of the
stomach and Liver, sore labor, or if the child suck too little, may be a
cause of the want or scarcity of Milk.

The signs of this infirmity are evident and apparent: as when the Breasts
are wrong, and the Milk does not issue forth. Also if the child have not
enough to suck. Item, whenever that the mother which gives suck be
fretting by nature, be lean, be not long since recovered of some long sickness,
sweateth much, and is without all exercise. But if the infirmity do proceed
of bad meats and drinks, it is then good counsel that they do eat good
wholesome meat, that is light of digesture, as Hens, Partridges, Capons, young
Mutton, Eggs, brothes of good flesh, and drink good wine: Some women are
accustomed to increase their milk, that they drink a good draught of milk
wherein Fennel seed has been steeped.

But if the infirmity be through too much bleeding, by what means soever that
the same come to pass, then are you to prevent the same through meet and
necessary remedies, as is sufficiently showed in their proper places. But if
the women be of a hot nature, as full of Cholera, then are they to drink
Barley water, and Almond milk, and to eat Cocks, Hens, and Partriges dressed
with Lettice: also to use cool fruits and their seeds; fish of running waters,
Burrage, Spinach, Goats milk, Cow milk, Kids flesh, and Lamb sodden with
veriuice: they are also to refrain from wrath and sorrow, and to be always
merry.

But if these mothers that do give suck, be flegmaticke of nature, and have
lack of Milk, then is their foresaid meat to be dressed with Saffron, Cucubes,
or Cinnamome, and other spices: also to eat it being sodden with Fennel
roots and seeds, Pistacia, and Pine apple kernels.

Whether the malady do then proceed of heat or not, it is always needful
that the stomach be comforted: for the which these things may serve, as Annis
and Fennel feeds confected; but chiefly Caraway and Comin also confected. To
eat Fennel seed green, helps also greatly for the augmentation of milk.
Likewise Caraway seed, Annis and Fennel seed sodden in water, are very
commodious for this purpose: also to eat green Marioram fasting in the
morning is much commended for the same.

And I cannot here pretermit to rehearse diverse other remedies more, that are
prescribed of others for the increasing of milk, like as hereafter may
appear: Take ten earth woormes, wash them in Wine, sees them in flesh
broth, strain them, and in the morning give thereof a draught to drink. It is
also holden for certain, that if these Worms be dried and beaten to powder,
and if you give to the patient half a dragme to drink in flesh broth, that
thereby the milk will be much increased.

For this also you may take this Plaster following: Take Parsley roots, and
the herbs, Deeres sewet, of each half an ounce, red Storax three dragmes,
new oil of sweet Almonds three ounces, Barley meal one ounce and a half;
let the roots sees well, and stamp them to pap, and then mingle the rest
amongst it, and lay it warm upon the Nipples, for it increases the milk.

Item, take beaten Annis seeds two dragmes and a half, temper them with the
broth of Colewoorts, and give it to the party to drink when she goes to bed.
Item, take Barley water, sees therein green Fennel and Dill, make it sweet
with Sugar, and drink thereof at your pleasure.

The like does Linseede sodden in the broth of fresh meat and drunken. Some
believe, that if a woman do drink a dragme of fine powdered Crystal with
Honey or Barley water, that thereby the milk will maruellously increase. Some
impute the like operation to be in the prepared Sapphire stone, if the same be
tempered with water, and the breasts wetted therewith. I account neither of them
good: but they that will may try them, for the cannot be hurtful.

Against the superfluity of Milk.. 5.
IT comes oftentimes to pass when women have lien in, that their Breasts do
happen to swell through the abundance of milk, and do bring mo inconveniences
with them; namely, that sometimes the whole body thereby wastes: for the
greater abundance there is of milk, so much the more blood is thereby
consumed: if it be not sucked out, then does it clod and cougeale, hardneth and
turns at the last with great pain into an impostume.

The causes hereof are superfluous blood, much eating and drinking, and
especially such kinds of meats as engender blood. Therefore must the same be
in the beginning prevented, and those kinds of meats refrained; and to eat
and drink but little. And in case there be much superfluous blood, then in the
mother vein to be opened, that thereby the blood may be drawn downwards.
Otherwise, there be two means to take away this superfluous blood: The first
mean is through the use of Rue, and chiefly of wild Rue with their seeds,
Basil and Comin stamped together, if one take of them every day one quarter of
an ounce, the same dries the milk.

The herb Rapistrum is very forcible for the same, the which may appear in
Swine: for when they eat of this herb, then are they rid and quit of all
their milk, whereby the Pigges are constrained to sterue. You may also lay
these hot things on their Breasts. But these following are more sure: Take
Rosin as much as you think good, temper it with the Cream of milk, spread it
on a cloth, and lay it lukewarm over the Breasts.

Item, take eight ounces of Honey, and two pints of water, let them sees well
together, and scum it well, and then wet therein a threefolded cloth, and lay
in on the breasts; and when it is cold, take another: this drives away the
Milk.

Item take Chickweede, let it sees in Goats milk, or in water, lay it over
the Breasts. Also the water of Knotgrasse or Venice soap water, are both very
good, used as before.

Item take one drag. of Saffron, eight ounces of Malmsey, wet a cloth therein,
and lay it on the Breasts, as aforesaid. Item, take green garden Mints, stamp
them and mix them with oil of Roses, and do as before. And for this purpose
is the oil of Mints also very good.

Item, take Bean meal mingled with vinegar, and sodden to a pap or grout,
tempered with oil oil of Roses to a plaster, and lay it on the Breasts.

Take Bean meal four ounces, oil of Roses and red vinegar as much as
needs for to make a plaster. Or Bean meal and of Lentils, of each two
ounces, Saffron one quarter of an ounce, oil of Roses as much as is needful:
all which foresaid things do dry up the milk.

For the clotted or congealed Milk in the Breasts.. 6.
THis congealing of the Milk in the breasts may proceed as well of heat, as
of cold: Or that the Milk is too gross, and cannot have passage through the
veins into the Breasts, or cannot be sufficiently sucked out, and there
congealeth, hardens, putrifieth, and impostumateth. The tokens thereof are
manifest, as hardening, inflammation, and pain in that place where the milk
is congealed, that if one do draw or wring the Breast, yet does it give no
Milk at all.

To prevent therefore this congelation, women must keep themselves very sober
in eating and drinking, use moist meats that may make subtle milk. For this
is requisite, Mintes, Parsley, Saffron, and Cinnamome in their meats, and their
drink must be neat white wine, and use commonly this following for the
congealed milk.

Take grated white bread as much as you will, new milk, and oil of Roses, of
each a like much, for to make pap thereof; let these sees together, and lay it
warm upon the breasts; it dissolueth knots and swellings that proceed of
congealed milk. Item, if the milk do pain any body, then take Cork, kindle
it well, and then powne it to powder, temper it with oil of Roses and a little
Vinegar, and therewith anoint the breasts. Or take of the fat of a Kid one
ounce and a half, liquid Styrax one ounce, Wormwood one ounce and a half,
Comin and Dill seeds, of each one drag. Annis seeds half a drag. Barley
meal half an ounce, oil of Wormwood one ounce and a half; temper the rest
amongst it being beaten small; and lastly put a little Saffron to it, and use
it as aforesaid.

This salve following is very good for to dissolve the congealed milk: Take
Deeres sewet three quarters of an ounce, liquid Styrax one ounce, Wormwood,
Comin, and Dill seeds, of each one ounce, oil of Wormwood, Duckes grease, of
each one ounce and a half: make an ointment or plaster thereof, and at the
last add a scruple of Saffron to it.

If this congealing of milk be with an inflammation, and that it were needful
to cool more: then mix the muscilage of Fleawoort, of Fenegreeke, and
Purslaine seeds together, of each a like much: make of them with molten Wax
an ointment, and therewith anoint the Breasts. Item, take Chickweede without
brusing it, apply it warm to the Breasts. Item take the juice of Colewoorts,
of Nightshade, and of Coriander, of each a like quantity: This being mingled
together, lay it with a cloth warm upon the Breasts. Also beat Rose vinegar
and oil of Roses together, use it as before. Likewise Colewoort leaves or
their juice mixed with Saffron eases the pain. Take Fenegreeke meal, and
make a plaster of it with oil of Violets and Vinegar.

But if the Milk be augmented by extreme cold, then take water and wine
together, and lay it on the Breasts. Or boil Cammomill, Melilot, Fennel
seeds, Annis seeds, Dill seeds, Fenegreeke, Linseedes, Southernwood, Ginger
and Basil, which you will, and use it as has bin said, especially if there be
not an Ague with it. That which is sodden may thou beat, and with the oil
of Cammomill make a plaster of it, and so apply it. The Beuercod and his oil
is very good for the same purpose.

And especial good plaster. Take the crumbs of white bread, Barley meal,
Mustard seeds, Fennel, and Hollihocke roots roasted under the ashes, of each
a like much, powne them well together, and with the oil of Cammomill, make a
plaster of them, and apply it warm on the Breasts: it softeneth the hard
knots, dissolueth them, and suffers them not to congeale again.

Item take Mints, and make a plaster thereof with white bread and Vinegar. But
if so be that this congealing grow to an impostume, then make the Breast moist
again (as is already declared) with warm wine and water, also with the
foresaid pap of Mints and crumbs of white bread, or Myrrh mixed with Saffron and
Bread. But if this impediment happen to break, then cleanse it and heal it as
you do other tumors; whereof shortly hereafter you shall have a sufficient
declaration.

For the hardness and inflammation of women's breasts.. 7.
Whereas the Breasts, not through the congealing of the milk, but through other
occasions chance to be hard and inflamed, they which may soon be felt with the
hand, or discerned with the eye: then may you use for the same any of these
things following, which you will.

First lay Rice about four hours long to steep in wine, afterward sees it
well, and lay it on the Breast: Or temper Rice meal with oil of Violets, and
the white of an egg, putting thereto a little dissolved Dragagant. Ite^ take
sifted Bean meals and Barley meal, of each one ounce, Linseed meal and
Fenegreeke meal, of each half an ounce, temper it to a salve with oil of
Roses: Lastly, ad thereto one scruple of Saffron, spread it on a cloth, and so
lay it over the hardness and the whole Breast. Item take Barley meal and
Beans meal, of each three ounces, beaten Comin half an ounce, oil of Violets
one ounce, Deeres suet one ounce and a quarter; make thereof a plaster with
the water of Sorrel: and for this is also to be used that which is described
in the sixth. of the congealing of Milk through heat.

This plaster following is exceeding good: Take the flowers of Mallows,
Violets, Celendine, Daisies, and Cinquefoile, of each a handful; let them
sees together in sufficient water, until there remain eight ounces: then
strain it, and mingle it with wheaten meal, to the consistence or perfection
of a thick pap, then temper with it Hens grease, or Swines suet, and so let it
sees together unto the plaster. This must you spread on a cloth as thick as
a finger, and lay it morning and evening upon the inflamed and sore Breast.

Another. Take Bean meal and powdered Mints, of each three quarters of an
ounce, powder of read Mints half an ounce, prepared Coriander and Pease meal,
of each one dragme, Roses half a dragme, two ounces of fresh butter, muscilage
of Linseede one ounce, muscillage of Fenegreeke three quarters of an ounce,
Sheep suet and Ducks grease, of each one ounce, the yolke and egg, oil of
Turpentine half an ounce, Saffron three grains: temper them all together and
make a salve thereof. Item take the crumbs of two or three white loaves
(according as their bigness is) Sallad oil three ounces, powned Hollihocke
roots one ounce and a half, Fenegreeke meal half an ounce, two yolks of
eggs, oil of Roses and of Cammomill, of each one ounce, mingle them all
together, and lay them upon the Breasts.

Item take earth worms as many as you will, wash them with wine, and burn
them to powder in a tight stopped pot, temper this powder with oil of Roses and
of Lillies, and therewith anoint the Breast, and cover it over with fattie
sheep wool wrapped in a cloth. This maturateth very well and swageth the
pain. This powder is also highly commended, taken with some sweet things,
against the worms is the belly, the weight of a dragme and a half, and is in
like sort very good against the yellow Iaundies.

Of the tumors of swelling of the Breast.. 8.
TAke broad Plaintaine and Purslaine, of each one handful, stamp them to pap,
Commomill, Melilot, of each one ounce, Barley meal four ounces; temper them
being small with oil of Violets and Roses amongst the juice, until it wax to
be a thick salve. And lastly, mingle amongst it half an ounce Gummi Helenij,
dissolved in strong vinegar, spread it on a cloth and lay it on the swelling.

Item, take Salld oil and Cow dung, mingle them and strain them through a
cloth; then put Fenegreeke meal amongst it, until it will serve for a
plaster.

Or take Peach leaves only; or as much Rue with them; stamp them to powder,
let them sees in water until it be a pap: lay it on the swelling: it eases
the pain, and ripeneth the impostume.

This salve is also highly commended: Take Plantaine and Mallows, of each one
handful, the lesser Housleeke six handfuls; let all be sodden green until
it be a growt, strain it out, then add unto it three ounces of the oil of
Roses, beaten Cammomill Melilot, of each one ounce, Barley meal four ounces,
Bdellium, dissolved in vinegar one quarter of an once: let them sees together
unto the consistence of a plaster.

Of the Impostumation of the Breasts.. 9.
THese impostumations do proceeed of two special causes: First, of congealing
of the milk whereof is written already: Secondly, of other bad rheumes that
sink into these parts and there putrify, breeding there diverse accidents: as
namely, the Canker, Kingwoorme, Gangrene, and such like. According to the
nature of the foresaid rheum, it happens also quickly, in women which have
not their Terms, that their Breasts do impostumate by reason of the abundance
of blood, that takes his course thither.

The signs of this grief are, that the woman has not conceived nor can give
suck, that this swelling does not divide it self into many places, but
remains in one place only. If it be caused of blood, than is the Breast full
of pain, with beating and redness. Or if it come of Cholera, then is the
pain greater, the breast redder, and yellowish, and with greater agues and
more heat than that which proceeds of blood. If it be of Phlegma, then is
there small pain, and no ague with it: the Breast is white, with a small tumor.

For to remedy this must the cause be known: If it proceed of blood, then
first of all open the mother vein on the same side where the sore is, for to
withdraw the matter thereby. But if there be any want of the Terms or flowers,
then are they to be provoked by all means possible; and in the augmenting of
the swelling must the Liver vein be opened, or at leastwise the Median:
afterward temper oil of Roses, with Vinegar, and wet a cloth therein, and lay
it four times a day upon it: You may also sees Cammomill therein. Of these
things following you may use which you will.

Take Bean meal, Fenegreeke meal, Linseede meal, and crumbs of white bread,
of each one ounce, Myrrh half an ounce, Saffron one drag. and a half, roasted
Hollihocke roots four ounces, four yolks of eggs, oil of Violets, and
Linseede oil, of each three quarters of an ounce: if it be too hard, then make
it softer with water, and use it till that the swelling be ripened. Or make
this following: Take six ounces of clarified honey, Barley meal two ounces
and a half, two yolks of eggs, Mayrrhe and Sarcocolla, of each half a dragme,
let the honey and the meal seethe together until it be meetly thick, stir
them the yolks of the eggs amongst it, and at last the powder. But if you will
have it more cooling. put thereto three ounces of the oil of Roses, and honey
of Roses four ounces, and six ounces more of Barley meal. This is a
wonderful plaster for to consume and cleanse all swellings, not only of the
breasts, but also of all other members.

Item, take Ireos, as much as you please, cut it small, then put as much oil
Roses thereon as will cover the Ireos root, let it sees very well, and strain
it; afterward put one half ounce of Ireos unto it, oil of Voilets four
ounces, Ceruse, Wax, and Mastick, of each one drag. and therewith anoint the
Breast.

When as then this Tumor is sufficiently maturated, and will break out, then
make pap of Wheat meal, Sallad oil, and common water. If it will not break
out of it felfe, then is it to be opened with a Lanset, and afterward cleanse
it with Honey, the juice of Smallage, yolks of Eggs and Turpentine, and a salve
made thereof. Or take the common salve Vnguentum de Apio mundificatiuum,
Vnguentum de Apio mundificatiuum.
the which is thus to be prepared: Take clarified Honey, and the clear juice of
Smallage, of each one ounce, Wheat meal three quarters of an ounce, temper
them together: This is also good for all Fistulaes and Carbuncles. This Salve
is to be used for any kind of sore, with a Tent or Lint for to cleanse the same.

But if this Tumor be caused of cold, then are all warming oils to be used
thereto, as of Lillies, Spike, and Beuercod, and such like: And you may lay
thereon water of Honysuckles, whereby diverse are helped: but washed with water
of Cardus Benedictus, and the powder of the same strewed thereon, helps above
all others.

All things that are ordained in the first part, the 13. Chapter and 1..
against the uncleanness of the mouth, are also commodious for this. For to
maturate, take six fat Figs, green Cresses, Dock roots, Hollyhock roots,
Lilly roots, Fenegreeke meal, and Linseede meal, of each one ounce, let them
sees well to a pap, stamp it well together, and temper it with three ounces
of Barrowes grease, this swageth the pain, and ripeneth exceedingly. When as
this impostume is sufficiently ripened, open it with a Lanset in the lower part
of the same, or with a Corsie, afterward cleanse and heal it, as you do all
other impostumes.

For the Canker in the Breasts.. 10.
HItherto has only bin spoken of the impostumes and tumors of the breasts,
whereof otherwhiles do spring and grow the Canker, Fistulaes, and other
inconuenie^ces: but here will we only discourse particularly of the Canker,
worm, and Fistula of the breasts. For the sore which the Chirurgians call the
worm, this is their common plaster: Take Rye and Wheat meal of each alike
much, temper amongst it about one third part of burnt Copper powdered small, and
make a dough thereof with Rose water, spread it on a cloth, and lay it warm
thereon; but this avails not much, a better way must be taken to cure this
malady, and so to withstand this Canker or worm. First, it is very needful
that the patient at least thrice a month be purged of melancholicke humors,
that he keep a good diet in meat and drink, and use always such things as
are somewhat cooling, and very much moistening. Also he must eschew all sharp,
salt, windy, and fat things, and such as are soon corrupted in the stomach,
and chiefly from all that increases Choleram, and Melancholiam. For to prevent
this, prepare this drink following.

Take Thymus one quarter of an ounce, the roots of Polypody and Seen, of each
one dragm, the seeds of Gourds, Cucumbers, Pompeous beaten, and Violets, of
each one dragme and a half, Cinnamome, yellow Rapeseede, of each one scruple,
let them sees altogether in eight ounces of Hopwater even to the half,
strain it, afterward take of this clear decoction and temper therewith three
ounces of the whay of Goats milk, and so drink it warm, and fast six hours
after it.

Secondly make this plaster following: Take Fenegreeke and Barley meal, of
each two ounces, Mallows 3. handfuls, of great Housleeke 8. handfuls, of small
Housleeke 4. handfuls of the oil of Roses six ounces, brayed in a leaden
mortar: sees the herbs in whay, afterward beat them altogether to pap, and
temper the other things amongst it. Then let it sees again in six ounces of
the water of Nightshade until it be sodden away. The patient is first to
anoint the sore with oil of Roses that is brayed in a leaden mortar, and
afterward let him lay this plaster following upon the sore, and the foresaid
oil must be also prepared.

Take one pound of the oil of Roses, put it into a leaden mortar, and bray it
with a leaden pestell three or four hours long. This plaster cools,
swageth the pain, and preserves one from all other corrosion.

Thirdly, if this Canker corrode any further, then must it by two manner of
ways be hindered: first, by laying somewhat on the sore: secondly, by applying
somewhat about the sore. The first shall be prepared as follows.

Take Barley meal four ounces, of the oil of Violets, oil of Roses, prepared
with lead, of each three ounces, four whites of Eggs, prepared Tutty two
ounces, Bloudstones that be stamped ten times in a leaden mortar, with the
water of water Lillies one ounce, afterward bray the whites of Eggs a great
while with the oil tempered amongst the Barley meal: and lastly, the Tutia,
and Bloudstone, and then therewith anoint small taints, and lay them on the
sore.

The Second.
TAke of the foresaid oil of Roses prepared with lead one ounce and a half,
the juice of Nightshade two ounces, Starch one ounce, fine Bolus one ounce and
a half, sealed earth two ounces, temper them all together in a leaden mortar,
and therewith anoint round about the Canker or disease of the breast.

Of the Fistula of the Breasts.. 11.
IF this or any other sore of the breast would turn to a Fistula, then look
what has been said in the first part the seventh Chapter and 11.. of the
Fistula of the eyes: likewise that which is written in the third Chapter and
fifth part, of the impostumes of the arsegut, wherein you shall find sufficient
remedies.

Of the Clefts or chops of the Nipples.. 12.
TAke fresh molten suet of young Lambs powered on water, and afterward washed
with water of Roses as much as you please, and therewith anoint the Nipples.

Item, take Gum of the Cherrie tree, and Frankincense, of each one ounce,
Wax and Gum of each half an ounce: melt the Wax with one ounce of fresh
butter or Barrowes grease, then mingle the rest amongst it, and use it as
aforesaid.

Take oil of Violets and oil of Eggs, of each three dragms, Hearts sewet and
Goats sewet, of each one quarter of an ounce, make as much as is needful for a
salve.

Here before in the first part, the tenth Chapter and 1.. there are set forth
two good salues, that do also serve well for this purpose.

Take a white Lilly leaf out of his oil, and lay it on the Nipples, it is
very good.

All these foresaid means cannot hurt the child, although it do suck at the
same breasts.

What the hair on the Breasts does signify.. 13.
THe Philosophers do agree all together in this, that al they that have no
hair on their breasts, or very little, are more timorous, fearful, and much
slower of nature, than they be that have much hair upon their breasts, who are
at all times more manly, stout, and courageous.

The fourth Chapter. Of the Back in general.
ON the upper parts of the Rumpe is the backbone, which (as is said) stands
deep into the body about the shoulders and ribs: but on both the sides is
the back somewhat higher. This begins at the neck, and reaches downwards
even to the fundament. Four and twenty sundry bones are imputed unto it, the
which the Greeks do call Spondyli, and the Latinists Vertebras, and in our
language, the chine or back bones. The neck has seven, which are less then
all the rest.

The back has twelve: five stand also close to the loins, whereon the last
and utmost piece of the back bone is fastened, which is called the Rump, in
Latin Cauda, or the Tail, which is joined together of three pieces, and is a
Gristle or Tendrell.

The foresaid pieces of the backbones are all hollow within, filled with
marrow, the which is not much unlike the brains in substance, and yet an
offspring and beginning of all hard sinews.

This substance of the brains may be assimilated to a plentiful fountain,
whereof many small brooks and diverse streams do flow, which we call Sinews,
whereby we have both motion and feeling.

These Sinews are about threescore, which do come all of them (each through
his own passage) from the backbone, and spread themselves into all the members
of man's body, where they cause both moving and feeling.

From them do the hands and feet, all parts of the face, and the bowels (the
instruments of the voice only excepted) receive their sinews, whereby they do
move and are holden together.

Therefore does it also happen, that whenever any of these Chinebones,
through the which the sinews do pass, are wrinched or bruised, either by
falling, striking, or any other way, some parts are thereby lamed, lose their
sense and feeling, and otherwhiles deadly diseases are thereby procured, even
as it is mentioned in diverse places of this book, so that we purpose not to
discourse here of any other thing, but of the pain or ach in the back, and of
the crookednes of the same.

Of the pain in the Back.. 1.
THis pain in the back proceeds of Rheumes that fall into the sinews of
the muscles, or of great labor, and such like occasions, for the which these
things following are good.

Take Mugwoort, Melilot, and Cammomill, of each one handful and a half,
Melilot seeds heated in a pan, four M. the herbs and flowers chopped small,
mix them all together in a little bag, and lay them warm upon the back
bone, use it often and that fasting.

Afterward, anoint the back bone with this salve: Take oil of Spike, oil
of Lillies, of each half an ounce, oil of Cammomill and Dill, of each one
ounce, Saffron, Lauanderspike, Madder, and Agrimonie, of each one dragme,
Mastick and Squinant, of each one scruple, Wa^ as much as is requisite for to
make a salve.

Item, sees Nep in your meat, which draws the noisome and grievous matter
out of the neck, it drives also away all pain in the shoulders and back
bones maruellously, if it be stewed in the said broth.

In like manner take Siluermountaine seed, sees it in water, and drink
thereof twice or thrice a week, every time three or four ounces, for it is
very good against all weariness, and pain in the back and reins.

Anoint the backbone with Bears grease: Also the oil of a Fox is effectual
against all pains of the backbone, reins, kidneys, and Gowt, the which is
thus to be prepared.

Oil of a Fox
Uncase or fley off the skin of a young Fox, take out his bowels, and cast
him in fountain water, and sea water or salt water. Put thereto three pounds
of Sallad oil, Salt three ounces. When it is almost sod, then put unto it Dill
and Thymus, of each twelve ounces, let it sees together till the flesh fall
from the bones, and when all the water is sodden away, then strain it.

The oil of Brickes, which is described in the first part, is also passing
good for this, either by it self, or when it is tempered with some other
things.

Of the pain in the backbone that proceeds from the kidneys, of the gravel
and other things more, shall be spoken elsewhere.

Of the crooked Back.. 2.
THere are three sorts of this: The first does come before, the second behind,
and the third grows on the left or right side. Children are more subject to
this disease then aged folk, by reason that their bones be feebler, easier to
be wrested and wrung out of their natural place. This happens of inward and
outward causes. The outward be falls, blows, stripes, ill handling of young
children, racking and such like bad dealing with young tender children. The
inward causes do come of the Crampe, contraction of the sinews, abundant wind,
rheumes, smellings and such like, that setle themselves in the back bone, and
do thrust and wrench awrie the young weak bones.

The signs of the Crampe, that comes through great inanition, is manifested
and apparent by the consumption and faintness of the whole body. The signs of
the windiness are, if the patient that has the crook Back have much griping
and contractions in the Back. If there be any impostume approaching, then is
there great pain in the back, or in some certain place of the same, with a
strong Ague and vehement pulse. But if there be but one of the Back bones
wrested out of his place, then must it needs follow, that the Ribs which are
fastened therein, be also drawn overthwart, whereby the body must be crooked,
and the shoulder blades raised, the which makes an unhandsome breast and
uncomely body, as daily experience teaches us.

Now to prevent this mischance betimes, it is first counseled for all young
folks and children, as follows: so that at all times according to the age (as
much as is possible) every one may know how to frame himself thereafter.

Take Comin, Caraway, Fennel, and Annis seeds, of each two handfuls, Rue
seeds three handfuls, Bran six handfuls; make it all together very warm in a
pan on the hot ashes, put it then all together into a dry bag, and lay it upon
the place where the pain is: and when the place is well warmed, then anoint it
with this salve following. Take muscilage of Fenegreek and of Linseed, of each
one ounce, oil of white Camelina, oil of sweet Almonds, oil of blew Flower
deluce, of each one ounce and a half, Plaster de Muscilaginibus, (which in
the first Part the sixth Chapter and seventh. is described) four ounces; melt
this with Wax as much as is needful: Lastly, add unto them two scruples of
Saffron: do this four days together. Afterward must the crook Back be
bounden together with bolsters and other things, as need shall require, and
renew the binding every morning: Or else without putting the child to pain, do
this six days one after another; and this being done, return to the laying
on of the bag, and anointing with the foresaid salve, which shall be also used
four days together: afterward lay this plaster following upon the Back
bone and shoulder that is wrenched.

Take of the foresaid plaster de Muscilaginibus two ounces, Oxycrocei plaster
one ounce and a half, spread these upon a cloth or leather, and lay this
plaster thereon, bind it very carefully as aforesaid, and let it lie so six
days without opening of it. The Oxycrocei plaster is also good for this by it
self, and profitable, which you may also find always ready at the
Apothecaries, like as is here described after three manner of ways.

The plaster of Oxycroceum is thus prepared: Take Wax, Pitche, Rosin,
Saffron, Oxycroceum.
of each one ounce and a half, Turpentine, Galbanum Ammoniacum, Myrrh,
Frankincense, and Masticke, of each half an ounce, Vinegar one ounce, dissolve
therein the Ammoniacum and Galbanum, then sees them so long until they become
thick, and until that the vinegar be sodden away, then melt herewith the
Wax, Pitche, and Turpentine, but the Masticke, Frankincense, and Myrrh shall
you temper herewith first beaten small; when this is mingled all together, then
strew the Saffron therein, and mingle them al together very well.

Item, take Ammoniacum, Sagapenum, Galbanum, of each half an ounce, Pitch
four ounces, Rosine, Wax, of each six ounces, Masticke, Frankincense, and
Myrrh, of each one quarter of an ounce, Turpentine three ounces, and Saffron
half an ounce; and make it up as aforesaid.

Oxycroceum Vigonis.
TAke eight ounces of Sallad oil, Hollihocke roots, the lesser Consolida
roots, of each half a handful, Myrrh, Frankincense, of each one dragme,
Roses one dragme and a half: you are to cut and sees the herbs and roots in
red wine and water until half be consumed: strain them hard out, and in this
decoction boil the oil, put thereto also Buckes suet two ounces: afterward
sees it again so long until all the moisture be sodden away, then put
thereto three ounces of Lytharge of gold, Bolus, sealed earth, of each two
ounces, red Lead one ounce and a quarter, Wax one ounce, and whilst it is hot
ad unto it two ounces of Turpentine, Masticke one drag. and lastly, whilst it
is soft, put thereto one ounce and a half of powned Saffron, as is before said.
This last is maruellously used of the Chirurgians. They are all of them not
only good against the crook back, but also for all fractures, and other
members which are pained, and they mollify and consume all hardness.

It is also good for these children sometimes to drink the water of
Southernwood, of Hollihockes, of blew Flower deluce, of each one ounce
tempered, and to use three days after one scruple of this powder following:
Take half an ounce of the seeds of Smallage, one dragme of Comin, Parsley
seeds, Annis seeds, and Licorice mixed, of each two scruples.

And you may give the patient to eat after meat, a piece of the Confection of
Pistacium or Cinnamome.

And there is to be strewed upon his meat some of this powder following: Take
half an ounce of good Cinnamome, Licorice, and Hollihocke seeds, of each
half a scruple, Saffron one scruple, stamp them all together, and mingle them
one amongst another.

If this patient be but ten or twelve years old, then were it very good twice
in a week, always before supper, that he swallow one of these pills
following: Take prepared Aloe one dragme and a half, Bdellium half a dragme,
Smallage seeds half a scruple, and make seven pills of a dragme.

But if on an aged body there grow a crooked back, then must he use the pills
of Hermodactilis, Foetidae, or Cochiae to purge withal. All the meats that he
is to use, must be hot unto the second, and dry in the first degree, therefore
must his chamber be always kept with a fire of Firwood, Juniper wood and such
like, that must burn therein, and to fume the same with Bay leaves, white
Mints, Penniroyall, Styrar, Laudanum, Cypers wood, Gallia Muschata, Sandaraca,
Lignum Aloes, Frankincense, Masticke, and such like, each alone, or tempered
together. He must forbear cloudie weather, rain, and dewes, and use no
exercise: also he must not sleep much, nor lie much on the same side of the
crooked back, and he must refrain lying upon his back, that his breath be not
thereby painful to be drawn: watching is also ill for him.

Further, he must forbear all that is made of meal: but Kids flesh, Mutton,
Hares, Roe dear, and young Bears flesh are very good for him, and specially
if the same be dressed with garden Mints, wild Mints, wild Thime, Parsley, and
Balm.

Of fowls these be good for him, Hens, Capons, Pullets, young Pigeons, Fesants,
Partriges Turtle doves, and wild Pigeons, either boiled or roasted, being dressed
with the foresaid herbs. He may also eat roasted Duckes, and also all field
fowls: but Quails (by reason of their moisture) he shall leave. Fish is not
good for him, and especially those that be sodden, except they be dressed with
the foresaid herbs: but being roasted they are for his disease most meet,
except Eeles, Crabs, Mussels, Oysters, the which very seldom are to be used:
and he must forbear all Beans.

All herbs of cold natures are hurtful for him, as Lettice, Burrage,
Purslaine, Spinach, etc.

Of all seeds he may use them that are of a warm nature, as Comin, Caraway,
Annis seeds, Parsley seed, Cardamome, and Greines.

Touching roots, the wild and tame yellow Rapes or Turnips, and also all other
Turnips may he use: but he must beware of Onions, Garlic, and Radishes.

No herbs of cold natures are meet for his sallads, neither yet Capers; but
Rapunculu^, Sperage, Hop sprigs, may pass well enough, dressed rather with wine
then with vinegar. Salted or powdered Veriuice, the juice of Limons, and juice
of Orenges be tolerable: but he must beware of eager Vinegar, and Pomegranate
wine. He may use all manner of spice (but soberly always in his meat) he must
forbear all cold and new fruit, as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Peaches, etc.
but in the stead thereof he may eat Raisins, dried Figs, Almonds, and Hasell
Nuts.

His drink must be small Beer, or some thin well sauouring wine, he may water
the wine with some water, wherein Cinnamome or Licorice has been decocted. But
above all other, it were good for him (if he can come by it) for to use from
the midst of September to the midst of March, this drink following, or at
leastwise temper his wine therewith.

Take Well water seven quarts, clear Honey four and twenty ounces, Ammy
flowers, and Marioram gentle, of each one drag. Basil seed half a drag.
Artichoke roots three drag. Rue seeds two scruples, shauing of Licorice and
Annis seeds, of each three drag. let the water and honey sees together till
there be about two quarts sodden away, letting it remain still all a night,
and in the morning make it hot again and strain it through a cloth, preserve
it being stopped close, for it will do him good.

The learned do give counsel accordingly, that every such patient must purge
twice a year, to wit, in the beginning of Summer, and beginning of Winter, and
that according as a learned Physician shall advise him.

Further, for this disease of the crooked back are two things to be regarded:
first, that it do not increase: secondly, how to take away the same. For which,
this plaster following is to be made.

Take oil of Cammomill, oil of Lillies, and Althea salve, of each one ounce,
oil of Foxes one ounce and a half, oil of Spike one quarter of an ounce, soft
Stirax one quarter of an ounce, Cypers, Sage, Marioram gentle, Squinant,
Stechas, Wormwood, Melilot, and Linseede, of each half a handful, prepared
Earthwoormes, and Nutmegs, of each one ounce, Hollihockes, half an ounce,
sees these all together in a pint of Wine unto the half, then strain it
through a cloth, and make a hard plaster thereof with Wax and Turpentine.

But before this plaster is to be laid upon it, the crook back must be well
fomented with this following: Take Hollihocks two handfuls, Calmus half an
ounce, Mallows, Cammomill, Dill, Linseede, and Melilot, of each one handful,
Spike, Squinant, Fennel, Comin, Wormwood, and Stechas, of each half a
handful, cut them small, and let them sees well.

And it were also very good that he used these pills all the year, take
prepared Aloe one ounce, Opopanacum, Sagapenum, of each half a dragme, temper
them all with the juice of Roses, take one pill thereof about the fourth day
every evening before meat: and if so be that he do take twice a month the
weight of one dragme of these pills one hour after supper, it is very good for
him and good advice.

These confections following shall also be prepared for him: Take Betonie,
Stechas, An especial remedy against the crook back.
Marioram gentle, Bdellion, Mastick, Rue seed, and Cinamome, of each one
quarter of an ounce, powned Calmus three dragmes, roots of Artichokes one
dragme and a half, red and white Behen, Saffron and Nutmegs, of each three
scruples, Licorice four scruples, Honey of confected Ginger twelve ounces, and
white Sugar two ounces, whereof take throughout the whole year before meat the
quantity of a Nutmeg. And this is a special mean whereby this disease may be
helped. But if the patient cannot take of it every day, yet is he
notwithstanding to use the same every third day, or twice a week.

Many things commodious for the crook back.
SEcondly, all these things following are good for this crook back, Zeduary
chewed, or laid upon the outside, likewise Calmus be it confected or otherwise
used, Centory is very good for all infirmities of the sinews, howsoever they
be.

Gum Sagapenum in manner of a plaster laid thereon, or anointed therewith,
is very forcible for it. Muscilage of Fenegreeke made with lie, and the
shoulders and all the backbone rubbed therewith. Sulphur baths alone have
oftentimes brought that to pass, through a hole whereby the vapor may come
against the back. The decoction of Sperage being drunken, is very good for
this.

A good salve. Take oil of Bricks one ounce, oil of Costus half an ounce,
the plaster Ceroneum Nicolai three ounces, temper them together, and therewith
anoint the backbone for the space of one whole month when one goes to bed:
then cover it with sheep wool.

Betony sodden in all meats is very commodious, or a dragme thereof powdered
drunken with Honey water. The roots of Briony sodden, and the decoction thereof
used for Clisters, is also very good, and the whole backbone fomented or bathed
therewith.

Of the shoulder blades.. 3.
THe shoulder blades do suffer sometimes great pain, and that through many
kind of causes, like as through any choleric or phlegmatic humors that be
mingled with some blood, and fall down into the shoulder blades, and there
provoke pain, that spreads it self afterward into other members, which is
known by feeling and handling of it. For this, make this salve following: Take
oil of yellow Violets one ounce and a half, of Costus one ounce, burnt
Iuorie, red and white Saunders, and Roses, of each one dragme, Starch one ounce
and a half, Saffron one scruple, yolks of eggs two scruples, stamp all small
that are to be stamped, and temper it in a mortar.

Item, take muscilage of Fleawoort, Starch, of each one ounce and a half,
Saffron one scruple, Roses, seeds of Plantaine, Sorell, and small Endive, of
each half a dragm, and the yolks of two eggs, stamp all these small together,
and then make them into a salve, and when you will use it, then let the
shoulders be first well rubbed, and warm the salve. These things be also very
good for all pains of the backbone and of the kidneis. For this also serves
the salues of Aragon, and Marciaton, oil of Saffron, oil of Foxes, and
Badgers grease, of each alike much tempered together.

In like manner also the oil of Pieretrum, oil of Euphorbium tempered
together, or each apart, do serve well for all old pains, for they are very
hot. Further, all that is very commodious which purges the head; Cupping, or
boxes set on the shoulders, being anointed with this salve following: take
unripe Sallad oil one ounce, oil of Euphorbium half an ounce, parched Salt
beaten small one quarter of an ounce, and temper al together. If there come any
such pain with any vehemency whereby the sleep is hindered, then take oil of
sweet Almonds, oil of Cammomill, of each half an ounce, oil of yellow Violets
one ounce and a half, Ducks grease, Badgers grease, and Saffron, of each one
dragme, make a salve thereof with Wax. Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Dill
seed, Ameos, Balm, and Marioram gentle, of each one ounce, let it sees well,
and put it together in a bladder, or (which is more commodious) into a sponge,
and so lay it warm upon it. Or take Colewoort leaves, Betonie and Balm, of
each three handfuls, Bean meal two ounces, Wheat meal and Linseed meal, of
each one ounce and a half, Saffron one dragme, and two yolks of eggs: Sees
the herbs until they be soft, then stamp them all together, and lay them on
all together, as is done with other plasters.

Of the Ribs.. 4.
AFter the said backbone and shoulder blades, there follows amongst the
outward members of the uppermost parts of the body ye Ribs, whereof by nature
there are twelve on each side, which is together four and twenty. The
uppermost fourteen do meet together, whereby they join themselves in the
backbone and on the breast, and become as it were one bone. The lowermost five
of each side are named the short ribs, and there is not one man amongst a
thousand, that has 11. or 13. ribs in one side.

When as then the Ribs through any outward cause, shall be thrust or broken out
of their natural places, or else rotten through any long continued impostume,
the Chirurgians must be entertained for them, unto whom I commit them; yet
notwithstanding, these two remedies following are highly commended. If then any
body have broken or sprung a rib, then take Elecampane roots, roasted amongst
the ashes, beat them to growt, raw Honey, Butter, Horsgrease and Althea salve,
of each a like much, let it sees well together: Secondly, use one of the
foresaid plasters of Oxycroceo, and lay it over the ribs. Under and about the
ribs comes the most perilous sickness Pleuritis, which is the Pleurisy, of
Pleura, whereby the Greeks call the ribs, whereof we will now write.

Of the Pleurisy, Pleuritis, a sickness, with great pricking in the side.. 5.
THis sickness is described by Galen as follows. Pleuritis is a pain of the
side or of the ribs, which is spread abroad in the skin that covers the
ribs, even to the shoulders, with Agues, pricking pain, cold, short breath,
and cough. He does further describe the same sickness in another manner,
saying: the Pleurisy comes in the skin that covers the ribs, with an
inflammation of all the muscles thereabouts, with a strong Ague and with such
pain, as though the whole ribs were thrust through with bodkins, with shortness
of breath, slow pulse, which afterward increases, with a vehement cough,
sometimes without avoiding any thing, and otherwhiles by casting out of bloody
matter.

These manners of Pleurisies the learned do call Incoctas Pleuritides, which is
unripe Pleurisies. It seems also sometimes that this pain does stretch it
self even to the throat, and is always with a strong ague and pricking in
the side, whereby there follows of necessity a shortness of breath. But this
Pleurisy brings with it no spettle, and there is no other difference
between it and the other Pleurisy, the which may be only differenced thereby,
that at the last nothing is coughed up.

All they then that have the Pleurisy without spetting, they will be plagued
with a dry cough. Their pulse is faint, and shows no inflaming in the
breast, and there is no strong ague, nor any combrous breath therewith: and
when one does wring the patient in the place of the pain, then will he feel
pain; and by reason that there is no humor which may be enflamed in the breast,
from the beginning, but in the outward muscles only, which humor being
afterward ripened, shows it self outwardly as an impostume, the which may
be opened outwardly. Thus much testifies Galen in this matter, whereby his
successors do conclude, that there be two kinds of Pleurisies, to wit, a right
and a bastard Pleurisy. Of the true Pleurisy has here been spoken: the
bastard Pleurisy is called that, which is opened on the outside. But we will
in these and more other subtle descriptions not use many circumstances.

First, there are many causes of these Pleurisies. The outward causes may be
unnatural heat or cold, much exercise, Northern winds, even as these
sicknesses do reign more in winter than summer, superfluous drinking of cold
water or wine, carrying of heavy burdens, falling, straining, striking, and
after great heat to come suddenly into the cold, as also by drinking much
Must. The inward causes proceed by repletion of the whole body, and always
most (above all other humors) through Cholera, afterward of blood, thirdly of
Phlegma, and very seldom of Melancholia.

In like manner, wind may breed this false Pleurisy, the which may hereby be
known, to wit, through anguish of the side without coughing, or with some
small cough: and if the place be wrung or touched, then will it cause pain,
that so swells otherwhiles and rankleth, that it breaks out outwardly, or
that it must be opened on the outside.

The true tokens of the Pleurisy you heard out of Galens own words: but that
it may be known of what humors it proceeds, is to be marked by these words
following; in that of Cholera the urine is yellow and thin, the pulse hard,
swift, and continuing, the pain is great and pricking, the whole body
yellowish, the spettle mingled with a little rednes, there is much thirst
approaching, with bitterness of the mouth, and no sleep, with diverse other
accidents more, which Cholera commonly causes.

But if the Pleurisy do proceed of blood, then is the urine red and thick,
the spettle ruddie, the veins full, the pricking pain is not so big, but
there is drouth and anguish with it, the mouth is always sweet, the forehead
and eyes are always heavy, the patient is young of years and full of blood.

The tokens of Phlegma are, when the spettle is white, when the pain is not
too great, when there is but little thirst, and much sleep therewith, the
urine is bleake, slow pulse, and other signs more that Phlegma accustometh to
bring with it. The Melancholia causes the spettle to be a little leaden
colored, wherewith is no soreness or continual pain.

In like sort, there are certain tokens of life or death. The signs of death
are these, when no remedies will help, and all accidents, as pain, pricking,
shortness of breath daily increase: and contrariwise, it is a token of life,
when all they diminish. Commonly the stitch in the left side is more perilous
than that in the right side, for that it is nearer the heart. But to come to the
remedies, then will we first take in hand the Pleurisy which proceeds of
heat and of blood.

Of the Pleurisy of heat and blood.. 6.
WHen as any body gets a pricking pain about the ribs in the side, with a
cough and an Ague, then must he first use this Clister following: Take 16.
ounces of broth wherein a Lambs head or Calves feet be sodden. Put therein
one ounce of flight Sugar, the yolke of one Egg, two ounces of Sallad oil,
Salt one dragme and a half, temper them all together. If need be to make a
strong Clister, Take Pompeon seed, Cucumber seed, and Gourds, of each half a
handful, Purslaine seed and Lettice seed powned together, of each one
dragme, Mallows, Beetes, Violets, and Mercury, of each half a handful; sees
them together in sufficient water even to the half part; then take of this
decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, and temper therein oil of Violets three
ounces, Electuarium de Psyllio two ounces, Cassia and Tho. Sugar, of each half
an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce; and set it warm.

In like manner it is needeful to let blood with speed. Therefore is the liver
vein to be opened, and that (like as all learned and also Galen himself
teaches) in the same side where the pain is: for this helps very soon, and
the other very slowly. But Rasis makes this difference: If that the patient be
full of blood, then first must ye vein be opened in the side where there is no
pain, and that not only once, but also oftentimes, even as the sickness does
require, and the malady does continue, the which may be forty days
continually. But if there be great weakness or any other occasion at hand,
that one durst not open the vein, then at the least set cups or boxes under
the pain with much pricking, as the cause imports. And after letting blood,
the^ anoint the place of the pain or Stitch with oil of Cammomill, oil of
Dill, or with this salve following, the which is stronger: Take oil of sweede
Almonds, oil of Violets, and unsalted Butter, of each one ounce, Althea salve
half an ounce, muscilage of Hollihocks, and of Frankincense, of each half an
ounce, Wax as much as is needful: anoint the place therewith where the
stitch is, and afterward lay this plaster thereon: Take roasted Hollihocke
roots three dragmes, Violets and Cammomill, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Barley meals three quarters of an ounce: Temper them together with the oil of
Cammomill and Violets as much as is needful for a plaster, and lay it warm
on the place of the pain: It swageth the pain, and the stitch that proceeds
of hot Cholera.

Another that is also very good.
TAke dry Violets, red Saunders, Barley meal, the seeds of Mallows, Bran,
Cammomill, and Melilot, of each a like much, powne all that is to be powned,
and make it with oil of Cammomill and Wax to a plaster. And if therewith the
pain do not cease and swage, then put Bean meal, Fenegreeke meal, and
Linseede meal unto it, of each one quarter of an ounce, and one Fig or twain:
and use this so long, until the pain (as may seem to the eye) be delayed and
swaged, and until the spettle avoid more easily.

The order of diet.
ALbeit that the abstinence from eating and drinking is very highly commended
of all old Physicians, who have commanded for the first three or four days
only Barley water to be used: yet is the custom of our country and nature,
not to observe it so strictly: but (according to their command) to keep all
possible abstinence, is very good advice, yet in such manner, that nature,
as well through such great abstinence, as by reason of the sickness it self,
be not ouerthrown. Others do prescribe as follows: If the sick body the first
or second day do cough up no phlegm, then is he to be kept with Barley water
only: But if he has been purged and let blood, then shall he at noone drink
Barley water, or the decoction of red Pease: At night he is to be fed with the
crum of white bread, that is steeped in sugared Almond milk, and after it to
drink a good draught or twain of Almond milk. When as he cougheth up much
phlegm, then may he eat well of a sugared Pomegranate, and so moderate himself
three or four days. Afterward, when the phlegm begins to be white or red,
and to come easily, then may one let him sup up a little broth of a Pullet,
with a little Saffron, which strengthens the heart and ripeneth phlegm. Is the
matter cold? then let a little Hyssope and Parsley roots be sodden therein. For
a cold Pleurisy a little wine may be well afforded, the which in a hot
Pleurisy is not to be permitted. After the seventh day must his meat be the
broth of Pullets, Barley pap, stued Raisins, Figs, Prunes that are always
dressed with a little Saffron, or Parsley roots. Sometimes also are good broyled
river fish, and roasted Pullets or Chickens permitted.

And when as the Ague has clean forsaken the patient, then may he eat
measurably Pullets, Partridges, Capons, Turtle doves, Pigeons, Rabets, and rere
eggs, until he have thoroughly recovered his health. He must also keep himself
always warm, and to sweat a mornings: he may otherwhiles for pleasure eat
Raisins, Figs, Pine apple kernels, and also two or three Dates, yet he must
always have regard that he keep a soluble body: and to this end these herbs
following are to be dressed and used; as Spinach, Orage, Burrage, Lettice,
Violets and Mallows, with Almond milk, the which is good also for all hot
coughes: Sheep feet sodden very mellow are passing good for him. His bread
must be wheaten or barley well baked; soppes of bread and Almond milk with
Sugar pennets, are very meet for him. Contrarily, he must abstain from
Vinegar, Veriuice, and all sour and salt things; and likewise from eating and
drinking too much. Also from smoke, wind, loud crying, wrath and sorrow, and
above all, is carnal copulation hurtful. Hereafter have you yet many more
potions that serve for such hot Pleurisies. Wine must be for this utterly
forborne, and in stead thereof he must be cherished with Almond milk, or with
sugared Barley water, the which for all Pleurisies is much used and commended.
And it is principally to be dressed in this manner: Barley water.
Take pilled Barley one pound, wash it very clean, afterward power nine pound
of water unto it, and let it sees even to the half; then strain it through a
cloth. This is good for all infirmities of the breast: it loses phlegm, and
withstandeth the Ague.

Some do sees with this barley water, Figs, Iuiubes, Currants or Licorice, and
such like, every one according to his own pleasure. Some do take vine Snailes
out of their shells, and sees them with the Barley water, which cause the tough
slime in the breast to avoid and drive it out. For dainty folks you may
prepare this decoction: Take a Hen or a Pullet, sees therewith a good handful
of Barley until the flesh go from the bones, strain it, and temper it with
the foresaid Barley water. Item, take white bread crumbs, bind them in a fine
cloth, steep them in Barley water, strain them often thorough, and put thereto
as much Sugar as you please.

Item, take pilled Barley half a handful, Iuiubes, Sebestes, of each ten, or
in their stead five Figs, one ounce and a half of Raisins, Licorice and
Currants, of each half an ounce, cut all that is to be cut by a mild fire in as
much water as you think good. Or take Licorice cut small three quarters of an
ounce, Currants two ounces, Sugar candy one ounce, Barley a good spoonefull, and
a pint of water or as much as you will, let it sees till about the third part
remain, and use it as above.

To every such patient is not only forbidden wine, and other things, but also
spices, Mustard, Garlic, hard and old flesh, Eggs, Cheese, Milk, and all that
is dressed therewith, he must forbear all fruits and herbs, except such as be
soluble and do open the body. In fine, all that warmeth and hinders the
ripening of phlegm, like as all sour and cold things do.

Here follow many things against the Pleurisy.
SO soon as the common people find not speedy amendment of the expert
Physicians, then will they be incensed therewith and discontented, and will go
seek for other counsel: therefore are these things following very well to be
used, where there is any great heat approaching: Take Corn roses one quarter
of an ounce, stamp them, and wring out the juice, and drink it with Violet
water in the beginning of the sickness: it is a very good remedy.

This following is commended for an especial mastrie in the Pleurisy: Take
the red skin out of the Hasell nut and their shales, make them very dry,
stamp them, and give them to the patient twice or thrice a day with Carduus
Benedictus water, or Endive water. But if you will have it stronger, then use
the red skin alone, take out that which is in the shel, and leave the shel, and
give him thereof a scruple, which suffiseth at one time.

Some do counsel for to take the water of water Lillies before the Pleurisy
be full possessed, for a preservation of the Pleurisy. But I cannot well agree
thereto.

A wonderful remedy that might be tried.
TAke a tooth of a wild Boar, file from it two scruples, and drink this
powder with Scabious water or Well water: And you may also take it with two or
three ounces of sweet oil of Almonds; for the oil of sweet Almonds (taken
with Sugar candy) is a blessed medicine for the Pleurisy. This is also good
for it, conserve of Violets, and of water Lillies; and both these sirupes, to
wit, the sirupes of Endive and Pomegranates, and specially the cold Dragagant
losinges which are described in the first part, the 14. Chapter and 2.. In like
manner the confection of Diapenidion, Diapapauer, and conserve of Roses, and in
great distress and weakness Pearl sugar, which is called Diamargariton
Frigidum.

These waters following are also very good for this sickness, as water of
Carduus Benedictus, of Dandelion, of Leuisticum, of Cicorie, Violets, Burrage,
Buglosse, and all that is made with all manner of Sugar candies, Sugar pennets,
and of Licorice.

And heed must always be taken, that the patient in the time of this sickness
have always an open body, the which may always easily be brought to pass,
through the common Clisters and Suppositories, whereof we have here before
mentioned twain, the which may be made stronger or weaker, according as need
requires.

Likewise it is very commodious also to give the patient two ounces of Manna,
within three ounces of broth, wherein were sodden Iuiubes and Violets. And if
so be that the sickness be not too vehement, and overthrows the patient not
too sore, then may he use these sirupes, to wit, sirupe of Violets one ounce,
sirupe of Licorice half an ounce, Barley water, wherein Violets or Licorice
were sodden, three ounces; give him this in the morning early, and use it
certain days one after another. For this serves also the sirupe of Poppey
heads, although it were but to provoke sleep.

Another. Take Endive, small Endive, Liuerwoort, Lettice, and Venus hair, of
each a handful, peeled Melon seeds, Gourd seeds, Cotton seeds, Violets,
water Lilly flowers, of each one ounce, Sugar twelve ounces, make a sirupe
thereof, and use it as is before said; whereupon, take this purgation, to wit,
new Cassia two ounces, of the foresaid broth four ounces, and give it him in
the morning early very warm. You may also put thereto half a dragme of
Rubarbe, and half a scruple of Spica. But in case that the patient be very
narrow in the breast, as it often happens in this sickness, then take Manna, and
new Cassia, of each three quarters of an ounce, and make thereof a drink with
the foresaid broth.

For this, are also these confections following to be used: Take Diapenidion
without spices, and two ounces of the conserues of Violets, mix them together,
and use it often. Take sirupe of Iuiubes, and sirupe of Violets, of each three
quarters of an ounce, temper them with the water of Folefoote and of Buglosse,
take this also once a day when you please. But of the narrownes or passions of
the breasts, you shall afterward in this Chapter find many good remedies.

An expedite cure of the Pleurisy.
AS soon as the pain of the Pleurisy is felt, shall boxes be fastened on the
place of the pain, for this helps maruellously. Then open a vein on the
contrary arm, and the next morning in the same side where the grief is.
Afterward thou shall give him this sirupe following, as you find the sickness
to be either hot or cold. And when you find that the matter ripeneth or
digesteth a little, then apply this plaster following upon the place affected:
Take Hollihock roots, Mallows, Violet leaves, and Cammomill, of each one
handful, decoct the^ in water, and beat them to growt, add as much oil of
Almonds as shall be needful. But if the phlegm will not be raised and spet
forth, then set boxes on the place again as before, with picking, and let
them draw well. Also add to five ounces of his drink, two ounces of Oxymel of
Squils, for that it breaks the tough phlegm, and casts it forth with ease.

Of the Pleurisy of Cholera.. 7.
IF the Pleurisy proceed of Cholera, then are soluble medicines to be used at
ye first, like as hereafter follow: take Endive, small Endive, Lettice,
Liuerwoort, white Diptamus, Venus hair, (all green if they can be gotten) of
each a handful, peeled Melon seed, Pompeon seed, Cucu^ber seed, Gourd seed,
seeds of Hollihocks and Burrage flours, of each half an ounce, pilled Barley one
ounce, Licorice, Currants, Iuiubes, Sebestes, of each one drag. Violets and
water Lillies of each half an ounce, sees them all together, and with twelve
ounces of Sugar make a sirupe thereof, even as we have taught before. And the
common sirupe of Iuiubes is also good for this. Item, in stead of the foresaid
things may you use this following.

Take sirupe of Violets three ounces, sirupe of Poppie heads, of Venus hair,
of each one ounce and a half: mingle these together with sufficient water of
Endive, and so drink it at twice, afterward take this purgation: Take
Violets, Borage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, of each half an ounce, Prunes,
Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each ten, Spikenard half a dragme, Licorice and
Currants, of each five dragmes, let them all sees well together: then take
four ounces of this decoction, and steep therein half, or a whole dragme of
Rubarbe, let it so stand in a warm place all night, and drink it warm. This
being done, lay upon the affected place a sponge that is made wet in warm
water, wherein Cammomill, Violets, and Dill are decocted. But if these herbs
be not to be gotten, take warm Well water, and wring out the sponge meetely
well, you may do the like with a bladder that is filled with warm milk and
Linseede oil, and so lay it over the place of the pain. Or you may use this:
Take a pint of milk, and two pintes of honey tempered well together, and laid
with tow upon the place. Item, take Mallows, and Hollihocke roots, of each
one handful, chop them well together, and fry it with butter or Sallad oil,
and so lay it upon the pain. This following is good to expel the blood: Take
Bolus and Salt, of each a like much, make them to pap with honey, and bind it on
the place where the pain is.

Hereafter follow Plasters, Salues, and such like.
TAke crumbs of white bread about four ounces, fresh Butter or Sallad oil,
three ounces, Hollihocke roots two ounces, Fenegreeke half an ounce: cut,
stamp, and sees it well in Goats milk, mellow to pap: and when it is almost
cold, then stir amongst it one dragme of beaten Saffron, and so lay it warm on
the pain. Item, take beaten Hollihock roots, Mallow seeds, and Barley meal,
of each a like much, let it sees together in Goats milk until it be thick
enough, then put thereto sufficient oil of Cammomill, and spread it on a
cloth. You have here before in the fifth. of the pricking of the pleurisy two
plasters of roasted Hollihocke roots, the which are marvelous good for this.
This also following is very excellent for the great stitch and oppression of
the breast: Take half a pound of Cassie taken out of pipes, as is taught in
the Preface, temper amongst it one ounce of the salve of Althea, oil of sweet
Almonds, and powned Hollihocke roots, of each two ounces, spread them on a
cloth, and make thereof a plaster, and lay it on the stitch. Item, take four
ounces of white bread crum, soften them one hour in Goats milk, afterward
powne them well, then put thereto one ounce and a half of Cassie, three whites
of eggs, Saffron ten grains, and oil of Roses as much as is needful for a
plaster.

Of the Pleurisy of Phlegma.. 8.
IF the Pleurisy proceed of phlegmatic humors, and that the pain draw
downward toward the lowermost rib, then is the patient to take oftentimes half
an ounce of the conserues of Hyssope, tempered with Carduus Benedictus water,
and a little Saffron.

Other do take a sweet Apple, which they make hollow, and fill it with
Frankincense, and then stop the hole again with a piece of an Apple, cleaued
to round about with dow, and so let it roast a while. This Apple is eaten as a
preservative against the Pleurisy, that people might not be taken with it,
although they be subject to it.

Item, take a sweet Apple, cut a piece out of it, and put therein one scrup.
of beaten Mastick, close it again with the same piece. Roast this Apple in hot
ashes, and so eat it. Take the uppermost crops of Nettles, sees them in Well
water, and strain out the juice through a cloth, give him thereof at two or
three times in the beginning of the sickness, three ounces at one time. For
purging of this flegmatike matter, prepare these sirupes following: Take
Hyssope and Venus hair, of each two handfuls, pilled Melon seeds, Pompion
seeds, Gourd seeds, Cucumber seeds, Butchers broom seed, Sperage seeds,
Lineseede and Fenegreeke seeds, of each one drag. good vinegar half an ounce,
cut and powne all that is to be cut and powned, let them sees all together. To
this decoction put three ounces of clarified Honey, nine ounces of Sugar, then
make thereof a sirupe: this is passing good when the Phlegma is thick and
tough. But if you will not make a sirupe for it, then take common sirupe, to
wit, of Venus hair, of Licorice, or Hyssope: but the sirupe of Licorice is
maruellously commended for this.

For a purgation: take Violets. Buglosse flowers, and Burrage flowers, of each
one ounce, Licorice, Currants, of each two ounces, two or three Figs, Agaricus
one dragme and a half, let all these steep and sees together, take four
ounces thereof and temper therewith three dragms of the confection Eleschoph,
and then drink it at one draught.

When you have purged, then anoint the pain with the oil of Dill, or oil of
Lillies; afterward sees Cammomill and Venus hair in water and vinegar in a
bag, strain it out, and then lay it warm upon the pain. Item, take Barley and
Pease, of each one ounce and a half, Branne one handful, beat them gross
and make thereof a bag of a quarter of a yard broad, sees it, and use it as
above. Thirdly, take Myly and Salt as much as you will, warm it together in a
pan, put it into a bag, and lay it warm thereon, especially if the matter be
windy.

Of the Pleurisy of Melancholia.. 9.
But if this disease proceed of Melancholia, (which chances seldom) then
strain the juice of one handful of Burrage and Buglosse, and being clarified,
give it him with the foresaid sirupe. For purging, take black Hellebore, Thime,
Epythimus, the roots of Polipodie, Seen leaves, and such like, even as in the
description of Melancholy, in the first part the twelfth Chapter and eight. is
taught.

When as the sick person begins to cough up phlegm, then it is necessary
that he use to drink for it every day of common Barley water a good draught, of
the decoction which here before in the cold Rheum in the second Chapter is
expressed, and begins thus: Take twenty Iuiubes, etc. which cleanses the
breast. And if the great pricking and shooting remain, and he do cough with
pain, then is the patient to drink of this potion following three or four
mornings together: Take ten fat Figs, fat Dates, Smallage seed, Fennel
seeds, Venus hair, Licorice, Hyssop, and Mallows, of each five dragmes,
sees them all together in six and thirty ounces of water to the half, and
trouble not your self therein, albeit the patient should cough up matter or
corruption.

Of the bastard or false Pleurisy.. 10.
WE have mentioned heretofore of the false Pleurisy in the fifth. and made her
nature known. If the patient have plenty of blood, then is his Saphaea or
liue^ vein to be opened. Afterward, set upon the place of the stitch, a cup
or box or twain with pricking, or according as the humors in that sickness
do reign, as blood, Cholera, Flegma, or Melancholia do exceed, and afterward
purge and use stronger Clisters than for the true Pleurisy were prescribed.
But in case that the patient feel this stitch about the Diaphragma, then open
the Median, and use the foresaid warming things, that divide the matter: let
the place be often rubbed with a hand or cloth that thereby the pores may be
opened. This being done, then lay this plaster following thereupon: Take two
ounces of Fenegreeke meal, and Pitch three ounces, Wax one ounce, most them
both, and mingle the meal amongst it, with oil of Cammomill to a plaster
which you may spread on Leather, and cover it with silk, and so lay it on the
stitch. But if the Ague be not too big, then may you use thereto the Oxycroceum
plaster. Item, take the ashes of Colewoorts, tempered with Pullets or Swines
grease.

But if the anguish show it self outwardly, and yet will impostume but slowly,
then must the same be opened, be it with an hot iron or with a Lancet. What
does loose phlegm, that shall be set down hereafter in the description of the
cough, of the shortness breath, whether it proceed of heat or cold. But if the
phlegm that at the first shall be coughed up, be black and yellow together
one amongst another, and that the Ague end not on the seventh day, then it is a
very bad sign, if therewith be any heavy rattling in the throat, with rednes
of the cheeks, lead colored and dark eyes, then is death at hand.

When the Pleurisy shows it self outwardly.
IF the Pleurisy show it self outwardly, with any redness, and the party
feels great pain in the touching of it, then it is a certain token of a
false and bastard Pleurisy, that is settled outwardly on the ribs. For the
same, is a cup or box to be set thereon, or to lay a blistering plaster of
Figs and Mustard seeds, and let it lie thereon so long, until the place begin
to impostumate, and then open it, and heal it like as other impostumes. But if
the matter wax hard, then it is to be maturated with this plaster following:
Take Hollihocke leaves one handful, Cammomill, Melilot, and violet leaves, of
each half a handful, Fenegreeke seed, and Linseed beaten small, of each
half an ounce, Bean meal, and Barley meal, of each two handfuls, oil of
sweet Almonds, oil of Dill, and of Violets, of each one ounce, then temper the
one with the other, and so lay it on the place. Hereafter follow plasters and
salues that assuage the stitch and pain, be it of whatsoever occasion it may
be. Take Mallows, and Hollihocke roots, of each one handful, sees them
together to pap, and then stamp them together with oil of Violets, and Barowes
grease, and so lay it on the sore: but let it not lie too long thereon, that the
matter be not maturated too soon. Item, take oil of yellow Violets two
ounces, of the oil of sweet Almonds and oil of Cammomill, of each half an
ounce, fresh Butter one ounce, Saffron one dragme and a half, white Wax one
ounce and a half, Dill seed, Cammomill, Duckes grease, of each half an
ounce, and three yolks of Eggs: make thereof a salve or plaster. This poultis
following, does much assuage the pain: take Branne as much as you please,
sees it in Wine unto a pap, and put thereto a little Salt.

Another. Take unripe Sallad oil three ounces, four fresh yolks of Eggs,
Saffron one drag. new oil of Roses one ounce and a half, sees it a while,
and set it on warm ashes, and stir well amongst it the beaten yolks of Eggs:
put afterward unto it Starch and Barley meal, of each one drag. and a half,
and last of all the Saffron: if you will have it more forcible, then put fresh
Butter to it, and Bdellium, of each one drag. and sees it with decocted sweet
Wine, as thick as you desire it. Or use this following.

Take Cammomill, Dill seed, Venus hair, Hollihocke seeds, and Folefoote, of
each two handfuls, Currants three handfuls, six Poppie heads, six ounces of
fresh Butter, xxxvi. ounces of sweet sodden Wine, put unto it (when all is well
sodden and brayed) one dragme of Saffron.

A good salve. Take Althaea salve, and Butter, anoint the place therewith
where the pain is, and strew thereon beaten Comin, and lay a warm Colewoort
leaf thereon.

When the Pleurisy takes a woman with Child.. 12.
IF it then chance that a woman be in doubt of bearing the space of two
months, were brought a bed before her time, and brought a dead child into the
world, or were much inclined to the same, and so be taken with the Pleurisy,
she must not be let blood, but she must have cups set on her buttockes, and be
picked well, whereby to draw the blood downward. But women that are wont to
miscarie in have, they may well be let blood, yet always taking good heed to
their strength. But for a general rule, all women (albeit they miscarie or
not, or that they have conceived) are to have the liver vein opened. But if it
be not the right Pleurisy, then make a bag with warm Millet and Bran, and
lay it where the stitch is felt, and annoint the back with Althaea salve.

But they that are not with child and have the Pleurisy, it is much
counseled, that their Terms be provoked as much as is possible, whereof in
the fifth part is very largely discoursed. And the other (even as is already
said) are to be helped (according as they be of strength) by other medicines.

Rules for such as are recovered of the Pleurisy, that they fall not into it
again.. 13.
FIrst, all they that be subject to this sickness, are to shun all dwellings
(and principally in winter season) that are situate in the North and West, and
near the water. They must also forbear all tough slimie meats, and all that
is made of dough, Cheese, Milk, and such like: also from vinegar, sour and
sharp, and all kind of tart things: Capers and Sallad oil are also enemies
unto him. Item from all pottage, except of red and white Pease, and Bean
broth, which be good for him; and dress Hens, Pullets, Veale and Pigeons
with it. All cold fruits, as Apples, Pears, Chestnuts, etc. are hurtful for
him: but Figs and Raisins are very meet; sodden Colewoorts, and all sorts of
Rapes and roots, as Parsneps, Parsley roots, and such like, are very good for
him: and all Barley paps also.

His drink must be thin, white, and sweet wine, or common Beer which is very
clear. To drink water, is for this straightly forbidden: but if the patient
desire to water his wine he may do it; yet with water that is decocted with
Cinnamome or Licorice. After his meal tide is he to keep himself quiet one
or two hours. Watching is very hurtful for him: but to sleep long is very
good and needful.

In eating, he must also beware of swallowing down meat not well chewed, and
of ouercharging his stomach with meat and drink, that there follow no harm
to the stomach. He must look well to all these, and that he be always merry
and of a light heart.

Secondly, he must take good heed for to have always an open body; and
before he use these pills following, he must first use these potions: Take of
the water of Fole-foote five ounces: Sugar one ounce, drink it every morning
fasting at one time. The pills are thus to be made: take prepared Aloe one
quarter of an ounce, Opopanacum, Bdellium, and Colloquint, of each one scruple,
make pills thereof with sirupe of Roses six of a drag. then take every four
days one or twain, according as you are bound, and in the evening one before
supper.

A Salve.
TAke Asarabacca, Hyssope, Mallows, and Rosemarie, of each three quarters of
an ounce, Sandaraca three drag. Spica nardi one quarter of an ounce, Dragon
blood, and the juice of Sloes, of each one drag. Starch five dragms; powne each
apart as small as may be, then temper it with Malmsey, and keep this stopped
tight: Herewith are you to rub the back bone and shoulders softly, and
afterward a Fox case bound thereon. And the patient must have his vein opened
on the right hand besides the little finger, and let it bleed four or five
ounces of blood.

These are the most principal means, whereby these perilous sicknesses may be
prevented: but we will add somewhat more to the rest.

Certain several remedies against the cold Pleurisy.. 14.
FOr the true Pleurisy do serve these compounded Confections and losinges:
which are prepared two manner of ways, Diaprassium, Diahyssopum, Diaire^^
Solomonis, and Lohoch de Pino. Item all that is prepared against the cold
cough, as confected Elecampane roots, Treacle, Mithridate, sweet sirupe of
Pomegranates, and Parsley roots sodden in wine, tempered with a little
vinegar, and thereof drunken often. Also M. Tristrams water, and other more
Aquae Compos^^e. But by reason of the ague some cooling things must always be
tempered amongst it.

For the common drink you have here before in the sixth. a special Barley
water: mollists crumbs of white bread therein bounden in a clout, strain it
often out and mingle some white wine amongst it. Honey water quenches thirst,
it provoke also the tough humors and flegmes to avoid, and it is good for
all coughes. Thin wine tempered with water is tolerable for this, if ye Ague be
not too strong. Ite^, take Cicera, Venus hair, as much as you please: let it
sees with a little Licorice. For common things, these following are very good
for the cold Pleurisy; as Assa foetida, Nettles with their seed, Balsam wood,
with their fruits, Ireos, Myrrh, the right Acornes, for which some do take
Calmus, or great Galingall and Starch.

The fifth Chapter. Of the Lights or Lungs.
WE have hitherto spoken of the outward parts of the Breast, and discoursed of
their infirmities: now we will write of the inner parts, and will begin with
the Lights, for that they are made as a separation between the pipes of the
Lungs and the Heart; also as an instrument of the breath, ordained of God for
the use of the body, thereby to draw in the outward air, thereby to cool and
quicken the heart and all inward parts, wherewith to form also and effect the
voice and speech in all that has received life. Therefore has nature made the
substance of the Lights light, and like a sponge, formed with many pipes,
whereby they might be the more meet to draw ye breath out and in. Some ancient
Physicians are of opinion, that they were without blood; but it is not so, they
have their blood too, and are full of it: but as soon as it comes out of the
Breasts, the body is void thereof. What great difference is between the Lights
of men and of Beasts, is not here needful to be written. In like manner that
the smaller the Lights be in ones body, the more swifter can they endeavor and
bestirre themselves.

This noble and necessary member is subject to many grievous and deadly
sicknesses, whereof we will speak hereafter: But first of all we will begin
with the Cough.

Of the Cough.. 1.
FOrasmuch as the Cough is a messenger of all the diseases of the Lights and of
the Breast, and that through the grossness, drouth, moisture, spettle and
other excrements; whereby men may easily adiudge how the breast and lights are
made within: therefore it is advised first of all to write thereof. The
ancient Physicians do write thus of the Cough: The Cough is a natural motion
of the Lights, the which by the air and moving virtue of the muscles that are
within the Breast, is meet and made for to cough up all that which hurts the
lights. The moving and breathing in the breast is appropriated by nature; as
the neesing for the brains, and the digesture for the stomach. But before we
go any further, we will speak first of the Rheum, the which provoke the
cough most of all.

Of the Rheum or Catarrhe which falls upon the Lights.. 2.
HEre before in the second part, the first Chapter, and 4.. and afterward in
the description of the Squinancie, there are written many things of this Rheum
of the lights, which may as well be understood of the Rheum in the lungs as of
the Squinancie. For the peril of stifling is even as much, whether the lights
were stopped, or ye throat were shut up. Such things happen oftentimes through a
tough slimie matter, which falls out of the head upon the lights, and into
the breast, the which is very ill to be gotten out, and there rests and
abides. We will therefore first show by what means all such stoppings of the
lights are to be remedied and cured. And for that these Rheumes are more
incident to children, by reason of their moisture, therefore we will express
certain necessary things that are requisite for the said young children.

Take Lineseede which is beaten mollify it in clear honey, give it to the
child to lick thereof: it drives out the slime, it separateth it, opens the
breast, and purges mildly, whereof give him five or six times, according as
it purges much or little: but if so be that the child will not eat any thing
at all, then is there no hope of health to ensue. But then roast an Onion in
warm ashes, wring out the juice, put thereto as much Hens and Capons grease as
there is juice, and temper it by a soft fire, and anoint the child's breast
therewith. Item, take Mastick, Frankincense, and Citron pills, of each a like
much, and make thereof a powder, and rub the Child softly therewith above upon
the future of the Scull. Also you may let him l^ke oil of sweet Almonds,
tempered with Sugar candy, for it mollifieth the breast, and loses it. These
losinges following are not only very good for children, but for aged people,
whether the same be used in losinges, or in form of any confection,. Agarici
albi. 18. Spec. Diambrae.. 5. Dia^reos Solomonis, drag. 1. Spec.
Diatragacanthi, scrup. 4. Polypodij quercint,. 1. Omnia in puluerem redacta,
cum Saccaro incorporentur ad placitum.

But with men in years it has another respect. They that be sixteen or
eighteen years old, who are infected with this disease, they shall rule
themselves according to this regiment following.

Concerning the order of diet, you have here before in the first Chapter and
4.. and god advice and instructions afterward. Also, it is very good that the
Liver vein be opened, and five ounces of blood letten out. Afterward two
scruples or one scruple of the pills Cochiae to be taken, and to sleep one
hour after them, and five hours after that to drink a draught of sugared
Barley water, and then to eat somewhat. This so done, he must use this Potion
following warm in the morning: Take sirupe of Endive, Honey of Roses, and
sirupe of Stechas, of each half an ounce, water of Cicorie, and of Endive, of
each one ounce and a half, tempered together.

But for this accident are Clisters more profitable, like as these be
following, which are recited and put for an example. Take Poppie heads, small
Housleeke, Mallows, and Bran, of each half a handful, Asarabacca, and
Betonie, of each half so much, sees all together in sufficient water, then
wring it out well, and take of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, oil
of Violets and of Saffron, of each one ounce and a half, Hiera Picra, and S.
Thomas Sugar, of each three quarters of an ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce:
these Clisters are you to use before noone. He may lay roasted Millet, with Salt
and Cammomill upon his head, and to set oftentimes cups or boxes upon his
shoulders and buttockes (without picking) is highly commended. Or if that the
party be full of blood, then ought they to be picked. Also if by nature he be
subject to the Piles, then ought they to be opened by rubbing with rough
clothes or Figgs leaves; so also is the Ox gall very good for them. Afterward
must he be washed every day with sharp Ley, and therefore use convenient Soap,
and let him be well dried, continuing this ten days together, but in the mean
time shall he take the pills Assaiaret, and refrain the cold air, and keep
his head well covered.

This Salve following is very commodious, if the shorn head be anointed
therewith, it raises many blisters, and thereby draws out all the moisture
from the brains, and strengthens the head exceedingly.

Take one ounce of Nep, Bean meal, and Pease meal, of each three ounces,
stamped roots of Costus and Mace, of each half an ounce, Mustard seed one
dragm, Pigeon dung two ounces, Marioram gentle stamped three quarters of an
ounce, sees these together in sufficient water to pappe, and use it as is
said: for this purpose serves also oil of Masticke. Item, take oil of sweet
Almonds, and Hens grease, of each half an ounce, Saffron one scruple, and
therewith annoint the throat and the breast. To this end may also this sirupe
following be prepared: take five Poppie heads with the seeds of panis diui
Iohannis cleansed from the kernels, one ounce and a half, Myrtle seeds half a
dragme, prepared Licorice one ounce and a half, sees them in a pint of water,
unto two parts, wring it out and strain it, and put afterward thereto Sugar
candy, and Sugar pennets, of each two ounces, sees it as thick an honey. And
if the rheum fall vehemently on the breast, that it seems to strangle one,
then take half an ounce of Agaricus, letting it steep 24. hours long in six
ounces of the water of Venus hair, afterward wring it out, and put as much
Sugar unto it as you please. And sees it to the thickness of Honey for your
daily use, whereof is to be taken half an ounce at a time.

If this Rheum come with heat, then make these pills following, and keep them
one day and a night in your mouth. Take white Poppie seed, Purslaine seed,
and Lettice seed, Sugar candy and Sugar pennets, of each one dragme, Saffron
one scruple, and make them all to pills with dissolved Dragagant.

But if the Rheum be with cold and a great cough, then take red Stirax, Cipers
nuts, Frankincense, Laudanum, juice of Licorice, and Amber, of each one dragm,
Raisins (the stones taken out) one drag. and a half, Sugar candy three
dragmes, make pills thereof with sirupe of Hyssope, and use them as before.

This powder following is approved for staying of the Rheum: Take Spica of the
Indies one quarter of an ounce, Cinamome one quarter of an ounce, of the skull
of a man that died through violence three quarters of an ounce: take every time
it comes one drag. after meat in Wine, or any decoction. You may also make
this in losinges with Sugar, or to a powder. Further, you may take and receive
a fomentation for this Rheum, as in the first part the third Chapter, and 2..
Item, take Frankincense and Sandaraca (which are very requisite for this,) the
water of Consolida regalis is also very meet for this use. Certain ancient
Physicians do highly commend Barley water mixed with Iulep of Violets. Item,
take clear and well washed Turpentine one quarter of an ounce, beaten Licorice
one dragme: put thereto seething hot flesh broth, and stir it still about
until the Turpentine be dissolved, and drink it when you go to bed. Other do
take also washed Turpentine, tempered with Honey, and beaten Licorice: both these
are marvelous good, and specially if the patient therewith be troubled with
the infirmity of gravel. Item, Honey and Vinegar wherein Agaricus has been
steeped, takes away all danger of choking. Likewise for this is very good the
sirupe of green nut shells, which is described in the first part the thirteenth
Chapter, and 4.. look for it there. It is also here before oftentimes
mentioned, that as men will go to bed, they are to swallow three or four
grains of Frankincense, for that they do strengthen much the brains, and do
dry and stay cold Rheumes.

If so be that through this Rheum the Pleurisy is feared, the which is
thereby oftentimes caused, then take four ounces of new made oil of Almonds,
and small filed bones of a Bore ten grains, tempered together, and so given
the patient to drink.

And if so be that through all the aforesaid remedies the Rheum be not
removed, then do the learned give counsel for the last mean, which is to
cauterize on the seame of the skull, the which any may do very well, if one be
afraid that the patient be in danger of stifling.

What is commodious for the obstructed Lights.. 3.
FOR the obstruction of the lights (which provoke the cough, the shortness
of breath, and many other diseases) is all that highly commended which causes
to rid much phlegm, like as hereafter more amply (where we shall speak of the
Cough) you shall see: yet are these things following used against this present
stopping, to wit, conserve of Fumitorie, and all that is made of that herb: it
opens the obstructions of all parts. In like manner, Conserues of Marioram
gentle, Sage, oil of bitter and sweet Almonds, oil of Wormwood, sirupe of
Violets, of Vinegar, and Acetosus compositus, which do separate and loose these
Rheumes that are impacted in the Lights. In like sort Oxymel of Squils, and
Agaricus, have a special operation for to loose all tough phlegm from the
lights, for which this confection following is highly commended: Take
Frankincense Myrrh, Licorice, Saffron, and Cassie wood, of each one dragme,
beaten small together, and Honey (sodden with Malmsey somewhat thick) four
ounces, tempered all together. This confection is special good for this
malady.

But every one ought to know whether this Rheum do proceed either of heat or
of cold, thereby to rule and direct himself, and may make choice of medicines
that may be commodious as well for the one as the other.

Remedies for the Cough.. 4.
WHat the Cough is, and how it is described of the learned, is declared before
in the 1.. But as much as concerns the inconvenience of the Cough, we will
divide it into two sorts, to wit, a dry and a cold sort, both proceeding
either of inward or outward causes. The outward are, when as any thing comes
into the throat, be it powder, dust, any pestilent air, or any other bad air,
dry, moist, or hot air, wherewith the Lights be infected.

In like manner smoke, sharp meats dressed with Pepper or much Salt, Medlars,
Vinegar, Veriuice, Limons, or such like, which passes through the throat, be
it through meat or drink, which do slide into the unright throat (as the
common people use to say.) The inward causes are tough slime, and rheumes,
(whereof before has been written) that fall into the breast and the stomach.
And when any vapors come into the Lights, be it of an infirmity of the
stomach, Milt, Liver, Mother, and such like: the which infirmities bring with
them their own signs, and show whereof they spring and sprout, which would be
too long to be rehearsed at this present.

But to come to the remedies of both these sorts of the Cough, it is to be
marked, whether the Cough be dry or no; for when it is so, then comes it of
heat: And if so be that the patient be full of blood and red in the face, then
according to the permission of his age, of the country, of the time, he is to
be let blood without delay, especially if the party be dry and leave. But if it
last long, it is to be feared that it will come to a consumption (which is
Phthisis.) For this are good all cooling and moist things, as conserve of
Violets, stewed Barley (which is Ptisana) and such like things.

Against all dry Coughes.. 5.
THat which at the first of the stewed Barley and other things has been said,
the same is also good for this dry Cough, whereas little or nothing at all is
coughed up: But this drink is especially commended for it. Take sirupe of
Violets, sirupe of Poppie heads, and sirupe of Iuiubes, of each a like much,
water wherein Barley, Violets, Licorice, Raisins, and Sebestes be sodden, as
much as you think good, tempered with Sugar. Purging is not only commodious,
but also needful, the which is thus to be effected: Take of the said
decoction, sees therein Prunes of Damas^, and sower Dates, of each half an
ounce, pilled Melon seed, Pompion seed, Cucumber seed, Gourd seeds, and
Venus hair, of each one quarter of an ounce; take four ounces thereof, and
temper therein one ounce and a half of Cassi^, for it cools and opens. The
ancient Physicians do praise pilled Beans; it is possible indeed, for that it
will make the water thick. In like manner do they commend fresh Butter wherein
Almonds and Sugar are mixed, stewed Gourds, Iuiubes, Spinach, Endive, Lettice,
Purslaine, oil of sweet Almonds, Kids flesh, Pullets, and such like.

It is also good that the patient always keep somewhat in his mouth,
sometimes one thing and otherwhiles another, to wit, losinges of Dragagant,
Sugar pennets, Licorice, the juice of Licorice, Sugar candy, or such like: and
for this you may prepare this confection following:. Specierum, Diapapauere
vnciam vnam, Diatragacanthi frigidi, Diapenidionis sine speciebus, (...)
dragmam vnam, Sacchari violarum vncias duas, Species Diaireos vnciam vnam, fiat
mixtura. Or take that which follows: Take Poppie seed beaten small one ounce
and a quarter, Starch, Dragagant, and Gum, of each half an ounce, pilled
seeds of Gourds and of Quinces, of each three dragmes; then make thereof a
powder. Item, take Sugar pennets sixteen ounces, sees it with water of
Folefoote unto the thicknes of honey, or somewhat stiffer, and take thereof
oftentimes in the mouth. Item, take a little pan, and fry Currants therein,
stirring them still about, that they burn not; and eat thereof every morning
a full spoonefull. Item take half an ounce of Manna, dissolve it in fresh oil
of sweet Almonds, if there be any dressed therein, strain them thorough
oftentimes. For this also is meet a bath of fair water, wherein are decocted
Violets, Mallows, and Hollihocke roots.

Because that this kind of dry Cough has need of moisture and mellowing
potions, for which these things are noted down: Take of the black losinges,
and temper them with the sirupe of Violets, and with the foresaid decoction,
and drink thereof as often as you will, it is marvelous good. And you may also
use it with the sirupe alone. Item, take new milk, temper it with sweet butter
and sugar, and drink when you go to sleep, it eases the Cough above all
measure. Or take four pints of water, and the fourth part of a pint of honey,
six Figs cut small, one ounce of Licorice, sees them together unto a pint,
scum it well, and drink thereof every morning a good warm draught, and delay
also the patients wine therewith. This is also marvelous good against all
hoarsnesse.

Another. Temper fair Well water with any of these sirupes following, and
drink thereof, to wit, with sirupe of Violets, of Poppie heads, or of water
Lillies. Item, take Barley water one pint, sees therein four or five Crabs,
according as they be big, or in their stead hedge Snailes, for they are
special good against all dry Coughes.

This potion following is called at the Apothecaries Decoctio pectoralis, The
pectoral decoction.
and is much used and had in all the Apothecaries shops at Ausborough, and also
very commodious: for it scoureth the stomach, melloweth the Cough, cleanses
the tough slime in the breast, and moisteneth also the same. Take new Figs half
an ounce, Dates and Iuiubes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mallows,
Hyssope, Currants, sliced Licorice, Annis seed, Fennel seeds, and Barley, of
each one quarter of an ounce; sees them all together in three pints of Barley
water unto the second part: but if there be much flegmaticke slime with it,
then let there be sodden therewith one ounce or twain of Honey. The like remed
have you also here before in the second Chapter, and the second.

Of that which may be used outwardly.
TAke Cammomils alone, or with Roses and Thime sodden together, and receive the
vapor or fume thereof into your nose.

Hereafter follow diverse Salues, and such like.
TAke the muscilage of Dragagant, and of Gum, of each one quarter of an
ounce, oil of sweet Almonds, and of Violets, of each one ounce, Hens grease
and Calves marrow, of each half an ounce, Wax as much as is needful to make
a salve. Or take oil of Violets four ounces, as much white wax as will make
it thick, spread thereof upon a cloth, and then lay it upon the breast. Item,
take the muscilage of Lineseede, and of Hollihock roots, oil of Lillies, and
Goosegrease, of each half an ounce, Saffron ten grains, and a little molten
Wax: make a soft salve of them, and therewith anoint the whole breast. This
is special good for young children, and not unprofitable for people in years.
The things hereafter following are exceeding good to anoint therewith the
breast, if so be it be used alone, or tempered with other things, like as the
oil of Cammomils, oil of yellow and blew Violets, oil of Lillies, and Poppie
heads. Item, all fat of Hens and Ducks, of which two fats take one ounce, of
Saffron one scruple tempered together, and the breasts anointed therewith.

There are at the Apothecaries two kinds of breast salues, which are called
Vnguenta Pectoralia: Take muscilage of Fleawoort, Dragagant, Gum, Linseede,
and Fenegreeke seed, of each one dragme, Hens grease, marrow of Calves bones,
fresh Butter three quarters of an ounce, washed together with the water of
Violets, oil of sweet Almonds, and of Violets, of each half an ounce, Wax as
much as need requires, and so tempered all together into a salve.

This swageth not only the Cough, but also all pains of the breast. Another.
Take oil of Violets two ounces, oil of sweet Almonds one ounce and a half,
fresh Butter two ounces, Ducks grease one ounce, Muscilage of Hollihocke
roots, Linseede and Fenegreeke, of each half an ounce, let these sees all
together until that the muscilage be consumed. Take molten white Wax as much
as is needful for a salve, but stir it well about until it be cold: this
has the same operation with the other.

Of a moist and cold Cough.. 6.
When the Cough comes with much slime and moisture, and will not be removed,
and that therewith be no Ague nor Lask, then are these losinges following to be
given him, with water wherein Venus hair and Hyssope is sodden. Take Fennel
seed, Smallage seed, juice of Licorice, Venus hair, and peeled Almonds, of
each a like much, make trocisces or losinges thereof with the muscilage of
Linseede. You are also to prepare these Sirupes following, which are passing
good.

Take Ireos and Elecampane roots, of each one ounce and a half, Hyssope and
Venus hair, of each two handfuls, white Mints, Pimpernell, Mallows, Marioram,
of each half a handful, fried Linseed one ounce, raw Barley one ounce and a
half, Licorice and Currants, of each two ounces, Honey and Sugar, of each six
ounces, make of them a sirupe.

For this is also meet the usual sirupe of Licorice, also Stechados, Oxymel of
Squils, and sirupe of Venus hair three or four days one after another, with
water of Venus hair or Scabious drunken. When as then the matter is prepared
with the foresaid things, then purge the patient with pills Cochiae and Aureae,
of each half a drag. Or take one ounce of Cassie, Agaricus one drag. and a
half, Turbith also one dragme, Sal gemmae and Ginger, of each three grains:
give it him with four ounces of water, wherein are sodden Venus hair,
Hyssope, Scabious, Licorice, and Violets.

After purging, some do give Mithridate and Treacle for old coughes, thereby to
consume the matter. Also for old Coughes the Treacle Diatessaron is to be used,
but take what you please giving him a dragme at one time, according as the
person is young or old, with a little Barley water. The Breast is also to be
kept warm, and the same to be anointed, whereto this following serves: Take
Muscilage of Fenegreeke, and Lineseede, of each two ounces, fresh butter one
quarter of an ounce, oil of sweet Almonds one ounce and a half, Wax as much
as is needful. For this is special good the salve Althea, and when you have
rubbed the breast warm therewith, then cover it with carded sheep wool.

Further, these things may be used outwardly: to wit, that in the morning there
be laid on his head a bag of parched Millets and salt, or a bag with
Penniroyall, Marioram, and Mints laid upon the head: Or in the stead thereof,
Styrax, wild Mints, Myrrh, and Sandaraca, of each a like much beaten to
powder, and cast upon the fire, and the vapor or fume thereof received into the
nose and mouth. For this is also good Nigella seed, or Sandaraca, each alone.
Item, take Rosemarie, Penniroyall, Cammomill, white Mints, and Sage, of each a
like quantity: let them sees together, and receive the vapor or fume. You may
make also of these things following a cap, and wear the same continually on
the head: it is very commodious for old folk. Take Stechas, Amaranthus,
Cammomill, Melilot, Agnus castus, and Rue, of each a handful and a half,
Annis seed, Fennel, Comin, prepared Coriander, of each half an ounce: then
lay this Cap upon a hot stone, which is sprinkled with wine, and so set it
warm on his head.

The patient is also to hold Myrrh a long time in his mouth, and afterward
swallow it down, for it has a marvelous operation in all cold coughes. A
bath to wash the feet is also very commodious for this: take for the same
Thime, Roses, Cammomils, and Salt, of each one handful: let them sees
together, and put the feet therein even to the knees. This may he use three
days long, and then renew the same.

Other things more that are very requisite for this purpose.
FOr this is also good all that warmeth the breast, whereof there are many
sorts, as two kinds of Di^ireos, the which in the first part, the 14. Chapter.
1. are described: Likewise Diatragacanthum calidum, which is also there
described in the 2.. Meade is also very go^ against the cold Cough, and all
diseases of the Lights, which is taught to be prepared diversely in the eighth
part. What pectorall potions the Apothecaries have in use, the same is showed
is the second part, the second chapter, and 2.. Elecampane wine takes away all
cold diseases of the breast. The same does also oil of Lillies, of sweet
Almonds, oil of Poppy heads, trocisces of Diapenidion, Looch de Pino, which is
a confection of Pine apple kernels, Looch sanum, and chiefly Looch de Scilla,
tosted Figs, Dates, the decoction of an old Cock, with wild Saffron seed,
wherein Hyssop, Ireos, Raisins or Nettle seeds is decocted. Elecampane, Saffron
and all that is prescribed for the cold rheum. And because that these
Losinges, Looch, or confections are many times rehearsed in this our book of
Physic, therefore it cannot be misaduised that we describe them and other such
like here, Diapenidion.
and begin first with Diapenidion, which is made thus. Take Sugar pennets two
ounces, sweet and bitter Almonds, and white Poppie seed, of each three dragmes
and one scruple, Cinamome, Cloves, Ginger, juice of Licorice, Dragagant,
Starch, Gum, seeds of Melons, of Gourds, and Cucumbers, all pilled, of each
one drag. and a half, Camfere seven grains, make thereof small powder being
al beaten and chopped, and with an ounce of this powder, 12. ounces of Sugar, and
sees it away with water of Folefoote unto losinges, and then let it melt in
your mouth. This Sugar is very good for all old coughes, for hoarsnesse, for
digestion, and coughing up of phlegm.

Looch de Pino is thus prepared: Take fresh Pingles fifteen dragmes, Looch de
Pino.
steep them all a night in the water of Folefoote, sweet Almonds, parched
hasell Nuts, Dragagant, Gum, Licorice, Starch, Venus hair, and Ireos, of
each one quarter of an ounce, 17. or 18. Dates, one ounce and a half of bitter
Almonds, Honey of Roses, fresh Butter, and white Sugar, of each one quarter of
an ounce, 18. ounces and three quarters of clarified Honey, cut and powne all
that is to be cut and powned, and then temper them together with the said Honey,
this is passing good for all cold Coughs. There is also another Looch or
confection, Looch Sanum and expertum.
the which is called Sanum and expertum, which is haill and approved. Take
Cinnamom, Hyssope, and Licorice, of each one quarter of an ounce, Iuiubes and
Sebestes, of each fifteen, Currants, Figs, and Dates, of each one ounce,
Fenegreeke two ounces and a half, Venus hair half a handful, Annis seed,
Fennel, Ireos, Linseede, and white Mints, of each one quarter of an ounce,
sees them together in 24. ounces of water unto the half part, then strain it
out, and put to this decoction twelve ounces of Sugar pennets, sees this
together again until it be through thick, afterward mingle the other things
therein cut and beaten small, prepared Pingles one ounce and a quarter, as is
before said, peeled Almonds, juice of Licorice, Dragagant, Gum and Starch, of
each one quarter of an ounce, roots of Violets one dragme, stir them well
together until it be white. It is very good against the Cough and hoarsenesse
that comes of cold: it melloweth and emptieth the breast of all phlegmatic
matter.

Looch de Scylla which is of Squils, is very forcible to cleanse the Cough,
slime, Looch de Scylla.
and phlegm out of the breasts, and to separate the same: it swageth all pain
and smart of the breast, and it may be thus prepared: Take the very best and
purest part of a Squill parted asunder with a wooden knife, stamp it with a
wooden pestell, and wring out the juice: take so much Honey as there is juice,
and sees it together until it be thick enough.

Of an old Cough.. 7.
IF the Cough be waxen old, and so fierce that it will not let one sleep, then
does Rasis ordain to take Myrrh, Styrax, and Opium, of each a like quantity,
and to make pills thereof, and take one or two of them. It is often showed
before how hurtful the Opium is, whereby every man may know how to deal
therewith: this following is safer: Take Syrup of Poppy heads half an ounce,
or more, or eat a little Poppie seed with Sugar, both of them make the Rheum
thick, and do stay the same that falls into the breast. Item, take a handful
of Hyssope, cut Licorice, and Currants, of each three ounces, Fenegreeke and
Linseed, of each one ounce and a half, beat them and sees them in two pintes
of water until two parts remain, cover the pot with a funnell, and receive
the vapor or reke in at the mouth.

And for that the Cough is very a common disease, therefore will it not be amiss
briefly to comprehend what things are commodious for this Cough. First, if it
proceed of heat, then are good for it the Violets and Sebestes, Dragagant,
Gum of Arabi, Starch, white Poppy seeds, Iuiubes, Mulberies, muscilage of
Barley, of Fleawort, of Quince seeds, peeled Melon seeds, Gourd seeds,
Cucumbers seeds, Purslaine, Endive, Lettice, Melons, Almonds, Sugar pennets,
oil of Violets, of water Lillies, and such like. Conserues of water Lillies do
cool and moysten the breasts, the throat and the tongue, and chiefly the
sirupe of sweet Pomegranats.

If the Cough proceeds of cold (and if it be grown old) then are these
things following very profitable, hasell Nuts, with Honey, do ripen the Cough,
Smallage, Hyssop Venus hair, Mallows, Scabious, Betony, wild Thime, white
Mints, Marioram, great and small water Mints, and Chamedrios: of roots,
Licorice, Ireos, Squils, Lillies, Elecampane, the roots of blew Flower deluce,
Garlike, boiled Calmus, Seseli, Pease, Fenegreeke seeds, Nettle seed, Annis
seed, and Fennel seed, Linseede, seeds of Verbascum peeled, and seeds of
Hollihocks, which are both good in heat and cold. Of Fruits, Figs, Dates,
Bayberies, Raisins, sweet and bitter Almonds prepared with Starch, are
special good for all Coughes, sweet oil, Pingles, sweet Pomegranats, and
Iuiubes. Of all Spices is very commodious Pepper, Cinnamom, Saffron, and
Cardamome. Further also of Gummes Bdellion, Assa foetida, Myrrha, Galbanum,
Mastix, Sagapenum, Sartocolla: Likewise Sulphur, Honey, Sugar, and all that is
sweet, Sugar pennets, Sugar candy, Agaricus, Honey combs, swallowed down or
mixed with salues, and fine Bolus.

Of Compositions, are Losinges, Barley water, many Confections, Sirupes, and
Manus Christi, whereof one that has understanding and knowledge, is to make
choice of such as he shall see to be requisite for the cause.

In like manner is highly commended for this the Conscrues of Rosemary: all
Oxymels are good for the Cough, specially they that have Agaricus in them:
notwithstanding in grievous Coughs is to be used the advice of a learned
Physician. For the Cough in children Bathing is hurtful: the drink of their
Nurses shall be water and Sugar. Also it is very good for to put always Sugar,
or the powder of Licorice in their pap.

All sour things are ill, and contrary to the Cough, as Vinegar, Veriuice, all
sour drinks and meats, and all that is cold of nature, or in any wise
sharp, are straightly forbidden.

What ordinance or government of life is to be observed (be it in cold or hot
Agues) you may see above in the second part, the second Chapter, and 2.. where
it is at length described. But this is only yet to be therewith annexed, that
all moist phlegmatic Coughes, whether they proceed of heat or cold,
reasonable walking, standing, and watching, is most meet, by reason that the
matter which causes the Cough, does always fall more into the breast sleeping
than waking.

What is good for coughing up of Phlegm.. 8.
ALbeit we have told here before what raises the Phlegm, and is commodious
for the loosing thereof, yet can it not be but expedient to rehearse here
again certain of the forementioned things, and to add other remedies more
thereto, whereby the phlegm might be furthered and brought up. The Sirupe of
Licorice is one of the most precious remedies for the Cough: after that the
sirupe of Horehound, De Prassio, and of Hyssope, De Hyssopo. If there be much
tough phlegm at hand, then is Oxymel to be tempered and drunken with Barley
water. Waters of Folefoote and Elecampane are passing good and forcible to
loose phlegm: likewise Manna, and Sugar pennets.

Will you then have good Tabulates for this? then take Starch, peeled Melon
seed, Gourd seed, Cucumber seed, and Pompeon seed, of each (being all peeled)
half an ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each three quarters of an ounce,
Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Sugar pennet^ two ounces, Saffron four
grains, Sugar candy two ounces, Violets one quarter of an ounce, seeds of
white Sesamum half an ounce, of the sirupe of Violets twelve ounces, dissolve
the Sugar therein until that you (with other things therein tempered) may cast
Tabulates. If you will make a confection thereof, (like as it will best frame
unto it) then sees not the Sugar too hard.

And you are to anoint the breast with these things following: Take Duckes
grease one ounce, fresh Butter half an ounce, oil of Sesamum and of Violets,
one ounce and a half, Saffron one scruple, Grayes grease and Wax, of each
three quarters of an ounce: melt them together, and wash it twice with Barley
water wherein some Saffron is sodden, then mingle Saffron amongst it, which is
then put amongst it because it is special good for the breast, for all manner
of coughes and heavy breath, therefore is it to be used at all times in their
meat.

Will you have the salve more maturating? then temper amongst it the muscilage
of Sesamum, and Fenegreeke, of each one ounce, with a little molten Wax. And
if so be that the belly, the fundament, the priuities, and all parts round
about them be anointed with it, then will all Rheumes be stayed therewith.
Item, the breast anointed with the salve Althea, ripeneth Phlegm, and riddeth
it very much. The like does also the pectorall unguent described in the end of
the 5.. In like manner also a stomachicall powder, which is expressed in the
first part the 13. Chapter and 1.. of the Memory, the which is also good for
the Cough, and for the Lights. Item, M. Tristrams water, and many other
remedies that are also discovered before in the sixth.

And for that there is written much of the Rheum or Catarrhe before, whereof
the said Cough is moved, and there is likewise much herafter to be said also of
the shortness of breath, the which infirmities are to have one and the self
same kind of remedies: therefore we will proceed now and speak of other
maladies which the Breasts and Lights are subject unto, and how they are best
to be cured.

Of a short panting Breath.. 9.
OF this heavy and panting breath has been mentioned before: that the lights
are by nature ordained an instrument, dwelling place, and distributors of the
breath, therefore (albeit they be subject to many diseases) yet can there not a
more dangerous accident happen unto any, than that the breath be hindered, or
cannot be drawn or yielded forth again, for that whenever this chances,
then will the affected party be quickly choked. Yet does it come to pass
oftentimes, that if any do get a short panting breath, of which if he be not
soon rid, death must needs ensue; therefore are all Physicians full of care
and trouble in the cure of the same.

And whereas this malady proceeds of many kinds of causes, therefore have
the Physicians given it many kinds of names, and specially the Grecians, which
difference we are also (as much as is possible) for to imitate and follow.

That we may therefore first speak of the pursiuenesse or shortness of the
breath, and whence the same proceeds, we will indeed first of all describe
three sorts of pursiuenesse, as Dyspnaea, Asthmaea, and Orthopnaea.

Dyspnaea is, when the breath is drawn painfully and out of course, and
therefore all that are so affected be called Dyspnaeici, who do draw their
breath with great labor through the narrowness of the breast and of the
lights, and they are more troubled in drawing it in, than in letting the same
out again.

Asthma is an uneasy drawing of breath, where there is more grief in letting
out the breath than in taking of it in, so that this happens with a strong
wheasing and noise, yea with such narrowness of the breast, that it seems
that the party would thereby yield up the ghost, and depart this world.

Orthopnaea has both these accidents, that comes commonly so strong, that
the sick person (if he be as feeble as he may) must yet notwithstanding be
always upright for fear of stifling: and these persons do find indeed, that
when they are upright, then they draw their breath in, and let it out the
easier: so that Dyspnaea is caused only through the feebleness of the drawing
in of the breath; Asthma, for lack of this force that ought to drive out the
superfluous vapors out of the lights, and Orthopnaea, where that there wants
vigor to draw the breath in, and again to let it out.

But these three infirmities of the Lights are very nigh of condition the one
to the other, yet have they their several signs from what humors they
proceed, which are chiefly caused of blood and phlegm, but less of Cholera,
and very seldom of Melancholia. The cause of this pursiuenesse may proceed as
well of outward cold, as of unnatural heat, as also of falling, thrusting,
and striking, whereby any of the inward parts of the throat be tainted or
pained, as Sinews, Arteries, Muscles, Neck, and such like, jointly or
particularly, whereby the breath is hindered, even as the same may be provoked
by some sudden strong stirring of the body, pestilent air, vapor or damp of
Quicksiluer. The inward causes are phlegmatic matter throughout the whole
body, or in any part thereof the which for the most part infecteth the head and
the lights, long and continual use of any choking and binding things. Item, if
there were any impostume in any part about the breast, as in the throat, pipe
of the lights, as in the Squinancie, pain of the stomach, suffocation of the
mother, and such like. Also when as any Rheum falls into the lights, which
is comprehended under the foresaid parts.

The outward causes must be understood by the patient himself, to wit, whether
he have led an unruly life, whether he have eaten much fruit, much Swines
flesh, much Beef, or have been fed with much Veriuice, Vinegar, Medlars, or
Chestnuts, all which do breed a short breath: but if this shortness of breath
do come of the Squina^cie, look for the signs of the same, and likewise for
other incident sicknesses, as for the signs of the Pleurisy, inflammation of
the lights, suffocation of the mother, superfluity of phlegm, even as of
either of them is sufficiently spoken in his place.

Concerning the remedies for these sicknesses, we will first of all show in
what manner the patient is to behave himself, for that helps much, and
chiefly, for that these diseases do many times so mooter and plague people (for
the space of many years) that they can neither live nor die. Because then this
pursiuenesse, coughes, and shortness of breath are caused of all humors of a
man's body, which is blood, Cholera, Phlegma, and Melancholia: therefore we
will for brevity sake, declare no certain rule of living, to the end that
every one of discretion might know to rule himself according to the nature of
every patient, and other circumstances, as also by many other instructions that
are described here and there in this book. Notwithstanding to frame an
introduction thereto, this is the beginning. If in case that this pursiuenesse
proceed of tough phlegm that obstructeth the breast, you shall know it by this,
to wit, if the patient be plagued with a grievous and pinching shortness of
breath, and that most at all times when as this tough slime shall be removed,
to wit, two hours after midnight, even until the morning. And if that he
through want of sleep, can scant come to himself through weakness of wit,
with a strange pleasant taste of his mouth, and casting out of salt phlegm,
whereby that the foot and the eyes wax bleake, the breast is without heat,
or with very little: yet the breast being burdened with a grievous Cough and
short breath; thereto comes also a heavy fraighted head, lithernes of the
whole body, a slow, feeble, and sometimes also a still pulse. And if the
matter which is impacted in the breast be stirred, then trembles the patient:
yet with these other signs more are many alterations, which are incident unto
them, according to the importance of the Ague, as it comes to pass.

Of the six unnatural things, which are called Res non naturales, whereto is
also added a rule of diet for the Pursiuenesse.. 10.
IN the Introduction of this book of Physic, in the eleventh Chapter, is a
brief discourse of these six unnatural things, the which the learned call
Non naturales, whereof we then promised to speak more at large. And to the end
this may be orderly effected, therefore are we to speak somewhat thereof at
large; and to that end, because the same is very commodious for many sicknesses
already mentioned, and others that are yet to be described hereafter. But these
are not therefore called unnatural, because they are contrary or besides
nature: for sleeping, watching, etc. are not contrary unto nature, but only
by reason they have not received their natural offspring of blood, Cholera,
Phlegma, and Melancholia, wherewith the nature of man is united and joined
together: and when they agree orderly together nature will be supported by them,
especially for that they are but accidental things, that are not nature her
self, but be the furtherers and preseruers of the same: and by reason thereof
have gotten these names, as follows.

Air.
The Air is of the learned decreed for the first, wherein they that have a
short breath are to observe this rule; to wit, that men are for the same to
choose a subtle, warm, and dry Air. Contrariwise, men are to shun the cold
and moist, and chiefly the South wind, for that oftentimes is an occasion of a
narrow breast or pursiuenesse. But if you cannot get such an air, then make
fire in your chamber of Juniper wood, and of a Bay tree, Cypers wood, Beeche^
wood, Oken wood, and such like. Item make a fume with Myrrh, Laudanum, Ambra,
Musk, and red Styrax, three ounces; temper them all together in Sage, wild
Thime, Penniroyall, and all manner of odoriferous herbs. Or if one be kept in a
Stoue, the same must be made but meetely warm. All places next to the earth,
and all vaulted chambers must he refrain. The windows of his chamber must
stand toward the East and North, the which in the heat of the morning until
noone are to be kept open, and afterward shut up; and when the Sun begins
to go down, then to open the same again, thereby to refresh the air.

All dwellings that stand beside still standing pooles, are to be avoided. In
like manner also all dark, cloudie, thick, and stinking air. And when you are
to go abroad, then is the Pomander following to be carried in your hand, and
smelt to continually. Take Spica of Indy, Galingall, and Mace, of each one
dragme, Laudanum half an ounce, Frankincense, Sandaraca, of each half a
dragm, Musk and Ambra, of each two scruples, make thereof a Pomander with
Malmsey. Look also that the chamber of his dwelling be strewed with herbs of
hot natures: but from Rue and Smallage let him beware, for that they hurt the
brains. Or sprinkle often the chamber with wine wherein the same herbs are
sodden.

Motion.
Motion: Motus is accounted the second unnatural thing: touching this is
commanded in the straightnes of the breast, that whenever any such do rise
in the morning, that he shall go forthwith and ease himself, and beware how he
wear any clothes that are narrow about the neck and breast: yet must he wear
clothes well lyned, but no lyning of any Beasts that frequent the water, or of
Wolves. He must also not wear any heavy thing on his head; yet must he see
that his head be well covered always, and defended from the cold, with a light
Cap or Hat. He must also give himself to meetely stout walking, or to ride upon
an easy trotting horse, or to shoot in a handbow, or use such like exercises.
In the evening one hour before, and one hour after meat, shall he exercise
himself, yet not above his ability, so that the short breath be not moved
too much, wherewith Venerie is also comprehended, for that it is a deadly
poison to a full stomach, by reason that the same ought to be done six hours
after meals. But if these exercises cannot be achieved by reason of great
feebleness and other occasions, then in stead of them the patient is to be
well rubbed with hot clothes over all his outward or utmost parts, even as the
same is sufficiently taught in the second part of the first Chapter and. 3. and
in other places. This rubbing may be also well effected with oil of Cammomill,
Dill, or with Sallad oil, and in such manner that if the shortness of breath
be extreme, then in the beginning is he to be futhed, and rubbed mightily, and
afterward very midly: and this is all to be done in such sort as the patient
may well abide and suffer it.

If there be great weakness approaching, then let his clothes be fumed with
Musk, Amber, Cinnamom, Lignum Aloes, Gallia Muscata, and such like: or lay on
those parts certain clothes which have been wetted in Malmsey, or any other
kind of Wine, wherein Cloves, Galingall, Mace, Spica, etc. are decocted.

Sleep and watching are said to be the third unnatural thing. And for this
sickness is commanded that men give themselves to steep at any hand, be it
at noone or evening, Sleep.
but only two hours after meat: but it is better that one utterly forbear
sleeping a days: seven or 8. hours long is the fittest time for sleeping, yet
the same may be diminished or augmented according to the custom of the sick
body; or his diet. First they are to lie high with their heads, and on the
right side, until the digesture of the stomach be consummated: and afterward
awhile on the left side, and then again on the right side, and to lie upon the
belly is commodious for digesture, but it is not good for the eyes. To lie upon
the back is most perilous, and a cause of all diseases of the brains, the
Sinews, the Palsy, the Frenzy, and such like, because that thereby all
superfluity of the humors do fall down backwards: contrariwise, measurable
watching strengthens much, yet according to the importance and custom of
nature, and power of all natural humidities; for if one take not heed
thereto, then comes none other thereof, then all mishap. How that all
excessive watching shall be withstood, is to be seen in the first part the 12.
Chapter, and 6..

Repletion and inanition are the fourth unnatural things, which the Latinists
do call Repletionem, Repletion and ma^^tion.
and Inanitionem. You must have an especial care that the body be kept free
from all superfluous humors, for thence do grow many and sundry infirmities,
wherefore it is necessary that they be expelled in the morning through going to
the stool, through the urine and sweating, and by all other such like means.
And if so be that nature cause not all this of it self then ought it to be
compassed through the help of stronger means: and first to begin with the
easiest remedies, that is, with meat and drink, but if the same cannot be
perfected, then must other things be used according to the quality of the
disease: but what serves best for the grief in the breast (whereof we here do
treat) shall be showed hereafter.

The first part of the foresaid unnatural things is called of the learned
Accidenti^animi, Affections of the mind.
which are things that concern the mind, as anger, rage, weeping,
frightednesse, fear, heaviness of the mind, sorrow, and such like, whereof
also proceed great sicknesses, and thereby this disease of the breast is
specially increased, for that thereby are the tough phlegm in the breast
drawn, and the bringing of them up hindered, therefore are all such sick
folks to be always merry and of good cheer.

The sixth and last part and unnatural thing is meat and drink, Meat and
drink.
of which all is to be chosen that is good, and to forbear all that is
hurtful. For that it is a general rule, that those so infected are never to
be ouerladen with meat and drink. Also it is better that such do moderate
themselves, taking at three times but a little, than at one time or two times
to ouercharge themselves with meat and drink. Secondly, that they swallow not
down the meat vnchewed. Thirdly, they that have a grief in their breast, are
to forbear eating of all that is cold, moist, slimie, and astringent of
nature, as unleavened bread, sodden fish, beef, inwards, and feet of all
beasts: also Milk, Cheese, and all that is dressed with Milk, Lettice,
Purslaine, Beets, Spinach, etc. may he not eat. Meats that be good for him,
are well raised white bread which is not above three days old, and bread
wherein Annis seed, Licorice, Saffron, Cinamome, and Fennel are baked. Of
flesh is to be chosen good Mutton, Veale, Lamb, Kids, Hares, Conies, Roe
buckes, and the lungs of a Fox. Of Fowls these are very commodious, Hens,
Pullets, Capons, young Pigeons, Phesants, Partriches, Blackbirds, wild Ducks
rather boiled than roasted. Also there be good for him Broths, Coleworts,
Parsley, Fennel, Mints, Sage, and Hyssop, which are to be used often, but
Turnips and Spinach very seldom: dry Figs, Raisins, and Currants eaten before
dinner and supper are much commended. And his meat is to be dressed with Fennel
seeds, Annis seed, Comine, Carawayes, Pepper, and such like things more. Pease
porredge and Bean broth is also good for him to use: likewise Raisins decocted
in Almond milk, or Goats milk. To have his meat dressed with Sugar and honey
is very good, Vinegar or Veriuice tempered with any kind of Spice, as Saffron,
Ginger, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinamome, or Cardamome. In stead of Sallad oil is
fresh Butter, Barrows grease, and Goosegrease good for him. Further all that be
grieved in the breast, shall occupy much these herbs in their drinks and
otherwise, as Venus hair, Hyssope, Horehound, Elecampane, and Saffron.

For his drink, Wine is not utterly forbidden, but he may drink some small
draughts, and that the oftener, Sweet and pleasant Wine is most wholesome for
him, tempered in the Summer with Well water, and in Winter with decocted water,
notwithstanding that good sweet red Wine were as good. But if the patient will
not gladly drink Wine, then is this meade following to be prepared for him:
Take three quarts of the water of Cinamome and Saffron, of each one dragme and
a half, Hyssope one dragme, sees it so long until the fourth part be sodden
away; then put thereto twelve ounces of honey, and sees it again till the
third part be sodden away: skumme it, and then let it run through a cloth. Of
all wines the Renish wine is most commended, brued a little with water, for it
fumeth not into the head, but hasteneth toward the bladder, and caryeth the
matter with it. Sweet Limons, Pomegranates and Quince pears, being well
sugared, are also permitted for the appetite: but Marmalade strengthens much
the breast and lights.

This is then the order to be observed in this sickness, chiefly when as it
proceeds of phlegm, and not for any short time, but the same is still to be
continued: for as we have already showed, this sickness is of long
continuance, and perilous, so that if one do his very best therein, yet it is
in young persons very hard, and in old folks almost impossible to be cured.
And although there be many sicknesses of the breasts (like as is already
rehearsed, and shall be yet again spoken of hereafter) yet is there no
euidenter means for to know whether the Lights be infected or fraighted, then
through the Cough, and by that which is cast up in coughing. It is also to be
noted, whether the breathing be uneasy, slow and wheasing, etc. For the
troublesomnesse of the pain, and of the fetching up of the phlegm, do bewray
the matter which causes the disease and vlceration of the Lights, therefore
must all Physicians look diligently unto it: for when the matter is known,
then is it easily to be discerned, whereof this grief in the breast is caused.
This may suffice for this present.

Of the breast oppressed with Phlegm.. 11.
WHen any such sicknesses do light upon men, then must they be known and
discerned (as is already recited) therefore we will write first of Phlegma, as
of the most common infection of the breast. In this sickness is first the
Basilica to be opened in the right arm, letting out four or five ounces of
blood, and afterward this drink following to be used.

Take ten or twelve Figs, Dates, Smallage seeds, Fennel seeds, Venus
hair, Hyssope and Horehound, of each five dragmes, sees them together unto
about the half, take about three ounces thereof, and temper therewith this
Confection following, and take such once in every three days, or once in every
four, five or six days, for it exceedingly expels the superfluous matter
from the breast.

Take the juice of Licorice, Hyssope, and Venus hair, of each ten dragmes,
Pepper, bitter Almonds, Aristologie, Cresses seeds, and Nettle seed, of each
three dragms, Honey as much as is needful for to make a confection; the Honey
must be boiled and clarified. But above all it is to be advised, that after
letting blood he take one dragme, or four scruples of Pillulae de Agarico,
which are much commended for this sickness. Or use these pills following:
Pillulae de Hiera compositae, Aurearum, of each two scruples, make thereof seven
or nine pills with sirupe of Roses, and take thereof twain early in the morning:
and five hours after that take a draught of lean Hen broth; and then one
hour afterward break your fast. The next day, take in the morning this
preparatiue Syrup. de Bizantijs, de Calamintha, de Glicyrrhiza, of each half
an ounce, water of Cicorie, of Violets and Balm, of each one ounce, temper
them all together, and drink thereof eight days long fasting. When this is
done, then take this purgation following: Take Electuarij Indi, two dragmes, De
Psyllio half an ounce, temper them all together in a little warm wine, and
drink it in the morning early. Some do counsel also, that after purging heed
be taken that one vomit with beaten Mustard seed and Honey: for that does
vehemently expel the matter off the stomach. And if that you perceive the
matter be to be cast up, then take the water of blew Flower de luce, Hyssope
and Marioram, of each one ounce, water of Folefoote two ounces, Sugar half an
ounce; temper and use them every morning for the space of one whole week:
afterward take three ounces of new Cassie, and water of Folefoote wherein two
scruples of Rhapontica, and Spica half a scruple were steeped, drink it
warm, and fast six hours after it.

This unguent following may also be used every day, anointing the belly warm
therewith covering it with a piece of warm fur: Take oil of Saffron, oil of
Cammomill, of each three quarters of an ounce, Ducks, and Badgers grease, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron half a scrup. white Pepper, Ireos, and
Rue, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Wax as much as is needful,
thereof to make an unguent or salve.

Here is also to be noted, that all sour and egar things, and all that is
dressed therewith, as sour Pomegranates, Orenges, Limons, and such like, are
very hurtful: In like manner is also gross sour wine and Sallad oil very
hurtful. These pills following are to be prepared: Take good pot Aloe three
dragmes, Agaricus and the root of Polypodie, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Coloquint one drag. Spica, Ginger, and Indie salt, of each half a scruple;
beat them all together, and steep them in the juice of Roses and of Endive,
of each two ounces, keep it in a warm place, stir it about till it wax
dry, then afterward power thereon again two ounces of the juice of Marioram
gentle, and let it dry also. Thirdly, temper therewith two ounces of the juice
of small Endive, and half a scruple of Saffron: when it is dry, then take the
weight of a drag. thereof, make pills of it; of which take always one every
fifth day before supper, and one more two hours after. This may every such
patient use all his life long in all countries. The like also when he uses the
preparatiue Potions, if he be bound in his body, he may freely take one of them
in the evening before meat.

These pills have great force to preserve health; for they cleanse the breast,
the stomach, and the liver. He must eat every week a piece of green Ginger,
and fast at least four hours after it.

In winter time must he strew upon his head twice a week, this powder
following: Take Lignum Aloes one dragme, Mace one quarter of an ounce, Stechas,
Marioram gentle, and gross Marioram, of each one scruple, Roses, Iuorie, and
Sandaraca, of each one drag. and a half, beat all small and temper them
together. For a confection: take Spec. Aromatici Rosati, Trociscos de Rosis and
de Spica, of each half a drag. six ounces of white Sugar, make thereof
Tabulates, and eat thereof after meat. If you use not green Ginger, then is
also good for you, the Tabulats of Diaireos Salomonis, and more confections that
serve for this end, even as it is described in the discovery of Asthma. There
is a fume also to be made for this patient, with Myrrh, Costus roots,
Saffron, Cassia wood, Aristologie, or Galbanum, which likes him best, each
alone, or mixed together. Also he is every evening to wash his feet, even to
beneath the knees in warm fresh water, wherein Roses and Violets, of each two
handfuls, Mints, Marioram and Stechas, of each one handful, have been sodden.

Of the right pursiuenesse with a sore old Cough through tough Phlegma in the
Breast, which is called with one word Asthma.. 12.
BY this name Asthma some later Physicians comprehend the three foresaid
species of pursiuenesse, to wit Dispnaea, Asthma, and Orthopnaea, for that the
breath in these three sorts is hardly drawn, which is peradventure because
all the diseases of the breast and the Lights have a natural participation
together, that they are very hardly to be discerned, even as may be well
observed out of these desciptions following, where the lights and breast
commonly are comprehended together: nevertheless they have partly their
difference, whereof we (as far as is possible) shall give good instructions.

It happens also oftentimes, that these plegmaticke humors do fall out of the
head into the lights and breast, that they fill them full, and if then that
nature be not so strong that she can avoid or consume the tough slime, then will
it corrupt there, and convert into that, whereof then (if it be not looked to)
the Hectica or Phthisis, which is the consumption, is wont to follow, as
hereafter shall appear. Therefore is this Asthma to be always prevented: for
when it begins to be confirmed, then is there no more help to be done, nor
cure to be wrought.

As much as then concerns the order of living in this sickness, he must (as
much as is possible) rule himself according to these foresaid ordinances; for
which, all they that are vexed with Asthma, are to have twice a week cups
fastened on their buttockes without picking: what is further fit, as to open the
breast, and to bring up phlegm, you have good remedies in the second Chapter
of the Cough, and yet more not long before in the 8.. that may stand also in
some stead for this purpose.

Now follow diverse confections and other medicines that are good for Asthma,
Take Sage, Venus hair, Folefoote leaves, Lungwort, Violet leaves, and Hyssop,
of each a handful, Penniroyall and Thime, of each half a handful, flowers of
Buglosse, Violets, Burrage, and Cicorie, of each half so much, Annis seed,
and Fennel seed, and seeds of Mallows, of each half an ounce, Elecampane
and Licorice, of each three quarters of an ounce, Parsley and Polypody roots,
of each half an ounce, ten or twelve Figs, Currants four ounces, prepared
Agaricke three dragmes, Spica, Squinant, Galingall, and Cinnamom, of each half
a dragme, Ginger and grains: sees this altogether with a mild fire in
sufficient water, until there do remain about a pint, wring and strain it
well out, then put as much Sugar unto it as you think good, and let it sees
to the thickness of Honey, use this Lambatiue, and lick thereof as much and as
often you please.

Confection of Currants.
The Confection of Currants, which are used of all Apothecaries, is thus
prepared: Take Piony roots half an ounce, dried Hyssope, Baulme, and Hearts
tongue, of each half a handful, Licorice cut small half an ounce: sees these
al together in sufficient rain water, wring it hard out, and strain it
through a cloth: Put into this decoction washed Currants that be well powned:
sees it once again with the decoction, and strain it through a cloth or a
hairne scarce, put thereto a pound of Sugar, and let it sees into a
confection: it is special good to open the breast, to swage the Cough, and to
maturate the phlegm.

Another. Take washed Currants, or Raisins five ounces, sees them softly until
that they swell, power them into a sieue and press them through, put thereto
twelve ounces of Sugar, and then sees them together into a confection.

This Confection following is good for the common people, take Colewort leaves
with the red stalks, cut the stalks and ribs, stamp them in a wodden mortar, an
strain out the juice: let it sees, and take as much Honey as there is juice;
sees it all together unto the thickness of Honey, stirring it always about. If
you will have it stronger, than temper some Saffron amongst it. Another. Take
Hollyhock roots one ounce, Elecampane half an ounce, let them sees together in
water of Violets, stamp them to pap, temper therewith one dragme of Cheruill
seed, and make thereof a confection with sodden Sugar, let them sees together
in water of Violets, stamp them to pap, temper then therewith one dragme of
Cheruill seed, and make thereof a confection with sodden Sugar, let them sees
together until they be thick.

Or take one dragme of Rubarb, oil of fresh Almonds three ounces, and two
ounces of the cream of Milk, temper them together boiled on warm ashes, and
use thereof often, for it is very good. Some put thereto one dragme of Rubarb
more, which is not to be discommended.

Young children may have this kind of powder prepared: Take Masticke,
Frankincense, and Citron pills, of each a like much, beat it small together,
wherewith rub the child softly in the seame of his scull. Afterward give him
hereof to lick; take fresh oil of sweet Almonds, temper therein white Sugar
beaten; but if the obstruction of the breast be much, then te^per amongst it
Trociscos de Agarico, or give him the powder thereof to drink; in like manner
also Rubarb with Spica of Indie, with Cinnamom, or Squinant, according to the
importance of the cause. Old folks may use this as well as young children.

How commodious the Cassia is for all sore Coughs, is sufficiently declared in
our Introduction. But for this pain in the breast, it is needful that it be
tempered with Agarick, or some other thing, according to the quality of the
sickness. But for this is especial heed to be taken for women with child,
that it be not given them without great cause, because it makes pain or ache
in the belly.

Item, take Sulphur vise two grains, temper it with a little Honey, and so take
it in, for it is marvelous good.

There is also to be had ready at some Apothecaries a costly compound Trociscos
de Sulphur, Trocisci de sulphur Adulphi.
or called Adulphi, and is thus prepared: take losinges of Cole, Dragagant, and
Sugar pennets, of each half an ounce, Ginger two scruples, Licorice three
dragmes, Ireos one scruple, Hyssop, Nettle seed, Rosemary flowers, Saffron and
Sulphur vife, of each seven grains, mix it with Looch sanum, and form
trocisces thereof, take a little of it, letting it melt alone in the mouth, and
use it often.

They make also a Confection of Brimstone: take Sulphur vife one scruple, mix
it with fresh Butter, and Muscilage of Linseede, or Elecampane one ounce, take
thereof often, and a little at once.

The Confection of Fox lights, that is, Looch de pulmone Vulpis, is above all
other remedies, Loo^h de pulmone Vulpis.
for the Asthma (which is a shortness of breath) very much commended; for it is
not only good for a sore Cough and short breath, but it heals and cleanses
all ulcers of the breast and Lights. And for the consumption it excels all
other remedies, and is made thus: Take prepared Fox lights, the juice of
Licorice, Annis seed, Fennel seed, and Venus hair, of each half an ounce,
clarified Sugar seven ounces and a half; beat these together, and decocted
with Sugar in the water of Folefoote leaves, temper it into a confection.

Hereafter follow some good Potions for this shortness of breath. Take
Sebestes, Figs and Dates, of each four, Venus hair, Violets, Currants and
Licorice, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Poppy seed one ounce,
Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, Annis seed, Fennel, Agrimonie, Hyssope, of
each one ounce, 20. Iuiubes, Sugar or Honey five ounces, three or four pintes
of water: let this sees together until the third part be sodden away, strain
the liquor through a cloth, and put the Sugar thereto or honey, and let it sees
again until it be clear.

Ite^ take 3. quarters of an ounce of Figs, Dates, Horehound, Smallage seed,
Fennel, Roses, Venus hair, Hyssope and Licorice, of each five dragmes; sees
them as before, or to the half.

The common people may sees water with honey and Hyssope: and as the shortness
of breath begins to lessen, he must lay one dragme of Agaricus in the water
of Betonie and Hyssope to steep, and temper amongst it some honey of Roses, and
so drink it together. Also the common Meade, and Sugar water, is good to
drink.

Another Potion. Take a pint and half of white wine, steep therein one
handful of Horehound; let it sees together until the third part, strain it
and put thereto six ounces of clarified Honey; let it sees a little together,
and scum it diligently, whereof the patient is to drink every day two or three
ounces. Some do take three ounces of Honey, and do melt therein half an ounce of
Turpentine washed, or as much Oxymel: Both are good and sure.

A marvelous good medicine which is highly esteemed in Turkey. Take the liver
of a Wolf, the Milt, Lights and brains: salt well the brains, and take of
these four of each a like much, let them be dried well that they may be
powned: Give the patient thereof one quarter of an ounce with a little fresh
broth three days one after another in the morning fasting, and let him fast
afterward five or six hours. The sick party must take his drink through
the Wolfes throat; and when this is so done, they report that they (which use
the same) be from thenceforth freed of it all the year following: but if it
return not within one twelve month, that then it will never come again. And
if he had this sickness any more afterward, they advise that one should make
a lace of the Wolfes maw, and wear the same all his life time on his naked
body; for thereby should he be certainly freed of this sickness. But to try
these things is the best way.

Water distilled of Elecampane, or broth wherein it is decocted is very good,
and chiefly if it be mingled therewith.

Hereafter are some things described, which the diseased may hold under his
tongue without chewing as big as a bean, and swallow it down by little and
little.

Take Looch de Pino one ounce and a half, Sugar pennets half an ounce, powne
them together. Item, take Looch de Farfaria (called ad Asthma) as much as you
think meet, and as much powned Hollihock roots, make a hard confection
thereof with prepared honey or sugar. And if any do resist these weak things,
then shall he in the stead thereof use Diapenidion described in this Chapter
and 6.. And if it happen (as it woonteth often) that the sick person by reason
of this cough cannot sleep, then is he once or twice a week to take this
potion when he goes to bed.

Take placents of Ireos one dragme, the confection of Philonium Romanum half a
scruple, temper it with one ounce and a half of Hyssop water, and at the same
time strew on the top of the patients head this powder following: Take
Sandaraca one quarter of an ounce, Cloves one drag. Mace two scruples, Roses,
water Lillies, Violets, and Poppie heads, of each half a drag. Lignum Aloes one
scruple, stamp each a part and temper them together.

Plasters or Unguents for this Asthma.
TAke fat Dates and Figs, of each one ounce, Mallows, Hollihocke leaves, of
each three handfuls, roots of Mallows and of Hollihockes, of each half an
ounce, cut them to pieces, and boil them together into a pappe, mix Pigeon
dung amongst it, Turpentine, and Rosin, of each one ounce, the muscilage of
Linseede, and of Fenegreeke as much as is needful for to make a mild plaster,
lay it warm upon the breast; the same does also the fat sheep wool.

Item, take Comfrey roots, broad and narrow Plantaine, Purslaine, and Henbane,
choppe them small and sees them together in the waters of Plantaine and
Purslaine until it be thick, beaten well and mixed with Pomegranate pills,
Acorne cups, Galls, and Myrtle seed (which have been steeped eight hours in
warm water:) then strained out hard and powered to the rest and boiled unto a
little; afterward mingle it with fine Bolus, the meal of Lupines, and Barley
meal, of each half an ounce, Gummi Helenij one quarter of an ounce, Wax and
Turpentine as much as is needful for to make a meetely thick plaster, then
spread it on a leather and lay it upon the breast. The unguent Althea is very
good to anoint the breast withal, as the same is often here before commanded
to be used.

Item, anoint the breasts with the oil of Wall flowers, of Bays and Dill
tempered together or each a part. Or take oil of Violets and of sweet Almonds,
of each one ounce, Duckes grease and butter, of each four ounces, Saffron two
scruples, white Wax as much as needs for to make a soft Unguent.

Certain excellent things in general.. 13.
THese things following are much commended for all diseases of the breast, and
for all coughes in general. First, the gum Ammoniacum dissolved in Barley
water and honey, and taken: Aristologie, bitter Almonds, and oil of sweet
Almonds dressed with all meats, Boiled Sothernwood, Balsam wood, and the fruits
of the same: prepared Coloquint is wonderful good for this, being used in pills:
Cypers decocted in wine, confected Elecampane roots, Galbanu^, the roots of
blew Flower de luce, Myrrh put into pills of Agaricus, Coriander and Spikenard
seed, rere eggs supt up, or Cawdles made thereof, Leekes with Barley water and
honey, Nettles and their seed with Barley water and Honey, Woodbind, Sandaraca,
green Rue boiled in Vinegar, Squils are special good, roasted, or howsoever
you will use them; for that they be commended and esteemed above all other
medicines. Saffron tempered in the broth of a Cock, wild Saffron seed, the gum
Sagapenum given in with Rue water, Sesely seeds, Fox longs prepared one dragme
only, Hyssope and all that is prepared with this herb, is good for the lights
and the whole breast, confected roots of the Star thistle Eryngton, conserve of
Rosemary, and all that is made of Rosemarie, Betony, Gilloflowers, and all that
is made thereof: Nutmegs that are confected, do consume all superfluous humors,
not only of the Lights, but also of all the inward parts, albeit that some
suppose, that they are hurtful for ye Lights: Walnuts that are confected in
Sugar or Honey, do warm the Lights and all inward parts, for which this thing
following is very good. Take a sweet Pomegranate, cut it in four parts, Strew
the pieces with Sugar candy, and bind them together again, binding or wrapping
them in a moist cloth, and let them roast leisurably, then take out the coare,
and eat it for a medicine. Conserues of Eyebright opens al inward members,
and all obstructions of the Lights, like as does also the wine which is
described in the first Part against the diminishing of the sight.

Calmus which is confected, has a special power for the opilation of the
Lights, and to open all inward obstructions.

Comin does also the same, Caraway and Fennel confected, or eaten raw:
likewise Fennel is good for all Coughes, roughness of the throat, and
hoarsenesse. Treacle and Mithridate are also very good for this. Al Losinges of
Diapenidion, of Dragagant, juice and sirup of Licorice, and all kinds of
Oxymel (as is already said) are altogether marvelous good for this disease.
Siliquae roasted in ashes are also good against all shortness of breath, and
all kinds of Coughs: M. Tristams water: In like manner both the sirups of
Vinegar, Simplex and Compositus are also special good for this purpose. Also
all the forementioned Potions for the Cough and the breast, even as they are set
down in the second Chapter. 2. In like manner also a costly stomachicall
powder, which is described in the first Part, the 12. Chapter. 1. that may be
also used for Asthma.

Of shortness of breath through Cholera.. 14.
IN the beginning of the description of this shortness of breath we have
showed, that the same is caused very seldom of Cholera; and if the same should
be caused thereby, then is the same yet to be cured through the same means, as
in all places are expressed hereafter and before.

Therefore is here no special matter to treat of, but only the signs that
are of this sickness through Cholera, and afterward to see wherewith to delay
the heat.

As concerning the signs thereof, it comes with great drought, heat, and
gnawing about the breast, and the same rather in the right than in the left
side, with a yellow color al over the breast, wherewith comes also a roughnes
of the tongue and of the throat, and especially about the time when the Cholera
accustometh to move and stir, which is from three a clock until nine in the
day time, whereby the patient will also cast up small store of phlegm, and that
is yellowish: In his sleep appears yellow things, and fiery fantasies, as
lightning, and such like. The pulse is hard, quick, and continual, except the
patient had lost most part of his natural strength: the Urine is thick,
yellow, and ruddie, but in the bottom clear and subtle: yet do these signs
alter with every mutation of an accident, according to the which every expert
person may know to direct himself. These things following do cool the heat
of the breast in general, and the inflammation of ye Lights, as Cassia, new
Conserues of Roses, Iulep of Roses, sirupe of Roses, and such like; conserues
of Burrage, Buglosse, and their wine, if they be not expressly forbidden for
some reason.

In like manner the Cherry wine, which is of a temperate nature. Item, Conserve
of Violets and Iulep, Conserues of Cicorie do cleanse all inward members of
Cholera, drives it out through the stool, and does withstand all Agues of
Cholera. Peaches confected in Sugar are also a special comfortatiue for all
hot diseases, for that they cool all inward members, like as does also the
Conserues of water Lillies.

Take the juice of Chickweede, and Verueine, or the water wherein they are
decocted (if you please) it is very good for all Coughes. Sirup of the right
Endive is special good for hot Lights, and for all inward hot parts. Likewise
also Manna of himself and his confection, Electuarium de Manna, which is ready
to be had at all Apothecaries.

Of the shortness of breath through Melancholia.. 15.
EVen so it is also with Asthma through Melancholia, which is through the
heavy blood, that happens very seldom, whereof these are the signs: a
right leaden color of the face and the breast, running eyes, with great
heaviness of the spirits, wherewith is also a fearfulness, faintnes of heart,
desire to be solitary, especially from nine of the clock in the day time,
until two or three in the night: he complains also of more abatement or
lack of breath in the left than in the right side, and of little sleep: he is
also vexed with many heavy fantasies, he cougheth up much thin spettle, and
that with much ado: his water is thin, white and clear, his going to stool is
lead colored and hard. There is heard much rumbling and wind in his breast and
in all the body. Yet do these signs alter through diverse occasions, so that
you must note the meat and drink that the patient has accustomed himself to
use before time.

How this disease is to be remedied and cured, you shall find in the first
part, the twelfth Chapter,. 8. of Madness, of Melancholia, and all that is said
in the third part of the foul melancholicke blood.

Of the shortness of breathing or Pursiuenesse through wind.. 16.
WHereas there is any short breath, or heaviness in the breast through wind,
the same will be always augmented through meats and medicines that engender
wind, as may well be noted through the rumbling and course of the wind in the
breast and other places more.

For this must be used, Rue, and Penniroyall, of each one ounce and a half,
Serapinum, Opopanacum of each one dragme, Comin one ounce and a half: all this
being beaten together, make thereof a salve with molten Wax, and anoint the
breast therewith very warm. This salve is also very good for all heavy
breathing that proceeds of gross tough matter, and that is impacted into the
Lights: for it separateth and consumes the same. What further might be done
for this, that may you sufficiently perceive by all the forementioned Treatise,
wherein has been spoken of this sickness. For this short and sore breath
through wind cannot be alone by it self: but there must be with it either
Cholera, or Phlegma, or Melancholia, or blood: of all which there is
sufficiently written.

Of the spetting blood through some disease of the Lights.. 17.
THe spetting of blood may come of many occasions of the brains, which are
wont to be eased through bleeding at the nose, whereof is written in the first
part the eight Chapter, and 7..

Secondly, through any hurting or brusing of the throat or the mouth, for which
you are to look in the first part the 13. Chapter.

Thirdly, through hurting of the gums, whereof we have sufficiently mentioned
in the first part: also the sa^e is sometimes caused of the Lights, breast and
stomach, also of the Liver and of the mother, etc. This spetting of blood do
the Greeks call Hemoptoin, whereof we will write at this present.

The cause of this bleeding may happen through falling, thrusting, and such
like outward occasions of the breast, or of any horsleach drunken, through
great heat, or great cold, strong coughs, to cry loud, to vomit much and
vehemently, through long use of hot peppered meats, or through use of onions
and garlic, through much subtle blood, through neglect of accustomed letting
blood, and through some disease of the lights: or when a vein chances to
break, whereof hereafter we shall discourse in particular.

The signs of this spetting of blood that comes out of the breast, or out of
the Lights are, that when the same proceeds out of the breast, then will
there be felt great pain in the same: and contrariwise, when it proceeds out
of the lungs, there will be felt very little pain, the spetting blood, out of
the breast is not so perilous as that from the Lights. But when there is a
vein broken open, then runs it most abundantly. If it be caused of any
other inconvenience, as of impostumations, bruses, or hurts, then comes up
but little blood, and that full of scum.

When as then a sick man through haking without coughing fetches up blood, it
comes from some little veins about the throat, where you may easily come by
it with any kind of remedies: but the patient for this disease must forbear
to eat excessive meat and drink, by reason that thereby much blood is
engendered, whereby through the superabounding in the veins the throat
opens: but if he be provoked to such bleeding through vomiting, then it is a
sign that it comes from the stomach: the which is not much to be feared,
for that the same is to be easily prevented through letting blood, setting
boxing cups, opening the mother vein, or opening their terms or flowers: in
like sort by taking some astringent things, as the seeds of Sumach, sower
grapes, and such like. Item, through this potion following: Take fine Bolus,
Gum, Dragon blood, Pomegranate blossoms, and Frankincense, of each a like much,
powne them together to powder, and take thereof three dragmes, and temper it
with sodden juice of Quince pears. For meat is very good, Starch, peeled
Beans, Lentils, Pease, unleavened bread, Turtle doves, and common Pigeons. Of
fruits, all that bind, as Medlars, Services, Quince pears, Prunes, Pears,
and such like. For drink, milk wherein are quenched glowing pibble stones,
steeled water, thick red wine a little now and then, sirupe of Poppie heads
tempered with water, wherein Quince kernels and Myrtle seeds are decocted. It
happens oftentimes that such spetting of blood comes of it self, without any
cause at all, whereby the patient is neither hindered nor harmed at all, and is
to have his course: but if the same do chance through coughing, which is a
sign that the same ascends from the lights and the breast, then is it to be
feared, that it will be Phthisis, that is, the co^sumption which then ensues,
because one cannot come to this place with necessary remedies. Then for this
sickness it is best to let blood immediately at the first, and that in the
Liver vein, whereby the blood may be derived from the Lights. Others do first
of all open the Saphaea on the feet, that the blood might be drawn downwards,
and always on the same side that it is adjudged the disease to be. The third
sort counsel for this disease, to set boxing cups on their buttockes. This
being all done, the patient is to be laid in a cool chamber, where he may be
as quiet as may be, without much stirring of himself, and must keep from him
all that might inflame his blood, as anger, crying, copulation, laughing, hot
couerings, hot and salt meats and drink, bathing and such like. There are
also no red colors to be brought in his sight. Above all this, binding is one
of the principallest remedies against abundant bleeding, therefore is that also
here to be used, as in other places is sufficiently taught.

There are ordained many mo remedies against this spetting of blood, even as
hereafter follows, whereof you may choose that which likes you best.

Take Frankincense and Dragon blood, of each three dragmes and one scruple, of
yellow Amber one dragme, prepared Bloudstone and sealed earth, of each ten
dragmes, Allume two dragmes and a half, flowers of Pomegranats three dragmes,
Opium two dragmes, Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, make thereof 18. trocisces
with sirupe of Poppie heads, then temper every day one in Purslaine water, and
so drink it. And if this spetting of blood be too violent, then may the
patient take one more at night.

These things following are more certain, because of the Opium: Take Mumia,
Mastick, fine Bolus, and Dragon blood, of each alike much, being all beaten
small together, make trocisces thereof with Purslaine water: for this is also
good Trocisci de Carabe, and of Terra Sigillata.

Now follow certain confections and such like, wherewith the cause of this
spetting of blood will be taken away, for the which this following is a
certain remedy. Take a dragme of Egshels beaten small, and temper it with
half an ounce of the sirupe of Poppie heads, or sirupe of Iuiubes: temper also
with it the confection of Philonium Romanum, half a scruple, and so take it:
if you had rather drink it, then mix it with some Purslaine water. Item, take
conserues of Roses and Violets of each one ounce, the co^fection of
Triasandalon three ounces, prepared red Coral, Purslaine seed, and broad
Plantaine seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them together with Rose
water. Or take the spices of cold Dragagant cakes half an ounce, yellow Amber,
prepared red Coral, Bloudstone, fine Bolus, Plantaine seeds, and Housleeke,
of each one dragme and a half, Gum, broad Plantaine seed, of each half a
dragme, Mastick, Frankincense, of each three grains, Raisins one ounce, white
Sugar as much as is needful, Purslaine water and Rose water, of each two
ounces; sees therewith the Sugar, until it be as thick as Honey, and temper
the rest being beaten small amongst it. Item, take Pingles one ounce, Currants
one ounce and a half, beaten Licorice half an ounce, Ginger one drag.
Cinnamome two drag. as much Sugar as the rest: sees them with the water of
Plantaine, and temper the rest, being chopped and beaten amongst it.

Take Henbane seeds ten grains, prepared Coral one scruple, two or three
ounces of Plantaine water, temper them together, and give it him to drink: put
also thereto the tabulats of Diatragacanthum, the confection of Diacodion, Looch
de Portulaca, each alone, or tempered to a confection with the sirupe of
Myrtles: the red losinges are also to be holden in the mouth that stand
described with other. Treacle or Mithridate do maruellously withstand the
spetting of blood, if there be taken of them one dragme and a half, tempered
with Vinegar and Purslaine water. The confection of Fox lights described here
before in the 12.. are also highly commended above all other remedies.

Against all clodded blood in the breast, be it of any wounds or otherwise, you
are to drink this: take field Cypers, stamp it small, and lay it 24. hours to
steep in Scabious water, wring it well out, and drink oftentimes thereof warm.

Item, take the herb Horsetaile, beat it to powder, and drink thereof every
time one drag. with Plantaine water twice a day. This powder may you also cast
upon the meat, and a little Bloudstone mixed amongst it. Item, take prepared
Bloudstone, mix it with water or juice of Purslaine, and swallow it down; for
this stone has a special force to stanch blood, like as experience brings
with it. Or take two scruples of prepared Bloudstones, and temper it with the
renning of a young Dear, and make pills thereof, and hold them awhile in your
mouth.

Item, take Iuiubes, Sebestes, Dragagant, Gum, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Annis seed, and seeds of Hollihockes, of each one drag. one quart of steeled
water: sees these together to the third part, whereof the patient is to drink
four times a day. Item, take sirupe of Poppie seeds, of Iuiubes and Myrtle
seed, temper them together, or take each alone; make a drink thereof with
water wherein Quince or Myrtle seed is boiled.

Another. Take Myrtle seed, broad Plantaine seed, both beaten small, of each
one dragme, temper them with Purslaine water, and drink it treatably. Or use
this following in this manner also, take beaten Lupins one quarter of an ounce,
prepared Bloudstone one dragm, tempered with Purslaine water, and drink it as
is said. Betonie laid in Wine is also many times approved in the spetting of
blood.

There may also salues be used outwardly upon the breast; yet here is to be
noted, that it is very commodious for the spetting of blood, but for the cough
very hurtful, therefore this following is rather to be used: take oil of
Roses, or Myrtles, of sweet Almonds, and juice of Prunes, of each a like much,
and make thereof a salve with molten wax. Item, take beaten Frankincense,
temper it with the white of an Egg, and lay it on the breast. Or take the
juice of Sloes Hyppocystis Dragon blood, blossoms of Pomegranats, Gals,
Mastick, and Roses, of each four scruples, Turbith, fine Bolus, of each one
dragm, oil of Roses, of Myrtles, of Masticke, of each half an ounce, the
white of an Egg well beaten, and Wax as much as is needful for a salve. The
black Tabulates described in the second part, the second Chapter, and 2.. shall
the patient hold under his tongue. And if this be desired to be more forcible,
then is it to be prepared as herafter follows: take Dragagant, Plantaine
seeds a little parched, and Gum, of each half an ounce, Bloudstone, the
yellow seeds of Roses, fine Bolus, sealed earth, Amber, and red Coral, of
each one dragme, muscilage of Fleawoort seed tempered with Purslaine water, as
much as is needful for to form therewith these trocisces, use them as is said.

It is also needful that the body be purged. For which this sirupe following
may be vse^: Take Myrtle seed and the seed of Butchers broom, Roses,
blossoms of Pomegranates, the yellow seeds of Roses, Acorne cups, Gals, juice
of Sloes, and Hippocistis, of each half an ounce, white Saunders, Quinces and
burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragagant, Gum, fine Bolus, and
Dragons blood, of each one drag. and a half, sealed earth and Masticke, of
each three drag. Frankincense, white Poppie seed, of each two drag and a
half, prepared Bloudstone half a drag. the juice of Plantaine, and juice of
Quinces, of each six ounces. You must strain and scum the juice, then power
thereto as much rain water as will serve to sees it together, and make
thereof a sirupe with Sugar, whereof give one ounce and a half tempered with
three ounces of Purslaine water during certain days early in the morning.

This sirupe does not loose, but stops much rather, and stancheth blood. For
the purging use these pills, de Agarico two scrup. Cochiae one scrup. make
thereof seven pills. Or make the sirupe of Roses laxatiue with Rubarbe in an
astringent decoction, and Purslaine water, wherein the shells of yellow
Mirobalanes be decocted, and this is a soluble and good purgation, it cleanses
well the blood. But if the cough be with it, then against night give him a pill
of Cynoglosso, and let him hold one in his mouth by day.

For a broken Vein in the Lights or breast.. 18.
THe signs of a broken Vein in the Lights are (as is already said) if the
blood be suddenly spet out or powered out by heaps, and that clear, clean
blood, and not clodded, then is present remedy to be looked for before it
turn to an impostume, or that the blood be congealed and turned into matter.
For if so be that there be neglect thereof, then is there danger of never more
to be helped. And if so be that such forcible blood will not be stayed, then
are you to open out of hand the Liver vein in the arm of the same side, where
you think that the vein of the Lights is broken, and then to let no more but
two or three ounces of blood. And if you perceive that there is any Cholera run
out with it, then is the bleeding of the nose not bad for the same. But if this
will not help, then is the head vein to be opened between the thombe and the
first finger, and let out about two ounces of blood. There is good for this to
purge choler with Cassia, sour Dates, Manna, and such like.

To draw the blood downward, the patient is to be rubbed softly with warm
clothes in the outward members, also to set great boxing cups vnpickt on the
top of the buttocks: and if the piles could be made bleed, that will do it
much good.

Salues.
TAke beaten Gals, Acornes, Butchers broom seeds, and the juice of Sloes, of
each half an ounce, Myrtle seed, seeds of Plantaine and of Purslaine, of
each three drag. Dragagant, Gum, Isinglas, Glue, of each five dragmes, Barley
meal one ounce and a half, Starch, Mill dust, of each one ounce, Saffron one
drag. sees it in red wine, which is somewhat mild, and make pappe thereof, and
lay it upon the breast, and renew it once every four and twenty hours. And in
case that the pap cleave hard on the breast, then must you lay a fresh thereon.

Item, take Sorrel water, water of Balm, Cicorie and Rose water, of each six
ounces, Trociscos de Spodio, de Rosis, of each two scrup. red and white Behen,
Doronicum, Hearts bones, and Pearls, of each one scrup. Malmsey half an ounce,
temper it together and sees it a little, then dip a four square woollen cloth
in it, and lay it lukewarm over the left breast: in like manner one more on
the same side of the back bone, and refresh it every day once.

For stanching of blood there are many sundry remedies described in the first
part, the eight Chapter, in the 7.. where we have spoken of the bleeding of the
nose, yet is there here cammanded to be used (if need require) these things
following.

Take Henbane seed and white Poppie seeds, of each five drag. sealed earth
and red Coral, of each two drag. and a half, prepared Bloudstone one drag.
and conserve of Roses four ounces, temper them all together and make a
confection thereof. Use a little thereof, and that with great heed. For this
also may be taken the oil of Rosin distilled with Ireos and prepared Sulphur
two ounces, Ireos one drag. beat it together very small, and use thereof every
day three or four grains. Yet it is to be understood, that this is not to be
done, but after all the foresaid things, as letting of blood, and such like.

Afterward it is very good once in eight days to take one quarter of an ounce
of Turpentine, with a little Ireos rolled with powder of Licorice.

This following is to be laid under the tongue: Take cold Dragagant tabulats
two ounces, prepared Bloudstone, Amber, Glue, red Coral, and Pearls of each
one dragme, temper them all together with Looch de Papauere, as much as all the
rest, and hold at all times thereof in the mouth the bigness of a Bean.

Order for meat and drink.
IT is very needful in this disease to observe a certain order in eating and
drinking: therefore he is to feed with that which cools measurably, which
thickneth the matter, and draws it together. From ye first day to the fourth,
the sick body is to be kept soberly: afterward is his meat to be dressed and sod
with one of these things following, as Dragagant, Gum, or a little clean Glue,
or a pappe of Starch, of Mill dust, or at the leastwise other meat strewed
therewith. Pap of Goats milk that is prepared with pibble stones or steel is
good for him. Sodden Calves feet or Lambs feet, Pullets broth, or Capon
broth dressed with Isinglas are very commodious for him. There may also sometimes
a piece of a Tench or an Eele, with other intrailes of fish be sodden in other
meats: for it is certain that those things for this sickness are very
commodious. In like manner are the Lentils sodden with Wheat, and dressed for
this sickness very meet: for this is also fit Iuiubes, Dates, Barley, thick
milk, fresh Cheese, all kind of flesh wherein is little blood, as Wood
Pigeons, turtle Doves, and Partridges prepared with binding things, as with
Quinces, Barberies, Raspes, and such like.

If this spetting of blood be caused through heat, then dress his meat most
with Lettice, Purslaine, Gourds, Melons, Daisies, Shepherds purse, and such
like.

For his drink this following is very good: Take twelve ounces of very good
Honey, four pints of water that is twice steeled with steel, being well sodden
together, temper amongst it Dragagant and Gum, of each one drag. and a half,
Saffron one scrup. let it sees again until the third part be sodden away. But
if one will not drink thereof alone, then is good red wine to be tempred
amongst it. But let him drink what he will, if Isinglas be sodden in all his
drinks or the powder thereof be mingled amongst his drink, it is the better.
He may also otherwhiles take a draught of Rose water, or Purslaine water. Rain
water is commended above all other sorts of drinks, if a vein be broken in the
breast, and chiefly if there be a little fine Bolus or burnt Iuorie tempered
amongst it.

This following is praised for a precious and an approved powder: Take the
seeds of Plantaine, Butchers broom seeds, and the juice of Sloes, of each one
drag. prepared Pearls, red Coral, Amber, Blondstone, and Dragon blood, of
each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus three quarters of an ounce, Dragagant,
Gum, and Frankincense, of each three drag. temper and beat it together.

You are to take one scruple of this powder with Purslaine water four times a
day, one hour before breakfast, one hour before supper, and likewise two
hours after.

For congealed blood.. 19.
WHen it is thought that (after the vein is stopped in the breast) there is yet
still a little clotted blood behind, then are these things to be used thereto.
For which is fine Treacle highly commended, if thereof be taken one dragme, or
a dragme and a half, with three ounces of water, wherein Licorice and Venus
hair have been sodden. Or take old Treacle one drag. one ounce of Vinegar, two
ounces of Rosewater, temper it together and give it him. For this is also good
the water of Larks spurs, billet coals one quarter of an ounce beaten small, and
given to drink in Vinegar, is a general medicine for all clotted or bruised
blood. So is likewise the renning of all young beasts especially good for all
clotted or bruised blood. If then any body has caught a great fall, or is hard
stricken or thrust, and afraid of any clotted blood, then give him every
morning and evening (each time) two or three ounces of the juice of Cheruill.
Item, take Cheruill water and Louage water, of each one ounce and a half, or
two ounces, and drink it at a draught. Or take of Rubarbe half an ounce, Lacca
one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus, and sealed earth, of each one dragme,
Rubarb half a dragme, if you put thereto some burnt Sponges, it will be so much
the better, make a powder thereof, and use it as is aforesaid. Another: Take
fine Bolus half an ounce, sealed earth one dragme, Dragon blood and
Spermaceti, of each half a dragme, make a powder thereof, and give him a dragme
of it with white wine. This plaster following may also be made: Take Goats
milk and honey, let them be well warmed together, then temper amongst it as
much fine Bolus, until it be as thick as a plaster, and so lay it upon the
breast: it wastes the clotted blood.

If any be afraid that through falling or thrusting he have broken any thing in
his body, or fear to have any clotted blood within him, then is he to drink
one dragme of this following with warm wine or beer. Take four ounces of the
roots of red Bluglosse, cut them in pieces, and let them sees in a pot of red
wine until they be soft, then take them out and beat it to pap, put thereto
two ounces of Spermaceti, and one pound of fresh Butter, let them melt together
with a small fire, and therewith anoint the place, where the pain is greatest,
and chiefly about the breast.

Lastly, in the middle of the spetting of blood, take one ounce of the juice of
Plantaine, te^per therein two or three grains of Opium, and give it to the
patient. Or make these conserues following: Take white Pepper and Henbane
seed, of each five dragmes, sealed earth and Opium, of each one quarter of an
ounce, peeled Hemp seed and Saffron, of each four scruples, Beuercod, Spica,
Euphorbium, Pieretrum, Pearls, Amber, Zeduary and Doronicum, of each one
scruple, Campher six grains, sodden honey as much as is needful, give of this
half or a whole dragme with one ounce and a half of Plantaine water, tempered
with half an ounce of wine.

Comfortable things in and after the spetting of blood.. 20.
FOr to keep nature by her might and power, these confections following are to
be used. Take the flesh of Capons that are sodden with Dragagant in steeled
water six ounces, white and red Coral, Dragagant, Gum (both a little tosted)
of each one dragme and a half, fine Bolus, Amber, sealed earth, Mumia, and
Bloudstone, of each one dragme, Purslaine seed and Plantaine seed, of each
three dragmes, Almonds steeped in the juice of Quinces, three dragmes, Iuiubes,
Sebestes (so dressed also) of each one ounce, Specierum Electuarij Regum, one
quarter of an ounce, Species of the cold Dragagant Tabulats four ounces, white
Sugar and Sugar candy, of each one pound and a half, or so much as you please,
sees the Sugar with Pullet broth, and mix all the rest amongst it, and make
of them morsels.

Another.
TAke Species de Gemmis, which are set forth in the description of the heart,
one dragme, and give it with sirupes of Apples, this strengthens the heart and
the Lights, it is very good for those that after spetting much blood, be so
faint hearted, that they seem to have no more pulse.

For conclusion: for this spetting of blood we will here present some
particular things to be used for the same, where there is neither Physician,
nor Apothecary near hand: bitter Almonds with Starch are passing good for
this, and also for all cold coughes: Agaricus one quarter of an ounce, steeped
in six ounces of Purslaine water, and wring it well out, and so in one day at
two times taken. Flowers of Pomegranates, Hippocistis, and prepared Coral, of
each one dragme, with the white of an egg and Gum tempered together to
Trocisces, and so holden under the tongue.

The juice of Quinces, Centorie, burnt and washed Hearts horn, prepared Amber,
Lycium, sealed earth, fine Bolus, Myrtle seed, Myrrh, or a little of all of
them, three or four grains at one time taken with wine is passing good.
Likewise the juice of Mints, or of Purslaine is highly commended for this
disease. For this is also good the white Henbane seed, but not above three
grains at once to be taken. The yellow seed of Roses, white Brier, and many
other things more that are above rehearsed, amongst other compounds (which are
to be used alone) are very good.

Of the infection of the Lights which is called Peripneumonia.. 21.
THis name is as much to say in Greek as Phlegma, which is phlegm, slime or
corruption of the Lights, which matter infecteth the lights, makes them swell,
and brings an hot Ague with it. This is caused chiefly of Cholera, or of
Phlegma, yt which falls through the veins, or out of the head into the
lights, and may be caused of the matter that provoke the Pleurisy, or
Squinancie, and falls into the lights. And although the Peripneumonia, as an
impostume of the lights, happens to break out, whereby the lights are wounded;
yet is it notwithstanding therein severed from the Phthisi, that this infection
of the lights is rather placed between the small skin which covers the
lights, than in the substance of them where it can procure an exulceration;
where contrariwise the Phthisis which is the right consumption, harmeth,
impostumeth, and rotteth the very substance of the lights.

The signs of this Peripneumonia, or malady of the lights are these, namely,
a troublesome breath, as if one would choke, whereby the sick body is
compelled to lift up himself, his breath is always hot, so that he does
always call for cold air. This phlegm is sometimes somewhat brown, and
otherwhiles pure red, and sometimes green and black and scummy. They do feel
a wringing and pain in the breast, that reaches from the ribs to the
backbone. There is also a strong Ague commonly therewith, the tongue is red,
and will be in time slimy and black, so that when one touches it with the
finger, it cleaves thereto. They cannot lie neither on the back nor side, but
must sit always upright: the cheeks are always so red, as if they were
painted. If then these signs all or in part do appear, then is it most
certain that there is an impostume in the lights, the which otherwhiles
causes such a strangling, and Apnaea, that the patient can get no more breath,
and that it cannot be thought otherwise, but that the patie^t must stifle, and
all this without any great stitch or feeling of great heat, which
nevertheless is very great over the whole body.

The remedies for this sickness are, that the head vein be opened, and
afterward the means be used which here before in the fifth Chapter in the 5..
are prescribed.

The remedies for this sickness are, that the head vein be opened, and
afterward the means be used, that here before in the 5.. is ordained for the
Pleurisy, be it of what cause soever that they proceed: but good heed must
be taken, for that this impostume sticks deepelier in the body than the
Pleurisy: so that whatsoever one lays outwardly upon the body, must be
stronger and always tempered with such things, that may convey the medicine to
the lights, and make the phlegm to be loosed the sooner: that which is to be
laid on the outside, must not be laid on the side, but above over the breast;
and if that the patient be not let blood, then is he to be let blood in the
liver vein in the arm.

Of the anguish of the Lights which is called Empyema.. 22.
THis disease of the lights is altogether like the foresaid Peripneumonia, and
proceeds commonly of these causes following, to wit, when one is thrust hard
upon the breast, or has fallen, whereby afterward there flow bad humors to
it, that at length alter into matter. Also, this sickness can be caused of a
continual use of some certain vaporish meats and drinks, or through a
Rheum that falls out of the head upon the lights, and cannot be coughed up
by any means, so that there it does putrify, and must needs turn to matter:
Or that inwardly within the breast some impostume happen to break, whereby the
matter runs into the hollownesse of the breast, like as of the Squinancie,
of the Pleurisy, and Peripneumonia commonly chances.

In fine Empyoma, which is an anguish or impostume wherein much matter
gathers together, the which is burdened with all the foresaid matter with it.

When as then any such anguish comes into the Lights, then is it very hard or
impossible to be helped, for that there be no other means for to cleanse the
same the^ through the Cough, the which still exulcerateth more, and consumes
the lights.

The signs of the impostume in the Lights, are oppression of the breast, a
painful breath, to cough up corruption, with a dry and salt Cough, to speak
snappishly, a disordred pulse, with a small Ague, which is rather perceived by
night than by day, whereby there is but little sleep.

And to know in what place of the Breast that this impostume is, these are
therefore the signs, namely, if it be in the right side, and the patient do
lie upon the left side, then has he much more pain and grief.

Item, make a cloth wet in water wherein fine Bolus is dissolved, bind the same
round about the breast, and upon the place; where the same cloth is first of
all dry, there is the grief: if it dry on both sides, then are both the sides
therewith infected.

This sickness, be it as perilous and incurable as it will, notwithstanding
are there no other remedies to help it, than they that are ordained for the
pain in the Breast, for the Pleurisy, and chiefly for the cough: So that
there must be used for the same now and then sirupes, and otherwhiles
Plasters, Confections, Pills, Tabulats, Gargarismes, and such like, now one,
and then another.

For as much then as we have notified in all the foresaid places, and in the
ensuing Phthisi or Consumption, many remedies, therefore it is needless to
reckon them here again, but only to remember, if the amendment come slowly,
that then it should not be discontinued and left off, for that this disease
accustometh commonly to tarry forty days and longer: and if so be that the
sickness be not cured in forty days, then comes thereof the consumption.
And whereas it often happens, that neither inward nor outward remedies do
help for this sickness, then does the last refuge and necessity constrain,
that other remedies be sought for: to wit, that lastly the Breast must be
opened, be it with a hot iron, corsie, or incision, that thereby the filth and
matter be let run out, whereby the breast is to be cleansed, the patient cured,
and old age achieved, therefore we will not pretermit to make known, what the
ancient Physicians have taught thereof.

First all such Plasters are to be laid therein, that do discuss matter and
maturate it: as these following: take Fenegreeke, and Linseede meal, of each
three ounces, eight or ten fat Figs, six or seven Dates, two ounces of Pease
meal, Cammomill one ounce and a half, powne them all together and sees them
in wine, and temper therewith two ounces of Turpentine, and Linseede meal one
ounce and a half, oil of Cammomill one ounce, then make a plaster thereof,
and lay it on the breast where the pain is.

And if you suppose that this swelling proceed out of a cold cause, then put
thereto two ounces of Pigeon dung, Saltpeter one ounce, and oil of Lillies as
much as is needful: Treacle or Mithridate (if there be no Ague) taken inwardly
or laid thereon outwardly are very good. And that this impostume might the
sooner break out, the patient must provoke himself as much as is possible, to
lie on his side where it is, not to forbear coughing, but to provoke himself
much rather to cough up the same, as much as he can, thereby to break the same
the sooner.

But if the anguish will not of it self incline to any breaking, then must the
place where the same is, be opened on the outside, with an hot iron, Corsie or
incision. When as the matter is all run out, and the impostume mundified, then
it is like other impostumes to be cured. And if so be that through riddance of
much filth, be it through coughing it up, or any other issue, that nature does
begin to be weak, and requires strengthening; then is the patient to be well
provided for, with good light bread, and sweet white wine, and broths of Hens,
and use all fowls that haunt the high countries. Goats milk is very good for
him to use: also rere eggs, sodden Barley, Colewoorts broth, dressed with
Hyssope, Parsley, and with oil of sweet Almonds. Lastly, all his meats are
to be tempered with Hyslope and Saffron, by reason that they have both a
special congruitie or affinity with the Lights and the Breast.

Also there may be used a confection of the flesh of Capons, described of late
in the 19.. for a strengthening.

With these foresaid things we will ad some other things, that are not only
commodious for the impostume of the Lights, but also for the Asthma, and all
other diseases of the Lights: but chiefly some Potions, as wine of Marierom and
Asarabacca, like as both of them in the end of this book are described. Item,
take Fenegreeke, Linseede, Hollyhock roots, Mallows, and wild Saffron, of
each one handful, dried Hyssope, and Venus hair, of each one handful, eight
or ten fat Figs, Currants two ounces, Sugar pennets, Licorice, of each one
ounce, Fennel seed one dragme, Turbith half an ounce, Ginger one scruple,
Sal gemmae half a dragme; sees all together in three quartes of water, unto
two quartes, and every day give the patient thereof six ounces.

He may also use this Cock water following, the which is thus to be prepared:
when as the greatest extremity is past, and when the patient begins to
recover, then give him a good Cruce full of this broth following, for certain
days continually. Take a Cock of three or four years old, course him so long
until he lie still; afterward kill him, and stuff him with Currants, Figs,
Licorice, wild Saffron, Venus hair, white Mints, Penniroyall, Fenegreeke; if
you cannot get all of them, take the most part of them, of each a like much:
let them sees in a great kettle that you need to power no more water upon it,
drink of this as is said. But the third day, take six ounces of this Potion,
and sees therein two cut Figs, unto three ounces: then put thereto a dragme of
Treacle or Mithridate, Philonium Romanum half a scruple, washed Turpentine one
dragme and a half, and then take it all at one time.

This order must he observe certain days together, albeit that it should last
one whole year, which would be the better. Likewise there is good for this
sickness, Turpentine taken with Honey, and prepared Fox Lights, for it opens
the Breast, cleanses the same, and heals the Lights.

Another Cock water. Dress the Cock as he ought to be, and stuff him with
Hyssope, Licorice, and Venus hair, of each half a handful, Currants half an
ounce: let them sees well together, and lastly put a dragme of Thymus unto it,
use this broth, as is aforesaid. Item, melt a drop of Ammoniacum in a
spoonefull of the water of life, and drink it fasting.

Of the consumption Phthisis, a disease of the Lights.. 23.
THis Phthisis, (the which by reason of her nature, is called the Consumption,
and of the Latinists Tabes) is an ulcer of the Lights, of the Breast, of the
throat, or of the mouth of the stomach, wherewith is always a Cough or a
small ague, whereby the whole body consumes away, and waxes impotent. Or
Phthisis is an exsiccation and weakening of the body, whereby the whole body
will be consumed, even as the Greek name shows.

Item, Phthisis is a sickness of the Lights, that dries away and consumes
the flesh, marrow, and all other powers of the body. In fine, Phthisis is all
that harmeth the Lights, or deuoureth them. This disease is also of such nature
and quality, that it seldom infecteth the very young, the very old and aged
persons, but most of all, as Hippocrates testifies, those that are between
eighteen and 35. years of age: and this is the cause that the eager and
sharp matter in this age, be it through natural or accidental causes, does
as then reign most of all in these kind of bodies.

First, this Consumption can proceed of many causes, as of a sore Cough,
whereby any vein does break in the Lights, or of any eager brackish rheum
that falls upon the Lights, and there through his eagerness does arrode some
vein of the Lights, as a drop of water through continual falling pierces a
hole into a hard stone.

Secondly, this can also be caused through an impostume of the throat; the
which breaking, falls into the breast, and there annoyeth the same.

Thirdly, of any impostume in the breast which after the Pleurisy,
infla^mation of the Lights, or spetting of blood, is not well cleansed and taken
away. Like as of Empyema (which is the infection of the Lights) has been said.

Fourthly, such can also be caused through some obstruction of any accustomed
course of women's Flowers, or course of the Hemorrhoides, which being closed up,
by their vapors do endamage the Lights.

Fifthly, it comes through extreme outward heat, or cold raw winds, and
especially in the falling of the leaf. Also strains, wounds, pestilent air,
through long use of many hot spices, Oinions, Garlic, and other things more,
which do engender much and subtle blood, whereby a vein quickly comes to
break, whereby afterward the blood putrifieth there, and turns to an
impostume.

These sicknesses can also be well provoked through long conuersing in
quicksiluer, the vapor whereof harmeth and putrifieth the Lights.

These also are the commonest signs of this sickness, to wit, when the sick
man's nose waxes small and sharp, when the temples of the head fall down,
their arm pits do strecth out like wings, whereto comes afterward a small
hot Ague, Cough after meat, oppression of the breast, grievous breathing,
matterie spettle, the which is always a little died with blood, which if it be
cast over hot coals, yields a stench; or if one cast it in a kettle of
water, does sink to the bottom. The cheeks of the patient are always ruddie,
the nails on the hands and feet will be crooked, he is sometimes hot, and
otherwiles cold. In fine, they that are oppressed with this wretched sickness,
are always very raging and impatient, so that no body can do enough for them,
etc. When as then besides all these signs, the blood begins to consume, to
dry away, and the hair to fall off, then is he very far spent.

Now for to come to the means whereby all such sicknesses are to be helped,
then is there first an old saying, that the old and ripe consumption is not to
be cured: The cause is, that all such ulcers of the breast do corrode too
deep. Secondly, because the Lights must be in continual motion, where
notwithstanding all cures have need of quietness. Thirdly, through continual
motion does race and eat in the deeper. Fourthly, for that the disease lies
so deep in the body, that Physic can hardly or slowly come to it. Fifthly, if
hot remedies be to be used for it, then increases the Ague: if cold remedies,
then have they but small force to pierce to the place infected: Or if there be
drying medicines used thereto, then do the same oppress and putrify there.

These sicknesses may be settled a long time in children and old folks, in
corpulent and fat folks, and specially in women: but if the sickness do draw
to an end, and that besides all the said signs the stomach fails, and the
laske approaches with it, then is there small hope more at hand,
notwithstanding, although this sickness (as it is said) is very dangerous, and
long continuing, yet are the due remedies that serve for the same not to be
despised nor abiected. And before al, as much as concerns this disease, the
eyes are to be fixed on seven kind of things. First, to see that the Rheum be
stayed, for the which you may here before find diverse remedies in the
Squinancie in the twelfth Chapter and 2.. Also in the fifth Chapter 2..
Secondly, heed must be taken to the vlceration of the lights, for which in
this present description of the lights very many remedies are prescribed, more
shall be herafter specified.

Thirdly, to drive away the Ague, and for that to this sickness many kinds of
Agues are incident, as may appear in the sixth part of this book. Fourthly,
care must be taken to diminish this Cough, nevertheless to beware not to
hinder altogether the coughing up of the phlegm, for the which look here
before the 4. and 5.. and also afterward. Fifthly, the patient must observe a
good rule of living, whereof hereafter follows a good instruction.

Sixthly, means must be made to take away the spetting of blood, whereof is at
large discoursed in the 17.. Seventhly and lastly, care is to be had to
lengthen the sick bodies short breath; for this, look into the 12.. of
Asthma: what is further needful for this sickness shall follow hereafter.

First there are here expressed four principal things, as well fitting the
patient for food, as for remedy, to wit, Honey, conserve of Roses, Crabs that
are taken in fresh waters, Figs, and certain other fruits.

As much as concerns the Honey of Roses, it is always more forcible than the
common Honey, because that it expels phlegm and matter, pierces and
cleanses, therefore is Honey accounted a safeconductor of all other medicines
which are commodious for this sickness. But if so be that there be with it a
vehement heat, and putrefying Ague; then in the stead of the same Honey is Honey
water to be used: for which cause some say that the Honey is not to be used in
this sickness alone without scumming, for if the same be not scummed, and do
not sees, it is hurtful, and causes the Laske.

The second is the conserve of Roses, through which only some preserve
themselves, and prolong their life: and if through use of this the body
chances to be stopped, then is sirupe of Hyssope to be used, and if the same be
too hot, then are Trociscos de Camphora and cold Tabulats of Dragagant to be
used.

Thirdly are the Crabs, which must thus be prepared: Take fresh water Creuets
as many as you will, sees them so long in well water until they may be plucked
in pieces, then cut off the feet and skins, take off all the shells, and wash
them well in Ley that is made of Vine-ashes, afterward sees them very mellow
in Barley water: the patient must eat the Crabbes, and drink the water.

Fourthly, there are good for this disease in stead of Physic, Raisins, Figs,
Pingles, Pistacia, Currants, Sebestes, and Iuiubes.

But for this we will discover more other remedies, amongst which is chiefly
commended Asses milk, and if the same cannot be gotten, Goats milk is to be
taken in the stead thereof: also bread sopped therein is to be eaten, and if
that may be, he is to use no other drink sugared: but if that cannot be, then
is he to use therewith some sugared Beer, yet is it no counsel to use the
Milk, if therewith be any putred Ague. Here is also to be noted, that woman's
milk surpasses all other milk: but be it what milk that it may be, yet must
the same be drunken new milked, for all milk very quickly takes an alteration
and corruption. But if all manner of milk be loathsome to the party, then
prepare him this potion: Take Ireos one quarter of an ounce, of Hyssop and
green Venus hair (if it may be gotten) of each one handful, peeled Barley
three ounces, Melon seed, Cucumber seed, Gourd seed, Pompeon seed, seeds
of Verbascum, Fenegreeke, Iuiubes, and Sebestes, of each half an ounce,
Licorice and Raisins, of each one ounce, white Sugar nine ounces, Honey three
ounces, sees it all together except the Sugar and the Honey in a sufficient
quantity of rain water, according as you will have it strong, let it sees to
the second part: when it is strained, then put the Sugar and Honey unto it, let
it sees awhile and clarify it.

And if so be that after the use of milk, there follow a small Ague, then
shall he in stead of Milk, use Barley water, or a thin Barley pap, for that
cleanses the breast, and cools the same, and expels phlegm, but as soon
as the Ague goes away, then may you return to the use of the Milk.

The rule of living.
FIrst, they that have the consumption are to choose all such dwelling places,
where it is always cold and moist, and chiefly where he is troubled with the
Ague, situated to the North east and on the water. But if he cannot get the
same, then must his chamber be often sprinkled with fair water; and if he be
of ability, then is the chamber to be sprinkled in the place of common water,
with stilled water of Violets, water Lillies, Cucumbers, Gourds, Pompions
mingled; or each by themselves: or strew the chamber with Violet leaves, water
Lillies, Vine leaves, and with other cold herbs. The chamber may also be fumed
with these fumigations following, which are made of water Lilly flowers,
Lettice seeds, and Purslaine seeds beaten together. He must not cover his head
too warm.

Secondly, almost all exercise and travel is hurtful, principally when as yet
his head is full of humors; therefore shall he refrain all labor, and be
still and take his rest.

Thirdly, he must beware that he do not over eat himself, and it is more
commodious to eat oftentimes, and a little at once, than for to eat once or
twice a day very much: and so it is also with his drink. He must also beware
and refrain to eat with hunger, and that which he eats must he chew very
well, whereon many do think but little, that do either hate or smally esteem
their own lives. In like sort must he eat to expel all the superfluity of
the stomach or bowels. If there be any such thing in the stomach, then must
it be taken away by stools, for vomiting is very hurtful for this disease,
but Manna or Cassia are to be used herein. But if the going to the stool be
hardened in the Bowels, then must this Clister be ministered: Take Mallows,
Beetes, Violet leaves, and small Woodbind, of each a handful: sees them
together in sufficient water, take thereof twelve or sixteen ounces, oil of
Violets, and of white Sesamum, of each one ounce and a half, fresh Butter
three quarters of an ounce, Sal gemmae four scruples* or one quarter of an
ounce of common Salt, minister it only in the morning.

Fourthly, his sleep must be seven or eight hours long, and not at all but at
the least one hour after supper: he must shun sleep a day times, and is to
sleep half sitting, and not to lie upon his back nor on his face.

Fifthly, he must beware of anger, of calling aloud, and of all that will impact
the phlegm in the breast, as of sorrow, fear, fright, and above all things of
Venerie, for there is nothing that more abateth the nourishment of the body
then the same, but he must by all means possible endeavor himself to be merry
and of good cheer.

As much as concerns the sixth, to wit, meat and drink, for that you have
this common rule, as, that his bread be of good white Wheat, and baked well,
rising: also if the same be dressed with the water of Folefoote, it were very
commodious. Of fleshes are good for him, fat Pullets, Hens, Capons, and all
field fowls, as Phesants, Partridges, etc. Also young Kids, Calves, Hares,
roasted Pigs, Fox lights, and the sewet of all these beasts. All water Fowls,
wild Pigeons, and Geese are forbidden him. But this meat is specially
commended, take Almond milk when he has a strong Ague, and where there is no
Ague take Goats milk, and seethe crumbs of white bread to a thin pap, and let
him eat thereof, and such like pappes made with Wheat meal, Barley meal, or
Millet meal, sweetened with Sugar or Sugar pennets: amongst which one may
temper some white Poppy seeds.

All fish are permitted for this sickness, and chiefly all river fish: Crabs
have also a special property, virtue, and secret operation against this
malady. And if one cannot get Crabs, then take in the stead of them garden
Snailes, and let them with their houses boil with Hyssop and Fennel, then
take them out, and bestrew them with Sugar, or fry them with Butter, as it
likes the patient best, for they cause the phlegm to arise, and moisten the
body: all herbs that moisten and cool are good for this disease; yea it
behooves that all the patients meat be dressed with the same, as namely with
Beetes, Lettice, Spinach, Burrage, Purslaine, Melons, and Shepherds purse,
which have a special operation for this sickness in cooling and moistening. But
Colewoorts and Turnips must he forbear: Rice sod in water, wherein 24. hours
before wheaten Bran has been steeped, may he well feed upon, for through the
Branne does the water get a cooling and moistning operation. So is there also
good for this sickness, red and white Pease, notwithstanding that they be
warm and dry in the first degree, which warmth and drouth is taken away by
dressing. For amongst all kind of pottage, there is nothing more requisite than
this for the Lights. But the ancient Physicians do much commend stued Barley,
Pusanam, of all other pottages, for it is light of digestion, slipperie, and
loses the phlegm very well; it alters also the bad, dry, and aguish
complexion. And albeit that Barley is hot and dry in the first degree, yet
all such drouth is taken away through the moisture wherewith it is boiled,
whether it be sodden and dressed in water, Almond milk, or some fresh broth; for
it is familiar to the stomach, cleanses the same, quenches thirst,
putrifieth not in the stomach: for these virtues is Barley commended of all
ancient and later Physicians that are expert in physic. So do they also
commend Otemeale, which has almost the same virtue, and is like to the Barley,
but is not so common in use, yet are the right Oatmeale paps very good, so are
paps also of Bean meal, of Lentils, of rough bearded Wheat, of Starch dressed
with Almond milk, or the broth of Hens, as occasion shall serve.

Above the foresaid fruits the Hasell nuts are tolerated and allowed of, yet
but few, least they spoil the stomach: unsalted Cheese is very good for him,
but old Cheese is highly forbidden, and albeit (even as is said) milk is for
meat tolerated, yet is not Butter, nor Hogs grease, neither Sallad oil
commendable for this disease: neither yet any meats which are dressed with much
fat. Oil of sweet Almonds, and oil of Walnuts are accounted for the best,
because that the other stuff the head: all salted fish and flesh are hurtful,
like as be vinegar, veriuice, and such like, and especially if there be salt in
it: but if any of these be used, then delay the sharpness with Sugar; but
sweet Pomgranats and Citrons well Sugared may he use well enough. Honey is not
good in his meat, although the same used after another manner be good and
profitable, even as is here before expressed.

He must beware of all spice, unless they be dressed with some other cooling
herbs, as with Violet leaves, Purslaine, Spinach, Lettice, Endive, and such
like. But Saffron is much commended for this disease, for it strengthens the
heart, the breast, and cleanses the lungs. White Wine is good for his drink, if
it be clear and somewhat sweet: but the sour and hard wine harmeth him: if
so be that the Wine do not fume into the head, then let him drink it by it
self, but if it be heady, then temper it with sodden water, or the water
wherein Licorice, Buglosse, Elecampane, Folefoote leaves, and such like are
decocted, this must be his drink at meals, but if he drink between meals,
then is he to drink sugared Barley water. Here have you now the second time a
description of the six unnatural things, the which the Physicians do call Res
non naturales, like as the same are before set down in the description of
Asthma.

Here do follow many remedies for this disease.
TAke the tails of fresh water Crabs six ounces, prepare and dress them as
is before instructed, the seeds of Endive, of Sorrel, of small Endive, and of
Lettice one dragme and a half, Pingles that have been steeped one night in
Folefoote water two ounces, stamp and chop them all together, and sees them
with four ounces of Sugar and Honey to a Confection. There is also another
Confection made of Crabs, Looch de Cancris.
called Looch de Cancris, as follows: Take the tails of good fat fresh water
Crabs four ounces, Raisins the stones taken out two ounces, 30. Iuiubes,
Licorice two ounces, Venus hair, Tassell leaves, Hounds tongue, and Dill, of
each one quarter of an ounce, sees this all together in sufficient water to
the half part, then wring it out, and put thereto sirupe of Poppy heads, and
white Sugar, of each four ounces, and when it is well clarified, and decocted
to the thickness of Honey, then put unto it sirupe of Licorice, Almonds chopped
small, and Gourd seed, of each half an ounce, seeds of Mallows and Quinces,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Purslaine and white Poppie seed, Dragagant,
Gum and Starch, of each one drag. powne all these small together, Species
Diamoschu, and Diambra, Another Looch.
of each one dragm, temper them all well together. Item, this Looch ensuing may
also be prepared for this, the which is very good for the consumption, the
drouth and heat of the throat: Take Licorice sliced, Raisins without stones,
of each one ounce, Iuiubes and Sebestes ten or twelve, sees them all together
in two quarts of water, that there remain not above the eighth part, then
strain it through a cloth, and put thereto five ounces of sodden wine, Sugar
pennets two ounces, and so let it sees thick together, whereof the patient is
to take twice or thrice a day, and likewise in the night treatably, a small
spoonefull at once, for this are also good Looch de Pino, De Farfaria, and
Looch de Papauere.

To these foresaid confections is this following highly commended: Take the
juice of Pimpernell, of Bistorta, or powders of the same, of each half an
ounce, conserve of Roses one ounce and a half, temper them well together, and
let them sees over a small fire; or if it be hot weather, set it in the Sun
until it be thick. About the Bistorta is a great debate amongst the learned,
B^storta.
every one may therefore look unto it that will.

Item, the confection of Fox lungs described before in the twelfth. is
special good for all such as have the consumption, taking daily the quantity
of a Nutmeg. The operations that Treacle and Mithridate have in this disease,
are declared in many other places of the book. The warm and cold Dragagant
tabulats are also special good for the consumption, and that according to the
importance of the same.

Item, take eight ounces of Hens flesh which is sodden in Barley water, and as
much Almonds, beat them all small together, and temper therewith one ounce and
a half of Starch, and the whites of five eggs well beaten, with four ounces of
beaten Sugar, temper them al together with Rose water, and let them sees well
without the Almonds and the Hens flesh: when it begins to be thick, then
stir the Almonds and the Hens flesh amongst it, and make morsels or small
cakes thereof, and let them dry in an oven. The confected Almonds are special
good for all such as consume away, for they give good nourishment; in like sort
the confected Pingles, if they be steeped first 24. hours in Rose water.

This following is a costly powder: Take white Poppy seed one ounce and a
quarter, Starch and Dragagant of each three dragmes, peeled Melon seed,
Pompeon seed, Cucumber seed, and peeled Gourd seeds, of each seven dragmes,
seeds of Purslaine and Mallows, of each five dragmes, burnt Iuorie, and the
juice of Licorice, of each three dragmes, Sugar pennets, as much as of all the
rest, make a powder thereof, and give every morning thereof one quarter of an
ounce, with the sirupe of Poppie heads, or sirupe of Iuiubes; this is good
against all vlcerations of the Lights, and against all Coughes, for that it is
of wonderful operation, yea also in them that do cough up pieces of their
Lights. If you will have a powder of it for to strew upon your meat, then put
as much more Sugar unto it.

Item, take Lungwoort, and prepared Foxelights of each half an ounce, and two
ounces of Sugar, and make thereof a powder. And you may make these pills
following for to lay under the tongue, which are very good against the Cough,
and against the Ague: Take peeled Melon seed, Gourd seed, Cucumber seed, and
peeled Pompeon seed, of each five dragms, white Poppie seed, Purslaine seed,
of each seven dragms, Sugar pennets as much as all the rest weigh, muscilage of
Quinces as much as needs for to make pills therewith.

Item, conserues of Betonie, and conserues of Gillofloures (being both of one
operation) are passing good against the consumption: The conserve of water
Lillies cools marvelous well, and the wine thereof. In like manner Rosemarie
wine, and of Clarie, are also good for this, even as in the last part of this
book their operations are discovered.

Here follows also a precious Capon water which much strengthens the heart
and restores all weakness: Take an old Capon, chop him small, and put unto
him Buglosse water, the water of Burrage and Dandelion, of Endive, and Carduus
Benedictus, of each eight or ten ounces, gross beaten Cinamome, and Pionie
seed, of each half an ounce, Saffron and Nutmegs, of each one scrup. Roses,
Mints, Sage, and flowers of Burrage cut small, of each one handful, Buglosse
the root and herb one ounce, Hearts tongue, Violets and Rosemary flowers, of
each half a handful, Misselden of the oak half an ounce, let all this digest
in a Stiller, and afterward distill it like other water, this is special good
for children.

These cold remedies following are very meet for a consuming body, which is
hot and dry, to wit, conserues of Roses, sirupe of Poppy heads, Roses and
Violets, Purslaine, cold Dragagant tabulats, and the confection of Diarrhodon
which is very temperate. Of warming remedies if the patient be not too hot,
like as in Asthma, these following are good, Diacuminum, Diaireos Solomonis,
Dia Hyssopo, Dia Calamintha, Diaprassium. In like manner, the sirupe of al
these aforesaid, also the sirupe of Licorice, Iuiubes, and Venus hair, but
chiefly the last of them, which is not too hot. This patient ought always as
well before as after meat to sit in a warm bath of water, and to sit therein so
long until that the veins begin to swell and grow big.

Plasters and Unguents have also good operation in this disease, to wit, such
as hereafter ensue: Take prepared Crabs tails (as is taught before) twelve
ounces, seeds of Endive and of small Endive, of Sorrel, of Lettice, of each
one dragme and a half, Mace one quarter of an ounce, peeled Melon seed, Gourd
seed, Cucumber seed, and peeled Pompeon seed, of each three dragmes. Pingles
two ounces, beaten Sugar four ounces, and Honey of Violets as much as needs
for to make a plaster, and so lay it warm upon the breast.

A good Ointment.
TAke the fat of a white Cat, Hearts suet, Barrowes grease, the marrow of Hearts
bones, Dogs grease, and Badgers grease, of each one ounce, Honey two ounces;
melt all these together on a mild fire: afterward put thereto Beuercod and
Euphorbium, of each half an ounce, long Pepper four scruples; beat that
small which is to be beaten small, and make thereof with sufficient Wax and
oil of Cammomill an ointment. Some have not without cause dried Betonie and
field Cipers, stamping of each half an ounce, with three dragmes of Turpentine
put unto it: and as this unguent is somewhat hot, so is this following
temperat. Take one ounce and a half of the oil of Violets, fresh butter three
quarters of an ounce: melt them and power them into a mortar, and put thereto
one ounce and a half of woman's milk that has a daughter sucking on her, stir
it together until it be well tempered, and anoint the breast therewith, it is
good against heat, it swageth and loses phlegm: therefore it is also good in
Asthma and Hectica. Item, take the whole purtenance with heart, lights and liver
as it hangs together of a black Calfe, chop it together very small, and
distill it in a glass helm in seething water, you may take thereof as much as
you will, and temper amongst it as much Nettle water as of the former, and rub
therewith the withered members.

If so be then the marrow in the bones do also wither away (as is admonished at
the first) then take a Fool of a year old, let it be killed, fleyed and all
the bones cut in pieces: take the marrow out: then take washed Turpentine,
Hounds grease, and Hearts suet, of each half an ounce, cut and melt the marrow,
but the skin that sticks to the bottom preserve that alone: for being
powdered it is good for all sores, the molten marrow keep still in the pan,
and temper one with another as long as an egg may be sod, and let it cool:
you may take thereof the bigness of a Walnut, and anoint your self twice a day
therewith, on the hands and side, and elsewhere if it be needful.

It is also to be noted, that there is another sort of Consumption called
Febris Hectica, which proceeds also of this contagion of the Lights, but we
will speak further thereof in the sixth part, where we do treat of all other
sorts of Agues, as also of other witherings of the members, of lamenesse, and
the Pox, in the fourth Chapter of this book.

Of the stinking breath in Phthisis, or the Consumption.. 24.
OF all the former diseases and putrifactions of the Lights, it is easily to be
understood, from whence the breath has his beginning and whence it stinketh,
and that it cannot be amended, if the disease whereby it is corrupted be not
taken away and cured; whereof is spoken more at large in the first part, the
13. Chapter, and. 3. therefore we will speak more briefly of it: for which
Master Tristrams water is very good. Likewise the juice of Wormwood tempered
with Vinegar, and the mouth washed therewith. Confected Calmus, Elecampane and
Citron pills, are also very good with their sirupes. In the first part the
twelfth Chapter, and 1.. is a powder set down which begins thus, Take Seen,
etc. Annis and Fennel seeds confected, and such like, do also take away the
stinking breath: the which also do sweet and bitter Almonds, be they confected
or no.

But heed must be taken for the consumption, that no laske or flux happen
with it: and if such do happen, then is this powder following to be used. Take
Gum of Araby, burnt Iuory, fine Bolus, and Myrtle seed, of each a like much,
make thereof a powder, and minister thereof every day as long as is very
needful, three dragmes at a time, with sirupe of Poppie heads and Myrtles.

For to conclude this Chapter of the Lights, we will add hereunto certain
needful and necessary things: to wit, the medicines which by nature
voluntarily ease the Lights, as Ireos, Hyssope, Licorice, Raisins, Venus hair,
Squils, Saunders, Pingles, Foxelights, Horehound, Honey, Sugar, Dragagant,
Fenegreeke, Barley, Saffron, Ameos, Colewoort broth, the broth of an old stued
Cock, Cherries, Lignum Aloes, Hasell nuts, Opopanacum, Serapinum, Myrrha,
Radishes, Daffodill roots, Lilly roots, Frankincense.

These things following do cleanse the Lights and the Breast; as Agaricus,
Hyssope, Woodbind, Sarcocolla, Cassia, Ireos, Coloquint, the confection of
Diasena, and the pills Cochiae.

These things following do strengthen and warm the breast and the Lights, as
Hyssope, Horehound, Ireos, Elecampane roots, Cammomill, Hollihocke roots,
Currants, Squils, Balsam wood, Myrrha, Serapinum, Lilly roots, Venus hair,
Licorice, Indy Spica: and amongst the compounded things are Diacalaminthum,
Diaprassium, Diahyssopum, Ireos tabulates, the confection of Pingles and Looch
de Pino. For the cooling of the breast these things, Iuiubes, Sebestes
Dragagant, Gum of Araby, Starch, and white Poppy seed, sweet Almonds, Violets,
Sugar candy, Mulberries, Saunders, Sugar, etc. Of the compounded things, the
confection Diapapauere, cold Dragagant, Sallads, Sugar pennets, and other
things more: that with many more are described before.

We must note further, that although the disease of children, which is called
the infection of the heart be a malady of the Lights, and a kind of
Consumption, yet for some causes it is described in this Chapter following.

The sixth Chapter. Of the Heart, the most precious part of man's body.
ALl they that are expert in natural things, or in Philosophy, do write, that
the Heart is the first member that is found in all living bodies; and in like
manner the last that dies of all other parts of a living body: the which is
very well to be believed, for that it is a perfect fountain and offspring of
life, and of all natural heat; and is also it self hoter than any other
member: therefore in all beasts it is set in the midst of their bodies, that
it might warm the blood, spread the same abroad over all the whole body, and
thereby preserve life right in the middle of the breast, (which is contained in
this second Part of this book.) The Heart has his place in men's bodies, but
with his picked end tends toward the left side, and left nipple: therefore
do the common people suppose that the heart lies in the left side.

Out of this springs first the vital spirits, Spiritus vitales, which with a
continual stirring and moving preserve it, and that with such force, that the
same being out of the body, yet it forcibly stirs and goes up and down,
even as one may specially see by the hearts of the Salmon and Sturgeon. Through
which continual stirring from this place, it does communicate his motion
through all the Arteries, and also the life it self unto the whole body, the
which is to be known by this, that when the same is infected with any
impostume, or with any weapon never so little pierced, that forthwith the
vital spirits, yea life it self must depart out of the body; like as is
daily seen by the like experience of the hearts of all beasts which are
killed, whereas the heart being found sound, so soon as the same is never so
little touched or stirred, that then all warmth and help is taken from all
other members, whereupon immediately death ensues, and is none otherwise but as
if ones heart be not before harmed.

Item, this heart is also the dwelling place of all inclinations of the mind, as
mirth, vexation, sorrow, fear, care, hope, love, hate, anger, malice, mercy,
sufferance, or forbearance, and such like.

Fourthly, appear in the Heart such diversities of affections, with such a
force and virtue, that if the one do reign above the other, the same draws
such an humor unto it, as is most acceptable for it: As anger draws unto it
Cholera, mirth discusseth the blood over the whole body, and through fear and
fright hasteneth it toward the heart: in great sorrow and vexation it draws
the melancholicke blood unto it, etc. How were it then possible to express all
the causes of these and of other more wonderful passions of the heart? yet have
many renowned and learned men written very amply thereof, whose books may be
read and perused.

Also it is certain, that all bodies, which have great hearts, are fearful,
and faint hearted, for that they have not so much heat as is needful for them.
Contrariwise, all small hearts, which draw the heat the better together are
stout and valiant: This may well be understood of great and spongeous hearts,
which are not so wide, nor filled with so many vital spirits: like as are
other great and compacted hearts, that be hot, and filled with vital spirits,
then can they not otherwise but show themselves manly and courageous, like as
the common proverb says, he has a great Heart.

The Heart has some fatness on the top, yet in lean bodies very little, but
in fat bodies somewhat more, the which is ordained by nature therewith to
moisten the Heart, that through his continual stirring it should not be so sore
dried. Likewise it has otherwhiles a thick fleshie skin which lies round
about the heart, and sometimes waxes almost as hard as a bone, the which the
Grecians call Pericardion, and we the closet of the heart, and has such
moisture in it, like as it were urine, yea otherwhiles like as it were with a
sweet deaw. And when as this moisture comes to dry up, like as it happens
in them that consume or live in great sorrow, then must death follow after it.
Like as to the contrary does come to pass, when there is too much of this
foresaid moisture, that thereby is caused the panting of the Heart, and
distemperature of the vital spirits. It were here too long to rehearse all the
signs of a hot, cold, dry and moist Heart, or of a cold and dry, hot and
moist, cold and moist, or hot and dry: all the which are intemperatures or
Intemperies: of which is spoken in the first part and 1.. We will also touching
this, recommend the Reader to Galen, who has at large discoursed of these
Intemperies.

But I must adioyne thereto three things which concern the heart, whereof the
heart of them that dyed of Cardiaca or swouning, or their hearts that dyed
through poison cannot be burnt.

Secondly, the foolish fantasy of the Egyptians, that were of opinion, that
men's hearts do every year augment one quarter of an ounce, and that during
fifty years, and that afterward from year to year it did abate as much
again, which was the cause that men could not live above one hundredth years.

Thirdly, that the heathen of their offered beasts (and also Iulianus the
Emperor that fell from Christ) do maruellously seduce people and persuade,
that all things to come may thereby be known, whereof we will speak no more
at this present. We will now proceed with our intent, and treat of all the
diseases and accidents of the heart, and do teach thereby how the same are to be
helped and cured. And albeit touching this there be many maladies and accidents
described by the learned, yet we will nevertheless briefly rehearse only of the
faintnes of the heart, of whatsoever cause that it may proceed, as swouning,
quaking and panting, be it through heat or cold; amongst which may be
contained all accidents and maladies which are incident unto the heart, and
lastly add thereto of the malady which is commonly called, the griping of the
heart.

Of the fainting of the Heart in general.. 1.
EVen as the Heart is the most principal and precious part of the body, so
does the same declare that there is the more care and providence to be had, for
to avoid and take away his maladies, for to cure all that which hurts it, and
to prefer all that helps; and to obtain the same, thus do the learned
write these common rules hereafter following.

First, that with expedition some good means and counsel be used and had
against all that might happen unto the heart, for to expel the matter which is
cause thereof, for that there is no part of the body which may tolerate less
delay of help.

Secondly, for other members which have any disease, there one thing is
commanded, another forbidden, so that thereby no hurt might happen, which
nevertheless is not so duly observed, as whenever is given to one that has
the Ague, Wine or Flesh, which notwithstanding is clearly forbidden: but this
must be more strictly observed in the infirmities of the heart, by reason that
it is much more needful for to strengthen the same as can be best, and to
comfort it.

Thirdly, if any member be by nature hot, and yet there strikes more heat
unto it, then must a great cooling be used: but one may not do so to the heart,
whereto less or smaller things be used, neither yet to delay it so long,
before you seek remedy to cure it, as shall be hereafter declared in the
eight and ninth instructions.

Fourthly, the parts that are helpers of the motions and actions of the whole
body, must not at any hand be touched with any strong purgation, so that
thereby the same parts, and consequently the whole body be not ouerweakened,
the which must so be observed in the heart, by reason that the same does procure
all actions of the whole body.

Fifthly, for that the diseases of the heart are caused for the most part of
blood and wind, therefore is Phlebotomy much better for it then purging: but
if the malady proceed of blood, then must the Liver vein be opened on the
right side; if of wind, then is the Liver vein on the left side to be opened.

Sixthly, if that purging medicines must needs be used; then is there always
to be put thereto that which may comfort the heart, as hereafter shall be taught,
thereby to strengthen the same, and to preserve it, by reason that all purging
m^dicines are not a little contrary to the heart.

Seventhly, it must be narrowly looked unto what part of man's body does send
these humors toward the heart and causes this malady, for to make ready the
purgation accordingly, and to add the cordial things unto it, as has been
said.

Eighthly, if that the Heart have gotten a bad hot complexion, that the same must
be cooled, then is to be tempered amongst the cooling medicines some warming
things: for if nothing but only cold things were used, then might perchance the
natural heat be quenched, and the patient killed.

Ninthly, the cause of this mixture of cold and warm things is; for that cold
things are commonly of no force or power without the help of warm things, to
penetrate to the Heart. As for example, the Saffron is therefore added to the
Trociscos de Camphora.

For that all which shall here afterward be written of the malady of the
Heart, is no other thing but a faintnes, whereof the one is greater and the
other lesser than another, like as Lipothymia and Syncope, it is needful to
write of their differences.

Lipothymia is a swouning or defect of mind, which sometimes is but small and
sometimes great, and is soon ended: contrariwise Syncope comes suddenly upon
one, and that with such vehemency, that he can neither feel, see, nor hear,
so that between death and him there is no other difference, then that as yet
he has some breath.

Notwithstanding is the Lipothymia not so little to be regarded, but that
speedily help must be had for it, for that it may quickly turn into Syncope.

But before all things shall every one know, that both these tremblings of the
heart, have so great acquaintance with the panting of the heart, that many
Physicians have comprehended them under one title, as the remedies described
every where do testify the same: but that they have made many necessary
differences between hot and cold swounings, and first to write of the
foresaid small swouning, or defect of mind, which takes one unawares,
therefore are these things following to be used which do strengthen and warm
the heart, as Balm, Burrage, Rosemary, Basil, Penniroyall, Marierom,
Wormwood, and specially marrish Mints. Of roots, Cipers roots, Zeduary,
Costus, Ginger, Elecampane roots, both the Beetes roots, and Doronicum. Of
seeds, Ameos, Smallage seed, Annis seed. Of Spices, Cardamome, Nutmegs,
Lignum Aloe, Saffron, Cucubes, Cloves.

Item, take Muscus, Ambra, Hearts bones, Citron pills, Mastick, Myrrh, Blattae
Byzantiae, good and pleasant tasting Wine.

Item, take these warming confections following, as Diamargariton Calidum,
Diacinamomum, Diapliris, Laetificans, Dia Moschu, Diambra, Aromaticum Rosatum,
which is of a temperate nature, Treacle, Mithridate, confected Citron pills,
confected Elecampane roots, and other things more that do follow afterward.

These things are of a temperate nature, as Iacint, Smaragdes, Saphirs, Rubies,
Perles, Corrall, Gold, Silver, Amber, Mirobalanes Bellerici, Buglosse, silk
worms nests, burnt Iuorie, Barberies, Tormentill, Hearts bones, and Saffron. To
cool the heart, take Melon seed, Pompeon seed, Cucumber seed, Gourd seed,
the seeds of Fleawort, Sorrel seed, prepared Coriander, Pomgranats, Lymons,
Citrons, and their juice, Quinces, sour Apples, Pears, Raspes, new and dry
Prunes, and all pleasant sauouring fruits, water Lilly flowers, the juice of
the Vine, Vinegar, Roses, Violets, shaven and burnt Iuorie, all kind of
Saunders, Amber, and sealed earth. Of compounds, is the confection of
Diarrhodon Abbatis, Triasantalon, Manus Christi with Perles, Diamargariton
frigidum, Trocisci de Camfora, conserve of Roses, of Violets, Sirupe of Raspes,
Lymons, Violets, Roses, water Lillyes, Vinegar, and Oxysacchara, and all that
you shall find written hereafter. Moreover, there are hereafter set down
diverse confections, that comfort the heart in heat and cold.

The order of life or diet for this faintnes of the Heart.
A Bad stomach is otherwhiles no small cause of this swouning, for it
procures before the swouning come a heat over the whole body. As soon as
this shall be perceived, it is not amiss to use for it confected Balsam wood,
but in the stead thereof take Tabulates of Xyloaloe, which are very requisite
for this. Secondly, he is to take every morning one dragme of fine Treacle,
which must be twelve years old, with Rose water, of the confection of Muscus,
Diamoschu dulcis, he is to drink of it oftentimes with Basil water one
quarter of an ounce at a time, but that which concerns the stomach shall
follow hereafter. Fourthly, this patient is to have hanging about his neck a
good Smaragde stone, or at the least selected Corrall. Fifthly, take one dragme
and a half of Rose buds which are not fully blown, Vine leaves, red and white
Behen, flowers and seeds of Basil, bark of Frankincense, Marierom gentle, of
each one dragme, Balm one dragme and a half, Camfer one scruple, Amber half
a scruple, Musk two grains, each beaten by it self, and being bounden in a
piece of silk, are to be smelt unto oftentimes: but if the faintnes be not
helped thereby, and that it be feared that he will be more fainter, then must
those things be used against the swouning that are described hereafter.

But for the first, you are to use these cordial waters and plasters
following: Take Balm water twelve ounces, Rose water, Violet water, the water
of Willow leaves, and of wild Vine leaves, of each six ounces, burnt Iuorie,
Roses, red and white Saunders, Hearts bones, seeds and leaves of Basil, of each
two scruples, Musk two grains, Amber five grains, Muscadell two ounces, let
all these seethe together about one quarter of an hour (except the Musk and
Amber) make then a piece of red Scarlet cloth wet therein, one quarter of a
yard square: wring it warm out, and lay it four or five times in an hour
upon the heart. A spoonge may also be laid in this water, and smelt unto
oftentimes: for both of them do maruellously comfort the Heart.

If so be that the swouning does not yet cease, then take two ounces of this
foresaid powder, and temper amongst it as much Barley meal, one scruple of
Saffron, and sees it with good old wine until it be reasonable thick, temper
it well in a mortar with four leaves of beaten gold, and one dragme of
prepared Pearls, spread these upon a piece of red Scarlet cloth, and then lay
it on the left breast. This is approved to be marvelous good, and to have
sometimes helped such a grief within one quarter of an hour, and sustained
the sick person by his strength.

Of Syncope the great Swouning.. 2.
THe second and sorest swouning of the Heart is called Syncope, and is thus
described: Syncope is a distraction of all feeling and stirring of the whole
body, with extreme faintnes. Amongst many other inward causes whereof, are
these: receiving of any pestilent or other stinking air, whether it be in time
of the plague, or of the stench of any hollow caves, or of the biting of any
venomous beasts, as of Scorpions, mad dogs, and venomous fumes of metals, like
as in the melting often happens: of great fear and frighting, of former
diseases, as of the dead palsy, the pleurisy, inflammation of the lights,
suffocation of the mother, of worms, of ouer-watchings, of many laskes, of
much bleeding, of great hunger, of much smarting, of great pain, yea also of
great joy, and other strong motions of the mind. So that this great swouning
has great familiarity with the dead palsy: albeit there be a difference,
whereof we are to speak. If any get the palsy, then remains his face by
good semblance: but in this swouning it is like to a dead body. For in this
swouning, all the blood runs toward the Heart, so that the patient remains
without any feeling, and in such an estate, that no man can tell whether he be
dead or living: so that there is a common proverb of it, That such dead men
ought not to be buried in three days.

Secondly, they are like one to the other, in that neither breath nor pulse is
perceived.

Thirdly, in the palsy the patient feels before a heaviness in the head,
but not in the Syncope: nevertheless they accord in this, that the affected
party lies as though he were dead.

But in this swouning it is certain, if it come after a long panting of the
heart, and continues long then it is a messenger of death, and chiefly if there
be Ellebor blown into the patients nose, and it does not stir and move him at
all.

The signs of the swouning to come, of what cause soever it be provoked, are
sweating and panting of the Heart, a slow and feeble pulse, bleaknes of the
lips and face, chillness of the outward members, numnesse of the sense of
feeling and moving: where these signs appear, there a strong swouning
draws near, and there is need of good counsel.

First, and with speed, when the swouning approaches or is extant, then is the
patient to be spouted in the face with Rose water, or (if that be not ready to
be had) with cold Well water, and it will be the better if there be a little
Musk tempered amongst it: for thereby will the natural heat be driven
inwardly, and the vital spirits revived. Stop also his nose and his mouth a
little while: for if the breath find no vent, then turns it back, and
thereby quickneth the natural heat.

Secondly, his arms are to be bound hard, and then made loose, and bound hard
again. The palms of the hands and plants of the feet are well to be rubbed
with raw clothes, salt and vinegar, to the end that the matter may be drawn
from the heart.

Thirdly, his stomach and about the mouth of the stomach is also to be well
rubbed, whereby the natural heat may be quickened. All fragrant herbs, which
are hot of nature, are to be holden before his nose, as all kinds of Spice,
Musk and Amber, if so be that the cause of this matter be cold.

But for women that do fall into swouning through the suffocation of the
Mother, it is another case, as shall be showed elsewhere, for that all
odoriferous things are hurtful to be holden before their noses. A grain of
Musk dissolved in Wine and then given, is passing good. And if the patient
have vehemently closed his mouth, then is the same to be broken open with a
wooden stick, and his tongue, teeth, and roufe of the mouth to be anointed
with Treacle or Mithridate. But if the cause be through heat, then must the
patient have cold things given him to smell unto, as Camfer, Saunders, Roses,
and such like here before expressed. And of what cause soever this swouning
does come, yet is it always good that there be made a great noise about the
patient, and that he be called upon by his name, and blow Campher in his nose,
or Saunders in stead thereof: these are now the commonest means, if the
swouning be procured through heat or cold, that are to be used at a sudden.

Secondly, all the windows are to be set open, that then the patient may be
refreshed with the fresh air, and they are to speak very friendly unto him.
Also you are to annoint his pulse, nose, and temples, with the foresaid things,
and give him all comfortable things, as is before said, that nature may thereby
be strengthened and quickened.

An order of life for Swouning.
FIrst, all men that are subject to this swouning, must beware of all cloudie,
moist, and cold air, and shun such like dwellings, must suffer no sweat upon
the head, must cast off all sweatie shirts, and put on clean: he must forbear
all moist and cold meats, as Spinach, Beetes, Lettice, Purslaine, Endive,
Cherries, hasell Nuts, Abricocks, Cucumbers, and such like, but new Figs are
good for him. Further, he must be kept from all gross binding meats, from all
that is made of dough, from all Fish, as Eeles, Tenches, and all great
corpulent Fish. But Crabs and small Fishes which are taken in fresh waters he
may eat, being a little broyled. He must also eschew all old and fat flesh,
Cheese and such like. He must use for his drink all clear white Wine that is
not sweet, or a good old mild sort of Beer: he must wholly forbear drinking
of water: he must not ouercharge his stomach with eating and drinking, but
chew his meat well, and leave off eating with appetite. He must not sleep
after meat, or at least not too long. He must walk well two hours before
meat, yea run up hills, for that consumes well the moisture whereof the
swouning is provoked. He must specially fly all anger, sorrow, vexation, and
other troubles of the mind, as is sufficiently declared before.

But what medicines are to be used for the swouning, shall be here taught: the
patient must as soon as is possible, take these pills following in the morning
betimes.

Take pills of Rubarb one dragme, Hiera composita one scruple, make nine pills
thereof with Rose water, afterward give him this drink following 6. days one
after another: Take half a drag. of Agaricke, Hermodactili, and Rubarb, of
each one scruple, Diagridij, and Sal Gemmae, of each two grains, Ginger,
Squinant, Spica, and Annis seed, of each three grains, Honey of Roses half an
ounce, let it steep one whole night in three ounces of water wherein Woodbinde
is sodden, afterward let it seethe a walme, and strain it out. For to make
pills, take good Aloes two ounces, Mastick, Saffron, Violets, and flowers of
Buglosse, of each half a scruple, burnt Iuorie and Roses, of each three
grains, Diagridion seven grains, Agaricke, Turbith, and prepared Asure stone,
of each half a dragme: steep it all together with Cicorie water three days
long, and (being well stopped) let it dry in the Sun, or in another warm
place, yet stirring it often about until it be meetely thick: take then a
dragme thereof, and make thereof seven pills, whereof every evening you are to
take one pill a certain time long, afterward a whole year through take one
pill about the fifth day: but if the patient be full of blood, and of sufficient
strength, then are you after purging to open the Liver vein in the elbow on
the left side, and to let him bleed about five ounces.

For to keep open the body, you are to use this powder: Take Epithymum, roots
of Polipody, Thymus, Hearts tongue, and Cuscuta, of each one dragme, Argall and
Seny, of each half a dragme, Mace four scruples, stamp and mingle it all
together, take one dragme thereof at the least twice a week at one time,
tempered with a little wine, or some fresh broth: it purifieth, breaks wind,
and cleanses the heart and stomach. Item, take at the least (once a week) as
much Pieretrum as the bigness of a Pease, chue the same, and spet the moisture
out of the mouth.

Another.
TAke a good piece of white bread, mollify it in good Muscadell or Malmsey, if
so be that the cause of this swouning be of cold: but if it proceed of heat,
then mollify the same white bread in Rose water, in juice of Pomgranats, in
juice of Quinces, in ye juice of Citrons, or any flesh broth, and so eat it.
Also this patient may use conserve of Roses, Burrage, Buglosse, and Rosemary,
and other things more, which shall be expressed hereafter in the trembling of
the heart, after that heat or cold has the upper hand.

There are yet many more confections and cordial things prepared, which are
very profitable for this purpose, and do remain described before in the
discourse of the cold pain of the head where it begins, Take conserues of
Betony etc. Item take Pistacia three ounces, white Sugar six ounces, sirupe of
Roses four ounces, seeds of Basil, red and white Coral, Roses, burnt Iuory,
red and white Behen, of each one drag. Zeduary, Amber, and Saffron, of each two
scruples, Iacint, Smaragde, and Sapphire, of each half a scruple, Mace,
Cinnamom, and Cloves, of each one drag. six leaves of beaten gold, Pearls
four scruples: the Pistacia steep (being cut small) three days long in
Malmesey: afterward sees the sirupe and the Sugar thick enough, and first
temper therein the moist Pistacia, and afterward the rest beaten small,
whereof is to be taken the space of six weeks every morning the bigness of a
Walnut. This powder following is to be strewed upon the meat: Take Cinnamom
half an ounce, Saffron one dragme, Zeduary three quarters of an ounce: beat
and mix them all together. The Zeduary has a special power for to strengthen
the Heart. And there is to be dressed always in his meat Buglosse and Baulme.

Cordial waters.
To this end are prepared diverse cordial waters, as hereafter follows: Take
Cinnamom and Cloves, of each one ounce and a half, Nutmegs one ounce, red and
white Roses, of each ten handfuls, Lauander flowers seven handfuls, hyssope two
handfuls; power then thereupon a quart of Malmesey: temper them all together,
cut them small, and let it so stand nine days together, and afterward distill
it. Item, take good wine five quarts, two rases of Ginger, forty Cloves,
Cinnamom three quarters of an ounce, Mace one quarter of an ounce, Spike two
handfuls: If you will have it more forcible, then put two Nutmegs cut unto it,
let it steep all together six or seven weeks long, and afterward distill
it. Thus have the ancient Physicians done. Or, take four quarts of good wine,
Spike three handfuls, green Marierom gentle two handfuls, Mace, Cloves,
Cinnamom, and Nutmegs, as much as you think good: temper them together, and
set them a whole month long in the Sun in a glass: This may you keep so, or
distill it.

Another. Take Lauander three handfuls, steep it in a pint of wine, or
Malmesey, stop it tight; then set it for the space of thirty days in the Sun,
and afterward distill it. Of all these foresaid waters may a little be given
him when he begins to get the swouning, or has the same already. This juice
following is justly praised: Take a Capon or a Partridge, roast it leisurely,
baste it with Rose water and Muscadell, or any other good wine wherein Cloves
have been steeped; then press the juice out of the said bird, and give him
some thereof, and the rest let him eat now and then some. And that this juice
may continue good the longer, temper it with as much hard Sugar as you think
good. But will you have another? then wring likewise as much juice out of a
Pullet, or out of young Kids flesh, take two ounces thereof, new pressed juice
of Quinces one ounce and a half, and one ounce of good mild wine; temper them
all together, and give the patient to eat thereof. For this is also commodious
all Aquae Compositae, which are described in the eighth Part. For this swouning
may be used outward remedies after many manners: first, through shields: Take
Burrage flowers, and Violets, of each one handful, Cordial shields.
red and white Saunders, red and white Coral, red and white Behen, and Roses,
of each one dragme, Saffron half a dragme, burnt red Silk 15. grains,
Camfers, Muscus, Ambra, of each two grains, poune them all together, and mix
them in a red silken bag, and so lay it on your left breast.

Another. Take Ireos half an ounce, tame or wild Baulme, Citron pills, Buglosse
flowers of each one dragme, Mace one quarter of an ounce, yellow, white and red
Saunders, and Lignum Aloes, of each half a dragme; temper them with the powder
of the capital bags, which are described in the first Part, the twelfth
Chapter, in the beginning, where is mention made of the Brains: take thereof
as much as is needful for a bag to lay on the Heart. The same is also
wonderful good in time of the plague, being laid upon the Heart. Item, take
Ireos three ounces and a half, Damask Roses six ounces, Marierom, Cipers
roots, and red Styrax, of each half an ounce, Cloves one quarter of an ounce,
Calmus half a dragme, Muscus two grains, used as above.

This following is a very precious cordial shield: Take Burrage flowers,
Buglosse flowers, red and white Saunders, red and white Behen, Nutmegs, and
Couchenell, Lignum Aloes, Saffron, Seduary, white Diptamus, Cucubes, Basil
seed, Baulme, and Citron pills, of each half a dragme, Galliae musca^ae one
scruple, Muscus and Ambra, of each six grains, beat them all together
gross, and put it into a red Crimson bag, and lay it over the breast.

Here follow diverse more. Take Juniper berries, power thereto water of Sage,
poune them to pap, and then bind it luke warm upon the Pulse. Item take
Cinnamom, Mace, Saffron, Cloves, as many as you will, put Malmesey unto them,
and lay it all upon the Pulse. Take vnpouned Saffron, fasten it in the left
hand one hour at the least; it strengthens much the Heart. Take clean burnt
Baulme, Peniroyall, Cloves, water of Sage, and Roses; temper them, and annoint
therewith the patient, especially on the Pulses, under the nose, and upon the
temples of his head. The ancient Physicians do rub the heart with fresh Burrage
flowers; it is very good, but it is very weak. All odoriferous things which
are hot by nature, are to be used against the swouning through heat. But
Hyssope is chiefly to be commended for it, and all those who are subject to
this swouning are counseled to smell often unto it.

This Baulme following was ordained for the Emperor Ferdinandus: A precious
Balm to comfort the Heart, first ordained for the Emperor Ferdinandus.
Take a pound of Turpentine, six ounces of Virgin honey, twelve ounces of
water of life, even as hereafter be diverse described in the eight part, Lignum
Aloes, Turbith, yellow Saunders, Sage, roots of blew Flower deluce, and
Chamedrys, of each one dragme, Nutmegs, Galingall, Cucubes, Cinnamom, Masticke,
Frankincense, Cloves, Spica, white Mustard seed, Saffron, Ginger, Rue seeds,
and Costemary roots, of each three dragmes, Musk one dragme, Amber one
quarter of an ounce; beat them all gross together, and let it steep all
together one day and a night in the water of life. But the Musk and the Amber
are to be broken alone in some Muscadell wine. Lastly, temper the Turpentine
therewith, and distill it in seething water.

A good Salve.
TAke Amber, Zeduarie, red and white Coral, Blaettae Bysantiae, Basil seed,
red and white Behen, and Rosemary flowers, of each one dragme and a half, Mace
one quarter of an ounce, Sorrel, small Endive and Cicorie, of each half an
ounce, Roses and water Lillies, of each three quarters of an ounce, Rosin one
ounce and a half, Laudanum half an ounce, white Wax three dragms; melt the
three last things together, and as they begin to be cold, then mingle the rest
amongst it: afterward let it be spread on a round cloth, and laid upon the
left breast. If it be too hard, then make it softer with oil of Roses; both
which are good (as is said) against the swouning and faintnes of the Heart. Yet
is the Balsam much hotter then the salve, for it is temperate, and therefore
you may know how to use it accordingly. When you have made it softer, then
anoint the whole breast therewith.

This capital powder following may also be used for this: Take Indie Spica,
Ameos, Bay berries, Marierom gentle, of each one dragme, Lignum Aloes one
dragme and a half; beat all apart, and mix them together with five grains
of this powder: You must every evening when you go to bed strewe it on your
head.

Of the beating or panting of the Heart.. 3.
THe Grecians do call this disease Palmos, the Latinists Palpitatio, Tremor, or
Saltus Cordis, which is a trembling or panting of the Heart, contrary to the
common custom. It is caused (even as we have taught in the beginning of this
Chapter) of the abundant moisture which is in the closet of the Heart.

With these there may be yet more other inward causes, as the pain of the
stomach, vexation and offense of the Heart, of the Liver, the Lights, the Milt,
or Mother: Also of wind, ill damps, corrupted blood, and such like. The
outward causes are commonly great heat, sudden and great cold, great
emptines, great sorrow, fright, great fear, and other motions of the mind:
Further, of venime taken, biting of venomous beasts, pestilent Agues, corrupted
air, stinking dwellings; like as in prison, Mines, or other such like, which
are under the earth: of belly worms, and all other things that vex the Heart,
the which are well to be understood of the patient himself.

The inward signs are these: If the panting of the heart proceed of worms,
then is the beating of the heart bigger before meat then after: but if the same
come of a bad stomach, then may it easily be marked through pain in the same
place, if the same be wroong: Also by the wambling and vomiting: If it come by
fulness of the same, then is the disease most grievous after meat; but if
through emptines, then it is most sore before meat. If it proceed of fright,
sorrow, and such like, you must understand and learn that by the patient: If
it come of winds, then it is very suddenly upon one, and soon gone away
again. If it be provoked of heat, then is the pulse swift, and the breath is
strong, and disordred. If it proceed of blood, then is the vrin gross, and
the pulse beats speedily and strong, his face will be red, and about the heart
is always great heat, the patient is always light hearted, the which is much
augmented through meats that make and engender much blood. Or if this disease
be caused of Cholera, then is his vrin yellow and thin, the pulse beats
continually, swiftly, with great thirst, possibly through daily meat, whereby
the Cholera is increased, or of former pains taken. If this be caused of
Phlegma, that appears by the white and thick vrin, of small, slow, and
disordred pulse, the patient is sleepie and faint-harted. This is also wont to
be caused of meats that procure Phlegma. Likewise in winter time, when this
panting of the heart is caused of Melancholy, then is the sick body fearful,
the body decreaseth, and falls away, and that most of all in Harvest, with
many more melancholic signs that are elsewhere described. This panting of the
heart does often haunt both young and aged people, whereby the occasion is hardly
to be adjudged: and in all such it is found, that the letting of blood has not
only eased them well, but also thoroughly helped them, and chiefly if therewith
they have observed a good order in eating and drinking, and use all such
medicines as have abated the blood and other humors: howbeit the same happens
very seldom that aged people be cured thereof, for that they most of all
chance to dye of a hot Ague, or of swouning, and that commonly between
forty and fifty years. Thus much for the beating or trembling of the heart.

Of the panting of the Heart through heat.. 4.
IF by the panting of the heart there be discerned a swift pulse, and an Ague,
then is it a sign yt it comes of blood or Cholera, the which is not without
danger: for it often happens, that then they do fall into a swoune, and thereby
immediately remain dead. Now for to remedy this, must the sick persons face,
hands, feet, and pulse veins be forthwith sprinkled and rubbed with these
compounded waters: take Rose water four ounces, Mints water two ounces, Roses,
burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, of each two scruples, Muscus and Ambra,
of each two grains, Vinegar two ounces, Malmesey two scruples, mix them all
together, and when you will use thereof, then stir it well about. Secondly,
take pleasant Wine, and water of Buglosse, of each one ounce, Specierum
Diamoschu dulci one scruple, temper it, and give it to the patient warm to
drink. Thirdly, he shall continually smell to odoriferous bags, that shall
hereafter be described. Afterward, as soon as is possible, ought the Liver
vein be opened in the right arm, and four or five ounces of blood be letten
out, but not before that the sick person has gone to stool. The next day
following, he shall take this potion: take sirupe of Citron pills one ounce,
small beaten Rubarb, and prepared Agarick, of each two scruples, sirupe of
Roses half an ounce, Ginger and Spica, of each six grains, Sal Gemmae two
grains, temper them all together with three ounces of the water of Burrage,
and so drink it luke warm, and fast thereupon four hours.

You may also cause him to be purged with Cassia, Tamarines, yellow
Mirobalanes, Manna, and Rubarb, putting to either of them some Agarick. As for
example, you may take this Purgation following: Take water of Buglosse one
ounce and a half, Cicorie water two ounces, Rubarb one dragme and a half,
prepared Agarick one dragme, the juice of Roses half a dragme, Spica one
scruple, Ginger five grains: let this steep 24. hours in a warm place, and
making it hot in the morning you must strain it through a cloth, and so
drink it warm, and then fast four hours after. This being done, he must
eight days one after another, take every morning this drink following: Take
sirup of Apples, sirup of Citron pills, and Oxysacchara, of each half an ounce,
water of Balm and of Buglosse, of each one ounce, Cicorie water one ounce and
a half, temper them all together to a potion. And it were not ill that he take
every fourth day one of these pills following: Take Aloe one quarter of an
ounce, Rubarb one dragme, Agatick four scruples, red and white Behen, Saffron,
Mace, and Indy Salt, of each three grains, make pills thereof with the juice of
Buglosse, six to a dragme. If there be greater heat approaching, then is it
advised, that at the first every day be taken half a dragme of Trociscos de
Camphora, with sirupe of Pomgranats dissolved, and so continue four days
together. And if this will not help, then must the patient drink new
Buttermilke, with all these purgations and letting blood. It is also highly
commended, to carry a sober life in eating and drinking, yet to take heed that
the patient remain by his strength.

We will here mention some more things that are very commodious for the panting
of the heart, like as fragrant things which are of a cold nature, as Violets,
water Lillies, Roses, all Saunders, Corrall, Perle, Campher, Hearts bones,
Iacints, Smaragdes, shaven Iuorie, Amber, Coriander, the juice of Limons, Rose
water, odoriferous fruits, Quinces, Pears, Apples, and their like. Amongst
compounds are the confection of Orange pills and their sirupe, the confection of
Citrons, and their sirupes, conserve of Buglosse, Roses, Violets, Burrage,
confected Cherries, and their sirupes, the flowers and roots of Cicorie
confected, sirupe of Sorrel, Burrage wine, and Cherie wine, the Tabulats of
Diamargariton, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Dragagant, and Manus Christi with perles:
but the Physicians do ordain many compounded medicines, as hereafter do follow.

The laxatiue sirup of Roses is specially commended, if there be any stopping
of the belly, for it cools and diuerteth all ill vapors from the heart,
whereby the heart is much pained.

There are also made for this many confections, according to the importance of
the patient, whereof there follow some hereafter: Take conserve of Roses half
an ounce, conserve of Buglosse two ounces, conserve of water Lillies one
quarter of an ounce, Perles, Iacints, Smaragdes, Citron seed, Sorrel seed,
and red Corrall, of each one dragme, red, white, and yellow Saunders, prepared
Coriander, burnt Iuorie, red and white Behen, Hearts bones steeped in Rose
water, of each half a dragme, filed Gold and Silver, of each two scruples,
Gold and Silver leaves, of each xv. Sugar one ounce and a half: beat them all
small together, and temper it with Rose water, but not on the fire.

Item, take the juice of sweet Apples, and of Buglosse which is clear and
settled, of each two ounces, Doronicum, Citron pills, Burrage flowers, Roses,
shaven Iuorie, of each half an ounce, Basil seeds half an ounce, Myrtle
leaves, Balm, Coriander, Cinnamome, Galingall, Seduary, Spike, Lignum Aloes,

Iacincts, Saphires, Granates, which be prepared, of each one dragme, Perles
three dragmes, Amber and Campher, of each half a scruple, Musk one dragme,
make a powder thereof, and to every ounce of powder put twelve ounces of Sugar:
dissolve the Sugar in Rose water, and seethe it for to make Tabulates thereof,
or a confection.

This confection is of a temperate nature, very forcible for all swouning, and
maladies of the heart. These two next following are cooling.

Take conserve of Roses, Buglosse, Burrage, of each one ounce, Species de
Gemmis, and Rubies, of each one scruple, Hearts bones, and peeled Citron seed,
of each 10. grains, sirup of Apples as much as you desire to make it soft, use
thereof in the morning two hours before meat. The other: Take conserues of
Roses two ounces, conserues of Buglosse one ounce, Species Triasandalon, burnt
Iuorie, Sorrel seeds, peeled Melon seed, Gourd seed, and peeled Cucumber
seed, Limon seed, and Oxysacchara, of each three quarters of an ounce, Sugar
half an ounce, Perles two scruples, three leaves of beaten Gold, mix it with
the sirupe of Apples unto a confection. And if this panting of the heart come
too often, then give of this powder following half a dragme tempered with Rose
water, and water of Buglosse.

Take red Corrall, Iacinct, Smaragdes, and Saphir, of each five grains, small
filed Gold three grains, Perles half a drag. temper them together, and put
thereto a spoonefull of white Vinegar, and make a potion thereof. Item, take
red Corrall, Perles, Iacincts, and Smaragdes, all together prepared, of each
one scrup. and give thereof half a drag. with some kind of distilled water.

Restoratiue waters of Capons are very requisite for this, which must be thus
prepared: Boil the Capon in water, wherein has diverse times gold been
quenched, chop it afterward in pieces, and put thereto flowers of Borage,
Buglosse, Violets, Roses, Citron peeles, Cinnamome, Cloves, Balm and Saffron,
of each one dragme. If you cannot get all these, then take as many of them as
you can get, and distill them all together with flesh and broth in hot water:
and then when any body is very feeble, give him a meetely draught thereof; it
strengthens not only the Heart, but the stomach also marvelous much.

There is also another made with spices, as follows: When the Capon is made
clean, then stamp him with bones and flesh in a mortar, afterward power it
into a glass helm, Borage, Balm, Endive, Fennel, and Rose water, of each
two ounces; then put thereto the stamped Capon. Item, put more thereto the water
of Wormwood and of Comfery, of each one ounce, Spec. de gemmis, Diarrhodon
Abbatis, Diamargariton the cold, Cinnamome, Lignum Aloes, of each one scrup.
distill them all together as before.

Moreover, there is another Capon water to be distilled, as follows: Take an
old Capon that is made clean, put thereto four quarts of water, let them
seethe well together, then pull off the skin, and the fatnes, and then break
him all to pieces, and distill water thereof as before. You are to salt this
water, so that it may last the better without stinking. You have also here
before in the fifth Chapter in the 22.. a precious water, which strengthens
the Heart wonderful much, the which may be also used for the same.

Sirupe of Apples.
We have often here before admonished of the sirupe of Apples, which is thus
made: Take the juice of sweet and sower Apples, of each five ounces, seethe it
to the half, scumming it, then let it stand two days to settle; put thereto
three ounces of Sugar, and then seethe them together unto a sirupe. Another:
Take the juice of the best tasting sweet and sower Apples, of each twelve
ounces, seethe it until it be well scummed, then put thereto six ounces of
Sugar, and let it seethe together to a sirupe. These sirupes strengthen the
weak panting Heart, preserve one from swouning, and strengthen the stomach.

Item, take Rose water, the juice of sower Apples, and water of Buglosse, of
each three ounces, seethe these together to a sirupe, or to a Iulep.

For this is also good many kinds of accustomed sirupes, as the sirupe of
vinegar, and of Limons, of Raspes, Violets, water Lillies, veriuice, Sorrel,
Borage and Buglosse, also Iulep of Violets and Roses: the which are to be found
in the first Register by their names.

any other that like you best. And always for one ounce of Species, you must
take 12. ounces of Sugar.

The same virtue that these shields have is also in the Plasters, for which
these following are highly commended, as well to cool the panting of the heart,
as the pulse, and therewith for to strengthen the breath, heart, and all
natural powers. Take Doronicum, Hearts bones, red and white Behen, of each one

Vinegar, make a plaster, and spread it on a red woollen cloute, and then lay
it on the left breast.

For these sick persons it is also very commodious (like as is already
expressed) to hold at their noses continually odoriferous things that are cold
of nature. For which be used the Pomanders which are described in the sixth
Part, or these following: Take Basil, Roses, Violets, burnt Iuorie, and Hearts
bones, of each two dragmes, Camfere two scruples, Musk and Amber of each four
grains, red and white Saunders, red and white Coral, of each one drag. beat
each alone, and being tempered, bind them all together in a red piece of
silk, and smell thereon continually. These simples also are very commodious,
especially if there be an Ague with it, as Violets, Roses, Saunders, water
Lillies, Rose water, Vinegar, and such like, as has before been showed.

Clisters to comfort the Heart.
It is very profitable also for the patient every morning to use these Clisters
following: for it does not only loose the body, but also strengthen the Heart.

Take Mallows, Violet leaves, Linseede, and Fenegreeke, of each one handful
and a half, seethe them in broth wherein has been sodden a Lambs head, then
take twelve ounces of this decoction, oil of Violets and sweet Almonds of
each one ounce, the marrow of Calves bones, Duckes grease, Hens grease and
sweet Butter, of each three dragmes, Tho. Sugar one ounce: all this being
made, then set it warm. In like manner may this salve be continually used: Take
oil of sweet Almonds, Ducks grease and sweet butter, of each one ounce, the
juice of Mercury four ounces; seethe these together till the juice be
thoroughly sodden away: with this ointment annoint from the Navel downwards
unto the Hips, in the evening when you go to bed. This Clister may be used both
in cold and hot causes of the panting of the Heart.

Now as concerning the order of life, especial care must be taken that he be
not ouercharged with eating and drinking. In the beginning of this sickness,
Barley paps are very commodious: Also Hens or Pullets dressed with Vinegar or
Veriuice. In fine, he ought not to order himself in this sickness, then
according to the custom of other hot diseases. It is very good to seethe or
steep in his drink Burrage or Buglosse with the flowers. He must refrain
from all clowdie cold and moist air, his bed and his chamber shall he hang and
strewe with Willow leaves, Roses, water Lillies, and Vine leaves, and that
principally when it is hot weather. Also he must beware of all windy and
flatulent meats; as Milk, Pottage, Honey, fruit, and especially gross slimy
meats, as those made of dough, gross fish, unleavened bread, old Cheese,
Chestnuts, and such like. In like manner also from all sharp and heady things,
as Onions, Garlic, Radishes, Leekes, and such like. All gross wines are
naught for him, and water also decocted with Licorice.

Of the panting of the Heart through cold.. 5.
WHen as there is no Ague with the panting of the heart, then is it a sign that
the same proceeds of cold which is caused for the most part of a watery
Phlegma, whereby the breath is hindered, yea sometimes is stuffed with such
force in the breast, that it seems that they will stifle. This has also a
slow inconstant Pulse, with an heavy breath, and sluggishnes of the whole body
and mind, and with an ill favored color of the face. This is to be remedied
as hereafter follows: Take water of Baulme, water of blew Flower deluce, and
Agrimony, of each one ounce and a half, and a little Sugar; and then drink it
four or eight mornings together very warm. But if the patient cannot go to
stool, then is this Purgation following to be given him: Take Electuarij Indi
one ounce, De Succo Rosarum half a dragme, temper this with three ounces of
good wine, and give it him in the morning betimes. And if the body be bound at
the time when the foresaid drink is to be used, then must the patient take
always one hour or twain before supper, one or two of these pills following:
Take Pillulae de Sarcocolla one dragme, Alephanginae one quarter of an ounce,
make thereof four and twenty pills with the juice of Roses.

Also he must drink this every morning: Take Treacle or Mithridate one drag.
or one and a half, according as you think best, and temper this with good
wine.

Some do advise, that at the first, yea forthwith you do give with wine one
dragme, or a dragme and a half of these Tabulates following: Take Masticke,
Indy Spike, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamome, Cloves, Cardamome, and Citron pills, of
each one drag. and a half, Musk half a scruple: make a powder thereof, and
give it him as aforesaid.

But the principal things serving to this panting of the heart, we will briefly
express, to wit, all that is warm of nature and smells sweet; as Amber,
Musk, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Cloves, Citron pills, Nuts, Cinnamom,
Marierom gentle, Basil, Spike of Indie, Baulme, Burrage, red and white Behen,
Doronicum, Zeduary, Cardamome, Rosemary, and Basil seed. Of all these things
are made confections, powders, and other compositions, as shall appear
hereafter. Of compounds these are commonly made at the Apothecaries, as
Diambra, Dianthon, Diathamaron, Laetificans de Gemmis calidis, Aromaticum
Rosatum, de Xylo Aloes, Diapliris, and confected Citron pills.

Here follow certain Electuaries for to use inwardly. Take Masticke,
Cinnamom, both kinds of Basil, Mints, Marierom gentle, and long Pepper, of
each a like much: when you have ten dragmes of this powder, then mix therewith
prepared Pearls, red Coral, Amber, burnt silk, red and white Behen, and Indy
Spike, of each half a dragme: afterward mingle it with Honey unto an
Electuary wherein Mirobalans Chebuli be put. This is good not only for the
panting of the heart, swouning, and for faintnes of the heart; but also for a
cold and feeble stomach, for it strengthens the same exceedingly.

This must also be noted, Nota.
when any confection is to be made wherein there is no certain quantity of
Honey, then are you to take always for one ounce of powder three ounces of
Honey, and then mingle them well together.

Item, take the flowers of Burrage, Buglosse, Rosemarie, red and white Behen,
Saffron, Doronicum, Lignum Aloes, Licorice and Basil seed, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Iacint, Smaragde, and Sapphire, of each half a scruple,
Sugar thrice as much as the other; make a powder thereof: whereof the patient
is to take a scruple at the least at meal tides.

Conserues of yellow Violets are very much used, and also highly commended for
this panting of the heart. You have also before in the first Part the twelfth
Chapter a good stomachicall powder, in the first. which serves for this
purpose. Item, there is in the 5.. a water of Lillies of Conuallies. Also in
the eight part many sundry waters of life, hot of nature, which are for this
very commodious. Confected Nutmegs do strengthen all inward members, and
consume all superfluous humors.

Conserve of Buglosse, Burrage, Marierom gentle, Rosemarie, Cowslips, and
Cicorie mingled with other, or each of it self, do much strengthen the heart.
In like manner are good for this all Pomanders which are hot of nature, and are
to be sought for in the Register, and those are special good, wherein Musk
and Amber are put.

Item, steep the space of certain hours Baulme in Malmesey, and besprinkle
therewith a hot brickbat, and then receive the vapor into the nose.

There may also be laid outwardly cordial waters upon the left breast, which
are thus to be prepared: Take Baulme water, and Buglosse water, of each six
ounces, Vinegar one ounce, Cloves one dragme, Saffron half a dragme, Musk
half a scruple; lay it with a cloth upon the left breast. Some do use the
juice of the herbs (when they be settled) in steed of their waters, which are
also very forcible. Item, take Buglosse water, and the water of Sorrel, of
each three ounces, water of Willow leaves, Rose water, and Wormwood water, the
water of Grass and of Baulme, of each two ounces, Spec. cordiales temperatas
one dragme and a half, Saffron eight grains, Myrrh, Diptamus, Gentian,
Lignum Aloes, yellow Saunders, Basil seeds, red and white Behen, Iacint and
Smaragde, of each half a scruple, the juice of Limons three ounces, Vinegar
one ounce, and Malmesey three ounces, temper them all together; it is wholly
temperate: so that it may be used for the comforting of the Heart in cold and
heat.

Another.
TAke fresh Rosemary flowers three ounces, Sage flowers, Buglosse flowers,
Burrage flowers, of each one ounce and a half, Saffron one scruple, seethe the
flowers in sufficient Muscadell, and then stamp them well together, and lay it
warm upon the left breast, this does not only strengthen, but makes also a
light breathing.

There may also shields be made for this, even as here do follow two sorts:
Take flowers of Burrage and Buglosse, of each one handful, red and white
Behen, and Saffron, of each one dragme, burnt red silk one scruple, Cloves,
Cinnamome, red Corrall, and Roses, of each half a dragme, Hearts bones, Musk
and Amber, of each three grains: put all these in a red silk bag, then must
you besprinckle them with warm Buglosse water, and so lay them to the left
breast. Item, take Zeduary, red and white Behen, Rosemary, Indy Spica, Roses,
red and white Saunders, Burrage flowers, burnt Iuorie, Myrtle leaves, Buglosse
flowers, and Camfer of each two scruples, Saffron and Gallia Muscata, of each
one dragme, Ambra half a scruple, Musk four grains, and make a bag thereof.
This is very temperate.

There are also these plasters and salues, that hereafter follow to be used:
Take Laudanum three ounces, Cloves and Citron pills, of each one dragme, Musk
one scruple, Turpentine half a dragme, melt then the Laudanum with the
Turpentine in a warm mortar, temper the rest amongst it, and so make a
plaster thereof, spread it on a red clout, and so lay it on the left breast.

For to make a salve or ointment, take unripe oil of Olives, and oil of
Roses, of each two ounces, Sandaraca one dragme and a half, parched Salt three
dragmes, Roses and Cypers roots, of each half a dragme: beat them all small
together, and keep and preserve it until occasion serve to use it. For it
happens oftentimes, that such humors do draw downwards, and fall in some place
of the hip, the knee, or ancle, the which must be kept warm.

Lastly, you ought not to rest, until the patient be free of this panting of
the heart, without using any medicine unto it, or that the disease may with all
diligence be diminished, if the same could be perfectly cured. Therefore must
always a little Saffron be mixed amongst all his meats, and if that cannot be
gotten, then is the dry powder to be dressed amongst his meat.

All these confections may be made thus: Take the Spec. Laetificantes
Almansoris, Dia Mosch^ dulcis, De gemmis temperatis, of each three quarters of
an ounce, red and white Saunders, red and white Corrall, of each one dragme,
Sirupe of Citrons, sirupe of Roses, and of Vinegar, of each five ounces, white
Sugar three ounces, seethe the sirupe and the Sugar until it be thicker than
Honey, and when it does begin to be cold, then mix the powder amongst it, and
use thereof in the morning, and two hours before supper, about the bigness of a
Walnut.

Thirdly, make two bags in this manner: Take Basil seeds, flowers of Buglosse,
of Burrage, Marierom, red and white Corrall, red and white Saunders, of each
half a dragme, Iacint, Smaragdes and Saphir, of each five grains, Campher one
scruple, wild Vine leaves one quarter of an ounce, Mace one dragme and a
half, stamp them all small, and fill herewith (as is said) a little bag, and
lay it on the heart.

The rule of life for this sickness consists in light meats, as in all field
Fowls, in meats that be dressed with odoriferous spices, yolks of new laid eggs
are very meet for him: further, behold what is taught in the discourse of the
cold brains, and cold head. For his drink, white Wine soberly drunken is
good. For Wine, be it as strong as may be, if one drink too much thereof, then
does it cause cold diseases: and if one desire to delay it, then is it to be
done with water, wherein glowing Gold has been extinguished.

This Wine following does strengthen the heart and the stomach also: Take
Ginger two ounces, Galingall one ounce, Cinnamome two ounces, Zeduary one
quarter of an ounce, Roses one ounce, Burrage flowers one ounce and a half,
and roots of Buglosse, beat them together grossly; and steep them in eight
quarts of Must or new Wine.

These spiced Wines are also good for the heart, if the disease do come through
cold: in like manner Wine of Burrage, of Hearts tongue, of Rosemary, of Buglosse,
and of Hyssop, of Marierom, and of Asarabacca, all which have power to warm
the panting of the heart, and also to strengthen it.

Item, take Balm water, and Buglosse water, of each six ounces, Sugar nine
ounces, seethe them to twelve ounces, and then use it as a Iulep. Or take water
of Buglosse alone, wherein Cloves were sodden, and drink sometimes thereof,
for it comfort maruellously.

Item, take Parsley with the root, boil them in Wine, according to that you
will have it strong: temper therewith a little Vinegar, and drink the same. It
takes away the panting of the heart, and all pain of the same.

Besides all this, the patient is to forbear all milkie, doughy, moist, and
windy meats, to arise from meals with hunger, and half a thirst: he must
after meat not move nor stir much, nor yet suddenly give himself to sleep:
he must also (according to his old wont) not sleep too much, whereby he might
consume and diminish the humidities of the body: he must also for the most
part lie on his right side, and fly all anger, sorrow, and all other vexations.

Of the panting of the Heart through a bad stomach or Appetite.. 6.
HEre before amongst the signs of this sickness, we have taught also that the
panting of the heart, and the swouning, are caused oftentimes through a bad
stomach. But if this disease come of a full stomach, then must the cure begin
with refraining from meat and drink, and first with opening the Liver vein,
afterward the Median. But if this be not very needful, then are you to
minister to the patient a mild Clister, for that all strong purgations are
enemies to this disease. Further, he must observe for his meat and drink,
even as is showed hereafter, in the description of the stomach. Now for to
strengthen the stomach through outward things, choose for it out of the
foresaid remedies that which best likes you.

Of the panting of the Heart through frighting.. 7.
IT is also admonished in the beginning, that ye Heart may come to much
distemperature through fright and fear, and that through the concourse of
blood, for which, this water of Elderne flowers is marvelous good. Lay then
into a glased helm chopped Elderne flowers: afterward lay thereon whole Eggs
with the piked end upwards, and the same opened alittle: then again Elderne
flowers, and so Eggs, until that the helm be so full as the water is high,
wherein the helm stands, and is to be distilled. When it is thus distilled,
then are you to lay of this Elderne water with a cloth upon the heart, thus do
the ancient Physicians accustom to make it. But mark that not only fear and
fright do disease the heart, but also all other motions of the mind, which are
herebefore for the most part already expressed: but what power they have in
furthering the sickness and health, is sufficiently before discovered in both
the descriptions of unnatural things, which the learned do call Res non
naturales, in the first Chapter and 10..

Of Heaviness, a disease of the Heart.. 8.
THe cause of this infirmity is Melancholia, where are sorrow, fear, and many
wonderful fantasies without any cause at all, which are thus to be purged:
Take Mirobalani, Chebuli, and Indi, of each one dragme, Epithimi one dragme and
a half, fine Bolus five grains, Muscus three grains, make pills thereof, or
mingle them with Wine: but this following is more common: Take Senie leaves one
ounce, beat them, and cast them in the juice of Burrage and of Buglosse, of
each six ounces, the juice of Apples three ounces: let it seethe alittle, and
wring it out, and then mingle therewith six ounces of fine Sugar: then let it
seethe again, and when it is cold, temper amongst it one dragme of Saffron,
and use thereof as often as you please, at each time one ounce, in Wine, or
tempered in one of the foresaid waters.

You have also in the 5.. before a very good confection, which begins thus:
Take Mastick, Cinnamome, etc. which may also be used for this passion.

This following is also very expert: Take roots of Buglosse half an ounce,
Zeduary, and Doronicum, of each one quarter of an ounce, beat them to powder,
and give every day thereof one dragme with Wine.

Behold also what has been said before in the first part, the twelfth Chapter,
and 8.. of the madness, Melancholia, and also in like manner in the third part,
which are commodious for this.

Of the griping of the Heart.. 9.
HEre before in the end of the fifth Chapter we have rehearsed, that this sickness
which we do call the griping of the heart, is rather a disease of the Lights, or
a kind of consumption, than a malady of the heart: but be it taken as it will,
yet nevertheless is this sickness very grievous for young children, and almost
incurable for old folks. And in fine, this english name does signify none
other, than the Fever Hectica, whereof we shall further discourse in the sixth
part (where we do write of all Agues) for we have always thought good to add
thereto this that follows: Take Walnuts with the shells, burn them wholly to
ashes in a pot, and thereof give a child one scruple, or more, according unto
the strength of the child.

Item, take dry brown Betonie, and therewith fill a small bag, and lay it on
the child's breast. Women are of opinion, that if the child may live till the
ninth day, then will it recover health.

For this you have also a special Capon water for children that have the
consumption, in the fifth Chapter, the 22..

It is also sufficiently known to all the world, how that the heart by
pestilent air, will not only be feebled and infected, but also inflamed with a
full destruction, against which you shall find sundry fit remedies in the sixth
part, in the treatise of the Plague.

For conclusion of this Chapter of the Heart, and of the second part of this
book, we will not omit the description of the Species de gemmis, whereof is so
often mention made, which are to be found at every good Apothecaries after two
kinds of preparations, to wit, the cold, and the hot Species, which may be
used to Confections, Powders, Cordial waters, and such like, but by reason
that the preparation of the same is very diverse, therefore we will here set
forth and describe only four sorts of the most common preparations.

Species de gemmis frig.
Spec. de gemmis frigidae which are cold of nature, are thus prepared: Take
Perles 3. drag. Rubies, Iacints, Grenades, Smaragdes, and Saphirs, of each one
drag. Hearts bones half a drag. burnt Iuorie, red and white Corrall, of each
one drag. Roses one drag. and a half, white and yellow Saunders, flowers of
Buglosse, Burrage, Sorrel seed, and Basil seed, red and white Behen, of
each one dragme, beaten Gold and Silver, of each five leaves.

Species de gemmis calidae.
Species de gemmis calidae or Mesuae: Take prepared Perles three drag. Saphirs,
Iacints, Sardonix, Correils, Grenades and Smaragdes, of each one drag. and a
half, Zeduary, Doronicum, Citron pills, Mace, and Basil seed, of each one
quarter of an ounce, red Corrall, Amber, and filed Iuorie, of each half a
scruple, red and white Behen, Cloves, Ginger, long Pepper, Spica, Cassy wood,
Saffron, and Cardamome, of each one drag. Cinnamome, Galingall, and Zeduary, of
each one drag. and a half, small filed Gold and Silver, of each two scruples,
Amber (...) quarter of an ounce, Musk half a drag. each beaten by it self,
and then tempered together.

Species de gemmis temperatae.
Species de gemmis temperatae. These species are of a temperate nature, not too
hot, also not too cold, the which may be prepared as is thought good.

Species Cordiales, Cordial species. For this, take Perles, burnt Iuorie,
Grenades, Cinnamome, Tormentill, and fine Bolus, of each three drag. red,
white, and yellow Saunders, shaven Iuorie, and Unicorns horn, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Iacints, Saphirs, white and red Corrall, Valerian,
Diptamus, Zeduary, and Lignum Aloes, of each one drag. sealed earth five
scruples, burnt silk two scruples, Hearts bones half a drag. red and white
Behen, of each two scruples, five leaves of beaten Gold, Musk and Amber, of
each ten grains, either of them prepared after his manner, are to be beaten
together.

Species Dia margariton frigidae.
The same operation have also almost the Species Dia margariton, whereof there
are 2. kinds hot and cold; the warm are here before described in the 12.
Chapter 12.. the cold are thus prepared: take peeled Melon seeds, Pompeon
seeds, Gourd seeds, and peeled Cucumber seeds, Purslane seeds, white Poppie
seeds, white, yellow, and red Saunders, Ginger, Roses, water Lillies, Burrage
flowers, and Myrtle seeds, of each one drag. white and red Corrall, of each
half a drag. Perles three drag. prepared together and being all beaten small,
temper them all together. This holds all fell people that fall quickly into a
swoune, in their strength, whether it be caused of the stomach, or of the heart;
it fortifieth all the inward vital parts: it is also good against all Coughes,
against the consumption; and all those that be brought low through a long
sickness, it brings again to their former might and strength.

The third part of this Book of Physic, Contains the Belly.
THe third part of man's body, have the Anatomists (who are the surueiors of the
uniformity and members of man's body) ascribed to the belly, which begins
outwardly from the breast, and inwardly from the Diaphragma, descending
downwards even to the legs. This part has outwardly these members following:
on the forepart the Nauel, which is placed in the midst of the whole body and
belly; under which do follow both the parts of generation, the which in man are
the testicles or stones hanging down in a cod: behind are the raines and the
buttockes which cover the fundament. The inward members are the stomach, the
liver, the gall, the kidneys, the bladder, the bowels, and in women the mother:
all which are subject to very dangerous diseases; of the which we are now to
write and dicourse.

The first Chapter. Of the Navel.
THe first outward member of the bellly is the Navel, which is called the
root of the belly, for that nature has formed it as the first amongst the
feeding parts, and also in newborn children holds fast in the mothers
belly, no otherwise then as it were a root in the earth. For like as the root
of a tree draws nourishment unto it whereby it grows: even so does the
navel also, which draws the blood unto it out of the mothers body thereby to
nourish the child, and make it grow. Even as the foresaid root of a tree, of
all that which it draws unto it for food, does not drive away any thing but
all that which is watery and unnecessary for his nourishment (as the gum which
one sees on a tree): even so does the string of the navel, which sweateth out
all superfluous moisture which is not good for nourishment, and does gather all
the same together in the Secundina until the birth day, the which is called of
women the flood, or breaking of the water.

All people be they young or old may get a rupture of the navel, which swells
and hangs out of the forepart of the belly; the which causes chiefly to
women a great hinderance if they be not helped thereof, like as we shall write
hereafter more at large when we shall discourse of the rupture: yet we will
here discourse and write somewhat of certain things for the behoof and ease
of young children.

Take Comfrey one ounce, stamp it well, put thereto half an ounce of molten
Wax, temper it well, and then lay it upon the navel. But if the rupture be
very great, then take Bears grease, and therewith anoint the whole back bone
of the child; it causes the Navel to be drawn in.

It is found to be oftentimes good for all ruptures of the Navel, be it in
people of discretion, or in young children, that the herb Perfoliata and his
seed be sodden and laid upon the rupture, and so worn, or carried continually
upon the navel, until that thereby the rupture be cured.

And the same seed being also sodden in water or in wine, and one drag. thereof
given to drink, or stamp the herb and the seed, and give thereof to the child
the weight of one scruple and a half to eat in pap. Also you shall hereafter
find a plaster of Perfoliata which you may use for this purpose.

A good powder. Take Lupins meal half an ounce, burnt linen one quarter of
an ounce, temper them together, and take thereof one quarter of an ounce: then
temper it afterward with wine, and lay it upon the navel.

Satyros. Some do write, that when a man without lust of women has his yard
erected, and coming to a woman the same will not swage nor relent, that then
it is called Priapismus, Satyrismus is the erection of the priuities, which is
lost by copulation. The cause of both these infirmities, are gross thick
vapors or dampes, with small heat that they cannot suddenly spend, as also
abstinence from women, continual use of Pease and Beans, and other pottages.
In fine, if there be not speedy remedy for these causes, then may ensue after
it as great a pain and distention of the sinews, as at the last might cause
an intolerable crampe and impostume.

For to remedy this infirmity, four things are to be noted: first, that the
patient beware of all such things which might cause the yard to stand, and
stir up venery: what these are, we will show immediately hereafter. Secondly,
he must endeavor to vomit, to let blood, and to take mild purgations. Thirdly,
to rub well the uppermost members, and not the undermost, to hinder the defluxe
of the matter. Fourthly, the patient must refrain women's company, except it be
that he have very great lust thereto. And for to cure this, it is therefore
advised that first the Median be opened, and afterward cause the patient to
vomit. If it will not thereby amend, open the vein again, and give the
patient a little of the muscilage of Fleawoort, which is made with the water of
Purslaine or of water lillies, or bathe the members and parts about it with
boiled Rue, Agnus castus. Cumin, and such like. Item, anoint the kidneyes and
the priuities with herbs cold of nature, of which the seeds of Fleawort,
Campher and Poplar salve are tempered. For his Sallad he must take Purslaine,
Endive, lettice, and such like. For vinegar, the juice of Limons and Citrons
are good in all his meats. To fast much, and live only by water and bread is
very good for him: but in case he will drink wine, then must it be well
watered. This plaster following shall he wear on the reins and the
priuities, so long as this sickness endures: Take white wax six ounces,
melt it, and wash it ten times in cold water: afterward temper amongst it
half an ounce of small bruised Campher, or wear upon the raines a thin plate
of lead full of holes, and wet it often with vinegar and Campher. This powder
following may also be prepared: Take Fleawort two dragmes and a half,
Purslaine seed, prepared Coriander, and Lettice seed, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Campher one dragme, temper them all together being powdered small, and
give every morning one dragme thereof with the sirupe of Limons, or fair
water. Under the patients sheets must be laid the leaves of Agnus castus, and
he must lie always upon his side. But if he cannot abide to fast, then is he
to eat much bread of Millet, and many Sallads, and his drink shall be white
Wine, wherein Rue, Cumin, Coriander, and such like have been steeped. Also cold
sirupes, cold confections, and such like, are very commodious for him. The sent
of Beuercod, of Campher, of Saunders, Roses, and all cooling things are also
passing good for him.

The third Chapter. Of the Testicles and Cods, and of sundry Ruptures.
NAture has fastened behind the yard or secrecy a wrinkled bag or purse,
wherein the testicles or stones are kept. This member is subject to many
Hernies or Ruptures, the which the Latinists do call with one common name
Herniam: which notwithstanding is manifold, and yet comprehended in three of
the principallest, which are caused of swelling, of scabbines, or of striving,
all which do fall down into the said Cods.

Yet is there another kind of rupture which comes about the Nauel, or about
the priuities, be it in man or woman, whereof we have made some mention before
in the first Chapter. The first sort of ruptures has many differences, and
each has his proper name, and are to be compared with each other in four kind
of ways, to wit, when they are caused through wind: through puffing up of the
veins with the blood, Varices: when the bowels or rim of the same little or
much falls down into the cod: lastly, when as the cod is so filled with
water or other moistures. Other do ret^^ four kinds more, which nevertheless
may be contained amongst the foresaid four. The causes of all these mixtures
are either inward or outward. The outward causes may be falls, thrus^^ much
labor, heavy burdens, loud hooping, coughes, extreme blowing or winding, and
chiefly when one has well eaten and drunken. The inward causes are, when his
bowels or rim cannot stay in his due place, but comes to fall down into the
navel, priuities, and into the cod. Likewise winds, humors, or gross
melancholicke blood, like as is said. The signs of all common ruptures, are an
extuberation or swelling, and puffing up of the same place beyond nature. These
Hernies appear at the first like to a small egg or nut, which by little and
little increases. If this rupture proceed of wind, that may be heard by the
shreeking or rumblng, and it may be discerned with the eyes.

Of the uppermost Hernies or Rupture, which happens above the Cod.. 1.
FIrst, to speak of the rupture which happens above the cod, (which is called
Scrotum) it is advised that forthwith remedy be had for it. The new ruptures in
children, are easily to be helped; and contrariwise when they wax old
(especially in old folks) then are they hard to be helped without incision. All
Chirurgions do know well, what kind of trusse they are to make for this:
forasmuch as it is difficult to describe the same, therefore be they to be put
in trust therewith.

It is commanded, and not without reason, that the patient must be laid on his
back, and that the bowels which are fallen down must be put up softly again,
until that they do lie in their due place: then must this plaster (spread upon
a thin piece of leather) be laid upon the rupture, and on the top thereof a
bolster bounden pretty and hard. They that be about thirteen years old, must
lie on their back; and if they must needs arise, then must they beware of
stouping, and hold still their hand upon the rupture. But young children must be
dealt with somewhat milder. But for this can no certain rule be prescribed:
but regard must always be had to the age, to the strength, the time and
disease, and so to deal thereafter. Now for to help these ruptures, we will
decipher first certain plasters which are very fit and requisite for it: Take
Pitch and Mastick, of each three dragmes, Frankincense one quarter of an ounce,
Hypocistis, Sarcocolla, Plasters for the rupture.
and the juice of Sloes, of each one dragme and a half, bloodstone, Dragon
blood and Aloe, of each two dragmes and a half, birdlime one dragme and a
half, Comfrey, Gals, Pomegranat peels, fine Bolus, of each three dragmes,
Aristology one quarter of an ounce, Sumach, blossoms of Pomegranates, of each
one dragme, two ounces of Dear suet, Turpentine and Wax as much as is
needful. The gums and juices dissolve in hot vinegar or wine: the rest powne
small, and make thereof a plaster. Another: Take pitch half an ounce, white
and red Wax, Litharge of gol^, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Momy, of each two dragmes
and a half, birdlime, Myrrh, Cipers nuts and Frankincense, of each one
dragme, Gips or plaster, prepared Bolus and Aloe, of each half an ounce,
Mastick, Comfrey and Daisie roots, of each three dragmes and a half,
Turpentine one ounce, Aristology round and long, and Galnuts, of each one
ounce, Dragon blood one quarter of an ounce, but melt the Gums in vinegar, and
powne all that is to be powned: the Pitch, Wax and Turpentine are to be
molten, and the rest tempered amongst them: the Wax may be augmented and
diminished according to the importance of the time. This plaster is also good
for all fractures of bones.

The ancient Physicians were wont to use for this rupture, this plaster
following: Take Cipers nuts two ounces, Myrrh, Cipers roots, Marioram gentle,
Gals, the juice of Sloes, Frankincense and Gum, of each one ounce: the Gum is
to be dissolved in wine, and the rest tempered amongst it, and so (as it is
said) laid upon the rupture. You shall not unloose the trusse but once in four
or five days, and then renew the plaster.

Item take fish lime two ounces, Momy one ounce and a half, pitch and
Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, break them all to peers, and lay it to steep
one day and a night in three ounces of vinegar and oil of Mastick: afterward
let them melt together, and temper therewith Mastick, Frankincense, fine Bolus,
Dragon blood, Gum, and Fenegreeke meal, of each three drag. and stir it long
together.

Item take Daisie flowers and roots, wild Tansie flowers and roots, Comfrey,
of each half an ounce, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Sloes
and Pomegranate flowers, of each half a dragme, Hares hair chopped small one
dragme, birdlime one ounce, pitch two ounces, Wax five dragmes, oil of Roses
as much as is needful, to make therewith a plaster. This salve following is
much in use: Take Pitch three ounces, red Wax, Butumen Iudaicum, Ammoniacum,
Galbanum and Turpentine, of each two ounces, Litharge of gold one ounce,
Henbane seed, Aloe and Mastick, of each three ounces, Gips or plaster, and
fine Bolus, of each three ounces and a half, both kinds of Aristology, of each
two ounces, Frankincense and Myrrh, of each two ounces and a half, prepared
Earth worms, Comfrey and Daisie roots, of each two ounces, fresh blood of a
heavy minded man six ounces, Isingals and Glue as much as is needful: the
Gums let steep three days in vinegar, afterward temper them with molten
pitch and wax: when it begins to be cold, then mingle the other things
beaten small amongst it: lastly put the blood thereto, and when it is well
mixed, pour it upon a stone, and work it very well with greasy hands, and
spread thereof upon leather, and lay it upon the rupture under the trusse.

Another. Take Iron dross five dragmes, Momy, Dragagant and Gum, of each three
drag. Frankincense, the juice of Sloes and Sandaraca, of each one dragme and a
half, Isinglas, Cipers nuts, of each one ounce, birdlime three ounces, Gips two
ounces, Rosin 18. ounces, make thereof a plaster with the juice of Celendine.

Item take Pitch one ounce, Litharge of gold, red and white wax, Jews lime,
Ammoniacum and Galbanum, of each one dragme and a half, Birdlime one ounce,
Turpentine washed with vinegar, both kinds of Aristology and Gals, of each two
ounces, and two scruples of Cipers nuts, Myrrh, Frankincense, of each one
quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus and Gips, of each one ounce, Mastick, Comfrey
and Daisie roots, of each one ounce, Dragon blood and Momy, of each half an
ounce, mingle them well together to a plaster. Another: Take the gum of
Cherries, dissolve it in Sallad oil, put thereto Mastick and Frankincense, of
each a like much, melt it, and boil it to a plaster.

Yet another. Take Gum, Dragagant, Masticke, fine Bolus, Dragon blood, Isinglas
and common Glue, of each one dragme, Frankincense one dragme and a half, Jews
lime half an ounce, Pitch and Momy, of each one dragme and a half, Tar one
quarter of an ounce. First melt the Pitch, then add the Glue and Tar, and
temper then the other things amongst it beaten small. When it is cold, then
anoint your hands with oil of Roses, and work well this salve.

This following is taken for a secret: Take Dragon blood half a dragme, Myrrh,
Sarcocolla, Opopanacum, Brimstone, Amber, Mastick and Comfrey, of each two
dragmes and a half, Myrtle seed, yellow Mirobalans, of each two dragmes, the
bark of Pineapples, and Cipers nuts, of each four scruples, four or five
garden Snailes out of their houses, Dragagant dissolved in red vinegar one
dragme* fish lime molten in vinegar also as much as is needful for to make the
foresaid things to a plaster: afterward dry it by a small fire.

Six hours after, drink three ounces of this water following: Take Comfrey
and Tormentil, of each one quarter of an ounce, Codwoort, Sengreene, Cinqfoile,
Mugwoort, and herb Trinity, of each two handfuls, Garyofillata, Verbascum, and
broad Plantaine, of each two drag. and a half, Roses, Horsetaile, of each half
a handful, cut and powne it gross, and put thereto red seething wine and Aqua
vitae, of each six ounces, or so much as wfl cover it well: let it so stand
fourteen hours: afterward strain it through, and wring it out, and make it
sweet with sirupe of Mirtles. But if so be that three ounces be too strong to
drink at once, then is he to take but one or two, and this potion may be
tempered with somewhat else.

A plaster called De pelle Arietina.
Hereafter follow three kinds of plasters De pelle Arietis, which is commended
above all other plasters as a certain remedy: Take pitch two ounces, Litharge
of silver, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Mastick, of each one ounce, white and red
wax, Jews lime, Aloe, and both Aristologies, of each one ounce and a half,
Birdlime, fine Bolus, of each three ounces, Gips, Myrrh, Frankincense,
Turpentine which is washed well in vinegar, prepared earth worms, Comfrey,
Sengreene, of each two ounces and a half, half a Rams skin made clean from
the hair and wool, and cut small, the blood of a red bearded young and healthful
man six ounces, prepare them al together as herafter follows: Take the cut
rams skin, let it sees to tough slime, then wring it out hard, and temper
amongst it common glue, and fish lime, or Isinglas, of each one ounce and a
half, afterward let it sees well together. You must dissolve the gum in
vinegar, and you must powne all that is dry: in like manner also the green
roots, herbs and earth worms to pa^ you must work the birdlime amongst the
blood till that it dry, and the plaster wax hard, then are you to preserve
this plaster in a glass stopped tight.

The second. Take Pitch, Wax, Jews lime, both the Aristologies, Earth worms,
prepared Turpentine and Aloe, of each one quarter of an ounce, Litharge of
gold, Ammoniacum, Opopanacum, Galbanum, Bdellium, Sagapenum, Mastick, Comfrey,
and Daisie roots, of each three drag. Birdlime, Bloudstones, Dragon blood,
Frankincense, Gips and Myrrh, of each three drag. man's blood three quarters of
an ounce, and the fourth part of a Rams skin, sees this to lime, and strain
it through, and dissolve the Gum therein, sees it all together, and mix the
rest amongst it.

The third. Take Pitch, Aloe, Henbane, Aristology, Behen, Saffron, and
Chickweed with red flowers, of each two ounces, white Wax and Jews lime, of
each one ounce and a half, Litharge of gold, Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Momy,
Opopanacum, Mastick, Cipers nuts, Dragon blood, of each one ounce, fine Bolus
three ounces and a half, Gips, Myrrh, Frankincense, Turpentine, of each two
ounces and a half, birdlime and man's blood, of each twelve ounces, temper these
with the glue or muscilage of a sheep skin and of sodden Hollihock rots. Many
have bin cured only herewith.

You have also before in the second part, the first Chapter, 1.. a plaster
which begins thus: Take Pitch hafe an ounce, etc. the which is also very
good for this purpose. But note, before that you lay the plaster upon the
rupture, rub it with water that is distilled out of a sheep skin when the
wool is off.

Item some other things more to lay thereon: Take the juice of Sloes, sees it
in water, and lay it on the rupture, and bath the same therewith: it heals
without cutting. For young children in steed of this plaster are pultises also
to be made, as herafter follows: Take meal of Lupins and burnt linen, of
each a like much, and make with wine a pap or pultis, and lay it between two
fine clothes upon the rupture.

A milder plaster for children. Take Beans as many as you please, and steep
them in warm water, peele them, and let them dry again: afterward stamp
them to powder, and take thereof two ounces, small filed Oken wood one ounce,
Comfrey sodden treatably in wine, and then stamped, three ounces: let all this
sees meetly thick, and spread it on a cloth, and lay it three times a day on
the rupture, and a nights but one time, and let it be well fastened with a
trusse: do this four or five weeks space until the rupture be cured, and the
skin pretty strong.

Another. Take Consolida Saracenica, Gariophilata, Plantain, Fennel, Sanicle,
broad Plantain and Paul's betony, of each one handful, chop all small, and let
the plaster sees until it be thick, then lay it on the rupture, and tie it as
behooves.

It has bin told before in the first Chapter how wonderful good this herb
Perfoliata is for all ruptures, which oftentimes has bin by experience found
and approved.

Here follow some salues. Take woman's milk 16. ounces, Badgers grease, Capons
grease, Hearts suet and Comfrey, of each two ounces, the innermost rind of a
Cherry tree cut small one ounce and a half; let it sees so long as a hard
egg, strain it hard through a cloth, and therewith anoint the rupture four
weeks long morning and evening: trusse up the rupture as behooves, and keep
the patient lying still on his back.

Badgers grease is also special good for all ruptures.

Hereafter are yet more sundry salues described, which are very good for this
kind of rupture, and some potions, whereof the first is before described,
beginning thus, Take Comfrey, etc.

Item take broad Plantain, Hounds tongue, of each half a handful, Comfrey,
Daisie roots, of each half an ounce, Myrtle seeds three drag. blossoms of
Pomegranats, Bay berries, a drag. and a half, Ladies mantle, Sanicle, Consolida
Saracenica, and Agrimony, of each one handful; sees them all together in wine
and water, of each one pint, unto the half, strain it, and put thereto sugar,
at each time one ounce.

Item take Sengreene, Consolida Saracenica, red Beets, herb Benet, Fennel,
Knotgrasse, and Paul's Betony, of each one handful; boil them all in wine, and
drink of it twice a day, but not at night. An old body must continue with it
twelve weeks, and a child six weeks. Some add unto it Ladies mantle and
Sanicle.

Item take the root of the long Consolida, one or twain, Consolida Saracenica
with the root, Hounds tongue with the root, of Paul's Betony, and roots of
Polipody, of each a like much; chop it very small, put it in a bag, and put
thereto three pints of wine, and distill it through a glassen helm, take
thereof in the morning early a good draught, at afternoon, and in the evening
when you go to bed again: yet at all times warm.

Some do make this potion yet stronger, and put half an ounce of Perfoliata
unto it, Watercresses one ounce and a half, Cicory roots one quarter of an
ounce, and a pint of red Wine.

Or take Comfrey, Consolida Saracenica, Auens, Ladymantle, of each a like much;
let it sees together with good wine in an earthen pot, and drink thereof
between meals.

Another. If so be that the Rupture be not yet a year and a half old, then
take two pints of small wine in an earthen pot, and put thereto Pirol^, S.
John's woort, and Strawbery leaves, of each one handful, stop the pot close and
let the same sees until the second part, and drink thereof morning and evening
meetly warm. This must also be continued two or three months space, till that
he be cured.

Now follow some Confections, and such like. Take Calmus and Comfrey, of each
one ounce, Solomon's seal roots, Horse tails, of each half an ounce, cut
them all small, and let them sees together in sower wine until it may be
stamped to pap, and then temper it amongst this powder following: Take Cipers

Sperage one ounce and a half, Numularia one ounce; temper them all well
together with honey and sugar as much as is needful, and take thereof every
evening and morning the quantity of a Walnut in wine.

Otherwise these things following are counseled much to be used: Valerian
every day one dragme taken in wine, Cressy seeds also in wine: but the same
must not be used oftentimes. Item Shepherds purse cut small and decocted in
wine. In like manner also the herb Cardopatium, To foment the Rupture also with
these things following, is very good: Take Daisie leaves with red flowers, and
Consolida Saracenica, of each a like much, Paul's Betony, Perfoliata, Pyrola,
and Watercresses, Hearts tongue, Cicory, Sanicle, wild Thyme, Cardopatium, and
the herb of the same, of each half so much, chop it small, and make thereof
two bags, sees them in water, and lay first one bag, and then another,
fomenting the Rupture every time six or seven hours long. After that, the
Rupture must be trussed again as before. This water may last good three days
long in the winter time.

Item take Rue, Agnus Castus, Marierom, and white Mints, of each one handful,
Annis seed, Fennel seed, Rue seed, and Siluermountaine, of each one dragme;
Cammomill, Melilot, of each two ounces; stamp it all together, and let it sees
in a quart of water until the third part be sodden away; foment therewith the
Rupture. This is also good for the Hernia Aquosa, the waterish Rupture, whereof
we will hereafter speak more at large.

Of the Ruptures that fall down into the Cods.. 2.
NOw we will speak of the breaches or ruptures that fall down into the Cods,
whereof the causes are diverse, as it stands here before declared in the
fourth. that they may therefore be helped by sundry remedies, shall hereafter
appear.

Of the Rupture through wind.. 3.
THe causes of this kind of Rupture may proceed of meats which are windy, as
certain pottages, milk, and all that is dressed with milk, all doughy meats
and unleavened bread, sweet Wine, brains and marrow of beasts. Such must
beware of cloudy air, and all moist dwellings, all heaviness of the mind, and
he must eschew sleep. Further, sodden fish, moist fruits, great riotting,
much exercise immediately after meals, continual use of all moist meats are
hurtful for this disease.

For to cure these Ruptures, it must be endeavored to drive out the winds, for
the which at the first this clister is very requisite: Take Comin, Annis,
Caraway, Fennel, and Ameos, of each one drag. Rue one handful and a half,
sees these together in a quart of water until the half, take twelve ounces
of this decoction, oil of Rue, of Bay, of each one ounce and a half, Indy
salt, and Sal gemmae, of each half a drag. Tho. sugar one ounce and a half,
make a clister thereof, and minister it once a day. Secondly, is the patient
every morning to take seven hours before meat one drag. of Mithridate with two
ounces of the water of Rue. This is a divine medicine to expel wind, and to
take away the occasions thereof.

There may a goodly be used outwardly, and to take thereof a pint, Sulphur vif
beaten two ounces, grains half an ounce, beaten grossly, this so sodden
together until the third part be sodden away: in this warm water wet a
sponge, and lay it five or six times a day upon the priuities.

Secondly, set often copper cups which have narrow mouths upon the belly. For
this is also good, all that expels wind.

Of the waterish Rupture Hernia Aquosa.. 4.
IF any where in the veins, in the pores, or in the liver or other parts, do
gather some water, which falls downwards, then must it at last fall into the
cods: but the Liver is always the most principal cause from whence all such
moistures have their beginning.

Therefore when as all such waterish Ruptures happen to any, it is quickly to be
discerned by the navel or cods, which immediately afterward do swell up, and
seem to be perspicuous, whereto these things following are to be used.

First of all the patient must be purged; for if such happen not often, the
matter of the sickness will not be carried out of the body. In like sort, if
there be not kept a good order of diet, and the water be not expelled, then
runs it again downwards toward the cods, whereby at length may be caused a
greater harm. And to purge all those humors, take this drink following: Take
Agaricus and Hermodactili, of each one drag. and a half, Ginger one scrup.
Ireos one drag. Honey water four ounces, then make the Honey water warm, and
let the foresaid things be steeped therein 24. hours, afterward wring it well
out, and drink it warm, and six hours afterward eat and drink warm
beer and bread upon it.

But if so be this drink through the bitterness thereof go against your
stomach, then take this ensuing, Electuarium Indium three drag. burnt copper
eight grains, water of blew Flower deluce two ounces, temper them all together
and drink it. Or take these pills: Take the root of Laureola, which has bin
steeped five days in vinegar, one scruple, Sulphur vif four grains, burnt
Copper two grains, Licorice, Annis and Dragagant, of each four grains, make
pills thereof with the juice of Roses, and take them all at one time.

There must also be given to this patient those things to ease and drink which
do move urine, whereof many are specified where we shall speak of the Dropsy
Ascite: but of these three things following, choose which likes you best.

Take red Pease about six ounces, two Fennel roots, let them sees well
together, and take five ounces of this decoction: or drink five ounces of
Broom water. Thirdly, take the water of Melilot, and water of Smallage, of
each two ounces and a half, Sugar as much as you please, and drink this a
whole week long.

A Confection to strengthen the Liver.
TAke Trociscos Diarrhodon, and Spec. Diacinamomi, of each one drag. burnt
Iuory one scrup. four ounces of white sugar; sees it with Fennel water, and
make tabulats of it: of these take one quarter of an ounce before meat. When
as then through the foresaid means the water be somewhat voided, then are
these plasters to be used: Take Masticke one ounce, Cipers nuts half an ounce,
Dragagant and Gum, of each one drag. temper these together unto a plaster with
oil of Roses. This stops, that there can no more water run unto it. Item
take Seseli, Comin, Cammomill and Melilot, of each one ounce; sees these
together in a quart of water until the third part be spent, and foment
therewith the Rupture. Then lay this plaster upon it bounden warm to it: Take
roots of blew Flowerdeluce, and roots of wild Cucumbers, of each three ounces,
Pease meal and Bean meal, of each two ounces, oil of Rue and juice of Bay
leaves, of each two ounces; let this sees till it be meetly thick, and so lay
it upon the ruptures, and bind it warm unto it. But if this cannot be made,
then use the first with Mastick and Cipers nuts.

The Apothecaries have also one in use, which they call Emplaistrum ad
Rupturas, which is also very good, and is thus to be made.

Take Nutmegs, the juice of Sloes, Gips, Comin, Annis, Rice, Pyrola, sower
Dates, Cipers nuts, Sanicle, of each one dragme and a half, fish lime or
Isinglasse, half an ounce, Bdellium two ounces: but dissolve the two last in
vinegar, and with the rest beaten small make a plaster of it.

Another. Take Bran twelve ounces, beat it very small, and let it run through
a seen, put amongst it two ounces of beaten Comin, make a plaster of it with
Oxymel. You may also sees it well with white wine unto a plaster. Item take
Lilly roots one ounce, Linseed meal one quarter of an ounce, Bean meal one
drag. Comin and wild Rape seed, of each one ounce, Sulphur vif one quarter of
an ounce, Cipers nuts one dragme, Bdellium molten in vinegar half an ounce:
beat all that is to be beaten, and let it sees to a plaster with white wine.
Item take Marioram, foment therewith the whole priuities, or anoint it with
the juice of Yarrow: take also oil of Pepper and of Saffron, of each a like
much, and therewith anoint the rupture.

But if so be that this waterish rupture be taken for a species of the Dropsy,
then must you look for more other plasters, which stand described in the
treatise of the Dropsy Ascite, and choose which you like best. But if the
water (which is so gathered together) must be let out, then are you after the
purgation to lay the foresaid plaster upon it, and open the cod, yet let not
the water run out all at once, and being run out, then lay drying plasters
upon it. It is also opened sundry ways, as with a hot iron, with a thread
thrust through it, also with a corosiue, and otherwise, which we commend to the
Chirurgians. But if so be that you be once cured, and that the same return
again, then is he to be ruled in all things, like as is from the beginning
hitherto prescribed.

Of the Rupture through Blood or Phlegma.. 5.
ALthough that out of all the humors of man's body, there be specially caused
four ruptures, yet notwithstanding is the same very seldom caused through
Cholera. In like manner also not often of blood, unless that such happens
through strokes, wounds falls, carriage, and through use of meats which make
much blood, that be very hot, moist, and sweet, and such like. These ruptures
do make show with notorious swellings, with heat, and many humors, which may
easily be known by their feeling, for at the last they will be red, and
beating or panting. The Liver or Median vein is to be opened of such a
patient, and four or five ounces of blood letten out, according to the
strength of the patient. And the next day must he purge with this potion
following: first, Decoctio fructuum.
must you make ready a decoction, which the Apothecaries do call Decoctio
fructuum, as follows.

Take figs and Prunes, of each fifteen, Iuiubes and Sebestes, of each twenty,
Hops a handful and a half, Endive, Purslaine and Cicory, of each half a
handful, peeled Melon seed, Pompeon seed, Cucumber seed, and peeled Gourd
seed, of each one dragme, sower Dates one ounce, Violets half an ounce; sees
these all together (except the Dates) and break them into this decoction, it
is very good for the breast, and cools naturally, take of it three ounces,
Rubarb two scruples, Spica four grains, conserve of Prunes half an ounce,
temper these well together, and drink it warm, and fast thereupon the space
of six hours. The same day lay upon the rupture six ounces of green
Nightshade, but if you cannot get it, then take dried Roses and broad
Plantaine, of each two ounces, Linseed sodden in vinegar, twelve ounces, barley
meal five ounces, oil of Roses four ounces; let all these sees together
unto a thick pap by a mild fire treatably, and then lay this upon it twice a
day. Item take water of Endive, Nightshade, barley water, and bean water, of
each a like much, temper amongst it a little saffron and oil of Roses, make it
wet in a cloth and lay it thereon. Or take Barley meal, Lentil meal, Bean
meal and Violets, of each a like much, temper these all together with the
juice of the herb of winter Cheries unto a plaster or salve, and use it as
above. But if so be that the pain of this accident will not stanch, then powne
Henbane amongst it. The third day must two cups be set behind on the buttocks,
and that at such time as the patient has least pain, letting them draw much
blood. His meats must be cooling and drying, as Veriuice, the juice of
Pomegranats, etc. His drink must be sower and thin wine. This is also to be
noted, that this kind of rupture is of that nature that it may be cured in
eight days.

But the rupture which is caused of phlegmatic humors, is much more common,
and they that gladly haunt strange women, are more subject to these ruptures.
Also all they that live riotously, eat hard meats, and have sat upon a cold
stone with their naked body, which may be known through the coldness of the
disease, when it begins to mollify, and when one does thrust his finger
into it, that the dent of the finger tarieth a good while in it, which in the
windy rupture nor in the water rupture happens not to be. Also the place is not
perspicuous, and the swelling remains at a stay. This disease is to be cured
with these purgations following: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger
one dragme, white sugar three dragmes, temper them together: of this must the
patient every fourth day take one dragme with Wormwood water, and between them
must he every morning take this potion: Take water of Balm, Betony and
Wormwood, of each one ounce and a half, Sugar half an ounce, Vinegar of
Squils one ounce, mix them together. Now for to strengthen the parts wherein
the phlegmatic humor ingendreth, it is very good every morning to take one
dragme of Treacle which is ten years old. This plaster following is also
marvelous good for to consume all such matter: Take Sandaraca two ounces,
Sarcocolla one ounce, ashes of Bean straw, or Vine stocks six ounces,
Vinegar of Squils two ounces, as much water as is needful: let these sees
together unto the thickness of a plaster, and lay it upon the sore as above.
Some do take in steed of common ashes, the ashes of Saponaria, which may be
well done.

Of the fleshie Rupture.. 6.
THis rupture may also engender of good blood, for that the nourishing
operation does works so vehemently therein, that the blood turns into flesh.
It may also be caused through great heat of the cods. When as then this
excrescence of the flesh does much increase, then will this member be much
feebled, and the new flesh which at the first was not hurtful, will be utterly
destroyed. This excrescence of flesh, or fleshy rupture, is first of all
known, for that therewith is no pain at all. The heat is to be known by the
redness of the place where the disease appears, and by the hardness it is
also known, for that it agrees with other flesh. Lastly, it is also to be
discerned and known by the speedy increasing, by reason that sometimes it will
be as big as ones head. The outward causes of the fleshy rupture are all that
ouerheate and ouermoisten, whereby the blood inflameth and will be fat, even as
all delicate meats, yolks of eggs, good fresh broth, sweet Wines, Dates, Sugar,
and all that is dressed therewith, and such like. For to remedy this, first the
Liver vein or the Median is to be opened, and that at several times, first
one, then another. Secondly, you must look to open the hemorrhoides in the
fundament, through continual rubbing it with Ox gall or with water wherein
Sulphur vif is decocted. Thirdly, through often applying great cups upon the
buttocks, hips, and other fleshy parts. He must eat no other meats than that
are cooling and drying, thereby to hinder the generation of the blood: for
which this plaster following is also to be laid thereupon: Take Lentil,
Nightshade, Roses, and broad Plantaine, of each six ounces, Barley meal twelve
ounces, three whites of eggs: sees these all together in sufficient vinegar,
and thrice as much water, then make thereof a plaster, and lay it upon the
whole cod five or six days one after an other.

Now when as this patient has purged, and done all that is prescribed, then is
this plaster following to be laid upon the rupture: Take Bolus two ounces,
sealed earth and starch, of each one drag. Mil dust one ounce and a half,
Sandaraca and Mastick, of each one quarter of an ounce, make a salve thereof
with the juice of Roses in a leaden mortar, and lay thereof twice a day over
the rupture.

Afterward use this corroding ointment: Take black Soap two ounces, Orpiment
one ounce and a half, Sulphur vif half an ounce, burnt Copperas one dragme
and a half, temper all together in a mortar with water wherein Sal Armoniack is
dissolved: lay this upon the lower part of the cod, about the breadth of a
groate, and let it lie therein about one hour, but no longer, so that it may
not bite in too deep. When there is any ulcer, then lay easy things thereon,
as Barrowes grease or butter until that the escarre fall off. When this is all
done, then take for this the salve of the Apostles: afterward are you to lay
this biting salve again upon another place of the cod, so that it may be
opened in six or eight places, yet so, that one may commodiously come to it
with the foresaid things. When you then see that such excrescens be consumed,
which may be discerned and known hereby, that the cod is come to his wonted
bigness again, the which sometimes happens to endure half a year before it
come thereto, then must you proceed with incarnatiues, which things require an
expert and patient Chirurgian.

Of the Rupture which is caused of broken veins, called Varicosa.. 7.
HEreof we have in the beginning of the 4.. made mention, how that it is none
other but an intumefaction of the veins through blood, for in the cods are
many veins that compass them all about.

This tumor or rupture proceeds of melancholic blood, to which do help
sorrow, vexation of the mind, many fantasies, and gross meats, whereof the
melancholik blood is engendered: like as also of gross red wine, salt flesh,
pottage of Beans and Lentils, and all that is dressed with sharp vinegar.

Such a patient is to rule himself no otherwise then is taught in the fleshy
rupture, but that he must not use any of the corroding salve, but in steed
thereof use the plasters De Muscilaginibus, and especially those that be made
with Opopanaco, Serapino, Bdellio and Ammoniaco. For this is also good bathes
which are Sulphurish, Copperish, and warm by nature. And (to speak the truth)
this species of rupture is not to be helped but with great pains, and
continuance of time.

Of the terrible Rupture, called Buris.. 8.
THis rupture comes also through melancholic blood, which not only falls
down into the cods, but also infecteth them wholly, so that beyond all measure
it comes thereby to swell, yea will be black and cold, and sometimes without
any vlceration. But if so be that there come unto it any hard swellings, which
afterward break out and yield much matter, then may the same be well taken for
Elephantiasis: yet if so be that the swelling be not so big, and has
nevertheless the foresaid signs, then is it to be taken for the right Hernia
Oscenae, which some do call Ossealis, which altogether descends into the
cods. This disease will be cured like other hard swellings, or as hereafter
follows.

Take bean meal three ounces, Cammomill, muscilage of Hollihocke roots,
Annise seed, Fenegreeke seed, and Raisins without stones, of each half an
ounce; temper them with yolks of eggs. These things following are good for
plasters; as Cumin, Nightshade, Bean meal, Cammomil, Melilot, oil of
Lillies, Cow dung, crumbs of Rye bread, and more other things aforesaid. But if
so be that the hardness will not wear away, but inclines to maturation, then
must the same be opened and healed as other impostumations.

The plaster Diachilon is good to be used at the first, and the gum Ammoniacum
by it self; for that they either consume or maturate the swelling in short
space. There is also good for this Bean meal, Fenegreeke meal, Lilly roots,
Colewoort leaves, and figs, as much as you please, sodden together, and then
powned, and so laid upon the grief. Also this rupture is to be oftentimes
anointed with the oil of Cammomill, Lillies and Spike, and chiefly when there
is no special heat therein.

It is also to be noted, that it is not good, if it be known that the Cod is
full of matter or corruption, to leave the same long therein, lest that the
testicles thereby might also spoil and putrify. For this is this rule to be
observed, to the end that in time the melancholic humors might be drawn out
and purged away; to wit, to open the Liver vein on the left side. The next day
must he take half an ounce of Catharticum Imperiale, with Violet or Waterlilly
water. Now for to cause the matter to discuss and consume, take six or eight
days one after another these potions following: Take Violet water, Lettice
water, and Hop water, of each one ounce, sirupe of Citron pills one ounce and a
half: take this warm early in the morning.

Of the Ruptures whereby the Bowels do fall into the Cods.. 9.
THe eight and last sort of ruptures is here above mentioned in the title. The
descending of the bowels or rim, is oftentimes very suddenly, and otherwhiles
very slowly. But howsoever the same come, yet for all that can it not be
without pain, and chiefly if it be touched: the inward causes are none other
then wind which clearly appears hereby; if the patient hold up his breath
long, the rupture will be the greater, and in breathing out the smaller. The
outward causes are sufficiently expressed in the treatise of the Ruptures of
wind, and of the Navel.

For to help this disease, before all things diligence must be had, that the
bowels which are descended may be brought again into their place. And for to
compass this, take hold on the cods underneath, and treatably thrust it up.
Take also a great boxing cup, set it above the priuities or hard by, and let it
draw a good space. The patient must also lie higher with his buttockes than his
body, that the bowels thereby the easier may return into their due places. If
there be any great pain approaching, then first of all look to swage the same,
and chiefly with clisters, which are thus to be made; to wit, the decoction
wherein Linseed, Fenegreeke, and white Sesamum seeds beaten grossly have been
boiled, and therewith butter and oil of Violets be mixed. Item, take Hens and
Cocks broth, and oil of Sesamum, of each six ounces, Sal gemmae half an
ounce, or a little less; temper them together, and minister this Clister
meetly warm.

Another. Take twelve ounces of sweet Wine, fresh butter, and oil of sweet
Almonds, of each two ounces, Benedicta lax. half an ounce; temper them all
together for a clister.

Further, the whole Cods with all parts that are adjoining are to be well
fomented or bathed. What waters are to be taken for it, you have them set down
before in the end of the first. beginning thus, Take Rue, etc. Yet another in
the fourth. beginning thus, Take Se^eli or Silver mountain seed, etc. In one
of these warm decoctions wet a great sponge, and lay it over all the
priuities: which being done, then let the rupture be softly shooued back.
Afterward must you lay this plaster following over it, and bind it as hard as
may be abidden and suffered.

Take Cipers roots two ounces, Mill dust three ounces, Comfrey and Daisie
roots, of each one ounce, fish lime or Isinglas, one ounce and a half,
Dragagant, Gum, Momy, and burnt Iuory, of each half an ounce Dragon blood,
Sagapenum, Sealed earth, and fine Bolus, of each five dragmes: the meal and
powned roots shall you sees in two third parts of water, and one third part
of red vinegar, until it be thick enough; then mix molten Wax amongst it as
much as is needful, stir it with dissolved Gum well together until it be
cold. You have also before in the discourse of the Navel and upper Rupture,
many good plasters which are good for this use.

But if so be that the rupture be large, and all that is fallen down be much,
then lay the plaster thereon which is described in the treatise of the upper
rupture, in the beginning of the 1.. for it is singular good also for this kind
of rupture. Make a plaster thereof after the form of a shield, whereof the
narrowest end may pass under the cods between the legs, and the broad end
over the whole cods: this being done, then put thereon an accustomed trusse.

Lastly, heed must be taken to cure and strengthen the place of the rupture
where the bowels come through: for the which this following is very commodious.

Take iron dross which is sodden in vinegar and Myrrh, of each half an
ounce, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, Frankincense, Mastick, Sealed earth, and the
juice of Sloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cipers nuts and Momy, of each
three quarters of an ounce, Isinglas two ounces, temper them al together with
Wax and Rosin as much as is needful for a salve, and therewith anoint the Cods
thrice a day, and knit it up with the trusse as is usual. If the rupture be
not too wide and too old, then may it be well cured therewith in ^orty or
threescore days.

Of the Ruptures of Children.. 10.
THe young children are subject to the foresaid ruptures of wind and water, more
than aged folk, and are also to be cured with the foresaid remedies.
Concerning the upper rupture of children, especial mention is made in the
fifth. But as in the beginning of this description we have said that children
and tender bodies are to be dealt withal more milder and subtiller than with
aged folks, therefore is the same to be had in mind.

For the first, these are as much as is possible to be defended and kept from
crying, and to be let lie with stretched out legs, and after the first binding
not to unbind it in ten days. If the rupture as then be not yet cured, then is
the rupture the second and third times to be trussed, for that by the first
trusse they heal not thoroughly, but all after as they be still or unruly. But
if the children be so small that they suck still; then must the mother or the
nurse keep a good diet in eating and drinking of dry meats: and they must
eschew all meats which be moist of nature.

For to keep up the Matter that it descend no more.. 11.
FOr this purpose are good the last mentioned clisters, the binding and rubbing
of the knees downwards, the setting up of boxing cups on the buttocks vnpickt,
the opening of the liver vein or Median, wherewith also according to the
importance of the cause, remedies must be used through vomits, whereby the
matter that falls out of the head will be diuerted: for all ruptures are much
subject to the defluxion of humors, and especially the great ruptures. Lastly,
it is very necessary that women do further their Flowers or Terms; and for
men, the Hemorrhoides or Piles.

For to stay the reuersion of the Rupture that it come not again.. 12.
THis must be effected through such things as expel wind and phlegmatic
matters, whereof is sufficient store declared, and chiefly that which has
Turbith in it, in the 5.. If you had rather have pills, then take Coloquint one
scruple, Turbith one dragme, Bdellium one dragme, and Ginger one scruple; make
thereof twelve pills with Hiera logodion, whereof the patient is to take three
in the morning early, and thereupon drink one ounce of the water of blew
Flower de luce meetly warm and sugared. This medicine is good for all
phlegmatic diseases. This foresaid matter will be expelled through these things
following by urine: Take water of Broom, Madder, and Smallage, of each one
ounce and a half, temper it, and drink thereof about half an ounce at a
time: and immediately afterward take three pills of powned Millium solis seed,
mixed with the juice of Smallage: or take one dragme of beaten Lignum Aloes,
with Honey water. Also you may use twice a week one dragme of Mithridate,
tempered with Mint water.

Thirdly there is a strong confection discovered, made by Nicholaus, by the
name of Opopyra, which has a special operation to dry up the flegmaticke
humors. And if you desire to make the same, then are you to use the advice of
an expert Physician, for it is very hot. There are also simples, which be very
necessary for to stay the bowels after the first curing from falling down into
the cods any more: whereof, the first are Cipers nuts, when they are green to
confect them with sirupe of Roses, whereof one is to be taken three or four
hours before meat, and that continuing two or three months long. Secondly,
after the same manner shall be confected Pineapples (the kernels being taken
out) and use them in like manner. Thirdly, take one dragme of Momy, and make
therewith twelve pills with the juice of Roses, and take thereof always three
hours before meat, one, two, or three months space together. Fourthly, you
are to swallow every morning threee or four pieces of Masticke, and continue
it three or four months: it is the most surest. Fifthly, you are four hours
before meat to take a root of Consolida media. Sixthly, the powder of Cipers
nuts is to be used in all meats. Seventhly, there must be worn a plate of
filed iron upon the rupture. Eighthly, the patient is to sit oftentimes in an
Alum bath, which is very sure to prevent the recediue of all such accidents.

For this may be prepared these confections following: Take Frankincense,
Mastick, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, of each one dragme and a half, Roses,
burnt Iuory, parched Comin, Dill seed, of each one dragme, Cipers nuts half an
ounce, small filed Steel, Iron dross, decocted together in red vinegar, of
each one quarter of an ounce, dried seeds of Pomegranates one ounce; beat them
all small together: Honey of Roses eighteen ounces, white Sugar twelve ounces,
Granado wine six ounces, Dragagant, Gum, of each half an ounce; sees both of
these gums with Honey, Sugar, and this juice until it be thick. When it
begins to be cold, put it into a mortar, and temper the other things amongst
it, stirring it well about, and give the sick body thereof two dragmes in the
morning two hours before meat: also two hours after supper one dragme. With
this have many been cured.

The order of life or diet.. 13.
EVen as all diseases in the world have need of a good diet, so has this
malady most of all need of it: but if the patient do not govern himself in
this sickness as it behooves, then are all medicines of none effect, but in
vain.

For this is first required to keep himself as quiet as is possible, and to ly
upon his back. The patient is also forbidden all cold and moist places, carnal
copulation, much stirring after meat. To ouercharge himself with meat and
drink is also very hurtful unto him, all strong drinks, and chiefly Must or
new wine is forbidden him. All meats that are binding, as sad baked bread, and
all that is made of meal and dough must he forbear. Of all sorts of pottages,
there are none more hurtful than Beans, Turkey beans, and Lentils:
contrariwise, he may eat well smoke dried flesh, and all kinds of fish: but new
milk, and all that is made thereof, is hurtful for him. Item butter; and all
cold and moist herbs must he forbear, as Spinach, Lettice, Beets, Mallows,
Purslaine, etc. unless they be mingled with some warm herbs, as Rosemary,
Mints, Thyme, Marioram, and such like. Meats that are good for him, are well
leauened bread not above three days old, Brewesse of fresh flesh broth, rear
Eggs, Veale, Mutton, Porke, Hares: Item Capons, Hens, Phesants, Partridges,
Ducks, Doves, and all other field fowls. All fish fried in oil, and salt fish
may he use otherwhiles, etc. Hard salt Cheese is also sometimes permitted. All
sorts of Turnips, Olives and Capers may he also use. All manner of spice may he
eat dressed with his meat. Also Annis seed, fennel seed, Comin, and such like.
All manner of sower things in his meats cannot hurt him, as Vinegar, Veriuice,
Limons, Orenges, and such like. For his drink shall be good clear wine or
beer. But if the patient can neither drink wine nor beer, then is he to use
this Meade following.

Take Rosemary half an ounce, Cinnamom half a dragme, Balm flowers, Ginger,
Borrage, Nutmegs, of each half a dragme: sees these together in seven quarts
of water until the fourth part be sodden away: afterward put thereto sixteen
ounces of honey, let it sees again until the third part be consumed.

This drink is special good in the winter, and if the same be not continually
used, yet may the wine be delayed with it.

This order is as well directed for flegmaticke humors, as for the cause
whereof this rupture has his being. And if the same be caused of Cholera and
blood, we have thereof discoursed before.

The Chirurgions have two other means to heal the Rupture, which is, by
incision, and with cautarisation, whereof we are not purposed to write.

The fourth Chapter. Of the Testicles or Stones.
SOme do name both these parts, the priuities: which name does signify more
than the stones only of men or women, for that it is thought to be too gross
a term, the stones: but if the matter b^ honest which is spoken of them, then
can the true name of them not be shameful nor dishonest. Both these small
parts of a man's body were once fashioned thereto by God and nature (like as is
discovered) whereby to continue mankind: for which cause they are by good
reason accounted amongst the principallest parts of man's body. For how greatly
mankind is depending thereon, it is to be seen by such whose stones be cut out,
who have no beards growing, do lose their man's voice and natural heat, yea
are wholly unfit for generation: In fine, do almost alter wholly into the nature
of women, we may therefore with good reason write thereof.

Men and women have both of them two of these stones, therefore do the Grecians
call them Didymi, which is, Twins or Twilings. In men they hang outwardly out
of the body in the abouesaid cods, and are of a fast fleshy substance, round
and somewhat long, inwardly hollowish, wherein they receive the purest and
cleanest blood of the whole body: and for that they be hot and moist, they
prepare that for the full perfection of the seed. Women have the stones inward,
on each side of the neck of the Mother one: but they are much less than the
stones of a man, and also of another fashion. It is also adjudged, that the
right stone is hotter of nature than the left; therefore the right also (is
said) will engender a son, and the left a daughter. It is found by experience,
if a man have one stone cut out, yet may he engender children: likewise they
that have three stones are very unchaste of life. Of the diseases which these
members of the body are subject unto, is sufficiently discoursed in the
treatise of the Cods: for there can hardly come any infirmity to the cods,
wherein they do not suffer with them, whether they chance to swell through
wind, or any other humor. But chiefly young children get lightly such diseases:
for which you have this plaster following for to use, as well for young as for
aged folks: Take Lilly roots four ounces, Linseed meal, Bean meal, half
an ounce, yellow wild Rape seed half an ounce, Sulphur vife one dragme, make a
plaster thereof. But before you lay on the plaster, anoint the place with
oil of Pepper and Saffron, of each half an ounce, temper them, and use it
warm.

Another plaster. Take small beaten Annis seeds, temper them with well brayed
whites of eggs, and lay warm upon it. This is approved and found good.

The fifth Chapter. Of VVomens privy Members.
THe Priuities of women make outwardly a small show, but within are much like
to the privy members of a man. The neck of the Mother or Womb is in steed of
the Yard: the Mother or Womb is compared with the Cods, where on the neck of
the same (like as is said) the stones are fixed: so that with good reason may
be said, That whatsoever men have outwardly, the same have women inwardly: but
for honesties sake we will write no further of it. But as much as concerns
the inward parts thereof, and all that appertains thereto, shall be
discovered hereafter: here shall only be touched certain diseases which these
parts are subject to. For which, first of all the common advise of women is
against all pain of these parts, be it of whatsoever cause that the same
proceed, to wit, that Betony be laid to steep in Wine, and to drink thereof.

Of the inflammation of the place with swellings.. 1.
TAke the whites of Eggs, and bray them with a long piece of Allume a good
space, then will it be a salve; spread it upon a cloth, and so apply it, and
when it is dry refresh it: this has been many times approved and found
certain. Item take of the white of an egg half a nutshell full, and Sallad
oil, stir them well together, and therewith anoint the hot burnt place. Or
take the green and yellow bark of Elderne sticks, put them in a little bag,
boil them in wine, and lay them warm thereon; it drives away all swelling, as
well that which is caused of childbirth, as otherwise.

Item, take for the hot swelling of women's privy places, Consolida Saracenica,
Auens, and Ladies mantle, as much as you please: powne them all together, and
wring out the juice, temper it with molten Capons grease and fresh butter,
anoint the place therewith between day and night four times at the least.

Of the Clefts of this place.. 2.
THe Grecians do call these clefts Rhagades, and are such clefts as discover
themselves with excrescence of flesh, which for the most part stands always
inward, and bleedth not of it self, unless they be rubbed hard with the
member of a man, which proceeds of inward and outward causes. The outward
causes may be falls, strokes, or bigness of a man's member: Also through putting
in any sharp thing, as Gith seed, and such like. The inward occasions are, when
as any inward swelling happens through descent of some sharp humor which there
seeks issue; and (to tell the truth) this is very hardly to be healed,
especially when all such diseases do stand deep in the neck of the mother. But
these clefts are to be healed with the same remedies which shortly hereafter in
the treatise of the Arsgut shall be described, yet if there be no Ague nor
sharpnes present, then may these pessaries following be used.

Take Ducks grease, and the marrow of a Stags bone, of each half an ounce,
Saffron one scruple, oil of Lillies and of white Daffodill, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Wax as much as is needful, wherewith to frame pessaries.
These pessaries must be put up into the place, yet bounden at a thread, they
draw the clefts together. Item take Frankincense and Hypocistis, of each half
a dragme, Aloe half a scruple, Dragon blood three dragmes, the juice of Sloes
one dragme, dried Ass dung one ounce, dried Mints a scruple, burnt Egshels one
dragme and a half, three whites of Eggs, burnt paper two scruples, three ounces
of the juice of broad Plantain, Vinegar one quarter of an ounce, temper them
all together: it is especial good for all clefts of the whole body. But if so
be that there be any heat or sharpness therewith, then is oil of Roses to be
used for it, and the pessaries must be anointed with this white unguent: or
make a pessary of Cotton, steeped in Rose water or Plantaine water. But if the
heat thereof be great, take the juice of Purslaine, muscilage of Fleawort, and
juice of Housleeke: work this the space of certain hours in a leaden mortar,
and temper a little oil of Roses amongst it: this heals and cools. It is
also very good against the Canker of the Mother, and such like diseases. Item
take Dragagant and Gum, dissolved in Rose water, washed Aloe, Ceruse,
Frankincense, and Dragon blood, of each one dragme, litharge of Gold half an
ounce, oil of Roses two ounces, wax as much as is needful; stamp all that is
to be stamped, and make a salve of it.

Also this hereafter following may with a Siring be squirted into the place:
Take washed white bread, Frankincense, Bolus, and Dragon blood, of each one
ounce, powne it, and sees it in four ounces of Goats milk unto the half,
then strain it through a cloth, and use it as has been said.

Of the Vlceration in the priuities of Women.. 3.
ALL that is ordained herebefore for the clefts, is also good for all
vlcerations of the priuities in women: so is also in like manner that which
follows hereafter: Take fresh butter, Badgers grease, and Deeres suet, of
each one ounce, the marrow of a young Steer half an ounce, five beaten yolks
of Eggs; temper them all together over a mild fire, and stir it continually:
when as it is almost cold, then put thereto Violets, Cammomill, and Roses, of
each one ounce, oil of Olives one ounce and a half: let this sees softly one
quarter of an hour, stirring it always about: afterward strain it through a
cloth. Item take Barrowes grease wherein Dill has bin fried, May butter, and
Hearts suet, of each two ounces, Sallad oil one ounce and a half, the marrow of
a young Steer, and Roses, of each one ounce, Violets, Cammomill, of each one
dragme and a half, six yolks of eggs well beaten, temper it as before: you
may put thereto a little Beuercod, this is, the elder, the better. For a
general rule note, that whereas any vlceration or clefts do show themselves
outwardly, that for the same these foresaid remedies are commodious: if so be
that they stand deep in the neck of the Mother, then use the foresaid
pessaries, and thrust them in deep enough, for which cause the pessaries must
be reasonable long. Also for all swellings and exulcerations use the oil of
white Daffodill, for it is very much approved for it.

When any body catches any sore through carnal copulation.. 4.
THis is to be understood of any sore which commonly comes through copulation
or venery. For this you shall take Calves suet, letting it melt treatably upon
hot coals, then temper therewith the marrow of an Ox: when it is molten, let
it be cold: when you will use this, then take a little of it and anoint the
sore therewith. But if it happened that one have his ordure to come forth before,
then take a small Tunnell, and stick it into the fundament, like as it were a
Clister pipe, then pour therein the molten fat, but not too hot. The patient
must also keep in his breath, and afterward pluck out the Tunnell, and so
stop the fundament with Cotton, that the same fat might not run out again. And
two or three days after he must bathe in warm water, or foment with a bag
that is filled with Oken leaves, Plantaine and Roses, and is decocted in water.

For to make a Woman to be as narrow as a Maiden.. 5.
TAke Consolida Saracenica, Plantaine, red Roses, and Shepherds purse, of each
a like much, and chop them small: when you have two handfuls of them, then take
a pound of May butter; melt it, and put thereto the said herbs: then let all
sees softly together half an hour long; afterward strain it through a
cloth, and therewith anoint the place. Item take Coperas and let it dissolve
in well water, wet a cloth therein, and lay it in the place; but it must
otherwhiles be refreshed. If then one be troubled with the Crablice, look the
first part, in the third Capter, in the 8.. where is sufficiently written of
Lice.

For to speak then more at large of this matter, and to declare (like as is
said already) how much imports mankind in the soundness and health of these
parts of generation, therefore we will first speak of the Spermaticall flux
or running of the raines, be it by day or night: afterward of the
impossibility of the veneriall act: Thirdly, of the barrenness both of man and
woman, and how to redress it. Fourthly, what belongs to the Secundina or
Skin wherein the child is wrapped, we will show hereafter.

The sixth Chapter. Of the Spermaticall Flux or running of the Raines.
THe Grecians do call this infirmity Gonorrhaeam, which is, when one against
his will, without the erection of the Yard has his seed running out, through
the loss of his strength and unnatural heat. This is caused through the
feebleness of the virtue retentiue, which is in the instruments of the seed,
which may happen through any ouercoldnesse, be it by sitting on cold stones, or
otherwise. It is else daily seen, if any bear this mischief too long, that
he waxes lean thereby, and falls away. And it is also no wonder, that by
reason of this flux of the seed which sometimes ten yea twenty times happens
between day and night, that thereby the best nourishment of the body is
withdrawn. If so be then that this Spermaticall flux is caused through
weakness of the retentiue virtue, then happens it without feeling: or if it
happen through the force of the virtue expulsive, which is known before by
certain impotency and trouble of these parts. But if the same grow through
outward accidents, that must be understood of the patient. And to cure this
infirmity, first it is to be known, that albeit this disease proceeds for
the most part through heat, yet notwithstanding the same may be caused through
cold, therefore we will here first write of the running of the Raines which
comes through heat.

Of the Flux of seed, or running of the Raines through heat.. 1.
THis flux of seed, is (as it has bin said) felt with some grief. All cold
things are acceptable to the patient, and hot things do put him to pain, as to
a man which is superabounding in seed, does this flux of Sperme bring not any
feeblenes, and he waxes not thereby lean at all: but if such come through
heat of the seed, then feels he also heat, itching and grief: this must
first of all be begun with a good order of diet. And first he must choose for
his dwelling a place and air which is neither too hot nor too cold, neither
too moist nor too dry. It is also not convenient for him to stir or go much,
neither to ride: but rest and sleep is highly commended for this infirmity,
and not too long, but a little, and that oftener. Deep speculations, sorrow,
vexation, fright, fear, and especially all veneriall thoughts must he eschew.
All purgations, and that which abateth the body are very hurtful: and if need
require, the same is easily to be effected through vomits, sweates, and
Clisters.

For vomiting, take water (wherein Radishes have been sodden) three ounces,
sirupe of Vinegar one ounce and a half, give the patient this warm, after
that he has eaten sundry meats.

For to provoke sweat, take Barley water three ounces, strong Wine two ounces,
give it him very warm, and let him sweat. The clister must be thus prepared:
Take Beets, Violet leaves, Nightshade, Tassell leaves, of each one handful,
let them sees well together, and take twelve ounces of this decoction, Tho.
sugar one ounce and a half, yolks of Eggs, oil of water Lillies, and of
Roses, of each two ounces, salt one dragme and a half: the clister must be set
in the evening before meat.

In eating and drinking must be eschued all that nourish well, except there be
great feeblenes approaching, whereof ought most of al to be advised. Also he
must eschew all that provoke venenery, as all sharp hot meats, spices, fat
and windy meats: but much rather may he use all that are contrary to these, as
water wherein Lentils are sodden, and Waterlillies tempered in all his meats
and drinks: also conserues of the same. Prepared Coriander is also good, be it
of what manner soever they be eaten. These things have a special property to
expel incontinency. In like sort also Purslaine, Endive, Cicory, and Lettice.
But Lettice seed excels all these, if one eat much thereof: it stays also
exceedingly and speedily the running of the Raines. Item, oil Olive and
Nightshade, are very good for this. All these foresaid things is such a patient
to use continually, meetly sower vinegar, Oranges, and the juice of Pomegranats
may he also use otherwhiles, and herewith eat sheep feet, and other beasts
feet. Fish that are taken in fresh waters, are also good for him, with vinegar
and other sower things, and dressed with sallad oil. All sea fish shall he
forbear. Concerning flesh, there is good all kind of Venison, water Fowls,
and in fine, the flesh of all Deeres that be not fat, but in good plight. For
his drink must he have red clear and pleasant Wines, and if he desire to have
them watered, then take thereto water wherein Coriander, Lettice, Purslaine,
(and that which is yet better) Gum of Araby, and dried Waterlilly flowers have
been decocted.

And that we forget not the venerious and lusty women, it is specially advised,
that for them shall be made a potion of the juice of Betony and Cicory tempered
together with vinegar. Item, yet more against concupiscence of man and woman
that are hot of nature, may plasters be made: Take Henbane, Opium, Camfere,
the muscilage of Fleawoort, Purslaine seed, and oil of Poppy seed, make a
plaster thereof, and anoint or lay it upon the kidneyes. Yet must this
plaster by reason of the extreme coldness be used prouidently. Also to go bare
footed is good likewise for this: and they that be full of blood are to be let
blood.

These things following do much dry the natural seed, to wit, Rue, and Agnus
castus, wild Mints, Comin, and morsels made thereof. But chiefly if one do take
the seeds of the premises with vinegar. Item take Dill seed three dragmes,
Lettice seed, and Purslaine seed, of each half an ounce; drink thereof every
time one dragme and a half with the water of Lentils. Item take Rue seed and
Henbane seed, of each one quarter of an ounce, Roses and flowers of Pomegranats
of each three dragmes: make thereof a powder, and give thereof to drink one
quarter of an ounce at one time with water or watered wine. But to return to
the leesing of the Sperme, it is not amiss to write what is inwardly to be
used for it. First then shall this confection following be necessary for it:
Take Comfrey roots three ounces, cleanse them and cut them small, pilled
Pompeon seed and Waterlillies, of each one dragme, the juice of Licorice two
scruples, prepared Coral, fine Bolus, Myrtle seed and Roses, of each ten
grains, Gum half a dragme; beat them all small (except the roots) and make
thereof a powder: sees the roots in red Wine, and stamp them to grout; then
temper the powder amongst it, and put thereto the sirupe of Citron pills and of
Orenges, as much as you please, and then let it sees together again to a
confection. Take every morning one spoonful thereof before breakfast.

Item, temper the Conserues of Roses with Marmalade, as much as you will: or
take either apart.

Another. Take prepared Bolus one quarter of an ounce, Conserues of Roses three
quarters of an ounce, temper and use thereof every time one dragme. Or take a
whole new laid egg sodden and sugared.

A famous Sirupe for heat.
TAke Purslaine seed, Lettice seed, and Waterlillies, of each one ounce,
prepared Coriander, roots of Waterlillies, of Dandelion, and of Nightshade, of
each half an ounce, Camfere half a dragme, or fifteen Iuiubes, Dates (eight
days steeped in vinegar and chopped small) two ounces, Rue seeds, mountain
mints, and parched Comin, of each one dragme; sees these all together in two
quarts of water unto the half, then strain it through, being very hard wroong
out, put more thereto, twelve ounces of the juice of Quinces, Sugar six and
thirty ounces, and let them sees all together, and clarify them. Lastly, cast
a little Mints into it, whereof shall be taken two ounces with three ounces of
Purslaine water, it is very precious and approved.

For this is also good these sirupes following: as De succo Endiuiae, de
Cydonijs, de Rosis siccis, Rosatus solutiuus, and Mirtinus. It has been also
said before, that for this disease no purgations are fit. But if such were most
needful, then is there to be given him one ounce, or one ounce and a half of
fine Cassia with Purslaine water. Another which is stronger: Take Cassia one
ounce, and De succo Rosarum one quarter of an ounce, beaten seeds of Agnus
castus one scruple, Waterlillies three ounces; temper them all together. Also
there is to be given him one ounce, or one ounce and a half of Cassia with
honey or milk. Afterward take every morning a draught of well decocted barley
water, and temper therewith (according as the heat is great) a spoonful or
twain of the juice of Housleeke, or Purslaine, for it cools much. Item take
one ounce, or one ounce and a half of Cassia, strew it with the powder of
Licorice, and swallow it down in the morning fasting. Item use fourteen days
continually in the morning early a little Cassia out of the pipes, and spet out
the kernels.

A Confection that is very fit for this. Take prepared Coriander one quarter of
an ounce, powder of Mints three dragmes, Lettice, Purslaine, and pilled
Cucumber seed, of each two dragmes and a half, Gum, Comin, (both parched) of
each one dragme, parched Dragagant one dragme and a half, Waterlillies one
quarter of an ounce, all these beaten small together. Sugar fifteen ounces,
and sees the Sugar in Purslaine water, and then make Tabulates of it.

Hereafter follow Potions. Take Comfrey roots and sees them in water, drink
thereof three or four ounces with Sugar: it is very fit for this disease.
Item, steeled water (wherein Myrtle seed has been decocted) being drunken, is
also very good. For this is also meet Plantaine water, Sorrel water,
Purslaine water, and Cicorie water. Or take Mallows and Hollihocke roots,
boil them in water, and drink of it. Or take of the Trocisci de Carabe, de
terra Sigillata, and de Spodio, which you will, or of each half a dragme: for
the whole Dose mix it with whay, and so drink it.

What ought to be used outwardly.
IF so be that this infirmity have long continued, then make Smiths Sinders
glowing hot, and slake them in wine, and bath therwithall. You must fill ye
Nauel with Stags suet, which stays the affluxion of the heat and sharpness
of the matter. If the patient then desire to make water, the^ must the patient
hang his priuities in Pla^taine water or Nightshade water.

Item, take old oil of Roses two ounces, oil of Quinces and Mirtles, of each
two ounces and a half, Burnt Lead, white Lead, Bloudstone (both washed in
Lettice water) of each half an ounce, Starch one ounce and a half, Willow
leaves and water Lilly flowers, of each five dragmes, Camfere one quarter of
an ounce: mix one with another in a leaden mortar with the juice of Plantaine,
and make also a salve thereof. For this disease shall you find many remedies
both in the ancient and later Physicians. The cooling salve is also very
commodious for this; like as is the ointment of Saunders Vnguentum Sandalinum,
Vnguentum Sandalinum:
which is made in this manner. Take Roses three dragmes, red Saunders two
dragmes and a half, yellow Saunders one dragme and a half, fine Bolus one
quarter of an ounce, burnt Iuorie one drag. Camfere half a dragme, white Wax
one ounce, oil of Rose buds three ounces: the Wax and the oil are to be
molten together, and then temper the other things amongst them. This is not
only good for this disease, but also for inflamed Kidneies, and to cool the
liver, the stomach, and all other parts. With any of both these ointments
annoint the patients Kidneies and the Cods, even to the end of his Yard. Item,
take oil of Mirtles, Roses, Masticke, of each half a dragme, shaven Iuorie
one scruple, Camfere two grains: powne all that is to be powned, and with a
little Wax make thereof a salve, wherewith annoint the Kidneies. This salve is
also good for the whites in women. Women's whites.
It is also much commended to wear upon the Kidneies a piece of thin beaten
Lead.

Of the Flux of Sperme, or the running of Reins through cold.. 2.
IN this infirmity is felt with the pain in the head, a distemperance also of
the brains, and a vexation af the whole body with cold, eue^ as in Mania. For
this be especially Mints very meet Rue also, and the seed thereof be highly
commended for the same, mountain Mints, Agnus Castus, Artichockes with the
roots, parched Comin, and Caruway, Annis, Frankincense, and their barks,
Masticke and Marierom. This patient must then prouidently (as is said) and
mildly purge, and afterward every morning take a dragme of Treacle with
Betonie water. You may give him also stued Pears or Quinces to eat. Likewise
rere sodden eggs wherein is a little Masticke powder strewed, and red Coral
powder. Also the Reins and bladder are to be anointed round about with oil
of Masticke, and oil of Roses.

Of the Flux of the Sperme or seed in the sleep.. 3.
Above the before mentioned flux of the seed, this yet is to be annexed unto
it, when as the seed also passes away in the sleep a nights, and very
seldom by day. The cause of this is daily riotting and surfeiting, and
specially meats which are dressed with spice, and be easy of digestion.
Secondly, the thoughts upon a fair woman whom one loves. Thirdly, to sleep
sound, and to lie upon the back, abundance of blood, abstinence from women,
hail youth, whence all other signs are to be had and taken, these are also to
be remedied like the former. If it be caused of fullness, it is to be cured by
abstinence: if through lust after women, then will it be eased with a godly
Matrimony, as also by the use of cold and dry things, as is already said, of
the running of the Raynes, of that which proceeds not of abundance, but
makes a man unfit to get children, as shall be hereafter spoken of.

Of what and whereby natural Sperme or seed will be most augmented.. 4.
THe cause of the diminishing or increasing of natural seed may as well
proceed of intolerable heat, as cold: also of inward and outward causes. The
cold is repercussiue, and keeps back, the heat consumes. Likewise it may
grow by falls, and such like other things more, whereby the brains are weakened.

Item, of some kind of lesion of the stones and other parts, also of inward, as
a bad concoction of the seed, cutting of the stone, or the Piles, whereby the
generation of the seed is hindered, of sore precedent diseases, of sorrow,
heaviness, temptation, smalnesse of the human member, and (amongst diverse
other causes) of age also.

Now for to help this disease (even as is before said) not to increase
lechery or fleshly lust, but in favor and preferment of Matrimony. For this
therefore is good, warm and dry weather, and also all such dwellings, yellow
Rape seed baked in bread, as much that there be put one scruple in half a
penyworth of white bread is very requisite: young fat flesh, not salted too
much, a sauce with Saffron, long Pepper, and tails of Stincus prepared with
good Wine: all sour, sharp, doughy and slimy meats, must be forborne, long
sleep, and especially after meat does annoy: for the long sleep immediately
after meat does no less hinder venerie, then surfeiting with meat and
drink. He is also to eschew all vexation, sorrow, and care.

But in general, these things are good for the increase of human seed, and
to recover the loss thereof again, to wit, Eggs, Milks, Rise dressed in Milk,
Sparrowes brains, yea the whole birds. Also the stones of these Beasts

All Spices are very commodious for this use, as Cinnamom, Cardamome,

One may use outwardly Wax made to an Ointment, with oil of Beuercod. Or take
Beuercod, Marierom gentle, oil of Costus, of each a like much, put thereto a

thereby excitated and stirred up, and other kindness do come upon you, then do
what in you lies.

The seventh Chapter. Of Barrenness in general.
WHen as then neither in the one nor in ye other, as that neither in the Man
nor in the Woman, there appears any infirmity in the parts of generation,
and both parties are mighty enough for the work, notwithstanding cannot come
to any generation, then must there be a certain cause of barrenness, whereof
there be many kinds. First then concerning the Man, it may be well caused
through outward and inward accidents: the outward are the hard meats, whereto
there comes then also the unbelief of Withcraft. But if so be that the same
proceed of inward causes, then does the same proceed of the weakness of the
most principal parts of man's body, as of the Heart, the Brains, the Liver, the
Stomach, and the Milt. Or he may be too fat, or too lean, with many more other
infirmities, which may be in the privy members, that are not to be here
discovered. The signs of the Barrenness of the man are these, great heat,
which may be known by feeling him. The woman in receiving feels the great
heat of the seed, he has great desire to the action, and is very hairy over
al his body, and got hair very early about the priuities: But if so be that
cold be the cause, then are these things found to be all contrary.

Concerning the Women, the Barrenness may be caused by drinking too much cold
water, by continual use of sour meats, by anger, by fear, by frighting, and
other motions more of the mind which may cause all the same. Item, when a woman
after copulation stirs by and by, leapeth, runs, or daunceth too much. If
it proceed of any inward cause, then must it be either of the constitution of
the whole body, or of some other infirmity of the parts of generation. If of
the constitution of the whole body, then shall some principal part of the body
feel the same, to wit, by reason that the Terms are hindered, or flow too
much. Also a woman may be too old, or too young, or too fat, which makes
barren. If the malady be in the parts of generation, then depends it most in
the mother or womb, which has some vlceration, or is too wide or too narrow,
or too much obstructed, and such like.

The signs of Barrenness in women are these, to wit, when it proceeds of
the coldness of the mother, then has she her Terms very little, and if they
do run, yet are they not well colored: they have also but little hair on
their priuities, they be by nature slow and slack, they care not much for men,
and are commonly of a pale color, for which does also much help the long use
of meats or drinks which are cold of nature.

If the Barrennes be caused through heat, then has she likewise her flowers
or terms very little, mixed with yellowness, the woman is hasty headed,
crafty, thirsty, desirous of the man, hairie about her privy place, she has a
quick pulse, and black hair, with other tokens more, all which dry or moist
diseases must needs be in the mother, or in the neck of the same.

Thirdly, they are sometimes of a contrary complexion, for that the seed
cannot be rightly mixed, or sometime also too near like one another of
complexion: For an example, when a cold man comes to a cold woman, or that
they be both dry of nature: and if in all things else they be also of like
complexions one to another, then is it impossible that the woman can conceive.
There shall be more other signs described how to know by whom the let and
infirmity comes, to wit, do cast both Spermata upon the water, and that
which drives on the top, is barren. Item, sprinkle both their vrines upon a
Lettice leaf, and whosoever does dye away first, the same is unfruitful. Or
take five corns of Wheat, seven Barley grains, and seven Beans, put them
all into an earthen pot, and piss thereon, let it stand so seven days long,
and if they begin to sprout, then is the person fruitful, or if they rot, then
is he or she barren, be it man or woman.

Or let him piss in a pot, and let the urine stand awhile, if worms grow
therein, then is that urine barren. These three last proofs do the ancient
Physicians themselves say to be uncertain, therefore we will let them rest.

Item, make underneath an odoriferous fume, as of Myrrh, red Storax, and such
like odoriferous warm things to pass into the neck of the womb, through a
tunnell, which being close covered round about, if the woman find that this
smoke go through the body, and feels it in her nose, then is she fruitful.

Another. Take gross beaten Garlic, and lay the woman with her back
thereupon, if so be that she feel the smell in her nose, then is it a token of
fruitfulness. There are more such like tokens which are said to be approved:
but how that fruitfulness is to be furthered and helped, there are diverse
remedies hereafter rehearsed out of the writings of the most famous Physicians,
out of which may be chosen according to the complexion of women, whether they
be hot, cold, moist, dry, fat, lean, oppilated, or contrary by nature.

For to help and prefer or hasten fruitfulness.. 1.
IF that fruitfulness be desired to be furthered and helped, then must the
cause that hinders the same be abated and taken away, of which the learned do
reckon very many, which may be contained in three especial points, as when a
woman is to hot, and too dry, too cold, and too moist, or has her terms or
flowers too much or to little, of which three especial points we will now
discourse.

Of Barrenness through heat.. 2.
ALl such women must beware of hot air, dwellings, and such like: also of
clothes which keep the parts and sinews about the womb too hot. Also they
must eschew all hot meats, as Spice, salt flesh, strong Wine, very fat
meats, warm herbs, as Smallage, Fennel, Thyme, Southernewood, Rue, long
watching, to lie much on the Raynes or Kidneis, great labor, anger,
heaviness, and such like motions of the mind: but all that moderately cools
that must be used. They must take oftentimes conserve of Roses, or cold
Dragagant losinges, and the confections Triasantali, also to hold before the
nose and smell to Campher, Rose water, and Saunders, as has been many times
told for hot sicknesses.

Above all these, must the Basilica or Liver vein be opened in the right arm,
and to let out about five ounces of blood. On the next day is this purgation to
be used: Take Elect. de Epithimo, de succo Rosarum, of each two dragmes and a
half, the whay of Milk four ounces, temper them well together, and take it
in the morning, then sleep afterward about one hour and a half, and fast
four hours upon it: this being done, drink a good draught of whay, and you
may break your fast one hour after.

Other do purge with Triphera Saracenica, and Rubarb, and also minister
preparatiue potions mixed either with sirupes of Violets, Roses, or Endive.

Or take the water of water Lillies four ounces, water of Mandragora one
ounce, beaten Saffron half a scruple: drink them luke warm, and do this
eight days one after another.

Also you may use these pills following: Take Broom flowers, Smallage, Parsley
seed Comin, Mugwort, and Feuerfew, of each half a scruple, Aloe half an
ounce, Indy salt and Saffron, of each half a dragme, powne them all together
and mix them well; afterward power thereon five ounces of warm Feuerfew
water: close it to, and let it stand and dry in a warm place: do this three
times one after another. This being all done, then make six pills of each
dragme, and take always one thereof before supper about the second day, all
the while that this foresaid Potion is used, afterward you must take one
thereof about the third or fourth day, until that she have conceived. After
the foresaid Potions must this purgation following be used: Take the conserve
Benedicta lax: one quarter of ounce, de Psillio three dragmes, Electuarium de
succo Rosarum one dragme and a half; temper them together with Feuerfew water,
and drink it warm in the morning early: three days after this purgation must
the Median vein be opened in the right foot, to wit, five or six hours
after breakefast, and according to her strength must be letten out five or six
ounces of blood, the next day, and also five days one after another filed
Iuorie is to be taken, one dragme and a half with Feuerfew water. And the
whilst that this Potion is by her used, then is she in the morning one hour
before that she do arise, and also at night before she go to bed, to sit in
this bath following, and remain therein about half an hour.

Take wild yellow Rapes, Daucus, Balsam wood with the fruits, and the seed or
keys of an ash tree, of each two handfuls, red and white Behen, and Broom
flowers, of each a handful and a half, Musk three grains, Amber, Saffron,
of each one scruple, sees all these in sufficient water. But the Saffron,
Musk, Amber and Broom flowers must be put into it when all the rest be
sufficiently decocted and wrong out.

A profitable Confection. Take Pistacia, Pingles, Eringus, of each half an
ounce, of the sweet roots which the Italians do call Dolcegine as much also, of
Saffron one dragme, Lignum Aloes, Galingall, Mace, Gariophilata, red and white
Behen, and Baulme flowers, of each four scrup. shaven Iuorie and Cassia
rindes, of each two scruples, sirupe of confected Ginger twelve ounces, white
Sugar six ounces: sees these well together with the sirupe in twelve ounces
of Baulme water until it be all decocted: when it is cold, then put the rest
amongst it, and stir it well together: Lastly mix Musk, and Amber amongst
it, of each half a scruple. Hereof must a woman take thrice a day, to wit, in
the morning, one hour before noone, and one hour after supper, every time the
quantity of a Nutmeg, and that especially after purging and bathing. This
confection is rather a strengthening and warming medicine than cooling; and is
specially to be used when it is perceived that the phlegm and slime be
approaching.

For Barrenness through drought.. 3.
FOr this must be eschewed all that which is hot, for that hot things consume
the natural moisture too soon; notwithstanding their meat and drink must be
meetly warm, as Barley and Oten paps, Pullets, and small hard fishes. For this
is to be used small Clisters: as the broth of Lambs heads, and common herbs
which do moysten: to wit, Violet leaves, and such like: Pessaries of Hollihocke
roots fattened with fresh Butter, and so put into the neck of the Womb.
Goats milk and such like, that do fatten and moysten, are very commodious for
this purpose. In like manner also Almonds and Pingles, which not only through
their fattening withstand the drouth, but also do strengthen all the sinews.

Of Barrenness through fatness.. 4.
THe great fatness is no small cause of Barrenness: therefore are all such
women to lead and observe such a rule of life, whereby the superfluous
fatness may be consumed, whereof in the first Part you shall have an especial
Chapter. But for a general observation, they must not sleep much, and chiefly
by day. Also they must forbear all baths, except such as be warm of
themselves. For this is also good a dry sweet bath very commodious and
profitable. To purge often is also good for this. Item strong Clisters which
warm and dry, and other things more which hereafter shall be described.

Of Barrenness through cold and moisture.. 5.
A Woman which is cold and moist, meetely strong exercise is very good for her,
except it be then, when she has accompanied with her husband: after which time
she ought to rest two hours at the least. Also she is not to be ouercharged
with any meat: but rather to refrain always with appetite.

Much sleep, sorrow, anger, etc. she must beware of. To eat much fish is
hurtful unto her, Milk, fresh Cheese, and all that is made of dough; Beetes,
Lettice, Spinach, Endive, Purslaine, Cherries, Hasell nuts, Garlic, Onions
and such like, are not meet for her: fat flesh, much broth and Vinegar must
she refrain: for they be hurtful for the Womb.

There is therein specially to be considered, how to cleanse the womb from all
excessive moisture; for which are to be used some preparatiue potions of Oxymel
of Squils, or at the least of Oxymel Composito, and sirupe of Wormwood, with a
decoction of Annis, Fennel, Comin, Cuscuta, and Hearts tongue. And then to take
thereupon Pil. Benedictae one dragme once every fourteen days, and then to
fast five hours after them.

Secondly, take Styrax Calaminta, field Mints, Asphalathus, Ameos Seseli, Rue,
Balsam wood and the fruits, red and white Behen, of each half an ounce, make a
bath thereof, and let her sit in it even to the Navel.

In the mean time no delay must be in anointing the places adjoining about
the womb, with warming and drying oils; as oil of Spike, oil of Elder, and
such like.

Also this Confection is to be used: Take Cinnamom, Cardamom, Saffron, Cloves,
Mace, long pepper, Cypers roots, Nutmegs, Comin, Lignum Aloes, and Cassia wood,
of each one scrup. Cucubes and Doronicum, of each four scruples, Musk, Amber,
and Balsam, one dragme, white Sugar eighteen ounces, Malmesey, Buglosse water,
and of Balm, as much as is needful for to sees the Sugar, then make a
Confection; whereof she is every evening to take a spoonefull when she goes to
bed, also half so much before supper.

Another. Take yellow Rape seed, Pease, and scraped Iuorie, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Nettle seed, Ameos, Sesel, Indy Spica, Cardamome, Blatta
Byzantia, Bay berries, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, Hyssope, Marierom, Spikenard, and
Cypers roots, of each one dragme, white, black, and long Pepper, half an
ounce together; Ginger and Cinnamom, of each one ounce, this being all stamped
and mixed together make with honey a Confection thereof, and lastly temper
therewith two or three grains of Musk.

All the foresaid things are special good to consume the winds of the womb.
Now for this purpose follows here certain simples and compounded medicines;
as Annis, Fennel, Caraway, Smallage seed, and Rue seed, each used alone. In
like sort, Marierom, Agnus Castus, flowers and seeds, Comin, prepared
Spikenard seed, Bayberries, Rue, the Tabulats of Diacumino, and Aniso, that do
altogether consume moisture.

For to fume or to foment are specially commended these things following, Rue,
Carni, Ameos and Gallia muscata.

Item, take Galliam Muscatam, Bdellium, Beuercod, Laudanum, Hares grease, and
Nutmegs, of each half an ounce, let these sees all together in water, and
wash or foment therewith.

This following cleanses and also warmeth well the Womb, and dries the
moisture of the same: Take Coloquint beaten gross one quarter of an ounce,
Cinnamome three dragmes, temper them with good wine, or with oil of Spike, dip
Cotton therein, and put the same into the neck of the womb.

Item take Swines bread, form thereof a Pessarie of the bigness of a Date
stone, and women must put this into their privy places, being fastened to a
thread: it is passing good. They may also lay this plaster following under
their nauel being cut round. Take ye plaster called Ceraneum two ounces,
Laudanum one ounce and a half, Galliae and Aliptae muscatae, of each half an
ounce; temper them with oil of Spike, and spread it on a round leather, and
use it as is aforesaid.

For to dry and correct a slimy and moist Womb this following is to be used.
Take Silver mountain, red and white Behen, Ash keys, shaven Iuory, yellow
and wild Rape seed, of each one drag. Cinnamom, Mace, Cloves, Galingall, long
Pepper, Rosemarie flowers, Balsam wood, Blattae Byzantiae, Maierom gentle, and
Penniroyal, of each four scruples, Balm, Buglosse, Citron peeles, of each two
scruples, Pearls one scruple, Musk two grains, white Sugar four and twenty
ounces, sees the same with Malmsey, and make thereof a confection. This
confection is very good and approved for all that is aforesaid, and also for
fruitfulness.

For to comfort the retentiue virtue of the womb.. 6.
IF so be that there be any infirmity in the retentiue virtue of the womb,
which does commonly happen through over coldness, for the which are
strengthening and warming things to be used, as Amber, Frankincense, with their
rinds, Masticke, Lignum Aloes, Cloves, Nutmegs, Sage, Galingall, Calmus and
Cardomome. Also she must be governed like as has been said in the discourse of
barrenness. Item, there is more good for this, that the neck of the matrix be
often washed with water wherein Cypers roots are decocted: or with water
wherein Iron dross is sodden, which is stronger. Also for this may serve
Masticke strewed upon hot coals, and the fume thereof received from below.

A very good salve fit for this: Take the juice of Roses, of Pomegranates and
Cloves, of each one ounce, Frankincense, Hypocistis, the juice of Sloes,
Mastick, prepared Coriander, and Iron dross, of each one drag. Sealed earth
and Starch, of each one ounce, bruise these very long in a Leaden mortar, and
anoint the priuities therewith oftentimes. But if the infirmity proceed of
heat, then are things to be used which be astringent, roborating and cooling,
yet tempered with some warm things. The cold things are these, burnt and washed
Hearts horn, Amber, juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, burnt Muskle shells: Bolus,
burnt Gals, Dragon blood, Sealed earth, flowers and shales of Pomegranates,
Acornes with their cups, the rind of the Medlar tree and the fruits, Services
and Myrtle seed, of all these foresaid simples may salues, plasters, and
other things be prepared, which are all fit for this infirmity.

Of Barrenness through repletion of the body, and obstruction of the Terms or
Flowers.. 7.
THese women must forbear all slimy meats, as milk and all that is dressed
therewith, also from all doughie meats, pottage and old fish, unleavened
bread, new Cheese (but old Cheese is meetely tolerable) from all cold and
moist fruits. Touching all other meats, they may live according to their old
custom: their drink must be reasonable or mean strong white wine.

Concerning the medicines, you must first begin with the letting of blood,

said purgation must be made thus: Take Electuarium Indum half an ounce, de
Succo Rosarum one drag. temper this with three ounces of water of Elecampane
roots.

For the poor is only the oil of Lillies commended with a pessarie of Cotton
dipped therein, and so put up and holden therein the space of three hours.

When such women have purged and bathed, then must they, before that they come
at their husbands, be let blood in the Saphena or Median, two hours after
supper, letting out three or four ounces of blood, if so be that she be any
thing strong.

It were also very good that when such women arise a mornings, they do gird

wine: all which are described in the last part, with other more such spiced
Wines, which are very fit for such ouercold and barren men and women.

For to make a woman fruitful, for which this serves for a potion and bath
following: Take Wormwood and Mugwort, of each a handful, sees them together
in a quart of Goats milk almost to the half, whereof every morning and
evening she is to take a good draught.

For to bathe: Take wild Penniroyall, Mugwort and Rue, of each one handful;
make a bag thereof, and let them sees in rain water: bathe therein every
eight hours, and always about the third day a fresh bath.

For a conclusion, in women is (as it is already said) the greatest cause of
barrennes, for that the Matrix or Womb is not clean, is ouercooled, or has
some other infirmity, whereof hereafter in this part shall be discoursed and
taught, also what is meet and fit for the same.

The eight Chapter. Of the Raines and their pains.
EVen as we have described now the outward parts before of the belly in this
third part of our book of Physic, so does the cause require that we ought to
write somewhat of the hinder part, amongst which the Raines are comprehended:
and that these raines are a part of the back, it appears by all that here
before in the second part in the fourth chapter, and also afterward is
written, therefore it is thought needless to make any further mention thereof.

These Raines do suffer by reason of the Kidneys very great pain, when the
same are vexed with heat, vlceration, grauel, stone, or other malady, the
description whereof yet hereafter follows in this third part, where it may
also be noted and observed what may be good and commodious for the same. There
be commonly commended for hot pains in the raines oil of Roses, Violets, and
yellow violets, Waterlillies, and Poplar buds, in like sort also three salues
following, of Saunders, the cooling ointment of Galeni, and the Poplar salve
are very good, and that in all hot causes.

But if the pain proceed of cold, then is Honywater to be drunken, and
confected roots of Eryngus, Fennel, Comin, Caraway, be it confected or
otherwise, are to be eaten, for they assuage much the pain. Some use also the
conserues of Piony.

This salve following is especial good: Take blew and yellow Violets, of each
one ounce and a half, oil of sweet Almonds, of Sesamum, of each one dragme
and a half, fresh butter one ounce, Saffron one scruple, white Wax one ounce
and a half, Ducks grease, oil of Cammomill, oil of Dill, of each one quarter
of an ounce, and a small yolke of an Egg, the oil, grease, and butter melt
together, and at the last put the Saffron and yolke unto it, and stir it well
about, it swageth much the pain which is caused through the grauel, stone, and
any thing else, therefore it is called by the Grecians Onodynum, even as the
Apothecaries do call it unto this day Vnguentum Anodynum.

The ninth Chapter. Of the Buttockes.
THere are two Buttocks given to men for their use, by nature compiled of a
compact, fast, muscly, and hard flesh: and not narrow piked, bearing up like to
Beasts, but pretty and round, as well for a comeliness of the same place, as
for to sit on, and ease the whole body, covering and defending the fundament,
that the same cannot be violated nor strained through sitting. These foresaid
buttocks do seldom suffer any other infirmity, but such as be subject to
Surgery, as wounds, vlcerations, fistulaes, Cankers, and such like. Besides
this, is no more to be spoken thereof: therefore we will pass over to the
Fundament or outward part of the Arsegut, with his infirmities, which are
incident unto it outwardly and inwardly.

The tenth Chapter. Of the Arsegut or Fundament in general.
THere have bin some dotrels in the world, who have complained of nature,
wherefore she had not chosen as well a bone or some other nether member of the
body, whereby she might expel ye excreme^ts, as she did this mild place of the
body; which gross speech is to be scorned as a great folly: for how could she
have ordained a closer, fitter and handsomer place tha^ this? Concerning then
this Arsgut, it is a conueier of all excrements, long and wide; and whereas it
comes to our sight with a round circle, it is there shapen of a muscly and
sinewy substance, (like as are the lips of the mouth) therefore has it also
such power that it opens like a purse, and shuts fast again, that it might
not receive any wind or any thing else. Unto these privy places do there come
sundry accidents, amongst which the most manifest is, when this gut does fall
out of ye body, therefore we will first of al write thereof.

Of the going out or hanging down of the Arse-gut, Procidentia Any.. 1.
THis may be caused by two manner of means, to wit, when the Muscles and
Lacerts, which do open and shut this gut with two sinews (which presently
divide themselves into two parts) do give and relent through some falling down
of humors, or thrust the same out through some impostume. Of the said sinews,
that which opens the Arsgut is outward, and that which shuts the same
inward. If so be then (as it is said) that any of these sinews be too sore
feebled or slacked through any humors, then follows immediately the
Procidentia, or hanging out of the Arsgut. The signs that this is happened
through some resolution of the sinews, are, yt it may easily without pain be
brought again into the body; like as contrariwise if there be any impostume
with it, then will it not be done without grief. Also there is always a
hardness with it, and an apparent distemperature. Now for to remedy this, cause
first that the patient may have his going naturally to the stool, that he be
not suddenly forced for to open the gut. But if there be no swelling with it,
and that you have no other thing near hand which is fit for it, then let the
patient sit in common warm water. Otherwise it may be made stronger as thus:
Take Acorne cups, Gall nuts, flowers of Pomegranats, and Myrtle leaves, sees
them together in water until it be a little red, and sit therein. The same do
Cipers nuts alone, or the juice of Sloes, wherein Myrtle seed and the seeds of
Verbascum are decocted. After this bath, then foment the dependant gut with
warm oil of Roses, and afterward strew this powder thereon: Take white led,
blossoms of Pomegranats, Antimony, and Allume, of each a like much, make
thereof a subtle powder.

Item take Butchers broom half an ounce, Gals, the yellow seeds of Roses,
Cipers nuts, Myrrh and Frankincense, of each one dragme, beat them to powder,
and use them as aforesaid. Another. Burn Dates to powder, and strew that
powder thereon, as is said. Or take Mumia, Lycium, Hypocistis, and beaten Gals,
of each two scruples, burnt Oistershels two drag. and a half, and use it as
before. This following is also very good for this: Take Hypocistis, Masticke
and Myrrh, of each one dragme, beat it meetly small: first anoint the gut
with oil of Masticke and Roses, strew it then with this said powder: this
being done, thrust it softly into the body, lay a cloth thereon wetted in
gross wine, and it is good to put a little Sandaraca unto it.

It is also very good to anoint the place oftentimes with steeled wine for the
same: and in like manner Sauine dried, beaten, and strewed upon it.

Item, after the anointing with oil, anoint the gut with the juice of Sloes:
when as then through any superfluity of humors this gut does fall down in
children, then take Myrrh one dragme and a half, oil of Roses one ounce,
anoint it therewith, and then put it up again softly into the body.

This Procidentia Any, or falling down of the Arsegut, happens for the most
part in the Piles with an excrescence of flesh, the which the Grecians do call
Condyloma: for which Parietaria is very good laid often upon it, whereof we
will write more at large hereafter.

Of the relaxation or slacking of the Arsegut.. 2.
THis disease does manifest it self sometimes through the first recited falling
down of the Arsegut, and otherwhiles without the same, and is such an
infirmity (as has bin told already) that the sinews which do shut it are
become altogether without might, insensible and lame, insomuch that he cannot
perceive his Ordure, and does it without any sense or feeling: also often times
so contracted and made so senseles, that it holds up and stays the Ordure
altogether, whereby comes gripings in the belly, and other great
inconveniences. The causes of this, are sometimes falls, thrusts or blows behind
on the back, and especially on the place whence the sinews have their
offspring, whereby the power of the opening and shutting of the Arsegut is
infeebled.

In like manner when any body has the Piles opened, whereby the Piles are in
that place spoiled. This infirmity may also be caused by sitting too long on
cold stones, and by suffering too much cold in the feet. But if this disease
do come through cutting, or any other bruising of the sinews, then are all
remedies in vain. If it come through cold, which takes away all motion, then
is the place to be kept always warm: for which this bath following is very
good, which is thus prepared: Take Cipers nuts and the leaves, Mints, Sauine,
Costus roots, Sage, Bay berries, rindes of the Pine tree and the leaves, of
each one handful; sees them all together in a good quantity of water, so that
the sick person may sit therein; when he has been bathed, then lay a piece of
felt in this water, and lay it to the patients Arsegut: he must use this bath
twice in four and twenty hours, it warmeth and strengthens the sinews of
the Arsegut.

Also he must sees therewith Rue, Scenanthe, Allume, garden Mints, field
Mints: and if it will not alter therewith, then use these clisters following:
Take six ounces of this foresaid decoction, and oil of Spike two ounces, and
mix them together: and anoint the Arsegut outwardly, and all other places
adjacent with oil of Lillies, Beuercod, and of Euphorbium, tempered all
together, or used each apart. If there be any phlegmatic moisture with it, then
put unto it half an ounce or three quarters of Hiera Picra: if that there be
heat with it, let the patient after the use of all necessary medicines take a
bath of water, wherein has bin decocted the rinds of the Medlar tree and the
leaves, the rinds of Oak, Services, Pomegranate rinds and blossoms, Chestnut
shales, or those that may be gotten of them, yet always putting some warming
things unto it.

For this is also especial good all natural bathes, which are Sulphurish,
Allumish, yea there is also good for this Sea water or salt water.

Of the Impostume of the Arsegut.. 3.
IF there happen then any ulcer or impostume in the Arsegut, whereby one can
not get it into the body, and the same is caused through heat, there is
nothing more fit than to open a vein, and afterward to provoke vomit, whereby
the matter may be derived: but for this is no purging good, and especially
because the disease is in the fundament, but lay this following thereon: Take
peeled Lentils three ounces, Roses and the juice of Sloes, of each one ounce,
the juice of Nightshade three ounces, beaten Hollihock roots, Figs cut,
Linseed and Fenegreeke beaten small, as much as you think good: let this sees
all to pap, and at the last temper therewith three or four yolks of Eggs, and
as much Butter as you think good, and lay it warm upon the place where the
pain is. If so be then this be caused through cold, then put unto it a little
of the roots of Lillies, Cammomill, Melilot, and such like. And if so be that
this Arsegut by reason of the impostume, will hardly be put up again into the
body, then must the patient be set oftentimes in warm water, and afterward
anoint the Arsegut with oil of Cammomill and of Dill, which are molten with a
little Wax; this swageth the pain. In like sort also descends the neck of
the Matrix in women, and is in such sort to be cured, like as hereafterwards
amongst other infirmities of the womb shall be written more at large.

Of the Piles called Haemorrhoides.. 4.
AFter the foresaid falling down of the Arsegut, there comes one disease
more in the fundament, the which we call the Piles, and the Grecians
Haemorrhoides, which is a flux of blood; and Sycoses, that are Figs, which the
Latinists do call Ficus, Figs, and Mariscas. All these are Accidents and
Tumors, which do come behind in the Fundament, or in the lowermost part of the
Arsegut. And they do appear by their swelling, and otherwise (whereof they get
their name) sometimes with blood, and otherwhiles without blood, but seldom
without pain, but vexes folks with great trouble. They take their beginning
from some small veins, which spread themselves into the uttermost parts of the
stomach, and are thereof called the Pile or Emroyd veins. When as these be
then ouercharged with blood, or any other humors, then do they open themselves,
and expel the melancholic blood from them sometimes in great quantity, whereby
nature is much unburdened, and gets great health; therefore it is often
commanded for to open the same, even as hereafter shall be admonished: also
they bleed otherwhiles so excessiuely, that great travel is taken before they
can be stopped, whereof we shall speak hereafter. There be also some of these
veins which lie somewhat deep upwards, and therefore are called the blind
Piles.

These Piles are properly the Hemorrhoides, like as by their name may appear.
Others be without blood, of the which, they that make show outwardly on the
Arsegut are first of all the Figpiles, by reason that in their whole substance
and quantity they be like unto figs, and also are therefore called Verrucales,
the which are much worse than the other, whose cause is only melancholic
blood. Other do show themselves like to a black ripe grape, so that they be
called Vnales, which have their matter from blood mingled with melancholy. The
third are like to Mulberies, red and blackish colored, wherein the blood does
apparently exceed.

The fourth kind is like to the bladder of a fish, which is extended very much
without blood, filled or stuffed with melancholic humors; but these sorts are
seldom seen. The first sort are the secret Piles, which do come within the
Arsegut, and be very hurtful, especially those which extend toward the
priuities, for that through their hot tumors they hinder the passage of the
urine, whereby the strangury is provoked, and especially when they do not
bleed. Now for to know these hidden Piles and diseases, there is nothing more
certain than to set a great box or cup on the Arsegut without pricking, the
which will draw the Arsegut outward, so that it may be apparently seen how
that the case does consist within. The sixth kind of Piles are the Figs, a
certain excrescence upon the Arsegut outwardly, who with a little vein like
the stalk of a fig, is fastened to the gut, formed as it were a small dry fig,
from thence a little bigger, and is pressed down on the top like a Fig, which
is called of the Greeks Condyloma, which is an excrescence of flesh, for it
happens sometimes that round about the roundnes of the Arsegut, or fast besides
it, there do come great scabs which sometimes (yet uncertain whether it be
first or last according as the patient rules himself) do happen to bleed,
sometimes much and sometimes little. These figs and swellings are tempered also
with blood and melancholy, a little red outwardly and perilous enough, even as
hereafter shall be further expressed.

In all these Species of the Pyles, the learned have a general rule, that they
esteem them for an accident that can hardly be cured. They recite nine causes
of these accidents, albeit we will recite but four. First, for that it is in
an unclean place, and no man medleth willingly therewith. Secondly, for that
this place is very hard to be seen. Thirdly, for that it is a place whither
all uncleanness of the body does descend: Lastly, for that it is a place cold
by nature, and therefore void of strength, notwithstanding there be many good
remedies provided and ordained for them, as hereafter follows.

But before we discourse of the foresaid remedies for the Pyles, Blathers,
Figs, Warts, Tumors, and their accidents, we will first of all show their
causes, and teach how the same may be cured, for which the principallest is to
observe a good diet in meat and drink, and such like.

Of the Diet.
IT is sufficiently declared before, that the greatest cause of these accidents
is the heavy melancholic blood, which is mixed with the pure blood, and
perishes the same, which all other members expel from them, like as it were a
poison, and so falls downwards from the other blood into the veins, opens
them through his heat, and makes them bleed.

This is altogether caused of a bad digestion of the stomach, and other
members, and of all such gross meats, whereof there can be none other
engendered but melancholic blood, the which must be altogether left off, as
Beans, Lentils, and other Pottages. Item, Coleworts, Cheese, old Beef, Hearts,
Hares, Goats, salted and smoked flesh, sodden Wheat, Rice, unleavened bread,
which bring much moisture with them.

Also all water Fowls, Eeles and other Fish without scales, feet, heads, and
all entrails of Beasts, gross Wine, Must, and Beer. Item, all things which
burn the blood, as much Mustard, Pepper, Garlic, Onions, Leekes. All things
which be very cold do also increase melancholy, as Melons, Cucumbers, and such
like.

Amongst the medicines which are contrary for this disease, are Coloquint,
Centorie, Scammonie, and chiefly Aloe, very hurtful for the Arsegut, for it
opens the Pyles.

Even as we have recited what is hurtful for this disease, so will we also
teach what manner of diet might be commodious and profitable for the same. The
dwelling of this patient must be a warm and dry place, which is close and
toward the South. But if the house be not of it self fit thereto, then is it
to be prepared for the same with fire and fumes: yet is always to be eschued
things which be too hot, and must take the mild mean which are hot and dry,
as Frankincense, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Laudanum, and such like.

And whereas all kinds of Pyles do agree in this, they be caused of blood and
melancholy (like as is already alleged) and of both together mixed, so may
the patient use one and the self same diet.

Next after the dwelling place, the patient must also according to the time of
the year, provide himself of clothes, which are meetely dry and warm, keep
the head well covered, and defend the outward members from all cold.

His meat must be white bread, not above three days old, Eggs, Butter, Lambs
flesh, Veale, Kids, Mutton, Pullets, Capons, Partriches, Phesants, and Pigeons,
yet of all these a little: in like manner all field Fowls.

His drink shall be good white Wine, all gross and sour Wines shall he
forbear, albeit that it were much better a good Sugared water than Wine, sodden
Milk, fresh and meetely well salted Cheese, be meetely good for him; but good
regard must be had that he feed thereof moderately, so that the stomach be not
ouercharged.

But if any excess be perceived, then is it not amiss that the patient be
moved to vomit, and to take that with one ounce and a half of Vinegar, and
three ounces of warm water, and afterward to put the finger into the throat,
and if that will not be, then may he take an easy Clister.

These patients are always for the most part bounden in the body, the which
brings with it great pain and grief, therefore diligence is to be had that
he keep an open body, for this shall he sup every morning and evening before
meat some broth, wherein is sodden Mercury, Mallows, Burrage, Beetes, and
Fumitorie, and with a little of the oil of sweet Almonds or Butter. Also to
eat sometimes new Prunes and Reisons, and drink upon it some broth of
Coleworts; after that, he may eat some other meats. Also it were not amiss,
to eat against this binding of the body one dragme of peeled wild Saffron
seed, or one quarter of an ounce of Cassie, now the one, and then the other.

Reasonable motion, yet more with the hands, then with the feet or the whole
body, is very good, but riding and sitting hard is very bad. In fine, long
rest is better then short, so must it be always with sleep. He must lie most
upon his right side, but little on his left side, or on his back. Lastly, he
must utterly eschew all sorrow, vexations, anger, and other passions of the
mind.

To staunch the bleeding of the Pyles.. 5.
FOr to come to the remedy of this accident, therefore we will first begin if
these Pyles happened to bleed overmuch, how and wherewith the same is staunched.

First therefore we will rehearse this (whereof has also been spoken before)
that if this bleeding chance without pain, and not but by flawes, then is it
no counsel to stay it unless the patient were greatly weakened thereby.

For when these veins begin to bleed, then do they exonerate the whole body
of many melancholic diseases, as of the Leprosy, Pocks, dry Itch, Dropsy,
quartaine Agues, hardness of ye Milt, or Spleen, and mo other such like
infirmities, which grow of burnt blood, and of such like humors, as hereafter
shall appear in a proper, wherein shall be taught how the same shall be
opened: also if they that accustomed to bleed and now remain stopped, do cause
the Dropsy, the Consumption, and many other Sicknesses.

But if the bleeding of them do get the maistrie, and thereby do weaken the
patient, then must the same be staunched; and take good heed, whether the same
bleeding be on the right side, for it is sometimes a messenger of some long
lingering sickness, as headache, giddines, hinderance of the breath, and to
conclude, feeblenes of the whole body, so that he cannot well go nor stand: at
the last follows great thirst and binding of the body.

When as then these kinds of inconveniences do all appear, or part of them,
then must such bleeding be staunched out of hand, and forbear from all manner
of Spices, also from Onions, Garlic, Mustard, strong white Wine, Venery, great
labor, and all such like things, which inflame the blood; and to the contrary,
use all things that increase blood: for this, is also good the sirupes of
Quinces, Roses, Mirtles, Trocisci de Terra sigillata, and de Carabe. These
staunchers of blood must be laid outwardly upon the Fundament: Take the white
of an Egg, and temper amongst it beaten Momy, sealed earth, fine Bolus, and
Dragon blood.

Also these things following by their proper virtue, staunch this bleeding, as
Amber, prepared Bloudstone, burnt or prepared Coral, Dragon blood, fine Bolus,
burnt Vitrioll, Aloe, Plantaine, Mastick, Blossoms of Pomgranats, the barks of
Frankincense, Copwebs, Hares hairs cut small, burnt Ass dung, and powdered
Basil.

The compounded things are these, Trocisci de Corallis, de Spodio: Also, one
may take one dragme of Amber and sealed earth with water wherein is decocted
Butchers broom seed.

The pills of Bdellio, and de Sandaraca, must one take the first eight days the
weight of half a dragme, and fast five hours after it.

Powders and other things to staunch Blood.
TAke the bones of Bulls feet, red and white Coral, the stones of Dates,
Oyster shells, burnt al together, of each one quarter of an ounce, Vitriol half
a dragme, burnt Iuorie, Amber, and Bloudstone, of each three dragmes, Dragon
blood, the juice of Sloes, the powder of sour Pomgranat blossoms, Dragagant
and Gum, both of them tosted, of each two dragmes and a half, beat them
together very small, and temper one amongst another, then strew it upon the
place of the bleeding, and lay Cotton thereon, which is made wet in Rose
vinegar, afterward bind it hard upon it, this stauncheth blood maruellously,
although it had continued a year and a day; and not only for this, but also
for all excessive bleeding.

There may also a plaster be made of the foresaid powder, and Mill dust with
the juice of Plantaine, Comfrey or Tassels.

Item, take Aloe, Frankincense, Dragon blood, Pomgranate blossoms, and Sief
memithe, of each a like much, make a powder thereof, and use it as before.

Another. Take Cypers nuttes, and worm eaten Gals, of each half a dragme,
Dragon blood, Mummy, Dragagant and Gum, both of them tosted, of each one
dragme, Gips half an ounce, temper them all together, and strew therewith the
whole Arsegut, it stancheth bleeding a whole day.

One more. Take the yellow seeds of the Rose, stamp them to powder, strew it
thereon, for they dry and staunch blood.

Item, take Hermodactyli two scruples, prepared Antimonie one dragme,
Frankincense one scruple, Myrrh half a scruple, make a powder thereof, and
strew it upon the Pyles where they bleed: and further, spread round about the
same Pyles this salve following:

Take of the unguent Pompholygos half an ounce, unguent of Roses two ounces,
oil of Quinces, Linseede oil, and oil of Nuts, of each half an ounce,
Hermodactyli two scruples, Pomegranate blossoms and Dragagant, of each one
scrup. Mummy, Dragon blood, and prepared Tutty, of each one dragme, Bean meal
and Mill dust, of each one dragme, Plantaine, Verbascum, Willow leaves, Myrtle
leaves, and Horse tails, of each one dragme and a half, Camfer ten greines,
oil of Roses as much as is needful therewith to make a salve, spread thereof
upon a woollen cloth and lay it upon the Fundament: the blood of the Pyles has
therewith been stanched at sundry times, when all other remedies had been used,
and would not help, until this aforesaid was applied. Item, take Gips, beat
it small, and make it to dough with the beaten white of an Egg, this
stauncheth blood marvelous well, and that in a quarter of an hour, in what
sort of bleeding soever it be.

Item, take Aloe, Frankincense, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, and small cut hairs
of a Hare, of each one quarter of an ounce, beat them all small, afterward
take a Cobweb out of a Mill, rub it amongst it, and make thereof a salve with
the white of an Egg, and annoint the place therewith; this also stauncheth
much. It is also good for rent or cut veins, where the blood cannot be
staunched.

Or take the water of Hounds tongue, distilled from the herb and root; when the
Pyles grow inward, then are you to take every morning thereof four ounces, but
if they be outward, then cleanse the same, and lay on this water with a cloth,
it heals much.

Another: Take the kernels of Abricockes one ounce and a half, oil of
Mastick, and unripe Sallad oil, of each three ounces, the juice of Sloes,
Dragagant, Gum, and Fish lime, or Isinglas, which have been long steeped and
are dissolved in the foresaid oil, of each three quarters of an ounce, temper
them together, and dip Cotton therein, and hold it continually on the
Fundament. You may also prepare this following: Take Masticke, Spica, Cypers
roots, Squinant, Calmus, Saffron, and Myrrh, of each a like much, make a
plaster thereof with red Wine, and lay it over the Liver.

Item, take the juice of Plantaine two ounces, Rosewater half an ounce, beaten
seeds of Butchers broom, as much as is needful for to make a mild plaster,
lay this upon the Arsegutte.

Here now follow some Salues.
TAke oil of Myrtle and of Masticke, of each one ounce, Trocisci de Carabe,
Paper glewe, burnt Date stones, burnt Iuorie, Sandaraca, and Bloudstone, of
each one dragme, Wax as much as is needful for to make therewith a soft
salve, annoint therewith the fundament.

Or take beaten Plantaine, Verbascum, Willow leaves, Myrtle leaves, and Horse
tails, of each a like much: to an ounce and a half of this powder, add ten
grains of Camfere, and oil of Roses as much as is neeedfull for to make salve
thereof. This stancheth blood, and dries gently.

A precious salve. Take Comin, Caraway, Rue seed, Ameos, Seseli, and Galliae
Muschatae, of each one dragme and a half, Rosin three dragmes, oil of Dill
two ounces, Sallad oil one ounce, Lignum Aloes, and Cloves, of each half a
dragme; melt the Rosin in the oil, and temper it with the other things being
beaten small, stir it then well about until it be a thick salve. This salve
verily has great virtues, it stauncheth the excessive Terms in women, if they
anoint the raynes and hips therewith: being applied on the Navel and the
stomach it expels wind, and takes away vomiting and parbraking. Will you
then have it stronger to use for ye Pyles? then temper amongst it two scruples
of Saffron, and one dragme of Opium.

Other good Salues more.
TAke dried Orange peels, beat them very small, put thereto a roasted Apple,
and bruise it in a dish: then temper the foresaid powder amongst it until it
be as thick as a Salve: then wash first the Pyles with Plantaine water, and
afterward anoint it with the foresaid salve.

Take two ounces of new Wax, three ounces of Honey, four ounces of Butter;
melt them all together, and strain it warm through a cloth: then set it upon
the fire again, and stir therein as much Wheat flower until it be as thick
as pap, and then lay it thereon. Item, take white Dogs dung, that has eaten
nothing but bones, burn it to ashes, and make a salve thereof with clean
Barrowes grease, and annoint therewith the Pyles, and then strew thereon the
powder of Hermodactiles. Or take the stones of Indian Mirobalans, burn them to
powder: thereof take half an ounce, prepared Iron dross one quarter of an
ounce, temper them well together with the juice of Plantaine in a mortar, and
therewith anoint the Arsegut within and without.

If so be that these forementioned will not help, then take two ounces of the
juice of Roses, the brayed whites of a couple of Eggs, Gips three dragmes; bruise
them in a mortar one amongst another, and use it as aforesaid. The like is also
counseled, when as this bleeding comes too sore, that the Basilica is to be
opened, whereby to derive and withdraw the blood, and afterward that he be
bathed with water wherein Linseede and the seeds of Hollihocks be decocted or
at the leastwise that he be well fomented therewith. Lastly, like as it is said
already, there must be laid thereon beaten Parietarie, or Pellitorie of the
wall.

For to foment withal, take Pomegranate blossoms, Roses, Cipers nuts, seeds
of Butchers broom, Pomegranate peels, Myrtle seed, the juice of Sloes,
Frankincense, of each half an ounce, beat them a little, and sees them in
thick red wine, and water, of each a like much, and foment the place with
sponges; or set the patient in water wherein Gals, Pomegranate blossoms,
butchers Broom, Myrtle seed and such like are decocted.

Item, sees Turnep leaves in water, and therewith wash oftentimes the
Fundament meetly warm. Another: Boil Rose campion in thick red Wine, and
foment the Pyles often therewith.

If so be that through all these remedies the blood be not stanched, then dippe
a little wool in boiling oil, and lay it hot upon it, then will it cease.
Afterward place him in water wherein Gals, Pomgranat peels and the blossoms,
the bark of the Medlar tree, Seruises, Roses, and Allume, of each one ounce
beaten gross were decocted: but red wine were more forcible for this.

How that the inward Pyles are to be staunched.
OF this has mention been made at the first; and for this purpose do serve
these foresaid remedies, if they be to be had. For the staunching of these
Pyles, if they do bleed excessiuely, then is this salve especially to be
ordained for them: Take Pomgranate blossoms and peels, burnt Mussell shells,
Frankincense, Masticke, Dragon blood, sealed earth, and Copwebs, of each a like
much; make a powder thereof with dissolved Isinglas, and common glue in steeled
water: make then a taint of Hares hair, or at leastwise of wool, and lay it
to steep therein, and put it into the Fundament, refreshing it oftentimes.

What is to be used inwardly to staunch this bleeding.
FOr this excessive bleeding of the Pyles are these things following highly
commended: Take Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, Bellirici a little parched, of each
five dragmes, Perles half a dragme, temper them all together with the juice of
Garlic, and use half a drag. thereof at one time with steeled water: the
party is also every morning to eat a couple of confected Mirobalans Chebuli,
and to fast four hours upon it, and that during the space of ten days, or as
long as the bleeding continues. A stronger: Take the confection of Triphera,
ex part Phenouis, or de Scoria ferri, (of which you will) one quarter of an
ounce or less, tempered in two ounces of Purslaine water. Also the juice of
Yarrow may be taken for this one ounce and a half: the same stancheth much.
Item take Wormwood, Venus hair, and Sorrel, of each one handful, Sorrel
seed and the seeds of Plantaine, Melons, Purslaine and Roses, of each one
dragme; sees them in fair well water, afterward wring it out, and put
thereto the shales of yellow Mirobalans one quarter of an ounce, red and white
prepared Coral, Citron seed, of each half a dragme, let it sees to three or
four ounces, then mix with this decoction Syrupum Acetosum Compositum one
ounce, Syrupum de Plantagine half an ounce, take this certain days one after
another in the morning betimes. For this is also good one quarter of an ounce
of Galbanum, dissolved in water and dronken.

A very commodious confection for to be taken always before meat: Take
Butchers broom seed, parched seed of broad Plantaine, the juice of Sloes, and
Coriander, of each one scruple, Amber, all beaten small, and Sugar which is
dissolved in Purslaine water three ounces: take three dragmes thereof at one
time. Above all these astringent medicines you shall find many more in the
discourse of the excessive flux of the Terms in women: also in the first part
where many are specified for the staunching of blood, the which are altogether
good for this purpose.

How that the Pyles are to be opened.. 6.
WHat good this bleeding of the Pyles does cause when it comes by nature and
of it self, and from what sickness it will preserve a man, it is partly
declared in the 5.. Likewise what this bleeding does procure if it be staunched
contrary to the old custom: also what inconveniences may come and ensue
thereof. When as this bleeding disco^tinueth, and the Pyles do vex the patient
with great pain and extuberation, then are they to be opened for to let the
blood have his accustomed course; for this preserves one (besides all the
recited perilous maladies) from all corroding ulcers, wildfire, cankers,
madness, melancholy, falling sickness, enflaming of the Lights, both the kinds of
dropsies and consumption. And if so be that this blood be staunched, then is it
to be feared, that all the foresaid diseases may ensue thereby: therefore when
any body desires to open them, then are these things following to be used.

First put the sick body in a bath whereby the Pyles may be mollified. Or in
the steed thereof make this fomentation: Take Marierom, field Mints, and
Mallows, sees them in wine, and receive the vapor thereof from beneath,
sitting on a close stool meetly warm: the next day after open the Saphea, or
the Median. The Saphea is upon the hindermost part of the foot, besides the
heel, whereby the melancholicke blood is drawn downward: afterward annoint
the Pyles with oil of bitter Almonds, or oil of Nuts: also a little Cotton is
good for this, made wet in the juice of Onions, and laid thereon. This may you
effect also with the Gals of all beasts, although the Ox gall be especially
commended above all the rest. Secondly, put Horsleaches into them through a
pipe, whereby they may fall right upon the Pyles, for by nature they do draw
out the melancholicke blood, which is contrary to the boxing cups: Therefore if
there be boxing cups set upon it, then must they be fastened vnpickt, be it on
man or woman, and that between the priuities and the Arsegut. Thirdly, rub the
Arsegut with Fig leaves until it begin to bleed, in like sort may the powder
of Nep, of Marierom, of Fleawort, of Swines bred, and of Pepper, or any other
biting powder, as Cantharides and Esula: also Flammula may be laid thereon. But
if you will have milder things, then take the juice of Centorie, or water
wherein a good quantity of Mallows be decocted. Item, beaten Stauesacre
tempered with Honey. Fourthly, this is the most certain way, viz. that two or
three pyles be opened with the Flew, and to the end they may not shut suddenly
together again, like as their nature is, then use this salve following: Take
oil of Peach kernels, of Abricock kernels, (or the same kernels beaten) and
the juice of Garlic, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax as much as is
needful for to make a salve. But if so be that these inward Pyles cannot be
seen, then must the patient be required once to strain hard as if he would
go to the stool. Do not the Pyles as yet appear thereby? then let a box or
cup with a wide mouth be set upon the fundament: when these have plucked out the
Arsegut, then open a vein or twain that be fullest. Fifthly, use this salve
following: Take small beaten Aloe one quarter of an ounce, Ox gals one ounce,
Vinegar two ounces, temper them all together, put therein some Cotton, or wet a
cloth, and rub it well therewith. Item, take Centorie, Rapontica, Stauesacre,
Flammula, and white Neesewort, of each alike much, temper it with Ox gall, and
the juice of Onions; let it then dry, stamp it, and once again do as before.
Reiterate this four times together, when you will use this, then wash well the
Pyles with warm water, and temper the foresaid powder with Ox gall, and
annoint therewith the Pyles.

Another. Take two small Onions, four heads of Garlic, beat them together,
and temper them with the meal of Lupins, and with very eager Vinegar unto a
plaster, which will open the Pyles immediately.

Sixthly, make a long suppository of Swines bread, put it up into the fundament,
and keep it therein a whole night; if it come out, then put in another, until
the Pyles begin to bleed. Also with the suppositories of wild Cucumber roots
do the like. Item, take Coloquint three drag. bitter Almonds half an ounce,
sodden Honey three ounces, and make suppositories thereof, and use another every
five hours, so that the Pyles will then bleed immediately. Some do open these
veins with hot yrons, and some through Cauteries potentiall, as Arsenicum and
such like, but because they are perilous, it is better to rest with the former
remedies.

Against the pain of the Pyles.. 7.
IF so be that there be any impostume besides the pain of the Pyles outwardly
on the Arsegut, then must the patients Liver vein be opened on the right hand,
and this plaster following laid upon the Fundament thereby to assuage the
pain: Take the yolk of a roasted Eg, one dragme of Saffron, Opium half a drag.
Linseede meal, Wheat meal, the muscilage of Linseede, Butter, and Goats
suet, of each half an ounce, a fresh yolke of an Egg, Roses one dragme and a
half, Wax as much as is needful for to make therewith a soft plaster. Item,
take Hollihock roots six ounces, Lilly roots one ounce and a half, great
Mallows and Henbane, of each one dragme and a half, Cammomill one ounce,
Melilot and Dill seed, of each one quarter of an ounce: let these seethe well
all together, and stamp them to growt; then temper therewith Fenegreeke meal,
Linseede meal, and Barley meal, of each three quarters of an ounce, oil of
Sesamum one ounce and a half, Opium half a dragme: make thereof a soft
plaster, with the decoction wherein they were boiled.

Many kinds of Salues, against the pain of the Pyles.
TAke oil of the kernels of Abricocks one ounce, oil of Roses half an ounce,
Ducks grease, and washed Butter, of each three dragmes, Bdellium one quarter of
an ounce, melt it in the foresaid oils, Wax as much as is needful therewith
to make a soft plaster, Or take oil of Peach kernels, and oil of bitter
Almonds, of each one ounce, liquid Styrax, Bdellium, of each one dragme, temper
them well together, and therewith annoint the grief.

Item, take oil of Roses, oil of the yolks of Eggs, Ducks and Hens grease, of
each half an ounce, Wax three quarters of an ounce, melt them all together,
and use it like as the rest, covering it with warm clothes.

Item, take of that well known plaster Diachilon one ounce, oil of Roses
half an ounce, the yolke of an Egg, Saffron and Opium, of each one scruple,
temper it well together, and therewith annoint the place where the pain is.

Another. Take Opium one dragme, dissolve it in Rose water, make Cotton wet
therein, and lay it upon the Pyles, and keep it a little while therein, it
does presently assuage the pain. But note, that all these narchotick and
stupefactiue remedies must be applied warm unto it.

Item, take oil of Roses and Violets, of each a like quantity, and lay it
warm upon it with a woollen cloth. Or take oil of Roses and fresh Butter one
quarter of an ounce, the juice of Garlic one dragme, Bolus, Dragon blood, Gum,
Roses, Myrrh, and Pomegranat blossoms, of each two scruples, powne all that is
to be powned, and temper them all together. Item, take oil of Roses, and the
white of an Egg, of each a like much, with a few crumbs of bread steeped in
Milk, and a little Saffron tempred amongst it, and so use it. Item, take Vine
cute two quarts, and the yolks of two Eggs well brayed, Saffron half a dragme,
Cammomill powder, and Dill powder, of each one dragme, temper the^ together. Or
(that which is more marvelous and better) take the yolks of four Eggs, oil of
Roses three ounces, Saffron one dragme, temper them together: this is somewhat
stronger: Take the oil of water Lillies, Cammomill and Dill, of each one
ounce, Saffron one dragme, the yolks of three Eggs, Barley meal two ounces, let
these seethe together in two ounces of the juice of Lettice, until the juice
be wasted, then put thereto Henbane seed, and Opium, of each one dragme, and
lay it upon the Pyles.

Item, take the middle of corn roses, and temper it with the oil of Abricock
kernels unto a soft salve, and use it as the rest, for it is very good, and
approved.

Philonium Romanum rubbed on the Pyles asswageth the pain greatly. Item, take
fresh Butter, and oil of Violets, of each half an ounce, and beat amongst it
the white of an Egg. Or take oil of Roses, and Linseede oil, of each one
ounce, oil of Abricock kernels one ounce and a half, muscilage of Fenegreeke,
and of Linseed, Butter and Goats suet, of each one ounce, the yolks of three
Eggs, and Wax as much as is needful for a salve.

Another. Take Linseede, Hollyhock seed, Fenegreeke, Verbascum seed, S. John's
Woort, Mallows, and Hounds tongue, of each one handful, seethe them together
in water, and foment the place infected with a sponge, afterward annoint the
foresaid place with oil of Eggs, for every ounce and a half whereof, have one
grain of Opium. Or take Sallad oil as much as you think good, powned Chalk
as much as is needful therewith to make a plaster, it dries well, and
cools much. This can oil of Olives do also alone, being made warm, and
Sheep wool undressed dipped in it, and so applied unto the Pyles. Item, take
Verdigreace one quarter of an ounce, burnt Allume one ounce, dissolve them in
Wine, and then use it with Sheep wool. Or take Ducks grease, the fat of
Sheep wool, Goats suet, and white Wax, of each a like quantity molten
together. Item, take Hearts suet one ounce and a half, the grease of a Heronshaw
half an ounce, melt and stir them together until they be very white. This
next following is passing forcible for to assuage the pain: Take a great
Onion, make it hollow within, and fill it with Sallad oil, or fresh Butter:
afterward close it again, and roast it in the ashes until it be mellow, then
bind it on the Pyles. Also you must boil Onions to growt, and temper them
with Sugar, and use it as is said; they be both very good. Item, annoint the
Pyles with the juice of Rosemary or Cloves, and lay a Peach leaf upon it, this
asswageth much the pain. This following dries, and eases also the pain:
Take powned Housleeke two ounces, small bruised litharge of Gold one quarter of
an ounce, seethe them with fresh Butter to the thicknes of a salve. These two
salues ensuing do mollify the hardness, and take away the pain: Take Ducks and
Hens grease, of each one ounce, oil of Roses two ounces, Wax as much as shall
suffice: let them melt together, and cool afterward, then mix the yolke of
an Egg amongst it, and one dragme of Opium, and half a dragme of Saffron.

Item, take fine Bolus, Gum, Mastick, Dragon blood, Roses, and Pomegranat
blossoms, of each three dragmes, powne them all small, Butter one ounce, oil
of Roses three ounces, juice of Garlic three ounces, juice of red Saxifrage
four ounces, melt all that is to be molten, and temper the rest amongst it,
this alayeth the swelling, asswageth the pain, dries and heals all ulcers,
and it is also especial good for all clefts of the fundament.

Certain Powders for the same.
TAke Garden Snailes as many as you please, put them into a pot stopped tight,
and burn them at a potbakers oven to ashes, strewe these upon the Pyles, it
asswageth the pain forthwith: also it is to be assuaged with Egg shells,
wherein Chickens have been hatched, or with dried Cipers nuts powned to
powder, and strewed thereon, as before.

Of fomenting, bathing, and such like.
TAke Mallows, Hollihocke leaves, Violet leaves, Bearefoote, Garlic and
Parietarie, of each two handfuls, Cammomill, Amaranthus, of each one handful,
chop the herbs, seethe them in water, and place the patient lukewarm therein.
Or take Oken leaves, Houndstoong, Mallows and Cammomill, of each two handfuls,
Fenegreeke, Lineseed, of each one ounce, stamp and seethe them in water; then
make a spoonge wet therein, and so apply it warm unto the fundament. Also you
may lay these herbs following, being sodden, thereupon. Item, take small beaten
Pease, cast them on a hot stone, and receive the vapor from beneath: it swageth
the pain, it dries wonderously, and takes away all superfluous flesh. If so
be that the fume or smoke be noisome to you, then put some wine thereto. Item,
take Caruway, make it pretty moist with wine, cast it also upon a hot stone,
and receive the smoke, as aforesaid: or take Gariophillata and Lady mantle, of
each one handful, seethe it in a bag, and therewith foment the raines. This
has helped whereas the piles hang out a finger long, and it cannot hurt women
with child.

Take Venus hair and Water torch, of each a like quantity, butter as much as
you think good, let it sees all together, power the butter through a cloth,
and herewith anoint the pyles: it is said that this has helped the piles,
where the pain has continued twelve years long. You may also anoint the
piles with Ducks grease, wherein Colewoorts have been fried, be it before, or
after the bath.

Of the Piles which are called Verrucales.. 8.
NOte that this sort of Piles are called Verrucales, for that they be much
harder than the other, and therefore have more need of mollifying and
discussiue remedies: and those must be used according to the opportunity of the
time and the age of the patient. In the summer there is to be laid thereon
three yolks of eggs with oil of Violets, also sweet unsalted butter, or oil
of sweet Almonds tempered with muscilage of Lineseed, and Fenegreeke. If so be
then the pain be intolerable, then temper a little Opium, Mandragora, Henbane
seed, Poppie seed, or such like amongst it. The old Physicians describe very
many such like things for remedies, but these aforesaid shall be here
sufficient.

Of the Piles that do hang far out.. 9.
But when as the Piles do hang far out, and do so dry that they wax black
and stinking, then are they often to be anointed with warm butter, until the
blacknes be again clean: and if so be that such stinking moisture would
proceed further, then use the foresaid corsiues. But in case that this rotting
cease, then will it heal forthwith with the salve of Ceruse and such like.
There are also used sometimes for this hot irons. Also while they be green,
they may be cut off with a pair of sizers, and afterward the white of an egg
and oil of Roses laid upon it, to assuage the pain. But when they be old,
then it is safest that they be bound about with a silk thread, and so often
repeat the same till they die and fall away of themselves. The which
afterward is to be further healed with the salve Apostolorum, and to lessen
the pain, steep the silk thread or horse hair in Rose water before, wherein
is dissolved two or three grains of Opium. In the same manner may all other
warts of the body be driven away, whereof we will speak in the fifth part.

Here before in the common description of the Piles, we have rehearsed the
kinds of these grievous Piles. Through these Piles there is to be feared, when
they begin to corrode, that they may so infect the Arsegut, that there may
follow a Canker or Fistula, yea that which is more, if there follow a salt
defluxion to them, that the ways may be so dilated and opened, that the
patient might bleed to death. For this disease, there is great heed to be
taken, to forbear all hot meats, as Radishes, Mustard, Garlic, Onions, and
from all spiced meats. For this must he also abstain from all over cooling
and slimie things, as fish, dough, and all entrails, sinews, and skins of
beasts. Meetely good red wine shall be his drink. But if (as it often falls
out) there come any other Piles, then are such meats and drinks to be forborne
as make melancholic blood, as pottage of Beans and Pease: but red and white
Pease, and Turkey Beans may be eaten sometimes dressed with Sallad oil. Also in
this case the Median is to be opened, and five or six ounces of blood to be
let out, according to the strength and age of the patient. But if this letting
of blood may not be done for some causes, and that it be thought better to
apply Horsleaches, as is already said, that may safely be done; yet first make
the place moist with cold water, for then will they fasten the rather. When as
the Leaches be full, then fall they off of themselves: if not, then strike them
off with a twig, or burn the^ off with a Wax candle. But if after their
falling off the bleeding will not stanch, then lay this plaster following
thereon: Take Starch and Mill dust, of each one drag. fine Bolus, Dragon blood,
Aloe, Sarcocolla, Frankincense, Hypocistis, of each one quarter of an ounce,
the juice of Plantaine as much as is requisite, temper it in a leaden mortar
until it be very tough.

A plaster: Take of hard Pitch three ounces, Rosin and Isinglas, of each one
ounce, Dragagant, Gum, Sarcocolla, of each one dragme and a half, refuse of
Iron half an ounce, make a plaster thereof with red vinegar. This is for this
purpose as forcible a remedy as may be found: Item, take wood ashes two ounces,
Yarrow, Pellitory of the wall, Cammomill, and roasted Squils, of each two
ounces, burnt Allume one quarter of an ounce, red wine as much as is needful
for to make a plaster, and apply it warm. Item, take Yarrow, Parietarie, of
each one handful, Salt half an ounce, and use this daily. It is said also
that this for certain will cure the Piles, namely, Venus hair with
Aristologie beaten and tempered with red wine, and so continually used thereon.

This following is said to be infallible: Take the ashes of an herb which the
Germans call Roorwort, and roasted Squils, of each two ounces, honey as much as
is needful for to temper this withal; apply it, and it heals very speedily.

The confection of Iron dross de Scoria ferri, must be used six days one
after another, every morning one quarter of an ounce, and fast five hours upon
it. And if the Piles be without any affluxe of humors, or other accident, then
are you to use this following: Take oil of Abricocke kernels 3. ounces, liquid
Styrax one quarter of an ounce, four hard sodden yolks of eggs, prepared Iron
dross, Sandaraca and Sarcocolla steeped in woman's milk, of each one dragme
and a half, Musk three grains; bruise this a long time together, afterward
temper as much Barley meal amongst it as is needful for a plaster, anoint
therewith the Piles inwardly and outwardly. But if so be that ye patient have
need of any purging, use thereto those things that are ordained in the
description of the other Piles. Or take of the confection Diasena three
quarters of an ounce, temper it with whay of milk, and take it betimes in the
morning. After the purgation the Arsegut is to be anointed the next day with
these things next after following.

Take Swines bread, Cowslips, Bistorta, Dog fennel and red Saxifrage, of each
one dragme and a half, Alumen Iamenum one drag. oil of Abricock kernels and
Rosine, of each one ounce: temper them all together, and anoint therewith
four times a day, and lay this plaster following upon it.

Take the plaster Apostolicon that shall be hereafter described, half an
ounce, burnt Copperas, Frankincense, Colophonia and Orpiment, of each one
scruple: mingle it all together in a mortar, till that it be a plaster, with a
little dissolved Laudanum, but it may not be laid upon the fundament: but
whereas the least exulceration is, the vain exulcerated is to be anointed
with the foresaid salve, and if there come any scabs thereto, then must they be
oftentimes anointed with the oil of sweet Almonds.

The Plaster Apostolicon which is also called Triapharmacon, is described
after two manner of ways: the first is a good Triapharmacon, for that it is
made of three things, as follows.
TAke small Litharge of gold and vinegar, of each four ounces, Apostolicon.
old Sallet oil eight ounces, let them seethe so long together until all the
vinegar be sodden away, always stirring it about, till it be the thicknes of a
plaster. This plaster makes the flesh grow, and heals all wounds. Some put
amongst it one quarter of an ounce of Verdigrease, Wax and Turpentine, of each
as much as pleases them best, and when it is made, then it is called at the
Apothecaries Apostolicon.

The second: Take eight ounces of Sallad oil, small bruised litharge of gold
four ounces, Vinegar eight ounces, let it seethe well, and then put thereto
prepared Galbanum, Frankincense, Myrrh, Masticke, Tormentill, of each half an
ounce, Dragon blood three quarters of an ounce, Aloe two ounces beaten small,
Wax one ounce, then mingle them all together, and let it seethe to a plaster.

There are other means more to heal these kinds of Pyles, namely that they be
cut off where they be thinnest: But by reason that then they bleed much,
therefore it is more certain to take away the same with actual cauteries or
hot irons, which is not unknown to all Chirurgians, which is afterward better
to be helped.

Some take them away with potentiall cauteries or corosiues, as with powned
Anacardus, Orpiment, Arsenicum, and such like: afterward they lay salve thereon
that asswageth the pain; and mollify the escars with sweet butter, or some
other fatnes: But the binding, whereof we have spoken, is more certain.

Of the impostumes in the Arsegut.. 10.
IT happens also very well when that one comes to burn, cut, or corrode
these Pyles, that thereby the blood is staunched: which notwithstanding, for
that it cannot have his course, does sometimes putrify there, and
impostumateth, and causes also therewith great pain, heat, Agues and thirst:
for which these things following may be used. First, the Liver vein in the
arm on the side of the accident, is to be opened, thereby to diminish the
affluent blood. If the patient also be corpulent, then are boxing cups to be
set on his shoulders with pricking. Further, you are to bind the uppermost
parts of the body, and to chafe them, by reason that for this accident may no
purging medicines be used, to the end that thereby the matter may be drawn out
downwards. But if the great obstruction or binding of the body require any
purgation, then must the same be brought to pass with Clisters, and according
to the opportunity of the time, to open also a vein besides the Anckles, and to
use this salve.

Take oil of Abricocke kernels two ounces, Bdellium one ounce, liquid Styrax
one ounce and a quarter, fresh butter, Duckes grease, Starch, of each one
ounce, white lead one drag. and a half: temper it a long time in a mortar, and
make a salve thereof, annoint therewith this impostume when the gut is turned
and drawn forth, you shall find good ease thereby.

Secondly, take grease, Mallows, Fenegreeke seed, of Sesamum and Lineseede of
each six ounces; seethe them in water, strain them, stamp and temper them
with half an ounce of Rye meal, oil of Abricocke, unripe Sallad oil and
oil of sweet Almonds, of each one ounce, roots of Smallage, Elecampane
roots, of each half a dragme: lay this warm thereon, or set it thereon, that
it touch very well the Arsegut, it is very good.

Thirdly, if this impostume be not hereby sufficiently mollified, then use this
hereafter following: Take Sallad oil seven pounds and a half, sweet red wine
six quarts, Saffron one dragme and a half, Bdellium one ounce; seethe all
these together until the Gum be dissolved: herein shall ye patient be set 4.
times a day, being made luke warm, as deep as to his priuities.

Others use for such Impostumes as proceed of heat, this plaster: Take
Mallows and Nightshade, of each one handful, Violets and shaled Lentils, of
each two ounces; let this seethe till it be as thick as grout: afterward stir
it well about in a mortar, and mingle therewith oil of Violets, Roses and the
white of an egg, of each a like much, as shall seem needful for to make a
plaster: spread then thereof on the Arsegut, and lay over it.

Take white Lead five dragmes, Frankincense one dragme and a half, litharge of
gold one quarter of an ounce: This being beaten small, temper it with oil of
Roses, and therewith annoint the impostume, spread it on a cloth, and lay it
thereon.

Item, take the crumbs of white bread, or in the steed thereof three ounces of
Mill dust, oil of sweet Almonds two ounces, beaten Saffron half an ounce,
temper them one amongst another, and lay them warm upon it.

If there be a great heat present, then foment the impostume with Rose water,
Purslaine water, or water of Nightshade, and afterward apply this salve
following thereon: Take crumbs of white bread three ounces, oil of Roses two
ounces, Saffron, Opium, of each one quarter of an ounce, four yolks of Eggs,
fresh Butter one ounce, mix them well together, and use it as above. But if it
proceed of a cold cause, then use this following: Take Onions, Garlic, and
Woolblade, of each a like quantity, boil them till they be soft, and beat
them to a grout, afterward add as much Butter and oil of Cammomils as shall
suffice.

All that has been written before to assuage the pain, may be also used for
this: But note this, if so be the impostume begin for to maturate, then are you
to look to open it, to the end that the matter corrode not inward, and so
there follow a Fistula after it, which happens very often.

Afterward use this salve following for to finish the cure: Take burnt lead,
Cypers nuts, and prepared litharge of Gold, of each one dragme, Rosin one
ounce, oil of Mastick half an ounce, Wax three quarters of an ounce: first
melt the Rosin with the Wax, and when it begins to stream, then mingle the
foresaid powder amongst it: you may also strew the powder of Knotgras upon it,
for it dries much, and causes great alterations.

Of the Clefts that are called Rhagades.. 11.
WHat manner of infirmity it is, is sufficiently declared in the fifth Chapter
2.. These may proceed of five sundry causes in the Arsegut: as of the bloody
^lix called Dysenteria, of too hard excrements; of heat and drought of the
Arsegut; otherwhiles also of the Pyles that corrode inward; lastly, of some
outward inconveniences that cleave the Arsegut: the signs are pain, and
burning, and sometimes such clefts as may be seen, and do yield a black
green, or red stinking matter. There are also two sorts, the one with matter,
and the other without matter, whereof shall severally be spoken.

First for to cure those that are without matter, the party is first of all to
be purged (if need do require the same) and to open a vein, like as it is
told of the Pyles, and especially with Epithymo, Polypodie, and Whay, by reason
of the melancholic blood: also in like manner with the pills of Bdellio, or
with Clisters, and other like purgations. Afterward when these clefts do yield
matter, then are they often to be washed with water, wherein are sod Roses,
Polypodie, and Allume, and afterward annoint the^ with this salve following:
Take ashes of Muscle shells, and roots of Polypodie, of each two ounces, leaves
of the Olive tree half an ounce, poune them all small, and temper them with
oil of Roses, and if they be with inflammation, then use salve made with
Ceruse and Campher and other salues that follow hereafter. This following is
marvelous good, for it dries, cools, and also heals.

Take litharge of Gold, white lead and burnt lead, of each alike much, bruise it
in a leaden mortar with Rose water, oil of Roses, and whites of Eggs as much as
is needful, and with a little Campher, until that it be wholly black, anoint
the clefts therewith, and lay a cloth over them. If there be no heat thereby
but only a manifest drought, then take Hens and Ducks grease, marrow of Hearts
bones, and Calves bones, and the fatnes of Sheep wool, of each half an
ounce, fresh Butter, oil of sweet Almonds, oil of Poppie seeds, Dragagant,
oil of Lillies, and oil of Peach kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Myrrh, Starch, Mill dust, Momy, Frankincense, Mastick, Dragons blood, white
lead, and burnt Allume, of each one dragme, Wax one ounce and a half, melt
all these in the foresaid oil and fats, and make thereof a salve: this salve
asswageth the pain, moystneth and causes the flesh to grow.

Item; take yellow Wax, oil of Sesamum, Ducks grease, Marrow of Ox bones,
the fat of Cammels feet, or (in the stead of them) Goats suet, or Hens grease,
and Bdellium, of each a like much, melt these together in Muscilage of
Linseede, and temper them together, for it is very commodious. Item, take
Turpentine, Ducks grease, oil of Violets, of each two ounces, dissolved
Dragagant and Wax, of each one ounce, pouned Dragagant two ounces, temper them
by the fire unto a salve.

Or take muscilage of Licebane one ounce, Hens grease one ounce and an half,
the yolke of a new laid egg, Saffron one dragme, temper them one with an
other, and annoint the clefts therewith.

Another. Take Dragagant and Gall nuts, of each a like much; temper them with
molten Ox suet, and a little oil of Roses unto a salve.

But if the ulcers be deep, and yield much stinking matter, then are both
outwardly and inwardly sharp waters to be used for them, and especially dress
it with the remedies that are described in the first Part and the eight
Chapter, of the ulcers of the Nose, or strewe them with Verdigrease, and powned
Anacardus for to cleanse them. But note, that this corrosiue inwardly in the
Arsegut is not wholly without danger, unless the Arsegut be drawn out by a
boxing cup. Afterward cool and heal them with white lead, or any other
cooling and healing salve.

Item, take washed white lead, Aloe, Masticke, Frankincense, and Dragon blood,
of each three dragmes, oil of Roses one ounce and a half, Wax as much as is
needful. For this you may also use the salve that was before described, and
made in the leaden mortar, or prepare this following.

Take Pomegranate blossoms and the pills, Mirrhe, washed white Lead, burnt
Lead, washed Aloes, seeds of Roses, Frankincense, Masticke, Dragon blood, and
burnt Mussell shells, of each one quarter of an ounce, Olive leaves, burnt
Allume, Alumen plumosum, Verdigrease, and Litharge of Gold, of each one dragme
and a half, Wax one ounce, melt this in as much oil of Roses as is needful
to make a salve: use this often times, and wash the ulcers twice or thrice a
day with water wherein Gals, burnt Allume, Olive leaves and Roses are decocted.
These are very good for all such like diseases, being holden over the vapor or
dampe of water wherein Mallows, Hollihock roots, Violet leaves, and Bear
foot is sodden.

Of the Fistula and Canker in the Arsegut.. 12.
THis infirmity comes very suddenly into the Arsegut, and albeit it has
been accustomed (like as in other the like diseases in the body) to use
incision or an actual cautery: notwithstanding in this place it must be
utterly omitted, that there be no sinews hurt. For it might easily thereby
befall, that the patient afterward should never stay his ordure, but (against
his will) to let his excrements pass from him. The cause of these Fistulaes
may be the bad healing of the diseases in the Arsegut, be it of what cause
soever it may proceed. In like manner also through using of the Pyles badly,
or any other impostume that has not been opened in time, but that the matter
was left to stink or putrify therein, all which may cause fistulaes, as is
above said; amongst the which there are some that penetrate the Arsegut, others
the neck of the bladder, and some that remain always at a stay. These are
hereby discerned, that either the vrin, the ordure, or winds pass through the
Fistula. Also if the Muscles be therewith infected, then can he not retain or
stay his excrements, but as soon as it descends to this place it passes
from him.

If then these Fistulaes be moist and matterie, and the matter sharp and
stinking, and waxes from day to day bigger, then it is a sign of a depascent
Fistula, for the which strong remedies must be used to stay the same, that they
corrode not deeper: for it happens otherwhiles that these depascent ulcers will
consume the whole buttocks and all parts adjacent, and bring a body at the last
after many miseries to his lives end. But if so be that this Fistula corrode no
deeper, then must the same be cured with drying things, so that for a while
they neither run nor swell any more: but if so be the matter come to run
again, then must be done as before, and that so long as one lives. As
concerning then the curing of this Fistula, it must always be looked to, that
the hole be kept open, which may best be effected with the pith of an Alder
tree, dried Gentian roots, or Briony roots: afterward you must use those
things that are set down in the first part, the eight Chapter, and 11.. and
also afterward of the Fistula of the eyes. Some do commend two or three drops
of oil of Sulphur to be iniected into the Arsegut, which will have a
wonderful operation; and if so be that there follow any inflammation, that it
should be delayed with the white of an Egg, or fresh Butter. Fistulaes and
such like ulcers, are to be washed with Rosemary wine, for it cleanses and
keeps the ulcers clean, but of this Fistula will we entreat further
hereafter in the fifth part.

Of the itch in the Arse-gut.. 13.
THe causes of the itch in the Arsegut are four: First, that there remains
somewhat that is sweatie or saltish in the fundament, which causes the same:
Secondly, through the worms Ascarides, that have their being in the end of the
Arsegutte: Thirdly, some kind of ulcers that are in the lower part of the
gu^te: Fourthly, sharp humors, as it oftentimes happens through some
uncleanness that rests in the Arsegut, and then must the Arsegut be washed
with warm water, and be cleansed with clothes or wolblade leaves. But if the
same come thorough the small worms, then take a sharp Clister, yet not above
eight ounces in quantity: also dippe wool or any such like thing in soft
Pitch or Turpentine, then do the worms stick fast thereon; besides, the Pitch
does kill the worms by nature: or anoint a great taint with Bird lime, and
bind it on a thread that it may be drawn out again. You may also see in this
present part what has been written for the worms, but if the same be caused
through any ulcers, then use for it the white salve and others more: but keep
the ulcers always clean and dry with fresh clothes, wash the same
oftentimes with water wherein Agrimonie, Olive leaves, and such like are
decocted, put also burnt Allume thereto, and plume Allume, and bind clothes
over it, and keep your self quiet. But if this itch proceed of a sharp
matter, then use Suppositories with Opium, Clisters, and others, as shall
appear hereafter for the laske or looseness of the body.

The eleventh Chapter. Of the inward members of the third part.
IN the beginning of the third part of this our book of practice, we have
given to understand, how that therein are contained the Stomach, the Liver,
the Gall, the Kidneys, the Bladder, the Bowels, and in women the Mother or
womb; but because we have hitherto treated of the outward parts and their
accidents, therefore will we now discourse orderly of the inward members; and
first we will begin with the Stomach, for that the same is covered with the
Liver, and lies on the top thereof: for it has not only his beginning at the
mouth of the stomach, but is also the meat room or kitchen of all the other
members, and therefore will we (and that by good reason) place it before.

Of the Stomach in general.. 1.
Under the Diaphragma or Midriffe, between the Liver and the Gall on the right
side, and the Milt on the left side, that is, right in the midst of the body,
yet a little more on the left side, there lies the stomach, that is so
ordained by nature, for that the Liver might keep room and scope. The
Stomach is called of the Greeks Gaster, Col^a, and sometimes also (although
unjustly) Stomachus, and of the Latinists Ventriculus. It is ordained for a
receiver of the meat, to dress the same, and afterward, like as out of a
Cubbord, to impart all that is cooked, to each member his due, and that might
suffice for his sustentation and nourishment, and to send out all that is
unclean or not fit for the nourishment, through the bowels and other natural
passages as a superfluity. His substance is outwardly hard flesh, inwardly
compacted full of veins, rough, and with many pleites or folds, whereby it
draws the meat unto it. His form is long, and round, hollow within, and
like a Tun, to let pass easily that is received, wide beneath, and near the
mouth of the Stomach (which is properly called Stomachus, Oesophagus, and by
the Arabians Meri) it is narrow. In comparison of the bodies of beasts, it is
not big, so that thereby it does not much exceed the blind gut Intestinum
ca^cum, and is otherwise not much unlike to a dogs mawe. With the uppermost end
of the Stomach does it receive the meat, and with the lower end does it let
all that is digested fall into the bowels, from whence all superfluities are
cast out. Both these ends of the stomach, below and above, after that the
meat is received, do shut up most wonderfully, lest that the concocting and
digesting warmth should vanish away. For if in the mouth of the stomach there
were not such closing, then could not the meat be well digested: whereby then
must ensue a noisome vapor, and a diminishing of natural heat. So happens
also of the lower passage of the stomach, when as it, after the meat is
received, will not be shut up, a bad digestion and other diseases, as the
flux, etc. whereof we will hereafter speak more at large. But thus much we
would write in general of the stomach: Now will we proceed forward with
particular things.

Of the neck and mouth of the stomach.. 2.
THis passage, through which the meat and the drink descends out of the
mouth into the stomach, is properly one piece of the same: therefore will we
first write thereof, as of the beginning of the stomach. The neck of the
stomach is of the old Grecians, and now adays called by all learned men
Oesophagus, and unrightly Stomachus, and of the Latinists Gula, the which we in
English do name properly the upper part of the stomach, the neck: and the
neathermost part, the mouth of the stomach, which lies right in the pit of
the heart. So that both these parts have some difference, and that by reason of
their situation and for other causes more, even as also Galenus makes two
sundry Chapters of them. These foresaid neck and mouth of the stomach, are
subject to many diseases, be it out of heat, cold, drought, moisture, or of
any compounded complexion. Also through the obstruction of those parts, whereby
the meat is drawn into the stomach. Item, through impostumes, ulcers,
blows, wounds, and other inconveniences, all which may hinder the swallowing,
whereof much is written in the second part, the first Chapter,. 5.

But we will here only rehearse somewhat of the signs, and their difference.
When as now then the whole neck has any disease, then can the meat not be
but slowly swallowed. But if the disease be in a certain place of the neck,
then remains the meat sticking in the same place. But whether it come of
heat or drought, that shall be bewrayed by the drouth and thirst, for that
cold water is very acceptable unto him. But if so be it proceed of cold, then
has the patient neither heat nor thirst, but only an anguish in the throat.
If so be that one can hardly swallow through excessive moisture, then does the
same appear through much spettle and whiteness of the tongue. Or the same
comes through drought, that makes the drought of the tongue and the mouth
known, for the patient will drink continually, or wash his mouth with cold
water. If there be any impostume in these places, then have you the signs of
Squinancie therewith: whereof we in the second part, the first chapter, the 4..
have mentioned. Also when he would drink, then runs the drink out of the
nose: neither can he addict himself to lie, but seeks always to sit up.
Then comes this disease through blood Cholera, that may be known by the
pricking pain, also by the thirst, heat and Ague: and to the contrary, when
the same is caused through cold, then is the pain small, but with drought and
the painefulnes of swallowing is felt in more places then in the place of the
tumor. But if this impostume break out, then do they cast up matter, and are
very prone to vomiting, whereby also they lose their pain in swallowing.

These impostumes are also to be known, if that one do swallow down, Vinegar
or any other sour thing, or that is salt, not only into the neck of the
stomach, but also even into the shoulder blade.

Or if the same be caused through any cricke of the neck, then will the pain
also be known there: or there grows a bunch either before or behind. And if
so be that the same be caused through the crampe, then shut to the patients
mouth: and he shall feel the pain most of all in the Nipples, and on the
breast.

But before that we come to the remedies for this infirmity of swallowing, we
must prescribe some common rules: and first, because that the neck and mouth
of the stomach are tender parts, therefore heed must be taken that there be
not used for it any sharp or biting things, that thereby they be not grieved
nor hindered in their actions. Secondly, if these parts do ranckle, or get any
malady (like as often happens) then must all sharp, sower and biting things
he eschued, unless the same things be drying withal, yet very little, because
such sharp things do augment the same pain, do feeble the natural power, and
inflame the whole throat. Thirdly, if so be that the neck of the stomach be
over cold, then must plasters be laid upon the shoulders, and there about. But
if this coldness be in the mouth of the stomach, then must the plasters and
other things be laid upon the pit of the heart. Fourthly, if there be a hot
impostume with pain and a choleric body, then must he be let blood, purge,
and use other remedies, even as has been said in the description of ye
Squinancie. Fifthly, the remedies that are to be used for the healing of the
exulceration of the throat, and to incarnate, they are always to be tempered
with some tough slimie thing, to the end that they may cleave the faster in the
throat, and thereby also may have the better operation.

Now to come to the remedies: If that this impediment be only caused through
heat, or heat and drought, then purge the patient with sower Dates, Cassia,
and Manna tempered in some broth, wherein Prunes, Violets, and Figs have bin
sodden; for all these things do expel such matter, and moysten the throat and
the neck of the stomach, like as in this disease is required.

Therefore shall the patient (and that oftentimes) use sirupe of Violets, water
Lillies, and such like, and swallow the same leysurely.

There may also be made a sirupe of Prunes as hereafter follows: take four
or five Damask Prunes, Violets two ounces, seeds of Lettice, Endive, small
Endive, Purslaine, of each half an ounce, Sugar 18. ounces, make a sirupe
thereof, like as before in the Introduction is taught.

Beneath under the neck between the shoulder blades there must the patient be
anointed with cooling oils, or any such like plasters laid thereon, that are
tempered with oil of Violets, water Lillies, and oil of Roses: afterward
take wheat meal three ounces, the muscilage of Fleawort, juice of Housleeke,
of each one ounce and a half, juice of Purslaine one ounce, stamp them
together unto a plaster.

Take the juice of great and small Housleeke, Rose water, of each two ounces,
Melon seed, Lettice, Gourds, Cucumbers, Purslaine, and both kinds of Endiues,
of each one quarter of an ounce: let this sees al together unto a plaster,
then stamp them to growt, and use it as above.

If there be no drought thereby perceived, then may be put thereto red and
white Saunders and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, and one ounce of
Vinegar.

But if there be great drought therewith, then use the muscilage of Fleawort,
Dragagant, the seeds of Quinces, Violets, and such like: also he must eat cold
herbs (whereof the seeds are here above named) fried with Butter, and annoint
himself outwardly with all manner of beasts marrow. In like manner are also
very good for him conserues of Roses, the cold losinges of Dragagant, and
Diapenidion without spices, and new rere eggs.

These ensuing pills are also to be prepared, and to hold them continually in
the mouth, and lastly, swallow them down: Take Dragagant, Gum of Arabia,
Purslaine seed, Mallows, and Quince kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Licorice one dragme and an half, the gum of Cherry tree a dragme, make thereof
flat pills: Barley water and Buttermilke are good drink for this sickness, also
he may drink watered wine.

But if this impediment be caused through cold (like as most commonly happens)
and if so be that need require, then give to the patient some potions of
Sirupo de Pr^ssio, de Calaminta, or de Hyssopo, and purge him with Diaturbith,
or Hiera logodion, and if it be needful put a little Esula to it.

These tabulates shall he also hold in his mouth, and then swallow down the
juice of them, to wit, Dianison, Diatrionpiperion, Diaireos Salomonis,
Diapliris made with Musk, and such like. Upon the shoulders must he be
anointed with the oil of Costus, or with the oil of Rue.

For this is also good the salues Martiaton, Agrippae, and Altheae, whereupon
this plaster following is to be applied: Take Laudanum, the fat of Sheep
wool, Galbanum and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce, dried Mints, Sage, Indy
Spica, Spica Romana, and Cloves, of each one drag. Wax one ounce, oil of
Spikenard as much as is needful to make a plaster, spread it over a cloth
half a quarter of a yard, in compass four square, then draw it over with
Syndall, and lay it after the length from the neck to the ridge of the back.

Amongst other Medicines may also those be used, that shall against a cold
stomach be described hereafter, whence is to be taken also an order of life.

If that then this impediment in swallowing be caused through excessive
moisture, then i^ the first described order to be observed: but that is not
needful to expel such excess of matter, but to keep a sober diet in eating
and drinking: further, he must use this gargarisme following.

Take Cypers nuts, and the leaves, of each one handful, Frankincense and his
rines, one ounce of each, burnt Allume three quarters of an ounce, plume Allume
half an ounce; seethe this in a quart of Wine, and gargarise herewith,
afterward wash clean the mouth, but swallow it not down: or he shall use all
that in the first part, the thirteenth Chapter, and 6.. is taught, of the
swelling of the tongue.

If then a hot or cold impostume, or the Squinancie be approaching, then rule
you like as it is showed in the second part, the first Chapter, and 4.. of the
Squinancie: now we will go forward with the Stomach.

To preserve and keep a good digestion of the Stomach.. 3.
HOw much the health of man is sustained through a well digesting stomach, is
sufficiently known to all the world: and it is also very true, that if the
same receive no wholesome meat, it cannot digest it well, the which appears
in the disease of the stomach, that all meats must corrupt, the which may
evidently be discerned through the sickness that shall hereafter follow.

Therefore it is first requisite and necessary to prescribe a rule, how to
keep this good digestion in her full efficacy. And although in all places
hereafter, whereas shall be discoursed of any of the infirmities of the
Stomach, it shall be taught what shall be eschued or used: notwithstanding, it
cannot be but auayleable briefly to comprehend the same in these ten rules.
The first is, of the motion of the body, which (as follows) is much
commended. The motion of the body is a preservation of a man's life, a
quickening of natural heat, and an excitation of sluggish nature, a digesture
of all superfluous humors, a strengthening of all the members, an overthrow of
the diseases, a medicine for all anguishes, a gayning of time, renewing of
youth, of mirth, of old age, a pleasure, a help of health and blessedness, an
end of all infirmities, an enemy of sloth and lithernes, therefore do they
fear and shun all labor, that will want mirth, and if any body desire not
every day to eat he may keep himself from all labor.

This motion is most commodious for sober folks before both mealetides, if they
move not above their might: for when one begins to be weary, then must he
rest, and each one must exercise and stir according to the ability of his
body. The men of occupations have exercises enough about their occupations;
but if any one at any mealetide have surfetted, then must he fast the next day,
and use temperate motions, to consume all superfluity through abstinence and
exercise.

All people that have great exercise, may much better digest gross meats,
then they that are idle and live at ease, whereby may easily be discerned the
virtue of motion.

The second is of the property of meats, that they be not too hot of nature,
or too cold, whereby they may not inflame the natural heat, or might
ouercoole it, the which is also to be understood of all other qualities of
meats. Secondly, providence must be had that all meats be well boiled, sod,
and roasted, otherwise can the stomach not digest it as it behooves.

Thirdly, binding things eaten before other meats, they bind the body, like
as if they be eaten after the same, they loose, and are laxatiue. Fourthly,
light meats are, Barley well sodden, well baked bread, small Fishes,
Partridges, Phesants, and such like. Fifthly, meats that are acceptable to
nature, will be the more willingly received by the stomach, and also digested.
But this is only to be understood of healthful persons, and of them that use
the same moderately: otherwise, that is not always good which is pleasant to
the mouth. Sixthly, although the subtle and light meats do less molest
digestion, and are requisite for health, yet are they nevertheless nothing the
stronger or apter for labor, therefore they pass all others herein, that feed
on gross meats. Seventhly, would or might any one not eat such healthy
meats altogether? then is he notwithstanding to do the contrary as seldom as
he may, tempering with some wholesome meats, like as men do pepper and wine
with Mushrimps, and Spices or Garlic with Fish, etc. Eighthly, slimie meats
tarry long in the stomach, before that they pass into the bowels. Bread with
his bran goes much sooner into the bowels, than where the bran is boulted out.
Ninthly, flesh broyled on the gridiron gives good nourishment when it is
digested: but it goes slowly toward the guts. Tenthly, Pullet broths do delay
the humors more than Hen broth, yea and give much more nourishment.

The third rule depends on the quantity of the meats, whereof too much must
not be taken in least they make some grief or wind in the body. Secondly,
much meats do not moysten thoroughly, but only those that be without
sharpness, sowernesse, saltness, and bitterness. Thirdly, when any body has
taken much meat and drink, and thereby finds some weakness or drought in
the stomach, he shall then the other day afterward fast, and sleep the more
in a temperate place. Fourthly, a hail man shall take even so much meat, as
shall not grieve him. Fifthly, all they that live lasciuiously and riotously, do
die before their old age. Sixthly, great bodies have need of more meat and
drink than small bodies: they require also more heat and vital spirits for
their sustentation. Seventhly, much and many meats taken at one time be
prejudicial two manner of ways: first, by reason of the variable digesture,
as when light meats are mingled with gross meats: secondly, for that it is
seen, that there is more eaten of that which is pleasant in taste, than with
moderate feeding would suffice.

The fourth rule contains a good diet, whereby the meat is not to be
tempered with the medicine, for that it were an unmeet cost, when as the seeds
of wild Saffron, Nettles or wild Time should be mingled amongst meat, that
spoil the meat, hurt digesture, and drive it into the bowels before the body
have his nourishment out of it.

Secondly, gross and hard meats are to be eaten always at the first, and
afterward the light meats. Thirdly, if one do eat mild and moist things at
the first, and then afterward hard meats, then do the light meats run
quickly through the stomach, and lead the hard gross meats away with them
undigested. Fourthly, all they that be loose of body, are to take at the
beginning of their meal tides binding things and spices: and if not, then are
they always first to take that which will quickly pass through the stomach,
and lead the way to other meats.

To this end are Melons, Peaches, and other fruits to be eaten before one eat
bread or flesh: for that when as they which be harder do hinder the passage,
then is the digestion spoiled, and so it is with all other kinds of meats.
Fifthly, meats which be of this nature that they do not easily pass through,
or without requisite digestion, then must the gross meats be first taken, and
the light meats last of all: as Mutton before Birds, and Beef before Mutton.
For the bottom of the stomach by reason of his heat, has more force to
digest the gross meats first, than the top or upper part of the stomach.
Sixthly, milk and sower things are not to be eaten above once, for that the
milk runs into the stomach, whereby the digestion is hindered. Seventhly,
Butter, milk, and Radishes, are not meet together, nor yet with any birds:
for the birds having subtle flesh, will be spoiled through the sharpnes of the
Radishes. Eighthly, sodden wheat in flesh broth or in water, is not to be used
after Rice, for that both of them be of gross nourishment, and do obstruct the
ways. Ninthly, Vinegar, Oil, and all manner of fatness are not at any hand
to be kept in Copper vessels, for that they do draw the venomous nature of the
Copper unto them.

The fifth rule contains the time, that in the winter and spring more meat is
behoouefull than in the summer: for that then the stomach is at the very
hottest. Secondly, that there be nothing eaten until the former be digested.
Thirdly, in the winter, things be not tolerable to be eaten which do little
nourish, as herbs, and such like, but compact and strong meats are to be used,
which be long in digesting. Fourthly, in summer is the most fit time to eat
before the heat comes, and in evening when the heat is past. Fifthly, in the
spring is one to eat but little at dinner, and in summer nothing at all. In
the harvest fruits do bring many sicknesses with them: but in the winter one
may eat his fill.

The sixth rule prescribes a diet for every complexion. First, he is not to
forbear meat which is hot and dry of nature: for there is nothing more
hurtful unto him than abstinence. Secondly, for to preserve and keep a good
digestion, those meats are to be used which do best agree with every ones
complexion: to wit, if any be warm by nature, that he then feed upon meetely
warm meat, and so the like for dry and moist bodies. Thirdly, if so be that
heat do increase in any one, then must cool things be taken for it. Fourthly,
a melancholic man must feed upon moist things and somewhat warm: A
choleric body cold and moist meats. Fifthly, all that be hot and dry of
nature, and do much exercise, for them are all light and subtle meats very
hurtful.

The seventh rule does yield a reason of repletion and inanition, whereof is
first to be marked, that how much the more you feed an unclean body, so much
the more does the same annoy and hurt it: for when the meat is mixed with the
corrupted humors it is then also corrupted: the same happens also unto them
who have the stomach full of bad humors. Secondly, no man ought so to
ouercharge himself with meat, but that he might feel still some hunger.
Thirdly, when one has filled himself well the one day, although he might the
next day feel some hunger, yet is he the next day to forbear as much as is
possible, and to sleep in a temperate place. Fourthly, when any accustometh to
eat flesh and to drink wine, and does not l^bour at all, the same person (to
the end he may be discharged) is the oftener to be let blood. Fifthly, there is
nothing worse than when one has fed on strong meats, before they be digested
to eat again: for when as the one meat comes to the other undigested then
do they both spoil. Sixthly, all they who after dinner take their supper upon
it, must then fast out the same. Seventhly, all that do live soberly, and after
much eating and drinking do fast again, they live the longer. Eighthly, all
rioters and great drinkers must sometimes force themselves to vomit, and betake
themselves therewith for to fast it out, and to sleep a day times.

The eight rule comprehends the drinks: which first are not to be used so
much that the meat come not to swim in the stomach, for thereby will the
digestion of the stomach be spoiled. Secondly, albeit some be of opinion, that
me^ ought not to drink to their meat, yet do they speak against all skill;
therefore be they not to be heard. For one ought to drink, that the natural
heat be not aggrauated. Thirdly, when he feels good thirst, and when as the
heat of the stomach requires the same, the which never happens to such as
be hail but when they do either eat or do great labor, and after a long
Easterly wind. Fourthly, all sharp, new, gross and sweet wines, likewise,
all they which are kept in Sulphured caskes, and also all Must ought to be
eschewed if so be that they be not used for medicine. White, clear, thin, red
and pallet wine which is not troubled, and of a good taste, drunken moderately,
is very healthie: but to water them much is very noisome, because that thereby
is made gripings in the belly, windiness in the stomach, tumor in the milts,
and spoyleth the digesting of the stomach.

The ninth rule is of the customs. First, all they that be wont or accustomed
to eat much, and that of all manner of gross meats, shall not only
altogether rely on the strength of their stomach: for they shall not be able
to escape the harm which they shall feel thereby in time to come, because
that thereby bad humors are increased in the body by little and little.
Secondly, the custom of eating once or twice a day, and if that thereby men
remain healthie, it is not good to alter it: for that custom (as is wont to
be said) is nature it self. Thirdly, good and tolerable custom is to be
continued. Notwithstanding, if one were wont to be drunk every day, or to
drink in the morning fasting, who is it that can commend the same? Even so is
sobriety to be adjudged of, and fasting. It is also to be understood, that all
they who be wont to eat twice a day, and would accustom themselves to eat
but once a day, that the same might cause some inconvenience unto them, and so
to the contrary: for the stomach cannot tolerate it. Fifthly, all they that
use to eat at a certain hour, and should suddenly alter it, do stand in
danger that the same will not prosper well. Sixthly, although that the
accustomed meat and drink be such that it be not much to be commended:
notwithstanding it ought not slightly to be changed into other meats and
drinks which be taken to be healthier.

The tenth rule requires the dressing of meats: to wit, that each meat be
boiled, roasted and dressed as it ought to be, so that the stomach get no
loathing thereby, and the same meat may the better be digested. Thirdly,
delicate sawces for each meat in particular provoke one to eat more than is
good for him: therefore they ought to be omitted and forborne. Fourthly,
stinking and putrified meats, be it fruit, flesh, fish, or whatsoever else,
howsoever they be dressed, can bring none other but badnes with them.

Hereof is now sufficiently spoken for the preservation of good digestion, and
how the bad digestion of the stomach is to be amended. For that what might
fail therein, these sicknesses following sufficiently do declare.

Of the debilitie of the stomach in general.. 4.
OF these debilities or infirmities of the stomach there be three principal
accidents under which are all other comprehended. The first the Grecians do
call Bradypepsian, which is slow digestion. The second Apepsian, which is when
the stomach cannot digest. The third Dyspepsian, which is when the digestion
is utterly spoiled, and the meats do turn into bad humors, which is when the
stomach is wholly weakened and departed from his natural actions, and has lost
the same: which default may be provoked through inward and outward causes: the
outward causes be the motions of the mind, as anger, care, sorrow, rough
winds, and gross meats which be hard of digestion; as old beef, hard, old,
and unleavened bread, Hasell nuts, old Cheese, cold herbs and fruits whereof
has been used much a long time, as Gourds, Melons, Mushromes and Apples etc.
Item all excess, windy meats and drinks, pottages, Mustes, and all overmuch
watered wine, or water dronken alone (if it be not in great heat) and to eat
before the former meat be digested.

Item, blows or falls in and about the stomach, bathing in very hot or cold
times: also inward and outward heat and cold of nature, great exercise,
extreme venerie which infee^l^th much and weakeneth the natural powers.
Likewise overmuch sleep and rest: also to study too much, and straight after
meat.

The inward maladies of the stomach be these; over great heat, cold, drought,
moisture, winds, impostumes, and such like: Also through the infirmities of
other parts; as if out of the brains there do fall any rheumes into the
stomach, or when the heart beats, the liver is obstructed with any choleric
humors, the Milt with melancholicke humors, and the stomach is too much over
charged. When as then the property of each member is weighed, then may easily
be discerned what annoyeth the stomach.

If then the debility of the stomach be caused through heat, that is to be
known by the stomach: also there is evermore thirst with it, and all cold
things are welcome to the patient, and hot things are loathsome.

Or if this debilitie do come through any slimines, then is there heauynes in
the stomach, drought, bitterness, and wambling. When as this proceeds of
cold, that may the stomach find: for that the thirst is small, the digestion
little, and no desire of meat: warmth is welcome, but cold is tedious unto
him. If it be of phlegm, it is known by drowsines, swelling, much spettle,
quick passage of the meat through the body, and almost after the manner of one
that has taken somewhat he does belch with a sour taste, and such like. But
if this infirmity of the stomach do come of any melancholy, then is there
also drought, heaviness, and wambling with it, the teeth will be loose, the
patient will be plagued with unnatural lust of eating, the Milt does swell
whereof great heaviness does follow of the mind. If so be that the same be
caused through drought, then insueth great thirst thereby, drought of the
tongue, binding in the body, vnlustines, and harm through dry meats. If it
be caused through moisture, then is there little thirst with it, but loathsomnes
of all moisture; all drought does good to the patient, and there is much
spetting with it. Or if these humors be mixed, that is easily to be perceived
through the signs aforesaid; like as every accide^t brings with it a proper
description.

But before we come to any particularities, we will here discover one thing,
which is so renowned that it can preserve the stomach from all diseases, and
suffers nothing to putrify therein, because it expels all humidity and
uncleanness from the stomach, and cleanses the same: they which use it often
get never any more pain in the stomach: it causes mirth, it strengthens
the heart and head, it cleanses also the raines and the womb exceedingly: which
are the pills of Amber called de Succino, which are thus prepared: Pills of Amber.
Take the white or other Amber and Masticke, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Aloe five dragmes, Agaricus one dragme and a half, right Aristology half a
drag. this being all beaten small and tempered with the sirupe of Wormwood,
make thereof a mass of pills, and form seven pills of one drag. Take always
two or three of them when you go to bed.

Of a weak stomach through cold.. 5.
FIrst this is to be noted, that (to speak naturally) the stomach in the
summer and in the harvest is coldest of all, and that by reason that the heat
is drawn into the outward members, and therefore is so much the weaker about
the stomach. Contrariwise (as we have mentioned before) the stomach in the
winter and spring time is hottest of all, because the outward cold drives the
heat inward: and therefore then people are to eat so much the more. For in
the debilitie of the stomach regard must be had of the times. Now for to write
of the coldness of the stomach, so it is, that (besides all the foresaid signs)
the meat will scarce settle it self in the bottom of the stomach, so that
the same otherwhiles after the patient has taken it, has no rest ere and
before he has vomited out the same again undigested: and although it be
digested, yet happens it slowly. Also if one feel with the hand thereon
outwardly, then may it be perceived to be cold there: It is also full of wind
which is expelled upwards and downwards. There be yet more other signs
herebefore rehearsed of a cold stomach: When as then the cold of the stomach
is small and of no continuance, then is the patient every morning to take
Trociscos de Rosis two or three dragmes in an ounce of Miua cydoniorum wherein
Comin and Ameos be boiled.

Trocisces of Roses.
The aforesaid Trocisci are thus to be prepared: Take Roses three dragmes,
Lignum Aloes, Masticke, Indie Spica, Cassy wood, Squinanth and Wormwood, of
each one drag. beaten altogether small, and tempered with old wine, and then
formed. These Trocisci are very good taken with half an ounce of the spirit of
wine.

They are also to be fed with light meats, which have but little moisture and
superfluity: Also their meat must be strewed with Galingall, Pepper, Ginger,
Cloves, Ameos, and such like.

Before meat the patient is to exercise himself well: they that use this
water, must always drink more thereof after meat than before. After meat he
must sleep much, and drink neat old Renish wine; but eat less than he was
wont, for the weakness of the stomach cannot digest much meat. Meats which
be requisite for him are Muttons, Kids, Hens, Pullets, fowls, Partridges,
Fesants, Pigeons, Quails, and such like; yet rather roasted than boiled and
dressed with spice: also rere eggs and such like. But if this weakness of the
stomach has long continued, then may be used one of these Sugar plates
following (which one will) one quarter of an ounce or more at once. Or if so be
that it be made after the manner of a conserve, then to take one ounce at a time
daily with wine: viz. Diatrion Pipereon, Diagalanga, Dianison, Diamentha,
Caryophilatum, Rosata nouella, Diacyminum, Diaolibanum, also the warm
Dragagant cakes, the which also do strengthen the stomach and procure
digestion. But especially is the Confection Diacinamomum commended for a
blessed medicine for all moist, bad, and spoiled stomachs, as that consumes
all superfluous humiditie, helps digestion, and strengthens the eyesight,
therefore be there two sorts here described.

Confectio Diacinamomi.

and there the same be discovered, for which purpose it is also prepared after
sundry sorts, like as be some here expressed.

ounces of Sugar, decoct them in Rose water as is accustomed. Thus is this
confection at the Apothecaries made, and not only for his pleasantnes, but also
for his commodiousnes used daily; for that besides that it does strengthen the
weak stomach, and comfort the heart, the brains, the head, and the Liver;
it drives out also the b^^ and superfluous humors of the stomach: it helps
the digestion of the stomach, and especially in them which be a foot again
after a long continued and lingering sickness.

Confected Annis seeds are also very good for all debilitie of the stomach, it
helps digesture, it expels the pain and wind of the stomach, the same
does Fennel seed also. But there is yet a better for this, to wit, confected
Comin and Caruway seed, for that the same have also power to warm the stomach.

Certain Powders for meat.
TAke prepared Coriander, and Cinnamome, of each half an ounce, long, white,
and black Pepper, Cloves, Galingall, and Ginger, of each one dragme and a

Some do take the four seeds confected with Sugar: other do let them to be all
together confected with Sugar, that it might be so much the more pleasant to
take. Some temper amongst it cut Cucumber roots, because that they (besides
all their virtues) cause the winds to depart, and dry up bad humors. Item, take
Licorice cut small one ounce, Galingall one quarter of an ounce, Calmus half
an ounce, Mace three dragmes, Cinnamome and Nutmegs, of each one dragme and a
half, confected Annis seeds four ounces, Caruway, Fennel, prepared and

These foresaid stomachicall compositions are very commodious for the common
people, and also commodious for all the foresaid infirmities, but especially
the Gentian does expel all slime and venomous matter of the stomach. This is
to be used in the morning on tosted bread, mollified or soke^ in Wine, and to
fast three hours afterward.

In like manner you shall find before in the first part the twelfth Chapter
and first. a good Medicine for the stomach, which may be well added unto these:
Calmus and Cinnamome tempered together are also special good for this purpose.

This Confection following is also highly commended for all feeble, cold, and
moist stomachs, as also for the strengthening of the Liver, Milt, Heart,
Brains, and whole body: it increases Venerie, makes fat and merry, and is

use thereof about the weight of half an ounce always before meals: with this
also ensuing may be made a plaster to lay over the stomach, to wit,
Mithridate, Treacle, and Diatessano. They are also good for a weak stomach,
for that they dry and further the digestion of the stomach, if one take thereof
one drag. in a draught of Wine.

All confected things, as Roots, Fruits, and all such like, which be warm of
nature, are good for a cold stomach, as is confected Ginger, which not only
warmeth the stomach, but also all inward parts, and does restrain the vapors
from ascending and drawing up toward the head. Calmus is passing good for a
cold stomach. Elecampane roots also strengthen the stomach, help digestion,
drive out all venomous humidities, and warm the same. Confected Nutmegs do
consume all moisture of the inward members, they do warm and strengthen the
stomach, and are good for the digestion of the same. The like do also confected
Orange pills, Citron pills, roots of Eringus, and Walnuts, all which be
described in the last part of this our book of Physic. The herbs and flowers
which be warm by nature, are Eyebright, which is also very good against all
Agues that be caused of putrefaction. Conserve of Betonie, and of Gillofloures
do the like also, if that one take thereof half an ounce or more daily before
meals. They do also stay the ascending vapors of the stomach, and strengthen
the same. The like also does conserve of Marierom, Hyssop, Piony, Sage,
Lauender, Spikenard, and Rosemary.

All aromaticall Wines are much commended for this, not only for the stomach,
but also for all other parts to be used outwardly: They do also take away the
insatiable hunger. Secondly, there can be thought no better thing for the
stomach than good old strong wine for common drink: But if the same cannot be
had, then may be used in the stead thereof, some Meade, or Honey water. In like
sort also Miua aromatica, and other sirupes more, which shall be described
hereafter.

The rich and very dainty persons may also get Hippocras made, whereof you
shall find many kinds described in the eight part: Stelladia.
especially this following called Stelladia is used much in Italy. Take
Cinnamome, and Cloves, of each one drag. Pepper, Grains, and Galingall, of
each one drag. and a half, Cardamome one drag. and a half, one quart of Wine,
Sugar or Honey, as much as you please: make Hippocras thereof, as is taught in
the eight part.

Amongst the most used Wines made of Herbs, are these ensuing warm of nature,
Wine of Eyebright cleanses the stomach of all humiditie, withstandeth the
Ague, and is of a temperate nature.

The Wine of Hyssop warmeth also the stomach, and all inward members. The like
do also Rosemary wine, and Marierom wine, which also provoke appetite.
Asarabacca wine and Wormwood wine, are very good, especially if there be any
Mastick decocted in the common wine. Betonie wine and Gillofloure wine are very
good against windines. The herb Bennet wine and Clary wine, are also very good
for this purpose. Item, take Must as much as you think good, let it work
four days one after another, then put therein a small bag, with the leaves of
the right wild Vine, and let them also work together as before, whereof will
be a very pleasant wine. You have the like before in the second part, the sixth
Chapter, and 5.. of the panting of the heart through cold, a spiced wine,
beginning thus: Take Ginger two ounces, etc. What a virtue also the Elecampane
wine has (which is very common) shall be amongst other discovered in the eight
part.

Here have you also some mo such like drinks for a proof: Take sirupe of
Mints one ounce, Cinnamome water three dragmes and a half, oil of Cloves two
drops, oil of Vitrioll three drops, temper all together. The oil of Vitrioll
is very sharp and perilous, as is rehearsed in the description thereof.

Take water of Currants four ounces, temper therein as much Saffron as the
bigness of a Pease, drink it lukewarm in the morning, likewise also after
noone and after supper: it is especial good against all pain of the stomach.
The wine may also be tempered with Currants water. Item, sees Wormwood in wine
or water, and drink it: it is very good for poor folks.

Item, in the second Part the fifth Chapter and 5.. you shall have a pectorall
water, beginning: Take new Figs, etc. which also does cleanse the stomach from
all excessive humiditie. In like manner does also a forcible Capon water in the
second Part the sixth Chapter, and 4.. which does strengthen the stomach and
the heart marvelous mightily. Charuell water, La^ks spur water mixed, or each
apart, strengthen the stomach.

The vital waters and other waters are very requisite also for this, whereof
many be described in the eight Part.

Of sirupes which do strengthen the stomach. Sirupe of Citron peeles does
strengthen and help digestion, sirupe of Wormwood does make appetite, sirupe
of Mints is good for all diseases of the stomach which proceed of cold,
sirupe of Fumitorie helps all obstruction. Oxymel Compositum and of Squils be
good to break all tough slime. Ginger and Calmus steeped in wine or vinegar
are also very good, if one eat a spoonefull thereof. Some do put Gentian
roots unto it, for such as can away with bitterness. Also twice a day you may
eat six or eight peeled Almonds, therewith to dry the stomach, and every
third day once to eat a few water Cresses tempered with wine. Also if there be
any new Figs to be had, then eat four or five in the morning fasting.

Amongst all these foresaid remedies there be many which may be used as well to
the old, as the new diseases of the stomach, like as each one may know for to
rule himself thereafter.

What then belongs to the order of life we have spoken thereof at the first:
but if need were (whether it be of superfluous moisture, binding the body, or
other debilitie of the stomach) to purge, then must good heed be taken of such
things as be contrary to the stomach, and might distemper it: to wit, wild
Saffron seed, Polypodie roots, and seeds of Palma Christi, (which are enemies
to the stomach, and accounted but Quacksaluers remedies) but in this is
prouidently to be dealt, and after the taking of some preparatiue potions, he
is to use the last mentioned Sirupes, or these ensuing, and such like
purgations. Take Hiera Picra one ounce, Turbith half a dragme, Ginger one
scruple, and three ounces of the before mentioned wines. Make also a potion
thereof: also there may be put into this a little Cinnamome for the tastes sake.

Another.

sirupe of Ireos and Rubarbe, of each half a dragme, Spica two grains: both
beaten small, temper them with Decoctione Fructuum (which is described before
in the third Chapter 5..) wherein some Spikenard is decocted. If you had rather
use pills, then take pills De Agarico, Hierae Picrae, or Indae.

Item, other that be less laxatiue, and do strengthen the stomach. Take
Mirobalani Chebuli and Indi, Rubarbe, Cinnamome, Cardamome, Cloves, and
Galingale, of each one dragme, Aloe one dragme and a half: these being beaten
small together, temper them with the juice of Mints wherein Agaricus has been
four and twenty hours steeped: of these pills may one swallow two or three
morning and evening, especially if the pain of the stomach have long endured.
These following do strengthen and assuage the pain of the stomach: Take
Pillulae Alephanginae one dragme, Opij and Beuercod, of each one grain, make
five pills thereof with Oxymel. Item, take washed Aloe one scruple, and make two
pills thereof: take them one hour before meat, and especially before that he

Pills which will not purge, but only strengthen.
TAke beaten Mastick and the juice of Wormwood, of each a like quantity, set
it covered close in a warm place until it be dry, that one may make pills of
it, whereof every day two hours before noone, you may take one pill.

quarter of an ounce, Wax, Laudanum, Ammoniacum, of each one drag. oil of
Spikenard as much as suffices for a plaster.

Here follows now all that is to be outwardly applied upon the Stomach.
TAke a great Onion and make it hollow, and put therein Saffron flowers about
one dragme and a half: this Onion must then be wound in wet towe, and
afterward roasted in ashes. This being done, you are to make it clean, and
stamp it to pap: lay thereof upon a cloth the thicknes of a finger, and then
lay it upon the pit of the stomach, and as often as it is cold, take another
again which is warm. This is passing good for a cold stomach.

Also you may sees Masticke in Wine, and of this Wine must you lay upon the
stomach with a cloth, as warm as you can suffer it.

Item, unwashed Sheep wool kemmed must you let soke upon thick red Wine,
wherein is oil of Spikenard, and so laid warm upon the stomach, the same
takes away the pain of the stomach. Or steep the foresaid wool in oil of
Mastick, oil of Wormwood, or oil of Spike, then wring it out, and so lay it
very warm upon the stomach.

Another. Take Ginger, Mints, Southernwood, Costus roots, to wit, the sweet
root, Wormwood, wild Thyme, and Mastick, of each half an ounce,
Frankincense one quarter of an ounce, Spikenard, Cloves, Lignum Aloes, Cassy
wood, of each half a dragme: let all these sees together in nine ounces of
Sallad oil and three ounces of good Wine, until the Wine be clean consumed:
afterward strain it through a cloth, and then lay it upon your stomach like
as is before said.

For this is also very good Pellitorie of the wall, with oil of Spike, of
Mastick fried, one drag. of Saffron put thereto: likewise a Swallows nest
boiled in Wine, until it be clean thorough mollified and dissolved, and so
laid warm upon the stomach. Or take water of Mints, Wormwood and Malmsey, of
each six ounces, Cloves, Mints, Cinnamome, Lignum Aloes, Galingall, of each
half a drag. temper them all together, and make a piece of felt wet therein,
and so lay it warm upon the stomach, like as is taught before.

Item, carry upon the stomach a young naked Child, or in stead of him a young
naked Dog: they do both of them warm the stomach, and strengthen the same. The
same does also a Cushion of fine feathers: likewise also a warm hand holden
upon the stomach. It is also found good to rub the stomach with vital waters.
One may also make a cloth wet therein, and so lay it warm upon it.

Bags to be laid upon the Stomach.
TAke Mints, Wormwood, wild Vine leaves, Rosemary, and Peniroyall, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Cloves four scruples, Nutmegs, Mace, Masticke, of
each two scruples, Galingall half a drag. Roses and prepared Coriander, of
each two scruples, Gallia Muscata one drag. beat them all together gross, and
make a bag with it.

Another: Take Wormwood, Mints, wild Vine leaves, and white Mints, of each
one drag. Cloves one drag. and a half, Nutmegs and Mace, of each two scruples,
Galingall half a drag. prepared Coriander and Roses, of each two scruples and

to apply unto the stomach. Or take this next following: Take Lignum Aloes,
Wormwood, white Mints, Betony, Mastick, Frankincense, Cypers roots, Costus
roots, Caruway, Fennel, Roses, and Briony, of each one drag. Iuiubes, Mace,
Cinnamome, Cloves, Spica, Nutmegs, white and long Pepper, of each half a drag.
Calmus, Cassy wood, and red Corrall, of each two scruples: this being all
beaten gross, make a bag thereof for the Stomach.

Ointments and Oils for all cold Stomachs.
TAke oil of Masticke, Wormwood, Spikenard, of each one ounce, Cloves,
Masticke, Ameos, of each one drag. beat them well together, and make an
ointment thereof. Item, take oil of Mastick, and of wormwood, of each one
ounce, oil of Mirtles half an ounce, Cloves, Cinnamome and Galingall, of each
half a drag. Lignum Aloes and Ginger, of each one scruple; make an ointment of
it with a little Vinegar. Or take Roses five drag. Wormwood one quarter of an
ounce, Spica one drag. Cloves two scruples, long Pepper half a drag. Masticke,
rumpled Mints, of each one drag. these being well beaten, then take oil of
Masticke three ounces and a half, oil of Roses six ounces and a half, Wax
one ounce and a half, (but the oil and the wax must be leysurely molten
together) and then temper the rest together unto an ointment, wherewith you are
to annoint all the breast very warm. And if it be in winter, and that the
party must go abroad, then lay upon the breast anointed two or three leaves
of writing paper, for it preserves natural heat, and defends the stomach
from all outward cold.

Another: Take distilled oil of Masticke; or in the stead thereof oil of
Cammomill, Wormwood, Mints, Quinces, and Roses, of each one ounce and a half,
Mace, Masticke, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cardamome, Grains, Galingall, and Lignum
Aloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Coral, prepared Coriander, Roses,

bread which have been steeped 24. hours in sharp Vinegar, four ounces; take
them out and beat them to pap: afterward melt three ounces and a half of
Wax in oil, and then temper it unto a salve.

Another which is used in Italy: Take oil of the blossoms of Orenges one
ounce, powder of Benseine one drag. and a half, Cloves, Mace, of each half a
drag. Laudanum one quarter of an ounce, temper all to a salve.

Another: Take oil of Quinces, of Spikenard and Mastick, of each two ounces
and a half, red Styrax, Squinant, Cipers roots, red and white Coral, Roses,
Masticke, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cloves, wild Vine leaves, of each
half a drag. Wax and Rosin, as much as is needful for to make a salve. This
does strengthen the stomach, withstandeth the wambling, and is also good for
all humidity of the stomach.

Item, take oil of Mastick, Spike, oil of Quinces, of each three ounces, oil
of Wormwood one ounce and a half, Masticke, Cloves, Nutmegs, wild Vine
leaves, Mints and Myrtle seeds, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wormwood,

Another. If one can get none other thing, then take green or dry Wormwood,
sees it in Sallad oil with a little Wine, until the wine be consumed, and
annoint therewith the stomach.

Oil of Masticke is thus prepared: Take oil of Roses six ounces, Oil of
Masticke.
good wine four ounces, of gross heaten Masticke one ounce and a half: let
this sees together until the wine be decocted: This oil does not only
strengthen the stomach, but also the brains, the sinews, joints, and the
Liver, asswageth all pain and all swellings in all the parts of the body.

To make oil of Quinces.
THis oil of Quinces is also (next to the oil of Masticke) very highly
commended; for it is costly and good for all debilities of the stomach, it
alayeth all wambling, it strengthens the digestive virtue, and also the
sinews etc. and it is thus prepared: Take Quinces that be yet scant ripe, cut
them with the pills in pieces, and take out the seeds; then take the juice of
Quinces, of the one as much as the other in a glass, and power into it as much
oil as there is of the juice, but rather unripe oil then other: this being
bounden tight, then set the glass the space of fifteen days in the Sun,
afterward let it boil two or three hours in water, and then wring it hard
through a cloth: this must be done three or four times one after another, and
so kept close stopped.

For a conclusion of this weakness of the stomach through cold, some do use
this brief mean, First, they do ordain a Clister made in this manner
following: take Lineseed and fresh butter, of each six ounces, of well washed
Turpentine dissolved in wine or any decoction (wherein be much Annis seed
sodden) one ounce; let the patient also drink much of some decoction of
Cloves, Galingall, Cinnamome, Balsam fruits, and Calmus: Lay then lastly this
plaster following upon the stomach. Take Rue one ounce, Wormwood four
ounces: this being beaten together, temper it with honey, and then lay it warm
upon the stomach.

Of the debilitie of the stomach through heat.. 6.
IF so be that this weakness of the stomach, and bad digestion of the same be
with great thirst, without appetite, with sour foul belchings, and with great
drouth of the mouth, it is then very easily to be adjudged that the same is
caused through heat. If there be Cholera mingled amongst it, then follows
wambling and parbraking, and that after the taking of light meats, as eggs,
fowls, and other good flesh. The mouth is bitter, and sometimes there comes
a shooting pain: he desires all cold things, and all which is hot goes
against him. The digestion of the stomach is strong, if the heat endure not
too long, which otherwise spoileth the same. These are the signs of the Gall
or Bilis which troubles or inflameth the stomach, and (as is said) molesteth
the same with vomiting and a sharp scowring. Now for to remedy this pain of
the stomach, it is to be marked whether the sick person were not wont to cast,
and if he were, he is then to use this sirupe, which is necessary for it: Take
the juice of sour Quinces eight ounces, white Sugar four ounces, Vinegar two
ounces, sees them to a sirupe; this sirupe does not only cool unnatural
heat of the stomach, but also strengthens it for to effect her work, and
expels the windines of the same. For this, is also very commodious the
sirupe of Veriuice, or De Agresta, which does also the same. Item, the sirupe
of Pears, Peaches, and especially of Apples, which is described in the second
part, the sixth Chapter, and 4.. which be also these following that be made of
the juice of Bayberies, Sorrel, Roses, water Lillies, Limons, Citrons, Myrtle
seeds, and of the juice of Pomgranats. Item, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses and
Violets, sirupe of Orenges are also highly commended for this, which be every
where described.

Item, sirupe of Roses laxatiue, Oxymel sirupe of Endive and of Vinegar, or
these following: Take Endive, small Endive, and Lettice, of each one handful,
the seeds of Melons, Cucumbers, Gourds, and Pompeons, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Wormwood one handful, Roses, Violets, of each one ounce, peeled Barley
one handful, the juice of Pomegranats four ounces, Vinegar three ounces,
Sugar as much as you think good, make a sirupe thereof. Item, Honey of Roses
expels all choleric matter from the stomach, and does strengthen the same:
and if it be needful to use any purgation for this, then shall you find good
instructions for it where we shall treat of Cholera, but chiefly is Cassie
commended for it, because her cooling operation is very fit and meet for the
stomach, for it cleanses the same from all moisture, and therefore are the
confections of Cassy and Manna which be described hereafter in the binding of
the body, esteemed very meet.

Item, the Tabulates Diaturbith cum Rhabarbaro, and a certain powder more,
which is expressed in the same place. Amongst the Simples are Seen leaves the
very principal, which have a great property to purge the hot Cholera; the
like does also Aloe, Coloquint, the juice of wild Cucumbers, Epithymus, and
twenty or thirty seeds of Palma Christi, which be very good, but that they be
somewhat prejudicial to the stomach.

Esula is somewhat too strong, for if the same be not well prepared, then is it
venime in the body. Laurel and the flowers of Mezereon be exceeding sharp and
perilous to be used. The Polypodie root is very safe, but yet somewhat
hurtful to the stomach. The yellow Mirobalans above all other do purge
Cholera, and loose very necessarily. There be of such laxatiue simples many mo,
but we have only recited here these simples for example, whereby to choose
that which likes him best, and to forbear that which is to be eschued. When
he has purged, then is it counseled by diverse that this Potion following be
taken after it. Take Fumitorie, Violets, Wormwood, of each one ounce; let
these sees so long in water, until about four ounces do remain of it. You
are then to steep in this decoction one quarter of an ounce of yellow
Mirobalans the space of a whole night, and being wrung out, then are you to
temper amongst it one drag. or one quarter of an ounce of Hiera Picra, and in
the morning early to drink it warm.

The order of Diet.
THe patient is to be sustained with such meats as be somewhat sour, and that
have also an astringent virtue, as flesh boiled with unripe Pomegranats, or for
sauce for his meat Veriuice, wine of Pomgranats, juice of Oranges, Limons, and
Prunes of Damask, Lettice, Purslaine, both of them made sour with Vinegar,
and so used.

Barley pap, Quinces, roasted Pears, or stued Pears strewed with Fennel or
Annis seed, eaten after meals, do shut up the stomach: The like do also wild
dry Pears.

Before in the first part the twelfth Chapter, and first. you have an especial
good stomachicall powder which is very good for all pains of the stomach
which proceed of Cholera. Item, take Roses ten drag. burnt Iuory three drag.
prepared Coriander seeds five drag. give him half an ounce thereof with sirupe
of Pomegranats, or sirupe of Quinces. For this, are also good these confections
following, as Triasantalon, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Rosata nouella, and Aromaticum
rosatum which is wholly of a temperate nature.

Confected things which do cool the stomach.
THe Conserve of Raspes and of Lettice are both of them good for to cool the
stomach: they make also a desire for meat, and do quicken the appetite. Musk
pears do stay the vaporing or fuming up into the head. All preserved Cherries,
Barberies, Cicorie roots, unripe Grapes, for what they be good, and how they
are to be confected, shall sufficiently be taught in the last part. Item, take
new conserve of Roses four ounces, sirupe of Apples as much as you please;
temper them all together, and take half an ounce fasting in the morning. Or
take Mastick one drag. Roses, burnt Iuorie and Mints, of each half a drag.
prepared Coriander one quarter of an ounce, red Corrall one drag. and a half,
Marmalad six ounces; make these with the sirupe of Apples a little soft, and
stamp them all together in a mortar, and mix them all well together.
Marmalades without spice (whereof be diverse described in the last part) be also
good remedies for the stomach, they stay the Flix, strengthen all the inward
parts, and make appetite. The conserve of Peach blossoms is also good.
Conserues of Roses delay the sharpnes of the choleric matter which causes
vomit. Conserues of Cicorie are also made for this.

Of the Trocisks these are special good, De Spodio, Diarrhodon, De Camphora,
De Barberis.

And as touching his drink, he must eschew all strong Wine, and drink a small
thin Wine.

Chery wine cools and moystneth the stomach and all inward parts through his
temperate nature. Iulep of Violets, and all other cooling potions may be used.
Hereafter in the treatise of Melancholy, there shall be described a very
precious wine, beginning thus: Take picked Currants, etc. which may be also very
commodiously used for this.

Now for to come to the things which one may use outwardly, we will speak
first of the plasters, and describe some of them.

Take the juice of Plantaine and Rose water, of each six ounces, Vinegar one
ounce, red and white Saunders, red Corrall, and prepared Coriander, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Quince kernels, Sorrel seed, of each one drag. this being
beaten small together, make a plaster thereof with Barley meal, yet let it not
be too hard, and lay it on the neck of the stomach.

Another. Take red and white Saunders, Sorrel seed, Bay berries, Quince
kernels, and the juice of Quinces, of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of
Mastick one ounce; poune all that is to be pouned, sees it by a mild fire or
on hot ashes until the juice be wasted, then strain it through a cloth, and
make thereof a soft plaster with Wax as much as is needful for it. This
plaster following is cooling and astringent.

Take Roses, burnt Iuory, Masticke, Coriander, Myrtle kernels, and the juice of
Sloes, Sandaraca, and Dragon blood, of each half a drag. Laudanum one quarter
of an ounce, Galliae Muscatae half a drag. Pitch and Rosin, of each three
quarters of an ounce, Wax as much as is needful for a plaster; let all these
be molten together in four ounces of the juice of Quinces, and sees it slowly
until all the juice be consumed, and it will be like to a soft plaster: it
strengthens the weak stomach of heat, of Cholera, and of an Ague; it
quenches thirst, stays excessive vomiting, scowring, and also the pain of
the stomach.

Out of all the foresaid things may you make salues with oil of Roses,
Violets, Quinces, and Masticke (which you please) until that the salve be soft
enough. In like manner is the salve of Roses also especially good for the heat
of the stomach. The stomach is also to be anointed with this oil following;
as oil of Quinces, oil of Masticke, and chiefly when there be Vine tendrels
decocted therein.

Of Bags, Applications, and Fomentations for the stomach.
TAke red and white Saunders, red and white Corrall, and Citron seed, of each
one drag. prepared Coriander one drag. and a half: these being all stamped
together grossly, make a bag thereof.

Take Rose water, Endive water, and water of Mints, of each twelve ounces, the
juice of sour Quinces two ounces, of red and white Saunders, prepared
Coriander, red Corrall, and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wormwood
half a handful, wherewith you may foment, and put the decocted herbs in a
bag, and so apply them to the stomach.

Of the debilitie of the stomach through drought.. 7.
Wheresoever is any weakness of the stomach caused through drought (whereof
has been spoken at the first) it causes great thirst, drought of the tongue,
and falling away of the whole body, as also contrariwise they find ease when
they find moist things. In this disease is the patient to drink Milk, and
Barley water; for the same do cool, moysten, and cause the body to increase
again. In like manner he is also to be fed with moystning herbs, as Lettice,
Mallows, and such like: also with Veale, Lamb, River fish. Eggs dressed with Wine
are also good for him, for that they yield good nourishment. Item, there be
very good and commodious Pullet broths dressed with cooling herbs, Capon waters,
Marchpanes, and other things more, which before in the Consumption or Phthisi in
the second part the fifth Chapter and 22.. and afterward in the sixth part of
the Ague Hectica, are expressed, all which be prepared for to moysten. He shall
also oftentimes bathe before meals and after meals, but a good while after.
His drink must be small Wine. Rest is good for him, and much motion is
hurtful, he is further to rule himself in all things as for the Consumption,
and as is taught for the Ague Hectica. But in case there strike great heat
into it, then use the salve of Roses and Saunders, the cooling salve Galeni,
oil of Roses, of Violets and waterlilies and such like. But this plaster
following is highly commended: Take new sliced Gourds, Purslaine and Willow
leaves, of each two ounces, white Saunders one quarter of an ounce, Camfer one
drag. Rose water as much as is needful: temper them and lay them upon the
stomach: you may lay also a bladder of cold water upon the stomach.

But this is here to be noted, that the cooling things must be laid upon it in
such manner, that the places adjacent about it, to wit, the Midriffe, the
Liver, and the Milt, may not thereby be harmed, and lose their natural action:
for which, it is also advised that when the same is perceived, that the same
place be anointed with warm oil.

Of the skalding in the throat, and of the hartburning.. 8.
ALthough this hartburning be caused diversely, yet nevertheless does the same
come always for the most part through heat, or through ascending vapors,
through strong Wine dronken, Spices, fat meats, and such like, against which
these things ensuing are to be used, to wit, conserve of Betonie, Gillofloures,
and the wine of both these: also the first stomachicall medicine described
above in the 5.. Item, Marmalade, and preserved sour Pears. Some do hang
about their neck for this disease the herb Agrimony. Other do hold in their
mouth the stone in the Carps head. Other do eat five or six Peach kernels, or
bitter Almonds upon it, etc. of which every one may choose that which likes
him best.

Of Inappetencie or lost appetite, and whereby it may be remedied.. 9.
OF all the foresaid debilities of the stomach, like as also in all diseases
incident unto it, the Appetite commonly is taken away, except the infirmity of
the unnatural hunger. Yea there is sometimes such loathing of meats
therewith, that they cannot abide to smell them. The causes thereof are diverse:
the first is heat, wherein the patient has very small desire to eat but
great list to drink, with drouth of the tongue, and loathing of all warm
things. If it be mingled with Cholera, then is there always bitterness with it,
with a wambling. Or if so be that there be any Phlegma with it, then does the
patient always find some kind of brackishnes in the mouth.

Secondly, this may also be caused through cold, whereby the constringent
virtue and taste of the stomach are destroyed. These are the signs: small
thirst, much spettle and other filth about the mouth of the stomach; the
patient does feel heaviness or pinching. Other whiles he parbraketh some
Phlegma, be it sweet or sower he shall feel it in the mouth. All warm things
are welcome unto him; cold things go against his stomach. This disease may
also be well caused by eating too much cold fruit, or by drinking of water.

Thirdly, the hot Agues do also take away the appetite. Fourthly, impostumes of
the stomach, of the liver, and of the milt, which be not without an Ague.
These may be perceived by swelling and pain of the same parts, whose remedies
are taught in the description of the selfsame members. Fifthly, this is also
caused through a tough slimie matter which lies in the mouth of the stomach,
and there does take away the appetite. The signs of them are these: if one do
cast up again all that he has taken, be it sower, sweet, hot, cold, like as
Olives, and such like. And albeit they do remain in the stomach, yet do they
make great pain and dissension. Sixthly, there appears a certain debilitie
of the retentiue power in ye flesh, in the small veins, in the muscles, and
other members, whereby (as behooves) they cannot draw their nourishment unto
them, so that the stomach may also thereby bear the less meat. The signs
whereof are these: the patient is meetely desirous of meat, but when the same
is set before him then can he eat but very little of it. Seventhly, it is
sometimes caused, for that melancholy very slowly or nothing at all has his
course toward the mouth of the stomach, which was wont there to excitate
appetite to meat; which may well be perceived hereby, if he be given to eat
sower meats: by which means the appetite partly returns again. The cause
may also be worms, whereof shall be spoken hereafter. Ninthly, it may well
happen for that the Melancholy too abundantly runs toward the mouth of the
stomach, whereof the signs be vomiting of melancholic humors, sowernes of
the mouth, black color of the face, debilitie of the stomach and heart. The
tenth cause is, when women begin to bear, whereof the signs be sufficiently
known. Eleuenthly, the ouerhot time and air may likewise cause the same, like
as does also exceeding cold and much watching; which causes and signs may be
learned of the patient, and demanded of them that do tend him. Twelfely,
through great vexations of the mind, as anger, sorrow, care, anguish, great
joy, desire of Venerie which cannot be obtained, as well as that which may be
obtained. Thirteenthly, this lost appetite may be caused through any corruption
in the stomach, which may be perceived through stench of the breath, or through
the ordure. This is also otherwhiles caused by reason of the scowring called
Diarrhaea with intolerable stench. There be also many mo causes: but the
abouesaid shall be sufficient unto us for this time. Now we will proceed to
prepare remedies for those lost appetites, whereby otherwise people might
perish at length.

First, if so be that this lost appetite proceeds through heat and Cholera,
then is the patient to be brought to vomiting, for that by reason that the
matter is light and liquid, therefore may it easily be expelled, and for to
prepare for the same, let the patient take Oxysacchara and sirupe of vinegar
which shall immediately hereafter be described, and thereupon use this mild
and gentle purgation.

Take Fumitory and Wormwood, of each two ounces, put them in water until that
there remain about four ounces, then steep therein one ounce of gross
beaten Mirobalans one whole night, afterward wring them well out, and so give
it him.

Also one may purge with the confection of Triphera and Rubarb. This sirupe
following is very much welcome unto the stomach: Take the juice of Apples that
be somewhat sower, and the juice of Quinces, of each eight ounces both well
clarified, then seethe them together with eight ounces of Sugar unto a sirupe,
whereof every morning and evening give him two ounces at one time. Also
Marmalade may be used alone. But if you will have it stronger, then take eight
ounces of the foresaid confection, and temper it with a little wine; and when
the same is a little cold again, then mix amongst it one ounce of beaten
Roses, Species Triasandali, half an ounce, Spica, and Lignum Aloes, of each
one quarter of an ounce. For this be also good, Services, Pears, sirupe of
Mulberies, sirupe of Vinegar, Oxysacchara, Oxymel, confected Coriander, Melon
seed, and all that is sower.

On the outside shall you apply as follows: Take a Quince pear, cut it very
small and take out the coare, and let the same boil in oil of Roses;
afterward beat it very small, and temper therewith the seeds of Butchers
broom, Barberies, Roses and red Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, the
pills of Grapes three dragmes beaten small, then spread it on a leather, and
wear it on your stomach.

Vinegar eaten with Lettice is also very good: so are also Quinces, a little
Sorrel, Veriuice, Limons, the juice of Citrons, Orenges, sower Apples,
Pomegranates, and Mulberies that are, and all, yet scant ripe.

Also all they that have lost their appetite of eating, must beware of all fat
flesh and meat, that is dressed with much oil and butter.

You shall have also a further resolution or advise in the sixth part, where we
speak and discourse of Agues, what is needful to be done for the defect of
appetite.

But if so be that this lost appetite do proceed of cold, then are these
preparatiues to be used. The sirupe of Citron pills, Wormwood and Mints, of
each half an ounce, tempered in Barley water, and so dronken four or six
mornings one after another.

For to purge, use Pillulae stomachicae, Hiera Picra sharpened with a little of
the Trocisci Alhandali: this is passing good if one have a foul matter
stinking in the stomach. Afterward he may take any of these confections
ensuing, Diacyminum, Aromaticum Rosatum, Diatrion pipereon, Diacalamintha, and
sometimes some Treacle: also Marmalade with spices, green Ginger, and Chebuli:
The stomachicall powder which is described in the first part, the twelfth
chapter, and first.

Salsamentum Regium.
In like manner also the Salsamentum Regium, which is thus made: Take Fennel and
Parsley seed, Cinnamom, Cloves, of each a like quantity; let them sees well in
Vinegar, then put unto the broth a good deal of Sugar, and so use it for all
other meat in stead of a sauce: This has an especial operation to quicken
the appetite.

For this may also be used Onions, Garlic, spices, confected Cinnamom, and
Annis seeds, roasted and stued Pears stuck full of Cloves. And this salve for
the stomach may also be made thus: Take Sallad oil six ounces, Mints,
Wormwood, Marierom gentle, and marsh Mints, of each one ounce, Nutmegs, Cipers
nuts, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis, Fennel, Cloves, of each half a
drag. white wine six ounces; cut and beat all gross together, and so let it
sees until the wine be decocted away: afterward wring it out hard through a
cloth, and anoint the place therewith warm. Afterward strew this powder
following upon it: Take Frankincense and Masticke, of each half an ounce,
Cipers roots one quarter of an ounce, Mints, Wormwood, and Nutmegs, of each
one dragme, and then apply unwashed sheep wool upon it meetely warm.

Forasmuch as not only here, but in other places more, the sirupe of Vinegar is
specified: therefore we will here describe it after two sorts, like as the same
is used at the Apothecaries: the first is called Syrupus Acetosus simplex,
Syrupus Acetosus simplex.
and is thus prepared: Take good sharp Vinegar three ounces, Sugar five ounces;
clarify it with the white of an egg, and let the Vinegar be decocted to a
sirupe. This sirupe is very good against all corrupted humors: for it does
attenuate all thick slime, and causes all tough matter to avoid, softeneth
the hard, and expels all bad humors: it opens all obstructions, and
provoke urine: in fine, it is good for all bad corruptions of the body, and
is also very good for all pestilent Fevers, for it quenches the thirst.

Compositus vel cum Radicibus.
The other sirupe of Vinegar do the Physicians call Syrupum Acetosum compositum,
or Acetosum cum Radicibus, and is made thus: Take fair Well water about one
quarte, the roots of Fennel, Smallage and Endive well cleansed, of each one
ounce and a half, Annis, Fennel, and Smallage seeds, of each half an ounce,
beaten grossly; let them sees unto the half, then wring out hard all the
liquor, and put thereto eighteen ounces of white Sugar, twelve ounces of
strong Vinegar; sees them to a sirupe. This sirupe does cause gross humors to
avoid, and chiefly the choleric slime which will hardly be expelled from the
Lights: It opens also all the oppilations of the Liver, Lights, and Kidneies.

Of the wambling, and the loathing of meat.. 10.
ALl they that have lost their desire and appetite to meat, have commonly such
a loathing of all meat, that they can neither abide to see nor to smell it.
This debilitie of the stomach do the learned call Subuersionem, Fastidium,
Nauseam, and the Grecians Anorexian, which is, when all things do go against
the stomach, and has no delight in any, after which follows wambling, and
then Atrophia, when the patient cannot sustain himself any longer. Also when
one cares for no meat, and when the stomach is molested with continual
wambling and parbraking, and yet notwithstanding cannot cast up, the body
falls away, and does utterly come to the Consumption Tabes: for this Atrophia
is a spice of a Consumption. So that these things, as inappetencie, or loss of
appetite, wambling and lothsomnesse, do commonly depend on each other, and are
almost caused of one manner of cause, therefore have we described them beside
each other. The causes which provoke this loss of appetite and wambling, may
well be these hereafter following, to wit, when one beholds some loathsome
thing or any other filth, as when an other vomiteth, whereby the imagination is
moved, and the stomach also urged to vomit, and yet nevertheless cannot by
any means parbrake at all; as it comes often to pass, when as any be
stricken hard upon the stomach. Also the same may be caused through ouergreat
heat or cold: Also if one have ouercharged himself with meat or drink, and
chiefly with Porke, with Celes, with water Fowls, and with excessive Wine, or
such like, and then thereupon follows no exercise, whereby such cruditie
might be digested.

These diseases may also be caused through some bad and slimie humors which
are in the stomach, whether it be through mixture of heat, Cholera, or cold
Phlegma, or otherwise; the which notwithstanding, how late soever that it be,
do trouble the stomach, cause wambling, but not so forcibly that the stomach
is able thereby to expel them.

The signs thereof are for the most part apparent to the eye, and to be
enquired of the sick person. If it be long of the stomach, then is some heat
to be perceived in the feeling of the stomach, which also is by the complexion
augmented, as old age, the time of the year. And if otherwhiles there be
somewhat parbraked or vomited up, and that the same comes through cold, then
causes it neither thirst nor heat, the patient desires rest and quiet. If so
be that it do come through heat and cold, then do come all things for the most
part by the foresaid feebleness of the stomach, for which are the remedies
here expressed to be used: yet is this here especially commended

But if so be that this wambling or lothsomnesse do proceed of Cholera, with
heat and bitterness of the mouth, drought of the throat and tongue, then
prepare the matter with sirupe of Vinegar, and with Oxymel simplex. The
vomiting and purging must be brought to pass through these means following:
Take Violets, Burrage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, of each half an ounce,
15. or 16. Damask Prunes, sees them together with 18. ounces of water unto
the half, then lay to steep therein a whole night, half an ounce of yellow
Mirobalans, Rubarb one dragme or more, afterward wring it out very hard, and
drink it betimes in the morning. After purging strengthen the stomach with
sirupe of Apples, of Pomegranats, or of Quinces which is made of Sugar. And for
this is to be used also the confection Triasantalon, conserve of Roses, or
Rosata Nouella. First, he must eat Lettice, Purslaine, and Sorrel, with
Vinegar, and Strawberies if they be ripe. His meat must be tempered with the
juice of Sorrel, Oranges, and the juice of Limons.

But if this wambling or lothsomnesse do proceed of cold, then must the matter
be prepared with Oxymel diureticum, or with sirupe of Wormwood, and with wine
of Wormwood, and afterward must the patient be constrained to vomit.

For to purge must be taken Diaturbith or Hiera Picra, which is sharpened with
a little Esula and Masticke: after purging, Marmalad with spices is to be used,
and Aromaticum rosatum, Diapliris with Muscus, or Letitiae Galeni. Also make a
sauce of Parsley, Sage, Mints, Cloves, beaten together, and tempered with
vinegar. Moreover, all manner of other means are to be used to quicken the
appetite. Outwardly is the stomach to be anointed with the oil of Mastick
and of Wormwood.

Plasters and other things mo which be fit for this, are to be found in the
treatise of the debilitie of the stomach. But if this disease be caused
through repletion of the body, then is the cure to be begun with letting blood,
and afterward to purge (whether it came through heat or cold) and so to
proceed with other things.

Of wambling or vomiting through weakness of the Stomach.. 11.
AS we have spoken of the lothsomnesse of meat: so we will now make mention of
the third, which is of the vomiting. This is partly a desire, and partly a
constraint of vomiting. But to speak advisedly of it, there be two kinds of
vomitings: to wit, that which is called of the Grecians Anastrophe, and of the
Latinists Inuersio (which is a turning vpside down of the stomach) wherein
all that is beneath in the stomach is yielded upward by vomit; the other
manner of vomiting is called Cholera, or Cholerica passio: the which not only
with parbraking, but also with a strong scowring does take one, whereof we will
now write. Concerning the first kind of vomiting, it is thus described:
Vomiting is a motion of the stomach, whereby it does cast upwards that which
is gross, and all that is hurtful unto it. The causes of this casting are
many: namely, to strike on the stomach, to fall, and such like, or upon any
other parts, which have some sympathy with the stomach, as the brains, and
other strong motions. Item, when it happens to those that are upon the
boisterous sea: or if there fall into the stomach any corrupted humors, and
there destroy the digestion of the stomach. Also this parbraking may be caused
through some kind of meat, which provoke vomit, as we have showed
heretofore. Item, all things whereof nature has a loathing, as Frogs and
Snailes, etc. Also the Cough may otherwhiles be too strong, and so provoke one
to vomit. Likewise also impostumes, tumors of the stomach, or the Lights: for
nature cannot suffer nor abide any matter. Lastly, all such vomits do come also
through debilitie of the virtue retentiue, and violence of the virtue
expulsive, or if any one have taken neesing roots, or any such like.

The signs of the parbraking are these: when one begins to feel a
wambling, and when the lower lip begins to quiver, the uppermost intrailes
begin to stir, and feel the pain of the head, and heart, giddines, and when
the mouth is full of slime: the which be for the most part all the signs, that
the stomach is charged with Cholera. But if the causes of parbraking proceed
of outward things, then are they to be demanded of the sick person, and of
them that be with him. Or if any do come of any stinking matter which is in the
stomach, that is to be perceived by the stinch of the urine, or by that which
is cast up, or by the stench of the ordure, wherewith the matter is otherwhiles
admixed, and the patient shall well feel the same in his mouth, like as we
have sufficiently spoken thereof already.

But before we come to the remedies of these diseases, it is first needful to
add some common rules for this parbraking.

Whereof the first is, that whenever the parbraking does chance naturally,
and the patient finds ease by it, that it is not then to prohibited, in case
that the natural strength be not thereby enfeebled, which is then to be helped
by all means possible.

The second rule is, when nature begins to expel by vomit all that is
hurtful for her, that then it is yet more to be procured. Thirdly, persons
that be narrow in the breast, and have a long lean neck, weak sight, and
feeble brains, they are by no means to be brought to this vomiting. Fourthly,
if one would have any body parbrake which is very hard to be brought unto it,
then is he first to eat much meat and other things, which causes the humors
to be loose, and also to drink much, whereby the virtue retentiue is weakened,
and the expulsive strengthened, whereby the vomiting may be the more easily
effected, but this is of no value for the Ague. Fifthly, rough and gross things
taken are not to be expelled through parbraking, that the throat (through
which the same is to pass) be not thereby bruised. Sixthly, the vomiting is very
dangerous for the stomach. Seventhly, in them that have an impostume in the
stomach, it is very dangerous to provoke vomiting. Eighthly, odoriferous things
be very acceptable unto the stomach, and assisting, especially when they be
admixed with alimentall meats, therefore be they commonly joined with those
things which provoke vomit. Ninthly, to withdraw the matter and humors of these
excessive vomitings, are the outward members to be bounden, to wit, the arms
and legs, and also to set the feet in warm water. Tenthly, when it is seen
that this vomit happens in a violent disease, after the manner of a Crisis or
ending of the disease, then is the same not to be stayed at any hand, if it so
be that it come not too vehemently, whereby nature might be weakened, but then
is the same to be cured with his contraries. Eleuenthly, for this unmeasurable
and excessive vomiting, may the matter be conveniently drawn downwards by
Clisters.

These now be rules which are to be observed in all manner of vomiting. When as
the vomiting proceeds of hot causes, which is presaged by the bitterness of
the mouth, desire and longing for cold things, then is the matter to be
prepared with Oxysacchara, or such like sirupes, and to provoke vomiting by
drinking warm water, and oil of Violets, and by putting a feather into the
throat. But if the same will not be, then are you to purge, especially with
yellow Mirobalans, and afterward to strengthen the stomach, whereof we have
given good advice before.

If the patient be of a plethoricke constitution, then must there be no neglect
of opening the Basilica, for thereby shall the matter be diminished, and the
whole body cooled.

But the principallest things that be requisite for this, are Roses, Saunders,
prepared Coriander, Violets, sour Apples and Pears, Peaches, Quinces, Camfer,
blossoms and pills of Pomegranats, Coral, Bolus, Dragon blood, the rindes of a
Medlar tree, Quince tree, Oak, and Plum tree; Vinegar, the juice of Sorrel,
sodden juice of Quinces, the juice of Medlars and of Services, sirupes of
Roses, Violets, Raspes, Citrons, Limons, Oranges, and such like. Of the
foresaid things you may if you please make Confections, Conserues, Sirupes,
Potions, or any thing else what you please. It is especially observed, that
Purslaine eaten with Vinegar, takes away the parbraking through heat. But
there is to be laid upon the outside of the mouth and the stomach and pit of
the heart, this plaster following: Take the pills and blossoms of Pomegranats,
the seeds of Butchers broom, and of Mirtles, of Roses and Bayberies, of each
half an ounce, Mastick, Mints, of each two dragmes and a half, Lignum Aloes
one drag. the juice of Quinces and of wild Pears, of each alike quantity, or
so much as is needful for to make a plaster with it. And to the end this may
be the more piercing, mix therewith one ounce and a half of Vinegar, and then
spread it on a cloth, and lay it thereon, as is said. But if the juice of
Quinces and wild Pears be not to be gotten, then take the juice of Plantaine
in stead thereof: Or heat Vinegar, and wet therein a piece of felt or a
sponge, and so lay it over the stomach either hot or cold, and then lay on
the top thereof a Rosecake, which is made wet over the vapor of Vinegar: but
annoint the stomach before with the juice of Mints, and then strew the powder
of Roses and Myrtle seed upon it.

Here before in the twelfth rule is spoken of a Clister, whereof you have one
here for example: Take Mallows, Hollihock roots, Violet leaves, and Beetes,
of each one handful, peeled Barley and Bran, of each half a handful,
eighteen or twenty Prunes, let them sees, then take 16. ounces of this
decoction, and put therein an ounce of Cassie, and of Succo Rosarum half an
ounce: temper all together, and use thereof two or three one after another,
until that the body be well opened.

But if the parbraking be caused through cold and Plehgma, and the patient do
not vomit much nor often, and that nature be not much diseased, then must be
given to the patient Oxymel of Squils, Syrupus de Calamintha, or warm water,
wherein Dill, field Mints, and Sage are decocted. And afterward he is to purge
with Hiera Picra, which is sharpened with a little of the Trocisci Alhandali, or
with pills of Aloe lota or Stomachicis tempered together, or each apart.

Vomiting must be furthered or procured, and although that to this end there be
many medicines described, notwithstanding is this hereafter following not to be
omitted: Take the juice of Squils, the juice of Onions, of each one ounce and a
half, Sugar three ounces: sees these so thick that it will make Tabulats, or
Sugar plates, each of the weight of three dragmes. When you will use them, then
dissolve them, and drink them, and then look if you can vomit afterward, the
Squils have an especial power to move vomit.

When as then the matter is thoroughly purged, then to comfort the stomach with
sirupe of Quinces, with Miua, and with sirupe of Mints and Wormwood. His meat
must be dressed with good Spices, his drink shall be good old and pleasant Wine.
He must annoint the stomach with the oil of Mastick, and with the oil of
Spike tempered together, or each alone, then strew thereon powder of Mastick,
and lay a clean cloth upon it.

This plaster ensuing may also be made and prepared for the same: Tossed white
bread so hard that you may powne it, and temper it with Vinegar, and the juice
of Mints, put thereto one ounce of Mastick, more or less according to the
quantity of the white bread, make them warm, and then temper therewith a
little oil of Spike and Mastick, and so lay it warm on the pit of the
stomach. Or take tosted bread as before, and temper it with the juice of
Mints, and strew half an ounce of this powder following upon it: Take Mints,
Ginger, Wormwood, Cypers nuts, Cinnamome and Spike, of each one dragme,
Frankincense, Mastick, of each half an ounce, and make a powder thereof, it
warmeth, strengthens, and astringeth. There may also be made of this foresaid
powder Confections, Plasters, Oils, and all whatsoever one will.

It happens also sometimes that with this vomiting a laske or flixe is
adjoined. For to stay the same are these things following good, parched Cresses
seed, Cypers Nut leaves, Mirrhe, Lignum Aloes, red Styrax, Amber, Laudanum,
Indis Spica, Spica Romana, Calmus, Cloves, Mints, Wormwood, Citrons, Limons,
Oranges, Frankincense, Mastick, Rue, Agnus castus, tosted bread, Gallia
Muscata, and Alipta, and almost all kinds of Spices. Also Treacle taken with
the juice of Mints, stays vomiting.

Item, make a plaster of Mastick, with a little sodden Turpentine, and lay it
on the stomach: for this also are you to set boxing cups upon the shoulders.

For this also is Marmalade with Spices very good, and preserved Quinces, and
these are the common means against the vomiting through a weak stomach, be
it through heat or cold. You shall also find many mo described in other
places of this book, amongst diverse sicknesses, as before in the second part,
the fifth Chapter and 2.. is discovered for the spetting of blood, and such
like. We will now pass over to another manner of parbraking through Cholera.

Of Parbraking or Vomiting, with the laske or scouring.. 12.
THis malady do the learned name after the humor whereby it is caused,
Choleram. The later Physicians call it Cholericam Passionem, and it is thus
described: Cholera is a very sharp, troublesome, and heavy disease, which
immediately molesteth one with the Rheum, whereby vomiting, great flixe, or
scouring, Colic, pain of the bowels, and an Ague is bred. Or, Cholera is a
violent sickness, with vomiting, great scowring or laske, with Cramp in the
sinews, Thighs and Legs, whereby all outward members are cold, and the pulse
is small and slow.

Or, Cholera is such a malady, whereby one immediately does scowre and rid
upward and downward many kinds of humors and slime, with the meat; so that he
detaineth nothing in his body. This sickness comes first of spoiled and
corrupted meat, which remains to long in some place of the body, as in the
stomach or bowels, and there causes a bad alteration, and also gives little
nourishment. Also this sickness is sometimes caused of cold and waterish
humors, which gather themselves together in ye bowels, and in the stomach, that
do debilitate the retentiue virtue of the stomach above and beneath. But the
sickness for the most part is caused through much Cholera and red gall, that
do so lie and bite in the stomach and bowels, that within the space of one
hour the parbraking and going to the stool do so haunt a body, that
otherwhiles the strongest body on the third day is deprived of his life, and
this is worse then all other. The signs of a cold cause are these, before the
sickness be upon one, much windiness is felt in the bowels: also some days
before the sickness, he feels pain and shooting about the Navel, whereupon
presently ensues a vehement laske, or flixe, with vomiting of much slime and
other illfauored matter. This is also the sooner caused, if the patient have
used great store of phlegmaticall meats.

That which is caused through heat is hereby known: there falls much
Cholera into the stomach and bowels, with great and mighty parbraking, and
also with great thirst, and if one drink cold water, then does the vomiting
stay until that the water be warmed in ye stomach. The Flux is so vehement,
that the patient sometimes thereby swouneth, and also utterly loses the pulse,
with an unsteadfast heat, and bereauing of his senses.

When as then it happens that one feels a continual pain in the stomach or
bowels, with great heaviness of mind, and perceives parbraking and vomiting:
then is such verily to be taken for Cholera: for this, there is to be given to
the sick body lukewarm water to drink very often. And if so be that this
parbraking and scowring continue still, then give him warm water to drink
again, as before, and that so long till you find that he have avoided some
corrupted meats, slime, or some of the gall. This will free the patient of mo
other sicknesses.

For this are more other things to be used; to wit, that expel this sharp
matter: so that Phlegma with things necessary for it, and Cholera with those
that help it, might be taken in hand, because parbraking will be cured by
parbraking, and scowring by scowring. When as then the scowring is stayed of
both ends, then is the patie^t to bath one hour long: afterward to eat a
little, and that light meat, because the stomach is very much weakened. After
that, he is to eat a little Marmalade, which is tempered with prepared
Coriander, and so go sleep. He is to use this Marmalade as long as the
scowring or parbraking endures.

His diet must be Hen broth, decocted with Veriuice, steeled Goats milk,
Barley and Oten paps, sodden Lettice and Purslaine; but principally if there be
any heat and bitterness of the mouth remaining: but if so be that there be
any cold in the stomach, then are these herbs at no hand to be used. When as
the patient begins again to feed well, then be good for him all field
fowls, and chiefly Partridges which have a proper hidden virtue to strengthen
the stomach. Amongst other meats may well be used Limons, Citrons, Oranges,
Veriuice and such like. Item, all sower fruits, Services, unripe Medlars, sower
Pears, Apples and Quinces. Also he shall eat (although not gladly) sops of
white bread in the juice of Pomegranats: and if so be that he vomit up the
same, yet must he take more again, and do this so long till that he do hold
and retain it.

As long as he is not through wholethen is he to drink steeled water with
sirupe of Quinces, or old conserve of Roses. When he begins to be whole,
then is he to drink good relished wine, which is tempered with the juice of
Pomegranates. And if so be that he parbrake it up, then let him drink of ye
same again, but a little at once, that the stomach be not ouercharged.

Here follows now what is to be used for this scowring and parbraking, and
chiefly when it is seen that these diseases do increase. For which one is not
to be discomforted, but much more bestir him to help the sick person with
these remedies following: First, you must give him one or two dragmes of
Trociscos de Olibano, with water or juice of Pomegranates: and afterward to
bind his legs fast: like as is taught before against the parbraking, when the
vomiting gets the upper hand; so must his arms likewise be bounden, when
the scowring gets the mastery. But above all, sleep is passing good. Item
Rose water laid very cold over the legs, or from the upper part of the legs
downward wetted and washed therewith, and the feet set in it, is also very
good.

In like manner is this plaster ensuing forcible to assuage the pain, and to
warm and strengthen: Take rindes of the Medlar tree, of Quinces, and of an
Oaken tree, the seed of Butchers broom, blossoms and rindes of Pomegranates,
Myrtle seed, Sarcocolla, Masticke, Cammomill, and Melilot, of each a like
quantity: make a plaster thereof with the juice of Quinces, or of wild and
sower Pears, and spread it on a cloth. But if the scowring be stronger then
the parbraking, then lay it warm upon the belly. But if the parbraking be
sorest of al, then lay it upon the stomach. Others do make two plasters, as
hereafter follows.

Take Laudanum, Masticke, of each one ounce and a half, Frankincense half a
dragme, red and white Saunders, red Corrall, seeds of Butchers broom, of each
one scruple, yellow Rose seeds, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, blossoms and
pills of Pomegranates, of each half a scruple, beaten small together as much as
is needful for a plaster; spread thereof upon a cloth, and lay a great
plaster thereof over the stomach, before and behind upon the back about the
Kidneies. Item, take the juice Plantaine and Rose water, of each three ounces,
Vinegar half an ounce, Masticke, Frankincense, of each half a dragme, Lentill
meal as much as is needful for to make a plaster withal.

Another called de Crustapanis: Take Masticke, Mints, burnt Iuorie, red Coral,
De Crusta panis.
red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Crusts of white bread two ounces;
steep them half an hour in Vinegar, afterward beat them all together, and
temper amongst it oil of Masticke and oil of Quinces, of each one ounce,
Barley meal as much as does suffice for a plaster, and lay it warm upon the
stomach. This takes away the parbraking within the space of half an hour.

Hereafter follow more salues and oils.
TAke oil of Masticke and oil of Roses, of each a like much, temper therewith
a little Vinegar, and anoint the stomach with it. Item, take oil of
Masticke, of Quinces, and of Mirtles, of each half an ounce, Roses, red
Coral, and Mints, of each half a dragme, Nutmegs, Myrtle seed, of each two
scruples, and a little Vinegar; temper them all with Wax, and make a salve of
them or a plaster. You have a salve also here before in the tenth Chapter, and
the 5.. beginning thus. Take Comin and Caruway, etc. which is especial good
against parbraking being rubbed warm upon the stomach and the Navel. You may
also rub alone upon it the juice of Plantaine tempered with Rose water: but to
make it thick, mingle therewith Lentill meal. Take oil Wormwood one ounce,
oil of Quinces, Mints, and Masticke, of each half an ounce, Malmesey five
dragmes; let them boil until the wine be wasted, and when it is almost cold,
then temper therewith Species Diagalangae, Aromatici Rosati, de xylo aloes, of
each one dragme, and Wax as much as suffices for a plaster. Item, take red
Saunders and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gallia muscata, and
Camfer, of each one dragme, Rose water six ounces; temper, and then lay it on
the belly: for it asswageth and cools. Item, Rose water alone made cold in
snow, and laid upon the belly, and when it is warm, laid cold again upon it,
is very commodious for this purpose.

Another. Take Bayberries, Medlar leaves, Frankincense, Tormentill, gross
Marierom, (or them that one can best get) of each half an ounce; cut and sees
it in red wine, and afterward lay it as a warm plaster upon the stomach
with Tow wetted therein: This is especial good for all them that cannot keep in
their meat. This ensuing is also accounted to have a marvelous operation:
Take the juice of Crabs, make a double cloth wet therein; if his body be hot
with an Ague, then lay it cold upon it: but if the body be cold, then apply it
lukewarm upon it. Item, take tosted bread beaten small four ounces, Masticke
one quarter of an ounce; make it meetely hot, and lay it warm in a bag upon
the stomach: It takes wind away, and also the Collike in the belly.

Another. Take Roses, blossoms of Pomegranates, of each one handful and a
half, Gallia muscatae one dragme an a half, the juice of Sloes, Mirtles,
Frankincense, of each one dragme, Wormwood, Hypocistis, Cypers roots, Cloves
Masticke, of each half a dragme, red and white Coral, Spica, of each one
scruple, tosted bread half an ounce, Camfere half a drag. beat it small
together, and then put it into a bag, and so apply it.

In the mixture of other things is oftentimes mention made of the Trocisci of
Gallia muscata, or Alipta muscata: And because that their description is but
brief, we will here add it unto the rest.

Gallia muscata.
Gallia muscata is made thus: Take Lignum Aloes five dragmes, Amber three
dragmes, Musk one dragme, Dragagant dissolved in Rose water, as much as
suffices for to make Trociscos with it, Alipta muscata.
and keep them well. The Alipta muscata is thus prepared: Take pure Laudanum
four ounces, liquid Styrax one ounce and a half, red Styrax one ounce, Lignum
Aloes half a drag. Amber one dragme, Camfere half a dragme, Musk half a
scruple, and a little Rose water, and prepare them thus: In the Dog days must
you set the Styrax and Laudanum with the Rose water together in the Sun, let
them there dry together until they be hard as dow; afterward stamp them in a
mortar, and temper the rest amongst them, then form Trocisces of them, and
keep them very well, like as you do the other. For this parbraking is also
used fomenting upon the stomach: therefore make or choose your self that which
you desire of these things which be prescribed. Take the things which we have
ordained for the first bags beaten grossly, sees them in the juice of Quinces,
and in Rose water, of each six ounces, red thick Wine eight ounces, Vinegar
two ounces; make therein a cloth or sponge wet, wring it well out, and hold it
very warm upon the stomach.

Another. When the stomach is utterly spoiled, so that the patient can neither
abide meat nor drink, then may it be strengthened again with these
fome^tations ensuing: Take Balm, Wormwood, gross Marierom, field Mints,
Fennel, and Dill seed, of each a handful, Mastick, Galingall, Nutmegs,
Squinant, Myrtle seed, and Coriander, of each three dragmes, wild Vine leaves
and the blossoms, half a handful; beat all gross together, and sees them
in thick wine, and use it as aforesaid. Item, take garden Mints, Balm,
Wormwood and Roses, of each one handful, Cammomill, wild Vine leaves, Betony,
Rosemary, of each half a handful, Calmus half an ounce; beaten all together
gross, put it in two bags, each one a quarter of a yard long: then sees them
in red wine, and a little water, and then laid upon the stomach, sometime the
one, and sometime the other. This fomenting must be so continued the space of a
quarter of an hour, and afterward are you to use the prescribed salve with
the spices, and wear one of the foresaid plasters upon it.

But if so be that the scowring or laske of ye belly will not stay, then must
boxing cups be set upon the shoulders vnpickt, and taken off and on. The like
is also to be done for continual vomits, and to set a great cup upon the
Navel, to the end thereby to draw the matter downwards: And in case that the
sick body can sleep with these cups so fastened, it is so much the better.
There is also often times to be holden before his nose, Saunders, Roses, and
such like things for to smell unto them. Also some do counsel to take for this
scowring (if it continue) the stalks of Tamariske being scraped clean, and to
powder them, and then put thereto as much Hearts tongue as these foresaid powders,
the quantity of two handfuls, pouring then upon it three pints of wine: of
which wine he is always to drink his first draught sitting at the table. This
wine is also especial good for the Milt or Spleen.

If there befall swouning, then must there be given to the sick body two
grains of Musk tempered in wine: for this strengthens much the vital
spirits. In like manner is Hen broth and Lamb broth good for him, tempered
with a little of the juice of Quinces. Let the patient also have roasted Pullets
cut in pieces under his nose; for the smell thereof does much comfort. Also let
him chew Frankincense, and swallow down the same treatable. At the last temper
together fine Bolus and Camfer, of each one scruple, and temper them with old
wine, and drink it: it does cool and strengthen the stomach.

All that is hitherto rehearsed, is to be used whilst the parbraking yet
endures. But if it stay, and the stomach begin to retain the meat, then is
the patient to drink good old strong wine, and compose himself to sleep,
Trocisci de Olibano.
and also take of the Trociscos de Olibano the weight of half a dragme, which
is thus prepared.

Take fine Bolus and Frankincense, of each one ounce and a quarter, Cucubes,
Cardamom, of each two dragmes and a half, Camfere, Gallia muscata, Cloves, of
each three quarters of an ounce; make thereof Trociscos with old wine: these
are especial good against parbraking. Item, take the juice of sower
Pomegranats as much as you please, and when it has stood one night, and the
clear is powered off, then sees it to the thickness of honey. When it is taken
from the fire, and whilst that it is hot put some Mints unto it; so let it
cool, and then take out the herbs again. This may be used warm or how one
will, and is called at the Apothecaries Rob de granatis. After the same manner
you may also make Rob of the juice of Quinces. Rob de granatis.
For this is also requisite the sirupe of Veriuice, and of Mirtles. But if so
be that there cannot be gotten any of the foresaid things for the foresaid
sirupes, then take Wine, Plantaine, and Rose water.

Now for as much as in this our method we are come to the Laske or flixe of
the belly, which is commonly caused through a weak stomach and diseased
Liver, therefore it is now requisite that we discourse of all other sorts of
Lasks whatsoever; but first of all we will make a general discourse of them.

Of the Flixe, Laske, or scowring by stool.. 13.
FIrst, it happens often in hail people, who have a plethoricke body, and do
eat and drink much, that they get a Laske, which comes not often upon them,
continues not long, also not otherwise then of a strong nature, who seeks to
unburden her of superfluities, like as it comes to pass, that thereby the
patient finds great ease. This scowring has no need of any remedy, unless
it be caused of ouergreat weakness, for the which the same counsel is to be
used which is prescribed against ye flixe of the belly Lienteria, so that at
this present there is nothing more to be written thereof. If so be then that
this scowring of the belly be taken for a disease, then is it first to be
understood, that the same is caused through many inward members of the body,
and also of diverse other causes, like as shall be hereafter taught immediately,
that the same cannot be ascribed to any one thing. And for that we should not
describe this kind of laske by piece meals here and there, we will now here
ascribe this flixe to the stomach (as is already expressed:) the which if it
be no evident cause of this scowring, yet notwithstanding it is a great help
to the same: we will then afterward add unto it all that appertains unto
it, as the constraint to the stool, and binding of the body, and all that is
good for it. But first of all we must here rehearse certain rules which are to
be observed for all sorts of lasks: whereof the first is, that no scowring or
laske is to be stayed before the fourth day, if so be the patient be able to
suffer the same without extreme faintness. Secondly, when you will ever use
astringent remedies, then must the same be always done before meat, to the
end that the meat which is taken after them might be stayed until it were
digested. Thirdly, this is to be noted of all binding meats, of Chestnuts, and
such like. Fourthly, when the laske is of heat, then are the remedies to be
used which are cold of nature, and for the scowring of cold, contrary remedies.
And because that in ye cold scowring the digestive virtue is very feeble, warm
things are to be used, according to the importance of the case. Fifthly, if so
be that there do come a cough to this scowring, then are all sour things to be
forborne, and all those which bind much. Sixthly, it is very good for all lasks
to force the body to sweating, and to anoint it much with oil of Cammomill
and Dill, thereby to draw out the matter, and to open the pores. Seventhly,
cups are to be set upon the belly, and kept upon it four hours long. Eighthly,
he is to be restrained and kept from all Fruits, except Chestnuts, which may
bind if they will. Ninthly, rest and sleep are especial good for all flixes:
so is also contrariwise bad, great labor, and other motions of the body.
Tenthly, when, as in the red or bloody flixe the uppermost guts are excoriated,
then is the remedy to be ministered in at the mouth: and if the lower guts be
perished, then must Clisters and suppositories be ministered beneath.
Eleuenthly, if the excoriation of the bowels be above and beneath, then are the
remedies to be used above and beneath.

And that we may come to the original, the learned do name three Species of
flixes or lasks: as namely, Lienteriam, Diarrhaeam, (under which is contained
the flux of the Liver) and Dysenteriam: but what difference is between these
laskes, that shall in their proper description be declared.

First, this is here always to be noted, that all laskes be moved of inward or
outward causes, as unhealthy meats, unruly life, eating of any venomous
things, also heat or cold of the time. The inward causes may proceed out of
the head, as if any humors do fall out of the head into the lower parts of the
body, be it into the stomach, or into the uppermost or undermost bowels:
likewise also into the small veins Mesaraicae, into the Liver, Milt, and
sometimes also into the whole body, like as when the same is too full of
humors, or too much wasted away, even as it may be seen in the consumption
Phthisi, Hectica, and the pestilent Fever, out of all which the expert
Physicians do take and discern sundry signs and observations.

Of the Laske Lienteria of Cholera and Heat.. 14.
THis is an infirmity of the retentiue virtue of the stomach, with the
slipperinesse of the guts, whereby it happens that the meat taken very suddenly
without digestion, like as it was received, passes away by the stool.

The cause of this scowring may be great cold and moisture, which does so
benumme natural heat, that the meat cannot digest, neither can the stomach
retain and keep it. Contrariwise, may this laske be also caused through
outward heat, which does so discuss the natural warmth, and cause it to
euaporate, that thereby ye digestion is utterly overthrown. In like manner
also, this flixe comes through stripes, falls, thrusts, and bathing in cold
water, distemperature of the stomach, and of other parts, debilitie of the
retentiue and strength of the expulsive virtue, a cold complexion, (for that it
is seldom caused through heat) impostumes of the stomach, which expels
the meat and drink, as things whereby the stomach is hurt. Item, it does
also come to pass, that the vowels be too slipperie, or that there is too much
meat, or that it be hurtful, whereby it does make a great disturbance in the
guts.

If so be that the meats be not kept or holden in the stomach, but before the
due time, without great alteration, through the laske be expelled, with a
gnawing in the stomach, and with thirst, and when before meat there comes
forth a little corrupted matter; then may it be well concluded that it is
Lienteria, which is caused of Cholera. To cure this, and all other scowrings
(of whatsoever causes they proceed) this common rule following is to be
observed: to wit, that all those things (wherewith you purpose to stay it) are
to be used before meat, then does the same press the meat downwards, and
increases the laske, like as in the former 13.. has been taught.

But to proceed with this laske (wherein the meat is not digested) first give
to the sick body the juice of Pomegranats, burnt Iuorie, and Roses, of each
one dragme. For this is also good, boiled Veriuice, Raspes, Butchers broom,
and the juice of Quinces.

Whilst that the body is strong enough, and the sickness has not as yet
gotten the maistry, and that he may tolerate it, then must the Cholera be
purged, and especially with yellow Mirobalanes, afterward he is to use
cooling, astringent, and binding things, and to be forbidden all that is hot.
These Sirupes ensuing are passing good, as namely, sirupe of Veriuice, Quinces,
Pears, Apples, Pomegranates, and Raspes, moreover certain Simples also which
are worthy to be remembered; like as Hypocistis, blossoms of Pomegranates,
Gals, juice of Sloes, Roses, Araby Gum, sealed earth, fine Bolus, burnt Iuorie,
Camfer, Pomegranat seeds without juice, Purslaine seed, seeds of Sorrel,
Coriander, Plantaine, and Mirtles, the yellow seed of the Rose, Saunders,
Corrall, Dragon blood, Poppie seed, Horstailes, Knotgrasse, wild Vine leaves,
the juice of sharp Plantaine and the seed, and chiefly when they be parched,
and such like more.

The Fruits which are fit for this disease be Quinces, Services, Medlars, wild
Pears, black Cherries, unripe Mulberies, and such like Fruits more which do
bind and cool. You may also give Trociscos de Spodio, two or three dragmes,
mingled with the water of Knotgrasse, or Plantaine, and because that we have
before spoken much of them, and shall be used often hereafter, we shall here
learn how to prepare them: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, (which is Spodium whereof
they have their name) Sorrel seeds, the seeds of Butchers broom, Trocisci
de Spodio.
blossoms of Pomegranates, and Gum of Araby, of each a like quantity: make
thereof Trociscos, each of the weight of a quarter of an ounce, and give it
them to drink, as is said, with one ounce of the juice of Quinces.

Another: Take Roses one ounce and a half, burnt Iuory one ounce and a
quarter, the seeds of Sorrel three quarters of an ounce, Purslaine seed,
prepared Coriander seeds, and peeled Butchers broom seed, of each two
dragmes and a half, Starch, blossoms of Pomegranats, and Barberies, of each
one quarter of an ounce, parched Gum one drag. and a half, temper all together
with Veriuice. These Trocisks are good for all Agues which be caused of
Cholera, and that have a laske admixed, also for all tumors of the stomach,
and continual thirst.

Other Trociskes. Take fine Bolus, sealed earth, Corrall, Saunders, Sumach,
Barberies, Quincekernels, blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Gals, of each one
dragme, beat them all small together, and temper them with the juice of
Plantaine and of Wormwood, and then form them into Trocisces when you will
use them; then take a dragme or twain thereof with Milk wherein glowing
pibbles are slaked. But if then this scowring and the Ague do not wear away
with all the use of these foresaid things, then take fine Bolus, sealed earth,
and burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an ounce, Amber, Roses, blossoms of
Pomegranates, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, and Cinnamome, of each one dragme
and a half, make them into powder, take thereof five dragmes, Buttermilke six
ounces, and give it him at one time, to wit, before noone.

If so be that the stomach be hurt through the choler, (which may be perceived
hereby, if there come any corruption or matter with the stool) then take Barley
water and Honey water, of each three spoonfuls, and give it the sick body to
drink, it cleanses all that is excoriated. Afterward he shall use this
following to heal withal: Take Dragagant, Gum, Mastick, Frankincense, Amber,
of each one dragme, stamp all these into a subtle powder, and make thereof pills
with the juice of Wormwood, whereof he is to take twain every morning.

Plasters are also very requisite for this, whereof here follow twain: Take
the juice of Medlars, Services, green Pomegranate pills and the flowers, of
each one ounce, 15. or 16. Prunes, whereof the stones be taken out, the juice
of Quinces, red Wine, of each six ounces, oil of Mirtles and Quinces, of each
three ounces, Masticke, Colophonia, yellow Rose seeds, Sloes, and Rye meal of
each one quarter of an ounce, the middlemost pills of Chestnuts, three dragmes,
Wax as much as is needful, and a little Vinegar: spread it on a cloth, and
lay it over the whole belly.

The second. Take the juice of Plantaine three ounces, Rose water, Vinegar, of
each one ounce, Butchers broom seed, Barberries, Mirobalans Chebuli, Indi,
Emblici, Bellirici, Citrini, of each two ounces, red Coral, red and white
Saunders, yellow Rose seed, Masticke, of each one dragme, blossoms and pills
of Pomegranates, Gals, of each half an ounce, Lentill meal as much as is
needful for to make a meetly soft plaster. This plaster is of a marvelous
operation, if there be any unnatural heat with the laske.

His diet is to be all manner of sower and cold things, wherewith he must also
dress his boiled and roasted meats. He must temper his drink with Rose water
wherein Butchers broom seed has been steeped: parched Rice decocted in
Goats milk, and parched Barley sodden in Almond milk are very requisite for
him. All that which is hot of nature, and is laxatiue, must he forbear; as
also all that does augment Choleram.

But if this scouring be caused through weakness of the retentiue power, be
it of the stomach or of the bowels, then are those parts to be comforted, and
that with odoriferous and binding medicines, as follows: Take Cypers roots,
Masticke, Calmus, Smallage, and Comin, (which has first been steeped in
Vinegar) Gals, Cypers nuts and the leaves, Myrtle seed, Raisins stones, dried
Pomegranate kernels, Frankincense, and Masticke, of each a like much: make a
powder thereof, and give it in the morning fasting to drink one quarter of an
ounce, with good wine or steeled milk. Outwardly anoint the stomach and the
whole belly with oil of Masticke or Wormwood, and wear upon it a plaster of
Masticke: He is also to use Marmalade.

But when this scowring causes no gnawing or griping in the stomach, nor yet
yields any corrupt matter from it, but only a tough slimy substance, and
when there is no great thirst with it, but only some belching; then is it a
certain sign that this scowring is caused through Phlegma. For this, the
patient is to use al such things as extenuate and loose this slime, as Mustard
seed, salt fish, and such like. Afterward shall he force himself to vomit,
with salt, Vinegar, sodden Honey, or with some other thing, which expels
phlegm. And if that will not suffice, then use this following.

Take Aloes one ounce, the inside of Coloquinte, and Indie salt, of each half
an ounce, Turbith one dragme; make pills thereof: and you are to take of these
but one Pill at once. For this disease are the purgations commodious, which
hereafter be described against the pain of the stomach through Phlegma.

Some other do write a more proper cure, to wit, Take sirupe of Wormwood and
Mints, of each three ounces, temper them, and drink thereof at each time two
ounces, with three ounces of the decoction wherein Pease, Mints, and Spike were
boiled. Afterward purge with the pills called Stomachicae: Also use vomiting
herewith, as is before rehearsed; for it is very commodious in this case, if it
weaken not too much. For his meat he is to use all dry things, as roasted field
fowls, and chiefly roasted Larkes, Turtle doves, and such like as do not
suddenly pass away: yet always a little at once, and no more than the
stomach is well able to bear.

This medicine following is not only for Lienteria, but also for the laske
called Diarrhea, very good: it detaineth the meats received in the stomach;
which also with the bowels, it does warm, strengthen and dry.

Take Cypers nuts and the leaves, dried Mints, Masticke, Frankincense with his
rindes, gross Cinnamom, Mace and Galingall, of each three dragmes, Cresses
seeds, Comin, and prepared Coriander (all together a little parched) of each
half an ounce, Laudanum, red Styrax, Ambra, Citron pills, of each one drag. and
a half, Lignum Aloes and Spica, of each one drag. make thereof Trocisces of
the weight of one dragme and a half, and give the patient thereof at every
time, as well before dinner, as before supper, with some milk, wherein pibble
stones be slaked. Also you may minister of this powder alone one drag. or to
make a confection of it with Sugar. This patient is also to use some sour and
salt things before and after meat, as Capers and Olives, which be requisite
also for this purpose. For these cold phlegmatic scowrings be these simple,
warming, and binding remedies very good: parched Comin, Ameos, Annis,
Frankincense, Mirrhe, Styrax, Mastick, Nutmegs, Cypers nuts, Laudanum, parched
Rubarb, Wormwood, Mints, Lignum Aloes, roots of Cypers, Bucks and Hares
rennet. Of co^fections and confected things may he use confected Ginger,
Diagalanga, Diatrion pipereon, de Cymino, Marmalad with Spices, and sometimes
Treacle and Mithridate. Item, there is also very profitable for this, strong
Wine, as Muscadell, Malmsey, and such like, and otherwhiles a good pull, or
hearty draught drunk thereof.

But for a common drink he shall use clear white Wine, which is meetely
strong, which can well heat and dry the stomach.

Hereafter be many things described, which may be used with advantage for this
scowring, with this condition always, to discern warmth and cold.

Of the Laske Diarrhaea.. 15.
THis looseness of the belly is thus described: Diarrhaea is a watrish laske,
with griping, but without excoriation of the bowels, and without heat, caused
diversely, whereby the body is consumed and diseased. This scouring is caused of
all humors of the body, that is, of Blood, Cholera, Phlegma, and of
Melancholia, and proceeds not always from some particular part of the body,
but rather from the whole body, as through weakness of nature, in such as let
hands and feet fall through great weakness.

The learned do discover six kinds of causes of this Diarrhaea: whereof the
first is caused of the Gall and the Liver: the second of the stomach only, but
sometimes out of the Liver also, which two are the principallest members,
amongst which the other four be comprehended. Thirdly, this scouring is also
very well caused through the obstruction of the small veins which are called
Mesaraicae. Fourthly, of the Milt. Fifthly, this laske is also sometimes caused
of the brains. Sixthly, through windines, whereof we shall hereafter write more
at large.

When as now this scowring is caused of the Liver and Gall, then is Cholera
very abundant; or if the same be but very little, yet is the same so hot and
so sharp, that nature cannot abide her gnawing and heat, but seeks to expel
the same by all means possible, so that the perfect digestion might not
thereby be weakened: therefore you have for this first infirmity these signs
following, to wit, when the meat digested passes away with a subtle, ill
colored and whitish watrishnes, then it is a sign that the Liver is feebled
and ouercold. For this, there is to be given to the patient the confection of
Iron dross which is Scoria Ferri, or some other things, which warm the Liver,
and strengthen it. For which, you shall find here before sundry remedies,
where we have spoken of Lienteriae, which do warm and strengthen the inward
parts in such like lasks, which you may use at this present, each alone, or
mixed: here follow the remedies which be requisite for this intent.

Take Trociscos de Spodio, Rubarb, and winter Cherries, of each one scruple,
beat them all small, and make thereof with Agrimony water six or seven pills,
take them every morning with Smalladge water. Item, take Myrtle seed, and Nut
blossoms, of each one dragme, Amber, Zeduary, of each one scruple, beat and
temper them all together, and part them in five equal parts.

This plaster following is also to be prepared: Take Annis, Comin, Cresses
seed parched together, and Frankincense, of each three drag. the juice of
Wormwood one ounce and a half, Rose water two ounces, strong Vinegar one
ounce, beaten Cypers nuts, as much as suffices for to make a plaster with it:
these being made, then lay it warm upon the Liver and Stomach, and upon the
parts adjoining.

You may also use this salve following: Take oil of wild Roses one ounce and a
half, oil of Spica one ounce, Mastick and Rubarb, of each one dragme, a
little Wax, melt the same in the oils, and when it begins to cool, mix
the rest with it.

Item, take Spec. Triasantali one dragme, fine Bolus, Trociscos de Spodio, of
each half a drag. Mastick one scruple, oil of Wormwood, of Capers, of each
half an ounce, a little Wax, make a salve of them.

But if this scowring do proceed of heat, then are cooling and binding
medicines to be used for it, like as herebefore in Lienteria, where it is
sufficiently discoursed, Triasantali, Diapenidionis, of each one quarter of an
ounce, red Corrall, and prepared Coriander, of each half a dragme, Quince
kernels, Sorrel seed, Raisin stones, of each one scruple, Cinnamome,
Frankincense, of each five grains, Conserve of dry Roses one ounce, Rose water
two ounces, white Sugar nine ounces: sees the Sugar in the foresaid water, and
make a confection of it. Item, take old conserve of Roses, and Marmalade, of
each one ounce, sirupe of Mirtles, as much as suffices for to make therewith a
Confection. Another. Take the Species of Diarrhodon Abbatis, prepared Wolves
liver, and Rubarb, of each half an ounce, Sugar which is clarified with Rose
water, as much as you please: make a confection thereof, or cast Tabulats of
it. You are also to mix amongst it as much burnt Iuorie as you please.

Or take at the Apothecaries the confection called Diacracoma, or Diacurcuma,
and Currants, of each one ounce, Rubarb, prepared liver of a Wolf, of each one
dragme, burnt Iuorie half a dragme, Philonium Persicum one dragme Syrupi de
Byzantijs, as much as is needful for to make therewith a Confection, then take
always thereof about the third day one quarter of an ounce, or a little more at
once.

This following is also very good: Take old conserve of Roses four ounces,
Marmalade two ounces, prepared Coriander one dragme, Nutmegs half a dragme,
confected Mirobalans Chebuli one ounce, cleansed Pistacies half an ounce,
Almonds three dragmes, beat them all small together, and then make a
confection of it with the juice of Quinces: sirupe of dried Roses does commonly
stay all scowrings.

Take cleansed roots of Burres, and sees them until they be mellow,
afterward fry them in Butter, and eat them. Item, take a Nutmeg be it great
or small, let it sweat well in hot ashes, and eat it as it is, or strew it
upon a roasted Partridge, or some such like thing. Or take a Turtle Dove,
prepare it, and fill it with new Wax, with Mirtles, and Butchers Broom seed,
let it then be roasted by a mild fire, and afterward eat it, it binds
maruellously. It is also required by expert Physicians, that new laid Eggs are
to be fried in Wax. Other do take an Eg, and roast it upon a hot tyle, and
strew upon it the powder of Nutmegs.

But if it be not given at due time, then does it bring more damage than
commodity.

This powder following are you also to prepare: Take Species Aromatici Rosati,
one drag. Cinnamome one dragme and a half, prepared Coriander two scruples,
Roses and red Corrall, of each one scruple, Sugar four ounces. Item, take
parched Cresses seed and Masticke, of each one dragme, give him this with the
sirupe of Quinces. Some do give Cresses seed alone, with the sirupe of Quinces.

We will now recite certain Potions: Take Myrtle seed one drag. give it him
with rain water or Plantaine water three ounces, and let him drink it. Or
take Liuerwort one handful, Endive roots, Fennel, Smallage, Butchers broom,
Sperage, and Parsley, of each two handfuls, Agrimony half a handful, Currants
one ounce: cut all that is to be cut, and let it be sodden in Pullet broth or
water, until that the third part be wasted, then drink thereof a cruse full,
and temper amongst it half a drag. of prepared Fox lights. Item, take
Tormentill one dragme, give the patient to drink thereof four or five times
in red Wine.

Or take the rindes of a Pear tree one handful, a good pint of red Wine: let
them sees together so long as one may sees an hard Egg, and drink a good
hearty draught of it very warm. But for his accustomed drink he may prepare
this following: Take about 50. Sloes, and power upon it about a good half
pint of seething Wine, afterward cover it close, and let it be cold together:
this being done, then power all together into three pintes of Wine, and drink
thereof a good draught.

A roasted Quince pear eaten early in the morning, is also very good. Some do
say that one must drink Beer or Wine, which has stood a while upon Bolus.
For this, is also steeled water good, wherein is slaked Steel, Iron, Gold,
Silver, or pibble stones; yea, all the patients meat is to be dressed with it.

Item, take of the pizzle of a Heart as much as you please, shaven or grated
small, and put it in your drink. Item, take a dried Otters liver, beat it to
powder, and drink thereof the quantity of a Bean with warm Milk, or with
red Wine, it is said that it is tried.

Likewise is commended Plantaine decocted in Vinegar, and the broth being
drunken. The water also of Oaken leaves does stop much, being drunken warm.
The like does also the juice of Sloes, with the stones of Raisins being beaten
together, and the water distilled thereof and drunken. You have also in the
first part, the first Chapter, and 3.. a good water of the crumbs of burnt
bread, which is especial good for this scowring or laske.

This plaster following is also especially commended for this: Take broad
Plantaine xij. ounces, the leaves of the Pomegranate tree, Comfrey, Daisies,
and the leaves of Palma Christi, of each two ounces, (being all green) the
seed of Butchers Broom, Gals, Myrtle seed, of each one ounce, prepared
Coriander one ounce, sealed earth half an ounce, Dragon blood one quarter of
an ounce, fine Bolus three ounces, Saffron half a drag. Mace three drag. Gum,
Dragagant, both parched, of each half an ounce: first beat the leaves, and
sees them in three pintes of water, then put unto it three ounces of red
Vinegar, then let it sees well again, and strain the decoction, then stamp
that which is boiled with all the rest. Lastly, temper half a dragme of Camfer
with it: and make a supple plaster of it, and lay it over the whole Belly.

If so be that this scouring proceed from the stomach, (even as it may as
well as from the Liver) then has the same the like cause, to wit, Phlegma and
Cholera. And hereby it may be discerned that it proceeds from the stomach,
if so be that there appear no feebleness of the Liver, and if so be that
which the patient does avoid be very white and thin, and that the stomach be
grieved. The chief cause is, that many superfluous humors do aggrauate the
same: or, that there is much meat and drink together in the stomach, and
especially when as both these things do concur, to wit, many superfluous
humors, and much meat and drink. So that then the meat and drink is of
necessity for a time expelled out of the stomach, be it through weakness of
the retentiue, or through the efficacy of the expulsive virtue, or that the
digestion be of it self so faint, that the meat thereby as half digested
must pass through the stomach. And to find good advice for this, the
stomach must be strengthened and heated, for which is very meet Marmalade
with Spices, but especially this powder following: Take dry Pomegranat kernels
parched and beaten small one dragme, Caruway, Coriander, both steeped in
Vinegar, dried and parched, of each two ounces and a half, Lignum Aloes,
blossoms of Pomegranats, and Butchers Broom, of each one dragme, make powder
of all these, and give a dragme of it at one time.

Item, take Mirobalani Chebuli, which be a little parched, one quarter of an
ounce, Myrtle seed one drag. sirupe of Myrtle one ounce, use this as occasion
serves. Item, take the shales of yellow Mirobalans which be parched, one
quarter of an ounce, beat them small, and give them to drink with two ounces
of Plantaine water. In fine, all sorts of Mirobalans a little parched, are good
for all scourings of the belly, of whatsoever cause they do proceed.

Afterward, you are to use the confections of Diacalamintha. In like manner
also Annis seed, and roasted hasell nuts. Of the foresaid hasel nuts one may
make milk with steeled water, and also the same being confected with Sugar.
Afterward you must anoint the stomach with oil, as namely with the oil of
Masticke, or Frankincense, and so cover it warm. The patient must sees
Mastick with red Wine, and drink the same, if so be that the same go not
clean against him.

But if this scouring do come through Cholera, it may be perceived by the
yellow excrements which do smart much in the fundament, as also by the thirst,
and by the Ague: Then are you to give him Trociscos de Spodio, with parched
Barley broth, which is made as follows: Parched Barley broth.
Take parched Barley beaten, and power so much water upon it until it be well
covered, then let it boil until it be very thick, and afterward wring it
out. Of this decoction are you to take four ounces, and two or three dragmes
of these Trociscos, and then mingle it with so much Iuorie and Gum, as one can
drink at one time. Item, take one drag. and a half of yellow Mirobalanes,
Chebuli, and Indi, of each one scruple, parched Rubarb four scruples,
Dragagant half a drag. steep all these in two ounces of the juice of Quinces,
one ounce of Endive water, and half an ounce of the water of Pellitory, wring
it out hard, and take it luke warm.

Item, take Rubarb one drag. or one and a half, parch it, and powne it to
powder, and drink it with three ounces of Plantaine water.

Take of the best Rubarb one drag. and a half, parch it, and beat it to
powder, the pills of Mirobalans Chebuli one dragme, Masticke three dragmes, the
juice of Quinces half an ounce, the water of broad Plantaine three or four
ounces: temper them together, and drink it fasting in the morning.

Some that be prone to this scowring, do accustom every week two times to
eat one drag. of Rubarb parched. Item, take the confection of Micleta one
ounce and a half, Trociscos de Spodio one dragme, temper it with three ounces
of rain water, and drink it early in the morning. Take yellow Mirobalans and
Rubarb, of each one dragme, Dragagant and Gum, of each one scruple, parched
together, Cucubes, fine Bolus, of each half a scruple, beaten small together,
then temper with it sufficient sirupe of Mirtles, and when as then you will use
of it, break it as is aforesaid.

A powder wherewith the patients meat is to be strewed: Take good Rubarb one
dragme and a half, yellow Mirobalans one quarter of an ounce, both parched,
fine Bolus one dragme, yellow Saunders, red Coral, of each one scrup. prepared
Pearls one dragme, Trociscos de Spodio one dragme, make thereof a subtle
powder. You may also take the weight of one dragme and a half with Plantaine
water.

For this be also Clisters requisite, as hereafter follow: Take the broth of a
Lambs head and a Calves head one pint, sees oaken leaves in it, broad and
picked Plantaine, of each one handful and a half, parched Barley half a
handful: let them sees unto the half, then take of this decoction, and put
unto it the yolks of a couple of Eggs brayed well, oil of Roses two ounces,
oil of Violets two ounces, and then minister this Clister warm.

Item, take prepared Coriander, Myrtle seed, Acorne cups, the seeds of
Plantaine, and juice of Sloes, of each one handful, Fennel, Comin, and Annis,
of each half a handful, pills of Pomegranates two handfuls; let them sees
together in sufficient water: then take of this decoction twelve or sixteen
ounces, oil of Roses three ounces, Honey of Roses one ounce, Deeres suet two
ounces: melt it, and make a Clister of it. Also the decoction of Rice is good,
if the cause of this laske be in the lower guts.

Hereafter be described commodious pills: Take the stones of all Mirobalanes,
beat them when they be well parched, Rubarb parched, fine Bolus, and Amber, of
each a like quantity, make a mass of pills of it, with Dragagant and Gum,
dissolved in Plantaine water: but if there be an Ague with it, then use Barley
water.

Or take one quarter of an ounce of Rubarb, which is parched, burnt Iuorie one
dragme, make pills of it as is before said.

Item, filed steel one dragme, Cypers nuts one quarter of an ounce, Masticke,
Amber, Comfrey, Daisies, Plantaine seed, of each one scruple, Gum and
Dragagant both parched, of each half a dragme, Cinnamome, Galingall, and
Grains, of each two scruples: make pills thereof with the juice of Plantaine,
for they do bind much.

Others mo. Take unsalted Deeres rennet one dragme, Trociscos de Spodio, De
Carabe, De Terra Sigillata, of each one scruple, well parched Rubarb, Plantaine
seed also parched, of each half a scruple, beat them small together, make
pills of them, with the juice of Plantaine, when they be tempered with the
sirupe of Mirtles, then do they bind the more.

Item, take Hypocistis, blossoms of Pomegranates, Butchers Broom, Barberies,
Sorrel seed, of each one dragme and a half, Purslaine seed, and Plantaine,
both parched, of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood, worme-eaten
Galls, the juice of Sloes, yellow seeds of Roses, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Henbane seed one scruple, Opium two scruples and a half: make pills
thereof with the juice of Plantaine, and form seven of a dragme. But note
yet, that they be very strong, and that one must not use many.

This following is more gentle: Take Gum, Masticke, Frankincense, Amber, of
each half a dragme, temper them with the sirupe of Roses unto pills, and take
always thereof twice a day, a little or much before meat, according as the
scowring is violent.

For this scowring is always good all roast meat, fried Eggs, Rice, and
Lettice, (if it be with great heat) Calves feet, conserve of Rosser fruits,
Musk Pears, before meals old conserve of Roses, conserve of water Lillies,
Marmalade, preserved Bayberies, and also preserved Sloes.

The drink for this patient must be steeled water, wherein Myrtle seed is
decocted, also Hearts tongue, Wine drunken warm. These Sirupes following are very
good, as namely, sirupe of Mirtles, dried Roses, Mints, and also honey of Roses:
for it has a mild binding, and an astringent virtue, like as veriuice has
also.

The smoke or reke of Frankincense is also very good. Milk put into Clisters
when it is steeled is commended for this purpose. Note ye, that all that we
have sufficiently written of before is also good for the red or bloody flixe,
whereof we will shortly hereafter speak and discourse.

Of the scowring which proceeds of the Liver and Stomach.. 16.
IT comes also verily to pass, that the Liver and the Stomach do cause this
scowring, which is then very dangerous: so that the dropsy called Tympanites
is wont to follow it. Therefore is an order made an ordained, what one ought to
observe for this. Wherein first it is needful that he forbear all meats and
drinks which be laxatiue, or do in any wise molest the body, as Spinach, Beets,
Mallows, Mercury, well boiled Colewoorts, and such like.

He must also be restrained from new wines, and them that be not very old.
Likewise also of all sharp, salt and sower things, as Radishes, Onions,
Garlic, hard, meats, unleavened bread, and that which is not well baked. And
he must eschew fruits, and specially them that be laxatiue, as Figs, Grapes,
Prunes, and such like. In fine, for this sickness the patient is to be kept
very sober in eating and drinking, and to feed only upon that which is light
of digestion. He must also abstain from all violent motions, and that chiefly
after meat, from venerie, much watching, and anger. All his meats (be they
sodde^ or roasted) must be dressed with Deeres sewet. Secondly, he must beware of
many kinds of meats, especially against night. Thirdly, before every meal he
must eat a roasted Quince pear, or four or five Medlars. Fourthly, Lentils
are very hail meat for him, if they be dressed after this manner: Let them first
sees a little in vinegar, after that boil them with two parts of water and
one part of vinegar. Fifthly, every evening he is to take three of these pills
ensuing: Take parched Dragagant and Gum, of each one dragme, Butchers Broom
seed, Myrtle seed, Acorne cups, burnt Iuorie, Squinant, Roses, Cypers roots,
of each two scruples, whereof make pills with the juice of Daisies before noone.
He is to use this confection ensuing: Take Marmalade without spices three
ounces, prepared Coriander and Mastick, of each one dragme, temper them with
the juice of Quinces, and use each time half an ounce or more.

Also once every eight days take two of these pills: Take Trociscos de Spodio,
one quarter of an ounce, parched Rubarbe half a dragme, burnt Iuorie and
parched Dragagant, of each one scruple, Hares rennet, or the rennet of a young
Goat or Kid, one dragme and a half: make pills thereof, and use them as all
the rest.

This plaster also following is to be made, and worn upon the navel: Take
two ounces of Rosin, Cypers nuts one dragme and a half, Plantaine seed, the
juice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie, Roses, Iro^ dross that is prepared, of each one
dragme, Mace two scruples, but the Rosin must be boiled in red vinegar. When it
is sufficiently sodden, and almost cold, then temper all the foresaid Species
with it, spread of it upon a piece of leather the quantity of a quarter of a
yard four square, and lay this plaster upon the nauel downwards. As often as
the patient goes to stool, he is to fume his fundament with this powder
ensuing: Take Colophonia, Gallia Muscata and red Styrax, of each half a
dragme, Lignum Aloes one dragme, red Coral, burnt Iuorie, Sandaraca, of each
two scruples: powne them all together, and temper them all together. Afterward
strew some of it upon hot coals. It is also good advise that there be always
boiled in his meat, as much Comfrey as the bigness of a great finger.

Lastly, he must continually wear this bag ensuing upon his stomach: Take
Myrtle seed, prepared Coriander, Marierom and Nep, of each one handful, Mace
half an ounce, Masticke, Gallia Muscata, red Styrax, red Coral and Sandaraca,
of each one quarter of an ounce Lignum Aloes one dragme and a half, parched
Comin half an ounce, temper them, and use it as aforesaid.

Thus far have we spoken of this Scowring, and of both the causes of it, as of
the stomach and of the liver, and also how they both do come together.

The third cause of this Diarrhaea is the obstruction of the small veins, and
are called of the Grecians Mesenterion or Mesaraeon, for that as the stomach
and the entrails have done their duties, so if these veins do not suck out
the nourishment, then does nature expel the meat in manner of a thick pap,
with pain in the right side and in the bowels, and so out of the body,
especially if one have eaten much gross and sweet meat before. Also this
scowring may be well caused of an impostume, which might be about the small
veins, or about the upper guts, at which time is commonly perceived an ague,
heat and pain: which obstruction does also proceed for the most part, of
gross and tough humors.

For this disease vomiting is one of the best remedies. Also this sirupe
following is to be used: Take the roots of Smallage, Parsley, Butchers broom,
Sperage, grass and Cicorie, of each one dragme, the seeds of Smallage and of
Parsley, Comin and Fennel, of each one ounce: let this sees well together,
and wring it out, and to this Colature add half a pint of honey, and boil it
again, and clarify it as behooves. Give thereof to the patient every morning
four or five ounces. Also the seeds of Smallage, Ameos, and Parsley decocted
in wine, may be used for this, being given the patient to drink: in like
manner parched Rubarbe with wine or Endive water. This patient shall also
oftentimes, but at each time eat a little, and take ever after it some
penetrating things, as Diacalaminthum one dragme and a half before meat, and
half a dragme after meat. His drink must be likewise old white wine. Also to
take otherwhiles some Treacle is very commodious. It is also very good, that
the belly be strongly rubbed before and after noone with a rough cloth.

The fourth cause of this laske proceeds from the milt, the which may be
known hereby, to wit, when his excrements are a black and dark gray, if the
pain be in the left side, if ye patient be melancholicke, quiet and tractable.
When the matter is very sharp and blackish, then is there great danger with
it. But if it happen in the end of a quartaine ague, or of any other sickness,
then does it bring ease with it, and is a sign of health. What is fit for
this, you may see hereafter, where we shall discourse of the Milt.

The fifth cause proceeds from the brains, which may be discerned by the
pain of the head: also by the rheum, and by the slime of the mouth, which
after sleep runs out of the same, and is also expelled by stool. These
diseases are to be cured like as all other rheumaticke diseases, whereof you
find sufficient discourse in the second Part, the 12. Chapter, and 2.. But it
is especially commended, that parched Melilot shall be laid upon the forehead.
Otherwhiles a bag with Cammomill and Roses, and so to govern himself, as
abouesayd, in the second cause of the stomach.

The last cause is windiness, which puffs up the stomach, spoyleth
digestion, and provoke a scowring, like as hereafter shall be taught in the
description of windiness of the stomach. It is also counseled to every such
patient (like as is often showed before) that he must be very sober in eating
and drinking, yea he must suffer hunger as much as is possible, and that he
exercise himself well before meals, and use the Confection Diacyminum or
Diacalamintha, which do strengthen his stomach, and let him govern himself
in all things else, as has been said before in Lienteria.

Of the Laske Dysenteria, called the red Flixe.. 17.
THis name Dysenteria, is of the Grecians so called, being an vlceration or
excoriation of the Entrails, and is thus described: Dysenteria is a pain of
the Entrails, which enflameth, fretteth, and excoriateth the same: so that
with the matter of the scowring, blood is avoided; and it causes much gnawing,
which makes the patient to go often to the stool.

Or thus: Dysenteria is a scowring, with an exulceration of the bowels, which
is increased through outward causes, as heat, cold, drink, hard meat. The
causes of this noisome scowring are sharp humors, which pass through the
bowels, and there exulcerate the same, fret and take away their fatnes. Item by
the taking of too sharp medicines, as Diagridion, Esula, and Neesing woort, or
when too much of these has been taken at once.

Also this scowring is occasioned, when the body is ouercharged with Cholera,
Melancholia, or Phlegma, of which superfluities, if the expulsive virtue be
strong, nature seeks to unburden her self. Likewise also, when the meat in
the stomach, or humors in the veins do putrify.

In like manner also of great and long alteration of the air, be it in hot
air, dry air, or when these meet together: like as dry air it self is wont
to cause Choleram. Item, of the use of such fruits which do quickly putrify:
therefore it is not commendable, and especially that children should eat the
same.

The signs of this red scouring or bloody Flixe are these, which do not come
suddenly upon one: also before it gets the masterie, it provoke pain and
gripings in the bowels, and also round about the stomach. This scouring
likewise burns and pricketh sore, whereupon does first follow the scraping of
the bowels, mixed with a little blood, until it corrode somewhat deeper into
the bowels; then is the pain felt most above the Navel: and if so be that the
disease be in the great guts, then is the pain felt most under the Navel.
Also the scraping of the lowermost guts are much fatter then of the uppermost:
and it does come also in greater abundance, with many more such like
demonstrations.

But there be discribed two sorts of Dysenteria, whereof the first is here
before discovered: The second has the name of Dysenteria unjustly, by reason
that it without scraping of the bowels, and very suddenly falls upon one,
with much blood. This with good right is to be called rather an Hepaticall
Flixe than Dysenteria: but we will here first of all write of the right
Dysenteria, and afterward of the Flixe of the liver.

If we desire to prevent this red Flixe or Dysenteria, then is the same to be
done both through outward and also inward means. But first we will show what
is best to be used inwardly for it: wherefore you are first to keep in your
memory the common rules which have bin rehearsed before in the Laske Lienteria,
to wit, that all those things wherewith you will stay this scouring, be always
ministered before meats, for that after meat these binding medicines cause a
sick body to scour the more.

For this scowring or red Flixe all expert Physicians do use commonly at the
first parched Mirobalanes, and chiefly the yellow, steeped in Plantaine water,
and put also unto it parched Rubarb, beaten to powder. But the same must not be
infused but in substance and powder, like as you have seen before in some
potions, for the scowring of Cholera. Item, take parched seeds of Fleawoort
two ounces and a half, seeds of Plantaine one ounce and a quarter, Gum, fine
Bolus, of each three dragmes, in the juice of Quinces defecate.

Or take dried Quinces, beat them to powder, and give thereof one dragme and a
half, with Plantaine water, once or twice a day, wherewith you may also temper
parched Nutmegs, and the seeds of Plantaine. Item, take parched Gum one ounce,
sealed earth three quarters of an ounce, fine Bolus half an ounce; make powder
thereof, and give of it one dragme and a half at once. Item, take Shepherds
purse, S. John's woort, and Penniroyall, of each a like quantity: make a powder
of it: and give two dragmes thereof at once in the morning early, with a new
laid eg: this stays the scouring evidently. Burnt Hearts horn washed in Rose
water or Plantaine water, a dragme, or a dragme and a half, taken with wine
wherein a little Dragagant is dissolved, is a very expert medicine, if it be
taken twice a day. The like also of one dragme of the rennet of a young Hare
taken with wine.

Another: Take broad Plantaine seed, and Colombine seed, both parched and
beaten to powder, of each a like quantity, and give each time thereof two
scruples, or one dragme, with red Wine. Item take small beaten Bloudstone, well
washed in Plantaine water, three drag. red Coral one dragme and a half,
roots of Tormentill, and Trociscos de Spodio, of each one dragme, shaue^
Iuorie, burnt Hearts horn, of each two scruples, prepared Pearls one quarter
of an ounce, fine Bolus half a dragme: beaten them all small, and take two
dragmes of this powder in the morning with Wine. You may also strew the meat
with the same.

Item, burn Frogs to ashes in a pot, and use thereof as before, for they have
a marvelous operation to staunch blood.

In like sort may for many purposes be used Myrtle seed, the seeds of
Butchers brooome, Pomegranate kernels, sealed earth, fine Bolus, and other
binding medicines, which are to be beaten to powder, and as the case requires,
may be used well enough for the red flixe.

Here follows now a notable confection against all species of scouring, and
the same may be used after what sort one will. Take pills and blossoms of
Pomegranats, Gals, and Acorne cups, of each one quarter of an ounce, Raisin
stones, Myrtle seeds, burnt hasell nuts, dry Pomegranate kernels, yellow Rose
seed, the juice of Sloes, Butchers broom seed, of each two ounces, red
Coral, Frankincense, Masticke, white and black Poppie seed, parched Gum, the
seed of Fleawort, Starch, Dragon blood, of each one dragme and a half, Sugar
six ounces; temper them well together, whereof you may make a confection with
Sugar, or with Plantaine water, or Tabulates; or strew the powder alone upon
the meat. You may also make pills thereof, which are to be used in the morning
betimes, and in the evening two hours after supper: but of the confection may
be used three or four times a day, like as necessity requires, at each time
one quarter or half an ounce.

Here follows yet another, which may be used after the same manner: Take
Butchers broom seed, fine Bolus, and Gum, of each three dragmes and one
scruple, Dragon blood, and burnt Iuorie, of each one dragme and seven grains,
Cloves strigs, Annis, of each four scrup. Hypocistis one scruple and three
grains, Blood stone two dragmes and a half, red and white Corrall, of each
two scruples, Amber one quarter of an ounce, Comfrey, Daisies, Roses, of each
one quarter of an ounce and one scruple, blossoms of Pomegranats, Dragagant,
of each one drag. and seven grains, Myrtle seed three dragmes and one
scruple, Quince kernels, white Poppie seeds, of each five dragmes, Knotgrasse,
Sorrel seeds, yellow Rose seed, broad Plantaine seeds, and Calmus, of each one
dragme and seven grains, one pound or more of Marmalade, dissolved with Sugar
or Honey, and the other spices tempered amongst it.

Another. Take Marmalade boiled with Honey and white bread well tosted, of each
four ounces, red beaten Saunders one ounce, then put thereto a little red Wine,
and powne them all together, whereof the patient may take otherwhiles the
weight of half an ounce. Spread it also upon a cloth, and lay it upon the
stomach. This has been oftentimes approved: Take old conserues of Roses, and
Marmalade, mix them both together unto a confection made with steeled Goats
milk.

Item, take confected Quince Pears, or Marmalade, three ounces, Masticke,
Mints, and Mace, of each one dragme; temper them all together with a little of
the juice of Quinces, and make Trocisks thereof half an ounce in weight, and
you shall always take one of them before meat. Or take old conserve of Roses
three ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a half, red Corrall one dragme,
Tormentill, Bistorta, Trociscide Carabe, fine Bolus of each half a dragme,
prepared Blood stone one quarter of an ounce, temper all together with the
sirupe of Mirtles.

Item, take old conserve of Roses three ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a
half, conserve of Buglosse and Burrage, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one
dragme and a half, Corrall and Roses, of each half a dragme, prepared Pearls
two dragmes and a half, Bistorta one dragme, Tormentill two scruples; beat
them all small, and make a confection of them with the sirupe of Quinces.

It is to be noted, that the old conserve of Roses is very good for all manner
of looseness of the belly. Some commend that which is made with Sugar alone,
and not with Honey. Others use both kinds, according as the scowring is with
heat or with cold.

Rob de Cornubus.
Conserve of Cornus, called at the Apothecaries Rob de Cornubus, has great
force in binding, for all kinds of looseness of the belly, and also for women's
excessive menstrual fluxes, and for all other sorts of bleedings, and it is
thus prepared: Take ripe Cornus fruits, boil them so long in red Wine until
they may be driven through a hairen Searse or strainer, and then let that which
is strained sees until it be thick by a mild fire, stirring it about
continually, until it be a thick conserve, and preserve the same.

Mithridate and Treacle do also stay the scowring, like as does also the
conserues of water Lillies, if there be great heat withal. In like manner
conserues of Barberies used with meat in manner of a sauce.

Hereafter follow yet other things more, which may be taken for this confection:
Take Trociscos de Carabe three dragmes, Dragon blood and fine Bolus, of each
half a dragme, Plantaine seeds or Endive seeds half a dragme, Sugar four
ounces: sees them all together with Rose water, and make Tabulats of it.

This ensuing is taken to be a very good and approved remedy. Take a Nutmeg,
burn it at a Wax candle until the oil drop out, powne it to powder, and
temper with it the whites of two Eggs, and as much Bean meal as will make a
dough. Afterward make pellets of them as big as a Nut, and put them on a
stick, and roast them softy until they be thoroughly dry, whereof give to the
patient in the morning and also at evening. But if you will have the scowring
speedily stopped, then take the more Nutmeg and the less meal.

In like manner are also highly commended hard sodden eggs eaten out of vinegar,
and strewed with powder of Nutmegs. But some prefer roasted eggs alone.

Dried Peaches boiled in water and eaten, do stay the red flixe. Peaches
preserved.
Others do confect Peaches in this manner: Cut the Peaches in two pieces, and
take out the stones, tie them to a thread, and dry them in an Oven. And when
you will use them, then infuse them in water. Then be they good for the
stomach, stay the scowring, quench thirst, moysten the throat and drought of
the tongue.

Concerning the drink and such like, steeled milk is very good for children.
Item, Rose water six ounces, Cloves, Masticke, Butchers broom seed, of each
one dragme: powne them small, and put it into a glass, and let it sees in
water, and give the children a spoonefull of it.

Another drink: Take Glue that is burnt in a baking Oven four pound, poune it
small, and power fair fountain water unto it; let it seethe a waume or two.
Lastly, slake three or four times in it glowing steel: afterward strain it
clear out, and make Almond milk with it. Item, the juice of Sloes and of
Barberies are very commodious, each apart or mingled together, or drunken with
wine, like as is taught in the 15.. of the scowring Diarrhaea, and of the
Sloes. You have also in the first part and 3.. another water of Sloes, which
may be used also for this red or bloody flixe.

Sirupe of Mints is much used for all looseness of the belly: Sirupe of Mints.
therefore it is not amiss to show at this present, how it is made after two
manner of ways. Take the juice of ripe Quince pears, the juice of sweet,
meetly sweet, and of sower Pomegranates, of each four ounces and a half,
infuse therein four ounces and a half of rumpled Mints the space of four and
twenty hours with half an ounce of Roses, afterward sees them all together
by a mild fire until the half be boiled away, and then wring it through a
cloth. Further, put good honey unto it, or Sugar, six ounces, and let it sees
well and thick: lastly, hang in it a piece of silk with Lignum Aloes five
grains, Amber three grains, Musk one grain. This sirupe does not only stop
all scowrings, but is also good for all diseases of the stomach which proceed
of cold, and it does also take away all wambling and vomiting.

The other is made thus: Take clarified juice of Mints, sweet and sower juice
of Pomegranates, let this seethe all together with sufficient Sugar unto a
sirupe.

The sirupe of Quince pears is also of the same efficacy, which is also made
diversely, Sirupe of Quinces.
as follows hereafter: Take the seeds of broad Plantaine two ounces, Cipers
nuts, the middle rinds of an Oken tree, Chestnut tree, and Butchers broom, of
each two handfuls, Myrtle seed one handful, sower Quinces, Services and
Medlars, of each six, the juice of Sloes half an ounce, Hypocistis one ounce:
sees them all together in Plantaine water, and make thereof a sirupe with
sirupe.

Another: Take rain water or Rose water sixteen ounces, and sees therein one
ounce of Myrtle seed, Roses, Sumach, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, blossoms
of Pomegranats, burnt Iuorie, of each half an ounce, ten or twelve unripe
Services, Licorice, Dragagant and Gum, of each half an ounce: powne all that
is to powned, and when it is sodden away unto twelve ounces, then strain it
through a cloth, and put a pound or twain of Sugar unto it: then let it sees
again together, clarifying it unto a sirupe.

The third sort of sirups is called at the Apothecaries Miua, Miua.
which is also made two manner of ways, as follows: Take of the juice of
Quinces strained well, twelve ounces, seethe it away unto the half, and then
power good wine unto it, and nine ounces of Sugar, then let it boil again
unto a thick sirupe. This sirupe staieth the laske, and comfort the
stomach.

The other sort of Miua is called Miua Citoniorum aromatica, for that it is
prepared with good spice, like as follows: Take the juice of sower Quinces
seven common pounds, old wine half as much, clarified honey two pound and four
ounces, or one may take Sugar in stead of honey: let them seethe away scumming
it, and afterward hang in this sirupe bounden in a cloth Cinnamome, Cardamome,
of each one dragme and a half, Cloves one dragme, Ginger, Mastick, of each two
scruples, Saffron one dragme, Mace two scruples, Musk half a dragme, Gallia
Muscatae one dragme: this being all beaten gross together, wring it often out,
that the force of these may come into the sirupe. This sirupe is much warmer
than the other, and therefore it is not to be used for the looseness of the
belly which comes through heat: otherwise it strengthens the stomach, the
liver, and all inward members: it causes appetite to meat, it helps
digestion, and takes away the vomiting.

Sirupe of Mirtles.
The sirupe of Mirtles will we add unto it, for that the same is very fit for
all scowrings or flixes. Take Myrtle seed twelve ounces, the juice of Sloes
and Butchers broom seed, of each fifteen grains, Roses one ounce, burnt
Iuory and Hypocistis, of each one quarter of an ounce, Mints one dragme: sees
them all together in rain water unto the half, then strain it through, and
put unto it six ounces of the juice of Quinces, honey twelve ounces, but
clarify it well, and let it boil unto the consistence of a thick sirupe.

Another, which is very common at the Apothecaries. Take Myrtle seed ten
dragmes, white Saunders, Butchers broom seeds, blossoms of Pomegranates, of
Barberies, of each fifteen dragmes, Medlars six ounces and two dragmes, juice
of Pomegranates, juice of Crabs, of each twelve ounces: boil the foresaid
simples in these juices, and with thirty ounces of Sugar make a sirupe of them.

For this is also fit these usual Sirupes following, viz. the sirupe of
Raspes, Oxysacchara, of dry Roses, and of Pears, for therewith will the
sharpnes of the matter be delayed.

Clisters are also fit for this disease (whereof some be here set down.)
First, they are to be made, which the Physicians do call Lauatiua, which be
those that do wash the bowels, for which there is none other to be used but
Barley water only. Secondly, if it be desired to have them cleanse more, then
temper with it some honey of Roses, or a little slight Sugar. The third sort is
binding and asswaging the pain: Take a handful of parched Barley, seethe it
well in water, take of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, slight Sugar
three ounces, oil of Roses two ounces, and two yolks of Eggs. This Clister may
be often used.

It is to be noted, that there is to be taken for it oil of Roses, which is
made of Rose buds, for that it is better for this purpose. You have also a
Clister before in the fifteenth. which was made of the broth of a Lambs head.
For such a one you may use steeled water, and to sees therein the seeds of
Plantaine. But if so be that then the scrapings of the bowels pass not away
withal, there must be tempered amongst it one ounce of Deeres suet, and a
dragme of Dragons blood.

For to know whether the uppermost or the undermost bowels in the red or
bloody flixe be perished, take a handful of Dogs dung, and dissolve the same
in steeled Milk, and give this to the patient, then, if so be that he
presently with pain, with purulencie and blood avoid the same again
downward, and be mixed with the excrements, then it is a sure sign, that the
disease is in the lowermost bowels. But if he go much to stool after the
pain (the blood being separated from the excrements) and if the pain be about
the Navel, then it is a sign that the place of this flixe is in the uppermost
bowels.

If you desire to stay this bloody flixe, then are these things following to
be used, to wit, steeled water, the juice of Plantaine, the juice of the herb
Mullin, and the juice of Sloes, wherewith one may temper a few paper ashes, and
one or two yolks of Eggs sodden hard, the powder of sealed earth, or fine Bolus,
and the oil of Mirtles, of which you may choose that likes you best, and can
get soonest.

This Clister ensuing dries and heals, Take vnwormetaen Gals, Butchers
broomeseed, and Bolus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Deeres suet or Goats
suet, one ounce and a half, two hard sodden yolks of Eggs well beaten one
ounce, of the juice of Plantaine and rain water, as much as is needful for
to sees the premises in it. Or take the decoction of butchers broom seed.
This Clister is the patient to keep with him as long as ever he can.

Another. Take peeled Lentils, Millet, Roses, blossoms of Pomegranats, and
Gals, of each one handful: sees these together in a pint and a half of water
unto the half, take thereof ten ounces, of the oil of Roses one ounce, paper
ashes one dragme, and Deeres suet one ounce, and the yolke of a roasted Egg,
and make thereof a Clister.

Suppositories. Take white Henbane seed, Opium, white Poppie seed, burnt
Iuorie, blossoms of Pomegranats, and Frankincense, of each a like quantity,
boiled Honey one ounce always to a dragme of the premises, make Suppositories
of it. They be strong, they thicken the humor, procure sleep, and take away
the pain: but they be not to be used, but when the pain is intolerable.
These Pessaries may be made for women to be used in the Mother. Take
Frankincense, Linseede, and Saffron, of each one dragme, temper them well
together, and bind it in a fine cloth with a thread at it, that it may be well
plucked out again. In great extremities may the stupefactiues be used, which do
numbe the sinews, yet are they not to be used unless all inward and outward
remedies have been applied. But first of all are outward medicines, and
afterward inward to be adhibited. Likewise the remedies which be ministered by
the mouth, are first to be tried, and afterward from below.

For this are these Pills ensuing also used. Take the blossoms and pills of
Pomegranates, Pills for all manner of fluxes of blood.
Myrtle seed, Comfrey roots, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, the juice of Sloes,
Roses, Argall, Hypocistis, Butchers broom seed, and Saffron, Gallia muscata,
Gals, Cinnamome, burnt Iuorie, Mace, and Gum, of each one dragme, Opium one
dragme and a half: make of them with the juice of Plantaine, as small Pills as
hemp seeds, and give thereof nine or eleven at one time. Item, there was a
woman that voided eighteen pound of blood at three times, and she was cured
with Philonium Persicum, which was tempered with the juice of Plantaine and
parched Rubarbe. But in these weighty matters an expert Physician is to be
sent for, because (as we have told already) there is no jesting with this
Philonium.

What ought to be outwardly used for this disease.
FIrst of all it is good to bind the arms, but not the legs; then is also a
bath to be made, wherein be decocted the leaves of Quinces, Pears, Medlars,
Service tree, Cornus leaves, Butchers broom, Gals, Mirtles, Acorne cups,
Roses, and such like binding things, wherein the sick persons are to be set
even up to their nauels. Thus may you also sees the foresaid things, and wet
clothes in the decoction, and the^ lay them warm upon the belly: or in the
stead of them, to use the juice of Plantaine, or any other juices of binding
herbs, as Butchers broom seed, or Myrtle seed: and temper also the powder
amongst it, whereof be made Trocisci de Terra sigillata.

These sick persons do complain also of great pain, when the sharp humor
scoureth through the excoriated bowels. Now for to assuage the same, you are to
take of the first mentioned things, which you will: but you must put always
Cammomill and Melilot unto it, and afterward let them sees in wine or steeled
water, and then lay them with a cloth wroong out, or with a sponge upon the
pain. You may make also three or four bags of the foresaid things, and
sees them in wine, and so lay the^ warm upon the pain, and when the one is
cold, then to lay another upon it again.

There be also fumigations used for this sickness, for which is to be taken
Cypers nuts, Myrtle seed. Butchers broom seed, Pomegranate pills, and wormeaten
Gals, of each one handful, the juice of Sloes, prepared Coriander, Hypocistis,
Plantaine seed, Roses, Frankincense, Sandaraca, Gallia muscata, Bloudstone, and
Marierome, of each one handful, Cinnamome, Masticke, and parched Caruway seed,
of each one dragme, Colophonia one ounce and a half; make a powder of them,
and strew thereof upon the coals, and receive the fume from below.

Another. Take Marierome, seeds of Butchers broom, Myrtle and Coriander, of
each one handful and a half, blossoms and pills of Pomegranates Hypocistis,
and yellow Rose seeds, of each half a handful, roots of the herb Mullin,
roots of Carduus benedictus, the rinds and roots of the Mulbery tree: make all
these to powder, and then make also a bag for to sit upon, and take therewith
the first above mentioned things, and boil them in wine.

For a plaster: Take a shiue or twain of Rye bread, tossed it well, and
besprinkle it with Vinegar or red wine; afterward beat it, and put unto it
Gals, Acorne cups, the blossoms and shales of Pomegranats, and the rinds of
the Medlar tree, of each two ounces, Roses, Starch, the juice of Sloes, fine
Bolus, sealed earth and Dragon blood, of each one ounce; make them all to
powder, and put it then amongst the foresaid bread. Further, make a plaster
with a sufficient quantity of the oil of Mirtles, Roses, and Rose water, with
as much vinegar as suffices, and so lay this plaster warm upon the stomach.

This patient may also use such salues for this disease, as do hereafter
follow. Take oil of Roses, of Mirtles, oil of Quinces, and of Masticke, of
each half an ounce, Gals, Roses, blossoms of Pomegranates, Myrtle seed, fine
Bolus, Dragon blood and Mastick, of each one scrup. Wax as much as is needful
for to make a salve. This following is stronger: Take Masticke six ounces,
oil of Quinces and of Mirtles, of each three ounces, Masticke, the juice of
Sloes, and Dragons blood, of each three quarters of an ounce, red Coral,
Amber, sealed earth, of each half an ounce, the innermost pills of Chestnuts,
prepared Iron dross, of each one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus, Pomegranate
pills and Frankincense, of each one quarter of an ounce, Resin half an ounce,
Wax as much as suffices for to make an ointment thereof, wherewith the belly
must be anointed 3. or 4. times a day. This unguent is special good against
excessive flowing of the flowers in women, the same being laid upon the Hips
and upon the thighs.

Item, take Rosin three ounces, the seeds of Butchers broom, prepared
Coriander, and Myrtle seed, of each half a dragme, Masticke two scruples,
Hypocistis, red Saunders, of each half a dragme, oil of Mirtles and of
Quinces, of each one ounce and a half; melt the Rosin in Vinegar, and make a
Plaster of it, or a salve, and anoint therewith the whole Belly, and about
the Ribs.

Boxing cups are also very meet for this purpose set on vnpickt upon the
Navel, upon either side of the Navel one: this will draw back the blood. Let
them also remain thereon the space of four hours.

Some also do advise for to open the Median; other the Liver vein, thereby to
delay the sharpness of the humor, and to withdraw it, and also to cool the
Liver with it: but it is somewhat dangerous, and ought not to be effected at any
hand, except it were for some great cause, and therefore is here the counsel
of a learned Physician to be required.

For a lotion of the feet you are to take of the forementioned things, and
therewith to rub the shins and the legs.

In fine, what simples soever are to be used for this red or bloody Flixe
through heat or cold are these; to wit, in heat, take the blossoms of
Pomegranates, Gals, Butchers broomseedes, the juice of Sloes, Roses, Barberies,
Quince kernels and the rinds, Pomegranate pills, sealed earth, Bolus, burnt
Iuorie, Hypocistis, Pomegranate kernels, Sorrel seed, Plantain seed, Raisins
stones, and all binding fruits; as unripe Melons, unripe Mulberries, unripe
Sloes, Medlars, Services, the fruit of Cornus, and such like. Of compounded
things be Trisantalon, Diacodion, old conserve of Roses, and many other mo
which are before mentioned. Simples which bind and warm, are Nutmegs, Cypers
nuts and the leaves, Frankincense, Myrrh, Laudanum, red Styrax. Amber, Ameos,
Cinnamom, parched Annis, and such like. The compounded be Diamentha,
Diacinnamomum, and all that are of the like nature.

The other kind of Dysenteria or bloody Flixe.. 18.
IT has been showed before, that the learned have described yet another manner
of bloody flixe, the which by the unskillful is wrongly called by the name of
Dysenteria, for it comes without any scrapings of the guts, and with much more
blood then the former. Wherefore it is rather to be taken for a flixe of the
Liver than for ought else. This flixe is also threefold: first, idle persons
that are full of blood, and that eat and drink much; also they that omit
their wonted exercises, are very subject to this infirmity, for these of
necessity must have overmuch blood, which nature seeks to expel as she does
all such things that in any way are troublesome unto her, but especially in the
Liver, albeit that some other inward parts might cause the same.

The signs of this flixe are first clear blood, which with a great quantity
does suddenly pass away at one time, and returns again afterward. It may
also be well caused of sharp medicines, which may be understood and known of
the patient.

Secondly, it may also happen through weakness of the retentiue virtue: for
if there be no perfect digestion, then seems the blood like unto water
wherein flesh had been washed, and so is avoided with the ordure by stool. In
like manner it may be caused also very well through melancholy, and in the
scouring is the blood blacker. But if it come through the inward piles, then is
the blood clear, yet somewhat blackish. Sometime it is caused through some
vein, which chances to break within the body: And then does this scouring
come very suddenly, little or much, according to that the vein so broken is
great or small. The difference between all these fluxes of blood is, that the
Hepaticall flux is without pain, where to the contrary, all other are not
without pain and anguish of the place, from whence the blood issues.

Thus for to cure this bloody flixe, plethoricke persons who be infected with
this scouring, must betake themselves to all manner of sobriety in eating and
drinking: open a vein, use some exercise, and purge, if need require. But if
so be that the same be caused through any sharp medicine received, then is this
scouring to be stayed by taking three dragmes of Cresses seed with steeled
milk, or through any other binding medicine before mentioned.

This plaster following is to be applied on the Liver: Take Roses, red
Saunders, of each half an ounce, Spike one dragme, Barley meal two ounces,
Wine and Vinegar, as much as will suffice for to make a plaster, lay this
warm upon it. If this scouring proceed through heat, then give him
Trisantalon: Or if it come through cold, then give him some warming Confection,
and other things mo which be rehearsed before. Secondly, if there run any black
blood amongst it, then open the Median. It is also good for this, that the
body be well rubbed morning and evening about the place where the disease is,
so that those things whereby these parts are nourished, might be drawn
thither. But if so be that there be any vein broken, then look what is
written of the casting up of the blood, which is caused through a broken vein,
in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and 18..

Of all bloody Flixes in general.. 19.
FOr a conclusion of all these bloody Fluxes, there is to be added unto them,
to wit, if so be that through any excessive scouring, (of whatsoever occasion
it be) the patient fall into a swound (like as it often happens) what is then
to be done in it. First of all, he is to be cherished with water, and more other
means are to be used for it, as in the second part, the sixth Chapter, 2.. has
been said of swowning.

Further, the patient is to be nourished with good meat, and Wine, to wit,
with roasted Pullets, Turtle doves, and other Doves, Cloves, Rose water,
Galingall, and Lignum Aloes, which be very meet for him. When as then the
swouning is past, then are all means to be sought for to stay his scouring,
and to bring the patient to rest and sleep. There is also to be given unto him
one dragme of Treacle, or Philonium, and if so be that he can abide it, then
let him bathe, even as is here before admonished.

Item, we will moreover add hereunto a general rule, how a man is to govern
himself in these bloody fluxes. First, he must beware of all moist meats,
because that thereby the moisture of the body is augmented; but there is much
rather to be used all that is dry, like as hard baked Eggs, and such like,
without much salt, and much fat. Also all things are to be dressed with steeled
Water, Oaten pap, Barley pap, and Pullets broths are not forbidden, neither yet
shiues of bread baked in fat or butter. He shall also eat white bread: red
Wine is better for this sickness then white: but if you can get no red Wine,
then take old white Wine which is not so sour, and temper the same with
steeled water, temper therewith some parched Gum, Bolus, and burnt Iuorie. In
like manner also temper some juice of Barberies in his drink, or in stead
thereof, use wine of Barberies.

Almond milk made with steeled water may he also drink, but not to drink
much is best for all looseness of the belly.

And whereas in this sickness the patient commonly loses his appetite, yet
are there some Physicians who permit the patient to eat what he most longs
for, albeit they do counsel most of all for bread and other meats, which be
most necessary for this sickness. Between meals be conserve of Roses and
Marmalade very commodious to be eaten.

For in this sickness is the patient to be kept quiet, warm, and well
covered, and rather to let his ordure and excrements in a boll under him, then
to rise often, for the less that he is stirred, the sooner will the scouring
be stayed.

All that is too hot and loses much, is forbidden in this infirmity,
whether it be Spice, or any herbs: likewise also very strong Honey, Milk,
Fruit, Cheese, Fish, and all doughie meats.

Of the Constipation or binding in the body.. 20.
WE have hitherto discovered many kinds of things, which do stay the flux or
laske. But it is well known to all men, that the health of man is oftentimes
neglected, through constipation of the body, and when the excrements have not
their natural course: therefore it is the principal determination of all
famous Physicians, to keep open the body for all manner of sicknesses, whereby
the superfluous matter and bad humors may be avoided, even as every where may
be seen throughout this whole book. And albeit this binding of the body
proceed of diverse causes; yet it is not needful to dispute further thereof,
because that in certain sicknesses which be caused through this constipation,
is sufficiently spoken of it. We will here therefore speak of the binding of
the body in healthy persons.

For this is first needful a common and necessary rule, to wit; all that is
taken to loose the body, it be done fasting, that is, when the stomach is
emptied of other meats, and that one fast an hour or twain after it: for if
so be that the meat be mixed with the medicine, then can it not perform his
operation as it behooves; for it will thereby be hindered and enfeebled.
Secondly, to begin always with the weakest and easiest things: and if they
work not strongly enough, then are after that more forcible things to be used.
And because no safer things can be used, than Suppositories and Clisters,
therefore we will first of all begin to speak of them.

Suppositories to provoke Stools.
THere be made many kinds of Suppositories, whereof these are the easiest: Take
Honey as much as you please, seethe it hard, and to prove if it be sodden
enough, let a drop fall upon a cold stone, or upon an Iron, which being cold,
will spring in pieces if you strike upon it; if that it do not cleave, then it
is sodden enough. Afterward temper amongst it salt and meal, and power it on
a stone table, or on a Tin trencher, and roll up the Suppository as thick as
you will have it: then cut it off and make both the ends sharp and even by the
fire or candle, and afterward reserve it in Sallad oil, or in Line oil.
These Suppositories are to be put into the fundament, and to be kept therein as
long as is possible. In like manner does also this ensuing: Take two parts of
meal and one part of salt; make a Suppository thereof with the white of an eg,
and keep it dry.

Other some use in steed of this Suppository, that which follows hereafter:
They beat the white of an eg, and stir a good deal of salt amongst it, and a
little Soote: they put the same in a fine cloth the quantity of a Nutmeg, and
bind it fast, and let a thread hang at it; being anointed with fat or oil,
put the same into the fundament, and when you will go to the stool, then
pluck it out again.

Stronger Suppositories, which are to be used at the Apothecaries, are these:
Take Species Hierae simplicis one dragme, Salt half a scruple, Honey one
ounce; seethe these all together hard, and make Suppositories of them. These
may be used with all safety. But if you will have them yet stronger, then put
half a dragme of Sal gemmae unto it.

Species Hierae.
The foresaid Species Hierae be thus made: Take Cinnamom, Mastick, Asarabacca,
Balsam fruit, Saffron, Balsam wood, and Cassie wood, of each one drag. Aloe two
ounces; make a powder of them. There be also Suppositories to be made (if there
can nothing else be gotten) of salt Larde cut in long slices; of Allom cut also
of the longest fashion, and of Venice soap etc. For young children are also
Suppositories made of fresh Butter, Figs, and Beete roots, and such like. Also
there be made for especial sicknesses many kind of Suppositories, which be
not here specified.

The Clisters be marvelous requisite to open the Constipation of the body, and
of more effect than the Suppositories: because that through their moisture and
slipperynes, they enter further into the bowels, and do there supple, soften,
and provoke the going to stool. Of these Clisters we have every where
described diverse in this our book: yet we will recite here certain more, which
do open the body without any pain. Take Mallows three handfuls, Beetes,
Mercury, of each two handfuls; seethe them together and wring them out: then
take of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, three yolks of eggs, oil of
Sesamum, or of Lineseede four ounces, Sal gemmae half a dragme, temper them
together, and minister it warm.

Item, take Mutton broth, Veale broth, or Hen broth, as much as before, melt
therein fresh Butter, and Ducks grease, of each one ounce, Saffron half a
dragme, oil of Dill and of Lillies, of each one ounce and a half, Indie salt
one dragme, and then temper them together, this is somewhat stronger.

There may also be taken in stead of the foresaid oil S. Tho. Sugar, and oil
of Violets, of each two ounces: but if so be that the pain be great, then may
be tempered with it one dragme of Philonium, and one ounce of the oil of
Mandragora. In fine, all common Clisters be fit for this which be made of fresh
broth, Sallad oil, oil of Violets, boiled Mallows, Beetes, Pellitory of the
wall, Cammomill, Melilot, and such like suppling things.

Some do use also these things following in the stead of suppositories: Take
new Milk and Butter, of each two spoonefuls, make it warm, and use it as a
Clister.

There be also many easy Conserues and Confections which do also loose the
body, like as conserve of Pellitorie, which by long continuance does loose if
one take it alone. First, you have before in the first part, the twelfth
Chapter, in the second. a conserve of Currants, and others which be very
requisite. How commodious also the Cassia is, has in many sundry places been
seen: yet hereafter ensues a very notable and safe confection of Cassie and
Manna for to keep the body open. Take Damask Prunes one ounce, Violets one
dragme and a half, fair well water nine ounces, seethe them together unto the
half, and temper in this decoction Cassie two ounces, sour Dates half an
ounce, Manna one ounce, sirupe of Violets two ounces, Sugar candy, and Sugar
pennets, of each half an ounce: bruise the sour Dates in the decoction, and
then boil them thick with other confections, power then the dissolved Manna
unto it, that through seething it lose not the force. This confection is
requisite for all dainty persons which be bounden in the body, for it has no
unpleasant taste, it does loose very gently, expels Choleram, and asswageth
an Ague.

Also for a gentle laxation one may eat Cassie out of the pipe one ounce,
casting away the stones.

For the same purpose are these Confections following also fit: Take a quart of
good Rhenish wine, steep therein the space of six hours half an ounce of
Seen husks, and one ounce and a half of Seen leaves, let them boil well:
temper afterward in this wine Currants pouned small one pound, fat Figs three
ounces, rub these thorough a Strainer, which being done, put four ounces of
Sugar candy unto it, and then let it boil until it be meetly thick. Lastly,
you are to mix with it half an ounce of Cinnamome, whereof you are to use
half an ounce at a time.

These laxatiue confections following are commonly ordained in Mineral bathes:
Take ryndes of yellow Mirobalanes, and of Indie, of each one ounce, bruise them
well with Currants, Seen husks two ounces, Polipody roots one ounce and a
half; let this seethe together unto the half in the water of Betonie, Sage
and Buglosse, of each six ounces, water of Mints three ounces, temper amongst
them Agaricus one dragme and a half, Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, Ginger
one scruple, Thyme and wild Thyme, of each half a handful. When it has
sodden meetly well, then let it stand a night, and in the morning wring it out,
then mix four ounces of Cassie amongst it, the juice of Currants (which is
Looch de Passulis) two ounces, beaten Cinnamome one ounce, Spec. laetitiae
Galeni one quarter of an ounce, Sugar six ounces, seethe them with Betonie
water unto a sirupe, and make a confection of it.

Sour Dates be also a blessed medicine, for they purge very mildly, and
therefore they be seldom used alone, but what force and virtue they have, is
sufficiently showed in the first part of this book.

The laxatiue confection of Prunes (called Diaprunis lenitiua) is very pleasant
and meet: Diaprunis lenitiua.
it does not only loose the belly, but delayeth Choleram, it quenches thirst,
and is good for all heat, but especially when the Ague is in his prime, and it
is thus prepared: Take fifty Prunes (the stones plucked out) sees them in
sufficient water, then bruise them thorough a Strainer, that the skins may
tarry out: afterward put the broth or liquor into the same pot where they were
sodden on the fire again, and put unto it three quarters of an ounce of dried
Violets, and let it seethe up twice or thrice, then strain out the decoction,
and put it unto the foresaid bruised Prunes. This being done, put six ounces of
Sugar unto it, and let it seethe again until it be thickish, and then take
some of the liquor remaining, and therewith temper Cassie and sour Dates, of
each one quarter of an ounce: lastly, mix all together, and let it boil
softly until it be as thick as a confection.

Item, take powned Rubarbe half an ounce, fresh conserve of Roses two ounces,
temper, and use thereof about one quarter of an ounce at a time.

There is scant any confection which is not only more meet for this matter,
but in many other causes more, then that which is called at the Apothecaries
Electuarium de Sebesten, and is therefore worthy to be rehearsed.

Electuarium de Sebesten.
Take Sebesten and Prunes (having both of them their stones taken out) of each
two ounces and a half, Violet water six ounces, water of blew flowers deluce,
and Pompeon water, of each three ounces, Mercury water two ounces, Sugar
pennets four ounces, Rob de Prunis six ounces, peeled Melon seed, Pompeon
seed, Gourd seed, and peeled Cucumber seed, of each one ounce, Diagridion
one dragme and a half beaten small, boil these fruits in the waters, then
drive them through a strainer, and boil them with the Sugar, and when it is
almost cold, then add the seeds cut very small, and the Diagridion beaten
finely. This confection is very good for all hot Agues: for it eases thirst,
watching and bitterness of the mouth, and does cause much urine to be avoided.

Diaturbith cu^ Rhabarbaro.
There be also many kinds of Spices prepared, whereof Confections and other
things be made, of which we will here describe some: to wit, Diaturbith cum
Rhabarbaro which is thus prepared: Take Turbith and Hermodactyli, of each one
ounce, Rubarbe one quarter of an ounce, Diagridij half an ounce, white and red
Saunders, Violets and Ginger, of each one dragme and a half, Annis, Masticke,
Cinnamom and Saffron, of each one dragme and a half, Sugar fourteen ounces
and a quarter of an ounce: make of all these premises a powder or Confection.

Another: Take Rubarbe half an ounce, Cloves and Galingall, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli and white Sugar of each three dragm.
Diagridii six ounces, Seen leaves one quarter of an ounce, Indy Spica,
Saffron, Ginger, Annis and Masticke, of each one scrup. lastly, make a powder
of it. Both these are fit for to purge all bad humors, be they Cholera,
Phlegma, or Melancholia.

Tabulats of Ginger laxatiue.
The purging Tabulats of Ginger be made thus: Take beaten Ginger one quarter of
an ounce, Cinnamom and Cloves, of each one dragme, Nutmegs and Galingall, of
each one scruple, Saffron fourteen ounces, Turbith half a dragme, Diagridion
one dragme, Sugar two ounces; make Tabulats of it: exhibit not above one
quarter of an ounce at once, for they be meetly strong. The like purging
Confections you may find very many at well furnished Apothecaries; to wit,
Diaphoenicon, de succo Rosarum etc. Take Epithymum, Polipodie roots, and
Thyme, of each one dragme, Seen leaves three quarters of an ounce, Argall three
dragmes, Cinnamom and Annis, of each one dragme, the powder of Dill leaves one
quarter of an ounce, make them into powder: take a dragme of it, tempered with
fresh broth.

The powder Pasaphan.
In Italy they have a powder called Pasaphan, which is there much in use; and is
thus prepared: Take Seen leaves three dragmes, Turbith one quarter of an ounce,
good Rubarbe one dragme, Licorice, Annis, Fennel, of each half a dragme, Indy
Spica five grains: these being all powdered, and then given one dragme at the
most with wine or with any kind of water.

This powder is very common at some Apothecaries, and is thus prepared: Take
Turbith half an ounce, Cinnamom and Ginger, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Galingall, Masticke, Cardamome, Cloves, of each half a dragme, Annis one
dragm. Hermodactyli, Diagridion, Seen leaves, of each half an ounce, Sugar
three ounces; temper these together, and give him a drag. of it at the most.

Medicamen de Turbith.
Medicamen de Turbith is also common, whereof here do follow two sorts: Take
white Ginger, Masticke and Turbith, of each half an ounce, Sugar one ounce and
a half; mix these to a subtle powder.

The other: Take Turbith half an ounce, Ginger one quarter of an ounce,
Masticke ten grains, Sugar three dragmes: this being beaten small and
tempered well together, purges slimie humors: of the which may well be given
to young children, women in child bed, old folks and all dainty persons, one
dragme at the least at one time. Of which may all be given according to the
ability of the person, more or less.

Seen powder called Puluis Senae praeparatae, is not only laxatiue, Puluis
Senae praeparatae.
but also purges marvelous well the head.

Take Seen leaves one ounce and a half, Ginger and Nutmegs of each two
dragmes, Cinnamom and Argall, of each one dragme and a half: make a powder of
it, and give one dragme of it at once.

A powder: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger Cinnamom, Mastick,
Galingal, Cardamome, Cloves, Annis, Hermodactyli, and Diagridij, of each one
dragm, Seen leaves half an ounce, Sugar one ounce; or put unto them as much
Sugar as you think good, for without Sugar it is not to be taken above one
dragme. Item take Seen leaves half an ounce, Ginger, and Cinnamom, of each one
dragme, Sugar one quarter of an ounce: take the half thereof, and strewe it
upon a slice or shiue of tosted bread, that has been steeped in wine, and so
eat it. But if it do not loose, then eat another slice of bread and the rest
in a morning. It is surely good.

Amongst the things that one does eat, some mix Mercury leaves in a Sallad,
for they do easily loose them that be apt to go to stool.

Item, Dates, Mirobalanes, stued Prunes strewed well with Sugar, do loose the
body very mildly. Likewise also Damask Prunes stewed with Raisins, do loose
also if one sup up the broth withal, five or six Figs eaten before meat, do
open the body. Item, Currants washed in sweet Wine, and steeped therein, and
afterward dried and strewed with Sugar, are also very good for this purpose.
Or take Raisins (as is said) which be steeped, half a pound, beat them, and
wring them thorough a hairen strainer, Sugar two ounces, Sugar of Roses, and
Honey of Roses, of each one ounce and a half, sees them well by a mild fire
unto a confection, then take of it as often as you will the quantity of a nut.

Also you may steep these Currants in oil of sweet Almonds strewed with Sugar
and then eaten, for much Sugar has a laxatiue nature, and especially in young
children.

Now will we write of certain laxatiue potions, of which be diverse ready at
all well furnished Apothecaries to be had, and albeit you may use the same
alone, yet notwithstanding have all Physicians ordained, that the same shall be
commonly tempered and taken with purging medicines, whereof here shall follow
some, which the Apothecaries at Augusta have at all times in a readiness.

First they have a drink which they call Decoctionem communem, Decoctio
communis.
which is a common decocted potion, made after this manner: Take ten or twelve
Prunes, Licorice, Currants, Annis seed, and Fennel, of each half an ounce,
flowers of Burrage and Buglosse, of each one dragm and a half, power a quart
of water unto it, sees it so long until a third part be wasted, then strain
it thorough. This drink ensuing is of a temperate nature, for it is somewhat
more cooling, and the same is to be used in Summer.

Take Currants, Licorice, Prunes, Iuiubes, Violets, Barley, peeled Melon seed,
Pompeon seed, Gourd seed, and Cucumber seed, of each one quarter of an
ounce, boil them together in water like as is said before.

Take Fumitorie, Betonie, Mints, Mugwort, of each half a handful, flowers of
Burrage and Buglosse, of each half a dragme, Annis, Fennel, Asarabacca, of
each half an ounce, wild Saffron seed three quarters of an ounce, Calmus one
ounce, Polipody roots, Agaricus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Seen leaves
one ounce, the seeds and roots must be beaten gross, (letting them sees
first a little) afterward put unto it the herbs, flowers, and Agaricke, and so
let them sees again: when it is then cold, wring it out hard, and keep it
well very close stopped in a cool place. In like manner there is prepared a
stronger which is called Decoctio aperitiua mayor, Decoctio aperitiua mayor.
and is made thus: Take Endive, Cicorie, Fumitorie, of each one handful,
Agrimonie, Windweed, and Hearts tongue, of each half a handful, flowers of
Burrage and Buglosse, of each one quarter of an ounce, Thime and wild Thime, of
each two dragmes and a half, roots of Fennel, Smallage, Parsley of each half
an ounce, Annis and Fennel seed, Melon seed, of each one quarter of an ounce,
sliced Licorice half an ounce, roots of Cipers, rinds of Tamariske, of each
three dragmes, Seen leaves two ounces, Polipodie roots one ounce, Agaricus
half an ounce, seethe them all together in water like as is said before, then
wring it well out. You are to steep in this decoction Rubarb three dragm. and
a half. Indy Spica one scruple, Sal Gemmae half a scruple, Cinnamome two
scruples, let them stand together to steep all a whole night, afterward sees
it once in boiling water, strain it very well out, and put six ounces of
Sugar unto it.

Decoct^o Senae.
A decoction of Seen leaves called Decoctio Senae: Take Seen leaves two ounces,
and Seen husks one ounce, roots of Cicorie, Agrimonie, Hyssope, of each half a
handful, Polipody roots one ounce, sees them together in a quart of water
until the third part be decocted away, then wring it out, and keep it in a
cool place.

I susio Senae.
Another, Insusio Senae: This decoction is much used for the Pockes at Augusta
in Germany, for which it is most meet: Take the husks and leaves of Seen, of
each five dragmes, Ginger two scruples, Burrage flowers, Violets, Roses, of
each one scruple, Polipodie one quarter of an ounce, Currants half an ounce,
ten or twelve Sebesten, sliced Agaricus half an ounce, power upon them
sixteen ounces of boiling water, and let it be steeped the space of ten hours
by the warm ashes, afterward wring it out and keep it well, whereof is
commonly three or four ounces taken, and sirupe of Fumitorie, or De Bizantijs
one ounce and a half, or two ounces tempered together, three or four days
one after another.

There be also used many other laxatiue potions, like as this Wine following:
Take Seen leaves two ounces, Tymus and Epithymus, of each one ounce and a half,
flowers of Burrage and Buglosse, of each three handfuls, Hearts tongue, and roots
of Cicorie, of each two handfuls, Rosemary Stechas, of each one handful, Roses
and Balm, of each three handfuls: these are to be put dry and flixed into a
little Runlet, and power fifty quarts of Must upon it, and then let it stand
and clarify, when as need does require, then may you take a good draught of
it before meat.

Item, drink Pullet broth wherein Prunes are decocted, and to eat the Prunes
is very commodious. But this broth relaxeth better when it is boiled with
Currants and much Sugar. In like manner new Whay well salted and drunken warm
does loose, but better if it be sodden with Prunes.

In like manner also are you to take Wormwood, Honey, and Sugar according to
the ability of the person, sees this together in water, and drink a good
draught thereof. Item, take Sanicle with the roots, sees it well, and drink
of it the quantity of four ounces, tempered with Honey of Roses.

If so be that pills can not be used, then take four ounces of water wherein
Mallows were before decocted, and dissolve Sugar therein or Honey of Violets,
and so drink it. Or take Linseede, Hops, and Burrage, al together, or each
apart, decoct them to a potion, this loses also. The same does also one ounce
of Polipodie, and half an ounce of Fennel seeds decocted together. Item,
take conserve of Eldern one ounce, or one ounce and a half, dissolve it in
fresh broth one pound, and drink fasting a good draught thereof. Fumitorie and
Goats milk boiled together does not only loose the belly, but also cleanses
the blood.

The decoction of Charuill and of Larkes spurs do also open the body. Item,
the decoction of Coleworts, of Beetes, and of Lentils, in every of these are
you to temper the quantity of an hasell nut of fine Turpentine, and to drink
it warm, which is also good for the excoriation of the guts.

The decoction of Creuises, and of all other fishes, are also very good for
relaxation, but sweet oil of Almonds is most commodious for this purpose, more
sure and most pleasant being taken with Sugar. It asswageth all griping of the
belly, and of the breast: which oil is thus to be made.

Oil of Almonds.
Take Almonds as many as you please, make them clean, beat them small, roast
them a little on hot ashes, or on a small fire, stirring them always about;
put them afterward very hot into a strong bag, which is made wet in
Rosewater, and press it out forcibly, then have you a fine and clear oil,
whereof may be used for aged folks four or six ounces tempered with course
Sugar, for children, and also for the first borne, each according to his age.

Thick or puddle Wine, does not only bind the body but does oppilate also
the Liver, the Milt, and the Kidneys, this do they which drink much of it,
therefore it is to be refrained.

Of all laxatiue medicines and potions, Manna is not the basest, but is highly
commended above all other things, for it is one of the blessedst medicines, like
as is mentioned more at large in the Introduction. This Manna is ministered
diversely, according to the ability of the person, like as water of Burrage,
fresh broth, and such like. You may also give of this Manna to young children,
The use of Cassie.
to each one according to his age, be it in their Drink, Milk, or Pap.

In like manner is Cassie also a very notable and laxatiue medicine, even as is
showed herebefore at large in the introduction: for it is much more commodious
to be taken after the form of a conserve, than in any kind of potion, by
reason that there must be put unto it so much moisture, thus will we here
prescribe for an example how the same is to be used: Take the roots of
Polipody chopped small one ounce, sees them in the water of Burrage eight
ounces, and dissolve therewith one ounce and a half or two ounces of Cassie,
letting all that is black be washed clean off, and then drink this warm, it
loses very gently.

Here before in the first part, in the first Chapter and 3.. you have a good
mead of Seen leaves for children and other persons very necessary to be used,
yet, this following may be prepared: Take Seen leaves half an ounce, Ginger and
Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, beaten Licorice three dragmes, seethe
them all together in sixteen ounces of water even to the half, drink the one
half in the morning and the other half in the evening.

Also there be certain Sirupes used for the loosing of the body, whereof the
chiefest is, the laxatiue sirupe of Roses, which is before described in the
first part.

Also there is made a sirupe of Seen leaves, as hereafter follows. Take right
Endive, Sirup of Seen leaves.
Cicorie, Agrimony, of each half a handful, Venus hair, Hearts tongue, of each
half so much, seeds of Melons, Pompeons, Cucumbers, and Gourds, of each one
dragme, wild Saffron seed, Polipody roots, seeds of Endive, Cicorie, and
Licorice, of each two scruples, Barley one ounce, winter Cherries, Windweed, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Fearne roots, Smallage, Fennel, and Sperage, of
each half an ounce, Currants three dragmes, six or seven Prunes, flowers of
Burrage, Buglosse, and Violets, of each half a dragme, sees them all together
in a quarte of water almost unto the half, wring it well out, and then lay to
steep in this decoction one ounce of Seen leaves, prepared Agaricus half an
ounce, Rubarb three quarters of an ounce. When it has stood so one night, and
is wroong out, then temper with it, Syrupum Capillorum Veneris, which is the
sirupe of Venus hair, the sirupe of Violets, of each one ounce, white Sugar
three ounces, let this seethe by a soft fire unto a sirupe: lastly, put more
unto it half a dragme of beaten Cinnamome, and one scruple of yellow Saunders,
and so keep this sirupe until that you will use it.

Of this sirupe you may boldly give one ounce, or an ounce and a half, or
more, unto all delicate persons, yea to women also with child, and that with
fresh broth, or any distilled water, for it is very safe.

Another Syrup. Take Endive, Liuerwort, Venus hair, all green, of each one
handful, red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, Melon seed,
Gourd seed, Cucumber seed, Pompeon seed, and Burrage, of each half an
ounce, Seen, Epithymum, of each one ounce, Rubarb three quarters of an ounce,
Turbith half an ounce, Indie Spica half a dragme, Ginger one dragme, Sugar
twelve ounces, dissolved in Endive water, make a sirupe of it like as is taught
in the first part, the first Chapter, and 6..

Honey of Roses loses also very well, especially that which is made of the
juice of Roses, even as it is described in the first part, the fourteenth
Chapter, and 4..

For this are also sundry pills prepared, and that after this manner following:
Take Bdellium and Aloe, which have been steeped the space of three days in
Sheep milk, of each one quarter of an ounce, temper them, and form pills of
them, use thereof one scruple, or half a dragme at once, they will do you much
pleasure. Item, take before supper one dragme of washed Aloe.

This salve following is also laxatiue, if that the belly and the navel be
anointed with it: Take the salve Agrippa, and the confection of Hiera, of each
half an ounce, the juice of Swines bred and Scammonie, of each three graynes,
Euphorbium, Turbith, Coloquinte, of each one scruple, beat them all together.
Item, take Pitch and Frankincense, of each a like quantity, cast them on hot
coals under a close stool, and sit over it with the bare buttocks, it loses.

For a conclusion, there is to be found through this whole book, how that the
body is to be loosed and opened for all manner of sicknesses; but this is
only spoken of all them who be in health, and cannot go to stool.

Of the strayning or insatiable desire of going to stool, which is called
Tenasmus.. 21.
FOr as much as through both the foresaid maladies, as well of the excessive
going to the stool, as through binding in the body, this strayning which the
Grecians do call Tenasmus and Tenesmus, may be provoked: therefore we can not
omit, but add the same unto the rest, and is thus described.

Tenasmus is a disease or malady in the end of the Arsegut hard by the
fundament, with great pain, and continual desire to go to the stool, where
notwithstanding the patient can be discharged and rid of very little or nothing
at all. We do call these kinds of scourings properly a straining to go to the
stool; for it comes for the most part always with such a force, that it
drives out the Arsegut, and the fruit of women conceived. The cause of this
scouring may be as well inward as outward cold, like as when any one does sit
upon cold stones, or it is gotten of the cold air, or in the water:
contrariwise also it may be caused through heat and drought. Item, of any
sharp rheum of the stomach or Liver, of corrupted meats, or much moisture,
through the use of much fruit, through worms, impostumation of the bowels,
binding in the body, swelling of the Pyles, and also of any tough and subtle
Phlegma. The signs whereof are easily to be discerned by the report of the
patient, and view of the place, and ordure. Now as touching the remedies,
Clisters are best of all for it. If this malady do come of cold, then make the
Clister thus: Take Mints, Marierom, Cammomill, Melilot, field Mints,
Southernwood, of each one handful, decoct them in sufficient water. Take of
this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, oil of Cammomill, and of Lillies, of
each one ounce and a half; then make this Clister very warm: but if there come
any binding or stopping with it, then temper therewith Benedictam laxatiuam, or
Hieram picram, three quarters of an ounce or one ounce. The herbs and all that
be decocted for this Clister, stamp them all to pap, and temper them with oil
of Rue and of Lillies, and let it boil a little while, and lay it upon the
place where the pain is, and when it is cold, then lay on another that is
warm, doing this 3. or 4. times one after another. When as then this strayning
of going to the stool is red, then are you to use this following: Take steeled
Cow milk or Goats milk, Mutton broth, or Veale broth twelve or sixteen ounces,
melt therein one ounce, or one ounce and a half of Sheep suet, and two ounces
of the oil of Roses, then temper them together, and use this Clister
oftentimes. Item take twelve ounces of Malmesy, the yolke of an Egg, let them
boil together in a drinking pot or kan in a Kettle of water until it be very
hot, then give it afterward unto the patient it is a very safe remedy. When
all necessary medicines have been used to this kind of laske, and yet the
pain does not diminish in ten days, then may one use the Clister which is
described in the 17.. beginning thus: Take peeled Lupins etc. and that at two
or three times as the case shall import. If these scourings be of a cold cause,
then roast Millet or Panick with salt, and lay upon it, or fill three bags with
Bran, let them boil in wine or water, lay one of them upon the belly, another
upon the back beneath, and the third upon the fundament, as warm as may be
possibly suffered, and when they be cold make them warm again. Afterward
annoint the place with warm oil or with the salve Marciaton, and sprinkle
wine upon a hot stone, then lay a cloth upon it against the burning, and sit
upon it with the buttocks as hot as may be suffered. Others do counsel for to
foment the fundament with red Wine, wherein the herb Verbascum has been
sodden, and afterward to sit upon a hot Oak or Cipers wooden board. Some do
commend for this a Poplar board: or if one cannot get such a one, then a Fur
board, and as soon as one is cold, then to take another warmed again, and
using this so long until he feel the warmth within the belly. Then is the
fundament to be anointed with molten Hearts suet, or to fume it with Pitch,
like as not long ago has been rehearsed. Item, Holyhock roots, Linseede,
Fenegreeke, Cammomill, Melilot, the upper sprigs of Coleworts, of each three
ounces, powne the^ all together, and sees them in reasonable water. You are
therewith to wet a sponge, wring it out, and sit thereon, and lay it upon the
fundament; yea, to sit also in the water. Item, take the seeds of Plantain,
prepared Coriander, Myrtle seed, Acorne cups, yellow seeds of Roses, Cipers
nuts, of each one dragme and a half, Gum, and Dragagant, (both parched) of
each one ounce, beat them together, and put them in a bag, and seethe them
with Wine, then must one sit hot thereon. Item, sees oaken leaves with water
in a bag, and hold the fundament unto the heat of it, and when it is cold,
make it hot again, and do this oftentimes one after another.

For a salve: Take oil of Roses one quarter of an ounce, Saffron xv. grains,
Sheep sewet, Dear sewet, of each one ounce, make a salve thereof, it does
maruellously take away the pain.

Another. Take Frankincense, Lycium, Saffron, Gum, Opium, of each one dragme,
unripe oil of Olives, Colophonia, of each three dragmes, Wax as much as is
needful for to make a salve with it, the lard of a Bore, and of all
fourefooted beasts: also the fat of all Fowls is especial good to be used for
this disease.

You shall take for a plaster Hollihock roots, Linseede, Fenegreeke, of each
one ounce sees them well, and powne them together, and temper amongst it half
an ounce of powned Cammomill, the yolks of two Eggs, and lay it against the
fundament. For this, may you also take Garlic boiled to grout, the heads of
Leekes fried in Butter, with oil of Roses, and a little Wax made into salve
may also be used for this purpose.

For this is also requisite the fume and vapor of diverse things, as the leaves
of a Pearetree, of Medlars, Quinces, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, blossoms of
Pomegranates, and sealed earth, whereof you may sees (which you please) with
Wine. When as then the patient has been at stool, then is he to receive
beneath the vapor of this wine powered on a hot stone. Item, take a hot brick,
sprinkle it with Wine and Mastick, use it as before. Or make a fume with
Colophonia or Pitch.

This confection also following may be used: Take Myrtle seeds, Pomegranate
blossoms, Roses, and Pomegranat pills, of each half a handful, Butchers
broom seeds, Sorrel seeds, the seed of Plantaine, yellow Rose seeds,
Barberies, white Saunders, Mastick, burnt Iuorie, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Annis, seeds of Endive, Cypers roots, and Frankincense, of each one
dragme and a half, prepared Coriander, Cinnamome, red Corrall, of each half a
dragme, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, Storax, Cypers nuts, parched Gum, of
each one drag. white Poppie seed three dragmes, powne all that is to be
powned, and with dissolved Sugar make thereof a confection: you are also to put
unto it some juice of Pomegranates. Item, take the bones of the head of a fresh
taken Pickrell, the weight of a dragme and a half, stamp them small, and
drink them with Wine, or any fresh broth. This is taken for to be a most sure
experiment.

Suppositories which are to be used are these: Take Frankincense, Myrrh, Gum,
Linseede, of each one quarter of an ounce, Opium, Saffron, of each half a
dragme, temper all these with the white of an Egg, and make thereof short
suppositories, then bind thereon a strong thread, so that you may pluck them out
when you will. Some do put Smallage unto it. These are now the principal
remedies for this scouring: but if so be that there be other causes with it, as
worms, obstructions, and swellings, whereof we have here before made mention;
you may read of either in his proper description.

And for a conclusion, all bitter, sharp, and sour things are to be
refrained, for that all such make the going to the stool, gnawing,
excoriating, and painful. Pullet broth, Barley pap, oaten pap, and such like
light meats, are very commodious for him, and above all things must he beware
of cold.

Of the pain in the stomach in general.. 22.
THese kinds of lasks and bloody flixes have awhile seduced me from the
infirmities of the stomach, and because these lasks (as has been showed) for
the most part proceed from the weakness of the stomach, with an infection of
the Liver and other parts more, it would in no wise have bin decent to have
treated of them elsewhere. But now we purpose to proceed with our intent, and
write of the pain in the stomach, and of all that appertains unto it.

This pain of the stomach may be caused of diverse and sundry means, to wit,
of some outward blows, falls, wounds, of a pirrcing cold, or extreme heat, of
a bad digestion, that has long continued, of overmuch meat or drink, eating
either too hot or too cold things, or of winds contained in the stomach: and
in fine, of all the four humors of the body, also with or without an
impostume. And indeed in this pain of the stomach, and also in all pains of
the Liver, it were very needful to use the counsel of an expert Physician,
that might discern and know whence these infirmities proceed, and whereon
each symptom depends. For if in this point any error be committed, then is
this malady imparted unto all the parts of concoction. Wherefore great heed
must be taken what ought to be used in every accident, for as their causes be
diverse, so also do they differ in their signs.

If this infirmity be procured by some outward occasion, that is to be known
of the patient himself: or if the cause be a bad digestion of the stomach,
that is perceived by the sower belchings. If it come by ouerlading of the
stomach and bad digestion, then does the patient find a heaviness in the
stomach, with wamblings and vomitings, and good ease after them. If it be
caused of heat, then feels he a gnawing, heat, drought, and sweetness in
the mouth, because it proceeds of blood. If it be procured of choler, then
has the patient a bitterness and a taste of Verdegreace in his mouth. The
pain that comes of phlegm, has always a salt taste with it. Also the
spettle may show what the cause is, whence this infirmity might proceed.

Melancholy is known hereby, that there is neither heat, nor pain with it,
but only a sower and a bad savor in the mouth, which also otherwhiles is
perceived by that which is brought up by vomit: unto this is commonly adjoined
a hardness in the spleen, and a pain in the left side. But if this pain of
the stomach proceed of winds, then may you perceive a wambling and belching,
or breaking of wind upward.

These are the commonest signs of all pains in the stomach, and first we
will write of the pain in the stomach that is without an impostume.

Of the pain of the stomach without impostumation through heat.. 23.
FOr all pains of the stomach where there is great perturbance, great
wambling, parbraking and vomiting, it may be justly adjudged, that it does
proceed of an hot occasion, for which vomiting (by taking of lukewarm water)
is to be provoked; or if the same be too weak, then to put some Sallad oil
unto it, or oil of Dill, or oil of Violets: the same does also the seed of
Orage, tempered with Vinegar. But there be in other places other remedies more
described for to purge the patient by vomiting: and if this ease him not, then
it is needful that the patient be purged: but first he is to take some
preparatiue potions, even as hereafter follow.

Take husked Barley two ounces, Endive and small Endive, of each one handful,
Roses, seed of Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and Pompeons, and the juice of
Pomegranats, of each one ounce, Sugar nine ounces, make a clear sirupe of it,
until there remain about twelve ounces, give always two ounces of it at once
with Barley water or Endive water.

For this is also Oxysacchara good, made with the juice of Limons or the juice
of Roses, wherein is decocted a little of the juice of Wormwood taken with
Barley water. When as these potions be taken, then is to be given for a
purgation one ounce of Hiera Picra with Endive water: or if the patient fear
the bitterness, then may he take this following.

Take Violets and Burrage flowers, of each half an ounce, nine or ten Prunes,
sower Dates one ounce, Currants one quarter of an ounce, sees them in twelve
ounces of water, so that there remain after the straining out four ounces of
the decoction, then lay to steep in this warm Colature one ounce of the
rindes of yellow Mirobalans, let it stand the space of one night upon warm
ashes, being strained through in the morning, temper half an ounce of Cassie
with it.

There is also to be given daily to the patient, bread which has been steeped
in the juice of Pomegranats, and Syrupum Acetosum, de Cydonijs with it, and (as
is said before) Mutton broth and such like. Moreover, the Iulep of Roses, of
Violets, wine of Pomegranats, Veriuice, with water wherein Lettice, Purslaine,
and Endive were boiled, be very good for this malady. After purging, the
patient may drink otherwhiles Buttermilk and well water, if so be no
impostumation in the stomach do let the same. He may also eat well Lettice
and Purslaine with small vinegar, Melons, and Cucumbers: all his other meats
must be light of digesture, as Hens, Pullets, Partridges, and small fishes
dressed with vinegar, Citrons, Oranges and Limons be very meet for him.

White clear wine is tolerable for this if it be well watered, but if so be
that there come a drouth with this heat, then must moist things be ministered,
as namely, Mallows, Spinach, and such like. And further also to use water
baths: in fine, all that wants for this is to be taken and had in the 6..
where we have discoursed of a weak stomach through heat.

Of the pain of the stomach without impostumation through cold.. 24.
IF so be that this pain of the stomach be bewrayed through belching, then is
it easily to be marked, that the same pain is caused through some wind, which
is engendered through cold. Therefore are we here to show whence the same is
caused: But as much as concerns the Belching, it shall hereafter be spoken of.

Of the pain in the stomach through wind.. 25.
THis is the malady of the stomach, the which we call Belching, and the
Latinists do call it Ructum, the which is none other but the wind which nature
expels through the mouth, and it is thus described.

Belching is an ascending wind which comes out of the stomach, and is not
digested, but is driven out through the expulsive virtue of the stomach.

This is caused of a flegmaticke matter, or meat which is resolved in the
stomach into wind, through the feebleness of natural heat, and is expelled
out of the stomach. Like as for example we apparently see, that in time of
great heat or great cold, the weather is least of all clowdie or foggie.

The causes of these belchings may well be a feeble heat of the stomach,
which cannot digest sufficiently. And albeit there be warmth enough, yet has
he nothing but windy meats to work upon; and the belching which proceeds
of great heat, happens but two or three times one after another. The windy
meats are these, vz. porredge of Beans, Pease, Rye bread, Swines flesh,
Chestnuts, Figs, dried Cherries, Must, and all cold meats, which do abate the
natural heat: also roasted Eggs, Onions, Radishes, and all that be of such
natures.

This belching may also be caused of superfluous meats or drinks, for if they
cannot be consumed, then do they engender wind.

Also this may well be caused by a cold rheum, which falls also into the
stomach, through want of sleep, through some unnatural heat or cold,
through over hot or cold baths, through mighty motions, and through thrusts
upon the stomach, and also by brusing or wounding of other parts, which hinder
digestion.

The signs of this belching are these: first when one has neither smelling
nor taste, before he have taken his meat. Secondly, the stench declares an
vlceration or stinking matter in the stomach. Thirdly, if the rising of the
meat taken, be sour, and the smatch comes up again with it: then is it a
sign of a bad digestion. Fourthly, if the belching do come after Asthma, or
after an heavy breath, then is it good and profitable. Fifthly, in like sort it
is very fit, if that any wind comprehended in the stomach be belched up. But
if the wind will not avoid the stomach, then is there some other infirmity to
be looked for. Sixthly, the reasonable belching (if so be that the digestion be
not thereby annoyed) is very commodious, and the digestion much helped with it.
Seventhly, all they who have many sour belchings, do not lightly get any
pricking or shooting in the breast. Eighthly all they which be awaked out of
their sound sleep, do not well digest, and be much subject to belching, and
that more or less according to the meat received. Ninthly, the belching which
tastes like Verdigrease betokens a great heat and a stinking matter in the
stomach.

And now to proceed to the remedies for the belching, there be first certain
sure rules to be kept and observed.

First, if there engender any wind in the body which nature would willingly
expel, then is it not to be detained at any hand; notwithstanding, for
reverence sake, to forbear it in the presence of other folks. Secondly, one
ought to beware of all surfeiting and superfluity of meat.

Thirdly, all cold is to be refrained, and especially coldness of the feet.
Fourthly al they that be plagued with sour belchings, are to use Diatrion
pipereon, and such like, and to drink it with wine; but they who have only
certain vapors ascending from the stomach, they are to be helped with
Wormwood or Hiera Picra. Fifthly, all they that do belch of an ill stomach or
bad digestion, they must live very soberly. Sixthly, sobriety and warmth of the
stomach is passing good for all belching from the stomach.

Now if that this belching do proceed of a cold stomach, then is the patient
to be kept marvelous sober, and to eat nothing but light meat, and therewith
to use one of these things following, as Diacyminum, Dianisum, Diagalanga,
Diapipereon, Aromaticum rosatum. Or let these confections be made: Take Species
Diacinamomum, Diambra, Diagalanga, of each one dragme, Sugar six ounces, sees
them with the water of Mints or Hyssope, and make Tabulats of it. This being
made, then use one quarter of an ounce of it, or half an ounce at once. It
expels all winds of the stomach, it consumes all cold matter of the
bowels, and is very commodious for the stomach and the liver, taken before
beat. Item, take powned Galingale one dragme, drink it every morning with
wine. Item, Cinnamom chewed long in the morning, does also avoid all wind. In
like manner the confection of Bay berries does vehemently expel all winds out
of the stomach, and out of all other parts. Or make this following: Take
Annis, Spikenard, Mace, Louage, and seeds of Rue, of each half a dragme,
Commin one quarter of an ounce Seen leaves one ounce, Argall one dragme and a
half, honey of Roses four ounces and a half, Sugar half an ounce, the Sugar
and Honey shall be boiled until they be thick in the water of Hyssope, and
temper the rest amongst them: take sometimes also half a dragme or one dragme
of fine Treacle, or Mithridate in good wine.

Potions, and such like.
TAke an old Cock or Hen, stop it full of Cinnamom, Cloves, Ginger, and
Zeduarie, as much as you think good, let them sees well, and drink of this
broth every morning eight ounces at one time. Or drink in the morning a good
draught of wine, wherein be steeped Nutmegs, Galingale and Cloves. A little
Aqua vitae is also very good. You may likewise use for this vital waters,
Conserues of Betonie, of Eyebright, Gilloflower wine. Betony wine, and wine of
Eyebright, are very meet for all cold diseases of the stomach.

Of sirupes are especial good for this disease, the sirupe of Wormwood, of
Mints, of Quinces, and above all de Calamintha. Or make this following: Take
Marioram, rumpled Mints, Wormwood, and Penniroyall, of each one handful, Honey
water four and twenty ounces, one quart of good white wine, sees the herbs
even to the half, then strain it and clarify the broth, put as much Honey unto
it as you think good; temper afterward amongst it Ginger, Galingale, Lignum
Aloes, Citron peeles and Spikenard, of each one quarter of an ounce, then make
a sirupe of it, like as in the first part and the 6.. is taught. Also you may
temper with it Commin, Fennel, Caraway, Annis, Cloves, Mother cloves, or
Cinnamom. For all these things do expel wind, and strengthen the stomach.

These pills following do not purge, but expel wind: Take Asarabacca, Commin,
Fennel, and Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, the seeds of Rue, roots
of Mandragora, of each one scruple, Beuercod one dragme and a half, make as
many pills of it as you please, and use one dragme or one dragme and a half of
it at one time. For when one will purge, then take these pills following: Take
Indie salt half a scruple, washed Aloes two scruples, Pil. Alephanginae one
quarter of an ounce, temper them together, and make seven or eight pills of
them, and use them at one time.

Suppositories which do draw down the winds.
TAke Ammoniacum one quarter of an ounce, Opopanacum one dragme, Wax two
ounces, Turpentine three ounces, Indie Salt one dragme and a half, Saltpeter
two ounces and a half, Rue, Caraway, Silver mountain seed, Cuscuta, Centorie,
Coloquint, Commin, Swines bread, of each one dragme and a half, Colophonia,
one quarter of an ounce, melt the Gum, the Wax and Turpentine, and temper the
rest (being beaten) amongst it. Then make suppositories of it the bigness of a
small finger.

Others do take Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Opopanacum, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Sagapenum, one dragme and a half, dissolve them in vinegar, temper them
afterward in four ounces of molten Honey, and put Swines bread unto it,
Coloquint, Turbith, and the roots of Fern, of each one dragme, Scammonie one
quarter of an ounce, parched Salt one ounce and a half, then make thick
suppositories of it: for this are you to abate or increase the described weight
more or less, according to the importance of the cause; for they be very
strong, and draw down the wind and the ordure very vehemently.

This powder following is also very good for all winds: Take Marioram, Rue,
Mints, Ameos, Masticke and Frankincense, of each three dragmes, Cloves half a
dragm, make a powder of them, and give thereof one dragme at the same time.

Another: Take Cinnamome one ounce, Ginger three quarters of an ounce, Cloves
half an ounce, Galingale one quarter of an ounce, Nutmegs three dragmes,
Cardamome one drag. and a half, Mace one dragm, Pepper one quarter of an
ounce, Spica one dragme, Comin three quarters of an ounce, Saffron one dragme
and a half, Sugar one ounce and a half: take one dragme thereof with good
warm wine.

Here follows that which is outwardly to be used.
TAke Millet and Salt, parch them well, then put unto them Parietarie and
Nettles, and lay them warm upon the stomach. Or sees Rue, Marioram,
Cammomill and Mints in wine, and wet a sponge in it, or a woollen clout, wring
it out, and lay it warm upon the stomach. You may also sees the same herbs
in Sallad oil, and anoint the stomach with it, and then lay it warm thereon
with undressed sheep wool.

Another ointment: Take Rue one handful, Beuercod one quarter of an ounce,
Annis one ounce, Aristologie two ounces, red Wine three ounces, oil of Bery
four ounces, powne them all grossly that are to be powned, and let them sees
upon hot ashes until the wine be boiled away: then wring it thorough a cloth,
and with Wax make a salve of it for the stomach.

These oils following are very necessary for him: to wit, oil of Rue, of
Mandragora, of Penniroyall, of Dill, of Spica, and Bayberries, mixed together or
each alone. This plaster following is very good for to consume the wind of the
stomach, of the liver, and of the milt: Take Ammoniacum, Opopanacum,
Turpentine, Rosin, of each half an ounce, Cardainome, Cypers roots, Sauin
tree, Saltpeter, Bayberies, Cassie wood, Melilot, Fenegreeke meal, Smallage
seeds, Marioram gentle, of each one dragme, melt and pown them as behooves,
and then temper them with the oil of Spike and of Wax, as much as is needful
for to make a plaster; spread it on a leather, and cover it with Syndall, and
so lay it over the stomach. You shall have also hereafter a good plaster
against the obstruction of the liver with cold, beginning: Take Roses five
dragmes, etc. which plaster is also meet for this purpose.

This fomentation is also marvelous meet for this: Take Wormwood, Mints,
Marioram, rumpled Mints, Fennel seed, Dill seed and Commin, of each one
handful and a half, Masticke, red and white Coral, Gallia Muscata, of each
one dragm, Roses two handfuls, Squinant, Myrtle seed and Coriander, of each
one handful and a half, wild Vine leaves one handful and a half (but not
Bryonie) cut them all gross, and then sees them all in three quarts of wine
unto the half (except the Gallia Muscata) this is to be put last of all unto
it, when as the decoction is strained. Then foment the stomach with it with a
great sponge. These bags are also to be made; Take the seeds of Smallage,
Annis, Silver mountain, Fennel seeds, Stone Parsley and of Rue, of each one
handful, Marioram, white water Mints, of each one handful and a half,
Hyssope, Penniroyall, Stechas, Rue, field Cypers, of each one handful,
Wormwood two handfuls, Calmus, Cinnamome, and Cloves, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Mace three dragmes, cut it and beat it all together, and afterward put
it in a bag. Item, rub the stomach with Aqua vitae. This is also very good and
commodious: Item, set a great boxing cup upon the stomach vnpickt, etc. But
you shall incontinent hereafter see more of this, where we do speak of the
griping and pain of the belly, because that they do both proceed out of one
kind of cause.

Of the swelling or puffing up of the stomach.. 26.
IF the swelling or puffing up of the stomach be caused of wind, that is
easily perceived through the forementioned reasons. But because that it may
also happen very well through impostumation and other occasions, and that the
same is to be outwardly seen and known, therefore are we here to add unto
this somewhat thereof. When as then any wind does stick in the stomach, that
will pass neither upwards nor downwards, then will it of necessity puff up
the stomach, and extend it with great perplexity, and if the same proceed
through any impostumation, one may well perceive the same outwardly: what then
the causes and signs of these winds be, that is sufficiently discoursed in the
forementioned third part, and 25.. But as concerning the impostumation, we will
shortly hereafter speak of it: and if so be there be any malady of the Milt
with it, then look into the description of the infirmities of the same, and
mix the same things with it which do serve for it.

Of the pain of the stomach through Phlegma.. 27.
IF so be that the pain of the stomach do come through Phlegma, and with a
salt humor, then is the patients mouth salt, and has also heat and thirst
with it. And in case the same be caused of any other kind of Phlegma, then is
there no thirst with it, but only anguish and drouth, and one may know by the
tongue the taste of the matter which causes this pain. Or is the Phlegma much
abounding? then will the appetite be lost, with other causes more, whereof we
have spoken already. For this, is first counseled to take Oxymel of Squils,
with the decoction of Hyssop, and that afterward he is to be urged to vomit,
with Mustard, Honey, salt fish, Radish, and Garlic, or use this decoction: Take
Squils two ounces, seeds of Orage three ounces, Radishes four ounces, Vinegar
two ounces, and a quart of water, let these sees together unto the half at
least. When you have eaten before two or three slices of a Radish, then drink
two ounces of this decoction, tempered with one ounce of Sallad oil, and a
short time after see if you can cast up somewhat. But if the stomach be not
therewith sufficiently cleansed, one may perceive by it, to wit, by reason that
thereby follows not any ease at all. Then be these sirupes following to be
prepared: Take Mints, Wormwood, Hyssop, Venus hair, all green (if so be that
they be to be gotten) of each a handful, Parsley roots, Fennel roots, of
each one ounce and a half, Annis, Fennel, Ameos, Licorice, Corans, Vinegar,
of each one ounce, Honey and Sugar, of each six ounces, make a clear sirupe of
it. For this is Oxymel of Squils also good.

As it is needful in all other sicknesses, that the Phlegma be purged: so it
is also needful in this, as thus: Take Burrage, and the flowers of Buglosse,
of each half an ounce, Annis one ounce, Licorice, Corans, of each two ounces,
roots of Polipodie half an ounce, sees them al in water so long that there
remain about five or six ounces: then steep therein one ounce of the rinds
of Mirobalans Chebuli, whilst that the decoction is still hot, and so let it
stand all night in warm ashes, afterward strain it out, and take three or
four ounces of this decoction, and put thereto half a dragme of Turbith, and
one scruple of Ginger, and then give it him early in the morning: or give to
the patient of the purging Marmalade, like as it is, described in the last part
of this book. For this is also to be given three or four dragms of the
rotules of Diaphenicon, or the Electuarium or Diasena. But if in case he had
rather take pills, then let him use some of these following, to wit,
Stomachicae, De Aloe lota, and Cochiae: afterward must the stomach be warmed
with all kind of spiced Wines, as Hippocras, and such like. Also with losinges
of Diatrion pipereon, Diagalanga, etc. Item, confected Ginger, Annis, Comin,
and Mints, mixed or confected with Sugar. All his meats are to be strewed with
Ginger, with Cloves, Galingall, Pepper, and Cinnamome, and they are also to be
dressed with it.

This confection following is marvelous good for all feebleness, cold, and
bad digestion of the stomach, and also against all hoarsenes. Take Comine
which has been steeped in Vinegar and is dried again, five dragmes, Annis,
Smallage seed, dried Mints, Marioram gentle, Calmus, Rosemary, Marioram, and
Penniroyall, of each three dragms, Spica, Cloves, Cardamome, Nutmegs, of each
one quarter of an ounce, long and common Pepper, of each two dragmes and a
half, Lignum Aloes one dragme and a half: temper them together, and make a
subtle powder of it, and afterward with Honey, into a confection. The Trocisci
de Rosis, do hinder the matter that it run not again after purging, toward
the stomach. If that half an ounce of it be taken with Wine, it comfort,
asswageth the pain, and very much assisteth digestion. Item, anoint the
stomach with the oil of Spike, Masticke, or oil of Wormwood. For a Plaster
may be used that which is described before in the 5.. beginning thus: Take
Masticke three ounces, etc. If there be great cold approaching, then give the
patient one dragme of Mithridate or Treacle, with wine wherein Annis and
Wormwood have been decocted.

Of the pain at the stomach through Melancholia.. 28.
THis pain of the stomach brings with her, together with the foresaid
signs, a sour smatch also upon the tongue, great desire or longing for meat,
but without digestion, with disquietnes, lasks, and vomiting, which do commonly
come all together. For these kinds of maladies do people come commonly to be
wonderful feeble and void of might, for that the heart which is nearest unto
it cannot tolerate this ouerlading and burden. Thus then to remedy these
grievous melancholic humors which do sink into the stomach, these sirupes
following are to be used: Take Burrage roots, Parsley roots, and Fennel
roots, of each one ounce and a half, the inner part of Squils one ounce,
Mints, Hyssope, Hearts tongue, Venus hair, being all green, (if they can be
gotten) of each one handful, Fennel seed, Annis seed, Cuscuta, Licorice,
Corans, Vinegar, of each one ounce, Honey and Sugar, of each six ounces, make
thereof a sirupe.

Another. Take Licorice and Raisins, of each one ounce, flowers of Burrage,
Buglosse, Fennel, Annis, Fennel roots, and Cuscuta, of each half an ounce,
Ginger one quarter of an ounce, Honey and Sugar, of each six ounces, make
forthwith a sirupe of it, or in stead thereof use Oxymel of Squils, with water
of Burrage, which takes away the belching of the stomach.

For to purge, this following may be used: Take water of Burrage, and of
Buglosse, of each one ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, Licorice and
Corans, of each one ounce, Thymus and wild Thyme, Polypodie roots, of each
half an ounce: seethe them together, and steep therein one ounce of
Mirobalani Indi the space of a whole night, then wring it well out, and temper
with it one dragme of Azure stone prepared, and give it to the patient betimes
in the morning.

There may also be used for to purge, the confection of Seen leaves, afterward
strengthen the stomach with the confection Aromatico Caryophilato, Diapliris
cum Moscho, Laetitia Galeni, Diathamaron, and anoint the same with the
foresaid oil. His meat shall he strew measurably with spices: he must drink
but a little old Wine. He must use moderate exercise, and bath often. All that
is outwardly to be done is to be taken out of the 24..

But if so be that there be any belching proceeding of unnatural heat, (which
nevertheless chances very seldom) then is the patient to use the sirupe of
Wormwood, or Wormwood wine, or Wormwood water. In like sort also he is to
purge afterward with Hiera Picra, and not to disquiet himself, for that these
medicines be hot of nature, because they do purge both Choleram and the
stomach. Otherwise must this patient be ordered, like as in the debilitie of
the stomach through heat, is taught in the 6.. And good heed is to be taken
that the digestive virtue may be strengthened. Set also a great boxing cup upon
the belly without picking the space of one hour, yet otherwhiles taking it
off, and afterward anoint the stomach with the foresaid oil, or some other
oil, wherein Annis, Comin, Fennel, Rue, or Penniroyall, is decocted.

The Aristology has also a great power to expel all wind and pain of the
stomach. And as concerning the order of life, or diet, there is always to be
used all light meats, and white wine, and that with sobriety.

Of the pain in the stomach through a hot impostume.. 29.
THese impostumes which the Greeks do call Apostema, and the Latinists
Abscessus, are like a separation from that which is whole and firm in a man's
body, or is separated into two parts, and does make an exulceration, which we
do call in our common speech an Impostume, as a word lent us from the Grecians
themselves: but in our English tongue we do call an impostume a Botch or a Byle,
which comes to an issue which breaks out and heals. The difference
between an impostume and an exulceration is, that the impostume breaks out
and heals speedily; but an exulceration endures long and corrodeth, like as
the same may also happen in the stomach.

The causes of these impostumes may be blows, falls, and other outward bruses;
all which do make pain in the stomach, which grows afterward unto an
Impostume, through the falling down of some bad humors into it: so that if the
foresaid humors be not drawn thence, then there befalls more harm unto it.
And that we may write somewhat of it, we will first begin with the hot
impostume.

In case then that with the pain in the stomach there be an Ague and an
impostume, which may outwardly be felt through the heat and otherwise; then
may it easily be adjudged, that this disease is caused through heat and
Cholera. It happens also that the pains is so vehement, so intolerable, and
the heat so abundant, that it seems that the patient would burn: so that he
loses his senses, and thereby happens also to fall into a frenzy or some
other madness, with a forcible vomiting and parbraking.

For this, must the Liver vein or Median be opened, and afterward these
Refrigerations to be forthwith laid upon it. Take Rose water six ounces, the
juice of Quinces one ounce and a half, red and white Saunders, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Camfere one scruple; temper them all together: This is (as
it is said) to be used at the beginning. Afterward, if the cause requires,
there must be sundry plasters made ready. The first is this ensuing: Take red
and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce, the seed of Plantaine, of
Purslaine and Wormwood, of each one dragme and a half, Barley meal two ounces,
Camfere one scruple, oil of Roses and of Quinces, of each one ounce and a
half; let them seethe all together until it be thick. But in the increase of
the pain, then temper amongst this plaster the grease of Ducks and Hens, as
much as is needful: and when as this malady is at the highest, put Smallage
unto it, Dates, Fenegreeke, Bdellium and Vinegar, of each one quarter of an
ounce, and then mix it as is aforesaid.

But if the disease begin to wax old, yt the heat were gone, and yet there
remain nevertheless a hardness of the stomach, then be one of these plasters
following to be laid upon it: take Violets two dragmes and a half, Roses five
dragms, Spike and Masticke, of each three dragmes, Cipers roots, Squinant and
Calmus, of each one quarter of an ounce, Fenegreeke meal two ounces and a
half, Cammomill, Hollihocke roots and Barley meal, of each one quarter of an
ounce; temper them all together with the muscilage of Linseede unto a pap. This
pappe is also good for all hard swellings of the stomach, and of the Liver: it
asswageth the pain, and ripeneth all impostumations. Or in the stead of this
you may also use this plaster of Meliloto, Diachylon, or Ceroton de Hyssopo,
and four hours after meat, when the meat is digested, the stomach is to be
anointed with the oil of Masticke and Wormwood, and further the place
covered with sheep wool. Item, take Pitch and Rosin, of each two ounces,
Colophonia one ounce and a half, Mastick and Frankincense, of each one quarter
of an ounce, Aloe one ounce and a half, molten Lard one ounce, oil of
Masticke four ounces, green Wax as much as suffiseth for a plaster: you may
also make a salve of it: and it is very good both ways.

It is also needful for to purge, which must be effected with mild Clisters,
whereof diverse stand here and there declared. Afterward give the patient one
ounce of Cassie, or two ounces of Manna dissolved in Endive water. And if this
do not sufficiently relaxe, then give him every day one ounce, or one ounce and
a half of Cassie. And in case that the Ague do not remit, then open a vein,
and purge once again as before. Take three dragms of peeled Gourd seeds, make
thereof milk with Barley water, and three dragmes of Rosewater, like unto
Almond milk. Seven days after, give him half a dragme of Trociscis de Rosis
tempered with Endive water. He is afterward to take every day this ensuing:
Take of the water of Smallage, and Fennel water, of each one ounce, the juice
of Wormwood one quarter of an ounce, Masticke, one dragme; temper them
together, and use one of the prescribed plasters, Barley paps, Oaten paps, and
otherwhiles stued Spinach may he well eat. Or Burrage boiled in Hen broth, and
Almond milk is very meet for him. Stued Pears, Apples, Quinces, and ripe
Plums may he also eat. Water or Sugar water must be his drink. In fine, such
kind of sick folk must be kept very sober, for that is the best medicine for
this sickness.

Of the impostumes of the stomach, which be of a cold nature.. 30.
IF so be that this impostume of the stomach do proceed of a cold and moist
cause, which may quickly be perceived through the small pain, the bad
digestion of the stomach, small Ague, little thirst, and much spettle: then is
the patient to be holden very sober in meat and drink, and beware of vomiting
and purging: but at the first must be given him one dragme, or one dragme and a
half of these Trociscis following.

Take Squinant, Cassie wood, Rubarb, and Calmus of each three drag. Saffron,
Myrrh, Costus, Annis and Pepper, of each one dragme, Bdellium three dragmes,
Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Ammoniacum one dragme, form Trociscos of it
with vine euict.

Afterward you may use this plaster following: Take Cammomill and Melilot, of
each one ounce, Fennel, Roses, Cipers nuts and the leaves, of each half an
ounce, Fenegreeke meal, oil of Cammomill, and oil of Roses, of each one
ounce: temper them together unto a plaster.

Or make this plaster following: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Priests crown,
Penniroyall and Dill, of each half a dragme, Wormwood and Spikenard, of each
three dragmes, Masticke one quarter of an ounce, oil of Roses four ounces,
make a pap of it with the muscilage of Hollihocke roots.

But when this disease is increasing and at the chief, then put Ammoniacum,
Opopanacum dissolved in wine, and liquid Styrax unto it, of each half a
dragme, Hens and Goose grease, of each one ounce, oil of Spica six ounces,
and make a plaster of it. This is forcible to maturate all Impostumes. For
this is also good the plasters de Meliloto, and the black Diachylon.

For the common man, take oil of Wormwood and Goats dung; temper them unto a
plaster: Or take oil wherein Wormwood has been decocted, Mallows boiled in
Mutton broth and dressed with butter.

Now for to expel this cold matter, this Sirupe following is to be used: Take
Mints, Wormwood, Venus hair, being all green (if they can be gotten) of each
three handfuls, Roses one ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, Cipers nuts,
Spikenard, of each one dragme, honey of Roses twelve ounces: then make a sirupe
of it, like as in the first part, in the first chapter, and. 6. is taught: give
thereof every morning, and in the evening before supper half an ounce, with
the decoction of Mints and Masticke. For a purgation he is to take one ounce of
Hiera Picra, tempered with three dragms of Cassie and Sugar, or dissolve it
with the foresaid decoction, and then drink it. Afterward the patient is to
take every third day this prescribed Laxatiue.

Heed is also to be taken therein, when as the impostume in the stomach will
break out, which may be well perceived hereby; to wit, if there be great pain
about the place where the impostume is. Likewise when the patient does eat
sower and harsh things: if in going to the stool, or in any thing that he
vomiteth, there be seen any corruption. Item, if there come any stench out of
the stomach, and that the pain diminishes somewhat after he has vomited: for
this the stomach is to be cleansed well in Summer season with Barley water, and
that in the mornings especially, and at afternoon, taking every time five or
six ounces. Or take water wherein Gum and Licorice have been decocted.

For this is Whay also very requisite. He is two hours afterward to take one
quarter of an ounce of this powder following tempered with four ounces of the
juice of Quinces, or sirupe of the same in water wherein Butchers broom seed,
Myrtle seed, and Purslaine seed have been decocted. In the winter must the
stomach be also cleansed at the same time with Barley water wherein Hyssope,
Squinant, Honey, or honey of Roses were decocted, and thereupon to use this
powder following.

Take Roses, blossoms of Pomegranates, and Amber, of each half an ounce, fine
Bolus three quarters of an ounce: mix them well together being beaten small.
This patient may also wear this plaster ensuing upon his stomach: Take fine
Bolus, Momy, Myrrh, Masticke, and Aloe, of each half an ounce, Pitch or Rosin
as much as is needful for to make a plaster.

Of exulcerations in the stomach.. 31.
WHat difference there is between the impostume and the exulceration of the
stomach, we have sufficiently declared in the 29.. therefore have the learned
by good reason written of these two kinds of diseases severally. As much as
concerns the exulcerations, the which the Latinists do call Vlcera, they grow
otherwhiles of the impostumes and chiefly if they be hot. For if the same be
not thoroughly healed, then does this exulceration follow. The same be
sometimes caused through choleric and sharp rheumes, which fall out of the
head into the stomach, and there then through their sharpness do excoriate
the stomach; like as the same happens oftentimes to the Lights. Also these
vlcerations may be caused of some sharp and corroding meats; like as through
the excessive use of Mustard or the seeds, much salt, and such like. For if
there come of this sharpness into the stomach, then does the same gnaw and
corrode it. Now for to speak of the signs of it, the disease it self shows
some, and does demonstrate unto others the place. If there be a pricking pain
present, then does it cast out the meat back again, as a thing which is
noisome unto it, so that it cannot stay in the stomach: whereby also the
retentiue virtue is enfeebled. Item, if the patient do take any sour meat or
drink, then does the pain increase, which would not have happened if he had
used milk, butter; or any other sweet meat. Item, if one do smell any kind
of stench through the belching, with drouth of the mouth and thirst which
proceeds out of the stomach; then it is a token of an exulceration in the
stomach. Item, for that this exulceration is so near the heart, there do come
also great swounings, ach of the head, and the loss of understanding. But the
signs which do manifest the place of the ulcer, are these: namely, when the
neck of the stomach is excoriated, then does the patient feel pain in the
swallowing down, and especially if it be any thing which is sour or sharp
that he swalloweth; which pain he feels also even to the point of his
shoulder blade, but chiefly in the mouth of the stomach and pit of the heart.
Item, if the disease be in the mouth of the stomach, which is very sensible,
then is the pain greater, and especially if one do swallow down any sharp
and salt meats, whereby the breath also will be much indamaged and hindered.

But if the disease be in the bottom of the stomach, then does one feel no
pain in eating and drinking, but after that it is received: some signs
likewise of it may be perceived in the excrements; they that desire to have more
other signs, may read in the discourse of the Rheumes. But before we come to
the remedies of this ulcer in the stomach, there be certain common rules to
be noted, whereof the first is: If this disease must be helped, then is the
same always to be begun with drying things. The second: albeit that it is
needful to use drying things, yet nevertheless must heed he taken that there
be no sharp drying things used, as Copperas, burnt Coperas, Verdigrease, and
such like, because they be of a venomous nature. The third: all vlcerations of
the stomach can be hardly cleansed of the corruption like as any other which
may be outwardly seen, but it must be done only with things which do drive it
downwards out of the stomach. The fourth: these ulcers are not through any
vomits to be cleansed, for that the tough corruption is hard impacted in the
ulcer, and would through vomiting be drawn all together, the which the purging
medicine does not, for that it stirs the stomach not so sore, but drives
out the matter gently downwards. The fifth: in the exulcerations of the
stomach may not any strong medicine be given, that they be not the more harmed
by it. The sixth: without a perfect mundification can no incarnation take any
place in any ulcer. The seventh: all which is given to such patients, is to be
done in the morning early, or must be dispatched before supper time, to the end
that the medicine through the meat might not be hindered. The eight: whether
this ulcer be in the neck, or top, or in the bottom of the stomach, there
must be somewhat always added unto the incarnatiues that is clammy, as Gum and
Dragagant, to the end that the foresaid medicines might stick the better, or
cleave to the place infected. The ninth: because that the stomach is so
infected of a bad digesture, you are to give him to eat a little, and likewise
light meats.

When as then this malady shall be known through the foresaid signs, and is
yet new, then is there to be used none other but astringent and drying things,
for which these Trocisci following are to be made: Take Roses, blossoms of
Pomegranates, Frankincense, Butchers broom seed, burnt Iuorie, and Dragon
blood, of each a like quantity, made into Trocisces of the weight of a dragm,
and give one of them every morning and one every evening two hours before
supper, with the juice of Quinces or such like.

But in case that this exulceration of the stomach be of continuance, then it
is to be feared that there is still some corruption in it. For this, there are
to be used certain days together, mundifications, as Barley water, or Meade,
and also incarnatiues. Afterward are Barley water and sirupe of Quinces to be
used, and astringent things to be eaten after it, as Medlars, Services, and
such like.

Or use in stead thereof Oxysacchara, and Oxymel, of each one ounce, temper
them with Barley water, and use it as is said. Then take one drag. of Trociscis
de Carabe. Item, there is also good for this disease one dragme of Hiera Picra,
often used with Barley water or Meade. And if the body have need of any
laxatiue medicaments, then use thereto Cassie, or any mild Clister.

With this disease does come otherwhiles the Laske, which is to be stayed with
Trociscis de Spodio, or De Carabe. Note ye also here, that many of those things
(which be described in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and the 17.. against
the bloody flixe) are very requisite for this disease.

This patient is to order himself always (as is recited already) with all
light meats, as Pullets, Hens, Partriches, new laid Eggs, Barley paps, and Oaten
pappes. In like manner Lambs feet and Sheep feet used in this disease, are
very meet. Buttermilke is also good for this. His drink must be ripe Wine
without any sharpnes: also Barley water tempered with a stopping sirupe, which
likes you best.

Of the stinking breath through the exulceration of the stomach.. 32.
WHere as be such choleric humors in the stomach, there is commonly a foul
stench with them, which may be perceived by the breath, and that for the most
part with thirst, drouth and bitterness of the mouth, the which discloseth it
self more before than after meat. For this is also good the sirupe of Vinegar
and Oxysacchara mixed with the sirupe of Wormwood: this is not only good for
the cold, but also for all hot exulcerations. This patient is also to be purged
with Aloe and yellow Mirobalans. Afterward he is to use the Rotulae
Triasantali, Peaches, dried Melons, Pompeons, Abricockes, Quince pears,
Lettice with Vinegar, Barley and other sour things, which be very good for
him. Fish, Milk, Salt flesh, Onions, Garlic, and such like shall he forbear.

But in case that this foul stench of the stomach do proceed of cold humors,
then is the sirupe of Wormwood to be used certain days together, tempered
with one third part of Oxymel of Squils: and afterward the patient must be
purged with the pills Stomachicae. And further to use the Tabulates of
Diagalanga, of Diambra, Diapliris, and such like, which be hot of nature.
Confected Mirobalans, and especially Bellirici, and Chebuli, Conserve of
Rosemary, or confected Ginger, are all very good. He must wash his mouth often
with odoriferous waters, and cleanse the teeth very well. As much as concerns
meat and drink, we have made before in the first part, the thirteenth
Chapter, and 3.. a very long discourse of a stinking mouth and breath. Item,
yet more which may there be used in the second Part, the fifth Chapter and 25..

Of the schirrositie of the stomach.. 33.
IT comes also oftentimes to pass, that the stomach happens to harden
without any exulceration, which that it may outwardly be discerned, the causes
of this hardness or schirrosity may be as well through cold, as through wind,
whereof is sufficiently written before in the 25. and 26.. Also this hardness
may be well caused through melancholy, the which through sour smatch of the
mouth, and sour belching may be known, even as the other proceeding of
Phlegma by drouth, and tough spettle, without heat and thirst. For this
purpose is this salve following to be made: Take oil of white Cam^lina, Rue,
Cammomill, and of Wormwood, of each one ounce, the grease of Hens, Kytes, and
Geese, of each half an ounce, the salve of Dialthea, one ounce and a half:
anoint the stomach warm with it, and cover it with unwashed sheep wool.
Also you may prepare for this use this plaster following: Take Cammomill,
Comin, Caraway, and Cresses seed, of each one ounce, Frankincense, Mastick,
Bdellium, of each half an ounce, Spikenard and Saffron, of each one quarter of
an ounce, the dregs of Sallad oil and Wax as much as is needful for to make a
plaster, spread the same upon leather, and wear it on the stomach. Or make
this following: Take Wax one ounce, Turpentine half an ounce, Ginger and
Opopanacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Aloe, Galbanum, of each three
dragmes, oil of Galingall as much as will suffice for to make a plaster. It
is also very needful for to comfort the stomach, whereof has been
sufficiently admonished before.

Of the Hickcough in general.. 34.
THis disease of the stomach, which we call the Hickcough, and is called in
Latin Singultus, is a common disease, known unto all men; it comes seldom
and departs quickly, and there is no great cunning to drive it away: for it
is oftentimes driven away with a bit of bread, or with a druaght of wine or
water, as also through the keeping in of the breath, through neesing, through
great motions, through wrath, mirth, and other alterations more of the mind:
like as if any one be frighted or see any heinous thing, if any body cast cold
water into his face, if one do bind hard the outward members, or if one set
boxing cups upon the stomach, which are altogether small means and without
danger. But there comes otherwhiles such a Hickcough that cease not, whereby
the heart, the breast and the lights are weakened: against which the expert
Physicians have found out these remedies following.

But we will first of al discover the nature of the Hickcough and his causes,
which be described as hereafter follows. The Hickcough is a motion of the
natural expulsive virtue of the stomach, which is caused through the feeling
of any thing that is hurtful, and that the stomach desires to expel. This
Hickcough may also be well taken for a crampe of the stomach, for they be both
caused through the repletion or inanition of the stomach. And like as the cramp
is none other thing, but a shrinking or drawing of the sinews back to their
beginning, so is this none other thing, but a distention or contraction of the
stomach unto the place of her beginning: but herein do they differ, that by
the Cramp the sinews are contracted, and by the Hickcough the neck of the
stomach. The cause of the Hickcough are two things, namely, repletion and
windiness, and contrariwise also inanition, as already has been said, which
we will also comprehend in this. Secondly, the causes be also outward and
inward. First, if the stomach be not well defended and kept from cold: also if
the outward members, to wit, the head, the hands, and feet, do suffer too
great cold, which draws up from thence toward the stomach. In like manner,
this Hickcough is also caused well through intolerable heat, whereby the
stomach gets a bad quality, to wit, too hot or too dry. Item, if the head
be sore wounded that the brains be thereby perished: Item, if the stomach be
much ouercharged with meat and drink, or that any kind of corrupted humors be
gathered therein. Moreover, the Hickcough may be caused through any kind of
sharp and biting meats. For if the stomach feel, that it has ever any
thing in it that may hurt her, then does she use two means to discharge her
thereof, which is, through parbraking, or through the Hickcough. It seeks
also thereby to cast out that which lies enclosed in the innermost plights.
But that nature desires to drive that out through the Hickough, which
otherwise through vomiting she does easily bring to pass, this does daily
experience teach us: for if one take any thing which is tart or sharp, as
chiefly Pepper being beaten small, and drink Wine upon it, and the same comes
afterward into the plights of the stomach, then will the Hickough be caused
through the heat thereof, and the stomach seeks through the Hickough to
expel the same Wine again. But by reason that this is caused through inward
occasions, then does it oftentimes happen through the stomach only, and through
other infected members, to wit, through impostumes of the head, of falls, and
blows, through breach of the Skull, and impostumation of the Liver, as when
the same is ouerheated, that it sends sharp, pricking and sour humors
toward the stomach, or that the same run thitherwards from other parts.

If so be that this Hickough do only proceed of the stomach, then comes it
of tough cold, or heat, and biting humors, whereby some bad impostumes, or
exulcerations be provoked. Item, this Hickough is also caused through great
emptiness or inanition of the stomach, which comes through lingering Agues,
long abstinence, great labor, much purging, continual laskes, and much
parbraking. But if so be that it comes suddenly upon one without any long
precedent sickness, and that a body find himself well before meat, and
after meat ill at ease if he have well eaten and drunken, and thereupon do
rest a long time, then it is a sure sign that this Hickough proceeds of the
fulness of the stomach. But if they be cold or tough humors which provoke this
Hickough, then are all warm things very welcome to the patient, and he feels
always some kind of cold in the stomach. Or if it be caused through heat,
then desires he all cold things, and feels always a gnawing pain in the
stomach. With the impostumes are always Agues, pains, and inappetencie
annexed: also the patient after parbraking, and after the laske, feels
himself somewhat lightened: when as then the impostume is broken, that may be
perceived by tart and sour things that one takes. All other signs of this
several malady which is outwardly, may be required of the patient himself,
and of such as stand by. In like manner, if the breath savor, then is it a
sign of some kind of foul stinking humor or meat which putrifieth in the
stomach. If it come through cold of the stomach, that may be known through
feeling, and all that is cold is prejudicial unto him, and all warm things be
acceptable. Or if this Hickough be caused through repletion and fulness, with
anguishes, strains, and with many belchings, then may it be perceived what
humors they be, by the sweetness, bitterness, and saltness.

Of the Hickough through repletion, and winds.
WHen as then the Hickough comes on any body, after that he has eaten gross
meat and has drunken, then it is certain enough, that it is caused through
repletion of the stomach, through coldness of the matter, and of winds, which
the Grecians do call Empneumatosin, which is a distention. For this, the
stomach is first to be unburdened through vomiting, and to induce his body
through loosenes; for which, there is to be taken Hiera picra, Rubarbe, and
Agaricus. And if so be that these mild things will not help, then are you to
use these precious pills following: Take burnt Iuorie, seeds of Endive, of
Purslaine, and Lignum Aloes, of each one dragme and a half, sour Dates half
an ounce, Rubarbe one ounce, this being beaten all small, and if so be that you
will, then put Vinegar unto it, or the sirupe of Mints. Or if you had rather
have the same soft like a sirupe, then take so much the more Vinegar, or sirupe
with it, and take every day half an ounce of it.

For this is also commodious the conserues of Bayberries, de baccis Lauri: so
is also the confection Diacyminum, Diatrion pipereon, bare, and confected Annis
seeds, confected Ginger, Comin, Caraway, Galingall, Mints, Ameos, Masticke,
Cloves, Frankincense, Marioram, and field Mints, through all which things,
Powders, Confections, Conserues and all that one will, and may be made. You
have also certain good things in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and 17..
which be very good for this use. But above all, Cloves are very good for to
strengthen the stomach, and to consume all bad humors, which cause this
Hickough. The sirupe of Mints is also highly commended for this purpose.

This Confection following may also be prepared: Take Spica, Squinant, Calmus,
Annis, Fennel, Mints, Wormwood, and Costus, of each one dragme, Saffron,
Lignum Aloes, and Cloves, of each two scruples, Mastick and Roses, of each one
dragme and a half, Opium, prepared Coriander, white Poppie seed, Cassie wood,
of each half a dragme, the Muscilage of Fleawort, as much as will suffice for
to make losinges with: but they be more meet and pleasant, if they be made with
Sugar, taking to every ounce of powder twelve ounces of Sugar, if one will make
Sugar losinges with it. If so be that then the Hickcough plague one too sore,
then take Spec. Dialangae one dragme, Philonium half a dragme, temper it, and
take it with Wine in the morning.

This following is to be drunken: Take Comin, white Mints, of each a like
quantity, and a little Frankincense; seethe it in water, and drink of it
oftentimes warm, it expels the wind and cold matter of the stomach.

Item, the same does also the water of Rue, being drunken fasting, or prepare
this Wine following: Take Diptamum beaten small half an ounce, Treacle one
dragme, temper them together with one ounce of wine. For his meat, all common
Venison, and all kind of Birds, as Pullets and Pigeons, etc. be very fit, but
they be always better roasted then sodden. And all that he eats boiled, is to
be dressed or stued with Spices.

But if all the foresaid things will not yet drive away the Hickcough, then is
there to be given to the patient Trociscos de Olibano five dragmes, Elecampane
roots three dragmes, dried Rosemary, and Rue, of each one quarter of an ounce,
seed of Mints, or the herb, three dragms and a half, make thereof Trocisks
with sirupe of Mints, and give thereof one dragme and a half at once.

Other do commend this following: Take Costus roots, Saffron, Roses, Masticke,
and Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce, Asarabacca one dragme, Aloe, Opium,
of each half a dragme, make also Trociscos of it with the muscilage of
Fleawoort, and give him one dragme thereof. These Trocisci are to be taken
alone when the Hickcough shall get the maisterie.

Outwardly are these things to be used: Take the decoction of Comin, white
Mints, and Frankincense, (like as is said for the drink) make a sponge wet in
it, and being wroong out, lay it oftentimes warm upon the stomach. Aqua vitae
is also commodious for this, Vital water, Oils, and other things, like as is
described before in the pain of the stomach. In like manner one may foment
the place with warm water of Rue, or that which is more forcible must the same
be well rubbed with, as is before rehearsed.

Item, there may moreover be taken for this purpose, dry Wormwood, Mints, and
Comin, powned together, sewed in a bag, and so laid upon the stomach. Also the
stomach must be anointed with warm oil, to wit, oil of Wormwood, Masticke
and such like, and then to wear over it this plaster following: Take
Frankincense, Mastick, Wormwood, and Mints, of each half an ounce, Laudanum
one ounce and a half, Annis, Fennel, Cloves, and Spica, of each one dragme,
make a plaster of them with Wax, for to be laid upon the stomach. Also
regard is to be had unto the patient that he incline himself as much as is
possible to sleeping, and fasting. And if so be that he be somewhat lean, then
is he to bathe otherwhiles, for that the same consumes the cold matter which
does cause the Hickcough.

Of the Hickough, caused through emptiness and inanition.
IF so be that this Hickcough do come after an Ague, by the disquietnesse,
vomiting, thirst, and drouth of the mouth, then is the patient to take
oftentimes a little warm water: and if so be that the Hickcough will not
thereby avoid and tarry away, then is he to take Barley water, with oil of
sweet Almonds. For this is also requisite Barley pap made with milk: also
warm milk as it comes from the Cow, Pullet broth, rere sodden Eggs, Wine
which is not too strong: the muscilage of Fleawoort with the Iulep, and the
juice of Pomegranats being drunken, is also good for this intent.

Also annoint the backbone from above till beneath, or rather the whole body
with Salla^ oil, or oil of Roses.

Boxing cups set upon the stomach, and behind upon the back, be much commended
for this disease: also the rubbing of all the outward members.

Lastly, we are to think upon the young children, who were wont to be vexed
much with the Hickcough. In case they be still nourished at the breast, and do
not digest well, through any piercing cold, or that their milk does come to
curd in the stomach, then are they to use none other medicine, but that their
stomach be anointed with this oil following, tempered together, or each
alone, and then to lay a warm cloth upon it, to wit, oil of Masticke, of
Wormwood, of Dill, and Beuercod, and that the nurse, which gives suck, do
eat light meats.

Of insatiable hunger in general.. 35.
OF all other accidents of the stomach, there comes also an insatiable
hunger, which the learned do divide into four parts, and some into five, which
parts are comprehended in the first, and so we will also let it rest. The
first, the Greeks do call Cynorexian, the Latinists Caninum, which is Dogs
hunger. The second Bulimos, some have alleged this for Dogs hunger, which we
also esteem to be the same. The third is, Syncopalis, which brings swouning
with it. The last is, the lost or spoiled hunger, whereof we now intend to
write.

Of the Dogs hunger, or the insatiable appetite of meat.
THis hunger is (as is said) an unnatural lust or desire of meat, and has
his name of the Dog an insatiable beast, and so greedy in eating, that he must
cast it out again, and seeks immediately to fill himself again. All such
manner of hunger may also come unto men, and that as well through cold, as
through heat, of the air, hard running, great labor, long watching, forcible
Agues, great lasks, or worms of the stomach or bowels, which consume the
meat. In like manner also of any kind of humors, which do fall into the
stomach and there enfeeble the retentiue virtue, and do drive down the meat
oftentimes with vehemency, or that the expulsive force be too extreme strong.
This malady comes commonly after a fervent Ague, and much vomiting. It does
also happen through overmuch heat of the stomach that is long continuing,
whereby it digesteth much, and always desires more. The other principal
occasion is cold, which sticks fast in the mouth of the stomach, whereof
comes also an unnatural desire of meat. And how much greater that the cold
is, so much the greater is the hunger, and that so long, until all the virtues
of it be weakened. The third occasion may be some sour humor, or of Phlegma
and Melancholia, which may be retained in the mouth of the stomach, and does
there provoke this lust and desire of meat. The signs of this unnatural
hunger, which is caused through warmth of the time, through great labor, and
such like, are discovered before, also through unnatural cold, much watching,
etc. and all other outward accidents, which are to be demanded of the patient
himself. Or if this disease be caused through worms, such has likewise his
sure signs, which be mentioned in their place.

If so be that this hunger then do proceed only through heat of the
stomach, or through heat of the whole body, then is there great thirst with
it. And if it be caused through any humors, debilitie of the retentiue, or
vehemency of the expulsive virtues, it may be to be seen by the meat, that
auoideth undigested through the stool.

But if this disease be caused through melancholy, then is there with it a
pricking, or gnawing, with a drouth of the mouth, the patient sleeps but
little, and that with terrible dreams, and has ill fantasies in his head.
When as then this malady comes through cold, then does the patient always
feel himself troubled after meat, and he must by and by vomit up the same
again, or the same passes from him downwards undigested. Present regard is
to be had, that the body be not filled full of bad humors, whereby the
Consumption might at last ensue, and Lieuteria, yea the Dropsy it self. And
if this should so continue a certain time, then follows at last Bulimos, and
afterward Syncopalis, (whereof we have spoken before) which takes people out
of the world. If so be then this unnatural hunger be caused through any
outward or accidental occasion, the same are to be prevented with contrary
remedies, to wit, with alteration of cold dwellings into warm; of great
labor, into rest and sleep, etc. In case then that this hunger be caused
through coldness of the stomach, then are warm things for purging, and other
warm remedies to be used, which might expel the cold matter from the stomach,
whereof we have written herebefore in the 5.. and of all that strengthens the
stomach. For this, it is also required by all the learned, that these kinds of
patients should eat boiled Rice, with the fat of Mutton stued, or that is
dropped off from roast meat. All fat things moderatly used are very good for him;
as Sallad oil, and such like. But if this malady do come through cold sour
Phlegma then it is good that he boil Marioram in all his meats. He may also
use Mustard, Honey, Nuts, Almonds, Onions and Garlic; he may also the space
of certain days eat Goats milk, with the oil of Violets, because that
these fat meats do drive above in the stomach, therefore they do supple the
mouth of the stomach, and do make a lothsomnes to feeding.

The second: It is then passing good, that such do drink much old and strong
red wine at their meals, which is also very good to slake hunger with. Also
for this Dogs hunger, are warm Confections to be used; as namely, Letitiae
Galeni, Diapliris cum Moscu, Diatrionpipereon, Triphera magna, good confects,
Ginger, Hippocras, and other spiced wines more, made sweet rather with Honey
than with Sugar.

But this is not spoken of the hunger which comes through long fasting, of
great scouring of the bloody flixe, or of strong purgations; but only of this
insatiable hunger which is called Dogs hunger. If so be then every such patient
shall observe this decreed order, then will this hunger abate very much, and
also be thoroughly cured in time.

But in case that this hunger proceed of heat, and the meat do not molest
him, neither yet is cast out above nor beneath (like as it was wont to be) if
after a lingering sickness, he were ouercharged with meat, and if the stomach
and all the whole body be waxen hot, they are to be fed with meats which be
not easy to be digested: as namely, old Beef, Mutton, Porke, and also all
kind of pottages, of Pease and Beans, of Rice and Wheat boiled in milk,
great fishes, Tripes, feet and Livers of all beasts; also hatd sodden Eggs: and
in fine, with all that is hard of digestion, which lies long in the stomach,
and wherewith the stomach may be cloyed. Also his meats ought to be dressed
with some cold things: for which Melons, Cucumbers, and Gourds be very good. He
is to keep himself also in the cold air. His drink must be always good
Claret wine. And for a conclusion, he must eschew all spice and strong wines.
But if so be the stomach be too much ouercharged, and too much burdened, then
is the patient to be forced to vomit, through such means as be herebefore
oftentimes expressed.

The stomach is outwardly to be anointed with cold oils, likewise also with
unguent of Roses, with the cooling salve Galeni, with the white Camfere salve,
with Vinegar and Rosewater, wherein is a little Allume dissolved. And if so be
that the same be not any thing which hinders it, then let the patient bathe in
cold water. And if so be that this hunger be caused through melancholy, then
prepare this sirupe following: Take the roots of Sperage, Fennel, Parsley,
Smallage, Butchers broom, Thyme, Comin, Burrage, Buglosse, Hearts tongue,
Raisins, the stones taken out, flowers of Burrage, and of Buglosse, of each
half an ounce, Fumitorie half a handful, Honey eighteen ounces: make a
sirupe of them, and give him each time one ounce and a half, or two ounces.
For to purge use the Confection of Seen leaves, or this potion following: Take
Seen leaves, Polypody roots, and Annis, of each half an ounce, Currants one
ounce; let them sees together in eight ounces of water unto the half, then
temper therein beaten Epithymum one quarter of an ounce, Seen powder, and
prepared Agaricus, of each half a dragme, Cloves half a scruple, make thereof
a potion: And if need be, open the Saluatella, upon the right hand. He is also
to be ordered in his diet, as is before rehearsed, and all things are to be
forborne which may provoke appetite, as has been showed before in the 9.. It
is also said, that hard roasted Eggs after other meat, be very meet for this
purpose. And it happens also very well (like as is briefly spoken of before)
that if one recover after a long continued sickness, that there does follow a
very great hunger: but they are to have no hard or gross meats given them; as
Beef, great fishes, unleavened bread, or such like, because that their
digestion is as yet very feeble, whereby they might easily fall again into a
new disease: but then are they to be kept with subtle meats; as with fat
Pullets, Capons, Fowls, Butter, and such like, and all unnatural and
unmeasurable eating is to be withstood and repugned as much as is possible.

Of the Cow hunger which is called Bulimos.
THis unnatural and insatiable hunger Bulimos, is as much to say with the
Grecians, as a very great hunger: which name, the successors have somewhat
altered, and have made thereof Bulismos. And it is thus described: Bulimos,
which is a hunger of the members, whereby the stomach is satisfied. And this
is also a great disease of the stomach, which takes his beginning from the
stomach it self. But it is contrary to Dogs hunger in these things following:
to wit, although they have both of them an insatiable lust and desire of meat,
yet with the Dogs hunger is not only a desire, but also the feeding it self:
but in the Cow hunger, it chances that the patient who has lately eaten, is
moved immediately to eat again, where nevertheless all lust to eat, and to
cast it up, is taken away. But there is no such hunger in the stomach, which is
to be satisfied with a bit; but in the inward parts which be desirous of meat
without interceasing: and when the stomach is against her will ouerburdened
and cloyed, then will it be overmuch disordered, and out of quiet or square,
for to discharge her duty of digestion.

Secondly, in the Dogs hunger the virtues of the stomach and other parts be
for a while strong and able: but in this Cow hunger are they withered and
weak. And because that such sickness is caused as well through heat as
through cold; therefore must we severally write thereof.

The greatest occasion of this Bulimia, is, when winter time is, the stomach is
cooled too much with cold, then drives the humors toward the stomach, out of
the veins, in the inward parts, filling them therewith, spoiling the appetite,
and also depriving the stomach therewith of all her force and vigor: in the
mean while the other parts remain empty and hungry, desiring much their
food and sustenance. Hence then this insatiable hunger does proceed: so that
this is properly an hunger of the members, and is no hunger at all of the
stomach. If so be that then any one, as is said, be so extremely cooled, and
although there come such a lust of feeding upon him, yet it is very quickly
slaked. This disease brings otherwhile such a quaume with it, that the
patient is caused to cast out some tough slime or corruption: and then will all
outward members (which be defrauded of their nourishment) be enfeeled,
impotent, over cold, and the pulse very small. The sick person has sour
belchings from the stomach, and a foul smatch in the mouth. The urine is
bleake, likewise the ordure black colored, thin, and also otherwhiles hard,
because that the patient can eat very little, or nothing at al. Now then,
whether this disease be caused or not, through great cold of Winter time, or
cold slime of the stomach, the patient is certain days together, to take
morning and evening a draught of Oxymel Compositum, or of Squils, with water
wherein Galingale is decocted: afterward he is to vomit and purge with
Mirobalani Chebuli, Bellirici, and Emblici The like also with the pills
Foetidae, stomachicae, or with these following: Take Turbith, Agaricus, of each
one dragme, Spica and Ginger, of each one dragme: temper them together, and
take one dragme of it at once, and afterward he is to use this confection
following, namely, Diamoschu, Diambra, Trionpipereon, Diacymino, Diagalanga,
and that especially after purging. All his meat must be also dressed and strewed
with spice, and also be rather always roasted then boiled. Rue water drunken is
also very necessary, but chiefly good old wine, which is somewhat binding by
nature.

Before dinner and supper, the stomach is to be well anointed with the oil
of Masticke and of Spike tempered together. Also to bath in water, wherein
Wormwood, Melilot, Cammomill, and Butchers broom has been decocted.

What is more to be used for this, look in the same Chapter, in the 5.. which
remedies be most fit for it. These kind of patients are also to be sprinkled
oftentimes with Rose water, or fair Well water upon their bodies and their
faces, that the natural heat may be driven inward, and the inward members may
be strengthened. They are also to hold oftentimes spice before their noses, and
to use it in their meat. His wine must be always strengthened and enabled
with Cinnamom, Pepper, Cloves, and with Spica, and with them and with vinegar
is he to sprinkle a hot stone, and to receive the vapor of it. The chamber is
to be fumed with Lignum Aloes, or with Muscus, Ambra, black and white
Frankincense, Laudanum, Masticke, Galingale, with Citron peeles and Orange
peeles, Gallia and Alipta Muscata, with each alone, or with which you please.

But if this disease come through heat, then is this unnatural hunger of the
members caused of the resolved humors of the veins and other members which
pass into the stomach, and there oppress the stomach, with lothsomnes and
irksomeness of feeding. But they are to wash their mouth very often with a
little Oxysacchara, or with veriuice. Likewise also to use Iulep of Roses, with
a little Camfere, or sirupe of Roses mixed with Saunders. For this is also meet
all cooling things, and especially them that have a binding operation, whereof
there be many discovered in the same Chapter, and the 6..

Afterward, the patient is to be purged with Mirobalans, with Rubarbe, or
sour Dates stewed in the decoction of Prunes, as also with Hiera Picra, or
sirupe of vinegar tempered with the said decoction. Afterward he shall use the
confection Rosata Nouella, or Triasantalon. His meat must be dressed with
veriuice, and with Butchers broom seeds, and strewed with odoriferous cooling
things. For his drink he is to take good clear wine delayed meetly well with
water.

It is also good for this patient, that he bath in water wherein Roses, Myrtle
seed, and Endive be decocted, and afterward anoint the stomach even to the
navel with the oil of Myrtle, and oil of Roses, wherein is a little vinegar
tempered. In like manner may he irrigate the members from on high with
Rosewater, or cold Well water.

Of the swouning Hunger called Syncopalis.
THe third unnatural hunger has his name (as is said) of the swouning which
it brings with it: and the same comes commonly after the first described
Bulimo, or such like sickness, for that the natural powers are very faint and
debilitated.

Also because this hunger is so near unto the heart, that it cannot tolerate
such debilitie, even as it has been here before sufficiently taught. Also in
respect hereof, for that some have so weak and so tender a mouth of the
stomach, that they cannot abide any fasting: but when they begin to be hungry,
and may not by and by have food, do fall presently into a swoune. When this
happens, then are the outward members to be rubbed hard, and bounden with
pain, and the face sprinkled with Rosewater, or washed and quickened with
other things which be mentioned in the second part, the sixth Chapter and 2..
But if so be that his force be not quite spent, or if one perceive that the
swouning will come upon him, then give him a bit of bread to eat steeped in
wine.

The fourth is a corrupted or bad hunger. But because this hunger for the most
part happens to women with child: therefore we will not discourse here any
further thereof, until such time as we shall discourse of this, and other
matters more appertaining to women.

In like manner also concerning the worms, because that they do infect and
frequent more the bowels than the stomach, and are thence expelled: therefore
we will discourse of them in the description of the bowels.

The twelfth Chapter. Of the Liver.
ALbeit now the Liver have the seat in the third part of man's body, fast under
the Midriffe or Diaphragma, about the stomach, for which cause we continuing
our method, ought to have written thereof before the stomach: yet we have
declared sufficient causes in the beginning of the tenth Chapter, and showed
for what cause it has not yet been effected. This most noble member whereof we
are now to discourse, which we call the Liver, the Grecians Hepar, and the
Latinists Iecur, has her situation (as is said) on the one side of the
stomach, which it touches in a wonderful (and yet nevertheless in a
natural) manner, with five branches, like as it were five fingers, wherewith
she stretches also a little toward the left side, and is also by nature one of
the most needful and worthiest members which is given for the nourishment and
sustayning of man's body, therefore are all beasts that do blow endued with it.
This great and excellent gift have the heathen people also acknowledged: but
they shamefully and infidelly abuse this wonderful creature of God in their
sacrifices: in which amongst other the entrails they behold the Liver
especially, supposing thereby to learn and understand things for to come, even
as they, whether it be through natural causes, illusions of the devil, (or
through the leasings of their sacrificing priests) have published and made
known many kinds of wonderful things. The substance of the Liver is compacted
flesh, of a red color, not much unlike to congealed blood, full of veins and
arteries, and is of a warm and moist complexion, like as is also the blood.
Also of her self she is without sense or feeling, like to half a circle, and
in man (in regard of the whole body) she is much bigger then in beasts, and
especially in such as banquet every day, and make good cheer, or be fleshy by
nature. The Liver is the beginning and the seat of all lusts, a fountain of
all the veins, the kitchen of all the blood, which she afterward in most
wonderful manner does spread abroad, and impart throughout the whole body,
whereby all the members be nourished, sustained and strengthened. This her
admirable operation is not amiss to be compared with must, which has his
lees, that setleth it self in the bottom: Also there is then some light with
it which ascends, that we do call the flower of the wine: Lastly, there is
somewhat more which vaporeth out within the year, which is waterish. Even so
fares it with the Liver, which draws first all manner of mixed moisture unto
her, and the greatest and the muddiest: to wit, Melancholia sends he toward
the Milt or Spleen: that which is light, hot, and fiery, as Cholera is,
draws to the Gall: the excessive waterish moisture which remains still in
the rest of the body, and all that is not meet for the blood, that do the
Raynes draw to them, from whence the same comes into the Bladder, and is
afterward voyded out for urine.

This excellent member is (like as the whole body of man) subject to diverse
diseases: amongst which, the most principal are these, namely, when the
arteries and veins be obstructed, whereof then be caused all kind of
sicknesses, as inflammations, schirrosities, lasks, or bloody flixes, diseases
of the Kidneies, and of the conduits of the urine, thirst, yellow Iaundies, and
lastly, diverse sorts of Dropsies, whereof we will speak more at large
hereafter.

Of the infections of the Liver in general.. 1.
FIrst, all men that have any infection of the Liver, are called Hepatici,
notwithstanding that some do make somewhat else of it, and it is described
thus: Hepaticus has his continual pain about the place of the Liver, with
swelling, and hardness. The face loses his natural color: there is also an
Ague, and thirst with it, with drouth of the tongue and the mouth. But this is
to be thought again upon, that the Liver it self is utterly insensible, and
therefore feels no pain. But this sensiblenes or feeling have the inward and
adjacent Tunicles, and all that belongs unto them: which pain does proceed
through a cold, or hot Liver, or some impostumation, whereof the Physicians
have their proper signs, which we shall declare in their convenient places. But
the common people, yea also the unlearned Physicians do not know so quickly the
sickness of the Liver, and that because of her manifold accidents and
Symptomata, which be incident unto it, whereof we will describe the most
needful, with all their necessary remedies.

Of the obstruction of the Liver in general.. 2.
FOrasmuch as the common causes of the obstruction of the Liver (like as is
already discoursed) are in the veins and arteries, and that as well through
heat, as through cold: therefore will we first of all make some declaration in
general of this oppilation, before that we come to the principal. This
obstruction or oppilation is thus described: Oppilatio is an obstruction, and
such a disease, as hinders the blood, and other humors, that should have their
passage and course through the veins, which may be provoked through these
causes following in the Liver: to wit, if a body do gird himself too hard,
and has his clothes too straight about the Liver. Item, through fallings,
through thrustings, and such like, through use of gross meats, as Porke,
Beef, Cheese, unleavened bread, boiled seeds, as Rice, Wheat, etc. All manner
of Pap, and other oppilating Pottages. Item, through outward cold, through
inward tough slime and gross blood, which happens to lie before the orifices
of the veins, through wind, impostumes, and through other diseases more of the
Liver. The common signs next after the forementioned, are these: that always
his excrements or ordure is very thin and watrish, the urine also shows thin,
clear, and yellowish. Also there is pain in his right side, and he feels a
debilitie in the whole body, which may best be known when one must ascend
stairs or hills, and that then the breath is very short, with other signs more
whereof we shall admonish where we shall write of the impostume of the Liver.
Albeit that we shall hereafter make mention of the order of diet in a hot or
cold Liver, and that we here but in general do write of the disease of the
Liver, yet will we here notwithstanding briefly rehearse this rule.

To wit, that all they that have any obstruction in the Liver, are not to eat
any thing but light meats, as young Mutton, Hens, and such like, which is
often showed before, and shall be hereafter showed again. Also all their meat
is to be dressed with Parsley roots, and herbs. They are also to use much Pease
porredge. And if this disease proceed of a cold cause, then are you to add
Parsley, Fennel, Southernwood, Sperage, or Capers. His meat must be boiled
rather then roasted. Also he must beware of all gross meats, old flesh, great
fishes, and of all fishes which have no shells. He is to use no bathes,
plasters, nor any thing else until the second digestion be past. All strong
motions or exercises immediately after meat must he eschew. And although he
were very thirsty, yet must he forbear as much as is possible, and chiefly
from drinking of Wine; howbeit nevertheless a clear white and well savoring
Wine is in some sort permitted. This may suffice at this present.

The causes of a hot Liver are many, as namely, the hot time, great labor in
the heat of the Sun, and especially without drinking, excessive Venerie,
application to hot medicines, suffocation of the mother or womb, continual
use of all hot meats, as Spices, or Wine made with Spices.

These are now the signs of a hot Liver, to wit, a red and yellow urine,
yellow ordure, great thirst, loathing of meat, and a swift pulse. All cold
things are acceptable to the patient, and warm things be noisome. He is much
inclined to vomiting, and that which he parbraketh is lead colored, and
sometimes yellow and green. Also the heat of the Liver may be felt with the
hand. They which be of hot nature, and young withal, and in a hot time of
the year, are most subject to this disease. And when to this heat there
comes drought, that the mouth and the tongue be dry, then is it well to be
seen that this disease proceeds of an unnatural heat, whereby there
follows forthwith Obstrutions, Impostumes, Exulcerations, Tumors,
schirrosities of the Liver, and such like diseases.

Of the oppilation or obstruction of the Liver through heat.. 3.
FOr this obstruction of the Liver these simples are good: amongst which
notwithstanding some be moderately warm, but they can thereby do no hurt,
because that they be forcibly deoppilate. They may be mixed with other things,
viz. with tame and wild Endive, small Endive, Priests crown, Lyuerwort, Melon
seed, Pompeon seed, Gourd seed, Cucumber seed, and Lettice seed, seeds of
Purslaine, of Endive and small Endive, water of the roots and herb of
Cicorie, Sorrel, Cicorie, Burrage, Venus hair, small Houseleeke, Hearts tongue
and field Cypers: of all which, one may prepare what he will. Item, the sirupe
of vinegar drunken with Endive water. In like manner may be given to the sick
person to drink Barley water, the juice of cooling herbs, as of Endive,
Nightshade and Cuscuta, with the sirupe of Sorrel and Sugar: for that these
things do open the obstructed Liver, and cool the same. You may also use for
this purpose these things ensuing: Take Oxysacchara, and sirupe of Violets, of
each three ounces, sirupe of Endive twelve ounces, temper them together, and if
you think that the choler is tough and thick, then temper amongst it one
ounce of vinegar, and use thereof as often as you please each time one ounce and
a half, with some of the foresaid waters. Or take the sirupe of vinegar, the
sirupe of Endive, of each six ounces, and temper them together. If the body be
sore bound, then put thereto one ounce of the sirupe of Violets. Or if you
think that the Cholera be burnt, then put the juice of Burrage and of
Fumitorie unto it.

And if there be any Ague with it (as it commonly does happen) then is this
obstruction not only commodious, but also most necessary, that the bad
cholerike humors may the easier be expelled: for which these things following
are very meet, viz. the sirupe of Diarrhodon, de Byzantijs, de Radicibus, de
Cichorea, taken with the distilled waters meet for them, to wit, water of
Venus hair, of Hearts tongue, of Agrimony, of Wormwood, of Endive, of Cicorie,
or with the waters wherein the foresaid herbs are decocted.

Item, Cassie with Hiera Picra, Electuarium lenitiuum, Rhabarbarum, Agaricus,
sirupe of Roses laxatiue, Pillulae de Rhabarbaro.

But seriously to take in hand this matter, it is above all works needful to
purge, which is thus to be effected.

Take the flowers of Burrage, of Buglosse, Violets, Currants, and Endive seeds,
of each half an ounce, boil them together as behooves: of this decoction take
three or four ounces, and temper therein three dragmes of Cassie, sower Dates
five dragmes, beaten Rubarbe one dragme: these being tempered, take them in the
morning early. Sower Dates are especial good for this, because they cleanse
the hot Liver, and also cool it. Or take the flowers of Violets, of Burrage,
Prunes, and sower Dates, of each half an ounce, Spicanardi one scruple: let
them sees together in sufficient water. Then take three or four ounces of
this decoction, and temper amongst it one ounce of Cassie, and one dragme of
Rubarbe steeped in Endive water: make a drink of it. If so be that the sick
person be meetely strong, then in stead of the Rubarbe you may temper with it
three or four dragmes of the confection Succo Rosarum.

Another: Take sirupe of Violets half an ounce, Barley water three ounces,
Rubarbe one dragme steeped in a little Endive water, Spica three dragmes,
confection de Succo Rosarum, one quarter of an ounce: temper them together, and
give it him in the morning betimes. If the humor be gross, then take in the
stead of the Rubarbe, Agaricus and Rubarbe, of each half a dragme: for the
Agaricus has an especial operation in the opening of the obstruction of the
Liver.

For this is also requisite diverse Sirrupes, which be daily used at most
Apothecaries, and also described in this book: to wit, above all other, both
sorts of Oximel, the Oximell of Squils, sirrupe of Endive, of Barberies, their
confections, and all that is made of it, Oxysacchara, sirrupe of Violets, and
of Ribes, and principally if there be tempered with Roses, burnt Iuorie, and
Saunders.

Item, take sirrupe De Bizantijs two ounces, Honey of Roses one ounce, water of
Endive, Fennel, and of Wormewoode, of each two ounces, make a Iulep of it to
take at two several times. Another: Take Endive water six ounces, water of
Liuerwort three ounces, seeds of Gourdes, Melons, and Cucumbers (slightly
beaten with the pills) of each two dragmes, Venus hair two handfuls, and ten or
twelve winter Cherries: let these sees all together in sufficient water,
until that a third part be decocted, and in seething put one quarter of an
ounce of red Saunders; afterward strain it through a cloth, and sees in the
same decoction three ounces of Sugar, and then make two Potions of it: they do
cool, cleanse, and strengthen the Liver, the Kidneys, and all the intrailes
marvelous much.

Item, take of a green Gourd, and set it in an Oven when the bread is taken
out: a good while afterward make a hole in the bottom, and receive the water
which shall run out underneath, then put as much Endive water unto it, and make
a Iulep of it as you think meet. The wine of Pomegranates is very good for
this: in like manner also Buttermilke for all diseases of the Liver is highly
commended. Venus hair one ounce and a half or two ounces taken in the morning
and evening, cools, opens, and eases all diseases of the Liver. In the
month of June is the water thereof to be distilled.

Note also, that whereas there is a great heat of the Liver present, there
must one refrain from drinking Wine, and also from all drinks wherein is Honey
admixed. But he is to use all that cools.

Make also this Iulep following. Take the water of Buglosse, Venus hair, and
of Endive, of each nine ounces, the juice of Pomegranates two ounces, white
Sugar four ounces and a half: sees all these together unto a potion. Or take
Iulep of Roses, mix them with Endive water, and clear well water.

Although for great heat we have forbidden Wine, yet nevertheless Cherrie
wine is permitted, because it is of a temperate nature, and does moysten the
Liver, and also cools, and therefore these patients are to have otherwhiles
at their desire a draught of it. This confection following is also to be used,
to wit, Triasantali Diarrhodon without spices, conserve of Roses, of Violets,
preserved S. John's Grapes, or Ribes, Barberies, and Peaches preserved, the
conserve of water Lillies does also cool much. Also the conserve of Cicorie
with the roots, and preserved Grapes, are good for this purpose.

Or have this confection following prepared: Take peeled Melon seed, Cucumber
seed, Gourd seed, and peeled Pompeon seed, of each three quarters of an
ounce, seeds of Purslaine, of Endive, and Sorrel, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Pine nuts which have been steeped four hours in Rose water one ounce,
Sugar eight ounces, or as much as you please: sees the Sugar with Rose water,
and then make loosinges of them.

Now for to keep an open body, these pills are to be prepared: Take one dragme
of Rubarb, burnt Iuorie one scruple, make nine pills thereof with the sirrupe of
Roses, and take them in together at one time.

Other Pills for the obstruction of the Liver caused through Phlegma, which
falls out of the head into the breast and liver. If you will, let the sick
person take these pills two hours before he go to bed: Take pills De Hiera
Composia two scruples, and let the sick person sit the next day in a bath of
water.

Take also sometimes one dragme of these Trociscis following, to wit, De
Berberis, De Camphora, De spo^^to, and De Sandalis with water of Endive, and
make pills thereof.

We will also here repeat those things which are to be used outwardly: Take
Roses, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Camfere half a dragme,
beat them all to powder, Vinegar four ounces or more: temper this together,
and wet a cloth therein, and lay it upon the Liver: when it is dry, then make
it moist again in the same.

Or take the juice of Nightshade and Endive water, of each three ounces, Rose
water one ounce and a half, Vinegar one ounce, red and white Saunders, and the
seeds of Citrons beaten, of each one dragme tempered, and used as beforesayd.

Item, take one quarter of an ounce of strong wine, four ounces of Nightshade,
water one ounce and a half, Saffron five greynes: mingle them well together,
and then lay it with a cloth over the whole Liver. Another: Take Endive water
six ounces, Rose water and Nightshade water, of each three ounces, water of
Wormwood two ounces, the juice of Lettice and of Calmus, of each one ounce and
a half, red and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Camfere one scruple:
temper them well, and then apply it unto it.

Another, which is yet stronger: Take water of Endive, and of Sorrel, of each
six ounces, water of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each four ounces, Species de
gemmis Frigidis three dragmes, Diarrhodon, Triasantalon, of each one dragme and
a half, red Coral half a dragme, Camfere one scruple; temper them and use
them as the other.

Or take Roses, red and white Saunders, Wormwood, Squinant, burnt Iuorie, and
Spica, of each a like much; beat them all to powder: when as you will use it,
then temper half an ounce with Sorrel and Endive waters, of each four
ounces. Item, take the water of Nightshade, of Endive, of Liuerwoort, of
Sorrel, and of Wormwood, of each four ounces, Species Triasantali,
Diarrhodon, burnt Iuory, of each half a dragme, Saffron one dragme, Vinegar
two ounces; temper them, and use them as the other.

Another which is temperate: Take water of Buglosse, of Cicory, of Balm, of
each six ounces, Spec. de gemmis temperatis one dragme, Saffron one scruple,
Vinegar one ounce, Malmsey three ounces; temper them all together. But it is to
be noted that these cooling things must be used with discretion, that they do
not cool the breast too much, and provoke a Cough: the which might easily be
procured.

Here follow now plasters and such like.
TAke Barley meal three ounces, Roses one dragme, white Poppy seed half a
dragme, the juice of Wormwood and of Nightshade, of each one ounce and a
half, Vinegar half an ounce; make pap thereof with the oil of Roses.

Or take white Poppy seed one ounce and a half, the juice of Wormwood three
ounces, the juice of Nightshade six ounces, Vinegar one ounce, and Barley meal
as much as suffices.

This plaster is also highly commended: Take dried Violets three quarters of
an ounce, Roses two dragmes and a half, Spica and Masticke, of each one dragme
and a half, Cammomill, Venus hair, Barley meal, Hollihocke roots, of each
ten ounces, Squinant, Cipers roots, and Calmus, of each one dragme: make a pap
thereof with well water, and lay it every day over the Liver.

The common plaster of Saunders, which is to be found at the Apothecaries, is
also very good for this use.

For a salve: Take oil of Roses, of water Lillies, and Spica, of each half an
ounce; Roses, burnt Iuory of each half an ounce, red and white Saunders, seeds
of Plantaine and of Purslain, of each one dragme, Spica, Agrimony, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Masticke two scruples, Wax as much as is needful for to
make a salve of it. Item, take oil of Roses two ounces, oil of Violets and of
Spica, of each one ounce, Vinegar half an ounce, Roses, burnt Iuory, Squinant,
red and white Saunders, of each half a dragme, Camfere two scruples: then make
a salve of it with molten Wax.

The Saunders salve described before in the sixth Chapter, and first. Also the
cooling ointment, and that of Roses, are marvelous good for this disease.

Yet another: Take the oil of bitter Almonds, and white wine, of each a like
quantity, steep Cicorie in it, Wormwood, Cammomill and Agrimonie, and chafe
it warm upon the place of the Liver.

Another which is very forcible. Take the salve of Saunders, and the cooling
ointment Galeni, of each one ounce and a half, oil of Roses one ounce. If it
be too soft, then make it as hard as you will with Wax.

It is also necessary to observe therein an order of diet. If with this heat
of the Liver there be an Ague, then is he to be kept as one that has an ague,
and that according to the importance of the cause; like as may be discerned in
the sixth part. Generally, Lettice, Purslaine, Veriuice and Cucumbers are very
good for him, with Vinegar, and other meats more that may be dressed with them.
And although the inflammation were without an Ague (and yet there be some dry
itch and scabs with it) then be the foresaid herbs very wholesome for him. In
like manner also Pullets, Hens, Partridges, small birds, Kids, Mutton and Veale
dressed with Vinegar, Veriuice, Orenges or Limons, Barley pap and Oaten pap are
also very fit for his meat. The Vineyard Snailes are also very good for them.
The fishes that be taken in clear grauel waters, dressed with Parsley and
vinegar, may he very well eat. Melons, Almonds, Peaches, stued Pears and
Apples, Cherries, Strawberries and Raisons, a little of each eaten are also
very good. Wine is altogether repugnant to this disease: yet being well
watered, or Cherrie wine may he drink in some respects moderately. Also all
gross meats are very hurtful for him; as unleavened bread, gross flesh,
Cheese, Milk, Starch, Rice, and in fine all that binds is hurtful for the
liver. But Buttermilke is not ill for this malady.

Of the obstruction in the Liver through cold.. 4.
IF so be that the oppilation of the Liver be caused through cold, then is the
whole body bleake and lead colored, and chiefly the face; the tongue, the
lips, and the urine is not colored: the pulse is slow, there is little
thirst, slow digesture, lead colored and white excrements that stink not
much. All warm things are very meet for the patient: but cold things are
utterly against him; first, if this obstruction be without an Ague: but in case
that it continue long, then must an Ague ensue by reason that the blood
putrifieth in the Liver. But if there be any humors with this cold, that is to
be perceived by the thick water: also by the moisture and thinness of the
ordure, and by the small thirst, slow pulse, by the swelling of the eyes and of
the face, softnes of the flesh, and loathsome color, whereby they do come
quickly to the yellow Iaundies or Dropsy. With this comes also oftentimes a
laske or scouring, swelling of the eyelids, of the fingers, of the toes, and
all outward members. If so be then that these signs chance to be or may be
perceived, then may easily be adjudged that this malady does proceed through
cold causes. The patient is for this, above all other things, to be purged, and
the flegmaticke matter is to be expelled: for which this preparatiue sirupe
ensuing is to be used: Take the roots of Parslie and of Fennel one ounce and
a half, the roots of Smallage one ounce, Agrimonie, Venus hair, and Hearts
tongue, of each one handful, Mace, Cuscuta, of each two ounces, Licorice,
Currants, of each one ounce, white Vinegar one ounce, Honey, Sugar, of each six
ounces; make a sirupe of them until there do remain about fifteen ounces,
and clarify it. For this is also good the sirupe of Eupatorio, of Acetosa,
Diarrhodon, de Bizantijs, and Acetosus Compositus. Item, take Fennel roots,
the roots of Parsley, of Smallage, Sperage, and Butchers broom, of each half
an ounce, Agrimonie one ounce, Annis, Fennel, Cuscuta, of each three dragmes,
Hearts tongue, Venus hair, herb Bennet, of each a handful, Vinegar one ounce,
Sugar as much as you will; and make a sirupe of them. And of one of ye foresaid
sirupes you are to use certain days one after another, every day two ounces
at once. This being effected, then the patient to be purged with this purgation
following: Take flowers of Burrage and of Buglosse, of each one ounce and a
half, Spica one scruple, Agaricus and Polypody roots, of each half a dragme:
let them sees together, and put unto it one dragme of Turbith. You are to give
him about four ounces of this decoction.

Or take Pillulas de Agarico, or such like, which purge the phlegm. When the
patient is well purged, the^ is he to use some of these Trocisks following
dissolved in water of Wormwood; to wit, de Rhabarbaro, de Absinthio, and de
Eupatorio. Amongst the Confections these are good: Diacostu, Diacalamintha,
Dianisum, Diacyminum, Aromaticum rosatum, Diagalanga, Dialacca, and such like.
Item, take Pistacia two ounces; steep the^ two days in warm water of
Agrimony, chop them afterward small, and sees two ounces of Sugar in two
ounces of Agrimonie water which is meetely thick. Then temper the Cuscuta, and
half an ounce of Cinnamom with it; whereof make losinges: the^ take thereof
morning and evening at least one quarter of an ounce. Hereafter now follow
confections and other things which one may eat. Take one pound of well washed
Currants; when they be dried meetely well, then temper therewith one ounce of
beaten Rubarb, and eat thereof when you will, a good sponfull at each time, and
then keep it close stopped. This is very good for all diseases of the Liver, and
chiefly to prevent the yellow Iaundies.

Another Confection. Take the muscilage of Hollihock roots 12. ounces
clarified Honey 12. ounces, Licorice 9. dragmes, Betony and Balm, of each three
drag. Cuscuta, rinds of Tamariske, of each half an ounce, Annis, Couchenel, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one drag. prepared steel two ounces and a
half, and one dragme of the muscilage of Hollihock roots, and you must sees
the Honey to the thickness of Honey: then temper the rest amongst it, and use it
after you have well stirred your self, walked, or run. Annis seeds confected
be good for cold obstructions, and all old disease of the Liver. Item, Comin
and Caruway have great power to heat a frozen Liver, and to open all her
obstructions. Also bitter Almonds confected or otherwise. Likewise, Elecampane
roots, Calmus, Eringus, Nutmegs, Walnuts, all of them confected. Item conserve
of Eiebright, of Fumitory, of Elderne flowers, Hyssope, Betony, Lauender,
Marierom and Sage are altogether very requisite. To all which you may ad Miua
Cidoniorum, both Treacles; to wit, the great Diatessaron, and Mithridate, are
very commodious for this disease.

For the obstruction of the cold in the Liver be these pills following very
good, and especially if there be fear of the dropsy: Take Indy Spica 2.
dragmes and a half, Spica Romana one drag. Rubarb, Agaricus and Ameos, of each
one drag. and a half, Cinnamom, Cloves, and Squinant, of each half a drag.
Aloe 5. drag. make pills thereof with old wine, and use thereof as often as you
will, one drag. at once. For this obstruction are these things following
especial good: Take Couchenele beaten half a drag. make three pills thereof
with the juice of Limons; then take them fasting, as you please. Some advise
that there must be tempered amongst it the herb Centorie, and then make pills
of it with the juice of Agrimonie.

Potions and such like.
WIne is for this cold obstruction of the Liver, as in that of heat, not
forbidden. For there be sundry wines of herbs ordained for the same, viz. wine
of Eiebright, of Auence, of Betony, of Hearts tongue, Marierom, wormwood,
Hyssope, and Asarabacca, and such like, which be described in the last part.

But if it be needful that the wine must be tempered; then prepare a water
wherein Annis, Cinamom, Coriander, Fennel roots, or any of these were
decocted, you may also sees Mallows and Cuscuta in wine, and sometimes drink
thereof.

Of spiced wines are some described before and hereafter, which do serve for
the Liver very well. For which be highly commended Cleretum, Aromatites, and
wine of Zeduary.

Besides the foresaid sirupes may these ensuing be used; to wit, the sirupe of
Fumitory, of Wormwood and Mints. And if so be that the Phlegma be very tough,
then all the Oxymels are fit for it, used with water meet for the purpose.

Of the outward Applications.
TAke Agrimonie two handfuls, Cammomill and Venus hair, of each half a
handful, Cipers roots, Masticke, Squinant, Spica, of each one dragme, red and
white Saunders, Calmus and Wormwood, of each two scruples, burnt Iuory one
scruple, muscilage of Hollikocke roots three ounces, oil of Masticke, Spica,
and Barley meal, of each one ounce, and also a little Vinegar: then make a
plaster of it with the decoction of Agrimonie.

The foresaid plaster is good for all hot and cold tumors of the Liver, and
to be used at all times, the plaster of Melilot, the plaster of Bay berries,
and the known gray plaster Diachilon, are all very good for th is
Schirrosity of the stomach, of the Milt and Liver. Item, take Roses five drag.
Wormwood half an ounce, Masticke five dragmes, Indie Spica two dragmes and a
half, Wax one ounce, oil of Roses four ounces and a half: afterward melt
the Wax and oil, and wash it with water: lastly, temper all other things
beaten amongst it. This plaster strengthens, opens the obstructions of the
Liver and the stomach, swageth the pain which proceeds of cold, makes
appetite, and assisteth the digestion.

These oils following are also marvelous good against all Oppilations of the
Liver; to wit, the oil of Elder, of Bay, of Spike, and of Wormwood, tempered,
or each alone, anointed upon the place of the Liver.

It happens also very well, that through the obstruction of the Liver, the
intrailes are annoyed. For which, you are to take the right sealed earth and
temper it with Annis or Fennel, Spica of Indy, with Cinnamom, of each a like
quantity, as the cause requires: use half a drag. of it at once with wine.
But of this shall be written more at large where we shall discourse of the guts.

In general, Oxymel is good for all oppilations of the liver (if there be any
sharpness of the urine with it) amongst which, some expert Physicians do
temper these things following, which do take away the sharpness of the Urine:
as Annis, wild yellow Mustard seed, Silver mountain, Mallows, Hollihocks,
Fleawort, Dragagant, and such like: whereof we shall speak hereafter, to wit,
in this third Part.

The order of Diet.
BEsides all the foresaid remedies, it is necessary that we do also write what
diet this patient is to observe. First of all, whatsoever cools and
moisteneth is to be eschewed; to wit, all habitations which lie low by the
water: also the South wind. All that here ensues is hurtful for him: as
Spinach, Beetes, Lettice, Purslaine, Endive, Gourds, Cucumbers, and Pompeons,
as also all that is made of dough. Fish also is not good for him, unless it
were seldom used. All slimy parts of beasts is he also to forbear, as fat
Trypes, etc. unleavened bread, fresh fruits, and all pottages. Notwithstanding,
Pease pottage, and broth of Lentils made with Mints, Parsley, Spike, and
Galingall be special good. He must also refrain from drinking water, if it be
not tempered with wine. Also all gross wine is naught for him. Butter and
swines suet is also not much commended. But Sallet oil is in some respects
permitted. Item, all kind of milk, and all that is boiled with it, gross old
flesh, and all that binds, is also forbidden.

For his drink he is to use meetely strong wine, which is clear and of a good
taste, and is somewhat sweet. He may also use otherwhiles good warming
aromaticall wine, like as we have showed of late. Vinegar, Veriuice, Limons and
Orenges must he use with other meats, but always a little, and rather these:
The Pomegranates, Cinnamom, Pepper, Ginger, Galingall, Annis seed, Comin,
Fennel, and such like odoriferous things are very meet for him. In like
manner also the herbs and roots of Parsley, Hyssope, Thyme, Marierom, field
Mints, Southernwood, Sage, Basil, Costus roots, yellow Rapes and all other
Turnips dressed with oil he is to use. In like sort Olives and Capers. Of all
flesh, Hens, Pullets, Doves, Partridges, Fesants, field fowls, and sucking
Kids, be very good to be eaten: for they may all be dressed with spice; and
especial good to be dressed with all meats be Parsley and wild Turnips. Some do
commend much for this sickness the Vineyard Snailes, and of all fruits, the
bitter and sweet Almonds, Pistacia and Currants.

Of a schirrous Liver.. 5.
OF this obstruction of the Liver, it does otherwhiles wax schirrous and hard,
that one may feel the same with the hand on the out side, without any great
trouble to the Liver: the which malady the learned do call Scirrum, and the
Greeks Schroten.

This disease is not to be cured but at the first, for when it is waxed old,
then it is too late. These patients do some dye suddenly, and some lingringly;
for the Liver cannot tolerate so strong medicines as the Milt. This disease is
to be remedied, as here ensues.

This sick person is always every second day to take one scruple of
Ammoniacum, with Oxymel, made into pills. If it shall be needful, his liver
vein is to be opened, and afterward he is to purge with Manna and Rubarb
tempered with Agrimonie water: Wormwood water is also good. He is certain
days afterward to take one dragme of prepared Wolfs liver tempered in four
ounces of Agrimony water, and to use this certain days one after another. It
is also good advise, that this sick person do use things which do provoke much
urine, and do break the stone in the Bladder, whereof shall good instructions
be found in his proper place. For it is consonant to reason, that such things
will also resolve and deobstruat the hardness of the Liver. Also he is to
drink daily a dragme of the seed of Agnus Castus, tempered with Comin, and
Fennel water.

Outwardly be the forementioned plasters, and especially the plaster de
Meliloto and Diachilon to be applied upon it. Also you may make (if you will) a
plaster of these things following: Take Cammomill one ounce, Roses, marrow of
Ox bones, or of Hearts bones, Ducks grease, Hens grease, and oil of Spike, of
each half an ounce, beaten Wormwood three drag. Fenegreeke, and Linseede
meal, of each one ounce, sweet Costus roots three dragmes, and Wax as much
as suffices. Or sees Figs and Raisons, poune them to grout, and temper
amongst it Fenegreeke meal, beaten Cammomill, Rue and Melilot: afterward
mingle it with the oil of Cammomill, as much as will suffice for a salve.

Item, take Barley meal two ounces, Cammomil and Melilot, of each half a
handful, the muscilage of Hollihock roots five ounces, Cypers roots,
Squinant, Mastick, and Spica, of each one quarter of an ounce, red Saunders,
Calmus, Agrimonie and Wormwood, of each two scruples, burnt Iuorie one
scruple, Saffron half a scruple, Vinegar half an ounce, oil of Roses one
ounce, four or five dry Figs, oil of Wormwood and of Spike, of each one
quarter of an ounce, make a plaster thereof. Some have taken the venomous
herb Hemlock, and laid it as pap upon the Liver: for it does mollify
schirrositie and hardness.

By this is also to be understood, that all which is good for the obstruction
of the Liver, is also very meet for this disease.

Of a cold Liver without obstruction.. 6.
THere befall also cold diseases in the Liver without any obstruction of the
same, yet are all the forementioned remedies very good for this intent, by
reason that they do all heat the Liver and other inward parts: but these
Plasters, Salues, and other things ensuing, are especially ordained for this.

Take Mastick, Spica, Cypers roots, Squinant, Calmus, Saffron and Mirrhe, but
the Mastick and Mirrhe are to be dissolved in Wine, then temper the rest
amongst it unto a plaster, and lay it upon the Liver. Item, take the juice of
Agrimonie twelve ounces, Vinegar one ounce, Spike and Cinnamome, of each one
dragme and a half: wet a cloth in it, and lay it also over the Liver. You may
also put unto it four ounces of Wormwood water. Or take oil of Quinces, oil
of Mastick half an ounce, oil of Spike one ounce, burnt Iuorie, Roses,
Squinant, Cuscuta, Cinnamome and Spike, of each half a dragme, Saffron five
greynes, and Wax as much as is needful. Lastly, stir a little Vinegar
amongst it, and with this salve annoint round about and upon the Liver twice or
thrice a day, that is, upon the right side, even to the ribs.

Another: Take oil of Roses half an ounce, oil of Wormwood and of Spike, of
each one ounce, red and white Saunders, burnt Iuorie, Squinant and Comin, of
each half a dragme, Cinnamome one dragme, Agrimonie and Calmus, of each two
scruples, Masticke, and Indie Spica, of each one scruple, Saffron half a
scruple, Vinegar one spoonful, Wax as much as is needful for a salve.

But if so be that there do remain any pain, then may you use these things
following: take Wheate^ bread which is well boulted, put it into a bag, and so
lay it warm upon the liver. But if the pain will not be as yet assuaged with
it, then take two parts of Milet, and three parts of Bran, and one part of
Salt: make them together warm, and use it as aforesaid: Or set a great boxing
cup upon the same place.

Item: Take Cammomill, Balm, Dill seed, and Annis seed, of each two
handfuls, Mace, Fennel, Mallows, Hollihocke seeds, of each half a handful,
and two or three Poppie heads; Sees all these together in a good deal of
water until the third part be decocted, and fill a great bladder or twain
with this decoction, and lay it on the place of the pain; and when one is
cold, then lay another.

Lastly: Take four ounces of Brand, Venus hair, Dill seed, Burrage seed,
and Comin, of each half an ounce, Cammomill and Melilot, of each three
handfuls; Sees them al together in white wine, then poune them to grout, and
temper therewith one ounce and a half of Barley meal, oil of Cammomill two
ounces; then make a plaster of it, and lay it warm upon it: it is very good
to assuage and delay the pain.

Of the impostumation of the Liver.. 7.
THe Liver may be also annoyed through many kinds of impostumes inwardly or
outwardly, which be engendered of many causes; as through falls, thrusts, or by
going too narrow girt, whereby all such issues and impostumes are caused. Also
these impostumes may be well caused through some choleric humor, and through
an ouerhot stomach, through the use of too much spices, or any other hot
meats, whereby the digestion of the stomach is infeebled and wholly spoiled.
For this is especial good all sweet things, as Honey, Sugar, Figs, etc.

But if this moisture be through cold, then does there come a clean contrary
cause.

The commonest signs of all the impostumes of the Liver be these; pain in the
right side tending upwards toward the ribs and shoulder blade, as it were the
Pleurifie. The sick person can hardly lie upon his sides, and especially on
the right side: his face is very black, he leeseth appetite his vrin is
bloud-red, especially if the impostume be hot: otherwhiles the cough comes
with it, as also the hickcough, parbraking, short breath, retention of urine,
and great thirst.

Now for to the cure these impostumes, we will first discourse of them that
come through heat: for this is first, the liver vein to be opened (if the
patient be able) and to let out much blood: but if the party be weak, then
but a little, and then the oftener.

If so be that he be hard bound, then be gentle clisters to be ministered, and
this thing ensuing to be laid upon the liver. Take red Saunders, and Roses, of
each three dragmes, the juice of Endive, and Nightshade, of each two ounces,
Rose water one ounce, Vinegar half an ounce; make them together luke warm,
and then wet clothes therein and apply them upon the liver, and renew them once
every three or four hours, and continue this three or four days. This
sirupe following is also to be prepared, which is as well good for the ague, as
for to open and loose the body: Take the juice of small Endive, of great
endive, of Agrimonie, Smallage, and Fennel, of each three ounces, water of
Parsley roots, of Smallage and Venus hair, of each two ounces, clear well
water twelve ounces, Sugar eighteen ounces, white vinegar two ounces: Sees
them al together, and clarify them well, then put unto it Squinant, Spike,
burnt Iuorie, Melon seed, Gourd seeds, Cucumber seed, Pompeon seed, and red
Saunders, of each one dragme, Wormwood three dragmes; then make a sirupe of
it, and take at each time two ounces of it with the decoction of Pease, or with
Endive water. The third day after that such impostumes be known, then is the
soft pap to be laid upon it. Take Barley meal, stewed Figs, and Dates beaten to
pap, and tempered all together with oil or Roses and Vinegar.

For this sickness one must not purge at the first without great need be. But
when the sickness is at the prime or declining, then are you to do the same with
Manna, Cassie, sour Dates, and to exhibit it with the decoction of Violets,
Squinant, Prunes, and Wormwood.

In like manner use loosing meat dressed with Burrage, Mallows, Hops, and such
like herbs. But if the impostume be broken out, and that there do come a gentle
laske or scouring, wherewith corruption also auoydeth, then is nature to work.
But in case this scouring get the maistrie, then is the same to be stayed with
the Trociscis de Berberis and de Terrasigillata.

But if these impostumes do come of thrusts, or such like occasions, then open
a vein (as is said already) and lay this plaster following upon it: Take
Myrtle seed, Roses, and Bayberies, of each half an ounce, Calmus, Mirrhe,
Mastick, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron one dragme, oil of Lillies
and Wax as much as is needful; and if you fear any hardness of the Liver,
then use the mollifying things, whereof we have spoken in the 5.. Or make this
following: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Rue, Wormwood, Ireos, Marierom, Calmus,
Hyssop, and Roses, of each one ounce and a half, Endive, Hollyhock roots,
Lineseede, and Fenegreeke, of each one quarter of an ounce: let them boil all
together in wine and water, make a sponge wet in it, and then lay it warm upon
it. Item, in the declination of the sickness is this plaster following to be
used; Take liquid Storax, and Wax, of each one ounce and a quarter, Masticke,
Saffron, Ameos, of each half an ounce, oil of Mastick and of Roses, of each
five dragmes, Wine six ounces: temper, and use it warm: the Barley for his
meat, and the water for his drink, is amongst other cooling things very
necessary meat and drink.

But if so be that these impostumes do proceed of cold, then do they make show
with intumifactions and debilities, they bring also rather heaviness and
oppression with them then pain. For this, take heed of letting blood and
strong Clisters: but mild Clisters may be used, and also mild purgations.
Amongst other is good for these Clisters, Wormwood, Barley, field Mints,
Centorie, or which you will, decocted with a little Coloquint. You may also use
well suppositories for to keep the body soluble, and to draw down the tough
and gross slime.

Prepare also these Trocisks following: Take Roses five dragmes, Barberies
half an ounce, Annis, Smallage seed, Squinant, Cassie wood and Calmus, of
each three dragmes, Mastick, Spike, Cinnamome, Asarabacca, Rubarb, Mather, and
Lacca, of each one dragme: beat them all together, and make fouresquare
Trociskes thereof with the juice of Fennel the weight of a dragme, and give
thereof one in the evening with this potion following.

Take the roots of Smallage, Parsley, and Fennel, of each one ounce, seeds of
Smallage, Annis, Fennel, and Comin, of each half an ounce, Squinant,
Agrimonie, field Cipers, Germander, Mather, Cassy wood, and Balsam wood, of
each one quarter of an ounce, white Vinegar one ounce and a half, Honey threee
ounces: sees them all together in sufficient water, and clarify it as
behooves. Further, anoint the place with oil of Spike, oil of Sesamum, or
oil of the seeds of Manus Christi, and lay this plaster following upon it.

Take the seeds of Smallage, Ameos, Annis, and Cardamome, of each half an
ounce, Squinant, Aloe, of each three dragmes, Spike, Amaranthus, Mastick,
Saffron, and Myrtle seed, of each one dragme and a half, Turpentine, Rosen, of
each three dragmes, Wax as much as will suffice for to make a plaster with:
melt it with a little oil of Spike and of Costus, and then temper the rest
amongst it. But if so be that you will you may take and put unto it Ox dung,
and Goats dung.

When the impostume breaks, that may be perceived if the patient about the
same time fall a shiuering and quaking, with a swouning, and vomiting, and that
blood avoid both through the stool and the urine, then is this plaster
following to be used; and if peradventure the opennes be not yet explete, yet
does it ripen and assuage the pain, and strengthens the Liver.

Take Barley meal, and Fenegreeke meal, of each one ounce, Linseede meal
three dragmes, Mill dust, Elecampane roots, the roots of Smallage and of
Wormwood, of each five dragmes, Cammomill, Melilot, Violets, and Roses, of
each three dragmes, white Lilly roots, Pigeon dung, Spica Romana, of each one
dragme, oil of Cammomill and of Violets, as much as will suffice for to make
therewith a plaster: afterward give him a drink for to cleanse him, decocted
of Barley and Figs, or let him use Mellicraton, which is Meade.

Of the laske of scouring through weakness of the Liver.. 8.
WE have sufficiently written thereof before in the eleventh Chapter, where we
have spoken of all manner sorts of Lasks and bloody Flixes.

Of diverse things which be very commodious for all infections of the Liver.. 9.
HEre before in the 3.. is highly commended the water of Venus hair for all
diseases of the Liver. For this is also good M. Tristanis water, for it does
preserve and cure the Liver from all diseases. Item, take the seed of Endive,
of small Endive, and of Lettice water, of Venus hair, and Liuerwort, red and
white Saunders, of each one dragme, seeds of Melons, of Pompeons, and Gourds,
of each one quarter of an ounce, shaven Iuorie half a dragme, burnt Iuorie one
dragme, roots of Fennel, of Parsley, and Smallage, of each one quarter of an
ounce, roots of Endive three dragmes, and a little Vinegar, Sugar one ounce
and a half: let them sees all together in three pints of water unto the
half. This is especial good for a stuffed Liver which is caused through heat,
and also for the yellow Iaundies.

Many kinds of golden waters and vital waters be also good for this, and
especially for cold causes.

Look also in the first part, the 12. Chapter, and 1. where you have a very
good powder, beginning thus: Take the juice of Wormwood, etc. mix it with
Sugar, and use it ten days together, it helps all maladies of the Milt and
Liver, it preserves also from the yellow Iaundies and Dropsy.

Of the thirst, through drouth and heat of the Liver.. 10.
ALthough the thirst be a common drouth of the inward members, yet
nevertheless it is caused (for the most part) from the Liver, which also
dries away through the heat, or if the body be burdened with any sickness or
Ague, which verily is such an intolerable trouble that it exceeds all other,
like as may be seen by the wretched people that be set on a wheel, who do
more complain of thirst, then of their disioynting and broken bones: which
thirst is thus described.

Thirst, is a desire of cooling and moisture, which is quenched with drinking.
The learned do also make three kinds of differences of the thirst: the first
do they take for the thirst which is gone clean, when one has lost his
thirst, and when he is afraid of drinking.

The second is the diminished thirst, when one drinks seldom.

The third is the spoiled thirst, like as when any body desires out of measure
any unaccustomed and hurtful drink without measure: to wit, if one would
drink puddle water, urine, or such like. This thirst is to be likened unto the
strange lust after meat, which is caused through a bad stomach, which has
been spoken of in his place.

The causes whence this unnatural lust arises are many, as great labor, long
conuersing in the Sun and about the fire, a strong Ague through drinking of
strong wine, through eating of salt and smoke dried flesh, of Fish, Cheese,
Pepper, Ginger, Cloves, and other Spices: sorrow and anger do also extenuate
the body, and increase thirst: the like also do hot venims cause. Item if any
inward parts be over heated (like as has been said before) in the 3.. hereby
the thirst is also provoked: and especially the thirst is the^ great about
measure in the disease of the kidness, which is called Diabetes, and when one
goes overmuch to the stool.

It happens also that some that have had great thirst, would tolerate the
same without drinking, and are fallen into such thirst which could not
afterward be quenched, and have fallen thereby into Phthism, Hecticam, and
other consuming sicknesses.

The same signs and differences of all these causes may be demanded of the
patient himself, or the standers by. The inward causes does every inward part
yield, as the Liver, Heart, Lights, and the Midriffe, sufficiently of it self
to understand.

For this thirst are applied certain common rules, which may be well marked,
First, how that if one have a moist body or stomach, to him is the thirst
profitable; for if he refrain the same, then is the moisture of his body
thereby consumed. Secondly, if the thirst be by reason that one has dronken
overmuch Wine, then is ye thirsty person to endeavor himself to much
sleeping, and that will quench the thirst. Thirdly, a body is thirsty because
he is dry by nature, and then he is to quench his thirst through drinking.
Fourthly, healthful folks that have thirst anights, are to be weaned from
drinking. Fifthly, healthful folks who have thirst anights, are to be weaned
from their drinking anights. Sixthly, if so be that one have gotten an
unnatural thirst through eating overmuch hot meats, he must quench his
thirst by drinking water. Seventhly, the thirst which proceeds of a hot heart
and lights, is to be remedied by taking in of fresh air, or by receipt of any
cooling Leekes called Looch, and through much watching, for that drinking much
water, and sleeping much, cause more harm then good. Eighthly, if the thirst do
come only through drouth of the mouth and the throat, then is he to addict
himself to sleep after reasonable drinking, and to forbear talk. Ninthly,
if any body be a thirst after much purging he must not drink too much, least
that the natural digesture be thereby enfeebled, or that the natural heat be
therewith dissipated and extinguished. Tenthly, all they that have accustomed
to drink much anights, they do in time spoil all the humors of the whole
body, whereby they do fall at the last into Cacochimian, or the Dropsy, if so
be that they do remain long alive.

But now as concerning the particular remedies of the thirst. The most of them
are discovered in all sicknesses that cause thirst. Nevertheless, we cannot here
omit to declare in general all that withstandeth thirst. And we will first
begin with the potions.

Iulep of Roses and of Violets are much used in all heates. Iulep of Roses is
made thus: Take one pound of Rose water, half a pound of white Sugar; sees
them together by a gentle fire, and clarify them with the white of an egg,
until they be as thick as a sirrupe. This Iulep quenches all that is of
flegmatike Agues, of the Pleurisy, and also of all kind of thirst. In the same
manner is the Iulep of Violets to be made, and has the same operation. It is
also good for all rheumes of the breasts, and of the throat, against the cough
and the thirst. Item, take fresh Well water, or decocted Barley water tempered
with Iulep of Roses or Violets, and the like also with the juice of
Pomegranates. The same does likewise quench the thirst very much.

These distilled waters following do also quench the thirst very much: viz. the
water of Endive, of Buglosse, of Sorrel, and such like, wherewith a little
Sugar is decocted.

It is also said that the Cherrie wine is of a temperate nature, therefore does
it quench the thirst in great heat, it cools and moysteneth all the inward
parts. Item, Meade does also quench thirst, like as the same is to be seen in
the last part of this book. If so be that you desire also in quenching of the
thirst, to loose and make soluble, then take three or four ounces of Endive
water, and with this water draw as much Cassia out of the canes as you think
good, and so drink it. It does quench the thirst marvelous much, like as is
also showed sufficiently in the description of Cassia in the Introduction.

These sirrupes following which be here and there described, may also very well
be used for great thirsts: as sirrupes of Violets, of Vinegar, of Citrons, of
sweet and sower Pomegranats, and especially the laxatiue sirupe of Roses. For
hot Agues you may also use the sirupe of Oranges, of Barberies, of Cherries,
of Prunes, and the juice of them all. The same confected, dried, and all that
may be made of them.

There be also many things more ministered against the thirst: as fresh
Cucumbers, Gourdes and Pompeons; the same being eaten or the juice dronken. For
this is also Lettice good, being eaten with vinegar and oil. Item, black
Cherries, S. John's grapes, and Barberies. The confection of Prunes described
before in the eleventh Chapter, 20.. is also good and certain for the thirst.
Item, confected Peaches, conserve of Roses, of Violets, and of water Lillies. A
piece of Sugar dipped in water, and sucked in the mouth asswageth also thirst.
Unripe Grapes chewed and contained in the mouth do the same. Likewise, sour
Grapes held long in the mouth, do quench thirst also. Or, if the same be bruised
into ones drink: like as is more amplyer admonished in the beginning of this
Book.

Of the yellow Iaundies, a sickness of the Liver.. 11.
THis sickensse is called of the Grecians, and of all learned for the most
part, Icteros, and in Latin Morbus regius, Arquatus, Aurigo, Suffusio fellis,
and of many Icteria. This is such a sickness, whereby that the Cholera or Gall
does spread it self very yellow over all the body, and appears with other
spots or stains. Therqfore is this first to be noted, that there be three
kinds of Icters, or Iaundies, the yellow, the green, and the black. The
yellow is caused through yellow Cholera, the green out of light green
Cholera, and both proceed from the Liver; but the black is caused through
black melancholic blood of some disease of the Milt: albeit the same may also
be caused of the Liver. The causes of these sicknesses are taken to be sundry,
and especially of the yellow and green Iaundies, as of the hot season, by
great labor or great exercise, great heat, biting of venomous beasts, the use
of much heat, sweet and fat meats, and inward impostumes. Al which causes do
so obstruct the Liver, that such matter (like as behooves) cannot be conveyed
into the follicle of the Gall whereby it is inflamed: which the obstruction and
heat may and does come to pass in the veins and in all parts of the body
whereby the blood is spoiled and converted into a green or yellow color. The
cause of the black Isteria, is an obstruction in the Conduits of the Liver to
the Milt, or in the conduits of the milt to the stomach, a feebleness of the
expulsive or attractiue virtue be it of the milt or the liver. Item, through
the use of much melancholicke meat. In fine, it may also be caused through
great heat of the whole body which enflameth the blood, or through great cold
that does congeale the blood, and makes it black.

The first two signs are abating of the lively color, yellowness in the
white of the eyes, and over the whole body and of the urine, the pulse is
feeble, the patient thirsty, leeseth appetite, his meats will be bitter, and
ready to vomit. Item, if the patient be also young, choleric of nature, has
done great labor, and eaten much hot meat, then do they altogether confirm
that it is a perfect Icteritia. The black Icteritia is to be known by her
black spots. The Milt is commonly hard. This sickness is then short beneath. The
urine is brown, ruddy, and a slime in the bottom. The sick person is always
heavy and fearful without cause, like as all melancholicke persons are wont
to be. Thus then to speak briefly of this yellow Iaundies; they do always
come with heat and with an Ague, or also without any of them both, therefore
we will first speak of the hot Iaundies.

Item first of all, if so be that there be an Ague with this sickness, then is
the sick person to drink Barley water with the juice of Lettice and of
Nightshade, for it cools unnatural heat, whereby the yellow Iaundies is
caused. There be also al kind of cooling herbs to be given him to eat, as
Endive, Lettice, Sorrel, etc. dressed with Veriuice or Pomegranat wine. His
drink must be well watered, thin wine, or common small beer. Heed must also
be taken at the first whether it be not needful to purge the party, and if
need require, then is the same to be done in this manner ensuing: Take Cuscuta
and Hoarehound, of each one handful. Endive water twelve ounces, and as much
white Rhenish wine; let them sees together until two parts remain, then
wring it out and take four ounces of it: temper one ounce of the sirrupe de
Bizantijs with it, you may put Sugar to it if you will, and drink three or
four mornings thereof one after another.

Another, which is more forcible: Take Horehound, Cuscuta, of each two
handfuls, Endive water half a pint, Wine one pint, let them sees together,
and hang two dragmes of Rubarb in it, wring it often out, then take four
ounces of it, and temper therewith one of these siirupes following, Syrupum de
Bizantijs, de Duabus Radicibus, or Oxymel one ounce, and use them as is before
said. For to purge you may after the said potions use these cooling medicines:
Take common conserues of Prunes and Cassie, of each three dragmes, confection
of Psyllio two dragmes and one scruple. De Succo Rosarum one dragme and a
half, temper them together with three ounces of water of Cuscuta, and one
ounce of the honey of Roses: or take Hiera Picra three quarters of an ounce,
Diaphoenicon one quarter of an ounce, sirrupe of Cichorie with Rubarb half an
ounce, and Endive water as much as you will. The Rubarb is not ordained for
this but by good reason, because it is forcible at the beginning to take away
the yellow Iaundies. For this are all medicines good that be described not long
ago in the 3.. for the heat of the Liver.

But if the heat after purging will not yet cease, then give the patient every
day one or one and a half of the Trocisks de Camphora, tempered in one ounce
of wine, or the confection Triasantalon, and Diarrhodon Abbatis, but before the
foresaid things be used, you must first use these pills following: Take Earth
worms washed with wine, or burnt to powder in a pot, as much as you please, and
put as much Rubarb unto it or half so much, and make pills thereof, give one
dragme or one dragme and a half at once, according to the age of the party,
mixed with Oxymel.

Also you may give this patient of this foresaid powder one dragme without
Rubarbe. It is also an approved medicine that twenty or thirty earth woormes
be boiled in the water of Sperrage, of smallage, and of Parsley, and to take
often a spoonful of this decoction. Item take of the powder of burnt earth
woormes, roots of Smallage, and of Parsley, of each a like quantity: give
thereof to women and young children to each according to his age: it drives the
yellow iaundise very forcibly through the vein, and in like manner also the
dropsy. For this you have another in the second part in the third chapter and
7..

And to return to purging, if so be that the pills be more acceptable: then
take washed Aloe one dragme or four scruples, and use it after the foresaid
potions which be good and safe.

But if so be that the obstruction of the liver be not opened by it, then is
this medicine following to be used: Take sirrupe de Bizantijs prepared with
Vinegar one ounce and a half, water of Cuscuta, of Hearts tongue, and of Cicorie,
of each one ounce; drink it certain times one after another: or take one
ounce and a half of Oxymel with water of Cuscuta, of Cicorie, and of Buglosse,
of each one ounce three mornings together, and one of the foresaid purgations
after it. The Oxymel is highly commended for this sickness.

These pills following are very forcible for to avoid water: take the juice of
wild Cucumbers, which is Elaterium, and the juice of Swines bread, of each one
dragme and a half, Rapontica one quarter of an ounce, Aloe one dragme,
Diagridion one scruple, Pease meal, Cinnamom, Spica, Lignum Aloes, of each
half a scruple: make pills thereof with the juice of Smallage, and give him one
dragme at once thereof at the most.

Now for to cleanse the head you are to use these things following which you
can get, as the juice of wild Cucumbers, and of Swines bread, of garden
Cresses, Horehound tempered with woman's milk and drawn up through the nose,
and afterward to lie down upon the backs. These things following do cleanse
the gross Cholera which remains still in the head, and does take away all
the yellow iaundise with them. For this are very necessary all cooling and
preparatiue potions, with sirrupe of Endive, and of Purslaine tempered
together, and chiefly if any obstruction of the liver be present; for which
this sirrupe following is also very fit: Take Endive, small Endive, Lettice,
Cicorie, Melilot, Hearts tongue, and Venus hair, of each one handful, twenty or
five and twenty Prunes, seeds of Melons, of Pompeons, Cucumbers, of Gourds,
roots of Cypress, of Capers, Dragon roots, of each one dragme; beat them all
gross, and let them sees together in six and thirty ounces of water even to
the half. Afterward sees in this decoction four and twenty ounces of Sugar
or Honey, and clarify it until there be a sirrupe of it. Another: Take Endive,
Hearts tongue, and Cicorie, of each a handful, wild Endive, and Priest crown, of
each two handfuls, seeds of Melons, Pompeons, Cucumbers, and Gourds, Lacca,
Spiknard, Wormwood, and the roots of Smallage, of each half an ounce, burnt
Iuorie, red Sanders, of each one dragme and a half, Roses one quarter of an
ounce, white Vinegar three dragmes, Sugar twelve ounces; and then make a
sirrupe of it.

Another: Take Endive, Hearts tongue, and Venus hair, of each two handfuls,
Fennel seed, Parsley seed, and Cuscuta, of each half an ounce, Spicanardi,
Spica romana, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you please;
make thereof a sirrupe. For the obstruction of the liver in the beginning of
the 4.. there is also a confection which is very fit for this purpose.

Of all drinks which this patient may drink, there is nothing more meet for
this sickness then the whaie of milk, whereof he is to drink every morning
three weeks together a good draught at each time: for this whaie does cleanse
the blood, and especially if there be mixed with it the juice of Fumitorie. And
the same is also good for all itches and scurffes: Item that the innermost
skin of a hens gissard, also a Partridge dried and beaten to powder; give him
the weight of a dragme thereof in wine or Cicorie water, and let the patient
fast five hours after it. Another: The innermost skin of a pullets gissard
or crop, and the roots of Auence, of each a like quantity; sees them in wine
the space that you would sees an egg, and drink thereof morning and evening,
and fast an hour upon it. Item, take four ounces of Gentian, and Fennel
roots five ounces, Smallage roots two ounces and a half, wash the same very
clean, and cut them in pieces: let them sees al together with sufficient
water, afterward wring them well out through a bag, and then let this decoction
boil until it be as thick as honey, then give thereof two ounces at each time.
This medicine is also especial good for all phlegmatic Agues wherewith the
yellow iaundies be mixed. Item, for all dropsies, all pain of the Kidneies,
pain of the womb, for all venom, and it is to be given them that have an
Ague with any kind of cooling water, and when there is no Ague with a little
Wine. Some do sees it also with Sugar, the which is best of all.

Item, there be moreover good to drink for this yellow iaundies the waters of
Cicorie, of Sorrel, and of Wormwood, but the juice of these herbs be much more
forcible. These herbs be also decocted together or each apart, and the
decoction dronken warm. Item, the yellow seed of the white Lilie dried and
powdered, and one dragme thereof taken is an especial thing in this disease.
The same virtue has grated Iuorie.

After purging, and the use of all these foresaid things, then may any outward
things be used whereby to wear away the yellownes of the body and to consume
it. For this is also much advised, that all yellow colors are to be fixed
before the patients eyes, for nature does the easier expel the yellowness out
of the body. Also, take Endive water and Rose water, of each four ounces, red
and white Saunders, of each one dragme, temper them, and lay them over the
Liver. Item, use the Saunders salve which before in the sixth Chapter in the end
of the first. is described.

Or take a spoonefull of good Honey, and boil the same in a little pot in hot
water, and stir it well about, then put as much wheaten flower unto it as you
can take up with two fingers, and temper a good deal of Saffron amongst it,
yet more always for an old man then for a young man, spread of it upon a cloth
and lay it upon the Nauel: when it is then dry, take afresh again. And you are
to continue this certain days together, to wit, when the yellow iaundies be
at the chief and highest: but one may not lie longer upon it then upon the
other. For bathing, take wild Thyme, watercresses, Alehoofe, Juniper rindes,
Elderne flowers, let this sees well together, and make thereof a sweating bath
with hot stones. Item, take Mugwort Marierom, wild Thyme, Juniper sprigs, of
each one handful, chop them small, and let them sees in two bags, then lay
one upon the belly, and another behind upon the raynes, and therewith let the
patient sweat.

Also, this Lie following may be used for the head. Take Betony, Cammomill, and
Sage, of each one handful, Marierom, Spica Romana, of each half a handful,
Seen leaves three ounces, Stechas two ounces, chop all small, and sees them
together in a good deal of water, and make Lie thereof, it will continue good
a whole month.

For this hot yellow Iaundies is good all that which penetrateth, cleanses,
and opens the Liver, to wit, Sorrel, Endive, Nightshade, winter Cherries,
Orage, the juice of Wormwood, Venus hair, roots of Cicorie and Sperage,
Verueine, and the water of the same herbs decocted in well water, and clarified
with Honey or Sugar, and so made into a Potion.

And for conclusion of this heat, there is good heed to be taken whether the
patient be abounding of blood, and has full veins, and also has not bin let
blood a long time, and so there be nothing which hinders the same, then is the
Liver vein to be opened, and to let it bleed according to his ability. But if
the yellow Iaundies be without heat and without Ague, then is it a sign that
it is caused of Cholera and Phlegma together: you are first to give to this
sick person preparatiues, with Syrupo Acetoso composito, or De Byzantijs. He
is also to drink water of Carduus Benedictus with a little Saffron, and
afterward purge with these things following or such like: Take Aloc one
dragme, Diagridij five greynes, Agaricus two scruples, dried juice of Agrimonie
one scruple, then make it into pills with the juice of Endive, or use in the
stead of it one dragme of the pills of Rubarb.

These pills following are not to purge but to open obstructions, Sulphur vif
one dragme, the juice of Swines bred half a scruple, Euphorbium five greynes,
the juice of Smallage half and dragme, make pills thereof, and give him half a
dragme of it at once. When he has purged, then let him take Trociscos de
Lacca, with the decoction of Fennel, Parsley roots, of Smallage, and such
like. For this is also good Troscisci de Rhabarbaro, Radish water, and
Agrimony. Item, the juice of Swines bred made to a sirupe with Sugar, which is
found to be special good, and it moves sweat. In like manner be meet for
this the great Treacle Diatessaron, and Mithridate, sometimes one dragme,
(taking more or less thereof) according to the importance of the case. The
simples which are meet for the yellow Iaundies (when there is neither heat
nor Ague with it) be Mather (if one take a dragme thereof every day.) Item
Gentian, roots of Smallage, of Pennyroyall, Diptamiu, Rosemary, Centorie,
Agrimony, Annis, Fennel, Licorice, Rapontica, of Costus, Aristologie. Alehoofe
and Piony. The compounded things be conserues of Eybright, of Fumitorie, of
Elder flowers, Piony and Rosemary. The herbwines, are the wine of Betonie, of
Gillyfloures, of Hearts tongue, of Tamariske, of Asarabacca, and of Wormwood. The
Oxymel alone opens all obstructions. But if so be that the yellow Iaundies do
remain long in the eyes, then the sick person is to smell often unto sharp
Vinegar, for it provoke the expulsive power whereby the brains may be
unburdened of all their superfluous humors: or receive the vapor into your
eyes of the decoction of Hyssop, Marierom, Maiden hair, Cammomil, Dill, of all
them or which you please. You may also wash the face with it. And it is very
good to smell unto Rose water or Rose vinegar. Item, you may sometimes drop
into their eyes one or two drops of the juice of Citrons, of Limons, or of
Oranges. But if these juices be too sharp, then mix them with the water of
Cuscuta, which water alone is very effectual in this matter.

Also for the yellow iaundies, whether the same proceed of heat or cold,
neesing is highly recommended, especially if the same can be procured and
effected with the juice of Horehound. Also all such sick persons must wash
themselves with water wherein Cammomill is decocted, and chiefly at the
beginning of the yellow iaundies. The face is often to be washed with Rose
water, to the end that the yellowness might the less infect the eyes.

As much as concerns the black iaundies: the same is to be cured with the
self same things, wherewith all the maladies of the milt are to be cured,
whereof shall be spoken hereafter: to wit with clisters, letting of blood, and
other means more which may there be read.

Of the Dropsy in general.. 12.
THe Dropsy is a sickness which is caused of a cold humor that does
penetrate throughout all the members, in such manner that they thereby are all
puffed up and swollen. Or the dropsy is an error of the nutritive virtue
throughout the whole body: which error is provoked by those causes which do
hinder the natural concoction of the liver.

The common signs and right ambassadors of the Dropsy are first of all these
following: swelling or puffing up of the feet and the legs, afterward of the
face (in men of the cods) and a little over all the whole body: Secondly, the
alteration of the color of the body into a white color. Thirdly, when all the
humors in the whole body be corrupted: the which the Grecians do call
Cacochymian. Fourthly, great thirst. Fifthly, lost appetite through continual
desire of drink. Sixthly, retention of stools, of sweat, of vomiting, of the
flowers or terms in women, and such like. Seventhly, small store of urine.
Eighthly, that these sick folks are very slow and unhandsome for all works.
Chances it then, (as it is wont to happen) that there be any ulcers or sores
with it, then be the same by reason of the corrupted humors which be in this
place very hardly to be healed. And although this sickness be very hard and
dangerous to be cured: yet nevertheless must the sick person not therefore be
utterly discouraged. In like manner also the Physician is through all possible
means to endeavor himself to withstand this sickness. The total sum for
to rid this sickness depends on three points; to wit, the mollification of
the indurate tumors which be in the bowels and other places: or the use of all
manner of things for to expel the humors. Lastly, he must be diligent to
drive out the same by going to stool, and chiefly through the urine: So that
the principal means consist in this, that one do drink but little, do live
soberly and orderly, use reasonable exercise, that one do sweat much, purge
often, and use Clisters: for if all this be not diligently observed, then is
there not much good to be expected. For notwithstanding that all these things
be adhibited and permitted: yet be there nevertheless very few helped of it.
These common rules always take place in all sorts of dropsies.

The learned do make three Species of dropsies, as Anasarca, also Hyposarca,
(albeit some do make difference between them, and so make four kinds of
dropsies) Ascites, and Tympania, or Tympanites, of which we will severally
write hereafter. But first we will then briefly declare thus much.

When as any one is thought to have gotten the dropsy, or that the same is yet
in the beginning, for it, is the conserues of Fumitorie highly commended; for
it cleanses the blood. For this is also good the golden water which is
described in the eight Part. The conserve of Eyebright does open much all
obstructions. For this is also very meet all that is ordained herebefore for
the obstruction of the Lights and Liver.

Of the Dropsy Anasarca.. 12.
THis spec. of dropsy does Galen also call Leucophlegmatia Hydrops, as a white
waterish dropsy, and is such a dropsy wherein the water which lies between
the skin and the flesh is dispersed through the whole body, through each member
and in the face, and makes them swell; so that the belly and the navel do not
swel alone: in which swelling if that it be pressed with the finger, then does
the dint or pit remain long after in it. The privy members do swell, also a
waterish scouring or laske. The pulses will be slow and do beat longsome and
leysurely.

The causes of it are bad digestion: so that all the meat and drink is at
least the half part turned into a flegmaticke matter, whereby the same cannot
as behooves the assimilated to the other parts. When as then these foresaid
signs be perceived in the face and in the priuities, then may the sickness be
taken well to be Anasarca, the which also of all other dropsies is most easiest
to be cured, because that it divides it self into all the parts of the body,
and for that cause may be the easier overcome by nature.

For this are these remedies ensuing to be used. First, if it be a woman, and
that the same sickness is fallen upon her, and caused through retention and
let of her terms, or obstruction of the Hemorrhoides; then is care to be had
through all means to help and to provoke them. And in case that the same
cannot be compassed and effected, then is the Saphea or Milt vein to be
opened: and likewise to set boxing cups on the thighs and legs.

But for all other species of Dropsies letting of blood is very hurtful, for
that they have but little blood, yet very much moisture; whereby the good blood
being drawn out, the water will be left behind.

For this, is to be given to the patient this sirupe following for to open him:
like as is taught in the 4.. of the diseases of the liver.

Item, Trocisci de lacca, are especial good for this: and afterward he must
every week be purged with pills of Rubarbe.

Or take these pills ensuing: Agregatiuae two scruples, Ammoniaci one scruple,
and make seven pills of it with Oxymel. The pills de Hiera, de Aloe, de Mezereo,
Foetidae, de Agarico, are altogether very meet for this use. It is also
admonished before to use reasonable exercise, hunger and thirst. More waking
than sleeping is very commodious. Item, water bathes (if one can come to them)
are also very good for this, which be by nature warm: or in the stead of them
to bathe in dry baths, and then to sweat well. Such persons must also in
warm seasons, and when the wind is down, lie with their bellies toward the
heat of the Sun, and let the same be well rubbed. Some do advise also, that
the arms and the legs must be well rubbed.

This confection following is very fit to purge and expel water: Take Turbith
half an ounce, Hermodactili one ounce, peeled wild Saffron seeds three
quarters of an ounce, Ginger, Cinnamom and Annis, of each one scruple, Violets,
Cuscuta, Sorrel seed, of each one dragm, honey of Roses four ounces, Sugar two
ounces: sees the Honey and the Sugar with a little of the water of Fumitorie
until you may scum it: when it is sodden enough, then mix the rest with it
unto a Confection. Give thereof half an ounce at once.

Another.
TAke one dragme of Rubarbe, Annis, wild yellow Rapeseede, and Indy Spica, of
each one scruple, Licorice one dragme, Asarabacca half a drag. Conserve of
Marioram one ounce, Conserve of Roses three ounces, Miua cydoniorum and Oxymel,
as much as you will, for to make a Confection. This Confection strengthens
and expels much the water.

Yet another. Take Elecampane roots, Ireos and Gentian, of each one dragme,
Ireos losinges one ounce, sirupe of Horehound one ounce and a half; then make
a Confection thereof. Take thereof as often as you please: it strengthens,
does quench thirst and lengthen the breath.

The ancient Physicians do advise much for to vomit, to wit, at the first in
the beginning of the sickness whilst that the patient is in state of strength,
but not otherwise.

Some do write, that dried Hedgehogs flesh does maruellously ease in this
sickness, if one take of the same one quarter of an ounce in wine. The like is
also reported of the Wolfes Liver, if the same be taken with Rubarb and
Rapontica, with water wherein Wormwood is decocted.

Of the Dropsy Ascites.. 14.
THis Dropsy some do call Ascliten, and Alchiten. In this Dropsy the belly
does only swell and the legs, and contrarily the upper parts of the body do
dry away. This name is given to this species of Dropsies, of a hyde wherein men
do carry Wine or Oil.

Of all other signs this sickness is a great trouble in the belly, when one
clappeth or sounds upon it he does hear a rumbling or a noise of water which
is forcibly stirred about, the which also happens if the sick person do turn
himself from the one side to the other: the body is not so swolen throughout
like as in the foresaid Dropsy, neither do there remain therein any dents or
pits if one press therein with the finger. The nauel does not stand so puffed
up as in the Tympanite, the pulse is feeble, swift, and small.

The cause of this Dropsy is feeblenes of the Liver, which has not a
sanguification or concoction, and alters all her moisture into water.

This infection of the Liver may be caused as well of heat as of cold: also of
the water which is engendered in the Liver, that falls down afterward into
the lower parts and hollownes of the belly.

If this Dropsy do come through hot causes, after any pain of the Liver,
after an Ague, by swelling up the belly beneath the Navel even to the very
hip: also if one turn the sick person about one hears the water, he has an
intolerable thirst, auoideth but little urine which is fiery red, with some
clots as it were with small stones: then is there great danger, and but small
hope of life to be had. For if so be that one give to the patient medicines
which do cool the heat, then is the Liver enfeebled, the water and wind
augmented: if that warm and drying things be used for it, then does the heat
and excessive thirst increase.

But not to leave this sick person utterly comfortless, and to please his
friends, you may use for the lengthening of his life moderate cold and warm
things, like as is this sirupe following: Take Endive four handfuls, Maiden
hair and Hearts tongue, of each one handful, Fennel seed, Parsley seed, and
Cuscuta, of each half an ounce, Spica Nardi, Spica Romana, of each one quarter
of an ounce, and Sugar six ounces, make a clarified sirupe of it.

In like sort may also this cooling confection following be used, as
Diarrhodon, Dialacca, Diacrocoma, Diatrisantalon, and Aromaticum Rosatum, and
other such like cooling things mo.

Also the Wolfes liver (like as herebefore for Anasarca is said) is very highly
commended for this, if the same be given with Endive water, for it should (even
as many think) reduce the Liver to her right state.

Also for to cool the heat of the liver may this plaster following be made
and applied upon it: Take the juice of Endive, of small Endive, of Agrimonie,
of Liuerwort, of each two ounces, Barley meal as much as will suffice to make a
plaster withal.

It happens also very often that in this Ascite the patient is hard bound in
body, who if he be known of sufficient strength, then is he to be often purged
(as is already said) yt which may be effected through sundry means, as through
Pills, Potions, and through Clisters, whereof there be many herebefore described
for the obstruction of the Liver, and are also very requisite for this purpose,
and amongst the rest these following may also be used: First, let pills be made
with Rubarb, which be acuated with a little Mezereo, and be given unto him once
a week.

Also the pills of Mezereo, are very good for this use, but they must be taken
in hand very circumspectly: for that the Mezereon is marvelous sharp, as
herebefore in the introduction you may well perceive.

Item: Take of the foresaid Mezereon leaves which have been steeped two days
and two nights before in the juice of Quinces and Vinegar, and dried again,
half a drag. make small pills thereof: it expels water wonderfully. The like
have you before in the 4.. good pills in the obstructio^ of the liver,
beginning: Take Spica, etc. The juice of wild Cucumbers, or Elaterium is also
good for this, but it must be given with great circumspection; for there is no
man so strong that may take above half a scruple. Our Physicians do seldom
take above four grains at once, as is amplier spoken of in the Introduction.
Item, take clouted Goats milk three ounces, the juice of blew Flower-deluce
half an ounce; seeethe it on a small fire unto the half or more; strain it
and temper it in a little Sugar, and so take it. Or take the juice of blew
Flower-deluce which is very clear one ounce, drink it with some Sugar, or with
some Goats milk once in every 4. days: and the days between both is he to
drink a good draught of Beer decocted with Wormwood, or Wormwood powder with
2. ounces of Sugar cast into sugar plates, and eat thereof. In Italy they have
an herb called Soldonella, ye juice whereof is much used for ye dropsy: also
the water and powder of the herb: or in stead thereof may be used for the
dropsy, of ye said blew Flower-deluce: for that Soldonella with grows near
the sea and all salt places, is given with wine wherein Rapontica with a little
Wormwood is decocted. What force Wormwood has in this disease is sufficiently
showed in the end of the 9.. Also what virtue the wild Saffron seed has for
the Dropsy, look for the same in the Introduction; the like also of the eedes
of Manus Christi.

A powder to purge withal: Take beaten Ireos three dragmes, Ginger two
scruples, Annis, Masticke, of each one scruple, white sugar Candy one dragme,
Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Diagridion six grains: take one dragme
thereof; it expels the water and the going to stool very vehemently. But if
there be any heat withal, then are these mild purgations to be used: Take the
flowers of Burrage, Violets, Fumitorie, of each half an ounce, Licorice,
Iuiubes, Currants, and Wormwood, of each one quarter of an ounce, eight or ten
Prunes, Spicanardi one dragme: seethe them all in whay of Goats milk, and
steep therein half an ounce of the shells of yellow Mirobalans for a potion.

Item, take six ounces of the whay of Goats milk, and fresh roots of the
Flower-deluce which be well cleansed from their shells half an ounce; sees the
same until two parts remain, then temper them together for a purgation.

Clisters, as is before discoursed are also marvelous good for all such
dropsies, whereof certain do follow: Take Ebulus, Cammomill, and S. John's
wort, of each one handful: Let them sees sufficiently in water; then take of
this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, Sallad oil three spoonefuls, half
an ounce of Hiera Pachij, or Hiera Picra, Salt one dragme; temper them then
together. Item, take the broth of Tripes, or any other fresh flesh broth, Pease
pottage, or any other that one has ready in the stead of common water; and in
the stead of Hiera, take prepared Cassie for Clisters.

This following does loose more: Take Mallows, Hollihockes, Beetes, Cammomill,
and the herb Mercury, of each one handful: Sees it in water or in any of
the foresaid brothes, and take thereof twelve or sixteen ounces, Salt, Oil,
Hiera or Cassie, Hiera Picra, Benedicta Laxatiua, of each half an ounce;
temper them together, and minister this Clister very warm. This following
draws from the head: Take Rosemarie, Betonie, Cammomill, and Saint John's
wort, of each one handful, Polipodie, wild Saffron seed gross beaten, of
each half an ounce, and sees them well. This being done, take as much broth
and do as is beforesaid: there may also be used in stead of common oil, the
oil of Linseede.

If there be great griping of the belly with it, then may also be used with the
foresaid herbs, Annis, Fennel, Caraway, all together, or those that one can
get: Take the weight of an ounce thereof beaten all together gross.

Clisters are not only good for the Dropsy, but also against all griping of
the belly, against the grauel, against the obstructions, against the yellow
Iaundise, shoorings, and such like.

But in case that with this Dropsy there be any scouring or red flixe: then
are Trociskes to be given to the patient, of Barberies with Vinegar: for these
Trociskes do cool, supple, and strengthen the liver, and stay the scouring.
The same do also Trocisci de Spodio, de Sandalis, and the juice of Quinces, and
all that is made thereof. Item, the Conserve and confected roots of Cicorie,
by reason that they a binding and cooling operation.

But if so be that the Ascites be without an ague, and there be no rednes seen
in the water, then may these pills following be given.

Take prepared leaves of Mezereon and Sagapenum, of each one scruple, and make
this to pills with the juice of Wormwood, but give no more at once then the
fourth part only, for they expel and purge very forcibly.

What things do move Urine.
IN the beginning of the description of the Dropsy, it is (amongst other
things) thus declared, that the chiefest mean for to cure this sickness, is
to expel urine, and to avoid the same in great abundance, the which may be
achieved through these means following: Take Rue, S. John's woort, Peniroyall,
Sage, Marioram gentle, Wormwood, Licorice, Annis, Fennel, and Elecampane
roots, of each one quarter of an ounce, sees them together in a quart of Wine,
but not too long; then drink thereof in the morning three ounces, and as much
more in the evening. Item, take Garlic and S. John's woort, of each one
handful, sees them together in a pint of Wine until a third part be
decocted: afterward strain it thorough, and when you please drink a little
thereof at one time, it dries up the water, and expels the rest through the
urine.

Item, take the whay of Goats milk four ounces, sees three dragmes of Spica
nardi in it unto three ounces, and give it him to drink fasting. Or take one
ounce of the juice of Nep. Also white Wine wherein the flowers of Rosemarie and
the herb be decocted, is very meet for this. Item, the vinegar of Squils is
also very good.

The Trociscide Lacca, or Crocoma, one quarter of an ounce given at one time
with any of the foresaid juices, be especial good for this.

Item, Rubarb, Asarabacca, Diptamus, Cinnamome, Agrimonie, Marioram gentle,
Rue, Myrrh, all together, or each alone steeped in Wine, are very fit for the
Dropsy, or any other malady.

In the description of the yellow Iaundise in the eleventh. have you also
amongst other potions, a very good potion fit for this, beginning. Take
Gentian, etc.

These things following do also expel urine, namely, Hermodactili, Indie
Spica, Licorice, Cinnamome, Fennel, Betonie, Vinegar, Parsley roots, Sage, and
Rosemarie, sees any of these things in Wine; and in three or four ounces of
the same Wine dissolve one dragme of the trociskes De Lacca, but above all
other these here be very commodious: Item, the roots of Nettles, of Parsley,
Fennel, Elecampane roots, Asarabacca, powned all together, or each alone,
taking one dragme thereof, or wine drunk wherein the same has been a while
decocted. The roots of great Fern boiled in Wine and drunk, expel urine
very much. Of all herb wines are commended above all other things for the
Dropsy, to wit, wine of Gilloflowers, roots of Marioram gentle, Betony,
Asarabacca, and of Hyssope, but all troubled wines are contrary to this
disease.

Outwardly are sundry plasters used, and it is reported that they do bring
four kinds of commodities: first, they do supple, dry, expel wind, and do
strengthen the belly and all the intrailes, like as these following are: Take
Coloquint, Hollihocke seeds, Diagridion, Aloe, Myrrh, roots of Mallows and
Bdellion, of each one dragme and a half, Ireos three dragmes, seeds of
Mallows, wild Cucumbers, Cardamome and Euphorbium, of each three drag. Boreas,
Sal gemmae, of each one quarter of an ounce, Goose grease, Duckes grease,
Calves, and Hogs su^t, as much as is needful for to make a plaster or a
salve, lay this plaster upon the belly, it does supple much. The plaster of
Bayberries is also special good for the Dropsy, and moreover much mightier
for it, if the same be tempered with Goats dung, or Cow dung.

If the priuities be much swollen, then make this plaster following: Take
Annis, Fennel, and Comin, beaten small together, of each one ounce and a
half, Bean meal, Ebulus, the juice of Elderne leaves, and good Wine as much
as will suffice, lay it upon the belly, and over the priuities.

Another: Take Barley meal, Cypers roots, dried Sheep dung, Borace and
Bolus, of each a like quantity, beat them together, make a plaster thereof
and apply it to the belly. This plaster has great force to exsiccate and dry
the water. Item, take Cow dung, or Goats dung, and temper them with the urine
of a man child unto a plaster. Or take Ox dung which is dried in an oven,
powne it to powder, and make thereof a plaster with Wine, and then lay it on
the belly.

Another: Take fat Figs three ounces, Pigeon dung half an ounce, Masticke and
Spikenard of each half a dragme, powne all that is to be powned, and then make
it to a plaster with Goats piss.

Of all other salues is that of Agrippa much commended, which is known at all
Apothecaries, for it is marvelous good for the Dropsy. There is also another
made, that is Arthanita, of Swines bred which is not so common. For a common
inunction the oil of Cammomil and of Rue tempered together is very commodious.

But it is also to be noted, that if so be that the Dropsy do come out of any
cold occasion, that then this foresaid plaster is to be laid upon the whole
belly, and the cooling things upon the Liver.

Sweating is very good for all Dropsies.. 15.
IT is showed, that among other releuations and expulsions of superfluous
moistures of man's body sweating is accounted one: therefore it is very
needful to write somewhat thereof, and how that the sweat, especially for
Dropsies, is moved.

We have also written in another place of a dry sweat bath, the which for the
difference thereof we will rehearse here again.

Take a flat tub, turn the same vpside down over a hot harth, and make under
this tub a small fire of Elderne wood or Juniper wood without smoke until it
be thorough warm. When it is then hot, set hoopes about it that it may be
covered close, then set the patient in the same tub covered every where close,
yet so that his head be without. Afterward he is to rub him well, to the end
he may sweat well: dry away the sweat, and let him sit in it as long as he
can abide it. Item, take Ebulus, Bean straw, of each a like quantity, sees
them together, and make thereof a sweating bath with hot stones, as is
accustomed. It is also good to drink a dragme of the powder of Bayberries with
Wine, and chiefly after the sweating. Conserve of Elderne (taken fasting before
sweating) after purging, causes abundant sweat, and does expel the fountain
or beginning of the Dropsy.

This following should be marvelous auailable for the Dropsy through
sweating: Take of the middlemost green rind of the Elder eight good handfuls,
Carduus Benedictus six handfuls, Rosemarie three handfuls, the uppermost
sprigges of Elder three handfuls, choppe all these small together, then put
them into a glass, and power upon it two quarts of white Wine; then stop it
very fast, and so set it the space of fourteen days in horse dung, and
afterward distill it in seething water, whereof give the patient one spoonful
twice a day. But at the first time give him very little of it: and if he can
abide it, then give him more. This has been tried in a thick fat woman: that
she must be laid upon a leather bed, that the sweat through this medicine has
run so extremely from her, that it must be laden up with dishes.

The great Treacle Diatessaron, and Mithridate, one dragme, or a dragme and a
half taken with Wine, or any of the foresaid waters do vehemently expel
sweat. In like manner is very commodious for this all that is set down for
the yellow Iaundise, for provoking urine, and expelling of gravel.

Certain famous ancient Physicians do advise, that unto them that have the
Dropsy, shall Treacle be given, and that thereupon they should be made sweat
upon a board in a warm Oven, having their head out. But I cannot much approve
the same.

The like gross means, like as to bury the sick person warm in the said
and other things more, there be of many men many described. But I will not
rehearse them all, because I have declared some that be more necessary and
tolerable.

Of the Dropsy Tympanites.. 16.
THis Tympania or Tympanites, is also properly called Hydrops, which is a
Dropsy: because that it is rather caused to wind then of water, and has
therefore her name for that the belly as in other Dropsies, is here also puffed
up higher: the Navel is thrust forth on high: and because all other members
do consume and wax very lean: yea for that the belly is hard swollen, that
one clapping or knocking upon it ^ gives a clear and hollow sound.

In these sicknesses, the patient ought not to eat at any hand any green
herbs, nor yet any thing else which makes or ingendreth wind, as Spinach,
Beetes, Coleworts, new fruits, Pease, Beans, Turnips, boiled Rice, or any
such like. He must also beware of milk, Cheese, Chestnuts, unleavened bread,
and Must. He must also eschew all cold, and keep himself always warm, and to
sweat if it be possible, even as we have said before. And the belly must be
daily well warmed with warm Panicke or Millet wherewith is mixed a little Salt:
for this causes the wind to break away. In like manner shall boxing cups also
be set upon it vnpickt.

All these things following are good for him: to wit, the Confection
Diacyminum, or de Baccis Lauri used often, and other mo that be written
hereafter for the griping of the belly.

But above all and for all Dropsies, the prepared Wolfes liver is very much
commended, be it powdered or eaten otherwise amongst other meat: for it has
an excellent and privy virtue to expel the Dropsy.

Item, these things following may be used for all Dropsies, if there be no
heat with it, as Conserve of Elderne leaves, of Betony, Gilloflowers, and of
Rosemarie, Fennel, Annis Cathirst, and much watching are also good for this.

These suppositories also following are very meet for this purpose: Take Sal
gemmae, Rue, Beuercod, Euphorbium, and Nettle seed, of each one drag. decocted
Honey about three ounces, and make thereof suppositories. These following be not
so strong: Take Comin, Boreas, Rue-seede, of each a like quantity, Honey as
much as is needful for to make suppositories. Also let the belly be rubbed
with rough linen until it be red. And when the wind does not blow, let the
Sun shine upon it.

This plaster following is marvelous good for this: Take dried Goats dung
twelve ounces, roots of wild Cucumbers, and roots of Ebulus, of each two
ounces, Barley meal twelve ounces, steeled Vinegar four ounces; make a
plaster thereof, boiled well with sharp Lee: this plaster consumes all
windy matter, opens the pores, and draws all wind out of the body if it be
laid warm thereon. The belly is also to be anointed with oils which be of a
hot nature: to wit, with oil of Dill, oil of Rue, of Costus and of
Bayberries.

Of Clisters we have spoken before: but for this are such chiefly to be used as
do expel the winds, as this following is: Take Ireos, Hyssope, Smallage, Rue,
Bearefoote, of each one handful, Annis, Fennel, Ameos, Bayberries, of each
half an ounce; let them sees well. Take afterward of this decoction twelve or
sixteen ounces, if the patient be meetly strong: then put unto it clarified
Honey, and oil of Rue of each one ounce and a half, and stone Salt one drag.
There may also Hiera Picra be put unto it: for the same is marvelous good for
to drive out all bad humors, and to leave the good.

Here do now follow certain Sirupes more which are to be used for all Dropsies,
like as the common sirupe of Eupatoriae, which is good for all cold diseases
and obstructions of the Liver, and therefore is good for the dropsy: it
extenuateth all tough and gross humors, it comfort the Liver, it expels
water, and hinders all swellings of the inward parts.

In Italy is the ensuing sirupe of Ireos much used: Take green roots of Ireos
four and twenty ounces; cut them in pieces, steep them the space of three
days in as much well Water as will cover them: stir them about twice a day, but
that they may be covered under the water: afterward strain the water from
them, and power other water upon them, as before: keep the first water in a
clean pot, and do the second time as you did at the first: Then temper both
these waters together, or sees each alone with a little Sugar. Afterward mix
these things following with it; to wit, Scabious, and Maidenhaire, of each one
handful, Sperage roots, Fennel roots, Ireos roots, of each half a
handful, peeled Melon seed, Gourd seeds, Cucumber seeds, and peeled Pompeon
seeds, seeds of Purslaine, of Cicorie, of Endive, and of Lettice, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Fennel, Annis, Sperage seed, and Smallage seed, of each
half a dragme, Millet, and winter Cherries, of each three dragmes, fat
Dates, and Figs, of each six, Liccorice, Madder, of each five dragmes: let
them sees all together unto the half, and afterward sees the decoction with
sufficient Sugar unto a sirupe. Some do give this sirupe a pleasant taste with
Cinnamome. Other do steep therein one quarter of an ounce of Rubarbe against
the obstruction and debilitie of the liver.

The Italian Physicians do give thereof, when they will prepare any bad humor,
not above one ounce at the first, and afterward a little more, until they be
wholly purged with it. It is also to be noted, that when this Sirupe waxes
old, it loses the purguing virtue. Also we will now speak of the juice of
the blew Flower-deluce: When it is given alone, it annoyeth the stomach, and
causes the red or bloody flixe. Further, for this sickness is to be used the
sirupes de Radicibus, de Absynthio, Capillis Veneris, de Betonica, and such
like more.

When it appears that the swelling of the belly, of the legs, and of the
priuities does decrease (be it in whatsoever Dropsy it will) the boil Ebulus
with the root and herb and bathe or foment therewith the swollen places, or
wash it with common Lie which is somewhat salted.

Other do advise this following: Take Marioram, Wormwood, field Mints,
Parietarie, the roots and leaves of Ebulus, Marioram gentle, Cammomill, and
Maydenhaire, all together or which you will: seethe them in Wine or Lie, and
therewith bath the members, but always after purging, for otherwise it is not
requisite. Mark also, that for all sorts or kinds of Dropsies, the remedies
are often to be altered, taking now one sort, and another time another sort:
and that for this is always a good order of diet, as we shall here briefly
note, and set forth.

The order of Diet.
WE have heretofore sufficiently showed that sobriety is good and needful for
all Dropsies. It is therefore required, that one do eat but once a day.
Partridges are good for him, Turtle doves, and other young Pigeons, Kids,
rostmeate, Pullets, Fowls dressed with Veriuice and the juice of Limons, Barley
or Spelt dread which is raised and well-baked, are also good for him. He may
also eat sometimes Endive, Sorrel and Cicorie, with Vinegar, or a Sallad with
Sorrel and Parsley.

And for a conclusion, we are to say somewhat more for opening the skin in this
Dropsy, thereby to let out the water. The which the learned do permit at the
last, when the patient has his legs and priuities full of water, that the same
be then opened with a Lancet, thereby to let out the water, but not much at
once. But in truth this is a slender help, and feebleth the sick more then it
does strengthen: for inwardly as much water has a course unto it as may be
letten out.

Other do open the legs with Cantharides. The third sort do cauterise the belly
two or three fingers broad beneath the Navel, so that there as much as may be
they do draw over and open the skin, and that chiefly in Ascite, where it ought
most to be used. We will also note at this present, that because oftentimes
before the hot Euphorbium has been remembered, the same is not to be used but
in the greatest extremity, even as his nature and operation are at large
described in the Introduction.

The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Gall.
WIthin the midst of the Liver is a bladder established by nature, wherein is
kept and gathered all bitter and sharp humors which are separated from the
blood: which humors the Grecians do call Choleram, the Latinists Bilem, and we
call, the Gall. The nature of this humor is described after three kinds of
ways: to wit, light green Cholera, yellow Cholera, and lastly, black Cholera,
like as before is sufficiently showed. This black choler (by reason of her
color) is also called of the Grecians Melancholia, and is cold, dry, sharp,
and heavy, and also none other then dregs, and yeast of the gross blood: for
it is nothing else but a yellow Cholera, that is, Oxymel burnt, whereby the
yellow and green Cholera are easily altered into black Cholera. How this
black Cholera does make men mad and raging, in the first part, in the twelfth
Chapter, and 8.. is sufficiently declared, and also shall be taught hereafter.

It happens either through extremity of heat or cold, that the black
Cholera, appears rather in the winter, and the yellow Cholera in summer time.
For when as the conduits which do carry those superfluities into the Gall are
obstructed, then is the yellow Cholera dispersed through the whole body, with
the rest of the blood, which causes the yellow Iaundise; and otherwhiles, by
reason of their sharpness and heat, a certain Ague. Or if it get wholly the
upper hand, then does it cause many kinds of ill and sharp exulcerations,
whereof we are to write more at large in other places.

Thus for to remedy this Cholera, and the foresaid Ague thereby, is this
general rule prescribed by Galen.

At the first it happens otherwhiles, that the Gall does send her superfluity
to the stomach, whereby the digestion is hindered and spoiled, and the patient
gets great infirmity: for this, there is no fitter mean to exonerate him
thereof; than by vomiting, and that chiefly when one is fasting.

Contrariwise is the Melancholia, which through her heaviness descends
downwards, to be purged through the stool, which may be most commodiously
effected through Clisters, afterward through sweating, and through the urine.

And how this ought to be put in practice, is sufficiently declared before in
the Dropsy, and yellow Iaundise. In like manner it is especial good to bath
in sweet water, for thereby will both the said choleric humors be moystned
and cooled, if it be done in due time. This patient is also to forbear Wine,
even till the declination of the sickness.

And when the sickness begins to decline, then is he to use small, watered,
and but a little wine. All meats that moisten and cool are good for these
Aguish folk, if the same be soberly used. These herbs following may also be
dressed in his meat; as Orage, Beetes, Sorrel, Mallows, Lettice, Gourds. Also
Barley paps (which is Ptisana) and fish which is caught in grauelly waters. All
Fowls are good for him which have a soft and tender flesh, or the pinions of
the gross and hard fowls. The brains and feet of Swine, small birds, and
rere sodden (...) be good, but chiefly the yolks which are more nourishing,
and lighter to be digested.

He may use all fruits that remain not long in the stomach; but he must
refrain Honey, Mustard, salt and sharp meats.

This may suffice of the Gall, of her bladder, nature, and of the tertian Ague
which is caused by it. Of which Ague, amongst other, shall be further written
in the sixth part. The sicknesses besides, which be caused through Cholera,
shall be described more at large in their due places.

The fourteenth Chapter. Of the Milt or Spleen.
THis third part of man's body contains also in it the Milt, which the
Grecians do call Splen, and the Latinists Lien, a known and necessary part of
man's body. It has his place in the left side over against the Liver and the
Gal, next of all to the stomach. And if this were not found in the left side
but in the right side (like as the same before time has been seen) then is it
reputed to be against nature.

This Milt is fastened to the back with certain sinews, where the ribs do
take end: and with one end it stretches to the Liver in the right side. Her
substance and essence is a tender and soft flesh, like to a sponge; yet to be
compared to the Lights, it is so much harder and faster, as she is softer and
tenderer then the Liver. She has also many veins and arteries, whereby she
draws easily unto her the gross melancholicke humors out of the Liver, by
which she is fed and sustained. She is different in color to the Milt of
beasts: for it is black gray, of form long and thin: and of all fourefooted
beasts there is none which more agrees with the Spleen of a man, then that of
a Hog.

The office of this Milt is none other but to cleanse the liver from all
melancholic humors, and that is brought to pass through the said veins,
whereby she draws unto her the same gross humors, where she keeps and
retains the cleanest, and drives from her the rest through certain passages
and conduits: which if it be not performed, the spleen is so weakened that it
cannot perfectly draw unto it the same melancholicke humors, and then there
proceed out of it diverse melancholic sicknesses; as namely, heaviness of
mind, desperate madness, and such like.

This disease of the spleen has his certain and outward signs: as when one
is sorrowful, then does he commonly feel pain about the Spleen where
melancholy has her residence. Yea there is also written thereof, and believed
by many, that if men were deprived of their spleen, then they should thereby
loose all their laughing, and that their laughing and mirth does augment
according to the increase of the spleen.

Also the foresaid feebleness of the Milt causes exulcerations, swellings,
leaprie, the canker, and such like. And albeit, that it do draw the
melancholicke humors unto it, yet nevertheless can she not by reason of her
feebleness expel the superfluity of the same: but swells, whereby an
Impostume may easily follow. If then it force the biting and sharp matter
excessiuely into the stomach; then does it there cause the insatiable Dogs
hunger, whereof we have written in the eleventh Chapter and five and thirty. Or
if the same harden in the stomach, then does it cause vomiting: the bowels
will thereby be made sore and deadly annoyed, and also afflicted with more other
perilous accidents: by all which it may easily be perceived, how much the
health of this part imports.

Therefore it is to the contrary much to be marvelled at, that certain Beasts
can be wholly without it. And so daily experience shows, that how much the
less a man's spleen is, so much the faster may one run, and do the more labor.

The chiefest diseases of the spleen, be inflammations, obstructions, and
schirrosities: of which the obstructions and hardenings do depend so fast one
upon another, that the one cannot be well without the other. And the Physicians
have also no other difference in use, than that there be used for the
obstructions mo inward medicines, than for the hardness or schirrosity: for in
the hardness of the same must outward things be used, whether the same be caused
through heat, cold, or wind, which do come commonly with it: So that the
spleen in all these diseases has great affinity with the Liver: and so all
that which is ordained for the Liver, is also serving for the spleen.

And now to write briefly of the occasions of these maladies, whether the same
be always moved through inward or outward causes. The outward causes may be
such meats and drinks as do engender melancholicke blood: as Cheese,
Coleworts, salted flesh, and such like, according as has been said in the
first part, of Melancholia.

The inward causes do come of the Liver; or when the melancholic humors be too
in any; or when the spleen has a bad complexion, whether it proceed of
Cholera, Phlegma, wind, or any other occasion.

Of the obstruction of the Spleen with heat, and an ague.. 1.
THe obstructed Spleen has these signs: to wit, an hardness which one may
feel outwardly, with pain, swelling, thirst, thin and il-fauoured color of
the urine, a heavy rattling breath, bad color of the face and of the whole
body, heaviness of mind, terrible dreams, and such like. But with the
impostume is always this difference, that the pain is in one place only: but
in the hardness of the spleen without impostumation, the pain is over all the
whole spleen. These diseases do also make the whole body lean, because that
the Liver does not perform her natural digestion, and in stead of good blood
does engender bad humors, wherewith the whole body is fed and nourished.

If with this pain of the spleen through heat, be Agues and a red urine
adjoined; then are these cooling things to be used for it: to wit, Lettice,
Endive with their seed, Saunders, burnt Iuorie, the seeds of Melons,
Pompeons, Gourds, and of Cucumbers, Vinegar, and such like. Of compounded
things, the confection Trisantali, etc. These things following are temperate,
and not only good for the Milt or Spleen, but also for the Stomach, Liver,
Gall, and for all inward parts, as Cammomill, Melilot, Lilly roots, Burrage,
water Lillies, Fumitorie, Maidenhaire, and Hares tongue.

But to proceed methodically, then is the patient first to use these things
following: Take Caper roots, rindes of Tamariscus, the innermost green rinds
of the Ash tree, and the blossoms of Broom, of each one ounce, Endive,
Purslaine, small Endive, Maidenhaire, of each one handful, the seeds of
Pompeons, of Cucumbers, of Gourds, and the seed of Melons, of each one ounce,
Honey three ounces, Sugar nine ounces: let the foresaid roots be steeped a whole
night in Vinegar, then afterward make a sirupe thereof, and give two or three
ounces of it (according as the cause requires) with Endive water, and that for
the space of four or five days in the morning fasting. For this are also
these Sirupes good, to wit, the sirupe of vinegar, of Oxymel simplex and
Compositum, Oxysacchara, Vinegar of Squils, and his Oxymel, Acetosus,
Diarrhodon, de Fumo Terrae, de Epithymo, de Pomis, de Duabus, and 5. Radicibus,
of Burrage, and of Buglosse, of each half an ounce, Currants one ounce, Annis
one quarter of an ounce, Polipodie roots half a dragme: sees the foresaid
all together in sufficient water, until there remain about four ounces:
Steep therein a whole night Mirobalani Indi, then wring them well out, and
drink it blood warm early in the morning.

You may also for both of them in stead of the Mirobalani, temper amongst it
one quarter of an ounce of the confection of Seen leaves, or Hiera Picra. Also
this following may be used to purge withal: Take Confectionis Hamech, half an
ounce, or Diaphoeniconis three quarters of an ounce. Item, pills of Indie,
called Pillulas Indas one dragme: the Seen leaves may also be well taken, but
hereafter follows a briefer, safer, and a more meet way.

Take the confection of Seen leaves, and temper it (according to the strength
and age of the party) with Rubarbe and Burrage water; give it him warm
fasting, and afterward use these Pills.

Take Ammoniacum one dragme, Tamariscus, Hearts tongue, and the seed of Agnus
castus, of each half a scruple: make nine pills thereof with the sirupe of
Vinegar, whereof the patient is to take a little for the space of eight days
together before supper, and one or twain after supper, and then afterward
take this potion.

Take the water of Tamariscus, of Hearts tongue, and Cicorie, of each one ounce
and a half, Vinegar of Squils one quarter of an ounce, white Sugar half an
ounce, then temper them together: this are you thus to drink in the morning
fasting, and then take of the foresaid pills twain, and so continue it during
the space of ten days. But especially you are to use the potion, for it is the
most forcible medicine for the Spleen that may be found.

In like manner is this also exceedingly commended: Take the whay of milk,
steep Hearts tongue, Epithymum and Calmus in it, and so let it stand a whole
night: afterward you may sees this a little while, and drink often thereof.
Likewise the seed of Purslaine, Calmus, and the roots of Cicorie, of each a
like quantity: is very good being taken with the sirupe of Vinegar.

Of those things which convey the medicine toward the Milt.
IT is of no small importance to know the use of those things which may convey
the preparatiue and purgative medicines toward the Spleen, like as has been
said elsewhere: This does Tamariske, Hearts tongue, Caper roots, Mather, burnt
Squils, Scordium, wild yellow Rapeseede, Nep, Spica of Indie, Calmus, Ireos,
Horehound, Wormwood, Agrimonie, Annis, Fennel, Cuscuta, the seed of Agnus
castus, small Germander, and bitter Almonds.

When as then the sick body has been purged, the Milt vein is to be opened:
or if the melancholicke humors do abound, then is the Liver vein to be opened,
for that this melancholic humor does mix it self with the blood. Some
advise, and that not without reason, that Leches should be set in the fundament
on the Pyle veins, because that by nature they do draw out the black blood.
For a strengthening and allaying of the heat, this following is to be given,
as confected Peaches, Cicorie roots with Vinegar, conserve of Roses, of water
Lillies, of Cicorie, and of Violets.

For his drink, is allowed him otherwhiles a draught of Cherrie wine; for it
is (as is oftentimes said) altogether temperate, and do moisten the dried
Spleen and the inward parts. Every such patient is to beware of all sweet and
gross Wine, which is showed before in the first Part.

Of the impostume of the Spleen.. 2.
THis impostume may be caused out of blood, of Phlegma, Cholera, and
Melancholia, as also of winds and obstruction. The outward occasions may be
blows, falls, great labor, and chiefly by that which happens in the heat,
whereby the blood is burned: Item, of gross meats which make gross blood.

The common signs of all impostumes of the Milt are pain, heaviness, and
swelling of the left side, which stretches it out from the bowels even to the
shoulder blade, and sometimes it brings also with it a healing breath.

All the sour humors do bring with them their proper sign like as is already
rehearsed, and for to remedy this present infirmity, this is the right way.

First of all you are to let him blood on the Liver vein in the left elbow,
and afterward in the Milt vein upon the left hand besides the small finger,
and if so be that the patient may abide it, then let the blood run until it
staunch of it self.

With purging, eating, and drinking is he to be kept, like as it is said in the
twelfth Chapter of the Liver. Otherwise is this following very commodious: to
wit, distilled water of Purslaine, Maidenhaire, Willow leaves, Hearts tongue,
Nightshade, of Smallage, and of Endive, of which one will, (alone or tempered
together) and then the roots of Capers beaten very small and tempered amongst
it. You may also boil the foresaid herbs, and use the decoction of them
tempered with the sirupe of Vinegar. The first four or five days the Milt is
to be anointed with this salve following: Take oil of Roses one ounce and a
half, oil of Cammomill and Vinegar, of each half an ounce, then temper it
together. The second of third day temper amongst it half an ounce of the juice
of Nighshade. The first day use this following: take oil of Roses, Cammomill,
and the juice of Wormwood, of each a like much, anoint it very warm, and lay
it upon a warm cloth. Then lay this plaster following upon it: Take Barley
meal, powned Hollihock roots, of each two ounces, Roses, red and white
Saunders, of each three dragmes, roots of Endive one ounce, Vinegar, and water
of Hearts tongue, as much as is needful for to make a mild plaster.

When as then the patient is letten blood, purged, and has drunken the
foresaid water certain days together, he is to purge again with Cassie, and
with Epithymo: but if the impostume be of cold (which chances very seldom)
then may it be known, for that it is very soft, white, and without pain. But
if the same be caused through Melancholia, then does the same show it self
hard, with small pain, and then may you use that Oxymel compositum or Oxymel
of Squils, with water wherein the roots of Capers, Tamariscus, Hearts tongue,
and such like be decocted. Concerning the purging of Melancholia, you shall
shortly hereafter find perfect instructions.

Of an obstructed Milt without Ague, but yet with pain.. 3.
FOr this is chiefly commended the Tamariscus, and yet about this, Hearts tongue,
Caper roots, Honey suckles, which have altogether a marvelous power for to
assuage the swelling of the Spleen. In like manner, Centorie, Valerian, and
Meu, or in stead thereof, the roots of wild Dill.

These are the principal things which may be used for the foresaid disease.
Again, these things following are good for to warm the cold spleen: as
Aristologie, the middlemost rinds of the Ashen tree, Broom roots, Burrage,
Buglosse, Ammoniack, Rue, Thyme, Epithymus, bitter Almonds, the water of the
Ash tree leaves, Annis, Fennel, Caraway, Ameos, Parsley roots, the roots of
Smallage, of Sperage, Squils, and their vinegar, seed of Agnus castus, Lupins,
Bdellium, and Beuercod. Of the compounded things are the Confections of
Diacapparis, Diacalamintha, Diacyminum, confected Carawaies, and Comin, very
god also. And albeit, that according to the opinion of Galen and others this
obstruction of the Milt when the same waxes old, is thought incurable: yet do
ye successors nevertheless think that it is very curable, although the
obstruction of the foresaid Milt, and the hardness of the same had continued
three or four years. For which they do first give things to open the spleen:
to wit, one dragme of Mithridate, water of Sage two ounces, and that betimes in
the morning, whereupon they require one to fast four hours after. Item, take
Squils and Oxymel, of each one ounce, sirupe de Eupatorio half an ounce, water
of Valerian two ounces and a half: give it him warm in the morning. Or take
Maidenhaire, Politrichum, and Hearts tongue, of each four scruples, Madder,
Broom roots, of each two scruples, fresh Well water 24. ounces, Vinegar three
ounces, Licorice one dragme and a half; sees them afterward together by a
mild fire unto the half: the patient is to drink of this potion seven or
eight days together, every morning four ounces. The same is good and approved.

Secondly, it is to be considered, how that this obstruction is to be opened.
For this, it is good that one do take every morning early one quarter of an
ounce of washed Turpentine, and fast five or six hours upon it: Or in stead of
this, that he do swallow two or three pills made of Galbano.

Thirdly, if so be that this wind be caused through wind, (whereof we are to
speak more at large hereafter) then may one swallow half a dragme of
Ammoniacum made into pills. Other take Pillulas Aggregatiuas, and Ammoniacum, of
each half a dragme.

Fourthly, to the end that the bad humors may be expelled out of the Milt, give
the patient one ounce and a half of the juice of Horehound tempered with two
ounces of Smallage water, to drink early in the morning.

Fifthly, to the end that no grieuouser disease do strike into the Milt, and
that the schirrositie or hardness might be mollified and discussed, take
Hollihocke roots, and Swines bred, of each three handfuls, Bdellij, Ammoniaci,
of each half an ounce, Centory, Wormwood, Hearts tongue, and Tamariscus of each
one handful and a half, Vinegar six ounces; sees them all together in a pot
of Water, and steep a sponge therein, and lay it very warm on the left side:
when the place is then very warm, cover it with a woollen cloth which is made
wet before in steeled Vinegar, decocted water of Honey succles, and of
Tamariscus. And if so be that this swelling do not assuage thereby, then use
this plaster following.

Take the prepared marrow of an Ox, Badgers grease, and the oil of a Fox, of
each half an ounce, Tamariscus, Hearts tongue, Wormwood, Caper roots, Spica of
Indy, and Spica Romana, of each one dragme, Ammoniacum one ounce and a half,
Bdellium half an ounce, oil of Behen two ounces, Wax as much as is needful
for to make a plaster with it: then make it like to a half Moon, and lay it
on the left side: and then shall you see in short time that the hardness will
wear away.

Of hardness, or Schirrus of the Spleen.. 4.
ALthough the ancient Physicians were of opinion, that this hardening of the
Milt were not difficult to be healed at the first, but were in deed if the
same had long continued and were neglected, like as Galenus writes, that he
knew not how to cure it, neither had known any that could heal the same:
Nevertheless one must not despair, but administer freely unto it all strong
outward and inward remedies. For how much the longer that this accident
continues, so much the less vexation has the patient with it. But it is not
to be neglected: for this danger is with it; that if the same do inueterate,
then the patient might happen to fall into the Dropsy, whereby afterward they
commonly, one more, another less, happen to die with a laske or scouring.

The signs of this hardness are the same that herebefore in the 2.. and
afterward in the obstruction of the Spleen, are discovered. There is always a
heaviness in the left side: the whole body, and especially the face, gets an
ash-colored and il-fauoured color: all the members will be weak, as if they
were beaten in pieces. When the patient will do any exercise, then seems it
as if his breath would depart. The signs of the impostume of the Milt are also
described: yet the same may be well known by the feeling.

All that be sick of the Milt, will also be lean, very lither, out of courage,
do get heavy legs, a heavy tongue, and a thin urine.

If with the pain of the Milt, or the swelling and hardness of the same,
there be no Ague; then is the patient again in the beginning of the cure to
have a vein opened: and especially if it be discerned that the veins be full
of blood, then is the Saphea on the foot to be opened, and after certain
days the Milt vein on the left hand. Afterward are certain sirupes to be
used which do purge melancholy: For which this following, or such like is to be
prepared: Take Ireos, Fennel roots, and Parsley roots, of each one ounce and
a half, the inside of Squils one ounce, Capers roots, the green rinds of an
Ashen tree, and Broom roots, of each one ounce, Maidenhaire, Hearts tongue,
field Cipers, Germander, and Rosemarie flowers of each one handful, Annis,
Fennel, Cuscuta, Asarabacca, seeds of Purslaine, of each one dragme, Licorice
and Currants, of each ounce, Tamariscus, flowers of Burrage and of Buglosse, of
each half an ounce, Honey six ounces, Sugar nine ounces: make thereof a sirupe,
and use the same as has been said of others.

This following is to be prepared for a purgation: Take Burrage, Buglosse, and
Tamariscus flowers, of each half an ounce, Annis and Cuscuta, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Thyme, Epythimus and Agaricus of each an ounce, Currants
one ounce; sees these all together in ten ounces of water unto the half:
then take of this strained decoction three or four ounces, and temper therein
one quarter of an ounce of Hiera Picra, and also prepared Azure stone half a
dragme: or in stead of this, one dragme of Bolus prepared, temper them
together, and give it him early in the morning. Also you may make pills of the
other things without the water.

Another: Take Capers roots, Hearts tongue, Asarabacca, Lupines, Cipers roots,
and Endive, of each one quarter of an ounce, Epithymum half a dragm, Barley,
Prunes, Violets, of each three dragmes: let them sees all together. Lastly,
put the Epythimum and one quarter of Seen leaves unto it: then seethe it until
the third part be decocted. Then take four ounces of this decoction, and
temper therein half an ounce of fresh Cassie, beaten pills, of Azure stone one
scruple: last of all temper it together unto a potion. But if the patient had
rather use pills, then take pills De Lapide Armeno or Indo, one dragme at one
time. The Lupins sodden alone in water, should be also good for this.

But if this hardening of the Milt be of wind and cold, as it otherwhiles
befalls, it is thereby to be perceived: to wit, if one press upon it, that
then the wind will rumble. For this, amongst other things, may be given
Trocisci de Capparis, and to let the sick body drink old Wine: but water
must he wholly forbear. But if one will use water with it, then is the same
first to be steeled, and all his drink to be tempered with it, or any of these
things following to be decocted in it, as Rue, Costus roots, Cinnamom, Annis,
Spica of Indy, Squinant, etc.

We have also a little before declared, how that Ammoniacum is to be used: for
this is also good roasted Millet, Salt, and Comin laid warm upon it. Item,
boxing cups vnpickt set upon the Milt. But if it be discerned, that there be
any moisture in the Milt (which may be perceived by rumbling, if it be wrung
hard) then is the patient to be purged, as aforesaid. For this, is also good
the sirupe of Acetosus Compositus, and this fomentation following is to be used
with it: Take Annis, Fennel, Caraway, wild Thyme, Violets, flowers of Burrage,
Calmus, the roots of blew Flower-deluce, and Agrimonie, of each one ounce,
Cammomill one ounce and a half: let them sees all together in Vinegar, and
wet a sponge in this decoction, and keep it very warm upon the Milt before
meat; afterward lay one of these foresaid plasters upon it.

Above all those which we have hitherto rehearsed, there be yet mo good things,
whereof we will first discover the simples, as namely, Agaricus, which does
open al obstructions of the Milt and other parts, Seen leaves, Epithymus, and
black Hellebore, or Neesewoort, The compounded medicines be Pilulae Indae,
whereof we have spoken so often, which are worthy to be described here, which
be prepared as follows.

Take Mirobalani Indi, black Neesewoort, and Polipody roots, of each two
dragmes and a half, Thymus, Epithymus, Stechas, of each three dragmes,
Agaricus, washed Azure stone, Coloquint, Indy salt, or Sal gemmae, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Cloves half a dragme, powder of Hiera Picra Galeni, three
quarters of an ounce, the juice of Smallage as much as suffiseth for to make a
mass of pills. These pills are good for all melancholicke accidents, for the
Canker, for the Leapry, for all incurable black Impostumes, for all heaviness
of mind, the quartain Ague, yellow Iaundise, diseases of the Milt, and such
like. One may take a dragme at once of these pills. Item, take ten days
together the powder of Fearne roots one dragme and a half, augmenting it
still from day to day, to the weight of one dragme and a half.

Other do take of this foresaid powder one dragme, and of the pills Agregatiuae
half a drag. and temper them together. Item, take the juice of Wormwood four
ounces, Sugar as much as you please, and so use it ten days one after another.
It is also not only good for the Milt, but also for the yellow Iaundise; as
also for all moisture of the Liver, and for the dropsy. Item, for all
hardness and swelling of the same, being tempered with Vinegar and so drunken.

Master Tristrams water is also very meet for all diseases of the Milt, like
as be also the most of all golden waters which be described in the eight part.
Item, take Roses and Barberries, of each three dragmes, burnt Iuorie, Wormwood,
Cuscuta, Licorice, Mastick, and Squinant, of each one dragme and a half,
Endive seed, Fennel, Annis, Spica, Agrimonie, Opium, Asarabacca roots,
Costus roots, peeled Gourd seed, and Cucumber seeds, of each half a drag.
then make Trociskes thereof with Endive water. They be especial good for the
Milt, and also for the Liver.

For potions, he may take of these things following what he desires: as
namely, both kinds of Chamedryos, Hearts tongue, Maidenhaire, Seen leaves, Capers
roots, Tamarlske, roots of Parsley, Smallage, Fennel, Cinnamom, Licorice,
Currants, Annis, Fennel water, and of Caraway, wherein Thymus, and Epithymus be
decocted.

The order of Diet.
THis patient is to beware of cloudie and foggie weather, and of hard and
gross meats: his bread must be well baked, and be a day or two stale, but
unleavened bread is not good for him: also Annis, Coriander, and Fennel, are
to be baked in his bread. All field fowls, as Phesants, Partridges, young and
old turtle Doves, Kids, young Mutton dressed with vinegar, he may eat well, as
also rere Eggs.

Of all other herbs these are good for him: Mints, Parsley, Fennel, Garlic,
Leekes, all kind of Cresses, Sage, Hyssope, Radish, Endive, Agrimonie, red
Pease, and the first decoction of red Colewoorts. He must also eat oftentimes
Annis, Comin, Dill seed, Fennel seed, and the seeds of Sesamum, Capers,
Tamarisks, bitter Almonds, the kernels of Peach stones, and of Cherie stones:
for this is also good, the losinges of Comin, and of Annis. The milts of swine
are also to be eaten for the curing of the disease of the milt, and also the
milt of a sound horse dried and beaten to powder the weight of a dragme, take
of it with strong wine: for it is in like manner very requisite for this purpose.

But if so be that there be no heat, then may he choose some of these things
following for to drink: First, wine is not only permitted for this hardness of
the Milt, but also highly commended. Also all famous Physicians do advise, that
the patient must eat and drink in the wood of Tamariske: for they say that
only hereby many be helped who have gone twenty years with a hard Milt. But
if this Tamariske wood cannot be gotten, then are the shauings thereof to be
taken and laid in his drink. And if so be that one can continue this forty
days together, then he shall evidently see amendment. Ash wood does the same,
which has also the power of the Tamariske: Of Wines, white wine is always
most commended: if it be too strong then is it to be allayed with water that is
steeled, or with rain water, or the water of Hearts tongue. You have also
hereafter two kinds of good wines, which may be prepared for this use.

Take Seen leaves, Balm, Maidenhaire, and the rinds of Tamariske, of each six
handfuls, Polypodie roots four handfuls, prepared Coriander three ounces,
Guaiacum four ounces, eight or ten Nutmegs, Cloves half an ounce, Galingall
one ounce and a half, Citron pills one handful, shauings of Ash wood as much
as is needful, at the most sixteen quarts: make then an hearbed wine thereof,
and let the patient drink the first draught thereof in the morning and
evening. Another: Take the roots of Cicorie, rinds of Tamariske, Hearts tongue,
and the middle rinds of the Ash wood, of each one handful: power ten pots of
Must, or some other good wine, and use thereof as before.

And all other herbed wines which may be made, are at this present praised for
the Milt: as wine of Eyebright, wine of Tamariske, each made by it self, or
both together. Item, wine of Hyssope, of Marioram, and of Wormwood, do warm the
Milt and all inward parts: the wine of Gilloflowers, and of Betonie is also
good for this. Item, the Aromaticall wine, and mo other spiced wins, and also
the wine of Asarabacca. Reasonable exercise before meals is also much
commended: and sometimes to bath in water wherein the foresaid herbs be
decocted. To the contrary, he must eschew all troubled wines, as Must, Syder,
and Beer: for all such do not only obstruct the Milt, but also the Liver, the
Lights, and Kidneys: which obstructions be causes of many sicknesses.

For this disease is also hurtful Swines flesh, Milk, Cheese, Rice, Starch,
Pease, Beans, Services, Pears, Medlars, Quinces, Chestnuts, and Peaches:
therefore be they to be refrained.

We will also note some things, wherewith the sick party, and the Milt, with
all other inward parts are to be strengthened. Amongst which, is de Miua
Cydoniorum aromatica one of the chief.

Item, this confection following, if that heat and cold be mixed together:
Take Venus hair, Hearts tongue, of each half an ounce, Ammoniacum one quarter of
an ounce, Tamariscus one ounce, seeds of Agnus castus, and of broad Plantaine,
Aristologie roots, Agrimony, Wormwood and Squinant, of each one dragme and a
half, Laudanum one dragme, seed of Purslaine, Sorrel, Endive, and wild
Endive, of each two dragmes and a half, Oxymel of Squils six ounces, water
Lillies, Violet seeds, and of Mallows, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar
eight ounces. Seethe the Sugar with Vinegar of Squils until it be as thick as
honey: when it is cold, then mix the rest amongst it, with the water of Maiden
hair: afterward seethe it again with vinegar of Squils until it be as thick
as honey: when it is cold, then mix the rest amongst it, with the water of
Maiden hair. Afterward, seethe it again until all the water be decocted:
when it is then sodden and well brayed, then use every morning three dragmes of
it. If you had rather drink it, then temper it with Sorrel water: it is a
marvelous good medicine.

Another Confection. Take Mirobalani Indi, and Bellirici, flowers of Burrage,
Buglosse, Elecampane roots, and Folefoote leaves, of each one dragm, seeds of
Endive, of Lettice, small Endive, and Sorrel, of each one dragme, peeled Melon
seed, Pompeon, Cucumbers, and peeled Gourd seeds, of each one dragme and a
half, Pingles and Pistacia, of each two ounces, sirup of Vinegar four ounces.
Sugar three ounces, sour Dates one ounce and a half: make a confection
thereof, and take thereof every morning before meat, as much as the quantity
of a Nutmeg. This confection is very forcible to cunsume all melancholicke
humors and matters: it opens the spleen, strengthens the stomach and the
heart, and deopilateth also all obstructions. Item, Nutmegs, Walnuts, roots of
Eringus, and Elecampane, all confected, be very meet for this disease.

Amongst the Conserues, are the Conserues of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of
Lauander, of Spike, of Marioram, Sage, Hyssope, Eyebright, and of Fumitorie,
and all that may be made of these foresaid herbs very good. Likewise also both
the Treacles, and Mithridate. Item, you have more in the first part, the 12.
Chapter, and first. a good gross powder which is meet for this. Capers eaten
with Vinegar, roots of Smallage with the herb, and Dill, are also good. And
let this suffice for the order of Diet.

Here follows now what is outwardly to be used.
THis powder following is always about the fourth day to be strewed upon the
head the weight of four grains; and one may use it with much furtherance as
long as he lives: Take Roses, burnt Iuorie, white and red Coral, of each one
scruple, Mace four scruples, Cloves half a dragme, Lignum Aloes two scruples,
then make a small beaten powder with it.

A bag for the breast: Species de Xilo Aloes, Laetificans Almanforis, of each
five dragmes: put these in a red crimson silk bag, and wear it on the left
breast. Concerning the oils and salues are these most meet: Oil of Brickes
is very good for all diseases of the spleen. Item, the oil of Bayberries, of
bitter Almonds, of Spikenard, of Wormwood, Galingall, and of Capers. For all
kinds of Salve may you make this following: vz. oil of Lillies, Almonds,
Capers, and the marrow of all kind of beasts, Saffron, Vinegar, Gum, Wax,
muscilage of Hollihocke roots, of Linseede, and of Fenegreeke seed.

The salve of Hollihocke roots, Vnguentum Altheae, (which is well known to
all Apothecaries) is also highly commended for this disease, the description
whereof immediately ensues: Take the roots of Mallows, of Hollihockes, of
Lillies, Onions, Squils, Linseede, Fenegreeke seed, Figs, and Raisins, of each
half an ounce: powne them all together, and then steep it a whole night in
strong Vinegar: afterward sees them all in water, and then stamp it to pap.
This being done, mingle therewith the salve of Althea two ounces, Ducks grease,
Calves marrow, and unsalted butter, of each one ounce, oil of sweet Almonds
four ounces, Wax as much as is needful for to make a salve.

For this is also good the salve Marciaton, and Cerotum de Hyssopo Philagrij.
This following is a special good salve for the Spleen: Take the juice of wild
Cucumbers, and of Swines bred, of each four ounces, put them in a glass, and
the salve of Althea, oil of Capers, and fresh Butter, of each two ounces; let
them seethe the space of four hours in hot water: strain it afterward
through a cloth, and afterward put Ammoniacum unto it dissolved in the juice
of Swines bred one quarter of an ounce, Wax as much as is needful for to
make a salve therewith.

And because that this salve cannot be made every where by reason of the juice,
this following may be used: Take oil of sweet Almonds six ounces, Neats feet
oil two ounces, fresh Butter one ounce, the juice of Bryonie and Tamariske, of
each two ounces: put this in a special pot, and let it seethe in boiling water
unto the half: put afterward unto it the roots of Capers, Tamariske, Agnus
castus, and Hearts tongue, of each one quarter of an ounce, molten white Wax one
ounce: then make a salve of it.

Another. Take oil of Capers three ounces, Cammomill one ounce and a half,
Hearts tongue, roots of Capers, Endive, wild Endive, and Lettice seed, of each
half a dragme, seeds of Agnus castus, and Wax, as much as suffiseth for to
make a plaster or salve: lastly, stir a little Vinegar amongst it. This salve
is very good for the Milt in hot and also in cold causes: it mollifieth all
hardness, expels all winds and all impostumes of the same.

Now for to lay somewhat upon it, boil Rue in strong Vinegar, and make a
woollen cloth wet in it: wring out the same, and so lay it warm over it.

Item, there stands the like a little before: Take the roots of Mallows, etc.
and that which is written shortly after it, even to the salve Althea, and what
further follows: seethe them all in water of Cammomill, and lay it warm with
a bag over the Milt: it helps marvelous well.

Take Oxymel six ounces, Caper roots one ounce, Wormwood half an ounce,
beat them small together: afterward make a woollen clout wet in it, and lay
it so upon it.

Hereafter follow certain plasters: Take Ammoniacum three quarters of an
ounce, Bdellium one ounce and a half: dissolve them in vinegar of Squils,
Tamariscus half a dragme, Hearts tongue, Dill seed, and Agnus castus seed, of
each two scruples, broad Plantaine seed half a dragme, Wax one quarter of an
ounce, and Rosin as much as is needful therewith to make a plaster.

Another: Take Tamariscus, Hearts tongue, seed of Agnus castus, and of broad
Plantaine, of each two scruples, Ammoniacum and Bdellium, of each three
dragmes. You are to dissolve both these Gums in vinegar of Squils, and when
they be cold, then mix the other things amongst it, beaten small. The same does
also the Ammoniacum alone dissolved in sharp vinegar, and spread upon a cloth
and so laid thereon. Other do dissolve this Gum in the juice of Swines bred,
for then it is more forcible, as is herebefore admonished. Item, take oil of
Lillies, also of the flowers of blew Flowers de luce, and of Capers, of each
one ounce, Barley meal, Lineseed meal, and Fenegreeke meal, of each one
dragme, Bdellium, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, of each one dragme and a half,
Opopanacum, Myrrh and Frankincense, of each half a dragme. Make this all
together with molten Wax and Rosin unto a plaster, then spread it upon a
cloth, and use it as all the rest. Item, take Rue leaves one quarter of an
ounce, Boreas and Nep, of each three dragmes, Ammoniacum seven dragmes,
dissolve them in old Wine, and make a plaster of it, it mollifieth, heals,
and expels windines. Or take Ammoniacum, Bdellium, and Pitch of each one
ounce and a half, Trociscos de Capparis, white Mustard seed, Sulphur, wild
Garlic, and Cow dung, of each one dragme, Muscilage of Fenegreeke, and of
Linseede, of each one quarter of an ounce: powne all them that be to be powned:
then first dissolve the Gum in strong vinegar, and work them one amongst
another: but first of all anoint your hands with the oil of Barberries.

Another: Take the muscilage of Fenegreeke, and of Lineseede, of each one
ounce, the grease of Hens, Geese, and Duckes, of each three ounces, washed
Butter, Swines grease, Neates feet oil, of each one quarter of an ounce,
beaten Tamariscus, Willow leaves, Hearts tongue, the middle rind of the Ash tree,
Capers roots, Rue leaves, and Nep, of each one dragme, oil of Capers one
ounce and a half, a little Wax and Vinegar: then make a plaster or salve of
it.

Item, take an Onion, cut off a piece at the top, and make it hollow within,
and fill it with oil of Lillies, and let it rest uncovered in the ashes, so
long till it have soked up all the oil: afterward stamp it, and lay it warm
over it.

All these plasters following are also good for it: as namely, De Meliloto,
Diachilon magnum, De Muscilaginibus, and others. Take of the plaster De
Muscilaginibus two ounces, Ammoniacum dissolved in Vinegar, and Marcasite
beaten small, of each five dragms: temper it on the fire, and spread it on a
leather cut after the fashion of a half Moon, and so lay it warm upon the
spleen, it is very good, and approved. We have promised herebefore to describe
the salues of Dialthea. It is also made after sundry fashions, like as we
shall also teach here: Take clean Hollihock roots eight ounces, Linseede and
Fenegreeke seed, of each four ounces, Sallad oil sixteen ounces, Turpentine
half an ounce, Rosin one ounce and a half: the roots and also the seeds
shall you steep three days and three nights in a quart of water; the fourth
day sees them so long, until they yield from them a thick tough slime or
muscilage: wring them hard out, and take eight ounces thereof, and sees it
with the oil until all the moisture be decocted. Afterward put the
Turpentine, Rosin, and four ounces of Wax unto it. When all these things be
molten and well tempered, then take it from the fire, and stir it well about
until it be cold.

The second: Take eight ounces of fair sliced Hollihocke roots, Linseede, and
Fenegreeke, seed, of each four ounces, stamp them, and wring them thorough as
before: then put unto it four ounces of Barrowes grease, two beaten Onions,
one ounce and a half of Gummi Arabicum, and let them sees all together until
that all the moisture be decocted: afterward take four ounces of molten Wax,
and then temper them together, and stir it well about until it be through
cold.

The third: Take fair cleansed Hollihocke roots twelve ounces, choppe it very
small, and power two quarts of water into it, six ounces of Linseed, three
ounces of Fenegreeke seed, and three ounces of Lilly roots: then powne them
all together, and when they be boiled to a tough slime or muscilage, then
strain them thorough a cloth, and take twelve ounces of it, and sees the same
with 24. ounces of Barrowes grease until the juice be all decocted: afterward
put unto it four ounces of Wax, Fenegreeke meal two ounces, Galbanum
dissolved in Vinegar, Gummi Hederae, and Turpentine, of each one ounce. But if
you cannot get the foresaid Gum, then take three ounces of Turpentine, and
temper them all together as before: this salve is good for all swellings, for
the shrinking of the sinews, for all tumors of the breasts: it loses
phlegm, asswageth the Cough and all stitches in the sides, as also the pain
in the Raynes, of the gravel, and is good for all extenuations.

The fourth and last: Take fresh Hollihocke roots twelve ounces, Linseede and
Fenegreeke seed, of each six ounces, Squilles three ounces, Sallad oil 24.
ounces, yellow Wax six ounces, Turpentine, Gummi Hederae, and Galbanum, of
each one ounce and a quarter, Colophonia and Rosin, of each three ounces: powne
all that is to be powned, and let it steep together three days in water:
afterward sees them all together, and strain them thorough a cloth, and then
take four and twenty ounces of the muscilage thereof, and let them sees all
together on a soft fire with the foresaid oil until all the moisture be
decocted: afterward put Wax unto it, and then a little of the Gum, and
lastly the Colophonie and Rosin. When it is boiled enough, then stir it well
about, and let it cool.

Of the Melancholia and moisture of the Spleen.. 5.
FOr as much as the Spleen (as is said) is the true receptacle of the black
and melancholicke blood; therefore reason requires that we should write of what
nature the same is, whereby other things may also be discerned which be
incident to the Milt. First, we have in the first part, the 12. chap. and 8..
described many kinds of causes of Melancholy, and in other places more,
especially in the beginning of the former. and taught of the Milt, of her
beginning, causes, and what hurt might proceed thereof: to wit, if the same
got the masterie, that there may follow not only heaviness of mind, frighting,
and such like: but also it might deprive the whole body of his lively color,
and cause also black ulcers, leaprie, the canker, quartaine agues, and such
like: and lastly, all manner of distraction of the mind, raging madness, and
inhumane beastliness. Therefore, because this book every where makes mention
of them, it is not needful to discourse more at large thereof at this present.
But we will only describe certain remedies which be fit for it.

Wherefore it is first to be noted, that all preparatiue and purgative things
are to be used, that the matter may be avoided through going to the stool, and
not through vomiting, by reason that these melancholic humors are very
ponderous and heavy, and will not be expelled but only downwards.

Before we then come to any particular remedies, we will first discover what
simples there be that do prepare these melancholicke humors, and whereby the
same may be expelled, viz. Burrage, Buglosse, Thymus, Epithymus, Capers roots,
Tamariscus, Hearts tongue, good Wine, bathing in sweet Water, Licorice, Currants,
Polipody roots, grass, Chamedryos, Cuscuta, Asarabacca, Gentian, Lupines,
Fumitorie, Calmus, Spicanardi, Agnus castus, bitter Almonds, Cicorie,
Rosemarie, Radish seed, Burnet, sea Crabs, and above all a cheerful courage
or light heart.

The compounded medicines are Oxymel of Squils, honey of Roses, sirupe of
Vinegar, Sirupus acetosus, compositus de Fumo terrae, and other more. But
chiefly this following is to be prepared for it: Take Cicorie, Rosemarie,
Burnet, Hops, Cincfoile, Endive with the roots, Fumitorie, the roots of
Buglosse, Burrage flowers, Liuerwoort, Chamedryos, field Cipers, Capers roots,
Tamariscus roots, and Hearts tongue with the roots, of each two ounces, Prunes,
and Sebestes, of each twenty or five and twenty, Seen leaves, Cuscuta, Thymus,
wild Thyme, and Fennel of each half an ounce, Licorice, Raisins, Stechas, of
each two ounces; Sees them all together in three pints of water even to the
half: add to this decoction (being strained) Buglosse, and the juice of
Prunes, of each eighteen ounces, Sugar four and twenty ounces, Honey of Roses
six ounces: let them sees to a sirupe.

These things following are reputed for such as expel Melancholy and do
purge, viz. Epithymus, Mirobalani Indi, Chebuli, Polypody roots, prepared
Esulus, Bolus, mountain Mints, Cassie, Seen leaves, Fumitory, Honey suckles,
Hops, black Neesewoort, Indy salt, wild Saffron seeds, Sal gemmae. The
compounded medicaments are Diasena, Hiera Ruffi, Hiera logodion, and such like.
Item, take Seen leaves, Thymus, Epithymus, Cuscuta, and Burrage flowers, of
each one ounce, Annis, Fennel, and Smallage seed, of each half an ounce,
Hearts tongue, Maiden hair, Chamedryos, and Agrimonie, of each one handful; let
them all sees well, and take thereof four ounces; steep therein Mirobalani
Indi, half an ounce, and Chebuli three dragmes all the night: afterward
strain it well out, and temper therewith Diasena, three dragmes, Cassia one
ounce, washed azure stone two scruples: give the same unto him in the morning,
and there may less thereof be given at once. When as melancholy appears,
then is the Liver vein to be opened; for that surpasses al other things: and
the same is to be done more then once, and that always according to the
ability and strength of the patient. Item, care must be taken to open the
piles, be it with rubbing, with the Launcet, or lastly with Leaches.

For this it is also very needful that this patient be often purged: but he
must first always use some kind of sirupe as is herebefore expressed. Also he
must use according as the cause requires, the sirupe of Burrage, of Buglosse,
Apples, de Epithymo, and Diarrhodon, of Cicorie, Wormwood, of Roses, honey of
Roses, Oxymel, and sirupe of Vinegar.

And for to purge, he must take Mirobalani Indi, Chebuli, and Citrini, of each
half an ounce, the outward rinds of the black Neesewoort three dragmes; powne
them together very small, and sees them in sufficient water: strain it, and
put into this decoction Epithymum, Thyme, Polipodie roots, and Seen leaves, of
each three quarters of an ounce, the seeds of Citrons one quarter of an ounce;
then sees them again unto the half, and so let it stand all a night:
afterward strain it out, and wring it hard, and put as much Sugar unto it as
you think meet. This being done, sees it again, and clarify it with the
white of an Egg. Lastly, temper amongst it the sirupe of Citron pills one
ounce, and drink four or five ounces of it early in the morning.

But this is here to be noted, that if this sirupe be given to any body that
is infected with the Pox, the same party is first to be purged with the
confection called Lenitiua, mixing with it three dragmes Confectionis Hamech.
Afterward, give unto him this Sirupe following, and then the decoction of
Guaiacum, whereof we shall write hereafter more at large.

This patient must often before meat take Cassia, for it cleanses the blood,
and takes away the sharpnes of it.

For this, are meet also the Pillulae Indae Aggregatiuae, and De Lapide Lazuli.

Item, Seen leaves steeped in Henbroth, strewed with a little Cinnamom; or Seen
leaves steeped in Whay. Item, the same boiled with the flowers of Burrage, of
Buglosse, of Balm, and with the roots of Parsley.

The Seen leaves may also be steeped with Wormwood and with Wine: and it is
good during the space of a whole month always every other day, to drink two
or three ounces of the decoction or infusion of Seen leaves, both which are
described in the eleventh Chapter the 20.. and temper amongst it two ounces of
the laxatiue sirupe of Roses: the decoction of Seen leaves as much: use this
fasting. You have also herebefore a powder for to purge melancholy, and two
kinds of Confections, Diaturbith, cum Rhabarbaro.

Item, whay wherein Epithymus has been infused, or Polypody roots have been
decocted, does more prepare to purge.

How the melancholicke blood is to be purged.. 6.
AMongst all these foresaid medicines, there be diverse which do cleanse the
blood. And the drift of all Physicians in this sickness is, that all the heavy,
black, and unclean blood might be purged, diminished, and corrected. Howbeit,
there is somewhat else which is here to be signified: to wit, for this does
Venus or Maidenhaire first serve, that educeth all bad humors and slime out of
the Liver, makes good color, lengtheneth the breath, cleanses the stomach,
the liver, and the milt, and also breaks the stone.

Item, take the whay of Goats milk, steep Fumitorie in it, or mix the juice
of the herb amongst it, and drink of it certain days ensuing other at each
time a good draught: or in the stead thereof, take the Sirupe or Conserve of
the same herb, for both of them be very good. Also, make pills of powned
Masticke, and the juice of Wormwood.

There be also certain Wines for the cleansing of the blood prepared, as
hereafter ensues: Take Currants three common pounds, Maidenhaire five ounces
and one quarter of an ounce, black prepared Hellebore two ounces and a half,
and one dragme of Polipodie, and Hermodactili, of each four ounces, prepared
Coriander, and Seen leaves, of each five ounces and one dragme and a half,
Pockwood six pound, rinds of the same eighteen ounces. These being all well
beaten together, then power thereon two alms of Must, and half an alme of
Well water: then let them stand and work together at the fire about six days
space, stirring it well every day about. When it is settled the space of three
days, and fallen down, then strain it out clear, and keep it until
occasion serve to use it. Of this foresaid wine must the patient drink at
meals in the stead of other wine the space of two months, or at least every
other day. This opens the body very easily, and therewith expels all
gross humors and Cholera out of the body. And if this wine cannot be brooked
by it self, then may the same be tempered with other common wine drunken
moderately. It expels melancholy, and all heaviness of mind: it makes
merry, and of good cheer.

In like manner of all herb wines these are highly commended for this sickness:
viz. wine of Burrage, Buglosse, and of Hearts tongue, and of Tamariske; which not
only take away melancholic humors, but do withstand the quartaine Ague which
is caused by them.

Of Confections you may use Diarrhodon Abbatis, Aromaticum Rosatum, and
Dyanthos. Likewise Conserve of Violets, of Roses, of Buglosse, and of
Rosemarie. Treacle and Mithridate, taken the weight of one dragme, is very
commodious for this: for that they do both diminish melancholy, and take away
the heaviness of the mind, fear, and such like, that may proceed of Melancholy.

The confected Citron pills do repugne all melancholicke accidents. Confected
Nutmegs do make fresh blood. For meats in stead of other sauce, Sugar is to be
used.

We have before discovered, that bathing in sweet water is very profitable. So
are also boxing cups set vnpickt upon the sides, whereby to extract all
windiness.

You are also to use the gross powder, which in the first Part, the 12.
Chapter, and 1.. is described, which is ordained for the memory.

The fifteenth Chapter. Of the Bowels or Guts.
LIke as we have hitherto described the Stomach, the Liver, the Gall, and the
Spleen, and made full declaration thereof: so will we now discourse of the
next adjacent parts, before that we come to the Kidneys: to wit, of the bowls
or guts, and all that concerns them. We affirm then that beneath the stomach
the Bowels have their beginning, which are parted in six parts. The three
first and uppermost are very subtle and thin; for which cause they be called
in Latin Gracilia intestina, into the which one part of ye digested meats are
conveyed. The other three sorts of the bowels be the undermost, which are more
thicker and fleshlier than the three uppermost, whereby the sharpness and
hardness of the Stercora should the less bruise them. And these six sorts of
bowels have their name given them by reason of their greatness, and property
of their operations, and not for that they be six several things: for they
hold fast one upon another, so that they may rightly be taken for one Gut,
which is placed in the belly after a wonderful manner with many kind of
crookes and windings about, and reaches from the stomach even to the
fundament. And to speak particularly thereof, the first which begins at the
stomach is called of the Latinists Duodenum, and that for this cause, because
it is twelve fingers breadth long. The second (which Galenus calls the first)
they do name Ieiunum, which is the empty gut, because it is always empty.
This gutte has some crookes and turnings: afterward, it does reach forth
straight out even to the Liver. The third is by the Grecians called Ileon, and
by the Latinists Voluulus, which is the winding gut; not only for that by his
length it twisteth and windeth about, but also for this cause (as the learned
write) because there be engendered in this gut great Chollicke and gripings,
which do draw hither and thitherwards through their great pains, as now in one,
and then in an other place they be most violently perceived. Thus are these
three (as is said) thin and subtle of substance, differing only herein,
that Ileon is not found always empty, like as the two former. The fourth
gutte which they do call Coecum, that is, the blind, and Monoculum, being the
annexed gutte, which they do call Coecum, for that it seems that it has but
one going out or issuing: whereas notwithstanding the Anatomists do attribute
twain unto it: we will call it also the bag, for that it is like to a fat
stomach: yet somewhat less, and better to receive all that must be avoided
through going to stool. The fifth is Colon, and by the Latinists called Crassum
intestinum. This gut is fleshier than any of all the rest: also of a reasonable
length and crookednes, in the which, and especially in the end of it, the meat
is converted to dung: which (before and ere that it is digested) the learned do
call Chylum. In this foresaid gut does the Cholicke properly engender. The last
gut is Intestinum rectum, which is the Arsegut, that is called Longanum, for
that it does not crook, and stretches to the end of the fundament. These are
now the lower guts, and they be otherwhiles called the lower belly. But what
each sort of these bowels have for a nature, property, power, virtue and
operation, were here to long, and contrary to our purpose to decipher, because
we do not here think to discourse of any thing, but only the cures of the
diseases that the bowels or guts are subject unto.

Of the pain and griping of the Guts in general.. 1.
IN both these sorts of the guts come great outward gripings, stitches, and
pain, whereof there be two sorts: the one Iliaca, the other Cholica, Iliaca is
in the uppermost small guts, and Cholica in the undermost bowels: which sorts
of pains or stitches receive their names of the bowels, or the bowels of these
foresaid gripings or sickness. And because that in both these sorts of pains of
the bowels the remedies are alike, whereas in other diseases they be greatly
differing, therefore we will treat of both these severally. Afterward we will
also determine of the Worms in the bowels, of all other diseases which are to
be ascribed to the bowels, as of all the scourings, of bloody flixe, and
obstructions, etc. whereof we have heretofore discoursed, etc. where be many
kinds of things to be found for the pain of the guts.

Of the uppermost pain and griping of the Guts Iliaca Passio, which the common
man calls Cholica.. 2.
ILeos, or Iliaca Passio, are gripings or stitches in the uppermost small guts,
which be caused of some obstruction or swellings of the guts, whereby the
congested filth or corruption cannot fall down into the great guts: whereby
such great intolerable pain, sickness, and gripings do ensue, that the guts
seem to be bored thorough with a bodkin, and that commonly with a continual
vomiting and parbraking: yet not in all patients.

Therefore, if so be that this pain, pricking, and obstruction do get the
maisterie; then does there follow it a stinking belching, yea a parbraking of
all filthiness and of ordure through the mouth, and that by reason that the
stopping beneath is so great, that neither ordure nor wind can euacuate
beneath: neither can it be opened through Clisters, whereby it must needs
follow, that all the belchings do draw the wind and filth upwards, and must
lastly be avoided through the mouth.

Certain learned men do dispute of these causes, and that not without reason:
for some do think, that it is not the right ordure which is eiected by the
mouth, but that it should be only a certain filthy and corrupted meat which
lies stinking in the stomach, because the same cannot be expelled: but be it
how it will, this sickness is nevertheless so terrible and painful, that certain
ancient Physicians do call the same Domine miserere, Lord have merry upon me.

And it is a grievous sickness indeed: for besides all that is said, if it come
with a great heat, then it does commonly cause an impostume in the bowels,
whereby comes the crampe, and the contracture of the sinews, so that the
sick person thereby does lose his senses and runs mad.

These and other signs which shall hereafter follow, are so deadly, that
scarcely ever any one recouereth his health again.

The common people which have no understanding of natural things which
pertain to man's body, do call this Iliaca, the Mother in men, like as the
common people in Italy do call it Paron, which is, Father, whereas
notwithstanding men have no mother in them.

The causes of this Iliaca passio, are inward and outward, the outward may be
through falls, thrusts or strokes on these places: or through drinking of much
cold water, through much binding, gross meats, as hard Cheese, Cow beef, or
any other hard flesh which is not well sodden or roasted, salt Porke, and
principally of ill boiled wood Pigeons, or meats which he swallowed down not
well chewed. Item, there be mo things which be hurtful for this sickness; as
Pease, Beans, Medlars, Quinces, Seruises, Pears, Sloes, and such like binding
fruits. For this pain of the belly is commonly more rife in harvest, when
fruits are found most abundant, than at any other time of the year. These
sicknesses may also be caused of cold and piercing winds, as the Northren
winds: as also to the contrary, out of great heat and great labor: and
lastly, through venime taken: The inward causes commonly proceed from other
parts: as if there be any impostume present, whether it be in the Bowels or in
the Liver, or in the sucking veins called Venae Mesaraicae, in the Kidneys, or
in the Bladder, or when the Bowels thorough some vapor fall down into the
priuities. If so be that the cause be in the bowels, thereof there be six: to
wit, if the gut Ileon or Colon be too hot or too cold, or be fraughted with any
cold tough matter, or through wind, or obstructed with some hard corruption, or
when the bowels be full of wreathed worms: lastly, this disease may also be
caused through faintness of the expulsive or strength of the retentiue virtue.

Concerning the signs, they may be demanded of the sick persons or standers
by. But if there be any impostume in any other parts, it may be known by the
place affected where the impostume is. The hot impostumes of the guts are
discerned by the continual agues, thirst, and panting or beating of the same
part; whereas to the contrary the cold impostumes be without great pain and
without agues, but only with a kind of heaviness and tumor: and these commonly
assail a man that is accustomed to use much cold and moist meats, as milk,
fish, and such like. If this sickness be caused through the obdurated corruption
of the bowels, then is there with it an extreme pain, so that it seems to
the patient that his bowels are cut up, and that chiefly if he have taken
before any such things as may cause these bindings, and harden the filth or
corruption, as inward or outward heat, and through use of dry things. Or if
this disease come through wind, then does the pain depart from one place unto
another, with a kind of rumbling, and that with such stitches, as if the bowels
were pricked through with auls. And if the same be caused of cold slime, then be
cold rheumes felt, and such like in the bowels, and that chiefly through
certain meats taken, which do increase Phlegma.

Of the pain or griping of the guts, which is called Cholica.. 3.
COlon, or Cholica Passio, is a pain of the bowels, to wit (as is before
discoursed) of the neathermost guts, which is caused, when the superfluity
which nature is enured to, naturally to avoid and cast from her, is stopped and
hindered, and if the corruption, winds, or worms be not expelled, as they were
wont to be. But the pain of the cholick comes commonly by fits, ceasing
otherwhiles, and then immediately returning with great intolerable pain, with
heavy breath, with shiuering, shaking and sweating. The causes of this cholick
are for ye most part the same with Iliaca Passio: for both of these sorts of
pains in the guts be matched so near together, that they may well be called
sisters. But there is only this difference between them both, that the
neathermost bowels be fat by nature, and therefore may gather fatnes unto them,
that by that means the guts are made so narrow, that the hard ordure cannot
pass thorough them, but is utterly hindered.

The signs of the Cholick be these: when the ordure and winds are daily shut
up and hindered. And although the stool be furthered through Clisters, or some
other means, yet is the ordure nevertheless hard and burnt, as Sheep dung,
or Goats dung, whereby the natural appetite does abate from day to day, until
it be utterly lost. Thence follows then so great pain and gripings about the
Navel, that it seems that the guts be knit or haled together with strings,
or plucked asunder, and bored through with bodkins. As often as one stirs
him, or turns from one side to the other, then does the pain increase
vehemently in this sickness; the patient is always greedy of sour and sharp
things, and has a loathing of all that is fat.

Each humor whereof this pain is caused, is known by these signs following:
If it be caused of Phlegma, then is the same with pain, heaviness, and desire
of all warmth. The pain is to be known by the feeling. Old folks, and such
as be flegmaticke by nature, are most of all subject to this passion. Also the
winter, eating of much fish, of much fruit, and of much milk, excessive
rioting, and great quietness, much going into the water, and such like, be to
this sickness a great cause. If in case that this sickness be caused through
heat, then is there a great inflammation, and with it drouth of the tongue,
great thirst, itch, and great heat in the urine. Chiefly if the person be
young, and in the Summer time, if he be chollerick by nature, if he have used
much about the fire, or much spice. Or if this pain of the bowels be caused
through obstruction it may be known by the going to the stool, and pain of
the guts, to wit, as if the same were torn asunder, and stuck thorough. And
if the patient would go to the stool with great forcement, then is it all to
be avoided very like to clay, the which may be caused through long use of any
old meat, through the patients dry complexion, and through long continuing
labor, and with much sweating in the hot air.

Or if this Cholicke proceed through wind, then is heard much rumbling in the
bowels and puffing up of the belly, his excrements do swim upon the water
because they be full of wind: and so much the more may one be ascertained
thereof, if one knew that the patient had eaten before much Pease, Beans,
Chestnuts, Rapes, Figs, Must, and such like windy meats or drinks, much
water, or much watered wine.

Or when this pain of the bowels is caused of any hot impostumes, then does
the patient feel hot stitches; he has thirst and great pain, and that
always in one place; he has also a red face, extuberation of the eyes, and
restraint of the urine.

But if this grief be caused through a cold impostume, for it be all these
things beforementioned much feebler: being caused of superfluous meats, of
much fish, of much cold and moist herbs, fruits, Swines flesh, and such like:
also the stools be full of Phlegma.

Of the difference of these pains in the Guts.. 4.
Above all those which are before discovered, be these two sorts of pains in
the bowels disagreeing in this; to wit, that in the pain of the uppermost
guts, the extremity is much greater, and can kill a body much sooner; for
that these uppermost, tender and small guts are much more sensible then the
neathermost great guts: Secondly, because that Iliaca is unsteadfast (as it is
said before) and remooueth from one place into another: Thirdly, because this
Iliaca is higher than the navel. And when this pain sets there and about
the raines, then is it the general opinion of all the learned, that in no
wise, neither through medicines, neither through any other means this sharp
matter or wind which has no vent, lying shut up in the crooked gut Ilion and
there making this pain, may be made to avoid neither yet expelled, and that
there will follow of it the Dropsy Tympania, wherein the wind does after
spread it self abroad between the skin and the flesh behind over the whole
body, as has been said more at large before in the twelfth Chapter, and
sixteenth. The fourth difference is, that the uppermost pains of the guts or
Iliaca are to be helped through medicines from above, and the undermost pain
Cholica, through clisters; for that the Clisters be very commodious for the
Cholera, and very little for Iliaca, or nothing at all: Fifthly, if there
appear any other accidents with it, as swowning, trembling of the heart, short
breath, much waking, or cold of the outward parts; they be then always the
more grievous in Iliaca then in Cholica: because that it is nearer to the
heart, and therefore the more perilous.

Now to come to the remedies, we will (according to the custom of the ancient
Physicians) distinguish these pains of the bowels by five several causes,
whereof the first is the obstruction or binding of the body: the second
Phlegma: the third winds: the fourth impostumes: the fifth Cholera and heat:
but we will here declare for the first certain things that be generally
convenient for both these griefs: the remedies which be ordained and used in
both these pains of the bowels, are also very meet for either of them; only
(as it is said) the Clisters for Iliaca passio, do seldom do any good: not
that the same be therefore altogether forborne, for both must always be first
endeavored to open the passages of the guts, and as soon as one perceives the
pain, to be presently in hand with clisters, and also to make somewhat ready
which may be laid upon the belly to warm the same therewith, like as with
these things following: to wit, Pellitorie of the wall, Mugwoort, Southernwood,
Fennel, Elecampane leaves, Wormwood, white Mints and Marioram: of these
herbs take as many and which you will, put them in a bag, and let them sees
in Wine: afterward wring them out, and so lay them warm upon the place of the
pain.

Item, take Millet or Oats, mix them with Salt, and a little Annis, Fennel,
Dil, and with Linseede: parch them, and lay them on the pain. You may also
make and use after the same manner a bag with Cammomill, Venus hair and
Stechas. Item, take Althea Butter, Barrowes grease, Hens and Ducks grease, of
each half an ounce, oil of Cammomill one ounce, anoint the place of the
pain with it: what is particularly to be used besides for either of these
pains in the guts, shall be distinctly showed hereafter.

Of the pain in the guts through obstruction or binding of the body.. 5.
IN the beginning of this description of the pain in the bowels, when it
comes chiefly through the binding of the body, it is to be cured with
Clisters, which hereafter be described against winds, and with the purgative
medicine, whereof diverse be set down in the eleventh Chapter, 20.. And both
these are to be used so often, and so long, until that the body be thoroughly
opened. In like manner, this patient must endeavor himself to eat all soluble
meats and herbs, viz. Mallows, and herb Mercury dressed with fresh broths,
with Butter and Sallad oil, which for this disease is not only needful, but
also much commended.

Lay also outwardly upon it this plaster following: Take Mallows, Hollihocke
roots, and Bearefoote, of each one handful, Fenegreeke meal, and Linseede
meal, of each six ounces, oil of Violets, Hens grease, Barrowes grease, and
fresh Butter, of each two ounces, four white Lilly roots roasted. All the
herbs are to be sodden, and afterward stamped, and you are afterward to
temper the rest amongst them over the fire, and then to aply them warm upon
it. For this is also very good the sirupe of Violets drunken with some broth
wherein Damask Prunes, Raisins and Figs have been decocted, and wherewith some
Cassie is tempered. He may also use the herbs and other things stamped,
whereof the Clisters be boiled, and make a plaster thereof with Butter, or
oil of Violets, and with Barrowes grease, and lay it over all the belly. He
must also eschew cold air, and must keep him always warm, continuing this
so long, until that ye have his body very open.

Of the pain in the guts through slime and Phlegma.. 6.
THe other former discovered cause is Phlegma, which (as is sufficiently showed
before) does show it self apparently, if with a tolerable pain there be no
great heat nor thirst adjoined. And if there be any salt matter (which the
patient shall perceive in his mouth) or any obstruction of the body, stinking,
belching, and great faintnes with it, then must preparatiue medicines be
ministered to the patient, and such as may procure no wambling, and so begin
with these Sirupes following: viz. the sirupe of white Mints, of Wormwood, and
all sorts of Oxymel, or any such like. Afterward is much commended by the
ancient Physicians the confection De Gallia for to purge, which follows
hereafter: Take Mastick, Cloves, Ginger, Pepper, long Pepper, Cinnamom,
Nutmegs, Gallia Muscata, and Diagridion, of each a like quantity: afterward
wring out the juice of sour Quinces, and put as much honey as juice unto it:
then take of both these one ounce and a half, and put half an ounce of powder
unto it which is made of the foresaid things: but let this juice and honey sees
before to the thicknes of a sirupe, and afterward temper the other things
amongst it, whereof you are to give at once one quarter of an ounce or two
dragmes and a half. Also the purging confections of Quinces, which be
described in the eight Part, are very meet for this purpose, and in like sort
the Electuarium Indum.

A purging Confection: Take Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Ginger one
scruple, Mastick half a scruple, Sugar three dragmes: temper them well
together, and then take it with what you will. But if so be that the sick body
be not addicted to vomit, and that the same be not feared, then are these Pills
following to be exhibited unto him, called Iliacae. Take Coloquint, and
Sagapenum of each ten dragmes, Diagridion, three dragmes and one scruple; then
make pills of it with wine, and give thereof one dragme at once, they ease very
speedily the pain. For this is also very good Benedicta Laxatiua, or Hiera
Picra one ounce, Hiera Picra magnae half a dragme, Turbith, and Ginger, of
each one scruple: then mix them together with a good draught of wine. But in
case that in this cholick the purging medicines will not help, and the sickness
still increases, then make these suppositories following: and if so be that
these suppositories will not sufficiently relaxe, then are clisters to be used,
which are the very best and safest remedies for the cholicke which one can
devise, therefore we will here rehearse some of them, and begin first with the
mildest. But note always (which is good in all clisters that are to be used
for the cholicke) that the herbs, and all that is to be used with them, are to
be decocted in such broths wherein Calves heads, Lambs heads and feet be
boiled: for these broths be very requisite for all obstructions of the body.

Take Cammomill, Hollihocks, and Mallows, of each one handful, Fennel,
Annis, Caraway, of each one quarter of an ounce: sees them all together in
wine or water. Take fifteen or sixteen ounces of this decoction, and dissolve
therein fresh Butter, and Sallad oil, of each two ounces and a half, or three
ounces, with the yolke of an Egg; temper them well, and minister it warm.
Item, take one pound of Linseede oil, and use it very warm for a Clister: Or
take Mallows, Hollihockes, Beetes, Mercury, Fenegreeke and Linseede, of each
one handful, five or six Figs cut, Annis, Fennel, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Branne one handful: sees them all together in sufficient water. Of
this decoction you are to take fifteen or sixteen ounces; and then temper
amongst it Hiera Picra, and Cassie, of each one ounce, oil of Rue three
ounces, and then make a Clister thereof.

Another: Take Mallows, Hollihockes, Mercury, and Bearefoote, of each one
handful, ten or twelve fat Figs, powned Fenegreeke, and Linseede, of each one
ounce and a half, Dil seed one ounce, Bran half a handful, oil of Sesamum,
and Honey, of each one ounce and a half, Sal gemmae one dragme, Cassie and
Hiera Picra, of each three quarters of an ounce: temper them all together in
sixteen ounces or more of the foresaid decoction unto a Clister. You have
before in the eleventh Chapter, and the 21.. a Clister of Malmsey, which is
also convenient for this use. Item, take the juice of Parietarie, and the juice
of Wormwood, of each six ounces, one Nutmeg, Peach kernels beaten very small
half a dragme, make them all together warm, and minister three of these
Clisters in one day.

Another: Take Annis, and the seed of Pellitorie, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Pellitorie leaves one handful: sees them all together in Wine, and
take thereof fifteen or sixteen ounces: melt Butter therein, and Linseede, of
each two ounces, then temper them together. When the patient has avoided this
Clister, then let him afterward drink five or six ounces of the oil of sweet
Almonds, and that tempered with Sugar. Item, take oil of Rue twelve ounces,
five or six Leekes heads, stamp them, and sees them in the oil: then
strain it through a cloth, and use the oil for a Clister. Item, take
Pellitorie, Centorie, Marioram, and field Mints, of each one handful, Annis,
Comin, and peeled wild Saffron seed, of each one dragme, Polipodie roots,
Turbith, and Radish seed, of each half an ounce, Sal gemmae one dragme:
temper all this into a Clister, as is abouesaid.

You are also to observe here, that these and such like Clisters shall be
ministered but only when other remedies will not avail. Item, oil of Cammomill
is more precious then common oil: but if Cammomill cannot be gotten, then is
oil of Linseede to be used in stead of it. Also hereafter do follow sundry
remedies against all pain of the guts, which serve also very well for the
Phlegma.

Certain Potions for the cold Phlegma.
TAke the roots of Smallage, Fennel, and Parsley roots, of each two ounces,
Annis, Fennel, Caraway, Parsley, and Smallage seeds, of each one ounce, Radish
two ounces: make a decoction of this, and drink thereof adays oftentimes as
warm as you can suffer it.

Also once or twice a day drink a spoonefull or twain of Rose honey tempered
together with the foresaid potion.

Item, sees an old Cock until the bones fall from the flesh, and in this
broth sees Polipodie roots, the seeds of Dill, and of Annis, and drink
otherwhiles a good draught of it. Also you may oftentimes with the waters and
seeds of the foresaid roots, foment the place where the pain is, and
afterward anoint the place with oil of Rue wherein Annis seeds are boiled.

Some do highly commend the oil of Sulphur, viz. to drink in the winter one
drop or twain with Muscadell wine, or with vital water. It will
maruellously help and expel all gripings in the guts of a cold occasion.

Item, the confected Elecampane roots, and confected Pimpernell roots, do
assuage all pains of the bowels which proceed of cold. In like manner the
confected Ginger does warm and strengthen all inward parts, and so does also
the roots of Eringus, when it is confected.

Amongst other Conserues, there be also meet and commodious the conserues of
Piony, and Rosemary, of Hyssop, of Spikenard, and after purging, the
Confections of Trion pipereon, Diacalamentha, and such like.

Of the pain in the guts through wind.. 7.
THe third cause of these pains in the bowels are winds. If then this pain do
come of no obstruction, and yet nevertheless one feel cumbling in the belly,
and hears the pain run up and down in the belly, and if the pain do come by
fits, and there abateth again: against this be those remedies to be used that
do expel wind. For which, the Confection of Bayberries is so highly commended,
that it is thought that her like cannot be found. At the Apothecaries they call
this Electuarium de Baccis Lauri, and it is thus prepared: Take dry Rue one
dragme, Ameos, Comin, Nardus seed, Louage seed, Marioram, Caraway, bitter
Almonds, long Pepper, Daucus seed, white Mints, Pepper, Calmus, Bayberries,
and Beuercod, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sagapenum half an ounce,
Opopanacum one dragme, all these being powned together and molten, then make a
confection of it with clarified honey, and give the patient thereof the
quantity of an hasell nut with a draught of wine. Marmalade with spices is
also very meet for this purpose. Item, in like sort be both the sorts of
Treacle and Mithridate, for that they do wast wind, and be good for all cold
diseases of the intrailes. Item, there is also fit for this use the confection
of Horseradish, which shall hereafter be expressed.

These confections following are also very commodious: viz. De Cumino, Diatrion
pipereon, Diagalanga, Dianisum, Diacalamintha, Diapliris, Aromaticum rosatum,
and after them a good draught of Wine.

If you desire to make a powder, then prepare this following: Take Ginger half
an ounce, Annis one quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander one ounce and a
half, Mace, Galingale, Cucubes, and Nutmegs, of each one dragme. This being
beaten all small, then put as much Sugar unto it as you please. This powder
consumes all wind, and hinders also the generation of other. You have also
herebefore certain gross powders for the stomach, which be also very good.
In like manner do Annis, Fennel seed, Caraway, and Comin, (either bare or
confected, and taken before meat) consume all pain in the guts. The sirupe of
Wormwood expels also winds.

For this are also very convenient clisters, if they be made of such things as
do cause wind to avoid, as this following: Take Mallows, Hollihock roots,
Violet leaves, Bearefoote, and Beets, of each one handful, Centorie,
Rapontica, Calmus, white Mints, Marioram, Southernwood, Rue, and Hyssop, of
each half a handful: Sees them all together in sufficient water, and take
fifteen or sixteen ounces thereof, honey of Roses, and oil of Rue of each
three ounces, Hiera Picra one ounce, Benedicta laxatiua, half an ounce, then
temper them all together.

Yet this clister is to be diminished or augmented according to the ability of
the sick person. Suppositories may also be used for this, which are thus to be
made: Take Rue and Comin, or Caraway, of each one handful, Swines bread one
root and a half, Boreas one dragme, clarified Honey three ounces, make
Suppositories thereof. Another: Take Beuercod, Honey, Ox gall, and oil of
Violets, of each a like quantity, let them sees somewhat thick: afterward
wet a suppositorie in it, bounden at a thread, and use it as before: it
consumes wind exceedingly and purges very much.

Potions and such like.
TAke the roots of Smallage, of Fennel, and of Parsley, of each two ounces,
Raisins, the stones taken out, two ounces and a half, ten or twelve fat Figs,
twenty or four and twenty Iuiubes: Sees them all together in two quarts of
Water even to the half, and take thereof three or four ounces tempered with
the foresaid confection. The common people and husbandmen do commonly use
slight things which they can best get; amongst which may this potion following
be reckoned: Take fresh Cow dung about half an ounce; temper it with good wine
and wring it thorough a cloth, and then drink thereof, it is much commended.
Other do ascribe this to sheep dung, also Chickweede is commended for the
same boiled in water and so drunken. Likewise also Wormwood wine, or Wormwood
sodden in water: also Meade being drunken is very good for this pain; Wine
measurably drunken drives not only the wind out of the bowels, but also out of
all parts of the body. The wines of Hearts tongue and Marioram gentle, are also
much commended for these pains in the guts, and mo other aromaticall wines, as
of Galingall, Nutmegs, and Cloves.

Item, take Species Iustini one dragme, and drink the same twice a week with
one ounce of Rosewater, it is also good against the gravel. Master Tristrams
Water is also good against all pains in the guts: likewise is also commended
one dragme of Beuercod drunken with one ounce of Mellicraton.

In the mean time may outward things also be used: for this one may take the
herbs, the seed, and other ingrediences whereof Clisters have been made,
wring them out hard, stamp them and temper them with butter, with Barrowes
grease and oil of Cammomill unto a plaster, and so lay it warm over the
belly, it is very good. But if one will lay any thing upon the malady: then
must the belly be warmed well before with warm cloths, for this may be made
also the foresaid bags of Millet and Salt: or take unbeaten Millet, Oats, and
Fennel, or Bran, which you can get: parch them in a pan and apply it warm
upon the pain. Item: Take parched Linseede six ounces, parched Comin one
ounce, Bran half a handful; beat them all gross and make a bag thereof,
then let it sees in water or wine a good space, afterward wring it out and
lay it very warm upon it. Item: take the oil of Scorpions, oil of bitter
Almonds, and Turpentine, of each six ounces; let them melt all by the fire,
afterward temper half a dragme of Saffron amongst it. Lastly, dippe sheeps
wool in it, and lay it warm upon the grief: or take Pellitorie, and powned
Linseede, of each one handful, power two ounces of the oil of Scorpions unto
it, and let them be made hot together; afterward put a little Saffron unto
it, and use it as before. Warm bread laid upon the belly or the stomach
asswageth the pain, and is good against the suffocation of the mother or womb.

Another: Take Honey, Butter, Salt and Vinegar, of each a like quantity, let
them sees all together a good while until it begin to be somewhat tough, then
spread it on a cloth, and bind it warm upon the belly.

Item, take wild Thyme, Marioram, Caraway leaves, Cammomill, Wormwood and
Sage, which you will, cut it small, and put it into a bag, then make it moist
with wine or water, and let it warm in a pan and use it as before. Or Cow dung
and Butter, of each a like much; temper amongst it half so much beaten Comin.
Wolfs dung is also very good for this use, a plaster being made of it. For
this is also good the plaster of Bayberries, which is described in the
eleventh Chapter and the 5..

Item, another salve also which is described in the third Part, in the tenth
Chapter and the 5.. Take Comin, Caraway, etc. Or prepare this following: Take
Goose grease, and oil of Scorpions, of each three ounces, Saffron one scruple,
Wax as much as suffiseth.

These oils following are also to be used for this disease, viz. oil of
Lillies, of Cammomil, of Rue, of Dill, of bitter Almonds, of Spike, of
Bayberries, and Elecampane roots, of Peniroyall, and such like oils which be
warm of nature, and chiefly if Ameos and Masticke be boiled in them.

The bathing and fomenting is also very profitable for this sickness, which
may be made as hereafter follows; and may be prepared according as the cause
requires. The bathes of sweet waters are very good to assuage the pain, and
they be especially commended after the cholick, and after purging, and that
fasting. After bathing is some Troacle or Mithridate to be used and taken, and
to sweat after it.

For this be also good Sulphurie bathes which be warm by nature. Now will we
declare all the foresaid things that expel wind and consume it, and especially
those which may be used for Bathes and Fomentations, viz. Rue, Dill, Rosemarie,
Fennel, Chamedryos, and field Cypers.

Amongst the seeds, Annis, Fennel, Comin, Caraway, seeds of Rue, Ameos, and
Dil seed. Note ye that the patient must sit no deeper than to the breast in
this bath: and also may not tarry long therein, that he fall into no swound:
Otherwise the bath is very profitable, for it opens the pores, and does
consume the wind whereby the pain is delayed. You may wet a Sponge in his
bath, and lay the same oftentimes warm upon the belly. Likewise you may also
fill a bladder and hold it warm upon the belly. If you have not this decocted
water, then fill a bladder half full with Linseede oil, and make it warm in
hot water, and so lay it upon the belly.

Another Bath.
AFter that the body is well purged, he may sit in a Tub with warm Sallad
oil, and when the pain is assuaged, then to go out of it again. But if the
oil cannot be had nor be gotten, then use this ensuing: Take Pellitorie,
Violet leaves, Rue, Cammomill, Linseede, Fenegreeke, Hollihockes, and the
sprigs of Colewoorts, of each three handfuls; sees them all together in water
for a bath. Of this may you also make a Lotion for the feet, be it cooling or
warming according as the case requires.

For a Fume: Take Frankincense, Masticke, Lignum Aloes, and Sandaraca, of each
a like quantity, cast it upon hot coals, and receive the fume upon the belly
or where the pain is, for it does draw much wind unto it. The place also is
first to be rubbed so long until it be through red, and afterward well
anointed with any of the foresaid oils.

The wind may also be consumed through good government, (if the same be put in
practice) through exercise and sobriety: for that where there is not much
moisture received into the body, there cannot engender much wind. And when
such a patient has recovered his health, then must he beware of green herbs,
milk, and all other things which be windy. He must also addict himself to
drink honey water with spices, or prepare this Meade ensuing.

Take two ounces of clarified honey, three pints of water, sees and skum it
well. When it is cleansed, then are you to hang therein half an ounce of gross
beaten Pepper, and afterward let them sees again until there remain about
one quart of moisture. When it is then cold, take out the Pepper being well
wrung out. For this serves also burnt Wine, or Aqua vita, yet there is nothing
better than good old Wine moderatly drunken. He is to be restrained from all
watered wine, because it ingendreth winds. He must likewise beware of all cold
drinks, viz. the water of all herbs, fruit, fish, milk, and such like.

For all manner of pain in the belly.. 8.
ALbeit that herebefore there be many things discovered for to assuage the
pain of the belly, notwithstanding we must here set down somewhat of the
Narcotica, which be things that take away or do numbe the senses, for which we
advise in the use of them to begin always with the least, and so to come to the
greatest, so that nature be not violated. Therefore where great pain is, you
must apply parched Millet, Panick and salt. Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Rue,
Marioram, Penniroyall, Rosemarie, Comin, Annis, Fennel and Dill seed beaten
gross which one will, and as much as one will: let them sees in wine, and
whilst it is warm wet a sponge in it, and lay it upon the place of the pain.
Make bags of the foresaid seeds and herbs, and sprinkle wine upon a hot stone,
and warm them thereon. Or sees it in wine, and then lay them upon the belly
as all other. Afterward anoint the place with warm oil, viz. oil of
Cammomill and of Costus, but if the pain be intolerable great in the
uppermost guts, that one fears to fall thereby in a swound, one must (through
extreme need) put things in practice which do numbe the senses: for which the
Confection Philonium is to be used and chiefly with the purging Confection
Diaphoenicon, but this must be done with the counsel of a learned Physician,
as we have oftentimes already admonished, yet shall suffice half a dragme
tempered with half an ounce of the Conserve of Roses.

Others in stead of Philonium, use the pills of Cynoglossa, for that they be
safer; also the Triphera Sarasenica.

And albeit that through all these former reasons it may be sufficiently
understood, how that he is to be kept with meat and drink, nevertheless we
will briefly rehearse it once again for method sake.

This patient is oftentimes and very long to be rubbed with warm clothes. He
is also to inure him always before meals to walk easily. He is also to be
restrained from all Fruit, Pease, Beans, and Must, and all that procreateth
winds. He shall also eat all light meats, and dress his meat with Dill
seed, Comin and Annis: Partriches and all other field Fowls are very good for
him. The juice of old Cocks boiled with the foresaid seeds, is here much
commended.

For this sickness is also much advised to eat Hedghogs flesh roasted, which
causes all pains of the intrailes to cease. His bread must be a little more
salted and raised: then commonly good old clear and white Wine, if there be no
Ague with it, is to be his drink.

Of the pain of the bowels through any impostume and other affections of the
guts.. 9.
WE have numbered this herebefore in the 4.. for the fourth cause of the pain
in the bowels. But in case this pain in the bowels be caused through any
impostume and ulcer of the Liver, of the Spleen, Kidneys, or any other parts,
then is the same to be known by the place where those parts do dye: Like by
each of these is sufficiently declared what is to be done for it. But if the
bowels be hurt without any impostume, and that the same may be felt with the
finger or any other instrument, then may you find all that described in the
tenth Chapter and 3.. But if in the pain of the belly through heat there
appear any impostume in the one side, then must a vein be opened on the other
side: for the same must not be foreslowed, for that it is much needful. First,
he must before other things have a vein opened within the third or fourth day
in the contrary side of the pain, and afterward on the other side where the
pain is felt. This being now done, then take two parts of water, and one part
of vinegar, and make a sponge wet therein, and so apply it to the pain. When
the sponge begins to be warm, then wet it again, and reiterate this
oftentimes.

Moreover, the patient is oftentimes to be purged with Manna, Cassie, and sour
Dates, and let him be ordered like as one is to be ordered who has an Ague. He
must also beware of Vinegar, sour Pomegranates, and also of all sour things
which may hurt the bowels. Boiled Barley, and oaten paps, Mallows, Burrage, and
Orage decocted in Henbroth, or eaten alone be very meet for him: and if the
Ague be not great, then are they to be dressed with butter or with oil. He must
also keep a good diet, and must use much oil of Sesamum in his meats. His
drink must be barley water decocted with Licorice, and all his whole government
cooling and moistening, as follows hereafter. Take Mallows with the roots,
Hollihocke roots, Bearefoote, and Violet leaves, of each one handful, Burrage
flowers, and flowers of Buglos, of each half an ounce, four or five Prunes;
sees them all together in a pot of water even to the half, and then take of
this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, and temper with it two ounces of
Cassie, oil of Violets three ounces, of Honey one ounce then make a Clister of
it. This is also especially commended being made with Gotes milk, Cassie, and
oil of Almonds. When as then the impostume is broken up, then are you to use
for to cleanse it, Clisters, Barley water and Honey, and afterward consolidating
medicines. But if so be that one perceive any parings of the bowels in the
stools, and that with great pain, then are these following to be used.

Take somewhat less then a pound of steeled water, and sees therein broad and
picked Plantaine and Roses, of each one M. even to the half. Take twelve or
sixteen ounces thereof, and melt therein one ounce of Dear suet, three yolks
of Eggs well beaten, oil of Roses two ounces, Thomas Sugar one ounce, and
temper them all together.

Another: Take broad Plantaine, wild Tansie, and Comfrey, of each one handful,
Pomegranat pills one ounce; sees them all together in a pot of steeled water
even to the half: then melt in this decoction two ounces of Dear suet,
Trociscos de Carabe, De Terra sigillata, of each one quarter of an ounce, then
make a Clister of it.

For plasters, take the sodden herbs and the other things of the former
Clisters, powne them to grout, and temper therewith half an ounce of powned
red Saunders, Barley meal two ounces, and oil of Violets as much as does
suffice for a plaster, and then lay it warm over it, it does abate the pain
very much.

Another: Take Mallows, and Hollihocke roots with the herbs of Nightshade,
Violets, Cammomill, and Melilot, of each half an ounce: beat them all
together, and temper therewith oil of Violets, of water Lillies, and Ducks
grease, of each three dragmes, Linseed meal one ounce, and then make a
plaster of it.

If need require to purge more, then may the same be done with the conserve of
Prunes.

But if so be this pain of the bowels be with a cold tumor, then must stronger
Clisters be used, as there be sundry set forth in the 6.. against the pain
of the bowels through Phlegma. But first are the oil of Cammomill with
Vinegar, and the oil of Roses (that it may pierce and strengthen the bowels)
for to be used: after the Clisters expressed before in the fifth. may this
plaster following for mollification be used for to ripen and assuage the
pain: Take Linseede meal, Fenegreeke meal, Wheaten meal, and Barley meal of
each two ounces, six yolks of Eggs, oil of Cammomill, and good wine as much
as is needful for to make a plaster, this must be laid warm upon it.

Another: Take eighteen or twenty Figs, sees them well in water, crumbs of
white bread two ounces, White meal one ounce and a half, unsalted Barrowes
grease, and oil of Cammomil as much as is needful for to make a plaster: let
them all sees a little together, and then lay them warm upon it: you may also
put warm unto it one ounce of beaten Cammomill.

It happens also sometimes, that in these impostumes the urine is retained
back, because that the conduits are stopped through the tumor; therefore if that
befall the Saphea must be opened, and the kidneys and the priuities anointed
with the oil of Cammomill, and oil of Violets, and also are Clisters and
Plasters to be used, like as shall hereafter be further spoken of in the
provocation of urine.

Of the pain in the bowels through heat and Cholera.. 10.
THis is the last cause whereby (as is discoursed before in the fourth.) the
pain of the guts may be engendered; and when it comes with heat and an ague,
it is not then so hurtful or lingering as that which proceeds of Phlegma. For
this must the patient first of all be purged with sirupes and such like things
as do cool, and further be kept with necessary meat and drink. He is lastly
to use clisters in this manner following: first of all he is to take certain
days together preparatiue sirupes, as both the sirups of Vinegar, Oxysacchara
sirupe of Violets, of Roses, of Endive, and of water Lillies, with some
decoction wherein the same herbs have been decocted, whereof diverse be
described in the thrd Part.

For purging.
TAke fresh Cassie one ounce or one ounce and a half, the juice of Endive well
clarified and skummed three or four ounces: then make a potion of it, and give
it him warm, or in stead of the juice (if one cannot get the same) then take
Endive water.

Another: Take eighteen or twenty Prunes, and five or six fat Figs; sees
them all together in sufficient water, and take of this decoction three or
four ounces, temper Cassie therein, and oil of sweet Almonds five or six
ounces tempered with Sugar, and the same drunken at once loose the body very
gently, and is also most sure that one may give to the children newly borne:
Likewise Manna decocted with sour Dates, Prunes, and with Sugar, is also very
requisite to loose and cool.

Concerning the meats he must be restrained like as in other hot sicknesses,
and must chiefly eschew always meats which make wind. But oil of Almonds
used in his meat, be very meet for him.

All his Clisters must be made soluble and cooling, like as be these following:
Take peeled Barley, Mallows, Hollihock roots, and Violets, of each one
handful, Prunes, Sebestes, of each eight or ten, the seeds of Melons, of
Purslaine, of Gourds, of each one ounce, Branne half a handful; Sees them
all together, and take of this decoction and put unto it oil of Roses, and of
Violets of each one ounce and a half, Cassie for the clister one ounce,
Electuarium de Succorosarum five dragmes: then make a Clister of it, like as
has been sufficiently showed.

But here is to be noted, that if any parings avoid with the guts, then must
oil of Roses be most of al used; yet oil of Violets does assuage the pain of
the guts if the same come through any sharpness or any heat.

Or take Mallows, Hollihocks, Bearefoote, Violet herbs, and Beetes, of each
one handful, Barley and Branne of each half a handful: let them sees all
together, and then take of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, and temper
Cassie in it one ounce, Hiera Picra three quarters of an ounce, Benedicta
Laxatiua three dragmes, oil of Violets three ounces, Salt one dragme or
twain, minister it as is accustomed.

This ensuing is also special good if any body have been bounden certain
days together: Take twelve or sixteen ounces of Cow milk, temper one ounce
of Cassie amongst it, and minister it warm.

There may also a cooling plaster be laid upon the belly, whereof there be
diverse discovered against the heat of the stomach and the Liver: yet must
always some Cammomill, Wormwood, and such like be tempered amongst it.

For a cooling you may also take preserved Ribes, or any such like, as in the
eleventh Chapter. 6. is showed.

Of the pain of the belly mixed with gravel.. 11.
FOr this disease is much advised, to take three days one after another, a
good draught of the water of Elderne flowers, which helps marvelous well.
Item, take the juice of Pellitorie eight ounces, oil of Rue two ounces: sees
the dung of a Dog in it, which has eaten nothing but bones: strain it
thorough, and use it for a Clister. It is also much advised for to take for
purgation half an ounce of Diaphoenicon, and Sebestes one dragme and a half,
Philonium Romanum one scruple, Species Iustini half a scruple: temper them all
together, and drink it, and then a little fat broth after it. But how easily
an error is committed in distinguishing the pain of the guts, from the pain
of the raines, and the pain of the gravel, it shall hereafter be declared,
where we shall speak of the gravel.

Of the pain in the bellies of young children.. 12.
WE have here briefly showed of the oil of sweet Almonds which is to be
tempered with Sugar, and may be given boldly to newborn children for the
pain of the belly: This is always found to be good. The water of Larks
spurs is also good for the same, as well in old folks as in young children.
For a small Clister, take Mallows, Hollihocke roots, and Pyrola, of each
half a handful, Melilot and Rosemary, of each half so much: sees them in a
pint of water, and then take of this decoction little or much, according to the
bigness of the child, Honey of Roses half an ounce, oil of Cammomill two
ounces, Salt half a dragme: temper them all together. Item, take unto small
children always a spoonefull of the water of black Cherries in their pap, for
it asswageth the pain. Oil of Nutmegs anointed about the Navel, and a warm
cloth laid upon it: and in like manner the oil of Scorpions is also very
commodious for this infirmity. Also Chickweede fried in oil, and applied warm
on the belly. Also take Mints, and Mallows fried in fresh Butter, or Cammomill
and Wormwood, of each a like much: cut them all together meetly small, and put
them in a little bag: then make it meetly warm in hot wine, wring it well
out, and so lay it over the child's belly. Item, cut an Onion very small, fry
it in oil, and bind the same upon the Nauel of young children and old folks.

Albeit, that it be not now our intent to write much of Chirurgerie, yet
nevertheless, we can not let this escape: viz. if any be wounded in the belly
that his bowels issue forth, and then happen to swell that they cannot be put
back into the body, then warm them with warm milk or wine. After that may
the Surgeon well know what he has to do.

Of the Worms in the belly.. 13.
FIrst of all, there is not any thing more certain, than that in man's body,
like as in stinking kennels, in cheese, and in stinking flesh, worms do grow,
and that out of a putrified matter: But in man do they chiefly proceed through
unaccustomed meats that cannot be digested: also of surfeiting and
ouercharging of the stomach. Item through bathing, and use of venery with a
full stomach, through eating of fresh Beans, of salt fish that is without
scales, through Swines flesh, and such like things more. Also these worms do
grow by eating much fruit. Therefore have children most annoy thereby about
harvest.

These worms do engender sometimes in the stomach, and otherwhiles in the
bowels; and some suppose that they only grow in the blind gut; but they which
have somewhat more carefully beheld them, do write yt the long Worms do
engender in the uppermost bowels, and the small, like unto cheese Magots only
in the arsegut, and in the middlemost guts should round worms engender
called Ascarides. Some do take it otherwise. In fine, we will let them dispute
thereof; for they do accord herein, that there be three sorts of worms which
may grow in man's body, like as is showed before.

And to the end that somewhat be discoursed of these kinds of worms; The long
ones be known to be in young children through their gnawing in the bowels,
through a small, dry, and troublesome Cough: Moreover, they do awake suddenly
out of their sleep sometimes with an outcry; afterward they do quickly hold
their peace, and have an unequal pulse. Also they have uncertain Agues, with
coldness of the outward members, which accidents do happen unto them without
any cause three or four times a day. Such children have an unnatural desire
of meat, they let out their tongue, gnash with their teeth, sweat about the
eyes: they be gladly quiet: they be also very quickly angry, and snappish or
testie on them that do awake them, and as now they be ruddie, and immediately
bleake again: they talk in their sleep, be frighted in their dreams, and do
lie very unquiet. When they awake, they do then rub their nose, the eyes sink
into their heads, they will be very hard favored in their face, they feel
great pain in the belly, they have much foam and spittle, their mouths will be
dry, yet more by day then by night, and their breath stinketh much.

In like manner it happens very well, that they avoid the worms at the nose,
at the mouth and through stools: but amongst people in years there be besides
these signs such an extreme pain of the belly also, that they cast their
hands and feet from them like as it were a collicke. And as they come into
their stomach, then do they get a great wambling and loathing of all meats.
And when one forces himself to eat, yet can he not swallow the meat, but
must cast up again presently the meat which he has taken: their ordure is
very stinking, their belly swells on high, like as if it were full of wind.

These be now the signs of the long worms, which signs though they be not
always apparent, yet nevertheless this disease may be known by some of these.

The broad worms be as well in them that have no Ague, as in them which be
troubled with lingering Agues: they do also bring some of the foresaid signs
with them, and especially these will be known as well through the great
gnawing in the stomach, as through the unmeasurable desire of meat. And
although they have eaten enough, and do not by and by eat again, yet then do
they seele that gnawing and biting again as before. They will be also very
lean, and dry of body. But this is the very surest sign, that the patient
does avoid through the stool small things, like to the kernels of Gourds. It
is also found, that some not esteeming this gnawing of the worms, and taking
no advice for it, that the guts be bitten asunder, and that the worms are got
into the hollownesse of the belly, whereof does follow afterward a great
calamity, as madness, the falling sickness, dogs hunger, swouning, pain of
the belly, obstruction or binding of the body, and lastly, a painful and
bitter death. Therefore is this disease not to be accounted small, but rather
men are betimes to use all requisite remedies for it.

But if the worms be not in the bowels, but in the stomach, and in the mouth of
the stomach, then be they commonly vomited up, and they that be in the bowels
are rid and dispatched through the stool.

Of the third kind of worms which keep themselves in the Arsegut, shall
immediately hereafter be discoursed. I have therefore the longer discoursed of
this, for that it is a common disease amongst children and common families,
whereby common householders might know their right difference, afterward we
will write of the remedies serving for these common sorts of worms: but above
all, there be prescribed by the learned certain common rules of them. The
first is, that the lower the worms be in the bowels (whether they be there
grown or descended out of the stomach thither) so much the bitterer and
stronger must the medicine be which is given from above, because that she may
not lose her virtue through so long a passage. Secondly, the worms Ascarides
are not so easily killed through Physic, as other worms, therefore must
stronger remedies be used for them. Thirdly, to preserve himself from worms,
he is to beware of all such meats as do increase Phlegma, and to purge out the
same in aged folks, like as we shall speak more at large thereof. Fourthly,
the first intention of the Physicians is to kill the worms, afterward to
expel them, least that through their stench they do infect the heart, the
stomach, and the whole body. Fifthly, as soon as one perceives the worms,
then must he endeavor to expel them, and so to free himself from great
distress. Sixthly, all remedies which be hot in the third degree, are very fit
for this purpose if there be not a strong Ague or impostume with it. Seventhly,
if one will expel the worms through any meat or drink, then is the same to
be done with an empty stomach, and fasting. Eighthly, the worms are most
fittest to be killed through hot and very bitter things, as (to the contrary)
through sweet and fat things they are fed and sustained. Ninthly, all they
that have the worms, may be fed two days with sweet and fat things; but the
third day when they be hungry and empty, are bitter things to be given.
Tenthly, if one take any thing to kill the worms, then must the belly and the
stomach be anointed or plaistred on the out side with astringent and bitter
things. Eleuenthly, if so be that the worms be in the uppermost guts, or in
the stomach, then will they be more easily killed and expelled through that
which is taken at the mouth. But if they be in the nethermost guts, then are
they killed with Clisters and Suppositories. But if in the middlemost guts, are
to be used both these remedies.

The order how a man may preserve himself from worms.
ALl those that are to be preserved from worms are of three sorts, as children
which do yet suck, children of the age of fourteen years. Now for to free
the sucking children, the Nurse must eat all light meats, and refrain from
all Fruit, Fish, and Milk, but especially from ouercharging her self with any
kind of meats. The children which do not suck must be kept after the same
manner, and be restrained from all that is slimy, and also beware of Fruit, and
especially of those which be not ripe, and those that be wormeaten, for they
also engender worms in the belly. The youths and people in years are to be
kept likewise as we have said. Also twice or thrice a year phlegm ought to be
prepared in them, with Oxymel of Squils, or Compositum, or with the sirupe of
Calamintha, and such like. Afterward they are to take Hiera Picra, with the
decoction of Polipodie roots, Mirabolani, Chebuli, of a little Colomint, for
to purge. They are also to use rather roasted meat then sodden. They must
eschew all gross and fat meats, for thereby do the worms grow especially.
Also he must eat every day a little Mustard seed.

But if so be that the worms be present, then must one look to kill and
expel them by all means, for which purpose these hot things following be
fit, viz. Wormwood, Bay leaves, Peach kernels, Rue, white Mints, bitter
Costus, Centorie, Horehound, Lupins, Annis, Smallage seed, parched Nardus seed,

forcibly, to wit, Aloe, roots of blew Flower de luce, the juice of wild
Cucumbers, Agaricus, Coloquint, wild Saffron, the fresh juice of Elecampane

hardening of the breast, and in the third part the second Chapter, and eleventh.
a preparation of earth woormes into powder against the yellow Iaundise, whereof
may a drink or confection be made. But if the guts be distended and the heat
not over great, then lay this plaster following upon the belly: Take Linseed
meal, and Bean meal, of each one ounce and a half, Woormewood one handful,
Aloe three quarters of an ounce, and make a plaster of it with Meade, or with
the oil of Wormwood.

But if there be a small ague with the worms, then may be given to people in
years (each according to his age) Treacle or Mithridate; for both of them do
kill the worms and expel them.

Item: Take the seeds of Sophia one dragme, calcined Hearts horn, and
Pomegranate peeles, of each half a dragme, Diptamus, Cloves, Rubarbe, of each

and Gentian, of each one dragme, Rubarbe one scruple, Sugar six ounces
decocted with grass water: make also loosings thereof. They be very good, and
they be altogether easy.

The seeds of Rue should also be very good for the Worms: like as also is the
vinegar of Rue, and the common good vinegar. Take in like manner the flowers of
Feuerfew as much as you can gripe between two fingers, and use it fasting.
This hereafter ensuing may be used for children of three years of age: Take
white Diptamus, Wormeseed, Carlina, and Rubarbe, of each a like quantity; poune
them to powder, and give each time one dragme thereof more or less with wine,
according to the importance of the cause: whereupon you are to use for children
the salve of Orenges, which shall be described hereafter, and after that, this
potion ensuing: Take Rubarbe two scruples, Carlini one scruple pouned small
with Wormwood water. In like sort also be very meet these pills following:
Take Gentian, Mirrhe, Diptamus, Wormwood, Mints, and filed Hearts horn, of
each one dragme, Turbith half a dragme, Agaricus one quarter of an ounce, Sal
gemmae one dragme, Ginger and Cinnamome, of each two scruples, Aloe as much as
the rest: then make pills of it with the juice of Wormwood, and use oftentimes
of it about one dragme at once.

This composition following is most highly commended of the ancient
Physicians: Take Gentia^, Centorie, and Agaricus, of each one dragme, Cloves,
Nardus seed, the roots of Costus, Annis, and water of Scordium, of each four
scruples, burnt Hearts horn, Roses, Sorrel seed, and prepared Perles, of each
half a dragme: poune each alone, afterward temper them together, and
sprinckle them with the juice of Limons, with sharp Vinegar, and Rose water, of
each a like quantity, and let it dry again; do so five or six times: At the
last temper with it half a dragme of Saffron, one grain of Musk, and make
thereof small loosings with the sirupe of Citronis. One may take thereof from
half a dragme to a whole, whether it be made in powder or pills. Conserve of
Gilloflowers, and of Peach flowers, be also much commended for this purpose.

There may be also many things dronken; as the juice of Radish, and give of it
to a strong person one quarter of an ounce: it is a very strong and a right
medicine for a Plowman. This also is very like the same; poune Garlic, and
wring out the juice, and drink it as before. Item, take the herb Basil,
sees it in Vinegar and drink of it, the worms will run quick out of your
body. Another: take Rye, boil it, and drink sometimes of the decoction, and
also temper your wine with it. Or take Citron peeles one dragme, or one dragme
and a half, give it to children in Milk; it should be especial good. Take the
juice of Elecampane roots four ounces, and drink it; it is taken to be a
special remedy. Item, take Wormeseed one ounce, Seen leaves one quarter of an
ounce: poune all together to powder, and take one dragme of it or twain, with
wine, Beer, or Meade.

Item, take Pomegranate peeles beaten or sodden in wine, and drink of it
fasting about one quarter of an ounce. One dragme of pouned Zeduary drunken
once or twice a day, does also kill the worms through his heat.

Another. Take Cammomill two handfuls, twenty or five and twenty Sebestes,
sees them in a pot of water unto the half: then take three ounces of this
decoction, and temper with it three ounces of Oxycraton, and drink of it three
or four mornings one after an other.

Clisters be also very good for this if one can get Asses milk for it. If that
cannot be gotten, then is there to be taken for it a broth which is decocted
with 20. or 25. Sebestes and Rye, and mix with it Butter and Honey.

Also Cow milk may be taken for it alone, tempered with Honey.

For to use outwardly, the learned have ordained diverse remedies; as plasters,
salues, and other means more, as hereafter follows: Take Aloe, Southernwood,
of each a like quantity, temper them with Honey, or oil of Wormwood, and
annoint therewith the belly.

Item, rub Ox gall upon the Navel as much as you can: if it be too thin, then
temper amongst it beaten Wormwood, Gentian, or any other bitter thing. Note
also, because that all bitter things be enemies to young children, that regard
must be had to help them with salues, plasters, and such like, as hereafter
shall follow. For that through these means the worms may be killed in young
children, because children have tender, subtle, and thin intrailes, so that
the plasters and salues may penetrate, kill the worms, and expel them, which
also through the vinegar which is mixed amongst it may be the easier effected.
This salve following is very approved for it: Take Wormwood, Lupins,
Siluermountaine, Comin, Nardus seed, Centorie, Doronicum, burnt Hearts horn,
and Mirrhe, of each half an ounce, Aloe one ounce and a half, Agaricus one
drag. the juice of Oranges two ounces, oil of Wormwood, of bitter Almonds,
and oil of Peaches, of each one ounce, an Ox gall: let the juice and gall be
sodden together, and afterward mix all the said things amongst it, and then
make a salve of it with Wax: with this salve is the belly, the stomach, and
backbone to be anointed. But if you will make a plaster of it, then will it
be good for the stone of the kidneies and bladder. Or take the juice of Mints
two ounces, Centorie, Wormeseed, and Lupins, of each half an ounce, Gentian,
Wormwood, of each one drag. Diptamus, Semen Zedoariae, of each three drag. Ox
gall one ounce, Aloe one drag. and a half, Mastick, of Spica, and of
Wormwood, of each one ounce, unripe Sallad oil, and vinegar wherein tosted
bread has bin infused and is wrung out again, of each two ounces, the juice
of Oranges half an ounce, white wax vi. ounces: sees the juice and the oil
until all the moisture be consumed: when the oil is cold, then temper the
rest being beaten small amongst it, and let it sees a little again until it
be thick: lastly, put three grains of Muscus unto it, and spread this salve on
a round cloth and bind it on the Navel: it kills all kinds of Worms, and
also expels them.

bread, Peach leaves, Lupins, Ebulus roots, and Pomegranate pills, of each one
dragme, the juice of Garlic two ounces, the juice of water Cresses twelve
ounces: let all these sees unto the half: afterward put as much Wax unto it
as suffices for to make a salve. Item, take Centorie, Wormwood, and Lupins,
of each half a dragme, Lignum Aloes, burnt Hearts horn, and Diptamus, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Aloe, as much as the rest, oil of Wormwood four

half an ounce, Cinnamome, Comin, Nardus seed, Centorie, Wormeseed, oil of
Peach kernels, and of bitter Almonds, of each four ounces, Wax five ounces,
make a salve thereof: it has been approved oftentimes. But if so be that you
will have it stronger, then take Agaricus unto it one dragme, Aloe one ounce
and a half, Mirrh one dragme and a half, the juice of Oranges two ounces, Ox
gals one ounce, and use it as the rest. Take Treacle half an ounce, Diptamus,
Gentian, and Wormeseed, of each one scruple, Aloe two scruples, Ox gals one
quarter of an ounce: temper them all together, and make with beaten Coriander a
salve thereof; then spread it upon a cloth, and lay it upon the stomach. Item,
take Zeduary roots, Gentian, Aloe, and Wormeseed, of each one scruple, Cloves
and Mastick, of each half a dragme, Treacle one dragme, and one quarter of an
ounce. Of the stomachicall salve which is described in the eleventh Chapter and
the 5.. make a plaster of it, and lay it over the stomach; for it expels
worms, and does also strengthen the stomach. Item, take Aloe, Wormwood, oil
of Peach kernels, of bitter Almonds, of Mastick, and of Spica, of each three
quarters of an ounce, Hypocistis, sealed earth, and Lupins, of each one
scruple, Aloe, Spec. Hierae Picrae, of each half a dragme, Nardus seed, Gallia

Mastick one quarter of an ounce, Mirrhe, Aloe, and white Diptamus, of each one
scruple, Wax as much as needs.

The salve of Oranges (whereof we have spoken before) is thus prepared: Take a
sour Orange, cut it up at the top, and wring out the juice; then annoint the
temples with it, the heart and the stomach: the same is especial good for young
children.

Item, take oil of bitter Almonds, of Wormwood, Ox gals, and white Diptamus,
of each one dragme, Mithridate and the juice of Oranges, of each one quarter of
an ounce: temper them together, and annoint the Child therewith upon the Heart,
Stomach, and Navel. Put also unto it one dragme of Aloe: it is a good and safe
salve, especially if there be an Ague present with it.

Another: Take Southernwood one ounce, Wormwood, and the rindes of the Bay
tree, of each one dragme, Sugar, Colewoort seeds, of each half a dragme,
Bayberies one quarter of an ounce, Aloe half an ounce, burnt Hearts horn one

like manner the oil of Wormwood rubbed into the Navel (chiefly of young
children) is also good for worms. Item, there is also often to be used

Of the worms Ascarides which do keep in the Arsegut.. 14.
Moreover, we will here for a conclusion of this Chapter, discourse of the
small worms Ascarides which do keep themselves in the Arsegut. These worms
may be perceived by the great itch that they cause there. And for to remedy
this, dip a little wool in the oil of Abricocks, or the juice of white water
Mints. Also, you may mix Aloe and Ox gall amongst it, and so thrust it into
the Arsegut.

But first, the body must be purged with Rubarbe; afterward are Suppositories
to be made of fresh Porke and put up into the Arsegut, and all the little
worms will stick fast unto it. Some do take for this poudred Porke. Also, one
may annoint the stalk of Coleworts with Ox gall, and use the same as a
Suppositorie. But above all other things is much to be commended Quicksiluer
mixed with Barrowes grease, and to dip the finger in it, and so grease or
annoint the Arsegut within with it. But for Children may Suppositories be
prepared with Honey, and Salt peter, putting them up, and plucking them forth
again immediately. Also, there may a small Clister be ministered of Milk, with
Hiera Picra and Cassi^, Old folks are to have Clisters after this manner
following: Take Southernwood, and Wormwood, of each one handful, the seeds of
Cuscuta, parched Comin, and the seeds of Smallage, of each one ounce, Wormeseed
one quarter of an ounce, Bran half a handful, oil of Peach kernels one ounce
and a half, Salt one ounce, Hiera Picra five dragmes, the juice of Leekes one
ounce. Of this decoction take not above eight ounces, and make of it a Clister.

The sixteenth Chapter. Of the Kidneyes.
IN the left side right under the Milt, in the body of all beasts, is the one
Kidney placed, and the other in the right side a little higher, so that
otherwhiles it does touch a great part of the Liver. The Kidney which lies in
the right side, is also in all beasts somewhat greater and fuller than that
which is in the left side, and is not covered with so much fat. For because it
is hoter than the left, therefore does it consume the same fatnes, which
grows through moisture, like as it is very needful: for there is no part
which sooner waxes fat than the Kidneies. Both of them be made fast very
strongly to the back bone. They have sundry veins from the Liver whereby they
draw blood, with water, and also some part of the gall unto them, separating
the same blood from the water, and keeping as much of the blood as suffices
for their sustenance: collecting also the water together in their concauities
(like as in a pot) which the gall dies yellow; and then through the Conduits
Vreters (whereof each Kidney has one by it self) descends into the Bladder,
and from thence is eiected by the yard. These Conduits or Vreters are whitish,
hard, somewhat fleshy, and of the nature of the Bladder, whereby they may not
suddenly be bruised through the sharpnes of the urine, or through some other
occasions. The substance of the Kidneyes is of a tight well compacted flesh,
fashioned partly round, and not unlike to Ox kidneyes (the greatness excepted.)
These Kidneyes be also through many causes, and sundry sorts of sore diseases
infected, which the Grecians do call Nephrites, which is pain of the Kidneyes.
But this pain of the Kidneyes does come of many causes, as of impostumes, with
heat and cold, of the gravel, and the Stone, and further of many diseases,
and sharpnes of the urine, whereof we will hereafter directly write and
discourse. But here, before we go any further, we will make a general
declaration thereof.

First, the learned do divide all diseases of the Kidneyes into three
principal sorts: to wit, if they be subject to any bad complexion, whether
they have it of themselves, or be compounded with other diseases. Secondly, if
they be not as they ought to be by nature. If they from the time of their birth
be too great or too small, or fraughted and laden with gross tough slyme,
which do oppilate and stop up the conduits that do descend into the Bladder.
Thirdly, there may be also impostumes and ulcers. These three things may be
very well compounded together, whereby diverse diseases and pains of the
Kidneyes may be caused. The causes of these foresaid diseases may be as well
outward, as inward: The outward may be blows, falls, unaccustomed exercise,
hard riding, much going a foot, great heat or cold about the Kidneyes, to
drink puddle water, to carry unused packs, excessive lechery, long use of
diureticall meats and drinks. The inward causes are a bad complexion, as if
it be too hot, or too cold, too dry, or too moist, the putrification of
natural seed or sperme, impostumes, and other pains of the Kidneyes. The
signs be apparent of themselves, and to be known by the pain of each place,
as if the same be small, mean, or great. This does otherwhiles appear through
pissing blood, or the water which is like blood, even as there were flesh
washed in it. But if these diseases assail one with heat or cold, therefore
we will also (according to our custom) discourse a little of it, and
comprehend them in two especial points.

Of the pain in the Kidneyes through cold and moisture.. 1.
THe signs of the cold diseases of the Kidneyes, are they which have neither
heat nor thirst, nor great pain, and their water is not high colored, but is
much in quantity, because the same could not be wasted through unnatural
heat, which Ague, winter, and the gravel augmenteth.

For these diseases, must first a good diet be kept. All gross, slimy, hard
meats, and all cooling things are to be eschued, as Endive, Lettice, Cicorie,
Spinach, and Beetes, etc. unless there be some hot things dressed with them, as
Parsley, Fennel, Comm, and such like. Fish that he sodden are not good for
this, neither that which is dressed with dough or milk. Cheese is also herein
forbidden. Also cold clear water, thick red wine, and all fruits which make
gross blood, as Pears, Apples, Quinces, Chestnuts, Dates, and such like. In
all other things he may direct himself according to his old custom: but he
must not swallow down his meat greedily nor vnchewed, that the stomach be not
cloyed.

Great exercise immediately after meat is hurtful unto him. He is to keep
himself quiet one hour and a half after meat at the least, without sleep.
Also all moist and cold dwellings are to be shunned, like as near to the
earth, or such as be under it, or do lie near unto the water. But he is to
provide himself of good clothes, and of a good dry chamber. He must forbear
all sorrow, vexation, anger, lying long upon the back, riding, and such like.

Concerning the remedies, heed is first to be taken whether the Kidneies be
obstructed: but if so be that this be, and that the patient be young, full of
blood, and strong, then is the Median vein to be opened on the right foot,
and to let out above four ounces of blood. And afterward this Clister
following is to be set according to his age: Take Beetes and Colewoorts, of
each one handful, boil them as is accustomed: then take thereof about
sixteen ounces, and temper in it Benedicta Laxatiua, and the confection of
Bayberies, of each one quarter of an ounce, course Sugar and Cassie half an
ounce, Salt one quarter of an ounce, oil of Sesamum and of Lillies, of each
one ounce and a half: temper them all together, and then minister this Clister
one hour before supper. This foresaid Clister is always to be used every
other day, according to the ability of the person.

After letting blood, or after the second use of Clisters, then may this
purgation following or such like be used: Take the confection De Psillio, and
Sebeste, of each two dragmes and a half; temper them in three or four ounces
of the decoction of Parsley roots, and fast after it at the least five hours.

Or if you had rather have pills, then is the patient to take the pills Foetidae
one scruple, de Hiera Composita two scruples: make five or seven pills thereof,
and take them early in the morning.

Immediately after purging is the patient to use this following one whole week
or twain always betimes in the morning.

Take Syrupum Acetosum Compositum one ounce, Syrupum de Calamintha half an
ounce, Fennel, Annis, and Wormwood water, of each one ounce, afterward
drink this warm.

When these kinds of potions have been used, then is he to purge again after
this manner: Take Aloe half an ounce, Agaricus, Coloquinte, and Bdellium, of
each one scruple, Ginger half a scruple, Sal Gemmae five grains: form eight
or nine pills of one dragme thereof, and take them betimes in the morning.

Or take the confection of Bayberies one dragme, Electuarium Indum three
dragmes and a half tempered with wine, and used as before. This confection
following is also good for this: Take the seeds of Endive, of Smallage, and of
Sorrel, of each one dragme, Millet one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome, Ginger,
Cloves and Mace, of each one dragme and a half, Oxymel Compositum six ounces,
honey of Roses three ounces, Sugar two ounces: temper them together, and take a
spoonefull every morning before meat four hours, and so continuing it the
space of two months.

You have before in the twelfth Chapter and 11.. a good juice against the
yellow Iaundies, beginning, Take Gentian, etc. which is also very good for this
purpose. But if you had rather have a confection, then take Spec. de Seminibus
one dragme and a half, Milium Solis, Licorice, Cinnamome, Ginger, Annis, and
Fennel, of each half a dragme, white Sugar four ounces, being dissolved with
Fennel water, make Tabulats of it: then take thereof three dragmes always
before meat, and that enduring the space of a month. Sauine dries and
warmeth well; it is good for the Kidneyes, but women must not use it much.

The sirupes which be fit for this are these: to wit, Oxymel compositum, Miua
cydoniorum aromatica, Oxymel scylliticum, compositum, and de Radicibus: all
these sirupes do deopilate the obstructions of the kidneies. The plaster of
Bayberries is especially commended for the cold kidneies.

Item: Take Barley meal, Frankincense, and Masticke, of each one ounce, Myrtle
seed, Roses, Cammomill, of each a like much, for to make a plaster withal,
lay the same warm upon the Kidneies. This plaster strengthens, dries,
mollifieth, and suppleth, and does hinder that the disease cannot corrode any
further: and it is very good to incarnate or to engender new flesh.

For a salve, take oil of Nardus one ounce and a half, Saffron and Pepper, of
each half an ounce, the salve of Aragon one ounce, white Wax three dragmes:
melt them, and make thereof a salve. With these salues is the patient to be
very well anointed morning and evening in the warm Sun all over the back
bone.

Another: Take oil of Rue and of Saffron, of each two ounces, the salve of
Aragon three ounces, temper them together, and let the back bone be anointed
with it every evening and morning; and fume the back with Laudanum, and then
lay a warm cloth upon it. Also to set boxing cups on the buttocks with picking
is much commended for this disease, because that the veins which feed the
conduits of the urine do there end themselves in the very buttocks.

And if so be then every such patient do recover his health through the
foresaid remedies, yet is he notwithstanding to use the foresaid salve, and two
or three Clisters more. And if so be that the sickness will not avoid with this,
then take Spelt, Millet, of each three handfuls, made very warm in a bag, and
lay the patient warm upon his back thereon, until it begin to be cold, and
then annoint him on his Kidneies with this salve following made very warm:
Take oil of sweet Almonds, of Costus, and of Lillies, of each one ounce, oil
of Euphorbium one ounce and a half, Bears grease and Badgers grease, of each
one ounce, Hens grease one ounce and a half, Sagapenum, Stechas, Costus
roots, Mirrhe and Saffron, of each one scruple, Wax as much as is needful to
make a plaster withal. If you occupy it, then warm as much as you mean to
occupy at one time.

Of the pain of the Kidneies through wind.. 2.
THis pain does not appear in one place only, but spreads it self abroad,
and has no signs of any impostume, neither of the stone nor ague; for the
pain is more after that one has eaten well, than before, and it is especially
augmented through windy things when the meat is half digested. Now for to
remedy this pain through windy things, then must he beware of all kinds of
Pottage, of Pease, of Beans, etc. Item: from all manner of fruit, from
Chestnuts, from Rice, from Rye bread, and from Beer; for all these do engender
wind in the body. Against which are all things to be used which be light of
digesture and expel wind, as Annis, Fennel, Comin, Caruway, the seeds of
white Sesamum, Agnus castus, and Rue seed; likewise the confection of
Diacyminum, Diacalaminthum, is very good for this.

He is also to be outwardly anointed upon the place of the kidneies with oil
of Rue, of Costus, of Lillies, and with oil of Sesamum, and afterward to
wear this plaster upon it: Take Parsley, Smallage leaves and roots, white
Watermints, Marierom, of each one handful, Comin, Caruway, and Dill seed, of
each one ounce; beat them and fry them in the oil of Dill and of Rue, then
make a plaster thereof and lay it upon the kidneies: it is not only good for
all cold pains of the kidneies with wind, but also for the gravel and for
the stone, and against all obstructions of the same which do proceed of cold.

Of the obstructed Kidneies.. 3.
OVt of these forementioned reasons may easily be discerned, that the most
causes of the pains of the kidneies be none other than coldness and
obstructions: for this, cold applications may be used, as the conserues of
Marierom gentle which does open all obstructions of the inner parts. In like
manner also conserues of Betonie, confected roots of Pimpernell, Eringus
roots, and Calmus. Of wines be fit for this, Elecampane wine, Hyssop wine,
aromaticall wine, and chiefly all spiced wine, as Claret wine, and Hippocras.
Item, Betonie wine, Asarabacca wine, and wine of Marierom gentle. In like sort
also all the distilled wines, or Aquae vitae of these herbs, also Meade, and
Honey water. But he is much to be restrained from all puddle wines; for that
they not only obstruct the kidneies, but also all inward parts; they engender
gravel and the stone. Item: there is also a potion described in the twelfth
chapter, and eleventh. of certain roots decocted which be also very
commodious for this disease.

The great Treacle or Diatessaron if it be known how to give them in good
sort, are highly commended for this purpose. This powder following is also
very good and meet for to open the obstructions of the kidneies, and to
expel the cold: Take Annis, Fennel, Millet, Smallage seed, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Spica romana half a dragme, Licorice three dragmes,
Dragagant, Gum of the Cherrie tree, of each one quarter of an ounce: beat them
to powder, and take thereof about the second day always one dragme with wine.

This sirupe following has an especial property in deopilating of the
obstructed kidneis: to wit, Miua citoniorum, Aromatica, and Oxymel of squils
with other more described before.

The Simples which do open these obstructions, be Agarick, Saxifrage, Milium
Solis, Parsley of Macedonia, or stone Parsley, white Mustard seed, Nettle seed,
red Pease porrage, Fennel roots, Parsley roots, and roots of Sperage, of
Smallage, and of Butchers broom, Spicanardi, Spica romana, water Cresses,
garden Cresses, and Pingles; the compounds are Diacalaminthum, Electuarium
Ducis, and Philantropon.

Of the pain in the Kidneies through heat and dries.. 4.
THe signs of these hot diseases of the kidneies, are such as that they may be
perceived by the heat in feeling, and all cold things are welcome to the
patient, and hot things contrary unto him, unless the fullness of the body
does hinder and let them.

The patient has also great thirst at all times, and a bad stomach; his urine
is very little and high colored; there swimmeth otherwhiles some fat upon it,
and the rather in young, choleric, and hot men; with the hot pain of the
kidneies is more danger than with the cold: Therefore must one without all
delaie proceed forward with all necessary remedies; and that much rather, for
that through the foresaid heat (which is mixed with a tough thick
phlegmatic matter) the stone of the kidneies might easily grow, wherein first
the liver vein is to be opened, afterward the Saphea, and such clisters to be
ministered as may cleanse the guts, that is, such as be decocted with Quinces and
dates. This following is to be oftentimes used: Take Goats milk twelve or
sixteen ounces, melt in it Goats suet one ounce, oil of Roses two ounces,
and use them as the other. For preparatiue potions you are to make this: Take
Lettice, Purslaine, Liuerwoort, shepherds purse, of each one handful, the
seeds of Lettice, of Purslaine, Endive, Roses, Butchers broom seed, Barberies,
water Lillies, burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Sugar twelve ounces, then make a sirupe of it. You are afterward to
purge with sower Dates, with Cassie, with Manna, and with Succo Rosaram.

Also for this (like as in the pain of the kidneies through cold) is needful
a good order of diet. Therefore is his dwelling to be high from the ground, and
not on the water, but to open toward the East and the North, and not toward
the South or against the West. His clothes are to hang loose on his body, and
not girt tight or hard. Venery is also very hurtful for this disease. Out of
these foresaid reasons may easily be noted, that sore labor is hurtful; as to
ride hard trotting horses, to go up hills and stairs, and that chiefly after
meat. Notwithstanding moderate exercise is more commendable than to sit still
utterly unoccupied. Also anger, heaviness of mind, and all other motions of the
same are to be eschued. One must not eat too much, for this sickness is caused
most of all through ouercharging of the stomach; or gluttony; sleeping or
waking must also be moderate: for to use too much of either of them is
hurtful. But one must chiefly refrain from lying much upon his back, for
thereby will the humors sincke much toward these parts: therefore is the
first sleep to be done on the right side, and then finish it on the left
side. To his meat and drink must be taken some more heed: he must eschew
all old and unleavened bread, old flesh, and all herbs which make gross
humors, as Beetes, Colewoorts, etc. All hot and tarte meats, as salt flesh,
Garlic, Onions, Leekes, and Radishes shall he forsake. In like manner must he
not use the things that do vehemently force urine; as Fennel, Parsley,
Smallage, and such like. But he may not eat bread which is light and leauened,
and is two or three days old. Hens, Pullets, wild Ducks, young Pigeons,
Fesants, Partridges etc. will be his best meats: but he must forsake all water
fowls. Young Bucks flesh, Veale, Lamb, young Mutton, Conies, Hares, and wild
Swines flesh may he eat very well, and especially young Hogs flesh is much
commended for this disease. The fruits and herbs are Barley pap, wheaten pap,
Colewoorts, Spinach, Gourds, Cucumbers, Melons, Abricocks, green Fennel, and
above all, Sage and Betonie. And in fine, all that has a saltish and opening
power, and not hot above the second degree, all sorts of Cherries, and
especially the kernels of the same, be good for to cleanse the kidneies, and to
break the stone. In like manner also Hasell nuts, fresh Almonds, and Figs that
be well dried, and Raisons be altogether much commended. This patient may eat
sower Apples (but no sweet) and also Peaches. He must refrain from Pears (if
they be not very sweet, and the stones taken out of them) Pistacies, Pingles,
(and sometimes nuts) be commended: but Chestnuts, Medlars, and Services are
hurtful. Of all milk, Sheep milk is the very best for the kidneies, and
next to that Goats milk: but above all other, the whay of milk. But the
first milk after caluing or Colostra must be eschewed, except that of sheep
and goats. Butter is not much commended, but Sallad oil is much more
requisite. Cheese is utterly to be refrained, for it has an especial nature
to engender gravel, unless that it be permitted otherwhiles for custom sake,
and that it be Cheese of a year old, which is dry, well salted, and not
rotten. And always in the end of the mealetide, of confected fruits, Olives,
and Rapes, of Brimswicke are most healthful, and Sisarum, Quinces, Ginger,
Walnuts, conserues of Pionie, of Burrage, Buglosse, of Roses, water Lillies,
and especially of Cicorie, which do open the obstruction and cleanse. Item,
Vinegar, the juice of Citrons, of Limons, half sower, half sweet,
Pomegranates be also very meet for this malady, but veriuce is forbidden.

Of spices and seeds these are good, Cinnamome, Pepper, Ginger, Saffron, Annis,
Caruway, Louage seed, Ameos, Rue seed; but a little of each for meats.

The drink for this patient shall be white wine, or light red wine which is
not hard nor sower, but of a good and pleasant taste. The Cherrie wine does not
only cool and moisten alone the kidneies, but also the inward parts of the
body, therefore may the same be freely drunken. Preserved Cherries do also the
same.

Thus much have we meant to speak of the order of diet for those that be
plagued and vexed with the Gravel, which may be augmented or diminished
according to the quality of the cause.

How to assuage the pain in the Kidneies.. 5.
WE will speak now first of all of some particular things which have a secret
virtue for to conueigh the medicines into the kidneies and bladder: viz.
Saxifrage, Milium Solis, Parsley of Macedonia, and stone Parsley, Cantharides,
the roots of Fennel, Sperage and Butchers broomeseed, of Melons, Gourds,
Cucumbers, and Pompeons. These following have power for to cool the kidneies:
viz. Lettice seeds, the seeds of Purslaine, Endive, white Poppie seed, Tassell,
juice of Quinces, broad Plantaine, and such like.

The compounded things are the sirupe of water Lillies, of Vinegar, and all
that cools the liver and the spleen, whereof is written before. Afterward
you have in the third part in the beginning of the eight Chapter, sundry
things which are also good and very meet, therefore are you not to leave them
unread. But if you will have yet more, then look what is written of Diabete.

If any body then do meet with this disease, or fear to get the same; then
must he take the utmost green pills of Beans, and distill water of them, and
drink thereof two ounces tempered with Sugar. Other do temper amongst it as
much water of Hounds tongue, and so use it every day. Take oil of Violets, of
water Lillies, and such like cooling things, and anoint therewith the kidneies.

You have also in the beginning of the foresaid eight Chapter, a salve called
Anodyna, which asswageth all pains. Item: Take the oil of Violets two ounces,
oil of Sesamum, and of sweet Almonds of each one ounce and a half, Butter one
ounce, Saffron one drag, and a half, Wax one ounce and a half, Dill seed,
Cammomill, Ducks grease, of each half an ounce, three yolks of Eggs; temper
them all together, and make a salve thereof.

Another. Take Elderne oil one ounce, oil of Roses and of Violets, of each
half an ounce, Ceruse one ounce and a quarter, Rose water one ounce, two yolks
of Eggs, Wax five ounces: The oil and Wax must be molten together; and let
them sees a little: when it is almost cold, then mix the other things amongst
it; and at the last the two yolks of eggs, and ten dragmes of fine Bolus, and
afterward stir it well about. This salve is marvelous good for all over
heated Kidneies, and especially if one after the annoynting do lay water Lilly
leaves upon it.

Likewise does the Saunders salve expel all hot matter and distemperature of
the Kidneies: like as the same is described in the sixth Chapter and 1..

Item, take the Saunders salve, and of that which is called Comitissae, of each
half an ounce, oil of Violets one quarter of an ounce; temper them all
together, and annoint the Kidneies with it twice or thrice a day.

The Rose salve which is described in the first part, the second chapter, and
first. and other more which be noted in the second part, the fourth chapter and
3.. are altogether meet for this purpose.

Item, take Roses, Purslaine, of each one handful, sees them in Cow milk,
and stamp them to growt: ad unto it red Saunders powdered two dragmes, oil of
Roses as much as you will for to make a salve of it. Item take oil of Olive
and fresh Butter, of each half an ounce, the juice of Veronica, of Milium
Solis, and Marierom gentle, of each three dragmes: let them sees together
until the juice be consumed. This salve is much commended. Or take the
foresaid herbs, and sees them in oil or grease, and wring them through a
cloth.

Take Rose water and oil of Roses, of each one ounce, Vinegar one spoonefull,
the white of an egg, and bray them well together, and lay it blood warm over
the Kidneies.

If the pain will not thereby be eased, then let him wear a leaden plate,
full of holes, upon the Kidneies continually: it takes away the heat and
venery. If one perceive any gravel in the Kidneies, then cut a Radish in thin
slices, and fry it in Goose grease, and lay it on the kidneies. In fine, for
all such enflaming of the Raynes, there is nothing better then to bathe, and
chiefly in all such waters as do run over iron mines. You are also to look
how to strengthen the stomach in this disease: look for that in the eleventh
Chapter and the 4.. unto the end thereof, where is showed at large what
strengthens the stomach with heat or with cold. For this, also is convenient
all that hereafter shall be written of the gravel and the stone of the
Kidneyes.

Of an hard Impostume in the Kidneies.. 6.
THe Grecians do call this disease Scleros. The same may also be caused through
two manner of means: First, if the matter of the impostume begin to harden
through great heat, and to alter into a stone: Or that at the first it be an
impostume of Melancholicke humors, which is especially caused of cold that
hardneth the matter. The signs of the said impostumes are sorenes, or heaviness
about the place of the kidneies with little or no pain at all, whereby the
members do grow lean. The urine is wholly clear, raw, and very little: and
although it be (as many famous Physicians do affirm) that this disease is not
to be helped, yet are you to use all things for it which be here before
described for the hardness of the Milt and Liver. And first of all he is to be
purged, the Saphea or Liver vain is to be opened, and afterward the kidneies
to be anointed with Hens grease, with the marrow of Neats feet, or with the
salve Althea. And afterward this plaster following is to be applied upon it:
Take Linseed, and Fenegreeke, of each five dragms, Mallows, Hollyhocke seed,
Dill seed, and Cammomill, of each half an ounce, Gum, Bdellium, and
Turpentine, of each three dragmes. First dissolve the Gum in warm water,
afterward temper the rest amongst it, and so make a plaster of it. If so be
then the patient have any went of stools, then is Cassie or Manna to be used
for it. This disease of the kidneies does make also oftentimes that one cannot
hold his water, yea that otherwise it passes away from the patient unwittingly
in his sleep, whereof we will hereafter speak and discourse a part.

Of impostumes and ulcers in the Kidneies.. 7.
WHat difference is between the impostumes and ulcers of the kidneies, it is
sufficiently declared in the eleventh chapter, and twenty nine. because that
the kidneies be subject to both of these maladies. Therefore we will discourse
of them severally, and speak first of the impostumes, and therewith also show
all that concerns both these diseases.

Notwithstanding that both these diseases, of Hippocrates, of Galen, and of all
other learned be thought to be incurable, or that at the leastwise the same
could not without great industry and long time be helped; for which they
allege many reasons; yet are there nevertheless many kind of means found,
whereby the pain may be assuaged. And if so be that the same maladies thereby
could not be thoroughly and perfectly healed, yet may one stay them that they do
not grow and wax worse. Now then concerning the outward remedies of this
disease, you have for it salues, plasters, and other means before for to lay
upon it, wherewith is this remedy also much commended: which is, that one is
to lay tow over all his priuities being wetted in the braied yolks of eggs, and
to refresh and renew the same often.

We must also speak here somewhat of the causes of the impostume, and show
first that the kidneies and the bladder in this pain do depend so much one
upon the other that they cannot be discerned one from the other: therefore all
that we shall write hereafter is fit for both these parts.

These foresaid impostumes may proceed as well out of cold as hot matter, which
comes to fall upon the Kidneies and the bladder, and there to assemble. But
if any outward cause do happen unto it, as blows, falls, ridings, and such
like, that must be learned of the sick person. If the impostume be in the
kidneies, then is there great pain in the same place, the patient cannot make
his water, and there is a small ague with it. Or if the disease be in the
bladder, then does there arise a very painful swelling about the priuities,
like to women's pangs in child bed, chiefly if it be a hot matter, which causes
also an ague. And if this do come through cold, then is the pain and the ague
more tolerable, but the making of water very grievous, and this disease
lingreth long. But in case that the impostume be in the right kidney, then does
the pain draw upwards: or if it be in the left kidney, then does the pain
stretch downwards even to the bladder; the patient has one while cold hands,
another while cold feet: and his legs on the same side will be for the most
part asleep. Also the sick person cannot lie upon the whole side, but must lie
upon his back, or his side where the malady is. There does come also
oftentimes great binding of the body, with the first headache, watching, rednes
of the eyes and face, heavy breath, and especially if the impostume be in the
membranes. And if the patient do stir himself forcibly, then thinks he that
the impostume hangs or sacketh.

But before we come to the remedies, there be certain rules which are to be
observed in such like impostumes. First, in the beginning he must beware of
giving too strong purgations. Secondly, only laxatiue things are to be used: as
Violets, Cassie, and such like. Thirdly, if so be that the patient be
plethoricke of body, you must open the Liver vain or Saphea. Fourthly, there
must not be given unto him, so long as the impostume is not ripe, any thing
that forces urine: for thereby would the humors be driven to sink the more
vehemently upon the kidneies, or into some other part of the body, whereby the
disease might be increased. Fifthly, one must endeavor that the humors which do
flow toward the kidneies, may be conveyed into the outtermost members. Sixthly,
and that by reason that the kidneies should not harden. Seventhly, when the
impostume is through ripe (which may be perceived by the urine) then is there to
be given him diureticall and strong things. Eighthly, if the body be bound, then
must he not be let blood; likewise also if he have too many stools: but all
accidents are to be prevented and matched before. Ninthly, because that the
kidneies be so far distant from the neck of the stomach; therefore are the
medicines which are to be taken by the mouth, so to be composed, that their
vigor, through so long a distance and passage, be not enfeebled and abated.
Tenthly, all they that have any disease in the kidneies, are to eat and drink
but little, chiefly if there be many humors in the body present. Eleuenthly, if
so be that the disease of the kidneies may be helped with any mild things,
then must there be no strong things to knit and draw them together that they
cannot come to any corruption. Therefore are temperate things to be used unto
it, and warm and cold things to be mixed together.

Of the impostumation in the Kidneies through heat.. 8.
ANd for to come to the remedies; if so that this impostume be caused through
heat, then is it first to be opened with Clisters, as hereafter follows:
Take Mallows, Violet leaves, and Hollyhocke roots, of each one handful,
Linseed, Fenegreeke seed, of each two ounces; sees them all together, and take
of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, oil of Violets three ounces, oil
of Roses three ounces, for to strengthen the kidneies: make a Clister thereof,
and you are to use the same three or four times, if it be needful: Or take
Barley water alone, with the foresaid oil, or Sallad oil. But if there be any
laske or scouring with it, then use binding Clisters, and such as do strengthen
the intrailes, whereof every where be diverse discovered.

Also the liver vein is to be opened in those sick persons on the same side,
and that in the acme where the disease is.

Secondly, if the patient may sustain it, the vein is to be opened in the
hammes or bending of the knee. Or if it be not to be found, then to take or
open the Saphea, and that always in the side where the impostume is.

Afterward cooling salues are to be used, or those plasters to be laid upon
it which we have lately described. And if the sickness come to diminish
therewith, then is it a good sign: but if the pain and the Ague do continue
still, and the patient cannot make any water, or that it pass too exceedingly
away from him, then is it a sign that there is an assembly of corruption in
the Kidneyes, against which you have also a note before, what is to be done in
these hot kind of accidents.

For this is this plaster following good: Take Roses one ounce, the seed of
Purslaine, and white Poppie seed, of each half an ounce, Sallad oil three
ounces, Barley meal as much as will suffice for to make a plaster. Item, take
pouned Cammomill, and Linseed oil, of each one ounce, oil of Sesamum four
ounces, Bran as much as will suffice for to make a plaster: these being made,
apply them on the Kidneies. Item, take the slime of Fleawort, and of Quince
kernels, of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of Roses two ounces, Endive
water six ounces, the seed of Purslaine, of white Poppie, and Vinegar, of each
half an ounce, Barley meal as much as is needful for to make a plaster.
Item, take Holyhock roots, and Mallow roots, of each one handful, fresh Figs
one ounce, the marrow of Veale bones, Butter, and Ducks grease, of each half
an ounce, oil of sweet Almonds, and of Cammomill, of each one ounce and a
half, Cammomill and Balm flowers, of each half an ounce, Barley meal, and
wheat meal, as much as suffices for to make a plaster. This pap or plaster
maturateth all impostumes.

In the beginning of these impostumes give the sick persons Barley water or
Meade to drink, the water of Melons and Pompeons, tempered with Barley water
the space of one week. Other do ordain this drink: Take the sirupe of
Violets, the muscilage of Fleawort, of Mallows, of Hollyhock roots, and the
seeds of Cotton, of each half an ounce, Reisons (the stones taken out) one
ounce, Licorice three dragmes, Sugar eighteen ounces: then make a sirupe of
it, and temper a little of the juice of Nightshade with it, and drink it so
with Barley water.

This sirupe cools, and therefore it is very good against the Ague, which is
always present with this hot impostume; it relaxeth, cleanses, and asswageth
the pain. Afterward is the body to be purged with Cassie, sour Dates,
Manna, and such like.

The Diet.
ALl such patients as have a hot impostume in their Kidneyes, must (as it is
said) keep themselves very sober in eating and drinking, and must eat none
other but Barley paps, Hen brothes made sour with Veriuice, stoued Spinach,
Mallows, Orage, Lettice, Burrage, Almond milk, and young Pullets decocted with
Gourds, etc. And this is to continue so long, until it be openly seen and
known that the impostume is ripe. If so be then the patient between meals be
troubled with any great thirst, then must be given unto him sugared barley water
to drink. But if so be that the Ague be very small, and that the impostume be
through cold Phlegma, then must he rather drink Meade. But if there be great
heat with it, then must he leave flesh, and wine, always at the first.

But if the same be caused through cold, then may watered wine be allowed, but
no flesh at all, chiefly Porke and Beef; also Cheese, Pease, Beans,
unleavened bread, and Rice, be forbidden. But all field fowls, rere eggs, river
fish, dressed with Parsley roots and salt, are permitted for him.

Of Impostumes in the Kidneyes through cold.. 9.
WE have admonished before that all such impostumes of the Kidneyes may also
proceed of cold, and whereby the same may be known. For this impostume are
Clisters fit to be adhibited, and then to make afterward this potion following.

Take water Mints, Hyssope, Wormwood, rumpled Mints, Reisons, Ireas, of each
one ounce, Caruway, Fennel, Endive, small Endive, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Licorice half an ounce, Honey nine ounces: prepare it then, and use it
as other potions. And if so be that after eight days there be many humors
present, then first open his Liver vein, afterward the Saphea, and purge the
Phlegma with Diaturbith, and use Clisters of herbs which be mentioned in the
first potion: but put Mallows unto it, Hollyhock roots, and Cammomill; also
oil of Cammomill and of Nardus. After the taking of this Clister, the patient
is to lie very high with his tail, that the Clister may the better run
toward the Raynes.

Of the Exulceration in the Kidneyes.. 10.
THese Exulcerations may as well come in the Kidneyes, as in any other places
of the body, where they with their matter and corrosion do take away the
natural operation of the Kidneyes. The causes of these ulcers may be blows,
falls, wounds, and such like: as also blood, and other humors, which descend
thitherwards, and do there exulcerate and open the Kidneyes and the bladder
through their sharpnes. Item, if that any impostumation of the Kidneyes be not
thoroughly healed: Item, through the gravel and the stone that do bruise the
Kidneyes within: also of the use of all hot meats and spices, and of eating
salt, and by doing ouergreat labor in the heat of the Sun. All these former
causes may engender some sharp humors which fall afterward upon the Kidneyes,
and there do corrode and exulcerate them.

The signs of these ulcers are corruption, and blood, with tough slime, as if
they were small veins pieces, as it were flesh, which do pass away with the
urine. If so be that there be any ^eate with it, that is known by the thirst
and by the feeling. The signs of the Stone are to be found in their proper
place.

If so be that the disease of the Kidneyes and the bladder, with other mo such
like diseases, do agree so near together that the same may be hardly
discerned, yet we will nevertheless discover certain especial signs of it.

For the diseases of the Kidneyes there is no grief in making water, like as
there is in the disease of the Bladder, wherein the water is made with pain
and longsome. In the ulcers of the Kidneyes are always found in the urine
small pieces of flesh like small red Corans; where to the contrary, in the
ulcers of the bladder, there avoid great and white pieces.

If so be that any skalines be pist out with blood, and corruption which
stinketh, then does such come out of the bladder: like as contrariwise, that
which comes from the Kidneyes does not stink. In the exulceration of the
Bladder is loss of a little blood; but in the ulcers of the Kidneyes much. If
so be then that the Kidneyes have any disease, then does the patient feel
pain about the Raynes: and in the disease of the bladder, there does the
patient feel pain above the priuities. The corruption which comes out of
the Kidneyes is mixed together with the urine, and does settle in an hours
space not to the bottom of the glass: where contrarily all that which comes
from the bladder does separate it self forthwith from the vrin, settling to the
bottom of the glass.

We are also to allege certain common rules for this: as first, if there be
any young choleric person which feels pain in the water conduits, that the
same must be forbidden Wine. Secondly, for as much as these ulcers do chiefly
proceed through the falling down of any sharp humors, then it is needful
that their sharpnes and heat be alayed with sweet things. Thirdly, one must
refrain from all hot, sharp, salt, bitter, and sour things, and to use all
that is to the contrary of them. Fourthly, to drink too much, whether it be
Wine or Beer is hurtful, that one be not thereby constrained to make much
water. Fifthly, Venerie, great labor, and exercise, be very hurtful for this
disease, for that the parced Kidneyes cannot be thoroughly healed without rest
and quiet. Sixthly, if so be there be nothing that may hinder the letting of
blood, then is the same very profitable, as be also all great purgations.
Seventhly, by reason that vomiting makes the matter to have recourse unto
another place, therefore is it not to be taken to be unprofitable for this
disease. Eighthly, if there be great pain with this vlceration, then must
diligence be given first to assuage the same pain, and afterward look well
how to cure and cleanse this disease. Ninthly, for to heal this disease, one
must first begin with things which provoke urine gently, whereby the Kidneyes
may be a little cleansed. Tenthly, all medicines which are to be taken for the
diseased Kidneyes, whether it be by vomit, or otherwise, must be always done
fasting, and he must also fast long after it. Eleuenthly, after the
mundification of the ulcers, astringent and healing things are to be taken
tempered always with exsiccatiue medicaments. Thus for to heal these ulcers
these are the right means: If so be that the patient be hard bounden, then is
he to be loosed with gentle Clisters. Accordingly, if he be full of blood, he
must first have his Liver vein, and afterward the Saphea to be opened. For
his drink, the patient is to use Honey water, or to make this drink following:
Take twelve ounces of peeled Barley, Fennel roots, Smallage roots, and
Maydenhaire, of each one handful: sees them all together in two pots of water
until that the Barley be well swollen. Afterward take twelve ounces of Honey,
and boil it all together with the foresaid decoction, but scumme it well, and
drink thereof. If so be that the ulcer be great, and that there be need of
stronger things, then put Ireos, Hyssope, and Horehound, of each two ounces,
and a good pints of water more. But if there be but a small ulcer which has
not long continued, then take Mallows, Hollyhock seeds, the seeds of Melons
and of Pompeons, of each a like much. But you must peele the seeds, and give
thereof three dragmes at one time tempered with Meade. Afterward shall he urge
himself to vomit once every fourth day. Let this much suffice, as briefly
spoken of the ulcers of the Kidneyes.

Of the pissing of Blood.. 11.
FOr as much as this pissing of blood may be caused as well of the ulcers in
the Kidneyes, as in the Liver, therefore we will describe it here in this
Chapter. The pissing of blood is of two sorts: the one, when one pisseth fair
clean blood: the other, when the same is mixed with matter or corruption. This
pissing of blood, comes of inward and outward causes. The outward may be
caused through falls, blows, strong riding, insatiable venerie, great labor,
of certain meats, drinks, wounds, of a concourse of melancholic humors which
are wont to be driven out through women's Terms, or through the Pyles. Of the
inward causes are superfluity, sharpnes of humors and of the urine, winds,
tumors, impostumes, debilitie of the Kidneyes, and of the Bladder: then does he
feel the pain above the priuities, and the blood is congealed, and separated
from the urine. In case that the blood be much, and runs out swiftly, then
does it signify a broken vein: but if it come out slow or longsome, then an
ulcer: but if the urine be like water wherein fresh flesh is washed, then it is
of a weakened Liver: and if so be that it do come of a superfluous blood, then
is the same to be seen by the fulness of the body: but if it come through the
sharpnes of the humors, then does the patient feel a continual burning. But
before we do come to the particular remedies, it is needful that we do make
declaration of certain common rules. First, if so be that the malady be new,
then above all things is the liver vein to be opened, and afterward (if the
cause require, and that the patient be strong enough) the Saphea is to be
opened, thereby to drive the blood to another place. Secondly, in the beginning
are not astringent nor binding things to be used, that the blood may not
congeale and cool, but he must first begin with such things as do cleanse
the water conduits. Thirdly, if this pissing of blood do come as an expulsion
of superfluity, or Crisis, then is it not to be stayed, if it be not so that
thereby the natural powers be overmuch weakened. Fourthly, whenever the
pissing of blood, whether it be caused of the Liver, Kidneyes or Bladder, is
thoroughly cleansed, then is the same blood to be helped with cold and
astringent things, and to mix amongst them Anodines. Fifthly, all such patients
are to eschew great labor, venery, hot drinks, all spices, and all hot things.
Now for to come to the remedies of the same, then it is to be considered
whether this pissing of blood do proceed of outward causes, which may well be
perceived by the sick person, and is also to be remedied. First of all,
whether this pissing of blood have continued long or not. Of the pissing of
blood which has not long continued, we have hitherto spoken. But in old
pissing of blood, one must begin according to the contents of the other rules,
with the clensing of the vreters, which is to be done through these means:
Take Maidenhaire four handfuls, Melon seed one ounce and a half, Sugar and
honey, of each nine ounces: make a clear sirupe of it, and give it with water
wherein Melon seed is decocted.

Another which is very good. Take four handfuls of Cinkfoile, Sugar 9. ounces;
sees the herbs in sufficient water, then wring it out, and with sugar make
thereof a sirupe. This sirupe is to be given with water wherein Plantaine is
decocted: this sirupe heals and cleanses certainly.

If any one fall or be beaten, whereby a vein is broken in the body; the
liver vein is then to be opened, for that thereby the blood will be drawn
back which does run out of these places. But if that the blood do avoid in
abundance, and that the patient be strong enough, then is the Saphea to be
opened the second day afterward: and to the end that the blood which lies
clotted in the water conduits might be carried forth, then give to the sick
body a potion wherein Fennel roots, the roots of Smallage, Dragon roots,
Ireos, Hissope, Maidenhaire and Ciceres be sodden; afterward one dragme, or
one dragme and a half of Trociscis de Carabe may be given him with water
wherein the seeds of Butchers broom and such like is decocted, or the
Trocisci de terra sigillata.

For this is also meet the confection of Philonium Persicum, but it is not to
be used without the advice of a learned Physician.

Some do also take three quarters of an ounce of the conserve of Roses, and
temper amongst it seven grains of Henbane seed, and two scruples of prepared
Coral, which may be used with steeled water. It is also very fit to use
otherwhiles one ounce or one ounce and a half of Cassie, and chiefly if there
be heat with it. We have spoken before of the letting of blood, and thereupon
are to give to this sick person a profitable purgation of Rubarbe in substance
which is beaten, and not wrong out, but in powder with plantaine water:
afterward give him one dragme of beaten horsetaile, and one quarter of an
ounce of plantaine water, and strew all his meats with the same water.

All his flesh is to be sodden with Butchers broom seed and unripe Grapes. He
is always to beware of all sharp, tart and salt things, and lay a plaster on
the place of the malady made of Bolus and the juice of Sloes, Aloe, Lycium,
Vinegar and Rose water. If you will have more remedies, then look into the
former. of the impostumes and ulcers of the kidneys. And although all the same
were caused of other means, yet shall you find also three remedies meet for
the same. And if so be that this bleeding be caused through any sharp meat,
or any composed wind, then is the patient to order himself, as of the letting
of blood, and taking of the foresaid Trociscis is beforesaid. But if there be
any impostume or ulcer of the kidneyes with it that may be seen by the matter
and blood: therefore have you hereafter all that is requisite for the pissing
of matter.

If any man piss matter.. 12.
THe pissing of matter must proceed out of the bladder, kidneyes, or some of
the uppermost parts, as from some ulcer of the sides, ulcer of the lights, the
liver, etc. the which may proceed from some outward causes, as of blows,
falls, wounds, strong diureticall medicines, and such like. The inward causes
may be unclean impostumes, ulcers, superfluous, tough and gross humors, wind
or stone, which do settle there and make some excoriation. The signs of these
accidents may be perceived easily by the pain of the same place, and by the
declaration of the patient. This infirmity is thus to be helped: Take peeled
Melon seed, Cucumber seed, Gourd seed, and Pompeon seed, of each one ounce
and a quarter, fine Bolus, Gummi Arabicum. Frankincense, and Dragon blood, of
each five dragmes, Opium one dragme and a half, the seed of Smallage one
dragme: make Trociskes thereof with the muscilage of Quince kernels, and give
the sick folks every day the weight of one quarter of an ounce with the
sirupe of Poppie heads. For this is also to be used consolidating and
mundifying things, as hereafter follows: Take peeled Melon seed, the seed of
Hollihockes and Nightshade, of each half an ounce, bitter Almonds, Pompeon
seed, fresh Maiden hair, Ireos, and Licorice, of each half a dragme: make a
confection thereof with Sugar, or with clear honey. For mundification are also
fit, Barley water, meade, the decoction of figs, of Horehound, and Maiden hair
decocted with milk. Now for to heal, you are to take great and small Comfrey,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood, Frankincense, Masticke, and fine
Bolus, of each one dragme, parched Rubarbe, the juice of Sloes, and Myrtle
seed, of each half a dragme, Indie Spica half a scruple, Sugar as much as
you please, make a confection thereof. This sirupe following may also be
prepared: Take Licorice one quarter of an ounce, Maidenhaire and Hounds ribbe,
of each two handfuls, peeled Melon seed, Pempeon seed, Cucumber seed, and
Gourd seed, of each one dragme, white Poppie seed, Hollihocke seed, and
muscilage of Quince kernels, of each half an ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each
three dragmes, Rubarbe, Roses of each one ounce and a half, white Sugar nine
ounces; make a clear sirupe of it. The Trocisci de Alkekengi, which is of
winter Cherries, are surpassing god in this disease; and not only for this,
but also for all other diseases of the kidneyes: give one dragme thereof, or
one dragme and a half with Goats milk or Plantaine water. Also for this
disease is Honey water to be spouted into the yard: and when the patient has
kept it in a certain season and pist it out again, then is this following to
be used: Take Ceruse, Sarcocolla, Gum, Frankincense, Opium, Dragon blood, of
each half a scruple; temper it with four ounces of woman's milk, and spout
one ounce thereof at one time through the yard. In like manner shall he drink
Radish water, and water of Horse radish, or spout it in. For this must also
this order observed, to wit, that he now use consolidating, and then again
mundifying things, and do alter them according as occasion serves. Item, take
oil of Roses two ounces, oil of Myrtle, and the juice of Plantaine, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Trociscorum de Terra sigillata, de Carabe, of each one
dragme, Vinegar one quarter of an ounce, Wax as much as is needful for to
make a salve. This salve for the pissing of blood and water, is to be rubbed on
the place of the Kidneyes, and also round about the priuities above and
beneath, begin rubbed well in, and then well covered with warm clothes.

Of outward ulcers of the Kidneyes.. 13.
THese ulcers outwardly in the Kidneies, are wont to be cause if one lie upon
his back, then are the places of the Kidneyes red, and do come to exulcerate.
Now when this is perceived, then is there a plaster to be made with the meal
of Millet and with Pannick meal, and be laid thereon, and then are you to
strew it with Willow leaves, and to moisten the heated place with cold Rose
water, or to lay any cooling things upon it. These salues following are also
meet for this, viz. salve of Ceruse, Poplar salve, Sanders salve, and other
cooling salve of Galen, vine leaves steeped in Rose water, and thin beaten
Led also which is full of holes worn upon the raines. Item, take oil of Roses
tempered with a little vinegar and laid often upon it. If that there do then
appear bladder or blisters which do break open, then are they to be cured
with cooling salues, and dried up with the salve of Ceruse or Album coctum.

All these foresaid sickness and diseases are the true messengers of the most
grievous disease of the Stone or gravel of the Bladder and the Kidneyes,
whereof we will hereafter further discourse and write. But we will first of all
prescribe a brief order of diet for all them that be infected with these
terrible diseases, as the pain of the Kidneyes, impostumes, and ulcers.

The order of diet.. 14.
ALl meats of milk, or wheat meal, of the crumbs of bread, barley paps,
oaten paps, are very commodious for this disease. In like manner all field
fowls which are to be eaten, as Partridges, Phesants, Doves, Turtle doves,
Kids, and young mutton, if it be utterly without an Ague: but if so be that
there be a great heat with it, then is he to use Melons and Peaches which be
very ripe.

Hasell nuts, Almonds, Pistacies, Pingles, and such like may he also eat.
Item, young hens, rere eggs, hen-broth wherein purslaine, Lettice, Melon seed,
Pompeons, Gourds, Cucumbers, or any other cooling things have been sodden: all
river fish that have scales, frayed, are to be tolerated. Green herbs, as
Orage, Mallows, purslaine, and Lettice, are also very meet for him. His best
drink were indeed Barley water; but if he will drink Wine, and so there be no
Ague with it, then may he drink good thick red Wine tempered with water.
Asses milk is marvelous good for him; and if the same cannot be gotten, then
may one take Goats milk. It is before admonished that every such patient is
to beware of all sharp, hot, bitter, and sweet things, and chiefly of all
fruit, whether they be green or dried.

The seventeenth Chapter. Of the Gravel, Sand, or Stone of the Kidneyes, and
of the Bladder.
THis stone or gravel has his principal offspring in the Kidneyes, in the
Bladder, and seldom in the hollownesse of other inward parts, as of the Liver,
etc. The cause of it, is commonly by inheritance, like as the Gout or Podagra,
the Leprosy, and other more. Also these disease do come through a weak
Stomach and Liver, that engender much tough and gross slime. In like sort
also of a foggie air, surfeiting by meat or drink, the feeding of overmuch
slimie meats, the which do obstruct not only be kidneyes, but also all other
inward parts, as has been said, and hinder them that they cannot have their
right operation: the which may evidently be seen in young children, which are
most subject to this disease, for that they eat much milk, whereby the stone
and gravel is most of all engendered, of which the grossest sinketh into the
bladder with the urine, where the same lies and dries, and is confirmed to
the hardness of a stone: like as we for example cannot otherwise liken this
foresaid gross matter of the stone, then with the matter of a tile stone,
which is first a weak tough slimie earth, afterward dried, and at last burnt
and baked in an oven to a hard stone. The stone of the bladder differs also
much from the stone of the kidneyes, for it is whither, harder, and greater
then the stone of the kidneyes.

This foresaid stone or gravel is known by these signs. Lies he in the
Bladder? then must the patient often rub his priuities with his hand, his
member is always erected. Also in young children, they feel most pain about
their priuities: the urine passes from him with labor and very great vain,
and otherwhiles the Arsegut thereby descends. But if it be the stone of the
kidneyes, then do they feel great pain in the raines of the back, as it were
the Colicke or pain of the guts, because that the pain draws downwards. As
soon as they stir themselves, then does the pain increase: they are much
inclined to vomiting and casting, their body is bound, their urine is raw and
waterish, they are always provoked to piss, nevertheless they cannot be rid of
it without very great pain: therefore can this growing and confirmation of the
stone in these parts of the kidneyes not be without great pain and grief. It
is also evidently and sufficiently well known to each man's eyes, where the
pain remains in one place that the urine does avoid with gravel, sand,
tough slime, yea sometimes mixed with blood and other things, and the kidneyes
be full of heat.

Afterward this grief and pain stretched even to the conduits of the urine,
and principally in fat folks, and before even to the priuities, and then
especially when they would make water. But because there be many decieued in
the knowledge of the stone, and adiudge otherwhiles the Colicke for the Stone,
and so come to use contrary medicines; therefore it is not without great need
that we make a declaration of both their differences.

The first is this, that the pain of the Kidneyes is not so sharp as the
pain of the Colicke. Secondly, the pain of the Colic does appear beneath in
the right side, and stretched her from thence upwards toward the left side.
Contrariwise, the pain of the kidneyes does begin from above, and so
descends softly downwards even unto the place where it does settle it self,
and stretched her a little more toward the back. Thirdly, the pain of the
kidneyes is much more forcible when he is fasting, and the pain of the Colicke
is by fasting and emptiness eased. Fourthly, the Colicke comes upon a
sudden: and to the contrary, the pain of the kidneyes comes in a longer
time. Fifthly, the Colicke will be taken and driven away, when the wind and the
ordure may have their expulsion or auoidance by Clisters, but the pain of the
gravel not. Sixthly, all Saxifrages and all other things that break the stone,
are good for the kidneyes and not for the Colicke. Lastly, there is found in
the urine gravel and sand, and not in the Colicke or pain of the guts.

By all these foresaid declarations one may easily adiudge whether this
diseases be in the kidneyes or in the bowels.

For to hinder and restrain the ingendring and growing of the gravel and
stone.. 1.
ANd that we may orderly proceed herein, heed is first of all to be taken how
the matter, whence the sand and stone is engendered, may be taken away, and how
that the unnatural heat may be tempered, the which is first to be done through
those things that do purge the same matter, as hereafter follows.

Take Electuarium Indum three dragmes, Agaricus one scruple, Ginger five
grains, temper them with a little white wine, and drink it up, and fast
thereupon four hours, then drink a cruse of sugared Barley water, and eat
four hours after it.

Or take Electuarium Diaphoeniconis one quarter of an ounce, Turbith one
dragme, Ginger one scruple, salt of Indy three grains, give it him with water
wherein Milium Solis is decocted, and then made warm with Sugar.

One more milder: Take Turbith one dragme and a half, Hermodactili one dragme,
Diagridij six grains, Salt of Indie two grains, Ginger half a scruple,
Annis and Masticke, of each three grains, Sugar pennets one ounce, white Sugar
half an ounce, steep them all together in three ounces of the water of
Smallage or the water of Maidenhaire throughout the whole night; after that
wring it out well and drink it; if so be that there appear any phlegmatic
matter, then may the patients vein be opened: but if so be that the matter fall
into the stomach, then is it advised that the patient be made to vomit, and how
the same is to be effected, look for that in the Register: for that through
vomiting the matter will be especially drawn away which would run toward
the raines. For this vomiting, be Radishes, Orage seeds, the middlemost peeles
of Elder, and Nux vomica to be used.

Some use Clisters, but they must be very easy and mild; but Suppositories are
much more praised for this disease. Item, all things which move urine, do also
let and hinder the growing of the stone or grauel. But first the mildest are to
be begun withal, like as with these following, as Licorice, etc. and where as
is heat, Melon seed, pompeon seed, Gourd seed, Cucumber seed, Sperage
roots or the water of them, fresh fennel, Hollihocke roots and the flowers.

Afterward are stronger things to be used, as Smallage, Maidenhaire, dry
fennel, yellow wild Rapes, Milium Solis, Louage, wild Smallage, Hares toongs,
wild Thyme, Pistacies, Radish seed, Tassels, Thistlin seed, and such like, the
ashes of Hares heads, of Wagtailes, prepared Bucks blood, Lapis Spongiae, and
Jews stone: of all these foresaid things may sirupes, Iuleps, confections,
powders, pills, salues, baths, and such like be prepared: and because the
unnatural heat is one of the chief occasions of the stone or grauel,
therefore are the foresaid cooling things to be used, and also all such
medicines which in this former chapter and 8.. be described.

To let the growing of the stone.. 2.
NOw for to let that the stone may grow no more, that consists in two kinds
of causes, viz. that one prevent the tough phlegm from growing which is the
cause of the stone, and that the unnatural heat get not the masterie.

But in this it chiefly consists, that one keep a good order of diet, and
eschew all that may cause that gross matter, as milk, and all that is dressed
with it, fresh Cheese, Cow beef, Swines flesh, Goats flesh, Geese, and all
water fowls, all gross fish, and all other that be without skales, all that
is not well baked, sandy, or is ground with a new sharped stone, Rice, Pease,
Beans, Coleworts, sower fruits, unripe apples and pears, Citrons, etc. and
hard sod eggs be also very hurtful, troubled water, red thick wine, Must and
Beer are also to be eschued.

But to the contrary, all light meats are to be used, as light and hard baked
bread which is a day or two old, wherein Fennel, Annis, Caruwayes, or Nardus
seeds are baked, Hens, pullets, Partridges, Capons, young mutton, Goats, Turtle
doves, Doves, and al wild fowls, but especially Wagtailes are very meet for
this sickness. He may also eat all river fish which have skales, as they that
are prepared with parsley: in like manner also poched eggs. For his drink he
shall take fair white wine tempered with a little water, wherein the seed of
Smallage and Fennel seed is decocted. Meade may also be used in stead of his
drink, and for a medicine. He may also drink sometimes pease broth, and the
broth of Lentils wherewith parsley is decocted; but he is not to eat the pease
at all. The kernels of bitter Almonds, of Peach stones, of Prune stones,
Pingles, Pistacies, and Raisins is he to eat: in fine, he must eschew all
which causes the matter of the stone to increase, and use all that cools the
unnatural heat, and expels the matter of the stone, for which these things
following are fit, and be very good, as Agaricus, Hermodactili, Turbith, wild
Saffron seed, roots of Polipodie, and the smell of the wine Hellebore, and
also a little root thereof steeped a day and a night in water, and the same
water drunk also otherwhiles.

Amongst the compounded things there is Benedicta laxatiua or Inda, which
cleanse the Kidneyes, the Bladder and Vreters of all phlegm. The same does
also Cassie given with diureticall things, and with beaten Licorice, for the
same dries not only the gravel, but hinders and lets also the growing
of the stone, and allayeth the heat; and if so be that one gives it him with
the seed of Agnus castus or Licorice, then does it help the raines
maruellously, and stirs no other humors then those whereof the stone does
grow.

Further, there be other things more which do cleanse the vreters or conduits of
urine, and open them, as the water of Hyssop, of white water Mints, and of
Marierom, of Smallage, of Parsley, of Betonie, of Penniroial, of Milium Solis,
and above al other the water of Hollihocks. Of Sirupes which be most used, are
the sirupes of Hyssope, de Calamintha, Acetosus compositus, Oxymel compositum,
and al other Oxymels, but especially the Oxymel of Squils: and for example,
these compounded things ensuing may be made: Take Oxymel of Squils one ounce,
sirupe of Hyssope half an ounce, water of Hearts tongue, and of wild Cucumbers,
of each one ounce and a half. This drink is to be taken certain days
together, until one may evidently see in the color of the urine and in other
signs, that the disease apparently frames it self on the better side, by the
which the Physicians have their especial marks and signs.

And in case there be such matter present which may cause the stone to grow,
then are they prepared through the first recited waters, sirupes, and such like
for expulsion; and when now the matter is prepared, then is the patient to be
purged, which may be done through this ensuing or such like means.

Take the confection Benedicta one ounce, or one ounce and a half, or somewhat
less, according to the importance of the cause, then temper them together with
three ounces of parsley water.

Or prepare this following, which cleanses much the kidneys, and expels the
matter of the stone maruellously: Take Centorie, peeled with Saffron seed, of
each one dragme, prepared Agaricus, powned Hermodactili, of each four
scruples, Diagridion six grains, Annis, Fennel, Licorice, the seed of
Smallage, and Ginger, of each half a scruple, Sugar pennets one ounce: steep
them all together the space of four and twenty hours in four ounces of the
water of Maidenhaire, afterward wring it out and drink it. Lastly, you are to
govern your self as in all other purgations.

This following is also much commended for to prevent the gravel: Take about
Saint John's tide Millet as it stands and bloometh, then burn it with herb
and root, and drink thereof evening and morning two or three ounces with
wine, and then fast two hours upon it, and do so five or six days together:
it is said, and also taken for to be certain, that doing this one shall be
clear and free from the gravel half a year.

Against the pain of the Gravel.. 3.
But if in this disease there happen great pain with it, through which the
Physicians are much hindered, that they cannot use due remedies; then do they
notwithstanding advise first of all, that at the first one is to begin with
things which allay the pain, or at the least do ease it: for which are
clisters to be used made of these herbs following, as Mallows, Hollihockes,
Beetes, Bearefoot, Pellitorie, and such like with the oil of Violets, with
Cassie, with Hiera picra, or the confection Benedicta tempered amongst it.

Secondly, when the foresaid pain is a little swaged, then are these things
following to be used: Take water Cresses, Mallows, Hollihocks, Mercury, Parow,
Cinkfoile, Peucedunum, the herb of Mew, and Rue, of each one handful, Calmus,
Barley, of each three ounces, Bran, Linseede, of each a little: let all these
sees together in sufficient water, and take twelve or sixteen ounces, temper
amongst it Hiera picra, Benedicta and Lithontribon, of each half an ounce,
oil of Cammomill and of Rue, of each one ounce: this Clister loses,
expels wind, and also the pain.

Item, take aftewards of the foresaid herbs, but somewhat more Watercresses,
and a few Marigolds, and make a bath thereof, and let the patient in it even up
to the navel: you are also to put some stalks of Rapes unto it, then will it
be the better.

Thirdly, take Mallows, Hollihock roots, Water cresses, Cammomil, Maidenhaire,
Linseed, and Fenegrake seed, of each two ounces; let them al sees in
sufficient water, wet a woollen clout or sponge therein, and lay it continually
warm upon ye place of the pain. The sodden herbs are you to powne small and
temper with Cammomil oil, and so lay them upon it. The place of the pain is
sometimes also to be anointed with these things following: Take the grease of
Hens, of Geese, Hogs grease, fresh butter, oil of Camelina and of Violets, of
each half an ounce, oil of Cammomils and Wax, of each two dragmes, then let
them melt together by the fire. But this is not continually to be used, to the
end that the raines be not thereby too much weakened and infeebled

After this anointing are these plasters following to be laid upon it, which
do assuage the pain, and will open the conduits of urine: Take three ounces of
Wheaten meal, of Fenegreeke meal, of Linseed, beaten Cammomils, of each one
dragme and a half, Salt one ounce, then make it to a plaster with the oil of
Camelina, and with the oil of Scorpions, and then lay it warm upon it. You
shall find hereafter many things more which allay the pain also.

Of those things which expel gravel and do break the stone.. 4.
IF there be any fear had of ye stone or grauel, or that one perceive it
already, then may these things be used for it: Take oil of Lillies, of
Scorpions, and of Earthwormes, of each a like much, anoint the raines very fat
with it by the fire, or by ^warme oven. And if you cannot get this Scorpion
oil, then take only the other oiles. Item, eat every morning 6. or 7. bitter
Almonds, or Peach kernels, like as is counseled before.

There is also much commended the bone of a Hare, which we call the Hares
spring, pouned, and the same drunken with fresh broth: when as any bodies
raines begin to grieve him, then is the red oil of S. John's wort esteemed to
be very good for to anoint him therewith.

Item take 18. or 20. Peach kernels, one quarter of an ounce of Raisins; eat
them together, and drink a good draught upon it, of pease broth sod without
salt or suet: for this is also much commended, the Cicers or Spanish pease
which have a special virtue against the gravel.

Item, take Hollihocke roots two pound; the same being made clean, powne them
and sees them in two or three quarts of water until the half, and then
strain this broth through a cloth, whereof you are every morning to drink a
good pull. Afterward use the foresaid potion of Cicers and Peach kernels; and
when you have a pound of this drink, then mix amongst it one dragme of beaten
Cinnamome, and as much of the Swams which grows on the wild Rose-branches.
You may also sees Parsley roots, Sperage roots, and Fennel roots with it,
and drink often of it: this is especially commended for them that would
withstand the gravel.

Item, take the roots of Pimpernell half an ounce, Bistorta, Tormentill,
Polipodie roots, and Annis, of each one quarter of an ounce, Gentian,
Fenegreek, Oculi cancrorum, peach kernels, Louage seed, the seed of Smallage,
Pickrels bones, shales of hasell nuts, the seed of Mallows, and Cammomill, of
each one dragme; make a powder thereof, and take thereof the weight of one
dragme, or one dragme and a half every day.

The ancient Physicians accustom to make this potion following, How to make
Williams potion.
the which they do call Williams potion: Take one handful of Alehoofe, young
Acorne buds half so much, the herb Mouse-eare a little, water and wine, of
each a pint; let them sees together until about the half be sodden away, then
strain it through a cloth, and drink thereof in the evening and morning, each
time about three spoonefuls, and every foureseene days make a fresh.

How the wine of winter Cherries is to be prepared, is amongst others dclared
in the eight part: it opens the conduits of urine maruellously, expels the
matter whence the stone and gravel does grow very vehemently, as well out of
the kidneyes vreters, as also of the bladder.

And now further to come to a right process of the Gravel, take at the first
five ounces of fresh oil of sweet Almonds, and drink the same warm. Two
hours afterward take a good draught of this potion following, and afterward
as often as you will: Take Mallows with the herb and roots, and Hollihocke
leaves, of each one handful, Licorice one ounce, fresh Butter and clear
Honey, of each two ounces; sees them together in sufficient water, or in the
water of Cresses, and so drink thereof as is expressed. The next day one is to
take this confection following early in the morning: Take fresh Cassie and
Benedicta, of each half an ounce, Species Iustini one dragme and a half;
temper them together, and then strew them with Sugar and Licorice. Having taken
this, then is the party to take thereupon presently a good draught of the
water of Cresses: and through this advice has many a one been released of the
gravel.

Or take of the confection Benedicta five or six dragmes, Turpentine washed in
water of Mallows, one quarter of an ounce; temper them al together with three
ounces of Agrimony water, and then drink it as warm as you can: it is
marvelous good against the stone.

Necessity does otherwhiles require that these confections following are to be
given to the patient: Take the confection Benedicta and washed Turpentine, of
each three dragmes and a half, Jews stone which is prepared with water wherein
Millet is decocted, one dragme; temper them all together with powned Licorice,
and then give it him with Cresses water. Men do also take sometimes for it
half a dragme of prepared blood of a Bucke also, which is not amiss.

Hereafter follows one other necessary mean or process: Pills for the stone.
and first in case the stone be in the bladder, then are these pills to be
prepared which do vehemently break the stone: Take the fruits of Balsam,
Radish seed, and the seed of great Smallage. Some do sake for this the seed of
stone Parsley, Opopanacum, Capers roots, bitter Almonds, Saxifrage, Squinanth,
Cipers roots, Indy Spica, Cassie wood, Hearts tongue, wild Rue, Gentian,
Hartwort, Asarabacca, Cardamome, Ammoniacum, Serapinum, Bdellium, long Pepper
and Calmus, of each a like much: the Gums are to be molten in sufficient
Balsam, temper the rest among them beaten small, and make it into pills: take of
them one dragme at once with the foresaid confection of Benedicta and of
Turpentine, as is before rehearsed: when he is purged, then take Pellitorie of
the wall, Mallows, of each one handful and a half, Linseed, Fenegreeke seed,
and Hollihocke roots, of each one handful, fifteen or sixteen Sebestes,
Licorice, powned Millet, of each half an ounce: cut all that is to be cut, and
let it boil in fresh broth. Take twelve or fifteen ounces thereof, and temper
amongst it one ounce of Benedicta, oil of bitter Almonds three ounces, slight
sugar one ounce and a half, Salt one dragme, and one yolke of an egg; then
mix them together, and set this clister very warm.

And if that this purgation (by reason of the vnpleasantnes of the Turpentine)
went against his stomach, then may he use one of these ensuing: Take fresh
Cassie one ounce and a quarter, oil of sweet Almonds four ounces, temper
them together, and drink it.

Or take Electuarium de Sebesten and Cassie, of each half an ounce,
Electuarium Indum one dragme and a half, mix them all together with Sugar, if
you will put therewith one dragme of Jews stone, and make it to a drink with
Millet water, then does it expel the better.

After this are you to come to the things which do break the stone easily, and
open the passages of urine. For to atchieue this, then is the body first of all
to be purged, and afterward are these following and elected remedies to be
used. By what means the stone to be broken.


To break the stone is this following very forcible: Take prepared Buckes
blood one dragme and a half, ashes of Scorpions one scruple, ten grains of
good Treacle, burnt and prepared glass one dragme, then sees Radishes,
Saxifrages, winter Cherries in water or wine, and take four ounces of this
broth, or as much Bean water, and make the foresaid a potion, and use it
fasting in the morning. In case that for all this the pain remains enduring,
then take scraped Licorice and Currants, of each one quarter of an ounce, pouned
Millet, Maidenhaire, of each half an ounce, sees them together in water of
Agrimonie, Pellitorie, or Cammomill water: take of this decoction two ounces
and a half, Spec. Lithontribi one quarter of an ounce, Philonium Romanum two
scruples, good wine two ounces, Sugar one ounce; then temper them all together
unto a potion, and drink it three hours before meat. Item, take prepared
Bucks blood one dragme and a half, Oxymel of Squils half an ounce, Wine
wherein Radishes be decocted, four ounces, then make a potion of it. Further,
it is necessary that the stomach be strengthened, and the hot matter of the
kidneyes expelled, for which is meet also the foresaid Clister, if there be put
unto it one ounce of Cassie more. Or use this following: Take twelve ounces of
Linseede oil, oil of bitter Almonds six ounces, Hens grease four ounces, or
in stead of that, as much fresh Butter, two yolks of Eggs, then mix them all
together, and minister it warm. You may also give unto the sick body oil of
sweet or bitter Almonds, of each three ounces and a half or more to drink;
for it is found, that the same taken by the mouth has more assuaged the pain,
than the which has been used in the Clisters. It is in like sort found to be
very good, that the place be fomented with these things following where the
pain is, and after that anointed: Take Cammomill, Maidenhaire, Linseed and
Hollihocke roots, of each one handful, sees them all together in white Wine
and water: then make a sponge wet in it, and lay the same wrung out very warm
upon it. For the anointing may many things be used, or like as hereafter
follows: Take oil of Scorpions one ounce, oil of sweet Almonds and Butter,
of each half an ounce, muscilage of Linseede, of Fenegreeke, of each five
dragmes, Saxifrage one dragme, and a little molten Wax, temper them all
together. The last and highest mean for the intolerable pain is, that the
Harcotica be used, which be things that take away all sense and feeling, thus:
Take the first described decoction, and put therein of the confection of
Lithontribon two dragmes, Philonium Romanum one dragme, oil of sweet almonds
one quarter of an ounce, good white Wine two ounces, mingle them all together,
and give thereof to drink. Will you then make a Clister of it? then take of
the foresaid decoction about two ounces, oil of sweet Almonds four ounces,
Philonium one dragme, Wine three ounces, and then minister it like as is
accustomed.

These two proceedings in this sickness, I thought good to described thus at
length, that every one might know how to choose of the medicines following what
is most needful for him.

First, we will describe all such things which are to be eaten, and may be used
in the body, and first of all beginning with the confections: Take sponge

one scruple, Sugar two ounces and a half, make a confection thereof with the
water of Mallows.

Fennel seed and Comin raw or confected and eaten, be good for all diseases in
the kidneyes of the stone and gravel. The confection of Iustini or
Lithontribon, as they be prepared at all well furnished Apothecaries, are also
marvelous good for this use.

In like manner also bitter Almonds confected and eaten, expel the matter
whence the stone does grow.

This following is also a very sumptuous Confection: Take burnt glass, and

Take Jews stone and Sponge stones, of each one dragme, the powder of a burnt
Hare one quarter of an ounce, Spec. Lithontribon one quarter of an ounce, Sugar
four ounces: make thereof with Saxifrage water tabulats or a Confection. This
foresaid Electuary provoke urine, and cleanses all the vreters of all slime

with the water of Sperage betimes in the morning, and also before both the
meal tides.

Glass, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as is needful for to
make a Confection. One may take a dragme or two thereof with a little water;
all according to the importance of the cause.

The Confection of horse Radishes is thus to be prepared: Take well cleansed
horse Radishes, The co^fectio^ or electuarie of horse Radishes.
cut them in round slices, and let them stand a steep in Vinegar until that
they be very soft; Or pour strong wine upon it, and renew the same every day,
and that the space of five or six days; at length sees them away therewith,
and rub them through a strainer: Afterward, take thereof one pound, and one
pound and a half of clarified honey, then let them sees together by a gentle

Or take in the stead of the same half an ounce of Cinnamom, Ginger three
quarters of an ounce, Cardamome, Cucubes, Cloves and Nutmegs, of each one drag.
and a half; temper them together: therewithal the fuming of the horse
Radishes in the head is abated and taken away. This confection is not only
good for the stone and gravel, but also for the stomach; it warmeth the
inward parts, and delayeth the pain in the belly which proceeds of cold; it
is a right Treacle for the common people, and an especial medicine for the
Scuruie.

There is also another confection prepared for this (called Electuarium de
Cineribus, The confection of ashes.
which is a confection of ashes, as follows hereafter:) Take ashes of burnt
Scorpions one quarter of an ounce, Cantarides without heads and wings one

dragme, of Roses as much as suffices for to make a confection of it, take
thereof morning and evening the quantity of a hasell nut at once, tempered
with the decoction of Cicers.

Item, take Mithridate or new Treacle, half or a whole dragme, with the
decoction of Cicers: they expel and break the gravel and the stone, and also
ease the pain, especially if it be used after bathing.

Amongst all other confected things, are especial good for the stone and
gravel (chiefly if one want warmth) the preserved Elecampane roots,
Pimpernell roots, Calmus, yellow Rapes, Parsneps, conserve of Gilloflowers,
and of Pionie: the water Cresses eaten for a sallad, expels the stone, the
gravel and urine.

There be diverse powders made for this which follow hereafter: Take prepared
Buckes blood half an ounce, Lapis Lyncis, Lapis cacrorum, and peach kernels,
of each one dragme, the seed of Parsley and Smallage, of each half an ounce,
beat them all together, and temper them all together, use thereof in the

Item, take Saxifrage, Annis, Pepper, the seed of Smallage, Gromell seed, and
Sperage seed, of each a like much, beat them all together very small, and let
them pass through a scarce, then take thereof half a dragme or a whole dragme
with honywater or with wine.

This following has oftentimes been approved: Take parched Peach kernels
half an ounce, Medlar stones one ounce, powne them very small, and then give
him a dragme thereof with the water of Saxifrage wherein Cinqfoile has been
decocted.

There is also one ounce, or one ounce and a half of Oximel to be put thereto,
and to temper the same with any water; that also expels the stone: but one
must beware therein for using any hot things.

This drink is also very requisite for this: Take wild Thistle roots, which
be the roots of Tassel, and roots of Smallage, of each one handful, Annis
half a dragme: sees them all together in a quart and a half of water unto
the half.

Item, take Sponge stones, Jews stones, burnt glass, prepared Buckes blood

reason of the great help and cure that they do, called the hand of God.

Item, take the roots of Burres one dragme and a half, burnt glass one

Fenelike with Saxifrage water.

Item, sees a Crabbe like as they be used to be sod, and wash the same with

Take half an ounce of the shales of hasell nuts beaten small, Sugar also as

for this these pills ensuing: Take burnt glass, ashes of a Hare, Sponge

of Saxifrage: also three round slices of Radishes eaten every morning be very
good. In like sort also the small bird the Wagtaile roasted, powdered, or taken
as one will, is marvelous good for this, like as here before is specified
already.

It is also taken for a certain experiment if one do accustom to eat
Nettles, that thereby he should be freed of the stone and gravel.

Now we will write of certain potions which be meet for the stone and the
gravel: Potions for the stone.
Take Turpentine which is washed with Mallows water, three quarters of an
ounce, Species Iustini two scruples, Benedicta Laxatiua half a dragme; let the
Turpentine and decoction melt, afterward temper the rest with it, and so
drink it as warm as you can.

Another. Take Rubarbe one quarter of an ounce, Juniper berries one ounce, the
bark of the Cassie three dragmes, Jews stone half an ounce, Agaricus,
Ginger, Cinnamome, Galmgall and Masticke, of each one dragme, Mithridate three
dragmes, Mace, Cloves, of each half a dragme, spirit of Wine one pint, and
Malmsey three pints: set them all together the space of three months in the
sun there to disti^l; and of this distillation give two ounces early in the
morning, or being in the bath, it is a marvelous and approved remedy.

Another. Take Rubarbe, G^nger berries, Cassie wood, and Fennel, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Annis one dragme, Licorice five dragmes, Jews stone half
an ounce, Agaricus, Ginger, Cinnamome and Cloves, of each one dragme,
Mithridate three dragmes, Mace and Nutmegs, of each half a dragme, Mastick one
dragme; put all these together beaten in a glass, and pour thereon three
pound of the spirit of Wine or Aqua vitae, then stop it tight, and set it the
space of five days in the sun; stir it all together very well, then pour
as much Malmsey unto it, and let it stand again eight or fourteen days in
the sun, stirring it every day well about, afterward strain it and keep it
well; when as the gravel begins to prick, then take a spoonefull thereof
every day, and you shall find amendment out of hand. This same may be distilled
like as the former.

Another. Take a pint of Aqua vitae more or less as you will, Malmsey four
ounces, Sugar Candy eight ounces, the water of Strawberries four ounces,
Parsley water two ounces; mix them together, and take a spoonefull thereof, or
as much as you please.

It is also here to be marked that you need not be afraid of Aqua vitae, burnt
Wine, or any other strong wine: for all learned do require to drink strong
wine, as Vinum punicum, Malmesey, Muscadell, and such like, against the grauel
or the stone, yea when the pain is at the extremest, yet with moderation.

Some that love distillations do very much commend this potion following
against the gravel: Take oil of Mace and clear Turpentine, of each ten or
twelve drops, Annis water and Fennel water, of each one quarter of an ounce,
the sirupe of Licorice one ounce, oil of Vitrioll three or four drops, then
temper them well together, afterward prove it; and if so be that it be not so
sower that it set the teeth on edge, then it is meetly; and if it be not sower
enough, then put two drops of the oil of Vitrioll more into it. It is somewhat
perilous to deal with the oil of Vitriol, therefore good heed is to be had
and taken, like as is declared in his description. Take Nettle seed two ounces
and a half, pour wine upon it, and drink thereof. This wine is accounted
marvelous good for the gravel and for the stone.

Here before is oftentimes admonshed of Bean water, which is thus made: The
water of Beans.
when they begin to be ripe, or when they be in their full juice, then is only
the outtermost green pods or peeles to be taken where the Beans do lie, and
the leaves, and all their moisture is to be distilled out of them in seething
water. This being done, then take one ounce and a half thereof, prepared Bucks
blood one dragme or four scruples, and give the patient thereof in the morning
when he rises, and at night when he goes to bed. And this is he to observe
and continue so long until that the stone or gravel be clean expelled, and
no more gravel can be perceived: this is of all ancient and latter Physicians
taken to be a famous and certain experiment. Item, take woman's milk about two
ounces, steep therein cut sprigs of Cipers, and let them stand and steep the
space of three or four hours in a warm place, and then drink it.

Item, take Knotgrasse half an ounce, red Pease, and peeled Melon seed, of
each one ounce, let them sees in twelve ounces of water even unto the half,
and give thereof one ounce at once tempered with a little Sugar: the meade or
honywater is an especial medicine against the gravel and the stone. In like
manner also wine or water wherein Hearts tongue and Mallows be decocted, and
also of both these distilled waters.

Item, take a good handful of Watercresses, sees them in a pint of water unto
the half, and drink thereof morning and evening, each time three or four
ounces, and do this the space of eight or ten days together. Some do also much
commend Limons water.

Take the roots of Cheruill and Saxifrage, of each a like quantity: sees
them in wine, and drink oftentimes thereof, it breaks the stone, and causes
well to make water. Or take Maidenhaire one handful, winter Cherries and
Gromell seed, of each two dragmes, boil them in a pint of white wine until two
thirds remain, take three or four ounces at once, and especially after a bath
the water of Larkes spur.

Likewise also the water of Carduus Benedictus, if one do drink three or four
ounces of it, is very good for the stone. Item, so are all these waters ensuing
good therefore, viz. the water of Saxifrage, of Pellitorie, of Cinqfoile, of
Watercresses, of Fennel, of Radishes, of Maidenhaire, of Strawberries and of
Cammomill.

Item, take a fresh Radish, cut it to thin round slices, and pour thereon
Vinum punicum, or any other good wine: afterward drink thereof sometimes a
good draught.

You have also herebefore in the twelfth chapter and eleventh. a good drink
against the gravel and the stone, beginning, Take Gentian, etc.

Item, take Maidenhaire, Sperage, Tassell leaves, water Mints, broad
plantaine, and red pease, of each a like quantity; sees them all together in
water, then take of this decoction five ounces, and temper therewith two ounces
of Oxymel; afterward give it to the patient. Further, lay him a bed and let
him sweat well: this opens the conduits of urine, makes altough humors
thin, and expels them which cause the stone and the gravel.

Further, there be diverse wines decocted and also vnsodden, whereof we will
discover some. Of all the most used are these following, as the wine of winter
Cherries, wine of Elecampane roots, wine of Hyssop, wine of Hearts tongue, and
wine of Assarabacca, which is thus to be prepared: Urine of Assarabacca.
Take Must, and to every quart of Must half an ounce of Assarabacca, the herb
being taken off when the root has been a drying the space of two months. Of
this wine take every evening and every morning a good draught: it forces the
urine and the gravel, it warmeth all inward parts, it expels the Ague, it
is good for the Dropsy, and also for the yellow Iaundies.

Another good Wine.
TAke Strawberrie leaves, Pellitorie, Water cresses, and Gourd cresses, of each
a like quantity: sees them in Wine until the third part be consumed, then
drink thereof a meetly draught when you go to bed, and in the morning when you
rise. This has been oftentimes found very good.

All Physicians do conclude, that all troubled and thick Wine, much and often
drunken, causes the stone and the gravel speedily to grow. Therefore must one
always beware thereof.

The Cherrie wine, like as it by reason of the temperate nature may be used in
all sicknesses; so may the same also be occupied for this disease, and
especially when the Cherries with their kernels be stamped in pieces, whereof
it is made, then does it drive out the gravel the better.

We will here yet describe certain sirupes which may be used with great
commodity for the gravel, like as these ensuing: Take the roots of Sperage,
of Ruscus, and of grass, of each three ounces, Hearts tongue with the roots,
Creta marina, Maidenhaire, water mints, Saxifrage, Pimpernell, and Yarrow, of
each one handful, red pease two ounces, Vinegar of Squils one ounce, white
Sugar and honey, of each six ounces. Lastly, sees a clear sirupe of this,
and use the same with diureticall waters.

Another.
TAke Fennel roots, parsley roots, the roots of Smallage and of Sperage, of
each one handful, the seeds of parsley, of fennel, of Smallage, of Annise,
of Caruway, of Lettice, of purslaine, of small Endive, of Melons, of pompeons,
of Gourds, and of Cucumbers, of each one ounce, red and white Saunders, Roses
and Violets, of each half a dragme, five and twenty or thirty dry prunes,
Hearts tongue, Liuerwort, Centorie, and Maidenhaire, of each two handfuls. All
these foresaid things sees in sufficient water unto the half and then wring
them out, unto this decoction put eighteen ounces of Sugar, and let it sees
again to a sirupe, and then clarify it with the white of an egg.

What outwardly ought to be used.
FOr the gravel and the stone may diverse things be also outwardly used,
whereof we shall hereafter write and discourse sufficiently, but we will first
begin with the salve.

Take the fat of the kidneyes of a Weather, stamp it very small, and temper
therewith a crusefull of the juice of water Cresses, or garden Cresses, and let
them sees together: this being done, then strain it through a cloth, and
anoint you therewith.

In like manner is also good for all grauel and pain of the raines, for the
stone and the conduits of urine, and for all diseases of the bladder, the
precious blame or oil, which, in the last part of this book, is the first of
all the rest that is described, if one be anointed therewith.

For a plaster is this following to be used: Take Hollihocke roots with the
seed, Linseed, figs, and butter, of each an ounce, oil of sweet Almonds two
ounces, Wax as much as is needful for to make a plaster, and then lay it
upon the kidneyes; afterward you are also to anoint the place of the raines
with the oil of Scorpions, and to spout some of that oil therein. Item, take
oil of Scorpions three ounces, burnt sponge stones, and burnt Wagtailes, of
each 3. dragmes, Jews stone one dragme, make a salve or a plaster thereof
with wax.

Item, in the former sixteenth chapter and the fifth. is described a plaster of
Radishes, which may also be used for this purpose. For this is also good a pap
made of the crumbs of white bread decocted with wine, and a little Saffron put
to it.

Item for to lay upon it: Take Pellitorie, put some Scorpion oil unto it, oil
of Cammomil and some oil of Camelina; fry them all together in a pan until
it be as thick as pap, afterward put amongst it powned Saffron, and then lay
it upon the kidneyes.

Item, take Pellitorie, Spikenard, Spica Romana, Fennel seed, parsley seed,
wild yellow Rape seed, and Assarabacca, of each one handful, powne them
somewhat together, and put it in a bag, afterward let it sees in wine and lay
it over the raines.

Of bathing and fomenting in the gravel.
AL they that can come to the warm sulphur bathes, may frank and freely use
them, for these be very necessary for to break the stone.

But if so be that one cannot come at them, then let this following be
prepared: Take Hollihocke leaves, Fennel, parsley with the roots, Pellitorie
and Linseed, of each one handful; put them together in a bag and sees them in
a great kettle of water, afterward let it be meetly cold without putting any
other water unto it: then set the patient in it even to the navel, as long as
he can abide. This is to be often used, and so long until that the patient do
find that the stone wears away.

Another, take Pellitorie, Lauender flowers, parsley seed, Fennel seed, wild
yellow Rape seed; sees them all together (as is aforesaid) and bathe
therewith. The bag is also to be laid upon the kidneyes.

Item, take the herb Horsetaile, Mallows, wild Thyme, the stalks of Rapes,
put them all together in a bag, and sees them in a great kettle with water;
and further, let it be meetly cold of it self, and used as before.

When one has then bathed a certain space, then are diureticall potions and
salues of the raines to be used, made of such things as are described
herebefore.

These are now the principallest things which of the ancient and latter
Physicians are described against the gravel and the stone of the bladder: also
whatsoever else is prescribed for the infirmities of the kidneyes, that is for
this most meet and convenient.

There be also more accidents which are wont next to the gravel and the stone
to accord and accompany it, as Lithiasis, Dysuria, Stranguria and Ischuria,
and all these bring also great pain and sometimes swellings, whereby the
conduits of urine be stopped: but because that these altogether belong but to the
bladder and the neck of the same, therefore will we discourse thereof after
the description of the Bladder.

But there is yet a heavy disease which proceeds from the kidneyes, the
which we are here to describe, and therewith to conclude this Chapter.

When any one cannot hold his water.. 5.
THis disease the Grecians call Diabeten, the Latinists Vrinae profluuium,
which is an unnatural flux of the urine: with the great pain which is with
this disease there is an excessive and intolerable thirst, the which when one
thinks to quench with drinking, then does all that is drunk pass straight
away from him, and is without any alteration of the same drink pist out again
altogether, whereby this disease has his name also Profluuium.

Well now, this is a disease of the kidneyes, which is wholly to be compared
with the disease of the stomach in the flux Lienteria: in which disease of the
stomach or flux, there is no satiablenes of meat because that the meat
received, forthwith undigested and without any alteration passes out through
the bowels.

And albeit (as is said) this unnatural heat of the Raines comes from the
Liver, the which afterward does draw unto it the moisture which is received of
the stomach, then does this disease nevertheless for all that come from the
cold of the kidneyes and of the whole body, like as may be seen in them who
get the palsy, and cannot hold their urine. If it proceed of heat, then it is
known by the pain and pricking about the kidneyes, and by the great thirst.
If of cold, that is to be perceived about the same parts, and in the outward
members, for cold things offend him, and all warm things are acceptable.

By all these forementioned things are yet the tokens that in pissing there is
no pain, and that there is stopping of the stale: when this sickness grows
to be old, whether it be in aged or young persons, then is it esteemed to be
incurable, for that it consumes the body from day to day, and that so long,
until that death follow after it.

The cure of these sicknesses depend on these rules ensuing, whereof the first
is, like as this disease is caused most out of heat and dries of the
kidneyes, so is the same to be remedied though cooling and moist things:
secondly, if so be that the retentiue force of the kidneyes be infeebled
through the superfluous moisture which they do draw unto them, then are men to
strengthen the same (if it be caused through heat) with astringent and cooling
things, and to alter their nature: thirdly, because that the whole body through
the attraction and affluence of all waterish moisture, waxes faint and
thirsty; therefore it is good not to permit the sick person to drink much,
that he fall not utterly thereby into the consuming ague Marasmum: fourthly, if
so be that the sickness be caused through heat, and that the liver and the
stomach be also thereby infected, then is he to eschew all light meats and
eggs: fifthly, to the end the moisture may be drawn to another place, then is
after much drinking of water parbraking and vomiting to be provoked: sixthly,
all that draws the moisture outward, as the sweat, is here very profitable:
seventhly, like as the body in this sickness is commonly bound and obstructed,
therefore is care to be had to open the same with Clisters.

And like as we have expressed that this disease Diabetes can be caused through
heat and cold, therefore will we write distinctly and severally thereof, and
first begin with the cold Diabetes.

Of the effluxion of the urine through cold.. 6.
THough now it happens (like as we have discoursed here before) that the
sick persons do make water very much, and yet no heat perceived thereby, or
that a nights his urine unwitting run from him, and had also no thirst and
abated not, then are all such medicines to be given him which do stay the
urine: for which these things following shall be very meet: To wit, eggs supt
early in the morning fasting, steeled milk, or wherein peeble stones be
slacked; but especial is the sheep milk commended for it.

Some do advise that for this disease is every day to be taken half a dragme
or a dragme of Mithridate with a good draught of wine. These pills following are
also highly commended for this disease: Take Beuercod, Myrrh, Hissope,
Marierom, Acorne cups, and Pieratrion, of each a like quantity, make them to
powder; then take the sirupe of Mirtles, and form a mass of pills thereof;
afterward then give a dragme thereof at once, to wit, when the patient goes
to bed. Or use this powder following: Take Acorne cups, powne them to powder,
and take thereof one quarter of an ounce at once with red Wine before that you
go to bed. Item, take a burnt Hedgehog powdered one dragme, or one dragme and
a half, and give it him as before; the flesh of an Hedgehog is marvelous
good for this. Item, take Acornes one dragme, Frankincense three ounces, and
six dragmes of prepared Coriander, fine Bolus and Gum, of each one ounce and a
quarter, then make a powder of it, and take every morning thereof one ounce and
a half with red wine. Item, take powned Agrimony one dragme with red wine when
you go to bed.

Outwardly may some of these things following be used: Take oil of Lillies, or
oil of Costus, anoint the priuities with it and the parts about it: but
temper amongst it some fine Bolus, Masticke, Momie, Myrrh, and make a salve of
it. Or lay one of these plasters following upon it: Take Laudanum and
Masticke, of each one ounce, Frankincense, Cipers nuts, of each one dragme,
Lignum Aloes, red Stirax, Calmus, Galingall, Cinnamom, of each half a dragme,
Turpentine one dragme, or as much as is needful, melt the Laudanum in a warm
mortar, then make a plaster thereof, and lay it over the priuities; but first
shave off the hair, that the plaster may be taken off without pain. Or make
this following: Take Laudanum and Mastick, of each two dragmes, Lignum Aloes,
red Storax, Galingal and Quince kernels, of each one dragme, Turpentine one
ounce; powne all that is to be powned, and add the Laudanum unto it as before,
spread it on leather and apply it to the priuities.

Another. Take the juice of Mints twelve ounces, Frankincense and Masticke, of
each half an ounce, Cipers nuts one quarter of an ounce, Galingall, Lignum
Aloes, of each one dragme, Cinnamome, or beaten Comin seed as much as is
needful for a plaster, use it as is before showed.

It is to be noted that the Comin seed must be parched before. What further is
requisite for this purpose, it may be sought for in the third part, the 11.
Chapter, and also in the 12. chapter, in the first part, and 13..

For the affluxion of urine through heat.. 7.
IF so be that there be with this unnatural affluxion of the urine an
unnatural thirst, and the drink forthwith pist out again, then are these
means following to be used: first, in case that the body be bounden, then
minister to the patient laxatiue clisters of the common cooling herbs,
wherewith Hiera picra or Benedicta with the oil of Violets be tempered; and
immediately afterward open the liver vein, whereby all the ill accidents of
the body may be defended and avoided.

And if it be needful, purge the patient with yellow Mirobalans and with
Cassie, which both do cool. But if you will make it that it be good for the
gravel, then mix things amongst it which expel the gravel: afterward cause
the patient to vomit when he has drunken much water, like as is taught in the
sixth rule.

Otherwise is this ensuing especially commended for this disease Diabetes: Take
Acacia one quarter of an ounce, Rose leaves three dragmes, fine Bolus, Gum, and
Dragagant, of each half an ounce; powne them all small together, and let it
pass through a small sieue: afterward make it into small Trocisces, with the
muscilage of Fleawort, and give thereof the weight of a dragme with Endive
water, Burrage and Cicorie water. Item, take fine Bolus and Sealed earth, of
each one scruple, the juice of Sloes, Pomgranate flowers, Myrtle seed, red
Coral, and Roses, of each one dragme; make a fine powder thereof, when he
goes to rest, with thick red wine: or take the innermost rinds of hens mawes,
wash them clean with wine, and dry them, the powder of a burnt Hares head and
Mastick, of each half an ounce, Agrimony five dragmes, burnt powder of an
Hedgehog half an ounce, temper them all together, and powne them all small to
powder; afterward give thereof one dragme and a half with red Wine when he
goes to sleep.

Another. Take Nettle roots one handful, Veruaine and Caruway, of each one
handful and a half, sees them together in steeled water, and drink thereof.

Item, take Sorba and pears, stamp them together, distill a water thereof,
and drink often of it, or mingle any other drink amongst it.

Outwardly may these things following be used: stamp cooling herbs, viz.
Lettice, Purslaine, Nightshade, Housleeke, Rose leaves, and Willow leaves. Or
cut fresh Pompeons or Citrons in broad pieces and lay them thereon: you may
also wear a beaten plate of led upon the raines, the which may be made
oftentimes wet with Vinegar.

Also prepare this salve ensuing: Take three ounces of Poplar salve, oil of
Roses, and oil of Mand^agora, of each half an ounce, the muscilage of
Fleawort one quarter of an ounce, Vinegar one dragme, Wax as much as is
needful for to make therewith a salve. Item, take the juice of Lettice, of
Purslaine and of Nightshade, of each one dragme and a half, Rose water one
ounce, Vinegar half an ounce, white beaten Poppie seed one ounce, Wax as
much as suffices for a salve, and anoint the raines with it.

After the anointing lay then this plaster following upon it: Take Barley
meal, Vinegar, and oil of Roses, let them sees together, and lay it thereon.
Or take Vine leaves, Willow leaves, Quince leaves, Tassell leaves, and
Housleeke, of each one handful, stamp them well together, and put unto it
six ounces of Barley meal, oil of Roses and Vinegar, as much as suffices
for to make a plaster, then lay it cold upon it.

The order of diet.
ALl meats that do cool are good for this patient, as Veriuice, the juice of
Ruscus, Barley, and all that is dressed with Barley, Almond milk, and Rice, all
fruits which cool and bind, as Medlars, Sorba, Sloes, Cherries, sometimes also
plums, Mulberies, Pomegranates, and Strawberries are also good for him. If
there be neither heat nor Ague with it, then may he have the foresaid things
dressed, as Barley, Rice and Almonds with fresh broth. He may also use otherwhiles
Neates feet and river fish, but very little salted. Also hen-broth decocted
with cooling seeds is very good for him. His best drink shall be Barley water,
wherein a little Fleawort is decocted. Buttermilke is also good for him. The
juice of the first mentioned fruits may be mixed with fresh Well water, and so
drunk: in like sort also the Rose water of it self alone. Thick red wine is
also (as before) to be tempered with fresh well water. For this is also meet
the sirupe of Violets, or Iulep of Violets, with some cooling waters, or
tempered with some well water.

You have also herebefore in the twelfth chapter and 3.. other Iuleps and
Confections more which be also very fit for this use, as Triasantalon and
Diarrhodon Abbatis, therefore is he to take now the one and then the other, to
the end that nature chance not to abhor and loath that which is to be taken.

For an intolerable thirst may this following be used: Take burnt Iuorie ten
dragmes, Lettice seed and Purslaine seed, of each fifteen dragmes, Coriander
seed, yellow Rose seeds, and fine Bolus, of each five dragmes, Pomegranate
blossoms one quarter of an ounce, Camfer half a dragme; then make a powder of
it, and use one dragme thereof, or one dragme and a half at once with the juice
of pomegranates.

What is further good for the thirst, look for it in the twelfth Chapter and
10.. in the third part of this book.

This patient must restrain and keep himself from all labor, and
conversation or company of women. Also to eschew all sower things, and to
perform and do in all things like as herebefore in the sixth Chapter and 1.. is
taught of the eftluxion of humane seed.

The eighteenth Chapter. Of the Bladder.
THis inward part the Bladder is common to all humane bodies; it is made of two
strong skins or membranes, whereof the innermost skin is twice as strong as
the outmost, and that not in vain, but to the end it might the better
withstand the sharpnes of the urine. Both these skins are formed of a
slipperie white matter: and between both the skins or membranes there run
many veins, sinews and arteries every way, whereby they do draw the moisture
of the Vreters, which do come from the Raines, and do carry it into the
Bladder.

For the foresaid Vreters be so small and so narrow, that one cannot in a dead
body discern nor find the same; like as also the bladder of beasts does
manifest the same, which is so tight and so shut up, that no water nor wind can
pierce through.

In men does this Bladder lie with his neck (which is fleshie) very hard
besides the Arseg^t, crooked, and almost like this letter S, great and long
even to the beginning of the Yard. But in women the neck of the bladder does
lie somewhat higher then the neck of the womb, it is also shorter and wider,
and therefore also they may much easier be helped of the stone then men. Item,
in the forepart of the neck of the bladder there is a muskellish flesh, the
which holds the urine so long shut up, until a body desire to make or let
go his water. Further, men's bladders be also according to the proportion of the
body, much bigger than in any beasts: they can also stretch themselves very
far, whereby they in time of need may retain and keep a great quantity of
urine.

Whenever this bladder also is pricked in her membrane substance, or a hole
made in it, then is it incurable; notwithstanding that Aristotle does think
that it has been healed, but very seldom: for the neck of the bladder, which
we have said to be fleshie, may be healed without plaster or salve, and only
through the urine, like as is sufficiently made known and showed by the stone
cutters.

Amongst beasts, they only have bladders which bring forth a living creature
into the world, and that have lights full of blood. But all that do lay eggs, as
fowls and worms, they have altogether no bladder, the Tortoise only excepted.

This bladder is by nature ordained for a receiver of the urine, and to the
body a very needful member; for if so be that nature must have expelled all
her waterish moisture throughout all the whole body, not having any particular
vent or passage for it, then of necessity should a body oftentimes either
dry away or stifle.

To this bladder do also happen oftentimes many sundry diseases and perilous
infections, as the gravel, the stone, painful making of urine, retention of
the same, the Strangurie, slime, obstruction through blood, the which does not
only cause heat, swelling ulcers, and deadly impostumes, but also brings
with it many kinds of other perils: and because that we herebefore have written
at large thereof, therefore will we not here rehearse them again, but only
speak and discourse of those things that concern the bladder and the neck of
the same.

Of retention of urine in general.. 1.
Under the name of the retention of urine we do comprehend all accidents,
whereby the water is retained and kept back, whereof there be five kinds
disclosed in the seventeenth chapter, in the conclusion of the fourth. and here
are to be rehearsed. Amongst all these is the one more violent then the other,
and for that cause are to be cured and helped with diverse and sundry remedies.

First, we will speak of the disease which the Grecians do call Lithiasm,
which is when the stone of the bladder relying on the neck of the same,
hinders the passage of urine, or causes such a distention of the yard and
foreskin, that this and the stone together does wholly hinder and keep back
the urine, which is not without great pain and trouble to the patient: but
these means following are to be used in this extremity.

If so be that the stone of the bladder cannot be expelled through the former
remedies, then put back the stone and so let out the urine. First, the patient
is to be laid on high with his arse, and spread his legs abroad, and shake and
rub the place strongly, that thereby the stone may be removed from the neck of
the bladder, or the same is to be put back with a silver instrument, that
thereby the urine might freely pass forth. But great care is to be had whether
the passage for the urine be not shut up by some swelling, otherwise would the
yard within thereby be bruised, and the grief made worse then before.

The second manner of the retention of urine is Dysuria, which is when a man
does make water with great grief and pain very slowly, the which is commonly
perceived by the pricking pain and great heat in the forepart of the yard.

The third kind of the retention of urine is called Stranguria, which is when
one is constrained to make water often, and that with a few drops at once.
These two sorts of retention of urine, are so like one to the other, that few
Physicians can sever them, yet nevertheless have they some differences.

Both these kinds are caused of a sharpness of some humor and of the urine:
or through the debilitie of the muscles and of the retentiue power. For if
there come any sharp or corroding humor into the bladder, then will it
presently by force expel the same without any intermission.

Or if the retentiue virtue of the bladder be weakened, then can it not abide
the least dissension in the world, but let the urine continually pass forth as
an intolerable burden.

Ischuria detaineth the urine altogether, and is caused diversely, to wit, of
heat, of the hardness of the passage, of the debility of the expulsive and
force of the retentiue virtue, and of the forementioned disease Lithiasis.

Also if there be any gross and tough slime gathered together in the passage
of the urine, or if there be any clotted blood, through blows or falls settled
in the bladder, which there do hinder the course of the urine.

In like manner also when the kidneyes and the bladder do rankle and impostumate.

Lastly (as it oftentimes has been found) when the water is long held up.

And albeit there be many sorts of this retention of urine, which at the last
may cause impostumes, ulcers, and much pain: yet is this the total sum and
conclusion, that all of them that detain or hinder the free passage of the
urine, do require but one kind of remedy. Notwithstanding we will in this our
discourse following (as much as shall be possible) show some differences in
them.

Although there have been diverse causes showed before of this disease, yet (to
prosecute our accustomed method) we will recite them once again: namely, if
one have fallen hard, or have had a blow or bruise on the bladder. Item the
tumors and impostumations which do stop the passage of the urine. Also when the
back or any other part of the body is bruised, and the blood fallen down into
the bladder, and there lies clotted. Likewise thick tough slime or
corruption, or other causes more, etc. whereof partly has been spoken of
before in the 16. chapter and 7.. and partly shall be entreated of hereafter
more at large.

The signs of this malady are these: if it proceed of any outward cause,
that may be inquired of the patient. Or if the same be caused through congealed
blood, stone, slime or corruption, then may the same matter be perceived by the
urine, and by the pain of the place infected, whence the matter comes. Also
by the silver probe, whereby the stone may be felt, or by the blood and slime
which remains on the instrument being drawn forth.

Of the pain which is caused by the retention of the urine.. 2.
WE have amongst other things before made mention of gravel, whereby not only
the patient is grieved with great pain, but also the Physician is hindered
from the application of those remedies as may seem meet for him: wherefore it
is specially advised, first to delay the pain, or at the least to diminish it;
for the which these remedies following are especially commended.

All gentle Clisters, easy purgations, and above all others, baths of warm^
water, wherein Mallows, Hollihocke roots, and Nettle roots, Gromell seeds,
or any such like mollifying things and Saxifrages are decocted, wherein these
patients are oftentimes to bathe themselves even to the navel.

Item, take Colewort leaves, Southernwood, Rosemary, pigeon dung, wild Saffron
seeds beaten grossly: sees them all together in water for a bath. Or take
Mallows, Hollihock leaves, Pellitorie of the wall, Southernwood, Creta Marina,
Fenegreeke seed, Hollihock seed, of each two handfuls; sees them all together
unto a bath. Afterward anoint the kidneyes with the oil of Scorpions, or
with any of the foresaid salues.

With this bath may this powder following also be used with the decoction of
pepper: Take the seeds of Purslaine and of small Endive, of each half a
dragme, Dill seed two scruples, Marierom half a scruple; give this to the
patient when the pain is present.

Note also that these two meats be very good, both for the retention of the
urine, and also for the strangurie. And if so be this be helped, then will the
pain which is in the end of the Yard seen cease.

In the description of the kidneyes there may you see many plasters, salues
and oiles, as that of Anodynum, and others more, which are very meet for this
purpose.

Of the stopping of the urine through the debilitie of the virtue expulsive.. 3.
IF any one be hindered in the making of his water, or that the same be
altogether stopped without any swelling, ulcer, or pain of the Kidneyes, it is
then to be censured that the same should come through the debility of the
virtue expulsive: against the which such things shall be used as are
diureticall, or that do provoke urine, as these pills following: Take the seeds
of Smallage, Saltpeter, Madder, great Smallage, Juniper berries, Asarabacca,
Ameos, Fennel, Spica, and bitter Almonds, of each one ounce and a quarter,
Melons five dragmes, Cantharides (the heads and wings cut away) half a dragme,
Ammoniacum one dragme and a half; dissolve your gum in wine, and mix all the
rest being beaten small amongst it; then make pills of them of the bigness of
peason, give three of them at one time. These pills have an especial efficacy
for to dry the body, so that they are accounted very good for the Dropsy.

The Electuarium Ducis is also very good for this purpose, if thou give one
quarter of an ounce of it with pease broth or wine, which thou will.

There was not long since one cured with this remedy following, who for the
space of five days could never make his water: first he took this clister:
Take Pellitorie of the the wall two handfuls, Mallows and Cammomill, of each
one handful, boil them together; then take of this decoction the accustomed
quantity, and temper amongst it one ounce of Cassie, oil of Cammomill three
ounces, Turpentine one ounce, Licorice one quarter of an ounce, minister it
warm.

Secondly, this following was also ordained for him: take Cassie and
Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Benedicta Laxatiua two dragmes,
prepared Jews stones one dragme, make an Electuarie thereof with Oxymel. At
night he took two ounces of Oxymel with the water of Maidenhaire, and
presently after this he made water.

Item, take four or five ounces of the juice of Pellitorie of the wall, and
clarify it with the white of an egg, then sees it with sugar to a sirupe,
and use three ounces thereof every morning with the water of Mallows, or with
any such like distilled liquor.

This done, give unto the patient a purgation of Cassie. Thirdly, take
Coriander seeds half an ounce, Mallows one handful, one head of Garlic,
powne them altogether, and sees them with good white wine until that one
third part be consumed, and give him thereof three ounces to drink.

Peach kernels and the kernels of Cherrie stones do also provoke urine. Item,
preserved Pimpernell roots, Calmus, and the roots of Eringus are also very
good for this purpose, confected Louage seed, Annis seeds, Fennel seeds,
Caruway seeds, Comin seeds, and Saxifrage seeds, these do expel all urine,
gravel and stone. Treacle and Mithridate do also cause one to make water.
Item, the confection of Cherries with their kernels beaten in pieces, and rub
it through a strainer is also meet for this use: also half a dragme of dried
Grasshoppers is very fit, and a great secret in this disease. Item, the stone
which is cut out of a living body, and used as before has been showed in the
expulsion of gravel, is also very convenient and commodious for this intent.

Take Tormentill, Pionie, Bistorta, Acornes and wild Flax, of each a like
much, powne them all together, and take thereof in the evening and morning one
dragme with wine. The Spanish flies do expel urine most violently, but beware
of them because they be very sharp, and exulcerate the vreters; but the
Grasshoppers are somewhat milder. Item take the roots of Pimpernel beaten small
as much as one can contain between his two fingers, and drink it with wine.
The powned shells of Hasell nuts do the like also, and the jaws of Pickerels,
if thou take of each of them a like quantity.

But if the urine be stopped by reason of the stone in the bladder, then give
unto the patient two small drops of the oil of Sulphur with wine or Agrimonie
water: or beat a Radish very small, press out the juice of it, and take half
an ounce thereof with wine; it provoke urine immediately, and breaks the
stone also. Item, drink in the morning three or four ounces of Radish water
very warm, and fast two hours after it. In like manner also two in the
evening two hours before supper, and walk after it.

Another. Take Mallows and Garlic, of each a little, sees them in wine
until the third part be wasted away, drink three or four ounces of this
decoction at once. Or take Balsamina altera and the lesser burre leaves, boil
them together in wine, and drink it as before. Take a great Onion, cut it
small, and Mallows one handful, boil them in wine, and drink oftentimes of
the decoction being warmed.

If a child could not make his water, then take ten or twelve bitter Almonds,
and ten or twelve Peach kernels, and two ounces of Currants, stamp them all
together, strain them through a cloth with water like to Almond milk, and
give it the child to drink like Almond milk.

Amongst the herbed wines are especially commended for the provoking of urine
the wine of Elecampane, of Hearts tongue, of sweet Marierom, of Cherries, of
Assarabacca, and of winter Cherries, which are also mentioned before in the
treatise of the gravel. But if any one might not drink wine at all or that he
had it not, then may he drink Meade or Honey water, which is also very good.
What sirupes and other things might be used for the provoking of urine, that
has sufficiently been showed before in the discourse of the gravel. But
Oxymel compositum and the sirupe of Vinegar are for this use very highly
commended. Clisters are of no small force in this disease, but especially when
they be made with Benedicta and the oil of Scorpions.

Amongst the outward remedies are the forementioned bathings the especiallest
and the most highly commended.

Hereafter follow the descriptions of salues and plasters. Take a sliced
Radish, sees it to pap, and temper amongst it the oil of bitter Almonds and
the oil of Scorpions with a little wax, then spread this very thick upon a
cloth, and so lay it upon the priuities. Item, take Turpentine, oil of
Scorpions and of bitter Almonds, of each a like quantity, and a little molten
wax, then temper them together, and therewith anoint the whole priuities.

Another. Take the oil of Scorpions, of Costus, of Lillies, of Dill and Duckes
grease, of each half an ounce, Pellitorie of the wall and Saxifrage beaten, of
each one dragme, Comin three dragmes, wax as much as suffices for a salve.
For this you may also use the balmes and oiles which are described in the eight
part, like as shall be showed there more at large.

Here before in the affluxion of the humane seed, is also admonished that the
navel is to be filled with a little old suet either of an Ox or of a Heart;
the which is also an expert remedy for the making of water, but that is
oftentimes to be used. The oil of S. John's wort should also expel urine if
one be anointed warm with it.

If now there be any body which cannot make water, then cut two great Onions,
and put a spoonful of Caruways unto it, pour then thereon some Sallad oil;
afterward fry them all together, and spread it on a cloth two handfuls broad
and meetly long, and so lay it as before upon the priuities as warm as can be
suffered: do this six or seven times together, it helps evidently. Item,
take Pellitorie of the wall, fry it in oil, and so lay it warm on the
priuities. Some do write that the fat of Conies anointed on the priuities and
on the kidneies, should maruellously expel urine. Likewise also the oil of
Bayberries, of Cammomil and of Scorpions. The detension of ye urine of what
cause soever it be caused, this ensuing is good for it: take live or dead wood
lice, lay them over the priuities before, and then pluck over the foreskin:
these and Cony fat are by some very highly commended: also ye foreskin is to be
put over the anointing with cony fat.

This ensuing is also highly commended for women when they cannot make water:
Take fled Goats horn and Maidenhaire, of each a like quantity, make them to
powder, and strew them on a new hot tile: put this into a close stool and set
the woman upon it, then sprinkle wine ^n the tile to the end she may receive
the vapor beneath: this is to be done twice or thrice a day, according as the
obstruction of the urine is great. But if this malady seem wholly to get the
maistery, then take the water of picked Plantaine, make Almond milk with it,
and drink thereof twice or thrice a day, it is also especial good. And if so
be that the sharpness of the urine had made any excoriation, then anoint the
place with the oil of Eggs. And if a woman with child cannot make her water,
then is she to take yellow Rose seeds and sees them in wine; when the pain is
somewhat assuaged, then give thereof to drink: afterward make a little oil
of Lillies warm, and anoint therewith the Raines and over all the belly.
Item, take Sage and Wormwood, of each one handful, Rye meal one spoonefull;
sees them all together, and let the woman sitting on a close stool receive of
the vapor.

You have also in the fifth Chapter and 1.. somewhat else which is also meet
for this purpose.

Of the retention of urine through falls or blows.. 4.
IF the retention of the urine come of any outward cause, as of falls or of
blows, then must good heed be taken if so be that thereby any coagulated or
clotted blood, not only in the bladder, but also in any of the inward parts,
came to putrify, like as in the stomach, in the breast, and elsewhere, then
may great sorrow and trouble proceed of it, yea death it self; for that there
follow great faintness after it, great weakness of the whole body, and the
pulse will be so small that one can scarce feel it.

And to remedy the same, is the Liver vein of the sick person to be opened,
and the bruised place irrigated from on high, oftentimes with warm water
wherein Cammomill, Melilot, and Roses be decocted. Afterward is the sick
person to be anointed with this salve ensuing: Take Myrrh and Masticke, of
each one dragme, oil of Roses one ounce, oil of Dill half an ounce, Wax as
much as is needful.

But if the pain will not abate and cease, and that it appear that the bruise
will come to an impostume and heat, and an ague stick unto it, then open the
Saphea.

If the patient be bound, then are milder clisters and purgations to be used,
and the patient is to keep himself as sober in eating and drinking as may be
possible the space of two days, and afterward to diet himself like as one
that has an Ague is wont to do. The place is to be fomented with the foresaid
herbs, and thereupon to anoint it with warm oil of Violets, and with oil
of Cammomill. The bladder is softly to be wrung from the top even to the
priuities: also an Ox bladder may be filled with this decoction following and
laid upon the priuities.

Take Mallows, Cammomill, Rape leaves, Melilot, Violet leaves and Linseede,
sees them together, and make a felt or sponge wet in it, and lay it warm upon
it. You may also make a bath for the loins thereof, putting thereto some
Hollihocke roots, Onions, Garlic, and Colewort leaves powned all together;
sees them and wring them out well, then put them in a bag which has a hole in
the middle to put the yard therein, and that he may lie upon it. Item, take
Wormwood, put it in a bag, sees it in wine and wring it well out, then lay it
upon the priuities as is expressed, and admonish the patient that he endeavor
himself to piss oftentimes.

This ensuing is not only good foor the clotted blood in the bladder, but also
for all other places of the body, be it of whatsoever occasion it may be: Take
Wormwood, Fennel, Smallage, the seed of the yellow root, red Storax, peeled
Melon seed, and Radish leaves, of each a like quantity, make a powder of them,
and give thereof between one and two dragmes with Asses milk, or with water
wherein Fennel roots, and the roots of Smallage, of Parsley, of Sperage, or
of Ruscus be decocted.

Of the retention of urine through some obstruction of the conduits.. 5.
IF so be that it happen that this retention or painful making of water do vex
or pain a body, and yet nevertheless the bladder is full of urine, and that
the patient had pist any blood or matter before: then, are those remedies to be
given him which do open, and which do attenuate the clotted blood and
corruption in the bladder, and make it fluxible: therefore one must first begin
to wring the priuities hard, that thereby the lowermost passages may be opened,
and the urine may run out. Now if so be that this obstruction do come of
clotted blood, of matter, or of slime, then are Sperage water, Saxifrage water
and Radish water especially good for it. In like manner is also very good the
broth of red Pease, of Fennel roots, of Parsley roots, and of Smallage, of
each apart, or boiled together. Also Limon water is very much commended for
this use. Item Treacle, good Mithridate, and most of all that which is declared
in the retention of the urine.

Also Salt water, or this following may be spouted into the Bladder, which may
draw out the urine through their sharpnes: take burnt ashes of Fern, Vine
ashes and lime, of each a like quantity, pour as much water upon it until it
be covered, let it stand so the space of three days; afterward pour it
through a tight cloth, and spout a little thereof into the bladder. This can
also be done with the oil of Scorpions.

Item, take the seeds of Carrots, the seed of stone Parsley and of Parsley, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli three dragmes, make a powder
thereof, and give one dragme thereof at each time. Or take the seed of
Smallage, of Parsley, of Pionie, of Broomes, and of Saxifrage, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Fennel seed, Caruway and Annis seeds, of each half a
dragme, Gromell seeds, Spica, Cinnamome, peeled Melon seeds, Pompeon seeds,
Gourd seeds, and peeled Cucumber seed, of each one dragme, Licorice three
dragmes, Sugar one ounce and a half, make a powder thereof, and give of it
every day one dragme with some diureticall decoction. If so be that the sick
person have no stools, then is the matter first to be prepared with Oxymella
diuretico or with Oxymel of Squils, and afterward to purge with Medicamine
Turbith, and with Agarico, or with Benedicta Laxatiua, whereunto are added
Hermodactyli: also these ensuing clisters may be used.

Take Pellitorie of the wall, water Cresses, Saxifrage and Cammomil, of each
one handful, sees them all together in water, and take twelve or sixteen
ounces of this decoction, Benedicta Laxatiua one ounce, Cassie and Hiera piera,
of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of Rue three ounces, make a clister
thereof.

For an outward application, take two handfuls of Rue leaves, powne them a
little, and fry them with butter, or with oil of sweet Almonds, or oil of
scorpions, and lay it on the priuities.

Another. Take Dock roots as many as you please, sees them in wine, fry them,
and use them as before. Or take wheaten bran, let it sees to pap with oil of
Nuts, and use it warm. Item, take Pellitorie of the wall, water Cresses,
Saxifrage and Diptamus, of each one handful, Fennel and Annis seeds, of each
half an ounce; sees them together in white wine, and wring it out hard, put it
between two clothes and lay it on the priuities. You may also put the same
decoction into the bladder, and so apply it warm unto it.

Of the first mentioned may also a bath be made, whereunto diureticall
medicines shall be added, as Cammomill, Stechas, Marierom, Mints, the buds of
Colewort stalks, Pigeon dung, and let the sick person bathe therein as long as
he can suffer it.

Another. Take Colewort leaves, Hollihock leaves, water Cresses and garden
Cresses, Pellitory of the wall, Clauicularis, Cammomil, Smallage and Parsley
roots, of each three handfuls sees them all together unto a bath, and then
lay the decocted herbs upon the priuities.

For a salve you are to use Dogs grease and wild Cats grease, of each one
ounce, Ammoniacum half an ounce, oil of Lillies two ounces, oil of Scorpions
one ounce, make a salve of it with Wax, and use it like as the other salues.
Or take the salve which is described in the 3.. beginning thus, Take oil of
Scorpions, etc. Item, temper Balm and oil of Roses, of each a like much with
Wax. Further, of all these oils following may also salues be prepared, as of
the oil of Scorpions, of bitter Almonds, of Lillies, of the kernels of
Cherries, and of Pepper; or one may also use them as they be. For this disease
are all things meet that be ordained for the stone of the Bladder and of the
Kidneyes.

Of the hot and scalding urine.. 6.
THere happens also otherwhiles such a burning with the urine, that the
patient thinks none other than that fire passes through his yard. The cause
of this is, that there be mixed with the urine some hot choleric or salt
humors, which make this scalding in the passage.

This comes commonly of great labor, of much and long walking or traveling,
through heat of the Sun, through much venery, through long use of many hot
meats, or for that the conduits of the yard have such exulteration within.

This infirmity is indeed not to be regarded slightly, for if it continue
long, then does it excoriate the yard within. The signs thereof be sundry, to
wit, when the patient auoideth in his water sometimes matter, small skales like
bran, and otherwhiles also blood.

These kinds of sick persons are to beware of all sharp, salt, sower, and
such like meats, because that thereby the pain will be augmented. But he
shall contrariwise use all cooling and moistening things, as well boiled
Barley, Spinach, Lettice, Purslaine, Mallows, Apples, Melons, Pompeons,
Gourds, Prunes, Peaches, and Cherries, etc. Item, Lamb, Hens and Partridges
dressed with the foresaid herbs are the best meat for him. Buttermilke, and
that sodden, is also very good for him.

He is to take for his drink Barley water, Buttermilke, watered wine, and fresh
water, tempered with sirupe of Violets or sirupe of Roses, Almond milk or
Sheep milk (which is most meet for him) if there be one dragme or two of
five Bolus tempered amongst it. Item, give him sirupe of Violets with water of
Melons, or if you have it not, then beat the seeds, and make thereof a
decoction, afterward drink it with the other meats: in the morning and
evening use this powder following: Take peeled Melon seeds five dragmes,
peeled Cucumber seeds, Citron seeds and peeled Pompeon seeds, of each one
drag. and a half, Henbane seed one dragme, Sugar the weight of all the rest,
then temper them all together, take thereof every morning and evening the
weight of three dragmes with Iulep of Roses.

Another. Take peeled Melon seeds, seeds of Pompeons, of Gourds and of
Cucumbers chopped small, of each one ounce, the seeds of Purslaine, of Henbane,
and white Poppie seeds, Licorice and Currants, of each one dragme, sugar three
ounces, temper them together. Item, take Lettice seeds and the seeds of
Purslaine, of each half an ounce, powned Sugar two ounces, make a powder
thereof, and use it in all meats and drinks, it is marvelous good, yea for
all old folks also.

These Trociskes following do cool and cleanse the kidneyes and the bladder of
all such matter which does inflame or ouerheate the conduits of urine.

Take peeled Melon seeds, Pompeon seeds, Gourd seeds and peeled Cucumber
seeds, of each half an ounce, Dragagant, red Saunders, of each one dragme and
a half, Purslaine seeds, white Poppie seeds, of each three drag. white Henbane
seeds one dragme, make Trocisks thereof with the muscilage of Fleawort,
afterward take one dragme of them and break if in Barley water, and give it
early in the morning and at night going to bed. You may also make an electuary
of it. Cassie taken with Turpentine is also espcially good for this purpose.
The oil of sweet Almonds asswageth and cools also the heat of the conduits
of urine.

If in case then the patient (because of the sharpness of the matter) ought to
be purged more, then is the same to be done with sower Dates, Manna, and Rubarb
steeped in Endive water, or with the decoction of Violets: if there be salt
phlegm with it, then give him Cassie tempered with the whay of Goats milk,
wherein Polipodie roots, Annis, Violets and Burrage flowers have been decocted.
When he has thus been purged, then is the Liver vein to be opened, and the
foresaid powder to be diligently used.

If so be that a child has this disease, then take Mallow seeds, Dragagant
and Licorice, of each a like quantity, sees them in water according to the
importance of the cause, and let him drink none other drink. If his urine be
very sharp and hot, then take so much the more of the seeds. And in ease that
a child through the sharpnes of the urine had gotten some exulceratio^, then
use this salve ensuing: Take Myrrh half an, Barley meal or Bean meal, one,
temper it to a soft unguent with the oil of Roses, spread it on a cloth, and
then lay it where it is needful.

The brayed white of an egg may also be spouted into the priuities, or take
the muscilage of Fleawort and of Quince kernels, of each one dragme, temper
them with woman's milk.

Or take the seed of Fleawort three quarters of an ounce, the seed of Quinces
five dragmes, peeled Melon seeds, Pompeon seeds, Gourd seeds, and peeled
Cucumber seeds, of each one quarter of an ounce, white Poppie seeds one
dragme and a half; sees them all together in a pint of water until the third
part be wasted, then strain it through a cloth that it may be like a
muscilage, and spout thereof into the yard, it cools and asswageth the pain.

You shall use outwardly red and white Saunders, the seeds of Ruscus, burnt
Iuorie, and Myrtle seeds, of each one quarter of an ounce, the juice of
Plantaine and Rose water, of each one ounce, Barley meal as much as suffices,
then powne them all together, and make a soft pap of it: you may also put unto
it two whites of eggs. But if one desire to have it stronger, then is the
juice of Sloes and Hypocistis, of each one dragme to be tempered amongst it,
and so to be laid upon it. If so be that the yard have an exulceration within,
then is a cloth to be made wet in Rose water and laid upon it.

If any one be forced against his will to make his water.. 7.
ALthough this disease which the learned do call Diamnem, be somewhat like unto
Diabetes, and especially in this, that in both sorts of these diseases the
urine passes away against ones will and pleasure, yet is there nevertheless a
great difference between them, for that with the disease Diabetes is a great
heat of the kidneyes, her attractiue virtue is against nature, whence
follows a great thirst, and great quantity of urine, all which is not with
the disease Diamnes. For Diamnes is none other but a continual flux of the
urine against a bodies will without any pain or heat, and also without any
feeling of it. The occasions of this malady may be when the muscles of the
neck of the bladder be perished, like as otherwhiles happens in cutting of the
stone. This can also chance through falls, through blows, or through great
cold, as to fit upon a cold stone, through cold sicknesses, as the Palsy or
Litharge: item, through immoderate and excessive drinking, and through great
binding in the body. They may likewise happen unto women with child, when the
child oppresses the bladder too hard. Lastly also through some impostumes
about those parts. The signs of this disease are apparent, to wit, that all
warm things are acceptable to the patient, and cold things contrary are
hurtful. When these diseases (as often befalls) are caused through cold,
then is this electuary very good, which has efficacy for to stay this flux
of urine.

Take Cypers nuts, the rinds of Cypers, Frankincense and the rinds of the same,
Myrtle seed, Comin, Mirobalans both fried, and dry pigeon dung, of each three
dragmes, Amber, red Coral, and Roses, of each one quarter of an ounce, sirupe
of Quinces as much as is needful for to make an electuary therewith, whereof is
to be taken every morning, noone and evening, the highness of a Chestnut, with
a decoction of Cipers nuts, Sage, Myrtle seed, and such like. This electuary
is also good for the laxes called Diarrhaea and Lienteria.

Another. Take Mirobalani Chebuli, Emblici and Bellirici, of each three
dragmes, Acornes three dragmes and a half which have laid four and twenty
hours steeped in vinegar, Cypers roots, Myrtle seeds, Frankincense, dried
Glecampane roots, red Storax, red Coral, and yellow seeds of Roses, of each
two dragmes and a half, Myrrh one dragme and a half, stamp them small, and
make an electuary thereof with clarified honey.

For this is also good Treacle, Mithridate, and burnt Ox bladders, each taken
alone with wine. Item, take the dried kidneyes of a Hare, stamp them to
powder, and Dill seed, (...) each half an ounce, the seed of Smallage one
quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof and give it be tweene two and three
dragmes at once with a little cold water: boiled Hedge hogs flesh is also very
commodious for this purpose.

If so be that the patient have any need of stools, then is this clister
following very commodious for it, for when he keeps it very long, then does
it strengthen the neck of the bladder and draws it together, that it does
afterward keep the urine the better: Take Sage Rue Gl^^cularis, field Cypers,
Cammomill, Stechas, Nuts, flowers and rinds of Cypers, of each half a M. then
let them sees together, and use this Clister like as is accustomed, but mix
the oil of Bauercod and of Behen, of each two ounces amongst it, powder of
roasted Chebuli, Myrtle seeds and Cypers roots, of each one dragme and a half;
lastly temper them all together.

Outwardly may he use the Mineral and Sulphurish baths, but if one cannot get
them, then make a dry sweating bath with the foresaid herbs, which are named
in the description of the clisters, which also one may use for a bath for the
Raines, if the same be sodden in Wine or lie, and put Salt or Allume unto it.
The priuities and bladder are also to be anointed with these oiles following,
whether they be tempered together or each apart, viz. with oil of Beuercod, of
Behen and Elderne, amongst which there may be a little Pieretrum, pepper, and
the rinds of the Cypers free mixed.

His order of diet consists principally in this, to wit, that he do not
ouercharge himself neither with eating nor drinking, and use nothing which
forces urine, as Radishes, Cucumbers, Melons, parsley, fruit, and such like.
He is also to refrain from all clear, white, delicate Wine, and from Syder,
but is rather to drink a red, thick, hard, and vnwatered wine.

He must strew his meat with powned Comin which is somewhat parched: also with
a little Mustard seed, pepper, Caruway, or which he please; and he must
specially beware of all that ingendreth much moisture in the body. Roasted
Chestnuts and Hasell nuts be very good for him.

Of the excoriation of the Bladder, and of the neck of the same.. 8.
THe causes of this disease may be a precedent impostume, or some sharp humor
of the body, the use of some hot meats and drinks which are salted too
much, or some thing else which does exacuate the urine, as is before discovered.

The signs of it are detention of the urine, and although the same have some
small passage, yet happens it with anguish and great pain of the priuities,
and of other parts adjacent. In the urine are small skales to be seen, and
otherwhiles blood and corruption, the which does stink. And now for to remedy
this, then look what has been prescribed against the gravel, stone, and such
like, for all that is also meet for this purpose, and therefore not needful
to be rehearsed at this present.

But here is especially needful a good order of diet, as hereafter follows:
all salt, sower, sharp and sweet meats, also all great exercise must he
refrain: yet all mild meats, and specially Sheep milk is he to use.

He is to use for physic such things which do mundifie and cleanse the ulcers
of their corruption, viz. Trociscos Alkekengi three dragmes with sirupe or
Iulep of Violets. He is also oftentimes to drink meade, Sief album Rasis one
dragme or two tempered with milk is oftentimes to be iniected into the bath,
or honywater wherein figs be decocted.

Of the impostume of the Bladder, or of the neck of the same.. 9.
THere do come very seldom impostumations in the bladder, or in the neck of
the same; yet when they come there, then commonly be they caused through
bruises, blows and falls upon the same place, or such like. Item, through a
sweatie and bloody body, which is mixed with Cholera, repletion of the Matrix
and of the Kidneyes, whence the matter falls into the Bladder, and there
impostumateth: the stone in the bladder may also cause the same.

The signs of these impostumes are Agues which be caused of pain, also biting
and pricking pain above the priuities, swelling of the same place with heat,
which is also to be perceived by ^^^ng detention of the urine, the which the
patient cannot otherwise avoid but standing only.

Herewith comes also oppilation of the body, parbraking of Cholera, heau^
breath, cold of the outward parts, swelling of the tongue, distemperance of the
brains: they be also distempered though hot and d^ureticall things: age, hot
weather, and a licentious life do trouble and harm these patients greatly.

In these impostumes be certain common rules prescribed. First, if so be that
this impo^^^^ be in the bladder, in the neck of the bladder, or in the yard,
then is do diureticall medi^^^e to be given him. Secondly, the matter which
causes these impostumes, is to be derived to ^^ther place, except it were in
the plague, for then ought first a vein to be opened. Thirdly, when it is
known which humor is most peccant, then must one look to purge the same with
appropriated medicines: fourthly, there be not any attractiue clisters (neither
in the beginning nor augmenting of the impostume) to be used, to the end that
by the affluence of the humor the impostume be not augmented; but one is to use
only mild things, so that through the great binding in the body there ensue no
hurt; fifthly, repelling medicines are not to be too long used, that the matter
be not made too gross, and those parts which be cold by nature be more
refrigerated and cooled: sixthly, whenever through cooling things the outward
accidents be somewhat eased, then are such things to be used as may assuage the
pain: seventhly, if there but a little moisture in the patients body, then
are besides the expulsive pudicaments, also bathing and rubbing is to be used:
eighthly, if there be any impostumes in the neck of the bladder, then must one
beware to use any instrument about or in it, for that in doing so you might
hinder the matter greatly: ninthly, when the detained urine, neither of it
self, nor of any instrument may be letten out, then are other means to be
used, whereof we have written somewhat before.

Thus for to help this disease, is in the beginning the Basilica to be opened,
according to the prescription of the second rule, and let out as much blood as
shall seem meet. But if the patient find himself meetly strong, and if so be
that the matter be much, then is the Saphea to be opened the next day after. If
the impostume be through heat, as of blood or Cholera, then take oil of Roses
and unripe Sallad oil, of each one ounce, Vinegar half an ounce, temper them
all together, afterward anoint it upon the place of the pain, and then strew
upon it this powder following: Take Myrtle seed, Roses, Dragon blood, and white
Saunders, of each a like quantity, poune them al together to powder, and lay a
cloth upon it dipped in the foresaid oil of Myrtles.

The patient is also to be purged with lenitiue medicines and gentle clisters,
thereby to mollify the hardness of the impostume and to assuage the pain, and
so to open the conduits of urine.

Of all which you have had good direction before. Besides these is this
fomentation following very meet: Take Cammomill, Melilot, of each three ounces,
Hollihocke roots, Fenegreeke, Linseed, of each one ounce and a half; let them
all sees well together in water, and then bathe the place affected therewith
the space of an hour: afterward fill a bladder with this decoction about
half full, and lay it warm upon the priuities, then anoint the priuities
with oil of Cammomill, with oil of Lillies, and such like, even as in the
impostume of the kidneyes has been declared more at large.

For this is also very meet water baths, wherein Mallows, Hollihock roots,
Cammomil, Linseede, Melilot, Marierom, Cipers roots, Rape leaves, Colewort,
Fenegreeke, and such like be decocted. If it be needful to use warming oiles,
then take oil of Lillies, of S. John's wort, of Rue, of sweet and bitter
Almonds, of wall flowers: all these oiles do allay the pain, as also does the
oil of tyles, and the plaster of Barberries, which consume all cold humors.

When as this impostume is broken, then follow the same course as has been
taught in the impostumes of the kidneyes.

To conclude, these things following are much commended to be eaten for all
diseases of the bladder, viz. preserved Elecampane roots and Pimpernell
roots, which expel all uncleanness from the stomach: likewise also
preserved Calmus, Treacle, Mithridate, conserve of Betony, Meade and Honey
water. Item, the juice of Limons which is especial good for all brusings of
the bladder that were caused of the stone.

The nineteenth Chapter. Of the Matrix or Womb.
FRom the beginning of this book of Physic hitherto we have written and
discoursed of all the principal inward parts of our body, concerning as well
men as women; but concerning the Matrix, which is only proper to the female
kind, have we deferred until this present, and now we will entreat somewhat
thereof.

This matrix or womb is the chiefest part whereby the generation of mankind is
maintained, and ordained of God Almighty (Creator of nature it self) as for a
vessel, receiver and preservative place of humane seed, which is therein
formed unto a living creature, increased, defended, nourished, and sustained
until the opportune time of birth.

The Grecians do call this Matrix or Womb Metra and Hystera, the Latinists
Matrix, V^lua, Vterus, and we, by reason of her virtue, for that it incloseth
the conceived child, the Mother or Womb. This has her place in the
neathermost part of the Belly, right under the Navel. It reaches backwards to
the Arsegut, and forward to the Bladder. It is divided into two parts, whereof
the first part is her whole body, wherein (as is said) humane seed is
received, and the fruit preserved. The second part is the neck of the Matrix
or Womb, which reaches out of the foremost part of the priuities, so that it
is assimulated unto the Bladder with her neck, the ligaments, wherewith she is
bound to the hips, only excepted. When this Matrix or womb with all that
belongs thereto is rightly beholden, then is it only shapen like to a man's
member, only that the humane member depends outwardly, and that the womanhood
lies hidden within, whereof before in the beginning of the fifth Chapter, and
afterward has been spoken at length.

Her substance is inwardly fleshie and rough, especially in the bottom strewed
all over with small knops or bunches, which be full of small veins, that come
and have their accourse from all parts of the body unto the womb, and in
carnal use do draw and keep with them the humane seed, which also yield
forth the flowers or terms, nourish the conceived fruit, and maintain the
secondine. Also this Matrix has two concauities, and it is supposed that in
the concauitie on the right side Sons be conceived, and in that on the left
side the Daughters, whereof we shall speak hereafter more at large.

Outwardly she is full of sinews and hard, because that she opens and
shuts too again in the bearing of children, all which must be achieved and
brought to pass through the sinews: the same hardness does also defend her from
many kinds of brusings.

The foresaid sinews be also causes of her motion, and ascending and
descending in the body, for that because these sinews are very sensible and
easily harmed, therefore they do shrink in and draw the mother upwards with
great painfulnesse, as hereafter shall be showed more at large.

The neck of the womb which is with some women long, and with some short,
whereof the right measure is the breadth of eleven fingers, is shapen of a hard
muskelly and sinewy flesh, which so hardens from day to day (especially in
leacherous women or common harlots, and old women) that it is at the last
altered into a kind of Cartilage.

This neck of the Matrix has also where the mother begins, an entrance
which is never more opened but in the venerious act, in time of the terms, and
in the birth, otherwise does it remain always most tightly shut, and
especially after the receipt of the humane seed, so that nothing may go in or
out. In young maidens or girls it is very thin, but in growing it waxes
thicker and bigger, viz. when the terms be at hand, and lesseneth when they be
past: the thickness also increases with the being with child; and how many
times more that she bears child so much the thicker does it grow. In like sort
also will it be harder and thicker in time of the first conception, but in the
growing and increase of the child is it dilated, to the end the fruit might
have toome and scope: but in women that never conceived, or have not borne any
children at all, it continues in one bigness, and is much less than in
fruitful women. In like manner it is also in children much smaller than the
bladder, but with growing up it daily waxes greater, yea that it is at last in
greatness far exceeding the bladder.

These kinds and such like sundry motions, like as they have delight in
odoriferous things, and a loathing of stinking things, for which it flies, and
for which it ascends, caused the wise Philosopher Plato to write as hereafter
follows: This part in women, which many do call Metram and Hysteram, is a
living creature, very greedy of conception, therefore if it be drawn upwards
untimely, and if it remain a long space unfruitful, then does it become
unwilling, it creeps through the whole body, whereby the parts of
respiration are so obstructed and stopped, that the woman can get no breath, yea
it brings with it at the last great danger and peril, and causes many kinds
of sicknesses. These be the words of Plato, but this opinion is withstood by
Galen.

This noble part in women is subject to many kinds of diseases and sicknesses,
which if they ^o get the upper hand, do hinder the conception and the
fruitfulness of women; which unfruitfulness is especially caused when she has
too many of her terms, or too few, or when the same is wholly detained, whence
then follows a spoil of the natural seed, the whites, the suffocation of the
mother, which otherwhiles stifleth women, the precipitation and falling out of
the same, great pain, ulcers, impostumes, hardnings, Canker, the unnatural
disease Mola, barrenness, and if she peradventure chance to conceive an
untimely birth, whereof hereafter shall be written, yet first we will begin of
women's terms and flowers.

Of the Terms or Flowers of women in general.. 1.
THat these Terms of women be called the Flowers, is for this cause, viz. when
it is seen that a tree blows, then is it esteemed meet and convenient to
bear fruit, and contrariwise the tree unfruitful which blows not, except
the Fig tree. So is it likewise with women, that all they that have their
Terms are fit and commodious to conceive and bear children, the which they
that have not their flowers or terms, can never more accomplish. Secondly, the
Latinists do call these flowers Menstrua, of the month, and thus, for they
every month or thirty days return and come again; or for that they
according to the course of the Moon, that is, because they appear the first
quarter of the Moon in young girls, the second quarter in them that be
somewhat bigger, the third quarter in the middle sort, the last quarter in aged
women. Whereby all expert Physicians do observe in each time that each age is
to have them, to wit, the young people in the new and increasing Moon, the old
folks in the decrease of the Moon: in fine, the health of all women depends
especially in this necessary menstruall flux, yea all her chastity,
fruitfulness and welfare.

To the contrary, if they do not at all avoid, do flow too much, unorderly, or
be loathsome of color, then do they cause all miseries, inclination to venery,
and many kind of sicknesses, like as hereafter shall be taught.

Wherewith it is to be esteemed for no small work of wonder, that amongst all
creatures that do live and are of the female kind (except certain Apes) only
women are subject unto this flux, and therefore have the Philosophers many
kinds of disputations, which be here too long and needless to be rehearsed.
But of the fountain and matter of this blood, it is with one consent
concluded, that it is a cold, undigested and gross matter, and the blood of
the whole body, the which through the foresaid veins is gathered together in
ye womb, and is afterward expelled in due time as a matter hurtful and of no
use. That this matter is also cold, is by this perceived, that when it passes
away, the woman feels a great cold over the whole body, this happens after
many fashions. Of the Terms that be avoided over and above their natural
custom, shall be hereafter spoken of with all their appertenances. The women
whose Terms avoid in two or three days, are rid of them with small
trouble, but if they endure long, then will they be thereby very feeble.

The first auoidance of their Terms is commonly about the foureteenth year,
the which signifies that then their natural seed begins to ripen, that
the hair and breasts begins to grow, and they that be hot of nature do
then get desire of the man, for that the woman's Terms be none other but a
natural seed which is not yet thoroughly ripe, and that through his
superfluity of nature desires to be expelled. This course of the Terms or
Flowers abateth about the age of forty or two and forty years, or endures
sometimes until the fiftith year, but very seldom until the sixtith year,
in which time women be still meet and fit for generation; yet do these Flowers
or Terms of women come sometimes sooner and sometimes later, according to that
the nature and complexion of the body is full of blood, strong, suffers much
labor, is quiet and feeble. It is also a common rule with all them that have
experience in natural things, that a woman which gets not her flowers, like
as some which be hot and dry by nature, is barren and unfruitful, and that
for those causes that are discovered in the seventh Chapter of the barrenness
of men and women, although that it chances nevertheless (but very seldom)
that such women do conceive and bear.

This is also the natural custom, that when a woman has conceived, that then
her terms do tarry away, for this blood is prepared for a sustenance unto the
child in the mothers womb; like as also after childbirth ye same to that end is
turned into milk, notwithstanding that it oftentimes happens that women with
child avoid their Flowers or Terms after the old custom until the very day
of birth, as we shall hereafter somewhat entreat thereof: but these women do
bring small, spare, weak, and not living children into the world, because they
have been deprived of the most part of their nourishment. It is also contrary
to the opinion of many women, that she shall open a vein when she is half
gone with child, in case she be not full of blood, and the veins not great,
therefore is not the same very unadvisedly to be done. Item, in this flowing or
course of women's terms, there is another wonderful nature and property, to
wit, that so harmefull and venomous a matter in man's body, without any
hinderance, yea for a great preferment of health, may be retained and expelled.
The common experience brings with it, and all learned do testify the same,
that these women's terms do bring innumerable sicknesses with them, and have
many infectious properties: namely, where the same happens to fall, there
grows no fruit, spoileth the vines, the Must will be vinegar, the herbs
wither, the trees dry away, iron rusteth, and all metals do darken and wax
dim: the same being taken make a man mad, and chiefly the dogs: the Bees
leave their hiues if they be anointed therewith: women when they have the
same, then do they darken through their breath all bright looking glasses, the
air will be poisoned with them, and children (as it is said) bewitched. Now
do thou see thou stout high minded man, what a precious matter it is that
thou have in the beginning of thy birth, and what the matter is that has thee
nourished? This has caused the ancient Poets to assimulate this flux unto
the wars, saying, that Mars is no son of the god Jupiter, but of Juno only,
meaning by Juno this menstruall flux. And truly if this hurtful property be
likened to the wars, then is it an expert and true similitude: for what does
more spoil fruits, vineyards, Must, herbs and trees, than the wars? what
is there which takes away and wastes more iron? how many bright harnesses be
thereby darkened? where bears madness more mastery? where are men more like to
mad dogs than in the wars? how can the air be more venimed than through the
stinking dead bodies? Here is now sufficiently spoken of this matter, now we
will proceed with our medicines.

How to prefer and move the Terms or Flowers in women.. 2.
FOr the first, we will speak of the causes whereby the terms be detained,
the which be outward and inward. The outward causes be sore labor, hunger,
care, great satnesse, agues, dropsies, consumptions, and some disease of the
womb. The inward causes be a bad complexion, of heat, cold, dryth, or of
moisture, whereby the virtue expulsive is weakened, so that it is not strong
enough for to unburden her self of the superfluities. Or that there be any
malady in the Matrix or mother, to wit, if the neck of the womb be stopped and
obstructed, and is swollen too, like as it may easily happen in the mother or in
the veins of the same.

Now for to have some certain or infallible knowledge of these things, there
may outward causes be easily perceived by the declaration of the patient her
self. If it come through weakness of the expulsive power, then is it
perceived by the heat, by the thirst, by the swift and strong pulse, and other
signs of heat. But if such be caused through cold, then is the woman bleake,
sleepie, without any thirst, the arteries of the pulse beat slowly, and the
urine is of loathsome color. If the disease be of any inward part, then does
the whole body declare the same through the great fatness or leanness. If
such be caused through any of the four humors, that does the blood
sufficiently show, which therein bears sway. This obstruction does bring to
women no small sickness, besides that (as it is said) they be barren, for that
they fall thereby otherwhiles into Maniam, (which is madness) into the falling
sickness, suffocation, swellings, and impostumes of the womb, and of the
other parts adjacent unto it, slothfulness and heaviness of the whole body,
great vnlustinesse, wambling and parbraking, coughing, and a heavy breathing,
the dropsy and detension of the urine, and of going to the stool, heaviness of
the mind, great pain of the head, and at last into the gout.

And to remedy all these diseases, therefore will we first of all prescribe
certain common rules, whereof the first is, in case that the Terms be
obstructed in a dry body, then must one beware of all those things that might
cause either heat or dryth, to the end the disease be not increased thereby.
The second is, if in the stay or detension of women's flowers the blood had
course toward any other part of the body, then is it advised that the same
blood be drawn out, which otherwise might be spoiled. Thirdly, to prefer
these flowers, it is then needful that the veins be opened under the Matrix,
that the blood may be drawn downwards. Fourthly, there is meet for this the
strong binding of the thighs, and to hold the same a certain time bounden.
Fifthly, if the disease come for that the veins be stopped in the Matrix, (be it
of whatsoever occasion that it will) then is the blood to be diminished by
opening of a vein, and to be diminished through laxatiue medicines, through
abstinence, through exercise, and such like means. Sixthly, all strong things,
as Hellebore, Euphorbium and Nardus seed (which is wont sometimes to be
adhibited from below) must be but a very little, and not to be holden long
therein, to the end that thereby the Ague nor any other anguish be caused.
Seventhly, all that moves the urine does also move the Terms. Eighthly, where
there is observed no good order of diet in eating or drinking, there can also
no good advice nor remedy do any good at all. Ninthly, for to prefer the
Terms, is first of all the same to be approved through gentle remedies, and
at the last through stronger means. Tenthly, all warm and well savoring
things are very meet for this if they be laid upon the navel, upon the
priuities, and upon the parts about it. Eleuenthly, if this disease be caused
through any ulcer, impostume, Ague, or any other cause, it is first to be
practiced how to remedy, and afterward to move the flowers. Twelftly, in case
it be perceived that this detention of the flowers or terms does cause any
other sickness, or increases it, then is all diligence to be had to provoke the
Terms: and if fo be that the same cannot be effected, then may the vein be
opened in the foot, and boxing cups be adhibited. Thirteenthly, because
there is a great space from the stomach and the liver unto the Matrix, then is
the Physic so to be tempered, that the same in so great a distance be not
infeebled. Fourteenthly, all that is to be put up into the womb is to be tied
to a strong thread, that one when he list may draw it out, and to the end also
that through the long continuance there, it bruise not the neck of the mother,
or cause not an Ague.

And to the end that we may come to the remedies for to open this obstruction,
therefore first of all be the causes of these obstructions to be thought upon,
in case that the same be caused of some outward accident, like as of too great
labor, great heat, of too much fasting, and such like, then is the same
presently to be prevented. In hot causes are cooling things to be used: in
cold warming things, which do open the obstructions. In a body that is full of
blood are the veins under the knees to be opened, which be most necessary to
people that have not the terms: and if so be that horeby, and other more
lettings of blood is nothing profited, then is one to come to the inward and
outward remedies, wherein be three manner of ways to be followed, which shall
be here described, of which each one may choose what seems to be the best and
fittest for it.

And because that it is not bad counsel to rehearse and show the simples which
may stir up the terms, therefore we will here discover a good part of them,
and first all that be warm by nature, and are weakest, are these, the roots
of Smallage, of Fennel, of Butchers broom, of Sperage, of Parsley, of Grass,
Madder, Calmus, Asarabacca, Ireos, Valerian, white Diptamus and Elecampane
roots. Item, the seed of Ruscus, Lupins, seeds of both kinds of Parsley, of
Silver mountain, of Sperage, of Smallage, of Annis, of Fennel, of Comin,
whether it be raw or confected: the herbs are these, Cinquefoile, Mugwort,
wild Mints, Marierom, Feuerfew, Hearts tongue, Spikenard, Wormwood, white water
Mints, Juniper, wild Thyme, Louage, Cuscuta, Maidenhaire, Southernewood, and
washed Turpentine.

These ensuing be much stronger, as Hemlocke, Rue, Centorie, Laureola, Sauin,
Euphorbium, Ammoniacum, Sagapenum, Mirrha, Opopanacum, and Assafoetida, the
seed of Nardus, Mustard seed, Pepper, Beuercod, Colloquint, black Hellebore,
Pieretrum, Calmus, roots of Celandine, the juice of wild Cucumbers, Licebane
seeds, Boras, the galls of steeres, of hens, and of all other beasts.

The odoriferous things which prefer women's terms, be these, Indie Spica,
Cinnamom, Cassie wood, Costus roots, Ameos, Muscus, Spica Romana, Squinant,
Gallia Muscata, and such like. They that may be burnt to receive the vapor
thereof be these, viz. Opopanacum, Saponaria, Frankincense, Blatta Byzantia,
Lignum Aloes, and red Storax.

These be now the cooling things which prefer the terms, to wit, the seeds
of small Endive. the seed of Melons, of Gourds, of Pompeons, of Cucumbers, of
Endive, of Lettice, etc. and other more which shall be discovered hereafter; of
all which pessaries may be made to use in the womb; also plasters, salues,
powders, oiles, potions and baths, all as the cause requires, and that
necessity compels, like as there be many sundry described hereafter, and
now we will proceed.

The first means for to provoke the Terms is to be described somewhat at
length, wherein there be many sundry medicines of diverse and sundry Physicians
ordained and added together, out of which each may choose what is meet for
him; but in the other twain we will be somewhat briefer, therefore one may
take out of them all that might be wanting in this, and so first begin with
those things which be meet for this to bring the body unto health, and to
show therwithal how such obstructions and hindrances of the terms may be
taken away, for which this sirupe following is to be prepared: Take Mather two
ounces, Louage roots, the roots of Sperage, Cipers roots and Grass roots,
of each one ounce and a half, Silver mountain two ounces, Baulme two ounces,
Balsam wood and the fruits of the same, of each one ounce, Spica of Indie
half a dragme, Licorice, Currants, Rosemary flowers, and Stechados, of each one
ounce, Honey six ounces, white Sugar nine ounces, boil a sirupe of it,
clarify it, and give thereof two ounces tempered with the decoction of Ceeres.

Another. Take Mather two ounces, Sperage roots, the roots of Butchers
broom, and Cypers roots, of each one ounce, Corn mints, Valerian, Sauine,
white Water mints, and Penniroyall, of each one handful, Baulme two handfuls,
Silver mountain two ounces, Balsam wood and the fruits of the same, peeled
Melon seed, of each one ounce, Spikenard half an ounce, Licorice, Currants, of
each half an ounce, Honey and Sugar, of each six ounces, make a sirupe of it,
and give thereof at each time one ounce and a half, or two ounces, with the
broth of Ceeres.

Another. Take the water of Smallage, water of Lupins, of Sperage, and of
Fennel, of each six ounces, Indie Spica one quarter of an ounce, Cinnamome
one dragme, Ammoniacum and Opopanacum, of each one dragme and a half, Parsley
seed, Fennel seeds, Ameos, wild yellow Rape seed and Caruway, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Gromell seed, stone Parsley seed and Agrimonie of each one
handful, Galingall, Cinnamome and Saffron, of each half a dragme, sirupe of
Violets two ounces, Quince kernels, Mallows seed, of each half an ounce:
sees them al together in two quarts of Gourds water until the third part be
wasted, strain it thorough, and then temper it with a little of the foresaid
water and the sirupe of Violets amongst it, and boil it with so much honey as
you please. Last of all strew some Cinnamome in it, and as much vinegar of
Squils, until it be somewhat sourish, then use it as the former: this forces
very vehemently the Terms.

For this is also very good the common sirupes which be always prepared at all
substantial Apothecaries, as the sirupe of Mugwort, of Maidenhaire, of
Cicorie, with Rubarbe, and the sirupe of five roots.

When as now this sirupe has been used like as behooves, then must be
proceeded: and for to proceed orderly, it is very needful that women be purged
of all superfluous humors, which may be done very commodiously with the
confection Benedicta or Hiera picra, tempered with the decoction of Madder: and
of the foresaid confections you may use three quarters of an ounce, or an
ounce, each a part or together. Afterward are these laxatiue things to be
used: Take Seen leaves, Penniroyall and Madder, of each a like quantity; sees
them in small white wine, and give thereof about three ounces at once.

Or take Penniroyall, Nep, Southernwood, Rue, Centorie and Hyssop, of each one
handful, Sauin, Feuerfew, of each one handful and a half, Opopanacum,
Ammoniacum, Galingall, of each one dragme, Cinnamome, Madder, of each one
handful, Myrrh one quarter of an ounce; sees them all together with a quart
of water until the third part be wasted, then take thereof two or three ounces
fasting at one time.

Item, take the roots of Smallage, of Sperage, of Fennel, of Parsley, of
Carduus Benedictus, and of Butchers broom, of each one ounce and a half,
Annis, Fennel, Caruway and Ameos, of each one dragme and a half, Mugwort,
Penniroyall, mints, Horehound, Feuerfew and Asarabacca, of each half a
handful; sees them all together in two quarts of water unto the half, wring
it together through a cloth, and mix therewith the sirupe of the five roots,
de Calamintha, de Artemisia, of each a like quantity, drink thereof in the
morning and at afternoon.

Another. Take mints, Balm, Penniroyall, Marierom, and Southernwood, of each
one handful, Annis, Fennel, Caruway, of each one ounce, the roots of
Polipodie one ounce and a half, Cicorie roots one ounce; cut the roots of
the herbs very small, and sees them in a quart of water until the third part
be consumed, afterward strain it through, and make it as sweet as you please.

Another potion with Wine: Take Sauine and Mugwort, of each one handful, put
two quarts of wine unto it, and let them sees together until the third part
be wasted: take thereof in the evening and morning at each time two spoonfuls.
Do you now desire to make a common potion? then take Wormwood and Rue, of each
one handful, five or six pepper corns, sees them all together in a quart of
Wine, strain it then through, and drink thereof. In like manner may you sees
Mallows in wine and drink thereof, it is also very good.

This potion following is very good and pleasant: Take a pint of good Wine,
Sage half a handful, Cloves, Saffron and Mace, of each half a scruple, stamp
them all together, and bind it in a fine cloth, and hang it a night and a day
in wine, wring it out oftentimes, divide it into three parts, and take one
draught of it five hours before meat, the other draught after noone, and the
last after supper. But this is to be done in the wane of the Moon, and eat
very little.

Item, take Hartwort and Pepper, of each one dragme, pour a pint of wine upon
it, and drink thereof in the evening and morning, it moves much, and cleanses
the womb or Matrix from all bad humors.

Or take the herb Caruway one handful, Mugwort one handful and a half,
Arsmart one handful, Asarabacca one dragme; sees them together in two quarts
of water until about the half, and drink thereof in the morning fasting a
good draught.

Another. Take Penniroyall one handful, Marierom gentle as much also, Mace one
dragme, and one quarter of an ounce of Bayberries beaten grossly, bind them
all together in a cloth, and pour thereon twelve ounces of wine; but let them
sees together in a Can in hot water the space of an hour, afterward wring
out the cloth, and drink the half of this Wine in the morning, and the other
half in the evening after the mealetide.

Item, take Mugwort, Feuerfew, Penniroyal, Baulme and Mallows, of each one
handful, sees them together in a pint and a half of wine, and use them as
before.

Take the roots of Cicorie four handfuls, take out the wooddie heart, and cut
them small, then pour two quarts of wine upon it, and let it sees so long
until the force be gone out of it, afterward wring it out, and then sees it
unto a thin sirupe, and so take every morning a spoonefull or twain of it.

This following does open much all obstructions, and forces the Terms: Take
of the confection Triphera without Opium, Mather and Silver mountain, of each
half an ounce, Fenegreeke, Turkish beans and Ceeres, of each one quarter of
an ounce, sees them all together in eight ounces of water even to the half,
then strain it through, and temper in three ounces of this decoction the
Triphera aforesaid. The Physicians therefore do occupy this Triphera without
Opium, because it is forcible and strong. Also they temper therewith
otherwhiles one drag. of the juice of Sauin, sometimes also Mirrha, red Storax,
Bdellium, Euphorbium or Opopanacum, all according to the importance of the
cause. Item, take Cassie wood three dragmes beaten very small, and give it with
wine.

One that is more feeble: Take Myrrh, Beuercod and red Storax, of each three
dragmes, Sauine, fine and course Cinnamome, of each one dragme and a half,
make an electuary thereof with Honey, then take one quarter of an ounce thereof,
and temper it in Wine for a potion. Item, take Saffron one dragme or more, and
drink it with Wine or with Mallows water. Saffron only prefers the
Flowers; the same does also one dragme of powned Cardamome.

Here now do follow certain powders which are to be taken in the potions, and
amongst all things is nothing more to be commended then the Trociskes de
Myrrha, which are thus prepared.

Take Myrrh one dragme and a half, Lupins two dragmes and a half, Rue, white
water Mints, Candie Diptamus, Comin, Madder, Elecampane roots, Sagapenum,
Opopanacum, of each one dragme, then make Trociskes thereof with the juice of
Mugwort, and give half an ounce thereof with water wherein Juniper berries be
decocted. Take Beuercod one dragme, powder of Mints half a scruple, drink it
with wine, it is also very good for this use. Item, half a scruple of the
blossoms of the Nut tree taken with wine does the same. S. John's wort does
also move much the terms.

Also these wines ensuing are very good for it, viz. wine of Elecampane roots,
of Marierom gentle, of the herb Bennet, of Betony, of Gilloflowers, and of
Rosemary. Item, take one handful of Juniper berries, Madder, Cinnamome and
Myrrh, of each half an ounce; sees them al together in Mugwort water until
the third part be euaporated, strain it, and put one dragme of Boreas unto it,
give thereof a good warm draught twice or thrice a day.

The same does also the Trocisci Galliae Muscatae Rasis, four scruples taken
with warm white wine, it helps immediately.

It is here also to be noted, if so be that the patient might drink no wine,
then take the leaves of blew Flowerdeluce, stamp them and sees them in capon
broth, and let her drink it: this is also found many times good, and it
expels also dead children.

Item, take the scull of a Capon before he is boiled or roasted, stamp it, and
drink it with Penniroyall water: this may suffice for the potions.

Take Penniroyall, Italian Comin, Mints, Ireos, Hartwort, Mather and Myrrh, of
each one quarter of an ounce, make an electuary thereof with clarified Honey,
take two dragmes of it, and drink a draught of Beer or Wine after it, wherein
Sauine, Penniroyall, Mugwort, Fennel, roots of Sperage, of Smallage and of
Parsley have been decocted.

Item, take of the electuary Antidotum Haemagogum half an ounce, and give it
fasting. If you had rather drink it, then temper four ounces of Mugwort water
amongst it, and use it against the time that the Flowers do come. Treacle and
Mithridate do also force the Flowers very gently.

Amongst the confections there be good for this the confected Elecampane
roots, the confected Eryngus, conserues of Pionie, and Myrrh roasted in an
apple. The Italian women do highly commend the electuary Diacyminum, if one do
take every morning one quarter of an ounce of it, then will the terms come
within the space of a month as they affirm: it does make fruitful, and
strengthens the stomach. The confected Calmus is especial good, if the
obstruction do come through celd. Fennel seed confected forces also the
flowers: likewise also Comin and Caruway: Cinnamom and Saffron are also to be
used in all things.

These pills ensuing are also to be prepared: Take the pills Alephanginae half
a dragme, Aloe two scruples, beaten Sauin one scruple, make fourteen pills of
it with the water of Mugwort, and take the one half thereof at once: they do
move the terms and the stools, and are also very safe.

Others. Take Muscus and Myrrh, of each four scruples, Stechas, Mather,
Penniroyall, Citron pills, long pepper, Cassie wood, Cassie pills, Pionie seeds
and Calmus, of each three quarters of an ounce, Indie Spica half a dragme:
make pills thereof with the juice of Mugwort, whereof take 1.. at once. The
ancient Physicians do command pessaries to be used, as Euphorbium wrapped in
wool. Item, take Hellebore and the juice of Wormwood, of each one quarter of
an ounce, Ammoniacum one dragme, temper it with Ox gall. But here ensue
sundry which are safer: Take Beuercod and Myrrh, of each a like quantity,
Muscus a little, then form it with the oil of Behen as an Acorne, and tie it
to a thread, and put it into the Matrix before.

Or take fresh Rue, Wormwood and Coloquint, of each a like quantity, form a
pessarie thereof of Ox gall. Item, take white Watermints, Swines bread, Agnus
Castus, Rue, Sauine, Mugwort, Penniroyall, Marierom, Radishes, Southernewood,
Nettle seed, Juniper leaves, Mather, white Hellebore, Centorie, Myrrh,
Beuercod, Elecampane roots, Sagapenum, Opopanacum, of each one dragme, Gallia
Muscata one scruple, stamp all that is to be stamped, and then make a pessarie
of it with the juice of wild Cucumbers and Ox gall, and use them as before.

Another. Take Gentian and Penniroyall, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Nigella seeds one dragme, temper them together with powned figs, and with a
little of the juice of Mercury: these do make no heat like as the other.

Item, take Gentian two scruples, Coloquint and Nigella seed, of each one
dragme, temper them together with the juice of wild Cucumbers. Or if you will
have it stronger, then put some white Hellebore unto it: there be also sundry
other made which be stronger and milder, according to the importance of the
cause of the foresaid cold and warm things, each according to his god pleasure
and content. Amongst all these things, and all that may be iniected into the
body and neck of the matrix or womb, this general rule is to be observed,
that the same may be used as well before as after bathing.

Outwardly may one bathe and foment with all that which here ensues: Take
Asarabacca half a handful, Ebulus leaves one handful and a half, Feuerfew,
Mints, Mugwort, Agrimony, Marierom and Betonie, of each one handful,
Cammomill, Melilot and Roses, of each half a handful; cut all the herbs and
sees them, like as has been taught oftentimes. It is also very commodious and
good to sit in warm water wherein Mallows have been decocted. Or take Mugwort
and Sauine, of each three handfuls, Mallows, Hollihocke roots and Bearefoote,
of each one handful, Fennel seeds, Parsley seeds, Annis, Dill seeds, Orage
seeds, wild yellow Rape seeds, and Asarabacca, of each half a dragme,
Cammomill, Elderne flowers, Rosemary, and Stechas, of each one dragme: make a
little bag thereof, and sees it in water, and then sit upon it.

Another. Take Mugwort, Sauine tree, of each three handfuls, sweet Costus
roots, Mallows, Hollihocke roots and Bearefoote, of each two handfuls, the
seed of Mallows, of Hollihockes, of Southernwood, of Linseed, of Fenegreeke,
of Cuscuta, mustard seed, of Lauender and of Siluermountaine, of each one
ounce and a half, Parsley seed, Fennel, Dill seed, wile yellow Rape seed,
and Asarabacca, of each half an ounce, Cammomill, Elderne flowers, Stechas,
Rosemary flowers, of each one ounce; sees them as before, and then sit upon
the bag. For fomentation, you are to use that which follows hereafter: Take
Cammomil, Mugwort, Sauine and Nettle roots, of each one handful, sees them
together in water, and receive the vapor from beneath. Item, take Rue, Sage,
Southernwood and Sauine, of each one handful, put them together into a new pot,
and close it tight, but leave a hole open above on the cover, wherein a tap may
be put whilst it boyleth; afterward draw out the tap, and receive the warm
vapor from beneath, as is said before. Or take Myrrh as much as you will,
temper it with the juice of Mugwort, and let it dry; afterward put filed Hearts
horn unto it, to wit, the third part as much as there is Myrrh, then strew
this powder upon a hot tile, and receive the smoke beneath, but round about
cover you close. You may also take for it Penniroyal, Rue, Sauine leaves, and
use them alone. Item, take Violet leaves two handfuls, Myrrh half an ounce,
let them sees together in rain water, and foment therewith as warm as you
can abide it. Take Penniroyal, Nep, Southernwood, Rue, Centory and Hyssope, of
each one handful, Sauine, Feuerfew, of each one handful and a half,
Cinnamom, Galingall, of each one dragme, Siluermountaine and Mather, of each
half a handful, Myrrh one quarter of an ounce, beat them all gross
together, and sees the same in a quart of water even to the half, and then
use it as before: this also provoke urine. Or take Penniroyall, Marierom,
Sage and Mugwort, of each one handful, sees them all together for a
fomentation: for to fume, you are to take a little Coloquint, cast it upon a
hot stone, and receive the fume from beneath; it greatly provoke women's
terms: but note, that Coloquint is very sharp, and that the said well
sauouring spices and other things be much safer for to fumigate withal. Or
take Dill, Cammomill, Melilot, Squinant, Cassie wood, Costus roots, Sulphur,
Rue, Marierom, Stechas, Southernwood, any of all these, or part of the same. To
set boxing cups upon the thighs is also very behouefull and auailable.

Plasters and Unguents.
TAke the muscilage of Fleawort and of Linseede, of each one ounce, unsalted
butter two ounces, Hens grease, Duckes grease, Goose grease, and the marrow of
Calves bones, of each half an ounce, Ammoniacum one quarter of an ounce, oil
of Sesamum and oil of sweet Almonds, of each five dragmes, Wax as much as is
needful for a salve; then anoint you therewith behind and before, from the
navel downwards, but not before that you have used all other means of
bathing, letting of blood, potions, etc. Item, take of the confection Benedicta
half an ounce, Turbith one quarter of an ounce, Nigella seed three dragmes,
decocted Honey as much as suffices for to make a plaster. This is to be laid
over the priuities as before.

If so be that one perceives the terms after the use of this foresaid means,
some do advise, and that very well, that this potion ensuing is to be made:
Take Mugwort, Seen leaves, and Penniroyall, of each half a handful, Cinnamom
half an ounce, Mace three dragmes; sees it al together in three pints of good
wine until about the fourth part be wasted, and this in a Can stopped tight in
seething water: this expels the terms unto her due time.

The other orderly mean for to prefer the terms, is, that first of all the
Saphea or Median shall be opened, and that afterward a long bag is to be made,
and to be filled with any of the foresaid herbs, which you like best, and then
put unto it one quarter of an ounce of Gallia Muscata, and wear it so upon the
priuities. Afterward make of one quarter of an ounce of the foresaid Gallia
with the water of Mugwort nine pills, and take three thereof at once in the
morning early, then make a pessary of the length of a finger, and fill the same
with pouned Mercury, and put it into the place. Set boxing cups also upon the
thighs, and in the hams, and then rub the legs downwards with warm clothes.

Squinant and Madder decocted also in the water of Maidenhaire and drunken, are
also highly commended.

Item, take the pipes of Cassie when the Cassie is taken out, and let them be
well scraped on the outside, as many as you will, Cinnamom, Mace, Saffron,
Diptamus and Baulme, of the one as much as of the other; make a powder thereof,
and take a dragme thereof every morning with water of Mints: the same moves
them very gently.

But as much as concerns letting of blood (whereof mention is made before)
some do advise, and not without reason, if in case that a woman has not had
her Terms a long time, that her vein is to be opened besides her little toe,
and the next day afterward on the other foot.

The words of Hippocrates and of his expounder Galen be true, that the letting
of blood and hunger do cause women with child to miscary, for that thereby
(they say) will the nourishment of the child be withdrawn.

Therefore good heed is to be taken in these things, for that many women have
this for a custom, whether they be fat, gross, strong, or lean, that they
always open a vein at the half of their going with child, like as we also
have before admonished in the first.

But if one will needs be let blood, then must after the same (or else without
letting of blood) bathings be oftentimes used, for which is Penniroyall to be
taken, field mints, Southernwood, Centorie and Hyssope, of each one handful,
Sauine and Feuerfew, of each one dragme, Siluer-mountaine, Madder, of each one
handful, Myrrh one quarter of an ounce; stamp and choppe them all small, and
let them sees in sufficient water: then make thereof a bath for the raines of
the back, or a fomenting for the bottom of the belly. The boxing cups,
whereof we have also spoken before, draw the blood downwards: Like as does
also the strong binding of the legs.

The third mean is as hereafter follows: three hours after the rising of
the Sun shall the Saphea of them be opened on the right foot which have not
the flowers, and about five ounces of blood drawn. The next day after is this
purgation following to be given; Take Agaricus, Turbith and Rubarbe, of each
one dragme, Indy Spica, Ginger and Mace, of each six grains, Salgemmae one
grain, Agrimonie, Mugwort, of each one ounce and a half; let them be steeped
four hours: afterward wring it through a cloth, and temper amongst it three
dragmes of Benedicta Laxatiua, and then drink it betimes in the morning. The
third day afterward you are to begin to use this potion: Take Fennel roots,
Parsley roots, Sperage roots, the roots of Butchers broom, and of Smallage,
of each half an ounce: these being all cut small together, then sees them in a
quart of well water unto the half; afterward sweeten the decoction with
Sugar, and then drink thereof five ounces, and so continue this the space of
eight or ten days. In the mean time is the body to be kept open with gentle
clisters, or else they are every evening after supper to swallow a pill of
Alephanginae or of Aloes. Afterward it is very good, that three times in four
and twenty hours all the back bone be anointed with this salve ensuing:
Take the oil of wallflowers two ounces, oil of Saffron one ounce, the grease
of Badgers and of Hens, of each half an ounce, Saffron, Indie Spica, Lignum
Aloes, and Mugwort, of each half a scruple, Wax as much as is needful for a
salve. After the foresaid potions, are these pills following to be used: Take
Pillulae foetidae two scruples, de Hiera composita one scruple, make seven pills
of it with the confection Benedicta.

And if so be that through all this advice the terms do not appear, then are
the tops of the thighs, hard by the priuities, to be bounden hard: but if that
will not help, set immediately hot cups behind on the calves of the legs,
setting them up and off. Lastly, then make this bath following: Take
Penniroyall, white water mints, Marierom and Smallage, of each three handfuls,
Sauine six handfuls, Opopanacum, Myrrh, of each half an ounce, Hartwort,
Rue, of each three handfuls; sees them all together in sufficient water until
about the half, but leave the herbs in it, and then make a bath of it for the
raines even to the navel, and sit therein the space of half an hour, or as
long as you can. When you have rested somewhat, then put some cotton (being
dipped in the juice of Mercury) up into the place, and without doubt it will
provoke the terms. Every such woman is also to beware of all slimie meats,
which is from all hard meat, like as all that is made of Dough, of Pease, of
Beans, of Cheese, of Milk, and all that is dressed with them, from all salt,
cold and binding things, and from thick raw red Wine: but Cinnamom, Saffron,
Ginger, and Smallage seeds and roots, Annis, Fennel, Parsley seed, or any of
all these is she to use always with her meat.

But if so be that this retention of the terms be caused thereof, for that a
woman had but little blood, did great labor, were weak, lean, not long
recovered from a long lingering sickness, or had lived a long time in hatred,
malice, great sorrow, and such like; then is such to have those meats which
nourish much, and she shall omit all hatred, sorrow, and such like. She is to
bathe oftentimes in water, to sleep much, to take rest, and to be merry. She
must also refrain from letting of blood, except it be a very little. But she
is to use Pistacies, Pingles, Almonds, and other nutritive things as is before
said. And although it appeared that her terms must be always quickened
through Physic, yet it must be begun with the mildest means, like as has
been counseled before.

How that the excessive course of the Flowers is to be stopped.. 3.
WHen this course of women's terms gets the mastery, then be there very
heavy sicknesses to be feared, to wit, the dropsy, the consumption, Hectica,
the pain of the back, the pain of the stomach, feebleness of natural
digestion, lack of appetite, and such like diseases more. This issue is
commonly caused of outward or inward occasions: the outward may be falls,
blows, thrusts, great running, leaping, dancing, walking in great heat, and
such like, all which makes the blood subtle and fluxible. Item, if there
break a vein open in the matrix or womb, through unnatural and untimely
birth, through any ulcers, or through any other brusings in the neck of the
womb, through long use of many hot spices, or of any subtle meat and drink.

The inward causes may be the strength of the expulsive, or the debilitie of
the retentiue virtue.

This may also be caused of some disease of the Matrix, and through the
moisture of the same. But concerning the part it self, the same may be too
feeble, too slippery, too wide, and too much open: yet in case the moisture of
this part be caused of it, then is the flux of blood so great, that the Matrix
and the parts adjacent cannot contain the humors, or these humors be so
sharp, so subtle, so hot, so venomous, so salt, so biting, so cold, or so
waterish, that the same cannot be retained. The outward causes may be enquired
of the patient her self.

But if this disease be caused of the debilitie of the retentiue virtue, then
is the woman bleake or pale of color, and weak. The signs of the same part
be when as it waxes lean, and consumes: each humor may be adjudged out of
the property of the body, like as we have taught the same elsewhere, as heat,
of the fullness of the veins, thirst, itch, ill-favored or loathsome color of
the face and of the whole body.

If then such proceed out of blood, then does the color of her terms alter,
and will be whitish; or if the same proceed of Cholera, then are the flowers
somewhat yellowish, and if of Melancholia, then darkish, blew or black. By the
foresaid colors one may easily come unto the full knowledge what humors might
be the only cause of this excessive moisture, whereby may be known how to
choose of these remedies following, wherewith the excessive course of the terms
may be stayed.

But first of all there be for this purpose certain rules to be noted. First,
you must never bathe for this excessive course of the terms, neither yet use
any kind of things which brings heat with it. Secondly, when this kind of
issue comes by reason of the fullness of the body, as it were an
vnburthening and cleansing of the same, then is it by no means to be stayed,
if thereby be not feared a great debilitie. Thirdly, if so be that women be
full of blood, and this flux come too abundantly, then is the Basilica vein
to be opened, thereby to withdraw the blood. Fourthly, in case that it be
perceived that red Cholera, or any other mixed moistured were cause of this
flux, then is the same moisture or humor to be purged with appropriate
medicines, yet mingling always amongst it some binding and comforting things.
Fifthly, iniection is also very needful for this disease, or some such like
instruments to be used, whereby the medicine might be brought into the womb.
Sixthly, if any astringent things may be brought into it through any
instruments, then may they help much better and a great deal sooner than those
things that be given by the mouth. Seventhly, because that with this menstrual
flux, not only the virtue digestive, but also the whole body is weakened,
therefore are they to be sustained with light meat, as with yolks of eggs,
with young flesh, and broth of the same, and such like. Sometimes also with
water wherein the seed of Butchers broom is decocted or tempered with water of
Sorrel. Eighthly, it is also good to set great boxing cups under the breasts
vnpickt. Ninthly, this flux of the terms is not to be stopped so long as one
sees that the woman has her lively color, and does remain strong and
healthie: but as soon as one perceives that her strength fades away, then be
all means to be sought for to stop it. Tenthly, if one desire to purge any of
the four humors, and to separate it from the clean blood, then may that best
be effected by vomits, for that thereby the matter is derived to another place,
and stay their course that they fall not downwards. Eleuenthly, these women
are to abstain from all heavy labor, and from all that makes the blood
fluxible and thin.

By all these forementioned propositions may be clearly seen and marked, that
if any desire to cure or remedy this disease, that these women must lead an
easy life, and keep themselves quiet. They must also live in such a place
where it is not too hot nor too cold. They must also eschew all thin and
waterish meats, viz. from fruit, except all that which binds: in like
manner also from all meat which cause any kind of heat. But all kinds of
roasted fowls, and all that makes gross blood, as Rice, Wheat and Lentils be
good for them. They must also beware of ouercharging them with meat or drink,
whereof the causes be declared in the seventh rule, and afterward to put in
practice these remedies following, according to the importance of the cause.

Thus for to speak first of the things which inwardly are to be used, has
been spoken of before, and also what order of diet, or government of life is
to be observed. But in case that any do desire any ampler declaration of it,
then let him look the seventeenth Chapter and 17.. where is spoken of the red
or bloody flixe, which also is most meet for this use. But for this
menstruall flux, may this Confection following be used: Take the Species
Triasantali and Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each one dragme, prepared fine Bolus two
scruples, Bloodstone washed in Plantaine water, and make tabulats thereof. Or
use this powder following: Take Species Triasantali one dragme and a half,
Diarrhodon Abbatis one dragme, De Gemmis Frigidis one dragme and a half,
prepared Coriander two scruples and a half, washed Bloodstone one dragme,
prepared Bolus half a dragme, Shepherds purse two scruples, Roses, Coral, of
each half a dragme, Cinnamome one quarter of an ounce, Sugar as much as you
please, then make a powder of it.

Item, take prepared Bolus one dragme, sealed earth two scruples, Tormentil
half a dragme, Bursa Pastoris one scruple, Species de gemmis frigidis one
dragme and a half, prepared Pearls one dragme, Rubins, Pomegranates,
Smaragdes, Iacints, Saphirs, of each half a scruple, Roses, red Coral,
Saunders, of each one scruple, Sugar three ounces; make a powder thereof, and
use it in broth, or strewed in meat. The confection of the refuse of iron is
also very profitable to be used for this disease, especially if so be that the
lesser remedies will not help.

Another. Take conserve of Roses two ounces, Bloodstone, Trociscos de Carabe,
de terra sigillata, and de Spodio, of each one dragme, make a powder thereof,
and temper them well together; afterward take every time thereof about one
dragme. Take conserve of Roses six ounces, conserve of Burrage, of Buglosse
and of Baulme, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one dragme, prepared Pearls
one quarter of an ounce, of the five precious stones above mentioned, of each
one scruple, Cinnamome one dragme, make an electuary thereof.

Another. Take of the driest conserve of Roses three ounces, Marmalade two
ounces and a half, red Coral one dragme, Bistorta, Trociscos de Carabe, and
prepared Bolus, of each half a drag. prepared Bloodstone two dragmes, make an
Electuarie thereof with the sirupes of Mirtles. Item, take conserve of Roses
three ounces, Marmalade two ounces and a half, conserues of Burrage and of
Buglosse, of each one ounce, prepared Bolus one dragme and a half, prepared
Pearls two dragmes and a half, Bistorta one dragme, Tormentill two scruples,
red Saunders one dragme, then temper them all together with the sirupe of
Mirtles unto a confection. The black confected Cherries are very good for this
use: in like manner also the preserved Barberries.

Item, hold a root of Galingall long in your mouth, and chew the same small.
It is is also a common advice which is not to be despised, that tosted bread
should be steeped with red Wine, and powned Nutmegs strewed upon it and so
eaten. Item, take fine Bolus which is well washed, Masticke, yellow Amber,
prepared Coriander, and Dates, of each a like quantity, then take thereof at
each time half a dragme with a rere egg. This powder ensuing is also
marvelous good: Take prepared Bloodstone three dragmes, red Coral one dragme
and a half, Tormentill and Trociscos de Spodio, of each one dragme, shaven
Iuorie, burnt Hearts horn, of each two scruples, prepared Pearls one quarter
of an ounce, fine Bolus half a dragme; stamp all that may be stamped very
small, and strew your meat therewith. Item, take powned Horstaile leaves one
dragme, and bestrew your meat with it. You may also drink of this powder
following one dragme, less or more with the water of Plantain: Take of the
first budded Hearts horn, burn them in a potbakers oven thoroughly to white
chalk, and give thereof one dragme or one dragme and a half with red wine or
Plantaine water. You shall also find hereafter many sundry powders and waters
to drink described: Take egshels whence young chickens have been hatched, and
Nutmegs, of each a like quantity, temper them together, and drink thereof the
weight of a dragme with Vinegar or Wine. The part within the Walnut taken a
dragme thereof does bind much.

Another. Take Tormentill and Nutmegs, of each a like quantity, Plantaine
seeds half as much, powne them to powder, and give it in the morning and
evening with old Beer. Item, take Trociscos de Carabe one dragme, beat them
to powder, and make a potion thereof with Plantaine water; this may be used the
space of a whole week together, for that they do calm and stay the flux: the
like does also red Coral one dragme with Plantaine water taken every day
always before meals.

Item, take burnt Hearts horn and powned Nettle seed, of each a like
quantity, and take thereof the weight of one dragme with the water of
Plantaine. The juice of Yarrow does bind also in this disease, if one take a
spoonefull or twain thereof. These juices ensuing may be decocted unto the
form of a sirupe, for to be used in winter time: like as the juice of broad
Plantaine, the juice of Shepherds purse, or Yarrow, etc. For this is also good
the water of Elderne drunken, and Galingall chewed.

Item, if a woman do flower too much, whether it be in childbirth or otherwise,
and that it be feared that she might bleed to death, then take one dragme of
red Nettle seed powned, and let her drink it with Plantaine water.

Some do give chopped and boiled Poppie heads to drink, but it is not always
convenient: there be much safer things, viz. these ensuing.

Take fine Bolus one quarter of an ounce, bind it in a cloth, hang it in a pot
of wine, and then drink thereof. Sees Pimpernell in pease broth, and drink
also thereof.

Or take dried Goats dung, stamp it to powder, and drink thereof; it does not
only stay the menstruall fluxes in women, but also all kind of bleeding. For
this also is very meet red Rose water drunken.

Amongst clisters is this following very highly commended: Take Swines bred,
Feuerfew, Baulme, Rue, Scabious, Rosemary flowers, Southernwood, Comin,
Siluermountain, Ameos, Amomum, Balsam fruit, Cucubes, Bayberries, Calmus,
Cassie wood, Cassia Fistula and pipes, of each one dragme and a half, Dill
seed, Annis seeds, of each one handful and a half, shaven Iuorie two
handfuls: sees them al together by a mild fire in two quarts of water unto the
half, and press it out, take twelve ounces of this decoction, oil of Sesamum,
of Rue, and of pepper, of each half an ounce, Indie salt one dragme,
Diacastoreon, confection of Bayberries and Benedicta, of each three dragmes,
temper them well together, and minister it very warm. With this following a
woman is to be fumed from beneath: Take Aliptae Muscatae, Species Nerae, of
each one dragme, Galliae Muscatae, and red Storax, of each three dragmes,
Allume one dragme and a half. Of this powder is a dragme to be used at once.
This temperature is not easily to be made, because of the manifold simples
which do come therein, and it is not only good for to stay the unnatural flux
of flowers, but is also good for the suffocation of the Matrix, for that it
dries, and is good for a barren womb, and especially if the malady proceed
of cold. Pessaries and such like: Stamp dried Ass dung, and form Pelsaries
thereof with the juice of Plantaine, and put it into the places.

Another. Take juice of knot grass and washed Sheep wool, dip it therein,
and lay it on the places.

Item, take Frankincense, Pomegranat blossoms, Gals, Antimonie, and the juice
of Sloes, of each a like quantity, bestrew the wool with it, and use it as
before.

For this, is also good half a handful of pouned Plantaine, and use it as
before: or make a small pessarie of the juice of Sloes, and the juice of
Pimpernell with Cotton.

Outwardly is this plaster ensuing to be used: Take the juice of Plantaine 11.
ounces, Rose water three ounces, Vinegar half an ounce, red Coral, Amber,
Bloudstone, fine Bolus, Myrtle seed, Akorne cups, and Frankincense, of each one
quarter of an ounce, sealed earth as much as is needful for to make it thick
enough: this being all beaten small and tempered together, then make two
plasters of it, and lay the one before, and the other behind.

The plaster ex Galbano may also be used, whereof here do follow two sorts.
Plaster of Galbanum.
Take Galbanum three ounces, Bdellium three quarters of an ounce, stamped
Feuerfew half an ounce, and half a drag. Mirrhe half a dragme: melt the Gums
in Vinegar. But if they be not clean, then wring them thorough a cloth, and
let the Vinegar sees away, then make a plaster thereof with Turpentine.

The other: Take Galbanum as much as you will, melt it by the fire in red wine,
temper fine Bolus amongst it, and Dragon blood, of each half as much as the
weight of the Galbanum, then make a plaster with sufficient Wax and
Turpentine.

Item, take pouned Lentils twelve ounces, Shepherds purse, and Plantaine, of
each three handfuls, dried Asses dung, and Goats dung, of each one ounce and a
half, Frankincense half an ounce, Dragon blood, Mints, of each one ounce and
a half, the juice of Sloes, Hypocistis, Licium, of each one ounce, five whites
of eggs, Bean meal three ounces, Gips four ounces, but steep the Gips the
space of a day in Vinegar, and then make a plaster thereof with the juice of
Plantaine, so that it may be sodden with the meal, until it be very thick.
Lastly, mix the rest amongst it, and when it has stood a good while, and is
well tempered together, then take it from the fire, and stir it continually
about until it be through cold. This plaster is to be laid over all the
priuities, and all the parts about it. The same plaster does maruellously stop
the blood of the Piles, and all moisture of the Matrix of salt and tough
humors, for that it is oftentimes approved.

Item, take the juice of Plantaine as much as you will, temper therein
Trociscos de Carabe, and then apply them as all the rest.

Or take Wormwood, Nightshade, and knotgrasse, of each a like much, stamp and
wring the juice out of it, then temper as much Rye meal amongst it, until it
be as thick as pap, afterward lay it over the navel, and over the priuities.
Another: take Vinegar dregs, make it hot, and wet a blew cloth in it, and lay
it thrice double over the priuities.

Before in the third part the tenth Chapter and 5.. ye have a precious Salve,
beginning, Take Comin, etc. which is also meet for this use.

There is also a Salve called De Gallia, which is thus to be prepared: Take
Comin, Dill seed, Caruway, Rue seed, Amcos, Gallia Muscata, of each one drag.
and a half, Epithimus one quarter of an ounce, Indy salt two scrup. white
Rosin one ounce and a half, oil of Dill two ounces, oil of Roses one ounce,
Aloe, Cloves, of each 2. scrup. molten wax as much as is needful for to make
a plaster of it, then lay it over the Kidneyes, and over the priuities: this
salve does not only stay the flux in women, but also expels the wind of the
stomach, and hinders parbraking. Or take Sandaraca one ounce and a half,
pouned Cypers nuts one ounce, fine Bolus four ounces, Plantaine seed, and
Pimpernell roots, of each two ounces and a half, Starch three ounces, then
make it with water wherein Akornes were decocted, unto a plaster or salve, and
use it as is said. There may also be made a bathe, as here follows: Sees
the roots of Curcuma in sufficient water, and make thereof a bath for the
raynes.

It is also good to make a bath wherein Allume is decocted, or any of these
things following, which one will, as Myrtle seed, the rinds and roots of the
Elm tree, the rinds of the Oak tree, Pomegranat blossoms and the peeles,
Akornes, Medlars, Lentils, and such like.

Item, it is said that if one do burn Ranam Arboream to ashes, and the ashes
worn on the neck, that women's terms will be stopped thereby, but it is to be
proved.

In like manner do some advise, that the moss of the black or Slo-thorne
worn in ones shoes, should also stop the same.

Item, take Shepherds purse, and bind it on the soales of a woman's feet.
Others advise also that boxing cups should be set under her breast vnpickt, for
that they draw the blood upwards, and it is also a very good remedy for to
stop therewith the flowing of the terms. Likewise it helps also exceedingly
to bind the arms hard, to the end that thereby the blood might be drawn
upwards.

Further, this setting of cups, binding, and all these things that are to be
put into the places admonished before, be especially to be used, if it be
perceived that through such superfluous courses women be impotent, and were
afraid of present falling into a swoune. In like manner also it is very
requisite that she smell oftentimes to cold things, and use other more binding
things, which be described in the first part, the eight Chapter, and the 7..

For a conclusion it is to be noted, whether there be heat or cold in this
woman, that the medicine may be ordained accordingly. These be all warming
things, and they also which stop blood, which do here follow, viz.
Frankincense, Mastick, Cypers nuts, Sandaraca, Laudanum, Mirrha, Storax, Annis,
and such like.

Cold stopping things be these, as Camfer, the juice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie,
Coriander, Dragon blood, Saunders, blood stone, Hypocistis, fine Bolus, Ruscus
seed, Myrtle seed, Gals, Pomgranat blossoms, the seed of Plantaine, the seed of
Melon, of Cucumbers, of Gourds, of Pompeons, and Pimpernell roots, etc.
whereby all tempered medicines may be adjudged.

Of the whites, or white flux in women.. 4.
THe disease which women do call the whites, and the Physicians Menstrua alba,
has a great acquaintance or fellowship with the auoidance of humane seed, or
the running of the raynes, whereof we have written at large before in the sixth
Chapter: and it is also very evidently declared, that such kind of fluxes be
caused through hot, and through cold causes which is here also to be noted.

But above all that which is there discoursed do all famous Physicians commend,
that if it proceed of heat, women be first of all to be purged: for which,
Cassie is passing good: afterward give her every other day one drag. of
Trociscos de Carabe tempered in Plantaine water, or a quarter of an ounce of
Triphera ex part Phenonis tempered with a little fine Bolus. The raines are to
be anointed with the salve of Roses, and with other things more which be
prescribed in the spermaticall flux. There is also to be given her every
second or third day one dragme of the filing of Iuorie to drink with Plantaine
water: and the cold loosings of Diamargariton is she also to use oftentimes.

Item: Take Camphora ten grains, bruise it small, beaten Amber one scruple:
drink them together with Plantaine water, it is a very good medicine.

For this is also esteemed to be a sure remedy, the first buds of the
Blackberrie bush, and the berries thereof dried, pouned, and drunken every day
one dragme with red wine, or twice a day. There may also be made a confection
of the said berries when they be ripe, seething the same with honey or Sugar,
and to use thereof daily.

But in case that this disease proceed of cold, whereto some do make six
kinds of bathes which are to be used one upon the other, which me thinks to
be much too strong, for that they take Sulphur, Alum, steeled water, and
strong Menageges, as Feuerfew, Mugwoort, and baiberries: afterward again all
things which be contrary, as Oken buds, Knotgrasse, Squinant, etc. Therefore
will we leave the same unmentioned: but for this must be taken the flowers of
dead Nettles poudered the weight of a dragme with wine. Confected Annis seed is
also very commodious for this. But in case that the issue be very sharp, then
beat whites of eggs with Rose water, and make clothes wet in it and put it up
into women's secrets.

Of the suffocation or ascension of the Matrix.. 5.
THis terrible sickness is in many things most like to the falling evil
Epilepsiae, and the great swouning Syncopi, because the Matrix has great
sympathy with the heart, the arteries, brains, and with the two membranes
which do cover the brains. This malady comes to women through diverse
causes, and especially when there is retention of their terms or flowers, yea
also through the retention of their natural seed, especially to them that be
accustomed to have the company of a man, and must then forbear it, as widows,
and aged maidens: for that in case the foresaid seed be retained, then causes
it many kinds of winds in the Matrix which do compel it so to ascend, that
otherwhiles it oppresses even the Diaphragma. This is then the opinion of
diverse learned men in this case: but Galen does dispute against it with strong
reasons, that the foresaid natural seed does much rather cause this sickness,
than the retention of the terms; chiefly in women which also are burdened
with many bad humors, be full of blood, and brought up in idleness, have
accustomed to accompany with a man (like as is expressed) and now suddenly are
constrained to want it. Therefore is commonly seen, says he, that this
suffocation for the most part troubles widows. He maintains also and that
by good reason, that the mother does not ascend even to the Diaphragma (which
is the midriffe) and there does abridge the breath.

Thus may be caused through the retention and putrefaction of the seed, all
manner of troublesome accidents, as giddines and pains of the head, madness,
short breath, and panting of the heart, their natural color does alter into a
yellow pale, yea sometimes into rednes of the face and of the eyes, they gnash
with their teeth, draw their hands and feet away, they do also feel that there
ascends somewhat upwards out of the belly, and commonly then do they press
down their belly with their hands; they also do sit commonly with bent knees
on the ground; they loose their speech: and nevertheless when one calls them
by their names, then do they hear it, but they cannot answer, and do lie
oftentimes, that neither breath nor pulse, nor any life can be perceived in
them, yea are taken to be dead: and also sometimes they are so taken or
assailed with these kinds of maladies that they depart out of this world:
nevertheless they always retain their memory and knowledge; and when they
come again to themselves, then do they rehearse all that is spoken and done.
So that this disease (like as is rehearsed) is in many things to be compared
with the falling sickness, only that they do not foam. In like manner it is not
unlike the palsy, but only that there is no long breath with it, and very like
the sleeping sickness Lethargo, but that there is no ague with it. Amongst all
the foresaid signs is there no worse than the retention of the breath, for
that the same cannot be long holden up without death follow after it; for that
a body cannot live without breath.

This grievous accident may also be caused through a strong cold, which does so
sore assail a body, that thereby all his breath and pulse will be so drawn
inward that by the feeling it can be at no hand perceived, as we have also
admonished here and there in the first part amongst the diseases of the
brains. In fine, the mean to remedy this terrible disease consists in
three several things.

The first what is to be done in the hasty accident for to hinder the
stifeling.

The second (if so be that this disease be caused through retention of the
seed) what is to be used for it.

The third, in case that this be caused through retention of the terms, or
through any other had humors, how one is to behave her self therein. When as
this disease comes with hinderance of the breath, then is speedy help
needful: therefore is cold well water, or Rose water to be cast by and by into
her face, and to hold to the mouth and nose to the end it may compel the
breath backward, and break out with force: also the hands, feet, buttocks, and
thighs, are to be rubbed hard with Vinegar and salt, and afterward to be
bounden very hard. Another woman must make her finger fat with odoriferous oil
(as oil of Lillies, or any other) and therewith anoint the neck of the womb
or Matrix, and rub the same softly to the end that the Matrix be thereby
drawn downwards. Further, there is a little neesing powder to be blown into
the nose, to the end that through the strong motion of neesing the mother may
be drawn downward. They are also to be called hard and lowdlie by their
names, and to keep away all pleasant savors from their nose: but the places
are to be fomented, anointed, or fumed with all odoriferous things. Also a
great boxing cup is to be set upon the same place vnpickt. You are also to hold
all filthy loathsome savors before the nose, as Assa foetida, Galbanum, or
Beuercod: also the smell of old clouts, of shoes burnt, of hair, of feathers,
and such like that may be gotten speedily, are you to let her smell unto. For
that (like as we in the beginning of the description of the Matrix or mother
have admonished) the mother does fly and avoid by nature all stinking things,
and to the contrary loves all odoriferous fumes and savors: yet are these
stinking things not to be used but in extreme need: for that all that stinketh
very lothsomely, does also weaken and infeeble nature. Amongst these foresaid
things is Hares hair also very requisite. The cheifest odoriferous things
which are to be used beneath is Muscus and Ambra meet. And if one can get it
suddenly this powder following is to be taken.

Take red Storax, Lignum Aloes, and cloves, of each one dragme, Musk, Amber,
of each half a dragme; make all to powder, then bind it in a cloth and put it
up into their places.

Item: Take one ounce of the oil of Lillies, Muscus, and Saffron, of each
three grains; bruise them well together and dip a taint in it, and put it into
the place, or fill a small bag with salt and use it as before.

You are also to make a fume with these things following, and to receive the
same through an Ammell: Take Cassie wood, Cinnamom, Thyme, Gallia Muscata, and
such like. But if these will not help, then use one of the strong pessaries
and others which be described before in this chapter and the 2..

Verum (saluo pudore) praesentissimum Remedium est, si maritus vngat Penum cum
Oleo Garyophyllorum, admixto parum Olei amygdalarum dulcium; ad caliditatem
prioris temperandam, and cum vxore Cocat: Matrix enim subito descendet.

When as now this patient begins to recover again (being a maiden) and
inclined to this grievous sickness, then is there no better remedy, than that
she induce her self into the state of matrimony: if not, then is she to
refrain from all these things, which do increase natural seed; as flesh,
wine, and other, like as before is described in the sixth Chapter, and the 4..
and the seventh Chapter and the 8.. For this is also letting of blood very
meet, the use of all cooling meats, and the absence of men. All mineral
bathes which do dry, be also very fit for this use, and she may also use
therewith these confections following.

Take fresh roots of Polypody six ounces, Seen leaves, Violets, Prunes,
Sebestes, sower Dates, and Currants, of each one ounce and a half; sees them
in two quarts of water unto the half, afterward wring it out: and whilst
that the decoction is yet warm, steep therein six ounces of the seeds of
Fleawoort, so long that the muscilage may be drawn out of them, then put 24.
ounces of white Sugar unto it. Likewise also the pith of sower Dates and Cassie
which are prepared with the foresaid decoction, of each three ounces: then
sees them again together by a mild fire until that it be thick, and temper
with it these things following beaten very small, burnt Iuorie, Rubarbe, red
and white Saunders, Roses, Violets, white Poppy seed, Purslain seed Endive
seed, Lettice seed, small Endive seed, of Fennel, Dragagant, Starch, scraped
Iuory, Gum, Hollihockes, Fumitory, Licorice, and Annis seeds, of each a dragme
and a half, Diagridion two dragmes and a half, Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, of
each three dragmes: temper them all together in a mortar, and give from half
an ounce unto seven drag. This foresaid electuary is so highly commended, that
it is called the gift of God. These are also not every day, but only once or
twice to be used, with a decoction of Mugwort and Sugar, and then to fast six
hours upon it.

This being done, there shall a round plaster be laid upon the navel De
Galbano, and not to take it off, before it fall away of it self, whereof there
be two diverse sorts discovered before in the 3.. Lastly, these pills ensuing are
to be used: Take Siluermountaine, Madder, Penniroyal, the innermost rindes of
Cassie pipes, Pomegranate kernels, Pyony roots, and Calmus, of each three
dragmes, Muscus, and Spica of Indie, of each half a dragme: then make pills
thereof with the juice of Mugwoort, of them is she to take every day, or at
leastwise about the other day, if she do not use the Confection, and that
before supper. But the same is not to be given if the terms be present, but
when they be past, if you will have them milder, then put one drag. and a half
of Aloes unto them.

But in case that this ascension of the Mother be caused through the
obstruction of the terms, and that a woman be come to her self again, and
that it is feared that it will return again, by reason that the cause is not
yet taken away, and that it be certain that this disease were caused through
the retention of the terms, or of the natural seed; then must diligence be
used that the terms be preferred and moved, whereof we have before given a
full instruction.

Item, if this suffocation of the Matrix proceed through obstruction or
hinderance of the terms, then give her one quarter of an ounce of powdered
Agaricus with Wine or with Honey water, for it is a sure mean for it. It is
also very good for the same, that there be taken one dragme of the powned Agnus
Castus with one ounce of the honey of Roses, especially if the disease do come
through the detention of the seed: the Trocisci de Myrrha do also move much.

Secondly, the Saphea is also to be opened in the foot, and afterward one
dragme of powned Betonie with the water of Feuerfew. In like manner also boxing
cups are to be set upon the thighs picked or vnpicked. Cut a piece of bread
round like to a Dollor, and set three wax candles in it of the length of a
finger, set them so burning upon the navel, and then whelme over it a glass
of a quarterne long, then do the candles go out, and the glass does draw the
Mother or Matrix perforce into her due and wonted place: and this has been
oftentimes approved.

Item, anoint all the belly with oil of Masticke, and make a pot lid warm,
wind it about with clothes, and hold it warm to the belly.

Item, take Beuercod and Assa foetida, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Philonium Romanum, one dragme; temper them together, and give it fasting, then
drink upon it a good draught of Muscadell or Malmsey, it helps marvelous
well.

The same virtue has Triphera magna, the weight of a dragme and a half
drunken with wine in the morning early. Likewise is also good for this one
dragme of powned Pionie seeds drunken with Honey water.

If the Matrix or Mother begin to ascend, then is to be taken one quarter of an
ounce of yellow Rape seed with the water of Mugwort.

For a plaster, you are to take Galbanum one dragme and a half, Bdellium one
dragme, Mugwort, Feuerfew, of each half an ounce, oil of Lillies one ounce;
dissolve the gummes in the oil, and when they begin to be cold, then temper
the powder amongst it: with this salve they are to anoint them beneath and
above the navel, and then to lay a plaster of Galbanum upon it.

Item, take Assa foetida one ounce, Galbanum two ounces, melt them in vinegar,
and spread them warm upon a leather of a quarter long, then lay them over the
navel: the Galbanum is also good used alone. Whenever you will lay any thing
upon the place of the pain, then take the roots of Louage, cut them very
small and put them in a bag. Comes the pain of the Mother through cold? then
sees it in Wine; but if it be through heat, then sees them it water, and lay
it on the place of the pain. Could you not get these roots? then take Acorne
buds, it is also good.

Neesing and parbraking is much advised for this, but especially heed must be
taken to the strength of the patient.

And in case that the same woman must live without a man, then is she so much
the oftener to use anointing with the odoriferous salues with the fingers
beneath, and use therewith all things which do diminish natural seed, as Rue,
Agnus Castus, and such like, as elsewhere has been showed. Besides all these,
you may look all that has been said before in the second. of the terms in
women.

Of the descension and falling down of the Mother or Womb.. 6.
LIke as the Womb or Mother in women ascends, so does it also descend, so
that it comes so low, that she being turned about, it depends, and with a
long end hangs out of the body, like as is wont to happen with the Arsegut,
whereof we have written in the tenth Chapter and the second.

The causes of this disease may be outward and inward: the outward may come of
falls, heavy birth, long sitting upon a cold stone, or in the water, through
hard going to stool, through strong neesing, through running, leaping, through
use of much cold salve, and such like. The inward be when the body is pestered
and full of humors, which afterward do fall even to the womb, which do so
unknit and dissolve the bands and stays of the same, that they cannot hold the
mother any longer; like as oftentimes befalls in the palsy and falling
sickness, also in ulcers and impostumes of the womb. The signs of this
disease be manifest, if the same be caused through any outward causes, the same
may be inquired of the patient her self. Otherwise it is to be considered
whether the woman be fat, moist, live in quiet, is wont to eat much fruit, or
much fish, etc. They have also oftentimes pain about the privy members, and
in the nether part of the backbone. There comes also sometimes an Ague with
it, retention of the urine, and hardening of the stool. Some get also much
trembling, the crampe, and great fear, without any manifest causes, with many
more grievous accidents. Now in case that the descension of the Mother do yet
remain somewhat inwardly, then must a Midwife behold and search her: to wit,
then she must put one finger into the neck of the womb or Matrix: if the
passage be smooth and open, then is the Mother not fallen down; but if she find
therein any stop or let, then it is a sure sign that it is descended: and if
so be that the Matrix or Mother continue long out of her natural place, then is
if impossible that she should be reduced again into her due and natural
place, and more impossible if the same depend out of the body.

Thus for to remedy this disease, then may one choose out of these things
following those which are thought to be best and most meet, according to the
quality of the disease. First of all take three boxing cups, and set the one
upon the navel or under the breasts, and the other two above the priuities
vnpickt: these may draw the Matrix again into her accustomed place. The
Midwife may also anoint the body within with oil of Masticke, and do
whatsoever is possible by manual operation to set the same again into her
natural place.

Secondly, take a glowing brick, and strew thereon this powder following: Take
Tormentil, the juice of Sloes, and Bistorta, of each three dragmes, the peeles
and blossoms of Pomegranats, of each one quarter of an ounce, Assa foetida one
ounce, Mastick, Frankincense, Galbanum, of each two dragmes and a half, Cipers
nuts, Gals, Myrtle seed, of each five dragmes; stamp them together, and mix
them well together: this fume is she to receive from beneath, but heed must be
had that it come not into the nose: for to hold to her nose, serve none other
but well sauouring and sweet smelling things, Ambra, Muscus, and Violets, and
all savors which are most acceptable unto her. These bad savors (as is said
before) cause the Mother to ascend again. This same is also to be used whilst
that the boxing cups are fastened.

Item, take a stinking egg from a brood hen, and dip cotton in it, and then
lay it upon the dependant neck of the Matrix, then will it forthwith be drawn
up again.

Or take Cammomil, Marierom and Caruway, of each one handful, Linseed one
handful and a half; sees it in water, and receive the vapor thereof.

If so be that there be heat with it, then are you to use this vapor
following: Take Housleeke as much as you please, beat it gross, and
afterward lay it upon a hot stone, and let the woman receive the vapor
thereof.

Thirdly, then is this fomentation to be made: Take three ounces of Roses,
Myrtle seed, Violet leaves, Marigolds and Feuerfew, of each one handful, Assa
foetida five dragmes; break them all together, then put them in a bag and
sees them in red wine, and lay it after the vapor received upon the foresaid
place.

Or take the blossoms and pills of Pomegranates, Cipers nuts, the rinds of
Medlars and of the Service tree, of each one ounce, Allume one ounce and a
half, sees them all together in red wine, and foment therewith the places and
the parts adjacent of the Matrix. Some do also advise to take Ox dung tempered
with red wine, and to receive the vapor of it from beneath.

Fourthly, let every day the neck of the Mother and al parts about the Mother
be anointed with the salve Althea, but temper amongst it some marrow of any
beasts, the fat of fowls, and oil as much as you please: do this in the
evening when she goes to bed. You may also of such like things make a
plaster, and apply it all the whole night as before.

Or take the oil of Mirtles, of Lillies, and of Masticke, of each two ounces
and a half, Assa foetida, Bistorta, and Tormentill, of each three dragmes: the
gum is to be molten, then powne all that is to be powned, and make a salve
thereof, anoint therewith the body outwardly, and also upon the kidneyes.

Lesser. Take the yolks of two well brayed eggs, put unto them one ounce and
a half of the oil of Roses, fresh butter half an ounce, make a salve
thereof, and use it as before.

The dependant Matrix is to be washed often with wine which is steeled.

Also the oil of sweet Almonds may be used for this purpose.

Fifthly: Take Assa foetida one ounce, Masticke, Frankincense, Myrtle seed,
Galingall, and Cipers nuts, of each one dragme, stamped together very small,
mix it with the oil of Mirtles, and anoint therewith a pessarie, afterward
put it into the places.

Sixthly: Take Rosin two ounces, Frankincense, Masticke, and Cypers gum, of each
half an ounce, temper it together, and let it melt; make it then with the oil
of Masticke to a plaster, and wear it upon the priuities: it will stay and
let that the Mother or Matrix cannot fall any further out of the body. Or take
Masticke one ounce, Frankincense half a dragme, Cipers nuts, Galls and Myrtle
seed, of each one dragme, pills and blossoms of Pomegranates, and
Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce; powne all that is to be powned,
and temper it all together with Turpentine and oil of Masticke, as much as
will suffice for to make a mild plaster, spread it on a cloth of a quarter
long, and half a quarter broad, wear this plaster continually between the
navel and the priuities.

The common people do much commend to sit upon Oaken boords, and to receive the
fume of dried Caruway from beneath: cakes baked with the dried seeds of
Verbascum, and to eat them: to eat Annis seeds: to anoint the dependant
Matrix oftentimes with the juice of Sloes; and above all, vomiting and
parbraking, thereby to draw the Matrix upwards, are very good.

Above all these which be before discovered against the descension of the
Matrix, are these things ensuing also very good: Take burnt Date stones beaten
small, and strew of this powder upon the dependant member.

A stronger. Take Mumia, Licium, Hypocistis, powned Galls, of each two
scruples, burnt and small beaten Oyster shells two dragmes and a half, then
make a powder thereof, and use it as is before said. Item, take a wax candle of
the length of six fingers breadth, and one finger thick, anoint it with oil
of Lillies and put it up into the place.

Item, take Cipers nuts, vnwormeaten Oken leaves, Squinant and Cammomill, of
each half an ounce, Roses one quarter of an ounce, Hares hair cut small,
half a dragme: stamp all to powder, and put it in a bag of the length and
breadth of a finger, then steep it in warm wine wherein Cammomill has been
decocted, and so put it up into the body.

This woman is also to sit up to the navel in a bath, wherein Allume and other
astringent things have been decocted, and let her sit therein about an hour.

Other do counsel to use this bag following: Take Oken buds, Medlar leaves,
Service leaves, the uppermost sprigs of Ladies thistles, Cipers leaves, of each
one handful, the sprigs of Mirtles, Valerian, wild mints, of each two
handfuls, chop them all small, afterward put them into a bag, let it sees
well, and sit thereon when you are in the bath.

For a conclusion, there serves for this intent all that is prescribed before
in the tenth chapter and second. of the falling out of the Arsegut, for that
both these diseases have one kind of cause. Likewise also there are many things
specified in the third part, the third chapter, and second. of the tumerous
breasts, which are meet for this purpose, like as also hereafter of women in
childbed shall be said.

So much be then spoken of this suffocation and descension of the mother: now
we will proceed of other accidents which also concern the Matrix or mother.

Of the pain in the Mother or Matrix through wind.. 7.
FIrst of al each one may be well assured which has any understanding, that
every unnatural accident which this part in women, to wit, the Matrix (whether
it be of outward or inward causes) is subject to, cannot be without pain,
which the Grecians do call Hysteralgian. Amongst these, the causes be most
winds, which cause no less pain in that place then they do in the guts,
whereof we will at this present write and discourse.

The causes of this may be blows, thrusts and falls. Item outward cold, which
causes an obstruction in the neck of the mother, whereby the winds be
detained. These winds be also caused sometimes through hard and painful
bearings, or through the long use of windy meats, as Rapes, Chestnuts, Rye
bread, and such like. The signs of these winds be pain in the matrix, and
other parts adjacent, swelling up of the belly, and that the pain is now here
now there.

To remedy this disease, some famous Physicians do advise that the body is
first to be purged through some common clisters, through Cassie, or through the
powder of Hiera picra; and that afterward one quarter of an ounce of Triphera
magna shall be taken in the morning with good wine, for the same is esteemed
especial good.

These winds be also caused oftentimes through vomiting and parbraking.

Secondly, take for it two ounces and a half of Oxymel, and three ounces of
the water of Cammomill, afterward set a common clister.

Thirdly, foment the belly with wine wherein Cammomill is decocted. Lastly may
Triphera or Philonium be used.

This foresaid Philonium is very good, but (as is oftentimes admonished) men
must deal prouidently in it, for the Triphera is much safer.

Afterward do the famous Physicians command to proceed with these things
which do follow.

Take Turbith one dragme or four scruples, according as the woman is strong,
Ginger one scruple, give it her with water of Mugwort, or with common well
water, wherein Mugwort is decocted: this a very excellent medicine for to
assuage all pains of the matrix.

If so be that one peradventure fear any mischance, because the winds of the
matrix do oftentimes cause it then take Caruway seed which is steeped in
Vinegar, and dried again and powdered, one dragme, Ameos, Ginger, Beuercod, of
each one scruple, temper them together, and give one dragme thereof with wine
certain days together. Or take Gentian the weight of one dragme with wine,
which eases them marvelous much, for that it expels not only the pain,
but also preuenteth that there return no pain unto it.

In the twelfth chapter and 11.. you have a potion with Gentian and others,
which may also be used for this with great advancement.

Amongst the remedies which may be outwardly used, first is bathing good,
whereto this following is to be prepared: Take Marierom, field mints,
Southernwood, Fennel, and such like things which expel wind, sees these in
water for a bath.

Or if so be that bathing is not meet, then use fomenting of warm wine,
wherein Cammomill is decocted, and afterward anoint the belly will the oil
of Elderne. Item, take oil of Mastick one ounce, melt therein one quarter of
an ounce of Laudanum and anoint you therewith, yet the oil of Lillies and of
Wallflowers passes all.

Item, rere sodden eggs brayed well with sweet milk, and some Saffron
tempered amongst it, and then laid upon it, are highly commended for this use.
It is also said, that if black Hellebore be laid beneath before the Matrix,
then does it draw all moisture unto it. But the Physicians do sees Hellebore,
and make a cloth wet in the same decoction; this cleanses the Matrix from all
wind, without any molestation. This plaster following is especially commended
for all winds and swellings of the Matrix: Take Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of
each two ounces, Agnus Castus, Centorie, Southernwood, Marierom, field mints,
Ameos, and Cassie wood, of each one dragme and a half, Turpentine as much as
is needful for to make thereof two plasters, then lay one before and the
other behind.

Of the pain in the Mother through cold.. 8.
TAke Doronicum, Zeduary roots, the seeds of Smallage and Cinnamome, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Frankincense half a dragme, Beuercod one dragme,
white Sugar one ounce, temper them and stamp them all together, and give
thereof a spoonful with wine. In the first part and the twelfth chapter there
is a remedy for the memory, to wit, of a grosser powder, which is also
marvelous good to warm and strengthen the cold Matrix. Item, take one dragme
of Treacle, Saffron four grains, temper them in two ounces of Mugwort water,
and then drink it fasting, and fast three hours upon it. Mithridate is also
very good for all diseases of the Matrix, and chiefly for them that proceed of
cold. There is more good for this, Beuercod about the weight of a dragme
tempered with oil of Cammomill, and the belly anointed with it. Ripe Juniper
berries eaten be also very good for this disease. The first Balsam (which is
described in the eight part) is also especially good for the same, al
plasters, oiles, salues, and fomentations, which be described in more other
places, may be also used for this.

The simple things which be meet for a cold Matrix, be these, to wit, Mugwort,
Rue, Sage, Sauine tree, Assa foetida, Madder, Juniper, Penniroyall, field
mints, white water mints, Calmus, Serapinum, and all that warmeth the kidneyes.

Of the pain in the Mother through heat.. 9.
THere comes also otherwhiles a great pain in the Matrix through heat, so
that there must oftentimes things be used which take away and dead the senses,
like as the iniection of Henbane seed or Poppy seed, but it must be prouidently
taken in hand, and not to use the same but in great heat. But if you will any
thing that is more weaker, then sees the Poppy heads in water, and iniect the
decoction thereof, and foment it therewith on the outside. Warm sweet milk
iniected also is good for this purpose.

Of the contraction of the Mother, or the neck of the same.. 10.
IT chances also sometimes that the neck of the Mother is closed clean up,
waxes narrow, and shrinketh up. And for to mollify or soften the same, take
Hollihocke roots as many as you please, sees them in Swines grease or in
Turpentine, to the end it be a soft plaster; then dip a clout in it, and put
it up into the neck of the Matrix. The same does also the water wherein
Hollihocke roots be decocted. In like sort also the oil of white Narcissus.

Of the Schirrus, or hardness of the Mother.. 11.
OVt of these forementioned accidents of the Matrix, whether it be through
heat or cold, cannot these parts be hardened any way, but as the Spleen is
hardened: for which these means ensuing be very good: Take Aloe one ounce,
Masticke one quarter of an ounce, Galbanum dissolved in Vinegar one ounce; and
being strained, temper the rest amongst it, and then make it with oil of
Cammomill and Wax into a meetly hard plaster. The plaster of Melilot is also
good for this use.

Item, sees Figs and Fenegreeke as much as you please in Barley water, and
make thereof a Semicupe. This foresaid bath is good both for the pain and the
heat also. There may also be used all that is before admonished in the
sixteenth Chapter and first. These herbs following do carry all other medicines
toward the Matrix; as Penniroyall, Rosemary, Sauine tree, Juniper, Rue,
Beuercod, Yarrow, Cinquefoyle, Myrrha, Sage, Madder and Lupins. But because
that all these foresaid things do also lead all things toward the Bladder and
the Kidneyes, so do they the same also to the Matrix.

Of the Impostume in the Mother, or in the neck of the same.. 12.
IF so be that these foresaid diseases, as the retention of the terms of
natural seed, or any other sharp humor, whether it be blood, Cholera, Phlegma,
or Melancholia winds, or any other cold moisture, the which falls down to
the Matrix, then may they soon cause an impostume: notwithstanding the same
can proceed well of any outward causes, as of blows, falls, leachery, through
a mischance, through the ignorant dealing of the Midwife, and such like things
more, the which do bring with them either heat or cold. The signs of a hot
impostume, be Agues, great pain between the navel and the priuities, and
round about the raines, much watching, unquietness, and pain in making water
and going to stool, swift pulse, pain of the head and of the eyes, heavy
breath, pain of the stomach with much parbraking.

These impostumes will be very hardly cured, and the harder if they are
situated deep in the Matrix: but generally they are to be cured like as the
impostumes and ulcers of the raines are taught to be healed, viz. as in the
sixteenth chapter and 6. 7. 8. 9.. has been showed.

But here be first certain rules to be noted, whereof the first is, that one
must endeavor to carry away the matter from thence which descends
thitherwards. Secondly, the Liver vein is to be opened, and afterward the
vein in bending the knee, or if one can neither see nor find it, then is the
Saphea to be taken. Thirdly, if so be that this impostumation be in the Matrix,
or in the neck of the same, then be the terms in no wise to be moved, but
only (like as is said) to withdraw the matter into another place. Fourthly,
after the letting of blood is the patient to bo purged. Fifthly, vomiting and
parbraking is very commodious. Sixthly, if it be possible she is to refrain the
space of three days from eating and drinking, or at least keep her self very
sparingly, and especially in drinking. Seventhly, she must watch as much as is
possible. Eighthly, after that the body is well purged, then is the Matrix in
the beginning of the sickness to be delayed with such kinds of plasters as
derive the matter from that place. Ninthly, amongst these foresaid remedies,
temper always somewhat which may assuage the pain. Tenthly, in the
declination of the disease are those things good which do ripen and mollify
the matter until it issue and break out. Eleuenthly, if so be that this
impostume would not be maturated and brought to matter, then is the same to be
effected with Fenegreeke, with Hollihocke roots, with Cammomill, with Wheat
flower, with Pigeon dung, and with some Saffron being made to a plaster and
laid thereupon. Twelftly, the astringent remedies are not to be long used, to
the end the impostumes be not hardened: according to all these foresaid rules,
every one may know how to order her self in the curing of this disease.

If this impostume do come through heat, then is heed first to be taken
whether the sick person be bound in her body; if it be so, then are mild
clisters to be set, or Suppositories, and afterward to open a vein, as has
been showed in the second rule. She is also to be fed with Barley paps, stued
Spinach, and such like things: and to prepare the matter, give unto her the
iulep or sirupe of Violets at certain times to drink, and afterward purge
her with Cassie, sower Dates or Manna, and also move her otherwhiles to vomit.
Afterward unto the raines, the kidneyes and the hips, are cooling salues,
plasters, and such like things to be applied, and so to cool them as much as
is possible; for which you are to use this salve following: Take Dragagant and
Gum, of each one ounce, dissolve them in wine, and temper therewith washed
Ceruse, the Litharge of Gold, Starch, Dragon blood, fine Bolus, and Roses, of
each one dragme, burnt Copper two scruples, oil of Roses and Wax, as much as
suffices for to make a salve therewith: but if so be that one cannot apply the
same to the malady, then sees them all together with milk (except the Wax)
and then dip a cloth therein or a sponge, and lay it upon the disease.

If you had rather have somewhat else, then take the muscilage of Fleawort
alone, or temper it with oil of Roses, with broad Plantaine water, with the
water of Nightshade, and with the white of an Egg.

There may also a great tent of Cotton be made, and the same dipped in this
receipt following, and put into the neck of the Matrix. Take Wax and oil of
Violets, of each half an ounce, let all melt together, and whilst that it is
yet warm, put thereto the juice of Plantaine, of Nightshade, of each one
ounce, Camfer half a dragme, then temper them well together in a mortar, and
use it as is aforesaid. If so be that there be any great pain with it, then
use oil of Roses brayed with the white of an egg, and tempered with hens
grease: but if the pain will not assuage and cease therewith, then is the
vein in the ham to be opened, and with the foresaid decoction Poppie seed is
to be tempered. In like manner Sief Album is to be tempered with woman's milk
which gives suck to a daughter or maiden child, and to be iniected.

This plaster is also very good for it: Take Cammomill, Melilot, Hollihocke
roots, Linseede and Fenegreeke, of each one ounce, eight or ten Figs, six
or seven Dates, stamp and sharpen this all together, and make a plaster
thereof with water wherein Violets be decocted, and with oil of Roses. At the
greatest extremity there is to be put unto it a little Opium, Poppy seed, and
Henbane seed. If so be that the impostume will be long a breaking, then temper
amongst it one ounce and a half of powned Pigeon dung, Mustard seed half an
ounce, Fennel seed three quarters of an ounce. But if this impostume be in
any place where it may be seen, or where one may come by it, then is it to be
opened through other means: when it is open, then cleanse it with Barley water
or Honey water, wherein Hyssop, Sauine, Madder, Mugwort, and such like be
decocted.

And if so be that the place must be incarnated, then take Aloe, Mirrhe,
Frankincense, Sarcocolla, Dragon blood, litharge of Gold, and prepared Tutia,
of each a like quantity; make then a salve thereof with Wax and oil of
Roses, and use it according as opportunity serves. And as before has been
said, cooling plasters are to be used for it, and to take any of the things
following, viz. Roses, Lentils, blossoms and peeles of Pomegranates, the
muscilage of Fleawort, Nightshade, Tassel, fresh sliced Gourds, and Saunders;
all these are to be tempered with barley meal, and sodden to a plaster, and
then to be laid over the priuities.

Afterward in the beginning of the disease, the juice of broad Plantaine is
to be iniected oftentimes into the Matrix.

And to the end the Matrix inwardly may be perfectly mundified, prepare this
water following: Take Gals, Lentils, Pomegranate blossoms, Butchers broom
seeds, Roses and Sanders, of each a like quantity, sees them in water, and
iniect the decoction into the place.

Or take Hyssope, Wormwood, honey of Roses, sees the same in white wine and
milk, and use it as is aforesaid.

When the Matrix is cleansed from all uncleanness, then is this bath to be
used for to heal and to cause the flesh to grow: Take Centorie six ounces,
Ireas, Comfrey, Cassie roots, and Agrimonie, of each three handfuls,
Sarcocolla, Gum, Dragon blood, Mumia, Hypocistis, and Frankincense, of each one
dragme: sees them all together in sufficient water unto the half, then put
thereto prepared refuse of Iron one ounce and a quarter, then let it sees
awhile and wax cold that it may be used for a bath. Of all the former things
may plasters, salues and pessaries be made, for they are to that intent very
meet and profitable. Or if you will have a mean and milder bath, then take
Mallows, Violet leaves, Melilot, Plantaine, Lentils, Fenegreeke, and Colewort
buds, and make a bath of it.

In like sort sodden Allume is auailable for this purpose, for this bath is
generally commended of all learned men.

But when the ague and the most pain is somewhat past, and yet the impostume
remains still, which may be perceived when the ague returns, and the pain
and hardness between the navel and the priuities continues, then are
mollifying things to be used, as these pessaries following: Take Duckes grease,
the marrow of Hearts bones, Neates feet oil, Bdellium, Saffron, and yolks of
roasted eggs, of each a like quantity; dissolve them together in wine, and
temper therewith the bottom of oil of Lilles, then dip a taint of linen
often therein, and put it into the place: it swageth the pain, and allayeth
the same. But of this hardness we shall shortly hereafter speak and discourse
somewhat more at large.

But if this impostume be caused through cold, then does the same happen
through abundance of much Phlegma in the body, and that through a continual
use of meat and drink, whereby the Phlegma is augmented, whereby such like
humors do fall down to that place, and there do putrify and rankle. This
impostume does appear with a swelling above the priuities near the nauel, and
that with a continual ach, and yet no great pain, the woman is sleepie, and
very lither: and these signs be the more certain, if the time of the year
and the age of the patient do agree with them.

For this, neither cold nor repelling remedies are meet, but maturatiues, and
such as expel Phlegma, sobriety, plasters of meetly warm, discussiue and
ripening seeds, laying on of Cammomil, of Melilot, Sauine, Marierom, Mugwort,
Linseede, Fenegreeke, admixed with the foresaid oiles and greases, and they may
also be sodden and iniected. Likewise for this are meet, salues and plasters
which do warm, moisten and ripen, whereof we have before admonished, and shall
again hereafter.

The third manner of the impostumation of the Mother, is such a bad and hard
disease, and is much worse than any of the former, especially when it is
confirmed and waxen old, for then it is not to be curred, but at last there
comes the canker of it, whereof we shall immediately hereafter speak and
discourse at large. But to do some ease for it, is the place to be anointed
with warm and maturatiue oiles, marrows and greases of beasts, and the
decoction of Linseed, of Fenegreeke seed, and oil of Cammomill, of Dill, or of
Lillies to be iniected. Also they are to wear plasters de Bdellio, of liquid
Storax, and of Ammoniacum thereon, and to use these fomentations and bathes
following: Take the roots of Hollihocke two ounces, Cammomil, Melilot,
Mallows, Violet leaves, Linseed and Fenegreeke seed, of each one ounce, let
them sees well in water, and of these decocted herbs shall you make plasters
with some of the foresaid greases, viz. with swines grease, hens and duckes
grease, etc.

Use also this salve following: Take oil of Lillies and of Elderne, cony fat,
the fat of Quails, Neates feet oil, and oil of Hearts feet, oil of sweet
Almonds, and Butter, of each one ounce, anoint therewith the neck of the
mother within and without, then anoint therewith a pessary of cotton and put it
therein. And if so be the same do not content thee, then look into the eleventh
chapter, the 29. and 30.. of the impostumes in the stomach.

Item, of the impostume in the liver, the 12. chapter and 7.. and 14. chapt.
and 2.. of the impostume of the milt, where you shall find a sufficient
direction for it.

Of the canker and ulcer of the womb or Matrix.. 13.
WHat the difference is between the impostume and ulcer, is before in the
eleventh Chapter, and nine and twentieth. sufficiently declared of the impostume
of the stomach. But the ulcers of the Matrix be very noisome and perilous (as
we have before alleged) and so qualified, that very easily they may come unto
an incurable canker; for this ulcer and the canker have a great communion one
with another: yet this difference is between them, that where the canker is,
there must also be an ulcer, but not every impostume the canker. Thus may
ulcers be helped with the things which be ordained for the clefts of the
Arsegut, and of the woman's places; where to the contrary, the canker of this
place is esteemed by all learned Physicians for to be incurable. The causes of
these ulcers and canker of the Matrix may be (as we have already showed of the
vlceration in the nostrils in the first part) of wounds, of thrusts, of blows,
of falls, of some unclean impostume, of some sharp humors which do excoriate
and exulcerate the Matrix, or the neck of the same within. The canker is
commonly caused through melancholicke blood, which makes a hard impostume, and
begins first only of a small hardness, as the bigness of a pease or
Bean, and afterward increases, the which at last fills the veins adjacent
also with melancholicke, thick, and black blood, whereby it will be harder
and greater from day to day. The heat augmenteth with pricking until that it
break out, whence then issues a black green matter, and otherwhiles like as
it were wine lees, and sometimes like to water, the which stinketh none
otherwise than as it were a carren, and corrodeth more and more, for that is
the nature of cankers.

The signs of these vlcerations be pain, pricking, panting of the mother, and
issue or descent of purulent matter according to the quality of the ulcer. But
if it be caused through any outward occasion, that may be understood of the
sick person her self. Or if it come through sharp blood, then is the pain
sharp, pricking with great heat and ague. Or if it be caused through Phlegma,
then is the pain not too great, the place anguished, and impaireth slowly. If
there run any clear blood out of it with white corruption, then is there a
small vein broken in the impostume. If the matter be like water wherein fresh
flesh is washed, then is it a sign that this disease is caused through long
retentio^ of women's terms. If this impostume be caused of Cholera, then does
green matter run out of it. The signs of the canker have we discovered before.

In these kind of ulcers and cankers in the womb, do the learned prescribe
certain rules, whereof good heed is to be taken. First, in case this
vlceration be very moist, then are drying things to used for it. Secondly, if
there be with the ulcer a venomous quality adjoined, then is this the most
principal means of healing that the venomous quality may be taken away.
Thirdly, that such kind of meat and drink be used as do cleanse and make good
blood, which is most commodious for to cleanse the ulcers of the womb, for
thereby will the venomous matter be best of all taken away and drawn forth.
Fourthly, these ulcers have no need of maturatiues, for that thereby the
venomous matter increases. Fifthly, the Physician must use such things as do
dissolve and dry; and lastly, incarnatiues. Sixthly, if this ulcer can be
seen, then is the same to be refreshed with clean and fine clothes
continually.

And now to begin with some medicines: Heed must first of all be taken of a
good government of life, so that all that one does eat, drink, or use
(according to the ability of the patient, without the making of any heat) may
be drying things, and commonly such things be ordained for this purpose as are
warm in the first degree, but strongly drying. Quietness in this disease is
better than motion. Hereby may it easily be marked and understood that all cold
and moist meats be hurtful for this patient, viz. Fish, Crabs, milk, and all
that is dressed with milk, much pap, fat, and such like be naught for her. Their
most commodious drink shall be a thin, red, and hard wine, which is very
drying and discussiue: the same may be tempered with water wherein Mastick, two
kinds of Consolida (if so be that nature can abide it) and Feuerfew be
decocted. Secondly, concerning the other physic (if that nature may abide it)
the vein on the right foot is to be opened against evening, yet is good
regard to be had to the swouning, for that the letting of blood in the
neathermost parts do bring more debilitie with it than that of the upper parts.
After the letting of blood, this potion following is to be given unto her two
mornings together: Take Benedicta Laxatiua half an ounce, Agaricus one
scruple, Ginger and Grains, the juice of Feuerfew two ounces and a half,
temper them together, and afterward she is to govern her self even as the
order is after purging. Thirdly, give her this potion ensuing the space of
certain days together, until that the urine appear of a good color and
very clean: Take Oxymel of Squils half an ounce, Syrupus de Bysantijs and
sirupe of Vinegar, of each three quarters of an ounce, Louage and Agrimonie
water, of each one ounce, Cicory water two ounces, this is to be drunken early
in the morning: they may also sleep well upon it, and fast four hours after
it.

This being done, minister unto her Pillulas Benedictas four scruples, or one
dragme and a half, fourmed with the juice of Mugwort. You may also temper one
dragme of it with the foresaid water, and drink it: and if so be that the
cause require stronger remedies, then take Pillulas de Opopanaco and de Hiera
composita, of each half a dragme: make pills thereof as is beforesaid. With
this purging one must diligently have regard whether this ulcer or canker be so
near in the neck of the Matrix that one may come to it with the hand,
likewise if the matter do stink, to the end that according to the quality
thereof might be known what medicines should be used: but be it howsoever it
will, Honey water is always good for it. You may also cleanse the disease
therewith where the ulcer is, and afterward spread thereon this salve
following: Take Aloe, Dragonblood, Mirrha, Sarcocolla, and Frankincense, of
each a like quantity, Duckes grease as much as is needful for to make a mild
unguent of it. But this following is stronger: Take oil of Feuerfew flowers
and of Saffron, of each half an ounce, oil of Walflowers (especially if there
be great pain with it) two ounces, Sarcocolla, Mirrha, and Opopanacum, of each
one dragme, Turpentine three quarters of an ounce, Muscus one grain, white
wax as much as is needful for a salve: afterward sees them all together in
four ounces of the juice of Smallage until all the juice be consumed, then
anoint therewith a pessary made of cotton, and put it into the place, and
refresh it oftentimes: it is very commodious for it, and found oftentimes good.
But if this disease be very deep inwardly, then does need require that the
body be cleansed with necessary things, to wit, with Honey water, and
afterward use the pessaries which be described in the fifth Chapter and 2..
beginning thus: Take Duckes grease, etc. and renew them four or five times a
day, or make this following: Take Smallage, Feuerfew, and Mugwort, all
together, or each alone, stamp them together, make a pessary thereof, and
anoint it with Hiera Picra. You may also take the juice of these foresaid
herbs, and make a cloth wet with it, and lay the same upon the back, the
hips, and on the hithermost part of the backbone. For iniection, this following
is ordained: Take Honey water, sees therein Ireos and Wormwood, or sees
Agrimonie in Barley water, and temper clarified Honey, or honey of Roses amongst
it. If so be that the cause require stronger remedies, then take six ounces of
wine, burnt Allume, Verdigrease, of each half a dragme, temper them together,
and let them stand so five hours, afterward iniect it. This following is also
good, and chiefly to dry the ulcers, and to draw them together: Take Gals,
Pomegranat pills and the blossoms, and Allume, let it sees together with a
little Agrimony: and if you think that there be any vein broken within the
ulcer, then temper somewhat of these things following with it, as Dragon blood,
Myrrh, Frankincense, fine Bolus, Saffron, Hartwort with Rose water, or with
Plantaine water.

A bath for the raines is very necessary for this purpose, whereto you may
prepare this following: Take Valerian roots, Mew, and roots of Smallage, of
each four handfuls, Mirrha and Opopanacum, of each one quarter of an ounce,
the roots of Yarrow four handfuls, sees them all in sufficient water, and
sit therein to the navel. Besides all this, there is another bath highly
commended, wherein the roots of wild Cucumbers be decocted. For this is also
very good that which is described in the 12.. beginning thus, Take oil of
Centory 6. ounces, etc. But in case this ensuing matter remain stinking, and
that there be heat with it, then use the other pessaries made of cotton and
Roses, that are there discovered: but the ulcers must be cleansed before by the
iniection of Honey water. Lastly, if so be that the hardness do continue, which
may be perceived by feeling, as also by the pricking, by the pain, and by
issuing out of the matter, then is one to beware that there be no sharp
medicines used for it, for that thereby the malady will be much the rather
augmented, for all which is discovered in the fifth Chapter and second. of the
iniection of the muscilage of Fleawort, and juice of Housleeke, for that is
also the liver vein to be opened, and the salve of Ceruse to be used. This
person must also beware of all which augmenteth melancholy, whereof you may
find a sufficient discourse in the eleventh Chapter and 8..

Of an unnatural birth, called Mola.. 14.
IT chances also sometimes, that in certain women which have no company with
a man, yet their belly swells up no otherwise than as though they were with
child, and all the signs of being with child agree also with it, for that
their Terms be absent and stayed: they feel also some stirring in the Matrix,
their breasts will be hard, the appetite of meat leaves them, their natural
color will be pale, all which signs are common to women with child:
notwithstanding they bear no child which bear this Mola. This Mola grows
after two sorts in the womb: the one will grow to a piece of flesh without any
figure, half putrified, and is also no right flesh, but rather a spongeous
mass of wind, of water, and of some other superfluous blood, which through the
accustomed terms cannot be expelled, and the same then being mixed with the
natural seed, grows otherwhiles to such a hardness that the same cannot be
cleft asunder with any hatchet. Secondly, it may also be engendered of the said
blood and the concourse of certain tough humors, and so make a false show like
women with child.

Nevertheless the expert Physicians do distinguish three several signs,
whereby bearing women, and they that be burdened with this unnatural mass,
are to be known, for that first the moving of this Mola or unnatural mass is
not like that of a child, because it is a thing which has no life. Secondly,
the belly of women which bear Mola is much harder, and not so moveable from
one place to another as theirs is that be with child. Thirdly, this mass
falls from the one side to the other. Fourthly, if a woman be burdened with
Mola, then be her hands and feet very feeble and limber, and it seems also
that her fingers be shorter, all which cannot be perceived in bearing women.
Fifthly, the woman that bears Mola, is not so merry as one that is with child.
Sixthly, a woman with child is commonly after nine months delivered: but in the
Mola is no certain time, for that it is found that women therewith have gone
two years, four years, and also longer, yea their whole life time, that no
physic has helped them. And from these that be cured, there auoydeth
oftentimes (as is said) a loathsome piece of flesh, and that with such pain as
if she were delivered of a child. It auoydeth sometimes into blood, otherwhiles
to wind, and their belly falls away as before. This is such an accident, that
it ought not slightly to be regarded, for that thereby it may easily be marked
that the Matrix is utterly unclean and spoiled: therefore do these women
easily fall again into the foresaid maladies; or if not, into an unnatural
flux, ulcer, or impostume of the Matrix. Lastly, they commonly fall into the
Dropsies, Aseites or Tympanites, or into some other perilous sickness,
whereof they die. Nevertheless must the Physician not doubt of the cure, but
as soon as he knows certainly that the woman be burdened with a Mola, and
be not rightly with child, then is the woman to be commanded that the stir
not too much, and lie for the most upon the back, and with her legs higher
than the body, and to constrain her self otherwhiles to vomit and parbrake,
and refrain from all cold and moist meats, for which this potion following is
to be made: Take S. John's wort, Sauine, Rosemary, field Mints, and corn Mints,
Louage, Mugwort, Penniroyall and Mather, of each one handful, Fennel,
Squinant, both kinds of Parsley seed, Calmus and wild Galingall, of each one
dragme, Radish four ounces, sees them together in a sufficient quantity of
water for a potion, and use thereof every day three or four ounces, this
potion melloweth that mass, and expels the humor whereby it might be
increased.

There is also to be tempered with this potion one of these Trociskes
following: Take Cinnamome, Myrrh, of each two dragmes and a half, Rue,
Sauine, field Mints, Penniroyall (al together dried) Mather, Sagapenum and
Opopanacum, of each one dragme, Cardamome, Juniper tree, Rosemary, of each one
dragme and a half, form the Trociskes of the weight of a quarter of an ounce.
This before described is so to be used the space of ten days or more.

Other do advise for a thing of smaller importance, to wit, that the woman two
months every morning early should take three ounces of warm Feuerfew water,
and to fast four hours at least after it.

Secondly, that she every fourth day when she drinks of the water, should
take one of these pills: Take Galbanum one quarter of an ounce, flowers of
Mugwort, Saint John's wort, and Asarabacca, of each one scruple, dissolve the
Gum in good Wine, and make thereof six pills of a dragme. She is also to
purge once in fourteen days with three quarters of an ounce of Benedicta
Laxatiua tempered with two ounces of Feuerfew water. Or if she had rather
pills, that she swallow one dragme of Pillulas Foetidas. Fourthly, she is
always to wear this plaster following upon the belly the breadth of a finger
beneath the navel reaching up toward the hips: Take Galbanum one ounce and a
half, Galliae Muscatae one quarter of an ounce, Alipta Muscata one dragme,
white Wax three dragmes, dissolve the gum in good wine, and then make a soft
plaster thereof.

Fifthly, she is to use this bath ensuing for the raines thrice a week, twice a
day: Take Galliae Muscatae one quarter of an ounce, Colophoniae half an ounce,
Saint John's wort flowers, Betony, Mugwort, and Feuerfew, of each three
handfuls, Bistorta five handfuls, sees them together in sufficient water
until it savor well: she is to sit therein up to the navel. These be very
excellent remedies for to bring the mother to good health again, to strengthen
all the parts of generation, and to ease their maladies.

In fine, all those things may be used for this intent, which are prescribed
for the expulsion of the dead child out of the mothers body, and for the
secundine, and such like things more.

What commonly is good and profitable for the Matrix.. 15.
ELecampane roots, the greater Pimpernell roots, the roots of Eryngus, and
Ginger, all preserved, conserues of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of Spikenard, of
Lauender, and of Pionie, wine of Elecampane roots, of Auence, of Betonie, and
of Rosemary. The oils are these, oil of Lillies, of Rue, and of Bays. Item,
the juice of Gentian and of other roots which are described in the twelfth
Chapter and 11..

We have now almost written of all especial accidents and diseases of the
womb, whereon naturally depends the whole state of humane generation. But if
so be that this part of the body be not sound, and without all infirmities,
then is the humane seed (be it as commodious as it will) neither rightly
conceived, nor duly contained; and though it be received and contained, yet
does either a mischance follow after it, or at the least a feeble and weak
birth. Unfruitfulness ensues also thereby, as we very largely have showed in
the seventh Chapter before, so that it seems not to stand without reason,
that many Philosophers and learned men have disputed and concluded. By what
means this part once infected might be eased and prepared to fruitfulness, to
which end it was first created, whereof, as also of the conception of fruitful
women, of their infirmities, of their delivery, and of all that concerns
them, shall be spoken in this Chapter following.

The twentieth Chapter. Of all that concerns fruitful and childbearing women.
WHen as in women (as oftentimes has been said) this vessel of conception is
by their terms well cleansed and freed of their forementioned and all other
diseases, or if some disease now present can be remedied, then need not any
one in this place take care for barrenness. What might move their terms, is
sufficiently showed before in the seventh Chapter, yet notwithstanding we
purpose here to speak of diverse things which are very commodiuos for
conception: amongst which the first is sirupe prepared as follows: Take
Madder, Mugwort, Sauine, of each half a handful, Mints, Wormwood, Fennel
roots, Squinant, Marierom, Calmus, Nep, Annis, of each half an ounce, Cloves,
Buglosse flowers, and Balm flowers, of each three dragmes, Cypers roots,
Galingall, Fennel, Ameos, and Siluermountaine, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Cinnamome and Raisins, of each five dragmes, Honey as much as is
needful: sees them all together, and make a sirupe thereof, as has bin
taught in the first part, the fifth chapter, and 6.. Lastly, put unto it
Masticke, Ginger, Mace, Cloves, scraped Iuorie, Saffron, Nutmegs, Doronicum,
Zeduary and Basil, of each half a dragme, and beat them all together small.

The second is a powder which they may use with their meat: Take Nutmegs,
Cucubes, and Ginger, of each half a dragme, long pepper, Mastick and Cinnamom,
of each one dragme, Galingal two scruples, the seeds of the Ash tree, scraped
Iuory, Siluermountaine, red and white Behen, of each one scruple, beat them
small, and mix them all together.

The third is this salve following, Gallia Muscata, Nutmegs, Beuercod, Hares
rennet, and Laudanum, of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of Spikenard, oil
of Masticke, and oil of Mirtles, of each three dragmes, Wax as much as is
needful for a salve, anoint the place of the mother with it every other day.
The last is a confection prepared as follows: Take wild yellow Rape seed, and
tame Rape seed, scraped Iuorie, white and red Behen, Siluermountaine, and
seeds of the Ash, of each half a dragme, Cinnamome, Doronicum, Mace, Cloves,
Galingal, long pepper, Rosemary flowers, Balsam wood, Blattae Bisantiae,
Penniroyall, and Marierom gentle, of each two scruples, Balm, Buglosse, Citron
pills, of each one scruple, Indy Spica, Ambra, and pearls, of each half a
scruple, these being mixed and powned all together very small, take eight
ounces of sugar or somewhat more, sees it in Malmsey, and make an electuary or
tabulates of it.

To know whether a woman be with child or no.. 1.
WHen a woman has layen with a man, if that her places after the action be
dry, the Labra and sides of the same smaller and harder, then is it a sign
that she retains the received seed, and (if the same pass not from her in
seven days) she remains with child. Item, take Lettice, sees it in water,
and let her drink three or four ounces of that decoction, if so be that she
parbrake the same up again, then has she conceived. Take a steel needle,
stick it in a new wooden dish, and let the woman make water in it, if there
hang a little cloud at the needle, then is she with child. Or let her drink
Meade fasting, if so be that she vomit the same up again she will prove with
child. Another: Take Mace one quarter of an ounce, Saffron beaten small one
drag, well water sixteen ounces, Honey two spoonfuls, boil them all together as
long as you would boil an egg hard, let her drink the third part thereof when
she goes to bed, and continue it the space of three days together; if so be
that thereby she get not her terms, then is she undoubtedly with child: which
of these thou may best believe, experience will teach thee.

The common signs that a woman has conceived, be these, to wit, when her
terms without ague and cold be stayed, for then the blood is divided three
manner of ways, the subtillest does feed the fruit, the middlemost does by
certain veins pass toward the breasts for a preparation of the milk, the
grossest remains in the Matrix which will be expelled in and after the
delivery. Item, when a woman is conceived, then does she find great wambling
and distemperature in the stomach, inappetencie to meat, vomiting, with other
symptoms more, as has been showed in the former Chapter, the 14.. of Mola.
She finds also commonly the tenth day great headache, giddiness, and
darkness of the eyes.

It is also said, if a woman perceive immediately after she has layen with a
man small pain and cold about the raines, that it is a sure sign of
conception.

To know whether a woman be with child of a Boy or a Girl.. 2.
ALbeit there be diverse signs whether a woman be conceived of a Boy or a
Girl, yet are they not so sure that one may steadfastly believe them: for
example, it is adjudged that those women which bear a boy, have the right
breast sooner hard and round than the left, but experience teaches the
contrary, and so it is with all the other signs; wherefore it seems
superfluous to spend any time in this behalf: but because we are now come to
the conception of mankind, we will speak of the symptoms and signs which are
perceived in the women with child.

Of those things which commonly appear in women with child.. 3.
THose that have conceived a man child, are for the most part better of color,
lustier, nimbler of their joints, and less troubled in the bearing than of a
maiden child: they have also a better appetite to their meat; they do feel
the most burden in the right side, in which place they also perceive the first
motion and stirring of the child: the pulses be on the right side more stronger
and swifter than on the left. When they rise from sitting, then do the lift up
themselves with the right hand; the right eye looks more lively than the
left, and in going they commonly set their right foot forwards. But when they
bear a maiden child, then judge all the foresaid signs to the contrary, they
are paler, leaner, more pensive, and more troubled in the bearing. The man
child stirs lower in the mothers body, and (as the common opinion is) most
of all in the right side. The legs and places do otherwhiles swell. It is
also affirmed, that if milk be dropped on her urine, it should swim on the
top. Likewise if she bear a son, then perceives she on the 40. day the
milk to come into her breasts with a kind of tickling. And when she is with
child with a daughter, she finds the same about the 90. day. Aristotle
nevertheless acknowledges, and diverse more, that this (as we have said
before) is not always certain, but with the motion in the right or left sides
of a man or maiden child it seldom happens to the contrary, as may appear in
beasts, which at one time commonly do bear two young ones, as Goats, Sheep,
etc.

At what time and in what manner the child grows in the womb.. 4.
ALbeit this concern no Physic, but is rather a work of nature than any
part of our science, yet does our method require that we should show in what
time, and also how the child does increase and grow in his mothers body.
First, there is also (as has been said before) a great difference between
boys and girls, to wit, the man child receives both form and life much
sooner than the maiden child; yet the perfect fashioning of a man or maiden
child is in manner as follows. In the first six days the seed does swell
like to a bladder full of wind, or a windy egg, nine days after that does
this bladder draw blood unto it, whereby in twelve days the liver, the heart
and the brains are so evidently formed, that they severally may be seen and
perceived about the 27. day. It is called of the Grecians Embryo or Foetus,
that is, a fruit, whereof afterward a perfect man is formed; the other
members are fashioned within 18. days following, so that the sum of all this
time amounts to 4^. days, in which space the life is for the most part also
received, although the child (by reason of his weakness) seem rather to be
still than to move even to the 90. day. When as now unto this number which
makes in all 135. days, is added as much more, then (says Hippocrates) you
have the true time of the birth, which is just nine months, counting thirty
days for every month: but as we have said before, al things are longer
deferred with a girl than with a boy, for they commonly be not borne before
the tenth month.

Secondly, some suppose that if a man child be borne in the seventh month (as
it otherwhiles befalls) that the fruit was perfectly formed at the first in 30.
days, and began to live and move in the 40. But a maiden child borne in the 7.
month receives her perfection in 35. days, and begins to stir about the
60. day, and both of them are perfected in a 100. days: but a man child which
has been borne until the ninth month, that gets his perfect form in 45.
days, and stirs about the 100. day, is borne into the world about the 300.
day. But the maiden children are fully fashioned about the 60. day, they stir
about the fourscore day, and are brought into the world about the 279. day.
The cause why men children are sooner fashioned in the mothers womb, is,
because the seed and the right side wherein they be conceived are hotter.

Thirdly, we read, that in the first month the conception should be naught
else but a collection of blood, in the second month a forming of the body, in
the third month a perfect body, in the fourth month the nails do grow, in
the fifth month it gets the perfect signs of a man or a woman child, in the
sixth month do the veins begin to appear, in the seventh month does the
marrow grow in the bones, in the eight month are the bones hardened and
strengthened, in the ninth moves does it get a full proportion of man or
woman, and prepares it self for birth. Albertus Magnus in the ninth book and
fifth Chapter De Animalibus, shows diverse more divisions of the kinds, and
concludes with these words following: That which the Physicians do write of
this matter, is not sufficiently approved: and they are not always found to
speak the truth. These are the words of the foresaid Albertus. Now that this
is true, appears by the difference of the foresaid computations. It differs
also sometimes according to the health and debilitie of the parent, whereby the
fruit of necessity is governed, and is brought into the world sooner or
later; wherefore it may justly be said, that in this matter no certainty may
be found.

The order of diet for women with child.. 5.
WHen God has endued a woman with his gracious blessing, that in the state of
wedlock she should conceive with child, then let her take heed that she cast
not away the gift of God voluntarily by some great misdiet, but that she
acknowledge the goodness of God, and live in such sort, that by her diet the
conceived fruit be not only not harmed, but cherished and strengthened, and
fall not into any mishap or mischance whatsoever. To this end we will at this
present prescribe certain rules: first, a woman conceived shall always
contend to be loose in body, for the which she is to eat every morning before
breakfast some ripe stued Prunes, especially if she be bound. Also she is to
beware of all manner of needless labor, of leaping, dancing, vomiting,
coughing, much venery, and especially presently after meals: also of great
sorrow, frighting, fear, anger, and such like. Neither may she bathe her
self, unless it were some few days before her childbirth, for then is it
very commodious, as hereafter shall be showed more at large. All manner of cold,
all kind of stenches, all sharp and bitter meats, as Capers, unripe Olives,
Radishes, French beans, Lupins, red pease, Rue, white water Mints,
Penniroyall, and whatsoever else might provoke her terms, is hurtful to her.

Contrariwise, she may use all manner of wholesome accustomed meats, and drink
good red wine, or meetly strong Beer, for the red wine is meeter for her than
the white. Item, ripe fruits that are somewhat astringent, and that do
strengthen the stomach, are very meet for her, as Quinces, Pears, etc. if
she desire any other commodious meat, she shall not so strictly be kept from
it, but that she may use a little of it at once. But if so be that she do long
for some unnatural and unaccustomed meat, then is she to be dealt withal as
hereafter in this next. that be showed.

For to strengthen her, serves the warm confection of Diamargariton, for it
comfort the stomach and the Matrix. For the same purpose serves also this
wine following, a little draught otherwhiles taken of it: Take Ginger and
Cloves, of each one drag. roots of Louage, Spikenard, white pepper, of each
half a dragme, Comin, Galingall, Annis seeds, of each half an ounce, red
Wine three pints, Sugar as much as you please, make Hipocras. If the woman be
hot by nature, then do lay that wine with the decoction of Currants: what she
ought to observe beside this, may you find every where in the discourse of
conceived women.

Of the strange longing of women with child.. 6.
ALbeit that this disease of this unnatural appetite, which otherwhiles
happens to women with child, of some foul or unusual meats, as Chalk,
Coals, Lime, earth, Tar, raw flesh, fish, and such like, which is sometimes
rather an imagination, and an idle or vain conceit of some untoward women:
nevertheless the Philosophers do allege a certain natural cause thereof,
and affirm therewith, that this unnatural lust does also come sometimes upon
them which be not with child, yea also that men be otherwhiles plagued with it,
although very seldom: wherefore this longing (by good reason) may also be
reckoned amongst the unnatural hungers, and may be called a corrupting, as we
before in the eleventh Chapter have moved somewhat thereof, and have always
hitherto determimed to write somewhat thereof. This unnatural longing do the
Greeks call Cittam, the Latinists Picam and Malaciam, that is, a desire of bad
meat, and is thus described.

Citta is a bad action of the stomach, wherein the party is greedy to eat
unnatural and foul things. The causes of this unnatural desire, are very bad
humors, and especially Melancholia, which lies in the stomach, where the same
is excitating this unnatural longing. In women with child, the matter of the
terms does cause it which comes into the stomach: and because the same is of
sundry natures, therefore do they also get diverse lusts. But in those that be
not with child, it does come through retention of the terms, when those humors
happen to ascend into the neck of the stomach, or by the obstruction of the
liver or the milt, whereby the said melancholicke humor does stir up this
unnatural longing. The same bad melancholic humors may also be burnt in the
stomach, as may appear in the quartaine ague.

And for to remedy this disease (especially in women with child) must first
heed be taken to their meat and drink. Roasted Lamb, Hens, Pullets,
Partridges, and all kind of field fowls are very meet for her: yea also
otherwhiles buckes brains and sheep brains, whether they be roasted or sod.
Her drink shall be good white wine.

After meat shall she eat roasted Pears, Hasell nuts, Marmalade, confected
Pomegranats, and Chestnuts. Give her also oftentimes Marmalade with spices,
which you shall find described in the last part. Of the confection Diantha is
every morning about half a quarter of an ounce to be used. Item, give her
oftentimes the Syrupum de Montha. In like manner is good for her the Mina of
Quinces, temper them both as much as you please, and take three spoonefuls
thereof before meat. It is also much advised for this woman that she must
otherwhiles incline her self to parbrake and vomit, as with clear warm water
and sirupe of Vinegar, whereof we will hereafter speak more at large, because
that women conceived are much addicted unto it. But in case that they incline
themselves to vomit, then is their stomach to be anointed with this salve
following.

Take Masticke and oil of Spike, of each a like quantity, Vinegar a little;
lay this plaster following upon it, the flowers of Buglosse, of Baulme, of
Saunders, Citron pills, of each a like quantity, with oil of Masticke and wax
wrought together: or a bag made of the foresaid, except the oil of Masticke
and wax, and so laid upon the neck of the stomach. But if it happen that
they at any time desired that which might nourish them, and that they were
detained from it, or that the same could not be gotten, whereby it came to
pass that they were disquieted or vexed, then take presently a spoonefull of
Honey, scrape a little Nutmeg in it, and so give it her.

If so be that any man or woman (being not with child) were taken with such
unnatural lust, they are to take these things following fasting, as Oxymel
compositum two ounces with water of Cipers roots, or the decoction of
Cardamome, or take one ounce and a half of Oxymel of squils with the foresaid
water: afterward to provoke vomit are they to use this Honey water following,
wherein Mustard seed, the seed of Orage, of Dill, Onions, and Radishes is
decocted. For to purge, take Pillulas Stomachicas, or de quinque generibus
Mirobalanorum, which you will, one dragme: whereupon these confections
following are to be used, viz. Diapliris, Diamoschu, and Diambra. The stomach
is to be strengthened with these things following: Take Acorne cups one quarter
of an ounce, Raisins with their stones seven dragmes, Annis three dragmes,
Mirobalani Indici, Bellirici, Emblici, of each five dragms, prepared refuse of
iron one ounce and a quarter, four quarts of wine which is somewhat strong,
and as much water: sees them all together unto the half, and then strain it
through a cloth, and let the patient drink it out now and then in the space of
eight days.

Item, take Cardamome, Grains, Cucubes, of each a like quantity, white Sugar
as much as all the rest: give thereof every morning one dragme and a half with
lukewarm water, afterward use the foresaid confections, and anoint the
stomach, and keep your self with eating and drinking like as is said before.

Of the vomiting in women with child.. 7.
WIth this vomiting are commonly women with child oppressed, until that they
do begin to feel the milk, and about the time they were wont to get their
flowers, or when the child's hair begins to grow, then have they it most
grievous. Also it is the more troublesome, for that as then all strange lusts
do come unto them. Nevertheless it oftentimes happens not long after they have
conceived, that they as then are most inclined unto it. It is also otherwhiles
commodious for them, as we have showed before.

But if so be that it do get the mastery, and that thereby the food be drawn
away from the fruit, then must one do his best for to strengthen the stomach
and to remedy the vomiting: for which there be many remedies in the eleventh
chapter and eleventh. described against the debilitie of the stomach, out of
which may easily be chosen what is meet for women with child, but especially
these things following be advised for safe things, as the sirupe of Raspes,
Marmalade, and sirupe of Quinces, which the ancient Physicians do so highly
commend, if a woman with child do use the same much, then will the fruit be
subtiller and whiter, Annis, Fennel, Coriander, whether they be confected or
not, are good against vomiting. Item, take a hard sodden egg, and keep it
very warm upon the mouth of the stomach. For this is also passing good the
sirupe of Veriuice.

When a child is weak in his mothers womb.. 8.
FOrasmuch as there is no doubt that the conceived children be also sick in
their mothers body, therefore it is no small question how they are to be
helped. For seeing all sicknesses are known through feeling and sight, the
which cannot be done by children in their mothers womb, for this cause this
matter is troublesome to the Physicians. But amongst other signs whereby it
may be known, whether the child be sick in his mothers body or no, it is the
very certainest if that the woman with child have her terms oftentimes and
much: for that there can follow none other thereof but a debilitie of the
child, because that his sustenance and nourishment is taken and drawn from him.

Secondly, when the milk runs from women with child, then is it a sure
token of the debilitie of the child: also that the child is not strong enough
for to draw his nourishment unto it.

Thirdly, if a woman do get a strong scouring, then is it much to be doubted of
a mischance, but it depends specially on two things, under which al other
accidents (be they how they will) are contained, which is heat and cold, by
which all the rest may easily be adjudged.

First (for to write of the debilitie of the child through heat and dryth) is
the mother to be purged of Cholera, viz. with this following, and such like:
Take conserve of Prunes without any other addition half an ounce, warm whay
of milk three ounces, give it unto her in the morning betimes, and let her
fast upon it the space of five hours. Or take prepared Cassie one ounce with
four ounces of Sorrel water or Barley water.

If you will have it stronger: Take two ounces of Manna, temper them together
in three or four ounces of whay, and use it as before. Or if you will you may
steep in the former a dragme of Rubarbe, and wring it out well; or half a
dragme of Rubarbe beaten to powder given without steeping. All these medicines
be very safe for the child and the mother.

Concerning the order of diet, it is to be cooling and moistening, as with
Lettice, Beetes, etc. like as is oftentimes admonished.

Also Barley water and Barley paps are to be used, the fresh is to be dressed with
vinegar and veriuice, with the juice of Limons, and such like that she eats.

Afterward she is to drink every morning a good draught of whay in summer
cold, and in winter warm. Or take water of Endive and of Violets, of each two
ounces. Or if you will have that which cools more, take sirupe of Roses and
of Endive, of each half an ounce, Succorie water two ounces, temper them
together. These things following are yet more forcible than the former: Take
sirupe of Vinegar half an ounce, sirupe of Citrons one ounce, Buglosse water
and water of Sorrel, of each one ounce and a half, temper them all together.
You may also drink one ounce of the conserve of Violets, tempered with three
ounces of Endive water.

The clisters with those things which force urine and blood, and also all
things which cause vomiting must be forborne. But if it be needful that one
purge more, then shall the former suffice. But these three things are
especially to be shunned.

One must also do his best for to defend and resist all bad properties, and to
strengthen the same, which may be done in this manner following, to wit, that
the woman every day three or four times do drink half an ounce of the sirupe
of Limons with Barley water, it cools and quenches thirst. Item, take water
of Citruls and of Violets, of each six ounces, water of Sorrel twelve ounces,
red Saunders, Roses, burnt Iuorie, and seed of Sorrel, of each one scruple,
Saffron half a scruple, Vinegar three spoonefuls, temper them all together,
and make a cloth wet therein; afterward lay it beneath on the priuities, and
behind on the rump. Also take then one ounce of small cut Pompeon peeles, oil
of Roses, and of water Lillies, of each one ounce and a half, small fresh
Housleeke one ounce, temper them all well together, and anoint the foresaid
places with it three or four times a day.

But if this debilitie do come through cold and moisture, then is this thus to
be remedied: Take Buglosse water, the seeds of wild Saffron, gross beaten
Agaricus, and Hermodactils, of each one scruple, Cinnamom, Ginger, Roses, and
prepared Coriander, of each four grains, let them steep together one whole
night, afterward wring it out, and drink it in the morning early.

Another. Take the water of Feuerfew and of Balm, of each one ounce and a
half, Benedicta Laxatiua one ounce, white sugar half an ounce, temper them
together, and let them stand the whole night, afterward strain it through a
cloth, and use it as the other.

For this is also a good order of diet to be observed, wherefore these patients
are to use nothing else but that is warm and dry of nature. And she is to
boil in all her meats Sage, Mints, Rosemary, and such like, which have no
nature of opening. Their drink is to be meetly strong red wine tempered with a
little steeled water; for it has power to strengthen all the inward norishing
parts, and all veins.

One must also devise how to amend and cleanse these bad humors, which is thus
to be effected: Take Sage water four ounces, Miua of Quinces one ounce, then
mix them all together. Item, take Sirupum de Myrto one ounce, water of Baulme
wherein Masticke is decocted, three ounces, temper them together, and so give
it her to drink.

A better. Take Miua Citoniorum aromatica one ounce, water wherein Myrtle seed
is decocted three ounces, temper them to a potion. There may also be used in
the morning early for a strengthening, half an ounce of confected Calmus.
Likewise Aromaticum rosatum, Rosata nouella, and conserve of Roses tempered
with powder of Masticke, and with Mints water being drunken.

If it be needful for to purge, then is one to use the former purgations
without giving any stronger thing. This ensuing is also very commodious: Take
the juice of red Mints four ounces, Agaricus one dragme, let it steep
together two days and two nights, then temper Ginger and Roses therewith, of
each four grains, Manna half an ounce, let it stand drying in the warmth,
afterward make pills thereof, and use them oftentimes, for they purge the
watery humors without any anguish.

Now for to remedy the venomous matter, for which you have hereafter three
kinds of applications: Take Roses, Cipers nuts, burnt Iuorie, and Sandaraca, of
each one dragme, Rosin three ounces, but you are to sees the Rosin in red
Vinegar until that the Vinegar be spent: afterward temper the other
ingredients amongst it, and make two plasters of it, one quarter and a half
of a yard long, and lay the one behind and the other before upon the place of
the Mother.

One more forcible: Take oil of Quinces, of Roses, and of Mints, of each one
ounce and a half, Comfrey, Bloodstone, red Coral, Sandaraca, and burnt Date
stones, of each one dragme, Wax as much as is needful for a salve, anoint
therewith the place of the Mother and of the kidneyes: both these have so
strengthened the fruit in sundry women, that they have fully borne the same,
which accustomed to lie in too soon of all their former children.

Thirdly, take the water of Tassell and water of Knotgrasse, of each six
ounces, water of green Cipers nuts, or their decoction, four ounces, the
juice of Sloes, burnt Iuorie, and Roses, of each one dragme, Frankincense,
Sandaraca, and Colophonie, of each one dragme and a half, the juice of Quinces
six ounces, temper them well, and make a cloth wet therein eight double, and
so lay it warm upon the back.

Of mischances or untimely birthes.. 9.
THis untimely childbirth or mischance, may befall at any time without any
difference after that women have conceived: as when the seed is not yet come
to any perfect shape, or when the fruit has some members, but yet before it
come to be a perfect child, or is brought into the world before the due time,
being not thoroughly borne, or when it is violently or otherwise expelled. And
it fares therewith as it does with the fruits of trees, when they begin first
to bud and to fashion, then do they hang on brittle stalks, so that
otherwhiles they may be blown off and spoiled with a small wind: but being
waxen greater, then is there to come greater force of winds or otherwise
before they will fall off: lastly, when they be waxen very ripe and seasonable,
then do they fall off of themselves. In like manner does it also happen with
the conceived seed or fruit, which is at the first so weak and tender, that
if a woman chance to leap, to fall, or to labor hard, the seed received is
thereby diverse times eiected. Wherefore also between four and seven months
she may purge most safely, and use physic if need require: for before the
four and after the seven months must she forbear it (if possibly it may be)
for then it is perilous.

But to return to our purpose. We have showed before, that if a woman has
retained humane seed the space of seven days, that it is a token of
conception: but if it vade or avoid within seven days, then do the learned
call it Effluxionem, which is an effluence or running out. But if so be that
they detain it any longer time, and this effluence chance within forty days,
then is it an Abortus, that is, a mischance: and within this time of forty
days, do most mischances happen. Thus if a boy be conceived, and void away
within forty days, then is there none other shape to be seen thereof, but in
case it be cast into cold water, there does it make show as a small bladder,
and making it open, then is the fruit found in it as a great Cricket, with all
his several members, and likewise also the humane member. And if a maiden
child conceived chance to avoid or pass away within three months, then can
no direction or token be seen, for that it consumes in the water: but in case
that it do come to the fourth month, then may some direction be seen thereby,
but it soon consumes and passes away: for that (as we have said before) the
girls receive their perfect fashion much later than the boys, as also they be
borne for the most part in the tenth month. But when they be now come both
into the world, the girls grow much faster than the boys, and also do come
sooner to their time of generation, and leave off much sooner, especially they
that get many children one after another.

The causes of these mischances or untimely births, do the learned allege to
be of many sorts, which may nevertheless be comprehended in four principal
articles, viz. of outward causes which proceed of the conceived fruit, when
the Matrix has any kind of disease; or if the humane seed be of no good
disposition. Amongst outward causes be these, leaping, running, wringing, and
chiefly in lying together, bathes, anger, sorrow, fear, trembling, loud
calling, strong labor, surfeiting of meat, and diureticall things, as
Fennel, Parsley seed, and all other things which expel the stone. All hot
spices, as Ginger, Galingall, Cinnamome, Annis, and such like. Item, all that
purges violently, as Aloe, Epithymus, Coloquint, Scamony, and Euphorbium. In
like manner all scouring or laxes, the bloody flixe, or the flux of the terms.

The same may also happen if a woman have any strange lust or longing, which
she cannot come at or get it, and more other such like causes, whereof we have
spoken before, whereof it is better to be silent than to disclose the same.

Also the conceived fruit otherwhiles falls downwards before her limited
time, whether it be for that it is sick or dead, or for that it remains not
with the face toward the back, with the hands upon the eyes, and the elbowes
upon the knees, as the natural situation of it is.

Likewise also if the fruit through any disease of the parents, be infected
whether in the seed or otherwise, wherewith also the fourth cause is approved.
But if the conceived seed find any disease in the Matrix (be it whatsoever
sickness or disease that it will) then must the fruit inherit it.

This reason following is also occasion of an untimely birth, to wit, when a
woman is much and unmeasurable lean, conceiving she will very seldom have
full birth: but if the Mother be exceeding lean (whence the fruit must suck
or draw his nourishment) then will it be infeebled or diseased, and constrained
to pass away, as hereafter shall be more ampler said and taught.

Women which be meetly fat or lean, and nevertheless get a mischance every
third or fourth month that comes (beside the former causes) of some slimie
waterish humors which fall down into the veins and sinews, whereon the
secundine is fastened, whereby they do slack, are loose, and can sustain the
burden no longer, without falling out of the mothers body.

By the breasts may also a mischance be perceived, for that when they be small,
weak and flack in women with child, then is a mischance to be looked for and
expected. When a child begins to come to his perfection, then has it need
of much nourishment. And if there be any disease or infirmity there, then will
the breasts be small, soft, and slack, whereof the fruit must pine and die. Or
she will be impatient, strives and strugleth so long until the secundine
breaks, and the fruit falls away.

Now if a woman be pregnant with two children, and one breast only (whether it
be the left or right) came to be small and slack, then is it a sign of the
destruction of the child on the same side.

It is also found that certain women through stench of the snuffing of a
candle or lamp, have gotten a mischance. Let this suffice of the mischance or
untimely birth: we will now teach how the same is to be remedied.

How a mischance is to be prevented or hindered.. 10.
WE have before showed that women conceived sometimes do get their terms,
whereby that weak and spare, yea also dead children be brought into the world,
which happens not without great peril of their life: wherefore must we writs
and discourse somewhat thereof.

First, the terms do commonly come with pain of the backbone, of the belly,
and the priuities, which be altogether signs of a mischance to come: for (like
as we have said) thereby is the nourishment drawn away from the fruit;
whereby it is not only infeebled, but also urged to pass away.

And to obuiate or prevent this, all childbearing women are first to beware
from ouerhote, cold, and ouermoist air. All meat and drink which be too fat,
too sharp, and to bitter, shall she also eschew, as Radishes, Parsley,
Smallage, Fennel, Pease broth, Cinnamome, Saffron, Galingall, Nutmegs, and
such like spices. She is also to use oftentimes thick red wine, but she is to
eschew all great exercise of going, running, leaping, accompany of a man,
anger, and all ouerburthening: and therewith have regard that she always have
a soluble body, and if so be that be wanting, then is she to use some meat or
drink which do loose the body, as the decoction of Mallows, or Mercury, or
stewed Prunes.

Otherwise she is to leave all clisters and other diureticall medicines. But if
the body be obstructed too much, then is she to eat Cassie wood out of the
pipes, or new prepared Cassie, and that especially if she have any issue or
moistness in the neck of the Matrix; for that the Cassie does cleanse the
Cholera and Phlegma without any trouble: you are also in due time to put
Rubarbe, unto it; yet Manna is more commended for it: powned Rubarb is also to
be given to conceived women as it is; for so it is more effectual than if she
took the infusion only.

Item, if so be that there appear in the neck of the Mother some sliminesse
or moistness in the last month, then is she to use all things roasted, baked,
and to do such exercises before meat as shall be drying: also take Pomegranate
peeles, powne them gross, and sees them in oil of Lillies, and iniect that
into the Mother. That is the right mean for to stay the slipperinesse of the
Matrix.

Afterward take Masticke, Mirrha, and Gallia Muscata, of each half a dragme,
Goosegrease one ounce, dip therein vnkemmed sheep wool, and put it into the
places. Hares rennet, or the rennet of any other beast is marvelous good for
it, whether there be any heat or impostume instant.

Burnt Iuorie and the powder of Zeduarie tempered together and strowed on the
meat does stay also the mischance.

To this end is also to be seen what is written before in the ninth Chapter
and third. of the excessive terms, all which is also meet for this use.

But she may use these things following, as the confection of Pearls, of which
Auicenna describes always to eat one tabulate before meat, and thereupon to
drink a good draught of wine, as she may do it very commodiously between both
meale-tides twice or thrice a day.

Secondly, take the water of Mints, of Daisies, and water wherein Cipers nuts
be decocted, of each one ounce, Sugar half an ounce; drink this early in the
morning all together at one draught, whether it be cold or warm.

Thirdly, take scrapt Iuorie, red and white Coral, Masticke, Mints, the inward
red peeles of Chestnuts, Acornes, Myrtle seed, and Cypers nuts, of each half a
dragme: make pills thereof with the juice of Comfrey, whereof three are to be
taken in the morning with the foresaid water before meat, and that afterward
she has taken one of the foresaid tabulats.

Fourthly, take Cipers nuts, powned Gals, Myrtle seed, juice of Sloes and
Hypocistis, of each half a dragme, Bloodstone, Amber, Dragonblood, and fine
Bolus, of each one dragme and a half, refuse of Iron which has been long
decocted in vinegar, half an ounce, the innermost red peeles of Chestnuts one
ounce, three or four whites of eggs, powne all that is to be powned, and rub it
all together a long time in a leaden mortar, then anoint therewith the whole
belly from the navel to the priuities four times a day.

Fifthly, make this plaster ensuing: Take Dragagant and Gum, both of them
roasted, and Bdellium, of each one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Sloes,
Frankincense, Hypocistis and Sandaraca. of each one dragme, fine Bolus and
Dragonblood, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax half an ounce, Paperglew
dissolved in red vinegar two ounces, make a plaster thereof, and lay upon the
priuities, let it lie so, and if the same must be taken off for any certain
cause, then lay it on again by and by: and if there be too little Wax and
oil of Masticke, then take as much as is needful of it.

Another. Take Frankincense, Masticke, Dragonblood and fine Bolus, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Comin three dragmes, Pitch one ounce and a half, three
small Cypers nuts, Wax and oil of Masticke, as much as is needful for to
make a plaster: spread them on a cloth, and use it as is said before.

Make also this salve following: Take oil of Nuts four ounces, Barrowes
grease one ounce and a half, three small Cipers nuts, Masticke one dragme and
a half, let them sees softly the space of five hours, and therewith anoint
the place of the Matrix, which is between the nauel and the priuities, and
behind upon the back over against it.

It is also written, that it is wonderful good to wear always a Diamond on
the finger.

Item, if a woman with child be burdened with an Ague, and that a mischance be
doubted, then take Barley meal, the juice of Sloes and of Housleeke, as much
as you please, make it to a plaster with vinegar, and then lay it oftentimes
upon the belly: this plaster does defend the fruit from all accidents in the
Ague; this said plaster is also to be laid upon the liver. In case that now
the woman with child be assailed with pricking, then have you before in the
second part, the fourth Chapter, and 12.. how that might be remedied: stamped
Crabs, the juice thereof wroong out, and tempered amongst woman's milk; it
defends also the untimely birth of women, and it is said that it is a sure
remedy for it.

If so be that a mischance be feared through much wind, then give one dragme of
good Mithridate with the water wherein Comin has been decocted, twice a week;
for thereby will the fruit be preserved and retained.

These confections or tabulats following are to be used: Take Pearls and
Pyretrum, of each one dragme, Ginger, Mastick, of each half an ounce, Zeduary,
Doronicum, the seed of Smallage, Cassie wood, Cardamome, Nutmegs, Mace and
Cinnamome, of each one quarter of an ounce, red and white Behen, long and black
Pepper, of each three dragmes, Saffron one dragme, sugar eighteen ounces or
less, decocted with the water of Buglosse, or water of Mints.

How a dead child is to be expelled out of his mothers womb.. 11.
FOr this we will first have remembered all that is described before in the 19.
chapter and 14.. of the unnatural excrescence Mola in the Matrix, whereof that
in the second. of provoking the terms, and before of the mischances, and all
that is discovered of the preferring of the birth, is also meet for the
expulsion or delivery of a child; so that between these is none other
difference than that this following is ordained rather for perfect children, of
which women do commonly lie in within five or six months. Now for to prevent
the same, are these remedies following commanded to be presently used, but
first of all you must know whether the child be dead or not, to the end there
be not a sick child expelled for a dead child: the which is to be known by
this, and especially if it has been dead two or three days. First, the mother
does get a great pain in the sinews of the eyes, which be Optici nerui.
Secondly, she does also feel pain behind in the neck stretching downward
along the back bone, because that the Matrix is fastened unto it. Thirdly,
she does feel great anguish and pain beneath. Fourthly, if a woman lie from
one side unto another, then does the burden always follow toward the lower
side, which is of all other a sure token of a dead child, and that the
ligaments of the secundine have no more force to hold the dead fruit in one
place. Fifthly, there is a great pain about the priuities, and over all the
neck of the Matrix. Sixthly, the thickness of the belly which was above is
wholly sunken down. Seventhly, they do feel continually a cold about the
priuities. Eighthly, if one hold a warm hand long upon the belly and feel no
stirring, then it is a sure token that the child is dead. These be now the
signs of a dead child before it begin to putrify.

When it has been dead three days, then begins it to stink; the woman is
full of agues and gets a stinking breath; out of the Matrix runs a foul
stinking matter; the belly will be heavy, and stinking winds, which do arise in
the mother, cause swelling thereof: and last of all there will be foul and
stinking pieces of flesh expelled through the neck of the mother. When al
these things be seen, then has a Physician none other thing to do but to
drive out the dead child. It is also needful before all other things to
preserve and strengthen the heart from al filthy stenches, which may be brought
to pass with this powder following, taking the same oftentimes with broths,
for that it strengthens the vital spirits, and also the heart: it does also
withstand the ascending vapors.

Take white Diptamus one dragme and a half, Citron peeles, and the peeled seeds
of the same, of each half a dragme, prepared pearls four scruples, prepared
Coriander one scruple, Roses two scruples, sugar two ounces and a half: temper
them all together to powder, and use thereof about one quarter of an ounce at
once. Or take this following: Take white Diptamus and Zeduary, of each one
scruple, prepared Pearls, and Species de gemmis frigidis, of each half a
dragme, mix them together, and give it her to drink at thrice, it
withstandeth all stenches that they infect not the heart. The fine Treacle does
also drive dead children out of the mothers bodies.

In like manner also the juice of Verueine, or the herb stamped and drunken
with wine, drives forth also the dead fruit: so does Hyssope also.

Take Trociscos de Gallia one dragme, give it with small white wine, they
expel the dead child and the secundine, and make an easy birth. Item, take
the innermost skins of the mawes of Hens or of Capons, wash the same in wine,
dry them, and powne them to powder, give one dragme, or one dragme and a half
thereof with a draught of Wine, or with some broth, or with Rosewater. Or take
Betonie and Rue with the roots, of each one handful, pour thereto one ounce
of the juice of Salomons seal, white Wine one pint; let it sees well, then
strain it through a cloth, and so give it her to drink. Sees Juniper berries
in Honey, temper some wine with it, and so drink it together. Another: Woman's
milk drunken should also expel the dead child: likewise also the precious
stone Iaspis. This is a common medicine which follows hereafter: Take Boreas
one dragme and a half, Cinnamom and Saffron, of each one scruple, stamp them
together, and give it with sweet wine or Mugwort water to drink, it helps
much to bear easily.

It is also said, that Linseed passes all things to make women to be easily
delivered, for if they drink the water which is decocted therewith, and put
the same with clothes beneath into the body, or bath therein, then must the
dead fruit avoid. Or take Mirrha as much as the quantity of a hasell nut,
stamp it, and give it with wine, or with water of Mugwort: the same expels
much, whether that the child be dead or alive. The same does also dogs milk
tempered with honey. Item, take one ounce of Goats milk, dissolve therein two
scruples of Galbanum, and so give it: it expels maruellously. Or if the
woman be strong, then give her as much of the juice of Garlic as will go into
half an egshel with wine or honey. If from a woman through frighting or
otherwise the child avoid, then take a Crab, stamp it, and wring out the
juice, and then temper it with the water of Mugwort, and so drink it.

For pills: Take Trociscos de Mirrha one scruple, Galbanum half a scruple, make
five pills thereof with Penniroyall water. Another: Take the fruit of the Sauine
tree one quarter of an ounce, Assa foetida, Ammoniacum and Madder, of each
half a dragme: make eleven pills thereof, then take thereof at each time one,
and that thrice a day.

For to use outwardly, take these things following: fume the woman beneath with
the horn of the Asses foot, which has an hidden nature for to expel the
fruit: but if so be that one can get no horn of the Asses foot, then is horn
of a horses foot to be burnt. The same operation has also the seed of
Basilicum, if it be fumed and received beneath: likewise also the fume of
Laudanum: or take Mirrha, Galbanum, and Beuercod, of each a like quantity.

One may also hold before the priuities swines bread, or cotton wool made wet
in the juice of the same: and to put it before into the body is also
marvelous good for this purpose. Item, take black Hellebore, Licebane,
Hartwort, Coloquint and Ammoniacum, of each one quarter of an ounce, Ox galls
one ounce; the gum is to be dissolved in the water of Mugwort, afterward
temper the rest sodden well amongst it. Or take Opopanacum and Hartwort, of
each a like quantity, and make a plaster thereof with the juice of Mugwort: if
it be too soft, then put a little wax unto it, and so lay it warm upon it.

Out of all these forementioned things may you also make pessaries, and put
them into the body before. For this is also good the plaster de Galbano,
whereof there be two kinds in the nineteenth chapter, third. Another: Take
vnkemmed sheep wool, spread butter and honey upon it, and apply it. Some do
advise to hold a Snakes skin to the priuities, for they say when it begins
to warm, that nature will cause the dead fruit to follow presently.

For this are also bathes prepared: Take Mints ten handfuls, sees it in
sufficient water, and sit therein up to the navel: this works maruellously,
especially if thereupon be used the juice of Swines bread as is before said:
likewise does also drive out a dead child, the plaster de Radicibus laid upon
it, and the decoction of Garlic.

A preparatiue for an easy childbirth and delivery.. 12.
AL creatures have their certain time of bearing except a woman only, for
that women may be delivered of a child in the seventh or eighth month, also in
the ninth and tenth month, as we have sufficiently written before: yea, it
has bin also found that they have deferred both to the eleventh month, and
also sometimes to the twelfth month. It is also read of a woman that happened to
lie in of child in the thirteenth month after that she had conceived: yet it
oftentimes comes to pass that they be deceived in their reckoning; therefore
it is not needful to dispute much of the time, for when the Pear is ripe (as
is commonly said) then does it fall off. Our purpose is here only to discourse
and show, through what means a fruitful woman is to be prepared, for to bear
easily and with small pain. For because that on the child birth depends the
maintenance of humane kind, and that women in their child birth are to expect
all sundry mishaps, therefore have many famous Physicians thought thereon, and
diligently studied, how fruitful women might be prepared unto their child
birth, and therefore have described these notable means: first, how the
obstruction is to be opened, and how the pains are to be provoked. Afterward
if a child in necessity of birth, or delivery chance to die, how the same
shall be expelled, whereof also has been spoken in the former 11.. and of
other accidents more which are to be expected after child birth.

When as now the time of childbirth is at hand, and that a woman is almost past
her reckning, then is she to eat and drink well without excess, and to use
such meats which might nourish well: viz. good Mutton, Veale, Hens, and
Capons: all kind of field Fowls, eggs, good brothes, with spices, as with
Cinnamom, Saffron, etc, and to drink good wine. But she must especially take
care, that she always have an open body: therewith she is to bath certain
days together in this bath following: Take Hollihock roots with the leaves
two M. Mallows and Betony of each one M. Mugwoort, Marioram, Mints and
Cammomill, of each half a M. gross beaten Linseede two M. make two bags
thereof, and sees them in a great kettle with water: afterward let it be
meetly cold, and then set the woman in it; the one bag must lie behind upon her
back, and she must sit upon the other, or hold it upon the Navel. After
bathing, take oil of sweet Almonds, of Lillies, and of Violets, of each half
an ounce, Linseede, Hollihocke roots, Fenegreeke, Butter, and Hens grease, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Quince kernels, and Dragagant, of each one ounce,
you are to stamp the seeds, and cut the roots: afterward sees all together
in rain water, and take out the muscilage, temper the same with oil, then let
the powned Dragagant and Hens grease sees so long until the muscilage be
consumed, and then make a salve of it: with this salve are you to anoint warm
beneath the whole back, both the sides, and all the whole belly, even to the
priuities.

Another: Take oil of sweet Almonds, of Lillies, and of Violets, of each half
an ounce, Ducks and Hens grease, of each three dragmes, white Wax as much as
is needful: but if these salues cannot be gotten, then is oil of Lillies
alone to be used in their stead.

Also this ensuing may be prepared: Take the muscilage of Linseede, and of
Hollihock roots, fresh Butter, the grease of Hens, of Geese, and of Ducks; oil
of Lillies, and of sweet Almonds, of each half an ounce; let them melt by the
fire, and temper it well together. Or take Hollihock roots with the leaves one
handful, cut it small; Venice soap one ounce and a half, and one pot of good
fresh Beer, let it sees together unto the half, then will there be a Salve
of it: with this foresaid salve is a woman to be anointed about her priuities
five or six weeks before her time, every day after bathing. These and such
like means do open and soften the obstructions of the matrix: so that thereby
in necessity of birth, the throws will not be so great, nor yet any thing
like so painful.

When as now the time of childbirth and the throws be instant: then may one
choose of these things following, that which according to the importance of the
cause is supposed to be most requisite, first of all outwardly. There be
sundry famous Physicians which account it greatly auailable to hold certain
things before the priuities, or bind the hippe, with many strange ceremonies
mo, which are therewith to be used. But if these kind of things happen without
misbeliefe, and that amendment be found thereby, then may they be taken for
approved. Amongst the same things which seem also to be like unto the truth,
are Agrimonie with the roots holden before the Matrix, and immediately after
birth to cast it away, to the end that the Matrix be not drawn down. Also
Swines bread bounden upon the thighs. Item: ^endane roots, roots of
Polypodie, and of Bistorta, should also be very good for it: but what the
Loadstone, Smaragde, the Eagles head, and Coral, (and chiefly if with the end
wherewith it has stood fast, it shall be turned toward the Matrix) may well
help for childbirth: I cannot comprehend nor understand it: therefore each one
may hold and censure the same as he list. That which follows hereafter, is
more like to be true. Take the roots of Polypodie, and Mallows, of each one
handful, cut them small and sees them very mellow, and lay them warm upon
the priuities: put also as much Mugwoort unto it, whereof a woman shall
presently fall in labor, and after delivery, it is immediately to be taken
away. The common people do commend to lay pouned Bayberries upon the navel.
For to further birth thereby, to take inwardly is much praised in time of this
great need, the rinds of Cassie, the uttermost being black scraped off, the
weight of three quarters of an ounce, and beaten very small, given to women with
red Wine, or with the decoction of red Pease. Item: Saffron drunk with Wine,
helps also much to very speedy birth, and to diminishing of the pain. The
same does also Cinamom drunk with wine. Item, take Boreas and Cassie pipes
scraped well, stamp them very small, and temper them, and give thereof one
dragme, or one dragme and a half, it is very forcible. There is also good for
this that which is described in the 19. Chapter and 2.. for preferment of the
Terms, like as is also that which is discovered for the expulsion of a dead
child. Item, take Honey one spoonful, put two spoonfuls of water unto it, and
give it to drink: Fenegreeke decocted with Honey is also very good for it: in
like sort do the common people commend for it very highly the decoction of red
Pease, or Cicers drunken. Take also Beuercod, Asarabacca, of each one dragme
powned small, and give it with the decoction of red Peason. In this manner also
may be used the seed of Siluermountaine.

This ensuing is commended for a forcible and sure powder meet for this
purpose. Take good Cinnamom and Myrrh, of each half a dragme, give it with
small white Wine, it is especial good if a woman have once sneezed, or has
once vomited.

Take Cinnamom one dragme, Saffron half a dragme, Cassie wood, and scraped
Cassie pipes, of each two scruples; stamp it very small, and give it four or
five times with the decoction of red Pease: Or take Myrrh, Beuercod, red
Storax, of each half a scruple, Cinnamom, and Sauin tree, of each half a
scruple, give it so unto women to drink, or make pills thereof: this is
commended above all other things, as this also following, is: Take Myrrha,
roots of Costus, and red Storax, of each half a dragme, Ammoniacum, Sauin
tree, of each half a dragme; stamp them very small, and give it three or four
times with the decoction of red Pease: of this also may you make pills.

For this is also good Triphera magna one dragme, or one dragme and a half,
for it makes women not unfruitful, as some women do falsely report, but does
advance fruitfulnes. Some do advise, when a woman is past her time, that her
mother vein or Saphaea upon the foot is to be opened, for that the birth will
thereby be the easier, and it cleanses also the child, but how far this is
from the opinion of the ancient Physicians, we have sufficiently declared
before. Other do advise to sees a Swallows nest in water, and strain it
through a cloth, and then to take four ounces thereof, it will accelerate the
birth. The fume also of a Mules fell, of Comin, of Colewoort stalks, of Myrrh,
of Myrtle, of Steeres gall (which one will) received beneath, but above all
Beuercod, and Assa foetida. Some say, that one should give one spoonful or
twain of the juice of Sloes, and allege also therewith, that it is not to be
taken but when a child is ready to be delivered. But we have here many better
and most apparent things.

When the throws do not continue in bearing women.. 13.
ALl that has a strong odoriferous savor, as Muscus, and such like, is to be
kept from women with child, and to be taken away, for that it does hold back
the throws, and hinders the birth or delivery. But for to advance birth,
take Betonie three handfuls, Mugwoort one handful, Cammomill, Penniroyall, and
Hyssops, of each one handful, Linseede grossly beaten two handfuls, cut all
the herbs and fill a bag with it, let it sees well in wine and water. This
being done, then foment with this decoction the priuities with a sponge five or
six times, afterward annoint the place with the oil of Wal-flowers into the
neck of the mother, if so be that the same can be conveniently done by the
Midwife, whereby the woman will be stronger, and the birth be advanced,
especially if the child be rightly placed.

And if so be that this will not yet help, then make this potion following,
and give her thereof a good draught every two hours: Take Betonie one handful,
Mugwoort, Penniroyall, and Hyssope of each half a handful, a pint of Rhenish
wine, or somewhat more: let them sees together until about the fourth part be
consumed: strain it, wring it out, and put unto it half a dragme of Saffron.
Amongst each draught is to be put half a dragme of this powder following: Take
of the black scraped Cassie pipes one dragme, and make a subtle powder
thereof, in like sort have you yet more before. This following will be also much
commended: take white beaten Amber half a drag. and give it with the water of
Lillies, or with the decoction of red pease: it quickens mightily the
throws. It does also chance sometimes that the throws do avoid at the mouth:
for which, take three or four skeanes of boiled warm linen ya^^e, and let
the woman with child receive this vapor: for thereby will the throws fall
downwards: every one may conceive thereof what he list, it is very like a
gross medicine for clownes.

Of the perilous and hard Child birth in general.. 14.
IT is known to all the world more than sufficiently, how hard and sour that
some women lie in labor, before that they can avoid the child and secundine;
so that it happens otherwhiles that young and strong women do die with the
fruit. These perils have many occasions, so that otherwhiles the women
themselves, or the child be a cause thereof. Such anguish may also proceed
otherwhiles from the Matrix, or from the neck of the same. In like manner the
same may be well caused through some obstruction of the Matrix, or through any
other disease, as an impostume and such like, in the foresaid parts: this also
may be brought to pass through the rudeness and vnhandsomnesse of the
Midwife. When as these foresaid reasons be declared, then may the cause easily
be adjudged of this grievous and perilous child birth.

If the disease be of the woman, then has she had a great former sickness, or
she is diseased through hunger: she may be also too young, and have conceived
before the due age: or she may be too old, or not have borne before at any
time, in which the places will be hardly opened: also if a woman be dismayed,
or never wont to bear child, be also too fat of body, and is ouercooled, then
can she hardly be delivered of the child. Secondly, the fruit it self may cause
also a grievous labor, like as is said (yet without foundation) that boys be
easier borne into the world than girls. Item, if the child be too gross of
body or head, and therewith be very small and weak, that through his
feebleness it cannot help it self to the birth. Item, if the child be dead,
have two heads, or the like double members. Item, if the child with his hands
and feet, and not with the head, does lie in the birth place like as behooves,
and as is natural. Further, the Matrix may be by nature too narrow or too
dry, so that with no moisture the passage can be made slipperie. Item, if the
woman before in the neck of the matrix have had any exulceration, whereby the
muskles could not stretch abroad, or that as yet there be some ulcer in the
neck of the mother: or if it comes by the secundine, then is the same so
thick and so strong, that it will not break. This grievous and very hard
labor may also be caused by the stopping of the body.

If now this heavy labor do proceed of the forementioned diseases, sicknesses,
hunger and such like outward causes, that may be very well perceived of the
woman. The signs of a feeble or dead child are to be found in the 8. and 11..
But if there be of none of all these signs any instant, and if that a woman is
not strong, and that a child in delivery remain in the birth place, and
cannot be brought into the world, then is it a certain sign that the
afterbirth (like as is said) is too strong and not yet broken.

Thus be all perilous accidents of childbirth so joined to each other, that
all of them for the most part are cured with one kind of remedy, whereof we
have written much before. And because we have especially admonished here of the
secundine, therefore does our old order require, that we should also discourse
somewhat particularly thereof. But because nature observes this method, that it
first expels the child, and afterward the Secundina, which is the
secundine, therefore we will also first of all write perfectly of the child,
and afterward of the secundine, with all which is ordained for the same.
Lastly, we will show and declare all that is meet for both of them.

When a woman cannot be delivered of a child.. 15.
THe causes of this hard and longsome childbirth are before sufficiently
discovered: when as then a child appears with a hand or a foot before, which
does happen very seldom without swelling of the neck of the matrix, and of
the parts adjacent, then take Penniroyall, Mugwoort, and brown Betonie, of
each a like quantity, hack it all together, and let it sees in milk, lay it
then under her, before the birth, as warm as she may abide it, about the member
of the child, yt same drives away the swelling: or set seething water under
it, when the child feels the warmth, then does it draw the member back
again. This and the like things should Midwiues know, on whose knowledge and
experience, is very much depending, yt very renowned advice which is discovered
in the 13.. of Amber, when ye throws will not continue: also there is laid
unto it scraped Unicorns horn. Some be of opinion that first of all the woman
should take a spoonful of oil, with twice as much water. Other do also
advise, that one should sees half a drag. of Mace, and so give it: this
forces also ye secundine. If that then a child will not frame himself to birth
in his mothers womb, and nevertheless the throws and the right time of birth
be instant, then take a little Lilly water, and as much good Rhenish wine, and
so drink it together, it will frame it self the better afterward. For this is
also good the juice of Sloes, whereof we have spoken before. Another: Take
fresh well water, and honey as much as you please, temper them together without
seething or skumming, and so give it to drink, this quickneth the throws and
pain, so that she will be the sooner delivered of child, for that the pain
expels the child and the secundine. Or take the flowers of Cypers, sees
them in wine, and drink a good draught thereof, this should be very certain,
especially if the herb or flowers may be gotten fresh. Item, take well powned
Linseede, sees the same in wine, and give the woman a good draught thereof. In
like manner may she well drink wine, which is decocted with Plantaine. Wine
wherein Vine leaves have been steeped, should also expel birth. Boreas the
weight of half a drag. drunken with wine, is also very advancing for it, as we
have admonished before. A stronger: Take Saffron, and Pearls of each one
scrup. Boreas 4. scrup. give this also with honey water if the throws come not;
but if so be that the throws be instant, then give it with Mugwoort water, or
with sweet wine, it expels very swiftly. Now for to use outwardly may one
choose out of these things following for a time that which one will, as the
seeds of Garlic, Sauintree, Mugwoort, S. John's woort, Pigeon dung, the horn
of an Asses foot, or of a horses foot, Ox dung, Wormwood and Rue: of all
which tempered, or each alone: also to bathe, to make salues, plasters, and
such like. Item, take round Hartwoort, Aristologie, Sauin tree and Cresses, of
each a like, stamp and temper them all together with an Ox gall: then
afterward make a great taint moist therein, and put it before into the places,
it helps much to birth. This following does also expel a child whether it be
living or dead, and also the secundine very vehemently: Take Sauintree, round
Hartwort, Asarabacca, and Dragon roots, of each a like quantity, powne them
all together, and temper them with honey: afterward give to the woman thereof
the weight of one quarter of an ounce, with water wherein Lupins be decocted,
and if so be that this expel not sufficiently, then take Opopanacum, and Ox
gall, of each one quarter of an ounce, Beuercod one dragme, give it to the
woman to drink with water wherein the Sauintree and Fennel is decocted: and
although all these foresaid medicines be meet and convenient for to expel the
secundine with them, yet we will nevertheless in particular as we have
promised write, and discourse thereof.

Of the secundine or afterbirth, and how the same is to be expelled.. 16.
THis afterbirth do the Latinists call Secundinam, which is as much to say, as
the second, because it comes away after that she is delivered of child, and
of such like, wherefore it is by us properly called the afterbirth or
secundine. This foresaid afterbirth or secundine has this use, to wit, when
that in lying together both the seeds of the man and woman be tempered in the
Matrix, and become like unto milk, then comes about the same a caul or
velme, which grows by little and little with the fruit, and is augmented with
it. The same is by nature ordained, that the fruit may be therewith, as it
were with a cloth covered, enclosed about, guarded and defended, until the day
of the birth, which presently after the birth of the child (if all things
happen aright) does avoid; or remaining behind, it brings very great peril
with it, as we have said before, that amongst other accidents there do follow
agues, stinking breath, pain of the head, swouning and such like.

If in case then that these afterbirths do thereby tarry behind, for that a
woman is waxen too weary and feeble, through ye former hard labor, then must
somewhat be given her, whereby she may get some strength, and might comfort her
heart, as Diamargariton, Manus Christi, and Diapliris. She is also to be caused
to neese, and to hold in her breath, whereby the undermost parts of the belly be
pressed down, and stirred up to expel that which remains. And if so be that
the secundine will not follow, then let the woman rest a little, and anoint the
belly and al other parts about it with oil of Lillies, and oil of Elderne
flowers: also to keep the belly very warm, and then to use those things which
are specified in the delivery of children in the 11.. and also whatsoever
shall be prescribed hereafter. All those that esteem much of precious stones
do counsel, that when the afterbirth will not follow, that then to the woman
is to be given of the powder of the Aggat, and that thereupon the secundine
must follow. It is also commanded to the contrary, that whenever a woman is
in labor, that then she is to put away from her all manner of precious stones,
because that they do defer this childbirth. It is also said that corn
flowers given with Lilly water, do expel the secundine. We have also said
before, that half an Eg-shell full of the juice of Garlic given with Honey
water, does expel the dead child and afterbirth: but this advice may we leave
for country people. Neesing is also especial good for delivery and avoiding
of the afterbirth.

For to use outward things therefore is much commended to make a ley of ashes,
and to set the feet deep in them, they should draw the afterbirth downwards.
Item, take Beech ashes, and power seething water unto it, then let the vapor
ascend from beneath upwards, and the afterbirth will follow. Take Peacocks
feathers, or if you cannot get them, then take Hens feathers, kindle them, and
let the fume ascend from beneath.

Item, take Hollihocke roots, sees them very mellow, and then temper it with
Barrowes grease, with Goose grease, and therewith anoint the neck of the
Matrix within. This draws not only ye afterbirth but also all other
uncleanness: for this is also chiefly good whatsoever before is described for
the advancement and lightning of childbirth, and also for women's terms.

How that the afterthrowes are to be eased.. 17.
TAke Squinant and Spikenard, of each one quarter of an ounce, sees them
together with water of Mugwoort even to the half, and drink thereof two or
three times, it allayeth the pain. Item, take Malmsey, or some other good
wine, and make a candle thereof with the yolks of Eggs and Cinnamom. Or take
Saffron half a drag. Mace one scrup. Triphera magna half an ounce, take this
at two times with warm wine, for this Triphera has such power, that it does
presently assuage the pain. In like manner, this may be anointed in the neck
of the Matrix very commodiously. Further, you have before in the 19. Chapter
and 7.. of the pain of the Matrix through wind, of Triphera and Philonium, and
presently afterward a powder with Turbith. Also how this Hellebore is to be
used, all which things be very commodious for the afterthrowes.

Item, take small powned Woolblade, temper them as a dough, and bake cakes
thereof, and give it to the woman to eat. Take good fat Figs, cut them to
pieces, and gross beaten Fenegreeke, of each one handful; let them sees
together, and the woman to sit oftentimes over it, or to foment her beneath
with clothes. Item, take the yolks of Eggs, temper them with the juice of
Mugwoort, and bake cakes thereof, and lay them behind upon the back. The same
does also Hollihock roots, or the leaves, if it be beaten, and with warm wine
laid upon it, and oftentimes renewed.

For the excessive flood after birth.. 18.
FOr this you have before in the 19. Chapter 3.. of ye asswaging of the
excessive terms of women many kinds of remedies which be also very meet for
all women in childbed. Yet of the Physicians of Augusta be these following
ordained for very especial remedies: At the first are these women in childbed
(be it howsoever it will) to take with broth fasting one dragme of the same
powder with white Diptamus, that not long since has been described in the 11..
Afterward she is to use this costly confection: Take conserve of Roses one
ounce, conserve of Burrage, of Buglosse, and of Baulme, of each half an ounce
prepared Bolus half a drag. prepared Pearls one drag. good Cinnamom one drag.
and a half, temper them all together. Item, take conserve of Pionie, it
cleanses a woman after birth. Let her use also this powder following: Take
prepared Bolus one drag. Sealed earth 2. scru. Tormentill half a drag.
Shepherds purse one scrup. Species de gemmis frigidis one drag. and a half,
prepared Pearls one drag. Roses, Coral, and Saunders, of each one scrup.
Cinnamom two scrup. and a half, Sugar three ounces, temper them well together,
and take it with Henbroth. This following is yet more forcible in stanching:
Take Bloudstone washed with Plantaine water one dragme and a half, red Coral
one drag. Tormentill and Trociscos de spodio, of each half a dragme, scraped
Iuorie, and burnt Hearts horn, of each one scrup. prepared Pearls four
scruples, fine Bolus two scruples, Bursa Pastoris, and red Saunders, of each a
scrup. Cinnamom one dragme, Sugar six ounces, make a powder thereof or
losinges.

Of the superfluity of milk.. 19.
When as now a woman is delivered of Child, and that the milk so excessiuely
abounded and ran over that the child could not sufficiently suck or draw it
out, and it were to be feared that it might come thereby to clot or to
impostumate, then must good remedies be sought, to which end diverse be
described in the second part, the third Chapter and 5..

Of diverse other accidents after the birth.. 20.
IT happens many times that a woman after that she is delivered of child, her
legs and feet happen to swell. For this, take Wormwood, Cammomill, Centorie,
Yarrow, Southernwood, and Spikenard, of each a like quantity, sees it all
together to a bath for the feet, and use it oftentimes. In like manner you
have also before in the third Part and fifth Chapter, in the description of the
places in women and their accidents, diverse things which be meet for this
purpose. Item, take Cammomill and Linseede, of each one handful, put them in a
bag together, and sees them in wine, afterward lay it over the swelling.

Or take a great Onion, roast the same in ashes, afterward stamp it to a
grout, and make a plaster thereof with sufficient butter, and use it. These
two last things may also be laid upon the belly against the afterthrowes.

As much as then concerns the descension of the neck of the Matrix, the
unnatural heat, the ach, and such like accidents which women in childbed be
subject to, for that are diverse remedies to be found before in the description
of the places, nevertheless we will add somewhat more, and therewith conclude.

If so be that a woman with child come to be broken, then take Comfery four
handfuls, Self-heale one handful: sees them together for a bath for the
loins, and let her sit therein over the priuities.

Item, take a long piece of Allume, and put it into the body before, then
shall the rupture go together again, and the entrance will be so narrow as
ever it was before.

Or take two ounces of Coperas, four ounces of gals, one ounce and a half of
Gum, sees them together in sufficient rain water, and wash you therewith, but
this is none other but as it were a right writing Ink.

Look also further, the first Chapter of the third Part of the ruptures of the
nauel, and all that which shall be written of the ruptures, where one may choose
what seems best for every one.

The plaster Diachilon, whereof we have so oftentimes admonished, is thus to
be made: Take Fenegreeke, Linseede, and Hollihocke roots, of each four
ounces, sees them together, and draw out the muscilage, as in the first Part,
the third Chapter, and 7.. is taught: put thereto nine ounces of Sallad oil,
Litharge of gold three ounces, then sees them together again until the
muscilage be spent, and make a plaster thereof: this plaster m^llifieth all
hardness of the liver, of the milt, and stomach, and of all other parts.
There be also two sorts prepared, which are called Compositum, and Magnum,
which be both also more stronger than the former, but they be not so much in
use.

There has also oftentimes been spoken of the sirupe De radicib. the one
called of two kinds of roots, which is thus made: Take Parsley roots, and
Fennel roots, of each two ounces, let them sees in sufficient water,
afterward strain them through a cloth, and make a clarified sirupe thereof
with twelve ounces of Sugar.

The sirupe of five kinds of roots is prepared in this manner: Take the roots
of Smallage, of Fennel, of Parsley, of Ruscus, and of Sperage, of each one
ounce, sees them very mellow, and then make a sirupe thereof with twelve
ounces of Sugar. Both these kinds of sirupes be good against all kind of Agues
which proceed through putrefaction of phlegm and choler.

The fourth Part of this general Practice of Physic, does entreat of the
outward members.
ALthough the Physicians, and especially the Anatomists do comprehend all other
parts of man's body, which be not described in the former three parts of this
Practice of Physic, in this fourth Part; yet will we divide them into two
principal parts: that is, the Arms and Legs. These be the especiallest
outward parts, to wit, arms, hands, fingers, and nails: afterward the legs,
the thighs, the knees, the shins, the ankles, the feet and the toes. These be
now the diseases which be generally incident to both these parts. First, that
which the Physicians do call Gutta, and we the Gout, is divided into four
principal Chapters, according to the member which is infected with it, viz.
Arthritis, which is the right Gout: Chiragra, which is the Gout in the hands:
Ischia, the Sciaticke: lastly, Podagra the Gout of the feet. Of all which we
will orderly discourse and write, afterward of Eluxations, Elocations,
Extenuations, Bruises, and fractures of bones, and by what means each disease
is to be helped. Therefore will we in the name of God begin according to our
old custom and method, with the highest parts, which be the Arms, and what is
annexed unto them.

Of the Arms. Chap. 1.
. 1.
THese Arms be divided into three parts. First, they have their beginning at
the shoulder blade with the Armepits, reaching unto the Elbow. All which with
the other parts of the Arms be called by the Grecians and Latinists Brachium.
The second part reaches forth unto the hands and wrests of the arms: the
third part is ye hand unto the end of the fingers.

As much as concerns now the first two parts. They be subject unto all
outward and inward accidents or diseases; as bruises, fractures, wounds,
impostumations, eluxations, diseases of the veins, and of the sinews, and to
such like accidents mo. All which diseases (according to the quality of the
cause) are to be helped with letting of blood, salues, plasters, baths,
fomentations, etc. whereof in many places before, and also shortly hereafter in
the Gout and in the Sciatica shall be more ample declaration made: so that at
this present it is needless to write any further thereof.

Of the Armepits.. 2.
AS much as concerns this part of the arms, we have thereof sufficiently
spoken before, as also of the veins of the Armpits, and for what cause they
ought to be opened, has been sufficiently declared in the Introduction, we
will here discover and discourse of the loathsome stench of the armepits, and
chiefly in hot and fat folks: because that they have also much hair in this
place, and be moist of nature; and how nearer that the stench is to the nose,
so much the lothsomer is it. This stench is augmented through great labor at
hot times, through want of shifting and alteration of clothes, through great
incontinencie, and through some corrupted humors of the body. Which stench if
it do continue very long, it is a sure sign of an incident palsy.

Then for to remedy this stench, it is needful (according to the quality of
the person) that all such are to be purged and let blood, and that they
afterward do bath in these odoriferous herbs, as Mints, Melilot, Lauander,
Ireos, and such like.

This being done, the A^meholes and the whole body are to be fomented with
these things following: Take Annis, Comin, and Roses, of each 2 ounces, Cipers
roots one ounce, Spiknard, and Spica Romana, of each one quarter of an ounce,
powned Ireas one ounce: sees these all together in two quarts of water until
about a third part be consumed; and then use it warm with clothes wet therein,
and keep the body very clean with clothes and linen. Afterward use some of
these things following: Take the Litharge of gold one quarter of an ounce,
Allume one drag. Roses and Myrrh, of each half a drag. beat them all to
powder, and wash the Armpits with wine; and then strew the powder upon it: the
Litharge of gold does the same of it self tempered with Rosewater: in like
manner also the Myrrh. Item, take Coperas one ounce, sees the same in three
ounces of water, let it be cold, and anoint the stinking place with it. Take
Thistle leaves one handful, sees the same in a pint of wine and drink
thereof, it takes away the stench throughout the whole body.

Item, take litharge of gold one ounce, Frankincense half an ounce, powne all
together small when you go to bed, and temper a little thereof with wine, and
anoint therewith the place, and then in the morning wash it with Vinegar. You
may also use for this the oil of Spike.

And if so be that the humors then be so sharp that they excoriate the place
and bite open the skin, then wash it with warm water, and afterward strew the
place with burnt Allume.

Marmalade with spices does also expel all stench.

Of the hands.. 3.
ANaxagoras was wont to say, yt men above all creatures were most reasonable,
for that they only had hands. But Aristotle contrarieth this with great
reasons, and says, because that mankind is the most sharp witted amongst al
creatures, therefore has nature given him hands, which be none other than
instruments of a reasonable creature for to use them whereto he desires, so yt
these most noble and necessary members be made for to comprehend, to hold, to
cast, and to labor, etc. In like manner also through their feeling to adiudge
all that is hard, soft, hot, cold, thin, thick, and such like. Besides this,
in stead of all weapons wherewith all other beasts be endued, that they may
thereby seize upon all manner of weapons wherewith either in time of peace or
war to guard and defend the body. Item, with these hands be all renowned
feats and cunning, and also all hurtful works achieved and brought to pass,
as is daily seen. It appears also by daily experience, that commonly the
right side is more forcible and much nimbler than the left, not that it is so
in every body, or must be, for that it is oftentimes found to the contrary,
whether it be through the custom or otherwise, that some do most of all help
themselves with the left hand, and be much nimbler and actiuer with it.

Further, the hand is commonly divided into two parts, as the palm, the
fingers, and one may if he will account the nails with it. They be filled
every where full of sinews, wherewith they most commodiously and speedily be
ready to all manner of actions. Inwardly in the palm of the hand be many
kinds of lines or strakes seen, the which like as the Chiromantici do say, be
signs of good and bad luck or fortune, whereof we will not here write any
further, because that these Southsayers art is by many learned regarded as
lies, for that they have no foundation, therefore be they also justly to be
mocked and scorned, like as they be also taken and acknowledged of all upright
Christians to be ungodly, and adjudged to be an illusion of Satan. Thus may
this suffice of the Hands.

For to keep the hands clean.. 4.
IT becomes all men very well with honesty, that they have always clean
hands, and that chiefly when they sit at table, whether it be that they taste
any meat, or carue for others: and for to come unto it, the same are
oftentimes to be washed with fair water, and Venice soap. If you will make
them smell well, then look what is written thereof in the first Part, in the
first Chapter, and 2.. Or prepare in stead of the soap this ensuing: Take one
spoonful of Honey, two yolks of Eggs well brayed, and a little Rosewater, and
Lilly water* temper them, and sees them to pap, rub the hands therewith and
afterward wash it off with fair water.

Item, take the whites of Eggs well brayed, stir therein a little wheaten
flower, Rose water, and Orange peels powned small as much as you will. The
juice of Citrons is also very good for it: or if one cannot get it, then may
the juice of Limons or of Oranges be taken in stead of it. Let the same sees
alone in a glased pot, and stir it about continually. It is also especial
good against all itchinesse of the hands, and all other parts of the body.

Or take the water of Louage, and powned Argall, temper them together with the
white of an Egg, as much as you please of each, bray them well together, and
use them as before is specified.

For to make perfumed hands and gloves.. 5.
TAke clean Barrows grease as much as you please, and lay the same eight days
in water or in lie, putting every day fresh water or lie unto it, and wash it
well. Afterward five other days in fresh milk, washed also daily. Then after
that wring it out clean, and put it into a pot, and put Rose water unto it,
the water of Elderne flowers, of Plantaine, and of Lauander, of each a like
quantity. Afterward put odoriferous spices unto it, as Cloves, Cinnamon,
Nutmegs, and so let them sees together softly until the water be wasted away.
At the last you are to put unto it Muscus, Ambra, golden waters, or any other
well savoring things, stir them a long time well together. This salve is also
good for all scabbinesse and scurfe, etc.

For scabby Hands.. 6.
FOr this may the foresaid salve or Pomander be used which is described in the
first Part, the tenth Chapter, and first. For this is also very good the Gum of
Dragagant dissolved in Rosewater, and the hands rubbed with it.

It happens also many times that the hands be full of the dry scurfe, like
to that kind of itch which the Latinists do call Impetiginem: for which this
following is to be used, and not only for the hands, but also over the whole
body, where as is the dry scurffe. Open some eggs, put out the whites and
yolks, the egg shells are to be laid in a cool place where they will not be
bedusted, then will there gather amongst it a little water, which you are to
put into a little glass, and to anoint therewith the place that is scabby.

Item, sees Elecampane in the cream of milk, which is also very meet for
this purpose. Or sees these roots with Butter and Milk; and when they be
mellow and sodden to pappe, then temper some Salt amongst it, this is always
found to be very good. You have a sure salve for this before in the first Part,
the third Chapter, and tenth. beginning thus: Take Turpentine, etc. Some do
advise to take the lyuers of Tenthes, and to put the same in a glass stopped
tight and set in a warm place, and to anoint it with the water that comes
thereof. Item, the juice which is wrung out of Orange peeles, should be
marvelous good for this purpose.

Another: Take the oil of Juniper, and oil of Argall, anoint the hands with
it and all other scabbinesse.

For chops in the Hands.. 7.
TAke four ounces of Sallad oil, or oil of Roses, Wax one ounce; melt them
together and anoint the hands with it. Item: Take oil of Roses, white Wax,
Masticke, Frankincense, and Hens grease, of each a like quantity; powne all
that is to be powned, then temper them all together, and make a soft salve of
it.

For itchie or scabbie hands.. 8.
TAke three ounces of sweet Butter, Turpentine two ounces washed together
certain times with Vinegar; and then temper with it half an ounce of salt,
and three drag. of dry Ceruse. Item, take a good piece of Rye bread, laying it
the space of certain hours in fresh water until it be well mollified, then
wring it out through a course cloth, and wash your self therewith.

This following is also good and sure. Take Turpentine two ounces, fresh butter
one ounce, oil of Roses half an ounce, the juice of Limons or Oranges three
quarters of an ounce, and the white of an Egg well brayed, salt one dragme,
then temper them all together with a mild fire or upon warm ashes. If so be
that you will have it thicker, then put a little Wax unto it. Or take the
middlemost rinds of the Juniper tree, and Barrowes grease, of each a like much:
sees the same together in Goats milk, and salt it well.

Take the oil of Roses and liquid Storax, of each a like quantity, melt them
together: this is especial good, and has a good savor. Item, take fresh
Elecampane roots, Mallows Dock roots with the leaves, and Fumitory, of each
one handful: Branne one handful; sees them all together in three pints of
water unto the half, and therewith wash the hands. Or take Sulphur vife half
an ounce, small bruised Litharge of silver three dragmes, dried Ceruse one
quarter of an ounce, Barrowes grease one ounce, Camfere half a dragme, the
juice of Oranges half an ounce, temper them together and keep it in a glass.

With this following be many people helped whom nothing would help. Take the
roots of Dockes and Elecampane, of each one ounce, Cuckoopit and Comfery, of
each half an ounce, Agrimonie, Self-heale and broad Plantaine, of each one
handful, Vitrioll half an ounce, Allume and Sulphur vife, of each one ounce,
Saltpeter one quarter of an ounce, Roses one handful, Pomegranate pills half a
handful, wine and water, of each one quart, sharp Vinegar twelve ounces; let
it be all together infused, and then afterward boil it: in which are the
hands to be bathed every morning and evening the space of six days. And
afterward be the hands to be moistened with a cloth dipped in this decoction
following: Take washed Ceruse one dragme and a half, Allume, white Coperas, and
Masticke, of each two scruples, Camfere half a dragme: this being all beaten
small together, then bind it in a fine cloth, afterward steep it in two
ounces of Rosewater, and four ounces of Plantaine water, whereof we have
admonished before and taught in the former 6..

As much as now concerns all itch or scurfe, thereof we will by Gods help
speak sufficiently in the fifth part.

Of the Fingers.. 9.
IN the last 6.. we have generally written of the hands: but now will we think
upon the fingers, which be called by the Grecians Dactyli, and by the Latinists
Digiti, by nature have all men five on each hand: Othersome six which be
therefore called by the Latinists Sedigiti. The first of these is the Thumb,
which is called the greatest and smallest; but by reason of his shortness is he
verily the smallest, but by reason of his thicknes and strength is he indeed
the greatest, and therewithal so forcible, that he is a helper to the rest of
the fingers, that without the same they be very impotent, because that he lying
above ye fingers in holding fast, shuts them up. This have also the most
cruel tyrants acknowledged, who commanded to chop off the Captives thumbes
and not their hands, to the end that they might not handle their weapon, nor do
any other labor. The first finger afterward is called the forefinger, in
Latin Index, that we do therewith show and point at all things. The third do
we name by reason of his place, the middlemost, which the Latinists partly call
Infamem: the cause of this name will we conceal at this present. The fourth is
the gold finger or Anularis, for that commonly the same is wont to be garnished
and decked with gold rings. Lastly follows the small or ear finger. These
five fingers have fifteen bones, each three; albeit some do ascribe to ye
thumb but two bones. Through these bones and moving of the sinews, these
fingers have two small joints, amongst which the thumb has no more but one:
all which bend only inwards, whereby they be meet for all cunning and subtle
actions. But what mischances and diseases these parts be subject to, we will now
write and discourse thereof.

Of the numbnesse of the fingers in part or in all.. 10.
THis numbnes brings with it a hardening of the sinews, and is caused
through heat, cold, or drith: this numbnesse must be helped immediately, or the
fingers will forthwith lose their motion thereby. For this disease must be kept
especially a good diet, and first of all are cold windy dwellings to be
eschued, and the whole body, chiefly the hands and the feet to be kept very
warm, and then to refrain from all gross binding and cooling meats, as old
Beef, Skins, Paunches and Sinews of all beasts. Item, all that is dressed with
dough, all fish, and especially Eeles, Tenches, and Crabs must he refrain. He
must also forbear Milk, Cheese, and all old baked bread: from all kind of
Beans, and from cold herbs, as Lettice, Purslaine, Beets, Pears, and such
like, red gross thick wine is also not good for him: and if it be possible he
is utterly to refrain wine, whether it be drunken watered or vnwatered. Also
he is not to ouercharge himself with meat or drink at any hand. And he is
above all to beware of Vinegar, and from all sour things. Also long sleep is
hurtful for him, and especially sleep by day; otherwise he may live according
to his old custom.

As much as concerns the use of Physic, he may take of these pills following
four or five every day two hours always before supper, and to continue this
a certain space: Take Aloe two ounces, steep it two days in the water of
blew Flower-deluce, Agaricus, and Turbith, of each one dragme and a half,
Hermodactyli one quarter of an ounce, Mastick one scruple, Ginger, Annis,
Cinnamom, and Mace of each half a scruple, Diagridij two scruples, then powned
all small temper them together, and fashion six pills of each dragme.

Secondly, take oil of Myrtles, and of Masticke, of each one ounce and a
half, burnt Iuory, Amber, red Coral, and Sandaraca, of each one dragme,
Masticke, Frankincense, of each half a dragme, Paper glue three quarters of an
ounce, Dragagant and Gum, of each half a dragme, dissolve the glue in strong
red vinegar, with half an ounce of Wax. When it is almost cold, then temper
the other spices with it, and make a tough salve of it, that it may be spread
on leather, lay it within upon the bending of the hand, and round about the
thumb.

Thirdly, take a piece of a Millstone, let it be thorough hot, lay it in a
great pan and besprinkle it with good Wine and sharp Vinegar tempered
together: and do this so long until there be about twelve ounces powered upon
it. Over this vapor be the hands to be holden being well covered, to the end
that they may sweat well; afterward dry them. This is to be done ounce every
morning, and afterward to bind up the hands in a piece of Furre.

Fourthly, take oil of Camelina, and of sweet Almonds, of each two ounces,
Calves marrow, Badgers grease, Ducks grease, of each one ounce, Bdcllium half
an ounce, Galbanum one ounce and a quarter, Saffron half a drag. dissolve the
gum in white Vinegar, and then make a soft salve of it with Wax: with this
salve are you to anoint all the hands and fingers morning and evening.

Fifthly, take one ounce of the gum of a Cherrie tree, Beuercod and Galbanum, of
each one quarter of an ounce, Sallad oil six ounces, Calves marrow, Goose
grease, and Hens grease, of each one ounce, white Wax one ounce and a half,
Saffron two scruples, Lignum Aloes half a dragme, and Muscus two grains:
dissolve the Gum in white Vinegar, and temper the fat amongst it. Last of
all, put all the other things beaten small unto it. When as the patient has
used all these foresaid fomentations, salues, and plasters, the space often or
twelve days, then are the hands to be anointed with the first described salve.

When the Fingers be numbed through bruises.. 11.
THis cure or healing is commonly committed to the Chirurgians: but if the
sinews be not utterly chopped off, then is there still some hope of health. Now
for to remedy this, the patient is (like as is said already) to keep himself
soberly, and to beware of much Wine, of Vinegar, and Venery. From stirring the
bruised hand too much, and not to wash them with cold water; but is to use
these fomentations following: Take a piece of a Millstone, make it very hot,
and put unto it as is before said, then cover the hands very warm. This being
done, then are they to be anointed with this salve being made very warm: Take
oil of B^hen, of Costus, and ye suet or fat of a Lion, or in stead thereof man's
grease, the fat of a Beuer of each five ounces, Saffron two scruples, the
marrow of an Ox one ounce, powned Hermodactyli, Pionie roots, Stechas
flowers, and Southernwood of each half a dragme, Wax as much as is needful
for to make a tough salve. This being done, then be the hands to be covered
warm with vnkemmed sheeps wool, and the bruised fingers are to be bounden and
to be put into warm gloves, to the end they may be kept from all manner of
cold. When as this has been observed the space of eight days, then is the
fomentation to be omitted, and to use this salve following: Take oil of Nardus
one ounce and a half, oil of Euphorbium one ounce, oil of Saffron, and of
Pepper, of each half an ounce, Stechas, Swines bread, white Pepper,
Hermodactyli, Pionie roots, and Southernwood, of each one dragme, Galbanum,
Serapinum, and Ammoniacum, of each one quarter of an ounce; sees the oil and
the gum easily together. When it begins to be cold, then temper the powder
in it, and make a salve of it, wherewith anoint the hands twice a day, and
keep them always warm.

Of the Fellon or Ancome in the Fingers.. 12.
THis impostumation which some do call Panaricium, and we a Fellon or Ancome,
is none other but a sharp and hot impostumation of the fingers, which bring
such a pain with them, that the patient thereby, neither by night nor by day
can rest or sleep, neither can get any ease by any means, until that the said
impostume be opened.

This impostumation is first to be remedied with cooling things that do also
thereby mollify and ripen, like as this salve following: Take the oil of
Masticke, and unripe Sallad oil, of each one ounce, cleansed Antimonium half
a dragme, prepared Tutiae three drag. white Wax half an ounce, Rosin half an
ounce, the Wax, Rosin, and Oil are to be molten together, and the rest to be
tempered amongst it; afterward anoint the fingers with it often.

Item, take Sulphur, Garlic, Carui, the soote of a Chimney, and Salt, of each
a like quantity: powne all to pap and bind it upon the hand. Yet one more:
Take the innermost skins of Eg-shels, lay them upon the finger, and this former
salve upon them, wherewith we will commend, and commit the cure of this accident
unto the Chirurgians.

Of the Nails on the Fingers and Toes.. 13.
THese Nails are the outward parts of the sinews, and have their root and
foundation, and do grow out of the superfluity of the same, which increasing
consists not at all in the depth or breadth, but only like to hair in the
length. Aristotle says, that the fingers and the toes are given only for a
defense: but Galen adds unto it, that they be therefore made, for that
therewith all small and subtle things might be opened. These Nails have of
themselves no sense or feeling, therefore do they need no great remedies; and
for that cause will we only admonish here, and discourse of the impostumation
of the roots of the Nails.

And if so be that there be then any impostumation in the roots of the Nails,
or there happen any other harm unto them, then take Sarcocolla, Masticke, and
Frankincense, of each one quarter of an ounce, Comfery, burnt Allume,
Hartwoort, of each one dragme, Ammoniacum, Myrrha, Verdigrease, and white
Coperas, of each one scruple; powne them all to a subtle powder, and strew
upon it. This powder dries, consumes all bad flesh, and it heals also
marvelous well: this may you also use on the Nails of the feet.

The second Chapter. Of the Legs and the Feet.
IN this second part of the outward members we will only add and write this,
which is, that these Legs like the arms also be divided into three parts:
whereof the uppermost part is the whole hippe even to the knees: the second
part is from the knees even to the feet: the third part is the feet with all
that is annexed unto them. As much as now concerns the diseases of these
three parts, they are to be helped and healed with the same remedies which be
ordained for the arms. But the legs be subject to other mo especial
accidents, as broken veins called Varices, wherewith commonly the thighs, the
knees, and the calves are burdened, like as we will admonish thereof in the
fifth Part, the first Chapter, and fifth. amongst other swellings. And albeit
that it first of all behooves to discourse of the uppermost part of the legs:
yet will we nevertheless defer it, until that we come where we shall write
of the Sciaticke, or Gout of the hips, because that we will observe our method.

Of the Knees. 1.
AS much as concerns the knees and other members more, the which have no
several description; therewith is to be dealt, like as is said in the Chapter
of the Arms: but that only for all diseases of the knees, the oil of Tiles
is highly recommended.

In like sort also this salve following is very requisite for all diseases of
the knees, and of all other members, whether they be bruised through thrusts,
through eluxations, or wrinchings: Take the juice of Sage, of Betonie, of
Rosemary, and of Cammomill, of each one ounce: sees these juices in eight
ounces of good wine, until the wine be almost wasted, then put powned Mastick
unto it, and Frankincense, of each three drag. and let them sees again until
they be meetly thick: afterward temper therein one scruple of Saffron, oil
of Roses, of Earthwormes, and of Masticke, of each one ounce and a half, oil
of Iunipers, powned Linseede, and powned Juniper berries, of each one quarter
of an ounce, then temper all them together. And if so be that it be too soft,
then put a little Wax unto it.

When as any body has any cold defluxion fallen into his knees, that he can
neither go nor stand, then is this following especial good, and also many
times approved: Take the oil of Tyles, and of Turpentine, of each one dragme,
oil of Argall half a dragme, oil of Euphorbium one scruple, oil of Dill,
and of Juniper, of each one quarter of an ounce; make a salve thereof with a
little Wax, and anoint the knees warm with it.

You shall also find hereafter diverse sundry remedies for this in the
description of the Podagra, and of Arthritis, which may be also used unto the
knees. As much as does appertain unto the veins of the knees has been
written before in the Introduction.

Of the Shins.. 2.
IT comes also oftentimes to pass, that there rises upon the Shins certain
ulcers which are not so soon to be healed, but continue long, and do corrode
also hitherwards and thitherwards, and make very great scabs; for which this
following is to be used and thus prepared: Take Wax and Rosin, of each one
ounce, sheep suet two ounces, Pitch, and Sallad oil, of each three ounces,
Masticke, and Frankincense, of each three dragmes and a half, washed Litharge
of gold one ounce and a half, Ceruse one quarter of an ounce; let the Oil and
the Rosin be sodden together, and then melt the Wax amongst it. When it
begins to be cold, then temper all the other things powned small amongst it,
and so keep it in a pot. At the first wash these ulcers thrice every day with
warm sweet wine, and then anoint it afterward with the said salve.

Item: Take Ceruse, Antimonie, Lytharge of gold, and burnt Lead, all of them
washed, of each one ounce, molten suet three ounces, Frankincense, Momie,
Sandaraca, Sarcocolla, burnt Allume, and Dragon blood, of each one ounce and a
half, oil of Roses, and of Vinegar, of each three quarters of an ounce, Wax
and Rosin, of each one ounce, make a plaster of it. This said plaster is very
good for all depascent ulcers which be caused of a burnt melancholic matter,
it expels heat, it dries, it asswageth the pain, it maturateth all hard
biles and pushes, and especially it heals all ulcers of the Shins.

The piaiscer Sparadrapum is also used for this, which is thus to be prepared:
Take three ounces of Sheep sewet, oil of Roses and Ceruse, of each one
ounce, Vinegar four ounces, Litharge of gold one ounce and a half, Rosin and
Turpentine, of each one ounce; let the oil and the fat sees well together,
afterward put the vinegar and all other things unto it: and then add as much
molten Wax unto it as will suffice for to make a tough plaster of it.

This plaster is also very good; but the patient must above all things beware
of overmuch going and wearying the legs.

Of the Feet.. 3.
THe Feet be as foundations of the whole body, which also be in like manner
divided into three parts, viz. the Insteps of the Feet, the Plants or Soles,
and the five Toes, which be not unlike to the fingers, but that they be a little
shorter: and that the great Toe does shut up and close the rest of the toes, as
the thombe does the fingers. They be very helpful and commodious unto men that
they may stand the faster, and the better bear the burden of the body.

These Feet and the whole legs do otherwhiles get the crampe, or a
contracture of the sinews, whereof we have written much before in the first
Part, the twelfth Chapter, 14. and 15.. They do oftentimes stink very much:
and to remedy it there is nothing, but oftentimes to change ones sockes, and
to bath the Feet in water wherein Nutte leaves, Cypers leaves, Allume, and
other well sauouring and odoriferous things be decocted. You have also before
in the second. of the first Chapter, where is discoursed of the stench of the
Armepits, further instructions. For this it is also meet to keep clean the
place between the toes, and to use oftentimes warm Foot bathes, and then to
strew burnt Allume between the toes, which dries the stinking, and also
keeps them clean.

And because the Feet be much subject to be frozen, which yields no small
hinderance to a body in going, therefore we will discourse somewhat thereof.

Hereupon do some lay playing cards wetted, and affirm that they heal this
disease in every respect whether it be open or not. Some do counsel that a
blew woollen cloute should be burnt to powder and strewed upon it. Item, take
the whites of five Eggs, and burn them in a little Barrowes grease, and anoint
the frozen place with it; but I take the yolks to be better. This following is
best of all: Take Turpentine, and put meetely much Salt unto it, stir it so
long until it be thick like unto dough: after that spread it on a cloth, and
lay it thereon the space of eight days, at the least twice a day: if it be
used immediately after that the Feet be frozen; then does it cleanse the same,
and heals it presently.

Corns on the Toes.
Touching Corns which come upon the Feet, so it is, that in the midst of the
same there grows a small black or white callositie, like as it were a wart,
the which through his hardness makes so great a pain, that one can hardly
tread or go upon it. Whereto some of these remedies ensuing may be used: Take
the gall of a Pickerell, and bind it upon it, or anoint it therewith. Item,
make a plaster of red sealing Wax, and lay it thereon. Others do go somewhat
tougher to work with it, and do take yellow Arsenicke, (which is Orpiment)
Copperas, and Allume, of each a like quantity, and temper it unto a salve with
honey, and anoint it therewith. Or they do take one quarter of an ounce of
Galbanum, and let it steep so long in vinegar until it be as soft as salve,
and lay the same so long upon it until the corns wear away. But this
following is oftentimes found to be good, so that the whole Corn falls away
thereby, and is also very safe: Take of the plaster Diachilon magnum, and
Pitch, which is Shoomakers Wax, of each a like much, make a plaster of it;
spread it on a cloth, and lay it upon it the space of three or four days
beneath on the plants of the Feet, and go upon it; afterward take fresh again
so long until they be thoroughly whole.

You shall find mo other good things in the first Part, where we do discourse
of warts, which be also very commodious for this purpose.

The third Chapter. Of the pain in the Joints in general.
NExt to the forementioned diseases and sicknesses which the arms hands, legs,
and feet be subject unto, there be diverse more and much stronger diseases than
the former, in the joints which be also very needful to be described. But we
will above all discourse generally of them, and divide this matter into two
parts: whereof the first part is called by the learned Gutta, wherein shall be
showed all the causes, signs, orders, and other things which be commonly
requisite for all pains of the joints. The second part shall we comprehend
under a general Gout, or Arthritis, under which is contained all pains of the
joints: for most famous Physicians do severally write of them, and afterward
we will speak of three other sundry Species of the Gout, which only light
upon certain places of the body, as Chiragra, Ischia, and Podagra.

All sorts of Gouts may manifest themselves in whatsoever part of the body
they will, yet are they so like one another, and so allied together, that many
learned men have written of the^ all under one, and have only excepted Ischia,
to be another kind: which error grew on this foot; for that all the sorts of
it do after one and the same manner pain all the joints of the body.
Nevertheless, we will as much as is possible, and as much as the cause
requires, make a several declaration of each by it self.

Of the Gout in general called Gutta.. 1.
LIke as we have before admonished, so do the learned comprehend all diseases
and defluxions which do fall into all the joints under the name of Gutta, which
is a passion or pain of the joints which falls into them and the sinews of
man's body by some humors or wind from above, or from the next adjacent place:
or which is caused through bad disposition of the whole body. This grievous
pain may also be caused sometimes through a fracture of a bone, through
wrenchings, through great stirrings with a full belly, through falls, blows,
thrusts, through eluxations, and through great outward heat or cold: by which
means all the joints are weakened. For this also helps much, all cold and
waterish meats if the same be long used: as fruit, great fishes, and
especially if they be without scales, swines flesh, water fowls, and such like.
To be idle, and to live without any exercise. Also excessive venery, especially
after that one has eaten and drunken. Obstruction of any accustomed course, as
of the Pyles, of any open ulcers, of detention of the terms, and such like,
whereby nature was accustomed to cleanse her self. Item, it is also found by
experience, that some do inherit this disease from their ancestors.

In fine, there be two principal causes whereby these kinds of diseases be
provoked, as first of all the show of these defluxions. Secondly, the
increasing of these defluxions from above. Thirdly, feebleness of the members
which receive this superfluity.

The signs of the Gout are manifest of themselves: to wit, if one feel great
pain, and that at sundry times on the places where these defluxions do fall,
otherwhiles with swelling, and sometimes without swelling, and whether this
proceed of heat or cold, that may be perceived by feeling. If it then come
through any outward cause, that may be demanded of the sick persons
themselves, or if it come through any repletion of the body, that appears by
the signs of the veins, grosnesse of the body, fulness of the pulse, sloth of
all the members, by the diminishing of understanding or memory, loss of
appetite, and by the feebleness of the sight. If this disease be caused
through blood, then it is commonly in fat and repleated bodies, with pain of
the head, with great vnlustines, with unquiet sleep, with diminishing of the
understanding, with wearines, with rednes of the whole body and the urine:
there is also heat with it, panting and swelling, and that in the place
infected, especially if one have lived sumptuously. Item, all cold things are
welcome unto him, and all warm things painful, and if they be used too long,
also hurtful: Yet this the rather in young persons being full of blood by
nature, and if he dwell in a hot country. If this disease be caused of
Phlegma, or of cold humors, then is there neither panting nor great pain with
it, but remains for the most part in one place without removing hitherwards
or thitherwards; neither is there also any great rednes or heat with it, and
for the more certainty that the same is caused through Phlegma, if the same be
so found in an old person in winter time, after that he has eaten much cold
and moist meats and drinks, or has much and long frequented water. Also all
warm things be acceptable unto him and all cold things noisome.

If so be that this disease proceed of Cholera, then is there a strong heat
with it, that one can hardly suffer it in the feeling, also a great pain
without swelling, with drought and distention. With this will the patient also
perceive a bitterness of the mouth. And these things will be the rather
confirmed if the patient be young and choleric by nature, or if it be summer
time: also being hot and dry weather, etc.

This pain of the joints proceeds very seldom, or also never through
melancholy, if it be not mixed with some subtle moisture, then is there very
little pain with it, and also little help^ for it whatsoever is done unto it:
for the place of this disease will be hard, remains black without any
rednes. And it happens not but in old folks about winter, etc. If this be
caused of wind, then is it swollen, thick without great pain, which
oftentimes remoueth from the one joint to the other, and the patient has used
much meat and drink before which do engender wind. If there be any humors
mixed amongst these winds, then must it be considered and passed upon the
forementioned signs, whereby will very soon be perceived what humor has
mixed it self amongst these winds, according to which every one may know how
to dispose and govern himself.

Like as then hitherto in diverse places certain common rules have been made,
so will we proceed here also: whereof the first is. For as much as the Gout
Arthritis, Podagra, and such like, appear most of al in harvest, by reason of
the fruit eaten the whole summer, therefore must all fruits be eschued.
Secondly, for as much as venery is so hurtful for this disease, and increases
it very much, the same is to be refrained as much as is possible. Thirdly, a
quiet idle life, and sleep by day time do hinder that the superfluity cannot
be consumed. To the contrary, too great stirring and exercise, whereby the
members be over heated, are also oftentimes the cause of this pain of the
members; therefore is the same as much as is possible to be eschued. Fourthly,
all Wine, and especially strong wine is very hurtful for all them that be
plagued with the Gout. Fifthly, all rioting and drunkenness make bad digestion,
whereby also the pain of the Gout is augmented. Sixthly, they that be hot of
nature, and addicted to the Gout, are to refrain from all phlegmatic meat
which is dressed with sundry things, and also from all meat which does make
Cholera and blood, for that when these two humors come together, then do they
bring gross and undigested defluxions in the joints, whereof then the Gout is
caused. Seventhly, there be some through purging and letting of blood that are
freed from this disease, which may most commodiously be done in the spring of
the year. Eighthly, the air hurts them much that be troubled with the Gout.
Ninthly, all great gross fishes, and especially Eeles be hurtful for the
Gout. Tenthly, sucking Pigs, all water fowls and old Hens are especially
hurtful to the lower members. Eleuenthly, milk and wine eaten together be very
noisome for all members, and very hurtful for the head. Twelfthly, the drink
which is taken without thirst brings much hurt to the body. Thirteenthly,
like as great surfeiting with meat is very hurtful for all the joints, even
so does a moderate diet refresh them. Fourteenthly, the going too much, or
weary walking, and hanging down of the legs, especially presently after
meat, is very hurtful for the joints. Fifteenthly, to lie upon ye back is
also hurtful. Sixteenthly, anger is enemy to this disease. Seuenteenthly, the
great sensibility of ye ioints, and especially of the feet, cannot suffer any
pain. The foresaid seventeen rules are only ordained for this purpose, to
free one from the Gout: but as much as does concern the means whereby these
joints are to be strengthened and preserved, that the same do not receive those
defluxions whereon depends the principal means to free one from it, are in
these rules following to be observed. Eighteenthly, it is very requisite that
the feet be often bathed in Alum water. Ninteenthly, Sage decocted in Beer,
and the same drunken oftentimes, is commended, as it were a very secret
medicine and receipt which has an ineffable operation in all diseases of the
joints. Twentithly, Almond flower, Cammomill, Myrrh, Melilote and Roses be
very commodious for the ioints. Calmus and ground Iuie have an especial virtue
for to strengthen all the ioints: the same does also the Indian Nut kernel.
One and twentithly, Verueine laid fresh upon the feet and so worn, is very
good for the Podagra.

These things following do strengthen much the sinews. The root Behen and his
oil does warm the contracted sinews: in like manner also Bdellium and Calmus
laid upon it with oil of Citron peeles, of Cammomill, of Beuercod, Cypers
roots, Cassie wood and Cypers: also oil of Costus, and such like oils are
maruellously praised and commended for the sinews, and Centorie in clisters.
Item, feet water made of the ashes of a Bay tree. For a salve, the mother of
Sallad oil is good, and the dregs of the oil of Lillies, and of all other
oils which be warm by nature. Opopanacum is also much commended, but Pyretrum
and Pepper above all other to warm the sinews. For this be also dry sweet
bathes good, or natural Sulphur bathes. After purging is Treacle and
Mithridate much commended in all cold Goutes, drunken with wine wherein Sage
has been decocted.

But as much as concerns the curing of these joint diseases, it is not
needful to discourse any further of them, because that we hereafter will write
of this matter at length. Therefore we will proceed in the name of God.

The fourth Chapter. Of the Gout in the Ioints, Arthritis.
THe second description which speaks commonly of the pain in the ioints,
whereof we have briefly admonished before, is that which the Latinists do call
Morbum articularem, and the Grecians Arthritim, which is as much to say, as the
pain of the ioints, or an inflammation of the ioints, which proceeds from
within the body, and the Tendones be annoyed, hurt and pained. In fine, it is
none other than a dispersed Podagra over the whole body: the which at one time
comes behind in the neck, another time in the shoulder blades; then again
in the back bone, and in the hands, in the fingers, and in the elbowes: the
which also sometimes creeps into the nethermost ioints, as in the legs, the
knees, in the feet and toes. And although in this disease, like as also in
other diseases more, there be many sundry remedies sought by many sundry
careful Physicians, according to the quality of the cause, and place of the
pain; therefore is there but one general rule to be observed. First, how one
shall be preserved from this disease. Secondly, how that the same is to be cured
and taken away altogether. And because the time of the year imports not a
little therein, therefore is choice to be made of it.

In summer the matter is thus to be handled. This kind of patient in the
beginning of summer is to be purged with that which ensues: Take Agaricus one
dragme, Sugar one ounce, Hermodactils one dragme and a half, water of field
Cypers three ounces, make the water warm, and steep the rest four and twenty
hours in it; afterward wring it hard out, and drink it warm in the morning,
and then fast six hours upon it.

Afterward is this potion following to be used at least eight days together
early in the morning, and to fast four hours after it: Take one ounce of the
honey of Roses, the water of white water Mints, and the water of field Cypers,
of each one ounce and a half; temper them together. He may also take to
prepare the humor, honey of Roses, Syrupum de Stoechade, and some of the
foresaid waters. The ninth day shall he swallow these pills following: Take
Pillularum de Hermodactilis and Foetidarum, of each half a dragme; make
thereof seven pills with the sirupe of Roses, and take them early in the morning.

And if so be that one would take no pills, then take five dragmes of
Hieralogodion and Turbith beaten small, half a scruple, Diagridion two
grains, Ginger three grains; temper them together, and take it so, or put
some distilled water unto it.

Some expert Physicians do advise much to this Clister: Take Ireas, the roots
of wild Cucumbers, field Cipers, and Saint John's woort, of each two handfuls,
sees them all together in sufficient water; then take of this decoction twelve
or sixteen ounces, and temper therewith Hieralogodion one ounce, oil of Rue
three ounces, honey of Roses one ounce, the yolke of an Egg well braied, Salt
one dragme, use it once a day.

In Harvest is the patient once every fourteen days to take one dragme of
these pills following: Take Aloe two ounces, Agaricus and Hermodactyli, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Coloquint one dragme and a half, Ginger, Cinnamome,
Asarabacca, Cloves and Mace, of each one scrup. Turbith and Epithymus, of each
one drag. Saffron one scruple, stamp each alone: afterward temper them
together, and power sufficient field Cipers water upon it, and then set it out
to dry in the Sun. Lastly, power more of the same water upon it, and let it
dry again, to the end you may fashion Pills of it.

Secondly, there is to be considered how that next after purging, between the
spring and harvest, the matter might be derived toward another place, and so
to expel it, which may be best of all done by those means which force urine,
whereto these things following are to be used. First the patient is to drink
about the space of fourteen days, every morning five ounces of Asarabacca
sugared: or in the steed thereof the water of Madder which is better. There is
also good for this both these things following: Take Pease meal one scruple,
old Treacle half a dragme; temper them together with two ^^nces of Smallage
water, and so drink it, and fast five hours after it. Item, take Trociscos de
Eupatorio half a dragme, Gromell seed, Cinnamom and Carui, of each five
grains, Benedicta laxatiua one dragme and a half; temper them together with
two ounces of strong white wine, then drink it and fast five hours after it.

All that shall be hereafter mentioned consumes the defluxions which be still
settled in the joints: then is the place of this disease to be rubbed softly,
and anointed with this following, according as the patient can suffer it: Take
unripe Sallad oil two ounces, well parched salt one ounce, anoint the ioints
very warm with it, and then wrap them in warm clothes. The joints are to be
also fomented with light red wine and vinegar powered on hot stones, that they
may sweat well. They are also to be anointed with this following: Take
Sagapenum one ounce, Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of each half an ounce, Sandaraca
one quarter of an ounce: the Gum is to be dissolved in a little red Vinegar,
and with Wax make a salve thereof.

Another: Take oil of Roses and of Cammomill, of each one ounce, three yolks
of eggs, Saffron grains; temper them and use them together. After the
annoynting you are to strew the powder of earthwormes upon it, and cover it
close with sheep wool. Or take oil of Foxes, oil of earthwormes, and washed
Turpentine, of each one quarter of an ounce, Salt three dragms: use the^ as
before. You are also to annoint the same places with warm oil of Roses.

This following is also very highly commended: Take Venice Soap three ounces
and a half, cut it very thin, and then let it sees a waume or twain in six
ounces of the water of Fumitory: afterward you are to put unto it the oil of
Euphorbium, and of S. John's woort, of each half an ounce, oil of Juniper one
ounce and a half, oil of Earthwormes, one ounce; let it then sees until
that the water be sodden away: afterward you are to put unto it Mastick and
Frankincense, of each one quarter of an ounce, Sulfure vif, Euphorbium, and
Pieretrum, of each two drag. and a half: use it as is aforesaid.

Oil of earth worms.
The oil of Earthwormes is especial good for all pain of the ioints, and for
all frozen sinews; the which is made thus: Take Earthwormes three ounces; wash
the same with Wine, and power unto it twelve ounces of Sallad oil, Wine six
ounces: sees them together by a gentle fire until the Wine be sodden away,
afterward strain them thorough a cloth.

For this disease be all warm baths also requisite. And if they cannot be
gotten, then are the same to be made by the advice of a learned Physician, yet
the most commodious time of bathing is from the midst of April to the end of
May.

And because that these defluxions be more manifest in the Spring and Harvest,
than in any other time of the year, unto which times we have appropriated all
these foresaid remedies: therefore will we now teach what is to be done unto it
in winter. For this is purging to be used again, and that in this manner
following. When as September is half past, then are these pills to be taken
once in the morning: Take Pillulas de Agarico, and de Hermodactylis, of each
half a dragme, Indy salt two grains, make seven Pills thereof with the
Confection of Roses. The day after is this following to be dronken, the which
is thus 8. or 10. days together to be continued: Take the sirupe of Wormwood,
and Syrupum de Eupatorio, of each three quarters of an ounce, water of Hops, or
field Cipers, of each one ounce and a half, temper them together: afterward
is this following to be drunken: Take the Confection Benedicta three dragmes,
Inda two dragmes and a half, water of blew flower deluce two ounces; temper
them al together, make it warm and drink it.

Afterward are the foresaid pills which be ordained to be used in Harvest,
beginning: Take Aloe, etc. to be used throughout all the Winter.

As much as concerns other things, those remedies are to be used which be
ordained to be used in Summer, only that they must be used in more quantity;
like as it is advised in Summer to take one dragme, in Winter one dragme and a
half: and so also with bathing and otherwise.

You shall hereafter have many sundry things which may be used against the
Gout, or joint diseases, viz. Confected Quinces, Marmalade, and all that may be
made of Quinces, except that there be no spices with it if the disease be with
heat. For this, be things also good which shall shortly after be ordained for
the Gout Podagra. If so be that there be no special heat with it, and that
wine may be used without any great danger, then is it his nature that it
strengthens all outward members, if the same be moderatly drunken. Amongst
herb wines are these following much commended for it, viz. of Rosemarie, of
Wormwood, of Sage, and of Clarie: all which not only drunken, but also the
joints anointed with it; or the vapor thereof received into the diseased
joints, do also strengthen the same.

When one is come to his former health, then must one look to it and also
beware and take heed from all those things which are wont to cause those kinds
of defluxions into the said joints: To which end you may look all the rules in
the first Chapter, which be described in the first. Take good Turpentine the
quantity of a Bean, or in stead of that Opopanacum, or Sagapenum, which you
will in the like quantity.

There is very meet in like manner, if one take early in the morning half a
scrup. of Lignum Aloes, with an ounce of the water of field Cipers. It is also
much advised to take twice every week one dragme of good Mithridate, or in
stead thereof one Mirobalan Chebuli chewed and eaten: or one day Mithridate,
and the other day one Mirobalan. All these foresaid things be not only
commodious, but also very safe. Let this suffice now generally spoken of the
joint disease Arthritide, and we will now proceed with the Chiragra.

The fifth Chapter. Of the Gout in the hands, Chiragra.
FOr the second sort of the Gout will we describe the Chiragra, the which we do
properly call the hand Gout. But because that betwixt the Gout of the hands and
that of the feet there is none other difference, but that the one comes in
the hands and the other in the feet: therefore will we here refer us to the
Gout of the feet, where we will thoroughly discourse of these two kinds of
infirmities.

The sixth Chapter. Of the Gout of the Hips Ischia, commonly called Sciatica.
BEfore in the first Chapter and first. in dividing the sorts of the Gout, and
in the description of Gutta, is this kind Ischia taken for the third sort, the
which of the Physicians that do not well understand the Greek speech, is
called Scia and Sciatica. This Gout of the hips is a long lingering pain, and
especially when it comes into the bones of the hips: notwithstanding that it
does otherwhiles appear in the uppermost parts, which is caused of a cold
moisture that falls down from above: And because that her gross toughnes
cannot easily be consumed, but much rather augmented from day to day and made
worse, then falls it at the last into the knees, the legs, into the feet,
and so out at the toes. The same tough humors do cause also oftentimes through
their great, gross and tough sliminesse, that the hip bones be eluxated,
although otherwhiles they return again to their natural places, and that
when the ligaments of these joints through this waterish moisture happen to be
loosed or resolved, and afterward wax hard again, and shrink up as before.
But if this foresaid hip bone be long eluxated, then does it come easily to
pass, that thereby the whole leg comes to extenuate; whereof then a mere
impotencie or lamenesse might follow: so that this disease afterward very
hardly, but by actual cauterization may be helped, whereby the matter may be
drawn out with cautery, which, when one is minded to use it, is to be done
beneath the knees in the Calves, and that in the leg so diseased.

But before and ere we come to the remedy we will first prescribe a general
rule how to govern himself in his order of diet, which not only in this, but
also in other sicknesses (according to the importance of the cause and place)
may be diminished, augmented and altered. This that follows here is ordained
for them, in whose bodies all gross, cold, tough and flegmaticke humors
tempered with Cholera, do abound.

But these must first eschew all cold air, low dwellings, and especially they
which do lie near the water side. The windows of his dwellings are also to
open against the South and East (if it be fair weather) and the rest remain
shut. And if so be that the time of the year will permit it, then is his
chamber to be always kept warm, with a continual fire, and to be hang the
stone walls with Tapestrie, or to let it be wainescoted, or fenced with boords.
In like manner he is also to keep his head well from cold, and to beware of
great exercise, especially if he feel any pain, and that so long as any pain
is instant, and until the joints be strengthened.

What concerns further the meat and drink, one is to keep himself therein
moderatly, and to use all such sorts of meats and drinks which do yield small
sustenance or nourishment, and be meet rather to make one lean than fat, and
especially if there be any debility of the stomach, or any wambling with it.
He is also to chew his meat well, and to eschew the variety of drinks:
Otherwise he is to use those meats which be warm and dry, and that are dressed
and strewed with any drying and warming things; as with Pepper, Salt, Cinnamom,
Nutmegs, Fennel, Parsley, Annis, Hyssope, Mints, Thyme, and such like things
more. His bread must be a little more than common bread, leauened and salted. He
is also to eat no other flesh but Hens, Pullets, Pigeons, Fesants, and all
kind of field Fowls: yet for the most part rather roasted than sodden. Veale and
Mutton is also very healthie for him. Amongst herbs be Colewoorts, Fennel,
yellow rapes, etc. very good for him: but all cold herbs must he eschew, or at
least use them very seldom and little, and being always tempered with some
warm herbs: red Pease, Lentils, and Rice dressed with fresh flesh, may he eat.
Amongst fruits there be none that be more requisite than Figs, Raisins, Hasell
nuts, Almonds and such like. The sweet odoriferous Grapes be not much forbidden
him. He is also to be restrained from butter as much as is possible, because of
her slime and moist nature: but rather in stead thereof to use the oil of
sweet Almonds, Sallad oil, or oil of Walnuts. Vinegar, Veriuice, Limons,
Oranges, or their juice be not much commended, and if one will ever use them,
then must some other warming things, as Salt, Pepper, Cinnamom, be tempered
with it in eating of other meats. All fish and doughie meats be very hurtful
unto him. The best drink that he can drink is Honey water, which may be
prepared as follows: Take twelve quarts of water, and one quart of Honey, let
them sees together until eight quarts remain: if you put Annis unto it, then
will it be the better. Certain later Physicians do advise (and that with good
reason) that these patients should drink the decoction of Guaiacum: and how
the same is to be prepared, that shall you find described hereafter in the fifth
part, in the discourse of the Pocks. Out of these forementioned reasons is it
easily to be noted and marked, that it were very good utterly to forbear wine:
but if it cannot be, then to choose a thin red wine, or the sirupe of Betonie,
and Oxymel of Squils decocted with Annis water.

Further, it is not very good to sleep much, and chiefly in the day time
immediately after meat, for that ingendreth much slime and other tough
moistures. One hour and a half after supper is he to go to bed, and to lie
first upon the right side, afterward upon the left. Through much lying upon
the back do the defluxions fall to great prejudice behind in the neck, and in
the back bone. His sleep shall also not endure longer than seven or eight
hours, and the rest of the time is to be spent in watching.

Of the pain in the Hippes or Sciatica through heat.. 1.
TO remedy the manner of this pain, is but a little different from all other
joint diseases, because that they always for the most part proceed of cold,
and do lie deep in the joints of the Hippes. For the which in this disease all
diureticall medicines be hurtful, because that thereby the matter will be made
so much the grosser and tougher; so that afterward it can by no means be
consumed. Now when this disease is caused through heat, wherein commonly a
cold flegmaticke matter is mixed with Cholera: yet notwithstanding, Phlegma
getting the maisterie, the same may easily be perceived by the high colored
urine, and other signs more. Therefore for a beginning is the liver vein to be
opened in the arm, and that in the same side where the pain is: afterward the
vein (which is named of the disease Scia) and stands as is described in the
Introduction, upon the foot, and to let out four or five ounces of blood. But
good heed is to be taken therein unto the strength and power of the patient:
for that, like as we have said in other places, the veins in the lower parts
do weaken the body more when they be opened, than those in the uppermost parts.

Other do counsel, that first the vein in the foot is to be opened: and if
so be that the pain do not cease in some days after it, that then the same
vein should also be once opened in the other foot: and beware of going the
space of eight days. Likewise is also much commended to set boxing cups upon
the Hips, or above the Hips, according to the importance of the disease.

Of the pain in the Hips or Sciatica through cold.. 2.
But if so be that this pain of the Hips proceed through cold, like as for the
most part it is wont to do, the which the bleaknesse of the face, the lingering
pain, the belching of the stomach, the wambling and the falling down of all
cold humors does show: then is the patient to be respected and taught to order
himself accordingly: yet have you for an example this ensuing.

For a preparatiue of the matter, make this sirupe following, and then take
thereof about two ounces at once, according to that one is bound or loose of
the body: and so fast four hours after it.

Take Fennel roots, Sperage roots, Parsley roots, Smallage roots, and
Polipodie roots, of each one ounce, the seed of Ruscus, wild Sage, Gromill
seeds, Nettle seed, the roots of Sarifrage, and the seeds of stone Parsley,
of each one ounce, Hearts tongue two ounces, Juniper berries three drag.
Hermodactyli, and Turbith, of each half an ounce, Honey 18. ounces, Radish
water 24. ounces, make a sirupe thereof.

Item, take all the foresaid things, and put unto it Ginger, wild Saffron
seed, of each one ounce and a half, Agaricus three dragmes, stone Salt two
scruples, Mace two scruples and a half, Sirupus de Stechade three ounces,
Honey as much as before, Rosemarie water, of Calmus and of Sage as much as will
suffice; afterward sees a sirupe thereof. At the last put a little Cinnamom,
Masticke, Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace unto it: also a little Musk and Amber.

For to purge: Take the Confection of Inda three dragmes, or half an ounce, de
Succo Rosarum one dragme and a half, water wherein Ginger is decocted three
ounces: give this betimes in the morning, and then sleep one hour after it:
afterward take a draught of Barley water after it. But if you had rather take
Pills, then take Pillulas foetidas, and Hermodactylorum, of each apart one
dragme, or mixed, of each half a dragme.

This also ensuing is to be prepared: Take the water of Pionie roots, and the
roots of Narcissus, of each two ounces, drink this for the space of certain
days, early in the morning.

Thereupon you are three hours after it, to swallow these pills following: take
Pillulas foetidas, and de Sarcocolla of each half a dragme, Swines bread one
dragme: make thereof twelve pills with the juice of Smallage.

Other do take washed Aloe half an ounce, Agaricus one drag. make thereof with
the sirupe de Acetoso composito, 35. Pills: then take of it about the third or
fourth evening just before supper, according to the quality of the cause.

Sharp Clisters with Salt, with Hiera, with Coloquint and other appropriate
things, be exceeding requisite for this, as also are these ensuing: Take
vnwormeaten Hermodactyls one ounce, field Cipers, Stechados, Saint John's woort,
Carui, and Rue seed, of each one handful and a half, Cammomill, Melilot, and
Dill seed, of each one handful, Saffron flowers one dragme: sees them all
together in sufficient water, and take twelve or sixteen ounces of this
decoction, Beuercod oil three ounces, Indie salt one quarter of an ounce,
Hiera Colocynthidis half an ounce, temper them, and set it meetly warm. These
Clisters are very meet for to draw the cold matter from the hips, and to
expel wind.

Another: Take Coloquint half an ounce, Turbith, wild Saffron seed, and
Polypodie roots, of each half an ounce, Asarabacca, field Cipers, Stechados,
Pionie, white Pepper, and Rue seed, of each one dragme and a half: sees them
all together, and take of this decoction as before, and put unto it oil of
Costus, and of Beuercod, of each one ounce and a half, Saltpeter four
scruples: but use it not too hot.

The third. Take the pickle of Herings, or salted Limons twelve ounces, oil of
Beuercod three ounces, minister this Clister like as the rest. These Clisters
be much commended of all later and ancient Physicians: but they bruise
otherwhiles the Arseguts within, which are hardly to be healed afterward.

The fourth which is not too strong. Take S. John's woort, Cammomill, Centorie,
Dill, Malowes, Brionie roots, and Fenegreeke, of each one ounce, Annis three
dragmes, Coloquint one quarter of an ounce, stone Salt half a drag. Bran half
a handful, oil of bitter Almonds, and clarified Honey, of each one ounce, mix
them all together.

For a fomentation you are to take Pionie seed, Pionie roots, and
Hermodactyli, of each one ounce and a half, S. John's woort, Artichoke leaves,
Stechados, and the herb Calmus, of each four ounces, and eight or ten heads
of white Poppie; sees them all together in three pints of water even to the
half, at last put unto it one ounce and a half of Saffron-flowers, and
afterward make a great cloth or a sponge wet in this decoction, and foment
therewith twice a day the hip and all the buttocke three or four times
together.

Immediately after fomenting is the Hippe to be anointed all over with this
following: Take unripe Sallad oil, or oil of Roses four ounces, oil of
Costus and of Southernewood, of each one ounce and a half, Sandaraca one
quarter of an ounce, Frankincense, Hypocistis, Pionie seed, and Hermodactyli,
of each one quarter of an ounce, Saltpeter, and Saffron of each one dragme,
Serapium, Opopanacum, and Rosin, of each one dragme and a half, red Wax as
much as is needful for to make a salve: temper them all together by the fire.
This salve expels the pain. The same is also well to be used without
fomenting: to wit, at noone.

Another: Take oil of Foxes three ounces, oil of Pieretrum, of Beuercod,
Badgers grease, of each half an ounce, Artichoke roots, Agaricus and
Stechados, of each one dragme, Lettice seed, Purslaine seed, and the seeds
of small Endive, and of water Lillies, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron
one scruple, white Wax as much as suffiseth for to make a weak salve with it,
afterward sees it in four ounces of the juice of Salomons seal until the
juice be well wasted: then anoint the whole Buttocks with it only at night:
for it is somewhat cold of nature: according to which one may know how he
should govern himself.

Item, take Turpentine, and small powned Hermodactyli, of each a like
quantity; make a salve of it, and use it as the rest. But if you had not this
salve, or desired not to use it, then may you anoint the place of the pain
with the oil of Lillies, of Spica, of Costus, of Foxes, and Bays, and such
like warm oils, whether it be each apart, or tempered together.

Of plasters, these following be good. Take Apostolicon one ounce and a half,
de Muscilaginibus half an ounce, Opopanacum and Galbanum, of each one quarter
of an ounce, Pionie roots, Hermodactyli, Calmus, and white Henbane seed, of
each two scrup. Saffron half a drag. then make a plaster thereof with wax, and
spread it upon two round pieces of leather a span in breadth, and as now lay one
upon it, and then another, and wear them always upon it, until one will use
the fomentation at nights. Item, take Ammoniacum six ounces, Sagapenum,
Bdellium, and Opopanacum, of each one dragme and a half, Swines bread, and
Hermodactyli, of each one ounce and a half, Coperas one dragme and a half,
Wax as much as is needful; make a plaster or salve of it.

When this sickness begins to decrease, and yet nevertheless there does
remain some wearisomnesse or anguish in the joints, then is this plaster
following to be made, and to be laid behin^ upon the rumpe, and the whole
buttocks: and if the same do make an itch, then is the same to be taken off
again, and the place to be rubbed with rough clothes, and then to lay the same
plaster again upon it, until that the joint be well strengthened. Take Pitch
six ounces, black Soap one ounce and a half, Hermodactyli and Pyonie seed,
of each one dragm, Rosin one ounce, Roses, Masticke, and the juice of Sloes, of
each four scruples, Euphorbium one scruple, burnt Coperas one dragme, Wax as
much as will suffice for a plaster. In fine, all warming plasters are very
meet for this. The nature of Turpentine is, that it helps this Sciatica,
through a secret operation: But because the same cannot be laid upon it, or
anointed, therefore is it to be tempered amongst the foresaid oils first
mentioned, or any of them that one will; as the oil of Saint John's woort,
which is especially commended for it. Some lay a sheep skin upon it, like as
it comes out of warm lie wherein the leather Dressers have it lying. Item,
sees Comin in water, and make a sponge or twain moist in this warm
decoction: wring it out, and foment the Hippe therewith. Or take Betonie, Sage,
both or one of both, sees them in Wine or Must, and whilst it is yet hot,
temper this powder following in it: as Chamedryos, Betony, Centorie,
Hartswoort, Gentian, of each half an ounce: use them with a sponge as is
beforesaid.

Another. Take Elecampane roots as much as you please, sees them well in
wine, stamp them in Swines grease, and lay it upon the place. This is also
good for all Byles of the Pockes.

This following is highly commended: Take Elecampane roots powned small 8.
ounces, of the best Sallad oil that may be gotten 24. ounces, Malmsey one
quart: sees them all together until ^^^me be consumed, and use it as before.

Take a hot loaf and lay upon it, or let the warm reeke or vapor go upon it
until the place of the pain begin to sweat, and do this certain times
together. After all this foresaid fomenting; anointing, plaistering, and
applications, it is firmly advised again to use these pills not for the
purging, but only to strengthen the parts diseased. Take well boiled
Turpentine half an ounce, field Cipers one quarter of an ounce, Hermodactyli
one dragme: make of a drag. six or seven pills, and take one every morning
and evening. Or take these following which be almost of the same nature: Take
Chamedryos, field Cipers, Hermodactyli, of each one dragm, boiled Turpentine
half an ounce, make pills thereof with the sirupe of Betonie, and use them as
is beforesaid.

Further, it is also needful that those parts which cause these defluxions be
strengthened, the which may be done as follows. For strengthening of the
stomach he is oftentimes to use Mace, Cloves, Mints, Indy Spica, Squinant,
Cipers roots, and Lignum Aloes, with his meat, and to use the Confection
Aromaticum Rosarum, and Diacalaminthum, Betony, Balm, and such like, with his
accustomed meat. The compounded things are the Confection Diambra, Diamoschu
dulcis, and de Xiloaloe, and that especially after supper. The kidneys will be
strengthened with Almonds, Hasell nuts, Pingles, dry and salt Cheese, and with
meat which is dressed with sheep milk: but they are to beware of much lying
on the back, and much venerie, especially presently after meat. Item, of
diureticall things, as Parsley seed, Annis and Smallage seeds, etc. These be
now the three principal parts and causes of the defluxions. The other parts
are not so highly to be regarded.

And for to consume these kinds of defluxions be all Physicians of an opinion,
that there is no better advice than to bath in natural warm Sulphur bathes,
Coperas bathes, Lime bathes, or Ash bathes. For that these do pierce through
the whole body, dry exceedingly, and do consume also all moisture. And if so
be that one cannot get into such natural bathes, then are Lies or bathes to be
prepared of the foresaid things, but the body must first be well purged. And if
the patient cannot bathe, or will not bathe, then are these things following to
be used, which vehemently consume all moisture: Take Sandaraca, Hypocistis,
Frankincense, and the juice of Sloes, of each one quarter of an ounce, Lie as
much as will suffice for to dissolve these things, and to temper them withal in
a mortar, then anoint the joint therewith twice a day. This following is
milder: Take powned Cipers nuts three ounces, Meal dust one ounce, temper them
together with the juice of Bayleaues, as aforesaid.

Item, take steeled water six ounces, powned Roses two ounces, Masticke, and
prepared Iron dross, of each one ounce, parched Salt three dragms, temper them
together in a mortar with the juice of Teasell leaves, or with water wherein
the same herb is decocted, it is good and approved. But if the pain continue,
then is there no other remedy (as is beforesaid) but to use cauterization,
which is also effected with plasters which raise blisters: but before this is
to be begun, the same is first to be tried with the foresaid strong clisters,
and afterward this salve following to be used: Take white Mustard seed, and
Pigeon dung, of each a like quantity: then sees figs in a little water until
they be almost dry, then powne them together for a plaster which is
afterward to be opened, and the water to be let out. If so be that this help
not at one time, then is it once again to be used: and if the pain cease not
then, and the joint be eluxated, then is it to be cauterized which is burned,
that will be done of an expert Chirurgian or learned Physician. For a
conclusion, may powder be used, which shall be ordained for the gout in the
feet, which begins thus: Take two kinds of Chamedryos, etc.

And if one which is cured fall again into the same passion, like as it is
wont to happen, and especially in those who have taken small advise and but
little purged, then is this order to be followed. In the beginning of the
pain, take Cipers nuts three ounces, Barley meal one ounce and a half, Roses
one ounce, Mastick, Myrtle seed, and Sarcocolla, of each two drag. and a
half; sees this all together in hard white Wine until it be meetly tough
like a plaster, then lay it warm upon it. This ensuing is yet more forcible:
Take Sandaraca one ounce, Cammomill, Melilot, and Dill seed, of each half an
ounce, Meal dust three ounces, Roses one ounce: sees them all together in
wine, as in the last is beforesaid, then stir amongst it the yolks of three
Eggs, and use it as before.

But when the pain is increasing, then put unto one of these foresaid one
ounce of the fat of sheep wool: but when the pain is at the extremest,
then are things to be used which do assuage the pain as follows: Take oil
of Roses, and of Cammomill, of each three ounces, six yolks of Eggs, let them
sees very soft, stirring them always about. Last of all, put one dragme and a
half of Saffron unto it, and use it as beforesaid. Or take Cow milk twelve
ounces, Barley meal three ounces, Masticke half an ounce, Saffron one dragme.
You are to let the meal and the milk sees thick, afterward temper the rest
amongst it. This is especial good if there be any heat with it.

But if the pain begin to diminish, then are drying things to be used for it:
Take Myrtle seed, Masticke, Sarcocolla, Plantaine, Pionie seed, Hermodactyli,
and field Cipers, of each one quarter of an ounce: stamp it all to powder, and
temper it with one of the forementioned which you will, and you shall find a
luckie operation.

The seventh Chapter. Of some accidents which this pain of the Hips does cause.
WE have in the beginning of this Sciatica declared, that ye legs happen
otherwhiles to extenuate, and especially when the member is eluxated or out of
joint, and has so continued a long time, whereof there follows further a
numbnesse and lamenesse: for which by good reason we ought to admonish somewhat
thereof before we begin to discourse of the feet.

Of the eluxation of the joints.. 1.
THis eluxation of the joints do the Grecians call Exarthrema. The Latinists
Eluxationem, and it is thus described: Exarthrema is a writhing aside of a
joint out of his natural place into another, whereby the free motion is
hindered. This disease cannot be cured but by manual operation, and by the
knowledge of all the parts of man's body, whereby each member which is eluxated
by thrusting, falls, or by looseness of the ligaments in the Sciatica, and
strengthenings of the diseased member: and although it chiefly concern the
Chirurgians, nevertheless we will here discourse somewhat of the eluxation of
the hips in the Sciatica.

This plaster following does marvelous much withstand all defluxions which
fall down into any joint, and do weaken the same. But first of all are the
places of this disease to be rubbed with this water following, which is to be
distilled out of a Calves gather in seething water or Balneum, the which is so
much the better, if so be that there be Sage, Brionie, Juniper berries, and
such like (according to the quality of the cause) added unto it. Afterward
boiled Tansie laid warm upon it is very requisite, the plaster whereof we
have spoken before, is thus prepared: Take Colophonia and Pitch, of each one
ounce, the Muscilage of Hollihockes three quarters of an ounce, Galbanum,
Myrrha, Ammonaicum, and Frankincense, of each three drag. Polypodie roots,
Miscleden and Hartwoort, of each one quarter of an ounce, Wax one ounce,
Turpentine three quarters of an ounce, the gums are to be dissolved in vinegar,
and then to put the Wax, Pitch, and Turpentine unto it, and then let it melt
by a soft fire, and to sees so long until that all the muscilage and vinegar
be wasted away, afterward temper the rest being beaten small amongst it, this
being now all done, then spread this plaster upon a cloth or leather, and lay
it upon the place of the disease.

Another: Take Hollihocke roots three ounces, small Akorne buddes three
quarters of an ounce, fresh Self-heale flowers one ounce and a half, cut all
very small, and stamp it to pap: then take unripe Sallad oil, and oil of
Myrtles, of each three quarters of an ounce, thick red wine 24. ounces, Self
heal water twelve ounces: sees all together so long until the wine and the
water be consumed. Then wring it out with a press, and put Frankincense and
Myrrh unto it of each one drag. Bucks sewet one scruple and a half,
Turpentine half an ounce; then let them sees again until all the moisture
be consumed. Lastly, put unto it small bruised silver skumme which is sifted
through linen, and Sealed earth of each half a dragme, Mini two dragmes and a
half, Wax as much as will suffice for a plaster, this plaster is not only
good for all Eluxations, but also for all fractures of bones, for it swageth
all pain, and strengthens the sinews.

Item, take a young oaken pole, and shave off the outwardmost rinds, afterward
the white: these white rinds are to be sodden in Beer, and then a woollen
cloth made wet therein, and so laid warm upon it. If you have no beer, then
take wine or water.

Of the extenuated or withered Limbs.. 2.
WE have before declared in the description of the pain of the hips or
Sciatica, that after eluxation of the joints, if the same continue long, the
legs come quickly to extenuate, and afterward to be lame.

Now for to remedy these accidents will we here discover certain things,
which, it cannot otherwise well be but that both these diseases, extenuation
and leanenesse must depend one upon the other: for that because the veins be
bereft of their due nourishment, the sinews and the tendons be stiffened, then
must necessarily ensue thereof such infirmities.

Therefore will we discourse of each apart as much as need requires: and
concerns the lamenesse. It is a disease if there be any contracture of the
hands, arms, legs, joints, or any other part, or be so lamed and numbed,
that he cannot use his joints, the which may also grow of many kind of causes,
of Apoplexia, of the Pocks, of the Cramp, and such like, of all which has been
spoken before, and shall be written of hereafter: but we will only discourse
how that these diseases are to be prevented, proceeding of other causes.

Take Mallows, Cammomil, Sage, Horehound, and Verueine, of each one handful,
Juniper branches with the green berries two handfuls, power five or six
quarts of water unto it, and sees them so long as Calves flesh: this may be
used the space of three days, afterward may a fresh be made.

First, take Fox grease two ounces, Capons grease one ounce, melt them
together, stirring them always about. When it is now molten, then put half an
ounce of Balsam oil unto it and let it be cold. When as both these things be
ready, then be the lamed limbs to be fomented in some vessel fit for that
purpose. If so be that the lamed part cannot lie whole therein, then is he to be
caused to sweat above the warm vapor, being covered all over, pouring the hot
decoction now and then unto it. This bathing or fomenting is to be done every
day two times, and although the first, second, or third fomenting do not
sufficiently ease, yet is the same not to be neglected, for that the alteration
and ease comes not before the fourth or fifth day. When as one has
sufficiently bathed, then is the sweat to be stricken off with the flat of the
hand, and to let the part dry of it self. When as then this fomenting is thus
effected, and whilst that the place is still warm and dry, take of the
foresaid salve of the bigness of a Pease, and rub it behind in the neck upon the
backbone from one shoulder to the other; but warm the hands oftentimes, and so
rub the salve well into it. Thirdly, rub also both the elbowes from the hands,
and likewise also both the knees clean over beneath and above, at last also
the toes beneath and above with as much always of the foresaid salve as the
quantity of a pease, rubbing it therein. When as this is now so done, then is
the patient to rest the space of half an hour after it. He may also once in
ten or fourteen days go into a sweat bath, but not to tarry above one hour
in it, and he is the same day to omit the fomentation: but like as is said, one
is to proceed with the annoynting and resting. This order is also to be
pursued four, five, or six weeks, until he can go again or use the rest of
his joints, by this means have many men found great ease.

Here do follow many more other bathes and salues, to wit, that men are to bath
the space of ten days in decocted Ebulus leaves, and that so long as nature
may abide it. Afterward use this salve following: Take the grease of the juice
of Alps Goats sewet, and Badgers grease, of each a like quantity, make a
salve of it with Wax, and therewith anoint the nummed limbs morning and
evening. Or take Sage, Marioram, Saint John's woort, Hollihocke leaves and the
root, of each two handfuls, Elecampane roots one handful, sees them all
together, as is said.

For to make a precious salve you must have ready a good fat Goose, and roast
the same as if one will eat it, then take good heed that there come no water
unto it, with the neck and the intrailes do therewith what you please. You
must have also ready with it a young, sound, and fat Cat which is three
months old, being a male Cat, kill him and flea him (the head and intrailes
being cast away) chop it small, stamp it afterward in a mortar, and add unto
it three ounces of Barrowes lard, cut it very small, Rosin, Frankincense, and
Wax, of each one ounce and a half, stop these all together into the Goose,
and stop it tight that it fall not out again, and then let it roast by a mild
fire: set a dripping pan underneath it for to receive the fat that droppeth
off: reserve this fat being cold, and anoint therewith every day (in a warm
place) the lame and withered members: in like manner also the swollen, and all
that have any pain: the extenuated and withered joint will increase and grow
again, and al pain shall be assuaged thereby. The Goose is to be well kept, to
the end neither man nor beasts happen to eat it. Another salve: Take the
marrow of a hail gelding which died through any mischance or in the wars, as
much as you please, Hearts sewet half so much, melt them together by a mild
fire and then power Aqua vitae upon it, wring it out afterward very warm
thorough a cloth, and then anoint therewith the diseased place morning and
evening, both these be marvelous good, and also very meet.

Item, take the grease of a Beuer, of a Vultur, and of a Badger, of each half
an ounce, Sage, Penniroyall, and Hollihocke roots with the leaves, of each one
handful: sees well the herbs, and stamp them to grout, then temper the
molten grease amongst it, and anoint the lame place with it.

Take oil of Tyles and oil of Almonds, each alone, or tempered together, and
anoint therewith the members. The Mithridate and both the Treacles do bring
the lamed members to right again, and to their former force, being as well
applied outwardly as taken inwardly: but especially these oils following be
good for it, viz. oil of Juniper, of Nutmegs, of Pepper, and blew Flower
deluce. Item, take a young Fox, make him clean, and chop his flesh very
small, afterward distill out the water, and put therein one dragme of small
bruised Camfer: then put it into a glass stopped well, and so leave it five days
in ye earth where as Ants have their abode. Last of all, anoint you therewith
in a warm bath, afterward use this salve following: Take a young Fox made
very clean and burnt to ashes, take thereof the half, and temper therewith one
quarter of an ounce of bruised Camfere, oil of Balsam half an ounce, Dogs
grease two ounces and a half, Snakes grease one dragme and a half: melt these
salues all together, and anoint you therewith after bathing. Both of these
foresaid salues are to be used against lamenesse through heat and cold, for
that they be of a temperate nature, and of the same nature is this also ensuing.

Take Rice as much as you will, steep it a day and a night in a sufficient
quantity of Goats milk, afterward distill it like as all other waters. This
being done, distill it over again, and make oftentimes the lame members moist
in it.

Of the extenuated or withered members especially.. 3.
FOr as much then as we be entered into this matter, therefore will we not
discourse of the same severally. Albeit this extenuation of the members may
rather be named of their occasions then of the Sciatica alone, notwithstanding
we will not here discourse of the consumption Hectica, Apoplexia, or of the
Pockes, but only of the extenuation of some parts, whether it be of the
Sciatica, or of any other cause whatsoever, for which these salues following be
good: Take wild Cats grease, Hearts sewet, Bears grease, Swines grease, the
marrow of Neates feet, Honey, Dogs grease, and Badgers grease, of each a like
quantity; seethe all together with wine until the same be thoroughly wasted,
afterward power it thorough a cloth and anoint the withered limbs with it.
Item, take Beuercod one ounce, long Pepper one quarter of an ounce, oil of
Wax, of Cammomill, and of Beuercod, of each half an ounce, Wax one ounce,
make a salve thereof: Or take Sage, Mallows, Nettles with the roots,
Cammomill, and sprigs of Juniper, of each one handful, fresh Butter, and Dogs
grease, of each three ounces: chop the herbs and sees them to grout that one
may wring them thorough a course cloth, then put the greases unto it, and let
it sees again together unto a salve. When as now you will use the same, then
are you first to go unto a sweat bath, and afterward your self to be
anointed before a warm furnace or fire upon the place of the disease twice a
day: but you are to use the sweat bath but thrice a week, and do this the
space of fourteen days. This foresaid salve is good for all scabbines. The
salve Dialthaea is fit for this same disease, whereof there be four kinds
described in the third Part, the fourteenth Chapter, and 4..

This ensuing is also very requisite: Take living Crabs and Earthwormes, of
each a like quantity, dry them in an oven, and then stamp them to powder,
afterward temper them with as much Swines grease, and make a salve thereof.
For this are also good two precious B^lsam oils, whereof the one is described
in the second Part, the sixth Chapter, and 4.. and the other in the eight Part,
beginning: Take Myrrha elected, etc.

Item, there is yet more good for this: oil of Tyles, and oil of sweet
Almonds. This ensuing is also accounted for sure, and is many times proved.

Take Earthwoormes, put them in an earthen pot stopped with a cover on the top,
that ye Ants may run in and out, then set it so in the earth where the Ants
abide the space of three or four days, and there will engender a water of it,
with this water anoint the withered limbs very warm, this should be certain
and approved.

In case also that the withered members be oftentimes rubbed with distilled
Calues-gather water which is described before, then shall one find amendment.

But if this lamenesse and extenuation be caused through heat which happens
seldom, then have you a bath for it, which shall be prescribed against the
Podagra. Item, the salve also of Earthwoormes, of Cassy, and other things more
be meet for this intent, therefore it is needles to write here any further of
it, but this foot water following is especially ordained for it.

Take Feuerfew, Stechados, and Cowslips, of each one handful and a half, the
roots of Eringus, and Mallows, of each two handfuls, Mather, Hartwoort, of
each one handful and a half, Peucedanum half a handful, cut them all gross
and let them sees together, afterward wash the feet and the lame hands with
it. You may also use a sweat bath, for that strengthens the lame joints very
much.

Of the hardness of the Joints.. 4.
THere comes sometimes also a hard swelling in the joints, whereby they lose
their motion and bowing: for which these plasters ensuing made hard or soft
are to be used: Take the grounds of the oil of Violets which lie beneath in
the pot, two ounces, two ounces of the oil of Lillies, oil of white Camelina,
and oil of sweet Almonds, of each one ounce and a half, Saffron one scruple,
Badgers grease one ounce, white Wax one quarter of an ounce, Rosin as much as
will suffice.

Item: Take the plaster of Oxycroceum, Sagapenum, Opopanacum, and Ammoniacum,
of each half a dragme, Rosin three quarters of an ounce, white Wax three
drag. the gums are to be dissolved in sharp Vinegar, then put the plaster,
Wax, and Rosin unto it.

If there be any hard byles with it, then take Ammoniacum one ounce and a
half, Pieretrum, and Euphorbium, of each one dragme, Saltpeter half a dragme,
make a plaster thereof with Wax and Rosin.

Herewith will we now conclude the third sort of the gout, and come to the
fourth sort which is the chiefest.

The eight Chapter. Of the Gout or Podagra in the Feet.
THe fourth sort of the Gout, as we have admonished at the first, is the well
known Gout of the feet, Podagra: in which we also contain the Gout of the
hands Chiragra: for that under these two sorts of Gouts there is no great
difference, but that the one does manifest it self in the hands, the other in
the feet: and this kind of Gout is thus described.

Podagra is a defluxion which very painefully assaileth the sinews with heat
and cold, wherewith also the parts adjacent, the joints and the legs be plagued
with swelling and pain.

As much as concerns the name of this disease, which the Latinists have taken
from the Grecians; this name Podagra is nougth else but a snare wherewith birds
be catched by their seete, and therefore is this disease of the Gout likened
unto this instrument, for that it does catch men by the feet, and holds them
caught therewith.

The Poets do also call this disease Scrupeum Humorem, which is a stony
humor: for that the same will in the hands and feet alter into a stone, so
that the same may at last be taken out without any pain: and like as we have
admonished before, this disease comes not only in the feet, but also in the
hands which is called by the Grecians Chiragra, which is a pain of the hands.

The causes of this gout are manifold: to wit inward, and also outward: the
outward may be caused through great heat, which causes the matter to melt.
Item, through great idleness, or through great labor presently after meat: Also
through venerie with a full stomach, and that same especially does cause the
Podagra. Also the learned do certainly affirm, that no man can be plagued
with the Podagra, so long as he has not yet used the veneriall act. Galen does
also confirm the same saying, that he never knew any man which was infected
with the Gout, either of the hands, or feet, before that he has had to do
with women. Dainty eating and drinking is also a great cause of the Podagra.

And that all this is so, we will show an example. Pliny writes that these
diseases were very strange and new in Italy in his time: for which cause it is
named with that outlandish name Podagra. But what made them strange at that
time and new, but that at the same time the Romans lived very moderately in
eating and drinking? Hippocrates writes, that no Eunuch, nor any woman as long
as she has her terms, can get the Podagra, neither yet can be bald: Touching
which, Galen his interpretor says, that the same in the time of Hippocrates
was true: for that the people in those days did meetly much labor, and did
eat and drink soberly. But now he says, that people do lead another life by
going idle and rioting: for that one does find now adays Eunuchs which be
subject to the gout without lying with any woman at all, which they do get only
through their rioting and quaffing. And so is it with women which do also
spoil themselves through a disordred life, that they get their terms very
little or not at all.

And to the contrary by measurable labor, by moderat eating and drinking, yea
by hunger and abstinence from wine, the Podagra tarrieth away and is left
behind, the which I have seen by a citizen in my time of Landsborough called
Lucas Kesselin, who living again according to the pleasure of the world, got
the Podagra again. And when he was best in health, then did he ride otherwhiles
a horseback with two servants who must lift him up upon the horse: but when he
came in poverty and drank no wine, and lived hardly, then did the Podagra
seek another lodging. So that he being past fifty years old, was feign to
trot up and down the country with a Pedlars pack on his back over high
mountains for to get his living.

This has then his original cause: for if there be no superfluous humors
fallen down into those places, then would there be no pain nor grief:
neither would these defluxions settle themselves in the joints if the body
were not ouercharged with some superfluity. Now the mean to keep the body
free from all superfluous humors, is that the body be kept with moderate
exercise, to the end the meat may be well digested.

Hereby appears now sufficiently, that the gout is not caused sooner of any
thing in the world, than of idleness and excessive riot.

When as now the Podagra is caused of any inward occasion, then does it happen
thereby that one having weak legs and feet, the matter, whether it be blood,
Cholera, Phlegma, or Melancholia, each alone or mixed, might lightly fall into
them, whereby it may well be understood, that the Podagra can be short, long
continuing, hot or cold.

It is also sometimes an inheritance of the children from the parents, and has
his virtue in both the seeds, and is imparted unto the children, so that the
goutie fathers and mothers may also engender goutie children.

Now may we also write somewhat of the signs which do not only signify the
gout of the feet or Podagra, but also all pain of the joints.

If this disease be caused through blood, then does it appear with rednes, and
with great continual pain and smart: the urine is thick and red, the pulse
strong and full, and the pain is more in the morning than in the evening. And
if the patient be by nature full of blood and sanguine, then does the same
pain increase daily. The same happens also when the party is young, has
lived easily, and if it be in the spring time.

The signs, if the gout proceed of Cholera: then is the pain sharp, the
place of the pain is yellowish, the urine very red and thin, the ordure is
also yellow and thin, the pulse is swift, the heat is great, and chiefly on
the place of the pain, as one may perceive the same in feeling of it: all
which does yield more assurance if the patient be young and choleric of
nature, and if he have done great labor before, or if the weather be hot, and
he has taken much hot meat and drink.

If this disease come of Phlegma, then is the pain not very great: also the
part of the pain is not altered of color, the urine is whitish and thick,
the going to stool is slimie, and the body in feeling is always cold. And
this manner of gout is commonly always in bodies which be cold of nature, and
that in winter time, and after a disordered life in eating and drinking.

In Melancholicke bodies the Gout comes very seldom, wherewith is also great
pain, the patient will be lean, the urine thin and crude. And this happens
commonly in those bodies which be of a melancholicke nature in the beginning of
winter. Sometimes this disease proceeds through wind, whereby is a great and
exceeding pain, the which by windy meats is increased and augmented.

How the Podagra is to be prevented.. 1.
WHen any one does perceive and is assured, that this his sickness or disease
comes through heat, and that the time be at hand wherein he was wont to be
assailed with it, then must he before whilst that he is well or in good estate
(if he will by any kind of means be freed) be purged with those medicines
which expel Choleram, and must refrain wine, even as all Physicians do advise,
and in stead of these use some thin meade or drink, the decoction of Cinnamom:
for that meade is not only good for the Podagra; but also requisite for all
infirmities of the joints. But if this gout be caused through hot Cholera,
then is Barley water rather commended, or water wherein Prunes be decocted.
Item, temper fresh well water also with the juice of Pomgranats. This also
ensuing may be prepared: Take two ounces of Sugar, one handful of Barley,
Raisins one handful, sees them together in three pints of water unto the
half: and if one will drink wine, then is there one half of this foresaid
water to be tempered amongst it, or to drink some middle sort of clear Beer.
Further, he must forbear all Honey meats, and all flesh. Also he is to eat
and drink very little; but he is to sustain himself with Barley pap, Oaten
pap, bread and butter, and such light meats.

But what greater damages be found in this disease through surfeiting is
sufficiently showed before.

The members also which are accustomably plagued with this pain, are to be
restrained from overmuch motion, or from wearying himself too much, and that
especially if the patient be gross and full of blood, and has not a long time
been let blood nor purged.

Of diverse means whereby to free one from the Podagra.. 2.
THese Pills following are very highly commended, as that through the use of
them many gouty people be not only freed, but also healed altogether: Take
Myrrha, Aloe, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamom, Masticke and Rubarbe, of each one quarter
of an ounce, Muscus five grains: make 36. or 40. pills with Oxymel, or as
many as you please, whereof you are to take two or three every other day, and
to continue thus the space of thirty days: afterward, take every week once
as much more. But if so be that the Podagra do come in the mean while, then
are the pills to be used after the first manner.

First, take Aloe, Rubarbe, Species Hierae Galeni, Pillulae sine quibus, of
each one dragme and a half, field Cipers four scruples steeped in wine: make
pills thereof with Lauander water, and use them as all the rest: they be
stronger than the former.

These Pills following has the Emperor Carolus used against the Podagra: Take
yellow Mirobalani Chebuli, and Indi, of each one dragme, oil of sweet Almonds
one quarter of an ounce, the juice of Roses, of Burrage, and of Fumitorie, of
each two ounces: temper them together, and let them stand in steep 24. hours,
afterward make it hot, and wring it well out. This being all well done, then
steep therein again half an ounce of Rubarbe, Indi Spica half a scruple,
Malmsey a spoonful, Woormwood water one ounce: let it then stand thus together
steeped the space of ten hours, and afterward wring it out hard.

Thirdly, take Agaricus one ounce, stone salt four scruples, Ginger one
scruple, Honey of Roses three scruples, Oxymel of Squils one quarter of an
ounce: steep all together 24. hours in white wine and wring it well out.

Fourthly, take Aloe which is washed with Endive water, and Manna, of each one
ounce, fresh Cassie two ounces, Bdellium two scruples, temper them well
together in the foresaid boiled and steeped Colatures. Lastly, all being well
tempered, then set them all together in the Sun, stirring it often about, and
when it is well dried, then form pills thereof.

Of these pills shall you take one every morning: they have a marvelous
efficacy in preventing the Podagra: so that it is said, if one do not riot,
that one shall be helped thereof in fifteen days. In the first part of this
book in the twelfth Chapter in the description of the Balsam you have a very
costly salve, beginning thus: Take Bayberries, etc. which freeth one marvelous
much of the Podagra. Item, if one set his feet in warm Smiths water, or
foment them over the vapor of the same water: it is also very good to chew
every morning a little Masticke.

How the Podagra is to be purged.. 3.
IF so be that the Podagra be caused only through Cholera and heat, then is
this Sirupe following to be prepared: Take Endive three handfuls, Roses one
ounce and a half; red, white, and yellow Saunders all together one ounce,
sees it well, and wring it out: then put unto this decoction twelve ounces of
Sugar, and sees it to a sirupe like as all other sirupes be decocted: give
thereof one ounce and a half with Endive water four or five times together,
and then take these purgations ensuing after it: Take of the Electuarie of the
juice of Roses five dragmes with the foresaid water, which is especial good
for the joints.

Or take fresh Figs half an ounce, Currants five dragmes, the rinds of yellow
Mirobalans one ounce, let them steep a whole night, and sees them a little:
then take of this decoction three ounces, and temper therein of the foresaid
confection of Roses, and give it very warm early in the morning. Or if you had
rather have pills, then take Aloe one dragme, Diagridij five grains, Roses
three grains, Hermodactyli half a dragme: make pills of it with the juice of
Roses, they be much commended.

If there happen great pain with this kind of hot gout, then may two kinds of
plasters be prepared for it, whereof one is to be laid upon the place of the
pain, therewith to stop the defluxion, and the other on the top of it for to
assuage the pain. The first is thus made: Take Myrtle seed, the seed of Ruscus
and Bolus, of each half an ounce, red and white Saunders, the juice of Sloes,
Pomegranat blossoms and peeles, Gals, of each one dragme, Rose water and
Plantaine water, of each three dragmes, oil of Roses one ounce and a half,
Barley meal as much as will suffice for to make a plaster or pap. The other:
Take red and white Saunders, Starch, and washed Ceruse, of each one quarter of
an ounce, Poppie seed half an ounce, Camfer one scruple, oil of Roses three
ounces, unsalted Butter one ounce and a half, the seed of Fleawort one dragme
and a half, and two yolks of eggs, temper them all together, and lay them upon
it as is before said. An easier. Take the oil of Roses three ounces, Vinegar
half an ounce, temper them all together, and annoint the place of the pain
with it; it asswageth the pain, and hinders the defluxion.

Now when as these defluxions do first of all begin, then be Salues, Oils, and
other things more used and applied unto it, for which you may take one of these
ensuing which you please: Take small pouned Bolus two ounces, Rose water, and
the water of Nightshade, of each one ounce, two or three drops of Vinegar;
temper them well together, and strike it thereon with a feather, or dip a cloth
in it and lay it over the swelling: when it is dry, then take fresh, but
always warm. Item, take oil of Roses, sees Earthwormes in it: Mastick is
also especial good. This following should be a special secret: sees
Earthwormes and Frogs in oil of Roses until they be almost all consumed, then
wring them out hard through a cloth, and annoint it very warm on the place of
the pain. This ensuing is not unlike to the former: Take of the oldest Sallad
oil that you can get, twelve ounces, and twelve water Frogs, chop them very
small and sees them well: when they be almost sodden enough, then temper
therewith the juice of Housleeke, and the juice of Stonecrop, of each two
ounces; then let it sees so long, until that the moisture be wasted away;
afterward wring it out, and use it as before. Some do commend above all
things the muscilage of Frogs to be laid warm unto it, which is thus made:
Take in the Spring green Frogs before they begin to cast their sperme, take
out the bowels, and hang them on a thread to dry in the Sun until they begin
to be somewhat dry, then power Sallad oil unto them, and let them sees meetly
well together, then wring them out, it is especial good for the sinews. Item,
take Badgers grease, and Turpentine, of each one ounce, Frankincense half an
ounce, Wax as much as will suffice for to make a salve of it. Or take Poplar
salve two ounces, small pouned Bolus, and oil of Roses, of each half an
ounce, temper them together unto a salve. This ensuing is also good for it:
Take four yolks of eggs, Saffron one dragme, oil of Roses two ounces, temper
them well together, and use them as before. A principal good one: Take Vine
Snailes as many as you will, put them into a pot, and lay a tin lid upon it;
afterward whelme the same pot over another pot, and then set it over the fire
to the end that they may roast by little and little. This being done, the oil
will drop into the nethermost pot, and with this oil annoint the hot gouts
thoroughly. Item, sees ten eggs very hard, cut them overthwart, fill the whites
with pouned Mirrhe; afterward bind the^ together again, and lay them the
space of 15. days in a seller, or longer, then will a water drop out of it,
which you may anoint upon the gout as a salve. In like manner fresh Cassie is
also much commended, with the muscilage of Fleawort, for all pain of the
joints through heat.

This ensuing asswageth the pain maruellously: Take the seed of Fleawort two
ounces, sees it in sufficient water until it be very slimie, afterward wring
it out very hard through a cloth: In this muscilage or slime melt one ounce and
a half of Wax, Sallad oil three ounces, let it then sees a good while,
stirring it always equally about until it be cold.

Another of like force: Take oil of Walfloures two ounces, oil of sweet
Almonds, and oil of Camelina, of each one ounce and a half, Butter one ounce,
Saffron one dragme and a half, white wax one ounce and a half, Dill seed,
Cammomill, and Ducks grease, of each half an ounce, three yolks of Eggs, then
temper them one amongst another, and make a salve thereof.

Item, take wheat bran two handfuls, Vinecuict as much as will suffice for to
make a poultesse of it, Salt one quarter of an ounce: let it sees a little
together, and then lay it warm upon it, you shall hardly find any thing else
that does more assuage the pain. Item, take Barley meal or Pease meal, and
pouned Roses, of each three ounces, white wine as much as will suffice for to
make pap thereof, then let it sees a good while: if you will, you may also put
a dragme of Mastick unto it.

Some do sees Bran in three parts of water and one part of vinegar, and so lay
it upon it, and let it lie five or six hours upon it.

This also ensuing is thought to assuage all pain whatsoever: Take three
ounces of unripe Sallad oil, Saffron one dragme, four yolks of eggs, oil of
Roses four ounces: let the oil sees a good while, and when it begins to
be cold, then temper the yolks amongst it, stirring it always well about:
afterward Starch and Barley meal of each one ounce and a half, and at the
last Saffron: if you will have it more forcible, then put Butter unto it and
Bdellium, of each one dragme: then steep them all together until the same be
thoroughly consumed, and afterward temper the rest with it. Item, take the crumbs
of white bread, steep them a good while in sweet milk, and then sees them
together to pap: now when it begins to cool, then temper a yolke or two of
eggs amongst it, and a little oil of Roses, and so lay it upon the swelling and
pain. Some do temper Butter, Ducks or Goose grease, and Sugar also amongst it.

Another: Take Plantaine seed, and Linseed, of each two handfuls, sees them
very soft until all the water be almost gone, then temper amongst it crumbs of
white bread as much as you please: afterward stamp them well together, and
temper it with the oil of Roses: and when the pain is very great, then is the
juice of cooling herbs to be tempered amongst it, yea very well three or four
greynes of Opium, and one dragme of Saffron, like as the same may be very well
done in the foresaid crumbs of white bread.

This also following is very good: Take Cammomill, and Melilot, of each one
ounce, Mallows, and Hollyhock roots, of each half a handful, Fenegreeke
meal, Linseed meal, and Barley meal, of each one ounce: cut the herbs small,
and sees them mellow: afterward wring them out, and stamp them well: last of
all, mingle with the said meals oil of Roses, and oil of Cammomill, of each
five ounces or more, then make pap therewith, and lay it over the pain, and
renew the same oftentimes. Item, sees wheat meal and red wine to pap in
fresh sweet milk: for this, is also good Bean meal decocted to pap in fresh
sweet milk. These four oils following be also commonly used for the gout: to
wit, oil of Lillies, of Cammomill, of sweet Almonds, and of Walfloures, with
which we do commonly temper Cassie extracted with vinegar, like as before there
is also mention made of the oil of Poplar buds.

Or take pouned Henbane seed, put it into a bag, and let it warm well, and so
lay it upon the pain. Item, in great outward pain take Cowmilke six ounces,
Opium half a scruple, crumbs of Rye bread, and these being well powdered as much
as you please, make a soft plaster of it. In like manner you may also use the
juice of Nightshade and of Plantaine being tempered all together, or each apart.

By all these foresaid remedies may easily be marked, that all these simple
things following be especial good for the hot Podagra: as namely, Nightshade,
Housleeke, Lettice, Endive, Mirtus, Muscilage of Fleawort, Vinegar, Rose water,
Bolus, etc. in the 16. Chapter, and 4.. of the hot kidneys.

Of the cold gout or Podagra and of his pain.. 4.
IF there be found with the pain of the joints, neither rednes nor heat, and
the patient be of a cold nature, and that one be cold in the feeling, then may
it easily be perceived that the cause proceeds of cold. For this the patient
is to prepare himself to purge with these potions following: Take Sage,
Cowslips, and field Cipers, of each one handful: sees them all together in
sufficient water until the third part be wasted. Unto this decoction put
twelve ounces of Sugar, and then make a clarified sirupe of it. If the matter
be fluxible of it self, then is this following to be prepared: Take Calmus and
Gentian, of each two ounces, Hartwoort one ounce, Saint John's woort, Sage,
field Cipers, Cowslips, Bayberries and Chamaedrios, of each one handful,
Annis, Fennel, and Pionie seed, of each one ounce, Bas^il seed, Cinnamome,
of each half an ounce, sees them all together in sufficient water even to the
half: afterward wring it out, and make it with six ounces of Honey, and nine
ounces of Sugar unto a clarified sirupe; give then one ounce and a half with
some distilled water in the morning fasting. For a purgation is this following
to be used: Take Turbith half an ounce, Hermodactyli one quarter of an ounce,
Diagridij one dragme, Masticke half a scruple, Sugar one ounce: then make a
powder of it, and give thereof the fourth part at once, but no more, for that
it is very strong. If you will, you may make pills thereof without the Sugar: but
the pills of Hermodactyli exceed all other pills, viz. in purging all
phlegmatic humors. They have also an astringent virtue, whereby they obstruct
the conduits where the defluxions take their course. Treacle and Mithridate are
to be taken of goutie men one dragme, or one dragme and a half with great
avail twice a week.

Item: Take field Cipers powned small half a dragme, Turpentine three dragmes:
temper them together, and take it with a wafer, or with fresh broth: it is also
good for all lamenesse. These patients are also to be bathed and fomented with
this ensuing: Take Sage, Rosemary, Penniroyall Rue, Mints, Horehound, Marioram
gentle, Marioram, Lauander, and Pomgranate peeles, of each one handful, sees
them all together in good wine: afterward strain the broth through a cloth,
and put three ounces of butter unto it, and then put the feet therein, whether
it be with pain or without pain, and lay the decocted herbs very warm upon
it.

Item, when the place of the pain is fomented with boiled Fenegreeke, then
will the pain be thereby assuaged. Or take stinging Nettles, sees them in
water and foment with the dampe of the same, and so lay the herbs warm upon
it. The oil of Foxes is also marvelous good for the Podagra, and for all
pain of the joints, like as is also the oil of Tiles, and oil of Sulphur,
which be both hot and piercing.

Hereafter do mo plasters and other things ensue to be laid upon it: and that
after the place of the disease has been fomented or anointed with any salve,
and the affluxe of humors is somewhat ceased: Take boiled Alehoofe and lay it
therein and hold still the feet. Further, it is much advised, that for the
cold Podagra, there shall be two kinds of Plasters prepared. First, take
Cipers nuts, Mastick, Myrrh, and Frankincense, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Gum, Dragagant, of each three dragmes, Sage water six ounces. Vinegar
half an ounce: powne all small that are to be powned, and then make a meetely
soft pap of it, or a plaster with Barley meal, and lay it upon the place of
the pain.

Another: Take the muscilage of Fenegreeke, and of Linseede, of each one ounce,
salt Butter, oil of wite Camelina, or oil of (...), and burnt ashes of
Colewoort stalks, of each two ounces, Wax as much as will suff^ to make a
plaster or salve of it: lay it or spread it upon the pain of the disease, it
asswageth pain: the plaster Diachilon is also to be used for it.

Item, take soft Storax, Beuercod, Euphorbium, Myrrha, Aloe, and the juice of
Sloes, of each a like quantity, Wine as much as you please: let it sees well
together, and then wet a cloth therein and lay over it. Or dip a cloth in the
warm decoction of Ebulus. Before certain plasters are described, of the
crumbs of white bread: temper with one of the same one dragme and a half, or
two dragmes of the powder of Hermodactyli, and so lay upon it. Item, sees
Onions in water, and make a cloth wet in it and lay it thereon. Or roast
certain Onions, stamp them very small, spread it on a cloth and lay it
thereon.

The common people do use Cow dung, and lay it thereon in stead of a plaster.
Also the distilled Cowdung may be laid upon it. Item, take the decoction of
Rape, and lay it thereon. You are also to powne Turnips, and to temper them
with oil of Roses, and to lay the same upon it. In like manner temper sodden,
stamped and well salted Turnips, with about so much Bran as Turnips, and with
sufficient oil of Violets, make a plaster of it. Item, take a bag filled with
Linseede: sees it well, and lay it over the pain. These be now simple things
which warm the joints; to wit, S. John's woort, Hermodactyli, Ammoniacum,
Euphorbium, Myrrha, Squils, Asarabacca, Beuercod, liquid Storax, Cresses,
Cowdung, Marioram, Mints, white Mustard seed, Pine apples, Capers roots, field
Cipers, Cammomill, Elecampane roots, Gailia, Radish, Rue, Sagapenum, and
Vinegar of Squils, etc.

Some do advise, that for the Podagra there be made an issue, which is a
running hole into the leg, which is always to be kept open, whereby the matter
may have issue. How this is to be done, shall be taught in the sixth Part, in
the discourse of the Plague.

Others do raise blisters the breadth of four fingers under the knees on the
outside of the leg, opening the same, and letting the water to run out: whereof
we have in other places mo of this book made declaration.

An especial and well approved remedy for the Gout.. 5.
FIrst is this powder to be prepared: Take two kinds of Chamedryos, which is
field Cypers and Chamedryos, Gentian, Centorie flowers, Rapontica, the right
Aristologia rotunda, (whereof is sufficient store brought out of Switzerland) of
each a like much; stamp each apart: afterward temper them together, and use it
thus. After the necessary purgation, whereof we have sufficiently spoken
before, take the space of forty days together, one dragme every morning of
this said powder in the Summer time with small Beer, and in Winter with Wine
or Meade: Afterward use no more but half a dragme, and so prosecute this
course the space of a whole year.

If so be that the body be bound in the mean while, then is the patient to
use twice every month these pills following: take Masticke, Myrrh, Cinnamom,
Aloe, and Rubarbe, of each one scruple; being all powned small, then make ten
pills thereof with honey of Roses, and take two or three at once. They be very
weak, so that one may use the more thereof if he please. In the mean while
the patient must order himself very moderatly in eating and drinking. Through
this be many goutie persons thoroughly healed of the Podagra.

The direction for the Gout sent to Charles the Emperor.. 6.
THis advice or remedy was sent to the Emperor Charles his Majesty of famous
memory, from Francisco Toralto a Lord in the kingdom of Naples, who had lien
most miserably the space of fourteen years of the Gout: Take clean milk of
a black Goat, and turn it with Figmilke, or if you have it not, wherewith
you will: strain out the whay, and let the rest sees in an earthen pot; scum
it well, and let of three parts twain sees away, and then strain it once
again, to the end there remain no curds in it at all: afterward, take the
uppermost of Burrage a good part, and according to that there is much whay,
with some other things more which be meet for the Podagra, and according to
that the ^gra does proceed through heat or cold, let it steep well therein:
afterward strain it thorough a cloth, and drink of it once or twice a day.
But if so be that the pain be intolerable great, then steep in the foresaid
whay wherein the Burrage and other things be steeped, one drag. or one drag.
and a half of Agaricus: Take of this whay ten or twelve ounces according to
the quality of the sickness, and according as he can easily go to stool, and
temper amongst it Oxymel of honey of Roses, or (which is better) Oxymel of
Squils two ounces: you are to drink of it in the morning as warm as you can,
and to fast four hours after it at least. Further, he is in the mean time to
exercise himself with walking and going: afterward he is during the space of
five or six days to drink of this whay without Agaricus, and that is to be
done once every month.

And he is especially to endeavor himself to drink this in winter, for that it
is sufficient if he do this twice a year. And this is especially to be done
when one perceives that the Podagra is instant, thereby to be free: and
although it appeared already, yet are you to proceed forward with it. What
remedies are then to be used for it, may be seen and chosen out of the
forementioned things. The letting of blood must be principally in the beginning
of yt spring, and before the pain arises; like as one may see and read more
at large in the 2..

But above all things is a good diet commended: for if the same be not kept,
then may all other things help but little. This is now the principallest and
the total of all, that Toraltus communicated to the Emperors Majesty.

The order of diet which is to be observed in this disease, may you perceive by
all that which has been said before, whereof also you shall find all things
more amply described in the beginning of the sixth Chapter, where we have
discoursed of the pain of the hips, that above all other things, Wine is
chiefly forbidden unto all goutie people, as has been before expressed. The
decoction of Cinnamom, Meade, etc. are they to drink, as is there admonished.

When any one does go but ill after the Gout of the feet.. 7.
THis debilitie of the feet does sufficiently show, that there is still some
flegmaticke matter present which ought to be expelled, whereto these pills
ensuing are to be prepared: Take prepared Aloe half an ounce, Coloquint one
dragme, Diagridion half a dragme, Hermodactyli half an ounce: temper them all
together, and make seven pills of one dragme thereof: Afterward, take every
fourteen days six thereof, and fast six hours upon it. In the mean time
is he always the fifth day to take one of them before supper.

Secondly, he is to use this Confection following: Take Species de Xiloaloe,
Species Diatrionpipereon, of each one drag. white Saunders, Violet and Sorrel
seed, of each one scrup. Sugar six ounces decocted in water of Asarabacca, or
water of Parsley: make Sugar plates thereof, and then take daily before noone
and after noone, or at leastwise once a day of it, three dragmes at the least,
and continue this the space of one whole month.

Thirdly, take one pint and a half of Smiths water and sees therein fifteen
or sixteen Cipers nuts, forty or fifty Gals, Hermodactyli, and Pionie roots,
of each one ounce, until the third part be wasted away. He is afterward to
rub the sick person from the knees unto the soles of the feet, letting it be
made moist, to wit, once a day always before meat.

Fourthly, take unripe Sallad oil one ounce, Sandaraca, Masticke, and burnt
Iuorie, of each one dragme: temper this together, and therewith anoint after
the former rubbing, all the parts very warm which be weakened through the
Gout, and continue it thus with rubbing until they be thorougly strengthened
again, and grow to be well.

Fifthly, when the sick person has used certain days to wash and anoint,
and finds nevertheless no perfect amendment: then is this salve following to
be used, like as the other precedent: Take Dragon blood, fine Bolus, Sandaraca,
the juice of Sloes, Mastick, Frankincense, and Myrrh, of each one quarter of
an ounce, Sealed earth and Starch, of each one ounce, the juice of Plantaine,
and of Roses of each one ounce and a half: then temper them a long time
together in a mortar unto a salve.

These be now the very best and necessariest remedies, which of all ancient and
later Physicians be prescribed for all the joints of the body, God almighty the
chief and best Physician give his blessing unto it.

What things they be which convey the medicines toward the joints.. 8.
AMongst al other things which be written of the joints, we have yet to speak
of this: which be the things that convey the medicines toward the joints:
amongst which, the chiefest that are to be esteemed, be roasted Squils, Ginger,
Calmus, which is the right Acorus, Penniroyall, Opopanax, both of the kinds of
Germander, the seed Amomum, and other more.

The ninth Chapter. Of the outward accidents of the joints and members.
FRom the third Chapter hitherto we have discoursed of many kinds of diseases
of the outward members, which are most of all caused through outward causes and
defluxions: here will we now in this last Chapter add certain outward
accidents; as, when the outward members or joints be beaten or strained.

Secondly, we will also admonish somewhat of ye fracture of the bones. And
because that by this there falls otherwhiles some putrefaction of the bones,
therefore will we here also discourse somewhat of it: and because that all this
cannot be effected without great pain, we will show withal, how that the same
pain is to be assuaged. Lastly, how that the numbnesse and insensibleness of
the members may be prevented and cured.

Of strayned members.. 1.
IF any one have strained any one member through falling or beating, and the
same happened to swell without great heat, then take the salve Dialthaea one
ounce, oil of Cammomill and of Dill, of each half an ounce, Wax a little,
and anoint the place therewith.

Another: Take salve of Agrippa, of Althaea, and of the white salve which
follows hereafter, of each half an ounce; temper them together, and anoint
the place affected with it: for which the Alablaster salve is also good.

Item, take Barley meal, Fenegreeke and Linseede, of each one ounce, Mallows
one handful, Wormwood half a handful, Cammomill and Melilot, of each one
handful and a half: the herbs and flowers are you to sees well, and then to
sees the meal amongst it: then are you with oil of Roses to make a soft
plaster or pap of it. Item, take Bean meal three ounces, Cammomill, Roses,
Wormwood, and Bran, of each one handful: the herbs and flowers are you to
sees to pap in good red wine: at last, let the Bran also sees with it, and
then with oil of Roses make a pap or plaster of it. For this disease, it is
also good to open the liver vein, and to let out five or six ounces of blood
according to the ability of the patient. You may also lay fresh Cowdung upon
this disease, and anoint the place about it with Bolus which is tempered with
vinegar. The expert Physicians do advise, that Cow dung should be tempered
amongst oil of Roses.

Item, take the whites of Eggs brayed well, and temper amongst it the powder of
Wormwood as much as you please, and so lay them upon the bruised place.

The golden waters are also commended for this, but they be hot: but if so be
that there be great heat with it, then need not one stay to open the vein,
like as we have said before. But these diseases would be always suppressed
with cooling things: for which you have five kinds of white salues: Take Sallad
oil three quarters of an ounce, white Wax, and Ceruse, of each two ounces, the
white of an egg: the wax and oil are to be melted by a soft fire, and
afterward to be well tempered with the Ceruse, and the white of the egg. This
is not only good for bruised members, but takes away all the blew spots which
be come of falls, blows, and such like occasions. This is the common white
salve which is always ready at the Apothecaries, and is called Vnguentum
Album. The other salve. If so be that you desire to have this forementioned
salve more cooling, then temper half a dragme of Camfere well amongst it, and
this is then called at the Apothecaries Vnguentum Camphoratum. The third white
salve with Camfere. Take six ounces of ye oil of Roses, the whites of three
eggs brayed well, white wax one ounce and a half, Ceruse six ounces, Camfer
broken in Rosewater one dragme: melt the oil and the wax together, and then
afterward temper the Camfer and the whites of eggs amongst it: afterward put
the Ceruse unto it bruised very small, bruise litharge of Gold washed in Rosewater
one dragme and a half, washed Ceruse half an ounce and half a dragme, oil of
Roses three ounces and a half, white wax about three quarters of an ounce:
then melt the oil and the wax together, and temper the Ceruse and Litharge
amongst it until it be thoroughly cold. All these foresaid unguents do cool
all hot swellings, of whatsoever causes the same may proceed: they do repel
all raw places, and they do also cool all the heat of scalding or burning.
The fifth is vnguentum de Cerusa, whereof we have admonished so often in this
book. The same is thus described by Mesua: Take Ceruse, and litharge of Gold,
of each three quarters of an ounce, burnt lead, litharge of Silver, of each
half an ounce, Mastick, Frankincense, of each two dragmes and a half, oil of
Roses and Vinegar, as much as suffiseth for a salve: first power the dry
things into the mortar, and rub it very small: afterward power some Vinegar,
then some oil unto it, stirring it well always about until it be thick
enough. This salve is also good for all salt Phlegma, and for all dry itch.

Of the fractures of bones.. 2.
THese fractures of bones do the Grecians call Catagma. And although the
setting, splinting, and binding of this fracture, and what else belongs unto
it, concerns more the Chirurgians than Physicians; notwithstanding does our
common order and method ask a means whereby this disease might be helped. Of
which there is not a little spoken before, where we have discoursed of the
lamed, extenuated, bruised, and strained members, which all together with the
fractures of bones have a great communion, because they be also caused through
such like occasions. First of all it happens oftentimes in this fracture,
that the marrow in the bones (whereby they be sustained and nourished) is
consumed and dried away: for which, you have a salve in the second Part and the
fourth Chapter, of the marrow of a young Fool, which is marvelous good for it.
In like manner there is also described before in the seventh Chapter, and 2..
yet one more of the marrow of a Stone horse, and other more which be there
recited for the extenuation of the members, and all that is necessary for such
like accidents. You have likewise four kinds of Dialthaea salues in the third
part, the thirteenth Chapter and 4.. which be altogether meet for this.
Neither is the crook back or crooked breast ought else but an eluxation or
fracture of the back bone and ribs, as in the second Part may appear at
large, which may there be seen. The plaster of a Ram is maruellously
commended for this, which is described in the third part, the third Chapter,
and 1..

And for to augment the remedies which may serve for these fractures, we will
add plasters, salues, sparadraps, applications, and all kind of things that
are requisite for the fracture of the bones, which the Chirurgians may use.

Take Wax five ounces and a half, Ammoniacum and Galbanum, of each two
ounces: dissolve the Gum in Vinegar, strain them thorough a cloth, let it
sees until the Vinegar be wasted away, and melt the Wax amongst it.

Then take Cammomill, Balm with the roots, and Mallows, of each one
handful: chop them and stamp them well, afterward sees them in two pound of
May butter, and a pound and a half of Dogs grease, as long as one may sees an
egg hard: this being done, wring it out hard and stir the molten Wax with
the gums amongst it. When it is almost cold, then take one ounce and a half of
Beuercod, oil of Cammomill two ounces and a half, of Bays sixteen ounces,
temper all together and keep it in a pot: this salve do the Chirurgians
esteem to be an especial secret. And if you will use it, then take not too
much at one time; make it warm and rub well the place with it: afterward lay
this fear cloth following upon it.

Take Wax three ounces, Rosin one ounce and a half, Masticke one ounce,
Galbanum, and Frankincense, of each three quarters of an ounce: dissolve the
Galbanum in a little Vinegar; stamp all that is to be stamped; melt the Wax
and Rosin in an ounce of oil: strain it afterward thorough a cloth, and have
a cloth ready as big as the fear cloth must be. Lastly, soke it therein, and
after the anointing apply it upon the place affected.

Others: take four ounces of Sallad oil, melt therein half an ounce of Wax:
when it is almost cold, then stir half an ounce of powned Masticke amongst it,
and use it as before.

Item: Take white Wax, and Frankincense, of each half an ounce, of oil of
Linseed four ounces: melt them all together and draw a cloth thorough it.
Item: Take Wax and fresh Butter, of each a like quantity, melt them together:
these two be especial good against all swellings.

Another: Take Fenegreeke meal as much as you please: sees it in water and
put powned Comfery unto it, until it be as it were grout, then apply it to the
fracture.

Item: Take litharge of Gold, fine Bolus, and Comfery, of each three ounces,
Bean meal one ounce and a half: powne them all together, and power good
Vinegar unto it, and let it stand so one night: afterward put molten Wax and
Rosin unto it, of each three ounces, Sallad oil twelve ounces, then temper
them all together on the fire, and let it sees well until that the Vinegar be
consumed: When it is almost cold, then stir two ounces of powned Dragagant
steeped in Wine or Vinegar amongst it, that it be like unto Gelly. Or take
Rosin five ounces, Saffron, Euphorbium, and long pepper, of each one dragme,
Aqua vitae one ounce and a half, stamp all that is to be stamped: dissolve the
Rosin in Aqua vitae, and then let it sees all together until that the Aqua
vitae be boiled away, then take Wax as much as is needful for a plaster:
this plaster is also very good for all other ruptures.

Item: Take Turpentine, and Wax of each 4. ounces, Galbanum three quarters of
an ounce, Ammoniacum half an ounce: dissolve the gums in wine, and then temper
them all together: when it is almost cold, then put one quarter of an ounce of
Myrrh, and as much Turpentine unto it, and make a plaster of it. In like
manner you have in the third Part, and the third Chap. one more beginning thus:
Take Dragon blood, etc. And yet one other ^n the second part, the third
Chapter, and 5.. beginning thus: Take Pitch, etc. Item, one more in the first
Part, the fifth Chapter, and 1.. which be all together very good for the
fractures of bones.

For the putrefaction of the bones.. 3.
TAke burnt Lead two ounces, Myrrh half an ounce, Aloe, Opopanacum, Iron
dross, burnt Squinant, and the rinds of the Fir tree, of each one dragme, then
make a powder of it, and strew it upon the putrified bone: for it separateth
the same, and heals maruellously.

Take Canterbury bells, powne them small, and strew this powder also upon it.
The same operation has the water also wherein Sal Armoniacke is decocted.

Here follow some especial things for the pain of the joints.. 4.
IT happens also otherwhiles, that in the uttermost parts of the members, as
in the hands and feet, there comes great pain, whether it be of the
foresaid causes, or of something else that has fallen, or been laid upon them,
which may well be caused both of heat and cold.

But if so be that heat cause this pain, then does it appear with redness,
with hardness, and with swelling, which is also a sign of some impostume to
come. But if it be caused through cold, then is the pain without any rednes or
heat: but with deafness, pensiveness, palenesse, and sometime with a dry
itching scurffe.

When as these signs be present, they give commonly to understand, that there
might follow of it a palsy or Paralysis, and an extinguishment of all natural
heat.

If this disease come through some outward causes, then look on the same
parts, whether they be redder than any other. Then is it to be anointed with
cooling oils, as with oil of Roses, of Violets, of water Lillies, and such
like.

The letting of blood is very good for this: as if the pain be in the feet,
then open the vein in the arm on the same side, etc.

If it be caused through drith, and that neither rednes nor whitenes can be
perceived, and nevertheless the member seems to be paler from day to day: then
let warm water fall from on high upon it, and afterward let it be anointed
with the salve which is molten together of oil and white Wax.

But if you will have this salve stronger, then use that Anodinon which is
described in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and 18.. or any other which be
specified in the pain of the Podagra. But if the place be somewhat greater or
swollen up, and that in feeling it be found somewhat coldish, then is it to be
rubbed oftentimes with warm clothes that ye pores or vents might open; and
afterward let this fomenting following be made ready: Take Cammomill,
Marioram, and Stechados, of each one handful; sees them, and hold the member
over the vapor. Or take a sponge being made wet therein, and so lay it warm
upon it: you must also let warm water drop upon it from on high: Afterward
anoint the member with oil of Walflowers, of Costus, of Lillies, or any such
like, which be warm by nature. In eating and drinking he is to keep himself
sober, and to exercise himself much, and to bath. And if so be that this will
not help sufficiently, then is he to be purged of all flegmaticke humors, as
with the pills de Hermodactylis, Foetidis, and Medicamine Turbith. Lastly, and
in need he is to use those things which be described in the first part, the
twelfth Chapter, and 13.. of Paralysis.

Of the insensibleness, shaking, and numbnesse of the Limbs.. 5.
OF all these diseases we have in the first part very largely and amply
written: likewise also every where in the fourth part: which means may also be
used in all these accidents: but especially there be very good for this two
sure golden waters, which shall be hereafter described in the last part amongst
other vital waters, whether it be that they be used outwardly, or drunk
inwardly: for they be good for all diseases of the outward members and joints,
like as is this also following: Take dry Willow wood, and burn it in two pots
one above the other, like as the oil of Juniper wood is wont to be made, and
with the oil that runs out into the neathermost pot, anoint the place
affected the space of nine days.

Another: Take Quinces which rot upon the tree, Beuercod, Bayberries, Sage, and
Juniper berries, of each a like quantity: stamp them, and cut them meetly
gross: afterward sees it all together in good wine, and then rub the joints
with it. These two things aforesaid be very highly commended of the common
people.

If so be that there be any thing discovered, not only that concerns the
fractures of the bones, but also this whole fourth part of the joints and
outward members, wherein may be any want: thereof must advice be had with
expert Physicians and Chirurgians, and so we will conclude therewith this
fourth Part.

The fifth Part of this book comprehends all the Accidents and Diseases,
which do spread themselves abroad over the whole body.
IN the foresaid four parts we have most of all described all outward and
inward parts of man's body, with all their accidental diseases: this fifth part
shall discourse of those things which spread themselves abroad over the whole
body: amongst which, outwardly is the skin, which covers the whole body:
inwardly are the veins, the blood, flesh, sinews and bones. Item, other
accidental things more, as heat, cold, Phlegma, Melancholia, fatnes,
leanness, sleep, sweat, and such like.

To the Skin will we ascribe many kinds of diseases, to wit, what may hurt
the same inwardly and outwardly: as all Impostumes, Ulcers, or Byles, Warts,
Spots, Blisters, Clefts, Itchings, Scurfe, Swellings, Varices, Carbuncles, and
such like. Item many other corroding ulcers, as Fistulac, Cankers, Gangrene,
Pocks, Leprosy, Cacoetes, and many other incurable ulcers. Afterward we will
discourse of such things as hurt the skin on the outside, as burning or
scalding by fire, by water, or gunpowder, splints, thorns, all kind of wounds,
and whatsoever may appertain unto them. Lastly, of Cicatrices, which be left
behind after the cure of the forementioned accidents.

The first Chapter. Of the Skin.
THe Skin is by nature given to all living creatures that have blood in them,
not only for an ornament and defense, but also as a garment of the whole
body, which in one place is found thicker, thinner, and lofter than in another.

The outwardmost skin is of it self insensible, and more fine and thin in
mankind, than in any other creature. The skin within the hand, on the forehead,
and for the most part over the whole face, and on the heels, can hardly be
fleyed off, by reason that they be throughout knit and wouen with sinews and
muscles. In like manner, if there be no flesh with it, and that it were
wounded, it would not be possible to heal the same together again; like as
may be seen in the eye lids, in the foreskin, and other places mo of the body.

What diseases or accidents this skin is subject to, we have discovered it
before, and will also write somewhat more of it hereafter.

Of the inward causes which harm the Skin.. 1.
FOrasmuch as this fifth part of our practice of Physic does not discourse of
any other matter but of ulcers, anguishes, impostumations, and such like
accidents which harm the skin: therefore we will discourse and write somewhat
of it in general at the first, notwithstanding the difference which is
between the ulcers and impostumes; like as in the third part, the 11. Chap.
and 29.. is declared.

Thus will we under the name of impostumations contain all that proceeds and
follows after, which the Physicians do thus describe.

An impostume is a disease or malady, which alters one member or part of the
body from his natural kind, into an unnatural constitution. Or an impostume
is an unnatural Tumor or swelling of a member, through wind, blood, or water,
which has drawn one of these matters unto it.

This impostume may be caused of all the four humors, and also of a several
humor, or of a mixed humor, and that in this manner: When any part is badly
qualified, be it of whatsoever cause it will, or that any bad humors, winds,
waters, or other superfluities have access from any other part which is
stronger than that whither they be sent, which is not able enough to expel the
affluent humors from him: then there do they remain, and putrify, and at the
last impostumate.

When as such kinds of impostumes be caused only of blood, then do the
Grecians call it Phlegmonem, which is an hot swelling, with great pain and
beating.

For if any swellings be caused through Phlegma, or any other waterish
moisture, then be they called Oedema, and it is a soft tumor without pain, and
it is sometimes seen in dead bodies, in hydropicall persons, and in those
parts which are extenuated.

If any swelling be caused through pure Cholera, then is the same called
Ersiypelas, which is the Rose. Of Melancholia comes a hard swelling called
Schirrus, the Canker and such like: which maladies do mix themselves
oftentimes with diverse other swellings, ulcers, and such like: as we shall
especially write hereafter, and discourse of diverse and sundry of them. But
(as is said) we will begin with the first.

Of the Warts.. 2.
HOw ill favored this excrescence of ye skin is to the sight, is sufficiently
known unto all men, whereof there be also many kinds, some altogether dry,
hard, black, and cleft or chopped: others be moist, running, itchie, and where
pain is to be felt in handling them. Their principal cause is a very burnt
melancholicke blood. Therefore ought such things first to be used as withstand
the ingendring of melancholicke blood, as we have elsewhere showed, and shall
hereafter declare more at large.

But amongst the things which may outwardly be used, be these following: Take
Willow rinds and burn them to ashes; afterward mix it with sharp vinegar,
and anoint the warts with it, especially if they stand in a secret place, or
rub them with Asses milk, afterward lay the foresaid on them being spread
upon a cloth, then will they fall off without pain.

Item: Take the juice of Celandine, and the juice of Purslaine, of each one
ounce, oil of Sulphur one dragme and a half: then temper them together, and
anoint them therewith. The same does also oil of Sulphur alone: Take the
juice of Marigolds, and temper it with salve unto a plaster. Some do take
Cranes eyes, and temper them with the juice of Onions and Salt unto a plaster,
and so bind upon it. It is also said that red sealing Wax is very good for it:
Take a garden Snaile, strew it with Salt, put it into a glass, then comes
there an oil of it in the space of two days, then anoint the warts therewith
and they will fall off.

You may also anoint them with the oil of Camelina. If they be so great that
they may be tied with a horse hair or any strong silken thread, then tie the
thread from day to day fast about them, until they dry away and fall off.

With this are you also to note, that when there be many warts together, like
as commonly happens, you must begin first at the greatest, for that they have
such a sympathy one with another, that when the greatest (being as the mother)
has her nourishment taken away, thereby the rest may easily be killed.

Item, burn them with a Rye straw, and take afterward powned Saffron, sees
it in Sallad oil, and then put salt unto it and Swines grease, to the end it
may be as a salve, and then lay it upon them.

For this is also meet all that which is discovered in the fourth part the
second Chapter and 3.. for the Corns. The warts require also a moderate diet,
and that he forbear all that might engender melancholicke blood.

Of the Measels, red Gum, and of the small Pockes in general.. 3.
CHildren are for the most part subject unto these diseases, and also ancient
folks otherwhiles. And like as the same be perilous in young children, so be
they more perilous in ancient people. They do come also through many kinds of
means, sometimes like red spots: also with waterish blisters which outwardly
appear clean over ones body upon the skin, as big as Millet seed, which at
last dry away and fall off. These be also (to tell the troth) not without
great danger, especially if they happen through cold not to break out: or if
they have appeared already upon the skin on the outside, and be stricken in
again; for thereby do they make a narrowness of the breast, a short breath,
hoarsenesse, disease of the throat, or of the mouth, and anguish of the whole
body, with great Agues.

The learned have sought out the causes of this breaking out of the small
Pocks, Measels, and such like: therefore be they of opinion, that one brings
the cause of this sickness with him out of his mothers womb when he is borne.
For that because as the fruit is nourished of the finest blood of his mothers
Terms: so does the uncleanness of that blood remain in the pores of the
children, and in other places mo, which nature afterward drives out in due
time.

And because that all humane creatures be through such means and nourishment
sustained and fed in their mothers womb, therefore does it seldom happen, that
any kind of people can be old, without getting these Pocks or Measels, whereof
this common false opinion is spread and grown amongst many people, that all
children must once have these Pocks or Measels, whereby many mothers which have
many children, if any of them get the Pockes or Measels, let them run one
amongst another, whereby one child is infected of another, and so do catch the
Pocks or Measels: saying besides the truth, that it is better that they get
them in their childhood, than when they be grown in years. But this is none
other (like as I have said) but a false opinion, for one may be freed of this
sickness through a good diet.

There be also other causes mo concerning these maladies, viz. stinking air,
which does heat the blood and other humors of the body, and troubles them.
Like as to be long conversant in the warm Sun: also to ouercharge him with
such meat which quickly corrupts in the stomach, as fish and milk eaten
together, through much bad blood, through omitting an accustomed letting of
blood, and such like causes more.

The signs of these sicknesses be pain of the back, itch of the ears and of
the nose, which come of the vapors of the corrupt matter, and are partly
pestilentiall: therefore they have a frightfull sleep, and the pricking may be
felt over the whole body. With this they have also a slothfulness in all
parts, redness of the face and of the eyes, and somewhat swelling: and they be
so long pinched with sleepiness, until the Pockes do break out upon them
every where.

And although (like as we have admonished) the Measels and the Pocks have one
kind of cause, yet we will discourse of each apart, as much as is possible.

Of the Measels.. 4.
THis is (as we have said) a common infirmity of children, and it also
assayleth ancient and full grown people, so that they over the whole body
(some less, othersome more) are besprinkled with red spots. There is also
great heat oftentimes with it, and a pursiuenesse in the breast. In this
sickness must one beware especially of cold, yea of open air, and of hot meat
and drink. And ancient persons are to order themselves, as we shall show in
discourse of the small Pocks. Common people do especially commend the Conserve
of Eldern flowers, and the same rubbed upon the heated parts. But what is
further convenient for this purpose, you may make choice thereof according to
the importance of the cause, out of the description ensuing of the small
Pockes, what shall like you best.

Of the small Pockes.. 5.
WHen as Children be assailed with these foresaid Measels or Pockes, and they
will not break out, then take oil of Cammomill and good Wine, of each one
ounce and a half, Saltpeter one dragme, sees it together until all the Wine
be wasted, and anoint the whole body with it when it is very well warmed.
This potion following is very good for all aged people, and also for all young
children. Take Citron peels one quarter of an ounce, sower Dates one quarter of
an ounce, Cicorie roots half an ounce, the flowers of Buglosse and of Burrage,
of each half a handful: sees them together in a pint of water until about
the third part be consumed: afterward strain it, and temper amongst it Sir.
Acetositatis Citri two ounces, de Corticibus Citri, de Succo Acetoso, of each
one ounce: give oftentimes a little of it, for it is very meet and pleasant.

Item, take Olive leaves two handfuls, Agrimonie one handful: sees it all
together in good Wine, and drink thereof every morning three or four
spoonfuls: it dries up all affluent humors. But when these Pockes begin to fall
away, then are these means following to be used, according to the importance of
the cause: Take Ceruse half an ounce, oil of Roses one ounce and a half,
Camfere the quantity of a Pease, Saltpeter half a drag. and two or three
peeled Almonds, wherewith you are to chafe the Camfere. Afterward temper one
amongst the other, and therewith anoint the place of the Pockes: Or take
Sallad oil, and Ceruse as before: then temper them together with a little
Vinegar and Rosewater, and use it as before. Some do also advise to take strong
lie, which is hereafter described against the burning of gunpowder.

Another sort of small Pockes, which be called Swine pockes.. 6.
LIke as we have said before, these kind of Pockes be much like to the other
before mentioned, and proceed also of the same cause, saving only that these
whereof we now write, be bigger, broader, and also with greater anguish of the
breast and of the breath: therefore may all be used for this, that is expressed
for the trobled breast in the second Part, the fifth Chapter, and 9.. as well in
old as in young people. But especially is this salve following to be ordained
for it: Take fresh Butter, oil of sweet Almonds, and Goose grease, of each
half an ounce, Wax as much as is needful. Some do put unto it half an ounce
of Turpentine, and one ounce of liquid Storax: this is especial good, and also
approved oftentimes.

Aged people be much advised to eat none other thing but Barley pap, or Oaten
paps, and to drink Barley water. Take fourteen or fifteen Figs, Pistacies
one quarter of an ounce, Fennel seed, the seeds of Smallage and Lacca, of
each three dragmes, Lentils one ounce and a half, Dragagant half a dragme,
Roses, Saunders, burnt Iuorie, and Quince kernels, of each half an ounce;
sees them all together in three quarts of Water, until a third part be
wasted, and then drink a good draught thereof in the morning and evening. He
is also to use oftentimes Oxysaechara, conserve of Roses, conserve of Rasps,
the sirupe of Sorrel, of Veriuice, and of Quinces, to make the blood thick
with it, and to cool it. There is especially commended for this, the water of
Lentils when it is boiled in the third liquor, to wit, the two first being
powered out. If now it be feared that the Pockes should hurt the eyes, then is
this following to be used for it: Take Lycium, the juice of Sloes, and Saffron,
of each one dragme, Camfere one scruple; temper this all together in Rosewater,
and drop it oftentimes into the eyes. If so be that now any Pocks or any rednes
be perceived on the apple of the eye, then use Sief album, and that according
to the quality of the cause: for which you may look into the Register, where
you shall find also the manner to make it. But if there do come any
exulceration in the throat or mouth, then cleanse the same with Barley water,
wherein sirupe of Mulberries, wine of Pomegranates, and such like be decocted,
and drink the same also softly. The juice of Mints is also to be drawn up
through the nose, tempered with Saunders, Veriuice and Vinegar: the same also
fumed is good for it. Now when as the Pockes do anguish the Lights, then use
Diapapauer. If there be any hoarsnes or roughnes of the throat then look what
is good for it in the place where we discourse of it. For which is also this
gargarisation to be made with Licorice, Iuiubes, Sebestes, and Figs decocted in
water, and a little Dragagant dissolved in it, and then to cleanse the mouth
with it, and sometime to swallow down some of it. When as there is no ague
with it, then is it very good that one drink warm Goats milk. Now for to
free the intrailes from the Pockes, roasted Quinces are to be taken with Sugar,
or the sirupe of the same. If a scowring happen with it, look what is
described in the third part, the eleventh chapter, and 13.. Lastly, all
renowned and famous Physicians do advise (against the opinion of the common
people) that one should about the seventh day open the Pockes, if they be ripe,
with a golden needle, for to let out the matter, to the end that through their
sharpness they should not eat inward, and leave great Cicatrises behind them.
Make also a powder with Salt, Lentils meal, Bean meal, Pease meal, litharge
of gold, and Ceruse: strew the parts with it, to the end that thereby the
matter may dry. All which cannot be hurtful.

If so be that after healing of the Pockes there do remain great dents, pits,
or scars, then may these things ensuing be used.

Take Sarcocolla, Melon seed, washed Rice, whites of Eggs, Chalk, Bolus, or
white Sugar: temper them with the oil of Roses, or the oil of Lillies, and
therewith anoint the Cicatrises. Or in steed of the oil, take Hens grease.

Item, take the Caul of a young Goat or Kid, power Goats milk upon it, then
set it so in the Sun, and power fresh milk every day upon it the space of one
week: afterward lay it the space of four days in Rosewater, and then hang
it up to dry. This being done shread it small, and put it into a silver
beaker, and set it in boiling water: when it is molten, then strain it
thorough a cloth, and anoint therewith the marks and small Pockes.

Of clefts in the Skin.. 7.
YOu have in the first Part, the ninth Chapter, and 1.. of the clifts in the
lips. Item, in the third part, the fifth Chapter, and 2.. in the description of
the places in women. And in the tenth Chapter, and 11.. of the clifts in the
Arsegut. Also in the fourth part, the first Chapter, and 7.. of the clifts in
the hands: all which remedies there described may be used for this our intent,
and also all these that follow.

Take the green rind of the Elder, steep it in a sufficient quantity of
Sallad oil, boil them together, wring them out hard, and with Wax make a
salve of them. This salve is also very good to be used against the burning fire.

Item, take oil of Roses, white Wax, Frankincense, Masticke, and Hens grease,
of each half an ounce, Ginger half a dragme; melt the Wax, the oil, and the
grease together, and temper the rest amongst it.

Of the itch in the skin.. 8.
BEfore we begin to write of the Scabs, we will first entreat of the dry itch
of the skin. This is called in Latin Pruritus, which is a desire to rub and
scratch, either the whole body or some part of it, by reason of the great
itch, which is caused of some sharp humors, which do yet lie under the skin.

Also, if the humors (which are stirred up either by heat or by labor) be so
tough, that they cannot transpirate through the skin and ye pores of the same,
then do they cause an itch. Also Lice, Fleas, Ants, and Woodlice, do cause an
itch. Item, if one do but seldom change his apparel.

The inward causes may be an over great heat of the liver, which does engender
sharp and adust humors: also, debilitie of the virtue expulsive, as does
appear in aged folks. The signs of this itch are manifest, as that a body
cannot sleep for it, and is hindered from doing his business aright.

Now to come to the remedies of the itch, the patient shall have a vein
opened, be purged, and almost observe the same order which hereafter is
prescribed against scabbednesse. A sweating bath and water baths are specially
commended for this purpose, which being once used, and not turning away the
itch, show that the humors in quantity do abound, which cause the same. This
bathing is to be reiterated, and the body to be rubbed where it itcheth most
with this receipt following: Take white Roses two ounces, beat them thoroughly
with Vinegar, and add one ounce of Bran unto them. The next day following bath
again, and rub your body with powned Smallage, with green Nutshels, or with
Fenegreeke. These itchie patients are to forbear all manner of Salt and hot
things, and especially all that might inflame or burn the blood.

If this itch be about the yard or member of a man, then take a quarter of an
ounce of Ceruse Sulphur vife one dragme and a half, Opium half a dragme; make
a salve of it with Vinegar: some do add two scruples of beaten Licebane unto
it. If this itch be in the Arsegut, or in the womb, then take burnt Allume one
quarter of an ounce, Argall one ounce, temper them with vinegar, spread it on a
cloth and so apply it.

Of Scabbednesse.. 9.
SCabbednes is of diverse kinds, some with scales, some with blisters, some with
matter, and some without matter, some dry and red; but all of them with an
intolerable itch, according to the nature of the humors which cause the same,
and are mixed with the blood.

The cause of this infirmity, are the uses of all kind of hot, sharp, salt,
and bitter meats, as spices, strong wine, oil, honey, want of change in
apparel to lie or deal with them that be scabbed, with many other inward
causes, that proceed of an inflamed and corrupted blood.

The signs of all manner of scabbednes are apparent: but of what kind of humor
the same is caused, shall appear by these reasons following. If it be caused
of blood, that may be known by the repletion of the body, rednes of the parts,
and if the blood or matter do issue forth in the scratching: The patient has
also commonly a sweet taste in the mouth. But if this scabbednes be caused of a
salt phlegm, then is the skin yellowish, scaly, and reasonably full of matter:
the patient cannot be quiet for the itch, and after scratching finds great
pain and smarting. If it proceed of Cholera, then perceives he not only a
great drought in the joints, but also in the scabs themselves, with pricking,
burning, and small store of moisture: or if it be caused of Melancholy, then is
the skin blackish, dry, with many scales, and without matter.

Now for to cure this common and well known grief, are these rules following
to be observed diligently. First, because the common cause of this disease is
gross and foul blood, first of all a vein ought to be opened. Secondly,
after the letting of blood, is the body to be purged, and especially with
Mirobalans, and Fumitorie. Thirdly, because the itch and scabbednes are
engendered of salt, sharp, sweet, and spiced meats, are the same wholly to be
forborne. Fourthly, venery is to be shunned, because thereby the humor is
drawn to the outside of the body, where it does raise hot and stinking
vapors, that disperse themselves under the skin. Fifthly, bathing, inunction,
and whatsoever else may be used outwardly, does small ease, unless the body be
first thoroughly purged. Sixthly, in eating and drinking refrain all salt,
sharp, sweet, and hot things. Seventhly, sour and moist meats that do not
suddenly putrify in the stomach, are good for him. Eighthly, because Peaches
and some other herbs, also fish, milk, and such like do corrupt the blood,
they are to be shunned. Ninthly, the patient must forbear scratching as much
as is possible, for thereby little pushes are turned into great scabs. Tenthly,
the moister that the scabbednes is, the stronger remedies does it require.

As concerning the cure of this infirmity, the opening of the Median or Liver
vein is not to be omitted, and that as long as the patient can endure it. Then
is the humor to be prepared with Oxysacchara, sirupe of Fumitorie, and Pease
broth: afterward to purge with Cassy, with sour Dates, with Mirobalans, with
Dodoer, or with Rubarb infused or sodden in whay of milk, but above all other
things is Fumitorie commended, whether it be the juice, the sirupe, the
conserve, or decoctiue potions, or whatsoever else may be made of it.

Seen leaves do the same, whereof thou may use those two kinds of potions in
this scabbednes, which are described in the third Part and 20..

Item, take powned Seen leaves one drag. strew them upon stewed Currants, and so
eat them daily: use them so long, till thou be loose in body, and as thy
stomach will suffer thee. Some do commend the golden water which is described
in the last Part, if a little of it be taken either inwardly, or anointed on
the scabbednesse outwardly. After that the body has been thoroughly purged, it
is a common order to bath, otherwhiles in fair water, otherwhiles also in
natural dry baths, each as you like it best. But those that cannot intend to
travail to the dry bathes, may take Salt, Allume, Brimstone, Argall and such
like, according as the scabbednes does require, and so with water make a bath
of them.

There are also many kinds of salues and oils ordained for it, whereof diverse
shall be specified at this present: Take litharge of Silver finely powdered two
ounces, Vinegar four ounces, boil them together until one third part be
wasted, then add two ounces of oil of Olives unto it, one ounce of Ceruse,
then boil them together until they be thick, stirring them continually.

Another: Take Ceruse two ounces, litharge of Silver one ounce, Masticke, and
Frankincense, of each two dragmes; beat them all together to fine powder, and
mix them with three ounces of the oil of Olives, and in the tempering of them
power now and then four or five drops of Rosewater and Vinegar unto them.

In like manner you have also in the fourth Part, the ninth Chapter and 1..
five kinds of white salues, which one may also use with all security for
scabbednesse.

Item, in the first Part, the third Chapter, and 10.. there is a good salve
beginning thus: Take Turpentine, etc.

Item, take Bayberries, Vinegar, and oil of Olives as much as you please, and
temper them all together to a salve, it is very good and safe. Take the roots
of Bistorta one dragme, prepared Sarcocolla two dragmes and a half, Sandaraca
four scruples, prepared Tutia one scruple, Turpentine washed with water of
Fumitorie four ounces, Camfer half a scruple; temper amongst it six ounces
of the next following salve of Elecampane roots.

Take the juice of Elecampane roots, and of Dock roots, of each three ounces,
Saltpeter, Sarcocolla, the lytharge of Silver, and Masticke, of each fifteen
grains, Coperas and Allume, (called lamemum) of each two scruples, mortified
Quicksiluer one dragme, Butter two drag. and a half, Turpentine one ounce and
a half, Pitch one ounce: the Butter, Pitch, and Turpentine must you melt
together, and afterward temper the other ingredients amongst it, and let it
sees with a soft fire until all the juices be consumed: you are then to
anoint the patient therewith by a good fire, and that especially on the places
where the most scabbednesse is; this salve draws the corruption outward.

Another: take washed Turpentine two ounces, washed Butter one ounce, Salt half
an ounce, the juice of three Limons, two yolks of Eggs brayed, oil of Roses
half an ounce, or as much as is needful for to make a thin salve: then temper
it all together, it is a safe salve.

In the fourth Part, the seventh Chapter, and 3.. you have also a good salve,
beginning thus: Take Sage, Mallows, etc. which one may use very safely for all
manner of scabs. Or take Dock roots, powne them very small, temper vinegar
amongst it, and salt it well: with this are you to rub your self well in the
bath when you will go out of it, without wetting your self after it.

Item, take Dock roots, and Hollihocke roots, of each two ounces and a half,
Hellebore roots one ounce, Smallage half a handful; sees them all together
in fresh well water until the third part be wasted: strain it, and put into
this decoction one ounce and a half of Salt, Saltpeter one quarter of an
ounce; fresh Butter, and oil of Roses, of each two ounces: let it sees the
second time until all the moisture be consumed, afterward temper amongst it
washed Turpentine one ounce, Treacle three dragmes, the juice of Limons or of
Oranges two ounces, lastly, temper them all together.

Item, take the juice of Mints, liquid Storax, of each one ounce and a half,
Salt three ounces, oil of Roses two ounces and a half, and make a salve
thereof.

The plaster Diachilon may also be well melted in oil of Roses, for the same
use: Sulphur vife tempered with Turpentine, is also much commended for this. Or
make it thus: Take Sulphur vife half an ounce, Salt as much also stamped small
together, Sallad oil two ounces, then make it to a salve with Wax, as thick
as you desire. Take Ashes, Salt, and Sulphur, of each one ounce, bind them all
together in a fine cloth, and then sees it in four ounces of Sallad oil, and
rub the scabbednes therewith.

Another. Take Turpentine, which is washed well with Rose water two ounces, oil
of Roses, oil of Costus, and fresh Butter, of each half an ounce, Sulphur
vife three dragms, Saltpeter one quarter of an ounce, and two yolks of Eggs,
then temper it upon warm ashes. Item, take washed Turpentine six ounces,
quick Lime two ounces, Soote of the chimney one quarter of an ounce, and
temper them all together.

This salve following is much stronger than the forementioned: take of the
salve of Elecampane roots, not long since described, nine ounces, Myrrh,
Swines bread, Hartwort, powned all together very small, of each one quarter of
an ounce, Bean meal two ounces, Seen powder one quarter of an ounce, Sal
gemmae two scrup. temper them all together unto a salve.

Some do take fresh Butter and Swines bread, of each four ounces, Ceruse three
dragmes, Quicksiluer one dragme, stir them so long together that you see the
Quicksiluer no more, and therewith anoint the place infected once a day.

Other do make it thus: They do take powned Bayberries, and fresh May butter,
of each four ounces, and melt it by the fire: when it is a little cold, then
mix one dragme of Quicksiluer amongst it, and afterward the Bayberries, juice
of Nightshade, and juice of Mallows, of each three quarters of an ounce: if
one cannot get the juices, then take the powned herbs, and if so be that the
salve be not tough enough, then put a little Turpentine unto it.

Item, take man's grease, Rose water, and Quicksiluer, each according to his
weight, like as it is said before in this last salve, and anoint therewith the
scabbed place once a day.

Another: Take a small Cruise full of rain water, and put therein one dragme
of Mercury sublimati, so let it sees together in a glass with a narrow neck
by a soft fire: and when it is cold, then temper therewith the juice of Limons,
and Rosewater, of each half an ounce, and use it as before. Some do take Aqua
vitae, and therein do they sees a little Quicksiluer, and therewith anoint
the scabs.

Item, take Swines grease two ounces and a half, oil of Bayberries one ounce,
mortified Quicksiluer, Frankincense and Masticke, of each one dragme, Salt two
ounces, the juice of Plantaine and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a half:
lastly, temper one scruple of Orpiment with it. Or take Barrowes grease twelve
ounces, Quicksiluer mortified with vinegar half an ounce, oil of Roses one
ounce, Frankincense, Mastick, Myrrh, Sarcocolla, and litharge of Silver, of
each half a dragme, Turpentine three ounces which is washed well in the juice
of Fumitorie, Wax half an ounce, the two last are to be molten together, and
temper the Barrowes grease amongst it, and at last the other powders: then
stir all well together until it be cold. With this salve is the patient to
anoint himself twice a day the space of five days, and the other six or
eight days afterward, then is he to wash him with this water following:

Take Docke roots and Elecampane roots both cut, of each six ounces, Bran
six handfuls, Mallows, Violet leaves, and Fumitorie, of each twelve ounces,
sees all together in sufficient water, that one may bath therein, sit in it
meetly warm, and coming out of the bath, lay your self about the space of an
hour in bed.

But here is to be noted, that the salues which be tempered with Quicksiluer,
are more meet for the pockes then for scabs, as hereafter shall be showed in
more ample manner.

If any body be plagued with a troublesome scabbednes, which proceeds from a
salt melancholicke matter: then take the juice of Elecampane roots, and of
Docke roots, of each half an ounce, liquid Storax, black Hellebore, and
prepared Tuttie, of each two scruples; temper these all together in a leaden
mortar, four or five hours together unto a salve.

It happens also otherwhiles, that by some disease of the stomach or of the
liver, this disease does grow, and does so spread it self over the whole
body, that one supposes certainly that it is a right leprosy. For this do
all expert Physicians know good advice, with letting of blood and purging at ye
first. And for this kind of scabs is this remedy following found, wherein I my
self have found marvelous operations: take oil of bitter Almonds sixteen
ounces, fifty common Creuets, powne them, and let them sees in the oil:
afterward wring them hard through a cloth, and temper amongst it eight ounces
of the oil of Eggs, and anoint you therewith twice a day. For this is also
good Sallad oil, wherein Frogs be decocted. Item, take a water Snake, cut off
the head and the tail and cast it away, afterward cut the rest in small
pieces, and sees them in oil and strain it.

In like manner you have also in the fourth Part, the first Chapter, and 8..
against the scabbed hands a salve, beginning thus: Take Docke roots, etc.
which is very meet for this kind of scab, and exceeds also all others. The
oil of Elderne flowers does cleanse, and mollifieth and takes all scabbednes
away from the hands. The oil of Eggs is very commodious of it self for all
sharp scabs, likewise also the oil of Tiles. Juniper oil, whether it be
drawn out of the wood, or out of the seed, does expel all infection of the
skin, although it were a Canker, or any old ulcer. Also, oil distilled out of
Wheat is much commended for the same.

We have also in the fourth Part, the first Chapter, and 6.. other remedies more
against the scabbednesse and the soreness, which may be used for this, and
over the whole body. Also, the maiden milk is very good for this, which is
described in the first Part, the 5. Chapter, and 1..

Of Tumors.. 10.
BEcause we have sufficiently before discoursed of scabbednes, therefore we
will now speak and discourse of certain swellings, which assail the skin and
the flesh under it. And because there can be no impostumes without swelling or
rankling, as also all swelling may be caused of blows, falls, wounds, fractures
of bones, and such like: therefore it is needless to spend any longer time
therein, every one may himself seek in the Register for the member, wherein
every such swelling does manifest it self, where may be found perfect
direction for all: wherefore we will only here declare certain common rules.

First, is a Nutmeg very good for to cleanse all corruption of the blood, and
that especially for the swelling of the milt: Conserve of Eldern berries does
also cure all inward swelling. In like manner does Conserve of the same flowers
expel all scourings of the belly. Four or five Figs eaten twice a day are
also very meet in all swellings. Amongst oils which may be anointed on the
outside, are these following: to wit, oil of Mints, of Dill, or Lillies, and
Tiles. And amongst all salues, the salve Althaea.

There is a kind of swelling, which is soft, without pain, and which spreads
it self far abroad, which the Grecians do call Oedema, which ingendreth of
wind and cold humors: with this manner of swelling are commonly hydropicall
patients troubled, and those that have the Consumption, or any other long
lingering disease. This swelling is also in the foresaid sickness no cause of
the same, but only an accident; so that the same has no need of any special
remedy, but only to apply unto it Oxyrhodinum, tempered with salt, or salted
Sallad oil.

Of all Botches, Byles, and other hard swellings.. 11.
NOw if there appear any hard swellings, Botches, Byles, or Wennes in any
place of the body, and that at last there befall with it heat, or rednes with
pain, without inclining nevertheless to impostumation; then do the Grecians call
the same Ph^egmonas: But this name comprehends many kinds of swellings, for
that by the name Phlegmone be understood all the swellings of the groines, the
Bubones and such like more, because that the same be caused of one kind of
cause, viz. of blood and Cholera. These swellings may also be caused of falls,
of blows, or of thrusts, through which the humors be drawn toward the
bruised place, and there being gathered together, do make such tumors,
impostumations, and other swellings. Besides that it happens so much the
sooner, if a body be plethoricke and full of blood.

The signs of these foresaid swellings, are heat, redness, pain, and
beating, which is felt deep in the flesh, the whole member where this
impostume is, thereby appears distempered with heat and inflammation, with
great swellings, and desire of cooling things.

And when as the member is more sinewie wherein this impostume comes, so much
greater is the pain: and how much more fleshly it is, so much is the pain and
the pricking the less, and comes easier to a perfect impostumation. Now for
to remedy these kinds of swellings, must we note certain rules.

First, if the patient be plethoricke, then is one of his veins to be opened,
and that always in the side where the swelling is not, and according to the
situation of the place where the swelling appears. Secondly, if the matter be
hot, then must one give the patient those medicines which allay the heat.
Thirdly, when the matter is well purged, then are repulsiue remedies to be used
upon the swelling, if it be not that the swelling stand in such a place, whereby
nature is wont to expel all superfluity from her. Fourthly, amongst the
things which hinder repulsion be gross and tough humors, cold and abundance of
the matter. Fifthly, if so be that a swelling be great, and it seem to be
inclined to impostumation, then are no repulsiue things to be used, but only
maturatiues. Sixthly, when it is certain that the impostume is ripe, and full
of corruption, then is the same to be immediately opened, and especially if it
stand near some noble part; for that if one delayed the opening too long, then
might the matter eat inward, and do more hurt. Seventhly, the healing of this
hot impostume, consists only in staying of the affluent humors, and in
discussing the matter present.

Now for to heal this impostume, one must imitate the first rule, and in the
beginning open the vein on the contrary side. But if so be that the tumor have
already continued three or four days, and the same were very big, then is
the vein to be opened on the same side where the swelling is. The patient is
also to be purged with sour Dates, with Cassie, with sirupe of Roses, with the
Confection of the juice of Roses, or such like, and lay upon it repulsiue
medicaments for to lessen the power of the swelling, as cold herbs, Purslaine,
Gourds, Endive, and Nightshade powned, and their juices.

When as now the cause is come to the state, and to the highest, then are
maturatiues to be used, whereof here be diverse discovered.

Some pocke Physicians do advise, that do not know better, or they that gladly
hold the matter long in their hands, that the swelling is the space of thirty
days together to be fomented with Marchasita, but that is very needless.

This confection following is of the same quality, and therefore to be also
omitted: Take Scrophularia, Polypody roots, Betony and swines bread, of each
one dragme, poune them small together, and being tempered with three ounces of
Sugar, make a confection thereof. For to apply unto it might this aforesaid be
borne withal in some sort, for that it mollifieth all hard swellings, like as
many other plasters do.

Take the muscilage of Hollihocke roots, of Fenegreeke, and of Linseed, of
each one ounce and a half, Barley meal two ounces, oil of Lillies and Hens
grease, of each one ounce, Butter half an ounce, Saffron half a scruple, and
one yolke of an egg: sees the muscilage with meal by a mild fire, and at
last stir the yolke of the egg amongst it. This plaster mollifieth all
swellings which be mixed with cold and heat: it swageth also the pain in all
the sinewy parts, and such like things more. Will you now use it for all cold
swellings? then temper amongst it Ammoniacum, Bdellium, and liquid Storax, of
each half an ounce, wher^with it is very commodious to mollify and ripen all
hard swellings.

Another. Take Cammomill one handful, sees it in good wine even to the half,
then temper amongst it Sallad oil and Butter, of each one ounce and a half,
and as much Barley meal, until it be a pap; then lay it upon the tumor, it
ripeneth and mollifieth all hardness.

Item, take Cammomill, Melilot, Roses, Dill seed, Fenegreeke, Hollyhock seed,
and Linseed, of each one handful, oil of Lillies, and unsalted butter, of
each two ounces, Saffron one scruple, temper them together by a soft fire unto
a plaster, it mollifieth all hardness, and eases the pain.

Another. Take Cammomill, Melilot, Mallows, and Hollyhock flowers, of each one
handful, Barley meal one ounce, oil of Lillies and of Cammomill, of each one
ounce and a half: sees the flowers in sufficient water unto the half, wring
it out well, and poune it: put then the oil and meal unto it; this plaster
has the same operation with the other. Yet one mo, which is very good:

Take Hens grease, Goose grease, and marrow of Neats feet, of each one ounce,
Muscilage of Hollyhock roots, of Fenegreeke, and of Linseed, of each one
ounce, Bdellium, Galbanum, and Ammoniacum, of each one ounce and a half:
dissolve the gums in two ounces of oil of Lillies, and then melt them with the
grease and slime. Then poune 24. or 25. fat Figs amongst it, and stir them
all together, and lay thereof upon the swelling. For to annoint, is this
following to be prepared: Take Bean meal, Allume, Polypody roots, Swines
bred, wild Cucumbers, Hartwort, Scrophularia, of each alike quantity beaten,
Sallad oil as much as is needful for to make a salve thereof. This is a very
strong salve.

Take well decocted Rosemary roots, and temper them with Honey: Item, take oil
of Roses one ounce and a half, washed Turpentine two ounces, Mirrha half an
ounce, the yolks of two eggs, Barley meal as much as is needful for to make a
soft plaster with it. This plaster causes all swellings to ripen: Take
Violets and water Lillies, of each one ounce, oil of Quinces half an ounce,
Starch two ounces, Camfer one scruple, fine Bolus one dragme: make a salve
thereof for to use for all hot swellings. Item, take Pitch, Turpentine, and
Rosin, of each one ounce and a half, Wax one ounce, Sallad oil three
quarters of an ounce, let them melt together by a mild fire. The plaster
Diachilon does also much mollify all hard swellings.

In the second part the second Chapter and 7.. you have many excellent things
which also may be used for this purpose.

But if so be that these hard kind of swellings and impostumes be ripe, which
is thereby easily to be known, when the heat, the ague, and other accidents
do diminish; also, when the hardness is mollified, then must the swelling be
opened, and so kept with taints, and to cleanse it well, so that for certain
days together all the matter and corruption may run out: lay also clouts on
every time with red or any other amper wine, wherein Roses and Cammomill have
been decocted.

If so be that now after the healing like as it happens sometimes in these
kinds of hot swellings, there remain some pain which keeps the patient
disquiet, then lay beaten yolks of eggs upon it, tempered with oil of Roses.

Or take crumbs of white bread, and power seething water upon it, then wring it
out again and temper them with oil of Roses unto a pap.

Item, sees Mallows in common water, stamp them, and temper them with Bran
and oil of Violets: to all these forementioned things are you to temper
always some Saffron, because that it has an especial power in alaying of all
pains.

Of the Rose, a certain impediment, called Erysipelas.. 12.
AMongst the hot swellings whereof commonly the foresaid impostumes are caused,
is also the Rose or Erysipelas, which is none other thing but an inflammation
of the skin, which in this country we call the Rose.

The Latinists do call it Ignem sacrum, which is the holy fire, for that when
the Rose appears in any place of the body, then does it come with a burning
heat, with an ague, and with a dry rednes. And to know this impediment from
all other inflammations, lay your finger upon the chiefest place of the rednes,
wring it so easily, if so be that then the place whence you lift up your finger
that you had so wrung do seem white, and in the twinkling of an eye seem red
again, then is it a sure sign of the Rose. This swelling commonly assaileth
one with a quiuering, with heat, and cold, it infecteth also only the skin
without piercing (as other swellings) into the flesh, or very seldom, and when
this inflammation of the Rose goes inward into the body, then is it a very
bad sign.

Now for to heal this infection of the Rose, must heed be taken to these
orders following. First, can not one do better, then to purge this hot
choleric matter (whence this swelling has his foundation) with necessary
medicines: secondly, these choleric humors (which be as it were a skumme of
the blood) be not only a cause of this Rose, by their abundance, but also by
their heat and inflammation: wherefore it is not hurtful for to open a vain,
thereby to cool the blood. Thirdly, the cooling of this inflammation may not
be used in all places by laying on of some repulsiue things, to the end that
the hot matter be not repelled and driven to any noble part, as to the brains,
the heart, etc. whereby some great mischance might ensue.

Fourthly, no cold things are to be used for this swelling, if the body before
be not well purged. Fifthly, it is not needful for to ripen these swellings,
but only to cool them. Sixthly, if this Rose be without any mixture of other
swellings, then does it not hurt although one drink cold water, but it is
rather a medicine in this disease. Seventhly, when the swelling is caused of a
red Cholera, then is it so much the hotter, therefore strong cooling things are
to be used. Eighthly, if so be that this swelling be tempered with an other sort
of swelling, then is the same so long to be cooled, until one perceive that
the member has gotten again his natural color. Ninthly, if the place of the
swelling begin to seem black and brown, then use no cooling things more, to
the end that thereby it come not to impostumate and ranckle.

And to prevent these things, this is to be done: first of all purge the
patient, for to expel the Cholera with Cassy, Electuario Lenitiuo,
Diaphoenicone, De succo Rosarum, De Sebeste, as is showed at large in the third
part, the twelfth Chapter, and 6.. But it were not amiss always to add some
Rubarb unto either of these medicines.

But above all, he must beware of the use of Scammony, or Diagridion. But take
24. or 25. Prunes, sour Dates one ounce and a quarter, sees them well in
sufficient well water, then take of this decoction three ounces, and steep
therein one dragme of Rubarb throughout the whole night, afterward wring it
out in the morning, and mingle one ounce of the sirupe of Violets with it, or
as much as you think good, and so drink it warm. If this purgation be too
weak, then take some of the forenamed, and especially De succo Rosarum, and
temper therewith one quarter of an ounce. It happens also oftentimes, that
through the taking of any medicine, pain and marvelous accidents are
perceived, then is the patient presently to take warm water, or this ensuing.

Take Annis, and Fennel, of each half a dragme, Roses, Violets, flowers of
Burrage and of Buglosse, of each half a handful, Saffron three greines, sees
it together with water, and drink a good draught thereof, or lay it upon the
stomach.

Afterward set a boxing cup (vnpickt) upon the heart, and two behind upon the
back, and if so be that the age, and the repletion of the body may suffer it,
then is the liver vain to be opened: otherwise may it be omitted, for that in
this disease letting of blood is not always necessary.

His whole order of diet must be cooling things, wherefore wine is much
forbidden, and in the steed thereof, is there nothing more requisite than
Barley water. There may also be used sometimes the sirupe of Endive, of Vinegar,
of Sorrel, and of Poppy heads: or the sirupe and Iulep of Roses, and of
Violets is also much commended, and if so be that the long use of Barley water
went against him, then may he drink Well water; as herebefore you have seen
further direction in a hot stomach and liver.

For to use outwardly: Take Lettice, which is somewhat grossly beaten, and lay
it upon the heat of the swelling: or in the steed thereof, take Lettice water.
In like manner may you also use this following, whether it be tempered, or each
alone, being made wet with a spoonge, and so laid upon it, viz. water of
Endive, of Corn roses, of water Lillies, of Violets, or the decoction of Roses.

Item, lay Cream of milk upon it, tempered with Bran, or crummes of white
bread steeped in milk; and in like manner also Oxyrrhodinum. Or take the juice
of Plantaine, and juice of Housleeke, of each a like quantity, and temper some
Vinegar with it. Some do use for it the right writing ink. Take Plantaine one
handful, Nightshade and Violets, of each half a handful, Lineseed and
Fenegreeke meal, of each half an ounce; let it sees together to growte:
Afterward temper the yolke of an Egg amongst it, and use it as the other.

Another: Take Barley meal two ounces, Linseed meal and Roses of each one
ounce and a half, red and white Saunders of each one quarter of an ounce, fine
Bolus, and Camfere, of each one dragme, the juice of Nightshade and of
Housleeke, of each two ounces, and a little Vinegar; temper them all together
with the oil of Roses unto a soft plaster.

This oil following is also very good for to assuage heat, viz. oil of
Roses, of water Lillies, of Violets, and of Poppy heads. Nevertheless, there is
here to be noted, that all oily and fat things be not very meet for this; so
that they are not to be used for this disease, but only for to mix them with
other things.

For to anoint withal, take small powned litharge of gold, temper it unto
dough with oil of Roses, afterward put a little sharp vinegar unto it, and
stir it so long together until that the Vinegar be well tempered amongst it:
this is chiefly to be anointed upon the Rose there where there be any blisters
apparent, three times a day. The salve of Roses, and the cooling salve Galeni,
be very good for this, especially if there be a little Camfere tempered with
both these.

Also this salve following may sometimes be anointed upon it: Take the oil of
Roses, of Cammomill, of Eggs, and juice of Plantaine, of each a like quantity,
temper them all together.

Or take this following: Take the juice of Plantaine four ounces, Rose water,
and oil of Roses, of each one ounce and a half. If you desire to make a salve
thereof, then let it sees until all the juice be wasted, and then put some
wax unto it: Otherwise may you dip a cloth therein and lay it thereon, and as
then, the last described pap over it, beginning, Take Plantaine a handful, etc.

Item, take Barley meal, Honey, and the juice of Apples, of each a like
quantity, let them sees together unto grout, and use them as the other. You
may also use fomenting, where Roses, Cammomill, and Housleeke be decocted.

Of the swellings of the Groynes, Armepits, and Ears.. 13.
WE have here before in the common description of the Impostume and swelling
admonished, that there is also comprehended by the same name, the swelling of
the groines Bubones, as also the Carbuncles or plague sores. But because these
swellings do commonly appear in man and woman in the armeholes, or in the
groynes: therefore have we in the third part, the second chapter, and first.
written thereof at large. And it is also so with all other anguishes, Byles,
F^runculis, but that they be somewhat more tolerable.

Of the Carbuncle or plague sore, a perilous swelling.. 14.
THis Impostume do the Greeks call Anthracem, which is a Cole; the Latinists
call it Carbonem and Carbunculum, which name we have retained in our speech,
howbeit that some make a difference between Anthrax and Carbunculus. This
impostume is described as follows.

Anthrax is an hot impostume, by which the place where it appears is
inflamed, burns the gross blood, and causes a black cole or core with an
intolerable pain. And there is also in truth no worse impostume amongst all
the rest than this Anthrax, as all well learned Physicians do write thereof,
and as daily experience brings with it.

The signs whereby these two impostumes be known, is first a rednes of the
member, with a small blackish, dark blew, or pale push, whereon a scale
grows, under the which there is some matter or corruption gathered. But by
reason these hot Carbuncles, or plague sores, for the most part, and most
perillously make show in the time of plague (where shall be written at large of
this matter) therefore will we not divide the matter: but all those that are
taken with them at other times, we do remit to the sixth part of this book,
providing there to teach at length whatsoever shall seem needful for it;
therefore we will be the briefer at this present.

First must they which be infected with this disease, cause a vein to be
opened, and that on the contrary side, if so be that he be full of blood, and
of humors: afterward upon the same side: and if that can not be compassed, at
leastwise there to set boxing cups; afterward the patient is to be purged with
the whay of milk, with Epithymo, with Agaricus, or with sower Dates.

For to comfort him withal may he use Citrons, Limons, and Orenges. In eating
and drinking is he to keep himself, as one that is full of the ague, and
according as the heat is great. Outwardly is he not to use cold things, as in
the Rose, for that the matter is somewhat thicker: But one may make a plaster
of Gals, Plantaine, Lentils, of crusts of bread, or Bran, tempered with
Vinegar, Allume molten in Vinegar, and then laid with clothes upon it: for this
are also good Pomegranates cut in pieces, and decocted mellow in Vinegar, and
laid upon it as a plaster: for thereby will the heat and the pain be swaged.
Now for to cause this pain to ripen, make a plaster of Figs, of Currants, of
Nuts, of Barley meal, decocted with Wine and oil.

Round about the Carbuncle lay the salve of fine Bolus, made of Vinegar and
Rose water, for to defend the parts adjacent from heat.

When as now this anguish is broken up, then is it to be healed and cleansed
with the mundificatiue which is described in the second part, the second
chapter, and 9.. and to use drying things so long, until that they be thoroughly
healed, which may be effected with the salve Basilicon, Salve Basilicum.
which is thus made: Take Ceruse five dragmes, Litharge of gold one quarter of
an ounce, the Litharge of silver one dragme and a half, Dragagant one dragme;
make a powder thereof, and temper it with an ounce of white Wax, and three
ounces of oil of Roses, unto a salve.

Of all manner of old Ulcers and old Sores.. 15.
THese ulcers or old Sores, whether they be caused of Impostumes, winds, or
any other occasions, be always called by the Latinists Solutionem
Continuitatis, which is a separation of continuity, which always happens in
all ulcers and sores, where the skin and the flesh parts a sunder: whereof
there be found many kinds, as we also have described many of them before, and
shall do hereafter again. But this present. shall tell only of all old ulcers
in general: for which some of these rules following are to be observed.

First, if one see that an ulcer or wound do yield much thin matter, then is
it a sign that one is to use drying things. Secondly, if so be that the matter
be tough and thick, the^ are Abstersiua, which are mundifying things, to be
used. Thirdly when these kinds of ulcers be dressed, then is heed to be taken
that the ulcer be not blown upon with the South wind, that there come also no
cold, nor moisture into it, and that especially when the ulcer is moist and
hot. Fourthly, for all wounds dry things be good, and that the rather if the
same be deep. Fifthly, because there can be no good flesh engendered, unless
that the wound be first well dried and cleansed, therefore such things must be
used for it at times, otherwise would the matter be augmented in the wounds,
and be impossible for to engender flesh. Sixthly, there will be no flesh at all
engendered, if it be not that the salve be like to the nature of the ulcer:
therefore in all dry parts of the body dry things are to be used, and in moist
parts, moist remedies to be applied. Seventhly, it must be looked too, that
there be used no oiles in any ulcer, for that they bring a putrefaction in all
deep wounds and ulcers, and especially in warm time of year whether it be in
dry or moist complexions. Eighthly, it is needful, that in all qualities of the
members which be hurt with any wound, or ulcer, where flesh must be engendered,
the blood must be well cleansed, because that is the substance out of which the
flesh must grow: and this not only in the same member, but also over the whole
body. Ninthly, the drying medicines shall be no higher than dry in the first
degree, for that when the same dry too fast, then will the young flesh be
consumed and dried away. Tenthly, all drying medicines be very meet for all
dry complexions: like as to the contrary, all moist medicines, be most
necessary for all moist natures: whence it then follows, that dry bodies or
dry parties will be cured with dry medicines, and moist with moist.
Eleuenthly, if the wounds or sores be moist by nature, then be dry remedies to
be used for it. Twelfthly, if there be two kinds of ulcers, which be like one
another in the matter, and the one were in a dry body, and the other were in a
moist body, then in the ulcer in the dry body, are such things to be used which
be more dry, and in a moist body apply remedies which do dry less, for to
heal the same: therefore is Frankincense, and such like to be used in moist
bodies, because that it dries not forcibly. And on the contrary, Hartwort,
Ireos, and such like things, which do dry forcibly, are to be used in dry
bodies. Thirteenthly, the ulcers which yield a thick matter and be swollen, are
to be cured with such drying things which do not bite, as Pomegranat peeles,
decocted Plantaine and such like.

Now concerning the cure, there shall be by each description especially
declared, how that the purging, letting of blood, and such like shall be used:
Here will we only discourse, as much as concerns all old ulcers, what
plasters, salues, and other applications are to be used for them.

Take old Barrows grease, Butter, Bucks suet, Honey, Wax, and Rosin, of each a
like quantity, and a little wine; melt the same by the fire: afterward take
sallad oil as much as is needful for a soft plaster: this being done, then
wring it through a cloth, and let it be cold. This salve and all other salues
which here ensue, may be freely used in all ulcers, observing always the
difference between heat and cold. Take sallad oil and vinegar, of each two
ounces, Wax half an ounce, bruised Litharge of gold one ounce and a half,
Verdigrease one dragme, let the Vinegar be hot, and temper the other things
amongst it, then sees it together until that it be red.

This ensuing is very like unto it: Take oil and vinegar, of each two ounces,
Wax half an ounce, the litharge of gold one ounce and a half, Mastick and
Verdigrease, of each one drag. sees the oil and vinegar so long till the
vinegar be all wasted, and until the salve wax red.

Item, take oil of Roses three drag. oil of Cammomill one drag. Ceruse one
quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood and fine Bolus, of each half an ounce,
Camfer one drag. litharge of gold half a drag. prepared Tuty one quarter of an
ounce, Coral one drag. Wax as much as is needful for to make a plaster;
then spread it upon a leather, and lay it upon it.

But before that there be this or that laid upon it, the ulcer is to be
oftentimes washed with this ensuing: Take white wine four ounces, Rosewater
two ounces, the white of a hard sodden egg bruised small, burnt Allume one
quarter of an ounce, Verdigrease one drag. sees them all together by a mild
fire, and let it afterward settle; then strain it, and keep it well stopped:
and if it be too strong, then take more wine and Rosewater unto it.

This plaster following is called at the Apothecaries Basilicum, and of the
Chirurgians, the water plaster. The same is especial good for all dry sores,
which be without matter or moisture, and especially for the sinews, for that
it dries, cleanses, and causes the flesh to grow, and is thus prepared.

Take Wax, Rosin, Ox suet, Pitch, Turpentine, Frankincense, Mirrhe, and
Colophonium, Salve Basilicum otherwise.
of each a like quantity: but first you are to melt the Wax, and then the
Pitch amongst it: afterward put the Turpentine into it, and then mix the
Mirrhe and the Frankincense pouned small amongst it. Now when it is cold, so
that it may be handled with the hands, then must it be wrought thoroughly with
wet hands. Out of this will also a salve be made with oil, like as before in
the 14.. you have seen another.

Item, in the second part, the third Chapter, and 9.. is there one more, which
begins thus: Take clarified Honey etc. which may be used for all hot and cold
ulcers.

The Chirurgians do use this following under the name of the green plaster:
Take Dogs grease, Wax, Rosin, and Barrows grease, of each one ounce,
Nightshade and Mallows, of each one handful: sees the herbs to pap in Goats
milk, until it be altogether thick, afterward powne it all together, and
temper it one with another.

Wheresoever there be any Blisters which will impostumate or rankle, which the
Chirurgians do call Cossos exulceratos, thereto are these salues ensuing to be
used: Take lytharge of gold as much as you will, steep the same the space of
two days in vinegar, and power off the vinegar three times, and power fresh
upon it again; stir it oftentimes about, and then let it stand in the hot
Sun: afterward stir it and bruise it the space of two or three hours in a
leaden mortar, putting unto it in stirring it, now and then, a little Vinegar,
Violets, and oil of Violets, until it be thick: then at the last put two
ounces of Ceruse unto it, the juice of Plantaine and of Housleeke, of each
half an ounce, Camfer half a dragme, and two whites of eggs, so make thereof a
soft salve, and annoint therewith all Blisters which be caused of heat, and
all other exulcerations of the skin. The next day after is this disease to be
washed with this water following: Take Dock roots, Mallows, and Violet
leaves, of each one handful; sees all together in fair well water, and
strain it through a cloth, afterward temper it with Rosewater as much as you
please, and use it oftentimes.

Of a stinking and running ulcer.. 16.
THese ulcers or stinking sores do come of gross and tough humors. When one
will heal them, then is the patient to eat none other but light meats, and
to drink thin drink, and to purge the watery and melancholy humors, to the
end that thereby all affluent humors may be taken away. In like manner is the
patient to be let blood, if there be none other thing that lets it: and to
cut out all foul stinking flesh, or to bite or eat it out by some cautery,
that there may grow new and good flesh in it, for the which these things
following are very commodious.

First, for to cleanse the ulcers, is special good the salve Mundificatiuum
Apij, which is described in the second part. Item, the salve of the Apostles,
which may be found in the Register, and is marvelous good for all kinds of
ulcers.

This following is also much commended: Take Plantaine water, wine of
Pomegranates, and Honey, of each two ounces, Verdigrease and Allume, of each one
ounce and a quarter: boil them together until it become thick, then apply it
to the ulcers. Item, take unripe Sallad oil one ounce and a half, burnt lead
three drag. prepared Tuty three quarters of an ounce, Mastick, Frankincense,
and Sarcocolla, of each one drag. and a half, sees all together in 6. ounces
of water of Plantaine until the water be wasted away: if you will make a
plaster of it, then put as much wax unto it as is needful. This salve is to
be laid with plegents in the ulcer. This ensuing does cleanse and consume all
bad matter of the ulcer: Take quick lyme four ounces, oil 16. ounces, Dear
sewet 3. ounces, Wax as much as suffices for a plaster or salve: melt them
together, and stir it so long until it be cold. Another. Take small sifted
Otemeale eight ounces, the juice of Marierom and of Nightshade, of each four
ounces, fresh Barrowes grease 6. ounces, temper them all together, and then lay
it so thereon, the same does ripen, cool, and mundifie. There is also well
prepared a very costly plaster, which is called Gratia Dei, which is especial
good for all stinking ulcers, fresh wounds, and for all bad flesh; iron,
glass, wood, poison, bones, and all that does hurt in the wounds, does it draw
out and heals it, which is made thus:

The plaster Gratia Dei.
Take Turpentine one ounce, Rosin 6. ounces, white wax 2. ounces, Mastick half
an ounce, Verueine, Betony, and the great Pimpernell, of each half a handful:
stamp all the herbs, and sees them in strong wine, until the third part be
wasted: afterward strain it and wring it out. Then are you to sees in this
decoction the wax, Rosen, and Mastick, stirring it always about, until it be
well mixed together, then set it from the fire, and put the Turpentine and the
rest into it, then stir it very strong, so long until it be through cold. The
Chirurgians have also a plaster, which they do call the black plaster, which
is very good for all wounds, ulcers, and Fistulaes, The black Plaster.
and is thus prepared: Take Amber, Verdigrease, Sulphur, Lytharge of gold,
Lime, and Bayberries, of each a like quantity, pouned very small, clarified
Home, as much as is needful for to make a plaster or a salve.

The salve of Egypt called Vnguentum Aegyptiacum does also cleanse exceedingly
all Fistulaes, Salve of Egypt.
stinking ulcers, and cleanses them of the bad flesh, and is thus prepared:
Take Verdigrease five drag. clear Honey one ounce and three quarters, strong
Vinegar 7. drag. then sees them together until it be thick enough. It is an
especial good salve for all stinking sores, to cause the same to dry.

Item: take Verdigrease half an ounce, saltpeter one ounce, bruise them together
upon a stone and set it on fire with a paper, then will the saltpeter be burnt:
all that remains on the stone are you to lay with the stone and all, in a
moist celler, and the stone lying awry, then in time will there be an oil run
out of it; then temper this oil with Rose water, or with the white of an egg;
it is too strong alone, but it heals passing well.

Item, these oils ensuing be also very good for such like ulcers, viz. oil of
eggs, of Dill, of Lillies, of blew Flower deluce, of Walfloures, and oil of
Tiles.

Amongst the waters and such like be also good the two foresaid golden waters,
which we shall describe hereafter in the last part, and M. Tristrams water, one
of these, which one will, drunk or applied to the ulcer.

For this may also be used a certain ley tempered with Sallad oil, which
hereafter shall be described against the burning with gunpowder.

Or make this following: take small cut Hartwort one quarter of an ounce, Assa
foetida one drag. Centorie one dragme and a half, quick lime half a dragm; lay
them altogether to steep in a pint of Ley, afterward sees it until a third
part be wasted, wherewith the ulcer is to be washed luke warm. Item, poune
Honey suckle to powder, and let it boil well in wine, afterward lay this wine
upon the ulcer. The Chirurgians have also sundry powders in use; The red Powder.
amongst which there is one very common, which they do call the red powder, and
is prepared thus: Take Colophonium one ounce, Comfrey, Bloodstone, or Argall,
Dragon blood, and Momy, of each half an ounce, make a powder of all these: the
same does heal all ulcers, wounds, and Fistulaes, when they be cleansed from
all foul flesh. You may also use it in all wounds. Item, take Bean meal
half an ounce, mill dust 5. drag. Masticke half a drag. Dragagant, Gum, Momy,
fine Bolus, and Dragon blood of each one scrup. temper them all together, and
strew it in the moist ulcers. Of this powder may one make also a plaster
putting wax and Turpentine unto it, which most mightily does dry all ulcers.
It is also much commended that all they which be troubled with an old ulcer,
ought to take one drag. of Mithridate or Treacle, more or less according to
the ability of the person, and that with the water of Fumitory: the like may he
also use the stomachicall powder which is expressed in the first part, the
second chap. and 1.. beginning thus: Take Seen leaves, etc. which powder if so
be that the patient do use diligently, he need not fear at all of any bad
ulcer. The Rosemary wine is also much esteemed, for that it consumes all
excessive moisture of the body, and keeps the body in good health. Item, if
one wash the ulcer therewith, then will it both cleanse and heal it.

Of the broken veins called Varices.. 17.
OF these Varices or broken veins, is very much admonished in the fourth part
in the beginning of the second Chapter. And although these broken veins do
appear most in the hips, and in the legs: nevertheless the same do also happen
in deed in other parts of the body, where they be seen knobbed, green, and
black. These said veins of the breast, do stick full of Melancholy blood,
and are very ill to be healed.

They which labor much with the legs, travel much by land, do bear heavy
burdens, and do eat many melancholic meats, are for the most part troubled
with these broken veins.

Concerning the means whereby these broken veins are to be healed, is that at
first the Basilica be opened, and that the patient be purged with such
medicines as expel melancholic humors, whereof there be sundry expressed
here and there in this Book, and that is also oftentimes to be done, and he
is to beware of all gross meats.

When as this has been continued a long time, then are the broken veins to
be opened, and the blood to be let run clean out of it. Some do also use
the actual cauterie: yet must the uppermost vein be opened where it first
begins, and afterward to lay upon it this salve or plaster: Take Ceruse,
Antimonie, Lytharge of silver, and burnt Lead, of each one ounce, sheep suet
four ounces, Frankincense, Momy, Sandaraca, Sarcocolla, burnt Allume, and
Dragon blood, of each three dragmes, oil of Roses, and Vinegar of Roses, of
each three dragmes, white Wax and Rosin, of each half an ounce: temper them
together, and then make a salve or a plaster thereof: this is also good for
all old ulcers, for it dries and swageth the pain. Item, Take Frankincense,
Masticke, Mirrhe, and Momy, of each one dragme and a half, the juice of blew
Flower-deluce two dragmes and a half, Hartwort, Southernwood, and prepared
earthwormes dried to powder, of each one dragm, bruised small, Lytharge of gold
half an ounce, burnt Coperas, burnt Lead, Gals, Cipers nuts, the roots
Curcuma, white and red Corrall, and Roses, of each two ounces, Dear suet, and
oil of blew Flower-deluce, of each one ounce: poune all that is to be pouned,
but the Rosin, the Turpentine, and the oil are to be molten by the fire, and
so tempered with the rest to a salve. Some do take Lupine meal, and make a
plaster with water wherein Tamariscus is decocted, or with Goats dung and
Wine. Also the uppermost members from whence this heavy blood falls down,
are to be strengthened and their disease cured.

The second Chapter. Of depascent Ulcers in general.. 1.
FOr as much as we be now come to write of those ulcers which do not continue
in a place, but corrode hitherwards and thitherwards corrupting the skin, the
flesh, yea sometimes the bones: therefore is it first to be known that these
ulcers be called Phagedaenas: but for the more difference, such like ulcers
have their several names: amongst which Herpes, Phagedaena, and Cancer, be the
chiefest: the first whereof, to wit, Herpes, does yield much thin and subtle
moisture; the Cancer, gross, and tough matter; and Phagedaena, middle between
thin and thick matter; but Herpes is not always an open ulcer, but creeps
in time hitherwards and thitherwards like a Snake, whereof this disease also
bears her name; the one place healing, and the other excoriating a new:
Phagedaena is a great ulcer, and corrodeth very deep into the place and on
every side of it: Cancer (which is the canker) shall hereafter have his proper
description. And albeit, these sores (as is said) do somewhat differ: yet are
they for the most part comprehended all under the name of a Fistell, and it is
thought that the Fistula is always a cause of the other: therefore we will
also first of all write of that.

Of the Fistula.. 2.
THis name of Fistula (or Fistell in English) have the Latinists first of all
given unto this ulcer, which does signify a Pipe: for as a Pipe is long and
hollow; so is the nature of this ulcer also, being deep and having in the
beginning but a small issue: for which cause it is described, as hereafter
follows. A Fistell is an ulcer, the which round about it has a callous skin,
deep, and long, penetrating into the body, and very crooked, which be hard
to close up or to heal: and the which sometimes also in steed of good matter,
do yield a subtle moisture.

It is found also that these Fistels do appear very little above in the
skin, and nevertheless do lie with their roots deep and hidden in the
flesh, wherefore they be also the more dangerous to be healed, like as you may
see in the seventh chapter, and eleventh. of the Fistell in the corner of the
eyes. Item, where we discourse of the Impostumes of the ears, and also of the
Fistell of the gums which are all together described in the first part, and in
the second part, the third chapter, and nine. In like manner also in the third
part, the tenth chapter, and twelfth. of the Fistula of the Arsegut. The causes
of these Fistels may be precedent impostumes badlie cured; or for that one has
stayed too long from opening of them, whereby the matter has eaten inwards,
and so is turned into a Fistell. In like manner may also a Fistell grow of a
wound which is not well mundified, also of fractures of bones, or any other bad
humors of the body which lie hidden under the skin, and under the flesh, which
do there corrupt the same, and be changed into a Fistell. The signs be these,
viz. when one wringeth them, then be they without pain, if it be not that they
stand somewhere about a sinew, or had some corruption in them. If so be that
this Fistell be only in the flesh, then will the matter be white in a short
space. Or if the Fistell be old, then does it yield a long space thick and
troubled matter: or if the Fistell be in a sinew, then is the matter thin and
black, and if one wring it, then does there run out bloody matter. If so be
the same be in the bone, then does there run out thin and yellow matter. And
if so be that it pearse into the hollownes of the bone, then issues a fat oily
matter, whereby may easily be gessed that the marrow is spoiled, with other more
such like signs, which be discovered in the same places.

Now for to heal these Fistels, must certain articles he noted: First,
because all Fistels proceed most of a waterish moisture, therefore are all
drying things to be used unto it, and the patient is to eat those things that
make good blood. Secondly, by reason that the material cause is rooted in the
body, it is necessary to have the same prepared and expelled. Thirdly, in old
and very deep Fistels, is it surest of all (if one will heal the same) that
they either by incision or by an actual cautery be taken away even to the
bottom, as to the contrary, the potentiall cautery because of the sinews is
dangerous and hurtful. Fourthly, all Fistels that go into the bone will never
more be healed, if the bone be not first sealed. Fifthly, they that do go into
the flesh, must of necessity be dilated and opened, to the end that they may
be the better mundified and dried.

The cure of this Fistell is of great importance, so that the patient is to
order himself in eating and drinking, according as the first rule gives
notice, and to use all drying things for it: also he is to lead his life in a
dry dwelling, and there to settle himself. Fish and such like things be
noisome for him, good flesh rather roasted than sod is commodious for him: his
drink shall be good wine: but because of the sharp matter, the same is to be
somewhat watered. And for to prepare the matter of the Fistell, take Oxymel of
Squils, or Diureticum and such like, which may also be used in the Fistell it
self.

These be then the things which may be used outwardly: Take Frankincense and
Aloe, of each one ounce, skummed Honey five ounces, sees the Honey until it be
thick. When it begins to be cold, then temper the powders amongst it: at the
last put one ounce and a half of molten Assa foetida unto it, and rub it a
good while in a mortar. This is a passing remedy to heal the Fistell, and
also to cure all old ulcers, for that it cleanses the same, it consumes all
corrupted flesh, it separateth all scurfe and corrupted bones.

Item, take Turpentine which is oftentimes washed with Sorrel water, four
ounces, the yolke of an egg, temper them together, and put six ounces of the
juice of Smallage unto it, let it sees together till the juice be consumed;
then add half a dragme of Saffron unto it: this cleanses and consumes all
that does any hurt in ulcers or wounds, and it makes also flesh to grow.

Next unto this plaster and salve may you use the water which not long since
in the first Chapter and 16.. is described, beginning thus: Take small beaten
Hartwort, etc.

The Chirurgians have also a kind of plaster which is not only good for all
Fistels, but also for all wounds, and is thus made.

Take Veruayne, Betony, Herba vulneraria, Buglosse, Agrimony, Consolida
Saracenica, Yarrow, Pimpernell, the great and small Plantaine, of each one
handful poune them all together, and wring out the juice: afterward sees it
in three pints of good wine, and wring it through a cloth, then put it into a
Kettle, and put a pound of Turpentine unto it, Wax four ounces, Colophonium
eight ounces. This being all done, sees it sufficiently, and when it begins
to be cold, then stir two ounces of pouned Mastix amongst it.

For this is also very good the plaster of Gratia Dei, the foresaid water of
Hartwort, the salve of the Apostles.

Item, take the urine of a man child, and rub it a long time in a leaden mortar
until it be thick, afterward let it dry unto a powder, and then strewe this
powder on the Fistell. The powder of Ireos strewed also thereon causes flesh
to grow: the powder of Honysuckles is also very good for this use. Rosemary
wine, and such like more that be discovered in the 16.. be very good. Celendine
pouned small, and so laid upon the Fistell: or the juice of the same dropped
therein, does heal the Fistels. For this may also be used the oil of old
linen, as has been said in the first part. Item, make an oil of
watercresses, and spread it or lay it upon the disease, wherewith it is
mundified. Thus much be written of the Fistula, now will we proceed to speak
and discourse of the running ulcers.

Of the corroding ulcers, called Herpes.. 3.
THe name of this ulcer is as much to say as a Snake, like as we have
admonished already, for that it creeps forwards like as Snakes do, and
remains not in one place, but windeth it self hither and thither, infecting
most of all the skin only, without eating deeper inwards. The cause of this
ulcer or sore, is the same with that of the other, to wit, superfluity of
Cholera, if she merely remain and abide in her proper nature, that is, if the
Cholera be not mixed with any other humor: for that when this Cholera does
spread it self over the whole body, then does it cause the yellow Iaunders,
which by nature is of two sorts. When as now this Cholera is thick and gross,
then will the whole skin even to the flesh be thereby damnified, and this ulcer
will be then called Herpes exedens, which is the corroding Herpes. The other
sort of Cholera is subtiller, which remains (as is said) in the uppermost
part of the skin, which does singe the out side as if it were set a fire, the
which without any addition is called Herpes, or Herpes miliaris, as having the
name of the Milet seed, for that this exulceration is like unto it.

The signs of these ulcers be these: the member loses his natural color,
and waxes black, soft, and stinking; also if the pulse and the pain diminish,
and in the mean while the ulcer does so corrode, that if it be not looked to
in time, the member must be cut off, or the party must look for death thereby.

The remedies of these ulcers (says Galenus) be these which are wont to be
used for the corroding Erisypelas, wherefore we may write so much the less
thereof. But if it be perceived that it begin to putrify, then temper sealed
earth and fine Bolus with Vinegar together, and spread it round about the
ulcer, and also in it. But if this will not help, then be the corners round
about the ulcers to be scarified, or lanced, and also to set boxing cups and
horse leaches thereon, which may suck out the bad blood; and this plaster
following is also to be laid upon it: Take Pease-meale, or Bean meal and
sall, temper all together with the sirupe of Vinegar, and lay it as a pap upon
it: the scarificed place must also be washed twice a day with Vinegar, and then
to anoint this salve following over it: Take Assa foetida, Nettle seed, and
Hartwort roots, of each half an ounce, Verdigrease one quarter of an ounce,
temper it with vinegar to the thicknes of Honey, and annoint therewith the whole
disease, and the places about it. And to the end that these ulcers may not
corcode any further, then take Verdigrease, Allume, and Honey, of each a like
quantity, and use it as is before said. The selfsame takes away all bad
flesh, and sustaineth the new flesh. But in case that through these foresaid
things the rotting ceased not, but daily did corrode more and more, and the
stench increased, then shall you strew thereon this powder ensuing, to wit,
pouned Hartwort and Gals, of each a like quantity. Or take Dragagant and
Coperas, tempered together with vinegar, and if so be that this foresaid do not
profit, then are the edges yea the whole accident to be cauterised with
corrosiues or hot yrons: then take the roots of Celendine, vnsleckt lyme,
Eoperas, Mirthe, Hartwort, and Verdigrease, of each alike quantity, tempered
with the juice of Plantaine, or pouned Orpiment alone tempered with the
foresaid juice. When as then the corosiues have done their work, and the
crustes or stakes be yet hard, then must they be anointed with fresh butter
until they do fall away of themselves, and afterward those things to be used
which are wont to engender skin and flesh.

The other sort of these ulcers is Herpes miliaris, whereof we have admonished
before. Some do call it Formica, that is, the Ant. This ulcer is also of sundry
natures, and that according to the nature of the humor, whereof it is caused.
It is also comprehended in three sorts or species: the one, which runs
hither and thither, which is caused of a subtle moisture, and is also quickly
consumed: the second, that creeps forward hither and thither, which is very
hurtful: the third is of a gross and hot Cholera, which enters somewhat
deeper into the flesh, and is mixed with some Phlegma, and thence comes the
Formica miliaris, which is hotter and harder to be cured. Out of all these
foresaid reasons be the signs apparent, and before sufficiently rehearsed and
discovered.

Now for to remedy this accident, is this the briefest way; that first of all
be prescribed to the patient a good order of diet, like as is done in the
Agues. For purging is he to use sower Dates, Cassy, Epithymum with Rubarbe,
steeped in Endive water, or whay of milk. If it be Herpes miliaris, then take
Diaturbith. Further, you are to take Gals, Pomegranate pills, and fine Bolus, of
each a like quantity: afterward temper it with Rose water and a little
Vinegar, and then anoint it thereon with a feather.

Item, take the heads of salted fish, roast them in an earthen pot upon the
fire, until they be almost burnt, and then mix them with strong wine, spread
it upon the disease: or take sheep wool, and fry it until it be black,
then poune it, and temper as much Rose water amongst it until it be thick,
and anoint therewith the foresaid accident clean over, twice or thrice a day,
and then lay a white or blow cloth upon it. There be yet diverse other sorts of
impostumes and ulcers, which be of the same nature, differing in names and
causes: but because we do comprehend them amongst the forementioned, therefore
will we omit them, and especially because they may all be cured and helped with
these foresaid remedies.

Of the hard Tumor Scirrhus.. 4.
BEfore we come to the third corroding ulcer, namely, the Canker; we must first
of all admonish of this tumor, which the learned do call Scirrhus, of some
Schrosis, whereof we have also made mention before in the third part, the
twelfth chapter and the fifth. and that by reason that this Scirrhus has great
alliance with the Scirrhus of the Liver. This Scirrhus is of two sorts, and
both those are of the unnatural tumors of the body, whereof one is so hard,
that it yields at any hand; yea it is without pain and feeling, which is
also accounted for incurable. This swelling is of color like lead or ashes,
and is caused only through Melancholy, the which is (as it were) dregs of all
humors. The second has but a little sense, and also some pain: for it
proceeds out of Melancholia and Phlegma, which be tempered together, and is
of color like to the other. The same may also be cured, but not easily, as
before we have sufficiently written in the first chapter, and 11.. This
foresaid hardness may be well caused of some former impostume, which is not well
cleansed or healed: whereas the corruption remaining does clod and harden. The
difference between this Scirrhus and the Canker is, that in the compass of
the Canker there is heat, beating, and opening of the veins; whereof there is
none with this Scirrhus: for that Scirrhus is without heat, without pain, and
without any sense or feeling, and also incurable. But forasmuch as this
Scirrhus, does appear as well in other places of the body, to wit, in the
liver, milt, and stomach etc. and that we have written sufficiently in sundry
places thereof, therefore it is not needful for to discourse here any further
of it, but to proceed with the Canker.

Of the Canker.. 5.
THis corroding ulcer, which is taken to be a kind of Fistell, has her name of
the sea Crab, which men call in Latin Cancer, which the Italians call Granizo,
and the Grecians Carcinoma, not only for that it creeps hither and thither,
but also like as Galenus witnesses, for that many times this Canker has been
seen, and especially in women's breasts, in all sorts like unto the sea Crab,
for the veins do reach into the Canker (being filled with black blood) no
otherwise, but as they were the feet of the sea Crab. This Canker is in the
beginning very easy to be healed: but if it grow old, and has rooted in too
long, then has it never been seen that the same could be healed without
incision. The cause of this Canker is a superfluity of melancholicke humors.
Other do suppose that it is caused of melancholicke humors which be burnt by
Cholera, or be partly tempered therewith: whereof the Physicians do make two
kinds of tumors; the one being a melancholic and hard swelling, without any
ulcer, and with little pain, as before (in the discourse of Scirrhus) we have
showed. The other sort is a corroding ulcer, as we have before declared. The
signs of a beginning Canker be these; the same begins first as a small
bean, round, and dark of color, being tempered with green and black
colors, and appearing with some heat and pain: it remains also immovable
in the same place where it begins: but herein has the Canker a difference
with the Scirrho, viz. that the Canker is caused of burnt Melancholy, being
tempered with burnt Cholera: and the right Scirrhus of a thick melancholic
humor tempered with Phlegma. Secondly, the Canker causes also great pain and
beating, whereof Scirrhus is free. Thirdly, the Canker has black and not red
veins about it, as the Scirrhus or the Phlegmone has. Fourthly, the Canker
begins first to grow of it self: To the contrary, Scirrhus does always
come after some impostume. Fifthly, the Canker is very sensible, and the
Scirrhus without any sense or feeling at all.

For this hard Canker, which is not yet exulcerated, be these rules ensuing
ordained: First, the patient is to beware of all meat which ingendreth burnt
Cholera; of all spices, and of all things, which do heat the body. Secondly,
he is to eat no meat, but that which makes good blood. Thirdly, if at the
first and in the beginning of the Canker he lay thereto all that which is
necessary for it, then may the Canker be helped, but the old Canker can be
cured by no manner of means without incision. Fourthly, necessity requires in
this sickness, that the body is to be opened with decocted Epithymo, which is
also very meet for the lengthening of life, although that it cannot yield
perfect health. Fifthly, in the beginning is the Median to be opened. Sixthly,
when a woman that is under fifty years of age, has the Canker, and has not
her terms, then must it be endeavored that she get the same. Seventhly, if it
be a man, then is he to open the Pyles. Eighthly, it does not help to purge once
or twice, but the same is to be done oftentimes; for that the humors which
cause this disease are not easily taken away. Ninthly, by this foresaid order,
and through all means which be possible, you are to endeavor, that the hard
Canker be not opened.

We must also ordain an order of diet. First, regard must be had, that the
patient have his dwelling in a temperate air, which is somewhat warm and
moist. Also, he is to take heed of all hot meats that may inflame the blood,
and whereof heavy thick blood might engender; as Coleworts, Lentils, Beef,
Milk, Hares, Geese, salted or smoaked flesh, Beans, Pease, hot spices,
Onions, Garlic, Leekes, Mustard, Cresses, Radish, and such like. Also the
patient must beware of doing any kind of labor in the Sun, or of over heating
of himself by any means, and of drinking strong gross wine. But to the
contrary, he must endeavor himself for to eat and drink none other thing but
good hail meat, as Pullets, Hens, Lamb, Mutton, and Partridges: he may also
eat all kind of River fish, which have scales. Item, Parsley, Burrage,
Purslaine, Lettice, Pompeons, and such like, be also not forbidden him: fresh
sodden Eggs, Oaten pap, and Barley pap is also very good for him. His drink
must be clear white Wine, which shall be always somewhat watered.

In fine, his whole government must be moistening and cooling: and if so be
that there be any heat with it, then may he eat and drink Buttermilke. And
like as the first rule gives to understand, the Median is in the beginning to
be opened, and to let out as much blood as the ability of the patient can
suffer: and further to observe all things that the former rules do teach.

We have not here to tell of any other remedies, because that we have already
written in four places of the Canker, viz. in the first part, the eight
chapter, and fifth. Item, in the second part, the third Chapter and tenth. of
the Canker of the breasts. Likewise also in the third part, the tenth chapter,
and twelfth. of the Canker of the Arsegut. Also in the third part, the 19.
chapter and 13.. of the Canker of the Matrix: In all which places one may most
plentifully see, by what means these diseases are to be remedied. Nevertheless,
all that which follows hereafter is very commodious to be used, viz. the
plaster Gratia Dei. But before you use this plaster, some do advise, that
round about the Canker should be well and deep scarified, or to set Leaches
about it, and to wash the scarified place three or four times with a sharp
ley, wherein Lentils be decocted, and afterward to fill the ulcer with flat
plegents, which be anointed with the salve of Egypt. But you shall understand
that the foresaid salve, like as also powned Agrimony, or the juice thereof,
(which be much commended for this disease) cause the good flesh to separate
from the bad.

Take Lupine meal, Linseed meal, and Barley meal, of each four ounces, the
juice of Wormwood, and Salt, of each half an ounce, Soap and Ley, of each a
little, sees them then together to pap. Item: Take pouned Allume, and the
powder of Earth-wormes, of each one ounce. Or take fresh Earth-wormes, poune
them with the Allume, and so lay them upon the disease.

Item: Take Winelies, and Allume, of each a like quantity, and so lay it upon
the canker, and chiefly upon the disease Herpes.

For this is also meet the salve of Roses, which is discovered before in the
Introduction. Likewise also the salve of Tutia, which is called Diapampholigos,
or this following: Take Lytharge of gold, and Ceruse, of each a like quantity,
put them together in a leaden mortar with oil of Cammomill, and Rose water,
and rub it so long until it be as thick as salve: this is as meet for the
hidden and secret canker, as for the canker exulcerated. This ensuing does also
withstand the canker that it grow no further, whether it be exulcerated or not:
Take sealed Earth, ^^ne B^l^s, and Ceruse, of each a like quantity: temper it
with the juice of Lettice, or with the juice of Housleeke, and then stir it
well together in a leaden mortar as before, and spread it on the canker. The
muscilage of Fleawoort is also very good being tempered amongst it. The oil of
Sulphur, the oil of Juniper, whether it be distilled of the wood, or of the
berries, tempered together or each apart, be very good for the canker. This
powder following is also used to be strewed on this disease: Take burnt bones
of a sound man, Cinquefoile, the roots of Mandragora, and Orpiment, of each
one quarter of an ounce, make a powder thereof, and bestrew therewith the open
canker: The Orpiment is very venomous and sharp; notwithstanding it is
commended above all other for the Woolfe, the Fistula, Canker, and in the Ulcer
Her^^oxedens, if one know prouidently to use it. This Orpiment was wont to be
tempered with the juice of Plantaine, or with the juice of Nightshade, and to
make a cloth wet in it, and with the powder of the same to bestrew the ulcer,
and then afterward to lay the wet cloth upon it. But when you will use this
Orpiment, then anoint the canker round about with fine Bolus, which is mixed
with the juice of Nightshade, for to free the place from any inflammation. If
so he that the sore be thereby distempered and swollen up with heat, then lay
one day or twain the foresaid cooling herbs upon it, and the pain will
assuage therewith.

If you will know whether the root of the canker be taken away, that is to be
known hereby, viz. if it stink no more, and if there begin any flesh to grow,
like as is wont to happen in all other ulcers when they grow full of flesh,
and be covered with the skin. It is a great abuse that some suppose that there
is to be laid upon the canker of necessity the flesh of Hens, Ca^ons, etc. the
which the Canker should eat up, and should lessen the malady.

There is also used in the exulcerated canker Mercurius praecipitatus, for that
it is not so strong as the Orpiment. But the foresaid washing with Vinegar,
Ley, and plasters, is much more surer and rather used. Item: take the roots
of Verbascum, and Docke roots, of each half an ounce, the dried ordure of a
sound man one ounce, make thereof a powder, and use that as the former. Or make
a powder of Cheruill, temper it with Honey and lay it thereon, it hea^eth much.
The water of Carduus Benedictus should have a great virtue against this disease.

For the heat and inflammation of the Ulcers.. 6.
FIrst, for this inflammation may those things serve, which before in the 1.
chap. and twelfth. are ordained against the Rose. In like manner also all that
which presently hereafter against the burning of fire and water shall be
described, and especially this ensuing: Take oil of Eggs, and oil of Roses, of
each one ounce, Vinegar half an ounce, black Hellebore ten grains: this being
well tempered together, it is especial good for all inflammations of all
ulcers.

Other more: Take Woolblade, poune it very small and temper it with Vinegar,
then lay it upon the heat: Or steep Quince kernels in water and anoint the
heat with the muscilage.

Take Corn roses, and Waterlillies, of each a like quantity, beat them and
lay them thereon: if you cannot get them, then take their water. For this is
also good, the leaves of the Mulberrie tree: likewise also Poppie leaves
decocted in rain water.

In like manner also broad Plantaine, and Bursa Pastoris laid thereon after the
same order. The herb Carduus Benedictus decocted and laid thereon, is also
good: the juice of Sloes spread upon the heat, does take away the
inflammation. But if so be that the inflammation has gotten the upper hand
already, then is this following very good: Take strong water one ounce, and
put therein one quarter of an ounce of Quicksiluer, and let it stand so
certain hours together: afterward take a feather and anoint therewith the
disease once or twice a day, then shall the Canker begin outwardly, and in
other places more to separate, till that the foul burnt flesh will fall out:
afterward use the salve Apostolorum, or the salve of Egypt with flat pledgents
therein, and that twice a day, afterward lay some of the plasters upon it
which be described against the wild fire.

Item, for the cooling of this burning, take the oil of Eldern flowers six
ounces, the oil of Saint John's wort one ounce, oil of Turpentine half an
ounce, let them so mixed the space of certain days, stand in the sun, and
then keep it until the time of need.

There be many more sundry things which be very requisite for this, especially
in the treatise of the plague, therefore we will not rehearse them at this
present.

The third Chapter. Of the Pocks, and of the lamenes which is caused thereby.
THis sickness and infection of the whole body of man, is placed by good reason
next to the above mentioned ulcers, because they exceed all other ulcers,
except the beforesaid in badnes: the which now a days when I did write this,
has been known about the space of threescore and ten years, and from the
time that King Charles of France 1494. did besiege the City of Neapoli; so
that this disease until this present day is yet therefore called the French
Pocks, and in Latin Morbus Gallicus. But the same sickness was known long
before in Spain, whither long before it had been brought out of the Indies,
and out of the New found lands, like as also until this time it is called by
some Scabies Hispanica: so that before that any one could cure this disease,
people were burnt, launched, and cauterised most miserably, and rather spoiled
than healed: but daily experience brought by little and little more help and
amendment for it. And like as the Quicksiluer and such like means were not so
^ure, there has been found out at last the use of Guaiacum.

Now concerning the remedies of this disease, I will first of all prescribe a
process of the ancient Physicians (the which in those days was found good)
and is as yet not utterly to be rejected, and afterward allege three of the
most famous Physicians for this sickness, whereunto we notwithstanding shall at
the last add certain good things more, whereof each may choose which one
thinks him to be most meet, and according to that the disease does require.

An order and cure of the ancient Physicians.. 1.
AS soon as a body can perceive that he is infected with this disease, then
is he to keep himself warm, to sweat much in hot bathes, to use cupping, to
be let blood twice: afterward he is to remain in a close chamber, and to let
himself be twice a day anointed with this salve over all his ioints, and then
to sweat upon it the space of two hours: and because that every one cannot
abide to sweat, then must heed be had to the strength of the patient, to the
end he fall not thereby in any swouning.

Purging is also needful for this patient, which may be done as hereafter
follows: Take white Turbith half an ounce, Ginger one quarter of an ounce,
Galingall, Masticke, Cloves, and Cardamom, of each half a dragme,
Hermodactyli, Diagridion, and Seen leaves, of each half an ounce, Sugar three
ounces: take one dragme thereof, or one dragme and a half at once, and fast
five hours after it. They write that this powder may boldly be given, and that
it may be used also in other sicknesses. It is nevertheless very strong
especially if one take one dragme and a half thereof: but in mine opinion two
scruples is sufficient in weak men, and a dragme sufficient in a strong body
for to purge sufficiently.

The foresaid ancient Physicians do also advise, that one must take one
quarter of an ounce of prepared black Hellebore, (viz. a strong body) steeped
in Goats milk, and strained, and then drunken, for that it cleanses and
heals the Pocks: it is very good, but for strong persons it is strong enough.

For as much then as these foresaid medicines be very strong, therefore can I
not omit to add certain things of the later Physicians unto that of the
ancient, and to teach a safer mean, which all they which needs must use
Quicksiluer, should observe. For this you have first in the third part the 11.
Chapter and 20.. the manner to make the infusion of Seen leaves, and how the
same should be dronken with some kind of sirupes. These potions may one drink
three or four times, every day once early in the morning: and afterward (as
the ancient Physicians do advise) the patient is to purge with pills De Fumo
terrae one dragme, this is the common dose of them, but it may be augmented or
diminished, according to the ability of the patient. You may also steep
Fumitory in Goats milk, or let them sees together, and drink thereof in the
morning and evening: or you may drink the water of Fumitory alone, for the
Fumitory does cleanse the blood marvelous much.

When as now the patient is well purged, then is this salve ensuing to be
prepared: Take Frankincense one ounce, Ceruse one ounce and a half, Lytharge
of gold two ounces, Dragonbloud one quarter of an ounce, poune them all
together, and sift it through a Sieue: afterward take 16. ounces of molten
Barrows grease, and so power it as hot as it is upon cold water, and so let it
stand: this being done, then temper therein one quarter of an ounce of
Quicksiluer, so long until you can see it no more. Some do kill the
Quicksiluer in Turpentine, or vinegar of Roses, but it is needles: now then how
this salve is to be used, that have we showed at the first. They divide the
salve in four, five, or six parts, and they spend in the inunction every day
one part, according to the ability of the person. But because that after this
inunction the mouth will be sore, they do use for it Allume, and Barley water,
and let the patient wash his mouth therewith: Or they take a pint of wine, and
half as much vinegar, half an ounce of Allume, two spoonfuls of Honey, and
temper them together. With this do they gargarise the mouth when the tongue is
excoriated, to wit, with a ragge which is tied to a stick, which has been
described in the first part, the first Chapter, and 3..

Before times the sick persons which were infected with this disease, were wont
to be more plagued with lamenes, and for that do they use this bath following:
Take refuse of iron, make them glowing hot, and then cast them into a closed
tub, afterward take Cammomill, Marierom, and Thyme, sees them, and make with
both the vapors a bath: then dry off the sweat with warm clothes, continue
this the space of eight days together, or so long, till that you be whole, at
each time, the space of an hour.

Item, take small pouned Frankincense, temper it with two ounces of Aqua vitae,
stir it oftentimes about, and then annoint therewith the members which be
lame. If so be that the patient have any ulcer, then take four ounces of
Barrowes grease, Quicksiluer one ounce and a half, salt Lard, Dogs grease,
Bears grease, and Badgers grease, of each three quarters of an ounce, temper
them all together. But note, that you must use the salt Lard in no other
salues, but when you have old ulcers in hand.

For the foresaid old ulcers is this powder following to be used: Take Salt,
and white Argall, of each a like quantity, burn them together in hot ashes.

Also stinking ulcers be made wet with this ensuing: Take half an ounce of
Mercurij Sub^mati. Allume three quarters of an ounce, Ceruse one ounce, bruise
all together very small upon a small Marble stone, put a pint of vinegar unto
it, and make a cloth wet therein, and therewith wash the ulcer. Take Mercurius
Sublimatus half an ounce, Aqua vitae twelve ounces, then annoint the ulcers
with it: this is very strong.

Of the lamenes, and of the extenuation of the members, has been spoken
before in the fourth part, the seventh Chapter and 2.. for the lamed member of
the Pocks. This is in fine the means whereby the ancient Physicians were wont
to heal the Pocks.

How to decoct Guaiacum.. 2.
BEfore that we come to the curing of the Pocks which is used in our time,
which happens for the most part by the decoction of Guaiac, called Lignum
guaiacum, and Lignum sanctum, we will first of all teach how this diet drink
is to be decocted and prepared of Guaiac, as follows hereafter.

The decoction of Guaiac.
First, take small filed or shaven Guaiack 16. ounces, Stechas, field Cipers,
rindes of the same beaten small 12. ounces, Carduus Benedictus, S. John's wort,
yellow Lillies, and Betonie, of each one handful, first put the wood and the
pouned rinds in a leaden earthen pot, and then power thereon seven quarts of
water: let them stand in steep together the space of a whole night, being
stopped tight too: afterward set the pot to sees easily, when the fourth part
is consumed add the herbs unto them, then put two quarts of wine unto it,
cover the pot close, and let them cool. The rinds, wood, and herbs, are to be
dried, and well kept for to have the same used again another time, as shall
hereafter be taught.

The second manner: Take rinds of Guaiacum eight ounces, Guaiacum four ounces,
pouned small together, well water five quarts, let them stand and steep
together about the space of 24. hours, then sees it all together until about
the third part be wasted. Take it afterward from the fire closed very tight,
and let it stand so asteepe the space of twelve hours: strain it through a
cloth, and wring it well out, afterward power unto it as much white wine
(which is not sweet) as the potion is, then cast two ounces of Hermodactils
into it, and keep this potion as before.

The third sort: Take four quarts of Renish wine, and eight ounces of grated
Guaiac, pouned rinds four ounces, Betonie, and pouned Licorice, of each one
ounce, then let it stand asteepe the space of 24. hours, and afterward sees
it to the half: strain the potion through a cloth, and drink thereof morning
and evening the space of forty days, each time four or five ounces.

The fourth potion: Take three quarts of wine, rasped Guaiac eight ounces,
pouned rinds four ounces, Licorice two ounces; let them sees well together,
and afterward power four quarts of wine upon it, and let it sees again
until the fourth part be wasted.

These be now the most usual manners to make this decoction, yet may the same
be altered according to the importance of the sickness, and according to the
strength of the patient: now follows here what order the Physicians now
adays do observe in healing the Pocks.

Another manner to heal the Pocks.. 3.
BEfore the patient begin to drink, he ought first to be purged, for which the
Cassie is most meet: also he is to be let blood. But especially this is the
most fittest mean: Take Seen leaves, Polipodie roots, and Currants, of each
three quarters of an ounce, sees them all together in six ounces of Fennel
water until the third part be wasted. In this decoction are you to steep the
space of a whole night Rubard and Agaricus, of each one dragme: afterward
wring it out, and put unto it one ounce of the honey of Roses, whereof you are
at least every morning to take one draught three days together, and afterward
to observe this order following.

The next day after the taking of these potions, must he in the morning betimes
drink four ounces of the decoction of Guaiac, as is taught before in the
second. and that as warm as he may abide it: then is he to sleep or rest one
hour. He is to drink so much again and rest, and do this the third time. But
after the third draught, he is to arise, and shall according to the old custom
break his fast, and that of such meats which be light of digesture. His
drink that he is to drink on day times, is thus to be prepared.

Take the wood and the rinds whereof the first drink has been decocted, and
then power water and wine unto it (as is said) and let them sees together
until the fourth part be consumed, and this must be his daily drink, but this
may be altered diversely, according to the quality of the cause.

Against the evening is he to drink of the first potion a good draught very
warm, and an hour afterward he is to go to supper, and so continue this
until the fifth day; but the sixth day is he to take the potion with Rubarb. The
seventh day he shall take none other but a spoonefull of this composition
following: Take small powdered Guaiac one ounce, Mace half an ounce, honey of
Roses two ounces, temper them together. The eight day he is to begin again as
before, to drink of the first decoction, and so continue the space of ten
days together, unless it be found good to augment and increase it. The
eighteenth day is he to take again the infusion of Rubarb, and the two days
following: Then is he to use none other thing but Honey tempered with the powder
of Guaiac. Afterward is he every day three hours after every mealetide, to
take three ounces of this potion ensuing.

Take Juniper berries, and Bayberries, of each two ounces, Mustard seed half
an ounce, powne them all gross, and sees them in four pints of water unto
the half.

As long as one does use these things, he must keep himself out of the air,
and remain in a warm chamber, for that thereby the matter of the Pocks is
expelled outward toward the skin: and when you find that it breaks out,
then is he to wash himself with these things following: Take a quart of
Vinegar, Allume, and Verdigrease, of each one ounce, eight well brayed whites of
eggs: powne all that is to be powned, and then wash him with this Vinegar: when
he has thus washed him therewith, and especially where there be any scales,
then are they to be let dry, and the scales will fall off of themselves. Thus
fares it with this second cure, which is very safe, without any defect of the
inward or outward parts, by which means there be a great number cured.

And as we have said, his meat must be light of digesture, viz. young flesh,
eggs, and all that is dressed therewith; also all other things which make good
blood: but Milk, Cheese, Fruit, and such like be very highly forbidden in this
disease. For this may also be used the golden water, which stands described
amongst other in the last Part, whether it be drunken, or anointed outwardly
upon it. So is also Treacle highly recommended for the same.

The third cure of the Pockes.. 4.
THis cure ensuing have I tried my self in a woman, which had used many
sundry cures, and could not be helped: but by this means following she grew
to be so healthie, that I knew her twelve years after always in very good
health, without any hinderance of the same disease. First of all in this
disease (like as in all other such like) the patient is to be purged, and that
according to the ability of the person, and strength of nature. Further, in
eating and drinking he is to order himself like a woman in Childbed.

After the purgation, he is to take a good warm draught of the first and
strongest decoction, which is before described. Having taken the same, then is
he to be covered warm, to the end he may sweat well, even so much as his
power may well permit. The sweat is to be dried well with warm clothes: and
it were very good that the clothes wherewith he has been once dried should be
washed every time, and that he put on a clean shirt every morning: for if the
patient keep him warm and clean, then may the potion have her operation the
better.

At meals, and throughout the whole day may he use this potion following: Take
boiled rinds and Guaiac, lay them to steep as before, and sees them. This may
also be done even to the third time, and then to mix all the three decoctions
together. When one has about two quarts of the very strongest decoction, then
must he set again to steep fresh Guaiac and rinds, to the end that one may
betimes have more drink in a readiness. If so be that the patient have any
outward sore or scabbednesse, then is he to wash the same with the dregs of
this potion or lay it upon it with a cloth: and if so be that the sore be
somewhat deep, then be pledgents to be laid into it, which be made wet in the
dregs of this decoction.

This is so to be done in the morning after sweating, and in the evening one
hour before supper.

And if so be that these pledgents were baked therein, like as it happens also,
then are they to be wetted with a little of the warm potion, and then to lay
fresh to it again.

The clothes wherewith his sores be once dressed, are not to be used again
without washing. Now when as these sores be almost healed, and the flesh would
grow too proud, there is then a fine powder to be powned of the rinds, and to
be strewed oftentimes thereon; and also to be letten lie upon it, until that
there fall off dry scales: this powder dries much with all pain. But if so be
that it be a rich person, that had need of the use of this potion, then is he
to take of the best Rhenish wine, for that it is more penetrating than any
other, and also not too hot.

Of the fourth cure of the Pockes.. 5.
IT is first here to be noted, that in all these medicines ensuing, no proper
or due rules are prescribed, for that they be not set down by one Physician
only, but gathered together out of sundry men's works, according as the cause
requires: wherefore every one is (as he thinks best) to choose that which
likes him best. And for that cause be all these remedies ensuing ordained most
for them which could not be healed by the former decoction.

First, it is needful that the patient above all things, and before he use any
sirupe or purgation, do take one ounce of well washed Turpentine, with a little
flesh broth, or water of Fumitorie made warm: for this prepares the way for
all other Physic, to penetrate the better through the whole body. So that it
has been found before times, that thereby the working of the medicine has
been perceived even unto the great toe.

Whereby it may be known, what a power Turpentine has to open the way for
Physic. This Turpentine is also given with the decoction, or with Malmsey,
and it may also be made much stronger.

Take Turpentine as much as you will, and put it in a glass; afterward set it
in the warm Sun, and temper a little Sugar from day to day amongst it, then
stir it well about. This is especial good for the head, for the breast, for
the pain of the belly, for the gravel, and for the laxation of the body.

And to come again to our purpose: This sirupe following is especial good for
the Pockes: Take Seen leaves, Epythimum, yellow Mirobalans, Sebestes, Licorice,
and Rapontica, of each half an ounce, field Cipers three dragmes, Polypodie
roots, Fumitorie or the juice thereof, Hops or their juice, of each twelve
ounces, flowers of Burrage, of Violets, and Comin of each three drag. cut all
that is to be cut, and let it sees together in five quarts of wine, until
about a quart remain: afterward take of this decoction a pint, and temper
therewith the sirupe of Fumitorie, and of Hops, of each two ounces, Oxymel of
Squils one ounce and a half, sirupe of Violets one ounce, good Sugar as much
as you please: then take take thereof three ounces at once, and that with
Endive water.

You may also take this decoction with the infusion of Seen leaves, or water of
Fumitorie certain days together, augmenting or diminishing the same,
according as you would have it for to purge: this being done, you are to purge
with Cassie or any other thing, according to the quality of the cause, as is
beforesaid.

You have also in the third part, the 14 Chapter, and 5.. many kinds of things,
which be al good for the Pockes.

Of the letting of blood we have also spoken before, which also does much good
in this sickness, because that the bad blood is thereby diminished.

But therein is no certain order to be given, but you are to order your self
therein according to the quality of the cause and ability of the person. But
it is always especial good that the Hemorrhoides be opened: for if they bleed
not too much, then do they preserve one from the Pocks and Leprosy, as we have
taught in the tenth Chapter, in the beginning of the 5..

Before that now the inunction or Stricado be used, it is first exceeding
needful that one foment the joints, and that he take for it, Calmus, Marioram,
garden Mints, Horehound, Bayberries, Southernwood, and Docke roots, of each
one M. cut it all together, and sees it in well water, until about the third
part be consumed: with this decoction before and in the anointing, foment the
members which are to be anointed, and afterward with warm clothes dry up
the sweat, and then anoint them: this is to be pursued, as long as the
anointing indureth, which is commonly four or five days, and until the
pain does come in the teeth, the mouth and the flesh of the teeth excoriateth,
and the phlegm does excessiuely begin to issue and run, then is the inunction
to be stayed. For this be many kinds of salues prepared, and chiefly this
following: take Barrowes grease six ounces, Quicksiluer killed with the juice
of Sage three ounces, black Soap three quarters of an ounce, Argall beaten
small one ounce: make a salve thereof, and stir it together in a mortar the
space of half a day, that it may be very well tempered together.

This salve ensuing is very much used at Augusta: Take fresh Butter half an
ounce, Barrowes grease two ounces, Treacle and Mithridate, of each one quarter
of an ounce, mortified Quicksiluer one ounce and a half, prepared Litharge of
gold and salt, of each one dragme and a half, oil of Foxes, and good Aqua
vitae, of each one quarter of an ounce, Saffron five grains, Vnguentum
M^rcuriale.
afterward temper them all together: this salve is called Vnguentum
Mercuriale, and is by reason of the Treacle and the Mithridate much safer than
any other salve.

Item take Barrowes grease one ounce and a half, Turpentine and Quicksiluer,
of each half an ounce, powned Bayberries one drag, and a half, oil of
Juniper one dragme, oil of Euphorbium, and bruised Cinober, of each one quarter
of an ounce: temper it together. Item, take Barrowes grease four ounces,
Quicksiluer two ounces and a hal^e: sees it all together in sufficient
Vinegar, and put unto it ye ashes of Bechen wooo two ounces, oil of Bay one
ounce and a half, Masticke one ounce, Frankincense one ounce and three
quarters; temper them all together so long, until that the salve be bluish:
and then anoint therewith the patient but once a day, for that the salve is
strong.

Note also that in case if any body be anointed too much with Quicksiluer,
then is the juice of the greater Pimperneil to be given him to drink,
wherewith some be helped, in whom the Quicksiluer was seen to lie in the
veins.

And because there appear sundry accidents through the inunction, viz. Ach of
the teeth and gums, rawnesse and swelling of the throat, excessive slabbering,
weakness of nature, binding of the body, and such like, therein one must also
be provident.

First, the pain of the gummes is to be remedied with the juice of Wormwood,
wherein whites of Eggs be brayed; to wit, if one wash the teeth and the flesh
of the teeth with it, and cleanse the throat also with it. It helps likewise
for this to cleanse the mouth oftentimes with sheep milk.

Secondly, take Rose water, and honey of Roses, or other clear Honey tempered
with Whay.

Thirdly, this ensuing is much commended: take the juice of Laurel, and
cleanse therewith the mouth. Each one may try this that will.

Some do advise, that the mouth must be cleansed with cold water, or with the
juice of Nightshade, for that thereby will the flux of the mouth be stopped.

Fourthly, chew Linseede, or the roots of Woolblade.

Fifthly, this disease is to be eased with a kind of fomenting of the members,
which have been anointed before with warm water, wherein Rosemarie and Sage
is decocted.

Sixthly, it is needful, that the patient live very soberly, and do use good
strong brothes, and other forcible things, and that all his meats and drinks
be also mixed with all that which does strengthen and fortify the heart.

Seventhly, there is to be used for this, Conserues of Roses, of Buglosse, of
Burrage, Manus Christ's, with Pearls, and such like things that strengthen the
heart.

Eighthly, there is a common Clister to be set with Henbroth, Sugar, yolks of
eggs, and with Salt, thereby to resist all accidents and obstructions of the
body: and in great weakness of nature is he to use Sugar of Violets.

Ninthly, prepare this salve: Take Gum, Bears grease, and oil of Roses, of
each a like quantity: temper them together with a little oil of Balsam: then
is the patient to anoint therewith his face, both the temples of the head, and
his hands: for thereby shall he get again his natural color. Now to prevent
those foresaid accidents, give the patient one ounce and a quarter of Cassie,
to wit, after the fourth inunction. And when he begins to slabber, then hold
again from anointing, until two days afterward: then purge him again
after the third or fourth Stricado.

When you do prevent the matter in that manner, then will the putrefaction of
the mouth not be so hurtful.

For the sore and foul gums is this following very good: wash the mouth
oftentimes with Vinegar, wherein some Allume is molten. In the evening and
morning be the teeth to be anointed with the salve of Egypt: but beware of
swallowing the same salve down. For the rotting or putrefying of the gums
read in the first Part, the 13. Chap. and 7.. what is written there against
the foul gums.

Item, take honey of Roses and the juice of Mulberries, of each one ounce,
Plantaine water 8. ounces, Allume one quarter of an ounce, then temper them
together, and use it to the washing of the mouth. You may also set boxing cups
upon the shoulders.

For the Pockes that have continued long.. 6.
IF so be that this sickness be so stale or old, that it be not well to be
helped, then give the patient a Pill with Quicksiluer which is killed with the
juice of Limons, and with as much Rubarbe, viz. of each about one scruple: if
the pain be very great, then temper therewith Opium, and Saffron of each two
grains. This is to be done always about the second day, when he goes to bed,
or that he let himself be anointed the space of eight days, where otherwise
he ought to be anointed the space of three or four days. But always after
the fourth inunction is the patient to be purged, and to omit ye same day the
inunction, and afterward to go on with the inunction unto the end of the same
eight days, and when the eight days be complete and ended, then is he to
drink the decoction of Guaiac, made after the common manner. When as the third
part of this decoction is spent, then put unto it two ounces of Rapontica,
Turbith half an ounce, Carduus Benedictus, half a M. Agaricus half an ounce,
Seen leaves half a M. the rinds of Guaiac four ounces, good strong wine one
quart, then let so much thereof sees away as there is wine put unto it.

If so be that this will purge too strong, then give him rather ye potion of
Seen leaves, which is described in the third part, the eleventh Chapter, and
20.. every second day. These pills also ensuing may be used for purging: Take
Rapontica, Rubarbe, Manna and Aloe, of each one dragme, Ginger and Spica of
Indie, of each six grains: temper them all together with the sirupe of
Fumitorie, and make six pills of one dragme weight, and take thereof every
evening twain. The pills Aggregatiuae, and de Lapide Lazuli are also good for
this purpose.

If there be great pain with it.. 7.
IF now there be great pain with it, then take Frankincense, Litharge of gold,
Argall, Masticke, Ceruse and Allume, of each one quarter of an ounce, oil of
Bay and Aqua vitae, of each one ounce, Barrowes grease five ounces, mortified
Quicksiluer one ounce and a half, then temper them together unto a salve. This
salve does mellow all cores, and cleanses all ulcers.

Item, take Sallad oil, the oil of Foxes, or oil of Costus six ounces, and
sees therein one drag. of Quicksiluer; the same flies away, but the force of
the Quicksiluer remains still. This oil swageth all pain of the Pockes
maruellously.

Or take the spirit of wine, which is four times distilled, six ounces,
Quicksiluer which is mortified in Coperas water, one ounce and a half, yellow
Sanders three quarters of an ounce, Allume two drag. Lignum Aloes one drag.
Muscus eight grains, Ambra five grains, steep all these things together in
the spirit of wine, and make a cloth wet therewith, and wash all the places,
where the pain is: Or make a cloth wet, and lay the same upon it, and
especially upon all the joints.

Another: Take oil of Roses four ounces, washed Earthwormes and Turpentine, of
each half an ounce, Salt two drag. let it sees well together, and so lay a
cloth dipped in it, upon all the joints: you may also temper the oil of Foxes
amongst it, and then it is not only good for the sinews, but also especially
for all pain of the Pockes.

Of the Byles in the Pockes.. 8.
IF there appear any blisters or byles in this sickness upon any, then
anoint the same three times a day with a salve which is before described in
the first Chapter, and twelfth. beginning thus: Take small powned Litharge of
Gold, etc. But the expert Physicians for the Pockes do deem that there is
nothing better for the Byles of the Pockes, than vnflect Lime tempered with
black Soap, for that this opens the skin, and thereby will the pain also
be taken away.

You have also in the fourth part, the sixth Chapter, and second. in the
description of Sciatica, two very good and safe salues made of Hollihocke
roots, and Elecampane roots, for to mollisie all hard nodes or knots. The
gray plaster Diachilon may also be used very well for it.

But in case that the same be so hard, and so irremediable, that they must be
opened by a potentiall cauterie: we will put a meet Chirurgian in trust with
the same, yet we will here teach the making of a corosiue to be used at need,
which is thus to be done.

Take Vine sticks, burn them to ashes, and ashes of Beechen wood, of each a
like quantity, power sufficient water upon it, and then let it run four times
through a bag. Of this ley take three quarts, and put unto it blew willow
ashes, vnsleckt Lime, ashes of the Vine and of the Beech tree, of each half a
pound: let this stand so the space of eight days in a wooden vessel,
stirring it about every day three or four times; afterward filter it so long
until it be very clear. This Lie are you then to sees in an iron pan upon a
good fire, so long till it be sodden thick enough. Now for to know whether it
be enough, stick a quill into it, and if the feathers do fall off, then take
the pan from the fire, and hold it on one side, to the end it may run all
together, and may be hard. It is also here to be marked, that when as in
seething it begins to make bladders, or bubbles (like as pappe is wont to
do) then is it a sign that it is sufficiently decocted, and then cast it on a
board, and cut it parcel wise. When it is thorough cold and waxen hard, then
keep it in a glass stopped very close and tight, in a dry place.

Another: Take vnslect Lyme, Vine ashes, Willow ashes, Argall, and burnt
Saltpeter, of each a like quantity, powne it all small, and put it in a new
pot: afterward power sharp Lie upon it, and so let it stand three days
space, but stir it oftentimes about: filter this Lie so often that it be very
clear, at the last sees it and keep it as before.

For all open sores in the Pockes.. 9.
TAke Ceru^e as much as you please, and Sallad oil as much as is needful and a
little Vinegar and Rosewater, bruise them together upon a rubbing stone, and
anoint therewith the running sores of the Pockes, and other.

Item: Take oil of Roses, Saltpeter, and peeled Almonds, of each a like
quantity, Camfere a little, then rub it all together as before.

For this may you also according to the importance of the cause temper small
bruised Tuty, for that this heals marvelous well all sores, and especially
those which do stand about the throat: but if it be feared that they eat too
deep inwards, then are they to be anointed before and after meat.

For the Scales and other spots.. 10.
TAke oil of Camelina, and oil of sweet Almonds of each four ounces, Butter
and marrow of Ox bones, of each three ounces the grease of Geese and of Ducks,
of each one ounce, white Wax two ounces, make a salve thereof. This salve has
a marvelous virtue in mollifying all scales, impostumes, and other
scirrhosities which proceed of melancholy, and all hardened sinews. Will you
then have this salve to assuage the pain more? then temper the brayed yolks
of three eggs amongst it, and one dragme of Saffron. If you then desire to
have it pierce more stronger, then take Bdellium and Ammoniacum, of each one
ounce; dissolve them in Vinegar, and put them amongst it; then sees them
until that all the moisture be consumed, and stir it together one amongst
another.

Now for to heal all cicatrices, marks and spots, use this ensuing: Take a
pound of Sulfure, beat the same gross, and sees it with water in a covered
pot: but look to it, that there go no vapor out of it: afterward hold the
member over it, and receive the vapor thereof: afterward annoint it with
sweet Butter. You shall also find good things for this in the description of
burning.

The fourth Chapter. Of the Leprosy.
AL famous Physicians do esteem no disease upon earth to be more terrible and
hurtful than the right Leprosy: for this malady does so vehemently infect the
body, that it not only infeebleth all the members of the whole body, but
spoileth and putrifieth also the same on all sides, that the members will fall
parcelwise from the body: and it takes away utterly his whole natural
essence, for that his nose will be crooked, broad, and fallen down, his lips
great, thick, and swollen, and his ears sharp; so that these people besides
that they be disdained and despised of all the world, as if they were the
filthiest creatures on earth, they must live and die in misery. And to the end
that we might partly learn to know the misery which is caused through the
Leprosy, these are the most common signs; the falling out of the hair of the
beard and the eybrowes, hoarse speech, a short, heavy and stinking breath,
great continual thirst, hardening and swelling of the spleen, unnatural heat
of the liver and of the kidneyes, wherewith is commonly gravel also: the
patient will be vexed with terrible dreams, and will be much plagued (as it is
commonly said) with the Nightmare. He will also be vexed with much wind of the
belly, and with great binding. Also the fingers and toes do rankle and swell,
the nails do sliuer and cleave, and spoil, that at last they do fall out.
Wheresoever they have any opennesse, there runs out always a black,
loathsome and stinking matter. Otherwise they have over the whole body a hot,
irksome and itching scabbednesse with blisters and scales, which for the most
part do appear in the throat and in the nostrils, whereby they do take away
the breath from the patient. He gets thick cornels or knobs on the skin of
the thighs, legs and feet, which do get a numbnesse, whereby the natural
lively color is altered into a dead, black and blew color. The eyes do also
get another form or fashion, whereby their sight is darkened.

These be now (like as is said, and shall yet be said) the most common signs
of the Leprosy, especially of that which the learned do call Elephantiasin,
whereby all the foresaid signs do show themselves not all at one time, but
always a good part of them. It happens also well, that otherwhiles but one
member only, or some part of the body is infected with this disease, and not
the whole body.

We will also discover somewhat here of the causes of this sickness. It may be
caused of a bad air, as in time of the plague, by conuersing or dwelling
besides Leapers, or by much speech with them; for that through their venomous
breath may one be easily infected. And this is such a disease, whereby the one
is not only infected of the other, but the children also do inherit the same
from their parents; so that whether the man or the woman be infected with it,
the other will soon take it also. This miserable sickness is wont also to be
caused of great anger, long sorrow, fear and faintheartednes, whereby much
melancholicke blood is engendered, and then out of it the Leprosy. Item, of the
long use of melancholic meats, as Pease, Beans, etc. old cheese, Goats
flesh, Bears flesh, Foxes, Asses, and measelly Swines flesh, all old salt
flesh, gross fish, milk and fish eaten together, and such like things more.
Item through too hot a liver, whereby the blood is burnt

The Leaprosie is divided by the learned into four parts, and each species of
the same called after a certain beast, for that it has a little likeness to
the nature of the same beast: whereof the first is Leonina, of the Lions, the
second Tyria, of the venomous snake Tyro: the third Alopecia, of the Fox: the
fourth Elephantiasis, of the Elephant.

The first species has her name of the Lion, for that they that be therewith
infected, be raging and mad, as otherwhiles the Lions be. This species is
caused through an ouerheated and burnt blood, whereby they also get a
deformity of the face, which is horrible to look upon: they do cry out, and
beat their bodies so vehemently that their own skin does thereby harden: they
be also so hungry and thirsty, that they cannot be satisfied: they are also
deprived altogether of sleep, until that at last they be very mad and
distraught.

Concerning the second sort, it is well known throughout all the world, that
the Snakes do at a certain time renew themselves, strippe off their skin
from them, and do get a new: the which also happens in this sort of Leprosy,
otherwhiles ten or twelve times a year, so that their skin goes off with
great heat and sharp pain, out of which runs a subtle matter which
infecteth the parts round about it: and this not only therefore, but also for
that this kind of Leprosy does infect and hurt all other people dwelling by.
This Leprosy is also contagious, that all whatsoever he spoileth does stink
none otherwise than do the holes of these sorts of Snakes Tyri.

The third species which is called after the Fox: it is very well known that
this beast is subtle and ravenous, also frequenteth unknown and secret holes:
also commonly twice a year comes to cast his hair, and at last consumes
utterly.

This species of Leprosy is also of this nature, that the patient can by no
means be persuaded for to use any counsel, but fears always that he shall
be extenuated. At the first have we admonished, that the patients beard and the
hair of his eyelids will fall out: the same happens in this also, for that
because his meat and drink can alter into no natural nourishment, therefore
will not only the nourishment of the hair be taken away, but also the
sustenance of the whole body, whereby the patient must attenuate and consume.

The fourth species receives her name of the Elephant: the cause of this
Leprosy comes through the use of all bad and melancholicke meats, the which
cannot sustain a body, nor engender sound flesh, but do rather spoil and
destroy the same. In like manner do they also clean change the natural color
of the body, and make the same a dark gray, like as is the color of the
Elephant. Other are of opinion that this name proceeds of a loathsome sight,
for that this disease has a loathsome sight. In like manner also for the
altering of the voice, which seems like to the voice of an Elephant, with
other more such like things. But for that at the first in all such leaprous
people the head oftentimes and the whole body do swel so, that one may say
very well that he is like to an Elephant: their face is sometime so terrible to
look upon, that one should be affrighted of the same, as of a terrible beast;
for that their face, fingers and toes be full of sores, and those so great as a
Nutmeg or Bean, and of the color of a Mulberrie, which is not as yet
thoroughly ripe. When as these come to impostumate, then do they yield (as is
said) a stinking matter: the eyelids do also swell sometimes so thick as a
finger, afterward they do split and cleave. But this is not all, for they do
hurt also the mouth, the throat and the nose so wonderfully that the patient
can hardly get his ^reath, and do alter afterward commonly into the canker,
and into all such peril, that he comes to stifle thereby. The ears be also
commonly full of sores and scales, and be also sometimes eaten up that they fall
off, yea do so eat inwards that they make the patient utterly deaf. The
arteries and other veins of the neck will be apparently filled full of thick
and clotted blood, whereby the voice will be hoarse and ulcers and blisters do
appear in the joints with a great hardness of the spleen, and is almost a
general numbnes of all the members, so that they cannot use them. Lastly
(which is most of all to be wondered at) this sickness does commonly cause the
great rupture Buris, whereof we have written in the third part, the first
chapter, and 8..

Out of these four species of Leprosy may each expert man well guess, that
the first species is caused through a burnt choleric melancholy: the second
species out of a phlegmatic melancholy: the third out of melancholy which is
mixed with blood: and the fourth of a burnt melancholicke matter: therefore
this last kind of Leprosy is much worse than any of the rest. This may suffice
of the nature and causes of the Leprosy. Now we will come to the Physical
means which may be used against it.

For this above all are these general rules to be observed: First, although
the Leprosy has settled her root, yet letting of blood is good, but very
little, like as also no strong purgations be good: for when this sickness is
confirmed, then is the matter without the veins and in the outward members,
out of which it is not to be expelled. Secondly, this sickness is not to be
driven away, but only at the first through the purging of the melancholicke,
and other bad humors. Thirdly, I take that there be much spoiled blood instant,
then is a vein to be opened, whether it be in the arm or upon the hand. But
if there be not much blood instant, then is letting of blood to be omitted.
Fourthly, both the veins of the throat (whereof we have written in the
Introduction) are to be opened in great hoarsnesse, and that especially if one
be afraid of stifling. Fifthly, there be in the beginning no strong medicines
(especially Hellebore) to be given, for that this matter is not to be purged,
but it is rather to be put in practice with mild things which do purge
melancholy. Sixthly, each one that is infected with this disease shall beware of
venery. Seventhly, neither bathes nor salues are to be used before and until
that the patient be duly purged, for the gross matter does obstruct the pores.
Eighthly, the flesh of the snake Tyrus, and all things wherein the same shall be
tempered, are very meet for leprous people, and advised to be used by all
learned men.

Of means and medicines against the Leprosy.. 1.
THe famous Physician Galenus does write thus: the Leprosy is an alteration of
natural warmth, which appears with terrible and itching sores. And yet in
another place he does admonish that (in the beginning of Elephantiasis) he has
healed it through letting of blood, and through strong purging of melancholy:
therefore must these sicknesses at the first (and as soon as they can be
perceived) be remedied; for which one is to imitate this process ensuing: and
although the same be more inclined to the healing of Elephantiasis than to any
of the other kinds, nevertheless the same is meet to heal all Species of
Leprosies.

An order of diet.. 2.
FOrasmuch as melancholy is of a dry and cold nature, therefore must (to the
contrary) warm and moist things be used for to mitigate the matter according
as the humor is weighty, mean, little, and venomous. First then concerning
the air, the patient is to keep himself in a meetely warm and moist air,
and that especially about rocks that are lying toward the East, the South, or
toward the North, and also about some springing fountains. But if the wind
comes to blow over some odoriferous trees or flowers, then is it the better:
but if one cannot get such an air, and that the time of the year be very hot,
then sprinkle the chamber with fresh water wherein Violets, Waterlillies and
Lettice be decocted. Also lay these Trociskes ensuing upon hot coals,
therewith for to fume the chamber: Take Violets and waterlillies, of each one
ounce, the seeds of Lettice, of Endive, and of small Endive, of each half an
ounce, the seeds of Melons, of Pompeons, of Gourds and of Cucumbers, all
together peeled, of each one dragme and a half, Starch half an ounce, Camfer
one dragme; make Trocisks thereof with the juice of Lettice, each about half
an ounce in weight. When the same be dried, then powne them to powder, and let
the patient therewith fume his dwelling, viz. in the morning, at noone, and in
the evening.

Although now his dwellings were situated toward the North, and toward cold
winds, yet is this fumigation very requisite for him, but the leaves of apple
trees, or of sweet Pomgranats, or of Almonds, or such like decocted amongst
them are to be put unto it: also all his linen, and especially his shirts are
to be washed with the same water. In like manner also are his clothes to be
fumed. Further, this bag ensuing is to be prepared for to smell unto it.

Take sealed earth and fine Bolus, of each one quarter of an ounce, the flowers
of Burrage, of Buglosse, of Basil, of each one dragme and a half, Violets and
Waterlillies, of each one quarter of an ounce, Camfer half a scruple, wild
Vine leaves, Broom flowers, and Lettice seed, of each three quarters of an
ounce, powne each alone, temper them very well one amongst another, and then
bind it in a fine cloth. He must also beware of all such clothes as do wring
the head and the breast too hard, or be too narrow. The hands and the feet are
in summer with linen, and in winter with good warm sheep pelts to be kept
warm, and also the head preserved from all cold.

Concerning his meat, it should be very good that all his bread were kneaded
with water of Purslaine, of Lettice of Endive, or with some such like waters, a
little salted, but meetly baked, and not eaten before it be two days old. All
his flesh must be light for to be digested, as namely Pullets, field fowls,
fat Duckes, Partridges, Phesants, Finches, wood Pigeons, and such like. Amongst
all other flesh is good for him the flesh of young Goats, Lambs, Calves, young
swine, of young Muttons, Hearts; and especially of young Conies, young house doves
and Hares, shall he not eat, because that the melancholicke humors by them are
engendered. All river fish which is not slimie, is very good for him, rather
sodden than roasted. All fruit that is sweet, as Cherries, Cresses, hasell
nuts, Almonds, Muscadell grapes, and other sweet Grapes shall not only be
permitted, but much rather be advised for to use them. In like manner fresh
Figs, and water drunken upon it, Peaches, sweet Apples, and sweet
Pomegranates are very good in this sickness: but all sower fruit is to be
forborne, for that vinegar and all whatsoever is sower does harm much the
melancholicke persons. Walnuts, Chestnuts, Quinces, Services, and such must he
forbear. The decoction of red and white pease, and these green herbs, viz.
Spinach, Lettice, Beetes, Endive and Purslaine be very good for him, and
especially if some Fennel be chopped amongst them. Item, ripe Melons, because
they cool and moisten, are not ill for him. Milk is also for this sickness
not discommended. All hot spice, as Pepper, Cinnamome, Galingall and Ginger are
hurtful unto him, for that the matter thereby is the more burnt. But for to
prevent the consumption, this powder following is to be prepared: Take Saffron
one dragme, Cinnamom two dragmes, Mace three dragmes, the seed of Violets, of
water lillies, of Sorrel, and of Endive, red and white Coral, red and white
Saunders, of each one dragme, powne each alone, and temper them together. Item,
he may also use Hens grease, Duckes grease, Calves sewet, Mutton sewet, if it
be not much salted, for all these sewets be much better in this sickness than
butter. Leekes, Garlic, Siues and Radishes are to be refrained, or at
leastwise used very seldom. In like manner also salted fish, salted flesh, and
such like. The stomach, the liver, the heart, and chiefly the spleen of what
beasts soever they be, is he not to eat, howbeit the brains of beasts being
sodden are not ill.

As concerning his drink, he is to beware drinking of all kind of red thick
wine, and also of all white wine which is strong, and ascends or climeth into
the head, but a mild, white, and sweet wine which is not strong. And if this
kind of wine cannot be had, then is his wine to be tempered with good well
water or fountain water. When it is cold weather, then may he use Honey water,
which from twenty quarts of water and one quart of Honey is decocted unto the
fourth part. When the Grapes be ripe in the forepart of winter, then is always
this wine following to be prepared: Take one hundred quarts and a half, or two
hundred quarts of sweet Must, and steep therein twelve ounces of green small
Endive cut very small Elecampane roots eighteen ounces, the seed of Docke and
of Sorrel, of each one ounce, then put it all together in wine, and let the
wine stand over a year and be very clear. If the wine be now too strong, then
temper in the drinking good well water with it, or let it sees together. Of
this wine is he to drink all the whole winter even to the end of March: but
from the month of March until the end of the month of September, then take
Must and fountain water, of each one hundred quarts, Liuerwort, water Cresses
and garden Cresses, of each six ounces, green Citron leaves twelve ounces,
cut them very small, and let it sees all together. When this potion is
cleansed, then drink it as before.

The patient is also to see to it that he eat not without hunger, nor drink
without thirst, and and especially if his stomach be not well framed. To the
contrary, he is not to fast any longer than till he feels that the meat in
his stomach be clean spent. Many dishes or messes be not good for him, but
all spoon meats that are thin are very meet for him. He is to beware of all
dry meats. He is also to hold him sober in drinking, that the meat come not to
swim in the stomach. If so be he find after meat that his meat do trouble
him, then is he to take this following for to parbrake it out again: Take
three ounces of water wherein Radishes be decocted, white sugar and honey, of
each half an ounce, Salgemmae three grains, Comin five grains, Vinegar two
ounces, temper them together and drink it lukewarm. But in case that the
vomiting will not yet follow after it, then thrust your finger or a fether in
your throat as deep as you can, which is made fat with oil. If it will not
yet be, then must it be looked to, that the meat come not to rot in the
stomach, and there engender an ague of it, which is to be done with this
potion following: Take fresh prepared Cassie which is prepared with water of
Violets one ounce, water wherein the herb Mercury has been decocted three
ounces, then make them warm together, and drink it at one good draught.

Of sleeping and waking.. 3.
THey that be burdened with this disease, ought to sleep the space of eight
hours at the least, and to go to bed one hour after meat, and to turn
oftentimes about from one side to the other. The head is to lie very high, and
to sleep half sitting. When it is cold weather, then is he to cover his whole
body, and especially his head very warm. Reasonable exercise is very good for
him, if so be that he can exercise himself. His head must he let be oftentimes
and softly rubbed. Last of all he is to beware of all motions of the mind, as
from anger, sorrow, and such like, for that these things do augment the burning
of the melancholy.

Let this suffice to be spoken of the order of diet, whereof we shall hereafter
discourse more at large, and teach also how this matter might be diminished and
expelled.

Of letting of blood.. 4.
WE have before expressed in the general rules how that letting blood in the
confirmed leprosy may not avail, except it be seen that the patient be very
full of blood: for which, setting of boxes is also very commodious, whether it
be in the neck, the shoulders, the thighs, or upon the calves, and upon other
places mo according to the importance of the cause. But if so be that the
Leprosy be not rooted, then is first the letting of blood to be used, and that
for an vnburthening of the noisome matter.

But if now the patient be very plethoricke, and the veins be full of blood,
then must one open the patients Median in the left arm, and let out three or
four ounces of blood. Or if there appear such fulness of blood about the
liver, then is the liver vein to be opened in the right arm. But if there be
any fullness in the veins about the head, then is the head vein to be opened,
and that upon the hand about the great thomb. This letting of blood is in the
beginning of the Leprosy, one of the most principallest medicines and means,
because that the burning blood can through no more commodious way be expelled.

After letting blood (or if it be not esteemed needful) do all learned commend
the potion of Epithymo, whereof there be three sorts in the first part, the
twelfth Chapter, and eight. described, whereof the patient shall take in the
morning betimes four or six ounces very warm, and then to sleep one hour
upon it, for it is a very mild laxatiue, and afterward he is to fast six
hours after it. But if you desire a weaker potion, then take fresh roots of
Polipodie, powned Seen leaves, Thymus and Epithymus, of each one dragme,
Mirobalani Indi one quarter of an ounce, Whay five ounces, Annis, Cinnamome,
wild yellow Rape seed and Mace, of each half a scruple, and beat it small,
and steep it the space of 24. hours in warm Whay, afterward wring it out,
and so give it to drink. Item, take the confection of Seen leaves three
quarters of an ounce, and temper it with whay of Goats milk: this is a safe
and elected medicine. This following is somewhat stronger: Take Seen leaves one
dragme, Indy salt, prepared Azure stone, and fine Bolus, of each two grains,
then give it warm with three ounces of the water of Hops. Or take two ounces
of the juice of the leaves of Polipodie, temper it with one ounce of good wine
unto a potion. If you will have this more pleasant, then take the distilled
water which is distilled out of the leaves and roots of Polipodie.

Had you rather take pills? then let these following be prepared: Take
Polipodie, Thymus, and Epithymus, of each five grains, prepared Azure stone,
and fine Bolus, of each half a scruple, Annis, Mace and Ginger, of each two
grains, Indy salt three grains, then make thereof seven or nine pills, and
that with the juice of Roses for to be taken at one time. After this, may one
bring together many purging things, but these beforesaid be sufficient for a
pattern and example.

The clisters may be made thus: Take Burrage, Buglosse, the uttermost of the
Agaricus, Elecampane roots, and fresh Polipodie, of each one handful, then
sees them all together in sufficient water unto the half, then take thereof
twelve or sixteen ounces for a clister, without any other addition.

Another. Take of this foresaid decoction twelve ounces, Butter half an ounce,
then temper them all together: Or take good sweet Wine wherein Mallows and
Violet leaves have been decocted four ounces, confection of Seen leaves and
Cassy, of each half an ounce, Indy salt one scruple, temper them well together,
and then set it very warm as a clister. Here follows a stronger: Take
Coloquint, Mirobalani Indi, Emblici, Epithymus, Thymus, Fumitorie and Seen
leaves, of each one handful, sees all together in sufficient water even to
the half, and use them without any other addition for a clister. There may
also be taken six ounces of the decoction wherein an Hedgehog is boiled, and
putting thereto four ounces of the oil of Violets, Indy salt one dragme,
confection of Hamech three quarters of an ounce, and temper this together unto
a Clister.

But this following is the mildest, and notwithstanding the most commodious:
Take whay of Goats milk 12. or 16. ounces, Cassie one ounce, and set it warm.

If it be seen that the matter do annoy more the head than any other member,
then is this laxatiue potion to be used: Take the confection of Diasena and
Hamech, of each three dragmes, the decocted or distilled water of Betonie,
water of Violets, or of the Sauine tree, of each one ounce and a half, temper
it all together. If so be that the breast be most of all infected, then take
Agaricus one dragme and a half, Mirobalani Indi one quarter of an ounce, fresh
Polipodie, and the husks of the Seen leaves, of each one dragme, Fennel
water, and water of Hyssop, of each two ounces; make it warm, and steep the
rest the space of 24. hours in it: afterward drink it warm in the morning
early.

Or if so be that these melancholicke humors do bruise the Liver most of all,
and the rest of the intrailes, then is this following to be used: Take Annis,
Spica, Violet seed, Cuscuta seed, Sorrel seed and Masticke, of each half a
dragme, Roses, and the leaves of the wild Vine, of each four scruples, sees
them all together in six ounces of water even to the half: take of this
decoction and temper therein of the confection ad melancholiam Auicennae.

These be now the things whereby all such noisome humors may be diminished.
First it is to be considered how the gross melancholic blood might be drawn
from the vital parts to the outside: for this is very good after the use of
the former purgation that the patient do forcibly stir and exercise himself,
viz. to go a foot, and to clime up to the mountains, whereby natural heat
might be provoked, and the matter consumed.

Secondly, it is very good that he be rubbed from the neck along the backbone
downwards, and from the shoulders to the hands, and from the thighs to the
feet with hot clothes, until the skin be very red.

Thirdly, he shall bathe in this bath following morning and evening: Take fresh
or dry Fumitorie twelve ounces, the Elecampane leaves, Violet leaves, and
small Housleeke, of each six ounces, Cammomill, Melilot, and Spica Romana, of
each eight ounces, sees them together in so much water as is needful: in this
shall the patient bathe, and be softly rubbed.

Fourthly, prepare this salve following: Take oil of Sesamum six ounces,
Cammomill, Dill seed, Burrage flowers, and Fumitorie, of each one dragme,
flowers of Elecampane and Dock seed, of each one dragme and a half; powne them
all small, steep them, and sees them all together in the foresaid oil unto
the half: afterward anoint therewith the body twice or thrice a day, and
especially the whole backbone, and also all other parts which are infected.

There is also used for this hot and blistering herbs, viz. pouned, wherewith
the members may be rubbed, whereby the bad humors be drawn outward toward the
skin: these herbs be Marierom, Penniroyall, wild Thime, Nepe and Crowfoote,
which have an especial power for to draw out the melancholic humors toward
the skin, changing them into water, through the blisters which appear after
this chafing. Some do use Cantharides, but they are too strong, for they expel
urine very violently, yea that the blood follows with it, and do excoriate
the conduits of the urine if the same be used at any one time in many places.

For this is also good boxing cups set on the outward members, and the skin
picked. If so be that there be any other soreness or impostumation with it,
then have you before in the second how the patient is to parbrake, the which is
very meet for this.

But in these cases there is nothing better than to open the hemorrhoides,
which may be effected by the rubbing of fig-leaues, or by the rubbing with the
leaves of Comfrey: also with rubbing with an hairen cloth which is steeped in
an Ox gall.

There may also a small boxing cup be set upon the fundament, and when as the
arsegut does appear and come forth, then may the veins which do as then
appear be opened with a lancet, and to let them bleed so long, until that the
thick and gross blood do alter into clear and thin blood. This is also to be
done four times a year, for it is very commodious.

For to expel the matter of this sickness by urine.. 5.
Afterward it is also very meet, that this noisome matter be driven out
thorough the urine, for which you are to use one ounce or more of the potion of
Epithymo, or of the water wherein Epithymus is decocted, whereof the patient is
in the morning and also at afternoon to drink, for that it drives out a
black and melancholic urine.

Or take in the morning early one ounce of the juice of Smallage. Item, take
three ounces of the juice of Pease, or the decoction wherein Pease be boiled.

There is also Azure stone sodden in the water of Millet, and take thereof
three ounces: Take Indie Spica one quarter of an ounce, Mirobalani indi three
dragmes, sees them in nine ounces of Fennel water even to the half,
afterward strain it through a cloth, and wring it out hard, and then drink
it. The flowers of Broom be also taken for this, Madder, Valerian and Mew, of
each one handful, let them sees all together in eighteen ounces of water
unto the half, and then drink thereof four or five ounces with powned
Licorice and Gromell seed, of each half a dragme tempered therewith.

Wherewith the Mouth and other parts are to be washed.. 6.
TAke the decoction of Linseede four ounces, and Oxymel compositum two ounces;
temper them well together, and wash the mouth oftentimes with it always twice
before supper, and two hours before diner. You may also after the same manner
chew Swines bread and spit it out again: or in stead thereof chew Agaricus,
which is more forcible and more safe.

Item prepare this garga^isme ensuing: Take Mirobalani Indi, Violets, Burrage
flowers, and Buglosse flowers, of each one dragme, the roots of Polipodie one
quarter of an ounce, Indie salt one dragme, the husks of Seen one quarter of
an ounce: sees them all together in twelve ounces of water even to the half,
and use it warm always one hour before noone, and an hour before supper: to
wit, ten or twelve times together. This ensuing is also much commended for the
Leprosy, if it be often washed therewith in the beginning: Take Mirrhe and
Sar^ocolla, of each three dragmes, Ireos, roots of Fumitorie, of Mew, and
Hartwoort, of each three quarters of an ounce, black Helle^ore two ounces, the
seeds of Mallows, of Hollthocks, of Fumitorie, and the leaves of Elecampane,
of each three handfuls, cut them and stamp them together, afterward let them
sees in two quarts of water unto three pintes.

In like manner there is also much commended for this the golden water, if that
one do take a little and oftentimes thereof, and do anoint the Leprosy
therewith. The oil of Tiles is also much commended in the beginning of the
Leprosy.

But because the most principal cure of this Leprosy consists in consuming
of the melancholic matter of this sickness, and that the blood must be well
cleansed: therefore will we to that end describe certain good things,
beginning first with the least.

Whereby the blood in the Leprosy shall be cleansed.. 7.
TAke the water of Hops, and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a half,
temper them together, and give it in the Summer cold, and in the Winter warm.
Item: Take the whay of Goats milk, or of Sheep milk, and drink thereof in
the morning like as is said before. This following is also more forcible: Take
four ounces of Cheese whay made of sheep milk, and the juice of Fumitorie,
temper them all together, and so drink it warm. These three things have an
especial property with the breast, with the liver, and with the stomach, and
do consume all burnt humors of the same. Item: Take the sirupe of Epithymo one
ounce and a half, the water of Elecampane, of Sorrel, and of small Endive, of
each one ounce and a half, temper them together, and drink it certain days
together: the same expels the gross matter. This following is also meet
for the same: take Syrupum de Thymo, Acetosum compositum, de Byzantijs, of each
half an ounce, water of Smallage, and of Fumitorie, of each one ounce and a
half, and use them as before.

This ensuing is especial good for the Melancholy which is caused through
burnt blood, and where it may evidently be seen, that heat of the liver, of
the breast, and of the head is with it: Take the seeds of Melons, of
Cucumbers, of Pompeons, and of Gourds, of each three drag. flowers of Violets,
of Burrage, Buglosse, and of small Endive, the seed of Sorrel, of small
Endive, and of Waterlillies, of each one handful and a half, Fumitorie
flowers, Elecampane roots, red and white Saunders, burnt Iuorie, red and white
Coral, of each one dragme, the juice of sweet apples six and thirty ounces,
fresh Mallows, Endive, Sorrel, Hops, Purslaine, and Lettice, of each three
handfuls, Dock leaves, Elecampane roots, Bistorta, Swines bred, and Gentian,
of each one handful, wild Vine leaves, small Housleeke and Liuerwoort, of each
three handfuls, sees this all together (except the juice of Apples) in four
quarts of water unto the half, afterward wring it out hard and strain it:
this being done, then put to this decoction the juice of Apples, and three
ounces of sharp Vinegar,, white Sugar six and thirty ounce, then sees them
all together (always skumming) by a mild fire, until that about the third
part be wasted, whereof you are to keep the one half, and the other half are
you to sees to a sirupe; for that of the first is every day to be taken five
ounces, and of that which is sodden to a sirupe two ounces, with water of
Agrimonie, and Fumitorie: to wit, of each one ounce and a half. This has done
maruels, but it must be continually used the space of six weeks or two
months.

This sirupe (as also all other) is always to be taken when the meat is
digested in the stomach, and afterward to sleep an hour or twain, and then
with out doing any great labor, to fast five hours after it. In Summer it is
to be taken cold, and in Winter lukewarm.

For to consume the remanent matter.. 8.
WHen you do perceive that this matter is much diminished, then give the
patient during the space of a month, always early in the morning one dragme
of powned Nepe with Sheep whay, for it is a safe remedy. In like manner you
may give unto this patient some days together one ounce of the juice of Marsh
mints or of white water Mints, and that especially in the beginning of this
sickness. The powder of burnt Hedgehogges flesh has an especial power for to
consume this matter, if that one take the weight of a dragme oftentimes with
Whay, or give him oftentimes half a dragme of Treacle with the decoction of
Hedghogs flesh. These be now sufficient and sure things chosen out of diverse
others.

If so be that there remain any bad matter in the joints, then must the same
(if one will have perfect health) be also consumed, to the end that thereby
(the same there remaining) the whole body be not infected again. For which
these two bathes are to be used at the first: take Marioram twelve ounces,
Bayberries, the seeds of Licebane and Mustard seed, of each six ounces,
Sulphur vise four ounces, the Earth called Sinopida two ounces, then sees
them al together in much water unto the half, then bath therewith the space of
five or six days twice a day. When the patient comes out of the bath, then
is his whole body to be anointed with Treacle, and the same to be rubbed in
well. Afterward he is to go to bed, and to sweat well upon it: and although
he could not sweat well at the first, yet give him after bathing half a dragme
of the Treacle Diatesseron, with a little water of Violets, and then cover him
close. When he has thus bathed, then is he to use this bath following: Take
Fenegreeke, and the seeds of white Sesamum, of each twelve ounces, the roots
of Lillies six ounces: then let them sees together to a bath as before, yet
in bathing is the body to be rubbed with black Soap, and then to ly a bed as
is said.

When as now the matter is sufficiently prepared through bathing, and drawn
toward the skin, then does the cause require that it might be consumed,
whereto stronger medicines be necessary, like as this ensuing may be prepared:
Take Verdigrease, Orpiment, Coperas, and white Cadmia, of each six ounces,
vnsleckt lime twelve ounces, the roots of Crowfoot eighteen ounces, Allume
four ounces, Salarmoniack eight ounces, powne them all together, and then
distill them in a helm, as strong water is wont to be made, and anoint
therewith all scales and blisters every where.

The third day are you to anoint them with this following: Take one ounce and
a half of Starch, and washed litharge of gold two ounces, vnsleckt lime one
dragme and a half, Dragonbloud half an ounce, Vinegar as much as is needful
for to temper together, afterward temper them together in a leaden mortar.

Other do use this following: Take the swet soote of the chimney two ounces,
lytharge of gold one ounce, Frankincense half an ounce, Mastick five dragmes,
oil of Juniper, and oil of Wheat, of each four ounces, yellow Wax two
ounces, powne all small that be to be powned, and then temper therewith two
ounces of the oil of Violets, afterward put unto it the gold lytharge, the
Masticke, and Frankincense, and at last a little Vinegar, yet stirring it
always about. Other do temper amongst it six ounces of the juice of Cuccopit
roots.

What is to be used for the Scales.. 9.
IF that there be any scales upon any sores, then are they to be anointed with
this salve following: Take the oil of Sesamum, Asses sewet, of each six
ounces, the yolke of an egg, Camfer half a dragme, then temper them all
together with sufficient whites of eggs, it is also good against al heat of the
joints, it heals and causes the flesh to engender.

If so be that these foresaid scales will not fall off of themselves, then do
some take them off with Rasors, even to the root, yet not altogether at one
time, but one before, and another afterward. The blood do they staunch with
powned litharge of gold. They do make also a salve with fresh Hares blood, or
with a young man's blood, which is very meet for this. The anointing with this
salve is to be done but once in three days, and then to wash the party with
some water wherein Bran is decocted. You have also more at large of these
things in the Chapter where the Pockes be discoursed of.

When as after all this the matter proceeds well the space of two or three
months, then is one not to foreslow purging in the mean whiles, but to take
good heed to these two things ensuing.

First, to the stopping of the nose, which makes an unseemly speech, and for
to let that, make a long taint of Cotton, anoint it with the salve of Citron
(which one finds commonly ready at the Apothecaries) strew thereon small
powned lytharge of gold, or Hartwoort, or in the stead thereof take the
con^ection of Aurea Alexandrina.

Further, you are to spout in the nose some lukewarm wine, amongst which a
little vinegar of Squils is tempered.

Secondly, because that the hair of the eyelids fallen out do give a great
deformity, therefore it is to be looked to, that the same be made to grow
again, whereof you may read in the sixth Chapter and 8.. But this ensuing is
especially commended in the deformity: to wit, that the eyebrowes be rubbed
until they be red, and then are Leaches to be set upon it: and when as they be
fallen off then have this salve following prepared: Take fresh Venus hair, and
Laudanum, of each a like quantity, sees the same in oil of Bayberries, and a
little wine, afterward wring them out, and therewith anoint the eyebrowes,
and all other infected places.

If so be that there ever appear any new matter, or any new impostume, then
must one begin to bath with the last foresaid decoction, and in like manner
also to anoint with the foresaid things, for that in such lingering sicknesses,
must the remedies so oftentimes be reiterated as the diseases make return.

For to strengthen the Heart, the Liver, and the Brains in the Leprosy.. 10.
BEcause that by the foresaid parts and other more this Leprosy takes her
beginning, therefore are the same to be strengthened: for which this following
is very good: to wit, the confection Laetificans Almansoris, whereof give every
day (half an hour before noone) one quarter of an ounce with Endive water,
the water of water Lillies, or with water of Agrimonie.

Secondly, the great Treacle is very forcible, for it strengthens the natural
heat and the vital spirits, that it may the more mightier withstand all
venime, if one take half a dragme thereof with any distilled water.

Item, take the confection Diambra, Diamoschu, and Manus Christie with Pearls,
likewise half a dragme of Lignum Aloes, tempered with two ounces of water of
water Lillies, and drunk in the evening when one goes to bed.

There is also highly commended to take oftentimes one scruple of Pearls with
one ounce of Basil water.

What concerns the skin.. 11.
WHen as the sking through great unnatural heat is annoyed and hurt, which
may be perceived by the corroding and by the sharp matter, then is the same
place to be anointed with the juice of Lettice, of Purslaine, of water
Lillies, and also with unripe Sallad oil: but if it be caused through cold,
that thereby the unnatural heat be extinguished, then is there no better
thing than to bath the place with strong red wine warmed. But if the disease of
the skin do not import any thing, then is it better that it be bathed with a
mild Lie, with Nepe, or garden Mints, and if this corroding do increase, then
use this precious salve ensuing: Take litharge of Gold and Ceruse, of each two
ounces, oil of Roses two ounces and a half, the juice of Rue four ounces,
Starch as much as suffiseth, then stir it the space of certain hours in a
leaden mortar, at last temper one quarter of an ounce of small bruised Camfere
amongst it.

Of the actual and potentiall cauterie.. 12.
THese actual and potentiall cauteries are both of them commended by the
Physicians in the extremest need, to wit, upon the head, and in the neck,
and in more other places, but because it may not be effected without danger of
some other parts (like as also they themselves do acknowledge) therefore we
will not write any ampler thereof at this present.

If any one be so hardly assailed of the Leprosy, that he be no otherwise to
be helped but by cauterization, he may take ye advice of those men that have
experience in it. And because that all which we have hitherto written is more
meet for the Elephantiasis, (like as we have declared at first)
notwithstanding it is also good for all species of the Leprosy, therefore
follows hereafter all that which is commodious for all species of this
sickness.

What is requisite for every sort of Leprosy.. 13.
FOr this, has Treacle the highest commendation; in like sort the confection
of Hiera and Hedgehogs flesh (whereof we have admonished before) whether it be
roasted, fried, or sodden. Also the flesh of the venomous Snake Tyrus is
commended by Galen and of other famous Physicians more. But because that we (God
be praised) have not this Snake here in this Realm, it is not needful for to
write much thereof, but to speak rather of those things that are to be gotten
in this country, and may do ease, as the powder of burnt Hares one dragme and
a half, with four ounces of wine drunk three days together. Take in like
manner as much powder of Squils, or the juice of the same, with the sirupe of
Squils, and then temper half a dragme more or less of Assa foetida, with
Honey amongst it, and so take it. Item, take powned Comin five dragmes, with
clarified Honey.

There may also be more written, yea a whole book full of the Leprosy, and
how that every accident of the same is at the beginning to be eased; but if so
be that the foresaid remedies will help the sick person, then be the
accidents the easier to be helped: for which we have also in many places
written much of the foresaid diseases, which altogether may and ought to be
used for this, and therewith we will conclude.

Of the bad ulcer Cacoete.. 14.
FOr a conclusion of these corrodings, impostumes and ulcers, we will also
briefly write of those which the Grecians do call Cacoete, which is a species
of the Canker, and so venomous, that it continues with a body all his life
time: for notwithstanding all the counsel which may be done for it, yet is it
all in vain, and it does remain incurable, and moreover (like as is said) is
very long continuing: yet do some commend this ensuing for some especial thing.

Take Soldanella half a dragme, powdered Rubarbe two scruples, give the same to
drink oftentimes with white wine: when this is taken, then give to the patient
the next day afterward the sirupe of Woormwood and of Cicorie, with Rubarbe, of
each one ounce: and so continue every other day. Afterward anoint the place
of the disease with oil of Roses, or oil of sweet Almonds.

The fifth Chapter. Of outward infections and woundings of the Skin.
IN the beginning of this fifth Part we have before declared many things whereby
the skin is infected and annoyed within. Now does our method require, that
we should write somewhat of the outward accidents of the skin, which be
hurtful to the same, and also to the flesh underneath it, and we will also
begin with the least, which is of burning or scalding.

Of burning or scalding with fire, hot water, and of burning with Gunpowder.. 1.
IF there be any burnt with fire or scalded with hot water, then have the
things or medicines whereby both these are to be cooled and healed, small
difference: but concerning the burning with Gunpowder, of that we will write
after another manner.

Of the burning of fire, or scalding with hot water, there comes at the first
an excessive pain, and diverse blisters whereout water does run.

Secondly, if one will heal these sores, then is there first to be spread
thereon a pap of the powder of Saunders, with Rosewater, and tempered with a
little Camfere, or with the water of Nightshade.

Or temper fine Bolus with vinegar, with Rosewater, and with water of
Nightshade: these things are to be laid upon it so long, until the pain be
almost gone. For this may also be used the salve of Poplar, mixed with the
white of an egg. And if so be that the blisters do not break of themselves,
then are they to be opened with a needle, to the end that the flesh next
underneath be not harmed thereby.

This is now a necessary and common manner of doing, viz. at the first: but
what is meet to have more done in it, that shall hereafter follow.

And because that such kind of diseases may be rather healed with salues than
otherwhise, therefore will we first of all begin with them.

These things following are to be used immediately after the burning, and until
the pain be at the extremest: Take oil of Roses and unripe Sallad oil, of
each three ounces, white Wax, washed Litharge of gold, and Ceruse, of each one
ounce, Starch three quarters of an ounce; melt the oil and the Wax together,
and then power it hot upon cold water: afterward wash it three times, and
that with Nightshade water: at last temper the other things amongst it. But if
you will have it more drying, then may you mix powned Cipers nuts amongst it,
as many as you please.

Item, take Butter, or Swines grease, eight ounces; let it be hot, and power
it upon cold water: afterward let it be stiff again, and then put it into a
dish: stir it well about, and power of the water unto it until it be through
white: at last stir one ounce and a half of Peter oil in it, and therewith
anoint the burning.

But if so be that the burning be two or three days old, then take of the
foresaid salve, and spread it upon linen as a plaster, and lay it six or
seven times a day upon it, according to the importance of the burning, for that
how much the oftener it is refreshed, so much the better and sooner is the same
also to be healed. If so be that the burning be great and deep, the^ do not
bind it tight, to the end the heat may pass out the better.

Item, Take Butter wherein an egg is baked and burnt, power it upon cold
water: when it is stiff, then wash the same eight times with cold water, and
at the last twice with vinegar: now take two ounces and a half of this Butter,
put thereto the whites of two eggs well brayed, Linseede oil half an ounce, then
anoint it on the burning.

Commonly the oil of Roses is good for burning, being tempered with salt,
Linseede oil, Ink, and Oxycraton.

Item, take oil of Roses one ounce, three yolks of eggs, mix them well
together: you may also add four or five grains of Saffron unto it.

Another. Take oil of Roses three ounces, Bolus one dragme, make it very
hot: afterward dip a cloth in it, and lay it thereon as hot as the patient
can abide it. But if the pain be abating, then is there a salve to be chosen
of this Lyme ensuing: Take vnslect Lime, power water upon it, but thrust not
the hand into it, but stir it well about with a spoone until that it scum:
afterward strike it off with a feather, and temper it with Sallad oil: at
last anoint it in the burning: the same is very highly commended. Or take
vnslect Lyme, and with Sallad oil make a salve of it as thick as pap, and
anoint therewith.

Item, Take oil of Roses two ounces, unripe Sallad oil one ounce and a half,
white Wax half an ounce, let it sees a little all together: afterward power
it on cold water, and wash it therewith. This being done, temper small bruised
Ceruse amongst it three quarters of an ounce, Frankincense and Sarcocolla, of
each one dragme, prepared Lyme half an ounce, Saffron half a scruple, washed
litharge of gold three quarters of an ounce, then temper them all together.
This following is a well approved salve for burning: Take quick lyme which is
slaked with good wine, let the lyme dry well, and put in as much Linseede oil
until it be as it were a dough: afterward anoint the burning with it, and
then lay none other upon it.

But if so be that it wax dry and hard, then spread more upon it and take it
not off, for that the burning will be suddenly whole, and when it is healed,
then falls it away of it self. This is thus by some to be assured:
nevertheless it is perilous not to look to it in long time, for that there
might some other thing stick unto it.

For this is also fit, the oil of Saint John's wort alone or tempered with
washed lyme, and so spread upon the burning, for it cools marvelous much.
Item, take oil of Roses three ounces, white Frankincense one ounce, Ceruse
three ounces, the whites of three Eggs, Camfer one dragme, make thereof a salve.

Another. Take oil of Olives four ounces, powned frankincense half an ounce,
the innermost rinds of Elderne one quarter of an ounce: sees them all together
with a little Vinegar, until that the Vinegar be thoroughly wasted, then
strain it through a cloth and use it as before.

Item: Take old candle tallow, Goats suet, and Linseed oil, of each a like
quantity: let them melt together, and put thereto the white of Hens dung, as
much of the one as of the other things: let it sees well together, and then
strain it through a cloth, afterward lay it upon the burnt place, and let it
lie thereon a day or twain: then wash it off with lukewarm water, and lay
again a fresh plaster upon it.

For this is also good all the white salues which are described in the fourth
part, the ninth chapter, and first. Item, yet another salve which is to be
found in the first part, the seventh chapter, and 17.. This salve following is
also very good for all sorts of burning: Take oil of Roses two ounces, the
yolks of six Eggs stamped well together, and temper some Saffron amongst it,
afterward spread it on a cloth and lay it upon the burning: it heals very
speedily.

Another. Sees Mustardseede in the cream of milk, then powne it to pappe and
wring it through a cloth, afterward anoint therewith the burning. After the
same manner is Linseede also to be sodden, strained and used. Or take Oaten
meal, boil it in Cream, and use it as the rest: this is especial good for
scalding with hot water.

Item, take the juice of Rapes or of Onions, each apart, or mixed together, and
anoint the burning oftentimes with it, and lay the leaves of the Cherry tree
upon it.

Take the juice of an Onion, and oil of the kernels of Abricockes half an
ounce, temper them together. The sirupe of Oxycraton does cool much the
burning. Ink tempered with the water of Carduus Benedictus is much commended
for this, if one make a cloth wet therein and lay upon it.

Item, the leaves of Waterlillies laid upon the burning do cool and also
heal. Of the inflammation and heat of the ulcers which is caused within, you
have heard before in the second chapter and sixth.

Of burning with Gunne-powder.. 2.
IF any have a shotten pellet cut out of his body, then is this oil following
to be laid upon it: Take oil of Elderne flowers twelve ounces, oil of Saint
John's wort one ounce, Turpentine half an ounce; temper these together, and set
them certain days in the sun: this has a marvelous efficacy and virtue.

Another. Take oil of Roses, Nightshade water, Rose water, water of Lillies,
and oil of Saint John's wort, of each a like quantity, and wash therewith the
wound oftentimes. Item, for to cool the inflammation, take the water of
Nightshade and of Saint John's wort, of each eight ounces, Allume half an
ounce, Ceruse, Litharge of silver, and Verdigrease, of each one dragme, powne
them all small together, and temper them well together, and then lay it as
warm upon it as may be suffered three or four times together.

Or take Linseede oil, vnsleckt lime, fine Bolus, and Rye meal, of each like
quantity, stir them well together, and then spread it on the burning: it
draws out the heat and the powder.

Item, take good honey eight ounces, let it sees and be well scummed, then put
thereto half as much sharp vinegar of Roses, and sees it all together until
it be brown: afterward put a spoonefull of beaten Allume unto it, and keep
it well; for the elder it is, so much the better it is.

There is also prepared for this two kinds of ley; the one which is made of
quick lime, and laid upon it with a wet cloth; the other is, if one temper
strong ley with Sallad oil, and lay it thereon: this ley is very good for all
heat, whether it be through burning with gunpowder, or otherwise for all
inflammation which does appear outwardly.

For all scalles of burning.. 3.
TAke Ceruse one ounce and a half, Camfer half a dragme, Rose water three
quarters of an ounce, Starch half an ounce; bruise it, and temper it well
together in a mortar with the white of an egg unto a thin salve; spread it
thereon and round about the scalles, and they will dry and fall off.

Before in the third Chapter and tenth. you have yet more other fit remedies for
it.

The sixth Chapter. For to draw Splinters and Thorns out of the skin.
IF that any Splinter or Thorn do stick in the skin, then must one look to
pull out the same immediately: otherwise it must ranckle out with great pain.

Thus for to remedy this: Take Ox suet, Wax and Rosin, of each a like
quantity, Pirola, Beetes, Louage, Ladymantle, and Sanicle, according to the
quantity of the former: powne them together, and wring out the juice:
afterward put it amongst the molten Wax, Rosin, and suet, and then boil it
until all the juice be wasted, and there become a salve of it.

Another. Take two parts of Sallad oil, and one part of Rosin, or Turpentine,
and as much Wax, let it melt together, and stir it well until it be cold.

For this is also good, the plaster Apostolicon and Gratia Dei, that are
described before.

Item, the juice of Barberies tempered with Barley meal, is also good for it.
Sief de Thure draws out the arrows, like as before is showed.

The roots of Beetes, of Polipodie, decocted with their leaves and laid
thereon, draw also much.

If so be that any body in spinning get a shiue in their finger, then take
picked Plantaine leaves, wring out the juice, and lay it upon it, it will
quickly draw out the shiue that sticks in the hand, and heal it.

The seventh Chapter. Of wounds and all that concerns them.
AMongst all outward accidents which harm the skin and the parts adjacent, are
the wounds also to be accounted: for which you have before (in the common
description of ulcers) certain rules which be also necessary for all wounds,
and may be applied unto them: therefore they are to be added here.

In all wounds (whereof soever they be caused, whether it be of pricking,
cutting, shooting, or falling) the Chirurgian must first look that he cause
the blood to be stanched: but if that be not performed, then does the patients
strength and power wear away, and at last his life also. Therefore will we
first of all write and discourse thereof.

For to stanch blood.. 1.
TAke Gum of Arabia, and Dragagant, of each one dragme, red Coral, Bloudstone,
burnt Iuorie and Camfere, of each half a dragme, make this powder with water
of Plantaine unto a dough, and lay it upon the wounds. Some do also temper it
with Bolearmoniack and Momy, which is not amiss.

Item, take Frankincense, Masticke, and small cut Hares hair, of each a like
quantity; make a soft salve thereof with the white of an Egg, and lay it upon
the bleeding.

Or take Dragon blood, vnsleckt Lyme and Frankincense, of each a like
quantity: this are you to use if there be any great vein perished: but if the
great veins be hurt the long way, then use burnt Coperas with it.

Item, Take the white of an Egg, fine Bolus, Dragon blood, Bloudstone, and
Frankincense, of each a like quantity; make a plaster of it, and then spread
it upon Tow, and so lay it upon the wound.

Or stamp Peach kernels, and make a plaster of it with the white of an egg.

Item take yellow Rose seed, powne it to powder, and temper Vinegar therewith
unto a pap, and so lay it upon the bleeding wound, it will stop it.

Resolve Coperas in Vinegar, and set it certain days in the hot sun, or
let it sees, afterward wet a cloth therein, and so lay it upon it.

The parings of Parchment boiled to Lime, and laid upon it, are also very
forcible for to staunch blood. Burn a hat to ashes and strew it into the wound.

Dried swines dung powned to powder, does also staunch blood. Item take
Egshels, and lay it so long in strong Vinegar to steep, until that they be
very soft, and then let them be hard again: afterward powne them small, and
use them as the other.

Man's hair also burnt, and beaten to powder, stauncheth much the bleeding at
the nose, and all other manner of bleeding.

The juice of Shepherds purse stauncheth and cools all hot blood. In May
are you to take Comfrey with the leaves, and shred it small; this being done,
distill it like other water, and drop in the wound.

The same do the Chirurgians ascribe to Maiden milk, which is in the first
part, the fifth chapter and 1.. described.

Item, for to staunch the blood at the nose, hold upon the forehead a cold
flint stone, blood stone, Calcedonie or Carnoyle stones, or put in his hand the
roots of Corn roses: a man is to hang his priuities in strong vinegar, or a
cloth wet therein and laid thereon, the bleeding will cease immediately.

For to staunch the blood you may also look into these places following, as of
the bleeding of the Ears in the first part, the 9. chapter, and 4.. of the
bleeding of the gums, in the first part, the 17. chapter, and 7.. Item, of
spetting of blood, in the second part, 5. Chapter and 11.. to staunch the
bleeding of the Hemorrhoides, in the third part, the 9. chapter, and 4.. of
pissing blood, in the third part, the 16. chapter, and 11.. and of women's
terms in the 3. part, the 19. chapter, and 3..

Of the clotted blood in the body.. 2.
IF so be that a wounded man, or one that has taken a fall, happened to bleed
inward, then are all means to be sought to expel the same with all speed:
for otherwise it must inwardly corrupt and putrify, whereby very perilous
agues and other deadly diseases might engender, whereof in the second part, the
fifth chapter, and 17.. (of the spetting blood) is sufficiently written. The
common people do advise, that in this disease one is to drink his own urine,
whereby the clotted blood should be expelled. The same does also the wine of
Hearts tongue, and all other vulnerall potions which hereafter shall be described.

This plaster following is much commended: Take Goats milk and Honey, as
much as you please, let it be very warm together, and stir fine Bolus therein
until it be a salve, and bind that upon it, whereby the congealed and clotted
blood will be expelled.

Of the stitching of wounds.. 3.
THis stitching of the wounds is committed to the Chirurgians charge, according
to the importance of the cause: but I will only add this unto it, and speak
of those things that do heal the wounds together without stitching: Take
Masticke and Dragonbloud, of each one quarter of an ounce, Frankincense one
drag. Mill dust and Bean meal, of each one ounce and a half; make them all
to powder, and temper them with the brayed whites of Eggs and Rose water, unto a
pap. Afterward spread it upon two long clouts which be somewhat strong, and
that are as long as the wound is, and lay one upon each side of the wound, upon
the whole flesh: this being dry, then few the wound so close together, as you
please, the needle not going thorough the skin, but thorough the clouts only.

The golden salve (is also much commended) called Vnguentum Aureum Mesuae,
which is made thus: Take yellow Wax 3. ounc. Sallad oil 12. ounc. Turpentine
one ounce, Rofin and Colofonie of each one quarter of an ounce, Frankincense
and Mastick of each half an ounce, Saffro^ a drag. let the Wax, Turpentine, and
oil melt together, and afterward put the Rosen unto it: and when it begins
to be cold, then temper amongst it the Masticke, Frankincense, and Saffron:
this joins the wounds together, and heals them. In the first Part, the 7.
chap. and 10.. there have you a water described, beginning thus: Take Litharge
of silver, etc. which is very much renowned for this purpose. In like sort M.
Tristrams water, and other golden waters, with four kinds of Balmes which are
to be found in the last part.

Of fresh wounds.. 4.
THese forementioned things be verily the chiefest, which may be used without
any delay for all fresh wounds. When as now the blood is staunched, and all
finished that is needful to be done, then are these things ensuing commended
highly: First, M. Tristrams water is thought meet to heal all fresh wounds,
which may also be done with all golden waters, whether it be that one take them
inward, or lay them outwardly upon them. The oil of Tyles should not only
heal, but also preserve the wounds from all putrified flesh; this is also
ascribed to the oil of Linen. The oil of S. John's wort is also much
commended, and the oil of Roses; for that they have an astringent virtue and
efficacy. Likewise the oil of Spike, and oil of Lead. It is also straightly
commanded, that all new wounds shall be washed with Wormwood or with
Rosemarie: for that both these keep the fresh wounds clean, and fair from all
putrefaction, and are also healing.

But if any one be but a little wounded, so that it be not needful to go to a
Chirurgian with it, then use this salve following: Take Turpentine which is
three times washed in wine, and stir the yolke of an egg amongst it, Barley
meal one quarter of an ounce, Saffron 5. grains; temper them together: This
salve is good for all pain, although it be also in a finewie part: it makes
flesh speedily to grow. It is also not unlike to Vnguento Mundificatiuo. This
plaster following will heal the wound in 20. days, without matter and
without pain: Take Wax half an ounce, white Coral 3. drag. Colofonia and
Momy, of each 7. drag Myrrh 2. drag. Camfere, Loadstone, of each half a drag.
oil of Eggs as much as is needful for to mix amongst all the rest. This salve
is thus to be used, if any one be cut or thrust, and if this plaster be laid
upon it within ^4. hours, then shall the wound within 20. days without any
corruption or any other addition be healed. If so be that then it be a thrust
that goes quite thorough, then is one to have 4. plasters in a readiness, and
to lay 2. upon it before noone, and 2. at after noone, without putting any
thing else unto it. But if so be that it be but a wound, then are two enough:
to the end that there remain no clotted blood within, is this powder following
to be given to the patient; take Mommy one quarter of an ounce, fine Bolus and
Dragon blood, of each one dragm, give thereof to the patient evening and
morning, the quantity of an Hasell nut.

Many kinds of vulnerall potions.. 5.
EVery Chirurgian will show his cunning in this; for each one has a several
potion which he keeps as a secretum secretorum. Also it is indeed of great
importance, when as the inward parts be perished, or if there be any blood
inwardly congealed, it can in no better way be helped than by this means:
wherefore we have here rehearsed certain of these vulneral potions, whereof
the Chirurgians do much esteem. Take wild Beets (which is Pirola) with their
roots one M. Consolida saracenica, the roots 2. M. Mugwoort without r^^ts 4.
M. and power thereto one quart of wine in a new leaded pot: then stop it tight,
to the and there fly no vapor out: afterward let it sees together by a small
fire, until about the third part be consumed, drink thereof morning and
evening, according as the disease is great, and according as the body is hot or
cold, take strong or small wine. But in winter when ye herbs be dry, then take
one ounce of Mugwoort, Consolida saracenica half an ounce, wild Beets 2. drag.
and sees it as before in a quart of wine: this is an approved potion for all
ulcers, wounds, and all other diseases, being used inwardly, and also
outwardly. This plaster following is also to be used with it: Take clarified
Honey 8. ounces, wheat flower 2. ounces, Linseed oil three ounces, fine Bolus
one ounce and a half, then make thereof a plaster, and lay it thereon. Item,
take Consolida saracenica with yellow flowers, Mugwoort, wild Beetes, and
Ladimantle, of each one M. ^^^h all together in a quart of wine, whether it be
Malmsey, or any other good wine. This potion has been approved oftentimes, and
was found very good.

Another: Take wild Beetes, wild Tansie, Sanicle, and Agrimonie, being all
gathered at a full Moon, dried in the air, and then stamped to powder: when
as you will use thereof, then take an earthen pot which will hold a quart of
moisture, and put therein of this foresaid powder, as much as you can gripe at
two or three times between your two fingers, and according as the wound
requires: afterward power unto it a pint of wine, and cover the pot very
tight with a slice of bread, then let it stand the space of a good hour in a
warm place until it be cold, and give thereof to the wounded person twice a
day. You may also strew of this powder in the wounds. Yet another: Take
Consolida saracenica, Agrimonie, wild Tansie, Mugwoort, Cicorie, Southernwood,
and wild Beetes, of each a like quantity, dry the herbs in ye shadow and
then stamp them to powder: afterward take a quart of wine, and put thereto an
ounce of this powder, then sees it in hot water, until the breadth of three
or four fingers be consumed: afterward put thereto a spoonefull of Asarabacca
powned small, and give thereof to the patient when he goes to bed three or
four ounces at one time. Another: Take Sanicle, Auence, Agrimonie, Buglosse,
Verueine, Cicorie flowers, Consolida saracenica, Betonie, Hysop, Sage,
Mugwoort, wild Tansie, wild Beetes, and S. John's wort, of each a like
quantity: sees them all together in wine, and give the patient thereof twice
a day, at each time three or four spoonefuls. Item, take Consolida saracenica,
Agrimonie, Sanicle, wild Tansie, Plantaine, and Beetes, of each a like
quantity, let it sees together in wine, and give thereof warm. Diverse such
like potions are described in the third part, the third Chapter of the
fractures of bones.

Of the Plasters for thrusts and wounds.. 6.
FIrst, to write of the Plasters for thrusts, there be many kinds prepared for
it, as hereafter follows: Take Wax one ounce and a half, Colofonie and
Momie, of each two ounces, Frankincense one ounce, Camfere one ounce and a
quarter, bruise it small, and afterward melt the Wax and the Colofonie, temper
then the rest amongst it, and work it woll together, anointing the hands with
oil of Eggs. Another which is approved: Take Turpentine four ounces,
Colofonie and Rosin, of each two ounces, white Cadmia one ounce, Loadstone one
ounce, Frankincense two ounces, Masticke and Momie, of each half an ounce,
Juniper oil one quarter of an ounce, oil of Eggs, and Camfere, of each half
an ounce, dissolve the Gum in Wine or Vinegar, and strain it through a cloth
into a pan, afterward let it sees together, then put thereto the Cadmia and
Ceruse: when it has sodden well, then put the Loadstone unto it, and let it
wale once again: afterward add the Frankincense, Masticke, and the Mummie
unto it. This being done, let it sees a little more, and when it is waxen
lukewarm, then put the Camfere well bruised unto it, and then work it further
well together unto a plaster.

Item, take Wax, Rosin, Turpentine, oil of Eggs, and Sallad oil of each four
ounces, oil of Roses one ounce, sees it all together unto a plaster, and
then at last put unto it one dragme of Camfere: but if it be too hard, make it
softer with oil of Roses. Another: Take Wax and Colofonie, of each one ounce,
Momie one quarter of an ounce, Frankincense, Myrrh, and Masticke, of each half
an ounce, white Coral three dragmes, Loadstone one dragme, white Cadmia one
quarter of an ounce, Dragon blood one dragme, Camfere one ounce, make thereof a
plaster. For this, is also very good the plaster of Master Flackenstone,
which is described in the second Chapter, and the 1.. Item, take Wax two
ounces, Turpentine, and Gummi Holeni, of each one ounce, Dragon blood, and
Hartwoort, of each half an ounce, Gummi Ammoniacum one ounce, Ceruse one ounce
and a half, Frankincense, Momie, Masticke, and Juniper berries, of each one
ounce, Allume one ounce and a half, make a plaster thereof.

Another: Take Wax four ounces, Momy, Colofonie, Masticke, and Frankincense
of each one quarter of an ounce, white Coral three dragmes, Camfere half an
ounce, oil of Eggs one ounce, melt the oil with the wax upon a mild fire, and
then let it be somewhat cold, afterward temper all the other things (beaten
very small) amongst it. This being done, let it sees softly, stirring it round
about, at last temper the Camfers with four spoonefuls of the oil of Juniper
amongst it.

Item, take oil of Roses and Wax, of each four ounces, Dear sewet two
ounces, Frankincense and Myrrh, of each half an ounce, Galbanum, Mastick, and
Turpentine, of each half an ounce, make a plaster of it. This ensuing is not
only good for wounds, but also for all ulcers: Take Turpentine and Wax, of
each four ounces, Mastick two ounces, Rose leaves 16. ounces, brown Betony,
the greater Pimpernell, spiked Plantaine, Nightshade, Devils bit, Verueine, and
Storkes bill, of each eight ounces, add a quart of wine unto it; sees first
therein the Roses alone: this being done, power it through a cloth, and wring
out the juice well: afterward take the other herbs, and put them also into a
kettle, with two quarts of Wine, afterward let them sees together even to the
half, then wring it well out, and let the decoction be very hot that the Wax
may melt in it, then put the Rose wine with the Mastick also unto it, then
sees it to a plaster, and work it very strongly with the hands, but you must
first anoint them with Butter, This foresaid plaster is not only good for
wounds, but also for all ulcers. Also you have in the first Chapter and 15..
many things which are also very meet for to cure the wounds. The Chirurgians
have yet a black plaster nivse, which is made thus: Take Frankincense half
an ounce, Momie half an ounce, Colofonie three quarters of an ounce, oil of
Eggs half an ounce, Camfere one dragme, white Wax three dragmes: melt the Wax
and the oil of Eggs with the powned Colofony, and then temper the other things
powned amongst it. If it be too hard, add a little Turpentine unto it. Item,
take clarified Honey eight ounces, fine meal two ounces, Linseede oil three
ounces, fine Bolus one ounce and a half, make a plaster thereof, and lay it
upon the wounds: for this also is requisite the plaster Gratia Dei.

Vulnerall Salues.. 7.
THere be also many kinds of vulnerall Salues prepared, Vnguentum Fuscum.
amongst which this ensuing is one of the principallest, which is called
Vnguentum Fuscum, and is made thus: Take oil of Violets nine ounces, Wax two
ounces, Colofonie one ounce, plume Allume three quarters of an ounce, Pitch,
Sagapenum, and Gummi Arabicum of each one ounce, Mastick, Galbanum, Ammoniacum,
Bdellium, Opopanacum, Frankincense and Turpentine, of each three quarters of an
ounce, the oil of Violets and Wax are you to melt, and to let it sees
thoroughly: afterward temper the Pitch and the Colofonie with the dissolved
gums amongst it, and when it begins to be cold, then mix the rest with it.
This salve is somewhat attractiue, cleansing, and also hea^ing.

This ensuing is said to heal all wounds: Take Turpentine three ounces, Wax
seven dragmes, oil of Cammomill, and oil of Roses, of each one ounce and
quarter, Frankincense and Mastick, of each one ounce, Myrrh and Rosin, of each
half an ounce, good red wine and vinegar, of each three quarters of an ounce:
let the gum be steeped the space of 24. hours in the vinegar and wine,
afterward melt it upon the fire with the wax and oil, then let them sees
until the wine be almost all wasted, when it begins to be cold, then temper
the rest amongst it, and work this salve with your hands, yet the same being
first anointed with oil of Mastick. This salve cleanses all wounds, it
causes the flesh to grow, and heals also very much. Another, which is also
very good: Take Louage, Bistorta, Sage, Plantaine, Yarrow, Elecampane leaves,
wild Tansie, Sanicle, Cinquefoile, wild Beets, Mallows, Betonie, Agrimony,
Verueine, and Consolida saracenica, of each a like quantity: shred all these
herbs, and then put sufficient sweet Butter unto it; afterward stamp all
these herbs together, and let them so stand certain days. This being done,
make it afterward warm, and press it out hard, and then let it sees so long
together until the juice of all the herbs be consumed, then put unto it Ox
^et, Hearts suet, Buckes suet, the marrow of an Ox, Wax, Rosin, and
Turpentine, of each a like quantity, according to the quantity of the Butter,
and afterward melt them all together: when it begins to be cold, then put
unto it Frankincense, Myrrh, Fenegreeke meal, Allume, Verdigrease, and
Masticke being beaten small all together, then stir it much together. Another
which is briefer: Take Ox suet, Hearts suet, Wax, Turpentine, Honey, Lo^age,
Violets, Betony, Agrimonie, and wild Tansie, of each as much as you please,
stamp the herbs, and wring out the juice, afterward sees it in the suets
until it be as thick as a salve. Item, take Rue, Sulphur, Chamaeleon niger, of
each a like quantity, and Ox suet, as much as will suffice for to make a
salve.

For to draw matter out of the wounds.. 8.
TAke Wax one ounce and a half, Rosin three quarters of an ounce, Hearts suet
one ounce, Turpentine and Sallad oil, as much as is needful for to make a
salve or plaster: or take clarified Honey, and Turpentine washed with wine, of
each half an ounce, oil of Roses two ounces, let it sees together until it
be thick. This cleanses the wounds of all kind of matter, and withstandeth
all affluxions. But if there be any heat with, then take in stead of common
Honey, Honey of Roses, but temper not the same with it until the other be first
boiled.

Of the Taints.. 9.
IF you think that the wounds will heal too soon, then cut a dry root of
Gentian for a taint as big as you please, and use the same in stead of a taint:
for when the same waxes moist, then does it swell, and holds open the wounds
as long as you please, and it is very wholesome of it self. Anoint also the
taint with the salve Apostolorum, or Aegyptiacum, which be both very meet to
keep open all wounds and ulcers, and also to cleanse them.

For foul flesh.. 10.
NOw these two be contrary: of the first mentioned salve the plaster Gratia
Dei lets no foul flesh grow in the wound; so also does the oil of Tyles.

Item, take burnt Allume, and fine Bolus, of each a like quantity, and strew
it therein.

Or take Verdigrease, and Trociskes de Chelidonia, of each a like quantity;
make a powder thereof and strew it therein. For this is also very meet, burnt
Hearts bones two parts, Salt one part, and use them as before. Take the juice of
Narcissus, of Plantaine, and garden Mints, and the juice of Rue: all these
juices or those that you can get may you take and use. Item, burn Birchen
rinds to powder, and temper it with burnt Allume, or use each alone. If so be
that then there grow any worms in the wounds, then temper the juice of Rue
with Vinegar and drop it therein.

To staunch the Synouia... 11.
TAke the white of an Egg and put a little Saffron amongst, afterward beat
them well together with a piece of powned Allume the bigness of a Hasell nut,
and lay it upon the place whence the Synouia issues.

Another: Take the white of an Egg, and mingle therewith Allume, and Salt, of
each one dragme beaten small, and then use it as the other.

Item, burn Lentils to powder and strew it therein: afterward take Turpentine
and Sallad oil, let them heat together, and then mix therein the burnt
Lentils unto a salve or plaster: or take Hempseede, powne it until it yield
oil, afterward lay it in a fine cloth over the disease and bind it unto it.
Item: take the water of the greater Pimpernell and drop it therein. Item: take
Strawberrie leaves, and apply them unto the place. Or take the fruit of Roses,
dry them, stamp them to powder and strew it therein.

When a wounded member is lamed.. 12.
FOr this do the Chirurgians use this ensuing: Take Cow dung and Goats dung,
make a plaster of it with the oil of Earthwormes, and so lay it warm unto
it: by this means do the shrunken sinews wax loose. But look in the fourth
part the seventh chap. and 2.. what is written of the lamenesse and extenuation
of the members. The like also in the 3. chap. of the Pocks where you shall find
good direction of this matter.

To cause the flesh to grow in wounds.. 13.
THe Grecians and the Physicians do call the things which cause the flesh to
grow Sarcotica, which be for the most part dry in the first degree: for if
they be overmuch drying, then will they not only dry the humors which do fall
into the wounds, but the blood also, and the whole substance of the part. This
salve following is very requisite for it: Take Honey six ounces sees and skum
the same until it be a little thick; afterward temper therein Myrrh,
Sarcocolla, and Aloe, of each one dragme and a half, powned all together to
powder. Item, take the Lytharge of silver, refuse of Iron, Centorie, Aloe,
Frankincense, and Masticke, of each a like quantity, make a subtle powder of
it. For this is also meet the plaster Album coctum, Triapharmacon, and
Apostolicon, which all together engender flesh, and are prescribed for the same
intent. For this also be these plasters following to be used, viz. Emplastrum
griseum, or de lapide Calaminari, which is thus made: Take prepared Calaminari
half an ounce, Lytharge of gold one ounce Ceruse one quarter of an ounce, Tuty
half a dragm, Masticke one dragme and a half, Myrrh one dragme, Camfer two
scruples, make thereof a plaster; if it be too hard, put more Turpentine unto
it: this plaster dries, causes flesh to grow, heals and cicatriseth all
wounds. The other: Take prepared Calaminari four ounces, Masticke,
Frankincense, and Dragagant, of each one dragme, the Lytharge of silver half
an ounce, Wax three quarters of an ounce, Rosin half an ounce, prepared Tuty
two scruples, and oil of Roses, as much as is needful, this is somewhat
weaker than the other. The salve of Tuty, Diapampholigos, is very meet for
this use, so is also the salve Apostolorum.

Of that which causes the Skin to grow.. 14.
AT last if you perceive that the flesh is grown so high, that there wants
only cicatrisation, then are things to be used which have an astringent virtue,
and which do dry exceedingly without corrosion. For which be most fit all the
salues of lime which be described in the fifth Chapter, and first. In like
manner also the five white salues which be discovered in the ninth Chapter, and
first. and the last mentioned Diapampholigos. This powder following is
exceeding good for it: Take Lytharge of silver, burnt Allume, washed Lyme,
burnt Lead, Gals, and Pomgranate peeles, of each a like quantity, strew it
upon the wound: for this also it is very fit that the wounds be washed with
Wormwood wine, or Rosemarie wine. Concerning the wounds of the head we have
written somewhat in the description of the skull in the first part, the fourth
chapter, and 1..

The eight Chapter. Of the Cicatrices and spots of the Skin.
WHen there has been any body wounded, or has had some other exulceration
healed, then will there remain on the same place some cicatrice or mark. For as
has been admonished at the first the skin does never more heal of it self,
but there must grow a new skin. Also it happens otherwhiles that newborn
children do bring spots into the world. And because that the same are placed in
the face they do make a great deformity: therefore we will also discourse of
them.

Amongst the Grecians be those spots that be white called Leuce, and by the
Latinists Vitiligines, which be white spots of the body. Item, there be also
black spots of the Leprosy. Of the spots which appear in the face we have
written in the first part, the fifth Chapter, and first. which remedies may also
be used over the whole body. But because there be so many kind of sorts we are
to write the more at large of them.

Of the moles or marks that children are borne withal.. 1.
IT happens also many times, that newborn children do bring with them into the
world certain spots or moles, which are caused by some frighting, strange
lusts, and such like, which women (being with Child) may get, as by experience
has oftentimes been seen. Chew in the morning fasting Mustard seed, and
anoint therewith the spots, do this oftentimes, then will the spots wear
away: but look diligently unto it, that it come not into the child's eyes: also
breath not into his eyes.

There come also otherwhiles certain marks and other red spots on the skin,
for which, the Basilica is first to be opened, and afterward some cooling
sirupes, and other cooling potions, but we will write and discourse severally
thereof.

Of red spots through heat.. 2.
OF these spots we have before admonished in the first Chapter, and 4.. that
all that may be used for it which is ordained for the Rose, or Erisipelas. But
if so be that this be caused through some uncleanness of the blood (as it
commonly happens) and that notwithstanding there be no special heat instant,
then can no better thing be used for it than the sirupe of Fumitorie, and all that may be made of that herb; for that herb has an especial virtue to
cleanse the blood, and to take away all itch of the skin. Afterward are you to
use this salve following: Take vnsleckt lyme, and prepared Tuly, of each one
drag. oil of S. John's woort two ounces; and a little wax, temper them all
together. Or take Camfere, and bruise it with an Almond, then temper the same
with Rose water, and anoint the spots therewith. Take oil of Eggs as much as
you please, and temper amongst it a good part of bruised lytharge of silver,
then anoint therewith the spots this drives them away how loathsome soever
they be.

For this, is also very fit the oil of Juniper, and the oil of bitter
Almonds, and of each alike, or each apart. Also you may use for this maidens
milk, Lac virginis, which is described in the first part, the fifth Chapter,
and 1.. Item, take Hellebore two ounces, stamp it to pap, and put thereto as
much of the juice of Agrimonie, and a little Rosewater, then rub the spots
with it. Or take lytharge of silver, burnt Allume, burnt Lead, washed Lyme,
Gals, and Pomgranate blossoms, of each one dragme, and make a powder thereof.

Of spots which come by falls.. 3.
BEfore in the first Chapter and 6.. is a salve described, beginning thus: Take
the caules of Goats, etc. which is especial good for all spots, and very safe.

Of spots by stripes or falls.. 4.
FOr this, you have in the first part, the fifth Chapter and 5.. two good
remedies, without which, you may use these ensuing, which may be rather used
upon the whole body than in the face, because that Orpiment is somewhat
venomous: Take the juice of Marioram gentle two ounces, Orpiment half a
dragme, oil of Cammomill one ounce, make a salve thereof. Item, take Wormwood
three handfuls, Asarabacca, and Plantaine, of each two handfuls, Saltpeter, and
wild yellow Rape seed, of each one dragme, Comin, and Sulfur vife powned
small, of each three dragmes, Saffron one dragme, two well brayed yolks of Eggs
make a plaster of it with the juice of Solidago media, until it be decocted
hard enough. But if the foresaid spots be without heat, then are to be used
for it all kinds of fat of beasts, and of all fowls, or the plaster Diachilon,
molten amongst it, and so used. Item, take fresh Butter, and the decoction of
Mallows: temper the gals of Capons with the white of an egg, and use it as
the other. In the fourth part, the seventh Chapter, and 3.. is a salve
beginning thus: Take Sage, and Mallows, etc. which is also very good for all
kind of spots.

These things following be also much commended; as the oil of bitter Almonds,
of Juniper, Citrons salve, the fatness of an Asses neck, and M. Tristrams
water.

And to conclude, we will describe a strong salve, which takes away all spots,
and softeneth all hard swellings, and does also consume the same. Take the
roots of wild Cucumbers, ye roots of white Behen, the Lytharge of gold, and
Argall of each one drag. and a half, Sagapenum, and Pigeon dung of each one
scrup. oil of Sesamum three ounces, oil of Juniper, and oil of wheat, of
each two ounces and a half, white Wax one ounce and a half, sees them
together in four ounces of the juice of Oranges, until that all the juice be
spent: take afterward the white of an Egg, small bruised Camfere one dragme,
Vinegar twelve ounces, wash the rest with it, after that all is well tempered
together: and afterward use this salve.

The ninth Chapter. Of inward things which spread themselves over all the body.
WE have taught before of all outward accidents, which outwardly do infect the
skin: but now will we write of those things and parts which are spread within
through ye whole body, which hold the same together, underprop it, and
sustain the body upright: these are the bones, veins, and arteries, with ye
blood that is in them, and all that concerns them; how the same is to be
cleansed, and when it runs overmuch, how it shall be stopped; how it shall
be letten out, and his natural heat cooled. There shall also be discoursed of
the sweat, as a superfluity of all humors. Afterward we shall discourse of
the sinews, of the tendons and ligaments. Item, of the flesh, and chiefly of
that which we do call the muscles. For as much as wearisomnesse, fatness,
leanness, sleep, pain, Phlegma, or slime, with many other cold diseases, as
well as the blood, Cholera and Melancholia, may be dispersed in the whole
body, and that the blood has no certain place in the body, as the Cholera
in the bladder of the gall, and Melancholia in the milt: (of which two has
been written in other places) therefore we must not pretermit to write of the
nature of Phlegma, and must first begin of the bones.

Of the bones.. 1.
THe bones of the whole body, be (as it were) the foundation and stay of the
body, and also the hardest parts which be in it. These are engendered of the
heat of the body, which dries the moisture, and hardens the bones. Plato
supposes that their beginning is of the marrow, which should be so dried away,
and hardened through heat: wherefore Empedocles does ascribe the most part of
them to Vulcano, that is, the fire. By nature they be dry, earthie, cold,
hard, without blood, and also without feeling. They do get their beginning of
the uppermost part of the back bone, which stretches it self even to the
thighs. They be also hard knit together, and bounden through the sinews and
ligaments, that there is not one amongst 248. (or as Albertus reckons,
amongst 276.) that are in man's body, the which is not fastened to another
bone. When these bones be broken, then do they not grow together again in
their own substance, but by a certain liquor, which the Grecians do call
Poros, the which hardens there so sore, that therewith the whole fracture
grows together again. But whenever that these bones do break, or get any
other disease, then ^^ke what we have written thereof in the fourth part, the
ninth chap. and 2..

Of Napta.. 2.
IT happens also sometimes that in certain places of the body such a matter
is gathered, that does so harden and grow out of some bone, that it seems to
be a right bone, which in Latin is called Napta, and although this ought to be
cured by chirurgerie, we will nevertheless ordain this for it: Take
Frankincense one ounce, Mastick five drag. Ceruse three quarters of an ounce,
quicksiluer half an ounce; temper them all together with four ounces of Swines
grease, and rub therewith the Napta, at the fire very hard, not regarding what
pain soever it does.

The tenth Chapter. Of three kinds of Veins in general.
THe Veins are described by Galen in this manner: The Veins (says he) are a
fat of the blood, tempered and mixed of blood and natural spirits, moist and
warm, with great sensibilitie. And under this name are comprehended three
sorts: to wit, blood veins (called by the Latinists Venae) Arteries and pulse
veins, Arteriae, or Venae pulsatiles, for that they beat continually.

Secondly, the nature of these veins is warm and moist: what difference there
is between both these sorts of veins, besides the beating, that shall appear
in this description following: the Anatomists do account 365. veins in a man's
body.

Thirdly, there be sinews, which be also comprehended under the name of veins,
which have no fellowship at all with ye blood veins, but only that they do lie
spread over all ye body, whereof in case that one lose her motion and feeling,
then will forthwith the whole body, or some part of it (according to the
quality of the disease) be without might, and deprived of all motion.

Of the blood veins.. 1.
NOw for to describe these three sorts of veins, we will first of all admonish
of the blood veins, which are called of the Physicians and Anatomists Quietae,
which are still veins, and that by reason they be naturally quiet and without
motion; for when they be moved, that is done by some outward cause.

Albertus and Aristoteles would maintain and defend against Galenus, that
these veins did take their offspring from the heart: But according to the opinion
of Galen and Hippocrates, have they their beginning in the Liver, which
question we will leave to the Anatomists to be decided. But we will show here
in brief what has moved Hippocrates to ascribe the beginning of these veins
unto the Liver, viz. for that in all creatures (which have blood) there is no
greater vein than the Liver vein, which appears none otherwise but as the
body of a tree, which is thickest beneath in the ground, and at his beginning,
and besides his root stretching forth wide and broad, and the branches above
do spread themselves again in many sprigs or twigs. And thus it is also with
the arteries, wherefore the foresaid authors have also affirmed, that the Liver
is none other thing but like to a root and fountain of all other veins, so
that she does impart her blood first of all to the heart, as to the most noble
part of the body. This is now sufficiently spoken in general of the blood
veins, whereof we will speak and discourse more at large hereafter.

Of the Arteries.. 2.
WHereof Galen writes thus: the Arteries are vessels of the thin and clean
blood, wherein are more natural spirits or air, more heat, drith, and
feeling, than in the blood veins, which remain always panting and beating.

They have their offspring of the left concauitie of ye heart, and the first
branch a little off from his root is parted in twain, whereof the one part
goes upwards, and the other downwards, where (in both places) the foresaid
bloudveines are spread abroad, with diverse small veins, so that there be few
arteries without veins. This altogether is most diligently described by
Aristotle, Galen, Albert, and also of Walter Rijf, and at last with lively
figures it is apparent to the eyes.

These arteries or pulse veins be by nature (as is said) much hotter, drier,
thicker, sensiblier, and harder, than the blood veins: Partly like unto the
nature of the sinews they also receive some blood, but it is subtiller and
fairer than the blood of the veins: they be also much more replenished with
vital spirits than the veins, which is also a cause of their continual
panting and moving, which happens so forcible, that the same is outwardly felt
over the whole body, and especially on the hands, feet, temples of the head,
and on other places me may be seen and felt. All Physicians may deem thereby,
whether the nature be strong or feeble, and all according as the pulse beats,
swift, slow, hard, soft, steddie, or very trembling.

The ancient Physicians have been of opinion, that both these sorts of veins,
and especially the arteries (if they be cut or chopped off) could not be
consolidated again, yea that the heart veins be utterly incurable. But
Galenus acknowledges verily that the same could hardly be effected in men that
be old, but in young people otherwise. Of women and young children does he
admonish that one should not be discouraged; for that he had (says he) healed
enough himself that were wounded after that manner. For this be also before
many good remedies in the second part, the fifth Chapter, and 18.. if a vein be
broken in the breast or any other place, which may also be used inwardly and
outwardly for this purpose.

In like manner you may also use for it this confection ensuing: Take Henbane
seed, and white Poppie seeds, of each one ounce and a quarter, Sealed earth,
and red Coral, of each five dragmes, old conserve of Roses, the older the
better, four ounces: temper all together, and take thereof in the morning and
evening each time half a dragme and no more: this is very good and also
forcible for all kinds of bleeding. When as now the veins do swell be it of
whatsoever cause it will, then anoint them with Treacle or Mithridate.

Of the Blood.. 3.
IT is sufficiently known that man's body is joined together of four kinds of
humors or complexions: to wit, of Blood, Cholera, Melancholia, and Phlegma; but
amongst these is the blood one of the best, partly, for that it is the matter
of the vital spirits, wherein life it self has his being, or for that it is
to be compared with the beginning of life, because it is by nature warm and
moist: or because it has more virtue to nourish and to sustain, than any of
the other humors.

In fine, it is such a Jewel of nature; that if the same be taken away, then
death does ensue.

Cholera and Melancholia have their proper places or residences in the body,
wherein they do gather themselves, as we have of late declared, from which
places they do also show their power in the ingendring of sicknesses.

But the blood and Phlegma are so divided into two parts of the body, that one
cannot so soon upon the skin in any place, but immediately the blood does issue
forth, and that the veins be ye vessels and habitation of the blood, has been
declared before; without the which there can also no blood be found, except in
the least concauitie of the heart. Wherefore Albertus has been of none other
opinion, but that the veins do begin there, and not in the liver.

The nature of the blood is hot and moist; yea so hot, that in the whole body
there is nothing ^otten and to the contrary nothing colder than the Phlegma.

Therefore this hot and moist blood is given to all living creatures, not
only for a nourishment of all members of the body, but also to maintain them
by their natural warmth, and no otherwise. For example good wood is laid upon
the fire for to warm a whole chamber with it; in like sort also, as the fire
is abated and his burning taken away, if the same be ouercharged with too much
wood, or if the wood be too moist: also if the wood be plucked away, or too
little laid upon it: so is it with the heat of the heart, that if the same be
too much, or too little: likewise ouer^old, unmeasurable hot, or is too feeble.
When the heart shall feel these kind of diseases, then will all other members
of the body be partakers thereof.

It is also the opinion and censure of all learned, that the blood is the most
principal means in the mothers body, whereby the heart as the chief part of
the body, has his beginning.

Concerning his nature and property, then is this not a small miracle of
nature, that it has ^n feeling of it self: nevertheless it is cause of the
same and of life also. And it is found by daily experience, that if there run
much blood from any creature, that thereby come swounings, yea ye life it self
runs out with the blood.

Neither is the blood alike in all men, nor in all members, it gets also
through age many kinds of nature. In children it is thin and waterish, in youth
hot and sharp, in men at the fullest and best of all, and in all these
aforesaid, very much and abundant.

In age there is but little, thick and black, and clotting very sodeinly as
well inwardly as outwardly upon the body.

In like manner it is also sure, that how fatter a body is, so much less blood
has he, for that it is through ye fatnes consumed, as is seen, that all fat
has no blood in it. Contrarily, how much the leaner, so much the blacker is
the blood. Besides these is also women's blood much grosser and blacker than
men's blood, and women have also less blood in ye outward than in ye inwards
parts.

Moreover, there is no creature fuller of blood amongst all them that have
received life, than women, wherefore nature does unburden them every month of
all the superfluities of the blood, and they are less subject than men unto
all sicknesses which proceed of blood.

Albeit it happens (yet seldom) that they bleed at the nose, or by the
Hemorrhoids, then do they quickly find, that they have their terms the less.

Secondly, the blood also in the Hearts, Lights, and arteries, is much subtiler
than that in the veins. The gross blood is drawn away by the flesh, whereby
the foresaid blood is more subtle; thin and scummy. The upright good blood,
which is without any disease, is light red, sweet in taste, and not too
thick, and in that estate it may be sustained and augmented by good meat and
drink, if one take abundantly thereof: but to the contrary, it will be
diminished through want of those things. The blood does especially increase by
good strong wine moderatly drunken, it makes the same also fair and fresh,
and especially the wine which is thick red, for that wine behooves not to be
much digested.

In fine, according to that the food is good or bad, thereafter is the blood
qualified: for the farther it is engendered from his proper nature, so much the
blacker it is. If the same spoil through abundance, then will in the broken
veins be knots called Varices, whereof we have written in the first chapter,
and seventeenth. of the fifth part: or it will be expelled through the bleeding
at the nose, or through the Hemorrhoids: also it is oftentimes altered in
impostumations and corruptions. What diseases are caused of the corruption of
the blood, that shall hereafter be taught and declared.

Amongst all living creatures is the blood of man the most subtle: as to the
contrary, the Asses blood the most gross. So long as it does remain in the
body, it does keep his warm and moist nature: but as soon as it is out,
then does it thicken: yet one man's blood more than another, whence afterward
you may separate the little hairs or Fibrae. The blood of a Steete is so hard,
that being drunken it is a deadly poison.

Contrariwise, certain beasts blood does not thicken at all, viz. Hares blood,
Conies blood, Hearts and Hinds blood, the blood of Roes, of Swine, of Goats,
and such like more. The Philosophers opinion is, that all gross thick blood
does give strength, subtle and thin blood wittiness, little blood fear,
and very little wit.

But for conclusion, this ensuing is a marvelous property of the blood, that
Nature has placed such power therein, that the countenance of a man is altered
in the twinkling of an eye, as happens in great anger, shamefastness and
such, through the concourse of blood.

Contrarily, if the same depart from the face, it shows fear and fright. And
in these alterations of palenesse and redness, does keep such a difference,
that thereby may be adjudged and known, how the heart and mind of man is
disposed within.

Whereby the blood may be cleansed.. 4.
ALbeit that we have taught enough for all sicknesses, which be caused through
the uncleanness of the blood, by what means the blood may be cleansed, yet
can it not but be necessary to discover certain things here which be meet for
the same. And first, what things they be: the confected Nutmegs are especially
commended for this, because they make very good and hail blood. Nevertheless
it is not advised, that they which be of hot nature should use the same
unless it be very seldom.

We have also declared in other places, that there is nothing that cleanses the
blood more than Fumitorie, and all that is made of Fumitorie, as conserve,
sirupe, juice, water, and especially if the same be decocted in the whay of
Goats milk.

Rosemary is also highly commended for it. In the first part, the second
Chapter, and first. is a powder described, beginning thus, Take Seen leaves,
which is also marvelous good for this purpose.

Concerning the drink, we have told before that there is nothing better than
good red wine.

Amongst herb-wines, the Burrage wine, wine of Buglosse and of Tamariscus is
commended: for this may you look also into these places ensuing, where there
be diverse and sundry things described, whereby the blood may be cleansed, as
in the third part, the eleventh Chapter, and sixth. Item, in the fifth part of
the ulcers and of scabbednesse, which be commonly caused of unclean blood, as
also of the Pockes and the Leprosy, hereafter shall be spoken of it in the
description of Phlegma.

How the abundant bleeding is to be stanched.. 5.
ALso there is nothing to be written of this abundant bleeding, but only to
allege certain places where diverse and sundry remedies are set down for to
staunch blood withal, as in the first part, the eight chapter, and seventh.
Item in the first part, the ninth chapter, and fifth. Also in the first part,
the thirteenth Chapter, and seventh. Item in the second part, the fifth chap.
and seventeenth. Item in the third part, the eighth chapter, and fourth. Yet
again in the third part, the eleventh chapter, and sixteenth. Item, more in
the third part, the fourteenth chapter, and 11.. And if so be that this
bleeding come upon women in childbed too fast, then look for it in the
conclusion of the third part, and before in the seventh chapter, where certain
precious vulnerall potions are described, in which places there may good means
be found, according to the importance of the bleeding.

How to let out superfluous blood.. 6.
IT is no less needful in many men to take away the superfluous blood,
whereby nature is ouercharged, and many sicknesses caused, than in others to
increase it, and this happens most conveniently through letting of blood,
through application of boxing cups, or through fastening of leaches.

Of the letting of blood we have spoken at large in the Introduction, and also
written of the sixteen veins of the body which are wont to be opened, and
likewise in what sicknesses each of them is to be opened, whereby each one that
reads it, shall find a good direction.

The second means whereby this noisome blood may be taken away, are the cups,
whereof we have discoursed at large in the foresaid Introduction. Also in like
sort of the setting on of the Leaches, thither do we direct the Reader, and so
conclude this Chapter.

The eleventh Chapter. Of the natural warmth of man's body.
BEcause we have now written of the veins, and also how the same do spread
themselves throughout the whole body, and other things concerning this,
therefore we will admonish of the natural heat, which with the blood is
imparted unto all parts of the body, for that the blood and the natural heat
be so linked one with another and befriended, that one cannot continue without
the other, but death must presently ensue. Yea there is also none other thing
that gives shape in the beginning to all living bodies, and afterward causes
them to increase to the hour of death, but this natural heat which is borne
with us.

This is the only cause of all working: and it is known, that all that
grows and increases, yea also all herbs and plants wust have their
nourishment thereby, and each according to the right property of his nature
which gives to each thing according to his need, both moisture and dreuth: but
how were it possible that the same may be concocted and altered for the
sustenance and increase of man's body, if there be no natural warmth with it?
This natural warmth does maintain all health, and consumes all bad humors,
it consumes also meat and drink, whereby all inward parts do receive their
power and strength, and also are made apt to do all things whereto they were
created.

The hardened skin will be mellowed and made thin through this natural heat,
all wounds and ulcers be brought to natural matter, it swageth the pain, it
loses and softeneth all contracted sinews. Item, this natural heat is that
which causes the wounded head to heal, and freeth it from all his heavy
accidents, dries the moisture of the same, expels all corrupted bones, and
takes away the venime of all corroding ulcers. This natural warmth does warm
all frozen members, it helps all diseases of the Matrix and priuities, etc.
The same natural heat does heal all broken bones. But how may that be better
seen than by daily examples, which we have daily before our eyes, and as it
appears in old folks? for it is seen that how much the natural heat
abateth in them, so much the weaker and the more incurable do they wax of all
diseases: and most manifestly in the dying, where it is clearly seen, that
how much the more the natural heat does abate, so much the nearer is death at
hand. Therefore must heed always be taken that it be kept in his natural
being: for if so be that the same be too great or too small in any body, then
can follow none other but heavy sicknesses, and at length death it self. The
like may be seen in the Palsy, and in the Plague. Therefore we will here
discover certain things which sustain this natural heat, and do increase and
strengthen the same, and afterward show what is to be used against unnatural
heat. First, there be certain spiced wines, Claret wines, Hypocras wines, and
such like commended for it, but they must be used with providence, to the end
that according to the quality of nature and of the age they may be prepared,
that they heat not overmuch; for that the right nature of wine is, that it
being moderatly drunken, does preserve and sustain the natural warmth, and
strengthens the powers of men. The same does also Elecampane wine, and
confected Nutmegs used morning and evening after meat. The conserve of
Rosemarie does warm all those which be half dead. But what need is it to
write so largely thereof, seeing there is no sickness, which comes through
cold described in all this book, wherein has not been taught how this weak
natural heat might be helped? Hereafter also shall be spoken of the Phlegma,
and by that means also of cold, and what is to be done for these cold
diseases, where further advertisement may be sought for.

Of unnatural heat.. 1.
IN all hot diseases which have been discovered hitherto, be means every where
declared, wherewith this unnatural heat might be quenched and slaked. But we
will here not only allege the passages where the same is taught, but also
declare what may be meet for it. For this, are sundry things described, as
the cooling salve Galem, the salve of Roses, the salve of Saunders, and the
Pomade. For this is also good the Poplar salve, all which you may mix as you
please, or use each alone. In like manner these oils following, as of Poppie
heads, of Roses, of Violets, and of water Lillies, which do cool more than the
oil of Roses, or oil of Violets. For an outward application, take the water
of Corn Roses, and of Nightshade, of each two ounces, sealed earth, and fine
Bolus, of each one dragme, Camfer ten grains, temper them all together, and
lay it upon the forehead, or where the heat is.

One may use inwardly the conserve of Buglosse, of Burrage, of water Lillies,
of Violets, of Cicorie, of red and white Roses, confected Cherries, and
conserve of Barberries. Item, confected roots of Cicorie, Framboys, confected
Peaches (which one may use in all hot sicknesses) and Prunes that be
confected. Item, fresh Cassie is very necessary in all unnatural and sharp
heat.

The sour Dates do cool and purge very mildly, and they do also quench the
thirst. The simple things be Lettice, Endive, Cicorie, and bread that is
steeped in cold water, Fishes, Limons, Oranges, Pompeons, Melons, sweet wine,
Pears, Apples and Cherries, etc. These foresaid things are not only to be used
in hot sicknesses, but also to take them moderatly being in health in hot
times. There is also a sirupe made of the juice of Oranges, of sour
Pomgranates, of white Roses, and of Sorrel, the which do cool much in time of
the Plague, and in all pestilentiall sicknesses, which do inflame the heart and
the stomach.

The sirupe of Roses laxatiue does especially cool all heat of Agues:
likewise also the sirupe of Veriuice, of Violets, of Endive, and of Vinegar.

In like manner also Oxycraton, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses, and of Violets:
the honey of Roses has a meetly cooling nature, therefore the same may also be
used in hot Agues.

When the patient desires to drink in great heat, then be some of these
foresaid sirupes to be tempered amongst it, for which the sirupe of Violets, of
Burrage, and of Roses, be the most principal, if the same be tempered with
well water, or any cooling potion. The same does also fresh well water alone.

Item, Barley water, or Henbroth dressed with Endive, watered wine, Henbroth with
Sugar and Barley, and the water of Larks spur drunken three or four times a
day, these beforesaid do take away the unnatural heat, whether it be in the
Plague, or in any other hot agues.

Take water of Larks spur and of Buglosse, of each two ownces, Cicorie water
one ounce, drink twice thereof morning and evening: it strengthens and
cools also the heart in all hot things.

Take a handful of Raisins, stamp them to pap, and power upon it eight ounces
of water of Buglosse, Cinnamome one dragme, then wring it through a cloth, and
afterward take it, or give it to drink with Almond milk.

But if so be that some unnatural heat do assail you without any special
sickness, then is this ensuing to be used for it: Take a black Cockrell of a
year old, chop it alive one part from another, take the Liver, and stamp it
very warm in a mortar, then temper with it woman's milk of one that gives
suck to a boy, afterward wring it together through a cloth, and give thereof
to the ouerheated body two or three spoonfuls. Some do commend this very
highly, and it may be tried without peril.

Item, the juice of green Nutshels be very good against all accidents which
may be caused of heat.

The twelfth Chapter. Of the Sweat in general.
AFter the description of unnatural heat, we are to write somewhat also of
the sweat (which is contained in the corrupted blood) and pierces through the
whole body. The same is thus briefly described of Galen. Sweat is a cleansing
and an excessive moisture which is mixed with the blood as the whay is with the
milk. Other do expound it more at large. The sweat (say they) is a moisture,
which is caused of the vapors of the body, which spreads it out to the
uttermost parts of the body, and penetrateth out through the skin, whereby the
blood is unburdened of much uncleanness, whereof there be two sorts, the one
natural, which in great sicknesses is a good sign or Crisis, which kind of
sweat does break out also upon men through great labor, or in Summer time,
and is a wholesome and healing sweat, which brings great ease and lightening
with it. The other kind of sweat is unnatural and also hurtful, as is seen
in them which suffer great pain, or that lie a dying: therefore it is not
unjustly said (as also the truth is, that sweat is a sign of all the
moystnesse which reigns in the body. For when as the sweat breaks forth
excessiuely, then is it a sign of great abundance of subtle moystures, and of
the strength of the expulsive virtue. Like as to the contrary, a little sweat
gives knowledge of the toughness and thickness of the same, or debilitie of
the expulsive power. If so be that the sweat be red, then is it a sign that
the blood has the maisterie: but if so be that the sweat be yellow, then has
Cholera the pre-eminence; or if it be white, Phlegma: and if it be blackish,
Melancholia. And if so be that the sweat stink, then must the blood also in
the veins whence the said sweat comes, stink also. Item, these differences
may be perceived by the tongue, that when one will prove his sweat and the
same be sweet, then is it a sign that the blood reigns; and if bitter, then
Cholera, etc.

The causes of the sweat be over hot air, great labor, warm weather,
bathing, to go too hot clothed, and a moist body. But commonly it is caused
through great rioting which is lately committed: the first cause will be taken
away, if one beware of labor, and tarry out of warm air etc. The second
through purging: but the sweat may come of whatsoever cause that it will, it
is always very profitable for a moist body, and healthful: therefore is the
same to be required in many sundry perilous diseases, viz. in franticknes,
Phrenitide, in which the sweat is especially very meet if the same be
excessiuely expelled.

The Physicians which be very expert have taken through the sweat no small
signification of life or of death, and especially in those days which they
call Criticos, which be these ensuing, that do yield also a good
prognostication of health. The 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 14. 20. 21. 24. 27. 30. 31. 34.
and 40. The other which comes between these foresaid days do signify to
the contrary a long continuing sickness. This sweating is also every where
common with all agues, and especially in all hot agues, but after a several or
different manner: for if the sweat be cold, and that it be only about the
head, in the face, and in the neck, then it is a very bad sign: if it come
with a sharp ague, then is it a sign of death, or comes it with a mild ague,
then does it signify a lingering sickness: by which it also signifies that
where the sweat does break out, there the disease and the sickness is.

Moreover, we will add this unto it, that when the blood is unmeasurable
moist, thence springs always a very grievous sickness, for that thereby it
will be waterish (like as the whay of milk) retaining nevertheless the red
color, whereby it comes also that a body sweateth blood otherwhiles.

For sweating be also these rules ensuing prescribed. First, the sweat is not
to be moved before, and yer that the matter be purged whence that this is
provoked, and so long as the patient feels ease thereby, and be not over much
weakened. Secondly, in consuming maladies, as Hectica, and Phthisis, sweating
is not meet. Thirdly, if the sweating get so much the masterie, that a body is
thereby weakened, then is the sweating to be caused to cease by uncovering or
taking away the couerings. Or does it come through over much heat* then is the
patient to live soberly, and to fast. But if so be that it do come through
repletion of the body, then is the same moisture or humor which causes the
sweat, to be purged. Afterward is the body to be anointed with this salve
following: Take Roses one ounce, red Saunders, blossoms of Pomegranates,
Galls, and Myrtle leaves, of each half an ounce: sees all together in four
and twenty ounces of water until the third part be spent; afterward strain
it through a cloth, and put unto it six ounces of the oil of Roses, and then
let it sees so long until all the water be consumed, afterward strain it
through a cloth. With this salve is the patient especially to annoint the side
and the breast. He is also to drink oftentimes Iulep of Roses, and of Violets,
and to moysten the breast sometimes and the sides with cold-water, and also to
sleep alone, but upon no bed which is filled with feathers, and that but light
covered.

The sweating causes also sometimes swouning which is not without danger. This
patient is not to be bounden, rubbed, nor to keep in his breath, like as is
done to others which fall into a swouning by some other cause: for that the
foresaid things do drive out more matter and sweat out of the body. For this
also is wine to be eschued, for that it expels also sweat: but the face is
to be sprinkled with Rose water, and with well water. The patient must also
refrain from over hot labor, and not to cover himself too much. He must set
his bed in a cold place, and hang the same with cold odoriferous things, as
Roses, Saunders, Camfer, Quinces, Waterlillies, and such like.

Whereby the Sweat is provoked.. 1.
AT the first are the pores to be opened, as does the oil of Cammomill, and of
Dill, if one be anointed therewith: or take Pepper, Cinnamom, Calmus,
Rapontica, Pieretrum, Rubarb, Costus, Cassie wood, Balsam fruits, Marierom
gentle, and the juice of white Mints; temper some of these foresaid things
together and sees them with Sallad oil in wine, and annoint you therewith, it
causes a man to sweat.

Further, these things following are to be used before one go to bed, therewith
to expel the sweat, to wit, half a dragme or a whole dragme of Treacle or
Mithridate. Item, take an Onion, and put good Treacle into it, afterward roast
it soft in hot ashes, and eat a good deal thereof, then lay you in bed to
sweat therewith, and afterward dry your self clean with dry clothes.

For bathing, he is to take the quantity of a nut of conserues of Rosemary, or
conserve of Fumitorie, both of them do expel sweat: the conserve of Elderne
berries is the common peoples physic for this purpose.

Item, take Rose water, Wormwood water, and Rue water, of each a like
quantity, and use thereof every morning a good draught: or take one ounce of
Ginger, and sees it in a pint of red wine; afterward strain it without
wringing, and then drink five ounces thereof: it causes also to sweat well,
and that especially in quartaine Agues. Now to the end to abate the heat, then
temper amongst it iulep of Violets. Oxymel compositum does also move sweat.

But if one cannot sweat, then take two or three brick stones and make them
very hot, and wrap them in a wet cloth, and lay first one, and then another to
the feet, under the arme-pits, or the sides of the patient, or between his
legs; then will the vapor cause the patient to sweat. And if so be that there
be a stinking sweat instant, like as the stench of the arme-pits, whereof we
have written in the fourth part, the first chapter, and the second. and in the
second chapter, in the third. then may one with the foresaid, use this ensuing:
Take white Coperas half an ounce, let it boil so long in a pint of water as
one would sees an egg hard, or somewhat longer, and wash you therewith. Also
the sweat will be expelled by anointing with oil of Quinces, or by taking of
Marmalade made with spice.

Of the sweate-bath and other.. 2.
IT is very common that sweat is usually provoked by bathes, which is
attempted after diverse manners, and must be done for many kinds of maladies, as
we have declared in many places: for which now that bathing is noisome and bad,
we have also taught here and there, as the same may be looked for in the Table.

The thirteenth Chapter. Of the Sinews.
IT is a question amongst certain learned men whence the sinews (which the
Latinists call Neruos) have their beginning. Aristoteles was of opinion that
they came from the heart, although it cannot be perceived that there hence any
should come: but Galenus with his followers do say that the sinews take their
beginning in the brains and the backe-bone. And this opinion is not without a
foundation and sure ground, because that as soon as the sinews be inflamed
with any unnatural heat, the brains thereby are so infected, that commonly
these men be distraught of their wits and understanding, yea wax childish, and
as the Physicians name it Deliri. Albertus does reckon to be in man's body 77.
sinews, as well great as small, hard, soft, and other; and therein do all
learned agree, that they be all of a cold nature, yet the one less than the
other, and also without blood, wherefore some call them the white veins.
Amongst these be three principal sorts: the first which we chiefly call
Neruos, which is sinews: the second Tendones, which be the tendones: the third
Ligamenta, which be ligaments or binding sinews. The first sort have their
beginning in the brains, of both the skins of the brains, and in the
backbone, the which Albertus calls the vicegerent of the brains, for that
they be both almost of one nature. These Nerui or sinews, the which by the
Grecians is as much to say as bending, be by nature a little warmer and also
drier than the veins or any other sinews, they are also more sensible than
the arteries, and of such power that they frank and freely impart unto the
whole body all motion and feeling.

These foresaid sinews are by nature so placed in the back bone, and his
holes, which be 60. in number, and that they be spread over the whole body,
giving each part his sense and action; so that each may adiudge what is
hurtful for him, or paineth any whit. They do spread themselves abroad over
the whole body, to wit, out of the backbone, as it were a spring, which with
many sundry spouts or gutters is derived hither and thitherwards, in a
pleasant garden, for to moisten the same, and to impart her water unto it: So
is also our body naturally nourished with these sinews and all other veins,
which (like as is said) receive their beginning out of the brains, and so
descend even to the feet beneath. And although this dispersion be so
bountifully and pleasantly performed, notwithstanding there come no sinews
into the bones, except the teeth, neither yet in the gristles, nor in the
fatness, nor in the ligaments (which be the knitters of the members or joints)
therefore all these foresaid parts have no feeling or motion, neither need
they any.

When as now the foresaid sinews are spread abroad every where in the muscles
or lacerts, which (as is said) are instruments whereby we have all our motion,
yet in other places, where need requires, the other sort are, to wit, the
tendones. These be of a tight compacted substance, easily cut in the length,
overthwart very hardly or scant at all. When as they also (like as is
oftentimes admonished) be wounded, then are they healed with great trouble.
They can also abide no fire, like as the sinews do; for whenever one is
wounded or hurt, then does the same member loose his accustomed action, or will
at the least be much weakened. It is also much to be wondered at, to wit, when
a sinew is hurt, that then there follows much pain and mishap after it; and
being hewed or cut quite asunder, that then the patient knows not of any
pain.

The tendones or lacerts be amongst these three sorts of sinews the most
hardest: contrariwise, the ligaments be the most softest, as shall be showed
hereafter. These tendones be also not so sensible as the right sinews, and be
also much bigger.

The third sort of sinews the Grecians do call Syndesmos, the Latinistes
Ligamenta, (which be bonds or knitters) Albertus does call them Cordas, that
is, cords: these have no feeling where they hold fast in the muscles or bones,
but they bind only the muscles and bones together.

Let this now suffice of the nature of the sinews, and they that desire to
have ampler direction thereof, let them look into Aristoteles, Galenus,
Albertus, and other Anatomici, which have written thereof very largely.

Of hurt and wounded sinews.. 1.
COmmonly the perished sinews do require such remedies as are wont to be used
for the increase of the infeebled warmth, and do dry hard and draw, yet
without any corroding and bad property. The wounds are also to be kept open
long, and if so be that they be too narrow, then make them wider, to the end
that all bad matter may run out. Besides that, all diligence is to be used for
to assuage the pain. If now there be any sinew pricked in letting of blood, or
otherwise, then take oil of Cammomill, of Roses, and oil of S. John's wort, of
each one ounce, three well brayed yolks of eggs, and Saffron one scruple,
temper them all together, and lay it thereon.

For the pain.. 2.
IF so be that there be any great pain in the wounded sinews, then use the
salues Anodyna, whereby the pain may be assuaged, whereof you may find
sufficiently written in the first part, the 4. chapt. and 12.. in the second
part, the 7. chapter: in the third part, the 16. chap. and 4.. also in the
third part, the 17. chap. and 2.. This ensuing is also very meet for it: Take
oil of Lillies, one ounce and a half, oil of Dill and of Cammomill, of each
one ounce, white Wax as much as is needful for to make a salve.

Another Anodynum. Take Walflowers three ounces, oil of sweet Almonds, and
oil of Sesamum, of each one dragme and a half, fresh Butter one ounce,
Saffron half a dragme; white wax one dragme and a half, oil of Dill, of
Cammomill, and Duckes grease, of each one quarter of an ounce, one well brayed
yolk of an egg; then temper them together unto a salve. For this you have also
before in the third chapter, and 7.. a salve, beginning thus, Take oil of
Roses etc. and other things more, which do much assuage the pain.

Item, take the marrow of Calves bones, and very old Sallad oil, of each four
ounces, Earthwormes washed in wine two ounces, sees them together in water
meetely well, afterward strain the broth through a cloth: it is marvelous
good for the sinews, for that it asswageth all pain, and mollifieth the
sinews.

These foresaid things be not only good for the pain of the sinews, which be
caused through wounds, but also for all other pain of the sinews, as this
following is also: Take Henbane seed half an ounce, black Poppie seed one
quarter of an ounce, Saffron one ounce, Hermodactyli two ounces and a half,
small bruised crumbs of bread four ounces; temper them all together, and so lay
this warm upon it, and that thrice in four and twenty hours: afterward
anoint the place with oil of Foxes, or with any such like oil, which shall
hereafter be discovered: After that strew the powder of Earthwormes upon it; or
temper the powder with Honey, and use it as before. It is also good for all
pain of the members, and hardening of the sinews. There may also a plaster be
made of the foresaid Earthwormes, and apply it. Cow dung tempered with oil and
laid warm upon it, is also good.

Item, take oil of Foxes three ounces, Sallad oil four ounces, Earthwormes
washed in Wine two ounces; let them sees all together, like as is said before,
it strengthens marvelous much all bruised sinews, and warmeth also the same,
when they be wounded. Oil of Bricks is good for all pain, and all diseases of
the sinews. In like manner the three sorts of Balsam oil which be described
in the last part.

When the Sinews be resolved and limber.. 3.
TAke Turpentine which is many times washed with Rose water two ounces, pouned
Frankincense, and Corns of the same, of each two dragmes and a half; make a
salve thereof. This does also a salve which is made with washed Lyme and Sallad
oil, or oil of Saint John's wort. Item, there is also good for this all vital
waters.

For Sinews that be shrunk, or for the Crampe of the Sinews.. 4.
ITem, take one ounce of the plaster Diachilon, Ammoniacum and Bdellium, of
each one quarter of an ounce; steep these two gums four and twenty hours in
Vinegar, and afterward let them sees until all the Vinegar be spent, then
mix the plaster amongst it, and also five dragmes of Bears grease: when it
is now sufficiently boiled, then work it well together with the hands, the
hands being first made wet in Vinegar. This Plaster does mollify and digest:
Or take the feeds of Hollihocks, of Flax, and of Fenegreeke, of each two
ounces, oil of Lillies, and of Olives, of each one ounce, Wax as much as is
needful for a salve: this salve softeneth all manner of hardness of the sinews
and of the ioints, it asswageth the pain, it strengthens the extenuated
members.

Take oil of Bohen two ounces, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, of each two dragmes,
Saffron two scruples, white Wax as much as will suffice for a soft ointment:
at the last add one ounce of Neates foot oil unto it. Item, take oil of
Spikenard, oil of Saffron, of each six dragms, Beuercod, Ammoniacum,
Sagapenum; Badgers grease and Bears grease, of each three dragms, marrow of
Ox bones half an ounce, Wax as much as will suffice, besprinkle them all
with Vinegar of Squils. If you would have it digest and dry stronger, add
unto it Pellitory of Spain, Beuercod, Euphorbium, and roots of Costirs, of
each two dragmes, Saltpeter half a dragme, make it all into an ointment: This
ointment is good for the Palsy, and coldness of the sinews, but especially for
the shaking in the fit of an ague. The salve Dialthaea, is very good for the
contraction and shortning of the sinews.

Item, take Cammomill flowers, sprigs of the Juniper tree, Sage, Mallows,
Southernwood, and Nettle roots, of each one handful, shread and beat them
very small, and put unto them 16. ounces of fresh Butter, Dogs grease 12.
ounces, boil them together until all the juice of the herbs be consumed, then
strain them, and add unto them molten wax three ounces, Ammoniacum,
Galbanum, of each one ounce, dissolve the gums in Vinegar, and mix them with
the rest: when it begins to cool, stir amongst it oil of Beuercod 6.
drag. oil of Cammomill 2. ounces, oil of Bays 8. ounces, lastly, temper them
well together. The Apothecaries do call it Vnguentum Neruinum, Vnguentum
Neruinum.
but it is not used every where. Item, take Wax, Pitch, and marow of Ox
bones, of each one ounce, oil of Roses two ounces, mix them all together, and
put unto them the powder of Earthwormes, and so annoint the place agreeued with
it. As concerning the Cramp (which is nothing else but a contraction and
conuulsion of the sinews) has been spoken in the first part the 12. Chap.
and 15.. where also I showed what might be used for it. And this following is
very meet for the same: Take the juice of broad Plaintaine, boil it with
strong wine, and bind it upon the place where the Cramp is. Item, take the
roots of Water Lillies, cut them in round slices, and so apply them, it has
been approved oftentimes. When the Cramp comes in one foot, then bend back
one of your toes, or bind it hard with a whipcord: but the best counsel is, to
arise presently and walk, and to keep the foot warm. Cramp rings are also
worn for it, but I find no great good in them. These oils following are very
commodious for the Cramp, to wit, oil of Lillies, of Rue, of Wallfloures, and
of Turpentine, which is made as follows: Take Turpentine 3. pound, put it
into a body, make fast the head and the receiver unto it very close, distill it
in sand or ashes with an easy fire. First, there comes over a clear water
with the oil, next, a yellow oil, lastly, a dark and gross oil, keep each
apart, for they are good for all cold griefs, and especially for them of the
sinews. There is also good for it the oil of Tyles, oil of Quinces, which
also comfort the sinews. The oil of Cammomill is not only good for the
sinews, but also for all the joints. The oil of S. John's wort is especial
good for the same. The ridge in the back being anointed with the oil of
Juniper, restores motion into all parts. Oil of Bays, of bitter Almonds, and
of Beuercod, have an especial virtue to soften the hard and contracted sinews.

Now follow those things which may be used inwardly.
BOth the kinds of Treacle, and the Mithridate are marvelous good for the
infections of the sinews. Item, take Calmus, flowers of Stechados, of each
three ounces, Currants, Fennel roots, Parsley roots, of each one ounce,
Centory, Coloquinte, Hermodactilis, of each half an ounce, boil them in a
quart of water unto the half, and strain them out hard, then put 12. ounces
of Honey unto it, and let them boil together again until they be reasonable
thick, afterward put unto them fine powder of prepared Agarick one ounce,
Turbith half an ounce, Ginger and Diagridion, of each one drag. and a half,
Spike of Indie one drag. make an Electuary of them. This Electuary purges all
plegmatick, tough, green, and waterish matter from all the parts of the body
both inward and outward. It asswageth all pains of the joints, sinews, and
such like. Give of it at once four or six dragmes with the decoction of
Ginger, if phlegm do abound. Contrariwise in a choleric body give it with
the water of Succory very warm, and let him fast six hours after it, and
before he be set down to dinner, let him drink a good draught of Meade. For
the same purpose also serves the confection of Diacorum, and especially the
first of them which are described in the last part. Likewise the conserve of
Lauender, of Spikenard, of Sage, and the preserved roots of Eringus.

His common drink shall be Meade, or Honywater. Amongst the herbed wines are
these commended, the wines of Elecampane roots, of Rosemary, of Sage and of
Wormewoode. These wynes are all very good for the sinews not only taken
inwardly but also the infected places chafed and fomented outwardly. Common
clisters are sometimes used for to comfort the sinews, whereof there be diverse
described almost every where, and such as may be used according to the place
infected. But a little Coloquint is for the most part added unto them all.

This contraction and induration of the sinews does in time turn to a perfect
lamenesse, whereof has been spoken before in the fourth part, the seventh
chapter, and second. and after that in this fifth part in the second chapter of
the Pockes, in which places you may find sufficient store of remedies to
content your self.

These things following are very hurtful for the sinews, the continual use
of strong wines, ^enery, idleness, slothfulnes, warm water, and especially in
them that are wounded in the sinews.

The fourteenth Chapter. Of the flesh and Muscles or Lacerts.
WE must now speak of the flesh of the body which covers the bones, veins,
sinews, and in fine, all that is comprehended in the skin. First in respect of
those parts which we call Muscles or Lacerts, the flesh in Latin called Caro,
is very little in quantity; for the number of Muscles is so infinite, that it
has been impossible for the ancient Physicians to name them all. Some did
take them to be in number five hundredth, Albertus 529. The flesh and muscles
are engendered of the blood; they are warm and moist by nature, and soft in
handling, and those that are coldish by nature (without any evident heat) they
have much and very soft flesh. That which we call flesh, is placed every where
between the muscles, only differing in this, that the muscles are contained in
a thin subtle membrane, to the end that the sinews with their small twigs
might the better pass through it, and impart their motion unto the muscles.
This flesh is otherwhiles changed into fat, to wit, in fat men, or in them that
live delicately; or else sometimes it decreaseth and the muscles also upon
diverse occasions. They that are very fleshy have also big veins, full of black
blood, with great entrayles, and a big belly. These persons are especially
commanded by all learned Physicians, that they shall not purge themselves in
Summer time.

The other kind of flesh, namely Muscles and Lacerts, are peradventure so
called, because they are not unlike to the Euets: for Lacerta in Latin is a
Lyzard or Euet in English, Aristotle, Albertus, Galenus, with diverse others
have written very curiously of the veins and sinews, and have showed how they
are dispersed and spread abroad over all the body, and how by the Muscles they
move and stir every member severally, whereof we need not at this present
make any further mention. But to speak of them in brief: the body of the
muscles is made of three several kinds of substance, for their beginning and
the very head of them is full of sinews. Their middle (which is called the
belly of the muscle) is flesh. Their tail, or the ends of the muscles is
harder and more sinewie then the head, whereof the Tendons are made. In fine,
these Muscles do consist of sinews, of flesh, of ligaments, and velmes, so
that by the multitude of these sinews, are all the parts of the body moved
inward and outward, upwards and downwards, quickly or slowly, too and fro, all
as a man will himself. Besides this, they are according to their situations of
diverse proportions, as long, thick, broad, etc. and so strangely coadunated and
conjoined, that their use may easier be perceived by their motion, than by
sight, or by any other means whatsoever, but especially, in the face, in the
forehead, and in the lips. These muscles may not be wounded without great
danger, for by reason of the sinews which pass through them, by those wounds
very great and heavy accidents must needs ensue. But the greatest danger is
wounding, hurting, or in any way harming them of the back, for then can the
patient neither make water, nor go to the stool, nor do any other business at
all aright. By these means comes the Cramp, the falling sickness. I will not
speak of the great misfortune that might follow if the same do putrify.
Because therefore the muscles are very sensible, they do find by overmuch
labor, by long walking, by running, and such like, a great debilitie,
wearisomnes, and pain; so do the sinews also and the Tendons themselves. But
it were in vain to show at this present how all the infirmities that the
muscles are subject unto might be remedied, because the same has been
sufficiently spoken of in those places where we have entreated of Ulcers,
Wounds, Pocks, Leprosy, and such like.

The fifteenth Chapter. Of the fat of Man's body.
AFter the description of the flesh it is very needful that we write and
discourse of the fat in man's body. This fat is a division of the nourishment
in the skin and other parts, heaped insensibly and tight together: this
insensiblenes has the fat of the blood whence it is engendered; for that the
fat is none other thing, but digested blood, which also is insensible. By
nature it is most moist; therefore the fat of all beasts, and also the fat of
men is wont to be used for many kind of diseases, as may be seen here and
there in this Book: and (as it is said) the fat has his beginning of the
fattest part of the blood, which runs through the veins toward the skin,
and setting it self on the same and on the sinews (both which are dry by
nature) for to moysten them. But if it happen to touch the parts that be cold
and bloodles, then does it come to congeale, and to wax hard there: therefore
that does most of all happen in cold bodies, viz. in women, and in all such
beasts which have been kept all winter, and be unmeasurable fat; where to the
contrary, all that be hot by nature, wax lean and weak. Amongst all parts
of men and beasts there are none that be fatter than the kidneies, and that
chiefly on the left kidneies, more than on the right; yet especially in sheep
wherein that the kidneies be otherwhiles so abundantly covered with fat that
they cannot make water, but are constrained thereby to die.

Of the troublesomnes of Fatnes.. 1.
THere is no better disposition of body, as well amongst newborn children,
as other ancient people, but that a man be meetely fat, not too lean, nor too
fat: or if so be that any of both must be, it is always better to be lean
than fat: for that if a body be ouerburthened with fatnes, then happens it
amongst other inconveniences, that a body be always slothful, unfit for
labor, and for walking. I say nothing of other diseases and sicknesses which
fat people be more subject to, than the lean. This excessive fatnes comes of
blood, whereby all the parts of a man's body be fed and sustained: the fat
bodies have always narrow veins, and arteries, and therefore also little
blood, and fewer vital spirits; so that when they begin to be old, the
natural heat is wholly abated and very lightly might be extinguished, or at
least wise spilt and lost. Wherefore Hippocrates also says by good right, that
they that be fat by nature, do die much sooner, than they that be lean. But
they that are between both by nature (says he) and afterward wax fat by
their dainty and bountiful diet, they always keep their great veins,
although they increase in flesh and fatnes, therefore in them is less danger,
although they be fat, and that their natural heat be corrupted in them. Also
the Philosophers do conclude (like as we also daily see before our eyes) that
both human and brute beasts bodies which are very fat, do remain
unfruitful. For they have but little and weak natural seed, because that
(as is said) leanenes is to be commended far before fatnes of the body.
Therefore must all men which are inclined to be fat, use these things
following: Take Sandaraca three quarters of an ounce, drink it in the morning
with water, and with Oxymel. Item, take the rindes of yellow Mirobalanes (roast
them as though that they were half burnt) one quarter of an ounce: stamp them
all to a subtle powder, and then give it to drink with Plantaine water. Look
also into the second part, the third chapter, and second. for the Pills which
maruellously hinder fatnes. Item, take every morning a crust with vinegar,
wherein a little Pepper is tempered, drink it very warm. But if one fear
that it might hurt the sinews, then is it to be forborne.

The sixteenth Chapter. For great Leannes.
THe reason why leaunes is better for a body than fatnes, we have discovered
before: nevertheless if the leannes were exceeding much, then is it very
dangerous for healthie folks: for it behooves no great proof that the body
waxes lean, when it wants food, or when the meat does not digest, and is
not conveyed to the appropriate members, or when people be ouercharged with
intolerable labor, with great sorrow, and such like. Likewise do some also
fall into great leannes, for that their body is too cold and too dry: other
will also be lean, for that the digestive and nutritive virtues, or any of
both these be weakened. Item, this extreme leannes is caused also of the
consumption Phthisis, whereof we have sufficiently written before, and also in
the fourth part, the seventh chapter, and second. For this may first be used
all that is forbidden in the excessive fatnes: neither is counsel to be
deferred over long in this disease of leannes: for when as the leannes
begins to root, then does the same not only provoke Phthisin, which is the
consumption; but also other more deadly accidents: so that not only all the
flesh of man's body will be consumed, but also all the virtue and strength.

And what might be used for this falling away, is to be sought for in the two
forementioned places, there is especially commended (amongst other outward
remedies) the rubbing with the flat of the hand of all outward members. All
they that are wont lightly to parbrake, may not be purged in winter, when this
leannes is not caused through some hot agues, but that the meat received is not
by nature conveyed toward his due place: so that (like as it is wont to
chance oftentimes) the ordure is cast out of the mouth, then is the patient to
use good white wine for his drink, yet tempered with water wherein Fennel
seed is decocted. For his meat be Hens, Capons, or rather the broth of them,
that is wroong or stamped out of their flesh. This patient is also to foment
often his priuities and there about, with a spoonge dipped in the decoction of
these things following: Take Fenegreeke seed, and of the white Sesamum, of each
four ounces, Mallows and Smallage, of each three handfuls, Bdellium half a
dragme, Comin three drag. Caruway, Dill seed, Ameos, Fennel, of each half an
ounce, field Cipers, Centorie, of each half a handful, cut that is to be cut,
and stamp the rest, let it sees in sufficient water. You are also to use a
warming plaster for the stomach, whereof there be seen in the third part,
the eleventh chapter, and 5.. and elsewhere described.

This plaster ensuing is also good for it: Take twelve ounces of the broth
wherein sheeps ^^et has boiled a good while, Sallad oil and Butter, of each
two ounces, Saffron 6. grains, Salt one dragme, slight Sugar one ounce and a
half, temper it, and set this Clister one hour and a half before supper; at
which time he is to use the powder which is described in the third part, the
16. chapter, and 3.. beginning thus, Take Annis, Fennel, etc.

The seventeenth Chapter. Of VVearisomnes.
WE have taught in the description of the Muscles, that the wearynes of the
body is caused through great labor, which weakeneth the sinews and the
Muscles, as daily experience does teach us: and when a man is weary without
this cause, as though one had beaten his members in pieces, then does it
signify a great imminent disease. The learned do divide this wearisomnes into
many kind of species, as they that come of ulcers, wounds, and such like, which
may be apparently perceived.

This does come through great coldness of the matter, which is very easily to be
cured, by warm dwellings, by rubbings, by sweet bathes, and such like; which
do warm the members, open the pores, and make the matter in the sinews and
muscles subtle. Nature is also to be kept warm with eating and drinking:
wherefore every such patient is to keep himself with good white wine which is
not too strong, and to use other things more, which shall seem meet for all
cold diseases, whereof we (for a conclusion of this fifth part) shall write
immediately hereafter. Now we purpose only to speak of the wearisomnes which
is caused of great labor: for the which there is no better nor safer remedy
than rest and sleep. But this following may be used for it: Take Rue as much
as you please, temper it well with Sallad oil, and therewith anoint both the
feet: it is very good.

Item, take a little Salt in a cloth, bind it fast together, and dip it in the
water, cast it into the fire, let it roast until it be black, and run
together; afterward poune it and temper it with Vinegar, wet therein a woollen
clout, and rub therewith the soles of the feet.

The eighteenth Chapter. Of Sleep.
IF it be well considered what sleep is, then does it not bear in vain the
high title which is attributed unto it: and because that the sleep does also
oppress the whole body, passes through each part of the same, and brings it
to rest, therefore it is by good right placed in that degree. Concerning his
title, the learned do write as follows. Sleep is a continuing and a
moistening of natural heat, an elected rest of all the members, which does
none otherwise cover and suppress all motions of the mind, than as the ashes
do the fire, which by a little stirring or uncovering of it, will immediately
burn again. And if so be that this rest, which is imparted to the body by
sleep, and is as it were a remedy of labor, then may it well be thought,
that they that cannot rest at all do sleep unnaturally, for that it takes
away the wits and all actions of the mind: wherefore sleep is called of
Ouidius, and Seneca Tragicus, a compeller of all mishap, and a rest of the
mind, the best part of life, an image of death to come, and Deaths brother. And
further, this sleep is a confuser of the true and false visions, a haven of
life, a taker away of wearied sight, and with the Poets, the pleasantest
amongst all goods, yea the only giver of tranquillity on earth. For sleep
drives away sorrow, it is the remedy for sorrow and care, it freeth the heart,
and brings all things to rest. The foresaid sleep is a quickening of the
weary and weak members, a strengthener of the labourer. It makes the King and
his subjects merry, sorry, and blessed. And to conclude, it is then so needful
for nature, that without sleep this life cannot be vpholden. You have before
in the first part, the 12. chapter, and 6.. also in the 10.. of the lithargy;
and in the six natural things in the first part, the fifth chapter, and 10..
all which may serve for this intent. Yet these be the things which provoke
sleep, viz. Conserues of Water Lillies, sirupe of Poppy heads, which may be
used for this purpose: Lettice eaten in the evening for Sallads is also good:
The Conserve of Piony stays all fantasies and fear by night, which will
hinder men of their sleep: Sirupe of Citrons, Wormwood wine, oil of Dill,
oil of Poppy heads, and also that which is beaten out of the heads, and the
temples of the head anointed therewith, are very meet for it.

What hinders sleep.. 1.
THere shall not here be written of Lethargo, which is a species of the Palsy,
and described in the first part, the twelfth chapter, and 10.. but of that
sleep which causes a body to his great hinderance to sleep too much, in some
kind of grievous agues, phlegmatic sicknesses, sweating sickness, and such
like.

Now for to keep sluggards and sleepers waking, thereto are merry folks fit
to company with one, pleasant speech, music, and play, if the patient have
any desire of it: the rubbing of the arms and legs, with or without footwater,
cold water, honey of Roses holden in the mouth: in like manner also the
annoynting on the temples of the head with cold water, and the same sprinkled
in the face.

The nineteenth Chapter. Of Pain.
WE will not here dispute of the outward pain of the body, or the inward
pain of the conscience, whereof the Philosophers and Divines do write. Our
book does only speak of Phisickes sicknesses, wherein the pain is such an
accident of humane debilitie, that there comes not one so small a sickness
wherewith there is not otherwhiles some pain, like as may be seen by all the
foresaid infirmities: and as is here in particular discoursed of all
sicknesses, and to each is attributed his proper remedies for to assuage at
least the pain of the same if it cannot be cured: wherefore we will send the
Reader, and every one that has occasion to take advise therein, to the titles
of all diseases that do molest the body with pain.

The twentieth Chapter. Of Phlegma.
AS we have oftentimes admonished before that the body of man and the most part
of all other living creatures are made and sustained of many kinds of humors,
that so long also as the same be equally tempered, do bring health with them:
contrariwise, if that one do reign above another, it does cause a sickness.

Of Cholera when it gets the mastery, then do hot sicknesses grow out of
it, as may further be read in the description of the Gall. In like manner also
it is taught in the Chapter of the hot stomach, and in other places more.

Of the burnt black blood of Melancholia has been spoken in the first part,
the twelfth chapter, and eighth. and in the second part, the fourth chapter,
and ninth. Item, in the fifth chapter and fifteenth. also in the third part,
the eleventh chapter, and 28.. and in other places more.

Concerning the clean blood, thereof has been written not long ago in the
tenth chapter and third. so that we by good right may also write of the
Phlegma, because that the same does no less penetrate the body than the other.

This bodily humor which is called of the Grecians Phlegma, and of the
Latinists Pituita, is a waterish moisture which runs through the veins of
all the body with the blood; whereby the brains, the neck, the members, the
sinews, and other parts (which draw that humor unto them) be nourished,
moistened and cooled: wherefore it were not good that the same were wholly
expelled by purging.

Also Phlegma does appear by the slime, matter, snot, spettle, and such like
that man a^oydeth.

In fine, all that is cold of nature and moist (says Galenus) we do call
Phlegma, it preserves also his nature in such proportion, that it is no
moister nor colder in the body: and although the same be also thoroughly
concocted, yet nevertheless does it remain always cold, and that not only in
the body, but also when it is driven out of the body with purging medicines, so
that it can be warmed by no means.

This cold moistnes (next to the blood) is the highest esteemed, as it is
(because of the forementioned reasons) most needful to all living creatures.

But this is only spoken of that kind which the Physicians do call the sweet
Phlegma, for that it is of sundry natures, viz. thick, thin, and like to
molten glass or gips: that which is tart and sower, is undigested and crude.
The salt waterish moisture or Phlegma when it is putrified, then does it cause
sundry sicknesses, as vnhealthinesse of the whole body, cold swelling,
sluggishnesse, much sleep, and headache; and especially where it does abound
greatly, then does it cause sower belchings of the stomach, the gowt, and
disease of the sinews* all which shows that this waterish moisture must be
purged, what Physic ought then to be used to expel Phlegma, is sufficiently
declared over the whole book. But for the better satisfaction we will here
describe the best of them.

First, there is nothing more fit, than that all men that spend their life in
daintines and idleness (whereby they do gather much waterish humors) might
observe such an order of diet which might be clean contrary to their former
life, as you shall find described in the discourse of the sicknesses which be
caused through Phlegma.

These be the simple things which consume Phlegma, viz. Penniroyall, Marierom,
Nepe, Sage, Marierom gentle, Hyssop, wild Thyme, Rue, Fennel roots,
Smallage, Parsley roots, Sperage roots, Pepper, Ginger, Cloves, Maydenhaire,
Honey, Squils, Vinegar, and most of all whatsoever is warm, and dry by nature.
Aloe does also purge Phlegma; Cassie does by a secret virtue expel it gently;
Agaricus has power to drive out all slimines, to attenuate the thick, and to
open all obstructions; the hot Gum Euphorbium is used only at the greatest
need; the juice of wild Cucumbers Elaterium expels waterish humors most
forcibly; but it cannot well be used without danger above the quantity of
four grains. In like manner also the leaves of Mezereon four grains, or
six at the most.

The seeds of Palma Christi do some use to the number of thirty when they be
peeled, but it is very much: they do purge the Phlegma very well, but with
great pain and torments of the patient, for that they do purge upwards and
downwards, and are very hurtful to the stomach. Now when the Phlegma lies
deep in the body and in the ioints, then will it by Coloquinte be drawn
forth best of all.

The Mirobalani Chebuli, Emblici, and Bellirici, do purge very mildly, and
that chiefly from the head and the brains.

The seed of wild Saffron does expel all moisture, and especially the
dropsy, one quarter of an ounce, or three dragmes given at one time. Turbith
is also especial good for it, but it is seldom used alone, but tempered with
other things that hereafter ensue, viz. with Seen leaves, Polipodie roots, Sal
gemmae, Stechas, Ireas, Behen, Hermodactyli, Nettle roots, Ginger, Coleworts
broth, Sugar, Hyssop, Agrymonie, Pepper, Hartwoort, Centorie, Hellebor,
Pieretrum, burnt Squils, Sarcocolla, Opopanacum, and Sagapenum.

Amongst mixed and compounded things which do expel Phlegma, be first these
sirupes following, as both the sirupes of Vinegar, both the Oxymels, and Oxymel
of squils, Oxysacchara, Hydromel, Syrupus de Calamintha, de Prassio, and sirupe
of Wormwood; all these do expel Phlegma through the urine. Item, you have
more in the second part, the fifth chapter, a very good potion for the breast in
a dry cough, called Decoctio Pectoralis, which does consume the cold slime.
The confection Benedicta, Hiera Picra, Pillulae foetidae, de Euphorbio,
Cochiae, sine quibus, de Hermodactylis maiores and minores: all these do expel
and purge. Item, Diaturbith cum Rhabarbaro, and Medicamen de Turbith, and other
more.

For a purging potion is this ensuing to be prepared: Take Hearts tongue,
Agrimonie, and Maydenhaire, of each one handful Annis, Fennel seed,
Epithymum, Agaricus, Cuscuta, Parsley seed, wild Saffron seed, Turbith, seed
of Smallage, and Seen leaves, of each one quarter of an ounce, sees them
together in sufficient water: or take Mirobalani Chebuli, and Emblici, of each
half an ounce, and lay it all together in a warm place to steep: afterward
wring it out, and make three potions thereof: then temper of the foresaid
sirupe or Oxymell therewith one ounce or an ounce and a half, and take thereof
every morning. There is also prepared for it this laxatiue confection: Take
Cinnamom, Cloves, and Nutmegs, of each half a dragme, Mace, Cardamom, and
Lignum Aloes, of each one scruple, Ginger one dragme, Turbith three quarters of
an ounce, Diagridion three grains, Sugar six ounces, dissolved in the juice of
Quinces, boil it to the thicknes of Honey, and then temper the rest amongst it:
when it is now almost cold, then take three dragmes thereof, or half an ounce
at once: but in hot weather it is not to be used, it purges Phlegma and
Cholera maruellously.

These things following be also very good, to wit, conserve of Rosemary, of
Sage, confected Ginger, Calmus. and Nutmegs, etc.

Item, Treacle and Mithridate one dragme thereof taken otherwhiles. Tysane or
Barley pap is also very good.

For drink, is wine meetely good to be dronken, for that it consumes slime,
and amendeth all diseases which spring of Cholera: the same does also Betonie
wine, Elecampane wine, the wine of Auence, of Hyssope, of Rosemary, of Sage,
and of Wormwood, the Claret wine, and other spiced wines, whereof shall be
spoken more at large in the last part: likewise also all vital and golden
waters, the sower juice of Pomegranates used in meat or tempered in drink, is
very good. In the first part, the second Chapter, and second. be two pectoral
potions discovered, which be very meet for it.

Now for to use outwardly, you have in the first part, the second Chapter, and
thirteenth. a salve of a roasted Goose, which is marvelous piercing, and
consumes the tough slime. The salve of Roses does also delay all flegmaticke
defluxions. Item, oil of Cammomill and oil of Rue anointed on the outside,
or used with Clisters. Thus much be now spoken of the cold Phlegma; concerning
the hot Phlegma, that concerns the pestilentiall Agues, and other sicknesses
which are caused through heat.

The 21. Chapter. Of the cold diseases.
EVen as we have discovered thoroughly in the discourse of the cold Phlegma,
what here and there throughout this whole book has been declared to be fit
for this purpose, the same shall also be done in the discourse of diverse cold
sicknesses, of whatsoever occasion that they may be caused, as of age, of
defluxions of the stomach, of the Matrix, of the breast, or howsoever the same
might be: first of all therefore we will here teach what might inwardly be used
for them.

First, there is good for it the conserve of Eyebright, which dries the
brains. Item, the conserve of Hyssope and of Betonie, of Gilloflowers, of
Lauender, of Spikenard, of Rosemary, of Marierom gentle, and of Sage. In like
manner also confected Ginger, Calmus, Elecampane roots, and confected roots of
the greater Pimpernell. The confections be also good which be made of the horse
Radish, the Marmalade with spices, both kinds of Treacle, the Mithridate, and
confected Annis seeds be also good. Rosemary wine is for this a very forcible
and healthie drink. Item, Elecampane wine, Hyssope and Lauender wine: and for
moistness of the head is very meet the wine of Asarabacca roots: moreover,
all other spiced wines, as Hipocras and Claret wine be much commended for it;
and if there were any body which could drink no wine, he may drink common
Meade.

Oil of Spica is much commended anointed outwardly upon it against all cold
diseases of the brains, of the stomach, of the liver, of the spleen, and of
all the intrailes. In like manner also these oils following, viz. of blew
Flouredeluce, of Beuercod, of Bay, of walflowers, of Wormwood, and above all
others the oil of Tiles or B^ickes.

In fine, all that is before described for the cold Phlegma, and in other
places for all cold sicknesses, may serve for this intent, and so we will
conclude this fifth part.

The sixth part of this Book makes mention of all such sicknesses as are
incident to the whole body.
WE have treated of many kinds of sicknesses in these former five parts of this
book of Physic, all which pinch and pain one certain part of man's body,
and also sometimes indeed the whole body, for that nature has so knit and
combined all the members of the body one unto another in unmeasurable shape
and uniformity, that as there is any member anguished with pain or any
disease, even then all the other members impart therewith: so that whenever
the head, the heart, the stomach, the liver, or any other suffers, all the
other members (one less, another more) must be partakers of this foresaid
anguish, and in such measure are all of them grieved according to the quantity
of the infirmity. And forasmuch as the Ague is so spread throughout the whole
body, that (as it is commonly said) there is not so small a corner free; yea
further (as all famous Physicians witness and allege for an infallible saying
and Axioma) that there is no disease so small which bringing with it an
alteration of nature, that is without the Ague or Fever: therefore will we
comprehend them all in this sixth part, that thereby we may also detect the
noisome Plague or Pestilence which is also a spice of an Ague, and also some
other, whereof hitherto in our former parts we have not sufficiently declared.

The first Chapter. Of all manner of Agues in general.
THese very common and manifest diseases are called of the Greeks Pyretos, that
is, fiery, and with the Latinists Febris, that is, a seething or boiling, and
in our vulgar tongue we name this sickness the Ague, that is, a superfluous,
hurtful, and vnhaile heat, that sometimes often, and sometimes more vehement
than before comes again, and returns. Or an Ague is an unnatural mixture
of natural spirits in a hotter and drier nature than is necessary. And in
another place, The heat which diseaseth the whole body, we call the Ague.
Again, the Ague is an alteration of natural warmth into a fiery warmth, and
therefore is a hot and dry disease. The old Masters or Physicians named all
such sicknesses Agues, when any stood and complained of grief without any
outward swelling, without the Rose, without anguish, and (to be brief) without
any sore outward. So if there were any that were pained with the stitch in the
side, with an inflammation of the lungs, and such like, then had they their
special names, whereby they account the Ague not to be a particular malady,
but incident and casual or casum: so that they held opinion none to be right
Agues but such where the bad humors in the veins were inflamed, and yet the
outward members felt not any painfulnesse.

And these Agues are of so many kinds, that Hippocrates in describing them in a
manner, forgets his old and brief custom of writing, where he says thus:
Some are long, biting, and yet mild: other without biting at all, but coming
again: some strong and mighty: other that quickly inflame the body: some
continuing at all times, are small and dry: other that bring no manner of
belching or vomit with them. Some are full of filthiness and very ill
favored: other that take one with moisture and sweat. In like sort they have
many kinds of colors, ruddie, Saffron yellow, and some have very bleake
colors. It is not then a great wonder that the cold with the heat do cease at
certain hours; as at one time it continues, and at another time comes
again the third or fourth day, or twice on the third day: so that otherwhiles
it hangs on a body a whole year, yea sometimes ones whole life long. Any
one may decipher the species of Agues as he will, yet nevertheless in truth
there be but three sorts of mingled Agues, and even so they come also through
three manner of causes: that is, out of Cholera, out of a black and
melancholic humor, and out of Phlegma. For every one of these has at the
first two kinds of properties, as an intermission, at one time ceasing and
remaining still, or continuance at all times enduring alike, which are divided
into many sorts, and also mingling themselves with others, according as the
matter or humor is much or little, or more or less putrified, and also even as
the places or parts be inclined whence the Agues grow and spring.

All such unnatural mixtures and Intemperies, whereof we in the first part, in
the first Chapter 1.. and then afterward in the second part, in the beginning
of the sixth Chapter and of the heart, have briefly written, with those as are
needful to be rehearsed again, are eight in particular, whereof the hot and
dry mixtures are the most perilous and noisome, which being first kindled in
the heart, and then spread throughout or over all the whole body, are now
called the Agues.

They are also of this nature (specially the Ague of one day) that if one give
not the patient somewhat to eat, then presently they are of more force and
power: for hunger (in this Ague) otherwhiles dries the patient so vehemently,
that thereby (as in other dangerous Agues) he will be so grieved in his head,
that he seems to be out of his wit. The second Intemperies is almost like to
the first, specially concerning the Ague, but that it is hot and moist. The
third, whereas the moisture or the drouth (be it in what kind of Ague that it
will) prevails the one over the other, but not superaboundantly, or above
mean and measure, this is the best. But when this uniformity is overthrown
and broken, then is it best for all unnatural mixtures that they be hindered,
whereby (as has been showed) they come not to last long. Of like nature is
that, that with cold and heat keeps a just mean or temperature: But where
the drouth surpasses the moisture, thereout comes Intemperies. The fourth is
a just mean, to wit, containing the equal measure in all that has been
said, yet always inclining a little to the contrariety. The other four
mixtures are always either cold and moist, cold, moist, or dry and cold. For
these mixtures of the humors are the very same whence all Agues spring in such
a wonderful manner, that it is not possible for the Physicians to discern
them, but only quotidians from the tertians and quartaine agues, whereon depend
all other mingled Agues, for that they out of this Intemperies do flow as it
were out of a fountain, and are to be easily perceived and known. So that
Physicians when as such Agues reign, must have special care of these three
things; to wit, of the strength of the patient, the occasion of the Ague, and
to know the spece of the Ague. But for the better understanding of all these
things, we will briefly declare certain species of Agues, which Galen has
collected out of many and diverse other writers, and we will first begin with
the very least.

The second Chapter. Of the one days Ague, called Ephemera.
EPhemera of the Greek word is that Ague called, which usually endures but
24. hours. These species of Agues come only in the veins, where they inflame
the vital spirits, whereof we shall more at large speak hereafter. Putridae
Febres are Agues where the humors do putrify in the veins; amongst which are
some that do cease a certain time, whereof the chiefest are the aforesaid
three sorts, that is to say, the quotidian, the tertian, and the quartaine
Agues. The quotidian Ague is bred and engendered of Phlegma, the tertian of
Cholera, and the quartaine of Melanlia, Continua Febris is an Ague that always
without ceasing remains continually without intermission. Causos of the
Greeks, and of the Latinists Ardens Febris, is called a burning Ague. This
Ague continues always after one manner, until that through the health or death
of the patient it be ended. It is such an Ague as burns still after one
manner, and is the very hottest of all Agues: it makes the tongue black and
dry, it brings great thirst, and desire of cold things. If you will now read
more of this unnatural heat, then look in the first part, the 11. Chapter.
1.. where it is in particular described.

Emphysodes, that hurts the mouth through her heat and makes it full of
blisters whereof it has this name given. Lypiria, this cools the patients
hands and feet but inwardly the whole body is inflamed, his water and going to
the stool stopped and stayed whereby also comes thirst and hardening of the
tongue: the pulse will be feebled and small, and the natural heat decays,
and that no otherwise, than as it were altogether extinguished.

Rhoodes, that is as much as a Flixe or Laxe, which happens unto one with
great vomiting, cold, shaking, thirst, disquietnesse, and feebleness of the
pulse.

Astringens, that is, astringent or binding, is contrary to the other before
mentioned, for that thereby the body will be stopped, the vomiting stayed,
with a strong pulse, it endures also long, it wastes the body and makes it
lean.

Icteriades, that is, mixed with the yellow Iaundies, for it brings them with
it. This inflameth the Liver, and dries the tongue in such manner, that it is
terrible to behold: what might be further written hereof, that may you learn
in reading over the description of the Yellowes.

The Pestilent Agues do come with great heat and intolerable thirst, the
going to stool is with much noise and great stench: also the urine stinketh
much: the pulses are so feeble, that one can scant feel them, as shortly shall
be written more at large.

Languidae Febres, are slothful Agues, that distemper the head, stuff the
nostrels, stop ye urine, and going to stool.

Phricodes, that is, when as with the shaking there is a great heat attained,
the pulse feeble and scarce to be felt: moreover, the belly does swell, with
much rumbling and noise, the tongue will be very moist, whereby nevertheless
the patient will complain much of bitterness and drouth of his mouth.

Quotidiana, is the quotidian Ague, that at a prefixed time either in the day
or in the night returns again.

Tertiana, is the tertian Ague, wherewith the patient is one day free, and is
one the third day vexed therewith.

Quartana, is the quartaine Ague, which ceasseth two days, and returns the
fourth day.

Hepialos, is a phlegmatic Ague, whereof the patient sometimes of cold, and
otherwhiles of heat complains. Some name this also of the similitude that it
has with the molten glass Vitrium. Other name it the raw and unconcocted Ague.

Hemitritaea, is the half tertian Ague, that is a very strong Ague that never
ceasseth altogether, but happens one day gentle, and the other day harder.

Errabundae, are erring and wandering Agues, that keep no certain time nor
measure, and these thereby do cause the melancholicke humors to rot and foister
in some place of the body, which otherwise in another place are not touched or
moved at all, whereby all such Agues of necessity are engendered.

Hectica, (whereof also comes Marasmodes) is such an Ague as infecteth the
parts of the body, like as the Ephemera does the vital spirits, and as the
Putridae or rotten Agues do the humors. Of this Ague proceeds the
consumption, which not only wastes the flesh, but also the marrow in the
bones, as we shall hereafter both of this and other Agues declare more at large.

These are now the most principal sorts of Agues, and at this present shall
these brief notes suffice. We will now proceed with those things that
furthermore do appertain unto Agues. Wherefore chiefly it is to be observed,
that every one of them by the Physicians is divided into four parts. The
first they term Accossum, which is the beginning of the Ague: thereupon
follows Incrementum, the increase. The third is Status, that is, when the
Ague is in the highest degree, and stands still. The last part is Declinatto,
that is, the decrease, or declination, of which parts of the Ague we have
elsewhere more at large given intelligence.

There has been also a great debate amongst the learned, whether men might
know every kind of Ague in one day of four and twenty hours; some thought
that no man could rightly judge of the Ague before the third day. So that Galen
in diverse places derideth them, and confuteth their opinion with many profound
reasons. The simple or compounded Agues (says he) are easy to be known, but
the compounded very hardly: yet it is not impossible to discern them in one
day.

Many agues, and most of all other maladies whatsoever may well be known, the
second, third (or at the longest) the fourth day: for there is no disease that
in three or four days might not apparently be judged: so also are all agues
according to the humor into which the blood is altered, qualified, and do also
give a certain Ague of their nature. If Phlegma be cause of the Ague, then of
necessity will it endure very long, and longer if it proceed and come of the
melancholicke humors: but if it ensue from Cholera, then can it not tarry
long, seeing it does vehemently wast the same.

To conclude, all easy agues are ended in four days: as also all violent
agues can kill a body in four days, which may be seen in the pestilent
fevers.

Thus far have we generally spoken of agues, now will we show the means and
remedies for the same, and will first begin with the commonest, and with the
best known; amongst which the most part of the foresaid agues are comprehended.

The least of them all is, the first recited ague, Ephemera or Diaria in
Latin, for that the same seldom holds the patient (not disorderly eating and
drinking) longer than a day, that is, four and twenty hours, because it is
not fixed so fast in the heart, but only in the Spiritibus vitalibus, which we
call the Vital spirits. This ague has no corrupt or rotten humors that can be
incended or can provoke any swelling of the outward parts.

To conclude, this ague is likened unto a hot air that quickly loses her
efficacy and power.

This ague is thus described: Ephemera is an ague wherein the vital spirits
are incended, and so spread over the whole body without any long permanence.
And that is a certain token of such kind of agues, that they must always have
some cause going before, whereby it is procured; as namely, wearines, much
watching, wrath, great sorrow, and such like vexation of the mind.

Item, the heat of the Sun, cold, great labor, drunkenness, venomous air,
and heat about the priuities, be it through swelling, or any other occasion,
conversation with sick men, or those that be diseased in the lights, use of
indigestible meats, and such like.

The tokens whereby they are known are needless to rehearse, by reason that
they may be perceived and known of the patient, thereby the better to remedy
the same.

For amongst all others, this disease is never more apparent than in the urine,
and by the pulse: for that in this ague the urine is commonly higher colored
than accustomed, and the pulse much swifter; as anger also is deformed by his
own pulse.

Item, great sorrow, and a disquiet mind have also their own signs. Also by
what observations, and how the Cholera, the melancholy, the Phlegma, and the
blood is known: we have taught in their due place.

Those that are troubled with the agues that breed through any swelling or
ulcers, they feel a continual swift, and hard beating pulse: they are very
hot burning with a ruddie countenance and white urine.

And to conclude, they are all commonly Ephemerish agues that have the pulse
equal. And albeit the same sometimes be unequal, yet is it scarcely to be
perceived very ill to be.

These are now the most usual and convenient signs of this ague, which we
have said are very easy to be helped if men look unto it betimes: for being
delayed too long, then fall the diseases into agues that are worse, and be of
longer continuance: as namely, in Putridas, and Hecli^^s, so that many by
negligent delays fall into their perpetual destruction.

Therefore use these remedies following for it: first, a bath whereby the pores
are opened, that thereby all noisome vapors might exhalate. For when as they
are shut up, or through exterior cold closed together, then must all such
infectious humors remain in the body, whence diverse perilous agues are
caused.

For all those that are infected with the ague through any swelling of the
priuities, is the air hurtful either before or after the bath: but above all
things it is in other agues to be shunned. But if any one will tarry long in
the bath, then must he be gently anointed by the hand with Sallad oil,
especially such as got their agues through labor and travel.

The diet of the diseased must be such as may engender good blood of a light
digesture. Those that through the heat of the Sun, or by wrath or anger are
fallen into this ague, they must use cooling and moistening things; if through
cold, warm things; through watching, sorrows, and cares, moistening things,
and such as will provoke sleep. All those that are thus afflicted, may well
use wine that is small or watered; for such is always more fit than water
alone, because it expels water and sweat.

But in all these points is to be observed the age of the patient, his
strength, his custom of living, the season of the year, and the nature of the
country, and such like.

All those are forbidden wine, that in this ague proceeding of the heat of the
Sun, have a swelling of the priuities, or of any other part, till such time as
all such inflammations be ended: The like also for all such that have their
pores obstructed, and be therewith strout and corpulent of person.

All such as through ouerwatching, or through great sorrow are fallen into a
small Ague, must after their bathing be fed with moist meats, that are light
of digestion, and make good blood. To those that by reason of long watching are
feeble, may the wine be allowed without further regard or care, unless they
had much headache, or feel great motion of the pulses in the temples of the
head, these common rules must also be observed in other feauers.

All those that get the Ague through wrath, sorrow, or deep speculation, they
may drink wine well enough: in like manner also the idle headed, but only
when their fit or madness is past, before which it is very dangerous to use
the same.

This also is a common rule, first always to seek remedy for all those
accidents that are most troublesome, or to take away the cause of the sickness
by his contrary, as labor by rest; wrath, sorrow, and madness, with merry and
pleasant conceits; watching with sleep; those that get it through much
speculation must wholly leave it off: even so must it be with the swelling and
inflammation of the priuities, that the same may heal, and the pain be
assuaged.

Here have thou briefly set down, what order of diet and other things are to
be observed in any accident whatsoever. Now will we learn you after the
briefest manner we can, what things are to be used in any of the foresaid causes.

When as then any body through the heat of the Sun, or through a bath,
falls into an ague, then must you anoint his head with the oil of water
Lillies, Roses and Violets mingled together, or each alone: you may also make a
decoction of cold herbs, or oil of Willowes, or of any of the foresaid oils
mingled with it: and then let it drop from on high on his breast. If the
patient have great thirst or drought, then give him to drink Well water, or
Almond milk.

When the ague is past, then let him bath as has been abouesaid. But if the
ague proceed of outward cold, then is sweating good for it: or can he not
sweat? then may he use warm bathes, wherein has been decocted wild and
garden Mints, Smallage, Fennel, and Parsley, with the roots.

Also anoint the head with the oil of Dill, of Cammomill, and with oil of
Behen: but he must forbear the drinking of water. Likewise lay the patient in
a meetly warm chamber, anointing his body softly, and when the ague is past
and gone, then may the patient use to eat all manner of land fowls, and such
like food. Is he then corpulent and full of blood? then open a vein, and let
him use in this bath stone Rue, Cammomill, Fennel and Stonecleuers, etc.

Or come these Agues through the use of any hot meats? then use cold things;
as Lettice, Purslaine, and the juice of Pomgranates.

Purge with Cassie, Manna, sower Dates, or with Conserve of Prunes. Take also
of the Confection Diatriasantalon, Endive water, Oxysacchara, Iulep of Roses,
Barley water with a little Vinegar, Camfere, Lettice, Purslaine and such like
cold herbs, or the juice of them. If this Ague come of drunkenness, of strong
wine, or such like drink, then must the patient urge himself to vomit, or to
purge with the foresaid cold things. If there be adjoined a great pain of the
head, then must you anoint it with the oil of Roses, or with some juice of
cold herbs.

Or if this issues through great sorrow, fear, flight, over much watching,
madness, wrath or such like, then remedy these things as is said, by their
contraries; to wit, with mirth, music, comfort, sleep, and with such like:
he must also shake off and forget all causes of sorrow and fear.

Likewise this patient shall smell unto Roses, Violets, and Saunders, and wet
clothes in the muscilage of Fleawoort, and the juice of cool herbs, mingled
with a little Camser, and lay them upon his head. When the Ague proceeds of
wrath, especially in young folks, then is the wine to be refrained.

These Agues also proceed as well of exceeding joy, as they do of great wrath,
albeit the same chances seldom; yet it is by the foresaid means in like
sort healed.

These agues may also come very easily through excessive labor, by reason that
the same heateth the vital spirits.

For the same must be prescribed light meats, rest, bathes, measurable
sleeping.

Or if these Agues be caused of overmuch sleep and rest, as often it falls
out, then shall he constrain himself to watch, and let his body be rubbed
over with hot clothes.

These agues are very subject to all fluxes of the belly, and dysenteries of
what cause soever the same does proceed.

For this are all astringent and binding things to be used, and to do all that
is fit to be done in such like sicknesses.

Also Cotton dipped in the oil of Masticke, or oil of Quinces, and laid over
the stomach: but upon the liver and heart cool things.

If the patient should thirst or hunger, then shall he use, and especially at
the beginning, Barley paps, Oaten paps, water bathes, and rest: and for his
drink he shall take water mingled with the juice of Pomegranates. But if he be
cloyed with too much meat, then causes it lightly ague to follow: for which
Clisters, purgations and sobriety are to be used: but if there be any sower
belchings upward admised, then use Diagalanga, or Diatrionpipereon, and anoint
the stomach with the oil of Masticke, the oil of Wormwood, or with oil of
Spike, laying sheep wool thereon. Afterward when the ague has left him,
let him use sleep and sobriety. The agues which proceed of any impostumes,
ulcers, Pleurisies, puffing up of the Lights, swelling of the priuities, which
is caused of pain, Cholera, heat, and thirst (more than the foresaid agues
are) these shall you remedy thus: first, search out of what humors they grow;
if of blood, then must the patient open a vein, thereby to ease the impostume
or any other hot swellings: or do they come of Cholera? then must the patient
be purged; and moreover the ulcers or impostumes must be cleansed, ripened, and
healed. It happens also, that as young children have the worms, they also
fall into such an ague: for this all such things are to be used as are ordained
and thought most meet for the destroying of worms, and especially a salve,
beginning thus: Take oil of bitter Almonds, etc. Thus have we sufficiently
spoken of Diarie agues, and mentioned how they are to be dealt withal.

The third Chapter. Of the continual Ague, Continua, in general.
GAlen terms these continual Agues Continuas Febres, which from the first
time that they enter upon a man, endure continually, without intermission, if
they be not through health or through death dissolved, albeit that otherwhiles
they wax a little fainter or flower: yet nevertheless sometimes many days, yea
weeks, endure still. Of these are chiefly twain, the one that increases the
third day, which is more perilous than the other: to wit, than those that
change their nature ye second day: and by reason of this alteration, the
Physicians do give these Agues diverse names, whereof the principallest is
Typhodes, that is, burning, which greatly agrees with the half Tertian ague.
Then is there Synochus, which proceeds of a superfluity and inflammation of
the blood mixed with Cholera, takes hold most of all upon the bodies of young,
temperate and hot persons, whereof we shall hereafter speak more at large. The
signs of these Agues be, that 24. hours long their fit continues,
inconstantly beginning and increasing. The pulses of them are swift and hard,
the urine is redder than it was before. These things following are also to be
observed, and well to be remembered, that in dry and hot weather they are few,
yet strong and bad Agues do reign, but without any sweat at all: In wet
weather are these agues most rife, and that with sweat.

For so much as these continual Agues are first of all described amongst hot
agues, therefore here will we admonish the Reader, that we make this our
discourse so much the longer, to the end we might declare the matter more
openly: and that such hot agues as hereafter follow, may thereby the better be
known, and easier cured, and that especially in this. wherein shall be taught
the means which are to be kept in meat and drink, in vomiting, and sleep,
also what might revive those that are so diseased, whereby they should be eased
in great heat, and after what order they should govern themselves, their ague
being gone.

The Ague that is continual, Continua.. 1.
THe occasion of all such mighty Agues is the putrefying of the humors within
the great veins: and the cause of the putrefaction aforesaid is a stay and
detaining of superfluous tough humors that are carried in the body, the heat
whereof approaching to the heart enflameth the same. This commonly happens in all
such bodies that are filled with tough humors, or that the veins through heat
of the same are over dried. This Ague also may engender of venomous air; as in
the time of pestilence is to be seen. Item, through great cold (whereby the
pores be shut up) through sore labor in the hot Sun, through much watching,
through great anguish, grievous thoughts, and through a great flux of the
belly.

The common signs of this mighty ague, are pain of the head and great heat
(easily to be felt) watching, great thirst, swift and unequal pulse, red,
thick, and yellowish urine, the patient rages in his sleep, his senses are
troubled, and complains of terrible dreams. If he be young, and the season
of the year be hot, and that he dwell in a high and hilly country, then are
all these recited signs the likelier to be certain and true.

The order of diet in time of hot Agues.. 2.
IF so be that these patients desire to be rid of these Agues, then is it very
needful that they have a good government or order in eating and drinking, and
they must have special care to be fed with such meats, through which they may
be cooled, the blood purified and moistened, whereby the heat and drought may
be withstood. In like manner shall the patient be kept in the beginning of his
sickness (whilst he is in strength) sober in eating and drinking, and
increase the same according to opportunity. In like sort with the letting of
blood, if the patient be red in the face, his veins full and young, then is he
to be let blood (in a very hot ague) until he fall into a swoune.

But if the patient be so weak, that such forcible letting of blood may hurt
him: then let it be done at diverse hours, every time a little, two or three
days together, for some are to be dealt withal more gentlier than other, and
require that the Saluatella upon the right hand (to wit, by the little finger)
may be opened, and that there shall about five ounces of blood be let out.

We have before given order what kinds of meat this patient is to use, that
the same must be cooling and cleansing the blood, as Cicorie, and Endive, with
the roots, water Cresses sodden in his meat: and in like sort also a Sallad
made of the same herbs and roots, with oil and Vinegar; and there is chiefly
to be put into the same Sallad, Liuerwort (that uses to grow besides the water
Cresses) which is passing good. Also the juice of Oranges, Pomgranates, or
Limons are to be used with his meat: and amongst other herbs, Spinach,
Beetes, and Turnips, with their leaves are excellent good. Item, Lettice,
Endive, and Parsley, and mingle amongst them sometime a little Marioram,
Penniroyall, and wild Thyme, and Hyssope (but once) for that it is warm of
nature. Of fruits let him use Damask prunes, Oranges, and Pomegranates. And of
flesh let him be served with that of Calves, Hens and Capons, the which are to
be bruised and eaten with the broth, also make sops with Vinegar, mingling ye
yolks of eggs and Sugar amongst it. Item, Partridges, Fesants, field fowls, and
such like are not hurtful: it is also to be noted, that with the flesh is to
be sodden Parsley roots, Cicorie roots, and Veriuice, with a little Marioram and
Hyssope. Moreover, the seeds of Lettice, Melons, and Cucumbers, are passing
good: yet not all together, but sometime of the one, and sometime of the other.
Peeled Barley sodden with Hen broth is much set by: and also Hen broth alone,
wherein a little bread is soked.

Item, shiues of bread soked in water, and the water powered out, and afterward
the juice of Pomegranates powered thereon, and bestrewed with Sugar, is very
good meat for all such maladies. Some are of opinion that the flesh of a
Magpie, is a certain good medicine for the Ague: and some suppose that young
Magpies with the feathers distilled, and the water of them given to the patient
to drink, and it were not amiss, that in the distilling of them, there were
put the roots of Parsley and of Elecampane.

For these hot Agues may fountain water be drunken, or any other clear river
water, that has been sodden once before, or powered a good while and often out
of one pot into another. Or you may mingle with this water iulep of Violets, or
iulep of Roses, and so drink it vnsodden: Barley water is a very fit drink for all such maladies, and may be mingled with the foresaid Iulep.

Wine (though very little) is otherwhiles permitted: and also Sugar water, and
sodden Hen broth (the fat blown off) is very good.

Common rules for Agues.. 3.
ACcording to the prescribed ordinance or government of the life, we are to
show in like manner the remedies and cures. But first we will declare certain
rules, which in all hot Agues must be observed: that thereby for all such
maladies a better order may be had and kept. The first rule is, how to discern
easily, that the patient cannot come to his health, until the putrified matter
of the Ague be purged away. Secondly, the eyes are to be fixed upon that matter
that ingendreth the ague, that the same be prepared for purging, the ague which
is present be corrected, and that which is to come be hindered. Thirdly, when
this putrified matter is to be taken away, then must care be had how to open
the obstructions, which are the foundations of the ague, for otherwise there
can no good be done. Fourthly, if the Ague be forcible and hot, and the
patients strength very small to resist ye same, that it is impossible for the
patient to tolerate the violence of the ague, then must the patient not be
suffered to use many cold things before, that thereby the natural heat be not
quite extinguished: but if he be strong, and may withstand the sickness, then
cut off the cause, expel the matter, keep the patient sparingly, and let him
not use over cold things. Fifthly, if natural strength in the ague be very
weak, then must the Physician strengthen the same, cool the unnatural heat,
and with meet food comfort the debilitie of the body. Sixthly, ye cooling of the
ague is not to be effected with drying or binding things, unless it be when
the material cause is expelled. Seventhly, if the nature and quality of the
ague be doubtful, then must the patient live sparingly, and especially when
the Ague assaileth, that it may find an empty stomach. Eighthly, all fresh
fruit are very hurtful, by reason that they will soon stink and putrify in
the stomach. Ninthly, while the patient is in good strength, and has blood
enough, or is full of humors, then first of all let him blood, and especially
when as his urine is red and thick, and when it is doubted, that the Cholera
will get the upper hand. Tenthly, and if so be (as is rehearsed) that nature be
of ability, then use those things first which loose the body mildly;
afterward open a vein, and then purge. Eleuenthly, in these kind of agues
there is no strong purgation to be ministered. Twelfthly, if by the wambling or
pain of the stomach, it be perceived, that the corruption falls into the
stomach, then shall you minister to the patient a vomit: but if through the
rumbling of the belly it be perceived, that the matter be fallen down into the
bowels, then is it to be expelled with purgations. Thirteenthly, those
medicines that might hurt the bowels, be noisome and not commodious, in case
that the patient have not used preparatiues before, be it in heat or cold: or
in case that the corruption made not the patient stark mad, or that he were in
doubt to fall into a greater mischief. Fourteenthly, as the blood prevails,
and that a vein must be opened, then is the preparation of the matter to be
expected, by reason that the same concerns the other bad humors, and not the
blood. Fifteenthly, when the Crisis is near hand, you must forbear to
minister any medicine.

But if the same be imperfect, then is it to be aided, and to help nature in
that, which she can not perform of her self, that is, in strengthening her,
and in right use of the medicines. Sixteenthly, if the letting of blood be
thought meet, then is the same to be done at the first, for otherwise it will
not do so well; for when the patient is over weakened, then might the same be a
mean of his death. Seuenteenthly, the patient is to be purged when the Ague is
weakest. Eighteenthly, wine bathes and fomentations are to be abstained in
forcible and strong Agues, and rather drink cold water, which has great
efficacy to cool the heat of the Ague, but not to expel the putrified
matter through the pores, or through the urine. Ninteenthly, when the
principal parts of the body (as the Heart, the Head, the Liver) be strong,
and the Ague is vehement and hot, then may you boldly give the patient water
to drink, yet not if he be in years, for those are not very strong of nature.
Twentiethly, if there be much blood, much tough slime or fleame, and binding of
the body present, then first of all let the patient blood, afterward
attenuate the matter, and lastly open the pores and warm them. One and
twentiethly, above all things have regard to the strength of the patient, and
if he be strong enough and that he have need of purging, then is the same to
be executed without any care: But if his strength be small, then let it alone
at any hand, except it be some gentle thing, and after that he be somewhat
strengthened. Two and twentiethly, if in the Febris putrida be any obstruction,
then heed is to be taken to open the same, the which if it be caused of some
humors, then are they to be euacuated. If those humors be tough and gross,
attenuate them. And if the Ague be mixed, then prepare your medecines
accordingly. Three and twentiethly, because the cold attracted air penetrateth
to the heart, and other inward parts, let him thereby be refreshed, opening all
manner of windows about him. Four and twentiethly, it happens otherwhiles,
besides the grieuousnesse of the disease, and the presence of diverse accidents,
that sometimes there are those things given to the patient that are hurtful
for the Ague, as in the swounings in the Ague, for the which of necessity Wine
and fresh broth are to be given to the patient: wherein is to be considered,
that the greatest extremity is first to be eased. Five and twentiethly, if
need require that much blood or humors are to be taken away, and that the
strength of the patient will not abide it, then must the same be done by little
and little at diverse times, and not at one time, even as is before expressed at
large. But if the strength of the patient will permit it, then is it to be done
at once. Six and twentiethly, in these forcible and vehement Agues must the
Physician be provident and wary, how to expel and purge: for it is better to
leave one part of the matter in the body, then to expel it all at one time.
Seven and twentiethly, the Physician must always be hold and liberal in
comforting the patient; for although healthful meats breed some
inconvenience, yet are they better then too much abstinence. Eight and
twentiethly, minister always unto the patient for his mouth such things as
will keep his throat moist, that through great heat it dry not too sore,
the which is accomplished by the muscilage of Fleawoort, the juice of
Pomegranates, the muscilage of Quince kernels, by Purslaine and Licorice, which
things also are good for to quench thirst.

Of common things for hot Agues.. 4.
AFter the description of the common rules (which are to be noted) we will
now treat of this, namely, when it is found, that an Ague does approach, then
must the patient take four ounces of the water of Carduus Benedictus.

Item, take the roots of Cicorie, cut them, powne them, and wring out their
juice, drink a spoonful thereof half an hour before the Ague assayleth: but
it is to be noted, that the inward heart of the root is to be taken away. Or
take powned roots of Cicorie, as many as you think good, and power Wine
thereon, boil them in Balneo, and then drink thereof three or four times, to
wit, morning and evening: it is also passing good for such as are swollen with
the Ague: Cheruell water is very good to drive away the Ague.

A marvelous water of the ancient Physicians: Take a spoonefull of Fennel
seeds, and as much Salt, powne them together: and let it run through a
Cearse or hairen Sieue, then take good Vinegar, and the urine of a man child,
about six ounces of each, give to the patient thereof three or four times, to
wit, when the Ague begins to assail, and have regard that he vomit it not
up again. This do all the Physicians use, but hereafter follow many better and
fitter things.

Out of the foresaid things easy it is to be noted, that for all hot agues
these waters ensuing are passing good, as water of Endive, Cicorie, Burrage,
Cuscuta, Sorrel, Maidenhaire, and such like.

All Aguish diseases may freely use these sirupes, or any of them which one
lists, as sirupe of Vinegar, of Veriuice, Violets, Cicorie, with Rubarb or
without, of Citrons, Roses, Endive, or of Sorrel. Item: Syrupum de Iuiubis, de
Byzantijs, Acetosum compositum, de Radicibus, Oxymel, and Melicratum, and if
there be not much Cholera abounding, then use the Honey of Roses, which is good
for all Agues: take thereof which you will, and mingle it with the water of
Lyuerwoort, of Endive, and Fumitorie, Sorrel, or with the water of
Maidenhaire, and such like. Of these confections following, you may use which
you please, as Diarrhodon, Trisantali, Trociscos de Spodio, cum Semin^
Acetosae, de Eupatorio, de Berberis, powned, and mingled with any of the
foresaid waters, and drunken. And the whay of Milk is chiefly commended. These
are the meats that an Aguish body may well and commodiously eat and use.

Of the lothing of meat in them that be assailed with the Ague.. 5.
FOr as much as in all hot Agues the appetite of feeding is taken away,
whereby nature is suppressed and waxes faint, and thereby scarce able to
resist the Ague; therefore it is very requisite that herein good counsel be
had and taken.

For this you find in the third part, the eleventh chapter, and ninth. what is
to be done herein: likewise you may use for it any of these things ensuing.

Take Conserues of Roses two ounces, confected Citron rinds, sirupe of Apples
as much as you think good; mingle them together, and use thereof fasting at
each time half an ounce.

There is also a confection or compound, that is called the Kings sauce, the
which is very good to provoke appetite, and the same is to be made with
Sorrel, Cinnamom, Cloves, and Vinegar. Others make it of Vinegar, Sorrel,
Fennel, and Parsley.

The third sort, take the juice of Parsley, Sugar, and Vinegar. Item, one may
compound sirupe of Vinegar with Oxymel. In like sort there is good for it both
the sirupes of Mints. After meals it is very good to use prepared Coriander
seed, Annis seeds, and Almonds confected. Item, Cinnamom, Marmalade,
Conserues of Roses, and honey of Roses, roasted or baked Pears are also
excellent good.

Every such patient is to be outwardly anointed with the salve of Saunders on
the place of the Liver, and on the Kidneys, with the cooling salve of Galen.
This water here next following is also very sovereign to be used thereto for
the washing of the feet.

Take Sage, Cammomill, and Bayberries, of each a handful, Marioram half a
handful, Citron rinds, and Orange pills, of each half an ounce, a pint of
strong wine, and common Ley, as much as will suffice: let them all sees
together, and use it oftentimes, for it will provoke appetite.

For the thirst in hot Agues.. 6.
BEcause continual Agues provoke great thirst, therefore we will not cease to
give some knowledge and caveat how the same may be helped and remedied, the
which will be effected with Barley water, and with cold and moist things, and
also with such losinges as be prepared and made with the muscilage of Fleawort,
the muscilage of Quince kernels, and with Dragagant.

Sugarcandie, and the kernels of Pomegranates, are also very often to be used,
and he shall receive the cold and moist air. Before in the third part, the
twelfth Chapter, 10.. there are also diverse things declared, being all very
good to slake or quench the thirst.

Item, take sirupe of Violets one ounce, Barley water three ounces, Cinnamom
water one ounce, oil of Vitrioll three or four scruples, mingle them
together, they will become a red potion with a tart or sharp taste; but because
there are other more pleasanter things, do I counsel you to leave out the oil
of Vitrioll.

Of purging and such like.. 7.
ANd for the expulsion of this matter or corruption in the best manner, thereto
is very sovereign washed Aloe which is described in the Introduction. The
common plague pills be also passing good for the same, the which pills are called
de Tribus, and are to be mingled with Rubarbe.

Also once a week at the least, let the patient take in some cooling and
laxatiue medicine: as namely, conserues of Prunes, and Cassie, the which are
good in old maladies; and therefore is commonly to be given an ounce and a
half, with half a drag. of Rubarbe. Manna is excellent good for it, and the
confections of Diamanna cum Rhabarbaro, the which are to be had in all well
furnished Apothecaries shops. There are some that give counsel (and that very
well) that the next day following the patient is to take three ounces of
laxatiue sirupe of Roses mingled (if it please him) with some distilled water.
Also there is good for it the losinges de succo Rosarum, Diaphoenicon, de
Psillio, and Diacatholicon: or use this potion following: Take sour Dates one
ounce; break them in Cicorie water, and strain it through a cloth. This done,
mingle Cassie and conserve of Prunes, of each half an ounce, half a drag. of
beaten Rubarbe, and five grains of Spica amongst it. Take this in the morning
early, and thereupon fast afterward six hours.

There are also cooling clisters used for it which the Physicians do call
Lauatiua (that is, cleansing Clisters) by reason that they are for none other
purpose, but to strengthen the bowels, to make them slipperie, and to warm
them, as these ensuing: First, take Barley water and Sugar, or broth made of a
sheep portnance, wherewith is mingled fresh Butter, or Hogs grease,
otherwhiles Beetes, and Mercury. Likewise there are many clisters of Sallad
oil, and oil of Violets, and also (in the pain of the belly) of Linseede
oil without putting any other thing thereto, but twelve or sixteen ounces
taken at one time for one clister. And when the going to stool and urine are
to be provoked, then use thereto fresh broth that is most common and fit,
wherein Barley is sodden and is mingled with oil. Or if you will have it
stronger, then take an ounce of any of these confections mingled amongst it, as
de Sebestis, Hiera, Diaprunis, Cassie, Thomas Sugar, oil of Violets, Honey of
Roses, or of Violets.

For the vomiting in the Agues.. 8.
ALl that lie of hot Agues may easily be brought to vomit, and that chiefly
after their taking of any medicine, and to prevent it, look into the third
part, the 20. chap. 7..

For the loss of Sleep.. 9.
THey that are plagued with the Agues are easily barred from their natural
sleep, and to further the same, look into the fifth part, the 18. chap. where
is sufficiently treated what hereto belongs.

For to relieve them that be sick of the Ague.. 10.
FUrthermore, there are many things that revive these patients whereby their
heaviness (that proceeds from the heat of the Ague) might be clean taken
away: to wit, that fresh linen and sheets be given often unto them, their
beds often rowzed and made, also set in their sights glass bottels filled with
fair water, put often fair water out of one pot into another in the presence
of the patient. Urge him to smell often to a glass filled with fair water,
Rose water, and good Renish wine, and give them Pomgranats, Oranges, and
Rhenish wine to suck upon, and especially before meat. Let their hands and
face be often anointed before and after meat with some pleasant odoriferous
things.

For the relief or comforting of the sick.. 11.
THese kinds of hot maladies require also, that sometime the diseased have
somewhat given them, whereby the natural spirits may be revived, quickened,
strengthened, and cherished. Therefore it is requisite that we write somewhat
thereof.

Hereto is very sovereign the black confected Cherries, red and dried Cherries
with the Conserues of the same, and all that may be made of Cherries.

The confected Muscadell pears, with or without wine, according to the
quality of the Ague are passing good.

Item, conserve of Berberries, and the sirupe of the same, are also very good
for it: And in like manner all that may be made of Raspes.

Item, Conserve of Buglosse, of Burrage, and of Roses, each apart or mixed
together.

Sugar of Roses melted in Well water, and so drunken, is also passing good for
the same: and in like manner the Sugar of Manus Christi.

Some use for lauing a shiue of bread soaked in Rosemarie wine, for that it
strengthens and quickens appetite; but it is better for the cold than for
the hot Ague. If so be that the patient do get blisters in the mouth, or the
tongue furre, and the throat do burn, as chances oftentimes, then look into
the first part, the thirteenth chapter, and second. where you shall find very
good remedies for the same.

Ordinances for all those that are recovered of a long sickness.. 12.
NOw if it come to pass, that sick folks begin to amend, and the disease
wear away, the breath begins to be free, the pain to cease, the sleep to
come, and have lust and appetite to their meat, then may be freely said, that
the patient begins to recover: then is the patient to be kept very sober in
his diet of eating and drinking, and not feed upon any other meats then are
requisite for such like diseases, like as Barley grout, Currants, and broth
wherein the roots of Parsley and Cicorie are sodden, for that all these things
do strengthen and moisten. There must also be used outwardly for the
strengthening of the stomach, oil of Mints, of Masticke, of Wormwood and of
Spica. You may also make a salve for the stomach, with the foresaid oils,
being mingled with Cloves, Nutmegs, and Cinnamom, and with a little molten Wax.

Item, the plaster of Masticke, and other plasters mo, that are specified in
the description of the stomach, are very good for it, being laid on the
stomach outwardly. Concerning the patients binding of the body, you may use
any cooling things, specified in the third part, the eleventh Chapter, and 20..

Above all the rest that is spoken of before, for the recovery of all
diseases, it is passing good to alter the place or situation, especially to
draw near to the mountains or hills, whereas it is dry, and far from the sea,
and from all noisome and stinking lakes.

Aromaticum Rosatum does strengthen wonderful much.

The fourth Chapter. Of the half third days Ague, called Hemitritaea.
THis is also a kind of continual ague, ye which is one day slacker than an
other, and appears in ye outward members, at one time with great heat, and
another with great cold; therefore must you have daily care to mark how it
takes one, and what humors there be that do reign most of all in the same
Ague, that there may the better order be taken for redress thereof; like as in
the beginning of the continual agues, and hereafter shall be taught in the
description of the Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartain agues. The mixture of these
agues is of Cholera and Phlegma, for which cause it is joined half with a
tertian, and half with a quartaine ague, whereby grows a continual ague. And
when the Cholera gets the upper hand, then is the tertian the more stronger:
and when there is most of the Phlegma, then is the quartaine the mightiest.

So that when they are both o^ equivalent efficacy, then it is only called
Hemitritaea, that is, when both these humors do work equally, and have their
operations alike.

There is for the heat of these agues given commonly to the patient Barley
water, that is sod with Melon seeds, Gourd seeds, Endive seeds, and such
like. For the cold, is Pepper, Cinnamom, and Annis seed, and the Wormwood much
praised, especially Oxysacchara, be it of whatsoever humor this ague does
proceed.

The fifth Chapter. Of the tertian Ague.
LIke as we have in the former chapt. made mention of the tertian Ague, and
have numbered the same amongst the hot agues (whereof we now do speak) so does
our method now require to add these and all other hot agues unto them.

This ague does alter her self into many kinds of sorts and species, according
as it mingleth it self with other agues, which oftentimes happens.

But if this Ague remain in her own property, then do the learned call it
Exquisitam, and Legitimam, that is as much to say, as neat of it self and
unmingled: and it is such a kind of Ague, wherein the property of the person,
his age, the time of the year, the state of the body, and the whole former
order of diet do agree one with another, and accord with the humor which
causes this Ague. This exquisite tertian ague comes not above seven times,
and it is wholly without peril.

The second sort of this Ague, they term Tertianam Notham, or Spuriam, that is
as much to say, as a bastard tertian Ague, whereof we will speak and declare
hereafter apart. Now to speak of the right nature and property of the tertian
Ague, they are commonly subject unto it which are cold of nature, and of a
middle age, because that in them the Gall most abounds: also in Summer time
when the Cholera reigns, there happen many hot and burning Causenes, whereof
we shall hereafter make mention.

This tertian Ague reigns most in hot dry countries, in hot dry dwellings,
and in hot air. All bodies that do labor sore in the Summer, watch much, live
in great sorrow, are nourished with subtle meats and such like, are most
subject to these sorts of Agues: as also all they that use too much Physic,
they that are hot and dry of nature. And although all species of the tertian
ague (as also the Exquisita) are the very hottest; yet have they nevertheless
with the ague Causone this difference, that the foresaid tertian ague forces
much gall with the blood into the veins, and there inflameth the same.

To be brief, these are called Tertianae exquisitae, for that they come upon
the third day, expelling the Choleram through vomits, going to the stool, and
through sweat.

And whereas none of these foresaid things appear thereby at all, then is it
to be called only Tertiana; for that the same thereby only differs from the
Exquisita.

For when this tertian ague makes appearance which continues many hours, to
wit, the whole space of the tertian Ague, the which remains continually 28.
30. 36. or 40. hours, the same do the learned term Tertianam extensam, that
is, a lengthened or extended tertian Ague.

In like manner they term that Tertianam duplicem, which is mingled with the
quotidian Ague.

Item, Hemitritaeam whereof we have declared before, and many mo that we omit
for brevity sake.

It comes to pass that all Tertians approach with a greater and with a more
trembling cold, and have commonly this nature that they do not continue long,
nor yet (as is also said) keep not their fits above seven times. And if there
be any that gives her occasion by some ill diet yt the same continue any
longer; yet does she always alter her own nature into another ague, the which
may be prevented through good government of life. The occasions of this ague
are partly declared before, to wit, sore labor, or great exercise, and that
chiefly at hot times, long use of things that increase the Choleram, and
inflame the humors, as Garlic, Pepper, and all that is dressed therewith, also
Ginger, and fined strong wine, and such like.

The signs of the very true tertian ague are these, when it does assail you
with great shaking, and cold, which is more violent in this tertian, than in
any other ague.

Afterward the heat follows upon it, a strong swift pulse, and drouth of
the tongue, and of the whole body. The patient feels a pricking over all his
body, as if he were pricked with nails: the urine is red as fire, and you may
perceive the heat by the feeling: there is great disquietnesse with it, and no
sleep at all; yet without any pain in the head, unless it be not an
exquisite tertian, but a mingled ague. Also if there be any great thirst,
madness, and frowardnes with it, there comes a sweat in the end unto it: and
these signs are the more surer, if the patient be young and choleric, in the
Summer time, in a lean body, and that has lived very continently, and is
much inclined to vomit Choleram.

It is first to be considered, that all the common rules that we have before
collected in describing the continual ague, are also very requisite herein, as
these rules following shall further declare.

First, the exquisite Tertian or third days ague that proceeds of red
Cholera, must be well moystened and cooled.

Secondly, for as much as the Cholera is the hotest and dryest humor of the
body: therefore it is requisite that it be expelled which is fallen into the
stomach by vomits: and that which falls down lower, is to be expelled and
purged by going to the stool, be it by potions or clisters.

Thirdly, all moistening meats are very good, except such as putrify quickly
in the body.

Fourthly, the recovery for this and all other putrified agues consists
herein, that all putrified humors must be clean purged out, and the unnatural
heat quenched: for if in the exquisite tertian, the corruption be less than
the heat, then the more diligence ought to be had for to cool the same, than
for to purge the humor.

Fifthly, if the patient be much bound in body, then is he in the beginning to
be opened and loosed with moderate clisters, that the bad humors may be
somewhat expelled and diminished.

Sixthly, because all fruits are hurtful for all agues, therefore they ought to
be forborne.

Seventhly, two or three hours before the ague comes, the patient is to eat
somewhat; and likewise also when the ague is departed.

Eighthly, when by the preparatiue medicines the humor is made to vanish a
little, and to be concocted (which may be perceived by the urine) then is it
high time that the same be purged, and that by that way whither it most
inclines.

Ninthly, if after the assault of the ague, and after the departure thereof
there follows sweat, then must the same be suffered to take his course,
unless that some swouning, or such like accidents are feared.

Tenthly, at the beginning of the ague the patient must shun drinking and
sleeping, to the end that the humor thereby be enclosed in the body, and that
the drinking hinders the vomiting up of the humor.

Eleuenthly, the letting of blood is never good for the third days ague,
before that the patient have had it three or four times.

Twelfthly, there are no Mirobalans to be given to the patient at the beginning
of this ague, because they purge at the first, and afterward bind the body.

Thirteenthly, he ought also to be secluded from Diagridion; for it inflameth.

Fourteenthly, he must not take any sower thing with any thing made of Barley,
for that the one spoileth the other, albeit either of them by themselves are
commodious.

Fifteenthly, Rubarb purges Choleram, but it warmeth somewhat, and leaves a
heat behind; therefore the same is to be taken in the water of Endive.

Sixteenthly, if it be perceived that there do any hot vapors ascend into the
head, they are forthwith to be withdrawn, by a moderate Clister, thereby to
draw them downwards, and to strengthen the head, that it receive not them so
speedily.

And to come to the cure thereof, it is requisite that we make some mention of
such things as are declared in the foresaid rules, which I hope shall never a
whit mislike the reader. This is the opinion of all expert Physicians, and the
nearest way, and above all other (so far as is possible) to cool and moisten
the body; for because this Ague is hot and dry, therefore must it be cured
and corrected with contrary things, to wit, with cold and moist things.

When as the Cholera lights in the mouth of the stomach, then must the same
thorough vomits be expelled: but if it descend, and fall into the bowels, then
must it be purged downward, albeit the nature of an exquisite Tertian be such
that it commonly expels the same of it self, either by sweat, or by urine.
The Cholera is also lightly to be purged downward, and that through a mild
Clister, whereof there be diverse described before in the third Chapter,. 7.

And if so be that need require any stronger, then take of the foresaid
decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, mingled with Benedicta laxatiua, Cassie,
and course Sugar, of each half an ounce, confection of Beuercod two dragmes,
Sal gemmae one dragme, Sallad oil, and oil of Sesamum of each one ounce and a
half, mingle them all together, and exhibit this Clister at least an hour
before meat.

For the provoking of urine, there is a potion to be made, wherein Smallage or
Dill has bin steeped.

If you would use stronger, then look in the third Part, the eighteenth
Chapter, and the first. etc.

When as the humor is purged through Clisters, and is expelled through the
urine, then do some famous Physicians give counsel, that the patient should
open the Saluatella upon the hand, and afterward to purge him with mild and
cooling medicines, as hereafter follows.

Take sower Dates and Cassie, of each a quarter of an ounce, Rubarb one
scruple, Whay of milk three ounces: mingle them together, and drink it, and
fast six hours after it.

Take of the decoction of fruits, called Decoctio fructuum, four ounces,
steep two dragmes of Rubarbe in it all a night; early in the morning wring it
out hard, and mingle therewith two ounces of Manna, one quarter of an ounce of
Diacatholicon, take it fasting: but of the Diacatholicon may you take more or
less, according to the ability of the patient. There are more such like in the
description of the continual ague.

After purging, let him drink five or six days one after another, of this
potion following: take Oxysacchara one ounce, sirupe of Violets half an ounce,
water of Sorrel, and of Cicorie, of each one ounce and a half, and mingle
them together.

But when as you perceive that the corruption begins to be concocted, then
may be given to the sick body without fear the juice of Wormwood, dressed in
this manner: Take the highest sprigs of Wormwood, powne them to pap, and then
strain out the juice: and afterward take every morning hereof a spoonefull,
and fast two hours after it: so do also at nights two hours after supper.
Some use to steep the Wormwood in Melicraton, and drink thereof.

This following is an especial medicine, for the grief in the stomach of
Cholera, to wit, to use often bathing in fresh water, for thereby is the
Cholera wasted, cooled, and moistened, if the same be used twice a day, and he
may remain therein so long as it likes the patient, but it must always be
used with moderation, and at oportune times.

Secondly, he must observe such an order of diet, whereby the Cholera may be
avoided, whereof is sufficient mention made in the description of the Gall and
Stomach.

But briefly to express the meaning of Galen, which is, that in Tertiana
exquisita such government is to be kept, that the patient drink no wine so
long as the disease indureth: but the disease being clean gone, that then wine
is first to be taken watered.

All cold and moist meats are perfect good for this malady, wherewith the
patient may cherish himself as long as he thinks meet, and as his stomach
can digest them.

Amongst all green herbs, these be good: Orage, Blites, Dockes, Mallows,
Lettice and Gourds. Likewise also Barley paps, and all river fish: and amongst
fowls, let those suffice as have soft flesh, and of other the wings only.
Item, all wood fowls, the brains and feet of hogs, rere sod Eggs, and especially
the yolks be better than the whites.

He may use all fruits that are not hard of digestion: but he must forbear at
any hand Honey, Mustard, salt meats, and all hard meats. All this has Galen
left behind and described for a diet in the mixed tertian ague.

Here is to be noted, that at all times the patient shall eat at least four
or five hours before that the ague approaches, that it may find an empty
stomach: and in like manner he shall not eat until two or three hours be
past after it.

The sixth Chapter. Of the counterfeit and bastard Tertian, that is, a false
third days Ague.
THe third days Ague which the Latinists term Notham Spuriam, that is, a
bastard Tertian, is so called, by reason of her due cause which proceeds not
of mere Cholera; and because that the Cholera is mixed with Phlegma, so that
both of them are converted into one kind of humor. And the difference of them
which is between the late described Hemitritaea and this Notha, is that the
first appears in the beginning with two kinds of humors, and the Notha
comes with one only, and has but one kind of putrefaction of two several
humors.

The signs whereby this counterfeit tertian may be known from the exquisite
tertian, are these: First, this Notha (as is aforesaid) is not exquisite, but
mixed. The exquisite tertian comes not above seven times, except the patient
or the Physician have committed an error, whereby it is continued. And the
bastard tertian heateth not the body so greatly, and all the symptoms are not
so vehement as accustometh in all other Agues: for this Ague lasts longer
than twelve hours, and otherwhiles remains two months, specially in old
phlegmatic persons, and that in winter season.

These signs also following do manifest how to know the difference between it
and the right tertian Ague, to wit, that the humor or matter of this Ague
departs not so soon, and abateth not the body so quickly, neither does this
Ague end with such a sweat.

These are the common rules to be observed for this Ague: First, even as this
counterfeit tertian Ague differs from the right tertian Ague, so require they
several kinds of cure. Secondly, as the same is mixed with Cholera and Phlegma,
so must also the medicines that serve for the same, be mingled, and must be
both digestiues and purgers. Thirdly, for that the sirupe of vinegar does
attenuate Phlegma, and does digest Choleram, therefore is the same very
commodious to be used for it. Fourthly, because the same Ague comes not so
speedily to the state or highest, the patient may eat and drink moderatly,
least for want thereof he lose his strength, and may expect the state of the
Ague.

And to speak farther hereof, it appears plainly, that touching these
Agues, the old proverb may be verified, wheremen usually say, the Ague has
three deadly enemies, namely, purging, fasting, and letting of blood: which
three in truth do not only gall these bastard tertians, but also all other
Agues. But in this Ague, whereof we have spoken, which is not so exquisite and
pure as the former, there must be regard taken that the sickness increase not,
lest thereby the sick persons be quite overthrown, because (as aforesaid)
there are two sundry kinds of impediments at hand, it is scarce possible
therein to keep a mean: yet specially is abstinence good, that the more the
same is used, so much the more will the sickness be discussed and spent, but
the same feebleth greatly the strength of the patient: for how much the greater
it is, so much the more does it abate and weaken the patient. But to the
contrary, the more that the patient seedeth, so much the more does the malady
increase, wherefore special care is to be had, that that be always done or
left undone which is most requisite and profitable, so that in strong natures
the abstinence, and in weak good nourishment be prescribed, which not only in
this, but in all other maladies is to be specially observed and kept.

In this counterfeit and mixed tertian Ague, at the first the patient is not to
bath, but only when it begins to abate; and the patient must not have every
day meat to eat, but every other day, and must keep himself quiet, cover
close his breast, and otherwhiles use a Clister.

Item, for purging you must take half an ounce of Cassie, Diaphoenicon two
dragmes and a half, and whay of milk three ounces mingled together. For a
preparatiue of the humor use this potion following: Sirupe of vinegar one
ounce, Syrupum de Eupatorio half an ounce, mingle them together with water of
Sorrel, of Cicorie, and of Fennel, of each one ounce; drink it off in the
morning fasting cold or warm: this is continually to be taken, till his urine
begin to wax paler, and certain small clouds be perceived in the bottom.

Afterward, let him take these things following: Take Cassie prepared with
Cicory water three ounces, Rubarb and Agaricus, of each one scruple, Spica of
Indy, and Ginger, of each four grains, decoction of Melons, Gourds; and
Citruls three ounces, mingle them together with the rest, and so give it him
warm.

There is also to be used for these Agues, letting of blood, and that at the
very beginning. The whole ordinance or government of diet must not be cold nor
moist, as is said of the right Tertian, but must be such that it warm, digest,
and open. It is also very good to dress all his meat with Parsley, Fennel,
and such like things, and his Barley pappes with some Pepper. Item, let him use
Honey water, wherein Hyssop, Marioram, and Spikenard has been steeped or
sodden. Also all things that provoke urine (except such as warm and dry too
fast) are passing good, and likewise Syrupus acetosus compositus. If you desire
mo other things, then look what is before written thereof.

And you must not fail, but to give every seven days once to the patient for
this ague the juice of Wormwood. Oxymel is also passing good, and especially
that which is made of Squils, which opens all obstructions. Some also
accustom to give for these species of Agues, Mithridate or Treacle, according
as the same is over hot or cold. To conclude, vomit after meat is so
requisite for all aguish persons, that thereby only many are freed and helped.

Some will have many things to be used for this Ague, as there be many will give
counsel thereto, when all means and ways have been tried, then take two
ounces and a half of the salve of Poplars, and mingle it with Cobwebs, and so
lay them upon the pulse three hours before the ague comes. Some bind it upon
ye pulse before the Ague comes with Cinquefoile, Item, take a handful of
Eidern leaves, Lauander, and Salt, of each a little, mingle them well together
with Sallad oil, and so lay it upon the pulse, this should also drive away the
Ague.

The seventh Chapter. Of the burning Fever, called Causon.
OF this Ague is rehearsal made amongst other Agues in the first chapter of
the sixth part, that it is (like to the right Tertian Agues) the hottest of all
other Agues, even as we have also said in the fifth Chapter, in which two
places her properties are expressed: for the observation therefore of our
accustomed method, we will here show and rehearse somewhat thereof.

First, this Ague is thus described: Causon, that is, a burning Fever, is a
very forcible and continual Ague, and proceeds of a red Cholera, which
putrifieth and enflameth in the veins near the heart, in the liver, and in
the mouth of stomach, or about any part of the body. The occasions thereof are
sometimes the very hot time, great labor that is done in the heat of the Sun,
hot meats, wrath, inflammation of the liver, and of the blood in the veins,
and other causes more, that are rehearsed in the two places aforementioned.

The signs of the same Ague are a continual heat, and never ceassing
burning, and that rather inwardly than outwardly, with many mo terrible
accidents: also, there is great drought of the tongue, which at the first is
yellowish, and afterward burnt and waxes blackish, with great thirst, without
any sweat (if a Crisis be not at hand) the pulses beat freely, the eyes are
hollow, the appetite fails utterly, and the water or urine in this ague is
flerie, and yellow of color: yea, it chances otherwhiles that hearing,
seeing, and speech is taken away by this Ague, with a great binding of the
body.

In these perilous Agues that commonly make a dispatch of one in four, five
(or at most) in seven days through death or health; these common rules
following are to be observed, and also all those that are herebefore noted in
the third Chapter, and the third.

First, hasten to expel and mitigate the humor.

Secondly, when the urine is yellow, or yellowish, and the pulse slow, then
must you not let blood; for that the Cholera thereby will be the more inflamed,
because the moist blood which delayeth Cholera, might thereby be drawn out.

Thirdly, if the urine be red and thick, and the pulse strong and mighty,
then first of all must you open a vein.

Fourthly, if it do seem that it is good to let blood, then must it be done at
the first: for afterward it is not allowable, lest that thereby great
feebleness, yea death it self be procured.

Fifthly, when the heat is almost past, then are you to give the patient to
eat and drink sparingly; yet in such measure, that the natural strength be
not thereby too much enfeebled: otherwise force the patient (although against
his will) to use cooling meats.

Sixthly, you must also give the patient oftentimes cold water to drink, and
let him suffer no thirst.

Seventhly, when his nose or any other part happen to bleed during his
sickness, then must you speedily staunch the same, that he lose no manner of
strength thereby.

Eighthly, that the hot damps of this Cholera may not ascend into the head; the
same therefore must be cooled with the oil of Roses, Vinegar, Saunders, and
with Rose water. And when as the patient cannot sleep at al, or happens to
fall into any frenzy, the same must be cured with meet things, as may be
found out in the register.

Ninthly, first of all must this Cholera be expelled (be it by vomits or
stools) and seek afterward to cool the great heat, which cannot more
conveniently be done, than that there be sufficient cold water given unto the
patient to drink.

Tenthly, even as before we have expressed, these diseased are commonly much
bound in the belly, which must be prevented the first or second day with mild
clisters.

Eleuenthly, the patient must also have a drink given him wherein Prunes and
sower Dates have been sodden: also heed must be taken that he go twice or
thrice a day to stool.

Twelfthly, the heart must be comforted (which is inflamed with this heat)
with cooling cordial waters without all delay. And these are the common rules
which are to be observed in this burning fever.

Concerning his order of diet, his dwelling place should be cool, airie, and
be sprinkled with water and Vinegar. His head must be set with Vine branches,
Willow boughs, and other cool green things: for the same do cool and altar
the air, that by the lungs is drawn toward the heart, whereby the heat of
the heart is chiefly cooled.

Secondly, even as is expressed in the third rule, if the patients urine be red
and thick, then must his Median or Basilica be opened, and the same day or the
day following must he use these medicines following, thereby to prevent all
terrible accidents of the heart.

Take flowers of Burrage, Buglosse and Violets, of each half an ounce, twenty
or five and twenty Prunes; sees them all together in sufficient water till
the third part be sodden away, then take three or four ounces of this broth,
and put therein Cassie and sour Dates, of each three quarters of an ounce,
Rubarbe steeped in Endive water half a dragme: afterward give it to the
patient early in the morning.

Item, to cool and to prepare the humor, make this sirupe: Take great and
small Endive, Lettice, Purslaine, Agrimony, Liuerwoort, sprigs of Poppie
leaves, and green Maiden hair, of each a handful, Violets, Waterlillies,
Roses, and Lens palustris, of each one ounce, seeds of Lettice, Endive,
Purslaine, and of small Endive, of each a quarter of an ounce: sees them all
together in sufficient water till there be eighteen ounces remaining, then put
as much Sugar thereto, and let it sees again and clarify it: put thereto
E^^iue water, Rose water, and the juice of Pomegranates, of each six ounces,
burnt Iuorie, red and white Saunders, Camfere, and white Poppie seeds, of each
a dragme and a half: then afterward sees them all together unto a sirupe,
give thereof four times in four and twenty hours tempered with Barley or
fountain water.

And when you perceive the next day that the ague is abated, and thereby make
show as though the fourth day it would end; then must you not give the patient
to eat (but as necessity requires, and as the fifth rule shows:) crumbs of
white bread soaked in fountain water are good for him. Likewise Almond milk
is also good for him, if the same be made with Melons or Cucumber seeds. You
may also mingle amongst his drink sirupe of Vinegar, Muscilage of Endive, of
Purslaine, and Melon seeds: and in like manner the sirupe of Poppie heads, and
chiefly of black Poppies. But in case there light upon any young patient any
intolerable thirst, and thereby longs to drink cold water, then must you let
him have it, and that so much as he may drink up at a good draught: and then
afterward if the thirst and heat yet continue with the patient, give it him
once again to drink. But note that old folks have not any such drink.
Secondly, good heed must be taken that none of the principal parts thereby be
damnified: but only let such have it as it is meet for. Thirdly, it must not
be given at all if the ague proceed of any cold humor. Fourthly, it must not
be ministered when the natural strength is much decayed. Fifthly, if there be no
great obstruction at hand. Sixthly, if the sickness be not increasing, but
decreasing. Seventhly, it is not tolerable, unless the thirst and the lust to
drink water be very extreme. Eighthly, if there be any fear of any great
feeblenes, then must you mingle that water with the juice of Pomegranates, or
with Veriuice, Hen broth, wherein Lettice, Purslaine, and Cucumbers are sodden,
is also very meet for him.

Item, raw Butter milk well sugared and with crummed white bread in it, is
marvelous medicinable. But if there come any sweat, then must special care
be had that the patient continue in it, and sweat as long as his strength will
abide it. With the blood must be dealt as is said in the eight rule.

The eight Chapter. Of the Ague which is called Synochus.
AMongst all other continual Agues is this also comprehended, which the Greeks
call Synochus, whereof we have also spoken before in the third cha. that the
same grows through the superfluitte of the blood, being mingled with Cholera.
The learned describe two manner of these agues; whereof the one is provoked of
the blood that is not putrified and the other sort of a putrified and noisome
blood in the veins. The cause of the first ague is, if the party be by nature
sanguine and full of blood, and therewithal uses daily meats that engender
much blood: as namely, good delicate flesh and wine, yolks of eggs, and such
like, little or too much, lack of exercise, vapors of superfluous and over hot
blood, that draws upwards and never finds any issue; because the pores and
all inward passages are obstructed. The signs of this ague are, when the pulse
does beat a like strong and swift, if the heat be not extreme, then may it
best of all be perceived in the palm of the hand: the urine for the most part
is like unto that of healthful persons, yet the same is often red and thick,
and specially in a corpulent body. Herewith may appear also a rednes of the
body, and of the face, with a fullness of the veins, and there is no cold nor
shaking, but a troublesome breathing: otherwhiles they fall into a dead sleep,
as it were into a Lethargus, whereof we have spoken in the first part, the
twelfth Chapter, and tenth. Before that any do fall into this ague, he feels
first a great wearisomnesse over all his body, and an itching of the nose, ach
of the head, and in his sleep he sees many red and bloody fantasies: above
all this the speech is troublesome unto him.

For this bloody ague are described these rules following. First it is the
opinion of all learned Physicians, that all such patients are to be letten
blood even until they begin to fall into a swound. Secondly, if it appear
very waterish and choleric, then must the same be cooled and thickened.
Thirdly, if the same be too gross and too thick, then must the same be mad
subtle and thin. Fourthly, the body must after letting of blood be well
frothed, that the pores may be opened. Fifthly, when as the letting of blood is
neglected (and the patient yet strong enough) then the same is to be done
still, yet at all times with the counsel of a learned Physician. Sixthly, if
the patient will not abide letting of blood, then must alterating, penning, and
expulsive things be used, whereby the superfluous humor and blood may be abated.
Seventhly, the letting of blood and drinking of cold water work and effect so
much, that you need not use any other things. Eighthly this Ague requires
great abstinence, if nature may abide it. Ninthly, when this Ague proceeds of
surfeting in meat, then must the letting of bl^^ not be used before the 2. or
3. day: notwithstanding that the malady is such wherein the opening of a vein
may not be omitted, for that it quickly annoieth; wherefore must the first rule
be forth with applied, by letting him blood in the Median so long til he begin
to swonne. And if the same cannot be effected at one time, then is the same to
be done at sundry times, every time a little. Afterward let the patient use
cooling things, as namely, sirupe of Veriuice, of Purslaine, of Pomegranats,
and of Limons, or of Sorr^ll: much cold water is also to be given to the
patient to drink, yet with such direction as before in the description of the
Ague Causon has been showed.

Let him have bread to eat that is steeped in the juice of Pomegranates or
Veriuice.

Barley water is the most commodious drink that he may drink, and sirupe of
Roses may be mingled amongst it: if he go not to the stool, then make him a
chicken broth wherein Mallows are sodden.

Purge the patient also with sower Dates, with conserve of Prunes, Cassie, or
with Manna, and so proceed with cooling things till the heat be clean
extinguished.

Of the Ague Synochus, with putrified blood.. 1.
THe other sort of this continual Ague is also very strong, proceeding of a
putrifactio^ of the blood. And hereof is a disputation also amongst the
learned: for some say that when as the blood comes for to putrify, that then
it is no longer blood, and therefore this Ague Synochus cannot be engendered of
blood. The causes are the same that are of the other, but that only with the
former there are many inward vapors without any putrefaction of the blood. In
like manner the signs of both these Agues are the same, but that in the first
the heat is greater, and all other symptoms more violent than in this. In
fine, herein do they both agree, that there is never any increasing or abating
of the fit, as may be observed in other continual agues. Now to cure this ague,
the patient must be let blood out of hand, if the stomach be not ouercharged
with meat, and that the age and the strength will permit the same and thereupon
purge, as is taught for the former ague. And if it fall out (as it accustometh
to fall out) that with this ague there were adjoined a feebleness of the
liver, then must these Trociskes following he prepared for it.

Take burnt Iuorie, Dragagant and starch, of each a dragme, seeds of Purslaine
one quarter of an ounce, Licorice one quarter of an ounce and one scruple, make
thereof then Trociskes with Dragagant dissolved in Endive water; they do cool
and comfort the stomach, and also the liver.

Another. Take two scruples of Roses, two scruples and a half of Berberies,
seeds of Melons, Cucumbers, Citruls, Purslaine and burnt Iuory, of each a
scruple, Dragagant, Gum, and Almonds, of each half a scruple, Rubarb, Saffron
and Camfere, of each seven grains; make thereof Trociskes, and minister one
dragme of them at once with Barley water: you may also mix the aforesaid
Trociskes with conserve of Roses, and so use them.

For this are also commodious the losinges Diatrionsantalon, Diatragacanthum
frigidum and that for both sorts of these Agues, because both of them do ask
one and the same kind of remedies.

Of the order of diet.. 2.
BOth of these Agues do require a sparing diet, as Barley pottage, Oaten paps,
Hen broths, wherein Lettice or Veriuice is sodden, and such like. One may also
sees Lentils by pouring out the first broth thereof, and dressing the second
with Parsley and a little vinegar, or juice of Pomegranates. The broth of red
pease with sugar, stewed apples, pears, and fresh Gourds dressed with Almond
milk, are special good. He may also eat otherwhiles Melons, Citruls, Endive,
Lettice and Purslaine. But if the patient be bound in the body, then may you
sees in the Almond milk Spinach, Mercury, and such like: or take conserve of
Prunes, sower Dates, Cassy and Manna, of which you will: also mild Clisters may
be used and taken for this purpose.

And if the patient have great headache, then delay the same with oil of
Roses, vinegar, or with Oxyrrhodino. In like manner may you also use a little
oil of Violets, or oil of water Lillies being dropped into his ears, and to
hold Roses, Camfere, or Saunders before his nose. If the patient cannot take
any sleep or rest, a^ that no lithargy be feared, then is the juice of cold
and moist herbs to be used, and in like manner of small and great Mousleeke, of
Nightshade, Lettice, Purslain, and of Poppie leaves, or Poppie heads, Poplar
salve, and such like, dip a cloth therein, and lay it upon his forehead. The
very best and most usual drink that can be used in this sickness is barley
water; but in great heat you must mingle therewith (as is said) the juice of
Pomegranates or veriuice: Item, cold water with sirupe of Pomegranats, or any
other cooling sirupe. And if there chances any swouning called Cardiaca with
it (whereof we have admonished in the second part, the sixth Chapter) then is the
same to be helped with cooling and fragrant things, even as has bin showed in
the foresaid places, and especially apply this plaster following to the liver,
Take red, white and yellow Saunders, of each three drag. Roses and Barley meal,
of each one ounce, Camfer a quarter of an ounce, make a plaster thereof with
Rose water. If so be that he fall into a great sleep, then must you chafe the
hands and the feet very vehemently with vinegar, pouring the same also upon a
hot stone, that the vapor thereof may ascend into his nose: You must also call
earnestly upon him, pull him by the hair or by the nose, and use such like
things more for the same, as be showed in the first part, the twelft chapter,
and 10.: for whenas these vapors do ascend forcibly into the head, then is the
dead palsy to be expected. Whereas is unquenchable thirst, there must the
water be mingled with vinegar, and hold these losinges following under the
tongue: Take the juice of unripe Grapes, of Sorrel, of Lettice, wine of
Pomegranates, and white vinegar, of each an ounce, put thereto white sugar and
sugarcandy, as much as is thought meet, letting it sees so long together as
shall suffice to make losinges of it. Here is now sufficiently entreated of
this Synocha, and of other hot Agues.

The ninth Chapter. Of the Quotidian Ague, Quotidiana.
THe cause of this daily Ague proceeds of a putrified Phlegma, and slimy
corruption, which nature forces toward the exterior parts of the body, and
there ingendreth such a cold, which may be called rather a shaking than right
cold, wherewith it so burtheneth and suppresseth nature, that thereby the pulses
are faint, and unnatural heat stirred up, and the pulses are found unequal.
Whenas the cold auoideth, then by and by follows the heat, which is shorter
than the cold, continues longer because of her slownesse, and by reason of her
toughness; whereby this Ague comes to her state very slowly, and declineth
very suddenly: so that it happens therein as if one lay green wood upon the
fire, where the moisture withstandeth and suppresseth the heat, and remains
so long without burning till all the moisture be consumed, and then suddenly
burns away as long as there remains any wood.

The occasion of this Ague is outwardly cold and moist air, the long use of
cold and moist meat, as fish, fruit, and such like, and unaccustomed
idleness, to bathe much in sweet waters, and great rioting.

Item, if the body be ouercharged with ouermoyst and slimie humors that
putrify in the body, go out of the veins, and send stinking vapors toward
the heart, whereof an Ague might ensue.

This Ague is also very easily by her signs to be known from the Tertian
Ague, for it begins not by and by after the first day with cold, but
begins by little and little: also the pulse alters not, as it does in the
tertian Ague. The patient complains of no great heat, of no short breathing,
neither of any great thirst. His urine is like unto the urine of such as have
new gotten the quartaine Ague, not knowing of any sweat at the beginning, but
in time does he perceive it: so that these signs are so manifestly differing
from the tertian Ague, that they seem to have no communion at all.

Also, one may perceive by this patient that the heat is somewhat mixed with a
vapor, which appears outwardly: also the pulses of this Ague be much fainter
than the tertian or quartaine agues. The tongue is moist, and he is quickly
provoked to vomit, whereby he casts up much filth: and in like manner is the
going to the privy cold by nature, moist, undigested, waterish, and full of
vapors. The urine is white and thin, and otherwhiles thick and troubled, and
the whole body full of waterish humors. All bodies that live in quiet, are fat
and moist, haunting daily riotousnesse and surfeiting, much bathing in fresh
waters, and such as have their habitations near to moist places, are most of
all subject to this disease. To conclude, this ague long enduring is not
without peril of life.

Now to remedy and cure this Ague the better, you must above all observe these
rules following: First, this patient is to use that which warmeth and
attenuateth the humor.

Secondly, if the patient can hardly cast or vomit, then it is a sign that the
tough phlegm of the stomach must be incided.

Thirdly, you are in the beginning of the Ague to force the patient to vomit,
whereby the matter or humor might partly be abated.

Fourthly, these inciding and attenuating medicines must be used from the
beginning to the very ending of the malady, yet now and then, as the Physician
thinks meet.

Fifthly, all kind of Agues in the beginning do accord with these three things,
to wit, that the nature be brought through easy means to be laxatiue, to
provoke vomit, and moreover to use such things that do incide and attenuate the
matter, and expel urine.

Sixthly, forasmuch as the debilitie of the stomach and of the liver is an
occasion of many filthy humors, therefore need requires that you seek to
comfort and open the same, and also the spleen.

Seventhly, for that this Ague from the beginning till it come to the highest
state, requires much time: therefore you are to consider of the patient
accordingly, and to give him much or little meat.

Eighthly, one must in the beginning of the Ague, and likewise as often also as
it assayleth, keep the patient awake, and that so long til it begin to
decline, that the expulsion of the humors be not thereby hindered.

Ninthly, he is not to be fed so long as the fit of the Ague endures, but a
good space before, and afterward, unless that some debilitie and weakness
require the contrary. And how these Agues are by medicines to be cured, that is
before in the fifth part, the twentieth chapter sufficiently taught and
expressed, whereby every one may govern himself: and especially these pills
here following are to be prepared for these phlegmatic Agues: Take the rinds
of Mirobalani Chebuli, Rubarbe, Cinnamome, Cardamome, and Cloves, of each a
dragme, Aloe three dragmes; beat all these together very small, and with the
juice of Mints, wherein a dragme and a half of Agaricus is steeped: then make
pills thereof, and every morning and evening take half a drag. at once.

You are also to receive a potion that is described in the third part, the
twelfth chapter, beginning thus, Take Gentian, etc.

You are generally at the first to use always for these Agues Oxymel, and
other things more that provoke urine, as has been taught in the third part, the
eighteenth chapter.

This patient is also to use none other meat than such as does separate the
tough phlegm, and expels it. In like manner when the Ague is at the state,
then must care be had for the mouth of the stomach, like as there are therefore
diverse medicines ordained in the description of the stomach in the third part,
the eleventh chapter. Vomiting is for these Agues passing good, for thereby
will many slimie humors be expelled: And how to provoke vomit, you may search
and find in the first Register.

The tenth Chapter. Of the Quartaine Ague, Quartana.
WHen as these Quartaine Agues are mixed with other Agues, then has she her
beginning of Melancholy, as the Quotidian Ague of Phlegma. And because the
black melancholicke blood has his residence in the Milt, it will commonly be
felt in the same place at the beginning. This ague is (as her cause is) cold
and dry. Albeit the same humors are very gross, cold, and heavy, yet does
their cold nature not appear forthwith, to wit, in the beginning, or the first
day, but by little and little, as it ingendreth: so that the cold (when the
Ague is at the highest) does not otherwise show it self, than it does unto
such as are stiffened by extreme cold in the hard winter: and it is to be
likened by a stone, muskle, or bone, which lying in the fire and being hot, you
cannot well know the heat till you feel it.

So fares it also with melancholicke humors, when they happen to kindle, then
remains there no moisture till they be clean burnt: and therefore are they
the longer before they kindle than any other, for that (as is said) the
corruption comes to kindle by little and little.

By the foresaid occasions it comes to pass also that the pulse beats very
slow, faint and longsome, yea in young folks so very faint, that they may be
likened to old folks: for as this Ague begins to increase and attain to
the highest, then will the pulse be the more swifter and forcible, yet not so
strong as it is in the Tertian Ague, whereof we will further write and make
mention.

The causes of this quartaine Ague are (even as abouesaid) first the
melancholic blood, time of the harvest, and after that the winter, for that at
these seasons these humors are not only stirred, but also augmented more
vehement and durable, so that otherwhile they endure until winter; whereas to
the contrary the same are shorter in Summer, and the rather, if the nature of
the country be inclined that way; and the time of the year otherwhiles is
such, that it ingendreth foul blood, whereby then such and other Agues are
caused. Wherefore good heed must be taken to all these foresaid things: and in
like manner whether the patient be not of a melancholicke nature, and has not
used before to eat such kinds of meats, whereof this melancholicke blood is
engendered or increased, as bread of Millet, Lentiles, Beans, Chestnuts, salt
cheese, salt fish, Beef, Hares, Hearts, Cabbages, and such like. Item, all
other things that inflame the blood, as Garlic, Cresses, pepper, Mustard,
strong and spiced wines, burnt wine, and all kinds of hot spice or fruits; but
especially great labor, travel in the heat of the Sun, long anger, great
sorrow, and long former Agues, whereby the blood and other humors are burnt and
putrified, and are altered by the great heat into Melancholiam before they be
expelled, whereof you have further instruction in the description of
Melancholy, and of the stomach.

Item, have special care whether the Milt of the patient be not swollen, or
have any other infirmity. Or whether the patient have before had no erratick
Ague, for that the quartaine Ague never comes alone, but commonly always
after another Ague.

You must always mark well, whether the urine be white, thin, and waterish; in
these things, as also in the pulse and cold does it altogether differ from the
tertian, but regard not you the vomiting of the gall, for that is the only
nature of the tertian ague: but if you find by the motion of the pulse or
otherwise, after that the Ague is gone, or if there be any signs of the ague,
then is there no doubt at all but that it is a quartaine ague.

Now to cure this Ague, we will first of all show you certain rules: and for
the first, if the pulse be forcible, and beats swiftly, the water be red and
gross, the patient be young and full of blood, then shall you not omit, but
open the Basilica or Milt vein on the left hand: but if the blood be red and
clear, then stop it again; but if it be thick and black, then let it run,
and that so long as the parties strength be able to bear it. Secondly, if so
be that the patient have not much blood, let him then not bleed at all.
Thirdly, you must not give to any that is taken with the Ague any strong
purgation at the first, by reason that all melancholicke humors are very tough
and gross, and the same may not be purged in the beginning, but mild
purgations must be used, and gentle Clisters. Fourthly, all meats and drinks
that are prepared daily for the patient, shall be laxatiue, that he may always
have some vacuation. Fifthly, against such time as the Ague approaches, the
patient must at any hand refrain food, that nature thereby may work the
better on the matter of the Ague, also the easier expel and withstand it.
Sixthly, he may not bathe until the Ague begin to decrease. Seventhly, he must
forbear all fruits, by reason of their gross moisture that lightly does
putrify, and may provoke obstructions. Eighthly, these patients must take heed
of the cold air, and settle themselves in temperate dwellings. Ninthly, they
that have any obstruction in their veins, are to use such meats and drinks
that warm and moisten. Tenthly, because that this humor is compact, and the
state thereof a great while after it begins, the patient is not to be kept
ouersparingly, but let him be cherished with meat, that he may retain his
force and strength, and expect the statum of the disease. Eleuenthly, for this
kind of sickness you must not give him any ouerhot and dry things, for fear
that the ague be not thereby doubled, prolonged, and altered into a continual
ague. Twelftly, you are not to use ouercold remedies, because they do thicken
and harden the matter, wherefore ^uld means are always to be used and taken.

Out of these foresaid rules it is easily to be understood, that no strong
medicines are to be used in the beginning of this Ague, except one see that
there is great store of blood at hand, at which time the Median may be opened
in the right arm.

Also if the blood be black and thick, as it happens to be of such that
have a diseased spleen, then may one let it run the longer; but if it be red
and clean, then must it be presently stopped.

The ordinance and government of his life must be such, that he feed not upon
any thing that provoke or breeds wind, but use all meats that engender
good blood, and keep the body open and soluble: and if any defect be hereof,
then must a mild clister be ministered. Also, he shall forbear swines flesh,
and all meats that are slimie and hard of digestion, and of all that which
might make the body cold and dry.

His drink must be thin white wine, his meat all manner of field fowls, but no
water fowls, fish of light-digestion, and not slimie, salt meats and mustard
may he also use. Also he may sometimes use the confection Diatrion pipereon or
Diaspoliticon: and although the patient did drink eeuery day a little pepper
with water, it were not amiss. This patient shall not wholly forbear from
riding, from walking, and from baths, if he has been accustomed to it, yet is
the bath not very good for him.

If this quartaine ague be not very strong, nor yet continue long, then can it
not hurt, if the patient upon his free days do execute his affairs and
business. But about the time as is supposed that the Ague is come to the
highest state, then must the patient feed very moderatly, yea more sparingly
than ever before, keeping himself very quiet, and anoint the belly with such
things as may keep the body open and soluble: and also use such things as
provoke urine, whereof you shall find good instruction at due time and place.

And as soon as one perceives that the humors begin to avoid, then are those
things to be used that expel melancholy, and that not once, but as often as
need shall require.

Also to provoke him to vomit, and that after meat, and (if need be) let him
take a little black Hellebore therewith to ease and further the vomiting.

But they that cannot vomit must be purged; Treacle is also passing good for
them: yet it is to be noted, that none of these foresaid things may be used
before the sickness be at the highest, for thereby might of a single quartaine
ague be made a double; and lastly of a double quartaine a three double ague.

Galen writes (out of whom this counsel is gathered) that he knew a
Physician, who (before the quartaine was at the highest) gave his patient
Treacle, whereby the same ague so increased that he died thereof.

When as this order has been observed in this ague, then do the later
Physicians teach that these things following are very fit to be used.

Take Ginger one ounce, cut it small, and then sees it in red wine until
there remain five ounces, then mingle therewith one ounce and a half of Iulep
of Violets, and so drink it, to wit, two hours before the Ague comes upon
you, and the same will make you sweat thoroughly.

Item, take an ounce of the juice of Plantaine two hours before the fit of the
Ague approaches, it will remove the Ague. The water of Carduus Benedictus, or
the herb sod in Wine and drunken, cures the Ague. The common people take the
powder of this herb and strew it upon a shine or twain of bread that is soked
in burnt wine or Aqua vitae, and so eat the bread before the ^^ue come. Oxymel
scilliticum compositum opens all obstructions in the quartaine and tertian
Agues.

Some commend the wine of Asarabacca roots, for this root has the nature of
the Hellebore, it dries all inward parts, and provoke urine, and will
therefore also expel the Ague. The like virtues are ascribed to the wines of
Hearts tongue, of Hyssope, and of Tamariscus. The sirupe of Oxysacchara is also
passing good.

The eleventh Chapter. Of the Consumption or Ethicke Hectica.
THis is one of the most perilous Agues that may light upon a man, for by her
hot and dry operation she dries up all natural moisture of man's body. This
Hectica is not satisfied with the hurt that it does to all natural moisture
and vital spirits, but it dries also all nourishing parts, and all the flesh
of the whole body, yea the marrow of the bones also, so that it may duly and
rightly be called the consuming Ague.

This destroying heat begins first in the heart of the Ague, which is
termed Causon, that is, the burning Fever, whereof we have written in the
seventh Chapter, which continues there so long until it consume the very sap
and moisture of the heart. And albeit that it does not consume and waste all
the moisture of the heart, yet does it burn and spoil the same. For it fares
with the heart as with a wicke in a lamp, that at the beginning does burn
bright and clear; but the longer that it burns, the harder, and the more
burnt, the drier it waxes, where by a little and a little it loses light and
extinguisheth: and albeit more oil be poured unto it, yet burns it not then
the brighter, but the flame remains small and slack, and the longer that it
burns the darker it is, till at the last all of it goes clean out of it
self. So fares it also with this Hectica, with or without an Ague, as
plainly may appear in very old men, which are commonly said to die like a
lamp or candle. This is to be noted also in children, that sometimes also use
to abate and fall away.

This Consumption, namely that which is without an Ague, is called of the
Greeks Marasmodes, that is, a Consumption; and of the Latinists Senectus, that
is, old age, whereby we may call it the infection of the heart, whereof we have
spoken in the second part, the sixth Chapter and ninth. In like manner in the
description of the Consumption, in the fifth Chapter, and 22..

When this Hectica spreads her self over all the whole body, drying it
altogether up, then is it (as we have already told) called Marasmodes.

This sickness is incurable, and above all men's help, for that the natural
heat would quickly like a tree (through very great age, or in them that lie
about the fire) through extreme heat be dried away.

The causes of this Hectica, are all outward things, which do heat the parts
of the body, whereby many Agues might be provoked, whence at the last this
consumption is sounded and springs.

Item, the hunger and thirst, if they be not remedied betimes, the which for
the most part happens to choleric and lean men, who falling into a
quotidian Ague, are thereby lightly turned into a burning, and lastly into this
Ague Hectica.

Item, the perishing of the lights may very well be a cause of this Hectica,
whereby is hindered that the fresh air may not cool the heart sufficiently:
and there be other more occasions, whereby the heart may be inflamed.

We will now admonish somewhat of her signs. They that fall into Tabem. that
is, into a consumption, are easily to be discerned; for before that one come to
feel their pulses, one may see how their eyes be sunk and fallen into their
heads.

The apples of their eyes will be dry in this agony and wrinkled, and the
flesh round about the eyes fallen away, so that one may otherwhiles almost see
the bones of their brows.

It seems also otherwhiles, that these diseased persons face is so bedusted
with dry dust, as it is in them that have gone the whole day through the dust
in the heat of the Sun. Also the lively ruddinesse and color over all the
whole body is vanished and gone: and likewise the skin of their forehead so
hardened and shrunk, that they seem to close their eyelids very badly; and
sleeping, they lie with their eyes half open, which can be no due sleep, but
rather an ouergreat watching, and the flesh in the temples of the head does so
wast away, that there seems to be a great hollownesse. To conclude, there
remains no more than the very skin and the bones, so that when one sees them
naked, he would judge none other than that the carcass were covered with a
dry skin, and that all the intrailes are taken out, or lie hid in the breast:
and when as one touches the skin and plucketh it hard, then shall he find it
through dry, and it seems that by plucking it will follow. These sick
persons have a hard pulse, and at the first touching of them does one perceive
small heat, but when you hold your hand long upon them, then may you feel the
heat under your hand increase, and diverse such like signs more.

Of this malady Hectica and Tabes is a great disputation, whereof here we will
not make many words, but will commend that matter to the learned: yet
nevertheless before we come to the cure, we will briefly admonish thus much,
that such as be of a moist nature in the beginning of the consumption, are not
assailed with this Ague Hectica, but they only that be dry of nature, and
somewhat hot, and therewith do great labor, watch much, and live in
carfulness, whereby their natural moisture is wasted and spent, these
presently are taken with this Ague Hectica, and specially such as chafe much,
live in extreme sorrow, or frequent great heat. And although this sickness
when it has long endured, and is once rooted into the body, be thought
incurable, yet nevertheless men must not disdain the help and means which
God the Lord has ordained for the use of man, but pray heartily unto him that
he will bless them for the glory of his holy name.

Wherefore these rules following are to be observed and imitated, for thereby
may be gathered a perfect cure of this sickness. First, it is needful for the
languishing persons that they use all things that may moysten and cool.
Secondly, because these diseased persons must neither be purged nor warmed,
therefore the warm bath is also hurtful, for thereby the heat is increased.
Thirdly, al their meat and drink must be cooling and moistning, or at the
leastwise temperate, as barley pap, Ptisana, henbroth, and Panada. Fourthly, the
curing of this Hectica is like to that in the drouth of the stomach, whereof
we have written in the third part, the second Chapter, and seventh. yet are
cooling things hereto required, by reason of the great heat of the Ague.
Fifthly, if need require that other meats are to be ministered unto him which
are not cooling, as namely Wine and fresh broth, yet nevertheless therewith
are cooling things to be used. Sixthly, if the Ague proceed of any impostume
or bruise of some other part, then must special regard he had for the healing
thereof, and that the liver be cooled and brought in good course. Seventhly, a
good cool air is one of the principal helps, and therewith fresh linen
also that is washed in water, where Roses, Willow leaves, or Trocisci de
Camphora be steeped. In like manner Rosewater is very commodious for it.
Eighthly, the smell of Campher, Rose water, fresh Poppie heads, Roses, Saunders,
and such like, is very requisite and profitable for this patient. Ninthly, all
cooling plasters (wherein no astringent things are intermingled) are to be
laid on his breast. Tenthly, if this diseased person desire to have health then
must he (so far as is possible) incline himself to sleep, and to all
quietness and rest, and keep himself from thirst, hunger, pensiveness,
anger, hatred and much sorrow. Eleuenthly, he must not sleep upon any thing
but a mattresse. Twelftly, it is also marvelous good for this sickness to
sleep by the noise and rushing of waters, or by springing fountains. It is
very good to hang up all green things about his bed, or to sprinkle his
chamber with the water wherein such herbs are or shall be sodden.
Thirteenthly, Goats milk or Asses milk, whereof that is best of them that
are fed in a meadow where cool herbs grow, is a most sovereign medicine for
this malady. Fourteenthly women's milk surpasses all other milkes.
Fifteenthly, buttermilke is likewise very good for this sickness. Sixteenthly,
to conclude, for consumptions are all manner of milkes from the beginning to
the ending thereof very excellent good; and all good fresh henbroth sodden with
Lettice, Purslaine and veriuice, is exceeding profitable for the patient.

But above all things, special care is to be had that he observe and keep a
good diet, wherefore he is to eat and drink but little, using always such
meats as do nourish well, to wit, Fesants, Partridges, young Quails, and such
like, as hens flesh, Veale, Mutton and Lambs broth, etc. wherein Lettice,
Purslaine, and such like cooling herbs are sodden.

And as we have declared before, let him use always Goats milk or Asses
milk, and above al, woman's milk: for all these are so highly commended for
this disease, that it is not possible to tell of any thing that may exceed
them, to help and cure this malady. For if he use any of these, or any other
good milk, yet in such measure that he be not cloyed by taking too much
thereof at once, but to take it the oftener, and namely, betimes in the morning
meetly warm, or when it is new milked, and that about two ounces thereof at
once, and then afterward in the day time four times more, about three or
four ounces at once, so that five draughts be taken within 24. hours.

His meat must be (as is said) Barley pap that is dressed with fresh broth, and
pap of starch, or that is made with grated bread, and wherein also one of the
foresaid herbs are sodden, sometimes one of them, and sometime another. Pease
broth wherein hens or any other thing is sodden, or of it self, is passing
good.

The very best drink for this disease is Barley water wherein sugar pennets is
dissolved: and to retain the patients strength, you are to permit unto him
thin white Wine, that which is very clear, being mingled with fair water,
when he sits at meat: but the mealtide being past, let him drink nothing
but barley water.

They that are quelled with this malady, have for the most part always a very
dry mouth, dry tongue, and great thirst, whereto prepare these confections
following, and hold them in his mouth to refresh the same therewith: Take the
seeds of Fleawort and Quince kernels, of each three ounces, steep them seven
or eight hours together in lukewarm water, press out the muscilage, put
thereto afterward the juice of Pomegranates two ounces, sugarcandie one ounce
and a half, starch as much as is meet for to make it in form of a
confection. If you will have it to drink after the manner of a Iulep, then
leave out the starch, and put thereto the water of Purslaine and of Citruls, of
each eight ounces, and so let it sees a little together; and lastly clarify
it with the white of an egg. If one hold green Lettice or Purslaine in his
mouth, that refreshes it much.

You have also in the third part, the twefth chapter and tenth. and afterward
in the seventeenth chapter and 7.. very many things which are all good against
the thirst, where you may have choice of that which is best for this malady.

These cooling and comfortable medicines following are to be daily used for
refreshing and comforting, namely, conserues of Roses, conserues of
waterlillies, and the sirupes of them both, conserues of Cicorie. In like manner
also the roots of the same in a sallad or confected, are very meet for it.

The confected Citrons, and the juice thereof; the juice and sirupe of Orenges,
conserues of white Roses, and all that is made thereof, is for this purpose
highly commended, for they cool more than red Roses.

Secondly, the kidneyes and backbone are also through this malady very much
tormented, with a great heat; whereto is very commodious the salve of Roses,
wherewith he must be anointed six or seven times in 24. hours. Also it is
very good to moisten the backbone often with milk, and also to anoint it with
oil of Roses or with oil of Violets.

Thirdly, there happens otherwhiles to this patient (that is feeble already)
a sore sweat, which may cast the patient altogether down, which may by the
foresaid means be hindered. But if that will not help, then besprinkle the
face and the whole body often with this water following: Take twelve ounces of
Rose water, one quarter of an ounce of Camfere, Pu^slaine seeds and red
Saunders, of each a dragme, one quarter of an ounce of starch, mingle them all
together.

This drink following is also highly commended: Take six or seven river
Crabs, lay them in a quart of water, then cast therein a hanfull of ashes, and
let them stand four hours long; afterward rub then well therewith, and wash
them clean with fair water three or four times, and so sees them; and take
the tails of them, cut them very small, and sees them again with a quart of
barley water till they be almost consumed, then strain the broth through a
cloth, and give thereof three or four ounces every time to the patient to
drink when you will. But if you will have this water to cool more and nourish
less, then sees the Crabs whole and uncut, and not so long time as is
aforesaid.

After this manner may you also dress a Tortoyse that lives in fresh water,
and is excellent good for this disease.

The small fishes that are taken in fresh waters, are very commodious for this
disease, if they be taken without spice.

In the description of the consumption Phthisis, in the second part, the fifth
chapter, and 22.. are many kinds of remedies prescribed for this Hectica, and
afterward also in the sixth chapter of the panting of the heart through heat
are diverse cullises described that are very good and profitable to be drunken.

You may also prepare these confections following for the same: take of the
white flesh of a young Hen or capon six ounces, starch one ounce and a half,
new oil of sweet Almonds six ounces, five whites of new laid eggs; let the
oil, starch, and eggs sees together on a soft fire until it be thick,
afterward mingle the flesh of a Capon being chopped small amongst them, and make
cakes thereof, whereof the patient may use a little at each time, and as often
as him pleases, which also is as good as if he took much at once, seldom,
and better. Or prepare this following: take white Poppie seeds, peeled seeds
of Melons, Citruls, Cucumbers, and of Pompeons, of each a quarter of an ounce,
Almonds, Hasell nuts, Pistacies (all of them shaled) and Sebestes, of each
three dragmes, Pingles that have bin steeped 24. hours before in Rose water
five dragmes, conserues of Burrage, Buglosse, and Species Diarrhodon Abbatis,
of each one quarter of an ounce, conserve of Roses five dragmes, Manus Christi
with pearls and sugar pennets, of each half an ounce, roasted Capons flesh two
ounces, white flesh of Hens that is stuffed and dressed with Buglosse, Baulme,
Burrage and Endive, three ounces, cut both of these small, and then mingle
therewith Species Diambra and de Gemmis, of each half a dragme, Doronicum,
Saffron, Cinnamom, Roses, and red Coral, of each five dragmes, Species
Diatriasantalon, and grains, prepared pearls a quarter of an ounce, sugar
sodden as thick as honey, as much as need requires for to make a confection,
mingle them well, and use it as aforesaid, one quarter of an ounce at once.

There is also usually made for this a confection of oil of sweet Almonds,
starch and sugar. The preserved Gourds are also wonderful good against this
unnatural heat.

Of the Ague Hectica, with a pain in the breast Empyema and Phthisis.. 1.
IN this compounded Ague, which is placed amongst the Putridas or putrified
Agues, there does appear besides the former signs, cold, and a very stiffness
of cold, which comes at uncertain times, sometimes by day and otherwhiles by
night, and that always unsteadfast, which happens by the diversity of the
humors, whereof now the one and then the other is stirred up and inflamed. The
corruption which is gathered together in the breast, out of the head, or out of
the veins, does chiefly cause this consumption, which lies there putrified
and mingled with the blood; i^ cast out and expelled: and albeit that this kind
of consumption and also the former be incurable, yet you must be marvelous
diligent by these means following to accomplish health is far as it is
possible.

First therefore you must refrain and shun all things that are sharp and
salt, as Mustard, Radishes, Onions, Garlic, and such like.

Item, all flatulent and windy things, and all that is cold by nature and hard
of digestion, as vnsodden milk, porredge of pease or beans, unleavened and
dough baked bread, Veriuice and Limons, etc.

His drink must be good common clear Beer, or any thin red sweet Wine, but
he must refrain from strong wine and beer: but if he cannot bear wine nor
beer, then give him to drink good sugared Barley water.

Young lambs flesh, young swine, Muttons of a year old, and calves, are very
wholesome meat for him. Also Larkes, wood fowls, Partridges, Fesants, and
Hares; and specially river Crabs sod in barley water or milk, are passing good.

Coleworts sodden, stewed Barley dressed with starch, Calves feet sodden in
vinegar, the lights of all beasts, but chiefly of Foxes and Hogs, rere sodden
eggs, or the same dressed with other meat, fresh butter and cheese but little
salted, milk pap, three or four dry figs eaten before meals, and sweet
Pomegranates roasted in the warm ashes, are all of them much nourishing. After
meat let him also eat three or four roasted Hasell nuts, and Saffron and
Cinnamome in his meat measurably.

These confections following are also most commodious for him: Take white
Poppie seeds an ounce, roasted flesh of a Capon four ounces, starch three
quarters of an ounce, prepared Pingles four ounces, peeled Almonds three
ounces, Roses three dragmes, yellow Saunders and Mace, of each a quarter of an
ounce, Cinnamome three quarters of an ounce, Cloves half an ounces, Lignum
Aloes two dragmes and a half, Nutmegs a dragme, Amber two scruples, Musk six
grains, fresh oil of sweet Almonds four ounces, sugar which is sodden with
Rose water and Baulme water, as much as need requires for a confection;
mingle all these well together beaten and shread small: take thereof every
morning and evening half an ounce every time before meat.

And when as this disease falls out of the head into the breast, and that
this Ague Hectica has from thence her beginning, then must special care be had
for to comfort the brains, which may thus be compassed. First, let the head be
shorn bald, and then upon the naked shorn head lay this plaster following:
Take Laudanum a dragme and a half, Rosin and red Storax, of each three
quarters of an ounce, Masticke, Roses and white Coral, of each half a dragme,
Sandaraca a dragme and a half, Mace two scruples, Cloves one scruple; dissolve
the gum and rosin in vinegar that is not too eager, then mingle it all together
with molten wax, and make thereof two round plasters, which you may lay
thereon, now one and then another.

Secondly, take a little piece of Masticke, chew the same once a day at the
least a long time, and then spet out the moisture, and about the third evening
let him always after meat swallow a piece of Masticke.

Thirdly, the fifth night when he goes to bed let him take a dragme and a half
of this confection following: Take of the confection Diapapauer half an ounce,
Frankincense and Sandaraca, of each eight grains, and mingle them all together.

Fourthly, take of the confection of Loch de Pino, and de Papauere, of each an
ounce, prepared Fox lights one quarter of an ounce, Ireas two scruples,
flowers of Centorie half a scruple, make a confection thereof with Vine cuict,
whereof the patient is to take every morning two or three dragmes, and likewise
at night as much more, to wit, two hours after meat. Also you may drink it
mingled with warm barley water, or with sweet wine, and so drink it. Also the
patient may take of this confection into his mouth, and so swallow it up
oftentimes.

Fifthly, take two ounces of Currants, a dragme of sliced Licorice, Hyssope and
Horehound, of each two scruples, yellow seeds of Roses two dragmes, prepared
Fox lights one dragme and a half, Dragagant and Gum, of each a dragme, melt
the gum in Vine cuict, half a scruple of Saffron, white pepper five grains,
and white sugar thrice as much as all the rest do weigh, make it to powder,
whereof let him eat a spoonefull after dinner and supper.

Sixthly, when as the patient has used ten days long the foresaid three
things, then let him take these things following other ten days: Take
distilled Colewort water two ounces, water of blew Flower deluce flowers, and
of Horehound, of each half an ounce, poudered Elecampane roots and Mouse ear
that grows on the mountains, of each a scruple, which the patient must take
luke warm early in the morning, and fast four hours after it.

Seventhly, take Knotgrasse, Mouse ear, Roses, red Coral, Bloodstone, and
yellow Amber, of each one scruple, Dragagant half a scruple, Honey of Violets,
and Sugar pennets, of each three quarters of an ounce: afterward sees the
Honey and Sugar till it be thick, and then mingle them with it, and take
thereof an hour before supper a spoonefull, and again as much more at
midnight.

Eighthly (this being done) you must use this confection following: Take fresh
roots of blew Flowerdeluce one ounce, fresh Elecampane roots half an ounce,
Comfrey, Daisies, juice of Sloes, Dragagant and Gum, of each a scruple,
Frankincense, Masticke, and Sarcocolla (prepared with woman's milk) of each
half a dragme, Bloodstone, yellow Amber, Dragon blood, prepared Fox lights,
Centorie flowers, Myrtle seed, Knotgrasse, Mouse ear and Brionie, of each two
scruples, dissolve all the Gums in the muscilage or slime of Sebestes that were
steeped in warm Honey water, let them sees therein, scumming it always: and
when it is sod to pappe, to wit, the herbs and the roots, then strain out
the juice through a cloth, and put thereto two ounces of sweet wine, Currants
half an ounce, and ten or twelve Dates; powne all the same very small, and
mingle then the Gums with the rest of the foresaid things: Also half a dragme
of Saffron, powdered Saxifrage a dragme and half, whereof give the patient a
spoonefull in the morning, and half an hour before both his mealetides half
as much, and let him swallow it down by little and little. This cleanses the
breast, ingendreth flesh, and withal damnifieth not the breath.

Ninthly, when the patient has used this confection four days long, then let
him take nine of these pills following, to wit, in the morning betimes three,
and three more before noone, and also before supper other three more. This must
he continue four days together or longer, even as the cause requires. Take
Lungwort, Knotgrasse, Comfrey, Daisies, of each a dragme, Saffron, Licorice,
Saxifrage, of each one scruple, Starch, sealed earth, prepared Tutie, and
Dragagant, of each two scruples, make pills thereof with the juice of Comfrey,
and form eight to a dragme.

Tenthly, if occasion serve that the heart must also be strengthened, and to
quench and refresh all drouth, and to cool and moisten all heat, for which
you shall take new conserues of Roses two ounces, conserues of Buglosse one
ounce, burnt Iuorie, Roses, seeds of Endive, of Purslain and Lettice, of each a
dragme and a half, peeled Melon seed, Pompeon seed, Gourds seeds, and peeled
Cucumber seeds, of each five dragmes, sugar pennets two ounces, starch one
ounce, prepared crabs tails (as in this chapter not long ago is taught) four
ounces, powne all very small, and mingled into a confection, then when he has
used the pills, let him take a spoonefull thereof, and that in the morning
early, and likewise again an hour and a half before both mealtides, and
after them half as much.

Last of al, this patient must lay this small bag upon his left breast: Take
Violets, waterlillies, burnt Iuorie, Roses, red and white Coral, Hearts bones,
and Doronicum, of each a dragme and a half, the Iacinth stone, the Smaragde
stone, and Sapphire stone, of each half a scruple pearls a dragme and a half,
three leaves of beaten gold, and Mace one dragme and a half, saffron a a
scruple, Cardamome and Galingall, of each five grains, powne each alone, and
then mingle them all together, and lastly make it into a silken cushion or
little bag.

But if you covet to have the brains strengthened, then look in the beginning
of the first part for the pain of the head, and after that where the brains
are described.

The twelfth Chapter. Of the Ague Marasmode.
OF this Ague and of the nature thereof we have in the former described Hectica
made a plain demonstration. This is of some taken for to be a second Hectica.

In fine, they are both such kind of Agues, that there is small help of man to
be had against them.

This properly is that which the Physicians call Senectam, that is, the old age,
to wit, a consuming of the whole body. The causes of this is, that the heat
and the drouth get the mastery, which might be caused when one is fasting and
has a cold stomach: In like manner also when one is ouerheated, and
straightway drinks cold water upon it: Also the hot air and the heat of the
time may well provoke and raise that which wastes, dries up, and oftentimes
expels the natural heat, whereby the body is sustained, whereof the cold
and drouth do follow.

Moreover, this sickness may be caused of the debilitie of natural heat
which cannot nourish the whole body: and in like manner of cold vapors that
ascend toward the heart and ouer-coole the same. Likewise of all cold causes
that lie hidden in the body, as may be seen by very old folks.

These are signs of this malady that it is without any Ague, but with a slow
pulse, with an extenuation of the whole body, without heat, and in feeling may
a general cold be perceived: the urine is thin, white and waterish.

In fine, there are no other signs to be found than age, as are to be seen in
very old folks.

Now to come to the remedies of this kind of consumption, this patient shall
use as near as he may, all warm and moist things. He must often bathe
himself in fresh warm water, and use many moystening clisters, as the broth
of Lambs heads, of tripes, of Hens, and the like: for these are very
commodious for him because they moisten the bowels, and refresh and nourish the
liver.

But you must put hereto neither salt nor any spice, that they be not too
sharp, and may be held in the longer. You must also take for this Clister not
above six ounces of broth at once, but in four and twenty hours you are to
minister three or four.

Also the rubbing or bathing of the external parts after meals is greatly
commended: and as Honey in the Ague Hectica is very hurtful; so is it in this
disease Marasmode very commodious. Further, all light meats are passing good
for him that are not slimie, as fresh broth, rear eggs, with a thin and
pleasant wine being measurably used, and such like.

Item, all the salues, plasters, and other things which are prescribed for the
Fever Hectica, may also be used in this sickness.

But for these diseases special heed is to be taken of cold, and of all things
as in any way consume the radical humiditie.

Those that will have any further declaration of this infirmity, let them read
that which has been said in the description of the consumption or fever
Hectica.

The thirteenth Chapter. Of the long lingering Agues.
THe long continuing of Agues depends upon three kinds of causes.

First, when any one has an outward sore which hardly will be cured.

Secondly, if the patient or the Physician ever mistake, or keeps some bad
order.

Thirdly, this is also procured by some outward occasion, as by the time of the
year, by continual rain, by the nature of the country, by the vnhailnesse
of the dwelling place, by great care and troubles of mind.

But when it is known that there are none of these foresaid occasions, then
must it of necessity depend on the fourth cause, that is on a gross, tough
and slimie humor. If therefore you will have remedy against the continuing of
Agues, then must you cure and take away the foresaid causes with their
contraries. For that these long continuing Agues are commonly caused by an
obstruction of the liver, whereto these things following are principally good,
to wit, sirupus Diarrhodon, de Cichorio, de Lupulis, de Eupatorio, de capillo
Veneris, Oxymel compositum, de Bysantijs, de Radicibus. Item, the decoction of
Adiantum, Hearts tongue, Agrimony, Wormwood, Endive, Cicorie, of all, or of some
of them. The common pestilentiall pills, called Ruffi, and Rubarbe, Cassie,
Hiera picra, conserve of Prunes, Agaricus, and sirupe of Roses laxatiue, are
also excellent good.

Item, you must boil also Parsley roots with your meat: the wine shall be
mingled with water wherein Cinnamome, Annis seed, Coriander, and Fennel roots
are sodden.

You must anoint the liver with the salve that is described in the third part,
the twelft chapter and third. beginning thus, Take oil of bitter Almonds, etc.
in which place you shall find many more other remedies against the obstruction
of the liver through heat and cold. For the liver being deopilated and opened,
then will the long lingering Ague be easily mitigated.

The fourteenth Chapter. Of swellings that follow after the Ague.
IT comes oftentimes to pass that some have their feet swollen after the
long continuing of an Ague, then use a bath to sweat in, and take one ounce of
the distilled water of Cammomill flowers which has been drawn only out of
the yellow seeds of the flowers. You must boil in the water of this bath Sloe
leaves, and therewithal bathe and sweat. In the bathing you shall forbear
from drink: but this bath is more commodious after some phlegmatic Agues
than after any hot Agues; and what order of diet is to be observed after a
lingering Ague when the patient begins to recover, has been sufficiently
showed and declared in the third Chapter and the twelfth.

The fifteenth Chapter. Of the Plague.
THis most noisome, terrible, and perilous malady of the plague, is called of
the Greeks Epidemia, and of the Latinists Lues, Pestis, and Pestilentia, which
last name we also use. This malady is described by Galen after this manner.

The Plague is a sickness that does infect all, or at the least very many men,
and is caused of the venomous air. Or thus: The Plague is a disease that
either speedily kills, or soon forsakes a man.

And where such sicknesses get the upper hand, there distress and misery
abounds, for it has been seen by experience that it has made away men,
cattle, and fowls of the air, yea many thousands of fishes in the waters, and
that not only villages and towns have been deprived thereby of all their
inhabitants, but also great cities and countries have by the same been made
desolate.

The causes of the Plague.. 1.
OF the natural causes of the Plague, there are as many opinions amongst the
Philosophers as there are causes that procure it; as namely of venomous vapors
of the earth that are infected by some earthquakes: or if a country be hot,
moist, full of stenches, full of lakes, or still standing waters, and cloyed
with stench of dead bodies, as it oftentimes befalls after great wars and
slaughters; but especially is the air infected as is abouesaid through sin,
whereby it may diversely be venomed.

Also when the air is warm and moist, and that it does rain much in time of
heat, with a Southerly wind, whereof we will not at this present make any
further discourse: but they that desire to have any ampler description hereof,
may read over the Philosophers, and other learned Physicians.

But howsoever, this is the most certain cause of this sickness, that God the
Lord for our manifold sins and wickedness, to wit, idolatry, incredulity,
and ingratitude, has used this Plague and many afflictions more, as hunger,
war, and shedding of blood, to punish the foresaid sins and transgressions.
These are his rods and scourges (even the ministers of his wrath) to chastise
the wicked world, as (through his Prophets) he has foresaid and threatened the
world, and as both holy Scriptures and heathen writers testify, that it has
afterward ensued accordingly.

Signs of the Plague to come.. 2.
FIrst, it is a certain sign that the air is infected, and that a plague is
to be expected, if in the end of the summer there appear Comets, or any other
impressions, which men call flakes of fire, stars that fall or shoot, and
such like in the element, which proceed of vapors that are drawn out of the
earth into the air, and there are kindled, whereby both men and cattle are
infected.

Secondly, when any unaccustomed heap of beasts are seen, as of Frogs,
Toades, Grasshoppers, Mice, and Worms, which oftentimes have been approved
heretofore.

Thirdly, when in the winter the South or East winds abound, mistie or foggie
weather, full of vapors, and glowing or drowsy, and like as it would rain,
and yet raineth not at all: these are signs that the air is not as it should
be. Also if the spring of the year be cold and dry without rain, the wind
Southerly, the air foggie and lowering, and stands so at a stay eight days
long, and then alters into warmth: if these alterations often chance, then is
it a certain and infallible sign that the plague is at hand. In like manner
also is it a sure token of the plague to ensue, when in the summer time it is
hot a days and cold a nights.

Item, when the summer is not hot, but gloomy and cloudy, and one day hot and
another day cold, then must we look for a plague in harvest. In like manner
also if two or three days be very hot, and afterward very cold, as it often
chances, then does it prognosticate a plague.

How to prevent the Plague.. 3.
THere is no more Christian nor certain means for to escape this great
punishment, then for a man to reconcile himself to his heavenly Father, and to
pray unto him with much contrition and hearty repentance of his sins, that it
would please him to withhold his threatenings and punishments for our due
deserts, and that we acknowledge him from the bottom of our hearts to be the
right only and true Physician that will and can preserve us, be it living or
dying, in perpetual health and welfare.

Yet notwithstanding has he not in vain created natural means, nor
forbidden us to use them, but rather all things, as Physicians, physic,
roots, herbs, seeds, and the aires, yea all that is above and under the
earth for the benefit of man, and to serve him, therefore we ought duly to
accept and receive the same as a most godly benefit and noble blessing of so
good a God, and in no manner of wise to despise the same, and therefore are all
learned Physicians most highly to be esteemed, that have found out so many
means for all kinds of diseases, as also for this present infection, and have
revealed and made them known to mankind. And to the end men may have a good
instruction how this sickness may be helped with the foresaid remedies, there
shall be observed these three principal points: the first whereof is for the
healthy, that thereby they may know what order is to be kept, whereby they
might be freed from this venomous contagion.

Secondly, we are to show that if any be taken with the Ague, or other signs,
with sores or biles, or not at all, what ought to be done to them, or what is
to be left off.

Thirdly, we will speak of all such as keep those that are so diseased, and
are to minister and serve them, for the which there be many approved and
famous medicines selected, both by the ancient and latter Physicians, our most
loving and merciful God give us his gracious blessing and prosperity to
finish them.

First then it is generally concluded by all learned men, that forasmuch as the
heart requires a sweet, clean, and healthy air, like as the body requires
meat and drink: also that nothing is more venomous, noisome, nor hurtful for
the same, than a foul stinking air; for thence comes it especially if a
loose and unstayed life, either in excess of meat, drink, exercise,
incontinencie, wrath, and such like be adjoined, that the venomous air with
other infections, the sooner hurt the heart and inner parts, and by their
contagion disease the whole body, and lastly bereave man of his vital breath.

How the healthy may be kept and preserved from the infection of the Plague.. 4.
EVen as we have oftentimes heretofore admonished, so will we now show by what
means the hail and healthy may in the time of the Plague be freed and
preserved from this contagious malady; therefore is it first of all needful to
observe a good diet in eating and drinking: and further a fair clean dwelling
which must be smoked and perfumed, thereby to correct and take away the
corruption of the air. For this must be used all fragrant things, to keep the
body loose with laratiue medicines, and to comfort the heart with cordials, and
always to take somewhat whereby all the parts of the body and the vital
spirits might be comforted and defended against the venomous air, and
contagion of others that we might be conversant withal, with many more things as
shall hereafter appear.

And first of the order to be observed in diet. It is passing good, and very
needful for every body that wishes to live out of the danger of the Plague,
to take great heed that his body be not pestered with over many humors, nor
ouercharged with meat and drink, but to live very soberly, and that all such
meat as he takes must be more drying than moistening, for that whereas there
is an unmeasurable fullness of the stomach, there are many bad humors
engendered, which afterward by this contagion very easily are infected. Neither
ought any body to eat before that he feel and find that his former meats
and digested; and when nature by hunger or thirst requires food, then satisfy
her without longer delay: for as the over charging of the stomach is a great
cause of corruption, even so also does an empty stomach procure bad humors. It
is likewise very commodious, that all the patients meat be rather cold than
hot in operation, which must be dressed with sower and eager things, as we shall
herafter instruct you more at large. His dread must be of good wheat, well
raised, baked, and seasoned. Of fowls, the Partridges, land fowls, Pullets,
Hens, Capons, and young Pigeons. Item, young Weathers and Veale, yet rather
roasted than sodden, or else if it be sodden, then must it be dressed with sower
things. And for that the Plague oftentimes infecteth all fourefooted beasts, as
Oxen, sheep, swine, and sometimes the very birds of the air, therefore great
heed must be taken that then neither the flesh nor the milk of them in any
way be used: also the Magistrates ought not to permit any of the flesh of those
beasts so infected, to be sold.

Note also that in the time of the Plague all sower things are very wholesome,
and therefore Vinegar is highly commended with all kind of meats, and
especially vinegar of Roses, or of Gilloflowers, or of Framboyes. Item, horse
radish with Vinegar and Sorrel beaten for sauce, Pomegranates, Saint John's
grapes, or Ribes vulgaris, Veriuice, preserved Cherries, conserues of
Barberies, and all sirupes that are made of these foresaid things, unripe
Grapes dressed with their meat, new Limons and Citrons, these are all very good
to be used in time of the Plague.

Item, for all such as have no pain in their eyes nor ach in the head are
roasted Onions (or the same softened in fair water) passing good: but Garlic
above all the rest (being dressed in meats) is wonderful good, and much
esteemed for a preservative against this kind of infection. Therefore it is
commanded that men dip their bread in Vinegar, wherewith the juice of wild
Thyme and of Garlic is tempered: also to eat the kernels of two or three
Nuts dipped in the same. And you may use this sauce following with your meat:
Take Vinegar and juice of Limons, temper it as you think good with powned
Walnuts, and with a little grated bread, and and you may also (if you please)
put thereto some Saffron and Cinnamome.

And you may make a temperature also with Currants and Vinegar, flesh broth,
Cinnamom: poched eggs are also permitted if they be used with veriuice.

Of fruits, all that be sower are only tolerated. And you may strew this
powder following upon the meat: Take prepared pearls one quarter of an ounce,
red Coral and fine Bolus, of each half a dragme, Cinnamom two dragmes and a
half, and then mingle them all together.

The meats that are forbidden to be used for the healthie, are these, to wit,
Milk and all that is dressed therewith: all sweet fruits, stewed apples and
pears are allowed: muddie or slimy fish are especially prohibited, as Eeles,
Tenches, and such like; but such fish as are taken from sandy ground are not
bad: old powdered flesh, or salt fish are also suspected. But be it flesh or
fish, let the same be always dressed with some sower thing, as with Vinegar, the
juice of Limons, Veriuice, and such like. Or you may use these sawces
following: Take the juice of Pimpernel, of Sorrel, Buglosse, of Scabious, of
Rue, of Lettice, of Endive, of Baulme, of Elecampane, al together, or some of
them, as it pleases you, and mingle them with vinegar and bread, as you think
good.

Item, Capers with the juice of Limons or of Citrons, is also a healthie sauce
to be used. All water fowls, as Duckes, Geese, Hernsewes, and such like, let
him not eat; notwithstanding that the Duckes blood is thought to be a
preservative against venom.

And for your drink, you must not use any but only to flacke thirst withal,
or according as the party has eaten: the best drink is white clear and thin
Wine (which is not sweet) being tempered with steeled water, or that wherein
Gold has been extinguished. But there can be no better thing than to drink
fair fountain water which is tempered with vinegar and sugar, or water
wherein the juice of Pomegranates is mixed. You may also make a drink of
Barberries, and Juniper berries, whereof you need to take but now and then a
little draught. And you must also note here, that it were not amiss to drink
every mealetide a draught of Wormwood or Sage wine, or in stead of them to
take a bit of bread that is steeped in the wine of Elecampane and wine of
Zeduary.

These are the ordinances that in the time of the plague are to be kept and
observed in meat and drink, having always a good regard (as we have already
said) of the time of the year, of the constitution of the patient, of his
accustomed manner of diet, and so forth, whereby either of the foresaid things
may be used or omitted.

How their dwellings ought to be.. 5.
IT is also very needful for a preservation against this sickness, that the
house and all the chambers (as well as the body) be kept neat and clean.
Therefore every householder ought (if he love the health of himself and his
family) to look diligently that his house or place of his dwelling be kept
very clean. All tame beasts, and especially swine ought to be kept far apart
from all your dwelling houses. Your house is to have many windows in it, and
that such windows as do stand toward the West and South must you keep close
and shut; but the windows that be toward the East and North must be opened
wide, so that the plague be not in those quarters near hand. Warm stoues are
very vnhaile, and especially if they do lie low: but in the chimney it is best
to burn dry wood, and most of all Iumper wood, dry Vine branches, Firwood,
Ash, Oaks Cipres wood, Bay trees, and Rosemary sticks, and that according to
the nature of the place where every kind of wood is best to be had, and chiefly
the Beech tree, for that there is no kind of wood that more takes away the
venomous vapor or infection of the plague than the Beech tree does.

Moreover, you must cause the house to be swept wherein you dwell at least
twice a day, and besprinkled with vinegar or Rose water, and then to smoke it
with some of these things following, to wit, with Iuniperberries, Hyssap,
Marierom, wild Thime, Mints, Rosemary, Mari^rom gentle, and Basil, with
Lauander, Penniroyal, and apple parings, or such like. And for rich men you may
make diverse compounded things, whereof we will write at large, which you may use
as need shall require.

First there are perfumes which the Apothecaries do call Ozyletes: for this must
you use Juniper, yellow Saunders, Paradise wood, Frankincense, and Juniper
berries, of each three dragmes, Amber, Juniper, Gum, Sandaraca, and Rosemary
flowers, of each one dragme, Nutmegs and Cloves, of each one dragme and a
half* powne them all together to powder, and then put to it of Laudanum one
ounce and a half, Benzoi and red Storax, of each a quarter of an ounce, black
Frankincense three dragmes, Tilly coals that are to be sprinkled and moistened
with Aqua vitae being beaten small, half as much as all the rest: afterward
make the mortar and the pestell very warm, and then put therein the Laudanum
with a little Turpentine, temper them together till they be as soft as dough,
and mix then therewith all the foresaid things, and make hereof a strong dough
with molified Dragagant, and roll it on a table that is rubbed over with oil
of Spike, and make the candles as great and as small as you list to have them,
making them underneath with three feet that they may stand, and let them dry
in the sun: and when you set those candles in a close chamber to fume, they will
for certain expel all the venomous air of the Plague.

These things following are used for this at Augburch in high Dutchland, to
wit, Laudanum two ounces, black and white Frankincense, of each one ounce, red
Storax half an ounce, Benzoi three quarters of an ounce, Cloves, Roses,
Cinnamom, black Coriander, Masticke, Sandaraca, Cipres wood, Bayberries,
yellow Saunders and Nutmegs, of each one dragme beaten small, liquid Storax two
ounces, Wax one ounce, Turpentine two ounces and a half, burnt wine or Aqua
vitae as much as is needful; the Laudanum, Storax, Wax and Turpentine is to
be molten i^ a warm mortar, and hereof may you make candles as is before
taught: if the dough be hard, then make it soft with burnt wine. Another: Take
Paradise wood, Saffron, Cinnamome, Cloves, yellow Saunders, and Roses, of each
half a dragme, Masticke, red Storax, and Frankincense, of each a quarter of an
ounce; powne them very small, and then make it up with liquid Storax into
dough, but temper not too many Tilly coals amongst it, that the virtue of the
other things be not thereby abated, and form them as before.

Or take Benzoin, Gallia Moscata, red Storax, and roots of Costus, of each
half an ounce, Diptamus, Tormentill, Citron peels, and Setwall, of each a
drag. red and white Behen, of each half a drag. red, yellow, and white
Saunders, Roses, of each half a drag. powne all that are to be powned, melt the
Laudanum with Rose water in a warm mortar, and then form candles thereof, as
is aforesaid: these candles are specially good against the pestilent air. But
for that the right Costus roots and Behen are ill to be gotten, are these
candles but seldom made.

These following are also used: take Laudanum, red Storax, Myrrh and Masticke,
of each a quarter of an ounce, Rosemarie leaves, wild Galingall, and Roses, of
each half an ounce, Cinnamom, Cloves, yellow Saunders, and Nutmegs, of each a
drag. Tilly cooles moystened with burnt wine or Aqua vitae, four ounces, then
form them as before.

Yet other: Take Cipers wood and Juniper, of each half a drag. small beaten
Juniper berries (the kernels taken out) Rosemarie leaves, and wild Galingall,
of each three drag. blacks and white Frankincense, of each half an ounce,
Laudanum three quarters of an ounce, Tilly coals as aforesaid.

In the stead of these fuming candles, men use to make also cakes of all the
foresaid doughes (but only the coals left out) and in winter time you may use
them laid on the coals, or on the hot furnace of your stoue.

Item, take yellow Saunders, Benzoin, and red Storax, of each a quarter of an
ounce, white Frankincense one drag. Nutmegs and Cloves, of each half a drag.
Roses, Coriander, and Sugar, of each a scrup. beat all small to powder, and
then mingle them together with Dragagant dissolved in Rose water (as before is
taught) in a mortar, and in Summer then prepare them with fresh Roses, to wit,
that each cake be covered with a Rose leaf, and then pressed flat: but if you
would have them costlier, then put unto it four greines of Musk, and two
greins of Amber, dissolved in Rose water, and then will they be exceeding
pleasant.

These are also usually made at Ausburgh: Take Benzoin three quarters of an
ounce, the roots of Cipers half a drag. red Storax, and white Saunders, of
each 3. drag. Cloves and prepared Coriander, of each a drag. Calmus and
Frankincense, of each half a drag. Musk two greines, white Sugar six ounces:
then make cakes thereof with dissolved Dragagant.

Item, take ben Cipers and Juniper wood, of each three drag. Rosemarie flowers
and Juniper berries, of each a quarter of an ounce, white and black
Frankincense, of each half an ounce; beat them very small, and temper them
with as much Laudanum, that it cleave together, or with dissolved Dragagant,
Turpentine or Storax.

Or take Iuniperberries, Bayberries, Roses, Wormwood branches, Mastick,
Frankincense, Cardamome, Rue, and Cloves, of each a like quantity; then mix
them together with dissolved Dragagant as aforesaid, and then lay it on the
furnace in your stoue.

Here follows now a very costly water to temper with these kinds of cakes,
Candles, and Pomanders.

Take good Rosewater one pint, Lauander flowers three M. Cloves and Cinnamom,
of each half an ounce, yellow and white Sanders, of each three quarters of an
ounce, Mace a quarter of an ounce, Roses one M. Benzoin and red Storax, of each
2. drag. powne them small, and power thy Rosewater thereon, or Muscadell wine,
or any other strong wine, eight ounces, Aqua vitae one ounce: let it be close
stopped one month or twain, and so stand in the Sun: Afterward distill it in
seething water, stopped very exceeding tight and close, with a helm. And with
that which is stilled temper Musk and Amber, and then set it in the Sun again.

This Rosewater following is also very excellent for the same, or any such like
intent: When you will distill the Roses in common Stils, then must you not set
them in sand but in ashes, and then put some Roses into it, and cast on it the
powder of Cloves, then lay on it more Roses, and so do till the Still be full;
then put on the helm, and make it tight and close, taking heed of burning.
But if you will have it stronger, then put to them more spices, as Benzoin, and
such like. Lastly, then may you strengthen the savor of the water distilled
with Musk and Amber: both of these waters may also be used for other things as
is aforesaid. But if you will spare this labor, then may you use the foresaid
things each apart, or mixed together (as you please) with hot coals, and so
let it savor and fume.

In like manner may you prepare these powders following: Take Benzoin, red
Storax, Paradise wood, Musk, Amber, Cloves, Frankincense, Myrrh, Masticke,
and Gallia Muscata, which or as many of them as you will; powne them to powder:
for this powder you must omit the coals, the Laudanum, and the other dissolved
things, the which otherwise are commonly used in the compositions before.

Item, take grated or powdered Cipers wood a M. also of prepared Cipers half as
much, beaten Rosemarie half as much as of the Cipers, black and white
Frankincense, of each half an ounce, Bayberries shaled clean a quarter of an
ounce, being grossly beaten, mingle them well together, and strew a little of it
on the coals; for it is a most pleasant savor.

And if you fear that such odoriferous sauors were too hot in Summer, then
may you put thereto some of the leaves and seeds of Myrtle, also to augment the
quantity of Camfer, Sanders and Citron peels: sprinkle it also with Vinegar or
Rosewater. In stead of fire strew the chamber with Rose leaves, and let them be
swept out at night, that they be no cause of stench; and before you go to bed
you must fume the chamber well.

It is also very meet that you keep lying in the chamber where you sleep,
odoriferous Quinces, Citrons, Apples, Pears, Oranges, and such like. When they
begin to rot, then must they be had away, and other laid in their places.

Also in Summer you may prepare this powder following: Take Roses, Myrtle
seeds, Citro^ peels, red, yellow, and white Saunders, Sorrel seeds, and wild
Vine leaves, of each one drag. and a half, Myrrh, Paradise wood, Dragagant,
and Gum, of each two dragmes, Camfer a drag. all stamped small, and put them
together. You may also make it up into cakes with dissolved Dragagant. If it be
in Winter, then take Myrrh, Paradise wood, Mastick, red Storax, and
Frankincense, of each a drag. Cloves, Citron peels, and the roots of Cipers, of
each half a drag. Camfer a scrup. Gallia Muscata, ten greins, Musk and Amber,
of each 5. greins; beat them together into a powder. You may also make cakes
of it with liquid Storax, and Rosewater: if you will put Laudanum to it, then
make the same warm as aforesaid, and fashion your cakes as big as you will
have them. For the common people and for the husbandmen the Bay tree is very
good, or if the country yield it, Juniper wood with his berries, and with dry
Hen dung fumed: or take powned Wormwood and Bayberries, of each a like. The
rich folks do use to lay also with their clothes odoriferous bags, for which
all the powders that are before mentioned for fumes, and hereafter for
Pomanders, are very good, excepting the Laudanum, ye which is not to be
powdered, and other mo such soft things. This following is very common in
France: Take Ireos four ounces, Roses two ounces, wild Galingall, Cloves, and
Marioram gentle, of each two dragms, yellow Saunders, and Benzoin, of each two
ounces, red Storax half an ounce, then mingle them all together and put them
in a bag. If you will you may put thereto Musk and Amber, or Camfer. In the
first part, the twelfth chap. you have also an especial bag to strengthen the
head as thus: Take Ireos, etc. the which is very commodious for this our
purpose. Also you have in the second chap. and elsewhere, applications for the
strengthening of the heart; the which are not only profitable, but also very
necessary for this intent.

What exercise is to be used in the Plague.. 6.
IN the time of infection the healthie are to exercise themselves moderatly,
and rather use an easy walking than a great pace, that thereby the venomous
air may not overmuch be drawn into the body, as it happens to such as at
such times do greatly labor and travel; but when a man abides in a clean
place, void of pestilent air, and will exercise his body according to his old
accustomed manner, that cannot but be thought passing good.

Of the sleep in this sickness.. 7.
AT such time as the Plague reigns, some think that it is better to sleep by
day than by night, even seven or eight hours long: first upon the right side
being meetly well covered, and his head raised high. But seeing the same is not
accustomed with us, then must they eat but little in the evening, and sleep
the foresaid time of seven or eight hours. But if he could not sleep a
nights, then must he about 12. a clock, being 2. hours after his meal
compose himself to sleep.

Others counsel to sleep a nights in a chamber that is well fumed, and close
shut, but not very long, for that through much sleep the body is too much
moistened, the which must always be inclined to drouth as much as possibly may
be. They also forbid sleeping by day, and that chiefly in Winter.

Also you must take heed of excessive and overmuch watching, for that greatly
dries and weakeneth nature.

Of Purging and letting blood.. 8.
CAre must also be had that the body be not too much bound: and if the going
to stool come of it self, it is the better; if not, then must the party be
helped with suppositories, and mild Clisters, with Cassie, Manna, sour Dates,
and such like means, whereof we have here and there spoken at large; but
especially in the third part, the eleventh chapter,. 20.

Other would have that young choleric bodies should generally be purged in
the summer, and in the beginning of winter, with the foresaid cooling and
laxatiue things, and also with yellow Mirobalans boiled with Plum-porredg: but
in the end of Autumn, and in the winter with stronger medicines, to wit, with
Agarick, with Turbith, and with Polypody: but they must be used with great
heed and discretion.

Touching letting of blood: When the party is once purged, and above sixteen
years old, being full of blood and strong, and without any obstruction of the
liver, then may he have a vein opened. In like manner also women, if their
terms and flowers be stopped, and if they be without piles in the fundament,
then may they in May and in Autumn let blood, and if occasion serves, once a
month, to wit, in the Liver vein, or Milt vein, every time three or four
ounces, for this takes away the boiling of the blood and the Cholera in the
veins. Yet for this infection must sometimes one, sometimes more be opened,
but especially that which is fullest of blood.

But great regard must (as has been said) be taken of the age and weakness of
the patient: also whether a woman have conceived or not, or whether she have
her terms or not, or have the Hemmorrhoids or not, with many such
circumstances more, that the weakness of the party thereby be not augmented.

Above and beside all this must the patient abstain from venery as much as may
be.

Of the motions of the mind.. 9.
NOw concerning the motions of the mind, as sadness, fear, sudden motions of
the mind, and such like, they do greatly alter and spoil the blood, whereby it
may the sooner receive the pestilent air, and anger especially inflameth the
heart, like as also does overmuch gladness: notwithstanding moderate gladness
is most commodious for the heart.

Of bathes and other common causes.. 10.
AT such times take heed of bathing, for that thereby is the body moistened,
the pores opened, and all the members made the readier to receive the infection
of the plague.

It is therefore very ill done (yea a temptation of God) in time of the plague
to frequent common bathing houses, for that the plague can by no means be
sooner gotten, by reason that as well the pores of the infected as the sound
are opened, whereby the venomous vapor of the infected is let forth, and may
easily be received of the healthy: wherefore it is much better (as the custom
of this country is) to refrain wholly from bathing.

In like manner it is not good at such times to wash the head, for thereby are
the vital spirits weakened, but only to comb their heads with an Iuorie
comb.

But the hands must often be washed, sometimes with wine, and otherwhiles with
vinegar, and especially with Rose vinegar.

How one shall govern himself without doors.. 11.
IT is very good that at this time every man observe a good diet within doors,
and not accompany himself with many men, for amongst many are as well those
that be infected, as those that are healthie, whereby the diseased infect the
healthie with their breath: but for that it is impossible to forbear it, by
reason that every man has business with others, it is therefore best that
every one defend himself from all ill airs. Wherefore first we counsel the
common sort, and men of occupation (which cannot bear greater charge) to
observe these rules following, to wit, that he in the morning betimes before he
go abroad or settle himself to work, take three or four dry Figs, three
or four kernels of Nuts, and fifteen or sixteen leaves of Rue, with a little
salt. This composition or medicine is so sure and approved, that men have used
the same every where for all manner of Plagues three hundredth years before the
birth of Christ: and the same was found out by K. Mithridates that waged wars
with the Romans. Some add to it a few Almonds, and make it to a confection
with clarified Honey. It is also passing good for all such as be not afraid of
the bitterness, that they use in the morning fasting a piece of the root of
Gentian, and especially when he has used of the premises. Other do also give
counsel to eat but one Fig and one Nut kernel, but it is too little for a
full grown person, for children it will suffice.

It is also very good before the going forth in the morning to break ones
fast, and thereupon to take a little Unicorns horn, Tormentill, Gentian,
Angelica, Diptamus, Citron peeles, or a bit of Zeduarie, and hold it in your
mouth: or to wash the mouth with vinegar wherein Wormwood has been decocted.

For this also confected Calmus is much commended, taken before the going into
the air, for it has an especial virtue against all venomous air. Also some
do counsel not to go out of doors before that the mouth and nostrils be
cleansed with wine wherein Treacle is mixed.

This composition following is commended for an especial preservation if
inunction be made with it: Take the juice of Garlic and Rose vinegar, of each
one ounce and a half, Treacle three quarters of an ounce, Beuercod two
dragmes, mix them together, and therewith anoint the mouth, lips, and nose.

Some do use this salve following, therewith to anoint the heart before they
go out of the house, the which is not good only for the healthie, but for all
such as are already infected: take Treacle three quarters of an ounce, Saffron
and Camfere, of each ten greines, the juice of Limons and Vinegar, of each a
like much, or as much as is needful to make a salve.

Or in the stead of these, he may wear the cordial shield which is described
not long since with the cordial bag in this manner: Take Burrage, etc. It is
also very good to wear gold rings wherein are set precious stones, as Rubies,
Carbuncles, Saphires and Iacincts, both within the house and without doors.

It is also much forbidden that any stir out of doors before the Sun rising,
as also before the going down thereof to repair and keep himself in his
perfumed house or chamber.

Further it is very good to carry some odoriferous thing in their hands, when
one must deal with other folk, that through this pleasant smell the brains
and the heart may be comforted and defended from all pestilent and contagious
vapors.

It is also not amiss for the common people that they carry in their hands a
little box of Juniper made full of holes, wherein a little sponge moistened
with vinegar and Rosewater, and strewed with the powder of Cloves, be held in
the hand all the Summer time, whereto also some leaves of Rue may be added
daily refreshing them, and that they continually smell to the same. In this
manner also may thou hold some fruits in thy hand, as Apples, Pears,
Quinces, Oranges, and such like: but if it be in the winter, then take Marioram
gentle, Rue, Balm, Valeriana, Juniper berries, or some other thing steeped in
vinegar, put it into thy box, and use it as is aforesaid. Also thou may
bestrew thy moist sponge with Saunders, Camfere, Saffron, Paradise wood,
Cloves, or Ireos. But the rich and able folk do use Poma Ambrae, which we call
Pomanders, whereof there are made many sorts, as here may appear.

Yet men must note here that all such strong odors, whereas there is any pain
of the head proceeding either of heat or cold, the^ are they neither so good
nor so often to be used, but in such sort as herafter follows, whereby the
same pain as it often falls out, be not augmented: and women must beware of
these smells, and especially those that are vexed with the suffocation of the
Mother. And if it be in winter, and ye patient be cold of complexion, then are
you to prepare these Pomanders: Take Gallia Muscata, Roses, Cloves, Zeduarie,
Mace, Nutmegs, and Paradise wood, of each a drag. Saffron a scrup. red Storax a
drag. and a half, Ambra and Muscus, of each 5. greines, powne them all
together except the two last, and then make hereof with prepared Dragagant a
Pomander, even as is taught in the first part and the second Chapter.

Item: take yellow Saunders a quarter of an ounce, Paradise wood a dragme and a
half, Roses, Cloves, Zeduarie, Mace, and Nutmegs, of each half a dragme,
Cloves, Cardamome, Coriander, and black Coriander, of each a dragme, all of
them beaten to fine powder, Laudanum one ounce, Benzoin half an ounce,
dissolve them with Rosewater and make thereof an odoriferous Apple or Pomander:
and if then you put thereto Musk and Amber, it is at your choice and pleasure.
This Pomander is special good against a bad foggie air, and this following
may also be used in winter: Take Laudanum, and red Storax, of each half an
ounce, Cloves, and Cinnamom, of each a dragme and a half, Nutmegs, yellow
Saunders, Roses, Basil, and yellow Amber, of each half a drag. powne them all
together, but dissolve the Laudanum in warm Rosewater, and then make thereof a
Pomander.

Also the mortar (wherein these things have been tempered) must be wiped about
with a little kemmed sheep wool, and then wrap the Pomander therein,
afterward bind it up in red sarsnet, and then they will keep their sent the
longer.

Another: Take clean Laudanum half an ounce, Benzoin a quarter of an ounce,
red Storax three dragmes, Paradise wood, yellow Saunders, white Frankincense,
and yellow Amber, of each a dragme, Rosemarie flowers, Marioram gentle, garden
Mints, and Basil, of each half a dragme, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cardamome, Cucubes
and Coriander, of each a dragme; temper them all together, and form it into a
pomander with a little liquid Storax, and at the last put a little Musk and
Amber unto it.

But if it be in Summer, or that the person be of an hot complexion; then take
water Lilly flowers, Mints, Violets, wild Vine leaves, Roses, Myrtle seed,
white and yellow Sanders, Citron peels, dried Quinces, dried Prunes, of each
half a dragme, Saffron and Camfere, of each a scruple, Galliae Muscatae ten
greins, make them up into a pomander with Vinegar wherein fine Bolus is
dissolved: with this may thou also use Vinegar and Rosewater.

Item, take Roses, Violets, Buglosse, and Burrage flowers, of each half a
dragme, yellow and white Saunders, of each one dragme, Ireos three dragmes,
Balm, Citron shells, of each two dragmes, dissolved Laudanum, skant as much
that it may be tempered with the rest and made up into a pomander with
Dragagant dissolved in Rosewater, and at the last add a little Musk. There
are also diverse pomanders prepared that are good at all times; amongst which
first these three following are to be used in the time of the plague.

Take Roses a quarter of an ounce, red and white Saunders, of each a dragme and
a half, Camfere one scruple, Ambra half a drag. Musk 4. greines, Paradise
wood two scrup. Citron pals half a drag. Cinnamom, Mace, and Nutmegs, of each
a scrup. red Storax half an ounce, Laudanum one ounce, beat them very small,
but dissolve the Laudanum with liquid Storax, and then make thereof a pomander.

Another: Take Roses, Violets, and flowers of Buglosse, of each 2. scrup.

red Coral, and burnt Iuorie, of each half a drag. sirupe of Citrons and fine
Bolus, of each half an ounce, Sealed earth a quarter of an ounce, pown all
that are to be powned except the Amber and Musk, set them in the Sun in a
close stopped pot, or on a warm furnace until all the juice be dried in,
afterward take four ounces of Laudanum, that is dissolved in Rosewater and
vinegar, and Turpentine washed in Rosewater as much as is needful for a mass,
and hereof make them Poma^ders. Item, take Roses, Cloves, Mace, Spica of Indy,
water Lilly flowers, Violets, Marioram, Asarabacca and S^echas of each half a

with the rest make a pomander.

Yet another, at all furnished Apothecaries you may find diverse preparatiues of
pomanders, so that thou need to add nothing but Musk and Amber, of the
which we will describe four sundry sorts.

Take Laudanum three ounces, red Storax three dragmes, Marioram gentle, Roses,
Camfer, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each a dragme and a half,
Cinnamom, Nutmegs, Cloves and Mace, of each a drag. Paradise wood two scrup.

Nutmegs, and Cucubes, of each half a drag. red, white, and yellow Saunders, of

Thirdly, take red Storax and flowers of Buglosse, of each two scruples, Cloves
one dragm, white and red Behen, of each a scruple, Paradise wood two scruples,
Myrrh, Calmus, Nutmegs, Spica of Indy, Frankincense, Juniper gum, and Mastick,

mix therewith powned Citron peels and their seeds, of each a dragm, Saffron and
Camfer, of each half a drag. and tie them all together in a piece of sarsnet,
or if you will you may make a pomander of it, tempering it with the juice of
Basil.

Preseruatiua, or preservatives, that defend men from the Plague.. 12.
THere are also diverse things that men (being in health) may use in the time of
the Plague, whereby they be not so soon infected of other men, for the which
first of all these simples are for the most part good, to wit, Citron seeds,
Scabious, Pimpernell the great, Rue, Valerian, Cicorie, Sorrel, and both their
waters, Elecampane, Diptamus, Gentian, Tormentill, Carduus Benedictus,
Angelica, and Bayberries, one of these things holden in the mouth, taken in
powder, or drunken, are all especial good against the Plague, and they may be
used in many other compositions, as may be seen by these following.

All famous Physicians do for this sickness counsel, first, that men should
speedily fly far from the contagious places, and return back again with
leisure: for he that is a far off from the Plague, shall not be infected
therewith, even as no man is slain in the wars, that is not present there.
Also it is to be noted (as has been already said) that men ought to be loose
bodied, and freed from all superfluous humidities and uncleanness. Therefore
those that are above the age of eleven years, are to be oftentimes purged with
these common pills herafter described. Also care must be taken that the heart
and all other principal parts of the body be comforted and kept dry, which
may be done by the right Bole armoniack. In like manner also with Mithridate
and Treacle, if that every week, or at the least every ten days a dragme in
weight be taken with the water of Sorrel, sweating after it, and keeping
within doors all the day after.

Here is also to be noted, when any one will take of this Treacle or
Mithridate, that he have eaten nothing before, nor eat any thing afterward in
five or six hours. But amongst all other medicines and preservatives, these
last before mentioned pills bear the prick and price, which are to be had at
the Apothecaries, called Pestilentiales Ruffi, Communes, de Tribus, and sine
Cura, which the principal Physicians have described and commended so highly,
that it has never bin seen that such as used the same orderly were killed of
the Plague, which also any one may at al times, be the person young or old, use
without any danger: for like as it is with a pot beginning to sees, it casts
up scum, and is cleansed through scumming, even so do these pills take away all
superfluities and uncleanness which is gathered together about the principal
parts, and preserve the blood from all kinds of putrefaction. These pills are
made in this sort: Take Aloe one ounce, Myrrh and Saffron, of each half an
ounce, beat them all together with good pleasant wine, hereof are you to take
every week a dragme, or every third day three pills as big as a great pease,
and thereupon drink a pretty draught of white wine that is delayed with
Rosewater, or with Sorrel water, yet ought women with child to abstain from
them. These pills are of great force in the time of the plague, and do also
drive out all superfluities of the stomach.

Others take Aloe three quarters of an ounce, Myrrh three dragmes, Saffron one
dragme, Rubarb a quarter of an ounce, prepared Agaricus one dragme, Cloves,
Citron seeds, and the peels, and Spica of Indy, of each a scruple, Tormentill
and red Saunders, of each a dragme and a half, fine Bolus three dragmes,
Camfer ten greines, powne them well all together, and make pills hereof with
sirupe of Citrons.

Item, take the juice of Sorrel, the juice of Buglosse, and of Cicorie, of
each two ounces, fine Bolus one ounce, mix them all together, and stir them
often in 24. hours, afterward add these things following, Aloe three ounces,
Camfer two scruples Saphirs, Iacincts, and Smaragdes, of each half a scruple,
Pearls one drag. Citron seed a quarter of an ounce, Paradise wood, Basil
seed, Amber, red Coral, and Zeduarie, of each eight greins, Roses, Violets,
Sorrel seed, Burrage flowers, and flowers of Buglosse, of each half a scrup.
stamp them all together, and mingle it well, and afterward set in the Sun
or in any other warm place till all the juice be dried away. This being done,
then power more juice thereon again, and do so three times. Now when you
desire to use hereof, then make 7. pills of one drag. with some Aqua composita,
and take hereof every morning or every evening one pill, and that before meals.

These following are also highly commended: Take of the common plague pills
(that are herebefore described) four scruples, prepared Agaricus half a
dragme, Zeduary and Angelica, of each one dragme, Rubarb one scruple,
Trociscorum Alhandali five greines: then make pills hereof with water of
Carduus Benedictus: take of these pills one drag. once a week, three hours
after supper, and in the morning drink a good draught of the decoction of
Pease, and eat somewhat three hours after.

Some use these pills following: Take Aloe and Agaricus of each one dragme,
Myrrh and fine Bolus, of each a quarter of an ounce, Saffron a dragme; then
make pills hereof with Baulme water, or water of Buglosse, and so use them as
has been said.

These pills following do not purge, but defend the heart and all inward parts
from al bad infection: take Paradise wood half a dragme, burnt Hearts horn two
scruples, red Saunders one dragme, Tormentill, Citron seed, Terra sigillata,
and red Coral, of each half a scruple, Sorrel seeds, Diptamus, and Zeduarie,
of each a scruple, fine Bolus three dragms, Species de gemmis frigidis a dragme
and a half, Lignum Balsami half a dragme, Camfere four greins: then make
hereof pills with sirupe of Citrons, or with the juice of Ribes.

These following are yet more forcible: Take Paradise wood half a dragme,
Tormentill two scruples, Diptamus one scruple, Zeduary and Lignum Balsami, of
each half a dragme, Saffron one scruple, Cloves five greines, Verueine half a
drag. burnt Hearts horn two scruples, red Saunders one scruple, red Coral and
Sorrel seeds, of each half a drag. fine Bolus three ounces, Species de gemmis
frigidis three drag. Camfere four greines, make pills hereof with sirupe of
Citrons, or with the juice of Ribes.

Others that are good for the heart: Take Citron seeds two dragmes, Iacincts,
Smaragdes, Doronicum, and bones of a Stags heart, of each one scruple, Zeduarie,
wood of Paradise, of each two scruples, the roots of fiue-leafed grass, or
Cinquefoile, of each a quarter of an ounce: then make pills hereof with the
sirupe of Citrons.

Of all these foresaid pills may be used which you please, and when you please,
therewith to comfort the heart, and defend it from all ill air.

There are also diverse Confections prepared for preservatives, that you may use
in stead of pills, to wit, morning and evening, whereby nature is aided, thereby
the better to withstand the pestilent air.

For these, take Terra sigillata, white Diptamus, fine Bolus, Myrrh, Wormwood,
Rue Scabious, Pimpernel, Sorrel, and Zeduarie, of each a dragme, Aristology,
Tormentill, and Bayberries, of each a dragm and a half, five or six kernels
of Walnuts, ten or twelve new Figs, Mithridate and Treacle, of each an ounce,
Saffron and Camfer, of each a scruple, Unicorns horn, prepared Pearls, bones
of a Stags heart, burnt Hearts horn, and Smaragds, of each one dragme and a
half, peeled seeds of Citrons half an ounce, Mace one dragme: powne all that
is to be powned, and then temper all together with sirupe of Citrons to the
consistence of a confection. This Consection kills all venime of the plague,
and preserves men very maruellously from her infections, if they take thereof
in the morning and evening, to wit, in winter time with a draught of Malmsey,
and in Summer with Rosewater. But if you have not these confections, then use
that of Nuts and Rue, that herebefore is described in the 11..

Another confection that is most excellent: take Juniper berries, Cloves,
Elecampane roots, and Nutmegs, of each one dragme, Aristology and Gentian, of
each three quarters of an ounce, Purslaine and Sorrel seeds, Doronicum, red
and white Behen, Spodium de Canna, bones of a Stags heart, Paradise wood, red

Zeduarie, of each one dragme, Camfer half a dragme, Species Diatriasantalum,
and Diarrhodon, of each two dragmes, Citron peels, Smaragdes, of each a dragme,
Muscus a scruple, Treacle, Diatessaron, and Mitridatium, of each an ounce;
powne all that is to be powned, and hereof make a Confection with sirupe of
Citrons. Item, take conserues of Roses, of Violets, of Burrage and of Buglosse,
of each half an ounce, Smaragde, Iacinct, and Pearls, of each one dragme,
bones of a Stags heart, filed Gold, Citron seeds, fine Bolus, and sealed Earth,
of each half a dragme; powne all that is to be powned, and then make thereof a
confection with sirupe of Citrons.

Another: Take conserve of Roses, of Buglosse, of each an ounce and a half,
Doronicum, bones of a Stags heart, Iacincts, Smaragdes, Saphirs, of each half a
scruple, yellow Saunders, Cinquefoile and Paradise wood, of each three dragmes,
Sugar one ounce, wine of Granado, and sirupe of Limons, of each half an ounce,
ten or twelve gold leaves; then mingle all together to the consistence of a
confection.

Another that is very good and approved: Take conserve of Roses, of Buglosse,
and of Burrage, of each six ounces, Doronicum. Zeduarie, Basil seed, Mace,
Saffron, and Adiantum, of each one dragme, bones of a Stags heart, Iacincts,
Smaragdes, and Saphirs, of each a scryple, Pearls one drag. six leaves of
beaten gold, sirupe of Apples, and of Citron peels, of each two ounces, Violet
water three quarters of an ounce, white Sugar four ounces; sees the sirupe
and Sugar with water enough, till it be as thick as Honey, and afterward
temper the spices therewith: then beat it well together, and put thereto
Rubarb one quarter of an ounce, that has been steeped four and twenty hours
in Malmsey: Lastly add thereto Musk and Amber. of each four greines: this
being done, mingle them all together, and keep it safe (being well stopped) in a
glass.

Item, take Mithridate and Treacle (that at the least is ten years old) of each
half an ounce, Citron seed, and fine Bolus of each half a dragme, Rose water,
with the which Muscus is dissolved) as much as is needful for a confection:
hereof may you use every day one dragme.

Also that are sound and whole, as also those that are infected, may use the
weight of a quarter of an ounce of this confection following, morning and
evening, without any danger: Take Iacincts, Grenades, Smaragds, Saphirs,
Pearls, bones of a Stags heart, and Paradise wood, of each half a dragme, red

all together very small, and then take Sugar six ounces, that is sodden with
Rose water to a sirup: then temper it so thick as you will have it, with
sirupe of Citrons. Men may use also otherwhiles in stead of this confection,
two or three days together, of this drink following, which also is a
wonderful preservative against the plague, and may be used as well of young as
of old folk, yea also of young children, and women with child: Take fine Bolus
a dragme, and a half, beat it to fine powder, and drink it with white wine
and Rosewater, very warm in the morning: and eight days after you must take a
dragme of Treacle or Mithridate, in the winter with wine, and in the summer
with Rosewater.

These foresaid medicines are not only good against the plague to come, but
also against that that has already infected.

And forasmuch as those foresaid confections are made of many costly things,
that may be too dear for the common people: for this cause have we of purpose
described the confection of Nuts and Rue, which they may use in stead of these.
Or take the kernels of Nuts, Rue and Juniper leaves, of each a like quantity;
powne them all well together, and with Vinegar make thereof a confection,
whereof every morning you may take the bigness of a Nutmeg.

In like manner may one also prepare this following: take eight and twenty or
thirty Nut kernels, and forty or two and forty Figs, Wormwood, Rue, Scabious,
and Sorrel, of each half a M. Aristologie two dragmes and a half, Tormentill,
Pimpernel, and white Diptamus of each one dragme, fine Bolus half a dragme,
red and white Coral, Sorrel seeds, of each half a dragme, Citron seeds one
dragme, Juniper berries three dragmes; chop and stamp all that must be stamped,
and hereof with clarified Honey make a confection: hereof may one take at one
time the bigness of a Walnut.

Also make another, which is called ye confection of Juniper berries, as
follows: Take Nut kernels, Juniper berries, of each two ounces, beat them
well together, put thereto four ounces of clarified Honey, and temper with it,
Cinnamom, Ginger, Mace, and Cloves, of each a dragme, white Diptamus,
Tormentill, Zeduarie, Citron peels, Rue, Carduus Benedictus, and S. John's
woort, of each a quarter of an ounce, Cardamome, Paradise wood, black
Coriander, Angelica, white and red Behen, fine Bolus, and sealed Earth, of each
a drag. then mingle them all together. If the quantity of Nut kernels, Juniper
berries, and Honey be too little, then may you take twice so much. And for the
common sort it is also excellent good, that every morning he do take eight or
ten Juniper berries that have been steeped in Vinegar.

Now follow certain powders that preserve men from the Plague: but (as has
been said before) great regard is to be taken in time of the plague, that the
heart may be defended from al pestilent infections as much as is possible. To
this end are all the bouesaid medicines, also many powders, confections,
cordial waters, and other such like, as herafter follow prescribed: Take
Rubies, Granats, Iacincts, Smaragdes, and Saphires, of each half an ounce,
white and red Coral, and shauings of Iuorie, of each three quarters of an

mingle them all together, and then take half an ounce thereof every time.

These following do the Apothecaries call Species liberantes, that are very
much esteemed, and much used at Ausburg, by reason they defend the heart and
all inward parts very maruellously against all venomous air; they are made in
this manner: Take prepared Bolus and sealed Earth, of each three quarters of an

give one dragme of this powder in the winter with wine, and in summer with
Sorrel water.

The Emperors powder against the Plague: Take Pimpernell, Gentian, Tormentill,
Dragon, Rue, Wormwood, Nut kernels, prepared Granats, and Juniper berries, of
each a like much; make them into powder, and use it upon a tosted piece of
bread. If you will make a confection of this powder, then put thereto Rose
vinegar, and Treacle, as much as shall suffice.

Another powder: Take fine prepared Bolus one ounce and a half, Cinnamom one
ounce, Tormentill, and white Diptamus, of each half an ounce, Pimpernell,
Angelica, and Gentian, of each a quarter of an ounce, prepared Coriander three

scruples, Granates, Saphires, Iacincts, Emrods, and Rubies, of each half a
dragme, Spike of Indie three greins, Amber six greines, Musk two greines,
Camfere six greines, Sugar as much as all the rest do weigh: temper them well
together and make them into a subtle powder, and use it as before.

Another like unto this: Take fine Bolus very small beaten two ounces,
Tormentill, Doronicum, Diptamus, and red Saunders, of each one dragme, shaven
Iuorie, burnt Iuorie, and Citron peeles, of each half a drag. Pearls two

of it, then take an ounce and a half of the foresaid powder, and twelve ounces
of Sugar: and when you have taken of it, then drink a draught of Sorrel water
after it.

Montagnana writes, that he never saw any that have died of the plague, which
diligently used this medicine.

Of all these foresaid powders may also Manus Christi, or Sugar cakes be made.
The common custom is to take one ounce and a half of powder, and twelve
ounces of Sugar.

When the Arch Duke Maximilian that now is Emperor of Rome took his journey
into Spain, then was this powder following ordained for him as a preservative
against all bad air: take Zeduarie, Cloves, Nutmegs, Myrtle kernels, Cinnamom,
and Ginger, of each a quarter of an ounce, Gentian, Diptamus, Tormentill,
Elecampane roots, and Aristologie, of each a drag. and a half, Nutmegs, Sage,
Rue, Balm, Pionie seeds, Citron seeds, Sorrel seeds, Basil seeds,

half an ounce, Rosewater and Scabious water, of each three ounces; then mix
with them ten greines of Camfere, and boil them with eight and twenty ounces
of white Sugar to the consistence of a confection: and when the same begins
to be cold, then temper the species with it, and so make Manus Christi of it.

These Sugar cakes following are very common at Heydelborough in high Germany:
Take Species Diamargariton a quarter of an ounce, Liberantes four scruples,
Zeduarie, and Citron peeles, of each one dragme, Doronicum, Angelica, and
Pimpernell, of each half a dragme, Couchenele two scruples, Cinnamom a dragme
and a half, Cloves one dragme, Unicorns horn half a dragme, Smaragdes ten
greines, Muscus two grains, beaten Gold, three leaves, white Sugar nine
ounces: dissolve the Sugar in water wherein red crimson silk is sodden, and
make hereof Manus Christi.

This following do the Physicians call Alexipharmacum, that is, such a medicine
that can expel all manner of venim, and whatsoever else is hurtful to the
body: Take Sallad oil of one hundred years old or more, and if you cannot get
such oil, then boil it until it waxes eager and sharpish, thirty ounces,
Turpentine 3. ounces, ^uphorbium, and Beuercod, of each half a drag. dew or
rain Worms (washed in Wine) half an ounce: afterward put therein eighty or
nintie Scorpions, and in the Dog days take the Adder that is called Vipera cut
in pieces, and let the oil sees in boiling water the space of four hours,
afterward set it ten days in the hot sun. This being all done, add to it
Zeduarie, Gentian, Tormentil, white Diptamus, Aristologie, and Rubarbe, of each
half an ounce, Hollihocke leaves, Saint John's woort, Daneweede, and Rosemarie,
of each half a handful. Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce; then
powne all that is to be powned, and temper them together; and then being close
stopped, bury it in horse dung for the space of three months. Lastly, press it
through a strong strainer, and all that you can get out shall you reserve in a
pelter bottell.

This medicine must be used in manner as follows: to wit, that you take it
cold, and not warm. It suffiseth also to anoint the heart, the pulses, and the
temples of the head but thrice a day, leaving two hours only between every
iuunction.

At Pisa is a custom that the Magistrates every year give to the University
two prisoners that have deserved death for to anatomize, which is a good means
to prove this medicine. When as they give unto one of these prisoners one
scruple of Rats bane, and eight hours before his death anoint him with this
salve as is aforesaid; then find they indeed that such men might afterward
live five days longer. These foresaid receipts have been of others described
but falsely.

This mixture following is highly commended to anoint withal: Take Amber
half a dragme, Annis seed half a scruple, Paradise wood, Laudanum, red and
white Behen, of each a quarter of an ounce, Mace, and Citron peels, of each two
dragmes and a half, Nutmegs, white Coral, red and white Saunders, of each one
dragme, beaten Gold six leaves, Basil water, water of Saffron flowers, and
Rosewater wherein Musk is dissolved, of each five ounces, Vinegar two
spoonefuls, Malmsey two ounces; temper them well together a great while, and
anoint oftentimes the pulses therewith, the temples of the head and the face,
and reserve it being stopped very close.

In Saxony they have a salt of Wormwood, called Sal Absynthij, which will free
and defend men from the plague without any further care.

We will also here describe certain drinks against the plague: First, it is
not unknown what power there is in the compounded Aqua vitae against the
plague, and against al venimes, as is sufficiently rehearsed in the eight part.

An approved water: Take Tormentill, Valerian, Pimpernell, Dragon, Diptamus,
Sealed earth, fine Bolus, dry Vinegar dregs, and long Pepper, of each half an
ounce, Saffron a drag. Amber half a drag. Treacle one ounce, Nux vomica, and
Carduus Benedictus, of each three quarters of an ounce; pown them all small
together, and power as much thin white wine upon them as you please; let it so
stand four days, and of this drink a spoonefull at once, sweat upon it, and
fast five hours after it.

For the common people you may prepare this following: Take Valerian, the roots
of great Burs Bardana, Diptamus of Candy, Gentian, Bistorta, Tormentill, and
Pimpernell, of each a like much: beat all together grossly, and power Aqua
vitae upon it as much as will cover it; insolate it fourteen days long,
stirring it about every day. This being done, then must you not take above a
spoonefull of it at once. Also you may distill it, and use it by it self: but
by my counsel this should not be used in Summer.

This drink following has been approved of many thousands: Take in May the
roots of great Burs, called Bardana sixteen ounces, of the middle rind of the
Ash tree two M. chop it small together, and distill it: give of this water to
drink three or four ounces, to wit, when he is thought to be infected of the
plague: it is also wonderful good against all biting of mad Dogs.

Another: Take Rue, Wormwood, Roses, and Juniper berries, of each a handful,
twenty or twenty five kernels of Nuts; stamp these all together to pap, power
wine and vinegar thereon of each one pint and stop it right: then let it sees
in Balneo four and twenty hours: this being done, then strain it, and of
this give every morning fasting two spoonefuls to drink. Item, take fifteen
or sixteen heads of Leekes, peele off the uppermost shales, and stamp them
small, and afterward mix thin white wine with them, and vinegar of Rue, of
each a good pint or a pint and a half, and good Treacle one ounce, and keep it
close stopped in a glass. And when you will use it, then give thereof a spoonful
or twain to drink in the morning betimes. It drives out sweat, and
expels venomous air. This sirupe following is highly commended: Take Citron
peels, roots of Capers, Verueine, red Saunders, and burnt Iuorie, of each a
quarter of an ounce, Cloves, Buglosse, Balm, Burrage, Calmus, of each half an
ounce, Sorrel, Liuerwoort, and Mallows, of each three drag. Cicory seeds,
Melon seeds, seeds of Pompeons, Gourds, of Cucumbers, and Violets, of each 2.
ounces, Thymus, Epithymus, of Polypodie; Mirobalani Chebuli, and yellow
Mirobalanes, of each one ounce, Agaricus and Rubarb of each half an ounce, the
juice of Fumitorie, of Wormwood, of Daneweede, and of broad Plantaine, of each
six ounces, the juice of Quinces eighteen ounces, Diagridium a quarter of an
ounce, white Sugar twenty four ounces; make hereof a sirupe: and when it is
almost sufficiently decocted, then power thereto four ounces of the juice of
Quinces, and then let it boil till his consistence. This sirupe is marvelous
good in the time of the plague; for it dries the body moderatly, and cleanses
also the same of all superfluous humors: it strengthens the heart, the liver,
and also the inward parts: You may take of it one ounce and a half, or two
ounces every week with the water of Buglosse, early in the morning, and then
to sleep thereupon a while, or at the least to lie still an hour after it.

Hitherto have we described many medicines, whereby the healthie (in time of
the plague) may be preserved. All these things must be used in good order, like
as these medicines following also, to wit, that you use sometimes the one, and
sometimes the other, and not always one and the self same, that nature not
accustom her self to it, and in the end do think the remedy to be rather a
food than a medicine, so that it by that means cannot have her operation.

The sixteenth Chapter. When any are infected with the Plague.
NOw this Chapter shall only entreat of those that are already infected with
ye Plague, be it by what means soever they have first gotten the same; as with
Agues, swellings, plague sore, or such like.

Of the Ague in the Plague.. 1.
THe Plague commonly comes always first with an Ague, whereupon presently
follows the Tokens or Carbuncles.

Of the causes of these twain has been spoken before; whereby it has also
been said, that in the time of heat, as in the Dog days (when the heat of
man is drawn inward) that the heart as then is inflamed through an unnatural
manner of heat: then also the outward air (wherein we continually abide)
increases the heat, and the heart is so set on fire, that the heat spreads
over the whole body, and thereby quickly causes a pestilent Ague, especially
if there be such humors in the body that are subject to inflammation, but if
the body be not thereto inclined, then can there be no cause (how violent
soever it be) of such infection.

Of the signs whereby this sickness is known.. 2.
EVuen as all other sicknesses have their certain signs, whereby they are
known, so is it with this venomous ague, which manifests her self with
seven kinds of accidents: whereof the first is, an unnatural cold and shaking,
whereupon straight way follows a great heat; albeit the same oftentimes
alters, so that sometime first the heat and afterward the cold insueth.
Secondly, let this happen howsoever it will, there follows always after it a
great and intolerable thirst. Thirdly, bitterness and vnsauorines of the
mouth. Fourthly, loss of appetite. Fifthly, heaviness of all parts of the body,
with wearisomnes and sleep. Sixthly, a binding of the body and the going to
the stool by constraint, and with great stench: the urine also comes with a
great quantity and stinketh much: lastly, bereauing of sleep. And albeit
these foresaid signs manifest sufficiently the violence that nature suffers,
it is to be wondered at nevertheless that at the first neither by the nature
and quality of the ague, nor by the pulse, nor by the urine this infection is
to be discerned, for it often happens that the urine of all men so infected is
very like the urine of the sound, and that the heat is also much slower and
obscurer than that of any other agues, and the pulse also quiet and scant to be
felt.

Now when all these signs or any of them shall appear, or that there be a
plague sore, or other signs mo, then all ancient and later Physicians
conclude with one consent; that there is nothing more profitable and requisite
than that the patient do sweat well, and be dealt withal, as hereafter
follows.

By what means the patient is provoked to sleep.. 3.
FIrst, they ordain these confections following, whereof shall be taken the
quantity of an hasell nut: Take one ounce of Treacle, Pimpernell, Gentian,
Bistorta, Tormentill, Sage, Rue, Wormwood, Juniper berries, and Nut kernels, of
each one dragme, stamp them all together, and then with vinegar make it into a
confection. Or use this confection following, called Bezoarctica, one dragme,
warmed in Sorrel water, or in water of Carduus Benedictus, at what time soever
you will, and then cover him very well, and let him sweat three or four
hours (if he be able) for the more he sweateth, the better hope is there of
his recovery. But if the patient be under the age of twelve years, yet above
five years, then must you give him half a dragm, and further deal as is
abouesaid. It is also needful, if the patient may abide it, that he sweat
morning and evening, this confection is made as follows: Take of the best
Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce, Pimpernell and Angelica, of
each ten greines, Cardamome five greines, Camfer three greines, Cinnamom ten
greines, put them all together. But if you have none of this confection at
hand, then a dragme of Treacle or Mithridate with any of the foresaid waters,
or take of the golden Egg, which is described after two manner of ways, as
follows:

Take a new laid Hen egg, and make a little hole in the top that the white may
issue out, The golden Egg.
and the yolke tarry within, then fill it up with good powdered Saffron, and
shut too the hole on the top again with the white of ye egg and egshell, then
roast it by a mild fire so long as the shell will hold, and that it be all
clean brown. This being done, take off the shell, and powne the inner part
very small, then mingle it with white Mustard seeds, Diptamus, and Tormentill,
of each a quarter of an ounce, Nux vomica a dragme: lastly, add good Treacle
to it in weight as heavy as all the rest, then temper it all together two or
three hours together, and make hereof a hard confection, which men call the
golden Egg, and will remain good twenty or thirty years.

The second: Take all that is before rehearsed except the quantity of the
Treacle, and put thereto Angelica, Pimpernell, Zeduarie, Camfer, and good
Treacle, of each as much as of the other, and that in weight: but I think that
there is too much Camfer, and too little Treacle.

Whereas it is not a little auailable to know how this confection is to be
used, therefore you shall understand, that whenever this sickness first
begins with cold, then must you (if it be a man) before that twelve hours
be past, give to him the weight of a duckat, to a woman as much as a Rhenish
gildern wayeth, and a child or boy half as much, with a small wine. But if this
sickness takes one with heat, then take in the place of wine water of Cicorie,
or if you cannot get it, then take half wine half vinegar, and sweat upon
it. This confection may be used at all times against all bad humors and venime,
yet then must the Nux vomica be left out.

In the fifth part, the twelfth Chapter 1.. is likewise showed how to provoke
sweat. The ancient Physicians accustomed to use this powder following for to
cause sweat: take Valerian roots three quarters of an ounce, Gentian, white
Diptamus, and dry Rue, of each one ounce, good Saffron one dragm, red Coral,
and Mace, of each a dragme and a half, temper it, and powne it all together,
and give one dragme thereof with a draught of wine.

A marvelous oil for to procure sweat: Take a glass bottell as big as you
will, fill the same half full of Elder flowers, and put thereon the third part
of Hollihock flowers, or flowers of Ebulus, and again thereupon a third part of
the flowers of S. John's woort, so that with these three things the glass be
full: this being done, power thereon old Sallad oil (the older the better) and
at last stop it very close, and so let it stand all the Somer a sunning with
this oil must you rub the body very warm three or four times a day. It has
been approved, that this oil through the abundant sweat that it provoke,
expels all contagion of the Plague.

Here follow now Diaphoreticall potions: Take Rue, Wormwood, and the uppermost
tops of the Black berries, of each a handful, Celandine a handful and a
half: power thereon a pint of Vinegar, afterward stop the pot very close that
there come out no vapor, and then let the third part sees away; then strain
it out, and keep it close stopped, and when any are infected with the Plague, or
in any wise poisoned, then give him of this drink, to wit, two or three
ounces, and let him sweat after it, and not sleep at all.

The water of Geranium is also very good against all venime, and therefore good
to be used in time of the Plague, whether there appear any swelling or any
other accidents or not.

Some also commend this composition following to be an especial remedy, and
it is indeed not to be disdained. Take a great Onion, cut off the top, and make
a hole therein, and then fill him with Treacle and the juice of Rue and
Vinegar, of each one dragme, then close the top too again with the piece
which you clipped and cut off, and fasten it with two sticks, and wind it in well
towe: this being done, roast it in the hot ashes till it be very mellow,
afterward stamp it to pap, and then strain it through a cloth, and it will be
a broth, then preserve this broth till time of need. If one then be found that
he be poisoned, then give him a dragm thereof, and hold tosted bread sprinkled
with vinegar before his nose that he cast it not up again, and let him lie
down on the bed that he may sweat. But it is to be noted, that sleep in
sweating is forbidden and hurtful, wherefore the patient shall not sleep till
the sweat be gone, that the venim hasten not toward the vital parts,
afterward he may sleep, that he wax not impotent and weak, yet he is
otherwhiles to be awaked. And if the age or might of the patient will permit
it, then ought he to be let blood, that the contagious matter which corrupts
the blood, and hurts the principal parts, might be let out, and the
inflammation lessened.

Herein do many Physicians and Barbers dote and err very absurdly, which
straight way as soon as they suppose it to be the Plague, not perceiving any
sign thereof, begin their cure with letting of blood. For albeit that it may
not be delayed too long, yet ought it not rashly to be done by reason of the
former causes.

When the patient thus sweateth, then must the same be wiped from his face with
a cloth, and hold before his nose rose Vinegar, Rose water, and such like: also
let the air of the chamber be cleansed and perfumed with fire or sprinkled
with Vinegar; but especial heed must be taken that the sweat strike not
again into the body. As he has now sweat well and is wiped clean, then must
he be laid in another bed: for the exchange of beds is very good; for thereby
they are the less infectious, which otherwise increases still more and more,
and is more hurtful for the diseased person.

Some are of opinion that the patient should not take any thing within an hour
after his sweat, that nature first might be able to endure and bear it the
better.

Besides the ayring and sprinkling of the chamber, it is good counsel for the
rich, that there be a cloth wetted in Rosewater, and hanged in the night before
the bed of the patient; and when it is dry that it be moistened again.

How to comfort those that are infected with the Plague.. 4.
FOr as much as there are many causes in this sickness whereby the patient may
be weakened, which the disease of it self brings with it, as great heat,
much watching, thirst, pain, sweat, and such like things mo: wherefore good
regard must be had how the heart might be comforted, and natural strength be
maintained: for the which this water following is ordained for the common sort
of people, which not only strengthens, but also drives out the sweat: Take
new distilled water of the kernels of Nuts four ounces, powdered Verueine one
dragme, good Treacle, two scrup. Saffron seven greines: then mingle it all
together, and so give it warm.

It profits much also that the patient always have in his hand odoriferous
things, wherewith the heart, the brains, and all inward parts may be
comforted, and the bad vapors taken away; for the which this Pomander following
is very commodious.

Take red, white, and yellow Saunders, and Roses, of each one dragme, Saffron,
and Campher, of each one scruple, Musk, and Amber, of each five greines; then
make hereof a Pomander with Dragagant that is dissolved in Rosewater, and then
bind it in red sarsnet as is before mentioned.

Of these Pomanders, as well hot as cold of nature are herebefore diverse
described, where we have treated of the preservation of the healthie. And these
sweating patients must not abstain from meat, for that the emptiness of the
stomach is very hurtful for them; and what meat and drink is good for them,
that shall be showed hereafter. If the sick person be so weak and feeble that
he may not be let blood nor purged, then give unto him this drink following,
that shall do him good: Take white Diptamus, Tormentill, white Coral, Gentian,
fine Bolus, Sealed earth, and Verueine, of each one dragme, beat them all very
small together, and take thereof one quarter of an ounce, good Treacle one
dragm, juice of Scabious four ounces, Vinegar half an ounce. But if you
cannot get the juice, then take the water of Nut kernels, and let him drink it
warm: yet in winter give him wine in stead of these waters. The next day give
to the patient fine Bolus tempered with as much conserve of Roses, and four
ounces of Scabious water after it. Sometimes also must the common pills be used.

There is also to be made this cordial confection as follows: Take prepared
Rubies, Iacincts, Granats, Smaragdes, fine Bolus, Pearls, bones of Stags heart,
fine filed gold, and small filed Unicorns horn, of each one scruple, raw silk
that is cut very small, Roses, Amber, Citron peels, and shaven Iuorie, of each
half a dragme, white Sugar dissolved in the juice of Limons as much as you
please, sees the same as thick as honey, and mingle the rest amongst it to a
confection. Give this to the patient two or three dragmes with fresh broth, for
it strengthens marvelous much all the vital parts, it resists all
vapors, and breaks the force of the Ague.

In like manner there are cordial waters to be outwardly applied, whereof some
shall be showed hereafter.

Take Rosewater sixteen ounces, water of Endive, Buglosse, Nightshade, Baulme,
and of Sorrel, of each eight ounces, Vinegar, and good white Wine, of each
three ounces, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each one quarter of an ounce,
Coral, and Roses, of each one dragm, burnt Iuorie, Saffron and Camfere, of
each half a dragme, then mingle them all together, and so wetting in it a
double cloth, lay it over the heart.

Or take water of Buglosse, and of Sorrel, of each three ounces, water of
Willow leaves, Roses, Wormwood, Grass, Baulme, and of the wild Vine leaves, of
each two ounces, Spec. Cordialium temperatarum a dragme and a half, Saffron
eight greines, Myrrh, Diptamus, Gentian, Paradise wood, yellow Saunders,
Basil seed, red and white Behen, Iacincts, and Smaragdes, of each half a
scruple, juice of Limons three ounces, Vinegar one ounce, Malmsey five ounces,
put them all together.

Item, take the water of Buglosse, of Scabious, Violets, and of Burrage, of
each sixs ounces, Rosewater wherein Musk is dissolved eight ounces, Specierum
Cordialium one ounce and a half, Camfere half a scruple, white Coral four
scruples, prepared Pearls a dragme and a half, beaten Gold eight leaves,
Malmsey four ounces.

Note that you must temper the water and the Malmsey together: and when you
have taken twelve ounces of the same, then must you take a dragme of this
powder and mix with it, and use it as is before rehearsed.

Another: Take Sorrel water, and Carduus Benedictus water four ounces, Vinegar
of Gilloflowers one ounce, Species de gemmis frigidis a quarter of an ounce,
Saffron two greines, Camfere five greines, Malmsey half an ounce, temper them
all together.

When as these cordial waters are laid on the heart, then may you anoint the
sick bodies left breast pap with this salve following: Take one ounce of the
best Treacle, juice of Limons, and of Vinegar, of each half an ounce, Saffron,
and Camfere, of each one scruple; then mingle them together, and spread it on a
cloth or on a red crimson clout.

This following is stronger: Take good Treacle two ounces, Rubarbe, and
Carlina, of each one drag. and a half, old oil of Olive twelve ounces, forty
or 45. Scorpions: powne all that is to be powned, and then let it sees in
water in a pot alone five or six hours long; afterward strain it through a
cloth, and first anoint the heart, the pulses, and the temples of the head.
Afterward he must be anointed upon all outward signs or sores of the Plague,
and at the last round about the neck: and this anointing must be done once
every six hours very warm: the chamber must also be kept fumed and
continually sprinkled.

We have also made mention herebefore in the sixth part, the second chapter, and
tenth. and shortly after in the Ague Hectica of many things wherewith sick
folks are to be comforted and revived.

What is to be done after sweating.. 5.
WHen as the patient has sweat, is wiped, and laid in fresh bedding, then do
some counsel to give him out of hand one dragme of fine Bolus, to wit, with
Rose water if a great heat be adioined, or with wine if without heat, and
that not at one time only, but every day: but it imports very much whether
you have the right fine and orient Bolus or not, for there are many kinds of
earths used in stead of it.

Further, let him take immediately after his sweating, to wit, three mornings
(one after another) of these sirupes following, for the cooling of these hot
agues, to warm the same first in hot water, and in case that he afterward
feel a sweating again, then let him forthwith continue in his sweat if he
can abide it.

Take sirupes of Limons one ounce, sirupe of Citrons half an ounce, water of
Carduus Benedictus, of Sorrel, and of Burrage, of each one ounce, mix them
all together for a potion.

And if so be that after the use of these three potions the patient should be
purged (which in this ague is seldom needful) then must it be done with this
following:

Take of the common plague pills ten greins less than a dragme, and ten greines
of Agaricus, Rubarbe one scruple, then make hereof small pills, and give them
all to the patient at one time.

Another regiment when any one is infected with the Plague.. 6.
FIrst, these pills following are to be given to the patient in the morning
betimes: Take of the common plague pills a dragme and a half, that are formed
with sirupe of Citrons, and then let the patient (if the infirmity may bear
it) sleep afterward a little: the next day after shall he three or four
days after other always in the morning betimes, take a dragme and a half of
fine Bolus powdered either with wine or with Rose water, as the time of the
year requires. This is a marvelous good medicine and without all danger, but
only that it somewhat binds the body, which may be prevented with mild
Clisters, which must be made of oil only.

It is not amiss for this intent to use these confections following every
other day, which strengthen the body, and make it sound: Take good Treacle one
dragm, prepared Smaragdes seven greines, then mingle it with wine, and so give
it him.

But if the party can hardly take this, then let him use one of these Sugar
plates following: Take Iacincts, Granats, Rubies, Smaragdes, Saphires, and
bones of the Stags heart, of each one dragme, red and white Saunders, and red
Coral^, of each one scruple, burnt Iuorie, fine Bolus, prepared Pearls, Sealed
earth, and Unicorns horn, of each four scruples, filed gold one dragme,
Sugar sod in Rosewater sixteen ounces, make it up into Manus Christi, or Sugar
plates, and take two or three dragmes of them at one time.

As soon as the patient feels himself infected, let him presently take this
potion following, and if he vomit not the same up again, but sweateth after
it, then it is a good sign of amendment, and a manifest token of health.

Take white Diptamus, Tormentill, white Coral, Gentian, fine Bolus, Sealed
earth, and burnt Hearts horn, of each one dragme, Smaragdes, Camfer, and
prepared Pearls, of each half a dragm, Myrrh, Saffron, and Citron seeds, of
each one scruple: beat all very small, and take of it a quarter of an ounce,
Treacle a dragme and a half, Sorrel water, and good white wine, of each one
ounce and a half, mix them for a potion, and give it to the patient warm
lying in his bed, that he may sweat well, and that as long as he may suffer
it: afterward wipe him well, and lay him in another bed. But if the time of
the year be cold, and the Ague not very hot, then may you put the more wine
to the foresaid potion: and contrariwise, if it be hot weather, and the Ague
hot also, then let Sorrel water be mingled therewith.

But special care must be had that the patient cast not up the potion agine,
for the which it is good, that there be a great cup set under his stomach,
without opening the skin, and some good savor be holden before his nose, his
hands dipped in cold water, or smell to tosted bread that is moistened with
Vinegar, and such like things mo.

Some forbid that men in sweating shall neither eat or drink; which were
somewhat indeed if the patient be strong enough: but when he is feeble, then
have you for this a good direction before.

How to purge those that are infected with the Plague.. 7.
IN the end of the foresaid fifth. we have declared, that purging for this
sickness is not greatly commended: nevertheless if great need require, then is
there nothing more fit than the common plague pills, with somewhat tempered
therewith. This potion following may also be given him with all safety, for
that it does cleanse the blood of all superfluities: Take of the confection
Triphera Persica and Manna, of each three quarters of an ounce, Rubarbe one
dragme, then mingle them together in four ounces of Sorrel water. Or take
Cassie and sour Dates, of each three quarters of an ounce, Confection of the
juice of Roses one dragme, then temper them together with Sorrel water.

Item, take Tripheram Persicam half an ounce, prepared Agaricke and Rubarbe,
of each one dragme, and mingle them as before.

Another. Take the confection Diasena and Triphera Persica of each three
dragms, Confectionis Hamech a quarter of an ounce, de succo Rosarum half a
dragme, mingle them with the decoction of fruits, or with Buglosse water.

But if the patient be so feeble that you dare not give him a purging medicine,
then let him have a Clister of fresh broth or herbs, with Cassy, the yolk of an
Eg, course Sugar, oil of Violets and salt. For all such diseases are the
Conserve of Burrage and Buglosse very commodious, even as they are also for all
pestilent Agues, for they are both very comfortable; they revive the heart,
resist venime, take away all weakness, make men glad, and cleanse the blood.

We have before in the fourth. written of other things mo that also do comfort
the patient. This shall suffice that we have spoken of the beginning of the
Plague: we will now proceed and make mention of other accidents of these
diseases, and teach their due remedies.

Of the unnatural heat in the Plague.. 8.
AMongst the other seven accidents of this contagion (that we have heretofore
spoken of, and are always permanent with the pestilent Agues) there is
commonly great headache adjoined. Now to strengthen the head and brains, have
we set down many goodly instructions and directions, in the first part, the
first chapter,. 2. and also afterward in the headache of heat.

This potion following may you use for the same: Take Tormentill, burnt Hearts
horn, red Coral, and fine Bolus, of each one dragme, prepared Pearls half a
dragm, Camfer four greines; beat them all together to powder, and then give
thereof the weight of a drag. tempered with Sorrel water. For this also
serves this Iulep following: take the juice of Balm, of Burrage, Buglosse,
Sorrel and of Cicorie, of each one ounce and a half, Rosewater and white
Vinegar, of each three quarters of an ounce, the juice of Citrons or Limons
half an ounce, Sugar as much as you please: sees the sugar to a sirupe, and
when you will use the same, temper it with Barley water unto a Iulep. Or take
Conserve of Roses four ounces, conserve of Buglosse two ounces, Species
Triasantali one ounce and a half, burnt Iuorie, Sorrel, Melon seeds, peeled
Gourd seeds, Citron seeds and Cucumber seeds peeled, and chopped small of each
one ounce and a half, Sugar one ounce, Pearls four scruples, and six leaves
of beaten gold; then temper them well together for a confection: hereof may the
patient use as often as he will.

For this also is good the Conserues of Burrage and Buglosse, of water Lillies,
of the juice of Oranges, and all that therewith may be made.

Of the insatiable and great thirst.. 9.
THe second accident of these pestilent Agues is thirst, that by little and
little gets the upper hand, so that the diseased falling into a frenzines
thereby, seek to leap into the water, or into wels, thereby to cool
themselves, and quench their thirst.

To cool the same, and to allay it, you may use this Iulep following: Take
water of Sorrel, of Scabious, of water Lillies, and of Endive, of each six
ounces, Granado wine four ounces, Vinegar two ounces, the juice of Limons two
ounces and a half, white Sugar as much as you will; sees it for a Iulep, and
then let the patient drink hereof as much as he thinks good. Another: Take
Buglosse water, and of Sorrel, of each six ounces, water of Cicorie, Endive,
and Willow leaves, of each four ounces, sirupe of Citrons two ounces, sirupe
of Vinegar, and of Oxysacchara, of each one qunce, Granado wine eight ounces:
let them boil a little all together, except the Granado wine: this being
clarified, put the Granado wine unto it. In like manner is also good the sirupe
of Citrons, Limons, S. John's grapes, or berries, Roses and Endive, being
mingled with some cooling water; or else with well water or Barley water. Item,
Well water which has been once distilled: but above all things that can be
devised, is nothing better to quench the thirst, to withstand poison, to
comfort the heart, than the juice of Limons or the same being pared, and cut in
slices, and strewed over with Sugar, and so to use them, and to take the liquor
of them with a spoone.

Item take Quince kernels one ounce, let them mollify one whole night in eight
ounces of Sugar water, then strain them: this being done, then temper
therewith one ounce of the sirupe of water Lillies, and oftentimes use it.

As for the thirst, you have diverse remedies thereto in the third part, the
twelfth Chapter, and 10.. which are altogether very good. And afterward yet
more, to wit, in the seventeenth Chapter in Diabete, aad also in the
description of the Agues.

Of the bitterness in the mouth.. 10.
THe third accident is the bitterness of the mouth, which proceeds of an
inflammation of the Gall, whereof we have written more at large in three other
places, to wit, in the third part, the eleventh Chapter, and sixth. Also in the
fifteenth Chapter, and tenth. Item again, in the third part, the twelfth
Chapter, and sixteenth. in which places you may read it. All such patients
must often hold the leaves of Sorrel in their mouths, or chew the seeds of
the same.

They may also very well hold in their mouth Gum Arabiack, and swallow it down
by little and little.

Of the want of Appetite to meat.. 12.
THe fourth accident in this Ague is the loss of appetite: whereas this
sickness requires that the patient in this malady, more than in any other,
should be fed and kept in full strength and power; therefore it is needful in
this disease, that the appetite be stirred up: whereof we in the third Chapter,
and fifth. and before that in the third part, the eleventh Chapter, and ninth.
have treated at length.

Especially you may prepare this stomachicall unguent for it: Take Marmalade
two ounces, Mastick, Spica of Indy, Roses, red Coral, of each one dragme,
Agaricus one dragme and a half, beat them well all together, and then anoint
the stomach therewith, or lay it on plaisterwise. Make also these Sugar plates
following: take Marmalade made with Sugar two ounces, burnt Iuorie, Mastick,
water Lilly flowers, and Roses, of each one scruple; rub the Marmalade in a
mortar with sirupe of Citrons, and form the cakes of the weight of half an
ounce: then take hereof at all times, to wit, morning and evening.

Of the weakness and sleepiness.. 12.
THe fifth accident: Albeit we know well that nature grievously strives with
this malady, and thereby is wearied, weakened, and void of all strength, that
is no wonder: for that cause it is highly commanded that men must have
especial regard to the strength of the patient, for the which also are diverse
means set down how to preserve his strength: so that it is needless to
rehearse the same at this present. Also it has been showed in the fifth Part,
the seventeenth Chapter, and in mo other places.

Of the binding in the body.. 13.
THe sixth accident is the binding of the body, which is augmented by the
heat. And to remedy the same are no strong things required, for strong
purgations are not good in this sickness; yet if great need be, you have had
before in the seventh. also in the third part, eleventh Chapter, and 20.. of
the binding in the body diverse fit remedies, amongst which many easy and
^ooling purgations may be chosen: wherefore those that will cure this sickness,
let them beat 4. ounces of Sebestes, and steep them in water, and then give
to the patient many times of it to drink. But if you will have it more
forcible, then steep with them the leaves of the lesser Iuie.

Of the loss of sleep.. 14.
NOw the seventh accident of these pestilent Agues is loss of sleep. For this
must you take Violets, water Lilly and Elecampane roots, of each one drag.
seeds of Dill and Saffron, of each one scruple; make them into powder, then
bind them up in silk, and hold it continually before the nose, and smell to
it. But of this have you further discourse in the fifth part, the twelfth
Chapter, and sixth. the which you may read over, and use it for this purpose.

When a Plague sore appears.. 15.
WHen these foresaid means have been used, and that there appear a Plague
sore, then must you follow such things, as hereafter shall be set down: but
before we entreat of that, it is not demanded in vain whence this Plague sore
Anthrax proceeds, and of what nature it is: whereof the learned do write in
this manner:

Anthrax proceeds of gross and hot humors: which when they begin to
putrify, then do they alter into a very hurtful poison: sometimes it is red,
otherwhiles yellow and sometimes black, which is the very woorst and most
venomous. For this manifests that nature is not strong enough to expel the
venomous matter into the utmost and furthest parts, whence of necessity
follows, that the foresaid venomous humors are dispersed in the noble parts
of the body inwardly. To remedy the same you shall begin with the letting of
blood, and that upon the same side where the Plague sore is: Afterward you
must use boxing and prick the same deep, whereby the gross blood may be
drawn out: Lastly, you must purge the patient with some of these foresaid
purgations, that are set down before in the seventh. And special heed is to
be taken, that for this Plague sore men lie not thereon (as men use to do in
other swellings, that the matter might be repelled) but attractiue things are
to be used in this, for to draw the matter outward, and that chiefly in the
only place of the plague sore.

In like manner you must lay no hot nor moist thing thereon, that engender
matter or corruption, but rather such things as dry greatly, and are
reasonable cold by nature, that they may slake the heat, and hinder the vapor
thereof.

But if that there appear any redness in any place of the body that would
not impostumate, then are you to use these things following: Take the inside of
a Radish, the Radish leaves, Elderne flowers, and Bayberries, of each half a
handful; sees them all together to pap, and then put half an ounce of white
Mustard seed amongst it, afterward make a soft plaster thereof, and lay it
on the rednes. Item, take a black Cockrell, pluck him alive over all his
belly, and then bind his belly over the rednes, or over the swelling, for the
natural warmth of the bird will draw out the venime into him. Other slit his
belly alive, and so lay it thereon living. Or take a living Pullet, cut him up
underneath, and so bind him open against the swelling: hold the head in thy
hand, and so let him die. Then shortly after take another, and do as before.
Further lay thereon ripening things and cure it, as the other swellings. Some
lay thereon live Frogs.

Or take beaten Tormentill and Ginger, of each a like quantity, and put
thereto as much Treacle: afterward put it into an Onion made hollow, and roast
the same in a mild fire, or amongst the ashes: lastly, stamp it to pap, and
stir three yolks of Eggs amongst it, and then lay it thereon.

And the better to draw out the rednes and swelling, the old Physicians
accustomed to make a plaster of Elderne leaves, of Scabious with the roots,
(to wit, of each alike) and to mingle the same with leaven, and so lay it
thereon.

Some do counsel also that you may temper therewith Salt, salt Peter, and
Comfrey. And if you will have it yet stronger, then are you to put powned
Mustard seed thereto, and in like manner Pigeon dung, for that draws out the
swelling exceedingly, and makes it great, all which aforesaid things you must
often cause to be renewed.

This next following has very great force to draw out the venime: Take coals
of the Tillet tree, and make them glowing hot, afterward sprinkle them with
wine and vinegar: when as they are slaked, then bind them warm in a cloth that
is wetted in the foresaid vinegar and wine, and wrung out again, then lay
these coals warm thereon, and when as the cloth is waxen yellow, then put it
away, and take another.

Item, take the roots of Crowfoote bruised small, and apply it on the place
where the pain is, and the venime shall be drawn out very much. Others do use
this thing following, which is also marvelous good to draw out the Anthrax,
that is, the Plague sore. Take a great Onion wherein Treacle is roasted (as is
lately taught) or lay thereon a plaster of Oxycroceum, which is always sound
ready at the Apothecaries, and temper as much Diachilon cum gummis thereto.
You may also make this plaster of leaven, Elderne flowers, and Treacle
tempered together: for as it is admonished, this Treacle is above all other
things to be commended for this sickness, both inward and outward. Also all
Chirurgians are here to be admonished, that they have care to open these
swellings before they be maturated, be it by the actual cauterie, or by
incision, and that they hold open the same as long as is possible.

Item, the foresaid plaster of Diachilon only is also very good for to
maturate and ripen it.

Or take the common plaster Diachilon three dragmes, and the juice of
Celandine, and make thereof a salve with a little wax. Or sees Colewoorts with
a little Bacon, and lay that thereon, and when you see that the swelling
begins to impostumate, then are you to use these plasters, salues, and other
things following: Take Hollihocke roots, Scabious, and Mallows, as much as
need requires, sees it, and stamp it all together to pap, and make thereof
with Barrowes grease a mild plaster. Or temper wheat meal with Sallad oil
till it be a pap, and lay the same thereon.

Another: Take Mallows, Hollihocke roots, Linseed, beaten altogether, and
wheaten meal, of each alike much; sees them all together, and powne it to
grout: then mingle it well with Saffron, and so lay it warm thereon. Now when as
the swelling is once maturated, then you must open it out of hand, be it with
an actual or potentiall cauterie, or by incision, and so keep the same open.
In the mean time while this swelling is a healing and runs as yet, you must
daily give the patient a spoonful or twain of Scabious water, or Rosewater
with fine Bolus, and sometimes de Species liberantes, that thereby the poison
may be expelled from the heart. This plaster following does also ripen very
much: Take the middlemost rinds of Elderne, stamp them very small, and temper
them with white Vinegar, afterward strain them through a cloth, and put
thereto white Mustard seed beaten, but not too much, for it is very sharp,
and make a pap thereof, and lay it on the swelling. Some suppose that this
swelling of the Plague does ripen much if one rub it over by day and night with
a Sapphire stone: but they that have proved it, and found it to be true, may
write prob^tum est.

If the Plague sore be of a very bad nature, then must the same be burnt out of
hand, or a corrasiue laid thereon: but if it be of no malign nature, and not
too hard, then must you use drying things that cor^ode not.

Others bind Pullets or young Pigeons upon it; and after that they have set
cups or Horseleeches thereon, wherewith they intend to draw out the venime, to
strengthen the part, and to allay the pain.

Some have also for a custom, when as the Plague sore does show it self any
where, that they make an issue with a corrasiue on some place of the patients
leg, and keep the same open, whereby al venomous matters thereby might have
their course. When as now the Plague reigns throughout a whole realm or
country, then is it no bad counsel to do the same, when the patient has first
been purged: and the same may be done on the right leg, four fingers broad
under the knee, on the outside of the leg. And this also is good for them that
are troubled with the Gout. You may use also in stead of the actual or
potentiall cauterie these salues following: take Cantharides two ounces and a
half (the heads and wings plucked thereof) pown them small to powder, and temper
it with one ounce of Barrowes grease, molten wax, and honey, of each half an
ounce, Camfer and Dragon blood, of each a drag. and a half. This being well
mingled, you must then spread thereof as much as will cover half a Doller upon
a cloth, and lay it over the place where the plaguefore appears, and it will
in six or seven hours draw a blister, then open the same that the matter may
run out. This being done, let not the patient sleep in ten or twelve hours,
nor drink wine in three days. And for as much as through these accidents
there is commonly great anguish and pain, then you must for allaying thereof
use this potion: take Treacle and Mithridate, of each half a drag. juice of
Scabious four ounces, temper them all together, and give it the patient to
drink meetly warm.

Now for to kill the plaguesore: Take two or three yolks of new laid Eggs,
and temper therewith about half an ounce of powned salt, and lay it thereon new
every quarter of an hour. This reiterating must be so often done, because
these plasters are infected themselves through the venime, specially when the
sore is broken. And if this be not enough, then take therewith Scabious,
Comfery, and Mallows, of each as much as you please, and thereof make a
plaster. And if that the sore would corrode further, then take fine Bolus,
Dragon blood, Vinegar, Rose water, and the whites of Eggs, as much as you
please, and spread or lay the same plaisterwise round about the sore.

Another: Take soot of the chimney, beaten salt, Sage, and Wheat that is
chewed in ye mouth, of each a like much, and make a plaster thereof with
black Soap. And if so be that this plague sore will not be killed through
these foresaid things, then put thereto some Scabious and Comfery, and then
cleanse afterward the sore with Mundificatiuum de Apio. Take Louage, one ounce,
Barley meal two ounces, sees them together in water to pappe, and put thereto
Sallad oil. You must also often wash this plague sore, to wit, with water of
Carduus Benedictus, for that cleanses and heals. These ulcers do many times
spread wide abroad, whereby the flesh about is spoiled: for this, you must use
stronger remedies, as the salve of Egypt, Mercurium praecipitatum, or that
which is better, burning with an hot iron or gold, whereby all putrefying is
taken away, and the part fortified; for the actual cauterie is an effectual
remedy that strengthens the parts that be of a cold nature, and does defend
them from putrefaction. Some also do scarifie the ulcers round about with a
razor, and then spread fine Treacle therein. But as the black edges of these
ulcers increase notwithstanding all these applications, then is it a sign that
this venime is very strong, wherefore must you burn it deeper, and anoint the
scarres with sweet Butter, or with pap of Hollihocke roots, or of Mallows and
Butter together. But when the swelling or ulcers do yield matter, then must you
lay no more maturatiues thereon, that thereby the matter augment not, and the
healing be the more hindered. Lastly, you must have care to engender flesh and
skin, whereof we will write and treat further in their due place.

When as this Anthrax or plaguesore is thoroughly killed, then take Scabious,
Comferie, of each a handful, and a little Salt, then temper it together with
fresh Barrowes grease, and lay it warm thereon, and change it new three or
four times in a day and night.

Another: Take Scabious four handfuls, Treacle one ounce, Barrowes grease one
ounce and a half, stamp the herbs and make a plaster thereof, and refresh it
often, even as is aforesaid. You are to cleanse the ulcers with salve of
Turpentine, juice of Scabious, and the yolks of eggs, especially when all other
accidents are past. This plaster following is also especial good: Take green
Rue one handful, leaven half an ounce, Pepper one dragme, Salt a dragme and a
half, three or four dry Figs, powne them all well together, and make a
plaster thereof, and refresh it twice a day. It is of a wonderful operation:
for it will separate the bad flesh from the good, and that in the space of two
days.

When these swellings come to impostumat, and have need of clensing, then are
you to use ye salve De Apio, and therewithal you may prepare these things
following: Take Turpentine (that has been often washed with water and
Scabious) one ounce, Saffron seven greines, and temper amongst it the yolks of
two eggs.

Or use this thing following to cleanse and to engender now flesh: Take
Turpentine that is washed with the juice or water of Scabious four ounces,
Barley meal one ounce, two yolks of Eggs, Saffron, Sarcocolla, Mastick and
Frankincense, of each half a drag. temper it all together.

Thirdly, take small beaten Sarcocolla half an ounce, and honey of Roses as
much as need requires for to make a mild salve thereof, and use it so long
till it be thoroughly whole. For this also may you see what has been written in
the fifth part, the first chapter 16.. And further in the fifth part, the seventh
chapter, and 14.. where this matter has been treated of at large.

When as there is no plague sore perceived.. 16.
IF there appears no Anthrax or plague sore, and yet nevertheless the pulse
and the urine sufficiently showed that a pestilent Fever were at hand, and that
the patient by reason of his age and power may suffer well the letting of
blood, then must his Liver vain be opened in the right arm. Other do counsel
when as the Ague endures, and his strength good, that the Saluatella on his
left hand should be opened, and to let out four ounces of blood.

For letting of blood in the Plague.. 17.
WE have before declared that amongst all other remedies for this swelling, the
letting of blood is beneficial, but to the end when need requires it be not
omitted, you shall observe these instructions following. When as after sweating
you find that any thing appear (be it a black blister, or any thing else) and
that the patient is above thirteen years old and be strong, then must you let
him blood on the same side, and underneath the swelling, and make a good issue
that the blood may issue forth the better. If the swelling appear behind the
ears, which the Physicians do call Parotidas, or Gemellos, even as we in the
first part the 9. Chapter 4.. have showed, then must you open the head vein on
the same side in the arm, and if it will not bleed, then must you open that
vein in the other arm. Or if the swelling appear in the arm pits, on the
breast, or on the ribs, then must you open his Liver vein in the arm on the
same side. Some give counsel that there should be put thereto three or four
Leaches one hour after, that they might suck out a good deal of that venomous
blood. But if this Anthrax or plaguesore be any where about the priuities or in
the groines, then must you let him blood in the vein upon the foot, or
between the great Toe and the next unto it. And if that will not bleed, then
must you open the vein in the other foot, and let out more or less according
to the age and ability of the patient. Some also have anointed the swelling
behind the ears with Hens grease: afterward you must give him the confection
Philonium Persicum, yet at all times by the counsel of a learned Physician:
also in like manner the Trocisci de Carobe, and herwith we will conclude.

The government of life in the Plague.. 18.
AS much as first belongs to the meat: you must note, that it is not
needful that one need in a pestilentiall Fever to forbear meat, as in other
hot and strong Agues, as in the Pleurisy, or continual Ague, and other such
like: but the need requires here, that there may be often given to the patient
(yea as some suppose every three or four hours) to eat and drink in ye time
of the plague. And it has indeed been found, that all those that have forced
themselves to eat, were much sooner cured than the other; wherefore do they
well, that feed such a patient often with light meats that are dry and cold
by nature, whereby they may withstand the heat of the Ague by their cold, and
the moisture of the bad and slimy humors by their drith. These are strained
Pease, Barley pap, Oaten pap, Hasel nuts, Capon broth, Hen broth, or of any
other young flesh, wherewith Buglosse, Burrage, and such like herbs are
sodden, whereof you may make Panadella with grated bread. And it is to be
generally noted, that you may dress all his meat with sour things, as with
Vinegar, Veriuice, juice of Limons, and such like. But if the fresh broth be
too sweet, then may you therewith temper two yolks of eggs, which are first to
be beaten with Rose vinegar, and so make thereof a sowrish broth. All sour
things are also good for it, for that they provoke appetite, which presently is
taken away in these Agues by the putrefaction in these diseases, which
specially feebleth the stomach, insomuch as very often they are addicted to
vomit, whereby the patient will also be weakened: for if the patient can keep
no meat in his stomach, then can the body retain no nourishment of the
meat that is taken. But to return again to the wholesome meat for the
plague, there are also good small Damask prunes, conserues of Cherries,
conserues of Raspes, and such like. Also all green herbs are to be stewed, to
wit, Burrage, Lettice, Sorrel, with a little beaten Saunders added thereto. The
juice of Limons, of Oranges, and of Citrons, is a special sauce for all his
meats.

The most commodious drink that he may drink is Barley water, the juice of
Limons, Oranges, Sorrel, Pomegranates, or tempered with the sirupe of the
same. Also it may be sodden like a Iulep, and the sirupe tempered amongst it.
The common sort may sees amongst it Berberries, Sorrel with the roots, or
Quinces chopped small. But when the patient is weary of this drink, then may he
use a draught of Almond milk, or thin Beer; and he may also drink for this
sickness Well water tempered with Rose vinegar. Distilled waters, as the
waters of Carduus Benedictus, Sorrel, Burrage, or water of Buglosse, are very
good for him. Item, water wherein unripe Grapes are sodden, or mixed with
Veriuice: also the sirupes of Roses, of water Lillies, Violets, and of Cicorie,
and their Iuleps, are much commended for this sickness. And with all these
foresaid meats and drinks is Manus Christi prepared with Pearls, for this
malady much commended. Item, conserve of Violets, of Roses, of Gilloflowers,
and specially conserues of Cuckobread, taking the bigness of a Walnut of it.

Contrariwise, the patient must utterly forsake wine, and all meats that are
dressed with Spices. Fish, Milk, and all roast meat is hurtful unto him, and
after meat the patient must keep himself very quiet.

Of a convenient air for the Plague.. 19.
THe air that is good for such sick folks, must be cold and dry, because the
sickness requires all cool things, and that by the drouth all putrefaction may
be withstood. Therefore must the chamber (as it is said) be sprinkled with
Rosewater and with Vinegar wherein Saunders and Camfere are tempered. Item, the
chamber must be sprinkled with all cold and fragrant herbs and flowers, and in
case there be any bad sauors or vapors in the chamber, then are the fuming
candles, or odoriferous cakes to be used, whereof we have largely written
before, and showed how they are to be made. Besides these, it is also good
counsel that there be kept a good fire burning in the same house, to wit, of
Juniper wood, or any other sweet wood. But if so be there be no bad air in the
patients chamber, then are you not to kindle any fire in that chamber, but
rather use any cold and odoriferous things; and you may hang clothes that are
made wet in Rosewater, or Rose vinegar, and wrung out again here and there
about his bed or couch.

How they shall govern themselves that escape this Sickness.. 20.
AS for all them that recover from this Plague or any other lingering sickness,
all things are good that strengthen the stomach, and provoke appetite to meat,
and mildly open the body, as these confections following: Take Mirabalani
Chebuli, Indi, Rubarb, Cinnamom, Carduus Benedictus, and Cloves, of each one
dragme, Masticke a quarter of an ounce, Aloe three dragmes: mingle them all
together with the juice of Mints wherein half a dragme of Agaricke has been
steeped, then take thereof morning and evening the bigness of a Chestnut. For
this may you also look the foresaid third Chapter, and twelfth. where you may
find a further discourse of these causes: and further if it be needful (as is
rehearsed) then look in the second part, the eleventh chapter, where touching
these things a perfect direction is given.

The 17. Chapter. An exhortation for them that keep these Patients.
FIrst, they that assist and keep them that are infected with the Plague, must
have care that the patient be laid upon a high couch or bed, that the venomous
damps and stenches may rest above, and be the less hurtful to the standers
by. And it were also not amiss that there be a burning fire always between
the patient and the standers by. If there be a chimney in the chamber, then
look what is spoken thereof before.

Secondly, when one comes near or touches the patient, then must his mouth
be kept close shut, and draw his breath only at his nose. He shall anoint his
nostrils with wine wherewith fine Treacle is tempered. The standers by are also
to use every other day the Plague pills every time a dragme, or a dragme and a
half. He must also take oftentimes Mithridate.

Thirdly, fine Bolus preserves men from all infection of the plague if a
dragme and a half of it be taken with Wine and Rosewater.

Fourthly, if you take as much of the golden Egg as the bigness of a Hasell nut
one day one, and another day another: to wit, pills or any such like. All they
that visit them that be sick of the plague must wash their mouths with
Vinegar, wherein Wormwood and Rue is sodden, before they come at them, and eat
some Garlic with a bit of bread. Further, they shall always hold a Pomander in
their hand before their nose.

All what is described in the beginning of the Plague, to wit, how the healthie
are to govern themselves with them that have the plague, is also very requisite
for this purpose.

All that is hitherto set forth for this disease are very passing and good
means, which God through his gracious goodness has ordained and created for
the good and welfare of man, wherefore he will of us for these his benefits be
praised, and be acknowledged for the only Physician both of the body and of
the soul: and therefore we ought especially to pray unto him for his
blessings, and thank him for the gifts received; for without him all physic
is in vain, and of no effect.

The 18. Chapter. Of the Scuruie, Scorbuticus Morbus.
THe Scuruie which is called in Latin Icteritia nigra, or Scorbuticus Morbus,
is none other but a spreading abroad of melancholic humors throughout the
whole body, chiefly caused and proceeding of the obstruction of the spleen.
These sicknesses are for the most part incident unto them that lead an idle
life, and feed on gross meats and drinks.

They that are burdened with this disease have commonly a bleake and leadish
color, their breath short with an oppression at the heart, and a lost appetite,
wearisomnes of the whole body, the gums are blew and swollen, quickly provoked
to bleed and putrify; otherwhiles blew or greenish spots over all the body,
stiffness in the knees, and most commonly they have black small speckles like
(...) l^^^ts upon the shins, and above that their urine is commonly brown red.

Thus to cure this sickness the patient is first to receive an easy
purgation, as the potion made of Decoctum laxatiuum, of Benedicta laxatiua, or
of Seen leaves: this being done, then may one open his Median vein and let him
bleed well, if he otherwise be full enough of blood.

The next day after you must prepare for him this green potion following,
whereof he must every day three or four times take a good draught: to wit, in
the morning and before noone one time, after dinner two times, and after supper
and going to bed a good draught more.

Take Becabunga and Watercresses, of each two handfuls, stamp them in a stone
or wooden mortar to pap, power thereto a pint of wine, and a pint of small
Beer: afterward stir them all together, and strain them through a cloth,
then give thereof to the patient to drink as is abouesaid: and you must
continue this till that the patient be thorough whole.

Another. Take the roots of Horseradish, which is called Raphanus syluestris,
as much as you think good, grate the same, or beat it small to pap, and power
unto it the moyty Whay of milk, and the other half Rhenish wine, or you may
take some small beer as much as you please, and then mingle it with stamped
Horseradishes: afterward strain it thorough a cloth, and drink thereof three
or four times a day, as is aforesaid.

Item, take Scuruigrasse two handfuls, or as much as you please, stamp it to
grout in a stone or wooden mortar, temper it with as much small beer and wine
as you think meet, or after as you can drink it, for the stronger the better:
lastly, strain it thorough a cloth, and drink thereof as above.

And if it come to pass, that in this sickness of the Scuruy, the gums of the
patients mouth were utterly spoiled and putrified: then wash the mouth with
wine, and anoint the gummes with sirupe of Mulberries, and with honey of Roses;
and if need so required, then must you anoint your gums with the salve of
Egypt, called Vnguentum Aegyptiacum. This may suffice for the cure of the
Scuruie.

The 19. Chapter. Of the detestable sickness, Drunkenness.
IT will perchance offend the gentlemen drunkards, that I have here put their
sickness of drunkenness after the infectious Plague, and Agues, and that I have
compared their sickness to those: but I will omit here ye los^e of everlasting
life, disdain of humanity, and credit, consumption of worldly wealth,
strife, murder, blasphemy of God, disclosing of secrets, whoredom, and many
more ungodly works that ensue thereof: wherefore we will here only treat of
the hurt that the body may hereby take thereof, and let other judge afterward,
whether this sickness be not worse than the Ague, yea worse than the Plague it
self. For Solomon speaks not in vain, ye Drunkenness hinders all wisdom,
which cannot be otherwise confirmed than that it makes a man a fool; darkneth
it not the understanding? in feebleth it not the brains, ye memory, and all the
senses? brings it not more forgetfulness with it, than is perceived in young
children? Behold only how the hands, the feet, the head, yea the whole body
tremble and quake, how the sight is darkened, the tongue stammereth, and how
that there is not one member of the body that is able to discharge his duty
aright. Yea, say they, this sickness has neither need of the Physicians nor
Apothecaries counsel, make thereof as weighty a sickness as you can, it may be
helped with a very pleasant medicine, that is, with a sweet sleep. Whereto I
say and answer: Oh good drunkard, there follows with the time some other
thing thereof, to wit, that thereby the good complexion of your Liver is
spoiled, so that it does not engender any good blood, but other bad humors,
whereby the Dropsy afterward ensues, or it does so inflame the same with his
sliminesse, that the whole body will be filled with Cholera, that lastly
spoileth and fireth the whole mass of blood, whereof then is caused
fearfulness, frightings, speaking in ye sleep, heavy dreams, the loss of all
good color, of natural seed, unfruitfulness, leprosy, and lastly, a madness
it self. Item, the Palsy, Lithargie, the falling sickness, and diverse such cold
diseases. Is there not provoked through this drunkenness a corruption of the
stomach? the parbraking of slimie and gross humors? weakening of all the
members? the gout? and to conclude, and untimely death? so that it has been
seen, that some in their drunkenness have remained dead. Who is it then that
does not take this drunkenness and swilling or gulling, for the most contagious,
perilous, and sodainest sickness? Wherefore to help this extreme sickness,
there is no certainer nor speedier remedy, than Sobrietas, which is sobriety,
and fasting or abstinence; and albeit that this receipt seem to be altogether
bitter, sour and unpleasant for these Ale knights, yet notwithstanding it will
expel the foresaid malady, it sharpneth the understanding and wits, it makes
a good stomach, whereby good blood is engendered, and brings to the body none
other but health. I conceal, that it strengthens the vital spirits of al
healthie bodies, causes godliness to serve their Creator, to seek his glory in
holiness and righteousness, and to obey his commandments.

Whereas then some have so weak a stomach, that they of necessity are
constrained to drink Wine: notwithstanding are so feeble of brain, that how
soberly soever they drink it, it disturbeth their heads and makes them
drunken. For this purpose may these things following be used: to wit, juice of
Quinces, or raw Quinces well chewed, and the juice taken down: likewise the
juice of Citrons, and Limons, or of their sirupes, do hinder drunkenness: Honey
is also much commended if it be taken after much drinking of wine; for thereby
will the vapors of the wine be so driven downwards, that it cannot weaken the
understanding nor the brains. Bitter Almonds confected, Conserues of
Gilloflowers; after that you have drunken much, do prevent drunkenness. In the
old time men did make a Garland of Saffron flowers and did wear it on their
heads; the same virtue is ascribed to the blew Violets. And it is said that
white Colewoorts cut into Sallads and the same eaten, or the seeds thereof
chewed in the mouth should hinder drunkenness: for the juice of Colewoorts, or
the pith of the stalks does stay the vapors of the wine from ascending into
the head. The precious stone Amethist should also preserve men from drunkenness.

But for to defend and prevent all contagions that proceed of drunkenness, we
will add some things more. First, he must be urged to vomit with Oxymel of
Squils, with Radish seed, with a feather dipped in oil and put into the
throat, and thereupon he must fast and sleep: and after he awaketh again,
you must froth his members, to wit, his hands and feet, with warm water
wherein is sodden Roses, Cammomill, and a little salt, and tempered with some
oil of Violets, whereby the vapors may be drawn downwards.

Item, lay a cloth upon the head that is made wet with the juice of Cucumbers,
Purslaine, or in any of their waters: the patient must keep himself herein
very sober, and use light meats, Colewoorts, Lentils, young Pullets, and young
Pigeons dressed with the juice of Limons, and Pomegranates: the prepared and
confected Coriander is also very good, and sleeping thereuppon until that all
the wine be digested, which may be seen by the concoction of the urine. It
chances oftentimes that drunken folks have great thirst, which if it comes
not through the abundance of wine, then give them fair fountain water to
drink, and sower fruits to eat.

You have also an especial thing in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, and
fourth. which is good for drunkenness, and thirst after drunkenness. There is
also a great difference in drunkenness, and that according to the nature of them
that are drunken.

He that is sanguine does sing, dance, laugh, and is merry: he may be
compared to children, that soon laugh, and for the most part know not why nor
wherefore: and when as a long time they have been merry, then begin they to
sleep till they have slept it out.

The choleric man is in his drunkenness angry, raging, clamorous, addicted
to fighting, and will not be corrected nor admonished of any body, one cannot
bring them to bed, they have much babbling, and are much bragging.

The Phlegmatici, they will be weary, lazy, sleepie, and keep themselves
quiet.

The Melancholici are sorrowful, bewail sometimes their sins, their friends
disease, and that is the greatest imperfection of their drunkenes: they are
therein like to the Apes, but in this they are all alike, that they stammer
with their tongue, they reele, and tarry not by their right wits.

How hurtful also drunkenness is, does appear in many places of this our book
of Physic, where we admonish all men to refrain it, and that not only of
this unmeasurable drinking, whereof we now make mention, but also where all
expert Physicians do forbid wine. And we will for a conclusion add this to the
rest, that the Rape wine and Beer wine drunken after meat, does make one more
drunken and sleepie, than any other kind of Rhenish wine. And it is a common
opinion that watered wine does sooner insect the head, than pure wine. But this
is to be understood of gross and thick wine, which by the putting to of a
little water is the more subtiller, whereby the vapor sooner fumeth into the
head.

You have also many remedies before in the first part, the first Chapter, and
eight. that are commodious for the pain of the head through drunkenness.

The 20. Chapter. Of Frighting and Fear.
LEt no man wonder that we speak of Frighting amongst other sicknesses: for it
is not only found by experience, that through many sorts of distemperature of
the blood many sundry sicknesses are provoked, but also a sudden death it
self: whereof comes not only the aforementioned, but also thereby is caused
an inestimable fear and faintnes of ^art, whereby they become most unfit for
all worthy and knightly prowe^^e, and are deprived of all counsel and
endeavors. Of this faint hartednesse and fear, the Philosophers do write, that
the same for the most part do reign and dwell in the heart of such as are of a
cold nature, which being suddenly and hastily set upon, their subtillest blood
runs with such a stream to the inward parts of the body, and toward the
heart, that it seems, that the natural heat should be suffocated; whereby
comes such bleaknes and quaking, yea sometimes swonnings, debilitie of the
sinews and muscles, that it makes frighted persons very feeble and weak,
whereby also the motions of the muscles are so disturbed, that both ordure and
urine slides from them, their teeth chatter for cold, they are thirsty, and
the whole body shiuering and shaking.

For this are two principal and also certain remedies (even as Horatius
says) to wit, that one should build a wall of steel about him, that is, shall
always have an upright conscience, that cannot accuse him of any misdealing.
Secondly, that he fear God, and have righteousness always before his eyes:
which medicines do so free men of all frighting, that (like as David says) it
will always go well with him: and know for certain, that God of his goodness
has with his holy Angels (as it were a strong tower) compassed him round
about, whereby he will defend him.

But the faintnes of heart is also to be helped with natural medicines. Note
therefore, that when the blood through frighting is stirred, and runs
toward the heart (as it indeed happens) then must of necessity the trembling
and quaking follow after it: for which you have in the second part, the sixth
Chapter, and seventh. a very good Elderne water and many other things
described. When a woman (with child especially) is frighted, then do some bid,
that there should be taken a quarter of an ounce of clarified honey, and
therewith some scraped Nutmegge, and so eat it all together.

Wine moderatly drunken, makes the fearful and faint-harted men, stout and
courageous.

And it is a common custom, if any be sore frighted, that he be admonished to
make water, and if there be any that after such frighting can come hardly to
himself, and fell into a swoune, then is he to use those things that
strengthen the heart, for which there are many remedies described in the second
part, the sixth Chapter, and first. and also afterward in the description of
the heart.

The 21. Chapter. Of Trembling.
FOrasmuch as the trembling or quaking is a sign or token of fear, (yea for
the most part is caused thereby) therefore it might be needful to write
somewhat amply thereof: But we have made in the first Part, the twelfth Chapter,
and twelfth. a long discourse thereof, and therewith also showed, that this is a
disease of the Brains.

Also of the trembling and panting of the heart, has been spoken at large in
the second part, the sixth Chapter, from the third. unto the sixth. Wherefore I
do suppose, that it were needless to discourse any further thereof at this
present.

The 22. Chapter. Of the impediments that come of Falls.
INto what diseases men may fall, by falls, stumblings, blows, pinches, and
such like, is sufficiently known to all men: whereof we have also written in
diverse places, and especially in the second part, the fifth Chapter, of the
vomiting of blood: and also in the eighteenth. of the clotted blood, where very
good remedies are described, and therefore here are but a few declared. But if
any be bruised much through a fall, then have the Chirurgians a special
experiment, that they speedily fley off the skin of a Weather, the which they
must lay warm round about the bruised or wrenched member, and keep it warm,
and this should help in one day.

Brimstone sodden in strong wine, is also very good: In like manner powned
Garlic tempered with Barrowes grease.

Item, take Bran of Rye meal, the roots of Ebulus, of each a like quantity,
sees them together in a little Vinegar, and so bind it upon the wrenched or
bruised part.

There was once a child fallen out of his Cradle, who thereby had got a swelling
on his arm; which was healed by anointing it with oil and salve of Roses.

For this also do serve all golden and waters of life, principally if any
swouning were at hand, the same waters drunken and laid upon the bruised member,
and anointed does heal. And if the dead Palsy or falling sickness join
with it, then look into the first part, the twelfth Chapter, in the end of the
thirteenth. where are showed some good remedies commodious for this purpose.

And if the joints be removed from their natural places, then read the
description of the Crookebacke, in the second part, the fourth Chapter, and
second. In like manner also of the dislocation in the fourth part, the seventh
Chapter, and first. where very good remedies are described.

The end of the sixth Part.
The seventh Part of this Book speaks of certain Poisons, and Venims, of
Plants, Metals, and Beasts.
THe miserable life of man is not subject to sicknesses and diseases enough, as
well inwardly as outwardly, but there must be diverse venomous things to hurt
and annoy the same, which are almost among all creatures, and with such
hurtful quality endued, that they bereave men of their lives, some sooner,
and some later. But God of his goodness has ordained innumerable and
wholesome means for it, and that almost in the smallest creatures, as in
Herbs, Roots, Earths, and other: amongst which the simplest in sight have
otherwhiles the most virtue to resist the strongest poison; preserving both man
and beast from death, even as hereafter may be seen in many places, which
ought to admonish us to praise and thank God almighty for our health, and to
acknowledge him to be the fountain of all goodness. And to speak and treat
thereof in this our Book of physic we purpose to rehearse them in this
seventh Part, wherein shall be only admonished of such poisons as are known
in Germany, and (as one may speak) are every day before our eyes. For what
poisons are or may be found in the East, and in Aphrica, it were superfluous to
speak of them at this present. We will part these poisons or venims into three
kinds: whereof the first shall be the vegetables, as Herbs, Roots, Plants,
Seeds, Juices, and such like: the second sort are the venomous Metals: the
third sort are certain Beasts, and whatsoever else comes from them, whereby
men are harmed: so that the sum of this seventh Part consists in two
things. First, to know all the venims whereby heed may be taken to eschew them.
Secondly, if it so chance that any one have taken any of them unwittingly, or
were ministered unto him by another; how that one may help him, and show how
that venime might be withstood, and how to extinguish his deadly quality. For
it is very needful that every Physician or householder be provided with good
remedies against all manner of venime, whereby he as soon as need requires,
may have somewhat in readiness that he may minister against the venime so
taken. For in all such causes there serves no delay; as there be but a few
venomous beasts and other, which if they be not remedied out of hand, do so
infect, that afterward they remain irremediable, as we have also showed in
other places.

And therefore must we match and meet with these venomous and hurtful things,
imitating the first rule, if any man be poisoned by meat or drink, then is a
vomit the principallest remedy. Or if he have received any venime through
thrusts or biting, then must you set cups or boxes with pricking thereon,
scarifying or cauterizing the sound flesh about the wounds, and at the last if
need be cut off the whole joint or member. And those thrusts and bits are to be
cured by some iniection and application, so to hinder the violence and
operation of the poison. The poison taken inwardly is subdued through tart and
sharp wine, and other means: and lastly through purging, sweating, and such
like, as hereafter shall be taught. Regard is also to be had of the quality of
the venime, and of the strength of them that have taken it; that the strongest
poisons may be expelled with the strongest remedies: and the smallest venimes
with mild medicines and remedies. Also regard must be had to the time of the
year, and to the age of the poisoned person. This is now briefly prefixed for
a Preface, we will now proceed to the remedies.

The first Chapter. All those things that are good against Poison.
ALl that by the learned may be used against poison, shall here be described
and specified; and we will show and name those things that are well known, and
easily gotten. For what may it profit us to counsel any man to take the gall
of an Elephant, the blood of a Crocodile, and the Eggs of a Tortoyse in the sea?
First, Veriuice (which is of himself good alone) or a sirupe made thereof, is
very good, for it withstandeth al Poison.

The roots of Valerian, brown Betonie, and Rue, of each a dragme, taken with
wine, is also good against poison. Conserues of Gilloflowers and their wine are
also good for the same: the Beuercod, the conserues and wine of Burrage do also
withstand poyon. In like manner also the juice and the sirupe of Citrons, and
all that is made thereof.

Carduus Benedictus leaves are also marvelous good against all venime (it is
said that Frederick the Emperor was the first that brought the same herb out
of Greece into Germany) for the juice, water, powder, and seed of it are all
good against poison.

Fennel seed is also much commended, Sealed earth (if it be right) is of all
Physicians accounted for a noble medicine against all venime.

Peucedanus and wild Radish are also much commended.

Wine of Hearts tongue is also used for the same, albeit the ancient Physicians
do make no mention thereof.

The Conserues of Elderne flowers is also very good, and is accounted a
conserve for the common people.

The Conserues of Hyssope, and the wine of the same, does also contend with
venime.

Nep, Comin, and Caraway, are more strong than the Fennel seed. Agaricus is
good if a man will purge.

Angelica is of all Physicians accounted good against all manner of venim, and
recommended by the name Laserpitium.

Eringus withstandeth all venim. The Oleander which the Greeks call Nerion and
Rhododendron is also commended. The long Hartwoort is also good. Rue has an
especial efficacy against all poison: and in like manner the seeds of wild
Rue; Rosemarie is also praised of some: the learned write not any thing
thereof. Sagapenum and Serapinum is also accounted good for it.

Wormwood, and all that is made of Wormwood is marvelous good against all
venime. The compounded things that are commodious against all venime, shall
hereafter follow.

An exhortation for all those that are afraid to be poisoned.. 2.
Ancient Physicians were wont to have an old Proverb, and to say, that
Venime is so proud that it dwells commonly in Gold and Silver: whereby they
meant, that great personages that eat and drink out of gold and silver, are
in greater danger to be poisoned, than the common people that do eat and
drink out of earthen dishes; wherefore must such high personages that are
afraid to be poisoned, diligently take heed of the meat and drink that they
eat, and that are dressed of diverse things.

Also they must not take too much of all sweet, salt, and sower drinks; and
they must not eat too eagerly nor too hastily, and they must at all times have
great regard of the first taste of their meat and drink.

But the most surest way is, that before the mealetide he take somewhat that
may resist venim, as Figs, Rue, or Nuts: each by himself or tempered together.
The Citrons, Rape seed, Nepe or any of those that are described before, the
weight of a dragme taken with wine, now one and then another, is very much
commended. Sometimes also two Figs with a little Salt, then again Mithridate
or Treacle, and such like mo may he use before the mealetide.

When any body perceives that he has taken Poison.. 3.
But if one be sure and perceive, or certainly know that he has taken poison,
then must there be no long disputing what is to be done: for in case ye one
will be long a counselling what shall be done, then will the venim in the mean
time infect his blood and other vital parts: whereby the party may be
neglected, and afterward also remain incurable. Therefore must the common
means be used (as is said before) to provoke him to vomit and cast, and that
through the taking of luke warm water tempered with Sallad oil or with sweet
Butter.

There are here and there in this book diverse remedies expressed, whereby
vomiting is to be furthered, which may be used for this purpose, and you may
seek for them in the Table. And as soon as the patient has vomited, then are
you to cause him to have a loose and open body, which may soon be brought to
pass with a strong Clister, whreby the remaining sharpnes of the venim, that
might remain behind in the stomach, or in the bowels, might be driven out and
expelled.

The signs when one is poisoned.. 4.
ALbeit that the signs of those that be poisoned, and the nature of the Poison
taken, or the biting of a venomous beast are diverse (as shall hereafter be more
at large declared:) nevertheless can it not be but good and requisite to
comprehend them all under one. First they get a vehement pain in the stomach,
in the belly, and in the bowels, pain of the Liver, the kidneys, and the
bladder. Often they get a hoarsnesse, gnawing and biting, shiuering, cold,
dumbness, and conuulsion of the sinews, feebleness of the pulse, the
Lethargy, swimming of the head, darkness of sight, and a shortness of
breath, yea that they seem to choke, great thirst, bleeding, lack of
appetite, great heat, great feebleness of the face, loss of understanding, of
might, and mo such like symptoms; yet hereby cannot sufficiently be known the
nature of the poison that has been taken. For example, if any man has taken
Cantharides (which are Spanish Flies) he gets diseases in the tongue, in the
stomach, and in the kidneys, the bladder is inflamed, he can scarcely make
water, to wit, without infinite pain, blood, and great sharpness. The
Caterpillars of the Fur tree called Buprestes, and the Salamandra, do also
cause ye foresaid accidents.

Item, all those that have taken Opium do fall into a very deep sleep, or
altogether into a malady, that is called Lethargus, to wit, the sleepie
sickness, they get bleake spots, they wax sluggish, cold and stiff, and are
deprived of all their senses.

The like chances to them that have taken the juice of Mandragora, or the
juice of Hemlocke.

The Henbane seed makes men not only foolish and raging, but as it were mad,
or as if they had taken Aconitum: they be not only choked that have taken
Aconitum, but also those that do take Toadstooles, Ceruse, Gippes, and Ox
blood: but (as it is said) we shall hereafter further discourse and admonish at
large of this matter.

Here we will most of all entreat of those poisons especially that grow, and
whatsoever else proceeds thereof, and add unto them their Latin and Greek
names.

The second Chapter. Of the venomous Plants and such like.
THe Mandragora is not otherwise called in Latin nor in Greek, and is by good
reason placed amongst the venims, for that by her nature which is cold in the
third degree, it does choke one: and when one takes too much of the juice,
then causes it a sleep unto death. It is also very dry, yet may with
discretion the weight of one dragme be given thereof as need requires: for
the learned write, that if any man be too sore frighted or feared, so that he
must be cut or burnt, then must there be given one drag. of this root unto
him, and he shall then fall into so deep a sleep, that he shall three or
four hours long remain insensible, in which space the Chirurgian have time
enough to do their work.

But what the Toothdrawers or Mountibankes do with this root of Mandragora,
(making the people believe that they grow under the gallows of the urine of
the hanged thieves, having the form of a man) is known to all men.

Henbane is called of the Greeks Hyoscyamus, and at the Apothecaries
Iusquiamus, which is almost as much to say, as hogs beans, and that by reason
that this herb is a deadly poison for swine, if they be not presently well
washed, and drink much, or do eat Creuets, which have a special operation
against this poison.

This Henbane is of three kinds: the one has red flowers and black seed: the
second has yellow flowers and yellow seeds, and are both by their very cold
nature venomous: the third has white flowers and white seeds, and is also cold
to the third degree, which of the Physicians is very aptly used in some causes:
but if you cannot get the white, then take the yellow, and leave the black.
You may make of the new seed a juice, which is dried in the sun, but it may
not be kept above one year. When you have taken this juice, then will it make
one frantic, and as he were drunken, but by certain medicines the same will
quickly away. You must take therefore the milk of an Ass, or in stead thereof
Goats milk or Cowes milk.

Item, Honey water is very good for it, if he drink much thereof: when you are
weary thereof then cease and then drink again afresh. Water wherein Figs were
sodden, is also very good for his. Cucumber seeds or Pingles sodden in wine
and so used, are good for this purpose. Item, wine that is somewhat salted, and
tempered with Barrowes grease, is also not ill.

Item, there is very commodious for it Nettle seed, Cicorie roots, white
Mustard seed, Cresses, Radishes, Onions, or Garlic, any one of these taken
with wine, and then afterward the patient laid to sleep, even as one that is
drunken.

Coriander is a known seed, called in Latin Coriandrum, and in Greek Corion,
or Corianon. The learned have diverse opinions of it, Dioscorides writes, that
it is cold, but Galenus and his followers do reject this opinion, and says,
that it is hot, or at least somewhat warming. And albeit this seed be
somewhat venomous, yet may the same easily be corrected, to wit, when it has
been steeped in Vinegar, and is dried again, and then may it be used in many
medicines as you may find every where, etc. Take prepared Coriander etc. The
nature of his venime is, that when one eats too much of this seed, or
drinks too much of the juice, then will the head be thereby so out of frame,
as if a man were drunk: it makes one hoarse, and as if he were dumb, or if he
speak, yet are they but vnreuerent words. In fine, it is not without great
danger: for it has been often found, that after the taking of the juice death
has followed, therefore it is good counsel, that you use of this a little,
and but seldom: yea some will correct the Physicians that daily use this seed
for strengthening of the head, by reason that it is much contrary to the head,
and noisome. Now to take away the venim of this seed, you are first to cause
the patient to vomit, and that with oil called Irinum, or in stead thereof,
with oil of Olives, both of them taken with the warm decoction of Wormwood.
Also you may fry an Eg or two in this oil, and mix it with pickle of salt
fish, and so drink it, or the pickle alone, well salted Hen-broth or
Goose-broth. In like sort sodden wine mingled with ley, are very good for it.

Nardus seeds or Nigella seeds, called in Greek Melanthion, and in latin
Nigella, by reason of his blackness. There are four kinds of it, two black,
the which (by reason of their pleasant smell) are planted in the gardens:
another which grows of himself in the fields: the fourth sort is yellowish,
and has no difference from the black kinds. The nature of them all is hot and
dry, which makes them venomous, when one takes too much thereof he is in
danger of death. And herein is a wondrous work of nature, that contrariwise it
resists poison, and in old time (by reason of his pleasantness) was baked in
bread. For what diseases then this seed is good, that is showed and taught in
more other places.

Milk thistle. This root the Greeks call Chamaeleonta, for that the leaves do
alter their color after diverse sorts, according to the nature of the ground,
now black, and then green, now blew, and then yellow, and into diverse other
colors: In latin this herb is called Carduus Suarius, that is, Sowthistle,
for that it kills hogs if they eat this herb mingled with Barley meal. In
like manner it kills Rats and Mice if they eat thereof and drink not
thereafter immediately. The Apothecaries call this herb Cardopatium. Because
that this is hurtful to the said beasts, therefore cannot it be but hurtful
to men if they eat too much thereof. And the same is manifested by his nature,
for that it is hot in the second degree, and dry in the third: yet this root
is often used for many things, and highly commended, and that most of all
against the venom of the Plague. There are two sorts, black and white
Milkethistle, both of one nature: notwithstanding there is here to be noted,
that the black is to be used only outwardly.

The Yewtree do the Greeks call Smilax, and the Latinists Taxus. This tree is
well known, he grows prosperously in cold and shadowie places, for such is
his nature. That he is placed amongst the venims, is not without cause: for it
has been tried, that if bottels be made of it, and the wine kept therein a
certain time, it kills a man. In like manner does the fruit of the same tree
which grows in Spain. Moreover it is said, that whosoever sleeps under the
shadow of this tree, or upon the leaves, and specially upon his blossoms, must
die, for that the whole body will be thereby ouercooled, that a man must die
suddenly. His leaves are not hurtful for the wild beasts, but only for such
beasts as do not chew their cud, as the swine, Horses, Asses, etc. they are
killed with it. It is said also, that if a copper nail be struck into his
stem or body, then will his venom vanish away. His smoke should kill Mice.
And his venom will also be taken away by the same means that hereafter is
prescribed against the venom of Hemlocke, where you may seek and find the
same.

Wild Cucumbers and their juice Elaterium, whereof is so many times admonished
that men must deal with it warily, and use but a very little at one time,
except it be in grievous sicknesses, as the Dropsy, and such like: the Greeks
do call this herb Sicyagrion, which is wild Cucumbers, for that the same are
like to the tame Cucumbers. When these wild Cucumbers are ripe, and softly
handled or wroong, then break they open, wherefore you must look to your eyes,
for they are hurtful. In Latin it is called Cucumis Anguinus, Syluestris and
Erraticus. The Apopothecaries and common people call it a wild Cucumber. His
juice is Elaterium: it is made as well of the roots as of the leaves: but it
is not so forcible as that which is made of the fruit. Of all medicines, there
is none that continues longer good than the same, for Theophrastus writes,
that it has been found good and forcible 200. years, and it ought not be used
until it be three years old: it is hot and dry by nature, for which cause
Dioscorides does place it amongst poisons. It is so vehement, that when a woman
uses it in pessaries it kills the fruit. But we have written of it also in
the Introduction.

Fleawort. The Greeks do call the seed of this herb Psyllium, the Latinists
Pulicariam, by reason that the seed is like to Fleas, or that it hinders the
breeding of such vermin: The Apothecaries do keep both the Latin and Greek
names. It is (as some say) cold in the second degree, and is measurably dry
and moist. Others do ascribe great cold unto it, wherewith this following does
agree. Albeit this seed be commodiously used, as many places of this book may
witness, yet has it nevertheless his venom, to wit, when one uses too much
thereof, for that it makes the whole body cold, sluggish, feeble and unapt.
Against this may be used that which is prescribed for Coriander.

Crowfoote, the Greeks do call Batrachion, the Latinists Ranunculum, that is
Frogwort, either because it willingly grows (as Frogs do) in moist places, or
for that the Frogs gladly hide themselves under it. Some call this herb
Flammulam, by reason of his burning nature; for being applied green, it does
not only excoriate the place with pain, but also if the flowers lie long
thereon, it makes a hard escarre: The beggars have learned this so well, that
therewith they open their legs, and make them sore, that they are loathsome to
behold, to the end that thereby they may get the greater alms. As much as
appertains to the venom of this herb, it is by nature hot and dry, so that
it burns not only the outward parts, but also the inward parts, when it is
taken inward. The root dried provoke neesing: if one hold it a good while at
a tooth, it dries so much that it falls to pieces.

Api^strum, which the Apothecaries do call Apium risus, is also of the same
nature. We call it water Crowfoote: it is with us very sharp, but much sharper
and more venomous in the Island Sardinia. All that eat thereof are deprived of
their understanding, the sinews of their mouth and lips are so mightily
conuulsed that the patient seems always to laugh, when nevertheless he dies:
whereof that vulgar proverb is sproong, Sardinius risus, which is, Sardinians
laughing, that is as much as when one laugheth where he had more need to weep.

Now to cure this venom, you are to give to the harmed abundance of honey water
and milk to drink, and anoint the body with some warming salve, or to put the
patient into a bath of warm water, among which oil is tempered; and in fine
to use all things for this purpose that is to be used for the crampe and
conuulsion of the sinews.

Nightshade do the Greeks call Strichinos or Trichnos, and the Latinists
Solanum, the which name the Apothecaries have turned into Solatrum. Hereof are
four kinds described by the learned, whereof the first is garden Nightshade,
which may be eaten amongst other pot herbs. The second sort are the winter
Cherries, whereof we will not write any thing. The third sort provoke sleep.
The fourth sort makes men mad and out of their wits, wherefore it is called in
low Dutch, Dulcryut, that is, Maddingwort. The Nightshade that provoke
sleep, is cold in the third degree, like to Opium, whereof we will speak
shortly, but it is not altogether so cold: and albeit that sometimes the root
of this herb is taken for the dropsy, yet notwithstanding shall the same be
forborne; for it has often happened, that when one has taken too many of the
berries that he thereby is become raging and mad, yea so stiff over al his
body, as though al his joints were dislocated. This stiffness accustometh
commonly to endure three days, so that some deceivers accustom to use the
same to bring men into a misbeleefe, as Pliny writes. If one take the weight
of a dragme of this root, it makes a man lusty, friendly, and causes
wonderful fantasies, so that they seem to be foolish, and to have forgot all
shamefastnes. And such as take two dragmes thereof, they will be wholly mad and
raging: and if one take half an ounce, then will death follow; for the said
Pliny writes, that the Greeks with such like meriments have played the fools:
whereby may easily be noted, that these two species of Nightshade ought not to
be used for any medicine inwardly. And this foresaid making mad is none other
than that the Greeks call Doryonion, which was used in old time for the
poisoning of arrows. The taste of this herb is like milk, it provoke
hoarsnesse, it hurts the tongue by his moisture, it expels blood by vomit,
drives out matter and filth by stool, even as they that have the red or
bloody flixe. Thus before those and such like accidents do appear, you may use
these remedies following, to wit, that the patient take much Honey water,
wherein Violets are sodden, and then vomit it out again. In like manner are you
to use the milk of an Ass, Goats milk, or new warm wine, wherein Annis
seed is tempered, or wherewith bitter Almonds are mingled. The water wherein
Mussels, Crabs, and such like are sodden, is very commodious to be drunken for
it, yea Mussels themselves eaten raw, and likewise clisters: and in fine, all that may draw the venom out of the body.

Nesingwort is of two sorts, to wit, white and black Neeseworts: the Greeks
call it Elleborus, and the Latinists veratrum nigrum, whereof we have at large
discoursed in the Introduction. We take this herbs name of the operation,
because it urges neesing. The ancient Physicians make much a do with it, and
committed many follies by it. Both these roots are in use, yet it is with them
as with other things, that whosoever takes thereof too much it is poison, and
brings him into the peril of death.

These roots are hereby known to be venomous, when as they are dug up, and
that the vapor of them rises into the face of the digger, that thereby he has
great pain in the head, and swells much: wherefore it must be dug up
speedily, and the digger ought to stand with his back to the wind, and to eat
some Garlic before, and then drink a good draught of wine after it. Black
Neesingwort kills horses, oxen, and swine, and purges downwards. White
Neesingwort is not so hurtful for cattle, and purges upwards. The physicians
specially forbid that none of these roots shall be used in women, old folks,
nor children, nor in them that have a short breath.

Poppie heads, and the juice of them, called Opium, the which is known with us
very well, is called of the Greeks Mecon, and of the Latinists Papauer. Some
of them have red flowers, which are Corneroses, the which if one plant, they
bear white, gray, and black seeds, of which the white are the best, and the
black the worst. All their natures are cold until the fourth degree,
therefore not only the seed, but also the whole herb provoke sleep. There
is also a yellow sort, but the same is hot and dry by nature. And by reason of
the extreme cold, is this herb numbered amongst venomes, not (if it be
measurably used) that it brings any hurt with it, for that the seed thereof
is baked in bread, but only when one takes too much thereof, and that chiefly
of the black, which is much stronger than the white, in provoking sleep, for
thereby is the sleepie sickness Lethargus caused. And of this black Poppie
seed, or of these heads (the which grow not in this country, but elsewhere) is
the juice made, dried, and afterward is called Opium, which is used in many
places of this book. But if you are to use it inwardly, then must it (as we
have often admonished) be warily taken in hand: for if there be too much
thereof given at once, then does it cause a man to sleep so long till he die:
Therefore there are a number of ancient physicians that affirm that none
ought to be used little or much of it, to wit, inwardly; but to leave and
refuse it as a very hurtful poison. But if it happen that any have taken
thereof too much, then are you to give unto him salt with Oxymel to drink,
even as is to be done when any body is poisoned with Toadstooles.

Toadstooles, do the Greeks call Mycites, the Latinists Fungi: whereof are
many kinds, and some when they are dressed cannot hurt, yet at all times give no
good nourishment, for that they are hard of digestion, and are avoided
downwards, as they were taken. In fine, all learned men agree in this point,
that some through a secret nature, and other through their quantity, do kill
one no otherwise than as if they were strangled with a cord or rope. Wherefore
it is rather a bravery, and an intolerable lickerishnesse of them that eat the
same, and put their health in danger, than any part of wisdom.

Do not we read of the Emperor Claudius, and of whole families, that meeting
together at bankets, and eating of the Toadstooles, have died instantly? We
speak not here of those that eat the same moderatly, and only for pleasure,
and yet that they do no great good to those that use them: for they augment the
choleric humors, and inflame all other bad humors of the body. One may know
them hereby, that in dressing they wax hard: they also got a venomous nature
if they grow about rustie iron, or any foul thing. Item, by any venomous
beasts, as Adders, Snakes, Toades, and such like, when they have their holes
thereabout, and so infect the same.

Wherefore it is to be well noted, that when any have taken thereof, and find
any hinderance of the breath, or otherwise find himself ill at ease, that
then the patient must immediately be caused to vomit, whereby the poison may be
cast up; which may be done by the taking of the pickle of fish and ley mingled
together, or by the decoction of Marierom and Hyssope. The force of this venom
may also be allayed by Hens dung taken with veneger.

Esula, all the venomous herbs that give milk, are seven in number, described
by the ancient physicians, and all of them are called of the Greeks by one
name, Tithymalon, and of the Latinists Herbae lactariae, as milk herbs, the
Apothecaries call it Esula: of these herbs there are some species unknown,
wherefore we will not waste much time in describing them: al together (yet the
one more than the other) are hot in the fourth degree, and dry above measure;
so that if one break a sprig thereof, and holds the same to his tongue the
space of many hours, he cannot be rid of the burning. Also if you lay the
powned herb on the whole skin, then begins the same forthwith to inflame
and burn, so that it seems that a cole of fire lies thereon.

In like manner also does this root manifest his venom first in the digging
up, whereby the digger and also the preparer are to expect more danger than
has bin told of Neesingwort, and by reason of her great venom, is this root
but seldom used by famous physicians for the purging of superfluous Cholera
and Melancholia, even as you may see in some places of this book: but how a
man shall prepare this root, that have you before in the Introduction.

The herb Wolfsbane, and specially the root, is of the ancient physicians and
Poets accounted the most venomous plant; so that when they will once talk of
poison, they call it Aconiton, with which name the Greeks and the Latinists
call Wolfsbane, which is of two sorts, whereof the one is called Pardalianches,
for that it choketh the Panthers, and has a root, that at the end is like the
tail of a Scorpion, which is called of the Apothecaries vua versa or Lupina.
The other sort is called of the Greeks Lycoctonon, which is Wolfsbane, for
that specially more than any other beasts it straightway strangleth the Wollfe,
notwithstanding that it also kills the Foxes, Swine, and all other wild
beasts, if the powder of this root be strewed upon any thing that they come to
eat. In fine, of all venomes there is none that sooner kills and takes out
of the world, and that not only when one takes it inwardly, but also if one
touch it: For if one touch any she cattle therewith about their members, then
must they die the same day. His nature is to corrode continualy inward, and
makes the parts that it touches stinking. Both of these sorts grow much in
Germany in the valleys and on high hills. And verily there is another wonder of
nature with it, to wit, that this venom most mightily withstandeth all other
venomes: As for example, when one takes this Wolfesbane or Monkeshood, then
must he expect none other than present death, unless there be another poison
before in the same body, as if one were stung before by a Scorpion.

Wolfesbane finding another poison in a man's body, opposes it self against
it after a most vehement manner, and expels it, yea and combateth against it
no otherwise but as a warrior that omitteth all other things, and sets only
upon his enemy, in which strife they remain both slain, and the man
retains his life. As soon as one has received this poison of Wolfes bane,
there comes a swimming upon him; chiefly if he would arise his eyes will
run, he feels great anguish in the breast, and in all inward parts: his
breath will be short and grievous, therefore it is needful that you endeavor
to expel this poison by vomits and Clisters. First, there is good for it
sodden Marierom, Rue, Horehound, Wormwood, and Wormwood wine, Housleeke,
Southernewood, Milk thistle, wild Cypress, and more such like. In like manner
also the right Balsame, if you give it with the weight of one dragme with honey,
or with milk, Beuercod, pepper, and Rue, of each one scruple, may be taken
with wine for this purpose.

Also the rennet of a young Kid, of a young hare, or young Roebucke drunken with
vinegar, is also very good.

The wine wherein a piece of glowing gold, a piece of silver, or a glowing iron
is quenched, is also highly commended for it. Or ley and wine, wherein a hen
is sodden. Fresh broth made with Beef, mingled with wine and drunken. The
herb of wild Cipresse is also very requisite for it.

Hemlocke is well known every where, and is called of the Greeks Conion, of
the Latinists and Apothecaries Cicuta, but by us it is called Hemlocke. It
kills men, and that very extremely, if any one take of his juice. It is a
very cold herb, and therefore very venomous. With this herb have the
Athenians gotten the name of Tyrants, for that therewith amongst many other
they murdered Socrates.

Against this poison it is very good that one do drink much strong wine, and
that betimes, before the poison passes to the parts of life.

It is also taken to be certain and sure, that if his juice be tempered with
wine and drunk, that there is no counsel nor help to be expected against it.

Outwardly the Hemlocke is to be used in some accidents with advantage, as has
been showed in diverse places of this book.

All they that receive of this poison, their head seems to run round, and
their sight so darkened, that at last they can see no more, they wax hoarse,
they lose their understanding, the outward parts wax cold, and are conuulsed
as if they had the Crampe, the pulse will be still, the breath tarieth behind,
and they die miserably. Wherefore (as in all other venoms) the patient is
straightway to be made to cast and vomit, to minister Clisters, and continually
plie him with wine, giving him Asses milk, Cow milk, Wormwood, and pepper,
tempered with wine and Rue. Item, juice of Mints tempered with wine, is here
much commended. In like manner also Ameos, Cardamome, or Storax, the weight of
half an ounce, Pepper with Nettle seed, and Bayberries drunk with wine.
Item, Vine euict excessiuely drunken, and vomited up again, is against this
sort of poison much commended.

Dogs bane is called of the Greeks Ephemeron, for that it kills a man in one
day. And that we may make difference of this root from such as are not
venomous, namely from the Liriconfansie, we will add Colchi^on with it, by
reason of the country where it grows in great abundance, and most venomous:
the Latinists call the same Bulbum agrestem, and the Apothecaries
Hermodactylum. They grow almost in all meadows in Germany, and are sweet in
the mouth, whereby the ignorant (by reason of their pleasant taste) may be
easily deceived, and allured to eat thereof, whereby they are in danger of
death: for as soon as they come into the stomach, by and by they feel a
burning and a pain over all the whole body, as if they had bin burnt with
Nettles, they feel also a gnawing in the bowels, the stomach will be hot and
oppressed, and in time there comes a laske after it, so that the scrapings of
the bowels and blood does follow, and lastly death it self. For this are all
remedies good that are prescribed against the venom of toadstooles, to wit,
vomiting and clisters. It is good before the venom get the mastery to drink
water wherein is sodden Oken buds, Acornes, Pomegranate peeles, or wild Thime,
and is mingled with milk. Item, you may also use one of these juices
following, as the juice of Cicorie, of Blackberry leaf, of Mirtles tempered
with wine, the inward peeles of Chestnuts powdered and mingled amongst it is
also very good. In like manner it is especial good to drink Marierom with Lie.
And above all things, there is nothing better than Cow milk, or the milk of a
Buffell drunken in great abundance, and held in the mouth: for if one have such
milk, it is no counsel to seek any further for any other things.

The third Chapter. Of the venomous Metals, and such like.
AS we have spoken in the description of the foresaid venomous plants only of
such as are well known in this country, so we will here treat of certain
metals, and of all that comes thereof, and teach also thereby when any body
is poisoned therewith, how that venom is to be resisted.

Ceruse, the Latinists call it Cerussam, and is taught by Dioscorides that the
same is made of lead by the vapor of the vinegar. This art was found long ago,
but now at this time it is made more easy. The Ceruse taken inwardly, is
deadly. Through the taking in of Ceruse follows hoarsnes, cough, drouth of the
tongue, coldness in the outward parts, loss of understanding, and the members
will be thereby weary, sluggish, and feebled. These accidents are to be helped
by these means following, as with honey water, with sodden Violets, or Mallows
water, with warm milk, with beaten seed of Sesamum sodden in wine, with Lie
that is made of Vine ashes, with oil of Marierom, or with Oleo Irino, or with
water wherein Peach kernels are sodden, Pigeons eggs with Frankinsense, sodden
Barley and Prunes: you may give any of these things which you will, and as often
as you will, and cast them out again. In like manner there is good for this
Scammonea sodden with Honey water.

Gips is very like unto Chalk, for it is made of many stones by calcination,
and also dug out of the earth. His nature is, that when it is made soft with
water, it is immediately altered again into a hard stone: the same does it also
in the body of man, whereby it strangleth presently: wherefore all that is
prescribed against the venom of the toadstooles, is also good for this. Item,
oil that is sodden with Mallows in stead of water, by reason that it is fat,
provoke a slippery passage for vomiting, and hinders also the exulceration
of the passages. Likewise there is also good the oil of honey water, or dry
figs sodden therein and so drunken. The lie which is made with the ashes of the
Fig tree is marvelous good for it: or in the place thereof you may take the
ashes of Oken wood, and eat Figs. Also you may use the ashes of the Vine, and
temper the same with wine, and drink much thereof, and then cast it or vomit
it out again.

Lime and Gips are very like one to another, and they match one another with
their venom. The red mine, whereby some do understand the red lead, and some
sinople, or mine of the quicksiluer, Sandaraca, Auripigmentum, which is
Orpiment, they are for the most part al of one nature, that they torment the
intrailes with an intolerable pain; and in case that there be no remedy had
for the same in time, then does it kill him. We will also add to the former
the yellow, red, and white Ratsbane or Arsenicum. For this is commodious all
that expels venom, abateth his sharpness, and looks the belly, whereof
there is much written before. The juice of Hollihockes and of Mallows is
special good for it, by reason that they are both of them mollifying. For this
also you are to give him a potion wherein Linseed and Rice are sodden, or Milk
tempered with Honey water must he drink vnmeasurably. In like manner also all
fat flesh broth.

Quicksiluer is called in Greek Hydrargyron, which is Water silver, and in
Latin Argentum viuum: we call it in this country Quicksiluer, and is of Pliny
called a venom exceeding all other venomes. It does also manifest the same in
man's body, not only taken inwardly, but also anointed over the outside. That
it is such a poison not only of the blood, but also of the venomous pocks, and
of other maladies more, as you may see and read before in diverse places of this
book. Some do say, if one drink it, it presently runs though the body: but
if any such thing happen, yet notwithstanding there remains somewhat thereof
behind in the body that does hurt the same and the intrailes. For the remedy
of this poison, one must drink much milk, and then vomit it up again: or in
steed thereof Wormwood wine, or water wherein Smallage, the seeds of Clary, and
Marierom, or Isop are sodden. For this is also very requisite small filed gold,
which does draw the Quicksiluer unto it in a wonderful manner, as by experience
may daily be seen at the goldsmiths and other, how quickly it cleaves to the
gold, and when it is warm, it mingleth it self with the gold, where
nevertheless al other things that are cast upon it are expelled from it, and
swim on the top of it, and lets them not fall to the bottom. There may also
be well used against the venom of Quicksiluer all that stands written against
the litharge of gold. Further, it is well known to all the world that there is
no stronger venom than the Mercurius sublimatus, like as all Chirurgians and
Pockmasters do find by experience, when as they do use the same in any ulcer.
How one shall prepare the litharge of silver, Pliny does teach the same
diversely, we will here admonish of his poison: when the same is drunken, then
does it make in the body, and in all the intrailes, not only an anguish, but
also an extreme pricking and pain, it pierces the inward parts, by his weight
it stays urine, it swells the body, and procures a leaden color. When as
the patient has vomited exceedingly, then are you to give him wine to drink
with the seeds of Clary sodden in it, Myrrh, wormwood, Isop, seeds of smallage,
pepper, Ligustrum, or dried pigeons dung

The fourth Chapter. Of the venomes that come of Beasts.
WHat great commodities Almighty God has given unto us in Beasts, is
sufficiently known unto all the world, and the same is to be seen in the
foresaid parts of this book, and in diverse medicines. For behold, what is more
base and less esteemed than the Earthwormes that breed in the stinking
dunghils, and also live therein, nevertheless they are used in grievous
sicknesses both inwardly and outwardly with great good. The venomous Scorpions
and Vipers are wholesome medicines against venom and other diseases, and yet more
such like, whereof one might write whole books, as the books of all Physicians
and Philosophers do testify; yea it has been found oftentimes that the ordure
of some beasts has helped in deadly sicknesses.

But to the contrary, there are four little beasts not fearful but hurtful,
against which hurts and harms there are here very good remedies taught to
defend and preserve one from them. For what is a more friendlier beast toward
men than the Dog? What beast is more obedient, and can be less without the
company of men? Yet it is not unknown to all men how hurtful and perilous
the biting of a mad dog is; for if there be not presently very good remedies
used against it, then will the same man be mad also, and all other men that
shall be bitten by the said mad man. Wherefore we will in this fourth Chapter
speak of certain venomous beasts and worms, whereof we by the grace of God
(in regard of the South countries) have but a few in Germany. Wherefore we
will omit Basiliscus, Amphisibaena, Cerastes, Dipsades, and such like venomous
beasts more, which are to be found only in Africa, and admonish of those that
are known of us, and add unto them the remedies that are requisite against
their venom.

The first are the Ants or Pismires, which truly are provident and laborious
little beasts, whereof we will not here describe the nature, but will discourse
so much as serves to our purpose. Then it is found, that men through their
pissing feel in their skin, the which is more greater than is the stinging
of Nettles, for the place thereof swells. They annoy also thereby all herbs
and trees. And for to drive away the same from thence, you are to take Cowdung,
and temper it with vinegar, and therewith anoint the body of the tree, or take
Pitch or Rosin for it. They shun also the smoke of Brimstone, and the fume
of Marierom in such sort, that thereby they forsake their holes. Some affirm
the same also of Cicorie, or (that is better to be believed) of Esula, which
herbs and the smoke of the sulphur does not only hunt them away, but also
kills them. These Ants and their eggs are also used in physic.

When as any man is stung of Bees, Waspes, or Hornets, then does he not only
complain of great pain and heat, but also of great swelling of the place
where he is stoong, whereto you may use this following most commodiously: Make
a plaster of Linseede meal and salt tempered with vinegar: or stamp
Hollihocke leaves and lay them moist thereon. You may also do the same with the
flowers of Baulme. The same does wild and tame Rue, the milk of new Figs, salt
fish, and the pickle of the same. Item, sea water, when the place is often
moistened therewith. Take Treacle or Mithridate as big as a hemp seed, and
anoint it thereon, or if you have nothing else, then take the moist earth out
of the garden, and anoint it therewith. It is said, that if one be once bitten
of a scorpion, that then never afterward neither Be nor Waspe will bite him.
The same is also written of the worms that grow on Coleworts, when they are
tempered with oil, and anointed therewith. This is also worthy to be thought
upon, that when one bears any odoriferous things, that then the Bees are the
readier and greedier to sting the same party than otherwise. Although that
there be no Cantharides or Spanish flies in Germany, yet are they common at
all Apothecaries. They are also very much used of the Chirurgions, and of
other, as may be seen before in many places: but by reason that some most
vnprouidently take the same in hand, and also will use them inwardly, therefore
cannot I conceal their poison. These Spanish flies breed of the Caterpillars
or little worms of the Fig tree, Pear tree, Fir tree, and Rose tree, etc.
and when one drinks them, then follow there afterward all manner of painful
symptoms, for that one may feel from the mouth even to the neck of the
bladder a sharpness and great exulceration: and he supposes that he always
smells pitch, the right side swells inwardly, the urine will hardly void,
and passes away with blood, and in going to the stool there auoydeth the
scrapings of the bowels, like to them that have the bloody flixe. They lie in
great smart, are also feeble and impotent. The head swimmeth so much, that
otherwhiles they fall to the earth, until at the very last they are bereft of
their understanding. And to remedy these grievous accidents, there must be
given to the patient Sallad oil or some such thing to drink for to bring him
to vomit: and when this is done, then are you to minister unto him a clister
that is sodden with Rice, Hollihocke roots, Fenegreeke, Linseed, Mallows, and
such like. If one may get the right Nitrum, then is it very commodiously used
with Oxymel (our Saltpeter is not the right Nitrum) whereby the rest that
remain sticking in the stomach and in the bowels might be washed off and
expelled. Afterward you are to give him wine and sodden Must to drink, wherein
is sodden Pingles or Cucumber seed. This may also be effected with milk or
honey water: and in like manner also Goosegrease and sodden wine. There is a
pappe of Barley meal to be laid upon the swollen place, made with honey water.
It is also to be noted, that at the first there must no plaster be laid
thereon, for that will do more hurt than good.

When all has bin done that is abouesaid, then are you to anoint the body
with oils that be warm by nature, and then to bathe after it, so that thereby
all that may hurt the body might be drawn out. You must also see that the
patient have always a loose body. He may eat Cockrels, young Buckes or Kids,
and Swines flesh that is very fat: And he shall also sees Linseede with it,
for that mollifieth and dampeth the eagerness of the poison. He shall drink
excessiuely sweet wine. The rindes of Frankincense and sealed earth, the one
or the other, the weight of a quarter of an ounce taken with Must, is also much
commended. Item, there is good for it the decoction of Penniroyall. Item,
Orage, stamped Rue, and the juice of the same drunken with wine. In like manner
also Cow milk that is described in the third part, the twelfth chapter, and
11.. beginning thus, Take Gentian, etc.

But above all these are the Antidota good, as also both the Treacles, the
Mithridate, Alexipharmacon, and such like.

It happens also oftentimes, that the people that travel through the country
do unawares drink an horsleach, which according to the old wont without
interceasing sucketh blood within the body: but if it remain hanging within
the throat, thou may it be seen. But when this happens, then must good heed
be taken that you venture not to get it out with any tongs or other things, for
that commonly they leave their teeth sticking in the flesh, whereby afterward
grow grievous impostumes, and it booteth not thereto that they be cut off, they
leave not therefore their sucking: and if they fall deeper into the body, and
come to hang at the mouth of the stomach, that is easy to be known by their
drawing. Thus for to cure this accident, he is to drink pickle of fish, or any
other salt water, holding it in the mouth, and to gargarize therewith. Item,
Angelica sodden with Beetes. Further, take Rue, sees it in vinegar, and drink
it, or hold it in the mouth, according to the place where the worm is
fastened. Or take Vinegar that is heated with a glowing iron, melt butter
therein, and give the patient to drink of this vinegar. For this is also very
good the meal of Lupins tempered with water, and the same holden in the mouth.
The Woodlice are a filthy stinking vermin, nevertheless they are said to be
good against all venom, which if they be burnt, and the fume of them received,
they cause the Horsleaches to fall off.

The Flea is a vile troublesome and blood thirsty little beast, which vexes
both man and beast: To drive them away or to kill them, there is no fitter
means than that you keep the chamber always very cleanely, sprinkle it with
water, and sweep out the same clean, for that they do grow of dry dust.
Item, you may also use these things following: Sees Coriander in water, and
therewith besprinkle the chamber, and also let the linen be washed therein.
This same drives also lice away: yet note that of late was written of the
Coriander, that thereby the head take no hurt. Item, take Coriander, wild
Thyme, seed of Tribulus aquaticus, and Elderne leaves, sees them in water
enough, and besprinkle the chamber therewith: this drives away and kills the
fleas. The same virtue is ascribed to the smoke of Penniroyall, and the powder
of Rue strowed in the chamber: and all those things that may be used for Lice
and Woodlice.

The Italians and other nations more have a mind to eat Frogs, which other
nations do abhor: but we will dissuade all the world from them, and
specially such as breed in stinking pondes and waters, and are dunne, which
are not like the right frogs, for they provoke a swelling of the whole body,
with a bleake and yellow color, like unto the Hollie tree: thereupon follows
a short stinking heavy breath, hoarsnesse, and effluxion of the natural
seed. Now then for to remedy this mischance, you must let the patient vomit
mightily, and drink over much wine. For this also may you give him of the
Cipers root beaten a quarter of an ounce.

Further you are then to admonish the patient that he endeavor himself
mightily to run, and walk much, or take some other exercise in hand, thereby
to sharpen the body: and he shall bathe every day.

We have said before, that there is no more perilous venom than that of a mad
dog. And concerning the madness of a dog, it is most perilous in hot times:
as when the Sun enters into Leo, to wit, in the months of July and August;
which thirty days we do not only call the dog days of the Dog star, but also
for that dogs in those days are most inclined to madness, and then hurt men
most of all: wherefore the hunters during these thirty days ought to give to
their hounds meat tempered with hens dung. This madness cease also of it
self when it begins to freeze, and that but seldom.

The signs of a mad dog are these; he will neither eat nor drink, and he
fometh at the mouth and nose, beholds every one ouerthwartly, and with a
heavy look, and biteth as well men as beasts.

If a man be bitten by him, then is there at the first no other accident
perceived, but only that the wound cleanses it self, and is very painful.
Afterward there follows thereby a marvelous extremity, which the Greeks
do call Hydrophobos, which is the fear and fright of the water, which
oftentimes in the dogs and in men is so forcible, that they come out of their
wits. Notwithstanding that they fear most of all the water, yet nevertheless
they throw themselves into it and drown themselves. This fear of the water
they get not all at one prefixed time, but they get chiefly the same (that
neglect the bit most) about the fortieth day, some after the sixth month, yea
some also very well a year afterward.

The ancient Physicians do write that this franticknes of the biting of mad
dogs has manifested it self seven years after that they first were hurt by
them.

They that are infected with this disease, do also get a conuulsion in all the
sinews of the whole body, and chiefly of the face, it will be red, and
thereby comes a great sweat, and extreme feebleness.

Some can abide no light, and others are vexed with an intolerable headache,
many houle like Dogs, and bite all others that they can come by, who will be
afterward as mad as they. The ancient Physicians write also that they be very
few that do recover.

Yet for this has been found many wholesome remedies, whereof we shall speak
hereafter.

There are two kinds of means: the one common, which is good against all
bitings and stingings of all venomous beasts: the second, that is, good alone
against all biting of mad dogs, if one do but presently put it in practice. But
if it be deferred too long, it is used in vain. First, there are some things
that a body must provide to have always in a readiness, that the same may
immediately be adhibited.

Take for this Creuets, and burn them with as much of the roots of Brionie to
ashes; then powne them small and preserve them. Secondly, have always in a
readiness some small beaten roots of Gentian: and then if there be any bitten,
cast in twelve ounces of strong wine, two spoonefuls of the ashes of Creuets,
and a spoonefull of the foresaid roots, and then drink this at four times,
to wit, in the morning early.

Item, for this is also commended the shells of the Lobster if they be powdered
in drink.

Item, one other more that is made of Creuets, and is very like to the former,
to wit, as herafter follows. Take Crduets that are taken in July and August,
burn them alive to powder in a luted pot, and then give the powder in drink
with Treacle, to wit, one dragme and a half with water of Scabious.

Take also two or three dragmes of this powder, and drink it certain days
together with the water of Fumitorie.

Another: Take Gentian, and Myrrh, of each one dragme, Ashes of Crabs a
quarter of an ounce, give thereof every morning with wine: or if the patient be
full of heat, then take fountain water in stead of wine.

Item, the juice of Balm is also very good for this; or to beat the leaves to
powder and drunken with wine. In like manner one may also twice a week take a
dragme in weight of the great Treacle, or of the Treacle Diatessaron, be it
wiih Wine or any other distilled water.

You have also in the sixth Part, the fifteenth Chapter, and twelfth. a water of
the great Bur, which is also wonderful good against the biting of a mad dog.

Now a days is much commended (and that by experience) the juice of Quinces if
one take thereof once a day three or four ounces, that the same will
maruellously preserve one from this venime.

And now to preserve this juice, you must let it sees so long by a mild fire
till that the skum is separated and taken away; then you may preserve it in a
glass with a narrow mouth, and power thereto a little Sallad oil: it is also
good for all other venimes.

It is also written that clarified Honey taken daily should preserve one that he
cannot be annoyed with the biting of mad dogs. In like manner if one eat the
Liver of the same made dog, that the same should preserve the bitten person
from all symptoms.

The wild Roses powdered and drunken, are also found very good for it.

Besides all these foresaid remedies, one may use things that cleanse the
infected blood, which one may do with these medicines following, if the same be
drunken fourteen days together: Take sirupe of Fumitorie, of sweet Apples,
and Pomegranates, of each half an ounce, water of Fumitorie, Buglosse, and
Cicorie of each one ounce; mingle them together and drink it fasting.
Afterward use this purgation: take new Cassie three quarters of an ounce,
confection of Hamech one quarter of an ounce, Inda one dragme, make a Bolus or
bit thereof with Cinnamom and Sugar, swallow it down in the morning, and fast
six hours after it. For this is specially commended, Hiera with Coloquint:
For this is also good, thick milk, called Lac scistum, for that it loses,
and does withstand the venime. And as soon as the body is purged, and after
that all the foresaid remedies have been used, it is then requisite, that one
think upon the biting or wound. First the biting is not to be healed, but it
must be well rubbed with Garlic, vinegar and salt, so long till it come to
bleed apace. Some bind thereon living hens and pullets: but look what is
written thereof in the description of the Plague, whereas we have spoken of the
Plaguesore.

Make also a salve of the juice of Onions, juice of Rue, Vinegar, and honey,
wherewith anoint the wound three or four days together keeping it clean,
the which will bring all things in security.

This does also Garlic fried with Butter and laid thereon. Or an onion made
hollow and filled up with Treacle, and roasted in the ashes, whereof we have
before admonished. And you may also take two handfuls of Rue, fry it twice it
butter, and apply it twice a day to the wound. Others take Garlic, Rue, salt,
Frankincense, Mirrhe, of each a like much, beaten all together, and a plaster
made thereof with wine.

Take Cheruil seed, sees it in fair water and drink thereof, wash the wound
also therewith: this is good without and within.

The powder of Verueine is also commended for it that is gathered between both
our Lady days for to strew on the wound.

There is also good for it all Nettle waters drunken: likewise the Nettle seed
stamped to grout and laid upon the wound. The Fennel root is used after the
same manner. These are now things that may be used outwardly, and that not only
three or four days as some suppose, but also some days together with other
things more.

For as we have admonished before, this venom does otherwhiles not appear in
a twelve month after it: as may be seen, if one be bitten with a mad dog, and
handles a Raven within a year after, that the same foul will be mad, or the
man will be mad again.

It is also especial good that the wound be anointed within and round about
with Treacle or Mithridate. For this also are requisite the peeles of new
Melons and Pompeons beaten and mingled with wine, and laid over the wound.

Item, new onions tempered with vinegar, or if the same cannot be had new, then
are the same to be sod, and to drink the decoction, and lay it also on the
wound, or tempered with honey and wine, and so let it lie three days thereon.
The kernels of nuts being chewed by one fasting and laid upon the wound, should
do marvelous much good.

Or take great roots of Smallage, sees them in water and drink the decoction
thereof: stamp the roots and lay them on the wound.

Item, Rue mingled with Salt; these and the like things may be used at the
first without all danger. But in case that the vinome of this mad beast lies
hidden and dead a while, and the patient thereby supposes to have escaped all
peril, the which nevertheless yet shows it self afterward, wherefore
there are diverse that have a manly heart, and had rather live a painful life,
than to die a painful death.

Of the actual cauterie and incision.
SOme that will play surely, and will prevent all these before mentioned
mischiefs, do begin this cure at the first by incision and adustion, so that
they cut out the sound flesh round about the wound according to the situation
of the member, and also draw out the blood, and make the wound much wider: for
how much larger the wound is, so much the better will the blood be drawn out,
and the better is the wound to be handled, which is to be committed to the
expert Chirurgions: but burning is better than cutting for it, and it is
commended to be more surer and more forcible, because the fire tameth all
venomes, and lets not the same pearce and deeper into the body; and also the
wounds heal not so fast, which must be kept open so long as may be.

These things following are very requisite for to keep the wounds open, as all
salt things, powned wild Garlic, juice of Onions, and powned Wheat that is
made moist. These things make the wound wider: and after such kind of incision
or adustion set on boxes, and scarifie the sound flesh, that thereby the
infected blood may be sucked out. And if it be perceived that the wound heal
too fast, then must the same of necessity be opened again with fire, or with
incision, that there be no venom included. How the wounds are to be cured,
that is known to al Chirurgions.

To conclude, this is to be added, in case that neither the easy remedies now
mentioned, neither yet the incision nor adustion had been used at the first,
then are they to be omitted and left altogether, and not put the patient to
such pain in vain, for then cannot the venom that is spread over all the
body, be drawn any more to the wound, neither be drawn out.

An order of diet for them that are bitten by a mad Dog.
ALl they that are bitten with a mad dog, must use those things that do
withstand poison, and interrupt the violence thereof, that the same penetrate
not to the inward parts. For this does first of all serve stong wine sodden
thoroughly, and milk for his drink: it is also good that you put into his
meat, Garlic, Onions and Leekes: let him use Treacle and Mithridate
sometimes. He shall feed every day upon eager and sower meats that do hinder
the venom. Sweating before and after meat is also very good for him. But
above all things is the Ellebore highly commended, if he use the same but once
in forty days: for it is proved already that those that were vexed with the
fear of the water, that they were only cured by the taking of Ellebore, when
as they had used all other means and remedies before.

Toades are beasts well known, that are full of cold venom. Against this is
to be used all that which is described against the venom of the Frogs that
haunt stinking pooles.

That Lice be loathsome and filthy vermin and beasts, is known to the whole
world, and has sufficiently been showed in the first part, the third Chapter,
and eighth.

Milk that is turned does sometimes very quickly strangle them that do drink
the same, for that through her clotting it stops the pipes of the Lights.
Against this must the Whay of milk be tempered with Vinegar, and given to the
patient to drink, and the patient compelled to take it. The same does also
dried Nep, and the juice thereof. In like manner also Angelica tempered with
vinegar and water. Item, Thymus with wine and ley, and some ashes with it. All
salt things must be shunned, for thereby will the milk be turned more. In like
manner must heed be taken from vomiting, for the clots might very well strangle
one.

Ox blood is very gross when it comes first from the Ox, it will be soon
hard and clotted: this stifleth a man also if he drink thereof, for it setleth
it self at the vuula, and strangleth a man, it refrigerateth the sinews of
the throat, whereby the same is stopped: the tongue will be red, and one may see
some part of the blood sticking between the teeth. He must also be kept from
vomiting, for the clotted blood remains in the throat. In this must the
blood be resolved and the body opened. And for this are especial good great
Figs that are not very ripe, and yet full of milk, when they are given with
vinegar and water. The juice of Bean straw with vinegar, and Goosegrasse
eaten, or used otherwise is also very good. All they that do recover of it, do
avoid much filth and other matter through their stools, and the belly and
stomach must be often anointed with Barley meal and Honey tempered together.

Catterpillers (which are the right destruction and spoil of all plants and
gardens) are also in some sort venomous, yet the one more than the other: but
they that live on the Fur trees are the most venomous. If it chanced that any
body swallow one of these, then presently does he get a great pain throughout
the whole mouth, and therewith a swelling of the belly, of the tongue and the
stomach, with a pain in the belly, that it seems that his belly is full of
worms, his whole body will be burning, and gets a great distemperature in
the stomach. This venom is to be remedied with those things that are ordained
against the venom of the Spanish flies: but in the stead of Sallad oil, the
oil of Quinces is much better.

Snakes and Adders are of diverse sorts throughout the world, and Africa, Media,
Echatana, and Troglodytis, are marvelous much plagued therewith, even as now a
days Italy is in some places. Wherefore may Dutch men and English men account
it for a blessing of God, that they cannot say as men do of Africa, that there
are more men slain by venom than by the sword. And because this seventh part
discourses only of poison of venomous beasts, we will add here to the rest all the principallest things that are set forth by the learned against the biting
of snakes and such like venomous beasts.

Wherefore we will speak first of the root of Aron, that is, Cuckopit: when
Snakes are smoked therewith, then will they be all as if they were drunken, and
remain stiff. In like manner, when this root is beaten to powder, mingled
with oil of Bays, anointing the place therewith where they do use, then will
they be hunted away. This root is also to be drunken in red wine against all
venom.

If the fruit of the tree Platanus be taken with wine, then does it withstand
all stingings of Snakes and Scorpions.

Elecampane roots drunken in Wine, are also good against the stinging of
venomous beasts.

The ^oo^e of Mandr^gera is also good for it, principally if any must be cut or
adusted for these venomous beasts bitings, for it brings the patient into a
deep sleep, and makes him wholly insensible, even as before we have taught.

If ^b^lus be set on fire, then does the smell of the same drive away all
manner of Snakes. The leaves thereof laid in Wine, and drunken thereof, are
also good against all kinds of poisons.

The leaves of the Ash tree wroong out, and the juice thereof drunken, and laid
upon the biting, withstandeth the poison of Snakes as vehemently as any thing
in the world: For this tree has such an antipathy with the venom of snakes,
that the snakes shun the shadow of this tree. Plinus writes also, that if one
compass them in one place with fire, and in another place with Ashen wood,
that they had rather run into the fire than be touched with that wood. This bad
worm does also not creep out of his winter hole, before and until that the
Ash tree begins to blow, the which is a marvelous work of nature.
Moreover, the Ash tree shall not let his leaves fall before and until that the
Snakes be cropen again into their holes.

Right Balsam is commended against all venom of Snakes: but by reason that we
have not the same, there are many kinds thereof distilled, wherein every one is
to use all diligence that he can to attain to the right Balsam as near as he
can possibly: whereof you shall find diverse descriptions in the last part,
where you shall also have living and golden waters which are very commodious
for it. And for that England and Dutchland (as is already said) are almost free
from these bad beasts: we rest contented with the easiest and best known
things: in like manner leave the Balsamum artificiale to the charge of the
Chirurgians.

Teu^rium do the ancient Physicians say to be the most precious remedy
against the venom of Snakes, whether it be taken in drink or laid upon the
bite. In like sort the great Teucrium, whether the same be taken green, dry,
decocted, or the juice thereof.

Mugwort is also taken to be very good for the biting of Snakes, if the same be
laid in wine, and some thereof drunken and laid upon the wound.

Betony and all herbs of that virtue, as Gilloflowers, etc. the ancient
Physicians do write to have such power against the biting of a snake, that if
this herb be laid round about her, she had rather be killed than creep over
the same herb: for which cause the wine and conserve of this herb are highly
esteemed: so is also the powder and seeds of the same.

Beuercod is good for many things, as is sufficiently before declared in the
description of other sicknesses. And amongst other it is also good against the
biting of snakes, and biting of other venomous beast, if the same be mingled
with other things, according to the importance of the beast that has fo
bitten. This if it be used in time of need, you may take thereof half an ounce
with wine.

Buckes and Goats hair set on fire drives away all snakes.

Penniroyall withstandeth all snakes by nature, by reason of the savor or
smell: wherefore it is to be strewed upon the place where as the snakes have
bitten one, and be drunken with Wine.

also good for all other kinds of poison if one drink the sap thereof with Wine
or Honey: but the wild purslaine is the best.

The juice of the flowers of Selfeheale drunken with Wine, should be good for
all the venom of beasts.

The nuts of the great and small Cipers trees, which may be had at every
Apothecaries, stamped and drunken with Wine, are also good for this. In like
manner the same Cipers herb (which is to be found in many gardens) is very
highly commended, for that it withstandeth all poison of snakes if it be
drunken with wine.

Nardus seed is renowned to drive away snakes by his smell and savor.

the biting of Snakes.

thereupon.

been declared, but chiefly against biting of snakes: it is commended above all

Snake to have come near this herb. In like manner the seed of it is much
commended being taken with wine.

The juice of Onions applied to the biting of a Snake and tempered with Honey,
is very good against venom.

The Gnats that plague beasts and men with their sting in summer, and in like
manner all plants, are depelled by the smoke of Pomegranate peeles, and of
Galbanum, also by the smoke of Nardus seed and Lupins.

But forasmuch as (through the grace of God) we have no Scorpions here in
England nor in Dutchland, therefore it is no great need to write much thereof,
by reason that all that is written against Snakes is also requisite for the
same; yet cannot we conceal this miracle, that the Scorpions themselves are a
remedy against their own poison, if the same be beaten and laid thereon, or
if they be roasted and eaten. In like manner you have their oil, and other their
virtues more described here and there throughout this whole book.

Spiders are well known beasts, whereof there are many sorts described by the
ancient physicians, which as they do differ in fashion, color, and in weauing
there webs, so they do also differ in poison.

Albertus does describe eight kinds of them, which we have all here in this
country, Some do live by catching of Flies: others by catching of water worms
and small fishes. Some also are enemies to the Toade and Snake; for that it
has been seen that such Spiders have letten themselves down by one of their
threads upon the heads of such beasts, and leave them not before and until they
have killed them. Other are deadly enemies to the young Euets, which through
their spinning do bind the mouth too, and do smother them, and hale them into
their nets, that thereby they might suck out all the moisture of them, and by
the diversity of the venomous nourishment alters also their venomous nature,
whereby the same is sometimes more forcible or more mild. Also their manner of
dwelling is not all one: there dwell many in houses, other in the fields and in
the hedges: some dwell willingly by the water sides, but we will not write here
any more of their natures, but discover their venomes. Of all the venomes of
the Spiders, that which the Greeks call Phalangium is the most renowned, and
albeit that the same is not known in England nor Dutchland, yet we will
describe the nature of this venom, whereby one may be taught to assuage all
the lesser stingings, and the harm that may come thereby, and how the same may
be cured. The Greeks call this species of Spiders the Wolf, for a difference
from other Spiders that are not so noisome. These Spiders are hairy, and have a
great head. The she Spider (which only spinneth) brings three hundredth young
ones at one time, and she receives also the reward of her noisome
fruitfulness, to wit, that she is killed of her own young ones, and afterward
sucked out, which they would also do to their father if he with might did not
withstand them. If then any body be stung with this Phalangia, then will the
place of the stinging be red, nevertheless without pain or heat, howbeit that
it yields some moisture, and as soon as there is used any medicine against
it, then begins the body to shake, the sinews of the knees and the inward
parts will be feeble, and they will be conuulsed as if it were the crampe, they
take a great anguish in the members, the patient can scarcely make water nor go
to stool, he gets a sweat throughout all his body, his eyes run and are
dim. Against this must the ashes be used that are burnt of the Fig tree,
tempered with salt and wine, and so laid thereon. Item, Hartwort, Barley meal,
and Vinegar tempered to pap.

You are also to wash the sting with some water wherein Smallage was sodden. To
bathe often is also very good. For this one is to take a quarter of an ounce of
any of these seeds following with wine, to wit, the seed of Southernwood, Annis
seed, Hartwort seeds, the rindes of the tree Platanus, or the seed of
Melilot. Item, the fruit or rind of Tamariscus, or wild Cipers sodden in wine.

Some will say if one take the juice that is strained out of Crabs with milk
and seeds of smallage, that thereby the patient will immediately be whole.

Plinius writes of the water of Smallage, that the same has a special virtue
against the stinging of the Spider.

And there may be used against the Spider Marierome, Nardus seed,
Southernwood, Hyacinthum, juice of Mulberies, field berries, and Framboyes,
being tempered with honey and wine, or each also alone.

Woodlice, albeit that they be good against diverse other venomes, yet
nevertheless are they very loathsome to all men, shrewdly biting, and
bloudthirsty, whereby they take away a bodies sweet sleep, and spedially vex
the young children, for which there has been much counsel sough to drive them
away.

For this is very good the smoke of the great Fern. Item, if Horseleaches be
cast on the fire, and they be fumed with it. Birchboyes set in the chamber
drive them also away.

The water that we use daily for our necessity has by nature no venom in it,
yet if one drink it too cold, likewise strong Wine, and by and by after
bathing, or after that one has run hard, then does there ensue great pain
and stitches, which diseases may be expelled thorough letting of blood and
purging.

Of the worms that breed in the belly grow diverse diseases. In like manner
also of such that grow in the fingers, in the arse-gut, in the wounds, and
other places more. What is to be done thereto, that have we sufficiently
declared elsewhere.

Thus for a conclusion of these venoms of beasts, and of the seventh part of
this book, there is yet somewhat to be added that some account for witchery,
to wit, when there is given to any body that which excitateth love, by which
commonly such miseries do follow, that they that receive the same become mad
and foolish, like as daily experience does teach us.

Ouidius writes that Philtra do weaken the wits, and by their virtues they
make men foolish and mad. This do we call the lovers herb, as if witchery had
power to command one to love another.

This witchery (or rather this poisoning) do women use most of all, intending
thereby to constrain men that they should love them. The ungodly heathen that
have excelled therein, and chiefly the Thessalonians, have taken great delight
therein, and also strange misbeleefe, that are rather to be concealed than
disclosed.

It is very difficult to ordain any certain remedy for it, because it cannot
well be known (for that there be so many kinds of them) by what means it has
been put in practice, so that the same must rather be judged by the signs
apparent to the eyes, than by any other signs: yet have I found out two things
described by famous Physicians, which are very good for this purpose: but the
first thereof is very strong, and is not be used without counsel, but the
other is somewhat safer and easily approved.

Take a Valerian root with the herb, five or six roots of Gentiana
Cruciata, a small handful of the roots of wild Cucumbers, and a quart of Wine
with half as much water: afterward sees it softly about a quarter of an
hour, and drink thereof morning and evening: And you are to sees therewith a
little Cinkfoyle.

The other: Take the middlemost green rindes of Elderne shread small one
handful, let it dry well, afterward sees it in a pint and a half of Goats
milk till about the half, strain it, and drink it as aforesaid. Hereof will
some say, that the same purges all things whatsoever has been given unto any
body by women to this intent, although it had been done three years before.

The end of the seventh part.
The eight and last Part of this Book, contains sundry things.
THe eight and last part of this general Practice of Physic, is ordained for
those things that do not concern any special diseases, which are before
sufficiently described, but that are meet and good for to help sick persons,
to strengthen the weak, and to maintain health: which also may be used in the
kitchen for pleasure, and for other purposed mo; as Electuaries, Potions,
Conserues, and Confections of all kinds of Fruits, of Flowers, of Roots, and
of other Plants: Oils, Sirupes, and Juices: Golden and vital Waters: Hearbed
and Aromaticall wines, and such like; whereof otherwhiles has been admonished,
how that the same may be prepared, and to the end that the virtue of all them
might be known. Wherefore we will also declare their virtues and operations.

The first Chapter. The Confection of Calmus.
THis very precious and necessary Confection, is prepared after sundry
manners: for besides this, that it is very common, it is also very pleasant and
acceptable. But first of all there is to be noted, that the ancient Physicians
had another root, and not the yellow Lilly root, which we have now in use:
yea ours is not to be compared to the old Acoro, neither in virtue nor in
operation. The learned do esteem the Calmus to be the right Acorus, which is
also very requisite for this Confection. Other be of opinion, that it is the
great Galingal, which is also good for it: Wherefore (in mine opinion) this
first Confection is to be used rather than the other following. And if so be
that you had rather have it with the taste of Sugar, than of honey, then boil
Sugar to a sirup. First, we will describe one of the Confections of Mesua,
whereof there is always one found ready in all well furnished Apothecaries
shops, and afterward one other sort more, whereof each one may take that
likdth him best: Take the root Secacul, or in the stead of it, take of our
powned Calmus, and prepared Pingles, of each six ounces: sees the roots in
fair well water, and stamp them to grout: afterward put six pound of the
best well scummed honey unto it, and then sees it all together by a soft or
gentle fire, until the moisture of the roots be all consumed, and stir it
about, to the end that the roots burn not: when as it is decocted thick
enough, then take it from the fire, and temper these things following amongst
them, powned very small; to wit, Pepper one ounce, long Pepper, Cloves, Ginger,
Roses, and Mace, of each half an ounce, Nutmegs, Galingall, and Cardamome, of
each three drag. temper them well together. This Confection is marvelous good
against all diseases of the sinews, it sharpeneth the wit, it aswageth the
headache, and is also good against all old sicknesses, but especially against
all rheumes, which fall out of the head into the breast.

The second: Take Calmus which bears the yellow Lillies, which grows in
moist places, and is fair and of a horseflesh color, 16. ounces, make it very
fair and clean: afterward cut it in thin slices, and sees it so long in
fair water, until they be mellow, then strain the water well from it, and
power a pot of red wine unto it, and let it boil well, then power the wine
from it, and stamp it all to grout, and put six pound of clarified Honey unto
it, and let it sees well with the wine unto a Confection, at last put unto it
six ounces of Ginger, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cardamome, long Pepper, and
Galingall, of each one ounce and a half, Pepper three quarters of an ounce,
beaten all together very small.

The third: Take Calmus prepared as before, and chopped small, two pound,
clarified Honey four pound: sees the roots very well in red wine, afterward
put them to the Honey, and let it so sees by a mild fire until it be very
thick; then temper therewith small chopped Almonds, eleven ounces, Ginger four
ounces, Pepper half an ounce, long Pepper and Cloves, of each one quarter of
an ounce, Cinnamom one dragme and a half, Galingall, Cucubes, Cardamome,
Nutmegs and Mace, of each one dragme, stir them so long together with a
wooden pestle, until that it be cold.

The fourth: Take dry sliced Calmus one pound, and sees it in two quarts of
small wine; afterward powne it to grout, and take Honey or Sugar two pound, let
it sees till it be thick, when it is a little cold, then temper with it small
cut Ginger six ounces, powned Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, and Cardamome, of each
one dragme and a half, long and common Pepper, of each three quarters of an
ounce, Galingal one drag. and a half, Greins one quarter of an ounce, temper
them all together.

The fifth: Take Calmus cut it in shiues, and take twenty ounces of it; sees it
in three pints of red wine, so long until all the wine be consumed; stamp it,
but not too small, then take a pint of clarified Honey, and let it boil by a
small fire, afterward put the prepared roots unto it, and 8. ounces of small
sliced Ginger, then let it boil again by a mild fire, unto a confection, when
it is lukewarm, then temper with it common and long Pepper, Cloves, Cinnamom,
Nutmegs, and Ginger, of each half an ounce, Galingall, Mace, Cardamome,
Cucubes, and Greines, of each a quarter of an ounce beaten small together,
temper them so long until they be all waxen cold.

The sixth with Sugar: Take Calmus as before, 12. ounces, sees it in Muscadell
until that the wine be all wasted, stamp it to grout, and put thereto four
pounds of common clarified Sugar, with as much wine or water, then put the
roots unto it, and let it sees until it be thick; when it is a little cold,
then temper amongst it Ginger cut very small four ounces, Cinnamo^, Cardamome,
Nutmegs, Mace, Cloves, Calmus and Cucubes, of each three drag. temper them
well, and let them sees so long as one would sees Eggs hard, then keep it in
a gally pot.

How to make Veriuice for the Kitchen, and for Physic.. 1.
VEriuice is to be pressed out of the best Grapes a good while before they be
ripe, and if so be that one will keep it long, then must the same be sodden:
but if so be that you will use this Veriuice in the Kitchen, then temper a good
deal of Salt amongst it, and stir it the space of an whole hour, afterward
put it into a small vessel, and cast some unripe Medlars into it, then shake it
well about, to the end it may work and be clear. But if so be that you will
keep the Veriuice for Physic and without salt, then fill a glass with a
narrow neck, and power upon it some Sallad oil, then will it remain good the
space of a whole year.

There may also be made of this unsalted Veriuice a sirupe called de Agresta,
to wit, in this manner: Take the juice of unripe Grapes, when it is first pressed
out, five parts, white Sugar 3. parts, and let it sees softly unto a sirupe:
further, then clarify it with the white of an Eg. This sirupe is marvelous
good in great heat, it swageth thirst, allayeth all wambling, parbraking, and
laske, which is caused of the gall: it is also very meet in hot choleric
Agues, and above all measure good for all women with child, which be inclined
to vomiting, for that it strengthens the stomach, and withstandeth all
venime.

The 2. Chapter. Of the artificial Balm which may be used in stead of the
right Balsamum.
BEcause that the right Balsam is no where to be gotten, or although it be
brought unto us, yet common people cannot have the same, by reason of the
dearness: wherefore have many Physicians endeavored themselves for to distill
such an oil, which might have the same efficacy and virtue: and verily the
Physicians and Chirurgians have found therein an especial operation, wherefore
I cannot pretermit the description of some of them.

First, this ensuing is a very precious remedy against the pox, against all
diseases of the mother, and of the stomach.

Take fair clean oil of Turpentine sixteen ounces, stop it very close;
afterward take Lauander, Sage, Betonie, Roses, Rosemarie, Mints, and Bayleaues
of each a small handful, roots of Angelica, of Ireas, of Valerian, Elecampane
roots, and Diptamus of Candy, of each one dragm, flowers of Burrage, of
Buglosse, of Lauander, and flowers of Spike, flowers of Sage, of Cammomill and
Stechas, of each one quarter of an ounce, Annis one drag. and a half, Piony
roots, Licorice and Spica of Indy, of each one dragme, peels of Citrons, and
of Oranges, of each two scruples; stamp them all small together, and then
power unto it the oil of Turpentine, and so let it steep the space of a whole
day, with meetly much water with it, that it be covered therein: afterward
distill it out again in water, at the first with a gentle fire, until it be
warm, and that so long as any oil or water does come out of it, afterward
separate the oil from the water.

Secondly, if you will distill it once again, then put to the foresaid water
and oil 3. ounces of liquid Storax, and distill it as before.

Thirdly, take red Storax two ounces, Frankincense, Myrrh, Lacca, Masticke,
Bdellium, and Benzoin, of each one ounce and a half, stamp them all together
and distill it as before.

Fourthly, take Ginger, Galingall, Zeduarie, and Gentian, of each one quarter
of an ounce, Cubebes, Cardamome, Greines, and Pepper, of each one dragme and a
half, selected Rubarbe and Saffron, of each half a dragme, Nutmegs, Mace,
Cloves, and Calmus, of each one ounce, stamp them all small together, and put
it into a glass body: then put unto it again the foresaid oil and water,
let it so stand and steep, and distill it afterward, then separate the oil
from the water, and keep it well stopped.

You have also in like manner in the second part, the sixth Chapter, and third.
an artificial Balm, which was ordained for the Emperor Ferdinandus, and
another in the first part, the twelfth Chapter, called a Hypobalsamum.

This following is also highly renowned: Take selected Myrrh, Aloe, Indy
Spica, Dragon blood, Frankincense, Bdellium, Balsam fruit, Saffron, Mastick,
Gum, Stechas, red Styrax, Laudanum, and Beuercod, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Turpentine three ounces and a half, yellow Cowslips half a handful:
further, distill them all together as is before said.

These three last be very forcible against all Palseys, if the lame members be
anointed therewith, and if that one do drink a drop or twain thereof with
wine, it is also very good. These Balmes be also good for all fresh wounds, so
that they may be healed in two or three days therewith. They be also very good
against all diseases of the sinews.

Another which is common with all Chirurgians: Take selected Myrrh, Aloe,
Spica of Indie, Dragonbloud, Frankincense, Momy, Opopanacum, Bdellium,
Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla, Laudanum, Balsam fruits, Saffron, Masticke, Gum, and
liquid Storax, of each one quarter of an ounce, fresh Beuercod two dragmes and
a half, Muscus half a dragme, Turpentine four ounces and a half, powne all
that is to be powned, and add the Turpentine unto them with a little water,
and distill all together in seething water, as is said before.

Of Beer.. 1.
COmmon Beer is made in this country of many kinds of Grain, as of Oats, of
Barley, and of Wheat; whereby it is also of sundry natures: That which is made
of Barley is cold of nature, in comparison of wine: that which is made of
Barley and Oats, is less binding, and makes also fewer winds, and does also
nourish less: that which is brewed of Wheat or of any other grain, is hotter,
warmer, and more binding, the thicker it is, the worse; the thinner the better:
that which is well Hopt, causes one to piss freely, and loses the body, but
it is not wholesome for them that have weak brains; and that is vnwholsomer
wherein ye seeds of Rue be decocted, for that the drunkenness of such Beer
wears away much flower, then the drunkenness of wine, for that it makes
gross vapors in the head, and a tough flime, which will hardly be digested. If
it be not well sodden, then does it cause much wind, puffs up the belly. But
very old and well sodden beer, does make people fat, increases the blood, and
(in women that give suck) the milk, and that especially if the same be brewed
of good corn. Thus for to keep beer long, take about half a pound of
prepared Coriander unto a barrel of beer, and sees the same in two quarts of
the same beer, afterward strain it, and wring it out, and power it warm
into the vessel, yet make it tight, and let it stand so still a day and a
night. Some do take a new earthen pot, knock the same in pieces, and cast it
into the vessel, and put also unto it a new laid egg.

The 3. Chapter. Of Clarret wine, Hyppocras, and Herbwines.
THese aromaticall wines and such like have no certain prescription, for that
each one makes them according to his own good liking and pleasure, the one
puts much spice unto it, the other much Sugar, and another less of the one
or of the other. Some do also make them with Honey, like as hereafter some do
follow for an example.

Take elected Cinnamom three ounces, cleansed and small cut Ginger and Greines,
of each one ounce, Galingall one ounce and a half, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cardamome,
and Cucubes, of each one quarter of an ounce, being powned al together grossly,
power a quart of wine upon it, and stop it tight, afterward set it a whole
night in a warm place. This being all done, then take four quarts of wine,
and one quart of clear skummed Honey, power the Honey unto a little wine, and so
let it sees softly together: afterward then power the four quarts of wine
unto it, and all the steeped Spices, and let it cool a little, then power it
so through a straining bag, and that so oftentimes together until the wine
run clear thorough it. This Claret wine may be put into a little vessel,
and the spices thorough which the wine has run, are to be hanged in the
vessel in a long bugge, then will it remain good a long time. This potion is
very good against all cold and moist diseases of the head, of the brains, and
thee stomach. It is also good for all cold women, and for all old people: it
strengthens the digestive virtue, provoke natural heat, and consumes the
Phlegma.

Another: Take Species de gemmis frigidis three dragmes, Aromatici Rosati one
dragme, Cinnamom one quarter of an ounce, white Sugar seven ounces, good strong
wine one quart, steep them therein, and power it oftentimes thorough, as is
said before. Of this Claret wine are they to drink oftentimes which have a
weak stomach, and an obstructed Liver, or to steep sometimes therein a piece
of bread.

A common Claret wine: Take Cinnamom, Pepper, and Greines, as much as you
please, clarified Honey also as much as you list, power it then all together
thorough a woollen bag, as before. You may also take Cloves, Nutmegs, and
other Spices: in like manner also Sugar in stead of the Honey.

You have also in the third part, the eleventh Chapter and 5.. a Claret wine
called Stelladia, which is much used in Italy. There is also another sort made
which is almost like unto some of the former, but there be not so many spices
taken for it: to wit, but half an ounce of powned Ginger, Cardamome one
dragme, and Sugar half a pound, or more, unto a quart of wine, and so filtred
together.

There is also an aromaticall wine which is called Hipocras made thus: Take
Cinnamom 2. ounces, sliced Ginger one ounce, Greines one quarter of an ounce,
Galingall, Cloves, Nutmegs, Cucubes, and Cardamome, of each one drag. of these
gross powned spices you shall take unto a quart of wine one ounce and a half,
according to that you will have the Hippocrasse strong, Sugar half a pound or
more; then set it in a warm place to steep a whole night, and afterward
power it thorough the bag as al ye rest. There is commonly taken for this red
wine. This Hipocras has the same virtue as the Claret wine has: yet are all
young people to refrain from such like drinks, and from Malmsey and Muscadell,
to the end that they do not increase heat by heat. This Hipocras and Claret
wine may also be well made for all weak bodies, that it be somewhat laxatiue.

But if so be that there be any sick persons which be forbidden wine, or if
that he drink not the same willingly by nature, and that nevertheless the
decoctions did not agree with him, then may this potion following be made,
called Hippocras fontis: Take Cinnamom, Figs, Cloves, and Ginger, of each one
quarter of an ounce, Grains one dragme, good well water a quart, which is
colored well with red Saunders, and then put the spices beaten gross into it,
and let it boil a little. If you will have this potion sweeter, then put in
some Sugar in the seething, or some Honey, and then let it distill thorough the
bag, as is said before.

You have also in the third part, the twelfth Chapter, and 4.. another
aromaticall Wine, which might be placed among these.

In the end of this part shall more aromaticall wines be described.

Of Clisters and their use.. 2.
IF one know how to use these Clisters aright, and to prepare them, then can
there be no more profitable, nor yet safer medicine invented. Therefore there
be before and almost in all sicknesses so many kinds ordained, and thereby
taught how that the same shall be prepared, that it is almost needless to
write any more of them. Nevertheless to prosecute this our method, we will
here discover certain common and mild Clisters. In small Agues, and when the
patient is weak or scant as yet recovered of some long sickness, then are
these ensuing to be used.

Take Mallows, and Violet leaves, of each one handful, boil them well
together: take of this decoction twelve or sixteen ounces, mingle Cassie,
Honey, and course Sugar of each three quarters of an ounce with it, oil of
Olives three ounces, Salt one dragme or somewhat more, temper them all together,
and minister it reasonable warm: for such like Clisters may you take Hen or
Mutton broth.

Another that relaxeth and cools: Take Violet leaves and Mallows, of each
one handful, Mercury, Beetes, and water Lillies, of each half a handful,
Lettice and Purslaine, of each somewhat less: sees them in sufficient water,
and take thereof as much as is before, oil of Violets four ounces, Salt one
quarter of an ounce, and minister it meetly warm.

In hot Agues: Take Beetes, Mallows, Mercury, and Violet leaves, of each one
handful, boil them all together in sufficient water, and then take thereof
twelve or sixteen ounces, Cassie, Honey, Sugar, Salt and Oil, as is said
before.

When the patient does complain of great pain and wind in the belly, then
boil therewith gross powned Fennel seed, Annis, Comin, and Caraway.

There is also an especial Cassie prepared for a Clister, in this manner
following: Take Violet leaves with the flowers, Mallows, Mercury, Beetes, and
Melilot, of each half a handful, sees the same in a little water, strain it
and wring it out, then wash therewith the Cassie out of the Pypes, for to get
all the black out of them, and then afterward sees it short, until it be
thick, when as then you have six ounces thereof, then put nine ounces of Sugar
unto it, and let it sees until it be thick enough. This Cassie does loose
very mildly.

Of confected Seeds.. 2.
HEre we will now speak only of all seeds which be confected with Sugar, as
Coriander seed, Fennel seed, Annis, Comin, Caraway, and such like. Item, of
some Fruits, as Almons, Pingles, Pistaces, Hasell nuts, Cucubes, and of other
mo confected roots, which may be confected with Sugar: and because the same by
reason of the Sugar and otherwise are very pleasant, whereby they will not
only serve for the Kitchen, but also for Physic, wherefore we will here
describe the nature and operation of them all.

We have in the seventh part often admonished of Coriander, and given a caveat
of his venim, that the same ought not to be used unprepared; otherwise it is by
all Physicians advised, that morning and evening confected Coriander should be
used: for it dries up the ascending vapors of the stomach, it strengthens
and dries the brains, it is good against all swimming of the head, and against
the Palsy; it is good for the stomach, and procures sleep, insomuch as then
these virtues be ascribed to the Coriander, to which the Sugar adds only the
pleasantnes, you may look what the Table says of all the other seeds.

The confected Annis seeds are good for them which have a stinking breath, and
cannot sleep, it provoke urine, it quenches natural thirst, it takes away
the windiness of the belly, it is good for all pains of the stomach, against
all diseases of the Liver, of the Lights, of the Matrix, and it helps the
digestion. It is also good against all hoarsnesse, shortness of breath, and
especially for all cold diseases of women, and for all them which be much
plagued with the Whites. Lastly, it augmenteth also much the milk in women.

The confected Fennel seed is good against all poison, and especially against
the venime of Snakes, it moves women's terms, it warmeth the back, it
asswageth the pain of the same, it breaks the stone, it expels urine, the
stone, gravel, and the slime whereof the gravel is engendered, it increases
women's milk, it cures sour belchings of the stomach, it is good against all
wambling and vomiting, it allayeth the Cough, and all hoarsenesse of the
throat. But above all is this Fennel seed commended against the darkness of
the eyes, for it preserves people from all volines on the eyes, it sharpeneth
the sight if one take the same morning and evening, to wit, after meals, and
cheweth the same long.

Co^^^ does grow much in Apulia, it has the same virtue with the Caraway. It
is also very good for them which be plagued with the gravel, and can hardly
make their water.

The Caraway seed is hotter and dryer by nature than the Annis or Fennel,
therefore it is stronger and more forcible; and especially does it warm the
stomach, and all inward parts, it opens all obstructions, it forces urine,
it breaks the stone, it expels sand and gravel, it drives out winds, and
it takes away all pain and chollicke of the belly.

The confected Almonds are good against all diseases of the Lights, and the
throat, against all dry Coughs, and narrownes of the breast, it strengthens
all weak people, and all them which do consume away. The bitter Almonds do
expel urine and gravel, they do dry the brains, and do hinder the ascending
vapors, they withstand all drunkenness, and be good against many diseases of the
breast, and of the lights.

The hasell nuts have in some sort the same nature with the Almonds: but they
with the red shales have an especial operation and virtue for all scowrings
and laskes, and especially to staunch the bloody Flux. All sorts of hasell
nuts be more wholesome confected with sugar than otherwise, as one may see and
read in many places of this book.

The Pingles be also of the same nature with the Almonds, and be especial good
for all leave folks, for that they strengthen much: yet are the kernels to be
laid 24. hours before to steep in Rosewater, and then to be dried again,
for they augment much humane seed.

Of the confected Spices, Peeles, Roots, and such like.. 3.
THe Ginger, the Cinnamom, the Cloves, the Nutmegs, the Mace, Cucubes, Orange
peeles, Citron peeles, Marioram, and the sliced Licorice, are likewise
confected with Sugar. These foresaid do keep all alike the properties of their
natures, and be especial good in time of the Plague, for that they make good
breath, which will not lightly be infected.

It is also to be noted, that all that which is to be confected for physic,
must be covered very thin with sugar, but only the spices may well be
confected somewhat thicker.

The common baked Ginger sugar is thus prepared: Take one pound of sugar, and
sees it with Well water, clarify it as the sugar is wont to be boiled for
baked sugar, and when it begins to be cold, then mix five dragmes of powned
Ginger amongst it, and when you see that it begins to be thick, then power
it upon a stone or a table, which is made fat with a little sallad oil.

Yet another baked sugar: Take Ginger two dragmes and a half, Cinnamom one
quarter of an ounce, Cloves one dragme, Mace and Nutmegs, of each half a
dragme, Sugar one pound, sees it, and do as before. You have in like manner
also in the third part, the eleventh Chapter and 20.. a baked sugar, which
purges mildly, whereof one may take a quarter of an ounce at once.

The 4. Chapter. Of preserved Fruits, Flowers, and other things.
TO the end that all Fruits, Flowers, Rindes, and in fine, all that is
preserved with Sugar or with Honey, be not parted from the former, therefore we
will in this chapter comprehend all that is preserved in Sugar, or decocted, as
Conserues, and also declare their virtues.

How to confect the Elecampane root.. 1.
IN the spring of the year is this root to be dug out of the ground, and
the outtermost peeles to be cut off, the root made very clean, afterward cut
it in somewhat thick shiues or slices: this being done, then sees the same
very softly in two kinds of water one after the other, to the end the
bitterness may be taken away, and be very mellow. Then lay them on a clean
cloth, to the end they may wax somewhat dry. Put them in a leaded pot, and
power meetly hard sodden Sugar upon them (but that it be not too hot) until
the roots be covered. This shall stand so a day and a night, then shall the
Sugar draw all the moisture unto it, which as yet is in the root, and
afterward power the Sugar off again, and boil it unto a sirupe: this being
done, then power it lukewarm upon it, and do this so often as the roots give
any moisture from them.

These preserved Elecampane roots be a very good medicine for all cold
diseases of the bladder. They take away the piping of the breast, and the
shortness of breath. They be also good against the Cough, the spetting of
blood, against the pain of the sides: they strengthen the stomach, and the
digestion: They cleanse also the same from all unclean humors: they break the
stone, and move women's terms: They separate also all tough phlegm of the
breast, they heal the ulcers of the Lights, and all inward parts, and
especially they warm the stomach and the Matrix.

To preserve black Cherries.. 2.
TAke black Cherries as they come from the tree, and then cut off the stalks,
for two pound of Cherries take one pound of Sugar, and sees the same, and
clarify it: when it is then half boiled, put in the Cherries, and then let
them sees all together softly, to the end the Cherries do not break, and that
so long, until that the Sugar be drawn between the fingers with small
threeds. And when as now the broth is almost cold, then put the Cherries in a
leaded pot with the stalks upwards, for so they will remain good a whole
year. And in this manner shall red Cherries also be preserved.

These Cherries be not only acceptable for them that be sick, but also good
for all kind of heat, they moisten the dry mouth, the tongue, and the throat,
they quench thirst, they make appetite, and refresh debilitie. The conserve of
Cherries is thus prepared.

Take black Cherries as many as you please, let them sees well in wine, wring
them thorough a cloth, or thorough an hairen strainer, and afterward let it
sees again until it be thick, stirring it always well about. Unto three
pounds of this juice put two pounds of Sugar, and afterward sees them
together to the full thickness. There may also a Conserve of Cherries be made
with spices, as hereafter follows: Take of the foresaid Conserve whilst that
it is yet warm one pound, and temper powned Cinnamom amongst it, and
Nutmegges, of each one quarter of an ounce, Ginger and Galingall, of each one
dragme, Cardamome, Cloves, Mace, and Lignum Aloes, of each half a dragme. This
latter conserve does strengthen the heart more than the former.

Conserve of Eyebright.. 3.
TAke Eyebright in July with the white flowers, strippe the leaves and flowers
from the stalks; afterward chop them small, and take one pound thereof, and
stamp amongst it two pound and a half of Sugar, and then set it in the Sun,
and stir it well oftentimes about. This is the Conserve of Eyebright which is
very commodious for the Eyes, as in the first Part is sufficiently declared. It
sharpeneth also all dark sight, it dries the brains of all cold superfluous
humors, it strengthens the Liver, and opens all obstructions, it expels
the yellow Iaundise, and the Ague that proceeds of an unclean stomach. In
conseruing of all flowers and herbs is to be noted, that all they that are
hot and dry, as Lauander, Marioram, Balm, Sage, Mints, and such like, one is
to take to one pound of them, two pounds and a half of Sugar: but to all that
is moist, as Burrage flowers, and Buglosse flowers, etc. is but two pound to be
taken.

Conserve of Betonie.. 4.
BEtonie is very highly and woorthily reputed of all Physicians, whereof there
be three kinds, to wit, brown Betony which is the upright Betony, and also the
Conserve which we will here describe. The second kind are our Gilloflowers. The
third sort be Cowslips, whereof we will speak hereafter in their due place.
This Conserve of Betony is therefore not unjustly commended, seeing these
virtues ensuing be ascribed unto it. Some do write that it is good against the
crampe, against the palsy, and against the falling sickness; it is also good
against madness, against spitting of blood, and against the Sciatica; this
herb is also good against all pain of the stomach of the kidneys, and of the
bladder, of the liver, milt, and of all inward parts, it expels urine, it
loses, and it helps digestion: it is also good against belching, it
cleanses the breast, it withstandeth the dropsy the Ague, and it moves
women's terms. In fine, it is especial good for all inward sicknesses: lastly,
it is also good against all venime. If that one desire to make a conserve of
it, then take only the flowers for it, which are to be powned together with
Sugar, like as is taught at the first.

How the greater Pimpernell roots are to be preserved.. 5.
TAke the roots of the greater Pimpernel which be about one finger thick,
wash them well, scrape them, and cut them in pieces about the length of a
finger: but cut them longwise, and take out the heart of it, then power fresh
Well water upon it, and let them sees like as is said of the Elecampane
roots, but they must not utterly lose their bitterness. This being done, power
decocted Sugar, or Honey unto it: and when it is waterish, then boil it again,
and that so often as is needful. These roots expel urine, grauel, and the
stone, they strengthen the kidneys and the bladder, they cleanse them from all
uncleanness, they assuage all pains of the bowels, which do come through cold
causes, and they be good against the suffocation of the mother in time of the
plague, they be good against all bad air if they be holden in the mouth.

How Pears are to be preserved after two ways.. 5.
YOu may take such Pears as you think good which be new gathered from the
tree, but none other but those that be sound. If they be too hard, then let
them lie in a warm place the space of three or four weeks, until they begin
to be somewhat mellow: but handle them not much, for that thereby will they
quickly rot. If so be you will preserve them, then have an earthen pot ready
and lay in the bottom of this pot some dried Vine leaves or Nut leaves, and
thereon a lay of Pears, etc. leaves and Pears until that the pot be full:
afterward fill up the pot with old wine, and lay some heavy thing upon the
top of it that the Pears may not swim. These Pears may be used for meat,
and also for sick persons for a comforting. The common people which have no
wine may do it after the same manner with water. But if you desire to have them
of a better taste, then take Ginger which is made very fair, cut the same small
and strew it between each row. Item, take a new pot and put Pears into it
(like as is said before) make the pot as close too as is possible: afterward
lay it so in a vessel with Wine, then will they remain fresh and good the
space of a whole year. These Pears may otherwhiles be roasted in the ashes, and
strew them with Fennel seed; and also after supper to eat them, thereby to
close up the stomach, to the end the bad vapors may not ascend toward the
head: they strengthen also the brains, and be especial good for the sight.

If one will preserve Musk pears, then are they to be gathered in fair dry
weather, and in the decrease of the Moon, and when they be very ripe, then
take of the very fairest and soundest of them, pare them very thin, cut off the
stalks and the flower on the top: then make ready a clean sirupe of white
Sugar which is well boiled: when you will take the same off from the fire, then
lay the prepared Pears therein, and let them sees two or three waumes
together, afterward cool a day and a night. This being done, sees the Sugar
once again, and then lukewarm power it upon the Pears, and do that so long
until that you see that the sirupe waxes no moister, otherwise they cannot
continue. If you will have them pleasanter, then put Cinnamom unto them, and
they will be the better for the stomach. These Pears do comfort and refresh
all sick folks that do loath meat, and they close up the stomach against the
ascending of all bad vapors: if they be eaten at the first sitting down to
meat, then do they bind the belly. But if one can get no Musk Pears, then may
other be taken in their stead which be likest of all unto Musk Pears in smell
and taste, and to prepare them as is expressed.

How Oranges are to be preserved.. 7.
THis Apple is wont very seldom to be confected, but his peeles very often,
the which are thus prepared: Take fresh Orange peeles, cut the white out, and
cut the yellow longwise: afterward let it sees so long as one would sees an
Egg hard, and afterward let the broth run off. This being done, then power
Sugar upon it which is well boiled until that be well covered, and so let them
stand the space of eight days in the same, then be they prepared. Oranges are
prepared also as follows: Take the outtermost of fresh Orange peels and cut
the yellow the longest way; afterward sees the same in water until that the
bitterness may come out of it. Power the liquor from it, and then let it sees
again until that they be thorough mellow (to wit in good wine) then stamp
them to grout, and at last put good Malmsey unto it, and so much Sugar as you
please, and so let it sees well together stirring it always well about. Some
do lay them to steep in a strong ley, and afterward steep them in water. But
it is not so good, for that their force will be thereby much abated; so that it
is better to sees them in two or three waters, to the end that they may lose
their bitterness: they strengthen the heart and the vital spirits, and
therewith also the stomach; they do help the consumption, and dry the brains.

Conserve of Burrage.. 8.
AMongst the learned there is debate, whether the name between Burrage and
Buglosse, be exchanged, but therein is no great importance, by reason that both
of them are of one nature, to wit, that the same are to be used in all venomous
and pestilentiall Agues; they do strengthen the heart and all vital spirits:
they withstand all venim, and all heaviness of mind, and they do also cleanse
the blood from all melancholy. In fine, they cool all inward parts. This
Conserve is made of the blew flowers, as we have taught before.

How Calmus is to be preserved.. 9.
TAke fair perfect Calmus, power fair Well water upon it, and let it sees
together, until it be thorough mellow, and that it loose some of his
bitterness: afterward make these roots fair from the outwardmost peeles, and
from all other uncleanness. If so be that some do swell too thick, then cut
them longwise; and in case that they be too bitter, then let them sees once
again in water: and then afterward lay them to dry in a sieue. The Sugar is
certain times to be decocted, like as is taught before, until that all the
moisture be wasted. This confected Calmus is most in all his force like unto
the Ginger, and especially it is very good for all debilitie of the stomach
that is burdened with some cold humor, for that it consumes the same humors,
and besides this, strengthens the stomach: if it be taken in the morning,
then does it keep folks from all pestilentiall air, and makes a sweet breath:
it expels water, and is especial good for all diseases of the bladder and
the kidneys; it forces the stone, and the gravel, and it provoke women's
terms: it is warm and dry by nature, and has an especial operation for to
open all obstructions, etc.

How Citrons are to be preserved.. 10.
A Common manner to preserve Citrons in Sugar or in Honey, is this, that one
peele off the yellow rinds, and cut the white pit in round or long pieces, and
then to separate the sower with the seeds from it. Further, the same is to be
boiled in a water or twain, to the end that the bitterness come from it, and
therewith may be mellow and soft: afterward is boiled Sugar to be powered
lukewarm upon it, and deal with them, like as is taught of the Elecampane
roots. This preserve is very good against all venime, it strengthens the
heart, and all vital powers: it is moist and cold in the first degree, and it
is very safe to be taken.

How Citron peeles are to be preserved.. 11.
TAke the peeles of Citrons, which be not peeled too thin, but that there
remain some of the white with it, and do therewith as is said of the Orange
peels. These peeles be warm and dry unto the third degree, wherefore they are
but seldom to be used: but in cold sicknesses they do help digesture, they
withstand all melancholicke humors, and also all diseases which may proceed
thereof.

How Berberries be preserved.. 12.
YOu must take of the very fairest Berberries that you can get, and wash the
same very clean, afterward sees them in a sirupe of good Sugar, and when the
sirup is sodden short enough, then cast the Berberries unto it, and let it
sees so softly a short time, so that the berries do not break, and then
preserve them in a glased pot. They be good against all heat and all other
inflammation of the blood, and especially of the stomach and liver; they
comfort sick persons in great thirst, they moisten the dry tongue, the throat
and all the mouth. There is also a conserve made of this fruit, and that in
this manner following: Take Berberries as before, and sees the same in wine:
afterward strain them thorough a sleue, or searce, or thorough a cloth, and
then let it be sodden unto a Conserve, stirring it always about. This
Confection stops the bloody flux, and cools the blood which is inflamed
of Cholera, it obstructeth women's terms, and makes appetite to meat, it is
always somewhat stronger than the Conserve of Raspes. Otherwise has it the
same virtue or operation: the Apothecaries do call it Rob de Berberis.

Conserve of Fumitorie.. 13.
THis bitter herb Fumitorie, is very well known; if you will make a Conserve
of it, then take the flowers of it, and powne the same with Sugar, as other
Conserues, and as we have taught of Eyebright. This confection is especial
good for all the^ which be full of unclean blood, and also for all them that
be plagued with scurfe, with the Pox, and with such like uncleanness: it
keeps men in health, and also from all venomous air. Of this Conserve may
freely be taken, as much as the quantity of a great nut, before that men will
bath, for that it expels out the sweat, and al bad humors of the body:
therefore it is also good in the beginning of the Dropsy, for that it opens
the liver and all obstructions of the inward parts; it drives out the yellow
Iaundise by the urine, and is very commodious for many other things.

How the Conserve of the fruit of the wild Rose tree is to be made. 14.
WHen as the fruits of these wild Roses (which be called Priestpintle) begin to
be ripe, then take as many as you please, and sees the same with red wine unto
pap, afterward wring it thorough a sieue, or searse, and so let it sees well
without putting any other thing unto it, with a continual stirring about, as
another conserve. This Conserve has a marvelous operation for to stop the
scou^ing or laske: it is also good for all wambling of the stomach: others do
make it to a Conserve with Must half decocted, wherewith they sees it again,
and cast certain slices of Marmalade unto it, which is especial good for a
cold stomach. This Conserve is more in use with ye common people, than at the
Apothecaries, wherefore we will speak the less thereof.

How Abricockes are to be preserved.. 15.
THe skins of these Abricockes are to be plucked off softly, then power upon
them Sugar decocted hard, not over hot; then let it stand so the space of one
day, or somewhat longer, afterward sees the Sugar again and that so long as
the Abricockes do yield any moisture from them. Their virtue and operation are
like to Peaches.

Conserve of Elderne berries.. 16.
FIrst for to write of the Conserve of Elderne berries, the same is holden by
the ancient Physicians, and also amongst the common people, almost in stead
of Treacle, and that not without cause, as you shall hear hereafter: and is
thus prepared: Take ripe Elderne berries, strip them with a caul from the
stalks, wring out the juice and let it sees by a mild fire unto a pap. This
Conserve is to be taken against all inward venime, it cures all ulcers and
swellings, it expels by sweat all bad humors and corruptions: wherefore it
is to be taken before that one do go to the bathe: but this cannot be done but
only after purging, and that fasting. If this be so used, then does it consume
the Dropsy at the beginning. It has also been found, if that this Conserve be
spread upon the Rose, that thereby it will immediately wear away.

If thou will make Conserve of the flowers, then take the flowers when they be
very ripe, shake them from the stalks, and let them dry between two clothes:
afterward shread them small, unto a pound of flowers, take two pound and a
half of Sugar, powne them well together: afterward set them in the sun, and
stir them oftentimes about. This Conserve opens the Liver, drives away all
swelling of the belly, and all beginning of Dropsies, etc.

How Ginger is to be preserved.. 17.
TAke fair white Ginger, of the fairest races, and lay the same to steep the
space of certain days, or so long until that the uppermost peeles will be
pared off, the^ take them off, and make them very clean, afterward power
fresh ley upon them, and let them steep, to the end that they may swell
thoroughly: and when as they be waxen very mellow (which may be perceived by
cutting them thorough) then power of the Ley, and wash them well with sweet
fresh water prick them oftentimes with a small knife overthwart, and afterward
lay them a day and a night in sweet water, to the end that the sharpness of
the ley may be taken away, and do this so long until you can perceive no
sharpness of the ley any longer: then spread the Ginger upon a four cornered
linen cloth, that the linen may draw the moisture out of it; but if so be
that the cloth be thorough wet, then lay it on another dry cloth again. Some
do spare this labor, and lay it upon sieues, when it is then very dry, then
have a sirupe ready, which is made of Sugar, or clarified Honey, and then do
therewith like as is taught of the Elecampane roots, but above all have good
regard that the sirupe be not powered too hot upon it, for that thereby the
Ginger will shrink, yea be hard and unpleasant: then keep this Ginger in a
gally pot. This confected Ginger is very good for all cold phlegmatic
sicknesses, and for a cold weak stomach: it takes away all vapors that do
ascend from the stomach toward the head; it warmeth all the body, and all
inward parts. At evening when one goes to bed a good piece taken of it does
dry marvelous much the brains: Thereby will also the parts of generation in
men and women be strengthened. But this may be gotten preserved green out of
ye Indies, which is much better, than that which is preserved in this cuntry.
The same was wont before times to be preserved after an easier manner, to wit,
in this manner following: Take white Ginger as much as you please, bury it the
space of 14. days in moist sand, and wash it afterward with a sharp ley, lay
it afterward again the space of fourteen days in Rosewater: this being
done, make a sirupe of Sugar, or of Honey, or both of them tempered together,
cleansed and scummed well, and then lay the Ginger in this sirupe: But I cannot
commend this manner of doing.

How Raspes are to be preserved.. 18.
YOu must take the Raspes as they hang upon the hedge, wash the same very
clean, and make them fair, if there be any uncleanness with them, and then
make ready a clarified sirupe of Sugar, and when as now the sirupe is almost
boiled, then cast in the berries, and let them sees softly therein a good
while that they may not break, and do not also cool. Their Conserve is made
as follows: when the berries be very ripe, then strip them from the stalks,
and wring the juice thorough a clean cloth; afterward let it sees softly,
stirring it always about until it begin to be thick, then put as much Sugar
unto it as you please, and sees it away like as all other Conserues. You may
also boil this juice without Sugar, and it is also better for Physic. The
Apothecaries do call the same Rob de Ribes. This Conserve has an especial
virtue to slake thirst, and to moisten the dry tongue, and all other inward
parts, it makes appetite, and that especially in hot times. In like manner may
also this decocted juice be tempered with wine, and used as a sauce amongst
other meats.

How the Conserve of Hyssope is to be made.. 19.
IN July, take the flowers of this herb, and sugar also with it, powne them
well together, like as we have taught of Eyebright. This Conserve is very good
for the breast, the lights, and such like parts: it is also good against the
cough, the narrownes of the breast, and against the short breath; it consumes
and dries all cold rheumes: it exceedingly warmeth the breast, it
strengthens the stomach, the head, and the brains: it takes away all
ascending vapors; and is good against all poison, and also very meet against
all coldness of the inward parts.

Of the Conserues of Lauander and of Spikenard.. 20.
BOth these herbs are found to agree so near in operation that the Spica is
called the male, because it has bigger leaves and ears, and the Lauander the
female. Of both these herbs are the flowers only taken, and for every pound
of flowers two and a half of sugar, or otherwhiles three pound of sugar,
because they be strong: beat them well together. This Conserve is very good
for all cold diseases of the stomach, and for all windines of the same, it
eases the pain in the belly, and the ascension of the Mother, it opens all
obstructions of the Liver, it moves urine, it dries the cold and moist
brains, it is good for the sinews, Palsy, and lamenes that proceeds of
them, it restores the lost speech, it takes away all cold rheumes that fall
out of the head into the eyes, teeth, and other parts, and this conserve is
especial good against the corruption of the gummes.

How to preserve the Eryngus root.. 21.
THis herb is called of the Physicians Eryngium, the roots only of this herb
be preserved. The same are dug up in the spring time or in harvest, wash and
scrape the same well; afterward cleave them in the length and take out the
heart, then cut them in mean pieces, seethe them and prepare them as you did
Calmus and the greater Pimpernell roots: or you may leave them long, put only
the pith of them out and stick it about with Cinnamom and Cloves, which gives
it a pleasantness. These roots be also very good for them that have any
disease in the Liver, they do take away all pain of the Milt, the kidneys, and
back, they drive away the chollicke, they move urine and women's terms; they
be also good against all venime, and against all pursiuenesse in the breast,
they free one from the crampe, and of the falling sickness, they do warm the
parts of generation, and be especial good for a cold stomach.

Conserve of Marioram.. 22.
OF this herb are the leaves only to be taken, and powne them with Sugar like
the Eyebright: this Conserve is of a dry and of a warm nature it is especial
good for all moist and cold diseases of the brains, of the head, and of the
stomach, it opens all obstructions of the liver, and all inward part, it
does strengthen the heart, and it has the same virtue with the conserve of
Lauander and of Spikenard.

Conserve of Balm.. 23.
A Conserve of this herb is especial good for all biting of Scorpions, of
Spiders, and of Waspes, and is also good for all biting of mad dogs, the same
being eaten or laid upon it: it moves women's terms, it asswageth all tooth
ach and pain of the joints, it freeth one from the poison of the Toadstooles,
it stays the scouring Dysenteria, and takes away all collickes, it drives
away all pensiveness, it strengthens a cold stomach, it warmeth the breast,
and gives a light breath, it cleanses all ulcers, and is good against all
dark sight: of the white flowers of this herb is also a Conserve made like as
of all other flowers, which nevertheless is not much in use.

How Nutmegs are to be confected.. 24.
OF Nutmegs take the very best, lay them to steep in sharp ley which is made
of woodashes, and let them lie so long therein, until they be thoroughly
steeped, yea mellow and soft: afterward power away the ley and peele off the
uppermost gray skins. This being done, power fresh water oftentimes upon it,
to the end that the sharpness of the ley may be drawn away again: then let
them dry in the shadow in a Sieue: prepare afterward a sirupe of Sugar which
is well decocted, and so power it luke warm upon them; and if it wax
waterish, then sees the same again, and that once every three or four days
until that the sirupe continue thick. These Nutmegges be of a dry and warm
nature, they strengthen the head, the brains, the heart, and all vital
spirits, they increase natural heat, and all natural powers, if so be that
one take the same in the morning fasting, and in the evening after meat. They
do consume all noisome and superfluous humors of the inward parts, they do
strengthen the stomach and make fresh blood, they yield a good and odoriferous
breath, they ease all swellings and hardness of the spleen, and they be
especial good against all cold diseases of the Liver: but they be not so good
for the Lights: they have great power for to dry a moist head. Now adays be
they brought out of Indy preserved green, which be much better and forcible,
than they which be preserved in this country.

Conserues of Gilloflowers.. 25.
Diverse kinds there be of these well known flowers, the red well savoring be
ye best to make a Conserve of, cut the undermost white from it and use the
leaves alone, and the white are you to cast away; the same is to be pouned with
Sugar like to other Conserues. This Conserve has the same virtue that the
conserve of Betony has, for they are also a kind of Betonie. These
Gilloflowers are especially commended against all venime: this Conserve is also
very good for the head and the brains, drying and warming the same, it
allayeth also the shaking and shiuering of the quartaine Ague: it is also
somewhat bitter, and is therefore good against all worms taken fasting, it is
good against the pain of the teeth, it withstandeth drunkenness, and breaks
the stone. This may also be used as a preservative in time of the plague.

How Walnuts are preserved.. 26.
ABout Saint John's tide take green Walnuts and prick them through with a
bodkin, and peele off the green bitter shales from them; afterward lay them
8. or ten days in fresh water or in running water which is more better, and
they need not so much time also for it. When as now they be quite rid of their
bitterness, then let them sees softly, until they be somewhat mellow, but not
thorough soft: and afterward let them dry in a sieue, and then stick their
holes with Cinnamom, Cloves, and Orange peeles: also sees the Sugar somewhat
short, as we have taught in the preserving of the Elecampane roots. Some do
prick it without, but they put Cloves, Cinnamom, Galingall, Mace, Cucubes, and
Cardamom in the sirupe, each according to his good liking: but if so be that
you will preserve them with Honey, then it is not needful that one peele them.
These Nuts be commonly used at banquets, notwithstanding that they be also good
for Physic: they that be preserved with spices, do help digestion and do
warm all inward parts: they close up the stomach after meat, and do stay the
ascension of the vapors, yet they are very seldom used in this Book. Here we
will also admonish and teach how that one shall keep ripe Walnuts a long time
fresh, that the kernels may be peeled: for this are you to take good new nuts,
bury them in sand, and when you will use them, then wash away the sand. Or take
a new pot, and strew therein a lay of dried Vineleaues, and then a lay of Nuts,
and so forth, until the pot be full, wherein they will last long and keep
their taste.

Conserve of Buglosse.. 27.
WE have before admonished in the description of the Conserve of Burrage, that
both of these be of one nature and of one operation, wherefore it is not
needful to discourse thereof more at large.

How Apples are preserved.. 28.
APples may be preserved as we have written of Pears, some do power upon them
winelees, and they wash them when they will use them: Apples do cool the hot
stomach, they do attenuate the tough slime and quench thirst.

Conserve of Pionie.. 29.
TAke the leaves of Pionie flowers (which do blow in May) and powne them very
small, unto a pound of Flowers take 2. pound and a half of Sugar, and set it
the space of three months in the Sun stirring it about every day. This
Conserve is very good against all fantasies, against the hag or nightmare (as
some term it) against the falling sickness, and swimming of the head,
against the diminishing of the sight, and all diseases of the brains: it
moves women's terms, and cleanses them after childbirth: it is also good for
the gravel, and for the yellow Iaundise, it suppresseth the vapors of the
stomach, it refreshes women that be vexed with the suffocation of the Matrix,
it is also marvelous good against the pangs of children, and it lets the
growing of the stone in them: if so be that the children be too small that one
cannot give it them, then are the nurses that give suck to use this Conserve
in abundance.

How to preserve Peaches.. 30.
WHen the fruit is ripe, then is the same to be plucked off with the hand that
it may not be bruised: those Peaches are esteemed to be the best to preserve
which be ripe about Saint John's tide, and be somewhat smaller than the other:
the uppermost skin is at the first to be peeled off with a knife, and the
sirupe (like as is said of the Musk pears) to be sod until it be thick. They
have almost the same nature that the Musk pears have, they comfort and
strengthen the sick persons, they be good for the thirst, they moisten the
dried tongue, they do cool all inward parts, and be very good in all hot
sicknesses. In this manner be the red and the wine Peaches preserved: peele the
same and take out the stones; afterward lay them in an earthen pot, and power
upon them clarified and thick Honey. These Peaches be not so pleasant as the
other, but they be well as forcible as the small, and they may also be prepared
with Sugar. And because that some people may not abide the taste of Honey, it
may be washed off before they be used with water; it is also in the third part
(where we speak of the bloody Flixe) declared how these Peaches are to be
dried and used. Item, the hurt which these Peaches do through their cold and
moisture, that will be remedied through eating of their kernels, or with a
draught of wine.

The flowers or blossoms of Peaches may also be preserved with Sugar as other
flowers: this conserve is very necessary for children against the worms,
because that children can hardly use Wormseede by reason of the bitterness:
and this conserve does not only expel worms, but lets that none other can
come to engender. And if one have suspicion of Worms, then it is advised that
it be given, for that it strengthens much the stomach.

For to make Conserve of Prunes.. 31.
TAke of the great Damask prunes or other great horse Prunes which be somewhat
sowrish, as many as you please, cut them open and pluck out the stones: then
let them sees in a pot, afterward strain them through a strainer, and then
let it sees again unto a pap, this cools all heat and quenches the thirst
in Agues. If you will have a laxatiue Conserve, then take sweet Prunes. There
is also made at the Apothecaries a laxatiue conserve called Diaprunum
solutiuum, which you are to seek in the Table. Some do take for the first
described Prunes conserve of the one half of Sugar, whereby it is also
pleasant, but it is in hot sicknesses much more commodious to be used without
Sugar.

But if you will only preserve Prunes, then take the foresaid Prunes of
Damask, and then power as much clarified honey upon it which is not too hot,
stirring it always well about. If it be seen that the Honey be waterish, then
must it be decocted again, like as it is oftentimes admonished before.

How Quinces and other things are to be preserved.. 32.
OF these noble and odoriferous Quinces have many ancient and also later
Physicians written much, and used after sundry manners, whereby it is now come
to pass, that there is scant any household of account where one finds not
always something prepared of Quinces, wherefore we will discourse somewhat
ampler thereof, and first of all describe diverse confections.

The Apothecaries do call the one Diacydonium simplex, for that there is none
other but Sugar or Honey in it, and is thus made: Take Quinces as many as you
please, whereof the kernels be put out, and cut them very small, afterward
sees them in Well water to the end they may be soft, then strain them through
a Strayner or Sieue, so that there remain nothing but the parings in the
Sieue. Then take three pound thereof, Sugar or Honey that is well clarified
about four pound, or as much as you please, then sees them together unto a
conserve or confection, stirring it about continually.

Another: Take cut Quinces which be cleansed from the seed, put them into a
pot, and cover it on the top with a pewter potlid, turn it afterward about
into another pot which is full of water, and let the same sees, that the vapor
may ascend, and the Quinces, through the vapor of the neathermost pot, may be
mellow, that they may be afterward driven thorough a Sieue: take four pound
thereof, Sugar three pound, and let it sees so together to a conserve. Some do
take but half so much Sugar as Quinces, but therein may each one do his
pleasure, how less Sugar that there is with it, so much the better be they for
Physic. Other do boil or foment the Quinces with good old wine, which is
also not to be rejected. This following is more forcible: Take as many Quinces
as you will, grate them very small, and press out the juice, afterward power
it upon other sliced or cut Quinces, and then let them altogether seethe
thoroughly with Sugar or Honey. This is an especial medicine for to strengthen
the stomach, it stops all scowring and wambling, it strengthens the
inward weak parts, besides the digestive and retentiue virtues, and it
provoke appetite. But note this well, if one will stop the scowring, that one
must take it before meat, and against the vomiting after meat.

At the Apothecaries is prepared a Diacydonium compositum, or cum Speciebus, as
hereafter follows: Take thick sodden juice of Quinces, wherein is neither
Sugar nor Honey, eighteen ounces, clarified Honey one pound and a half, sees
it meetely thick. When it is now waxen luke warm, then temper these spices
following (powned small) amongst it: to wit, Cinnamom three quarters of an
ounce, Ginger half an ounce, Pepper and Galingall, of each one quarter of an
ounce, Cloves and Nutmegs, of each one dragme and a half, Indy Spica, Lignum
Aloes, Mace, and Cardamome, of each one dragme, Zeduarie half a dragme:
afterward power it into boxes, and make a hole or twain above on the top. It
is also well advised that one take Sugar in stead of honey.

If you will have a purging conserve of Quinces of Marmalade, then take of this
foresaid conserve (whilst that it is yet warm) with the spices 22. ounces, and
temper half an ounce of powned Diagridion amongst it, and stir it very long,
to the end it be well tempered. This foresaid conserve of Quinces with the
spices is more forcible for all the foresaid diseases, then the other, it
causes the winds to avoid, it expels all bad smells, it makes a good
color, and it strengthens the natural powers. For the kitchen and for
housekeeping may this ensuing be prepared: pare as many Quinces as you please,
grate them even to the coare, and put all that is grated into a strong cloth,
afterward wring the juice well out, and keep it in a pot. This being done,
take other Quinces, pare them and cut them in four pieces, put out the seed,
and sees the same in water until it be almost as mellow as pap, and all the
water be consumed, but put out the seeds clean, and put it in a pot apart,
and power water upon it, then let it sees well, and strain it through a
cloth. Tie also a course cloth over an earthen pan, and lay thereon a good
deal of mellow Quinces, and rub them through it, so that the best may go
thorough, then take afterward fair white Sugar, and power thereon some of the
decoction of Quinces, let it sees meetly hard, (then needs not the conserve
of Quinces to sees so much) then take of this decoction of Quinces one part,
and two parts of the other, and let it sees until it be half thick enough,
afterward put the Sugar unto it, and then let it sees thick enough, stirring
it continually: when as it begins to be cold, then put into the boxes. And
if this Marmalade be not fair enough, then take off the uppermost skin with a
knife. It is also to be noted, that if it be not decocted dry enough, then can
it not last above a year.

Now for to make a clear and perspicuous Marmalade: Take fair great Quinces,
wash them very clean, grate them very small, wring out as much juice as you
please: take afterward other Quinces, cut them in six pieces, put them into
a pot, let them be vapoured with hot water, like as we have taught before,
until that they be thorough mellow, then take half a pot full of the former
juice, and power it upon the former stewed and cut pieces, break it well
together, and then put the rest of the juice amongst it, wring it thorough a
thin cloth, until it be clear: Of this juice shall you not sees more at
once, than for to fill a box therewith, and put white Sugar unto it (beaten
very small) as much as you please. If the juice be troubled, then let it pass
once or twice thorough a cloth, or so long until it be thorough clear:
afterward sees it speedily away over a slight fire: when it is boiled enough,
then power it into the box, or wherein else you will, which might be made wet
before: and when they have stood one night, then may they be taken out. Note
also here, that you must not take too little of the pap of the vapoured
Quinces; for that the Marmalade should be very tough, and if one let the same
sees long, then would it be very brown.

If you will make course Marmalade, then take the Quinces that remain, whereof
the best is strained out, and rub it thorough a hairen sieue, and afterward
put more vapoured Quinces unto it, and let it sees away with Honey or Sugar.
This serves to dress withal, or otherwise.

A Marmalade not sodden: Take twenty or twenty five Quinces, pare them, and
cut the half thereof in small pieces, the rest grate small, and press the
juice well out: power that unto the cut pieces, and stew them until all be
soft: afterward wring them thorough a cloth, and stir as much powned Sugar
amongst it, as you please, and then put them in a box, and so let it dry upon
an oven.

Item, take ripe Quinces which be not stony, pare them, and take out rdund
pieces so deep, till you come to the stones. You are to grate these Quinces,
and to wring out the juice, to the end that you may have a good deal of it,
then power this juice upon the pieces that you cut out, and then let it sees
until it be thorough mellow: then put clear decocted Sugar unto it, as much
as you please, and then dry them with a soft fire, then put them in the boxes,
and let them dry well.

Another: Take four ounces of fresh Quince kernels, let them steep a day and
a night in Well water, or in the juice of Quinces, in a warm place, afterward
wring out the slime thorough a clean cloth, and then put thereto four pound
of the juice of Quinces in a leaded pot, and let it seethe all together by a
soft fire: yet it is to be strained then thorough a cloth again, and
afterward also take two pounds of Sugar, and seethe it until it be thickt
enough.

Yet another course Marmalade: Take of the pith whence the best juice is wroong
out, and put warm water unto it, and sees it well; then rub thereof thorough
as much as you can, and put clear Honey unto it as much as you please, and then
put some Pepper unto it, and sees it very thick. If you will now know when
these Marmalades be decocted enough, then let some fall upon a cold Iron, and
be cold, if it be enough, then will it easily part from the iron, and remains
not hanging on the fingers, but it goes clean and dry off.

All these sorts of Marmalades, or Conserues of Quinces are very good for the
stomach, and help the digestive power. The same may moreover be tempered in
Malmsey, in Claret wine, and Hypocras, and may also be used in stead of a sauce
with meat.

It is also here to be noted, that all Marmalades, which are prepared with
Wine, spices, and such like, are good only for old folks, and for cold women,
and for all them which be cold by nature. Contrariwise, they that be prepared
with water and juice of Quinces, be meetely hot, because the fruit is cold in
the first, and dry in the second degree: wherefore they be meet for all
people which be hot by nature, and for all them whose gall ouerfloweth much in
the stomach.

Snow-white Marmalade is also to be made in this manner: Take pared Quinces,
cut them, in four or five pieces, and cut them out within: afterward put honey
unto them, and let them slew in a pot, until that they be mellow: then take
them out, and let them be cold, and stick them about with cut Cinnamom and
Cloves, put Honey unto it again, and then set it so in a sellar, that it may
remain moist, and lay some heavy thing upon it, that they swim not. Item,
take Quinces as many as you please, prepare them as before, power wine unto it,
but let them not be stewed too mellow, especially if one will keep them a
certain time: let them afterward dry upon a cloth: if you will stick them
about as before, that is wholly in your power: if not, bind in a cloth
Cinnamom, Cloves, Mace, and lay it in the decoction: afterward take one part
of wine, and two parts of Honey, and let it sees so long until that all the
wine be wasted, then afterward power Honey upon it, but not too hot, to the
end that thereby they be not too hard.

Before times, these were wont to be made in this manner following: Take a
rough cloth, and rub off therewith the uttermost parings of the Quinces, or
pare them very thin, and then cut them in four pieces, and take out the coare
within, afterward power upon them two parts of wine, and one part of Honey
which is clarified, then sees them so long until the skin do wrinkle, then be
they enough: put them out, and let them be cold, lay them in a pot, and strew
some spice upon each row; afterward power the decoction (sodden short) luke
warm upon it. Item, take Quinces, take out the coares, and lay them in a pot
close one to another, and let them stand stewing in an oven, until that they
be mellow, so that they may easily be pricked thorough with bodkins; afterward
let them be cold, and then put them again into another pot, and power
clarified Honey upon it, lay some heavy thing upon it, that they swim not
about, then will they remain good a whole year, and have the same virtue of
the common Marmalade. You have also before in the description of Pears, how
that they shall be made close in a pot, and should then be laid in a fat of
Wine, you may also put the same in practice with the Quinces.

Lay the Quinces all the winter in small chopped straw, and cover them well, but
lay none other fruit with it, and keep them from the air. Other do take
Flocks, some Bran, or Hay. But the very surest is if one will keep them the
whole year, that they be covered in their own leaves, and afterward cover
them with Lome, let them dry, and set them somewhere in a cold dry place.
There may also be made many kinds of things of Quinces, viz. the sirupe Miua,
and oil, and also the seeds thereof be used and the peeles.

Conserve of Roses.. 33.
Conserve of Roses which is ready at al Apothecaries, and common in all houses
is thus prepared: Take red Rose buds, which be plucked in dry weather, as many
as you please. clip them off under the white with a pair of sheares, then lay
them on a clean cloth, and one double cloth over them, that they may be well
covered, let them lie so still upon a table two or three days, that they may
wither a little, and afterward stamp them in a mortar to grout: and to one
part of the powned Roses, take two parts of Sugar, and stamp them well
together; afterward put this Conserve in a glass, and stop it close the space
of three months in the sun; yet stir them about once every day, with a
wooden spatine: if so be that you think that they will be too hard, then set
them afterward in a sellar, that they relent somewhat. It is here also to be
noted, that if so be you cannot get the right red Roses, then take the
Carnation colored, yea also the wild Roses, of the which I have found my
self, that the Conserve it self is of very good taste, and moreover very
forcible in working. This Conserve of Roses has an especial virtue to
strengthen a weak stomach, and to allay all choleric humors; it
strengthens the brains, it quickens and strengthens the heart, it
cools the heat, and all inflammation of the inward parts. This Conserve of
Roses may well be tempered with Rosewater or Well water, and be wrung thorough
a cloth, and so in all hot agues to comfort the sick persons with it: it
moisteneth also the dry tongue, the throat, the breast, and the lights, and
especially that which is new made: that which is oldish has another nature of
binding in all scourings and fluxes, it swageth the pain and sharpness of the
same, etc.

The purging Conserve of Roses is made thus: Take twelve ounces of Sugar of
Roses, and temper amongst it at the least half an ounce of small pouned
Diagridion. This conserve of Roses is also very good in sundry sicknesses, and
especially in lingering diseases. There is half an ounce thereof given, or at
the most three quarters of an ounce at once, when as the Diagridion has been
tempered amongst it at the least two months before.

The white Conserve of Roses is made like to the red. Some do make all
Conserues of Roses with Honey in stead of Sugar, but this Conserve is hotter,
and is seldom used.

There is also Conserues made of Damask Roses, after the foresaid manner,
which is very pleasant, and loses mildly.

Conserve of Rosemary.. 34.
THis Conserve is very pleasant, not only for Physic, but the flowers and
the herb is also used in the Kitchen, with wine and otherwise. But as much as
concerns the Conserve, the Apothecaries do call it Conserua Anthos, and is
made thus: Take flowers of Rosemary which are to be gathered in the spring, and
in harvest, powne them to pap, and to one part of these flowers, take three
parts of Sugar, and powne it very well togther, then set it in the Sun,
stirring it oftentimes about. This Conserve is warm by nature, it attenuateth
also all tough, gross, and phlegmatic matter of the inward parts, it dries
and strengthens the brains, it refreshes the heart, and makes it merry;
it strengthens the mortified natural heat, it expels the yellow
Iaundise, and withstandeth the Dropsy, it warmeth and cleanses the breast, it
makes a good breath, it drives out phlegm, and strengthens digestion, it
withstandeth all venime that might hurt the heart, it takes away the Chollicke
or griping of the belly, it causes one to sweat well, whereby it expels
all bad humors out of the body, it cleanses the blood, hunteth away all
heaviness and pensiveness, and strengthens all weakness.

To preserve the roots of all red Beetes.. 35.
YOu are to stew these roots with a little water, when they be mellow, then
put thereto little pieces of Horsradish, and put them in a pot, and strew it
with Caraway: afterward power half wine and half vinegar upon it, until
that they be well covered, and then lay some heavy thing upon them, that they
may not swim: in the same manner may you also prepare all the roots that serve
for Sallads: the roots which are too great are to be cut overthwart. These and
such like roots are not to be used for physic, but for meat.

Conserve of Sage.. 36.
Conserve of Sage is also made of the flowers, like unto all other; it does
strengthen the stomach, it opens all obstructions, it consumes all bad
humors of the stomach, it strengthens all members, and is very good for all
diseases of the head, which proceed of cold, it is good against all Palsies
and lamenesse, it is also meet for all diseases of the sinews.

How Sloes are to be preserved.. 37.
TAke very ripe Sloes, with their stalks, and put thereto two parts of Honey,
and one part of wine, and let them sees so long until the wine be thoroughly
sodden away; afterward lay the Sloes in a pot, with the stalks on high, and
power the same Honey upon it, and cover it with a trencher, and lay some heavy
thing on them, to the end that they may be covered with the liquor; and then
set them in a sellar. Another way to preserve Sloes: take unripe Medlars, ripe
Sloes, ripe and pared Quinces, when the coares be cut out, of each as much as
you please: if you will you may stick them about with spice: likewise also the
Medlars; which you shall sees with the Quinces in Honey, like as is first of
all said of Sloes, and lay some heavy thing on the top of it.

Conserues of Cowslips.. 38.
THere be two kinds of these flowers, whereof the one is wild, and without
smell, which is meet for nothing: but take of the yellow that smells well, and
cut thereof behind the long pipe, and with Sugar make a Conserve thereof. This
Conserve is of a warm and dry nature, it is very good for the head, it
strengthens and warmeth the brains it is also good for the Palsy, for which
cause it is also called Herba paralysis. This conserve is also of all them
(which be inclined to the Palsy) much used, and it strengthens also the
heart: but it is perchance not much used, for that it is a kind of Betony or of
Gillowflowers, which be more acceptable.

Conserve of water Lillies.. 39.
LIkewise there be two sorts of these flowers, to wit, yellow and white, take
thereof the white, and the white leaves only of the flowers, make a conserve
thereof ^ike unto all other conserues. This conserve strengthens much, and
cools in very hot agues, and also in pestilentiall agues, It is also very
good for them that consume away, and that have the Pleurisy. It takes away
all dry coughes, for that it cools and moisteneth the breast, the throat,
and the dry tongue: it quenches thirst, it cools through her cold the Liver,
the Milt, and all inward parts, and it provoke sleep. All hail people and
they that be cold of nature may not use the same, for that if the same be used
too much, then takes it away the fleshly desire, and it obstructeth also the
spermaticall flux if it be heat.

Conserve of Violets.. 40.
TAke blew odoriferous Violet flowers, pluck the flowers from their hu^, and
powne them to a pap. Unto a pound of flowers put two pound of Sugar, and then
stamp them well together, and so set them in the Sun. This Conserve is cold
in the first, and moist in the second degree. It cools and moisteneth with
mildness, and it asswageth also the pain of the guts, but it is not so good
for the stomach. It allayeth also the choleric heat which comes through
moisture. It loses and also takes away thirst. It may well be given to young
children (in all heat) very freely, for that it is good against their pangs,
it keeps the belly open, it strengthens the brains and the heart, and it
takes away all stitches. The yellow Violets are also preserved otherwhiles.

Conserve of the flowers of Cicorie.. 41.
TAke the leaves of Cicorie flowers, and make a conserve thereof, like as is
taught of all other. This conserve is especial good for the Liver, it opens
the obstruction of the same, it cleanses all inward parts, and also the
intrailes of all choleric humors, it expels them out thorough the stool,
and withstandeth thereby all putrefying agues, therefore this conserve is also
to be used in the beginning of the Dropsy, it reuiueth the weak and
ouer-heated heart, and also the stomach. In fine, it is very good in all hot
sicknesses. The roots of Cicory are also preserved, which are dug up before
that they begin to sprout out. Being dug up make them clean, and cut them
the long way, and then take the innermost heart of it. Afterward cut it in
pieces the length of a finger, and then let them boil well in fresh water,
that the bitterness may come out, and the roots may be mellow. When as they be
meetly dry, then power thick boiled Sugar upon it, and if the roots be still
somewhat hard, then let them boil in the Sugar until they be mellow, and let
them be cold. But if that the sirupe be thin through the moisture of the
roots, then sees the same thick again, and that so often until it remain
stiff. These roots be of a cold and dry nature, and they have the same
virtues with ye conserve.

How red Cherries are preserved.. 42.
REd Cherries be preserved like as we have taught before of the black. They
have also one kind of operation, and are thus preserved: Take picked red
Cherries which be not bruised, put them in a small Oaken vessel, afterward
take clarified Honey, and let it sees with a little wine, until all the
moisture be consumed, and power then this Honey warm upon it, otherwise would
they break through heat. This being now done, then stop the vessel tight,
and lay it in a Sellar, and roll it daily from one place to another, and do
this the space of fourteen days, or three weeks.

There is also made of these Cherries a conserve, as hereafter follows.

Take Cherries as many as you please, stamp them a little, and then power yet
more other Cherries unto it, and boil it without any other moisture: all that
which will remain thick, is to be rubbed thorough a sieue, to the end that
there do not remain any other thing in the sieue, than skins and stones;
then sees it in an earthen pot. You may also put Sugar unto it, as much as you
please, and then sees it unto a conserve. For this, is no kind of Spice meet,
if so be that one desire not to put a little Cinnamom unto it.

This conserve is very good against all drith of the mouth, throat, and tongue,
if sick persons be washed with it. It quenches thirst in all hot Agues, and
otherwise. It is also good for all Cholera of the stomach, it makes appetite
to meat, and it cools the hot reins: the kernels do expel gravel. In
Summer time is wine to be mingled with this conserve, and to be used for sauce
with roast meat.

If one desire to keep Cherries long fresh, then are picked Cherries to be
taken for it, and to dip the same in molten Wax, viz. when it begins to be
cold, and to let them be well closed in Wax, and afterward to sement the same
with Lome until it be thoroughly closed, then are they to be hanged up in a
cool place, and they will remain fresh a very long time.

How ripe and unripe Grapes are to be preserved.. 43.
THe unripe Grapes shall be confected like to all Barberries, but you must cut
every berrie from the Cluster, to the end that they may keep their stalks,
and put therewith like as is said of the black Cherries: then let them not
sees long, that they do not break and get a bad taste. They have the same
power as the Barberries. The ripe Grapes are to be confected, like as we have
written of Pears.

Of that which commonly keeps all fruits fresh.. 44.
ALL that is laid in Honey, whether it be Flesh, Fruit, and Plants, or any
other thing, does remain a long time before it spoil, therefore have dead
carcasses before time been powered full of Honey. If you have then any Fruit,
Fowls, Venison, or any other such like things that you will keep good the
space of a year; or any Plants, or Flowers, and such like throughout the
winter, then look into M. Tristrams water, whereof all ancient Physicians
have had a good opinion. The same also do all vital and golden waters, which
follow immediately hereafter.

The sixth Chapter. Of the golden and vital waters, and Elixers of life.
THese kinds of potions and artificial waters, are ordained most to this end,
for that they should strengthen the most principal parts of the body, as the
head and the heart, to keep it from debilitie and swouning, especially if the
same proceed of cold. Thus we will describe some of them, whereof there be two,
which the ancient Physicians call golden waters for their especial virtues.
Take fine Sage seven ounces, Nutmegs, Cloves, Ginger, and Greins, of each half
an ounce, Cinnamom, peeled Bayberries, and Beuercod, of each one ounce,
Spikenard one dragme, peeles of Citrons one quarter of an ounce, temper them
all together grossly beaten, then power two quarts of wine upon it, and so let
al together stand the space of fourteen days stopped close, stirring it well
about every day. Afterward distill it in water in an Helm luted well and
tight. This water does keep all manner of meats by their natural taste and
virtue, it expels all bad humors of the body, it makes all wine clean and
of a good taste, if one temper a little amongst it, anointed outwardly upon
one, or used. It is very good for all inward parts, as the Stomach, the
Spleen, the Liver, and the Lights. It is also good for all bruses, and to
anoint the bruses with it. In like manner it is good for all falls, for all
byles, and all pains of the head. It is good (namely at the first) against all
Dropsies, against the Palsy, and also against all venime. If one have any
thing in the stomach that he cannot digest, then will it be consumed thereby,
it makes a good memory, and withstandeth the Leprosy, it heals all
scabbines, and also all ulcers, if one drink it, or lay it upon them.

Another. Take Lauander flowers, Hyssope and Sage, of each four ounces, cut
them very small, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cinnamom, and Cloves, of each half an ounce,
Greines two drag. beat all small, afterward power upon it three quarts of the
best wine, and set it the space of fourteen days in the Sun stopped very
close. Thus may you use the first. Item, take good Malmsey two quarts, and
steep these things ensuing in it, being stopped very close, and then set it in a
dunghill which lies in the East the space of thirty days, afterward distill
it, as is before said. Take fine Sage with the flowers, of each half an ounce,
Burrage flowers one ounce, one Orange, Rue three dragmes, Rosemarie three
ounces and a half, Rosemarie flowers half an ounce, the tops of Marioram
gentle four ounces, the flowers of Buglosse three quarters of an ounce, red
Roses two ounces and one quarter, Hyssope half an ounce, Carduus Benedictus
half an ounce, Ireos three dragmes, Camfere three quarters of an ounce,
prepared Perls half a dragme, oil of Spike and liquide Storax, of each half
a dragme, powned Cinnamom four ounces, Galingall three dragmes, long Pepper
and Greines, of each half an ounce, Cucubes, and Cardamome, of each one ounce
and a quarter, Zeduarie three dragmes, Ginger one ounce, beat this all
together gross. Here is to be noted, that there will be too little wine, and
that freely there may three or four quarts of wine be taken for it. Now
follows here a water, called the elixer of life, and is thus made.

Take Cinnamom and Cloves, of each one ounce and a half, Nutmegs one ounce,
red Roses ten handfuls, white Roses as many, Hyssope two handfuls, Lauander
flowers seven handfuls, power unto it a quart of Malmsey, and so let it stand
the space of nine days, and distill it afterward, as is said before. Now for
to distill a common vital water is thus to be done. Take Cinnamom one ounce
and a half, Ginger one ounce, Cloves, Nutmegs, and Greines, of each half an
ounce, Lignum Aloes, Mastick, Mace, and long Pepper, of each two dragmes, Sage
sixteen ounces, Cardamome, Cucubes, and Galingall, of each two dragms and a
half, Roses one quarter of an ounce, Balm three dragmes, Citron peels three
quarters of an ounce, Rue, Bayberries, and Stechas, of each half an ounce,
Rosemarie, Marioram, Lauander, and Betony, of each three quarters of an ounce,
Spica, and Beuercod, of each one dragme, steep it in three quarts of Malmsey,
and so let it stand the space of ten days, then distill it like as is taught
of the other. Some have also an especial water, which is called Aqua
spiritualis, for that it strengthens much the vital spirits: Take the herb

Apothecaries; and besides that we will interpret and english their names the

gall out of the stomach: this confection is not common at all Apothecaries.

Catholicon.. 10.
THis Greek name is as much to say, as universal, and the ancient Physicians
have given that name unto this Confection, for that it is meet for all
diseases: therefore it is also kept prepared at all Apothecaries. And because
that the same can be made by no householder, therefore we will not set down her
description. It is not only good for all strong diseases, but also for all the
extremest sicknesses, it allayeth and alters the same, it strengthens al

than to purge, then take washed Aloes, in stead of other. This Confection is
very good against all rotting and stinking humors, which do keep themselves in
the mouth of the stomach, and in the bowels. In like manner it is also good
for all them that have lost their natural color, and against all inward
diseases of the sight; it loses very mildly and her operation penetrateth no

is partly hurtful for them that have a hot Liver, but because of her great
virtue, it is much used.

Mithridatium.. 28.
THis high renowned and very well known confection, has next to Treacle the
highest commendation and price above all other confections and compounded
medicines, the which of very many and diverse simples is composed together:
wherefore we will pretermit her description here. It is also older than the
Trea^le and was found out by Mithridates king of Pontus three hundred years
before Christ's birth, and so named after him. This foresaid Confection did the
King use against all venime, and with such commodity, that when he was in
greatest extremity and had taken poison, he could not die of it. Wherefore and
because that the same is oftentimes ordained in this book, therefore we will
briefly rehearse her virtue and vigor. First, it has almost in all things the
same power of the Treacle; but that only the Treacle is somewhat hotter and more
forcible against all venim of snakes: otherwise it is good against all pain of
ye head which proceeds out of cold, and chiefly against all melancholicke
diseases, and also for them that live in great heaviness without cause. It is
also good against all heavy fancies and madness: and further it is also good
against the Falling sickness, against the giddiness, and all old pain of the
head. Likewise it is a very good medicine against all running and diseased
eyes, it sharpeneth the sight, and it is good against all sissing of the ears,
and against all pain and falling of the gums if the same be laid upon it.
Besides that, it is much commended for the squinancie, it cleanses and heals
all ulcers of the throat. It is a special medicine for all them that be taken
with the palsy, and them that have a disease in the lights: as it is also for
all them that cough much, spet blood and complain of pursiuenes. It is also
especial good for all cold and moist stomachs, it makes appetite, it
strengthens the digestive virtue, and makes a good color. It asswageth all
gripings, all scourings, and the bloody flixe it opens the obstruction of
the liver and the milt: and it is a medicine for all inward parts, it drives
also the crampe away, and all conuulsions of the sinews, it expels the
gravel, and the stone of the bladder, it swageth all pain and ulcers of the
same, it expels water, and month women's terms: it is very necessary for all maladies of the Matrix, it is also especially commodious for all them that
be plagued with the gout in the hands and feet; but especially it is given
against all poison: this does it not only taken inwardly, but also laid upon
the outside. In like manner does it apparently work in the tertian and
quartaine Ague, if that the same be taken an hour before or ere the ague
comes, with wine. The common weight that one takes thereof is a dragme: the
which nevertheless according to the ability of the person and of the
sickness, may be augmented or diminished, or also omitted all together.

Electuarium de succo Rosarum.. 38.
THis present Confection named, of the juice of Roses, is one of the chiefest

used in all melancholicke, frantic, pensive, and such like sicknesses, which
proceed of melancholicke blood: and it cures them that complain of the
Spleen.

Theriaca magna.. 43.
THe occasion wherefore that this high commended Confection is not here
described, is, for that it is made of so many things. Also because there is a
contention as yet amongst the learned, then for that certain things (which
must be used in it) be not to be gotten, and especially in this Country, as
the flesh of the Snake Tyrus, whereof this Treacle has the name: but it is
nevertheless needful and well worthy that we here describe her operation and
vigor.

This Treacle and the Mithridate, be amongst all other confections the most
renowned and worthiest. The first, was by Andromacho Neroes Physician found out
first, but afterward by Galen brought into a better order, and in such manner
amended, that it may very well be kept for so precious a Jewel, which is
neither with gold nor silver to be compared: thus for to speak of her virtue.
First, it is good against all poison, whether it be of beasts or otherwise, for
to the same end it is given: and it is laid upon the biting of mad Dogs. In
like manner, it has an especial power against all bad air, against the
Plague, and all pestilentiall Agues. It is also good against all old pains of
the head, against the falling sickness, the giddiness, and all darkness of
the eyes. Item, it is commended for all infirmities of hearing, and for loss

also all weakness and swounings of the heart, it opens all obstructions of
the Liver, and of the Spleen, and mollifieth or suppleth all their hardness,
it opens the breast, and is good against the wheasing, and also against the
short breath. It allayeth the cough, and suppleth all rawnesse of the throat,
it does provoke the tough humors to be coughed up, it withstandeth spetting of
blood, and swelling up of the veins. It expels the yellow Cholera and the
Dropsy, it heals all inward diseases and ulcers, it asswageth all inward
diseases where there is no heat nor ague instant, if the same be taken with
Wine, or otherwise the same must be taken with some other distilled water.
Likewise it is also good for all bad stomachs, it eases the Consumption, it
expels Worms, and all windiness of the guts: also it is good against all
gripings and pain of the guts, it is also very fit for all diseases of the
Rayns, it is very commodious and helping to all them which be vexed with the
gravel or the stone, for that it expels the same, it heals all ulcers of
the bladder, and all conduits of urine, it expels urine and women's terms;
in like manner also dead children out of their mothers bodies. To all
melancholicke, which be full of anguish and pensiveness without cause, and
half distract of their wits, is this given with great advancement. In fine, it
is very good for all lingering sicknesses, as the Leprosy, old Agues, and
chiefly Quartain Agues. Wherefore it is advised to such as are to travel in
the cold, that every morning fasting they should take somewhat thereof, for
that it warmeth the inward parts, and defends them from all cold. It
strengthens also the lame members, and brings them again to their power,
and when the greatest pain of the Gout is past, then is it taken with great
advantage so that it preserves the body from all corruption.

But here is especially to be noted, that this Treacle is not good for young
people, especially in Summer time, or when it is hot weather, if so be that
great need do not require, and then shall not above half a dragme be given at
once, for that it is too strong for such young natures. All they that be of
middle age it is good for, used oftentimes, so that it cannot here be told, how
much thereof may be given at once. The commonest weight is a dragme, and if so
be that need require not the same, then is seldom any more to be given: yet
according to the importance and ability of the person, the sickness, and such
like, is the same to be augmented or diminished with wine, or any other water.

Theriaca Diatessaron.. 44.
THis Confection has her name of the Grecians, for that it is made of four
kinds of things, namely in this manner following: Take Gentian, fresh
Bayberries, Myrrha, and the right Hartwoort, of each two ounces, stamp all
together very small, with one pound and a half of well scummed Honey, then keep
it well where you please. This Treacle may the common people commodiously use
in stead of the great Treacle, for that it withstandeth all pestilentiall
Agues, and all venime, therefore do the people of the country also give it to
sick Cattle, and that with very great advantage. It is also good against all
diseases of the brains, of the sinews, and all sicknesses, which proceed of
cold, as Falling sicknesses, Palsy, lamenesse, and the Crampe, it
strengthens the stomach and her digestive power, it opens the Liver, the
Spleen, and the Kidneys, therefore it is also good for the yellow Iaundise,
the Dropsy, it expels windiness, and all pain of the guts. There may one
dragme or one dragme and a half be taken thereof, to wit, in the morning
fasting, but Cattle must take more of it.

Triphera.. 45.
OF such like Confections are many kinds described of the Physicians, like as
we shall show hereafter. The first is Foenonis, and is the lesser. It is good
for all excessive fluxes, for women's terms, for the bleeding of the pyles, and
against all debilitie of the stomach, it causes all gross and tough humors
to avoid, it amendeth the natural color, it strengthens the bladder, and
stays the scourings.

The other is Triphera magna, that is the greater. The same is used for all
cold pain of the stomach, as soon as one has taken thereof, then sweat
does break out upon one. It is good for all melancholic women which cannot
sleep, and they that have gotten this anguish and vexation through any disease
of the Matrix. Likewise also for those which be burdened with any slimie
matter in the Lights, and for all them that spet blood, whether it be beneath
or above; and if that one leave out the Opium, then should the same be good for
to advance the fruitfulness of women.

The third is, Triphera Persica, which is made of many kinds of things, it is
good against all agues, which proceed out of the stomach, and also against
the yellow Iaundise, which proceeds of great heat, it opens all
obstructions, it amendeth the sight which is infirmed through choleric
vapors, it quenches thirst, and defends one from all hot sicknesses.

The fourth is Triphera Saracenica, which with her heat strengthens the
digestion of the stomach and of the Liver, it consumes all windiness of the
same, it makes a good breath, and is very commodious for the whole body; it
keeps a body healthie, it provoke desire of venerie, and it obstructeth
all the bleeding of the Pyles: whereof is from one dragme to three dragmes to
be taken, and that according to the importance of the person.

Electuarium vitae.. 46.
THis is called a Confection of life, and is described in the first part, the
second Chapter, and first.

Of Ley.. 47.
THe ancient Physicians, as they were very diligent and curious in searching
out the virtues of all things, thereby to withstand all diseases of mankind, so
have they not omitted to search out the nature of Ashes, for to discern (of
whatsoever wood that the same be burnt) which should be the most commodious and
fit, and they have in truth found no small efficacy and power in them, as is
showed here and there in this book.

For to make excellent spice or sugar Cakes.. 48.
ALbeit that these cakes may be used for the strengthening of the stomach, and
of the head in Physic, nevertheless they be more eaten of licorousnesse: but
for their abuse we will not omit their description. First, take wheat and Rye
flower, of each about a pound and a half, clarified Honey as much as is
needful for to kneade this flower to dough; then temper amongst it these
spices following, all beaten small, to wit, Cinnamom two ounces, Greines,
Nutmegs, and Cloves of each half an ounce, long Pepper one quarter of an
ounce, Mace and Galingall, of each one dragme, Cucubes one quarter of an ounce,
prepared Coriander one ounce and a half, then make thereof round or long
Cakes, and let them be slowly baked, when they be then almost baked, then
anoint them oftentimes with wine, then do they get above an orient or pleasant
color.

The right Sugar cakes be made thus: Take a pound of Sugar, which is decocted
to a sirup, and when you have taken it from the fire, then temper amongst it
four ounces of Wheat flower, and about four ounces of Rye flower, and make a
past thereof: at last put these spices unto it, viz. Ginger two ounces and a
half, Cinnamom two ounces, Cloves half an ounce, Nutmegs, long Pepper, of
each one quarter of an ounce, prepared powned Coriander half an ounce, Annis
(also unbeaten) three quarters of an ounce, and so let them dry together.

Other which be daily used: Take Sugar two pound, and power a quart of water
unto it, let it sees together, and clarify it well with whites of Eggs, when
as now the water is sodden to the half, then kneade amongst it five pound of
flower, two ounces of Ginger, two ounces and a half of Cinnamom, Nutmegs and
Cloves, of each one ounce, Pepper one dragme, and let them dry. If you will
make them of Honey, then take three pints of Honey, and a quart of water, let it
sees, and clarify it, then put therewith as is before rehearsed.

The Biscuit cakes be thus made: take of the old baked cakes, as many as you
please, and great them on a grater, then put Honey and spices unto it, and then
bake them once again.

The Noremberger Sugar cakes be made after this manner: Take one pound and a
half of Sugar, Cinnamom three ounces and a half, Nutmegs 2. ounces, Ginger 3.
ounces, Cloves and Cardamome, of each half an ounce, cut them, but not too
gross, and then take thereto one pint of Honey, set it on the fire that the
Honey may melt, and afterward take the Sugar, stir the same beaten very small
amongst it, and so let it sees very softly, that it do not burn or run over,
stirring it always well about, then mix therein as much flower and spice as
is needful, and work it upon a table: at last make cakes thereof about the
weight of six ounces, and work each a part, and bake them afterward as
behooves.

Loch, Lohot.. 49.
THus do the Apothecaries name certain mild Confections, which have but little
difference from other Confections, and therefore be they separated from the
other, that one might know how to ask for them.

Loch ad Ast^m^, that is for a heavy breath: this Loch is not much in use, it
is good for a heavy wheasing breath, for an old cough, and it does cause all
tough matter of the Lights to avoid.

De Cancris, of Crabs: this Loch is very good in the Consumption.

De Fa^fara, of Folefoot leaves: this Loch is to be used as all the rest.

De Papauere: this Loch is somewhat troublesome to be made, and is commonly
made at all Apothecaries: it is good against all coughs, and roughness of the
throat, which be cause of a hot defluxion, which may be perceived by the thin
and subtle spettle, and it makes the same thick.

There be two other Confections mo made of Poppies, under ye name of Diacodion:
amongst which that is which Mesua describes, and is thus made: take green
Poppie heads, that be somewhat withered, five or six in number, and fair
rain water 10. ounces; let them sees together, so that there remain a third
part: unto this colature add wine, and when the two third parts be wasted,
then put unto it one ounce and a half of good Honey, half an ounce of soft
Acatia, Saffron, Myrrh, and Pomegranat blossoms, of each half a drag.
Trocisci Ramich one quarter of an ounce: temper the^ all together, as
appertains: but there will be too little Honey, therefore must more be taken.
It is to be noted, that this may also be made into losinges: they be very good
for them that have any subtle defluxion falling on the breast, great coughs,
and other diseases mo.

De Passulis, of Currants: how it is to be prepared, and what his virtues are,
look in the first part, the fifth Chapter, and 12..

De Pino, of Pingles: this is to be sought for in the first part, the fifth
Chapter, and 6.. which is good for all old coughs, and for the short breath; it
causes all tough fleame of the Lights to avoid.

De Portulaca, of Purslain: this is not often used by us, but there are two
kinds made in Italy, which follow herafter: take the clarified juice of
Purslain 12. ounces, Trocisci of sealed earth, and Opium of each one drag.
Trocisci de Carobe, and Dragonbloud, of each half a dragm. burnt Hares hair,
and Bloudstone, of each one scrup. white Sugar six ounces, then sees it like
other Loch. This is especial good against spetting of blood, especially if it
be tempered with this confection following: take Henbane seed, white Poppy
seed, of each 10. drag. red and white sealed earth of each five drag. Conserve
of Roses 4. ounces; temper them together, give it in the morning and evening,
each time half a drag. The other: Take of the aforesaid three quarters of an
ounce, Philonij Persici 3. drag. Trocisci de Carobe one drag. and a half,
Species Diatragacanthi frigidi half an ounce, temper them together with
Purslaine water as before.

De pulmone Vulpis, of the Lights of a Fox: how highly the same is to be
praised, and how the same is to be prepared, is to be read in the first part,
Chap. 5. and. 12.

Sanum expertum, that is as much to say, as healthy and approved, viz. for all
old coughes and shortness of the breath, etc.

De Scilla, of Squils: how the same is to be prepared and used for all old
coughes, that may you read in the first part, the fifth Chapter, and 7..

The 11. Chapter.
WE will discourse in this 11. Chapter of many sundry causes, as follows
hereafter.

Almond milk.. 1.
ALmond milk is prepared after many manners, and that according to the quality
of the sickness. If so be that one will strengthen nature, then is the same to
be made the stronger and the thicker, and one must take the more Almonds, and
less water. But this is the common fashion to make it: Take Almonds as many as
you please, put them in hot water, and let them steep so long therein, until
one can peele them: then power cold water upon them, that through the heat of
the water, they lose no virtue; afterward powne the peeled Almonds very small,
and take them in a very clean cloth, power three or four spoonefuls of fair
water upon it, and then with a spoone rub out the strength, and so pouring only
more and more fair water upon it: you are to continue this straining, viz. so
long as you suppose yt there comes out any whitenes, then put as much Sugar
unto it as you think good. If you will use it for sleep, then pown a little
white Poppy seeds, and rub that through with the Almonds. If you desire that
the Almond milk be more cooling, then stamp a little Melon seed with it: if
one will use it against the flux, then is the water to be steeled: for the
breast be Currants and Licoras to be sodden in it: there be also Pingles
otherwhiles powned, Hasell nuts, and such like things with it, all according to
the quality of the malady. And albeit that this Almond milk be used for the
kitchen, yet it is also good for many kinds of infirmities and sicknesses.

Manus Christi.. 2.
HOw these losinges are to be prepared after two manner of sorts, with Pearls,
and also without Pearls, that is in the first part, the third Chapter, and
ninth. described, and they be very much in use, so that the common people
esteem them only to be a strengthening of the heart, although there are more
forcible things prepared for it.

Marchpane.. 3.
TAke good fresh Almonds, as many as you please, and peele them, as we have
taught of Almond milk: or if one have so much leisure, lay them a whole night
to steep in cold water, then will the peeles go off; afterward powne them
small in a stone mortar, and power a little Rosewater unto it: at last you are
to powne amongst it as much Sugar as you please, whether it be much or little,
this dough or past is to be spread on waters. But if the dough be too moist,
then hasten not with baking; otherwise will it be full of bladders. These
Marchpanes be most meetly baked in an oven, the top and bottom covered with a
mild fire, laying the Marchpane very dry therein, and there is laid for the
more certainty a paper beneath upon the bottom of the pan or oven. Will you
have the Marchpane very white? then must you make the fire very slow. But if
you will make a Marchpane to strengthen one (for which it was first of all
found out) then must you add Pingles, Pistacies, and other spices unto it, and
also water of Spike, of Lauander, of Endive, or take any other waters, as
Cinnamom water, and such like. The Sugar is also to be sod meetly hard; and
when it is well clarified, then stir it, and mix afterward the powned
Almonds amongst it.

For to counterfeit Marrow of bones.. 4.
TAke peeled Almonds, powne them very small, and make them often wet with
Rosewater, afterward then temper four ounces of beaten Sugar amongst it: and
to the end it may be harder, in rolling it put two ounces more of Sugar unto
it, and strew that on the outside upon it, then form it as you think good,
and bake it like Marchpane.

Medicamen de Turbith.. 5.
THe manner to make both these powders, and their virtues have we declared in
the third part, the 11. Chapter, and 20..

Melicraton.. 6.
THis do we call in English wine meade, whereof the ancient Physicians do make
two sorts, for the one they took two parts of sour wine, and one part of
Honey. When this is waxen old, then it is nourishing: when it is meetly old,
then it is very requisite for the stomach and the belly, and it expels also
urine: but after meat it is not very wholesome to be drunken. If one will use
the same quickly, then must these two things be boiled together. Other do take
six parts of Must, and let the same be hot, then do they power a quart of Honey
unto it, and when it has boiled awhile, then do they preserve the same. This
Meluraton is beforetime much more usual than now adays, and especially with
the Romans, which called the same Vinum Muscum.

Of Meade, a common drink.. 7.
THe Honey water and the Meade are not only invented for their virtue, but also
for necessity, chiefly in such Countries where no wine grows, or may not be
used. And it is very true, that this drink is more wholesome than sulphured
wine; for although the Mead be hot by nature, yet it is tempered with
moisture, wherefore it cannot ouerheate nor ouerdrie one. And albeit that this
Meade may be made according to the fashion of every Country, diuersely: yet
nevertheless is this the commonest manner, viz. that one take eight quarts of
water unto one quart of Honey, and so let it seethe by a gentle fire, skumming
it so long until it begin to be clear. It is also here to be noted, that how
much longer you think to keep the Meade, so much the longer are you to sees
the same. When it is cold, then put it into a vessel, and let it be three
fingers empty, to the end it may work. If so be that you desire to have the
same stronger and more forcible, then hang these spices following in it, viz.
Ginger, Cinnamom, Cloves, Galingall, Nutmegs, and such like, and that in
weight, as we shall write hereafter of the aromaticall wines. Some do take also
Saffron unto it, not only for the color, but also for his virtue, and for
that it yields a good savor to the Meade. When it has spurged or wrought,
then is the same to be letten lie stopped the space of three months. But in
case you desire to use it presently, then sees the same not long, and expect
not her working, but drink it freely as soon as it is cold, and then the next
day make new again. In Liefeland they have in some places a custom, that they
hoope their vessels with Iron, and so bury the Meade under the earth, and this
will be stronger than any wine, but we will permit such Countries to keep
their customs. If you do desire to make quickly a good Meade, then take a good
Nutmeg, and one ounce of Cinnamom cut small, and power thereon three quarts of
water, then let the third part sees away, and then put unto it half a pound
of clarified Honey: this being done, let it sees again together, until that
there remain about a good quart.

In old time was this Mead following to be made: Take Honey combs, wash the same
well with lukewarm water, and afterward let it sees well. But if it be not
sweet enough, then put more honey unto it, and scumme it well: afterward put
thereto prepared Coriander half a pound, Sage and Hops, of each one handful,
let a third part sees away, and so keep it in a fur fat, at last hang
Valerian, Cinnamom, Cloves, Nutmegs, and Mace therein.

Another sort: Take as much skummed honey as you please, put the same into a
clean leaded pot, and power as much water unto it as you please, then take Sage
and Marioram (according as you desire it to be strong.) If you will put any
Cinnamom unto it, that is also not amiss, then let it sees together, and
skumme it well. If so be that you desire to have it brown, then take two or
three spoonfuls of honey, and let the same sees well, and stir it well about
until that it be strong, as soon as you take it from the fire, then power
presently water upon it it will boil together, and then power the rest unto
it, strain out the herbs, and then keep it in a sellar.

The common virtues of these Meades be, that they quench thirst: It is also
good for all cold diseases of the brains, of the backbone, of the sinews, and
for all other diseases, for which wine is hurtful, by his penetrating virtue
and force, it cleanses and opens the breast, it takes away the cold dry
cough, it cleanses the kidneys, the raines, the conduits of urine, and the
bladder, of al cold slimie matter whereof the grauel and the stone does grow,
and it expels also all hurtful matter out of the guts, wherefore the same
is to be used in all diseases of the brains, as in the giddines, in the
falling sickness, and in lamenesse which is cause thereby. In like manner it
is good for them that be plagued with the Crampe, and the hot Podagra.

The 12. Chapter.
THis twelfth Chapter has no more than two sorts of compounded things, as oils
and some other which be made with vinegar, which be therefore called Oxymel,
Oxycraton, Oxysacchara, and such like. First we will write of Oils, whereof
there is much declared, and add thereto, for what they are to be used: amongst
which there be some first of Plants, of Fruits, and of Seeds, as well pressed
as beaten out: other by the addition of certain herbs, flowers, roots, and
other things which be decocted therewith. Some are distilled, and by force of
the fire be drawn out of Roots, out of Mines, out of Metals, and such like
things: and the manner of making them is diverse, whereof we will write
hereafter, and also declare thereby for what each of them shall be good.

Oil of Poplar buds.. 1.
BEcause that in the making of all oils there must heed be taken that the
herbs, flowers, roots, and such like be not put too moist into the oil, the
same must first of all be withered a little, and afterward be chopped small, to
the end the virtue and force may come the better out of it. If you have not the
hot Sun, then let it sees in a narrow pot in hot water. If so be that you
renew the herbs or the flowers two or three times, then is the oil the more
forcible. And now to come to our oil of Poplar buds: Take Sallad oil 12.
ounces, white wine twelve ounces, fresh Poplar buds (which be powned) nine
ounces, then let them steep the space of seven days in the wine and oil, and
stir them oftentimes about, afterward boil it in a narrow pot in water,
until all the wine be wasted, and afterward wring it thorough a cloth. It is
also to be noted, like as is beforesaid, that if so be you do renew the Poplar
buds two or three times, that then the oil will be the more forcible, which
may also be well done. This oil is very good against headache, pain of the
joints, of the raines, of the kidneys, and against the pain of the Gout, with
other pains more.

Oil of Mandragora.. 2.
IT is oftentimes before declared, what force the Mandragora has, to wit, that
it causes sleep, and causes insensiblenesse. This oil is prepared and made
in the same manner as al oils of other roots are made, but it is very seldom
used but when great need does require.

Oil of Amber.. 3.
ALl they that delight in distillations, and have endeavored themselves to draw
out the purest and cleanest out of all things, they have also found great
virtue in the oil of Amber; for which there has been made especial ouens,
glasses and other preparations, etc. which were here too long to discourse, but
we will only declare her virtue and use. First, there is nothing more forcible
against all venomous air, if one rub a drop thereof in the nostrels. In like
manner the losinges are also good, amongst which two or three drops of this
oil is tempered. The same is good against all sicknesses of the head as
against ye Palsy, and against the falling sickness, if one take it with Betonie
water, or with any such like water, and anoint it outwardly upon the neck:
but that is especially good which is distilled of the white Amber. It is also
very good for all diseases of the sinews, as for the cramp, the lamenesse, and
such like, it expels the stone, and the gravel, if the same be given with
the water of Parsley: it furthereth also Child birth if it be given with water
of Verueine, so does it also if one anoint the navel on the outside with
Snakes grease and it together. It is also very commodious against the
suffocation of the moother, if one anoint the same in the nostrils, and upon
the pit of the heart. The losinges wherein this oil is baked, be special good
against all cold rheumes, they strengthen the brains, they be good against all
swouning and heartbeating, and they do also strengthen the digestive power of
the stomach. In fine, this oil may be used in stead of the true and natural
Balm.

Artificial Balm.. 4.
OF this artificial Balm, and how the same is made after diverse manners, and
distilled, we have declared before in the second Chapter sufficiently.

Sallade oil, or oil of Olives.. 5.
THis Sallade oil is of all people so well known, that whereas oil stands
without any surname, thereby always Sallade oil is understood: and it is also
a gracious gift of God, that people may use the same for sundry necessaries,
which were too long to discourse: for how many kinds of Plasters, Salues,
Oils and Clisters, etc. be prepared of this oil? But as much as concerns
this Sallade oil, there be three sorts of the same used for Physic, to wit,
one that is through ripe, the second that which is not through ripe, the third,
which is very old, for that each one of the three has his proper nature: that
which is clean ripe is of a warm nature, so that it defends the body from
all cold being anointed thereon, it refreshes all the members, and makes
them fit for labor, it suppleth all the whole body and the skin, it
asswageth all pain of the joints, it clears the sight, it is good against
all venime if one drink the same often and vomiteth it up again: so that the
ancient Physicians have left a proverb behind them, Wine sustaineth the body
within, and Oil outwardly. When the oil is above a year old, then does it
lose much of her pleasantness, and the best drives always above, which is
contrary in Honey, wherein the best does lie always underneath, and the best of
the wine is always in the middle. The oil which is pressed out of the unripe
Olives, that is called Omphacinum, the same has power for many kinds of
things, and especially in Salues: it is also very meet for the stomach
through her astringent virtue, likewise it does fasten the gummes and the
teeth. The old oil is hotter than the other, and has also more virtue to
digest, it strengthens much the sight if it be anointed under the eyes, if
one can get no old oil, then look before into the Introduction how that the
oil is to be prepared.

Oil of Behen.. 6.
THis oil of the roots of red and white Behen is not very usual, howbeit
that we do sometimes remember it in this book.

Oil of Pyrethrum.. 7.
IT is an oil which is very hot, and that is not made at the Apothecaries,
but only if the same be prescribed to be made, therefore we will write no
further thereof.

Oil of Beuercod.. 8.
THe Apothecaries do make a certain oil of Beuercod, which is made of many
kind of things for all cold diseases, and especially for all diseases of the
sinews, and pain of the joints. It is very good for the Palsy, and stiffness
of the neck. It allayeth the cold in Agues if the back bone be anointed with
it. But we will here describe that which is easy to be made: Take Beuercod one
ounce, Euphorbium three dragmes, Myrrha one quarter of an ounce, white strong
wine eight ounces, Sallade oil twelve ounces: let it sees so long together
until the wine be thoroughly consumed, afterward strain it and keep it.

Oil of Lead.. 9.
THis oil of Lead is thus made: Take dry Ceruse one pound, Vinegar which is
two times distilled, one quart or more, and sees it in a narrow pot in
seething water an hour space, but stir it often about, and let it settle:
afterward distill it through a Filter, to the end the vinegar may run thorough
it, and the oil tarry in it: do this two or three times; then set this oil
in sand, and distill it slowly, then will come out of it that which is fair
and clean. This oil heals all ulcers marvelous well, as we in the fifth
Part, the fourth Chapter, and 4.. have taught. Another. Take Lead as much as
you please, and beat it very thin, then power as much distilled vinegar upon
it until it be well covered, then will it be lead white. When it is now clean
consumed, then set it certain days in the hot sun, or in horsedung, and
afterward distill it in sand, until that the water which distilleth do alter,
then set another receiver before it, and there comes a ruddie oil out of it.

Oil of Penniroyall.. 10.
THis oil is made like oil of Cammomill. You may adiudge the virtue by the
property of the herb, yet it is not much used.

Oil of Purslaine.. 11.
THis oil is prepared as the oils of other herbs, but it is made very
seldom.

Oil of Cammomill.. 12.
THis oil is thus made: Take well savoring Cammomill as much as you please,
put it into a pot, and power upon it as much old Sallade oil, until all the
Cammomill be well covered, and then set it the space of fourteen days in the
sun, or in some other warm place: afterward let them sees in a narrow pot
in seething water, and then put out the Cammomill, and put in fresh again, and
let it sees again, then wring it out well, and do this three times one after
another, and then keep it until you have occasion to use it. This oil is
good for many kind of things, it opens the pores and sweat vents, it
expels vapors, it allayeth rheumes, it is good for the sinews, for all
pain of the joints, and asswageth also the pain of the guts.

Oil of Capers.. 13.
THe oil of Capers is most commonly made at the Apothecaries in this manner:
Take Capers roots one ounce, rinds and leaves of Tamariske, the seeds of Agnus
castus, Hearts tongue, and Cipers roots, of each one quarter of an ounce, Rue
one dragme, Vinegar and good wine, of each one quarter of an ounce, ripe Sallad
oil twelve ounces, powne the roots grossly, and let them steep a whole night,
afterward sees them in an especial pot in boiling water, strain and keep
it. This oil is especially good for all hardness, obstructions, and pain of
the Spleen, but you may in seething put some more wine and vinegar.

Oil of Costus.. 14.
TAke of the very true and good roots of Costus one ounce, Cassie wood, or
Elecampane roots in stead of it, half an ounce, sprigs of Marierome gentle
four ounces, oil of Sesamum eighteen ounces, and wine as much as suffices.
Let it steep two days and two nights, afterward let it sees all together in
water until the wine be thoroughly wasted, which you may perceive hereby, if
that you let one drop fall into the fire, and that it hiss no more. This oil
is of a warm nature, it opens the obstruction of the stomach and of the
Liver. It is good against all diseases of the sinews, it auoideth the growing
of gray hairs, it preserves the body in his natural color.

In the first Part you have two other sorts of oil of Costus, which may also
be used for advantage, and they be also hoter than this present oil is.

Oil of Dill.. 15.
THe oil of Dill is made of the herb, of the flowers, and of old oil, like
as oil of Cammomill is made. This oil asswageth all pain, it opens the
pores, it consumes wind, also all cold and hard swellings, it takes away the
shaking of the Ague, it makes one to sleep, and takes away all pain of the
head in hot Agues, if the back bone be therewith anointed.

Oil of Eggs.. 16.
HOw this oil is made, and what it has for efficacy and power, is taught in
the first part, the third Chapter, and sixth.

Oil of Annis.. 17.
THis oil of Annis is made by distilling in this manner: Take one pound of
small beaten Annis, and put it into a glased helm, and power so much water
upon it until the helm be half full: but distill it the first time with a
mild or slow fire in boiling water, until it begin to be hot, afterward
make a good fire, until that the oil and the water do go over together. Now
being distilled, then separate the water and the oil one from another with a
glasen funnell, for that the oil swimmeth always on the top. This oil has a
great force against the giddiness of the head, and against the Collicke, and
is also highly commended against the falling sickness, if one give thereof
three or four drops. It is here to be noted, that if one will distill any such
like, that one is always to take for one pound, two or three pound of water.

Oil of wild Cucumbers.. 18.
THis oil is not usual in this country: But for what it is meet, look for
that in the Table.

Oil of Euphorbium.. 19.
THis oil is thus made: Take Euphorbium half an ounce, oil of yellow
Violets, and good wine, of each five ounces, let it sees so long until that
all the wine be consumed; afterward wring it through a cloth: it is especial
good for the cold brains and sinews. In like manner it is also good against
the pains of the head Cephalalgia, Hemicrania, and against the sleepie
sickness, if one anoint it in the nostrels. Item, for all pain of the

TAke the white leaves of Lillies, and prepare the oil like as is said of the
Cammomils. This oil heals all cold pain of the breast, of the reins and
the bladder, and especially of the Matrix, and also all pain of the guts. For
that it is of an hot nature, it has power to digest, it asswageth the cough,
it ripeneth all impostumations, it dries all bad sores of the head, and it
diminishes also all swellings, if one temper a little Saffron amongst it.

Oil of Hempeseed.. 22.
OVt of Hemp seed is this oil beaten: it warmeth and dries much, therefore
it does consume natural seed: yea if one eat too much of the same, then does
it the same hurt that Coriander does: wherefore the same is very seldom, and
that very little used in Physic, as also thereof but twice has been spoken
in this Book.

Oil of the kernels of Abrecocks.. 23.
OVt of the kernels of this fruit is oil pressed, like as is done of Almonds,
but it is very seldom prepared in this country.

Oil of Elderne flowers.. 24.
YOu are to make oil of Elderne flowers and of old Sallade oil, as oil of
Cammomill is made. It asswageth the pain, it cleanses, and is very good for
the yellow Iaundies, and all diseases of the Liver, and also for their
obstructions: likewise it does also take away all pain of the joints.

Oil of Saint John's woort.. 25.
OF this herb, you must take the tops when it begins to ripen, to wit, the
uppermost sprigs three ounces, steep them three days long in good Wine:
afterward wring them out well, and then put other in again and let it sees
together. Being sodden, wring it again even to the third time: and if the wine
were sod away, then put more unto it. Lastly, take three ounces of Turpentine,
old Sallade oil six ounces, Saffron one scruple: put this altogether in a
several pot, and so let it sees in seething water, so long until the wine be
consumed: then wring it hard through a cloth, and let it settle: so do the
Apothecaries make it. The Chirurgians do make it in this manner: Take four
pound of the uppermost sprigs of Saint John's woort, put them into a pot of the
quantity of five quarts, and power two pound of Sallade oil upon it, and as
much white wine until the herbs be covered: then stop the pot tight, and so
let it stand the space of six weeks: afterward make it open, and put one
dragme of Saffron unto it, but stop the pot by and by very close, and set it in
a kettle with seething water, and so let it sees the space of ten hours. This
being all done, then power it all together in a linen bag, and bind it very
fast unto it, and press it hard out whilst that it is yet warm, put it in a
glass and set it in the sun, or in another warm place; then will the oil
come on the top, lade it off then continually, and keep it well stopped in a
glass. This oil is hot and dry, and has an especial astringent virtue:
therefore it does also heal all wounds and all wounded sinews; yea all
burning of fire, it asswageth all pain of the hips, of the bladder, and does
expel urine, etc.

Oleum Irinum.. 26.
THere are two kinds described, and are both very troublesome to be made, they
be also not much used.

pressing, and is much commended for moving of urine.

Oil of Melilot.. 28.
SO is it also with this oil of Melilot, it is also seldom made, and also
very seldom used.

Oil of Cresses.. 29.
THis oil is also very seldom made, yet it is made like all oils of herbs.

Oil of Copper. 30.
THis oil do the Alchymists distill, like the oil of Lead, whereof there be
two kinds described before, and there is no other difference between them, but
that the Copper is somewhat smaller to be cut, and must be beaten somewhat
thinner.

Oil of Gourd seeds.. 31.
THis oil is not usual with us, and is very seldom used.

Oil of Lineseede.. 32.
THe virtue of this oil may be gathered by the properties of the seed out of
which it is beaten, and also out of many places of this book, wherein they be
commanded to be used.

Oil of white Sesamum.. 33.
THis oil is made of the seed Sesamum, and it is also beaten out of the
foresaid seed, like as the Lineseede oil, it has a special power to ease all
rough throats, to take away all hoarsenesse, and to make one have a good voice:
wherefore it is used in many parts of Physic.

Oil of Linen cloth.. 34.
HOw this oil is to be used, we have told in the first Part, and also taught
therewith how the same is to be made. It is to be used for all running eyes.

Oil of the seeds and flowers of Poppie.. 37.
FIrst of all there will be made of this plant and of the white flowers an
oil, which is more mild than the red and carnation flowers be, and will be
made with Sallade oil, like as Cammomill oil is wont to be made, yet at
sundry times renewing the infusing of the flowers, according to that one
desires to have it strong. This oil asswageth all hot pain, it cools
much, and is very good for all them that cannot sleep well, if the temples of
the head be anointed therewith: and as the hot vapors do draw to the head,
in any hot sicknesses, also the nostrels, the ears, and the temples of the
head may be anointed with it.

The oil which is made of the seeds of this herb, is made of the white, gray
and black seed, and beaten out of it, as the oil of Lineseed is made: it
makes fat, it asswageth the pain of the throat, heat of the Agues, and all
heavy dreams.

Oil of sweet Almonds.. 38.
THere be two kinds made thereof (of sweet and bitter Almonds.) This oil is
pressed out or beaten out upon a powning mill, like as the oil of Lineseed is
beaten out. But if one will drink the oil, then take Almonds well dried,
which have a fresh and sweet taste, as much as you please, powne them very
small, and parch them a little, afterward put a Rosewater unto it, and press
it well out with a strong press. But the oil of sweet Almonds is much used.
The oil of sweet Almonds is good against the roughness of the throat, of
the breast, of the lights, and against all drought of the same. Further, it
asswageth all pain of the joints, it is also very pleasant for to be occupied
in all meats, and good for all them which begin to consume, it makes fat,
and augmenteth human nature, it quenches thirst, it allayeth the heat of
the urine, and all pain of the bladder, together with all ulcers of the
womanhood, if the same be anointed thereon or iniected therein.

The oil of bitter Almonds does assuage all hardness of the sinews, it
opens all obstructions, it consumes wind and all bad vapors, and it is
especial good for deafness and all bad hearing, for all sissing of the ears,
and it takes also away all spots.

TAke the herb Marierome gentle four handfuls, wild Thime two handfuls,
Myrtle leaves one handful, Sothernwood and Mints, of each half a handful,
Cassie wood two ounces, unripe Sallad oil as much as will suffice for to cover
all the foresaid; then stop it tight, and so let it stand the space of eight
days in the sun: afterward wring it out hard, and lay fresh again therein:
do this thus three times together. This oil is special good for all diseases
of the brains and of the sinews, and it is especial good in bathing against
all lamenesse, or conuulsion of the Palsy Paralysis: if the same be anointed
in the ears and in the nose it takes away all sissing: it moves women's
terms, and it withstandeth all venime of Scorpions. Some do make this oil
only of the leaves, like as Cammomill oil is made, and it is made most so.

Oil of Masticke.. 40.
THe manner to make this oil, and also his virtue is described in the third
part, the eleventh Chapter, and fifth.

Oil of Narcissus.. 41.
THis oil is called by the Physicians Oleum Narcissum, and is made like as
oil of Cammomill is wont to be made. This oil is very good for the hardening
of the womanhood, or if the same be shut too close: it is also used for the
Palsy that comes of falls.

Oil of Mirtles.. 42.
OF this oil be two kinds made: that which is made of the seed has an
astringent virtue, wherefore it is also good for all hot ulcers, and for the
chaps of the Arsegut; it strengthens the slacknesse or looseness of the
sinews, and it stays sweat. But that which is made of the leaves,
strengthens only the brains, the sinews, the heart, and the stomach: but
because that we can get no fresh, they are first to be infused in good wine,
and to put unripe Sallade oil unto it.

Oil of Mints.. 43.
THis oil is made of Mints and unripe Sallade oil, like as the oil of
Cammomill is wont to be made. This oil warmeth the cold stomach, it takes

THis oil is made like as the oil of Almonds is wont to be made, that is, by
pressing it out.

Oil of Cloves.. 46.
TAke good fat Cloves half a pound, powne them very small, and distill it, like
as before in the 18.. has bin said of Annis seed. A pound of Cloves does
seldom yield more than an ounce and a half of oil. In the same manner may
oil of Nutmegs be also distilled, and there is hardly more gotten out of it
than five dragmes out of a pound: both these oils are more forcible than the
same spices.

Oil of Walnuts.. 47.
THis oil of Walnuts is pressed out of old Nuts, like as oil of Almonds: his
virtue do we find described in sundry places of this Book.

Oil of Pepper.. 48.
WE will refer the preparing of this oil to the Apothecaries; but it is good
for all cold diseases of the sinews, as for the palsy, the cramp, conuulsion of
the mouth, shaking, falling sickness, pains of the hips,, and other diseases mo
of the joints. In like manner it is also good for a cold stomach, for the
guts, for the raines, and for the cold bladder: for that it warmeth, it
auoideth all slimines, it opens all obstructions, it breaks the stone of
the bladder, and also of the kidneys.

There is also oil distilled out of Pepper, like as is said of the Annis.

Oil of Peach Kernels.. 49.
THis oil is also pressed out like to the oil of Almonds.

Oil of Quinces.. 50.
THe virtue and nature of this oil, and also the manner of making it, is
described in the third Part, the 15. Chap. and 5..

Oil of Rue.. 51.
THis oil is to be made of fresh Rue, like as oil of Cammomill is made: it is
warm by nature, it opens and swageth the pain, it is good for all cold
kidneys, for a cold Matrix, and for the pain of the same, if the belly be
anointed therewith, or if one set a clister with it. It is very meet for the
sinews, for the crampe, and it expels all cold humors.

Oil of Earthwormes.. 52.
IN the fourth part, the fourth Chapter, is the virtue of one of these oils
showed and the manner how to make it. But there is also another made, which
does warm more, does penetrate more, and strengthens all the joints: Take
Ca^momill, Sage, Agrimonie, and field Cipers, of each half a handful,
Rosemary half as much, Juniper berries one quarter of an ounce, Earthworms
decocted in Wine six ounces, white Wine one pint, Sallad oil fifteen ounces:
let it sees together until the wine be thoroughly consumed, and then wring it
out through a cloth.

Oil of Priuet.. 53.
THe Physicians and Apothecaries do name this Priuet Ligustrum. This oil is
made as the oil of Cammomill, it strengthens all sinewie parts, and hinders
the hair to be gray.

Oil of Rubarbe.. 54.
TAke Rubarbe nine ounces, Agaricus three ounces, Turbith three ounces and a
half, roots of Polipodie four ounces, Cinnamom and Juniper berries, of each
half an ounce, red, white, and yellow Saunders, of each four scruples, long
and round Hartwoort, Gentian, roots of blew Flower deluce, of Costus,
Asarabacca, Zeduarie, Ginger, Galingall, Elecampane roots, and Calmus, of each
one quarter of an ounce, Tormentill, and roots of Carduus Benedictus, of each
one dragme and a half, Nutmegs, Cloves, Bayberries, Mace, and Cucubes, of each
one drag. the seed of Sorrel, of Purslaine, red and white Behen, and
Doronicum, of each half a dragme, Lignum Aloes, red and white Coral, scraped
Iuorie, Masticke, Spica, and Campher, of each one scruple, burnt Iuorie one
dragme: powne them all gross, and then power upon it the clarified juice of
Burrage, and of Balm, of each six ounces, the juice of Oranges three ounces:
let it steep certain days together, stirring it oftentimes about to the end
it do not stink: afterward you are to disti^l it in seething water, then does
it first of all yield a water: but as soon as you perceive that it begins to
get another color, and that it begins to drop slowly, then augment your
fire and receive your oil in another receiver, and keep it well stopped, at
last set it ye space of 20. days in the Sun. This oil is somewhat ruddie,
and smells very well; so that if one put a drop in a great deal of well
water, then gets it a savor accordingly. This oil does purge very mildly
if one give half a dragme thereof more or less, according to the quality or
importance of the patient. This oil is most meetly given with goats milk: it
is also especial good against the Quartana, if the patient have governed
himself well before in his order of diet. In like manner it is also good in
all other Agues, which the Physicians do call Putridas: it kills and drives
out the worms if it be given with Purslaine water or with wine. This oil is
also especial good given once every six days against the Pockes: it is also
good against the rheumes, against the pain in the head Cephalalgia, against
the giddiness, and against the pain of the kidneys, it obstructeth women's
terms, and the flux of humane seed. It is good against the gout of the
feet, if once every fourteen days two or three drops of this oil be given
with the decoction of field Cipers. It is also very good against all running
Fistulas, against all ulcers, and against the canker: also for all diseases of
the places in women, and of the matrix, if one iniect half a drag. thereof with
the decoction of Feuerfew, it provoke also fruitfulness. The water that
comes out before the oil has his virtue also, for that it prepares all
humors which cause any sickness in the body, if one once or twice a day take
thereof half an ounce at each time with three ounces of Endive water.

Oil of Roses.. 55.
AFter the common fashion is this oil of Roses prepared, and is very meet for
diverse matters. It is made of Rose buds as the oil of Cammomill. This oil
cools much, and has an astringent virtue: it is good for all manner of heat
of whatsoever occasion that the same may be caused, used outwardly, or in
clisters inwardly, and it strengthens also the joints which be anointed
therewith, like as they be ordained for it throughout the whole book.

This oil is made very seldom of white Roses; and it cools also more, than
that which is made of red Roses,

Oil of Saffron. 56.
THe oil of Saffron is not used by us, but yet is prescribed in some places of
this Book.

Oil of Sandaraca.. 57.
THis oil is also utterly unknown, it is but once prescribed in this book.

Oil of Sulphur.. 58.
THis oil of Sulphur is an Alchimisticall oil, and is made in diverse manners:
some do put one quarter of Amber unto it; other do put Petroleum unto it. In
Italy do they take Sulphur vif, and power the urine of a manchild unto it, and
so bury it in horse dung; and afterward distill the oil out of it. But after
these two manners following is this oil chiefly made: Take 5. pounds of small
beaten Sulphur and temper oil of Tiles amongst it: afterward lute the helm
very tight, and and at the first make a small fire, and afterward increase it.
There is gotten out of the foresaid 5. pounds of Sulphur, no more than about
one ounce of oil: this oil must with great providence be given, to wit, in
winter time two drops with vital waters or Malmsey, and in summer time with
Endive water. This oil does assuage all griping of the belly, whether it be in
the undermost or in the uppermost guts: as also all pain of the stomach which
proceeds of wind and cold humors: the same may also well be used outwardly.
It is likewise very good anointed in the childrens mouths when they have the
canker, or any stinking ulcer in the mouth. Further warts (...) also taken away
with it, and it makes the teeth white.

To make the other oil of Sulphur: Take Sallad oil and power therein a good
deal of small powned Sulphur, and let it stand so long upon the fire until
that all the sulphur be clean melted, stirring it well about: then are you to
quench gloing pieces of coals in it, until the oil be thoroughly sunken into
the tyle stones. This being done, powne these stones and put them alone in the
helm: the rest that ouerfloweth, and also the Sulphur is to be done away, and
then distill further all that is put into the helm. The first oil that comes
out of it does appear somewhat bleake in the helm; and when it begins to be
white, then set another receiver under it. This oil seems to guild if it be
anointed upon Iron, or upon any other thing.

Oil of blew Flower-deluce.. 59.
THis oil is to be made like the oil of Lillies, but it will be somewhat
strengthened through the roots: it is somewhat strong, but it asswageth all
pain and melloweth all swellings, it is especial good against all hardness
of the joints, it warmeth the Matrix, drives away the crampe, and takes away
all pain and sissing of the ears: lastly, it does withstand the canker of the
nose.

Oil of Scorpions.. 60.
BEcause that we (God be praised) have no Scorpions in Eugh, therefore is the
oil brought unto us out of Italy, and is made thus: Take ten or twelve
Scorpions, cast them in twelve ounces of oil of bitter Almonds, and so set it
five or six weeks in the Sun; afterward strain it and keep it for to
use. This oil breaks the stone of the bladder, and of the rains, and it
drives the same also out, if it be anointed upon the raines, and upon the
priuities, or if it be iniected into the bladder: lastly, it is also good for
many other things more, etc.

Oil of water Lillies.. 61.
THis oil is made as well of the yellow as of the white water Lillies, but
unripe Sallad oil is taken for it, and it is made as the oil of Violets. The
oil of the white water Lillies has also the same virtue with the oil of
Violets, but that it is somewhat colder, but not altogether as cold as that of
Poppy heads: wherefore these oils are commonly tempered with other oils,
according to the quality of the disease. It is very good for them that cannot
rest, and for the pain of the kidneys of heat: also it is passing good
against all veneriall lusts if the priuities be anointed with it. It is also
used for diverse other matters, as may appear in diverse places of this Book.

Oil of Mustard seed.. 62.
THis oil is very seldom used, for that it is so hot.

Oil of Spikenard.. 63.
Under the name of Oleum Nardinum be there two sorts described: we will commend
the greater to the Apothecaries, because it contains diverse doubtful things,
but the smallest is thus prepared: Take good Spikenard three ounces, Wine and
Water, of each two ounces and a half, oil of white Sesamum eighteen ounces;
sees them together in hot water until that all the moisture be consumed,
then strain it. This oil does heat, digesteth, and refineth all that is
thick and gross, and is somewhat astringent: it is good for all cold diseases
of the brains, of the stomach, of the liver, of the spleen, of the kidneys,
and of the bladder, it cleanses the head if it be anointed in the nose, it
makes a good color, and also a good savor. It is brought now adays meetly
good and reasonable cheap out of France.

Oil of Antimonie.. 64.
THis oil is thus prepared: Take a pound of Antimonie, powne it ^^osse, and
set it in the fire in a melting crust, when it begins to smoke then cast
half a dragme of Boreas unto it: when it is molten, then power it upon a flat
stone and let it be cold, then stamp and melt it again, like as before, and
so do three times: afterward powne it to fine powder, and power vinegar upon
it which is distilled two or three times, then put it into a glass being
stopped very tight and close, yet stir it often about, and that so long
until the vinegar begin to be red, which is wont to happen in the space of a
month or twain. This being done, put all together into an helm, luted very
close, and distill it with a mild fire so long, until the redness be
discerned, and as soon as that is perceived, then augment your fire, and
fasten another receiver to it, and make a good fire as long as one drop of oil
comes out of it. Out of a pound of Antimonie you cannot have above one dragme
or twain, according to the goodness of it, or ye oil is well made. This oil
has a red brown color, it is also used for healing of wounds, and of old
ulcers, like as also for all Fistulaes, Leprosy, and for the Pockes, yet
nevertheless according to the importance of each sickness, if there be a drop
or twain taken tempered with any thing else. The ulcers are washed with the
water, but it is very sharp. Another: Take one pound of Antimonie, pown it
small, and put unto it one quarter of an ounce Mercurium Sublimatum, put it
then into a glass retort, and give it presently a good fire: there does come
no water out of it, but only (five or six hours after) clear oil.

Oil of Steel, or oil of Iron.. 65.
TAke small filed steel, or iron, and white Flint, powned very small, of each
half a pound, put it in a glasen helm, and distill it in sand, first with a
mild fire, and afterward always greater, it gives first water, and
afterward red oil, which has a very pleasant smell, even like to Balsam. Now
for to distill this oil, then are you to make an oven after the fashion of a
Retort, as the Alchimists do know. These things are rather searching out of the
secrets of nature, than necessary for Physic.

Rock or Peteroyle.. 66.
SOme of these oils be white, some yellow, and there are also some black,
which is called Naphta. This Peteroyle does run in Italy, and also in other
places out of the rocks: it does heat, dry and consume: it is also good for
the falling sickness, for the Palsy, for doting, and for the enfeebled
memory.

Oil of Turpentine.. 67.
THe manner to distill this oil have we showed in the fifth part, the
thirteenth Chapter and fourth.

Oil of Violets.. 68.
THis oil is made of blew Violets and unripe Sallad oil, it is somewhat colder
than the oil of Roses, therefore it does the more cool all heat, especially
the heat of the raines and of the kidneys: in like manner it does assuage the
dry heated breast, and is moreover good for many other things.

The oil of Wall flowers is prepared also of the flowers, and of old oil, it
is very good against the conuulsion of the sinews, it drives away all
diseases of the breast, the kidneys, and the bladder, and it is also good
against all pain of the sinews and of the Matrix: also it asswageth and
melloweth all other diseases.

Oil of Ireas.
THe oil of Ireas is utterly unknown unto us.

Oil of Vitrioll, or of Copperas.. 69.
THis oil is very highly commended, it gets an especial sweetness, which
is a miraculous work of nature, and is made thus: Take four pound of Hungary
Copperas, stamp it very small, and then put it in a great body, then let it
dry certain days: afterward powne it again, and so set it in a warm place
covered with a fine cloth, to the end that the savor of Copper may thereby
avoid. This being done power four pound of the best spirit of wine upon it
which is well rectified, suit it well, and so keep it forty days in a warm
place, or dunghill, and afterward distill it, then shall you see the oil
swim on the top of the wine. There be yet mo longer and mo other means for
to distill this oil, but this is the commonest manner. Concerning the virtue
of this oil, and her force, it is very needful that it be prouidently dealt
withal, it must always be mixed with somewhat else, for that it is too
sharp, that it will inflame the intrailes, otherwise has it the same force of
the oil of Sulphur, but it is much stronger and penetrating. It is very good
against all filth, and infection, and against the Plague it is especial good:
it has also great power to cause the matter of the Pleurisy to avoid out of
the breast, it is good for all tough fleame and corruption of the breast to
fetch it out, it suffers also no stone to grow in the bladder, and heals
the bruised or perished bladder. There is no more but three or four drops to be
given with wine. There may also losinges be made of it. Also this oil is used
by some, according to the importance of the cause, like as is admonished in
certain places of this book. This oil does strengthen the cold stomach, it
consumes Phlegma, it causes all tough and slimie matter to avoid, it is good
for the griping of the guts, and against all red fluxes, it quenches thirst,
it withstandeth all wambling and parbraking.

Because that these oils must be driven through strong fire, it does happen
otherwhiles that the glasses leap in pieces, by which all the cost, the
trouble, and labor is lost. Now for to prevent that, are the glasses to be
hardened in this manner following: first, are the bodies to be luted very well
with lome, and before that you will use the same, anoint them oftentimes with
Alum water, and so let them dry: and if so be that they happen for all that
to break, yet may they afterward be souldered together, that they may hold
water in this manner: Take Venice glass, red Lead, Linseede oil, Mill dust,
and the white of an Egg, mix it well together, and then spread it meetly
thick upon the crackes, and let it dry afterward.

Of the oil of Wheat.. 70.
THe oil of Wheat is made like as the oil of Annis seeds is made.

Oil of Juniper berries.. 71.
THis oil is drawn out of the powned berries. It may also be distilled like
as the oil of Annis seeds, but because that there is very much brought to
sell of it, the same may be bought better cheap than made. That which is
distilled out of the wood is made as follows: Bury a pot in the ground that
it stand about three fingers out of it, then take another pot which fitteth
well the undermost, and fill the same with small chips of Juniper wood, then
make over it a latten lid with many small holes, that the moisture may drop
thorough it, and that the chips fall not into the undermost pot. This being
done, then whelme both these pots one over the other, and then make a fire
round about the upper pot a good while, then gather the oil together which is
dropped into the undermost pot. This oil is very good against all that that does
outwardly infect the skin, as old ulcers and cankers, but especially against
the Varices. The oil which is drawn out of the wood, has an unpleasant
savor, but that which is drawn out of the berries, has a very pleasant savor
and smell. They have both of them one operation.

Oil of Willow leaves.. 72.
THe leaves, flowers, and fruits of this tree have an astringent virtue,
whereby they draw the wounds together and heal them, withstand the spitting of
blood, and take away all spots of the face. The oil thereof is good being
dropped in the ears, against the pain of the ears: and if the same be
anointed on the outside, then it is very good against the Gout, and it takes
away all unchasteness. There may also oil be drawn out of Willow wo^^, as it is
drawn out of Juniper wood.

Oil of Argall.. 73.
TAke four pound of Argall, poune it very small, and set it to burn in a pot

Ancient Physicians do make this oil, of Wormwood which grows in Ponto,
and with unripe oil, like as is said of the oil of Cammomill: but because

must take half so much Roses as Wormwood. This oil has an especial power
to warm, it strengthens also all that is cold, and especially the stomach,
it makes an appetite to meat, it opens all inward parts; and if one anoint
it on the Navel, it kills the worms, without any hurt: wherefore it is more

general.
BOth of these things, as Sirups and Juices, be almost innumerable that be used
in Physic, to wit, the juices of fruits, herbs, flowers, roots, and such
like things, sometimes alone, but tempred for the most part always with other
things, according as each pleases, as may be discerned thorough out all this
Book. Wherefore it is not our purpose to gather here together such things, but
only those which are most used: but we will as much as is possible, most truly
expound and translate their names into English, and also adioyne therewith
their operations and powers. First, you have in the Introduction how all Juices
are to be clarified. Secondly, it is also a general rule that no sower juices,
as the juice of unripe Grapes, Barberries, neither wine nor vinegar are to be
sodden in Copper vessels, for that they may get an hurtful taste: but the same
are to be decocted in earthen leaden pots. Thirdly, you have also in the first
part, the first chapter, and sixth. how that the compounded sirupes are to be
decocted. Fourthly, because that it imports much that the sirupes be not
decocted too hard, to the end they come not to candise, and that they be not
sodden too thin, and come not to be moldie: wherefore the proof also is
described in the introduction, whereby may certainly be understood when as they
be enough: like as is also sufficiently admonished of each sirupe that they may
be clarified.

Syrupus de Absinthio, that is, of Wormwood.. 1.
TAke Romish Wormwood, or if you cannot get it, then take of the common.
Wormwood six ounces, red Roses two ounces, Indy Spica three dragmes, good
white wine, and the juice of Quinces, of each four and twenty ounces, let them
steep all together in an earthen pot the space of one whole night, and
afterward sees it to the half: this being done, strain it, then put four
and twenty ounces of clear Honey or Sugar unto it, and then let it sees to a
sirupe. This sirupe is also especial good for the stomachs, for the liver, and
for all nourishing parts: it makes appetite to meat, and helps to digest
the meat: it is good for the falling sickness, it expels wind, and drives
out all bad humors by the urine. In the table under the name of Wormwood is her
virtue described at large.

Syrupus de Acetositate Citri, of the juice of Citrons.. 7.
TAke the juice of Citrons, which is strained through a cloth without wringing,
otherwise the juice will be thick when it is cold, like as pap, then teeth
away this juice, with half so much Sugar. This sirupe has the same virtue of
the sirupe of O^anges, whereof we will speak shortly, but that it is more
forcible. This sirupe is made thus in Cypro, like as hereafter follows. Take
clear juice, Sugar half so much, then stop it tight, and set it in the sun.
This sirupe remains always clear. Both these sirupes be good against all
venime, but especially for the Plague and all other putrified humors: it
strengthens the stomach, it cools the heart, and all other inward parts,
it quenches thirst, it brings sleep, it stays all vapors of the stomach,
especially if one drink too much. Read further in the Table of the Citrons,
and their virtues.

also be made of sower Oranges, for that the same is much more forcible than
that of Citrons.

Syrupus de Artemisia, of Mugwoort.. 10.

juice, sees it all together unto a sirupe: her virtue is to be read in the
Table of the Barberries.

tough slimie matter to avoid, and it opens all obstructions, wherefore it is
all good for all yellow Iaundis, like as there be many other sirupes.

Syrupus de Boragine, of Burrage.. 14.
WE have before admonished in the fourth Chapter in the description of the
Conserve of Burrage, that there is none, or indeed very small difference
between the Burrage and the Buglosse: nevertheless there be made at the
Apothecaries two kinds of sirupes, and commonly mixed with other medicines:
wherefore is an householder to prepare it thus. Take the juice of both these
herbs, of each 8. ounc. the juice of both these flowers, of each one ounce,
sees the same with four ounces of Sugar, and scum it as behooves, and ought
to be; you may also suffer the flowers to sees in some water, and power the
juice unto it. This sirupe is good against all diseases of the heart, and it

of Quinces. There is another sirupe described before of sower Quinces, called
Miua Cytoniorum. Further, there are juices or thick sirupes prepared under the

SOme do take not only the sowernes of the Citrons, but also the juice of the

strengthens the heart, the brains, all inward parts, and the vital spirits.
It strengthens the weak stomach, makes a good breath, and defends from
the Plague etc.

Canker, bad ulcers, and Fistulaes: like as his name shall show in the Table.

Syrupus de Eupatoria, of Agrymonie.. 25.
THe opinion of many learned men is, that our Agrymony is the true Eupatorium:

IT is a great abuse to wring out the sower and sweet Pomegranates together,
by reason that the sower and the sweet each a part are meet for sundry

cold, then keep it stopped very close. Although not only the Chirurgians, but

with this a new invention, whereof some princes have very great estimation, and
have also used otherwhiles for to remain thereby in their force, and to live
long (as they thought) which was this, viz. that one should choose a young
strong man, which was as yet in his flourishing youth, like as of 25. years,
which was somewhat choleric by nature: the same is to be fed the space of one
month, and be well dyeted with light and healthie meats, also with all kinds
of spices, and with good strong wine, who also is to be kept with mirth: this
being so done, then are both his veins to be opened in his arms, and so much
blood to be let out as he may tolerate and abide; and unto six pound of blood
mix one handful of salt: then put these together in a glass body, stopped well
and tight, and set it a whole month in horse dung, yet every eight days in
fresh horse dung: afterward distill this blood in ashes, when the water is
distilled out of it, then power it again in ye body, by all that which
remained therein, to the end it may be soft again, and in this manner distill
it seven times together. Other be of opinion, that as often as it is distilled,
that then it is to be set again in horse dung. Some suppose that it ought to
be but three times distilled, and that at the most: put the dry feces into a
Retorte, and distill it with moderate fire and then will it yield a stinking
oil. Afterward power oftentimes water unto it, and distill this oil as many
times with the water, until it loose her savor or stench. This water is to be
given in three or four times a year, each time one ounce; but not above three
or four drops of the oil. Each one may believe this as far as he will.

Concerning all other drinks, as Beer, Claret wine, Aromaticall wines, Barley
water, Iuleps, Almond milk, Meade, and such like: of them we have written
elsewhere. In the end of this book we will admonish and discourse of more other
herbed wines.

The second Part of this Chapter, of certain powders for Meat.
WE will not here admonish of any powders, which be serviceable and meet for
any sicknesses: but we will only speak of them that are used for pleasure, and
for to warm the stomach, or that may be strowed upon wine sops, as this
ensuing: Take elected Cinnamome one ounce and a half, Ginger three ounces,
Greines and Pepper, of each one dragme and a half, Nutmegs, Cloves, and Mace,
of each three drag. poune all very small together, Sugar as much as you
please, and according as that you desire to have it strong. Item, take Cinnamom
one quarter of an ounce, Nutmegs one drag. Mace, Greines, and Cloves, of each
half a drag. Sugar as much as you please: Or take Cinnamome one quarter of an

afterward. Another, take black, white, and long Pepper, of each half a drag.
Thyme, Annis, and Ginger, of each five greines, Sugar five ounces, then temper
them altogether. This is special good for all cold stomachs.

The third part of this Chapter, of Trociskes.
TRociscus is a Greek name, and is as much to say as a round shiue, or round
Cake, like as these Trocisci be made: but the Apothecaries do commonly make
them now adays four square, and about the weight of one dragme, which is of
small importance. These Trociskes be made diversely, whereof be many mentioned
in this our book: whereof we will only describe the name and force of them
that be too troublesome to make, to the end the same may be asked for at the
Apothecaries, when there is use for them.

be further necessary, that does the Register make mention of Iuorie.

Trocisci de Terra sigillata.. 23.
OF more than twenty things be these Trocisks made, wherefore we do leave them
to the Apothecaries. They be very much used, for that they be forcible against
spetting of blood if the same be given with the water of Knotgrasse: they be
also good against the bleeding at the nose if the same be anointed on the
forehead; and also for women's flowers if they pass away too excessive fast:
likewise for the bleeding of the pyles, and for pissing of blood, if it be
spouted into the yard, like as the same is mentioned in the Register under the
title of sealed Earth.

Trocisci de Violis, of Violets.. 24.
YOu must take Violet leaves which be somewhat withered one ounce and a half,
Turbith one ounce, the juice of Licorice, Manna, and Diagridion, of each half
an ounce; make Trocisks thereof with the sirupe of Violets. They are very
seldom used alone, but sharpened with three greines, or with any other pills if
they be given to any body that is hard to be purged. They are made also
without Diagridio, and they be also otherwhiles mixed with some other Trocisks:
look further for it in the Register of Violets.

For to make writing Incke.. 25.
WE must not pretermit ye description of this Incke (being a necessary
matter.) It is also made in sundry manners; but this is the commonest manner
for to make Incke: Take pouned Gall nuts one pound, Coperas half a pound,
rain water five quarts; sees them all together until the third part be
wasted, then let it settle, afterward strain it through a cloth: put four
ounces of Gum unto it, and then stir it oftentimes about. Some do not boil it
but let it stand and steep, stirring it very often and well: but take for it
no more but three quarts of water, and let the Gum be first dissolved in good
wine Vinegar until it be all dissolved, and then put the other substance unto
it, and thus it is also best of all and does remain always without moulding.

For to make common Vernish.. 26.
VErnish is made after sundry ways, and there are also sundry sorts of them,
each for an especial use: the one is made thus, and the other so. But we will
here describe only and teach how that it shall be most fitly made, and for
what it shall be requisite for each one. First take old Linseed oil, and
seethe it so long until it be as thick that if you do take a drop of it out,
and let it be cold, when you press upon it with your finger it spinneth two or
three threads, or glueth to the finger. This oil being now so sodden, put
Rosin unto it as much as shall suffice for to make the Vernish thick enough:
then let the Rosin decoct together with the oil so long until it do stand
wholly still. This Vernish is good for the Smithes, for the Trencher-makers,
for the Trunck-makers; and further for to Vernish all slight things.

Of Painters Vernish.. 27.
TAke old Linseed oil and seethe the same as is aforesaid; afterward put
amongst one pound of the oil, half a pound of Masticke or somewhat more, and
so let it seethe together a good while. This being done, then set it in the
sun, in a leaden Basen, and power one part of water upon it, and stir it
well together; then will the oil come upon the top, and let it stand so
clarifying in the sun and air the space of two or three months. But it is
to be noted that you must always take good heed of the fair weather, and of
the rain, and also of the night: for if so be that it did rain, then would
your oil run over and so you leese the same: wherefore must you have always
ready a board or plancke for to cover the same oil, as well from the rain, as
from the night, upon adventure least that it should rain at night, etc. You
may make also a fair Vernish of the oil alone, to wit, through the seething
it away, and then let it clarify as is before said.

For to make odoriferous Vernish.. 28.
FOr to make this odoriferous Vernish you are to take a new earthen pot which
is well leaded, and put into it one pound of oil of Spike, and let the same be
boiling hot: afterward you are to take half a pound of Sandaraca, or somewhat
more, and strew the same amongst it being beaten small, always with a little
at once, and stirring it well about; then set this Vernish to clarify as is
said before. This Vernish dries very hard and with a fair gloss: it has an
especial good savor, and may be used for all things that you please.

The 17. Chapter.
IN this Chapter do come no compositions, but only those which be tempered
with blew Violets and wall Flowers, whereof we have oftentimes written before,
whereof each is to be found in the Register: as the Iulep of Violets, that you
shall find in the third Part, the twelfth Chapter and tenth. The sirupe of
Violets in the fifteenth Chapter, and 53.. The Conserve before in the fourth
Chapter. The oil of Violets in the twelfth Chapter, and 69.. viz. in this
eight Part. The Vinegar of Violets is made, like as the Vinegar of Roses is
wont to be made.

The 18. Chapter. Of all kinds of VVines.
IN this Chapter be all Wines contained, which be made with any kind of Herbs,
and such like things, viz. all such as may be accounted amongst the Physical
remedies: and because they are commonly prepared with Wine or Must, therefore
we will write first of them, and that in the briefest sort: for that to write
of all kind of Wines were a matter without end.

Of Wine in general.. 1.
IT is most true, that this noble Plant is made of God for diverse necessities
of mankind, notwithstanding that man does daily abuse this noble gift of God so
shamefully, and so in stead of doing good thereby, harmeth his body, and
provoke sickness, wherefore we must discourse and treat somewhat of both
these things.

In this do all learned agree, and daily experience does teach us, that Wine is
so commodious and necessary for man's life, and for his health, that there can
no better drink be devised. Moreover, it withstandeth all poison, and is
especial good for all sorenes of the Kidneyes, and for all pain of the
Bladder. But especially sour wine strengthens the stomach: further, it does
provoke digestion, it sustaineth natural power, it strengthens all inward
and outward parts, it keeps a body with a good color, it makes fresh and
healthie blood, it makes the languishing merry, the dismayed courageous, it
carries the well digested meat into the inward parts, it consumes the slimy
humors, it strengthens and dries the brains, it refreshes the heart, it
sharpneth the wits and the understanding, wherefore it is of the heathen endued
with a godly name, and is called Liber, that is free. Further, it brings with
it the pleasant sleep, it provoke venery, and makes women fruitful. In
fine, Wine has so many virtues, that Asclepiades said, That the power of wine
may well be compared with the Gods. Esdras does write (which I cannot
pretermit) that Wine is stronger than men that drink it, that it alters the
wits, that it makes Kings, wise, poor, and rich men, it assures and
sharpneth the understanding, it causes all pain to be forgotten, it
satisfyeth all concupiscence, it cares neither for King, nor Princes, and it
utters all that it lists and pleases. These be now the commodities and
auailes which Wine can bring with it.

But what shall I say to the contrary of those things which it does if it be
superfluously used, but we have enough spoken thereof in the sixth part and
eighteen Chapter, where we discourse of the Plague; but we will proceed with
those things that are more fit for our purpose. We have before admonished, that
there can no more commodious nor healthier potion be found for man's nature than
wine, and of all other are best the fair, clean, light red, and they that
have color like Geese feet. But for to have a full and perfect instruction of
wine, and for what Sickness each wine is prescribed or forbidden, that is to be
seen in the table of the Vine. In like manner, there is also found here a
perfect instruction of Must, of vine cuict, and of spirit of wine; also of
vinegar, and for what the same is good within and without, and for what it is
also hurtful. Lastly, we will describe sundry herbed wines, to wit, how that
they be made, and also what operation they have.

Of sundry natures of Wine.. 2.
IT is also very needful, that one do know the nature of wine, for that some
of them do alter their nature, according as they be young, old, white, red,
thick, subtle, small or strong. The white wine is warm in the first degree:
the very old wine in the third degree: but the wine of a year old keeps the
middle mean. The thick red wine makes much blood, because it needs no great
alteration, but the thin, white, and sour wine, gives little nourishment. The
thick and troubled wine obstructeth the belly, the Liver, the Spleen, and the
Kidneyes, so that all they which use the same too much, are wont to be
troubled with the Dropsy and Gravel, and especially the old folks. Out of
this may each one choose such wines which be most meet for him.

Of Must.. 3.
THe wine which we call Must, that is new wine, which is first pressed out, and
not long cellered, and has not as yet wrought thoroughly, like as the same is
known unto all men: this Must has his proper nature, but there is almost no
Must which does any good, but many that are hurtful. But Must is commonly used
when one will make any herbed wines.

Of vine cuict, or decocted wine.. 4.
THe Physicians do call this wine Sapam, it is commonly decocted so long of
Must and other strong wine, until that of three quarts there remain but one.
This decocted wine is used in Physic very much inwardly and outwardly.

Of burnt wine.. 5.
THe burnt wine is for the most part burnt of the dross, or leese of wine,
which is not used so much for Physic, as that which is distilled of clear
wine, and is rectifyed two or three times over again.

Of Vinegar.. 6.
THat Vinegar is made of sour wine, is apparent to every body. It is also a
marvelous work of nature that it spoyleth wine, and alters it out of his
natural course, and makes some other thing thereof, which is a thing by it
self, and used as well in Cookerie as for Physic, which is no less pleasant
than wine it self. For Dioscorides, and other mo learned ascribed to vinegar
many innumerable virtues, like as we find by daily experience, therefore is
also the red as well as the white vinegar ordained in Physic for many kind of
causes, as it is also in some diseases forbidden. The leese of the vinegar is
also otherwhiles mentioned in this book.

The nineteenth Chapter. Of Herbed wines and such like.
FIrst, we will teach here how this Wine is here to be prepared, the which is
effected after sundry manners, and as likes each one best. The common manner
is, that the herbs are to be gathered between the midst of August, and
midst of September: but the fittest time is, when they bear their flowers.
These herbs are to be dried in the shadow, or at least in a luke warm Chamber
where it does not dust, until you will use the same. If now you will make any
Herbed wine, then take a small vessel as big as you will, and put therein
Beechen or hasell chips into it, strew upon it a good deal of dried herbs,
without wringing, and afterward one part of chips again and herbs: do this so
long until that all the whole vessel be full, and afterward fill it with
Must. If so be that it be strong, then may you drink of it the sooner, and
fill it full again. But to procure further advise thereof, therefore we will
add unto this how to make other sorts of herbed wines. If one will keep these
wines sweet, then is one part of the Must to be decocted away with a light
fire, and that according as the Must is strong, or thin. Other do prepare their
herbed wines by a certain distillation with such herbs as they will
themselves, so that they keep their smell, power, and virtue, that if so be
that one put but two or three drops of it into a quart of wine, that then all
the wine will taste of it, so that thereby many expenses, labor and travel is
spared. But because that such experiments be not known unto all men, therefore
may they use these things following: Take such herbs as you will, whether they
be flowers or roots, which be very dry, poune them, and power upon them good
burnt wine: afterward stop it tight, and let it stand so asteepe the space of
certain days; afterward strain them out through a cloth, and then preserve
it in a glass. When as then you will have such wine, then power thereof
whether it be much or little into it; and if so be that you have no burnt wine,
then take good old strong wine in stead thereof. But excepting the boiling or
distilling (...) it, the wine it self is of that nature, that very shortly it
draws to it the power, smatch, savor, and virtue of those things which are
infused therein. Some suppose, that one must cast into the vessel only the
herbs, roots, seeds, flowers, or any thing else that one will, and to power
new Must upon it, whether it be much or little, according to that the wine or
any thing that is in it be strong or weak. Other do cast the roots, herbs,
and other things in it when ^he wine is a year old. Some do take the herbs or
roots etc. green: some dry. Some do shred the herbs: some do stamp them to
powder, and so hang them in a bag. Each may take out of this which likes him
best. Let this suffice for the making of the wines.

Wine of Elecampane roots.. 1.
THis wine is prepared after diverse sorts, but the best manner is which also
needs not much trouble, as hereafter follows: Take Must first trodden out of
the Grapes, and let it sees without any smoke about it even to the half it
that you desire to have it sweet. In this you are to sees Elecampane roots
which be dug up in the spring time, and cut into slices, and dried on a
thread. Sees them so long in it until they have lost all their bitter taste:
and if one will often use this wine, then are the roots so much the oftener to
be sod with new wine, that the wine may abide by his power, and the vessel is
always to be filled up again with wine. This is a very profitable potion for
the head and the brains; in like manner also for to warm and strengthen the
sinews if the same be vexed with rheumes. This wine is also good against al
cold diseases of the lights and of the breast, it cleanses the same, it
strengthens all bad digestive stomachs, it refreshes natural warmth, it
warmeth the sinews, it opens the passages of urine, it is good against all
winds, it strengthens the Matrix, and it cleanses the same of all cold
phlegmatic moisture, and it provoke also the terms.

Eyebright wine.. 2.
THis wine is made of the herb, as we have taught before, his virtues are
described in the first part, the seventh Chapter, and 20.. and in other places
more.

Wine of whole Grapes.. 3.
IF one will make this wine as it ought to be, then take whole red or white
Grapes taken from the stalks and well cleansed, and put them into a vessel
with chips (as we have taught before) fill the white with white Must, or with
Fern wine, and the red with red wine. Some do boil it in Must, and that
according to each ones pleasure, as also some there be which put no chips unto
it, but they do put Sage leaves unto it, and let them lie a certain time in
it. There be spices also wont to be hanged therein, so that the wine may get
thereby not only a pleasant, but also a strong and good taste.

These wines are first of all very commodious for all hosts and householders,
so that all that which remains of other wines, and is not drunken, may be
powered unto it. Such wines be very acceptable, but if one do drink too much
thereof, then do they hurt the head, for they do distemper the brains, and
that chiefly in the evening after supper, for that they be much subtiler, and
more ascending than other wines: they make a body quickly very sleepie, they
provoke vomiting against evening, but in the morning they make merry: and
amongst all other there be none that hurt the brains more than this, wherefore
they are both drunken more for lust and pleasure than for commodity of health.

Wine of Auence.. 4.
THese odoriferous roots do the Apothecaries and Physicians call
Garyophillata, the same is to be dug up in the spring time, but chiefly in
March, in which time the roots be most forcible: let these roots dry well,
and when they be cleansed, then hang them afterward in the wine, it will get
thereby a very pleasant favor and taste, which refreshes the heart and
strengthens: it opens the obstruction of the liver, warmeth the cold and
moist brains, dries and strengthens the cold slimie stomach, it asswageth
also all pain of the Matrix.

Betonie wine.. 5.
THis Wine is made of brown Betonie, as all other herbed wines be: it is
especial good against all belching and wambling of the stomach, it
withstandeth the ouerflowing of the gall, it is many times approved in a cold
Matrix, and against all suffocation of the same, it strengthens all inward
parts, it warmeth and heals also the same, it opens the obstructions, it
consumes all cold humors, it expels all venomous matter by the urine and by
the stool, and in like manner also the yellow Iaundise: and if the same be
oftentimes used, then it is very requisite against the falling sickness,
against the Sciatica, against the sickness of the lights, and against the
Consumption: It is also very necessary against the cough, against short breath,
and it expels also all agues which do come out of a foul stomach. The same
power have the red Gilloflowers, like as the same be also a kind of Betonie,
whereof hereafter we will speak further. This wines use and operation you
shall find described in other places more.

Burrage wine.. 6.
WE have admonished before of the description of the Conserve and Sirupe of
Burrage, how there is small difference between this herb and the Buglosse,
wherefore also both these herbs may be taken for this wine, like as we have
taught before, or the juice of the same may also well be used with this wine,
which wine does drive away all poison from the heart, it cleanses the blood,
it makes merry, it refreshes the vital spirit, it drives away all
pensiveness and all bad thoughts, it is also very necessary for all them which
do fall easily into any swouning, and is of a full temperate nature, etc.

Wine of Asarabacca.. 7.
THis wine and other more be prepared against the gravel, like as in the third
part, the 17. Chapter, and 4.. is described, and you shall further find in
other places more for what it is more commodious.

Wine of Framboyes.. 8.
THis wine is made like as the wine of the whole Grapes is made, it has the
nature of the same berries, it is much commended in the Plague and Squinancie,
but if one put none other wine unto it, then is it not very pleasant, wherefore
it is not commanded to be used in any other places of this book.

Wine of Hearts tongue.. 9.
THere be two kinds of Hearts toongs, viz. the Ceterach, which is the right
Hearts tongue, and the long Hearts tongue, which is hairie about the stalks, they
may be taken both together, and to make this wine as all other wines: it is not
very pleasant of taste, but it is of great force, for that it opens and
strengthens the Spleen, it is good against all poison of Snakes, and being
drunk warm, it asswageth all crampes and scowring of the belly, it takes
away the yellow Iaundise, and also obstructions of the liver: it is also very
good for all them which be vexed with the stone and with the gravel: it is
also good against all melancholy, and expels the quartaine Ague, it
consumes all clotted blood which is caused in the breast through falls, it
opens also the conduits of urine, and heals all diseases of the same. For
what this wine is further meet, that is to be found described in other places
of this book.

Wine of Hyssope.. 10.
THis herb is hot and dry by nature, which virtue the wine also has,
wherefore it is good for all old persons, for it warmeth all inward parts, it
asswageth the cold and moist cough: it is also good against the falling
sickness, for when the same is used often and long, then does it take away the
same, and that especially in young folks. It is also good for the breast and
the lights, for it warmeth the same, and consumes all tough slimie matter, and
also all agues which may spring out of the same: it opens the pipes of the
lights, and it makes a clear voice, for it cleanses the breast, and heals
all anguishes of the same: it takes away the shortness of breath, and is
especial good against the Dropsy, like as is admonished and described in more
other places of this book.

Winter Cherrie wine.. 11.
THis wine is also made like as the wine of whole Grapes, it is very much used
against the stone, the gravel, and is also especial good for all them which
can hardly make water.

Cherrie wine.. 12.
Upon the river of Rhene, and every where else, all wines which be made of red
or black Cherries, are called Cherrie wines, and they make the same as
hereafter follows. Pluck the Cherries from the stalks, and poune them in a
stone mortar with stones and all, and then pour red or white wine upon it: but
this wine will be very small, wherefore it is prepared after another manner with
whole Cherries as follows: Lay in a vessel of beechen or hasell chips as
many as you please, and then one part of Cherries upon it, and so further
until it be full, like as we have said and taught of the wine of Grapes, fill
then the vessel full of wine, and so let it lie three or four days, then
shall it be sufficiently colored. This wine is of a good tempered nature, is
very requisite in summer time in great heat for to assuage therewith thirst, and
to moisten the inward parts. It opens also the liver, it expels urine,
especially if the kernels with the stones be broken in it, for these kernels
expel the gravel. Some do hang spices therein, which cannot be good, because
his nature is altered thereby. Look into the table of the Cherries.

Lauender wine.. 13.
THere is but little made at once thereof in a small vessel, whereof may not be
drunken long. There is a long bag hanged in it with Lauender flowers, and
interbastated or quilted. to the end that not all the flowers fall in a heap.
This wine is especial good for a cold head, and for moist brains, for the
giddiness, for the falling sickness, and such like diseases.

Of Malmsey.. 14.
ALbeit that this wine be tempered neither with herbs nor with spices, but by
nature, and of it self is a noble and pleasant wine, which is brought unto us
out of Grecia, and other countries adjacent, yet shall it nevertheless not be
against our purpose, because that the same is very much used in Physic, that
his power and virtue be showed at this present, look for it in the second
part, in the sixth chapter; and in the third part, the 11. chapter, and 14..

Wine of Marierom.. 15.
THis wine is prepared as all other herbed wines are, it strengthens the
brains, and warmeth all inward parts: it is very good for all them which be
inclined to the dropsy, it asswageth the pain of the belly, it expels
urine, and moves women's terms: it is a very good potion for to warm the
head, and to strengthen the memory, as you find described in diverse places of
this book.

Wine of Cinnamome.. 16.
THis aromaticall wine is so called and placed amongst Claret wine, whereof we
have admonished before in the eighth part in the third Chapter. This Wine is to
be prepared in the harvest, and will keep good throughout the whole year; it
has all the virtues of Hypocrasse: Take one and a half, or two barrels of
Must, sees the same as we have taught of the wine of Elecampane roots, when
it is cold, then put it into a clean vessel, and put thereto as many whole
Grapes plucked from the stalk as will go into the third part of the vessel:
afterward make a linen bag, and put therein two pound of Cinnamome, Ginger
one ounce, Galingall one ounce and a half, Pepper and Greines, of each half
an ounce, Cloves and Nutmegs, of each one quarter of an ounce, Cucubes,
Cardamome and long Pepper, of each one dragme, Mace three dragmes, powne all
gross, and hang these herbs in it. This Cinnamome wine may be used for all
cold diseases of the head, as all other Aromaticall wines are to be ^sed. Item,
for all cold and unfruitful women: but to the contrary, all young and hot
people and all they that be burdened with hot Agues, must shun this wine as
poison. Of this foresaid wine is admonished in many places of this book.

Muscadell wine.. 17.
THis wine grows in Candie, from whence it is brought to Venice, and brought
thence unto us, and is often used in Physic, like as is admonished in many
places.

Wine of Gilloflowers.. 18.
THis wine is made of red Gillofer flowers, and made after the same manner as
the wine of Betonie is made, which has also the same force, like as both of
these herbs taken to be of one efficacy, and is commended in sundry places
of this book.

Wine of Buglosse.. 19.
Look for it before in the sixth. of the wine of Burrage.

Wine that purges.. 20.
THese purging wines be made after many kinds of ways, like as you find them
described in their places, whereof you have one for an example in the third
part, the eleventh Chapter, in the end of the twentieth. which may be used for a
common opening of the body.

Wine of whole Grapes.. 21.
IT is before described in the third. wherefore we will not here discourse any
further thereof.

Vinum Punicum.. 22.
THis is no artificial wine, but it is a wine which is of it self so grown
without the addition of any thing unto it. It is very healthy, and also good of
taste. The same is drunken in Germany, not only at great feasts, but also
used for Physic, like as is sufficiently admonished thereof in the Table.

Rosemary wine.. 23.
THis Rosemary wine is marvelous much commended, and taken for a very
wholesome potion, especially in all cold sicknesses. It strengthens the
digestive virtue of the stomach, it causes appetite, it fortifieth the heart,
the brains, and the sinews, it gives a fair pleasant color, not only
drunken, but also the face washed therewith, it consumes all inward putrified
humors, and it preserves the body from all sickness. If the mouth be often
washed therewith, then does it make a well sauouring breath, it strengthens
the teeth and the flesh of the teeth: wherefore it is also very good that all
outward ulcers, viz. the Canker, fresh wounds, and such like sores be washed
therewith. Further, this wine is good for all diseases of the lights, for the
consumption, and especially for all them that are rheumaticke, and moist of
brains. It is also good against the Palsy, against the falling sickness,
against the lamenesse, and against the cold Matrix, it heateth and dries the
same, and makes it also meet for conception. Thus if this wine must be made
in haste, and not be kept long, then may you take Rosemary flowers, Hearts
tongue, and also rindes of Thamariske, of each half a handful, then pour upon
it seven pots of Must, and then let it so stand and work or run over, and
fill up the vessel always with other good wine. Item, take Rosemary and Hearts
tongue, lay it all a night to steep in wine, and then use this wine in stead of
the foresaid wine if the same cannot be gotten: his virtue and power is
described in many sundry places.

Wine of Sage.. 24.
THis wine does heal all soreness of the mouth, it sets fast the teeth and
also the gums, it strengthens the sinews and all lame joints, it dries the
moist brains which are hurt through Phlegma, it freeth from the crampe,
trembling and shaking, and also from the falling sickness, the same being
drunken, and the liver anointed therewith, or the hot vapor thereof received;
for what it is further meet, that is admonished here and there in this book.

Wine of Clarie.. 25.
THe deceitful falsifiers of wine have made this precious herb (which is a
species of wild Sage) very suspicious, so that it is esteemed hurtful: but it
is in truth not so, for if with this herb (as with all other herbs) the wine
be prepared, then is it very fit for the head and for the stomach, for that it
dries and warmeth the cold moist brains. It is also much to be compared with
the wine of Sage and of Rosemary for his virtue, and this is also the cause
wherefore we make so little mention thereof in this book.

Wine of water Lilly flowers.. 26.
THis Wine is prepared very seldom, as also it is but once remembered in this
book, and that in the Consumption.

Tamariske wine.. 27.
THis plant does willingly grow in moist places, and to this wine is always
used the middlemost rinds, it has the same power of the wine of Hearts tongue,
wherefore they are commonly used together, as may be seen in many places of
this book. This wine may also well be drunken for to cleanse the blood with
it, and to consume melancholicke humors which do cause the quartaine Ague and
the Seuruie, and such like sicknesses. What virtues this wine has more, look
for that in the Table, in the description of the wine of Hearts tongue.

Wine of Wormwood.. 28.
ALthough that this wine has a bitter and unpleasant taste, yet has it
nevertheless a marvelous great virtue, and is used above all other herbed
wines. First of all it kills the worms, it withstandeth poison, and it
expels the hurtful phlegm; and if one drink the same often, it cleanses
and strengthens all inward parts that they cannot receive such matter, it
dries the vapors of the stomach that they cannot ascend into the head, it
makes appetite, it opens all obstructions of the inward parts, viz. of the
liver and the Spleen, and it takes away also the yellow Iaundise which is
caused thereby, it freeth from the Palsy, the falling sickness, and all
lamenesse, it restores lost speech, it strengthens the weakened joints if
the same be well rubbed and fomented with it; and if men's or beasts wounds be
washed with it, then is the same kept fair and clean, and suffers no foul
flesh to grow in them, but heals them: it cures also all scald heads if the
same be washed with it. If any one would go to sea, then is he to drink
certain days before some of this Wine, for that thereby shall he be freed of
the sea sickness. Moreover, this Wine is an especial preservative against the
Plague, and against all venomous air, if one take a good draught thereof
before that such patients be visited, it brings also sleep with it, and
takes away heavy dreams. But by reason the common people have not always
this wine in a readiness, the juice of Wormwood may be tempered amongst Wine,
and be used in stead of the Wormwood wine. This Wine is meet for many more
other diseases, like as may be read here and there in this book.

Wine of Zeduarie.. 29.
TAke in the beginning of winter one barrel and a half of Must, let it sees
softly, like as is described of Elecampane wine, afterward put it into a
clean vessel, and then put these spices following unto it: Take good
Cinnamome one ounce, Zeduary half an ounce, Cloves one quarter of an ounce,
Ginger, Galingall, greines and long pepper, of each one dragme, poune them all
together gross, to the end that when the power of the Zeduary is gone the
spices may dry, and take out the Zeduary of it and put fresh unto it: if so be
that you desire to keep this wine long, then is the same to be filled up with
decocted wine, and not with common wine. This wine has the same efficacy and
power with all aromaticall wines, and may also be used in steed of them.

How the infirmities of all Wines are to be amended.. 30.
WE are here not to write too largely how all the infirmities of wine are to be
amended, but are to commend that to the wine sellers, by reason that thereof
diverse books are written: for amendment of all wines does serve very well M.
Tristrams water, which is described in the first part, the fifth Chapter, and
1.. In like manner also all golden and vital waters which before in the eight
part and sixth Chapter are described, if there be poured a little of them in
wine which is dead or low, and stirred well about. Item, in the month of May
you are to take a branch of a young green tree, shave off the uppermost rindes,
and lay them the space of three days in fresh water: afterward wash them
well, and then pour fresh water again upon them. This being done, let them
lie the space of three days, wash them well again, and then dry them in the
shadow. If you have now any wine which begins to be dead, then take three or
four of these rindes all of a length, and bind them to a thread, and hang them
in the wine, it will thereby be very good and clear.

There be here and there described diverse sorts of wines, which be prepared for
sundry sicknesses and parts of man's body, viz. for the Head, for the Liver,
for the Milt, for the Heart, and for the Raines, etc. each one may look for
them in their places for which they will use them. Herewith we will in the name
of God finish this our Book of Physic, and commend the same unto our most
true Father through Jesus Christ our Lord, the most true Physician of all our
diseases, that he will most graciously extend his blessings over it. Amen.

The end of the first Table.
This second Index contains all the Simples that are specified in this Work,
as Roots, Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, Plants, Juices, Gummes, Woods, Stones,
Barks, Metals, Minerals, and Earths: Also all the parts of Beasts, and of the
body of man, that are or may be used in Physic.
A.
ABrecockes or Peaches, are called in Latin Mala armeniaca, Mala praecocia,
and Bericocia: others do call them mala trecacina, and the common sort name them
Chrysomela, but this is the right and true Latin name of the Orange: it is a
fruit sufficiently known, and growing in this our country. Adders tongue, is
called of Pliny Lingua, and Lingulaca, of the Herbarists Echioglossum,
Ophioglossum, Lingua viperina, Lingua serpentina, and Lingua vulneraria. This
herb is to be gathered only in April and in May, it grows in moist meadows
and low grounds, and that at no other time than in the abouesaid months. It is
used in vulnerall potions, oiles and salues. Alecost, or Indish pepper, in
latin Lepidium, Piperitis. Alehoofe, or (as some say) Harehoofe, is called in
Greek and in Latin Chamaecissus, Selinitis, Hedera humilis, and Corona
terrae, by the Herbarists Hedera pluuiatilis, and by the Apothecaries Hedera
terrestris. Allium alpinum, it is also called Allium reticulatum, Victorialis,
and Victorialis longa, to distinguish it from Gladiolus segetalis, which by
diverse authors is called Victorialis rotunda, although in very deed they
differ greatly. The leaf of this herb is not much unlike to that of
Neesewort, the root is long and hairie, twisted together, as if it had been
done of purpose with the hand, whereof two of them are laid cross one over
another, as the legs of man or woman otherwhiles are placed. This root do
the cosening Merchants (I mean the Mountibanks and Quacksaluers) sell for the
right Mandragora or Mandrake, saying, that they have dug it up under the
gallows with great hazard of their lives: thus do they beguile and seduce the
common sort of men with untruths, which ought by the Magistrates to be severely
punished, and not for a small piece of silver to be permitted, otherwise I
fear they shall be called to an account for it, when it shall be said, Read
rationem villicationis tuae. Alum, Alumen, Alumen liquidum, Alumen liparinum,
Alumen rubeum, the Apothecaries do call it Alumen de Rocha. Amber, in Latin
Ambarum, Ambar, Ampar, Succinum orientale, and at the Apothecaries Ambra, it is
a precious liquor, or a kind of sweet smelling earth. Amethyst, Amethystus, a
precious stone. Ammie, Ameos, Ammium, Ammi, Cuminum regiu^ Hippocratis, Cuminum
Alexandrinum and Cuminum Aethiopicum, it is a kind of plant which bears a
sharp and sweet seed, which the Apothecaris do call Ameos. Anacardus or
Anacardium, is a strange fruit so called. Angelica, is called by diverse and
sundry names, for that there be diverse sorts of it, as Hippiatricis, Lasaron
Gallaticon, in Greek Laser Gallicum, Laserpitium Gallicum, and of the
Herbarists Imperatoria, Ostrutium and Astrutium, the Apothecaries do call it
Astrantia and Magistrantia. Anthora, is called of Paulus Aegineta, Arnabo, and
of the Arabian writers Zurumbet, of the Simplicists Zurumbetum: It is a sweet
smelling root like to Ginger, but it is bitter in taste. It is commonly called
Zedoaria, but unjustly: for there is no small difference between Zurumbet that
is Anthora and Zedoaria of the Arabians, as manifestly appears by the words
of Auicen and Serapio, who do write of these two in sundry chapters severally:
wherefore the Zedoaria of the Arabians is not our Anthora, although that it
has been falsely used in many compositions for it, but it is the root of
Zeduarie. Anthora is an herb, not much unlike the lesser Wolfs bane, but that
it grows somewhat higher, and the flowers are a little less and yellow. It
has two black roots round like unto an Olive, blackish without, and as it
were withered; within white and solid. It grows in great quantity on the
hills in Sauoy. and about Geneua, also about Salmes in high Burgundy, and on the
hills of Switserland. The latter Greek writers call it Zadura, Zaduaria,
Zedura, Zudar, Zaduara. Zadur, Zadera, Zaduar, and Zadar: Serapio calls it
Zedoaria, Auicen Zeduar, Gieduar and Napellus Moysi. The Simplicists name it
Anthora, Antithora, and Anthullia: wherefore whenever you shall find Zurumbet
in any composition, then be sure to take Anthora; but if you read Zedoaria,
then take Doronicum. Antimony, in Greek Stibi, Stibium, or Stimmi, of Galen
Gynacium, and of Pliny Platiophthalmon: it is called at the Apothecaries by
the barbarous name Antimonium. Pliny also calls it Alabastrum, which name is
proper only to Alabaster; it is a mineral like to lead, and known of all
men. Argentine, Argemone altera, Inguinaria Plinij, Anserina, Argentina,
Tenacetum syluestre, Agrimonia syluestris, Potentilla, and Portentilla. This
herb is sufficiently known, and much used for all pains and gripings in the
belly which are without any binding. Aristologie the round, vide Hartwort.
Aromaticall wine, is a wine made with spice, and a kind of Hipocras,
Aromatites. Hippocras is called in latin Vinum Hippocraticum: the Claret wine
Clarea, vinum Claretum, and at the Apothecaries Claretum. Artichocks, are
called in Greek and in Latin Scolymus, Cinara, Cinarus, Acantha, Cactus,
Carduus Altilis, Strobilus, Carchofilus, Articocalus and Articoca. Ars smart,
in Greek and in Latin Hydropiper, Piper aquaticum, Piper caninum, Herba
pauonis, Pauonaria and Persicaria, of Hippocrates, Polycraton or Polycriton. It
is a well known and contemned herb, but very good for wounds; it is hot and
dry. The other kind, which by the unskillful without any regard is used for
the true Ars smart, is somewhat bigger, and has bluish spots on the leaves,
it is also something colder and drier by nature than the former, and it is
called Persicaria mayor, and Persicaria maculata, and of Pliny Plumbago, and
Molybdaena. The first sort is the right Arse smart, which is is not only used
in wounds, but also for the Pyles, and the juice of it for the worms.
Asarabacca, Asarum, Nardus rustica, Vulgago, and as some say Vuluago: the
Apothecaries call it Asarum, and some Asara baccara. Ash tree, in Greek and in
Latin Melia, and Fraxinus, it is a common and well known tree. Azure stone,
Cyanon, in Latin Lapis Cyaneus, Lapis caeruleus, and Lapis stellatus, at the
Apothecaries Lapis lazuli. Auence, or herb Bennet, Gariophyllata, Auantia,
Sanamunda, Oculus leporis, and of Pliny Geum. Axungia vehicularis, or Vnguentum
vehiculare, is a composition of Tar and Tallow that country men do use to
grease their Cart wheels withal, it is used for Ruptures or Hernies.
B.
BAcon, is called of Pliny in Latin Lardum, and of Plautus Laridum. Badger,
Meles, Taxus, Tassus, Taxo, it is a well known beast. Barbery tree, in Greek
and Latin Oxyacantha Galeni, Crespinus, and at the Apothecaries Berberus and
Berberis. Barley, in Greek and Latin Crithe and Hordeum. Bay tree, in Greek
Daphne, in Latin Laurus. There are two sorts of Baies, the male and female
kind. The female is the common Bay tree which bears the berry: the male is
altogether like to the former, but that it bears no berries: the female is
called of Pliny Laurus baccalia, and of the Herbarists Laurus foemina, Laurus
baccifera, and Laurus foecunda. The male is called Laurus mas, and Laurus
sterilis. Both kinds are planted in gardens with us. Baulme, Melissophyllon,
Meliphyllon, Melittaeum, and Melittaena, in Latin Apiastrum, Citrago, and
Citraria, of the herbarists Citronella, Melifolium, and Cedronella, at the
Apothecaries Melissa. Nicolaus Myrepsus calls it in Greek Melissochortum,
that is, Herba apum. Our Baulme undoubtedly is the right Melissophyllum of the
ancient Physicians, although diverse will gainesay it, for both in form,
virtues and operation do they agree. There be also two kinds of this herb,
the one which is common and daily used, of the which in this place we speak.
The other has long and iagged leaves, and brown flowers, and it bears the
smell of a strong and odoriferous Limon, and it is called Melissa cretica, and
Melissa Turcica, to distinguish it from the other: both kinds are in use.
Bearefoot, Acanthus seu Acantha, Herba Topiaria, Herpacantha, Poederos, or
Poederotes, Melamphyllon, of the Simplicists Branca Vrsina Italica, to sever it
from our common Bearefoote, which is the right Spondylium of our auncesters.
The wild Bearefoote or Acanthus is very common every where in Germany, it
grows willingly in low and moist meadows, and is there called of the common
people Graskol. It is there ordinarily used in the pot amongst other potherbs.
Dioscorides calls it Acanthus syluestris, the Simplicists call it Carduus
pratensis, and Brassica pratensis. Beer, Ceruisia, Zythum. Beetes are called
of the Grecians Teutlon, Teutlis and Seutlon, of the Latinists Beta, and at the
Apothecaries Cicla. There are two kinds of it, the white and red Beetes: the
white Beetes are called Beta candida, and Beta sicula, whence the barbarous
names Cicla and Sicla first began. The red Beetes are called Beta rubra, in
English red Beetes, of which there are also another sort with a dark red
colored leaf, called Beta nigra. The white is used in Physic, and the other
in the kitchen. Beestings, in Greek Trophalis, in Latin Colostrum and
Colostra. Behen or Ben, are two roots, the white and the red, they are
seldom used severally. The white is known of all Simplicistes, and it is
called Cardianthemon, of Dioscorides Ocymastrum, we know no other name for it
but Behen or white Ben. The other sort which is brought unto us from foreign
countries, is called the red Behen, and but little accounted of with us. Some
do use the roots of Tormentill or of Pimpernell for it, and that indeed not
amiss, for that the roots of the red Ben is both without smell and taste, and
also uncertain. Benzoine, Benioninum, Belzoinum, Benzoinum, and Benzuinum, is
a sweet smelling juice, which is called at the Apothecaries Asa dulcis, it is
very seldom used alone, but is always used in compositions, whether it be be
fuming candles or soap balls. Berill, Berillus or Beryllus, it is a precious
stone pale green colored. There is another kind of it that is somewhat
yellowish, and is called Chrysoberillus, that is, a yellow Berill. The Berill
is used for all infirmities of the heart, being mixed with other things.
Betony, in Greek and Latin Cestron, Psychotrophon, Betonica, Vetonica,
Serratula, and Scribonius does call it Hierabotane, that is, Sacra herba,
otherwise is Verueine called Hierabotane. Beuercod, Castoreum. Biscuit, Panis
nauticus, Biscoctus, Bucellatum, Dipyrites Hippocrati, it is a bread twice
baked. Birdlime, in Greek Cleos, in Latin Viscus or Viscum, Gluten auiarium,
and Gluten aucupum. Bistorta, in Greek and Latin Bretanica, Britannica, of
the Herbarists Serpentaria rubra, Bistorta, and at the Apothecaries Serpentaria
or Colubrina. Blackberry bush, or Brier: Batus, Rubus, Morus Vaticana. The
fruit of this shrub is called the Blackberry, in Greek and latin Mora bati,
Mora rubi. Blites, in latin Blitum, of the Herbarists Beta insipida, and Beta
fatua. There be four kinds of it: the first is the common Blites, and known
by that name Blitum, Blitum album. The second kind has red leaves, and is well
known and common in every garden, called red Blites: the Simplicists do call it
Blitum rubrum and Olus rubrum. The third grows on every dunghill, it is much
less, and is called wild Blites. The fourth kind is brought unto us from
foreign countries, but now it is common in all gardens, and it is called
Hungarian or Indian Blites, the Herbarists do call it Blitum Indicum, Blitum
Vngaricum, and Blitum Topiarium. The common Blites shall be used in all
compositions, to wit, where blites is named without any addition. Borrage, or
Burrage, Buglossum, Euphrosynum, Nepenthes, Borago, Lingua bonis, lingua
bubula, and Corago. Borras, Chrysocolla factitia, and at the Apothecaries
Borax. There is another kind of Chrysocolla, which the Goldsmiths were wont to
use in soddering, this is called of the Grecians Chrysocolla, and in latin
Auriglutinum, Gluten auri, and Chrysocolla natiua, but that is not taken
inwardly as the common Borras is. Bran, Furfur, Ca tabrum. Brimstone, in latin
Sulfer, Sulphur: there are two kinds of it, the one as it is dug out of the
mine, which is called Sulfer vife, in Greek Theon Apyron, and in latin
Sulphurignem non expertum, and Sulphur viuum. The other kind is the common
Sulphur or dead Sulphur, in Greek Theon pepyromenon, in latin Sulphur ignem
expertum, Sulphur factitium, and Sulphur mortuum: but whenever Sulphur or
brimstone is found in any composition, then shall thou understand Sulphur vife.
Bryonie, in Greek Ampelos Leuce, Bryonia Leuce, Psilothium, Ophyostaphilos,
Melotrum, Archisostris, Cedrostis; Hippocrates calls it Echetrosis; Pliny,
Madon. In latin Bryonia, Vitis alba, and Bryonia alba, Vua serpentina, Vua
ang^tina, Rorastrum, of Apuleius, Dentaria and Apiastellum in the Arabian
tongue Alphesera and Fescera. The other kind is called the black Brionie, but
it is not so common with us as the white: the leaves of this are not much
unlike to the long Hartwort leaves, but they are somewhat longer and tenderer,
fashioned like a Heart: it runs up into the hedges like ye white. This black
Brionie is called of Dioscorides Ampelos melaena, Chironios ampelos, Bucranium,
and Pliny calls it Cynacanthe. In Latin Bryonia nigra, Vitis nigra, Vitis
Chironia, Batanuta, Betisalca, and of Pliny Apronia. The Herbarists call it
Tamarus, Taminus, Tamus, and Vua taminia, the Arabians Alfesiresin, and
Fesiresin, yet it is altogether unknown to our Physicians and Apothecaries. It
grows very much about Lauterberge in the woods and hedges thereabout.
Whenever thou do find Briony in any composition without any addition, then
shall thou understand the white Bryony only. Broom, is altogether unknown to
the Grecians, Pliny calls it Genista, at the Apothecaries Genesta and
Genestra. The Simplicists call it Spartium scoparium, and Genesta scoparia, for
a difference of the spanish broom which Dioscorides calls Spartium. Bucke,
Hircus, of this beast are many things and parts used in physic. Buffle,
Bubalus. Buglosse, Oxetoong, Land de beuf, in Latin and Greek Buglossa,
Buglossum, Lingua bouis, Lingua bubula, the Greeks do also call it
Euphrosinon, or Nepenthes: these are the true names of the Buglosse of the
ancient Physicians. The herbs that now a days are called Buglosses, are in
number 8. whereof three are tame or garden Buglosses, and five wild. The first
kind is called the Spanish Buglosse, which is the true Buglosse of Dioscorides,
as every one does acknowledge that compares it with the description, the
Simplicists call it Spanish Buglos, Buglossum sempervirens, and Mesues calls
it Buglossa domestica. The second kind is called Burrage, Borago and Corago,
it is both common and well known. Many do take this to be the right Buglosse,
but indeed the former is to be taken for the right. The third is our small
Oxetoong, or Lang de beuf, which the Apothecaries do daily use, and is called
the lesser Buglosse, and of the Herbariffs Buglossa minor, Buglossa
officinarum. The fourth kind of Buglos, although with us it be planted in
gardens, yet notwithstanding it is a wild Buglosse, for by Merburge in
Lottering, and also in France it grows very common in every field. It is
called the greater Buglosse, Italian Buglosse, Buglossum Italicum, Buglossum
Gallicum, and at the Apothecaries Buglossa mayor, Mesues does call it Buglossa
syluestris, and other will make a kind of Echium of it. The first kind (and
the second among the wild Buglosses) grows not above one foot in height, it
bears a purple flower admixed with blew, it is commonly found in woods, and
in sandy grounds: it is both in smell and taste like the lesser Buglosse, and is
called also the lesser wild Buglosse. The Simplicists call this fifth kind of
Buglosse Buglossa syluatica, lingua Ouina, and Cynoglossa minor. The sixth kind
(and the third wild Oxetoong) grows not above a spanne and a half in height,
it is very sharp and pricking, it bears a light blew flower, it is found in
gardens, and in other well tilled places of it self: the Herbarists call it
Buglossum Echiotes, and Buglossu^ syluestre spinosum. The seventh buglosse (and
the fourth among the wild ones) is also commonly so called, it grows every
where by the high way sides, and dry places, it is well known to every man
under the name of Buglosse, it is called in Greek and latin Echium,
Alcibiacum, and of Aegineta Alcibiadium and Dorias, of the simplicists
Buglossum viperinum, and Buglossum syluestre. The eight kind and fifth wild
buglosse, is called red Buglosse, because it has red roots, it is called in
Greek and latin Anchusa, but Matthias Syluaticus does call it Lactuca asinin,
the Herbarists call it Buglossa rubra, and the Apothecaries Alcanna, but Alcanna
is other whiles taken for Ligustrum. The first six kinds of of tame and wild
Buglosses are moist, and meetly warm, in time of need they may be used one
for another. Bull, Taurus. Burre the greater, in Greek Prosopis, Prosopium, in
Latin Acrium, Personata, Personatia, Bardana, and at the Apothecaries Lappa
mayor. Butchers Broom, or Kneeholme, in Greek Oxymyrsine, Myrsine Agria,
Myrtacantha, Myacantha, Schinchus, Scingus, Catangelos, Gyrenia, Ocneron, Cine,
and Chamaemyrtus. In Latin Myrtus syluestris, Myrtus Aculeata, Myrtus
acuminata, Myrtus humilis, Myrtus terrestris, Genitura Herculis, Ruscus, and
Spina murina, the Herbarists do call it Spina vespertilionis, Palma murina, the
Apothecaries Bruscus, and Dioscorides Hiera myrtus, that is sacra myrtus. This
Butchers broom is only planted in gardens in Germany, although his roots and
red berries be daily used of the Apothecaries. In France it grows very common
in diverse places, to wit, about Orliens and Montargy.
C.
CAbbage, or Coleworts, a Cabbage is called in Greek Crambe, Cephalote, and
Nicander does call it Gaster: In Latin Caulis imperialis, Brassica capitata,
Brassica tritiana, Caulis capitatus, Caulis albus, Brassica alba, and the
Apothecaries name it Caputium: this is most common of all other kinds of
Coleworts, we call it a Cabbage. The other sort of Cabbages is called of Pliny
Lacuturris, and of the Simplicists Brassica lacuturria, or Brassica sabaudica,
of some Sauoy Coleworts. The third kind is called the red Cabbage, in Greek
Caulodes, in Latin Brassica cumana, Brassica leuis, and Brassica rubra. The
fourth sort is named crisped, or crumpled Coleworts, this is much sweeter than
any of the rest, and it has crumpled or wrinkled leaves, like to the headed
Lettice, for which cause it is called in Dutch Lattoucoole, that is, Lettice
Coleworts, and by Pliny Brassica sabellica, and by the Herbarists Brassica
crispa mayor, and Brassica dulcis. The fifth sort is the lesser crumpled
cabbage, in Greek Selinoides or Selinusia, and by Athenaeus Brassica crispa
minor, Brassica Apiana, and Caulis crispus minor. The sixth kind is the common
Coleworts, and is also used in physic, it is called Crambe, Caulis, or
Brassica without any addition. The seventh sort is the caulyflorie or flowered
Cabbage, Pliny calls it Brassica Pompeiana, and the Simplicists Brassica
cypriana, and Florecaulis. The eight kind is called Rapecole, or Rapocaulis,
but this sort was altogether unknown to our predecessors. Calamine is the oar
of brass, Cadmia, Cadmia fossilis, Cadmia natiua, for a difference of Cadmia
factitia, or Tuttie, Pliny names it Lapidem aerosum, the Apothecaries
barberously call it Climiam, Cathimiam, and Lapidem Calaminarem, and those that
work in mines name it Cobaltum. This mineral stone is much used amongst
Chirurgians, and is the very best of all the sorts of Cadmia, as Galen
witnesses. Calcedonie, Calcedonius is a precious stone, and a kind of Onyx.
Calmus was by the ancient Physicians called Acorus: some do take the great
Galingal for it, and although the same be not the right Acorus, yet is their
error more tolerable than of those that use the Ireas root in stead of
Calmus. Calmus Aromaticus, is the right Calmus of the ancient Physicians, and
it is called Acorus and Piperatum: but the right Calamus Aromaticus is a sweet
smelling reed, which is never brought unto us, and therefore we do use Acorus,
that is Calmus, which does now supply the place both of Calmus and of Calmus
Aromaticus. Camelina is called of Dioscorides Myagrum, of Theophrastus
Erysimum, of Herbarists Camelina, of the Apothecaries Sesamum. And although it
be not the right Sesamum of the ancient Physicians, yet doubtless it may
safely be used in stead thereof, because as yet the right Sesamum is not
known. It has power to warm reasonably, and to ease all manner of pain:
wherefore it is much better to use a thing in place of the true Sesamum which
is well known, than a thing altogether unknown and uncertain. Camel,
Camelus. Cammomils, in Greek and Latin Chameamelum, Anthemis, Leucanthemis,
and Leucanthemum, the Apothecaries do call it Chamemilla and Camomilla.
Chamemils are hot and dry in the first degree. Campher, Caphora, Camphora, in
Latin and in Greek Caphura: it is a strong smelling juice or sap of a tree in
Indie: it is cold and dry in the third degree, and it is much used in
physic. There is yet another kind of Campher, which is a kind of mineral or
of Amber, called Campher of the mine, that is hot and dry by nature. This kind
of Campher is altogether unknown to the Physicians, for which cause also it is
not in use. Canker, in latin and Greek Carcinoma, Carcinus and Cancer, a
virulent and corroding ulcer. Canterbury bells, in latin Smilax leuis,
Volubilis, Campanula, Conuoluulus, Campanella, Sandulaca, Coniugulum Catonis,
and Funis arborum. This herb is known every where. Capers, in Greek and
latin Capparis and Iuturis. Capon, Capus, Capo, and Gallus spado. Caraway, in
Greek and latin Carum: Aetius calls it Careum, Carium: Simeon terms it
Carnabadium: others call it Caroum and Careosemen: the Apothecaries call it
Carui: and Athenaeus Pistinaca mayor. Carbuncle, in Greek and in Latin
Anthracites, and Ca^bunculus. Carduus benedictus, Atractylis hirsuta, Carduus
sanctus, and Carduus Benedictus. Carpe, in Greek and in Latin Cyprinus, Carpo,
and Carpio: Erasmus does call it Carpa. Carot, Carota, Pastinaca Rubra. Cassie
canes or pipes, in Latin and in Greek Cassia, Casia, Cassia fistularis,
Siliqua Aegyptia, and Cassia Carthartica. Cassie wood, look for Cassialignea,
or Xylocassia in the Latin Table. Caterpillars, in Greek and in latin Camp,
Eruca and Brachus: some men do call them Erucula: they are worms sufficiently
known, that eat and spoil all green herbs, as Cabbages, leaves of hedges
and trees. They that live on the Pine trees and Fur trees are called in
latin Erucae Pinorum, and Erucae Picearum, in Greek Pityocampe. Cats Mints,
field Mints, wild Penniroyall, Calamintha agrestis, or Aruensis, and Pulegium
agreste. Of Mesua, Calamintha domestica, Calamintha felina, and Cattaria.
Celendine, in Greek and latin Chelidonium m^ius, Cratea, Philomedium,
Othonium, Radix Pandio^i t^^^ubium, Fabium, and of the Alchimists Celidonium,
of Serapio Cauroch, Curcuma, and of the Apothecaries Celidonia. It is an herb
common and well known: the Simplicists do call it Herba hirundinaria mayor.
The second kind is called the lesser Celendine, Pilewort, or Figwort: in
Greek and in Latin Chelidonium minus, and Triticum syluestre, of the
Herbarists Herba hirundinaria minor, Testiculus Sacerdotis, Scrophularia, or
Scrofularia, and at the Apothecaries Celidonia minor. The former kind is
always understood if it be without any addition. Centorie, in Greek and
latin Centaurium minus, Lymnesium, Lymnaeum, Libadium, febrifuga, and
Fel^errae. Ceruse, in Greek and latin Psymmithium, Cerussa. Ceterach both
great and small. The lesser Ceterach is called in Greek and in latin
Scolopendrion, Hemionion, Asplenium, of Scribonius Largus, Calcifraga, of the
Herbarists Scolopendria vera, and Scolopendria minor, Splenium, Asplenium and
Ceterachum. The Apothecaries do call it Ceterach as the Arabians do: it is the
true Scolopendrium of the ancients: Theodorus Gaza calls it Mula, or Herba
Mula. Our unskillful Physicians and Apothecaries do use the Hearts tongue
Phyllitis, for the true Scolopendrium without any regard or care. If Rosemary
were not so common, they would take the Juniper tree for it, and Nettles for
Marierom: wherefore it is a great grace that old women do so well know the
herbs, otherwise they would often be deceived, seeing their whole trust and
credit relieth on the Herb wives. The other kind of Ceterach is also called
Hearts tongue, of Dioscorides Lonchitis altera, of the Simplicists Scolopendrium
maius, Scolopendria mayor, Asplenium, Asplenium maius, Spicantum,
Scolopendrium, or Asplenium syluestre, because it grows in dark and moist
places. Both these herbs do take their names of the worm Scolopendra, which
is called an Earwig, or woorme with many legs, because the leaves seem to be
noted with it. Both these herbs have the same operation, for they are both hot
in the first, and dry in the second degree: they are the best spleneticall
herbs that are to be found, for they are good for all maladies of the spleen.
Chaste tree is called in Greek and in latin Amictomiaenum, Agnos, Lygus,
Agonus, Tridactylum, Lecristicum, Vitex, and Salix Armerina: of the Herbarists
Piper Agrestis, Piper Monachorum, Arbor casta, and of the Apothecaries Agnus
castus. There are two kinds of it, to wit, the greater and the lesser Chaste
tree. The great grows in height like the Willow tree, and has also leaves
most like it, it smells very pleasantly, the flowers are white and purple
colored. The other kind has altogether purple flowers, it is fuller of
branches, has whiter leaves, and is much less than the former. Charuill,
Caerephyllon and Cherefolium, and of the common Physicians and Apothecaries
Cerefolium. Chestnut tree, Castanea, Glans Sardiana, Iouis glans: the fruit is
called Nux Castanea: there are diverse kinds of them that are not needful to be
rehearsed at this present. Cherries, Cerasa, there are two kinds of them,
sweet and sower, and each of them may be subdeuided into more kinds. The hard,
sweet, and great Cherries are in some places called Spanish Cherries, and in
latin Cerasa duracina, or Pliniana, they have a very sweet and pleasant
taste: amongst these are the white Cherries also comprehended. The common red
Cherries are called Cerasa Mellea, for their great and pleasant sweetness. The
red and sweet Cherries that leave a bitterness in the mouth behind have first
bin graffed on a Bay tree, whence they as yet do keep their bitterness, and are
called Cerasa Amarella, and Laurea. The black tame Cherries are called Cerasa
actia, Actiana, Caeciliana, and Cessiana. The little wild and black Cherries
are comprehended under the Actiana: and in like sort also the little wild and
red, under the great red and domestical or tame Cherries. Of the sower
Cherries there be two sorts, to wit, white and red; the red are called
Aproniana cerasa: others call them Iuliana, and Aquea. The black are named
Cerasa Amarina, and Amarena: but amongst all kinds of Cherries, are the wild
black, the red, and the domestical black Cherries used most in Physic, and
above all other those black ones that are called Amarena. Wherefore if one
find the name of Cherries in any receipt without any addition, then are the
black Cherries or Amarena to be understood and taken for it. Chickweeds, in
Greek and Latin Alsine, at the Apothecaries Morsus Gallinae, of the
Herbarists Pabulum anserinum, and Pauerina. This herb is cold and moist.
Cichelings, in Greek and latin Lathyrus, and of Pliny, Cicercula: they are
white four square Peason, sufficiently known of every man. Cichorie or
Suckerie, in Latin and Greek Picris, Chreston, Cichorium, Pancratium,
Troximum, Intybus or Intubus erraticus, Cichorium agreste, Seris syluestris,
Amarago, Cicorea, Ambubeia, and of Celsus Ambugia, of Pliny Cichorea, and of
the Arabians Taraxacon and Altaraxacon. Of the other kind of Intybus look in
E. for Endive: Galen calls all these kinds of Cicories and Endiues
Intybolachana, that is, Intybacea olera. Cinnamom, in Greek and Latin
Cinamomum, Cinnamomum, and Cinnamum: it is a sweet smelling bark, and a well
known spice: it is also called Canella. It is hot and dry in the third
degree. Cinquefoile, in Greek and latin Pentaphyllon, Pentapetes, Chamazelon,
Pentafolium, and Quinquefolium. Ciper roots, or wild Galingall, in Greek and
latin Cyperus, Erysisceptrum, Cyprius, Iuncus quadratus, it is called of
Celsus and Pliny Iuncus angulosus, Iuncus triangulus. There are two kinds of
it, the one has a round root, and is called Cyperus ro^ungus: the other a
long root called Cyperus longus. Cipresse tree, Cupressus, Cyparissus. Citron
tree, malus Cipria, medica or Persica malus. Citrons, in Greek and Latin
Cidromelum, Cochimelon, Malum curium, Malum medicum, Malum citraeum, Malum
assyrium, Malum Hesperium, and Malum curinatum, and at the Apothecaries
Citrinatum. Citrull, Citrullus. Clarie is called of the Herbarists in Latin
Oruala, Orualla, Sclarea, Scarlea, Matrisaluia, Galli crista, Totabona, and
Herba sancti Iohannis, at the Apothecaries Gallitricum, and Centrum Galli: it
is a kind of Orminum or Horminum, although it be neither of them that
Dioscorides does write of, yet may it by reason of his similitude, properties
and virtues be used either with or for Horminum. The other kind of Clary is the
wild Clary, that grows every where in the fields, it has deep iagged leaves
with a blew purple flower, and is called Scarlea syluestris, or Sclarea
syluestris, and Gallitricum syluestre. But whenever Clary is prescribed, then
ought the garden Clary to be used. Clauers, look in T. for Three leafed
grass. Clay, Argilla: M. Cicero calls it Terra sigillaria, Columella, Terra
figularis. This Clay is used in this book for the bleeding at the nose.
Cloves, in Greek Caryophyllum, at the Apothecaries Cariofilus or Gariofilus.
Cock, Gallus Gallinaceus. Cockle, vide Cornerose. Codwort, in Greek and
Latin Bubonium, Asterium, Aster Atticus, Asteriscus, Hyophthalmus, Herba
inguinalis, and Inguinaria, of the Herbarists Stella Attica, Oculus suis, and
Alibium. There be four kinds of it, to wit, the first with the blew flower,
which is commonly known by the name of Codwort. Some Simplicists do call it
for a difference Bubonium caeruleum. The second is almost like the former, but
that the leaves and the flowers be somewhat bigger, and the flowers yellow, and
starwise like the blew: this grows by the river of Rhene. The Herbarists
term it Bubonium luteum, and Inguinaria lutea. The third kind grows on dry
hills, whereof the leaves are less, double, wrinkled, and bended almost like a
half moon, the flowers are very yellow, and less than the aforesaid: the
Simplicists call it Bubonium lunatum. The fourth kind has long and picked
leaves, with three or four sinews, like to the lesser Plantaine, and has a
fair starlike flower, yellow every where, and every flower has six small
leaves under it, placed also like a star. This kind did we first get from
Marselles, for which cause it is now called Bubonium Massilioticum, and Stella
Massiliotica: but when and wheresoever Codwort is named with any addition,
there is always the common Codwort with the blew flower to be understood. This
may also be called Ramicaria, or Rupture weed, because it is especial good
for the Rupture. Coloquint, in Greek and latin Colocynthis, Sicyona,
Cucurbita syluestris, Cucurbita syluatica, and Cucurbitula. Conie, in Greek
Dasipus, of Polybius and Galen Cunilus, in latin Cuniculus: it is a well
known beast in all countries. Copper is called in greek Chalcos, in latin
Aes, Aes Cyprium, Cuprum. Coriander, in greek and latin Corianon, Corion, and
Coriandrum. Cork tree, in greek Phellus, and of Theophrastus Ipsos, and of
Theocritus Scoliastes, Auarica, in latin Suber. It is a kind of Oak, and very
common in Italy, they have a thick rind or bark, of the which our Cork is
made. Cornerose or Cockle, in Greek Lychnis agria, in latin Lychnis
syluestris, of the Simplicists Caryophyllus aruensis, Pseudomelanthium, Githago
and Nigestrum: Dioscorides calls it Atocium, Hieracopodium, Tragonatum,
Lampada, and Semura: some unskillful Physicians and Apothecaries have used this
herb for the Melanthium or Nigella of the ancients, the which error diverse
Apothecaries and fond fellows have so imbibed, that they will rather follow
their own foolish opinions, than be better instructed of others. Coral, in
greek and latin Coralium, Corallium, Gorgonia, Lithodendron, Dentrites and
Eurallium. Costus roots, Costum and Costus: of this root there be two kinds,
to wit, the bitter and the sweet Costus roots. The bitter root is always
used for the Costus without any addition. Coutsenille, in greek and in latin
Coccos baphica, of Pausanias, Hysge, Coccum infectorium, Coccum tinctorium,
Granum infectorium: in the Arabian tongue Kermes and Chermes. The Silk diers
for a difference of the crimson color, have named it Kermesinum granum, for
the crimson color and Kermes of the Arabians is not one and the selfsame. The
Coutsenille is called Kermesinum, by reason of her brave color, which is
somewhat like unto scarlet. Also the crimson color called Kermesinum, is taken
from the roots of certain herbs, and it is an external thing from the roots,
although it grow with them, for it is found to grow on the barks of certain
trees, and has no virtue or use in physic at al, as the Coutsenille does,
which is the natural fruit of a little tree, not unlike to our Butchers
broom, but that it is somewhat less, with fewer leaves and fruits: wherefore
they do err greatly that take the crimson color Kermesinum for the
Coutsenille, and use it for the same in their compositions and medicaments. But
the Apothecaries do err more grossly that do use the Gooseberries in stead of
the Coutsenille, and (that which is worse) the unskillful Physicians do bear
with it, and let it pass for good, so that it may well be said of them, that
one blind man leads another: but woe be to the patient, for he ought not to
be iested withal, seeing the Coutsenille is not used but in extreme debilitie
of the heart, for which neither the crimson color, nor the Gooseberry has any
virtue at all. The Coutsenille is also used of women with child for to comfort
and strengthen the child in their bodies, and to prevent all mischances, for
the which it is very meet and requisite. The Gooseberry is of a quite contrary
nature. Cowslips, Cowslops, of some Ladykeyes, or Primroses, in Greek Phlomis,
Arthritica, in latin Verbasculum, the Herbarists do call it Herba paralysis,
Primula veriflora, Primula veris, Bracha cuculi, and Herba primi floris; and at
the Apothecaries Athretica, and Betonica alba, the which is indeed the right
white Betony. There are three kinds of them: the first kind are the common
Cowslops with the yellow flowers, that grow every where in dry meadows, and
on grassie hills: these are called of the Herbarists Verbasculum odoratum, by
reason of their pleasant smell. The second kind grows in the wooddes, and is
much bigger than the common Cowslops, it has a pale yellow color, but without
any smell at all, and it is called Verbasculum syluestre, and Verbasculum
album; and when this kind is set in gardens, it grows as big again as
before. The third kind are the double Cowslops, that are set in gardens, and
they are much fairer, greater, and more pleasant than the common, and are
called Verbasculum multiplex. Creuets, in Greek and in Latin Astacus
fluuiatilis, Cammarus, Gammarus: it is a kind of shell fish very common and
well known. This fish is now a days of diverse learned men called Cancer
unjustly, for that there be no Cancri in Germany; for the true Cancri have no
tail as our Creuets have, which are in all points like to the Lobsters, but
that they are much less. Crabs or wild Apples, Malum syluestre, or Pomum
syluestre: they and their leaves are used for the laske. Cresses, in Greek and
Latin Cardamum, Nasturtium hortense, and of the common Herbarists Cressio.
Cricket, Grillus, a little worm very common in all brew houses. Cristall,
Chrystallus and Chrystallum. Crowfoot, in Greek Batrachion and Batrachis, in
Latin Ranunculus, Herba Sardonia, Herba scelerata, Strumea, and Herba Strumea,
at the Apothecaries Flammula, and Pes Corui. Pliny calls the double
Crowfoote Polyanthemum, it is called here Batchelers buttons, and of the
Simplicists Ranunculus multiplex. There are diverse kinds of it, but because
they are not al of them used in Physic, we will only speak of the lesser
sort, which by reason of the round root that it has it is called Ranunculus
rotundus, and at the Apothecaries Flammula, and of some (for to distinguish it
from the other sorts) Flammula minor, and Flammula rotunda: and this kind of
Crowfoote is only to be used in Physic. Cuckoe, in Greek Coccyx, in Latin
Cuculus, a bird too common and well known. Cuckobread, in greek and latin
Oxys, Oxytriphyllon, Trifolium acetosum, Panis Cuculi, and at the Apochecaries
Alleluia. Cuckopit, Priests pintle, or Wake Robin, in latin Pes vituli, virile
Sacerdotis, Serpentaria minor, and at the Apothecaries Aron. Cucubes, in Greek
Carpesium, of Actuarius, of the Arabians, and at all Apothecaries Cubeba.
Cucumber, Cucumis, Cucumer, and Cucumis, satiuus, in Greek and of
Aristophanes, Sicys and Sicuos. Cumfrey, of Dioscorides Symphytum alterum,
Symphytum maius, and Pecton, of Apuleius Pectis, Anazetesis, Haemostasis,
Consolida mayor, and Alus Gallicus, of Scribonius Inula rustica, Consolida,
Confirma mayor, Conserua mayor, and Solidago: it is a common herb, whereof
there be two sorts, the one with purple nowers, and the other with white. There
is yet a third kind called Symphytum petraeum, of Apuleius Xylophyton and
Anachylis, of the Herbarists Consolida petraea: this grows on hills and stony
places. Cumin, in Greek and Latin Cuminum, Cyminum, Cuminum satiuum, Cuminum
hortulanum, and Cuminum Romanum.
D.
DAffodill, it is called in greek and in latin Hemerocallis, Lilium
syluestre, Lilium Saracenicum, and at the Apothecaries Affodillus for
Asphodelus, but unjustly: and although it be not the true Hemerocallis that
Dioscorides describes, yet it is a kind of it, and very like it in virtues and
operation. The right Daffodill is called in Greek and Latin Asphodelus,
Hastula regia, Albucum, the flowers with the stalk Anthericos. It is now by
the diligent and expert Physicians brought into use again. Damask prunes,
Pruna Damascena. Dandelion, Priests crown, wild or yellow Cichorie, in Greek
Hedypnois, of Theophrastus Aphaca, and of the Herbarists Seris vrinaria, Herba
vrinaria, Seris somnifera, Caput Monachi, and dens Leonis. The Apothecaries and
unskillful Physicians do call it Taraxacon, and Altaraxacon, which names are
due to Plantaine, as may be seen by Serapius and the Arabians. For that which
Dioscorides calls Intybus Syluestris, that do they call Taraxacon or
Altaraxcon. This herb is cold by nature, it provoke sleep, it opens all
inward obstructions, it moves urine abundantly. Daneweede, in Greek and
Latin Chamaeacte, Ebulus, Sambucus pumila, Sambucus humilis, Sambucus
aruensis. Dates, in Greek and Latin Dactyli, Caryotae, Caryotides, and
Palmulae: sower Dates are called Tamarindi. Date tree, in greek Phoenix, and
in latin Palma. Daysies, in greek Ballis, in latin Bellis, Bellium, and
Bellius flos, by the Herbarists Pascanthemum, and Herba Arthritica, Herba
margarita, and at the Apothecaries Consolida minor. The other kind is called
Bellis mayor, Bellium maius, and of the Herbarists Chenanthemum, Consolida
media vulnerariorum. Diamond, Adamas, a well known gemme or precious stone.
Dill, Anethum, it is hot in the third, and dry in the second degree. Diptamer,
Diptamus, in Greek and latin Polemonia or Polemonium, Phyletaeria,
Chiliodynamis, Fraxinus pumila, Fraxinula, Frassinula, Fraxinella, Frassinella,
and Dictamus albus. The Apothecaries call it Diptamus, and Dictamus albus. This
plant has been taken a great while for Paeonia mascula, but it is the true
Polemonium of the ancients. Dishwasher, a little bird called Motacilla, Cauda
Tremula, and of Hesichius, Cyrillus, it is a common and well known bird.
Devils bit, Morsus Diaboli, Succissa, Iacea nigra, and Praemorsa. It is a kind
of Scabious, and is not unlike the same, only that the leaves of it be not
iagged as the Scabious leaves are. Docke, in Greek Lapathum, in latin Rumex,
and at the Apothecaries Lapatium. There are six kinds of Dockes: the first
has long piked leaves like Sorrel, but something sharper, and it is called in
Greek to distinguish it from the rest, Oxylapathum, in latin Lapathum acutum,
Lapathum acutifolium, and at the Apothecaries Lapatium acutum. The second kind
has great broad leaves, not much unlike the former, but somewhat bigger, the
Herbarists do call it Lapathum latifolium, Lapathum platiphyllon, and Lapathu^
non acuminatum, which is almost altogether in use under the name of Lapathum
acutum unjustly; but amongst the unskillful Physicians and Apothecaries a foot
or twain breaks no square: this grows in medows and other moist places. The
third kind has yet bigger, but softer or gentler leaves: it is sown in
gardens, especially in France, where they use it amongst other pot herbs in
their porredge, the roots of it are bigger than the other, somewhat yellow,
not much unlike to Rubarbe: it is called in greek Lapathon Cepaeon, in latin
Lapathum domesticum, Rumex satiuus, and by the Herbarists Rhabarbarum
monachorum, and Patientia: some do call it Lapathum latifolium satiuum, to
distinguish it from the former. The fourth kind has very great leaves, and
piked before, it grows in ponds and other waters, and is called in greek
Hydrolapathon, and Hippolapathon, in latin Lapathum equinum, Rumex equinus,
Lapathum aquaticum, Rumex aquaticus, and palustris; the Grecians do also call
it Bulapathon. The fifth kind has leaves like the first and the common Docke,
with many red spots and veins, and it is found in gardens, it is called of the
Herbarists Lapathum sanguineum, Rumex sanguineus, and Sanguis Draconis. The
sixth kind is Sorrel, whereof shall be spoken elsewhere. Doronicum, the
Arabians do call it Doronigi: it is mingled with other things that serve for
comforting of the heart. Some will affirm that it is venomous, because the
second kind of it is such, that it kills both man and beast: Wherefore if our
Doronicum be poison, then must of necessity follow that the herb Antora or
Antitora be also venomous, because the one is as like the other in leaf,
flower, and root, that the one can hardly be known from the other. But that
our Doronicum is no poison, has experience taught us many years ago. Dragons,
in greek Dracontium, Dracontea, Dracontia, Isarum, Biaru^, Iarum, Harmiagrion,
and Sigiginalium. Apuleius calls them Pythoniu^, Anchomanos, Sauchromaton,
Typhonium, Crocodilium, Therium, and Theriophonum; in latin Serpentaria,
Columbina, Colubrina, Mauriaria, Dracontea, and Collum Draconis: of the Arabian
Physicians Luf, Luph, or Alluff: the Simplicists do call it Dracunculum. There
are three kinds of Dragons, to wit, the first, which we do call the greater
Dragons, Dracontium maius, Dracunculus mayor, and Colubrina magna, thereby to
know it from the other two sorts. The second kind is somewhat less, and like
to the Cuckopit, it is called Dracontium minus, Dracunculus minor, or Colubrina
minor, and of Athenaeius, Aronia: Cordus does call it Dracunculum,
Henicophyllon, and Luph planum: the greater they call Luph Crispum. Others do
call it the lesser Dragons, that is, Serpentaria minor. The third kind grows
near the water, upon a stubbed root, with many stalks unto it, and on every
stalk one only leaf, much like to Iuie, and every stalk brings a bunch of
berries like Cukopit: it is called Dracunculus palustris, Dracunculus
aquatilis, Colubrina palustris, and Arum palustre. We call them water Dragons.
Some simple Physicians and silly Apothecaries do use the Bistorta roots for
the roots of Dragons: but what great distance is between them, what
difference in their virtues and operations, is sufficiently known to the
learned. Dragonblood, Cinnabaris Indica, Sanguis Draconis, and Lacryma
Draconis, it is the sap of a tree in the Indies called Draco. Ducke, he or she,
Anas.
E.
EArth sealed, in greek Sphragis, in latin Terra lemnia, Sigillum lemnium,
Lutum lemnium, Rubrica lemnia, Minium lemnium, Lutum sigillatum, and at the
Apothecaries Terra sigillata: This earth is maruellously falsified and
counterfeited, wherefore great heed must be had in the use of it. Our hedge
Physicians will rather use clay, than want earth in their receipts.
Earthwormes, Lumbrici, Vermes terreni, Intestina terrae. Eele, Anguilla, the
well known fish, that will not be held by the tail. Elecampane, in latin
Helenium, Enula, Enula campana, and Terminalium. Elderne, in greek Act, and
in latin Sambucus. Elm, in greek Ptelea, in latin Vlmus: there are 2. kinds
of it, the common is called Vlmus campestris. The other kind grows on hills,
and is called in greek Oriptelea, in latin of Gaza, Montiulmus, and of others
Vlmus Montana. Endive, in greek and in latin Intybus, Intybum, Intybus
satiuus, and Seris, at the Apothecaries Endiuia: it is a kind of tame Succory,
and is known at this present in every place. Endive the white, or ye lesser
Endive, in greek and latin Intybum satiuum angustifolium, Seris satiua
angustifolia, Seris satiua minor, and Seriola: the Apothecaries do call it with
a barbarous name Scariolam. Eryngus in greek and latin Eryngium, of the
Herbarists Herba pleuritica, Acus veneris, Capitulum martis, Centumcapita, and
at the Apothecaries Iringus. There are two kinds of it, the one, which is
common with us, and by the name of Eryngus sufficiently known. The other kind
has broad leaves, and is not so pricking as the former, it has also a fair
and bigger top, and a fair sky colored flower, it is planted in garde^s, it
grows otherwise at the sea side: the Simplicists call it Eryngium marinum.
Some inexpert Physicians and Apothecaries do use the star Thistle for Eryngus,
but erroniously, for it is a little Thistle, much less than the Eryngus, it
has many little heads, with purple flowers, and prickles about them standing
out like a star, it has a small root, that perishes in winter, it grows
every where in dry places. The Herbarists do call it Carduus Stellatus,
Carduus Calcifragus, Tribulus stellatus, Acanthasterion, Spinastella,
Calcitrapa, and Calcitripola: Valerius Cordus does call it Polyacantha, but it
is not the Polyacantha of Theophrastus. Others do call it Eryngium minus, that
is, the lesser Eryngus. And although this Thistle do also move urine, or
provoke the terms in women as Eryngus does, yet nevertheless it is not the
same, but it is much stronger than the Eryngus; for if one use too much of it,
then does it expel blood with the vrin: wherefore the same is duly to be
used, and in steed of Eryngus use the common Thistle, or Squilles for it:
Rondoletius does call Eryngus by the name of Coronopus. Escharbot, in greek
Cantharus, in latin Cantherius, Scarabaeus, and Pilularius.
F.
FEarne, in greek and latin Pteris, Blechron, Dasyclonon, and Filix, a well
known herb, and common in all woods and Heathes: it is called of Nicander,
Betrus. Fenegreeke, in greek Telis, Aegoceros, Ceraitis, of Pliny, Carphos, of
Theophrastus, Buceras, of Hippocrates, Epiceras; in latin Foenumgraecum, of
Pliny, Silia, of Varro, Silicula, and of the Herbarists Trifolium graecum: it
is an herb, whose seed is only in use. Fennel, Foeniculum, Maratrum, it is a
common and well known herb. Fesant, Phasianus, Fasianus, and Facidis auis, it
is a common bird, which ought to be used for meat in many diseases, as has
bin showed in diverse places of our book. Feuerfew: it is called of the
Herbarists Pseudoparthenium, Amarella, Solis oculus, Matronaria, and
Matronella, the practitioners and Apothecaries do call it Matricaria. This
Feuerfew has until this present day been taken for the true Parthenium of the
ancients, albeit that the most famous and learned Physicians Antonius Musa
Brassauolus, Leonardus Fuchsius, Guilielmus Rondoletius, and diverse others have
long since sufficiently showed, that the bitter and stinking Cammomils (of
some called dogs Cammomils) are the true Parthenium, for it is not only in all
points correspondent to the description of it, but agreeeth also in the virtues
and operations with it, and he that reads Dioscorides, is constrained to
affirm the same: wherefore it is a great wonder, that many men will be so
obstinate, that although one do show them, the truth it self, yet will they
like swine tumble in their dirt, and stick to their ungrounded opinions,
whereby they seem to seek the overthrow of all truths. The true Parthenium
are the stinking cammomils, which are called of the Herbarists Herba virginea,
Cynanthemis, Bufonaria, Aneth^m caninum, chamaemelum foetidum, and Cotula
foetida. Field berries, look Huckle berries. Field Cypres, in Greek and
Latin Chamaepitys, Abiuga, or Abiga, at the Apothecaries Iua, and Iua
arthetica, or Arthetica: of Pliny Thus terrae, of the Herbarists Herba
apoplectica, cucurbitularis, and Pinus pumila. Fig tree, Ficus. Figs, dried
figs, Ficus, ficus passae, Caricae, there are three kinds of them brought unto
us, the first are they that come in frayles, and they are the meanest: the
second kind are the leaf Figs, that are brought from Candy and Cypers, these
are fatter and better than the former. They are called leaf figs, because they
are packed and made up with Bay leaves between them. The third kind are lesser
and pleasanter than the rest, they are brought from Prouence, they are called
figs of Marselles, and these are the best of all for Physic. Figwort, the
great Scrofulary, this herb has been unknown to the ancients, and now adays
it is called of our Physicians Scrophularia or Scrofularia, and also
Millemorbia, or Castrangula. Fur tree, in Greek Elate, in Latin Abies,
there are two kinds of it, the first is the common fur tree, which of the
Simplicists is called the white fur tree, or abies candida, the second kind
of Fur tree is called in Greek Peuce, in Latin Picea, and of the Herbarists
Abies nigra, which is the red fur tree. But where thou find Fur tree in
any receipt without addition, there is the common Fur tree meant. Fitches, in
Greek Bicion, or Aracus, in Latin Vicia, there are two kinds of them, the
first is that which is known to all men by the name of Fitches, the other
kind grows of it self here and there, they are called wild fitches,
Dioscorides does call them Aphace, in Latin Vicia syluestris. But if the name
of Fitches be found without addition, then shall thou understand the first kind
of them. Our unskillful southsayers and Apothecaries do take the fitches for
the true Eruum of the ancient writers, but it is an open deceit, which ought
to be punished by the Magistrates, and to call such careless fellows in question
for their false quid pro quo. Flax, in Greek and Latin Linum, Pliny calls
all that Linum that may be spun. Fleawort, in Greek and Latin Psyllium, herba
pulicaris, pulicaria, of Pliny Cynoides, and Cynocephalon. The seed only of
this herb is used in physic, it is cold in the second, and dry in the first
degree. Flint or pible stone, in Greek Chalix, in Latin Silex. Flower deluce,
Lilium caeleste, and Iris Germanica. Although this our Flour deluce do not
agree in every respect with the Ireas of Italy, yet it is a kind of it, and
much stronger in purging, for which cause it is above all other kinds used in
the Dropsy. Folefoote, in Greek Bechium, and Chameleuce, in Latin Populago,
Tussilago, of the Herbarists Vngula caballina, and herba Diui Quirini, at ye
Apothecaries Farfara, of Theophrastus Aphylla^tes, because that it blows
without any leaus, wherefore it is also called of some filius ante patrem,
others do likewise term it populus humilis, or pumila, farfarella, farfarago.
Framboys, in Greek and Latin Batus Idaeus, Rubus Idaeus, Rubus Ceruinus,
Ceruirubus, the whole shrub is called the Framb^^^ hedge, the fruit Framboys,
mora rubi Idaei. Frankincense, in Greek and Latin Libanus, or Libanum,
Libanotis, Thus, Tus, Opolibanum, Incensum, and at the Apothecaries Olibanu^.
There are four kinds of it, the first is very white, round, and little corns
or grains, it is called in Greek Stragonias, of Pliny Thus masculum, of the
Simplicists Thus testiculatum, at the Apothecaries Olibanum testiculatum, in
english white Frankincense, and this is the best of all the kinds. The second
kind is gray, yellowish, and is that which is left after the former is picked
out, and it is only called Frankincense. The third is also used, and it is full
of barks, to which the Frankincense sticks, and it is taken from the tree:
and although it be thought unclean, yet has it his place in Physic as well
as the best. This is called Thuris cortex, Thus corticosum, and at the
Apothecaries Olibanum corticosum, in english rindes or barks of Frankincense.
The fourth kind are the relics that are left after the former three kinds
are taken out, all these kinds do come of one and the same tree: but there is
yet another contemned kind of Frankincense at the Apothecaries, and also at
the Druggists, that is not worthy to be numbered amongst the former kinds,
because it is only a deceit and knavery used in stead of good ware, wherefore
it ought by good right to be thrown out of doors. This is made of the gum of
ye Pine tree, and so prepared deceitfully, it is called Thus Adulterinum, in
English counterfeited Frankincense. Frankincense the black, Timiama, in Greek
Nascaphthum Narcaphthum, of others Thymiama and at the Apothecaries Thymiana.
It is a sweet smelling bark which is used in sweet unguents, or fuming
candles: some do call it Incensum nigrum. French Beans, Phaseolus, Phasiolus,
Dolicus, Phaselus. Frogge, Rana. Fumitory, in Greek and Latin Capnos fumaria,
and Fumus terrae, the Herbarists call it Cerifolium felinum, and Columbinum. It
is a well known herb, and is hot and dry in the third degree.
G.
GAdrise tree, a tree called in Greek and Latin Crania, Cornus. Galingall,
Cyprus Babylonius, and Galanga, a well known spice, whereof there be two
kinds, to wit, the great and the lesser, but the lesser is the true Galingall,
and is to be used in stead thereof, but the great is called Galanga mayor. This
is used of some for the true Acorus, that is Calmus: but they err greatly, for
Acorus is our common Calmus, as has been showed elsewhere. Galls, Galla, they
that grow on our Oaks are altogether unmeet for Physic, they are called of
Galen Onicicidae, that is, asininae gallae. Garlic, in Greek Scorodon, and in
Latin Allium. Gillowfloures, are called of the Herbarists Cariophyllus flos,
Cariophyllus hortulanus, Cariophyllus domesticus, Betonica altilis, and of
Pliny Cantabrica, the Apothecaries call it flos chariophylloru^, but there are
diverse other herbs that are called Herbae tunicae, but some suppose Carduus
Benedictus to be the right herba tunica, where they should read herba turca or
turcha and not tunica. Gordonius does call our Ocymastrum that is Behen, herbam
tunicam, so that almost each author has his own herbam tunicam. Some do call
our Gillowfloures flos tunicus, to distinguish it from herba tunica, which is
Behen, and they do very well, for a thing well distinguished preuenteth many
errors. Gentian, in Greek and Latin Narce, Aloe Gallica, and Gentiana.
Gentian the lesser, in Greek Phyteuma, in Latin Cruciata, Gentiana Cruciata,
and at the Apothecaries about the River of Rhene, Herba diui Petri. This herb
is used even at this present for the^ that have taken somewhat to fall in love
with another body, or that are bewitched. It is also a true remedy
experimented, if it be used as it ought. Germander, in greek and Latin
Chamedrys, Chameroys, Lynodris, Trixago, Curcula, and Serratula. Whenever
thou will use Germander, take that with the brown red flowers, which is a kind
of Teucrium, for that is the true Germander, and is called of some
Calamandrina, and Morsus mulierum. Ginger, Zingiber, a well known spice,
called also Gingiber, and at the Apothecar. Zinziber. Gips, in greek and
latin Gipsus, or Gipsum: there are diverse kinds of it, but the best is that
which is most like to chalk. Gitte, in latin and greek Melanthium, Gith, and
at the Apothecaries Nigella Romana. There is yet another kind of it, whereof
the plant is bigger, and more pleasant to behold, but the seed is not so
strong in smell, and is called Damask Nardus, of the Herbarists Nigella
Damascena: but the first kind is only used in Physic. They are both of them
hot and dry in the third degree. Glue, in greek Colla, and Xylocolla, in
latin of Virgil, Gluten, of Varro and Salustius Glutinum, otherwise also
Glutinum taurinum, and at the Apothecaries Gluten ligni. It is used in
plasters for the rupture. Gnat, in greek Conops, and of Hesichius Nopis, in
latin Culex. Goat, Capra. Goldfinch is called in greek Acanthis, in latin
Carduelis, and is good in meats for them that have a cold stomach. Goose,
Anser. Goosegras, in greek Aparine, Omphalocarpos, Philanthropos, in latin
Aspergula, Asperula, and Speronella, it is a well known weed, hot and dry by
nature. Gourdes, Cucurbita esculenta, Cucurbita ventricosa, Cucurbita
cameraria, Cucurbita perticalis, and at the Apothecaries Cucurbita. Graye,
look a Badger, B. Gromell, in Greek and Latin Lithospermon, Gorgonium, of
Theophrastus Diosporus, and at the Apothecaries Milium solis. Dioscor. calls
it Lithospermum, and Semen Leoninum. There be two kinds of it: the first
grows in the fields and untilled places: the second is like the former which
is used at the Apothecaries, but it grows not above a span in height, and the
seed is also much less, it is called Lithospermon aruense: the other has
small leaves like to Flax, and between every leaf a little seed, not unlike
to the true Gromell: the Herbarists do call it Lingua passerina, Lithospermon
syluestre, and Lithospermon nigrum: in English black Gromil, to distinguish it
from the white which is daily used. Some also do add to the former kinds
Lachrima Iouis, calling it Lithospermon maius, although it have no communion
with them: the first is most used. Grains, Cardamomum maius, at the
Apothecaries Granum Paradisi: it is used commonly both at the Apothecaries, and
in the Kitchen. Grass, in Greek and Latin Agrostis, and Gramen. Grasshopper,
Cicada. Greenefinch, Acanthus, in Greek and in Latin Spinus, and of Theodorus
Gaza Ligurinus: it is a well known bird, and used commodiously in meats for
all cold rheumes. Gum, in Latin Gummi, at the Apothecaries Gummi Arabicum.
H.
HAre, Lepus, it is a common and well known beast, especially in rich men's
houses. Hares foot, in Greek and in Latin Lagopus, Lagopodium, Pes
leporinus: the Herbarists do call it Trifolium Leporinum, Trifolium felinum, and
Trifolium Trinitatis. This herb is much used for the laske. Harts-ease, in
Greek and Latin Diosanthos, Phlox, Phlogium, Herba flammea, Herba clauellata,
Herba Trinitatis, and at the Apothecaries Iacca. Gaza calls it Flammula: it
is otherwise called of the Herbarists Flos Iouis. It is an herb common in all
gardens and fields, it is much used, and especially the water of it. Hearts
tongue, in Greek and Latin Phyllitis, and Lingua Ceruina. It is of diverse
unlearned Physicians taken and also used for the Asplenium of the ancients, or
for the true Scolopendrion; where notwithstanding the true Scolopendrium is
common enough. Hartwort or Aristology, Capnos Chelidonia, Capnos phragmites,
Pes Gallinaceus: of the Herbarists Pseudoaristolochia, and Radix Concaua. The
roots of this herb have the unskillful Physicians brought in use for the true
Aristology the round, and is unto this day used for the same at many
Apothecaries, which nevertheless is nothing like it. So befalls it commonly
that we will see and decerne what is done in the heavens amongst the stars, and
do not know those things that are beneath on earth, and belonging to our Art.
This herb is a kind of Fumitorie, which Aetius and Pliny have so described
it as may appear by their writings. Here is to be noted that as often as you
find either round Hartwort, or round Aristologie, that the right round
Aristology is to be taken for it. The true Aristolochia rotunda is called in
Greek and Latin Aristolochia, and Melocarpon: otherwise it is called for a
difference Aristolochia rotunda, and Malum Terrae. Hasell, or Hasell nut, in
Greek Carya, in Latin Corylus, and Nux auellana. There are two kinds of it,
the one that grows every where in the woods, and the other that is planted in
gardens called a Filberd tree. The Nuts are called in Greek Leptocaryon, Nux
auellana, Nux pontica, Nux praenestina, Nux Heracleotica, and Auellana. The
tame Hasell Nuts are called Filberds, Lombardy Nuts, that is, Nux Longobardica.
The wood of the Hasell is cut in chips as the wood of the Ash, and also used in
the making of aromaticall wines. Hawthorne, is called of Theophrast.
Cynosbatus, of Pliny Cynospaston, and Neurospaston, of Dioscorides Oxyacantha,
of Gaza Canirubus, the fruits are called Hawes. Hawke, Accipiter of Virgil
Sacerales. Heath, Erica, of Theophrastus Tetralix. Hedghog, Echinus, a well
known beast, it is full of prickles over the whole body, so that his skin will
not serve to fur a pair of mittens. Hemlock, is a very venomous herb; it is
called in greek Conion, Cathechomenion, Abiaton, Aegynos, Apseudes, Ethusa,
Ageomera, Apolegusa, Timoron, Dolia, Palyanodinos, Aman osis, Dardanis, Aphros,
Creidion, Catapsixis, Coete, in latin Cicuta: it grows here and there by
hedges, in meadows, and in other grassy places, it has a very stinking and
hurtful savor. Hemp, in greek and latin Schoenostrophon, Asterion,
Canabis, or Cannabis: it is but seldom used in Physic: it is often called
Halterweede. Henbane, in greek and latin Hyoscyamus, Dyoscyamus, Emmanes,
Duhyrabion, Typhonium, Pythonium, Altercum, Apollinaris, Fabulum, Faba Iouis,
Faba suilla, Herba calicularis, Faba Iupina, Mania, and at the Apothecaries
Iusquiamus. It is cold in the third degree, especially the white, which only is
used in Physic. The gray and black Henbane seeds by reason of their great
cold, are taken for poison, wherefore neither of both ought to be used
inwardly. Herbe-bennet, look Auence. A. Herb two pence, is called of
Theophrastus, Erestedanum, in latin Centimorbia, Centimorbum, or Centimorbium:
at the Apothecaries Numularia, Serpentina minor, and Serpentinaria minor. Some
do also call it Hirundinaria: it is a common vulnerall herb. Hermodactyles, in
greek Colchicon, in latin Ephemerum deliterium, Ephemerum lethale, Bulbus
agrestis, of the Herbarists Canineca, Panis Ciconiae, and Bulbus Caninus. Our
Physicians and Apothecaries do call them Hermodactylu^. But because ye diverse
other plants are called Hermodactiles, it is needful to distinguish them
here, that no man put either himself or any body else in danger: for our common
Hermodactylus, is the Hermodactyle root, and the true Colchicum, which Galen
calls Ephemeru^ deleterium: Auicenna, Serapio, and other Arabian Physicians
do affirm the same: and it avails naught, that some will distinguish the
Colchicum of the Grecians, from the Hermodactylus of the Arabians: their false
and erroneous opinions are easily withstoode, for you need but only compare
the chapter of Hermodactyles of Serapio, with the chapter of Colchicum of
Dioscorides, then shall you evidently perceive that it is one and the same
root: For Serapio being a dilligent follower of Dioscorides, has taken his
chapt. de Hermodactylo out of the chapt. de Colchico Dioscoridis verbatim, word
for word; as he has also done in all other plants that are described of
Dioscorides, as all they may perceive that have co^ferred both these authors
together. Wherefore it is most sure yt the Colchicum of the Grecians, and the
Hermodactylus of the Arabians, which now also are used for Hermodactyles, are
one and the same. But Dioscorides and Serapio affirm their Colchicum and
Hermodactylus to be a poison as well as the venomous Toade-stooles, wherefore
also they command, that they be in no wise used or eaten: And although Serapio
do say that the Hermodactyles be good for the Gout, and other joint
diseases, yet he adds, that if one use too much of them, that thereby the
muscles and the stomach are marueliously weakened: but then he speaks of the
root of the white Hermodactyles, and supposes that they that are red and
black should altogether kill one. Seeing then they are so dangerous these
roots ought not to be tolerated at the Apothecaries, and much less to be
used inwardly. Whereas then we know sufficiently that our Colchicum, or
Hermodactylus is so venomous, therefore must they needs lie extremely, that
brag that they can cure all ioynt-diseases with it. For it is most true, that
they that use these Hermodactyles for the Gowte, whether it be in Pills,
Potions, or any other way, do wax worse and worse every day, and at last
are constrained to die an untimely death, as has been seen in diverse men, and
at diverse times: notwithstanding that diverse learned men have warned them that
use such dogged medicines, but no man will be taught of another, which is the
only cause that we will not leave our own opinions and errors, which thing
does not only bereave many a man of this life, but also of the life to come.
Wherefore I would admonish and warn every man to take heed of them, and where
he finds Hermodactyles in any receipt, that he omit them. And because that
there be Pills made with Hermodactyles, which would be very commodious for
the Gout, if they were left out, therefore I would wish the Hermodactyles to be
omitted, and to put Turbith, or Agaricke in steed thereof, or to take Medulla
Carthami for it: for they that have observed this order, have found great good
by it. But if you take the roots of the true Mechoacan for it, that would be
much better, for I my self have approved the same: this done, you need not
fear any mishap or danger, from which I could not omit to warn every good
body. It is very true that diverse Grecian writers, as Actuarius, and Nicolaus
Myrepsus, have left unto us certain compositions, wherein are both the white
and the red Hermodactyles, as in Aurea Alexandrina Nicolai, and Diamoscu
Actuarij, but these authors have not meant the Hermodactyles of the Arabians,
or the Colchicum Dioscoridis, but they have meant the Behen album, and rubrum;
which very well ought to be noted, that this precious co^fection be not defiled
with yt Hermodactyles, Turbith, or with Mechoacan. Dioscorides has also his
proper Hermodactyles which he calls otherwise Pentaphyllum, and it is called
in English Cinquefoile, whereof has been spoken before. Heron, in Latin
Erodius, Rhodius, Auis Diomedaea, and Ardea: it is a bird every where well
known. Hollyhockes, in Greek and in Latin Althaea, Aristalthaea, and Dendron
Malache, of Aetius and Galen Ebiscus, Ibiscus, Hibiscus, and at the
Apothecaries Maluauiscus, and Bismalna: the leaves and flowers are hot and dry
in the first degree. Honey, Mel. Honysuckle, in Greek Periclymenum,
Periclymenus, Aegine, Carpathon, Splenion, Calycanthemum, in Latin Volucrum
maius, Inuolucrum maius, Pileolus Veneris, and of the Herbarists Matrisylua,
Matersylua, or Vinciboscum, of Scribonius Syluae matter: the Apothecaries do
call it Caprifolium, or Lilium inter spinas. There are two kinds of it, first
the common sort which is known every where by the name of Honysuckle: the
other kind is only set in gardens, and is very like the former, but that the
leaves are somewhat broader, and grow close to the stalks much like the
Thorowaxe: the flowers are a little shorter than those of the former, and white
of color intermixed with purple, and smell very pleasantly. In Prouence and
Italy is this sort as common as the other is with us; for it grows in every
hedge, etc. The Herbarists do call it for a difference from the former,
Caprifolium Italicum, Caprifolium perfoliatum, or Periclymenum Italicum, and
Periclymenum perfoliatum, both these plants are hot and dry by nature: the
leaves and the flowers are used for stinking ulcers, fistulaes, canker, and
Pockes. Hops, in Greek Bryon, in Latin Lupulus salictarius, Lupulus Humulus,
and of Mesues Volubilis, or Volubilis magna, Lupus reptitius, Habiola, and
Bruscandula. It is hot and dry in the second degree. Horehound, in Greek and
Latin Linostrophon, Phyllopharis, Camelopodium, Prassium, and Marrubium.
Horse, Equus. Horse Leache, Hirudo, Sanguisuga: it is a well known water
worm, it is often used to draw out blood of the body of man. Horse Radish,
Sinapi Persicum, at the Apothecaries Raphanus mayor, of the Herbaristes
Raphanus condimentarius, and Raphanus obsoniorum. The Arabians do call it
Nasturtium album. This root is every where well known, and is taken of diverse
unskillful Physicians and Apothecaries for Armoracia, and Raphanus minor, or
Syluestris, the which are the names of wild Radish. Horsetayle, in Greek
Hippuris, in Latin Equisetum, Cauda equina, and Asprella, Dioscorides does
also call it Ephedron, and Anabasis. There are two kinds of it the greater and
the lesser: the greater is that whereof we have now spoken: the lesser is
called Hippuris minor, Equitium. Horsetoong, in Greek and Latin Hippoglossum,
Hypoglossum, Epiglossum, Epiphyllocarpon, Lingua pagana, Bonifacia, Vunlaria,
and Bislingua. Hounds tongue, Cynoglossum, or Cynoglossa, Lingua Canina: it is
cold and dry in the second degree. Housleeke, in Greek Isoon, Hypogressum,
Stergethron, Zophthalmon, and Atthales, in latin Sedum semperuiuum, and of
Apuleius Vitalis, Caulis Iouis, of the Herbarists Herba tonitru: the
Apothecaries do call it Barba Iouis. The second kind is the lesser Housleeke
called of the Grecians Trithales, Erisithales, Geostitis, and Petrophyes, in
latin Aizoum minus, Sedum minus, Vermicularis, Cauda muris, of Pliny
Digitellus, of the Herbaristes Herba vermiculata, at the Apothecaries Crassula
minor: both these herbs have like operations, for they do dry, cool, and are
astringent, but cold in the third degree. Hucckleberries, field Berries,
Bilberries, Pseudomyrtus, Vitis Idaea Theophrasti, it is a plant growing on
hills and in woods very common. These black Berries are falsely taken for Myrtle
seeds of the southsayers and unlearned crew, as they also do with the leaves
in stead of Myrtle leaves, for they could never guess by the sign and course
of the Moon, nor by any other stars influence, what the right Myrtus is, for
which cause they use this plant for it; but one must take heed not to use them
for Mirtles, for they neither have the virtues nor operation of them. Hyssope
or Isope, Hyssopus, or Hyssopum.
I.
IAcinth, in Greek and Latin Hyacinthus. It is a precious stone of a light
violet color. It is called an oriental, or Bohemish Amethist. It is dealt
withal of the unskillful as it is with diverse other simples, for the
Chrysolite has been used many years for the Iacinth, but how erroneously
that has been done, may appear by the writings of Pliny, who says, that
the Iacinth is like the Amethist. Wherefore it is apparent that the Hyacinthus
has his name of the violet colored flower Hyacinthus, which is most like to
ye natural Amethist, so that the Chrysolithus has falsely ben used for the
Hyacinthus. Also the yellow stone Prasius, or Chrysoprasium has falsely bin
called Chrysolithus, by which means these stones have bin confused and
confusedly used the one for the other: wherefore Hyacinthus is the Bohemish or
oriental Amethist, and the Chrysolite is a false Iacinth, and Chrysoprasius is
the false Chrysolite: this have I thought good to show, by reason of the great
errors daily committed, to the end ye more warily might be dealt hereafter in
the like cases. Jasper stone, it is a precious stone, whereof there be diverse
kinds, to wit, green red, light red, dark blew, liver colored, and spotted,
yellow like Turpentine, and gray with smokie colors: all these kinds are in
the fields about Niuernoy, and also here and there in France, also in Germany
in sundry places, except the green and dark green Iaspers, which only are
brought out of India, these two last kinds are the best. The dark green
Jasper is called Heliotropius: the light green like a Smaragde is called
Iaspis viridis, this is used for the Smaragde but unjustly. The liuercoloured
is called at the Apothecaries Lapis Hepaticus. The yellow Jasper is called of
Dioscorides Therebinthizusa, and the blew Jasper Aerizusa. Jews lime, in
greek Asphaltos, in latin Bitumen, and at the Apothecaries Bitumen Iudaicum,
it has his name by reason that it was wont to be brought unto us from Iudaea
out of the salt sea, wherein the Jordan does exonerate it self, which also
has bin taken for the very best of Galen, Dioscorides, and of diverse other
ancient writers: but that which is now adays found at the Apothecaries is
only a deceit and a counterfeited Jews lime, to wit, made of Pitch, and Oleum
petrae, which is both bought and sold of Jews, and other covetous Merchants,
wherefore it is much better to use of our Dutch Pitch (which is the right
Bitumen) than to take one that is counterfeited. Pitch or Jews lime is very
seldom used alone, but it is always mixed with other things. Jews stone, in
Greek and Latin Tecolithus, Phoenicites, Pyrene, and Eureos. All these names
does Pliny attribute to the Jews stone, yet he does also call ye sponge stone
Spongites Tecolithus, but this name is only due to the Jews stone. It is
called of Dioscorides, Lapis Iudaicus, by which name it is also known at the
Apothecaries. Incke, Atramentum scriptorium, Atramentum librarium, the
Apothecaries do call it Encaustum. Indian nut, in Greek Caryon Indicon, in
Latin Nux Indica, and of Serapio Nergoil. It is a fruit like to the great
Pompeons whilst it is green, but it is brought unto us dried: the shale of it
is as hard as a horn, black without, and as big as a common bowl. It is also
well known in this country: within it has a white pith or kernel, it is
used at all Apothecaries. The kernel is hot in the second, and moist in the
first degree. Ireas, of Dioscorides, Iris, Urania, Thaumastos, Thelpide, or
Thalpide, and Cathaeron: of Athenaeus, and Theophrastus, Hieris, in Latin
Iris, Opertritus, Radix marica, and Radix consecratrix, of the Herbarists
Strapula odorata, Radix violacea, and at the Apothecaryes indeclinabiliter in
casu genitiuo, Ireos, or Irios. There are five kinds of it, the first is
strange, and is only planted in Gardens, it has a fair white and odoriferous
flower: the root is also white and sweet smelling: it is called of the
Herbarists Iris alba, Iris domestica alba. The second kind is also planted in
gardens, it is very like the former, but the flower is blewe and within of
diverse colors, not unlike to the raynebow: the root is somewhat grayer than
the first, and not so odoriferous: it is called the blew Flower deluce, of the
Herbarists Iris caerulea, Iris domestica caerulea, and Lilium caeruleum. The
third kind grows of it self in the woods, it is much like to the last
mentioned, but that the flower is bigger and somewhat declining to the Violet
or purple color, within distinguished with many colors like a raynebow. This
is called wild Ireas, of the Herbarists Iris syluestris, Lilium coeleste
syluestre. The fourth kind has small, yet long and narrow leaves, and a fair
blew flower without any smell: the root is somewhat less than of the others,
but not odoriferous, yea almost without smell, but very sharp and biting in
taste. It grows commonly near the Rhene in marshes: it is called of the
Simplicists Iris palustris angustifolia, Lilium caeruleum palustre maius. The
fifth kind grows also in moist places near the Rhene, it has broader and
shorter leaves than the former with a blewe flower: the root is very sharp on
the tongue but without any sent. It is called of the Herbarists Chamaeiris, Iris
pumila, Iris palustris minor, Iris palustris latifolia, Gladiolus palustris
latifolius, Gladiolus palustris minor, and Lilium caeruleum palustre minus.
Dioscorides commends the Iris Illyrica or Sclauonia above all other kinds.
This is somewhat lesser than the common kind of Ireas: it is also somewhat
reddish and of a pleasant color, and sweet in smell. But the Italian Ireas
and that which grows in Apulia, does not only exceed the former in
odoriferousnes, but also in operation; wherefore it is also commended of all
learned physicians above that of Illyria. The Herbarists do call it Iris
Italica, Iris Florentina, Iris Apula: in English the white Ireas root. If thou
therefore find Ireas in any composition with any addition, then shall thou
take the Iris Florentina, which is common at all Apothecaries. Isope, look
Hyssop. H. Iuiubes, in Greek and Latin Sericum, Zyzyphum, and at the
Apothecaries Iuiuba: it is a kind of Prunes that are well known. Iron, Ferrum,
it is very much used in Physic: for it is made red hot and extinguished in
water, wine, milk, and many other liquors more. Juniper tree, in Greek
Arceuthos, in Latin Iuniperus. There are two kinds of it, the great and the
lesser Juniper tree: the lesser is common on every hill and known to every
man: in Greek and of Dioscorides it is called Arceuthis, and Acathalis, of
Theophrastus Oxycedrus, in latin Iuniperus minor, Iuniperulus and Iupicellus,
in English the Juniper shrub. The great Juniper tree has bigger, stronger, and
more pricking leaves, than the lesser, and it is a meetely great tree: the
berries and fruits are thrice bigger than those of the former: it grows on
high hills and in woods. It is called in Greek of Dioscorides Arceuthos, and
Acatera, of others Oxyarceuthis, and of Theophrastus Cedria, in Latin
Iuniperus mayor, Iuniperus acuta, and Cupressus syluestris. They are both of
sundry virtues and operations in Physic, and therefore they may be used
without indifferently. Iuorie, Ebur, Ebor, Dens Elephantis, but Iuba does call
the Iuorie or Elephants tooth Cerata. Iuie, in Latin and Greek Cissus,
Hedera, Edera, and Haedera.
K.
KIte, Ictinus, in latin Miluus, and Miluius. Knotgras, in Greek Polygonum,
in latin Proserpinaca, Herba sanguinalis, or Sa^guinaria. There are three
kinds of it, to wit, the male, the female, and the lesser knotgras: the male is
sufficiently known by the name of Knotgras, it grows every where on the high
ways and untilled grounds: it is called in greek Polycarpon, Carcinethron,
Teutalis, Myrtopetalon, Cnopodium, Pedalion, in latin Polygonum mas,
Sanguinaria, Herba sanguinalis mas, Seminalis, Vnguis muris, Proserpinaca, of
Apuleius Clinopodiontes, Scorpinaca, Statumaria, and Misereuiuium. The
Herbarists do call it Polygonum Heracleum, or Herculeum, Corrigiola,
Multinodia, Centumnodia, Gramen Porcinum, of Aetius Heliobotane, that is, Herba
solis, Dioscor. does also call it in greek Cynochala. The second kind is a
kind of Horsetaile, and is called of the common people the lesser Horsetaile,
and of Diosc. to distinguish it from the other Polygonum faemina, or
Sanguinalis foemina. The third kind and the lesser knotgras grows willingly
in the fields amongst Turnips, and it has a small star like leaves, and great
store of seed: the Herbarists do call it Polygonum minus, Centinodia minor,
Multinodia minor, Corrigiola minor, Sa^guinalis minor, Seminalis minor, and
Ruella: but whenever any mention is made, then must the first kind be
understood.
L.
LAdymantle, the greater Sanicle of Valerius Cordus, it is called in greek
Drosiu^, Drosera, and Psiadium: the Herbarists do call it Alchimilla,
Stellaria, Sanicula mayor, Pes leonis, and Planta leonis: it is a well known
vulnerall herb, yet altogether unknown to the ancient Physicians. It is hot
and dry in the second degree, it is used in all manner of vulnerall potions,
salues, and oiles. Ladythistle, in greek and latin Sylibu^, of the Herbarists
Carduus diuae Mariae, Carduus marianus, at the Apothecaries Chameleonta, as
they are taught by the unskillful Phisitio^s. Lark, in greek Corydes, and
Corydalis, of Pliny in latin Galetita, and Alauda. The Lark is much commended
for the pain of the belly and many other infirmities. Larks spur, of Dioscor.
Cuminu^ syluestre alteru^, of the Herbarists Plectranthemum, Calcaria, Herba
diuae Otiliae, Flos regius, Cyminum cornutum, Cyminum siliquosum, Cyminum
corniculatum, and Calcatrippa, although the Starthistles in Italy be also
called Calcatrippa, at the Apothec. Consolida regia, and Consolida regalis,
Ruellius calls it Cornuta. Lauander, Laue^dula, Laua^dula, and Lauendandula.
There are 2. kinds of it, sufficiently known to every man, to wit, the great
and the lesser, the lesser kind is commonly called Lauander, and is every where
known by that name: the greater is called Spikenard, and of the Herbarists
Spica hortulana, and Pseudonardus. In old time, as well as in this our age,
have these herbs bin planted near Be hiues, because the Bees do love both the
smell, and the taste of the Lauander flowers. The ancient Physicians have called
this herb Casia herba, Casia coronaria, and Cneoron: whereby they have meant
both the Laua^der and the Spikenard: for there are 2. kinds of the herb Casia.
The use of both these herbs is very common with us in Physic; not only used
of it self, but mixed also with other things. Laurel, or Lorel, in Greek
Daphnoides, Eupetalo^, Pelasgum Plinij, Peploin Dioscoridis, in latin
Laureola, and Piper montanum of the Herbarists: it is a well known plant, that
grows in the woods, and dangerous to be ^sed: some unskillful Physicians and
Apothecaries do use it for the true Mezereon of the Arabians. Lead, Plumbum.
Leaven, in greek Zyme, of Theophrastus, Phyrama, in latin Fermentum. Lemon,
Lemonium malum, Limonium malum, Pomum Lemonium, and Limonium, it is
sufficiently known every where. Lentils, in greek Phacos, in latin Lens, and
Lenticula. They are mean between hot and cold, but dry in the third degree.
Lettice, in greek Thridax, in latin Lactuca, a very common and well known
herb. There are many kinds of it: first the common Lettice which is called
broad Lettice: secondly the crumpled Lettice, called Lactuca crispa, and
Lactuca cappadox: the third kind is the headed Lettice, Lactuca sessilis; of
Pliny, Lactuca Laconica; of Columella, Lactuca Ceciliana, and Lactuca medica;
of Athenaeus, Astylis; and of Pithagoras, Eunuchion, because that it hinders
the generation of humane seed: the fourth kind is wild, and is called wild
Lettice, in greek Thridax agria, in latin Lactuca syluestris, of the
Herbarists Chenoglossum, Lingua anserina, and Carduus Hepaticus. Some blunt
Phisitio^s do use this for Endive, although ye Endive be very common and known
of most men, which is no small error. Licebane, or Stauesacre, in greek
Astaphys agria, Staphys agria, and Phthitioctonum, in latin Vua syluestris,
Pedicularia, and Herba pedicularis, of the Herbarists Piper murinum, and at the
Apothecaries Staphisagria: of the whole plant is only the seed used. Licorice,
Glycyrrhiza, Glyceraton, Glycephyton, Adipsos, Sylitra, Lybyestason; and
Theophrast. calls it Eutyglycea, in latin Radix dulcis, Radix Scythica, and
at the Apothecaries Liquiritia, and of some barbarous people Regulitia: it is a
well known root, and especially about Bamberge, where it grows in that
abundance, that it does not only serve Germany but many other countries more.
Lighe, Lixiuium, and Lixiuia, of Columell, Spuma caustica, of Martialis, Spuma
Bataua. Lignum Aloes, in greek Agallochum, of Aetius, Simeon Sethus, Nicolaus,
and Actuarius, Xyloaloes, in latin of Pliny, Tarum, of the later writers
Lignum aloes, Xylum aloes, and Xyloaloes. The Druggists do call it Calambucum,
Lignum Taprobanum, Lignum paradisi, and Lignum sanctae crucis. In the Bible
has it only been called Aloes: it is an odoriferous kind of wood which is
brought out of the Isles of Sumatra, or Taprobana: There are many kinds of it,
the heauyest is the best, and that which is hard and spotted black, and very
sappy, is also taken for the best. Lilly, in greek and latin Crinon, Lirium,
Lilium, Rosa Iunonis, or Iunonia Rosa, Nicander calls it Crinanthemum. The
Apothecaries call it for a difference of the others Lilium album, that is the
white Lilly: and by the name of Lillies in this book are always the white
ones meant. Liriconfancie or May Lillies, or Lillies of the valleys, of
Theophrastus, Lilium vernum, of the Herbarists and common Physicians Lilium
conuallium. Some would have it to be the Cacalia of Dioscorides, but they are
deceived. The flowers of this herb are only used. Litharge of gold or silver,
Lithargyrium, there are two kinds of it: the first is the Litharge or dross of
silver, Argyritis, at the Apothecaries Lithargyrium argenti. The second kind
is the Litharge of gold, and it is somewhat redder than the former. There is
yet another kind called of Pliny, Molybditis, and of other Spuma plumbi, that
is the scum of Lead. Otherwise it is also called Lithargyrum argenti, also
Lithargyros, and of Pliny, Spuma argenti, as the Litharge of gold is called of
some Spuma auri. These 3. kinds have the same qualities and operations, yet is
the litharge of gold taken for the best; the^ the scum of lead; lastly the
litharge of silver. Loadstone, in greek of Galen Magnetis, and Heraclia, of
Callimachus, Heracleotis, and of Porphyrius, Magnes, as it is also called in
latin. It is called of Pliny Sideritis, because it draws Iron unto it.
Lobster, Cancer marmus. Louage, in greek Hipposel^num, in latin Apiu^
equinum, of Theodorus Gaza, Equapium, of the Herbarists, Pseudoligusticum of
the Apothecaries and common Physicians Leuisticum. Because they have used it
many years for the true Libysticum, or Ligusticum, therefore will they
(according to their old custom) remain in their error, and will by no means
be better instructed, let the poor patient speed as he list: Notwithstanding
that the true Libysticum of the ancients be in great abundance brought out of
Italy, for it grows very common in Liguria, and other Provinces: but
diligent and careful Physicians do plant the same in their gardens. Others
that have not the true Ligusticum, use the Angelica for it, or the Oustrutium:
for both these herbs have the same virtues with the Ligusticum: the which all
Physicians and Apothecaries ought to imitate, until such time as they attain
to the true Ligusticum. If we did so much trouble our selves about the
knowledge of herbs and simples, as we do about the making of Calenders and
Prognostications, we might have this and many simples more which now we want.
The Ligusticum is also called Panacea of Dioscorides. Lupines, in greek and
latin Lupinus, Thermus, and Faba Lupina.
M.
MAce in greek and latin Macer, Xylomacer, Macis, and Nucis myristicae
inuolucrum: It is a well known spice, hot and dry by nature. Madder, in
greek and latin Erythrodanum, of Nicander, Scyron, Rubia, Rubia tinctorum,
Rubia infectoria, Vena tinctoria: at the Apothecaries Rubia tinctorum, and Vena
tinctorum. There are two kinds of it, the wild and the tame: the wild grows
every wherein the woods, and it is much better and fitter for Physic than the
other, which my self have approved to be true at sundry times: the root is
only in use, for the herb has small virtue. Magpie, Pica, and Citta. Malmsey,
in greek and latin Momembrasites, Vinum aruisium, Vinum Creticum, Vinum chiu^,
and Nicolaus Myrepsus calls it Vinum Momembrasiaticum, the common Physicians
and Apothecaries call it Vinum maluaticum, and Vinum maruisianum, or
Maluisianum. Mallows, in greek Malache, in latin Malua. There are 4.
principal kinds of it, whereof the first is the tame Mallow, which grows in
gardens and elsewhere: it is called Malua satiua, Malua hortensis, of the
Herbarists Malua mayor, Hippomalache, and Malua caballina: this is the right
Mallow, or Malua satiua of the auncie^ts, notwithstanding that it grows in
all places of it self. The second kind grows every where by hedges and
ditches, and it is much less than the former, it is called in greek Malache
agria, and in latin Malua syluestris, or Malua agrestis, of ye Herbarists
Chenomalache, Malua anserina, Malua leporina, and Malua pumila, in English the
lesser Mallows. The third kind is now adays planted in gardens, and it is
called crumpled Mallows, it is more moist than either of the former, although
that first it came from them; for by the art of Gardening it is so changed, as
many other plants also are. It is called of the Herbaristes Malua Romana, or
Malua crispa. The fourth kind is called a winter Rose, in greek Moloche, and in
latin of Apuleius, Hastula regia, of the Herbarists Rosa transmarina, Rosa
hyemalis, Rosa autumnalis: the Apothecaries call it Malua arborea. The first
two kinds are mean warm and moist by nature, but the lesser disagreeth
somewhat from the other. The crumpled Mallows are much moyster by nature than
the other, and is but seldom used in Physic, and that because the two first
are much stronger. The winter Roses are middle mean warm, but astringent
withal, that as the former kinds do loose the belly, so this does bind the
same: wherefore it is also used for the Laske: They therefore do lie falsely,
that commend this kind above all the Mallows of Dioscorides and Galen.
Mandrake, Mandragora, Antimelon: this is called of Pythagoras, Anthropomorphos.
Maniple is a handful, or as much as one can hold in his hand, of herbs,
flowers, roots, and such like things, in Greek Dracos, Dragma, and of the
later Grecians Dismidion, in latin of Cornelius Celsus, Manipulus, of
Scribonius and Marcellus, Fasciculus, of Pliny, Fasciculus manualis. Manna,
Melligo, Saliua siderum, Ros syriacus, Mel aerium: of Galen, Aeromeli,
Drosomeli, at the Apothecaries Manna, or Manna coelestis, to distinguish it
from the Frankincense, which is called Manna Libani, and Manna Thuris. There
are two kinds of Manna, the one is soft and thin, which is gathered in stone
pots, and that is called of Galen lib. tertio de alimentoru^ facultatibus, the
principal Aeromcli, that is, Melaeriu^, and Mel libani. The Arabians do call it
for a difference from the other Tereniabin, and Auerroes Tergebiu^. The
Simplicists do call it Manna liquida. But now adays it is neither found nor
used any longer, as it was wont to be in the time of Galen, and of other
writers. This Manna liquida does Hippocrates call Mel cedrinu^. The other kind
is dry and hard like Sugar, and is differing according to the place where it
is collected, so yt the one is called Manna Calibrina, and Manna Bombycina,
this is brought out of Calabria, and it is accounted the woorst kind, and it is
not so sweet as the other. The other kind is called Manna Briansona, it is in
compacted, hard, and fatty grains, it is also sweeter than the former, and
more forcible in operation. The third kind is whiter, and the grains of it are
not much unlike to the^ of Mastick, it is also called Ma^na granata, or
granulata, or Mastichina, and it is the very best. Marchasite, in greek and
latin Pyrites, at the Apothecaries Marchasita, it is a mineral stone, it is
used in Gums and Tinder boxes. There are many kinds of it, whose names do all
differ according to the mineral that they contain. Marierom bastard, look
Organy O. Marierom gentle, in greek Sampsychus, in latin Amaracus or Amaracum,
of Aegineta and at the Apothecaries Maiorana. Marigold, of Virgil, Columella,
and Pliny, Caltha, and of the Herbarists Solsequium aureum, Verrucaria, Caltha
poetica, to distinguish it from the Caltha of Dioscorides, which is the
Chrysa^themu^: it is otherwise called Calendula, and there are 3. kinds of it,
to wit, the common Marigold, that grows in every garden, and is called
Calendula. The second kind has fair great and double flowers, it is called
Cale^dula multiplex. The third kind is much less than both the former, but
very like to ye first kind with flowers, leaves, and roots: this kind grows
every where about Worms, and also about Reingau in ploughed fields, and it is
much better and fitter for Physic than the former, it is called the wild
Marigold, Calendula syluestris, and Aruensis: some call it Calthula, because it
is the least of the three. Mastick, in greek and latin Mastiche, Resina
lentiscina, and at the Apothecaries Mastix. Maudlinwort, in greek Chrysocome,
and Chrysitis, in latin Coma aurea, Aureola, and Amaranthus, of Galen and the
Herbarists Amarathus luteus, Amaranthus aureus, Tinearia, Silphalithemum,
Staechas citrina, Stichas citrina, and at the Apothecaries Stichados citrinum.
This herb is known to most men, and is hot and dry by nature. Malt is
prepared Barley, whereof the beer is made, it is called in greek of Aetius,
Byne, and in latin Maltum. May Lillies, or flowers, look Liryconfancie. L.
Marsh garlic, in greek and latin of Dioscorides, Scordium, Scorbium,
Dysosmon, and Mithridanio^, of Apuleius Scordilum, Mithridation, and Haema
Ictinos, of the Herbarists Trixago palustris, Trissago palustris, Trixago
aquatica, Chamaedrys aquatica, and of Apuleius Sanguis Milui. There are three
kinds of it: the first is very like the true Germander both in the flower and
in the leaf; but that the leaves are somewhat softer and of a light green
color, and smell like Garlic: the second kind is much like to the former,
but that it is in every respect somewhat greater: it has soft leaves somewhat
rough and gray, but in smell it is like to ye former. The first kind is called
of the Herbarists Scordium minus, and the second kind Scordion maius: the
third kind has a square stalk and white flowers like to the Horehound: the
leaves are big and much iagged, the smell is like Garlic, but not so strong
as the other two. Plinius calls it Scardotis, the Herbarists Scordium alterum
Plinij, or Scordium Plinianum, Scordiastrum, Marrubium palustre, or Marrubium
aquaticum: in English water Horehound. The Apothecaries and such like
Southsayers have taken the wild garlic for ye true Scordium, but how falsely
that is apparent enough to all the learned. The first and second kind are used
promiscue the one for the other: but it avails not, seeing they are both of
one operation. The water or marsh Horehound is as yet unknown at the
Apothecaries and not used at all. The Scordium is used in many compositions.
Maidenhaire, in greek and latin Adianthum, Polytrichon, Gallitrichon,
Ebenotrichon, Capillus Veneris, Supercilium terrae, and Herba Capillaris. There
are two kinds of it: the first is called Adianthum nigrum, or Adianthum
gallicum, because that it is brought out of France unto us: all the English
names (as Venus hair, Maydenhaire, etc.) are proper unto this kind, and
whenever you find either of them in any compositions, then shall this kind
always be understood: the second kind is called Adianthum album: it is a
common and well known herb here and elsewhere: some men call it Onopterium,
Filicula Asellorum, Ruta muraria, and Saluia vitae. Look in V. for Venus
hair. Meade or Honey water, in greek Hydromeli, Melicratum, and in Latin Aqua
mulsa. Medler tree, Mespilus. Melilot, it is called of ye Herbarists Melilotus
Nobilis, Herba flauea, Herba leporina, Melilotus coronata, Sertula regia, and
Corona regia. It is a well known herb, it grows in high meadows and hills
about a span and a half in height (to wit in the Low Countries) with small
Clauers; it has a fine yellow flower which does both smell and taste like honey;
it is not much unlike the flower of peason. It is used every where in steed of
the true Melilotus of the ancients, because it has the same virtues and
operations that are ascribed to their Melilotus. But in all Germany is the
Saxifragium luteum most used, and the Melilotus Saxifragus, and Trifolium
vrsinum, which Dioscorides does call Lotus Libyca, Lotus syluestris: this is
much more forcible than the common Melilot as has been approved. And although
this kind be Melilotus syluestris with Dioscorides; yet there is another kind
of it, to wit, Melilotus Auicennae, whereof he makes two kinds, the one with
white, and the other with yellow flowers; both which do smell very sweet and
are altogether bitter in taste; yet do they digest and bind, which qualities
Dioscorides and Galen do also ascribe to their Melilot: wherefore it is advised
to take the great Melilot Auicennae, and it is used at the Apothecaries. The
white Melilot is not common in all countries, wherefore it is sown in gardens
in many places. The white is called at the Apothecaries Melilotus alba, and the
yellowe Melilotus lutea, the Herbarists do thus distinguish it from Lotus
satiua, they call it Lotus alba, Lotus lutea, as they also call the Lotus
satiua, and Lotus caerulea. Serapio has also his proper Melilot, to wit the
lesser Vitches, which after the flower is fallen away it gets little husks
like bird claws. Some do use the lesser small Melilot that grow in medows,
which is something less than the common Melilot, calling it Melilotus minor,
we call it the lesser Melilot. Diosc. calls his Melilot that grows in
Campania, Sertula Campana, and Cato, Serta Campana. Melons, Melon, Melopepon,
and Melo. Mithridate, Antidotus Methridatica, Methridatium, and at the Apothec.
Methridatum. It is a precious confection against all poison which first was
made by King Mithridate, and has called it by his own name. Mewe, Anethum
syluestre, Anethon vrsinum, Anethum tortuosum, and Meum: some do call it Seseli
Creticum, but care not for them, for it is the true Meum of the ancients, as
every one may see and find to be without deceit, that shall co^fer it with ye
description of Dios. Milk Thistle, in Greek and Latin Chamaeleon niger, and
at the Apothecaries Cardopatium, some do also call it Carlina nigra. Mill dust,
in Greek Polleu, Farina volatica, at the Apothecaries Farina volatilis. Mill
stone, Lapis molaris, of Virgil Lapis incusus. Millet, in Greek Cenchros, of
Strabo Cenchris, of Hippoc. Paspale: it is every where in Germany well known,
and is daily used in meats. Millet of Indie, it is called in Latin Melica, of
Pliny Milium Indicum, of the Herbarists Panicum Indicum, Meliga, Sorghum, and
Saggina. The Portingales call it Milium saburtum. It is a plant not much unlike
to the Sugar canes, and bears a brown seed like a Lettice, but somewhat
sharp. It is now a days sown in gardens. Miscledene, in Greek of Pliny
Ixos, and of Virgil Astilis, of Hesichius Stear, Stelis, in Latin and of Virgil
Viscum. It is an excrescence of trees, and grows commonly on Pear and Apple
trees: also on the Hawthorne tree and Birch trees: but that which grows on
Oaks, Tillet trees, Chestnut trees, or Hasels, is commended above the rest in
Physic. It is used for the falling evil and swimming of the head. Moss, in
Greek Bryon, Sphagnon, Mnion, and Amnion, in Latin Muscus, Muscus arborum,
and Lanugo arborum: at the Apothecaries and of the Arabians Vsnea. Mouse, Mus,
a domestical animal. Mouse-eare, Auricula muris. The herbs that are called
Mouse-eare are 4. in number, although there be but one of them that is called
so of the ancient writers: the first and greatest kind is called of some
Mouse-eare, others Lungwort: it grows commonly in dark Beechen woods and old
walls, it has broad rough and hayrie leaves that lie down flat on the ground,
and a stalk that is divided into three or four sprigs, on the top whereof are
yellow flowers: this stalk being squised it yields a white milkie juice like
to the wild Lettice: the Chirurgians do call it Lactaria consolida: the
Herbarists Pilosella mayor, Auricula Muris mayor, and Pulmonaria Gallica,
because it also serves for the disease of the lights. The second kind is
called Pilosella media, and Pilosella, or Mouse-eare, by which name it is every
where known as also in this Book it is called no otherwise. The third kind
is called the lesser Mouse-eare, of the Herbarists Flos Angelicus, and
Pilosella minor. It grows in barren grounds, it has fair white and purple
flowers. The fourth kind is called the blewe Mouseare or blew Eyebright, of
Dioscorides Myosoris, Auricula muris, and of the Herbaristes Euphrasia carulea,
and Auricula Muris caerulea. This herb is nothing like to the former three
kinds in operation and virtue; for the water distilled of it is used for the
dimnes and bleerdnes of the eyes. The ancient Physicians have only used it
for the bad eyes. But our common Mouseare is only used in potions for wounds
and ruptures, and such like compositions; notwithstanding that it has his
proper use of it self. Mouse of the Alps, Mus Alpinus, whereof the grease is
used against the lamenes and extenuation of the joints. Mugwort, Artemisia, it
is an herb sufficiently known, hot and dry in the second degree. Mulberrie
tree, Morea, Sycamin^^ in Greek, in latin Morus, and Arbor sapiens: the fruit
is called Morum, or Mulberrie. Mummye, Mumia: there are two kinds of it, the
one is dug out of the Graves in Arabia and Syria of those that are Balsamed,
and is brought unto us: it is called Pissasphaltum factitium, of the Arabians
Mumia, at the Apothecaries Mumia. Serapio calls it Mumia sepulchorum, to
distinguish it from this kind following. The Physicians call it Mumia Arabum
for a difference from Mumia Graecorum. The second kind is only an equal
mixture of the Jews lyme, and Bitumen: in Greek Pissasphaltum, in Latin
Picibitumen, and of the Simplicists Cera montana, Cera terrestris,
Pissasphaltum natinum, and Mumia natiua. But as often as Mummie is named in
this present work, is not the Jews lime meant, but ye Mummie of the Arabians,
to wit Mumia sepulchrorum, which is found at all Apothecaries under the name of
Mumia. Muscadine, Vinum Apianum, Vinum Musacatulum, Vinum Muscatellinum, and
Muscatellum. Musk, Muscus, Moscus, Muschus, it is the dried matter of the
impostume of a certain beast which is called of the Barbarians Gazella. Must,
in Greek Gleucos, and Deucos, in Latin Mustum, and vinum Musteum, the wine
first pressed out of the grape is called of Columella, Mustum Lixiuium, of Pliny
Protropion. This wine was wont to be enclosed in Tons, and they well hooped,
to the end it should not clarify, and that it might continue sweet. It is
called of some Vinum coactum: it is called of the Grecians Aigleuces, that is,
semper mustum. It is often used for physic but very seldom alone. Mustard, in
Greek and Latin Sinapi, Napi, and Sinapis. There are two kinds thereof, the
wild and the tame Mustard. They are both of them hot and dry in the fourth
degree: the tame kind is more commended for physic than the wild. Mustard
seed the white, or Rocket, in Greek Eusomus, or Eusomum, in Latin Eruca:
there are four kinds of it, the first kind is sown in gardens, and is known
every where by the name of Rocket, or white Mustard seed: this is the true
Eruca and Eusomum of the ancients. The second kind grows of it self in the
fields, not unlike the former, but somewhat less; it is called of the
Herbarists Eruca syluestris, with us, wild rocket. The other two kinds, to wit,
the third, and fourth, do grow about the water side, and have much bigger
leaves than the former, whereof many leaves lie down flat on the ground about
the stalk: the one bears white, the other yellow flowers, they are called of
the Herbarists Erucae aquaticae, Eruculae marinae, in English water rocket.
Mynts crumpled, Menta crispa, Mentha satiua or Mintha, it is hot in the third,
and dry in the second degree: the Greeks do call it Hedyosmum.
N.
NArcissus, in Greek and Latin Narcissus. There are three kinds of it, the
first is sufficiently known by the name of Narcissus, the Herbarists do call
it Rhodionarcissus, and Narcissus Roseus, this is the true Narcissus. The
second kind is very like the former, but it is somewhat bigger in every
respect, it is called of Theophrastus Leucoium, that is viola alba, and this
kind is most of all used at the Apothecaries. The third kind is like the first
in leaf and root, but a little bigger, and the flower is yellow, the
Herbarists call it Narcissus Autumnalis, but this is only to be understood of
the flower ye grows in harvest without any leaves. The roots of it is called
Colchicum, and Ephemerum, as has been said of the Hermodactyles. Nep, at the
Apothecaries Menta felina, Cattaria, it is used of diverse men for Calamintha
montana, because it has the same virtues, so that it may be done without any
harm. Nettles, that do burn, or burning nettles, Vrtica pungens, vrtica
vrens. Nettles, in Greek Acalyphe, Acalephe, Cnide, in Latin Vrtica, there
are three kinds of them, first, the great and common burning nettle which is
known to all men, this is called Vrtica mas, or Vrtica mayor. The second kind
grows not with us, but must be sown in gardens, this brings her seed in
heads like to Flax, and indeed it is not unlike to Lineseed, but that it is
somewhat less and whiter. This nettle is called of Dioscorides and Pliny,
Vrtica syluestris, and of the Herbarists vrtica Romana, vrtica Italica, vrtica
foemina. The seed of this nettle is more fit for physic than the former, and
it is also more forcible. It is called the Italian, Romish, or Garden nettle
vrtica hortulana: notwithstanding that beforetimes it has been taken for the
wild nettle. The third kind is the lesser and hoter of all, Pliny calls it
Cania, and the Herbarists vrtica minor. The seeds of all kinds of nettles are
hot in the end of the first, and dry in the second degree: the roots and
leaves do warm, resolve, and discuss. Nettles, stinking or dead nettles,
Vrtica iners, vrtica mortua, vrtica labeo, Anonium, there be commonly four
kinds of it, they are called in Greek of Dioscorides Galiopsis, and of Pliny,
Galeopsis, Galeobdolon, or Galephos, in Latin Vrtica labeo, vrtica foetida, in
English stinking nettles. The second kind is bigger and has yellowish flowers,
it is called of the Herbarists Archangelica, and archangelica lutea, or Anonium
luteum, it is also a kind of Lamium, (although Pliny do describe but one kind
of Lamium) and is called the yellow archangell. The third kind has white
flowers, the leaves are altogether like to ye nettle leaves, wherefore they are
also called dead nettles: it is called of Pliny and of the Herbarists Lamium
album, to distinguish it from the former, Archangelica alba, vrtica mortua,
vrtica iners, vrtica lactea, and Anonium album. The latter Chirurgions do call
it Herba panaritij: this is the right Lamium Plinij, and vrtica mortua, dead
Nettles, or white archangell. The fourth kind is a pretty herb, not unlike to
the nettle, with fair purple flowers, with a strong smell like to baulme; it
grows in thickets and woods, it is called of Pliny vrtica Herculanea, or
vrtica Herculea, vrtica odorata, also vrtica scarlata, and that by reason of
her strong and pleasant smell, they are also called wood nettles, vrtica
syluatica. Here is to be noted, that when dead nettles are any where
prescribed, that you must take the white archangell vrtica lactea.
O.
Oak, Quereus, Arbor Iouis. Oats, in Greek and Latin Bromus, and Auena.
Oleander, in Greek Rhododendron, Nerium, Rhododaphne, the Herbarists do call
it in Latin Laurus rosea, rosea arbor, Rosago, Oleander, and Oleandrum. It is
a tree with green leaves like to the Bay tree, but the leaves are somewhat
longer and lesser, not much unlike to the leaves of the Olive. It bears a
pleasant horseflesh colored rose, and is planted in gardens. It is hot in the
beginning of the third, and dry in the second degree. Olive tree, Olea, and
Oliua. There are two kinds of it, the tame, and the wild Olive, the tame is
named as before: the wild is called in Greek and Latin Agrielaea, Cotinus,
and olea siluestris: the tame Olive is called of Virgill Palladia arbor. Onion,
in Greek and Latin Crommyum, Cepa, Cepe, and Caepe indeclinabiliter. There
are many kinds of it, to wit, long, round, great, and small Onions, red,
brown, and yellow: the long ones are much stronger than the round, and the
yellow stronger than the white. Pliny deuideth them into two kinds, the one
does he call Cepa condimentaria, and has no head at all, but the tops are only
used, and it is called Cepa pallacana. The other kind is called Cepa Capitata.
Amongst all onions, are greatest accounted ye best for meat, they that are
flat like Turnips: they are called Cepae Africanae. Next after them are the
spanish onions, but they are less, longer, and sharper, yet bigger than any
onions in this country. There are also two kinds of them, the one is red, and
the other white, but whenever thou will use onyon seeds in any composition,
then shall thou take the seeds of our onions, for that is much more fit for
Physic, but the Spanish onions are better for meat. Orage, in Greek
Atraphaxis, and Chrysolachanum, in Latin Atriplex, Atriplexum, and olus
Aureum, it is a common potherb, cold in the first, and moist in the second
degree. Orange tree, Narantia malus. Orange of Athenaeus, in Greek Chryseon,
of Nicander Nerantzion, of Virgil Aureum malum, and of the common people Malum
Nerantium, pomum Arangiae, Arantium, and Aurantium. Organe, gross or course
Marierom, in greek and latin Origanus, or Origanum, Conila, and Cumila
gallica of Apuleius. There are 3. kinds of it, the first is called in Spanish
Dosten, in latin and greek Origanus Heracleotica, or Origanum Heracleoticum,
of Mesues Origanum Persicum, and of the Simplicists Origanum Hispanicum,
because it is brought unto us out of Spain: but we needed not to fetch it in
Spain, if we did but look about us here in Germany, we should find this
noble herb Dosten in a sufficient quantity here: but our nature and
disposition is such, that we must always have some new-fangle, and to forsake
that which is present with us. This course Marierom, or Dosten has small and
smooth leaves like to the common course Marierom, the flowers are also very
like it, but it grows somewhat higher, it has a pleasant aromaticall smell,
nothing like to the common course Marierom, it grows in great abundance near
the Rhene on the hills. The second kind of course Marierom is brought unto us
out of Candia, and it has white leaves like the spanish Dosten, it is like to
the wild Marierom, both by the stalk, flower, and also by the hairines, so
that there is no other difference between the spanish Dosten and our wild
Marierom, but that the Dosten of Candy is somewhat subtiler in sight, and
something more pleasant in smell than the other, which must be ascribed to the
nature of the country, because yt the Dosten grows there in the fields, and
ours must be planted and sown in Gardens: for we do find the same by other
plants that do also grow in fields with us, that they which grow abroad are
much stronger then they which are set in gardens, although they be greater and
more pleasant to sight. This kind of course Marierom or Organe is called of
Dioscorides and others in Greek and Latin Onitis, Origanus onitis, and of the
Herbarists Maiorana syluestris, Sampsychus syluestris, Origanum asininum,
Ouriganum, and at the Apothecaries Origanum creticum. They that use our wild
Marierom when that of Candy cannot be had, err not at all, for it is one and
the same herb. The third kind grows also in Candy, and is set in gardens
with us: it has commonly five or six stalks growing out of one root, the
leaves are very like to the wild Thyme, and the flowers like Pennyroyall, it
smells also very well, it is called in Greek Tragoriganus, in Latin
Tragoriganum, and Origanum hircinum. The fourth kind is our common Marierom,
sufficiently known by that name, it is called in greek Agrioriganus, in
latin Origanum syluestre, and of the Herbarists Organum panaceum. Note, that
if you find course Marierom in any composition, then is ye Spanish Dosten to
be taken for it, which is called Origanum Heracleoticum. Otter, in Greek
Enydris, in Latin Lutra. Ox, Bos. Oxymel, is a syrup made with Vinegar and
Honey. Oil of Spikenard, Oleum Spicaenardi, and Oleum Nardinum. Oyster, in
Greek and Latin Ostreum, of Pliny Ostrea, it is a kind of shell fish.
P.
PAlma Christi, in Greek Cici, craton, seseli cyprion, pentadactylon, and of
Erodotus, cillicyprion, in Latin of Pliny, Ricinus, Trixis, and Sesamum
agreste, of the Herbarists Palma Christi, and Manus Christi, of the
Apothecaries Cataputia mayor. The Arabians do call it Cherua, Kerua: it is a
plant common almost in every garden. The seed whereof is called granum regium,
it is hot and dry in the second or third degree. Panick, in Greek Elymus, and
Melymus, in Latin Panicum, and Panigo. Parchment, Membrana, and charta
pergamena. Parsnep, in Greek Staphylinus, in Latin Pastinaca, of the
Simplicists Carotis, and Carota. There are four especial kinds of it, the
first has yellow roots, and they are called yellow carrots, of the Herbarists
Staphylinus luteus, Carotis lutea, and pastinaca lutea, this is the most common
sort of all the tame kinds, and it is the true pastinaca satiua, but I trouble
not my self with them that seek to place another kind in stead of it, thereby
to cover their gross errors, if they did look on the true signs that
Dioscorides ascribes unto it, they would soon be led from that their
blindness, although they were but children in judgment. The second kind of
these roots is very like to the former, but that it is altogether white, and
is called of the Herbarists Carotus alba, staphylinus albus, pastinaca alba, in
English a Parsnep. The third kind are the garden Parsneps, these are most like
to the two former in leaf, root, and flower. But the root is of a dark red
color, which yields also a juice of a dark red color, but in taste it is
altogether like the foresaid. This is the true Pastinaca nigra of Theophrastus,
of the Herbarists, Staphylinus ruber, Pastinaca rubra, Carotis rubra, we call
them red carots. These three kinds are comprehended under the name of Pastinaca
satiua of Dioscorides: yet they that would have the tame Parsnep with the broad
leaf to be a kind of stone Parsley, because it is sweet in taste, I could wish
they would bethink themselves otherwise, for they two are as like, as the
Fur tree is to the Box tree. This is the true Elaphoboscum Dioscoridis, as
every one must confess that reads the description of it: Dioscorides does
also call it Ophioctonum, Corui ocellus, and Pabulum cerui. The Herbarists do
call it Pastinaca ceruina, but especially the wild kind that grows of it
self in hilly meadows, and is most like to the tame kind, differing only in
the place where they grow: also the wild kind is fitter for Physic, although
they be both used for meat. The fourth kind is the wild Parsnep, and it
grows every where in the Vineyards and corn fields, it is much like to ye
tame, or garden Parsnep, the root is whiter, and sharper in taste than of the
other, the flowers are white, and of the tame kind yellow: they that know the
wild Parsnep may also know the tame kind very well, and may soon perceive
the errors of others: it is called wild yellow carrots, or Parsnep. This is
that Parsnep that all authors will have used in physic: the Herbarists do
call it Pastinaca erratica, Staphiiinus erraticus, Carotus syluestris: the
Apothecaries do call it Baucia; others (but unjustly) Daucus, and would make
Baucia and Daucus to be one and the same. Partridge, Perdix. Paul's Betonie,
Betonica Pauli, Veronica, it is a common herb and daily used. Peach tree,
Persicus. Pear tree, Pyrus. Pearls, in Greek Margarites, Cinaedus, of
Theophrastus, and Lucianus, Erythraeus lapis, of Arrianus, lapis Indicus, of
Stratius, Erythraeus lapillus, of Virgil, Bacca and Bacca conchea, of Pliny,
Vnio, of Cicero, Margarita, and of Saint Jerome, Granum maris rubri, of others
Perla: it is a gemme or precious stone well known unto all men. Peason, Pisum:
there are diverse kinds of them, but the very best are the Hastings. Peacocke,
Pauo and Pauus in latin, of Ouidius, Iunonia auis. Pellitorie of Spain, in
greek and latin Pyrethrum, Pyritis, Pyroton, and Pes Alexandrinus: it is hot
and dry in the third degree. Pellitorie of the wall, in Greek Helxine,
Eusine, Elitis, Chanocersaea, Amelxine, Amorgine, Sucotachos, Psychuacos,
Melampelos, Anatetamenon, Polyonymon, Clibodion, Clybetis and Clybatis, in
latin Perdicium, Vrceolaris, Vitriola, of Celsus, herba Muraria, Muralium,
Vineago, herba Vrceolaris, herba Vitriaria, and of Auicenna, herba Vitri, of
Apuleius, herba Pedicularis, of the Herbarists Helxine muraria and Parietaria.
There are two kinds of it, to wit, the common Parietary, which is the biggest,
and grows every where in old walls, and it is called of the Herbarists for a
distinction Parietaria mayor. The second kind is somewat less, and grows not
outright like the former, but creeps only along the walls, and has red and
thick stalks, like to Purslaine; the leaves are like unto Purslaine, but
thin, soft and limber. This kind grows plentifully at Ponte mons, on the
city walls, and in many other places of France: also at Coblence near the
Rhene: It is most like unto the great Pellitorie in virtues and operation, they
have also an abstersive and astringent quality: they are cold and moist.
Penniroyall, in greek and latin Glechon, Blechon, Apoleium, Abuolum, and
Pulegiun^, it is hot and dry in the third degree. Pepper, in Greek Peperi,
and in Latin Piper. There are three kinds of it, white, black, and long
pepper, sufficiently known to every body: the white pepper is gathered before
it be through ripe, it is much stronger and forcibler than the black, it is
called Piper album. The black is called Piper nigrum. The long pepper is a
thing of it self, and is called Piper longum. Perwinkle, in greek Clematis,
Clematis Daphnoides, Myrsinoides, Polygonoides, Daphnoides, and of Pliny,
Chamaedaphne, in Latin Vinca peruinca, Vnicordia, Palma Virginea, Corona
Virginea, Peruinca, and Viola mortuorum. It is a common herb, and grows in
shadowy places. There is yet another kind of it, which is set in gardens, it
has a dark blew flower, and it is a little bigger in every respect than the
common sort is. It grows in diverse places of France of it self, they are
both of them hot and dry in the third degree. Petroleum, in Greek Naphta, and
of Plutarchus, Naphtas, of Nicolaus Myrepsus, Petraeleon, of Suidas, Pharmacon:
in Latin Bitumen liquidum, Bituminis Colamentum, at the Apothecaries
Petroleum, and Oleum Petrae. There are two kinds of it, the first is the white,
which is brought unto us from Naples, and out of Italy: of the black kind we
have sufficient store in Germany in the land of Bitsche, half a mile from
Werde, in the mountains, between Haganow and Weysenburch, near the town
Lamperts loch: there is a spring in a valley, that in April and May yields
as much of this oil, that the men in that place may gather as much of it as
will serve them all the Winter to burn in their Lamps, and to grease their
Cart wheels with it; of which oil the Quack-saluers and other such like
impostors do gather and fill great bottels, and then sell it again in strange
countries, as if they had fetched it far, and had hazarded their lives
greatly for to get it: which is little observed of diverse Physicians, that will
rather employ and apply themselves to the making of prognostications, in the
speculations of Astronomy, and in presaging diverse strange matters to come.
Phlegm, Slime, a waterish moisture, in Greek and Latin Phlegma, some do call
it Pituita. Pibble stone or flint, in Greek Chalix, and in latin Silex.
Pigeon, in Greek Peristera and Peristeros, in Latin Columba, and of Catullus,
Columbus. Pilewort, look Figwort in F. Pills, in greek Catapotium, of
Hippocrates, Gongylium and Gongylidium, of the common physicians Pillula and
Pilula. Pimpernell the great, Petroselinum and Apium saxatile: It is not our
common parsley, which the ancients do call Apium, as shall be showed in the
description of Smallage, but our great Pimpernell is naught else but the true
Petroselinum, which grows commonly on stony rocks or hills, and also on
walls. The first kind grows in stony fields; but in Vineyardes there
grows the bigger of the two, and it yields a yellowish juice, it has
leaves like to the great parsley: it is called of the Herbarists Pimpinella
mayor, Tragoselinum maius, and Pimpinella Hircina mayor, and in English great
Pimpernell. The second kind is somewhat less, and grows on grassie hills,
it is called Pimpinella, Pimpinella alba, Tragoselinum, and Pimpinella hircina,
without any other addition, that is the common Pimpernell. The third kind has
small iagged leaves, almost like to the crumpled parsley; it grows willingly
on stony hills, walls, and old trees, it has a very sharp root, and is the
least of all the other, it is called Tragoselinum minus, Tragoselinum petraeum,
Pimpinella minor, and Pimpinella petraea. Some authors will account these
herbs amongst the Daucos, but they do abuse them greatly, for they are the
right stone parsleys, and have the same operation with parsley. The last kind
is called the lesser Pimpernell. As often as either parsley seed, root, or
juice is mentioned in any Composition, then is the greater pimpernell to be
understood. Pingles, in Greek Strobili, Pityides, Nuclei pinei, in Latin Nuces
pineae, and of Hippocrates, Coccali. Pistactes, in Greek and Latin Pistacium
and Pistaceum, of Possidonius, Listacium, of Nicander, Psittacium, at the
Apothecaries Pistachium and Fisticum. It is a strange fruit like Hasell nuts
that grow in Syriae. The tree that bears these nuts is called Pistaceus and
Pistacius, and it is planted in gardens in Italy, France and Germany. Pitch,
Pix: there are two kinds of it, to wit, hard or stone pitch, and liquid
pitch or tar. The stone pitch is called Pix arida, Concreta, seu excocta. The
other kind is called Tar, in Latin and Greek Pissa hygra, Pix liquida, Pix
fluida. Plaster, in Greek Emplastros, in latin emplastrum. Plantaine, in
Greek and Latin Arnoglossus, Arnoglossa, Arnium, Stelephuros, Probation,
Thesarica, Tarbelodatium, of Theophrastus, Ortyx, of Apuleius, Tarbidolopium,
Plantago and Olus Agninum. There are six kinds of Plantaine, whereof the
first is the common great plantaine, that grows in all highwayes and fields,
it is known sufficiently, and is called for a difference Heptapleuron and
Polyneuron, in Latin Plantago mayor, of Apuleius, Plantago lata, and
Septineruia, of the Herbaristes Plantago rubea, Plantago latifolia, and
Multineruia. The second kind is called Sheep tongue, Pentapleuron,
Quinqueneruia, Plantago minor, Lingua Agni, and Lingua Ouina, Lingua Arietis,
and Plantago media. The third kind is called picked plantaine, or Hounds
ribbe, in Greek Hippopleuron and Cynopleuron; in Latin Plantago acuta,
Plantago lanceolata, Costa equina, Costa Canina, and Laureola: this kind
grows in meadows, it is well known to every body. The fourth kind has
round leaves like the great plaintaine, but they are somewhat less and more
limber, and each leaf has but three ribs, it grows in wooddes, and is
called of the Herbarists Plantago syluatica, Plantago trineruia, and Plantago
latifolia minor. The fifth kind is planted in gardens for pleasure, the leaves
are like unto the great plantaine, on the upper end of the stalk does it get
many little green leaves, they grow double like unto a Rose, wherefore it is
also called Rose plantaine, or Plantago Rosea. Otherwise they have the same
operations and virtues with the other plantaine. The sixth kind grows in
Wells and waterish places, it has long, broad, and sharp leaves at the end,
it is called water plantaine, of the Herbarists Plantago aquatica, Plantago
palustris, and Cochlearia palustris. But when thou find Plantaine in any
composition, then shall thou take the first kind, or the great plantaine.
Plane tree: it is not the tree which we call Opulus, but Plantanus is a tree
that grows in Italy. Plume allume, in Greek and latin Amiantus,
Bostrychites, linum viuum, linum saxatile, and at the Apothecaries Alumen
plumeum, or Alumen plumosum, which the common Physicians and Apothecaries do
falsely use for Alumen scissum, which has no likelihood with any kind of
Allume: I will omit the virtues and operations which it should have equal with
Allume, for they are as like one to another, as an apple is like an oyster.
Polypodie, in Greek and Latin Polypodium, Filicula, of Cato, Felicula: The
root of it is only used; and when you find Polipodie with addition, then is
the root only to be taken. Pomegranate tree, in greek Rhoa, Rhaea, and Sida,
in latin Malus punica, and of the common physicians Malus granata.
Pomegranates, Rhaea, Sida in greek, and in latin Malum punicum, at the
Apothecaries Malum granatum and granatum. Pompeon, in Greek Pepon, in Latin
Pepo. There are many kinds of it, first the common pompeons, known to every
body: secondly, the sugar Melons, Pepo saccharinus, Pepo muscatellinus, and
Pepo Turcicus. Poplar tree, in greek Leuce, and in latin Populus. Poppie,
Papauer satiuum. There are two kinds of it, to wit, the white and the black
poppie, the white is called of Dioscorides, Thylacites, and Papauer satiuum, or
Hortense: and at the Apothecaries Papauer album. The black which is also
placed amongst the tame kinds, is called of Dioscorides, Pithitilis, and
Papauer syluestre, and at the Apothecaries Papauer nigrum; of Hesychius is the
white poppie called Cynolephalaeon. The top or head is called in Greek
Codia, in latin Caput Papaueris: the leaf of it is called of Theocriti
Scoliastes, Platagonion. Note that wheresoever Poppie is named alone, to take
the white. Priuet, or Primprint, in Greek and latin Cyprus, Ligustrum;
Auicenna and Serapio do call it Alchanna, Alchenna, Hen, Alkanna and Alcanna:
But the Druggists and Apothecaries do call the roots of the red Ox tongue
Alcanna: Virgill does call the flowers of priuet Alba Ligustra: and Columella
does call the fruit of it Nigra Ligustura. This plant is very common in all
Europe. The leaves, flowers, and berries are in use, and they have an
astringent and drying quality. Purslaine, in greek Andrachne, in latin
Portulaca, and Porcellana: it is cold in the third and moist in the second
degree. Pineapple, in Greek and latin Strobilus and Conus. Pionie, in Greek
and latin Paeonia, Peutorobum, Glycyside, of Apuleius Glycysis, and Paeonium,
Orobelium, Orobax, Haemagonum, Paesaede, Menogenium, Menium, Panthiceratos,
Aglaophotis, and of Aelianus, Aglaophotis terrestris, Cynospastus, Dactylus
Idaeus, Theodonium, Selenium, Selenogonum, of Theophrastus, Dichomenium, of
Apuleius, Gludis, Rosa Fatuina, of Dioscorides, Herba Casta, and of Josephus
Historicus, Baaras. Dioscorides does also call it Phthisis, and Auerroes Rosa
Asinorum. The Herbarists do call it Rosa benedicta, Rosa sancta, Rosa lunaris,
or Lunaria, Rosa regia, and Rosa basilica. There are three kinds of it, which
are all planted in gardens: of the first kind, to wit, of the female, there
be two sorts, the one with fair dark red flowers, and many knottie roots,
about the thickness of ones thumb, and some less, much like to Acornes: this
is known every where. This kind is called of Dioscorides, Paeonia foemina,
and Dactylus Idaeus. The other kind is like to the former, but the leaves are
something less, and iagged, not so deep, and of a light green color, and
paler than the other: the roots are also longer and paler than the other,
almost like to the male Pionie, so that it seems to be a mixture between
both male and female. Dioscorides makes no mention of it, but Pliny calls
it Pionia mascula, and the Herbarists Paeonia foemina altera, and Paeonia
promiscua. The third kind is like to the first, with leaves and roots, the
flowers are red as blood, fair, great and double, it is called Paeonia
multiplex. The fourth kind has leaves like to the Walnut tree, the flowers
are like to the former in color, but something less, the root is white,
thick, long, and divided into two, it smells very strong and pleasant. This
is the true male Pionie, Paeonia mascula, of the ancient writers. Aetius and
others do call it Ephialtia and Ephialtium, of the Herbaristes Paeonia alba,
and Herba Diui Valentini, we call it the white Pionie: This kind is always to
be used, or else the compounded kind before named in the steed thereof.
Q.
QVicke lime, in Greek Conia and Asbestos, in Latin Calx viua, Pliny calls
it Ferrum caementorum. Quicksiluer, it is called in Greek and Latin
Hydrargyron, Argentum aqueum, and Argentum viuum, of the Alchymists Mercurius:
it is a mineral known to every body. There are two kinds of it, the one is
found in the mines, which is called Hydrargyron natiuum: the second kind is
made of Sinople, and it is called Argentum viuum, or Hydrargyron factitium. The
Alchymists do add yet three other kinds unto the former, the one made of
Lead, which they do call Mercurius Saturni: the other made of Tin, which they
do call Mercurius louis, or Fell Draconis: the third kind is made of gold,
which they call Mercurius solis, or Viscum solis: But the two first are only
used in physic, and the three last kinds, to wit, of Tin, lead, and gold,
we do commit and commend to the Alchymists. Quinces, in greek and latin
Cydoneum, and of Hesychius, Lasiomalum, of Nicander, Chnoaum, of Pliny Malum
lanatum, of Virgil Malum canum, of others Cotoneum, Malum Cotoneum, malum
Cydonium, and at the Apothecaries Cydonium and Cittonium. There are three
kinds of them, the lesser yellow Quinces that are so odoriferous, are most
common and most fit for physic. The other kind is bigger and longer like a
pear, and in color pale yellow, much slighter both in taste and smell than
the former: this kind is called in Greek and Latin Struthium and
Struthiomelum: the Simplicistes do call it Cydonium maius, Cotoneum maius, and
Pyrum Cydonium. The third kind is the middle sort: both the former are graffed
from a tree on a stalk of another, this kind is called of Pliny Malum
milianum, and of the Simplicists Cydonium, or Cotoneum nothum, with us the
bastard Quince. The first and least are the very best, then the bastard
Quinces, and the worst are the greatest.
R.
RAdish, in Greek and Latin Raphanus, or Raphanis, Radix and Radicula.
Ragwort, Dogs stones, Gandergrasse, in Greek Satyrion, of Apuleius Panion, in
Latin Satyrium, of Mesues, Testiculus Vulpis, and of Apuleius, Testiculus
Leporinus. There are two kinds of it known to Dioscorides, but we have many
kinds with us which we do know, amongst which Orchis and Orchis Serapias are
placed. Theophrastus Plinius and Apuleius have comprehended them under the name
of Satyrium, and confounded them together. The first and true Satyrium is
called of Dioscorides in Greek Satyrion triphyllon, or Satyrium trifolium. The
second kind is called read Ragwort, of Dioscorides in Greek Satyrion
Erithronicon, Satyrium Erithraicum, and Satyrion Erythron, of Apuleius,
Entaticum, Priapicum, and Satyriscus: in Latin Molorticulum Veneris, Melium
aquaticum, Testiculus Satyri, and Arrectorium. The third kind is called
Satyrium regium, or Satyri^m basilicum, of the Herbarists Manus Christi, Palma
Christi, and Palma Veneris, the Arabians do call it Bucheiden and Buzeiden, of
Auicenna, Digitus crinitus, Satyrium basilicum maius mas. The fourth kind is
like to the former, but the leaves are full of spots, it is called of the
Herbarists Satyrium Basilicum maius foemina, and Lacryma Mariae. The fifth
kind has small leaves like to Saffron, it bears a fair purple flower with
a pleasant smell: the roots are also like the two other small hands. The
Herbarists do call it Satyrium basilicum, or regium minus, Satyrium odoratum,
Amaranthus vencris, Palma Christi minor, Palmula Christi, or Palmula Veneris.
The sixte kind has leaves like to the white Lilly, but narrower and lesser,
it has two kinds of flowers, the one is of a dark red color, like to that of
Hartwort, the other as white as snow. This kind has two roots of the bigness
of an Olive, and very sweet in taste: Dioscorides calls it in Greek Orchis
and Cynosorchis, in Latin Testiculus, and Testiculus canis: the Herbarists do
call it Orchis mayor mas. The seventh kind is somewhat like the first, but that
the leaves be less, it bears a flower of a Chestnut color, it is called of
the Herbarists Orchis mas minor. The eight kind has soft leaves, not unlike
the Lilly leaves, but somewhat less; the flowers are partly of a dark red
color, and partly incarnation, with many white strakes, the roots are like
Cocks stones, it is called of the Herbarists Orchis foemina mayor. The ninth
kind is much less than the former, but very like the same in flowers, leaves
and roots, it is called of the Herbarists Orchis foemina minor. Some do call
it Orchis odorata or Testiculus odoratus, it grows on dry hills. The tenth
kind has lesser leaves than the white Lillies, the flowers are purple, it has
three roots, much less than Olives, whereof two are of one bigness, and the
third less and longer, so that these three are like the member of a man. It is
called in Greek of Dioscorides Orchis serapias, of Aegyneta Triorchis, of
Apuleius Serapion. Yet are there three kinds more, whereof we have spoken
elsewhere. Otherwise there is another kind of this herb, which is placed with
the Cynosorchis, or Testiculus canis, which here for breuities sake we do
omit. The Apothecaries do use all the former kinds of Ragwort for Satyrium,
without any difference: and although there be but a small difference between
all these kinds in operation, yet it were better only to use that which has
three leaves like Lillies for the true Satyrium, for it is the Satyrium of the
ancient Physicians, to the end no error be committed. All these beforenamed
herbs and roots are hot and moist, and have an attractiue virtue. Raisons, in
Greek Astaphides, and Staphides, in Latin Vuae passae, at the Apothecaries
Passulae. There are three kinds of them in use: the first kind is the best,
and are called Vuae damascenae, and Vuae zibebae, at the Apothecaries Zibebae,
and Passulae damasceuae. The second kind is somewhat le^^e, they are brought
from Cypers, Spain, and Prouence, they are the best in virtue and operation,
and also in taste, and are called of the Physicians Vua passae maiores, Vuae
massilioticae, at the Apothecaries Passulae maiores. The third kind are the
Currants, and are called in Greek Apyrine, in Latin Vuae passae Corinthiacae,
Passulae Ciliciae, Passulae Chemesinae, that is, Passulae sine nucleis, and at
the Apothecaries Passulae minores: but when we find in any composition
Passulae, then are these to be taken. The Arabian physicians call them Kesmes
and Chesmes, that is, Raisons without stones. Ram, in Greek Crios, and in
Latin Aries. Rapes, in Greek Gongyla, Gongylis, in Latin Rapa, Rapum, and
Golsonium is called in Greek Raphys, and Rapys. These Rapes or Turnips are of
four kinds, for some are round, some long, some white, some small, some
great, but we need not make any long rehearsal of them, seeing they have all
one kind of operation. There are certain Turnips sown in Lottering, and in
the upper Burgundy, to the end to make oil of their seeds, but this kind of
Turnips is wild, and altogether unfit for meat, but the seed is more fit for
physic than that of the tame Rapes. This kind is called in Greek Gongylis
agria, and in Latin Rapum syluestre. Rapontica, in Greek and latin
Centaurium magnum, Maro, Maronia, and of Apulcius Maronium, Plectronia,
Pelethronia, Chironia, and of the Magicians Sanguis Herculis, Limnestis,
Nessium, Vnefera: the Herbarists do call it Pseudoraponticum, at the
Apothecaries is it unto this day falsely called Rhaponticum, and Rhapontica,
because their unskillful physicians do take it to be ye same, where
nevertheless the true Rhaponticum may be had sufficiently. But these blind
bayards have so dazelled their eyes with gazing at the stars, that they are
blind though they seem to see, and they do draw and hold other men into their
errors. The true Rapontica is a root outwardly dark, gray, and less than the
common Rapontica, and spongeous: also being broken, it has many white veins
much like to Rubarb, with an astringent taste, it is brought unto us from
Pontus. This is in use amongst curious and careful Physicians. It is called
with us pontish Rubarbe, to distinguish it from the root of the great
Centorie, which we do commonly call Rapontica. It is called in Greek Rha,
Rheon, Rheum, in latin Raponticum, Rapontica, Rheum ponticum, Rheon ponticum,
of Pliny Rhacoma or Rhecoma, of Celsus Radix pontica. Rhapontium, it is called
of the Herbarists Rapuntium, Rapontium, Rapunculum, Raponcellus, Raponculus,
and Pes locustae, it is a kind of wild Rapes, of which there is yet another
kind, it grows commonly in shaddowie woods, it has round leaves below, and
bears a brown purple and hairy flower, and a thick root, it is very sweet
in taste as the former also is, they are both used in sallads and in meats.
The second kind is called the wild Rapuntium, the Herbarists do call it
Rapontium, Rapunculus syluaticus, and Rapontium Alopecorum. Raspes, at the
Apothecaries Ribes, it is a kind of Ceanothus Theophrasti, which we do call
Gooseberries, and they are like in every respect, but that the Raspes has no
thorns, and they may be used in stead of the Gooseberies. The Raspes are cold
and dry in the second degree. Raven, in Greek Corax, in latin Coruus. Red
Arsenicke or Orpiment, Sandaraca Graecorum, and at the Apothecaries
Auripigmentum rubrum. Red lead, in Greek Sandix and Syricum, in latin Minium
secundarium, of Vitruuius Sandaracha, at the Apothecaries Minium, of
Dioscorides and Pliny also Minium. It is our Sinople Cinnabaris Metallica, but
red lead is made of lead, which is burned or calcined until it be red. This is
used most commonly in salues and plasters, and especially in the vnguentum
Syricinum mesuis, which the unskillful sort do call vnguentum Sericinum, and
they do suppose that Syricum should be Sericum, and so in stead of red lead
they put silk into salve. Red Poppie, Corn Roses, in Greek Mecon Rhoeas, and
Oxygonum, in latin Papauer erraticum, of Geza Papauer fluidum, and of others
Papaueralis and Papauerina, of the Herbarists Papauer caducum, Papauer
puniceum, Papauer caninum, papauer Rhoeas, rosella, and at the Apothecaries
Papauer rubrum. There is another kind of it very like the former, but much
less, whereof each flower has but four leaves, it grows in the Rye and
Wheat, and it is called the lesser red Poppie: The Herbarists do call it
Papauer erraticum minus, Papaueralis, and papauerina minor, it has also the
same virtues with the former. Reed, in Greek and latin Calamus, Arundo, and
Harundo, the Apothecaries call it Canna. Pliny in his sixteenth book and 36.
chapter, and in the 24. book and 11. chapter, accounts 29. kinds of them,
but we do acknowledge but six kinds of them, whereof the first is called
Nastos, that is, hard and compact, and smooth between the joints, whereof the
arrows were wont to be made, it is called Sagittaria Arundo, and Calamus
Sagittarius. The second kind is the female, whereof the Cornets tongues are
made, and it is called of Dioscorides Calamus foemina, and of Pliny Calamus
Auliticus. The third kind is called in Greek Syringias, in latin Calamus,
and Arundo fistularis, and it is hollow from one end to the other: there are
writing pens made of it, and it is without knots, wherefore it is called
Harundo enodis. The fourth kind is also hollow and thick, it grows in ponds
and great lakes, in Greek Donax, in latin Harundo Cypria, Calamus Cyprius,
Harundo aquatica. The fifth kind is thick and strong, it is used for hedges,
it is called in Greek Phragmites, and of Theophrastus Characias, in latin
Callamus vallaris, and vallatorius, Harundo vallatoria, Harundo sepiaria, and
sepicularis. The sixth kind is planted in gardens in diverse places of Francs and
of Germany, it is fair, great, and pleasant to sight, it is brought unto us
from India, and therefore it is also called Arundo Indica. Some call it Spanish
Canes or Reed, because it was first brought unto us from Spain. Rice, in
latin and Greek Oriza, Risum, Rizum, of Theophrastus Orizum, at the
Apothecaries Oriza: it is known to every body. Rocket, look Mustard seed the
white in M. Roebucke, in Greek Dorx, in latin Capreus, of Virgill Capreolus.
Rose, in Greek Rhodon, of Theocriti Scoliastes, and of Homer Thronon, in
latin Rosa. There are many kinds of it, to wit, the tame Roses which are
planted in gardens, are in number seven several kinds: of the wild ones are
four kinds, which is in all eleven kinds. The first kind is of a dark
blood red color, and are common in all gardens, some are single, some double,
and are called of Pliny Rosa milesia, of the Herbarists Rosa purpurea and
punicea. The second kind is of a light red color, it is called of Pliny Rosa
trachinea, of the Herbarists Rosa rubra: at the Apothecaries and of the common
people are they called Rosa rubra, and red Roses without any distinction,
neither skils it greatly, by reason they are all one in virtues and operations.
The third kind is the incarnation Rose with a pleasant smell, and are called
Prouence Roses, of Pliny Rosa Alabandica, of the Herbarists Rosa prouincial^s,
Rosa persica, Rosa incarnata, and at the Apothecaries Rosa purpurea: this kind
of Roses are laxatiue, and are used for the laxatiue sirupe of Roses. The
fourth kind are the double white garden Roses, the commonest amongst all tame
kinds, and are called Rosa alba. The fifth kind is also white, and has bin
known with us but of late years, but they are somewhat less, and pleasanter
to the sight than the former white Roses are, many of them being double grow
together upon one branch, but six of them are scant so big as one of the
tame ones, yet very pleasant in smell: some do call them white Musk Roses, any
other name as yet is not known. The sixth kind of tame Roses is the yellow
Rose, every where common and known, without any smell, and altogether unfit
for physic: the Herbarists do call it Rosa lutea, rosa Aegyptia, rosa
Africana, and rosa Vulpina. The seventh kind are the pleasant Damask roses,
they are called of Pliny Rosa coroneola, of the Herbarists Rosa moscata, or
rosa muscata, Rosa syriaca, rosa Damascena, and rosa Alexandrina. The first
kind of wild Roses are called hedge Roses or wild Roses, they are called in
Greek Cynorhodon, of Hesichius Cynocentron, of Galen Cynomoron, in Latin
Canirubus, and Rosa canina: some do call it Eglenteria and Englenteria. The
second kind of wild Roses are much less than the first, and are of an
incarnation color like the former, but they are very fragrant, as well the Rose
as the leaf of it: it grows in hedges and on hills, and is called of the
Herbarists Rosa diuae Mariae, Spina diuae Mariae, Oenorhodon, vinirosa, and
rosa cinamomina. The third kind of wild Roses grows here and there in tilled
fields, and especially in fields of Oats near the Rhene, it is the very least
kind of all wild Roses, but it has bigger leaves, inwardly purple colored,
it is called of the Herbarists Chamaerhodon, Rosa pumila, Rosa Aruensis, and
Rosa auenaria. This kind of Roses is so odoriferous, that it seems to excel
all tame kinds. The fourth kind of wild Roses is very like the former, they
are also white roses without any smell, they blow very late, to wit, in June,
they grow on dry hills and fields, and are called white field Roses: the
Herbarists do call them Rosa campestris, it is most contemptible of all other
kinds. Amongst all these kinds are the double and single red Roses the very
best that may be used for Physic, and in like manner also the Oaten roses:
wherefore if one find Roses without any addition in any mixture, then are the
red or Oaten roses to be taken for it. Rosemary, in Greek and Latin Libanotis
coronaria, of Apuleius, Icteritis, herba Salutaris, and libanotis coronalis, of
the Herbarists Dendrolibanum, Rosmarinus coronarius, and libanotis coronaria,
to distinguish it from the other kind of libanotis, which is called by them
Libanotis vmbellifera: the Apothecaries call it Rosmarinus: it is a well known
plant, and so common in the Provinces that they make bauens of it to heat their
Ouens withal, and here with us it grows only in gardens. Rosin, Resina
pinus, and resina: but Resina is a common name for all gummes, but because that
rosin is daily in use, it is called resina: the other gums are named with
additions: wherefore whenever you find rosin in any composition, then shall
you understand the resina pinus. Rubarbe, in Greek Rhaeon barbaricon, and
Rhaeonbarbarum, Rhaeumbarbarum, Rhasceniticum, Rhemusceniticum, and Radix
barbarica. Rubie, there are six kinds of it, the first and most precious is
the Carbuncle, which is clear, fiery, and perspicuous above all other gemmes,
it is called in Greek Apyrotus and Anthracites, in Latin Carbunculus. The
other kind of Carbuncle is the rubie, a well known precious stone, and it is
called Carbunculus, Amethystizon, in Greek Anthrax Amethystizon, and Pyropus,
and at the Apothecaries Rubinus: this is next the the Carbuncle, and very much
used. The third kind is the Granate. The fourth kind is somewhat paler than the
other former kinds, it is of a light red color, it is called in high Dutch
Ballas, in Greek Astrios, or Asterios, of Augustine in the 21. book de
ciuitate Dei, Aster: of the Druggists Balagius, Ballasius, Pallasius, Pallenaea
gemma, Ballenaea g^mma, Carbunculus candidus, and Spinalus. The fifth kind is
of a yellowish red and light in color, it is called in Greek and Latin
Lychnis, Lychnites, Carbunculus giluus, and Carbunculus pallidus. The sixth
kind is called Carbunculus alabandicus, and Lapis alabandicus. Amongst all
these kinds are only the Rubie and the Granate in use for physic. Rue, in
Greek and Latin Peganum, Rhyte, and Ruta. There are four kinds of it, to
wit, two tame, and two wild: the two tame kinds are so like that they can
hardly be distinguished, if one look not well upon them, and they are used
without any difference one for the other. The first kind of wild Rue is called
Rue of the mountains, of Dioscorides, Ruta montana, or Rhyte montana: this is
most like to the garden Rue, but that it is much less, it grows here and
there on the hills in Italy, but with us it is set in gardens. The second kind
of Rue grows in diverse places of Germany of it self, and it is also
otherwhiles set in gardens: it has longish leaves, a strong and unpleasant
smell, and white flowers, out of which three square heads do grow that contain
the seed, somewhat bigger than those of the common Rue, and by the name of
wild Rue is this commonly understood. The other wild or mountain Rue, is only
called Rue: this last kind is called in greek Peganon agrion, of Galen, Moly,
A^mala, Harmal^, and Besasa: but Moly is another plant with Dioscorides and
Hippocrates. The Herbarists do call this wild Rue with Dioscorides Ruta
syluestris. Auicenna and the Arabians do call it Alharmel, Armel, and Harmel.
Some unskillful Physicians do take Hemlocke for Harmel or Ruta syluestris, and
so do they follow their blind leaders Mathaeus Syluaticus, and Iacobus
Manlius, that have composed the Lumen maius, and have translated Harmel for
Cicuta, and have expounded Armel to be the wild Rue, all which is most false:
for it is most true that Armala and Harmala of the Greeks, and Alharmel,
Alarmel, Armel, and harmel of the Arabians, is one and the same plant, to wit,
wild Rue, which Galen does call Moly; wherefore these fellows do lie falsely,
and shall not be able to make answer for it hereafter, that they do mix the
seeds of Hemlocke in the pillulae foetidae and aggregatiuae in stead of the
seeds of wild Rue, thereby not only deceiving the people, but hurting and
spoiling them; so that great heed ought to be taken in all places where these
pills are prepared with the seed of Hemlocke in stead of the seed of wild
Rue, which I could not omit at this present to show and make known to the
Reader; for to use venom in stead of Rueseede is no small error.
S.
SAffron, in Greek and in Latin Crocus, Crocum, and Cynomorphus, of the
Magicians Sanguis Herculis, of Serapius and Auicenna Sahaferam. It is called
barbarously Saffranum. The very best Saffron that is to be had in Europe is the
Dutch Saffron, which is set about Vienna and Spier in Germany. Sage, in Greek
Elelisphacos and Crosmis, in Latin Saluia, of Apuleius Corsaluium. There are
four kinds of it, two tame, and two wild: the first is called great Sage, or
broad Sage, in Latin Saluia mayor. The second kind is the lesser or eared
Sage, in Latin Saluia Cruciata, Saluia Auriculatae, Saluia minor, Saluia
Acuta, and Saluia nobilis. The third kind is the first of the wild Sages,
which Theophrastus calls Sphacelus: it grows commonly among Chestnut trees,
and upon woody hills, it has greater, rougher, and more wrinkled leaves than
the great garden Sage has, and it looks as if it were withered with dries,
it has a pretty blew flower. The fourth kind is the second wild Sage, which
is known to diverse by that name, and is called Saluia Syluestris, Saluia
Bosci, Boscisaluia, Scorodiana, Scordiana, of Cordus Scorodiana. By Sage
without any addition shall thou understand the garden Sage. Saint John's wort,
Hypericon, Perforata and Fuga daemonum, of the Herbarists Ruta Solis, herba
Solis, it is a common and well known herb, hot and dry by nature. Saint John's
bread, in Greek Xylocerata, or Xylocaracta, at the Apothecaries and of
Actuarius Carrubia: Others do call it panis diui Iohannis, it is the fruit of
a tree, longish and sweet, and has certain kernels within it. Sal Ammoniac,
it is called Sal Armoniacus, or Sal Harmoniacus, and at the Apothecaries Sal
Armoniacum. This Salt was wont to be dug out of the Sands in Africa, and
was thence brought unto us, which now a days we want: But there is another
chimicall Salt, made of piss and other things, used in stead of the former,
the which of many unskillful men is taken and used as well inwardly as outwardly
for the right Sal Ammoniac; but woe to them that take it inwardly. But because
that we cannot get of the right Sal Ammoniac any more, we may use in this place
the stone Salt, or Salt of the mines, which is a kind of the true Sal
Ammoniac, and has also the same virtue and operation. I would with no man to
use the common Sal Ammoniac inwardly. Sallamander, in Greek Molge, in Latin
Salamandra: it is a very venomous worm like to a great Euet, with black and
yellow spots, it lives commonly in the water, and poysoneth the same. Salt,
Sal. There are four kinds of it: the common salt is called of Cato Sal
popularis. The second, called Sal Marinus, is made of the Sea water, in English
bay Salt. The third kind is Sal palustris. The fourth is stone salt, Sal
Fossitius, Sal Crystallinus, or Sal Montanus. Saltpeter, Nitrum. Niter, and Sal
Petrae: the Arabians do call it Baurach, it is a kind of natural Salt. Some
do falsely use the common Saltpeter for it, which is a great deceit. Sanicle,
in Latin Sanicula, and Sennicula. There are three kinds of it, which now a
days are called by the names of Sanicle. The first kind and their true
Sanicle, has leaves like to the Vine, but somewhat less, and divided into
five several parts: it continues green all the winter time, and is known
by many men by the name of Sanicle, and is properly called Sanicula,
otherwhiles to distinguish it from the other kinds, Diapensia, Sanicula
Quinquefolia, Sanicula Vitiginea, and Feraria Minor. The second kind grows
on high snowie hills, and has fat leaves, not much unlike to Plantaine: The
flowers are somewhat like to Cowslips, some blew, some purple colored: The
Herbaristes do call it Arctocium, Auricula Vrsi, Paralytica Alpina, Sanicula
Alpina, and Arthritica Alpina. The third kind of Sanicle grows on high,
wooddie, and cold hills, it has leaves almost like Angelica, and a black
hairie root. It is called of the Simplicistes Sanicula Foemina, or Astrantia
nigra, in English she or female Sanicle. But this has another operation than
the Sanicle, for the root of it purges like Ellebore, for which cause it is
of some called Sanicula Cathartica. The Herbarists call it wild Angelica. But
where and whenever Sanicle is found in any Composition without any addition,
then shall thou understand the first kind of it. Sapphire stone, in Greek and
Latin Sapphirus, by Marbodeus Syrtites, and at the Apothecaries Saphirus.
There are four kinds of it, of the blew which is known by that name, we have
spoken before. And to distinguish it from the others, it is called Saphyrus
Caeruleus; and Dionysius Afer calls it Cyaneus Saphirus. The second kind
declineth somewhat from the blew to the green, and is called in Greek
Prasitis, and Saphirus Prasitis. The Druggistes do call it Saphirus Viridis,
in English, a green Sapphire. The third kind declineth from the blew to the
yellow, and is called in Greek Chrysitis, and Saphirus Chrysitis: of the
Simplicists Saphirus Aureus, in English the yellow Sapphire. The fourth kind is
between blew and white, in color like Buttermilke, altogether perspicuous and
clear, called Saphirus candidus, in English the white Sapphire. Sarcocolla, in
Latin Sarcocolla, or Caruglutinum, at the Apothecaries Gummi Sarcocolla, of
Serapius and other Arabian writers Anzarot or Anzarut, it is a gum of a
thorn in Persia much like to Frankincense. Sauery, in Greek and Latin
Thymbra, Cunila, and Satureia: there are two kinds of it, and there is no
difference between them both, but that the wild kind grows of it self,
and is called Thymbra, and Cunila Rustica. The other kind is planted in
gardens, and is more sauourie and acceptable to meat than the former: but for
physic, the wild has more virtue than the other. It is hot and dry in the
third degree. Sauine or Sauine tree, in Greek Bathy, Brathus, B^rathrum, and
Barithon: In Latin Sabina and Sauina: It is a well known shrubbe. There are
two kinds of it, the one has rough leaves like to the Cipres tree: the other
like the leaves of the Tamariske; they are both of them planted in the gardens
with us, they are both attenuating and drying in the third degree. Saunders, in
Greek and Latin Santalum, Santalus, and of Actuarius Xylon Santalon, that is,
Lignum Santalum. There are three kinds of it, that are all brought unto us
from the Indies, to wit, yellow, white, and read Saunders, all of them very
common and well known at all Apothecaries. The yellow kind is called Sandalum
Flauum, and at the Apothecaries Sandalum citrinum. The Arabians call it
Santalum Machoziri, Mazahari, and Machazari, that is, Santalum Aromaticum, or
Santalum odoriferum, because it is the very best, and most fragrant of all the
kinds. The red Saunders are called Santalum Rubrum, of others Rhodosantalum,
that is, Santalum Rosaceum, and at the Apothecaries Santalum Rubeum. The white
Saunders are called Sandalum album. The best Saunders amongst all of them is
the yellow kind, next to that the white, and last of all the red. Whenever
one finds Saunders in any receipt without addition, then is there the yellow
Saunders always understood. There is also a false kind of read Saunders
found at some Apothecaries, not unlike to the true read Saunders, yet without
any smell at all: this is a kind of Brasill, but it has a darker read
color: The Druggists call it Sondalum Spurium; it may be called in English,
bastard Saunders, neither ought it by any means to be used in Physic.
Scabious, of the Herbarists in Latin Sabiosa, and Herba Apostematica. There
are five kinds of it, all of one virtue and operation. Psora Aetij is that
common Scabious used at all Apothecaries. Scammonie, in Greek and Latin
Scamonium, or Schamonia, Apopleumenon, Dactylion, and Sanilum, of the
Simplicists Volubilis Syriaca, Volubilis Antiochena, and Volubilis Colophonia:
Dioscorides calls it Colophonium, and Sanilum: at the Apothecaries Schamonea,
and of the Arabians Sachmunia. It is a plant that grows in Syria near
Antiochia. It has long sappie stalks, three square leaves, and white flowers
like belles. It has also a long sappie root as thick as ones arms, and white
in color. Dioscorides calls this root Radix Colophonia, and Radix
Schambonia. The juice which is pressed out of this root is also called as the
plant Schamonia, or Scamonium. Some do call this juice in Greek only
Diacrydion, that is, Lacrymula, and at the Apothecaries Schamonea. But our
Physicians now a days do understand by Diacrydion only the prepared
Scammonie, which the common Apothecaries and Physicians do call Dagridium or
Diagridium, and Schamonia preparata. Scorpion, Scorpius, Scorpio, a marvelous
venomous little beast, in Italy and other countries very common. If it bite or
sting a man, and that he uses no present remedy for it, he is constrained to
die. Sea balls, in Greek Sphaera thalassia, of Galen in Latin Sphaera
Marina, Pila marina, at the Apothecaries Balla marina, and Nicolaus Myrepsus
calls it Palla marina: Dioscorides does name it Prunum Genus Aicionij. It is
a kind of Sea sponge dried, and round like a ball, whence it has the name pila
marina. Sea Mussels, Concha marina, Conchilium marinum. Sea Wormwood, in
Greek and Latin Absinthium thalassium, Absinthium marinum, Absinthium
Seriphium, Helmintobatane, Helmintopaea, Seriphon and Serifluum, at the
Apothecaries Sementina, or Zina. The seed of it is only used at the
Apothecaries to kill and expel the Worms of the belly, they call it Semen
Zina, Semen Lumbricorum, Semen Alexandrinum, and Semen Zedoariae. In Prouence
that is in France, is another kind of sea wormwood, or wormeseede found, which
is very like the garden Cypres, but it has less store of seed than the
former, and in the expulsion of worms altogether as forcible. This plant is
called Santonicum, Absinthium Santonicum, at the Apothecaries Sandonicum,
Sanctonicum, Absinthium Sanctonicum, Centonica, and Herba centonica. By all
these names do they also understand the Wormeseede, or sea Wormwood, for they
do confound these and many others more. They do call the seed Semen
Sandonicum, and Semen Sanctum, by which they do understand both the former
seeds. Selfeheale, Prunella, and Herba Diui Anthonij. Seen leaves, are called
in Greek, Latin, and in the Arabian tongue Sena, and Senna. Mesues called
them with a Persian name Abalzemer. There are two kinds of them, the lesser
grows in Syria and Egypt, and are called (to distinguish them from the
others) Sena Syriaca, Sena Aegyptiaca, and at the Apothecaries Sena
Alexandrina, and Sena Orientalis. The greater Seen leaves do grow in Italy and
elsewhere, these are called of the Simplicsts Sena Italica, or Sena
Prouincialis, and at the Apothecaries Sena Florentina. They are much weaker in
operation and virtues than the lesser kind, and therefore more unfit for
physical uses. Some there are that affirm Sena to be a kind of Colutea.
Others would have the Colutea Theophrasti to be Sena, or at the least a kind
of the same, but both of them do err. Look also in the Introduction of this
book for Seen leaves. Service tree, in greek Oa or Oe, in latin Sorbus: it is
a well known tree, whereof the fruit is called in latin Sorbum, and it is like
to a little pear. Sebestes, are little black berries, called in Greek Myxa or
Myxaria, of Actuarius in latin Sebestena, and at the Apothecaries Sebesten.
They are black berries, as big as hasell nuts, or little small dried prunes,
they are well known at all Apothecaries. Sheep, Ouis. Shepherds purse, Bursa
pastoris, and Pera pastoris. Silkewormes neastes, Folliculus Bombycis, they are
called in latin Sericum crudum, or Sera cruda, at the Apothecaries Seta cruda.
Silver, in greek Argyros and Argyrion, and in latin Argentum.
Siluermountaine, in Greek and latin Seseli, and of Pliny Seselis and Sili,
of the Herbarists Seselium, at the Apothecaries Siselenos, and Seselios,
indeclinabiliter. There are five kinds of it, the first, has leaves like
Fennel, but somewhat bigger, with a smooth stalk, the flowers are not unlike
to them of Dill, and after them follows a little sharp seed: the root is
long and odoriferous, and it grows on stony hills. It is called in Greek
Seseli Massilioticum, and Platycyminum, in Latin Seseli Massiliense. The
Herbarists do call it Seselium Massiliense: at the Apothecaries Siseleos,
Siler montanum, in English Siluermountaine, or Silermountaine. The second kind
is called Siluermountaine of Aethiopia, the stalk is of the thickness of a
finger, wooddie, and of a dark red color. The leaves of it are very like to
them of Honysuckles: they are smoothe, and pale green in color. It has upon
it four or five goodly yellow tops like Fennel, but the seed is somewhat
bigger than that of Fennel. It is called in Greek and Latin Cynophrycon,
Seseli Aethiopicum, and of the Simplicists Seseli Aethiopicum Fruticans. The
third kind is our common black Siluermountaine, which of many is taken for
Seseli Aethiopicum, because it has the same virtues and operations. But the
Herbarists do call it Seseli, or Seselium Aethiopicum Herbaceum, thereby to
distinguish it from the aforenamed. The fourth kind is our white
Siluermountaine, called in Greek and latin Seseli Peloponnesiacum, Seseli
Peloponnese, and of the Herbarists Seselium Ceruinum Album. The fifth kind is
the Tordylium of Dioscorides. This herb as yet is not thoroughly known, because
the description of it is so briefly set down by the ancient writers, which do
only make mention of the seed of it. This is called in greek Tordylion,
Tordylon, of Pliny Syreon, of Paulus Aegineta Gorgylon, and in latin Seseli
Creticum. But when and wheresoever thou find Siluermountaine or Siselios in
any composition, then and there shall thou always understand and use the first
kind of Siluermountaine. Sinober or Sinople, Vermillion, in Greek Cinnabaris,
in Latin Cinnabrium. There are two kinds of it, the first is natural, and
dug out of the Mine: it is called in Greek Miltos Ammion, in latin of
Dioscorides and Pliny, Cinnabaris Fossilis, Minium Natiuum, in English Sinober
of the Mine. The other kind is made by the Alchimistes of Quickesiluer and
Brimstone, and it is called of the Simplicists Cinnabaris Factitia, Cinnabrium
Artificiale, and Minium Artificiale, with us Vermilion. Siuet, in Greek of
Actuarius Zapetion, in latin of the Simplicists Zibethum, Zibettum, Alg^lia,
and at the Apothecaries Zibeta: It is the fat or suet which is taken from the
cods of the Siuet or musk Cat: at the first it smells very badly, but
afterward turns to so fragrant an odor that it far surpasses the Musk
and Ambergreece: it is hot and moist by nature. It is used for the increase of
humane seed, and for the infirmities of the Matrix. Sloe tree, or black
Thorn, in Greek Agriococcymelea, and Coccymelea agria. In Latin P^unus
syluestris, and of Virgill Spinus. Smallage, in Greek and Latin Eleoselinum,
Hydroselinum, Apium Palustre, and Paludapium. Here is to be noted, that as
often as any mention is made in this book of Smallage seeds, leaves, juice,
or roots, that the greater Pimpernell roots are always to be understood for
it, for that is the right Apium of the ancient Physicians. Smaragde, in Latin
and Greek Smaragdus, of Horatius, lapis viridis: it is a green precious
stone. Snake, Serpens, Anguis. Snayle, Cochlea terrestris, a Snayle house and
all. The house of the Snayle is called in G^eeke by Dioscorides Celyphos, of
Galen Ostracon, of Scammonicus Cochleae domus, and of Pliny Calyx. The vine
Snayles and garden Snayles are called Cochlea opercularis. The dew Snayles are
called Limax and Cochlea nuda. Solidago media, Sengreene, in latin Symphytum
medium, Solidago media, Consolida media, Consolidago media. Soote of the
chimney, Fuligo caminorum. Sophia, in Greek and Latin Thalietrum, and
Thalictrum, of the Chirurgions and Herbarists Sophia, and Herba Sophiae. Some
authors would have this herb to be Absinthium Seriphium, but they shall never
approve it to be true, for although they were the greatest Alchimists in the
world, yet should they never transmute the one into the other. This Sophia I
will not deny to be very good for the Worms of the belly, yet does it not
thereby follow that it is Absinthium Seriphium, for if all the herbs should be
of Sinchia Scriphia, that should expel worms, then should we have an infinite
company of them. Of this Absinthium Seriphium look under the title of sea
Wormwood. Soap, in Greek and Latin Smegma, or Sapo, of Martialis, Mattiaca
Pila. Soap is prepared diversely, but amongst all others is the black Soap best
for Physic. Sorrel, in Greek of Dioscorides Oxalis, Anaxyris, and Lapathon,
of Galen Oxylapathum. Dioscorides does otherwhiles call the Docke Oxylapathum,
because it has picked leaves: But Galen does not call Sorrel by this name,
because it has picked leaves, but that it is amper and sower: for Oxylapathum
is Lapathum Acidum, sower Docke: the Apothecaries do call it Acetosa. There are
four kinds of it: The first, is that which grows every where in gardens.
The second kind is as big again as the common Sorrel, and grows very
plentifully in the Vineyardes near Rhene: It is also planted in gardens for
Sallads, and is called Oxalis satiua, or Acetosa satiua. The third kind is set
in the gardens in France, and high Burgundy, it has round leaves, and is much
sowrer than the common Sorrel, it might be called round Sorrel, of the
Herbarists Oxalis Rotundafoi^^, Acetosa rotunda, Oxalis Francia, and Oxalis
Gallica. The fourth kind of Sorrel grows in the common fields, and dry
places, it has small narrow leaves, and may be called Sheep or wild
Sorrel: of the Herbaristes Oxalis Tenuisolia, Oxalis minor, Oxalis Veruecina,
and Oxalis Arueneis: at the Apothecaries Acetosa mionr, and Acetosa ouina. But
as often as you read Sorrel in any composition, thou shall always understand
the common Sorrel, although the round be the best. Sower milk, in Greek of
Pliny Oxygala, in Latin Lac Acidum, or Lac Acetosum. Sowes bread, or Swines
bread, in Greek Cyclaminus, Ichthiotheron, and Chelonium, that is,
Icestudinaria, and Chyline: in Latin Cyclamen, Vmbilicus terrae, Rapum terrae,
Rapum porci, Orbicularis, and Herba orbicularis, Triumphalites, panis Terrae,
Arthanita and Harthanita. Of the barbarous writers, Panis Alcurst, Panis fauni,
Cassamum, Cassanum, and Quassamus. Of the Arabian Physicians Bothor Mariae. It
is a root, whose leaf is like to Hartwort, but somewhat litherer, and fuller
of spots. There is yet another kind of Sowes bread which is very like to the
former, but somewhat less, no bigger than a gall; this grows in Apulia, on
the hill Garganum, it is called Cyclaminus minor. Southernewood, Auroesne, or
Wardrobe, in latin Abrotonum, Thelyphtorium. The female kind of Southernwood
is called garden Cipers, Abrotonum foemina, it is called Chamaecyparissus, but
untruly; for Chamaecyparissus Plinij is not great and woody as the garden
Cipers is, but it is a little herb, about one span in height, otherwise it is
very like to the garden Cypers, it is also called with us the female
Southernewood: the Herbarists do call it Abrotonum foemina, Cyparissus, and
Cypressus hortulanus, and Sandolina. Sparrow, in Greek Psar, Struthos, Colmis,
and in latin Passer: a well known bird. Sparrowhauke, in Greek Spizias and
Spizites, in Latin Accipiter, Fringellarius, and Nisus: it is a bird common
and well known. Sperage, in Greek and Latin Asparagus or Aspharagus, at the
Apothecaries Sparagus. There be two kinds of it, to wit, the wild and the
tame Sperage: the tame kind grows every where near the Rheine: the wild
Sperage has lesser leaves and seeds, this grows on the hills, for which
cause it is called Asparagus petraeus. Sperma Ceti, in Greek Halos anthos, in
Latin Maris flos, of the Herbarists Sperma balnearum, and at the Apothecaries
Sperma Ceti: It is used for clotted blood, being mixed with other things.
Spider, in Greek Arachne, in Latin Aranea, Araneus: there is yet another
kind, called of Pliny, Phalangium: this is big, and poisoneth in biting or
stinging, it is only found in hot countries, and especially in Italy, where it
is called Tarantula. Spike of Rome, Salinuca, Nardus Celtica, Nardus Romana,
Spica Celtica, Spica Romana, Nardus Gallica, and Spica Gallica, the Herbarists
do call it flos diuae Magdalenae: it is a well known herb, warm in the first,
and dry in the second degree. Spikenard oil, look oil of Spikenard. Spinach,
in Greek Seutlomalache and Teutlomalache, in latin Beta Maluatica, Spinaceum,
or Spinacea, Spanachia and Spinachia, Olus Spinaceum, and Olus Hispanicum. It
is cold and moist in the first degree. Sponge, in Greek Spongos, and in
Latin Spongia. Spurge, in greek Tithymalus, in latin Lactaria herba, of
Celsus and Columella, Lactuca marina, of Pliny, Lactuca caprina, and at the
Apothecaries Esula, or Ezula. The Arabians do call it Xauser. There are eight
kinds of it, the first is called in Greek and latin Characias, Tithymaius
characias, Tithymalus vallaris, Amygdaloides, Cometes, Tithymalus cometes,
Cobius, Tithymalus cobius, of Apuleius, Alypus, Gobius and Meconites,
Tithymalus masculus, Lactuca marina, and Genitura Martis, of the Herbarists
Esula, or Esula Papaueracea, Esula Vallaris, Esula Amygdalina, and Esula
comosa. It is a very big kind of Spurge, it has great long leaves, not
unlike to the Almond tree, red stalks and branches, it is called Lathyris
syluestris, and Cataputia syluestris. The second kind of Spurge has thick and
picked leaves, like to the Myrtle; it is called in Greek and Latin Myrtites,
Tithymalus myrsinites, Tithymalus foemina, Caryites, Tithymalus Caryites, of
Apuleius, Caryon, of Theophrastus and the Simplicists, Tithymalus myrtifolius,
Tithymalus myrtiphyllus, Tithymalus myrtaceus, of Apuleius, Multilago Capraria,
of the common Herbarists Esula, or Esula myrtifolia, and Esula myrtacea. This
kind of Spurge grows not with us of it self, but is planted in gardens. The
third kind of Spurge grows about one spanne in height, and has red branches,
round leaves, white flowers, and seeds as big as small peason, it is called
sea spurge, in Greek and Latin Paralius, Tithymalus Paralius, Tithymalus
maritimus, Tithymalus lactariolus, Tithymalis, and of Theophrastus, Coccos: of
the Herbarists Lactariola, Herba Lactariola, and Esula, or Esula marina. The
fourth kind of Spurge grows every where in gardens, and near hedges, it is
an herb not altogether a span in height, with red stalks and branches, it
has round leaves like Purslaine, and it bears a yellow flower, and turns
with the Sun, in Greek and Latin Helioscopius, Tithymalus helioscopius,
Tithymalus Solisequus, or Solisequius, Dentritis Apulcij (ob Arbusculae
similitudinem) Cicer Columbinum, Caprago, of the Herbarists Lactaria
solisequia, Esula, or Esula solisequia, or Solisequia. The fifth kind of Spurge
is the lesser kind of Spurge, which is like to the small field Cipers, it
grows here and there in sundry gardens, and in tilled ground, and it is
called the lesser Spurge, in Greek and Latin Cyparissias, Tithymalus
Cyparissias, Tithymalus Cupressinus: of the Herbarists Esula, or Esula
cupressina; and at the Apothecaries Esula minor: this plant is called of Mesues
Scebram minus, and Alscebram minus. The sixth kind of Spurge is the greatest of
all, it grows on rocks or stony places: it is like to a little tree, the
leaves are narrower than they of Esula Myrtacea: it is called in Greek and
Latin Dendrodes, Dendroides, Tithymalus Dendrodes, Tithymalus leptophyllos,
Tithymalus tenuifolius, Tithymalus Petraeus, Tithymalus arborescens: of the
Simplicists Esula, or Esula Arborescens and Petraea. The seventh kind has
great broad leaves, and is called great Spurge, and sweet Spurge, in Greek
and Latin Tithymalus platyphillos, Tithymalus latifolius, Corymbitis, and of
Apuleius, Persites, in Latin of the Herbarists Tritum or Titum, at the
Apothecaries Esula, or Esula latifolia, and Esula dulcis. The eghth kind is
the Esula, which is also called Pityusa, of Mesues, Alscebram, or Alscebram
maius, of Auicenna, Meheze heregi, at the Apothecaries Esula mayor: there has
been spoken of this kind in the title of Turbith T. Also if Esula or Spurge be
named in this book, then is the Esula Cyparissia to be used. Squinanth, in
latin and greek Schoenus, Schoenanthum, Iuncus odoratus, Pastus Camelorum, at
the Apoth. Squinanthum: the flowers are called in greek Schoenanthos, that is,
Iunci flores: they are now brought unto us again, although they be not common
every where. Stag, Ceruus. Stauesacre, look for Licebane in L. Stechados or
Stechas, it is called of Dioscorides in Greek Stichas, of Galen Stechas, of
others Sincliopa; Alcibiades, Styphonia and Stiphonia, in Latin Stichas,
Stechas, Staechas, Oculus Pythonis, or Sciolebina, and at the Apothecaries
Stichados indeclinabiliter. There are two kinds of it, the one comes from
Arabia, which has leaves very like to Lauender, but they are somewhat iagged,
and to each stalk are three or four compacted pares, and each one has a
little stalk, with pretty little purple flowers, of a very pleasant and
fragrant smell, and it is now a days with us planted in gardens: this kind is
called Stichas Arabica, and at the Apothecaries Stichados Arabicum. The other
kind grows in Spain, Italy, and in other places: it is not much unlike the
former, but that it is somewhat bigger, and the leaves are not iagged: the
Herbarists do call this kind Stichados Europaea, it has also oftentimes a name
of the place where it grows, as that of France is called Stichas Gallica: the
Italians do call their Stichados, Stichadem montanam: the Portingales do call
that which grows in Arabia Rosmarinum Mauritanorum. The authors do commend
that of Arabia above all the other kinds, but because it is brought so far,
and that it loses his virtue by the way, do the learned physicians use only
that which grows in Europe. Steel, in greek Calyps, and of Pollux, Stomoma,
in latin Chalybs, of Pliny, Nucleus ferri, and Acies ferri. Stonecrop,
Illecebra, Piper murinum, and of Dioscorides, Sedi tertium genus. Stone
parsley, or parsley of Macedon, Petroselinum Macedonicum: they that have great
store of small skill in simples, have hitherto used the parsley of Alexandria
for that of Macedonia: Others, because they had no Stone parsley, have used the
greater pimpernell in steed of it; of which opinion Hieronimus Tragus (my
master) was the first, because that kind of pimpernell is stronger, and
agrees better with the stone parsley than the other. But now having gotten the
true Stone parsley, and planted it in diverse gardens, it is not needful to use
any other thing for it. The parsley of Alexandria has also her proper use in
physic, and it is called of Dioscorides Smyrnium: of the Herbarists
Petroselinum Alexandrinum, Petroselinum Cilicum, Apium Alexandrinum, Apium
grande and Olusatrum: these herbs are seldom used alone. Storax, look Styrax
in the latin Index or Table. Storke, in Greek Pelargus, in latin Ciconia: it
is a bird common enough beyond the seas. Storkes bill, of Dioscorides Geranium
alterum, of the Herbarists Pes Columbinus, and Peristopodium, it is one of the
smallest kinds of Storkes bill, with round leaves like to the lesser Mallow.
Strawberry, Fragum. Sturgion, Accipenser, Sturio, it is a common and well
known fish. Succorie, look Cicorie in C. Sugar, in Greek Sacchar, Saccharon,
Meli, of Arrianus, Calaminon, in latin of Pliny, Sal Indus and Saccharum, at
the Apothecaries Zuccarum. There are six kinds of it: the first kind is
refined sugar, which artificially has been purified, and is called of the
simplicistes Saccharum valentinum, Saccharum finum, Saccharum refinatum, and
Saccharum Tabazeth. The second kind is Madery sugar, which is brought from the
Island Madera, this is the second in goodness, and is called in latin
Saccharum Maderiense or Mederiense. The third kind is Canary sugar, which is
next in goodness to the Madery sugar, in latin Saccharum Canarium. The fourth
kind is the Malta or powder Sugar, it is brought from Maltha, and it is called
of the simplicists Saccharum Maltanu^. The fifth kind is a brown and soft
Sugar, it is brought from the Island S. Thomas, and it is the very worst of all
the kinds: it is called of the Simplicistes Saccharum Thomasinum, Saccharum
Thomaeum, and at the Apothecaries Saccharum rubrum. The sixth kind is the sirup
that flows from the Sugar in refining, it is known every where by the name
of Sirupe, Mel Saccharinum and Remel. Whenever any mention is made of Sugar,
then is either the Madery sugar, or the Malta sugar to be taken and used. Sugar
parsnep, in Greek and latin Sisarum and Siser: this is the true Sisarum or
Siser of the ancient writers, and not our common parsnep, as some suppose; for
the parsnep with the broad leaf is the true Elaphoboscum Dioscoridis. If we
did always distinguish our herbs after the best manner, we should not fall and
run into so many confusions and errors. Sulphur, look for Brimstone in B.
Suppositorie is used to procure stools, and is called in Greek and latin
Balanus, glans, and at the Apothecaries Suppositorium. Swallow, in greek
Chelidon, in latin Hirundo.
T.
TAmariske, in greek Myrica, in latin Tamarix, of the herbarists Bryaria, and
at the Apothecaries Tamariscus: it is a well known tree, and grows abundantly
in many places of Germany. Tansie, the Herbarists do ca^ it Tanacetum, and
Athanasia. Tassell, in greek and latin Dipsacus, Onocardium, Labrum Veneris,
Carduus Veneris, Virga Pastoris, Carduus Fullonius, and Lauacrum Veneris. Three
leafed grass, look for Clauers in C. Thoroughwaxe, Pe^foliata. Thunderbolt,
Phrygius lapis of Dioscorides, and at the Apothecaries Lapis lyncis. The gentle
Reader is here to be admonished of the great abuse, harm and deceit that has
happened these many years at the Apothecaries in the use of this simple. For the
unskillful Physicians, which do not much trouble themselves with the true
knowledge of simples, are as yet of opinion that the Thunderbolt should be
engendered in the air; and they do use it in their compositions to expel
urine, gravel and stone, and especially in the Lithontribon magnum Nicolai.
But the stone which they call Lapis Lyncis or Lyncurium, is called of Galen and
Dioscorides Lapis phrygius, for the Dyers in Phrygia do use it in their
dyings. This foresaid stone (as Dioscorides witnesses) grows in Cappadocia;
but neither Galen nor yet Dioscorides does say, that this stone should be
engendered in the air, for it is a thing that grows of it self, as the
Calamine does, and (as Galen says) it has the same virtues with the Flint,
but that this may not be used inwardly. By this may appear how greatly they
have erred that have called this stone Lapis Lyncis or Lyncurium: also how
diversely men have been deceived, and their infirmities increased, in ministering
unto them diverse compositions, wherein this stone is put. Wherefore every
careful Physician ought diligently to read the books of Dioscorides, Galen,
Pliny, Aetius, and of Nicolaus Myrepsus, that he might thereby perceive his
own defaults, and turn back from his errors. Dioscorides in his second book
de re Medica, and the 74. chapt. writes after this manner of the Thunderbolt:
It has been thought that the water of the air, which is called Lyncurium,
should congeale into a stone, but it has been found false, and all whatsoever
else has been said of it; for the Lyncurium is that which is called of some
Electrum Pterigophoron, Amber, or white Amber, and is brought unto us in great
abundance from Prussia; these are the very words of Dioscorides. The like false
opinion does Pliny detect lib. 37. cap. 3. Here may you evidently perceive,
that neither ancient writers have held any thing of that false and fained
opinion; for they do all affirm that Electrum, Succinum, and Lyncurt^^ is one
and the same thing, which has been sufficiently seen by the words of
Dioscorides. It does also appear in the writings of Aetius, and Nicolaus
Myrepsus, that they meant nothing else by their Thunderbolt Lyncurium or Lapis
lyncis, but only Succinum that is the Amber. Also that the Amber comes not
out of the air, but out of the sea, that is sufficiently known to all the
world. But whether that unskillful crew had said that it were engendered of a
certain water in the air, or that it is the vrin of a beast congealed into a
stone, that were a small error, if they had used the right Amber in their
compositions. That Amber has power to expel the stone, urine, and gravel,
(which virtues are ascribed to the Lyncurium) that is sufficiently known to
every expert Physician: and that the white Amber is the right Lyncurius or
Lyncurium, that may be showed by the words of Aetius, who calls it Electrum,
Lyncurium, and Succinum, and distinguishes the yellow Amber from it, calling
it Chryselectrum, that is, Aureum Electrum. And Dioscorides in the former
chapter calls the white Amber Elec^^um Pterigophoron, and in the first book
de medica materia, does he call the yellow Amber Chrysophorum. Hereby do we
conclude that Lapis Lyncis, Lyncurius or Lyncurium (as the Grecians term it)
is naught else but the white Amber: wherefore heed must be taken that thou use
the white Amber in all compositions that have the Lapis lyncis in them. Of the
virtues of the Thunderbolt, look for Amber. Thyme, in g^eeke and latin
Thymum, Thymus, Serpilium Romanum, or herba Thymiana, at the Apothecaries
Tymus. There are two kinds of it, and both of them are set in gardens, but in
hot countries do they grow every where of themselves. The first kind is white,
and has long ears or heads like to Stechados, it has a very pleasant smell,
it is called in Greek and Latin Thymum capitatum, Thymum candidum, Thymum
creticum, Thymum Spicatum, and Thymum aromaticum: we call it white Thyme. The
second kind is rougher, and of a dark green color, and it is common in all
gardens, and well known by the name of Thyme. The first kind is much better
for physic than the other if it may be gotten: they are both of them hot and
dry in the third degree. Tillet tree, in greek Philyra, in latin Tilia: there
are two kinds of it, the common Tillet tree, and the wild Tillet tree, which
grows in the shadowy wood and hills, it is very like to the tame kind, but
that it is much less; it blows also slower, and at the last the blossoms
fall off without any fruit. It is called the wild Tillet tree, or stone
Tillet, because the wood of it is harder and more compacted than the tame: it
is called in Latin Tilia syluestris and Tiliamas. The blossoms and the
fruits of it are used in physic. Toade, in greek Phrynus, of Virgill, Bufo,
and of Pliny, Rubeta. Some unskillful Physicians do take Rubeta to be the
leafe-frogge, which is a great error, for they are as like as an apple is like
to an oyster, because the Toade is hurtful and venomous, and the Leafe-frog
without all hurt or harm. Tormentil, is called of Dioscorides, Chrysogonon,
and of others Heptaphyllon, of the Herbarists Septifolium, Betularia, and at
the Apothecaries Tormentilla. Tortoyse, in Greek Chelone or Emys; of Hesichius
and Aristoteles, Mys; in Latin Testudo: the shell of it is called in Greek
Chelonium, and of Nicander, Chelium, in Latin Testudinis operimentum. Treacle,
in Greek and Latin Theriaca, at the Apothecaries Teriaca: We have mentioned
in this book of two kinds of Treacle, to wit, of Theriaca Andromachi or
Theriaca magna, and the common treacle called Theriaca Diatessaron: but
wheresoever Treacle is named without any addition, there must the great
Theriaca Andromachi be taken and used. Turbith, of Actuarius, Turpetum, in
Latin of the Herbarists Turbetum, of the Arabians Turbith and Turbeth. There
are four kinds of it: the first is the white Turbith, very common at al
Apothecaries, this kind is called of Dioscorides in Greek Alpum, of Actuarius
Alypias, and Turpetum album, at the Apothecaries Turpetum Orientale, or
Turpetum Alexandrinum, and in English white Turbith. The second kind is called
of Dioscorides and Actuarius, Pityusa, Clema, Crabion, and Canopicon, of the
Herbarists Turpetum nigrum, and Esula mayor: also of the Arabians Alscebram
maius, or Scebram maius, in english black Turbith. The third kind is called in
greek Thapsia, Hypopiu^, and Pancranum, in latin Ferulago, and Ferula
syluestris, of the Herbarists Turpetum cineritium, and Turpetum Mesuis, and
Mesues has understood by his Turbith nothing else but Thapsia. The fourth kind
is the Turpetum Serapionis, who also has his several Turbith. Dioscorides
calls it Tripolium, Psyche, Meris, Stachyites, of the Herbarists Turpetum
Serapionis, and Aster marinus: but when thou find Turbith in any composition
with any addition, then is the white Turbith to be understood for it.
Turmericke, Cyperus Indicus, the Apothecaries call it Curcuma, and Terra
merita, Rasis calls it Vena citrina. Turnips, look for Rapes in R.
Turpentine is called Resina Terebinthi, Terebinthina, or Terminthina, of the
Arabians and Apothecaries Terbentina, Terpentina, and Termentina. It is not the
common Turpentine that flows from the Fir tree, as the unskillful suppose,
but it is the true Turpentine of the Turpentine tree. Turpentine tree, in
greek Terminthos, of Nicander, Trimithos, in latin Terebinthus, of Auicenna,
Arbor graniuirides. Turtle Dove, in Greek Trygon, in Latin Turtur. Tuttie, at
the Apothecaries Tutia factitia, Cadmia botryitis, or Cadmia Acinosa, and
Cadmia officinarum.
V.
VAlerian, in greek and latin Phu, Valeriana, Genicularis, Herba benedicta
and Marinella. There are four kinds of it, and two of them only in use; the
first is the common Valerian, which only ought to have that name. The second
kind is planted in gardens, although it be otherwhiles found in woods and on
hills: it has much greater leaves than the common Valerian, and also a bigger
root, of the thicknes of a finger, and this is the true Phu of the ancient
writers. It is called Phu Ponticu^, in english great Valerian, the Herbarists
do call it Theriacaria, Herba diui Georgij, Georgiana, and Herba diuae Mariae.
This is commended before the former Valerian, if it may be gotten. They are hot
in the first, and dry in the second degree. Venus hair, in greek Trichoman^,
Callitrichon, Eupteron, of Hippocrates, Calliphyllon, of Apuleius, Tricophys,
Selinophyllon, Dyphyes, Scholibrochon, Amianthon, and Adianton: although
Dioscorides do describe another kind of Adianton, to wit, Maydenhaire, yet
notwithstanding is Venus hair the true Adiantum Apuleij: in latin Herba
Capillaris, Barba Herculis, and Pinnula, of Apuleius, Herba crinita, Capillus
Veneris: the Apothecaries call it Polytrichum. There are yet two kinds more of
it, to wit, the greater and the lesser Maidenhaire: the greater kind is called
of the Herbarists Polytrichum aureum, Adiantu^ aureum, and Capillaris aurea.
The lesser is called Adiantum aureum minus. Some have taken both these kinds
for Polytrichon Apuleij; but they err greatly, as does appear by the
description of it. But when thou read Venus hair in any composition, then
shall thou take the common Venus hair. Verdigrease, in greek Chalcou anthos,
in latin Flos aeris, or Aerugo, at the Apothecaries Viride aeris. Vinum
punicum, or Vinum Histricum, Vinum punicinum. Violets, in greek Ion, and Ion

nigra, and Setialis: of the Herbarists Viola Martia, and Viola Quadragesimalis:
it is also sometimes called only Viola, in english a Violet: the Apothecaries
call it Flos Violae. The leaves of the Violets are called Violaria, and Matter
Violarum. There are five kinds of them, that are all of one and the same
operation. The first kind is common every where, and known to all men. The
second kind are the white Violets, which are very like to the former, but
that they be very white; they are set in garde^s notwithstanding that they are
found in ye fields: the Herbarists do call it Viola alba, and Viola Martia
alba. The third and fourth kinds are the white and blewe double Violets, that
grow in gardens: The blew double Violets are called Viola multiplex, Ion
polyphyllon, and Viola purpurea multiplex. The double white Violets are called
Viola alba multiplex. The fifth kind of Violets are the wild violets, which are
like to the tame Violets in every respect, but that the leaves are somewhat
less and longer, and the flowers are of a light or purple blew, like the
other, but without any smell, where nevertheless, all the other kinds are
very fragrant. The sixth kind is called Ion agrion, Viola syluestris, of the
Herbarists Viola fatua, or Viola canina. Viper or Adder, in greek Echis, and
Echidna, in latin Vipera, and of Cicero, Excerta: the Italians do call it

Keyri, Keiri, and Cheyri. Walnut tree, in greek Caryon, Caryon basilicon, and
of Pollux, Caryon Persicon, Nux basilica, Nux regia, Iuglans, and Nux Persica.
There are three kinds of it, to wit, great, middle, and lesser nuts: the
lesser may be called stony nuts, because they have such hard shells. The second
kind are the common Walnuts, Nuces mediae, or Iuglandes mediae. The third kind
are the biggest, and are called Nuces equinae, or Iuglandes equinae.
Watercresse, in greek and latin Sisymbrium aquaticum, Nasturtium aquaticum,

Veneris, Alga palustris, Lilium palustre, Papauer palustre, Claua Herculis,
Rosa palustris, of Apuleius, Protea, and Matter herculanea: The Arabians and
Apothecaries do call it Nenufar, or Nenuphar. There are four kinds of it: the
first kind grows in Pondes, they are very common, and bear a fair white
flower, known to every man: it is called Nymphaea alba, of Pliny, Nymphaea
Heraclia, with us white water Lillies. The other kind is like the former, but
not so common, it bears a yellow flower, and is called of the Herbarists
Nymphaea lutea, of Dioscorides, Nymphon, the flowers Blepharon, and Blephara,
with us yellow water Lillies. The third kind has small leaves, like to
Crowfoote flowers, and small white flowers, it grows commonly in sweet and
running streams, and it is called of the Herbarists Nymphaea minor, in English
the lesser white water Lilly. The fourth kind is like to the great water
Lilly, but that it is somewhat less, it bears a pretty yellow starry
flower, it is called of the Herbarists Nymphaea lutea minor, we call it the
lesser yellow water Lilly. Water Torch, in greek and latin Typha: the
Herbarists do call it Typha aquatica, and Typha palustris, to distinguish it
from the Turkish Corn, and the Ginny wheat, both which are also called
Typhae: whereof shall be spoken more at large when opportunity shall serve.
The water Torch is but once mentioned in this whole work. Water Willow, in
greek and latin Lysimachium, or Lysimachia, Litrum, of the Herbarists
Salicaria. There are three kinds of it, the first is the common water Willowe,
which is called the yellow water Willow, in latin Lysimachia lutea, or
Lysimachia melina. The second kind grows in moist places, it has narrow and
picked leaves, with a pretty purple flower: it is called of Pliny, Lysimachia,
for the first kind is Lysimachia Dioscoridis: of the Herbarists Lysimachia
Pliniana, Lysimachia purpurea, or Punicea, Lysimachia Spicata, and Salicaria
purpurea in English the purple water Willow. The third kind grows about the
running waters or streams, it has small leaves, like to the Willow, but a
little iagged, it bears a pretty small purple flower, like to the lesser
Roses, out of which comes afterward a little cup, which contains some
small seeds. It is called of the Herbarists Lysimachia siliquosa, and Filius
ante patre^, in English horned water Willowes, that is, Salicaria cornuta,
Salicaria siliquosa, and Lysimachia cornuta. But if thou find water Willowes
without any addition, then shall thou understand the yellow water Willow, or
Lysimachia Dioscoridis. Wax, in greek Ceros, in latin Cera. Whay, Serum,
Aqua lactis, and Aqua Casei. Wheasle, in greek Gale, and Spondyle, in latin
Mustela. Wheat, in greek Pyros, in latin Triticum. There are three kinds of
it; the first kind do we call Wheat, without any addition, of Columella
Robus, of the Simplicists Triticum robum: this is the very best in weight and
whitenes. The second is a kind of ruffeared Wheat, in greek Pyros Trimenos,
or Setanias, in latin Triticum Trimestre, and Halicastrum, of Columella,
Setanium, or Sitanium, of the Herbarists Triticu^ sitanium. The third kind is
called in greek Selignis, in latin Siligo, and Triticum Siligineum. Wheat
ruffeared, in greek Zea, in latin Semen, of Columella, Far clusinum, and of
others Spelta. There are two kinds of it, the first is the common ruffeared
wheat, it brings two husks close together, with two grains in them: this
is called Spelt, and Zeadiococcos. The second kind is called S. Peter's corn,
it brings but one seed or grain, to wit, in a row, as the former brings
the two: it is called in greek Zea monococcos, and in latin Zea simplex, and
Semen simplex: it is a kind of grain which is a mean between Barley and
Wheat. Wheat ruffeared prepared, Alica or Halica, in greek Chondrus, Zea
deglubita, ruffeared, wheat peeled. White water Mints, in greek Minthae
agria, Hediosmos agrios, in latin Mentastrum, and Mentha syluestris, of the
Herbarists Mentha equina, Mentha caballina, and Balsamita fesina. There are two
kinds of it: the first has rough, white, and round leaves, and a hayrie and
rough stalk, this is the true Mentastrum Dioscoridis. The second kind is not
rough, but has long picked leaves, and a brown hayrie flower: they grow
near to the water side; this second kind is called Mentastrum acutum, and
they have both one and the same operation. Apuleius and Pliny have also their
several Mentastrum, which they do call Glechon agrion, and Pulegium agreste:
It is the second Calamintha Dioscoridis, which we have called Calamintha
aruensis before. Wild Beetes, of the Herbarists Apiophyllon, Herba pyrifolia,
or Pyrifolia, Consolida pyrifolia, Pyrola, and Pyrula: It is a vulnerall herb,
having leaves like a Pear tree, it grows in the shadowie wood^, and
continues green both winter and summer. There is yet another kind of it,
which grows in meadows, near hills, which is like to the former, but that it
has longer leaves and stalks, whereon there be white flowers: the Herbarists
do call it Pyrola, or Pyrula pratensis: they are both of one nature and
operation: they are dry in the third degree, they do consolidate mightily;
but by wild Beetes shall thou understand that which grows in woods. Wild
Cucumbers, Cucumer Asininus, Cucumer syluestris, Cucumer anguinus, and Cucumer
erraticus. It is a well known herb, but it grows not with us unless it be
sown in gardens. There is a juice pressed out of the fruit of it, and prepared,
which is called Elaterium, whereof shall be spoken elsewhere. Wild Flax, in
greek and latin Osyris, of the Herbarists Herba vrinalis, and Linum beatae
Maria, at the Apothecaries Linaria. Wild Grapes, in Greek Ampelos agria, in
Latin Labrusca: the blossoms of the wild Vine is called in greek Oenanthe,
in Latin Flos labruscae, Flos vitis syluestris, and at the Apothecaries Flos

in latin Pyraster, in English a wild Pear tree: these Pears, their leaves,
and the water distilled of them is used for the Laske. Wild Radish, Armoracia,
Raphanus syluestris, at the Apothecaries Rapistrum: There are two kinds of it;
both of them do grow in fields that are sown. The first kind is that whereof
now has been spoken: The second kind is like the first, but it has fewer and
broader leaves; the flowers are white, and is commonly called white wild
Radish, Rapistrum album, that is, Lapsana, Dioscoridis and Galeni. They that
call our Horse radish Armoracia, do err greatly; for Armoracia is Raphanus
syluestris, a wild Radish. Look for this in the description of Dioscorides,
and the truth will soon appear. Wild Saffron, in greek Cnicus, Cnecus,
Gnicus, and Gnecus, in latin, Cartamus, or Cha^tamus. There are two kinds of
it, the first is the wild well known Saffron, which grows in many gardens;
this is called Cartamus domesticus, of Serapio, Kartan, of Auerroes, Elcratis,
of the Herbarists Crocus hortulanus, Crocus syluestris, Crocus saracenicus,
Crocus fatuus, it is barbarously called Zaffranum syluestre, and Saffranum
fatuum. Auerroes calls the seed of it Semen de I'apaga. The second kind
grows on dry hills and untilled and dry fields, it is called wild field
Saffron, in greek Atractylis, and Cnicus agria, in latin Colus rustica, Fusus
agrestis, and of the Herbarists Cnicus syluestris, Cnicus campestris, Cartamus
syluestris, Eracantha, and Carduus amoris: but the tame kind is only used in
Physic, to wit, the flowers and seed of it, which is also called Semen
papagalli, or Semen Psittaci. Note that Cartamus with t. does signify wild
Saffron, and Cardamus with d. Cresses seeds, Nasturtium: wherefore great heed
is to be given of it. Wild Thyme, Serpillum, Cunilago, and in greek
Herpyllum. Willow tree, in greek Itea, in latin Salix, of Homerus,
Frugiperda: There are five kinds of it; the first is called with us the red
Willow, of Theophrastus, Salix nigra, or Punicea, of Pliny, Salix viminalis, of
Columella, Salix Sabina, and Salix Amerina: this is the very best kind of all
the rest. The second kind is the white Willow, and of the Herbarists Salix
candida. The third kind is called of Pliny, Salix vitellina, of Columella,
Salix Graeca, with us water Willow tree. The fourth kind is called of the
Herbarists Salix platyphyllos, Salix latifolia, and Salix cinerea. The fifth
kind is the least of all, called of Theophrastus, Salix helix, of Pliny, and
Columella, Salix Gallica: of the Simplicists Salix pumila. These five kinds of
Willowes are sufficiently known to all men. Wine, in greek Oenos, of
Cratinus, Tryx. There are four kinds, each according to the country, to wit,
the least, smallest, middle, and strong wine: but we will speak but of two
kinds at this present, to wit, of strong and of small wine: the strong wine is
called Vinum Oenodes, Vinum polyphorum, and Vinum multiferum. The common wine
is called Vinum oligophorum, Vinum pauciferum, Vinum aquosum, and Vinum
Cibarium, this is only spoken and meant of Rhenish wine. Winter Cherries, in
greek Halicacabus, Physalis, in latin Solanum vesicarium, of Pliny,
Vesicaria, of the Herbarists Solanum rubeum, or Solatrum rubeum, Cerasum
Iudaeorum, Cerasum terrae, in the Arabian tongue Alkekengi, or Alkakengi: they
are cold and astringent in the second degree, but mean moist. Weather,
Castron, Veruex. Woade, in greek and latin Isatis, of Pliny Glastum, of the
Herbarists Guadum, and Pastillum, it is an herb well known to diverse. There
are two kinds of it, one tame, and one wild; the tame Woade grows in
France, and in During, with us only in gardens for physical uses: it is
called Isatis satiua, Egne, and Glastum satiuum. The second is the wild kind,
it is lesser than the former, it grows here and there in the woods and
fields; it is called Isatis syluestris, Isatis minor, Glastum syluestre, and
Glastum minus. They are both drying and astringe^t, but the wild Woad is much
stronger than the tame. Woodcocke, in greek Scolopax, of Hesychius, Varino,
Nemesiano, in latin of Gaza, Gallinago, of Heradianus, Perdix syluestris, of
other Perdix rustica, or Rusticula, of Niphus and Volaterranus, Gallinella, of
the simplicists Rostrulula, and Gallinacea. Woodpecker, Picus Martius, Turbo,
in greek Driocalaptes of Arist. Driocolaps of Hesych. it is a well known
bird; it is mentioned otherwhiles in some dyets in this work. Woolblade, or
Longwoort, in greek Phlomus or Phlonus, of Apuleius, Pycnitis, in latin
Verbascum, foeminalis, Lucumbra, Candela regis, Candelaria, Lanaria, at the
Apothecaries Tapsus barbatus. There are four kinds of it, whereof the first is
the common Woolblade, with the white woolly leaves, and yellow flowers; it is
called Verbascum albifolium, and in greek Leucophyllon. The second kind is
like the former, but that the leaves are blacker and broader; it is called
black Woolblade, in greek Phlomos melanophyllos, in latin Verbascum nigrum.
The third kind is the wild Woolblade, it has a long stalk with great
leaves, much like to the great Sage, it has yellow flowers, in greek Phlomos
agrios, in latin Verbascum syluestre: of the Herbarists Verbascum saluifolium.
The fourth kind is most like to the first, but that the flowers are white, and
it is called white Woolblade Verbascum album, and Verbascum foemina. Woolfes
bane, in greek and latin Aconitum. There are six kinds of it, the first
has round leaves not much unlike to the lesser Cucumbers, with pretty yellow
flowers, not unlike to the^ of Doronicum. The roots are round, with many
joints, the little roots about it are very like a Scorpion, it is called in
Greek and Latin Pardalianches Thelyphonum, Aconitum Thelyphonum,
Theriophonum, Aconitum Theriophonum, Myoctonum, aconitum Myoctonum, and
Scorpion. The second kind of Wolfsbane has leaves like to the Italian plain
tree, but somewhat deeper iagged: the root is black, with many hairs about
it. This plant is sufficiently known by the name Wolfsbane, it grows on high
hills, and is called in Greek and Latin Lycoctonum, Aconitum Lycoctonum,
Cynoctonum, and aconitum Cynoctonum. The Herbarists do call it Aconitum
Lycoctonum luteum: the Apothecaries Luparia. The third kind is called of the
Herbarists Aconitum Lycoctonum Caeruleum, there are also three kinds of it,
and it is common in all gardens. The fourth kind of Wolfsbane is Aconitum
Lycoctonum caeruleum magnum: Auicenna calls it Napellus, it is a very
venomous herb. The fifth kind has yellow flowers, and is called yellow
Wolfsbane, of the Herbarists Aconitum Lycoctonum luteum minus. The sixth kind
grows in dark and shadowie woods, the stalk is about one span and a half
in height, and about the midst of the same are four dark green leaves,
standing opposite one against the other: it gets a black berry, under
which, many little leaves are placed each opposite to other. It is called of
the Herbarists Aconitum salutiferum, Sigillum Christi, Crux Christi, Sigillum
Veneris, and Herba Paris. It is a very wholesome herb, and may be used inwardly
very well against many diseases. Many learned men would have it to be Aconitum
pardalianches, but it is as like it as an apple is like an oyster. By Wolfsbane
shall thou understand the yellows Wolfsbane. Wormwood, in Latin and Greek
Absinthium, Aloina: there are three kinds of it: The first, is the common
Wormwood that grows every where, called Bathypic^on, Barypic^on, and
Absinthium rusticum. The second kind is like to the former in leaves and
flowers, but it is somewhat less, and it grows not above a span and a half
in height: it is also bitter like the foresaid, yet somewhat more pleasant to
be used: it grows on hilly places. This kind will never be greater although
it grow in fertile grounds. This is the same Wormwood which Dioscorides does
call Absinthium ponticum, Mesues Absinthium Romanum, of the Simplicists
Absinthium montanum, and Pliny, Absinthium Italicum. The third kind is very
like the great Wormwood, but it has lesser leaves and stalks then the
mountain Wormwood, it grows also somewhat higher: The leaves are white and
soft. This grows on sandy ditches. It is called Romish Wormwood, to avoid
all errors, and we leave the name of mountain Wormwood unto the second kin^*
This Wormwood is called of Galen Absinthium ponticum. But Mesues and other
authors do take the second kind to be the true Absinthium ponticum. Whenever
thou find Wormwood by it self in any composition, then is the mountain
wormwood to be taken and used; and if that cannot be had, then must you take
the common wormwood that grows in the fields, and not that which grows in
gardens; for the garden wormwood is not so strong, neither can it perform
that which the wild wormwood does that grows on dry grounds. Wormwood is
hot in the first, and dry in the third degree. Yerrow, Nosebleede, or
Millfoyle, in Greek Stratiotes, Chiliophyllos, Supercilium veneris, Herba
militaris, and Millefolium. It is a common herb, it is drying and astringent.
Yewe, Taxus, Smilax, Milos.

Hammoniacum, is called of the Apothecaries Armoniacum. It is the juice or gum
of a tree growing in Africa, called Agasillis. Of this gum there are two kinds,
the one fair and clean, very like Frankincense: this sort of the ancient
Physicians has been used for a sweet savor or smell, it is named of Aetius,
of Paulus Aegineta, and the other Greek writers, Ammoniacum Thymiama, or
Hammoniacum Thymiama, and this is the best for physic. Plinius calls it
Thrauston, and Thrausma. The other kind is foul and unclean, such is very
common in the Apothecaries shops, and is called of Plinius, Apyrama. Amnion,
Bryon, Moss. Amnion Plinij, Cinnabaris fossilis, a soft red stone in mines
called Cinoper. Amomum, a strange shrub as yet unknown, although the
unskillful Physicians use it not, for they in stead of this have in their
common shops a dead and wild Parsley seed (when indeed the right Amomum has
always bin a pleasant and sweet smelling shrub accounted of the ancient
Physicians) which is as like the right Amomum as an apple is like an oyster.
Let every one therefore take heed of this Amomum, also of all such medicines
which are mixed with it. Some take the Rose of Ierico for the right
Amomum,which the Herbarists call Rosa Hierichuntea, and Rosa Diuae Mariae, but
they are deceived. Galen says, that Amomum and Calmus in virtue are very like,
and therefore seeing that we have not the right Amomum, we may use Calmus very
well in his place. Amorgine, Perdicium, Pellitory of the wall. Ampar, Ambarum,

phoenice, Anagallis punicea, Anagallis rubea, Anagallis purpurca: Paulus
Aegineta calls it Corallium, or Corallia, this is Chickweede with the red
flower. The other is called Anagallis caerulea, Anagallis foemina, that is,
Chickweede with the blew flower. The third has yellow flowers: this grows
not about us except it be set or sown. It is found in the upper Burgundy, in a
field between Dolen and Besanson. This is called Anagallis lutea, Chickweede
with the yellow flower. They are all hot and dry, and may be used in wounds

span in height, upon this on every side grow flowers of a light purple color,
much like the Amethyst, or Iacinct stone: on the top of all are the flowers
somewhat lesser, and sadder in color. This is the right Hyacinthus of
Dioscorides; it grows commonly in tilled grounds, and of some is called Hogs
onion, because Hogs greatly delight in eating of it: the Herbarists call it
Hyacinthus mayor, and Bulbus porcinus. The other is somewhat less, and grows
in woods; it flowreth in March, and has pretty little blew flowers, not much
unlike the May Lillies, or Liriconfansie, the root is like little Onions. This
is called in some places blew May flowers; of the Herbarists, Hyacinthus minor,

Hyacinthus.In like sort is the yellow Lilly Lillium luteum, or Hemerocallis,
