MARCUS AVSONIVS HIS FOUR BOOKS Of Moral Precepts, Entitled CATO:
Concerning the precepts of common life.

Translated out of Latin Hexamiters into English meter by Walter Gosnold
Gentleman, servant unto the right worshipful Sr. Thomas Bows of Much-bromley
hall in Essex.

Remember those things that thou have learned, and seek with diligence to
learn those things which thou know not: and be willing to teach other those
things that thou have learned, and thou shall increase thy learning. Learning
will live, and virtue still shall shine,
When folly dies and ignorance does pine.
LONDON, Printed by EDWARD GRIFFIN.

To the Worshipful young Gentleman of virtuous education, Mr. THOMAS BOVVES,
Son and heir to the Right Worshipful, Sr. THOMAS BOVVES, Knight: WALTER
GOSNOLD wishes increase of learning, knowledge, virtue and honor, with happy
days.
Worshipful Sir,
LEast I should be thought to be idle, or to waste the golden time of my days
(the rarest of all jewels) in the service of that Right worshipful Knight,
your good father, with whom I now live, without some monuments or impressions
of my industry: as also thinking with my self what I might present some way to
express my love unto you, in remembrance of those not to be requited favors I
have received, not only from your self, but from that Right worshipful* and
religious Knight your father; and that virtuous Lady your mother, which have
wholly obliged me to their house. I have thought good for the first to
undertake the translation of Marcus Ausonius his four books of moral
precepts intituted Cato: and for the latter I am enforced (for want of better
way to show my good meaning) to dedicate to you, this rude and slender book
translated out of Latin hexamiters, into English meter. Wherein if I have any
way ministered you occasion to mislike me for dedication of the same unto you
(one whose love toward me, I must and will endeavor to requite, though never
able to cansell the obligation of your many and infinite courtesies) I trust you
will be so far from taxing of me, that you will rather hold me excused
therein. For if a man be bound, by all means that he may (as sure he is) to
gratify his well deserving friends: then may not I quiet my self, and be at
silence till I have devised the requital of some part of your friendships, by
some slender gift, such as my fortune, and present chance will permit me to
exhibit unto you. And none can I find (sweet sir) that in my mind will be
more pleasing to your gentle nature, for the encouraging of you to the
laborious and industrious obtaining of the Latin tongue, where into you are
even now entering: or more fitter for your worships tractible disposition,
being of very young, and tender years, and in whom the very sparks of a
philomathy is already seen, then this new translated Poet, which will so fill
you with sweet counsel, wholesome instructions, and abundance of knowledge
(unto which we must all in some small measure attain, before we can step to
any other grace or virtue, leading to perfection) as also teach you, how to
behave and carry your self, in the whole course of your life, as well toward
your inferious as superiors, that your company will not only be admired of
all them, that know you, but likewise desired of all those that shall at any
time be so happy, as to be acquainted with you. For the Book it self is so
exquisit that notwithstanding, the Author thereof was a heathen, and had not
the true knowledge of Christ Jesus by faith. Whereby we must all be saved,
living in a time and place where the outward means of salvation lay hid in
obscurity and darkness, as it did a long time after, being many years before
the coming of Christ: yet I pray God, what ere his faith and belief was, that
his uprightness and strictness of life toward God and man, do not condemn
us, who are, or would be thought Christians, living under the resplendent
light, and Sunneshine of the Gospel. And although he was a heathen (as I said
before) yet shall my charity be such toward him, being dead, and in whom was
such an actual habit of a good life, whiles he lived, as all the histories
that I have read of him, besides his own works, by his many good admonitions
to others, left behind him, do witness the same; I cannot think, neither
will it sink into my heart to believe, that he died altogether in unbelief,
and knowledge of the true God. For at the very period and end of his days,
being praised of the Romans for his courage at his death, laughed: they
demanding the cause why he laughed; he answered, ye marvel at that I laugh,
and I laugh at that you marvel: for the perils and travels considered wherein
we live, and the safety wherein we die, it is no more needful to have
virtue, and strength to live, then courage to die. And if we look but a
little back into his life, we shall not have much cause to marvel at his
comfortable and patient bearing of the stroke of death; for he was a man of
such mild, and temperate spirit, that he could never be seen to be wroth, or
out of patience with any man, but always counseled that were angry, that if
they desired to live long, cheerfully, and die comfortably, to bannish rage,
as an enemy to them both; a worthy saying of a heathen, and to be had in
estemation and remembrance of every good Christian. But should any be so
unwise, to think his precepts are the less worthy of immitation for being a
Heathen, I would aver the contrary against any seditious turbulent spirit
whatsoever, the best of us all being bound to receive the doctrines of many
which do write, tending to our good, though we be not tied to follow the
lives which they lead, if bad. Gold is nere the worse for being presented unto
us, out of a beggars hand in a lether bag; or a sermon ere the worse which we
hear preached, because he that preaches it, is of an ill life. It is our
wisdoms to look what the gold is, and not what the bag is that it came in,
or what the man was that brought it. We are not to inquire so much what the
life and conversation of the Minister is, as what his doctrine and admonitions
are that he teaches; not what this Cato was, but what his precepts are; which
in a word, are so wise, honest and good for every Christian man and woman to
read and practice, that you shall not find any Author, from whom a civil
life may gather better instructions. Many there are of my knowledge, which will
not have their children brought up in learning, because forsooth the Authors
which they should learn are heathenish, as this our Cato, Turrence, Mantuin,
Ovid, Virgil, Homer, and the like: desiring rather they should live like
idiots, and die like fools, then to attain knowledge (as they think) by such
unlawful means. Others because of the tenderness, they bear to their
children, will not have them brought up to learning too soon, thinking them
even too young to be taught, and to excuse their error they affirm, if the
child should be chastened it would make him both sick and foolish. But what
is their end? they are soon too old to learn, and so become unprofitable to
the Commonwealth, infamous and disobedient to their parents, so evil in
conditions, so light and unadvised in behavour, so unfit for knowledge, so
inclined to lies, so envying the truth, that they are not only a shame to
their fathers which begot them, and a reproach to their mothers which bore
them, but a scandal and disgrace to the succeeding generations after them. How
ought you then to study and make use of your time, now whiles you may, least
you repent you hereafter, when it will be too late. The tree that blossom not
in the spring, will hardly bear fruit in Autumn. If you labor no^ for
learning now in the summer and springtime of your youth, you will hardly ever
have any fruit thereof (as humility, love, obedience, and all temporal and
spiritual blessings) in the winter and declining Autumn of your age. What
although you be well descended, and your fathers eldest son, and so the
likelier to have the heaviest purse? the better and more nobler you are borne
by birth, the better ought you to be instructed in your youth; and the more
wealth you are like to have the more learning you ought to have put into you:
for such as leave great riches to their children, without seeing them brought
up in literature (as Socrates says) are like unto them that give much
provender to young horses, but never break them at all, so that they wax fat,
but unprofitable. The father (as one says) is bound no more toward his
child, but to banish him from his pleasures, and to give him virtuous masters
to instruct him. What the pleasures are which fathers banish from their
children, I know not; who let loose the raines of liberty so upon them, that
the child which most commonly they love best, (as the eldest) run most at
random, unto all kinds of looseness and licentiousness of life. Virtuous
masters I confess, they many times have to teach them, but as the old saying
is, as good nere the whit, as nere the better. For what are their children ere
the better for them? they must not forsooth be taught abroad, for fear the
wind should blow on them; or from under their mothers winge, least they should
ketch cold: but be taught at home in the presence of their parents, that they
may not stand in awe of their Tutour, and so learn too much. For so much
audacity, is given to children that are taught at home, and so little
countenance shown to the masters which teach them, that one cannot well
discern, who stands in most fear many times, the master or the scholar. That
masters must be thought either very indiscreet, or too base and mean to give
correction when they think fitting; or fathers very unwise to think that
their children should be too good to be corrected, when they deserve it. Yet
thus it is in great men's houses, when children are negligent, and will not
learn, masters would correct rhem, but fathers and mothers forbid them, so
that it little avayleth one to prick the horse with the s^ure, when he that
sits upon him holds back with the bridle. And therefore let parents know
although masters be never so ignoble and mean, and children never so noble and
well descended, yet must they stand in awe of them by whom they are taught, and
have correction at their hands, when occasion serve, if ever they would have
them to learn well; but with the fondness of those parents whose children are
borne to higher fortunes, then others are, the youngest brother many times is
saine to suffer for the eldest brothers fault, or some other meaner Gentleman's
son, that is trained up with him to be his asociate, insomuch that an elder
brother without contradiction, now adays, either of parents, master, or any
one else, may do any thing but that which is good, or be any thing but a wise
man, which seldom troubles him. For although the eldest brother has all the
money and lands, yet the youngest most commonly gets all the wit and manners,
and in time proves not only the richest in estate, as I know some, but also in
grace as there be many; whereas if they had met with the same sauce in their
childhood, that their younger brothers have done, it would so whetted their
stomakes, that they would have had as good an appetite to all goodness, as
their younger brothers. But as it is reported of the Ape that she kills her
young ones, with overmuch hugging of them: so there be many such like apish
parents who spoyleth their children, with making too much of them, especially
if they have but one only child to inherit their estate after them. For all
the time they are at home, they not be spoken to, or contradicted in any thing
they do, though never so ill. No^ in any thing they speak, be it never so
bad; counting great faults but small ones, and small ones none at all;
suffering them (indeed) to have so much their own wills, and so long without
restraint that when they would reine and curb them in, they cannot. For too
much liberty in youth is a manifest token of disobedience in age. When they are
put out to school though it be long first ere they go, or be taught at home,
the masters hands are so fast bound through a strict command given them from
the parents, not to touch them being taught at home: or large golden promises,
not to correct them if they be taught abroad, that the disciples they teach
many times perish for want of discipline and impunity. I speak not this
concerning your self, that you or your parents are any ways to be taxed
herein, as I of mine own knowledge can witness the same, but what I have seen
in others, that I may be an instrument of good to reform them that are
overmuch to be ^lamed, for their negligence this way, that would have masters
to instruct their children, but not to correct them, which sometimes is as
necessary as documents of wholesome instructions. Therefore if any should
think, I have shown but little wit, and less manners in dealing thus
plainly, or have any ways offended in delivering my mind thus freely, my
apology for my self shall be only this: I would that my labors (being your
servant) should be accounted rather honest than wise: For the wise can but
please, but the honest can never displease. But what should I need to make any
apology for that I have said; when as I know some that are so golden, or rather
earthly minded, that if they can but heap up mountains of wealth to leave
their children, to make them rich; they care not how little mole-hils of
learning they have to make them virtuous: forgetting that it is better to leave
unto their children good doctrine whereby they may live, than evil riches
whereby they may perish: whose offense (as a wise Philosopher says) is
impardonable, that for heaping up of riches, forget to bring up their children
in honest manners. If this be not true that I speak, let experience speak for
me, who of her own knowledge can produce many lamentable examples of
Gentlemen's sons, and great heirs abroad in the world, who have had more
wealth left them, than wit to use it, through want of this one principle of
learning put into them, to season and relish those other parts and ornaments of
nature they have been endowed withal. Wherefore it stands parents in hand
that have any true inward love toward the good of their children, to see them
as well virtuously educated in learning as to provide for them great portions.
Solomon says, How much better is it to get wisdom then gold? and to get
understanding* rather to be chosen then silver? Let fathers and mothers then
take it into their considerations, to use all the best means they can to put
wisdom and understanding into their childrens heads, as well as money into
their purses by training them up to learning, when they are young. A wise
child, says Solomon, makes a glad father, but a foolish child is a
heaviness to his heart. It is not possible to keep meat well savoured,
unless it be first salted: It is impossible that fish should live without
water: it is not unlikely, but the Rose which is overgrowne with the Thorn
should wither; so it is impossible that fathers should have any comfort in
their children, unless they bring them up to learning and virtuous education
in their youth. Nothing makes a more deep impression in the mind of man, than
those rules he learned when he was a child: for whatsoever good instructions
children learn in their youth, the same they retain in their age, which made
Cato himself be a Schoolmasters to his own sons, because he would not have
their youth infected. Go on then, Noble Sir, in the race you have begun, who
have hitherto had (God be praised) virtuous education, and godly bringing up,
having not only a Wise, and a religious Father to advise you, a virtuous and
godly Mother to counsel you; but also a prudent and discreet Master to
instruct you; let it then be your care, having such worthy Patterns of
imitation laid before you, for a square and a rule to direct you in your youth,
as few have the like, to add thereunto wisdom and learning, your self, as
far as in you lie, by diligence in your study, which will be the most
absolute and perfect way, to make you a complete Gentleman, that as you
patriseat your father every way in person, so you may strive to imitate him as
near as you can in virtue, whose instructions go not alone, only as daily
Moniters, to dissuade and dehort you from that which is ill: but his examples
are as so many lectures read unto you, to exhort and encourage you to that
which is good. As you would not then have others go before you in riches,
which of Philosophers and Poets are called the gods of Fortune: so let not
others go before you in learning, which is the Mother of Virtue and
Perfection, and without which, a man, though never so rich, is but as a sheep
(as Demosthenes terms him) with a golden fleece, or an ^mage curiously
trimmed, and richly pain^ed over with fine gold, and beautiful colors. Study
and labor then to get knowledge, learning, wisdom, and understanding now
whilst you are young, being less painful (as one says) to learn in youth,
than to be ignorant in age. A man's whole life time indeed, ought to be a
continual study, for no man can be too old to learn, yet a man's infancy and
childhood is the chiefest time; when the foundation and groundworke of this
building is to be laid. He that goes about to build a house, begins it not in
the Winter, but in the Spring, that he may have the Summer before him to finish
his work; yet better to begin it in the Winter then not at all: so he that
would be a good scholar, must not begin to fall to his book and study when
he is a man, or in his declining age, but in his childhood and youth; yet
better to learn in his old age, then not at all, as one to that effect writes
thus: It is fitter for young men to learn, then to teach, and for old men to
teach then to learn; and yet fitter for old men to learn, then to be
ignorant* but there is no man that can learn so much, that he shall need to
learn no more and I hope I shall not live so long, that ^ shall be too old to
learn. How excellen^ a thing then is learning, that is so requisit^ in all
both old and young, but especially in young? that as Job speaks of Wisdom, so
may I say of learning; it is so excellent, that man knows not the value
thereof; it cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the
price thereof; it cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
Onix, or the Sapphire, the gold and the crystal, cannot equal it, and the
exchange of it, shall not be for jewels, of fine gold. No mention shall be
made of Coral, or of Pearls; for the price of learning is above Rubies, which
made grave Plato in contemplation thereof, cry out and say, Oh Science, how
would men love and esteem thee, if they knew thee right, and well might he do
it; for it is the lightest burden, and richest merchandise that a man can
possibly traffic in, or carry about him, a fountain whereunto ^l may go,
and yet can never be drawn ^ry, from whence flows such delicious ^eet
springs, that the more a man drinks ^ereof, the more he desires it. In a
lord, it is the very lamp of life, chief ^uide to Arts and all perfection.
Thus ^ave you heard what an excellent thing earning is; you have heard, I say,
for as solomon speaks A wise man will hear, and ^ill increase in learning.
Let me then entreat ^ou, nay rather advise you (although your ^ervant)
whatsoever you get, dig, or ^elve for, as I may say, whilst you live ^ere in
this earthly tabernacle made with ^ands, to be sure to get that inestimable em
of learning, which will stick by you ^hen all other treasures will vanish and
^and you in no stead: and to be so far in ^ve therewith, as with the
Philosopher, o think that day lost, wherein you have ^ot learned somewhat. Oh,
Sir, I would to ^od, (I speak it from my heart, for the ^ve I bear unto you)
I were as well able ^ willing, to advise you, and my best in^evours (without
any ceremony or com^lement) should lie prostrate at your worships feet to do
you service. I confess Multis simulationum involuris tegitur, and qua^ velis
quibusdam obtenditur, every man's hea^ is hid with many clokes of dissimulation
and is covered, as it were, with curtain drawn before, that one can scarce
believ^ another, there is so much flattery, hypocrisy and by-respects, used in
the world yet I profess seriously unto you, as yo^ have my Epistle, you have
my heart, an^ I desire no otherways to be accounted then as I am,

Your true and faithful servant, WALTER GOSNOLD

A Postscript.
IT is not long since it pleased your good Father, out of the courteous favor
and loving respect he bears to every schollerlike action, to grace me with a
worthy acceptance of an Anagram which once I presented unto him, upon his own
Name, which, lest antiquity should race it out of the old stock, by process
of time* which wears, eats, and consumes up all things; you being his eldest
Son, of his Name, and every way like unto him, I have thought fit to revive
it in the young branch, by presenting of it the second time unto your self
that as it represents and shows what your fathers life is, and has been: so
it may demonstrate and lay open unto you, not only what your life ought to
have been, and what it now should be, but what it must be, if ever you would
be truly like your Father, or have your life and Anagram concur and agree
together, and therefore let it be your care, to look daily upon it, as in a
glass, that thereby you may be put in mind, to see whether or no you are, or
desire truly to be such a one, as the Anagram of your Name does foreshew you to
be, that you may with the more safety arrive at the wished haven of endless
happiness, which every blessed man shall one day be pertaker of. In which
navigation, or progress, upon the tempestuous Sea of this wide world, I leave
you to that perfect guide and sure pilot, Christ Jesus, who has both the
winds, and waters at his command, to bring you with safety to his Fathers
House: to which place, the Lord of his mercy bring you, and us all, being the
full fruition of the reward laid up for all such as lead a blessed life.

An Anagram upon the Name of the right worshipful, Sr. Thomas Bows, Knight,
presented to the worshipful young gentleman, his son and heir, Mr. Thomas
Bows Esquire.
Anagram
THOMA BOWS Beatus Homo.
T ruth, justice, valor, equity, and right
H e holds in hand, to do his country good:
O bedient to Gods Laws, both day and night
M aintaining love, in every brotherhood,
A lmes deeds, where need requires, he is not slack
S o helpful to the poor he is that lack.
B elov'd he is of all, hated of none,
O nely the bad, because he sin reproves
W here wickedness is, he does still bemone
E arth wants more such, whose days are but a span
S uch like as these, foreshew a blessed man.
An Epigram upon him that shall find fault with this Anagram.
You of this Anagram may disallow,
The reason is, because thete wants you,
If you be it, that makes my Anagram not right,
I Will put in you, and then my Anagram is right.
Another to Momus.
O Momus why, why do you scoff at me?
In spying faults, where is no faults to see;
If you do spoil this Anagram of mine,
Why blam'st thou me, when as the fault is thine?
Another Epigram.
Some squibbing at my Anagram, said it was wrong,
Much like my verse, either too short or else too long
Say what they will, there wants but half a letter,
Take pen and mendit, and I Will remain their debtor.
To the envious Reader.
Pale faced Reader, do thou envy me?
I thought thou would have sought hier to clime
More fitting for your place and pedigree,
Then to look down so low, to view my rhyme;
If it be so, against nature you will see it
You, face to face, my verse shall dare to meet.
An Anagram upon the Name of the virtuous and well disposed young gentlewomen,
my much honored friend, and loving kinswoman, Mistress Elizabeth Barington,
wherein is lively set forth the rebellion and daily opposition betwixt the
flesh and spirit, nature and grace in the best of Gods children, being more
prone by nature to that which is ill, then by grace unto that which is good,
Romans 7. 21.

A good Name is better than great riches, and it endures for ever, Prove. 22. 1
Ecclus. 41. 13. Our Names are written in heaven. Luke 10. 20. ELIZABETH

ANAGRAM.
The spirit moving concerning the inner Man, in mymind, I delight in the Law of
God, Romans 7. 22. On, git zeal in heart. Godly sorrow works zeal in us, 2
Cor. 7. 11. Its good to be zealous in a good thing Gal. 4. 18. OR, The flesh
resisting. O, who shall deliver me from this body of sin? The good that I
would, that do I not, but that I would not do, that do I, Romans 7. 19. Git no
zeal in heart. There is a zeal not according to knowledge, Romans 10. 2.

Thus the flesh stays, even the most perfect to go forward. By nature we
are the children of wrath, sold under sin: but by grace are we made righteous

Verses upon the Subject.
BEhold, twixt grace and nature, what great strife
Is in each man, and virtuous woman's life,
Where grace does put us on, and prick us forth,
There nature pullsus back, as too too loath,
To do that which is good, but all the ill
That can be done, nature will have her will,
If God assisting puts not to his hand,
Dame nature over grace, will have command,
And grace out of our hearts at last will thrust,
Making us captive to each sinful lust.
Get faith, get love, get zeal in heart says grace,
But none of these (say nature) do embrace.
For natural man delights not in these,
His appetite, they no ways do him please.
Natures chief aim, is his own glorious praise,
When grace never seeks it self, but God always.
The balance is uneven, and overswaid,
Where grace and nature are together weighed.
Why nature then is so bad, it is no wonder,
Being that nature is not kept more under.
Give me a heart, O God, I do thee pray,
Where grace, not nature may have chiefest sway.
Grace does invite you to get zeal in heart,
Nature forbids you, thereof to take part,
Examine well your heart, do not combine,
But search your ways, to which you do incline.
Where nature good, with store of grace does meet,
There is a life of harmony most sweet.
A woman mild, of nature loving kind,
Indu'd with grace, best fits an honest mind.
A nature fiery hot, a zeal key cold,
Become no woman living, young nor old.
Has nature outwardly adorned thy face?
Deck inwardly thy soul with splendant grace.
Beg it of God, as he has given thee store,
So that he would increase it more and more,
Proceed, go on in grace, thy glass does run,
Leave thou not off, until thy thread be spun.
Heaven's of more worth, then earthly treasure here,
Lose earth for heaven, tho friends to thee be dear.
Lord ravish thou my soul with heavens delight,
To work my peace before the dismal night.
Good natural parts will stand us in no stead,
If parted hence from living to the dead.
Thy name peruse, and bear it in thy mind,
And see if thou no contradiction find.
Thou can not zealous be on no condition,
But thou shall even there meet with opposition.
Resist thou not Gods spirit in thy soul,
Though Satan instantly does thee control.
Weeds springs up in every fruitful ground,
The like in every one is to be found.
The flesh against the spirit does rebel,
If we the flesh resist, it will be well.
Sweet Jesus make me zealous in my youth,
And bold for to maintain with zeal thy truth.
But yet O God, I this desire of thee,
That unto knowledge I may zealous be*
The times does call for zeal, lets pray with zeal*
That God in mercy to this land may deal.
WALTER GOSNOLD.

An Ode, or Carroll in the praise and commendation of learning.
THe poor that live in needy rate,
By learning does great riches gain,
The rich that live in wealthy state,
By learning do their wealth maintain,
Thus rich and poor are furthered still,
By sacred rules of learned skill.
The simple man by learning is
Unto great height of wisdom grown,
The prudent man through learning is
In grace and virtue always known:
So wise and simple simpathies
By learned Science to grow wise.
The child that's weaned from the teat
Has not such cause, for to complain,
As he that wants this heavenly meat,
His hungry soul for to sustain.
Then strive for learning what you can,
For learning makes the richest man.
^old, silver, pearls, and precious stones
^ man may have, yet be but poor,
^s learning that do save the bones,
^hen richer men must labor more.
^hen learning prize above thy wealth,
^or that's the way to raise thy self.
^ want the skill for to express
The World of good that learning does
^o all mankind, both more and less,
Though to attain it man be loath.
Learning is that which will avail,
And stick to man when riches fail.
All fond conceits of frantic youth
The golden gift of learning stays,
Of doubtful things to search the truth,
Learning sets forth the ready ways:
O happy him, do I repute,
Whose breast is fraught with learnings fruit.
There grows no corn within the field
That ox and plough did never till,
Right so the mind no fruit can yield,
That is not led by learnings skill.
Of Ignorance comes rotten weeds,
Of learning springs right noble deeds.
Like as the Captain has respect
To train his soldiers in array,
So learning has man's mind direct:
By virtues staff his life to stay,
Though friends and fortune do wax scant,
Yet learned men shall never want.
To the well, or ill disposed Reader, I care not which.
REader, who ere thou art, that reads this little book*
search not for others crimes,
but thy own faults there look.
Where thou shall find thy self, so like a criple halt,
That thou no time wilt have, to spy an others fault:
Therefore let me advise thee, and inform thy mind
For to reform thy faults, before thou fault do find.
Falts may have escaped my heedlesse pen I do confess
But what is that to thee, if thine be nere the less.
Mend then thy own, before thou others teach or school
Left for thy labor thou be'st thought a prating fool.
For fond it is a moat in others works to spy
V nlesse thou first do pull the beam out of thy eye,
Which hides from seeing in thy self one fault of ten,
But sets your eyes wide open, to laugh at other men.
For who is he that ever writ, that you can name
Whose pen by such as you, could freed be from blame.
With malice then against me swell, with envy burst,
I never will be vexed, since I am not the first.
But gentle courteous reader, if thou do intend,
In reading this, such faults as you do find to mend,
Without reproachful scurvie terms, disdainful taunts
Distilled from wicked minds, where envy daily haunts,
And speak the best, what ere it is you read or see,
To such as any way shall laugh or squib at me,
I shall be thankful, which ingratitude disdaines,
And ever mindful be, for to requite your pains,
By troubling you hereafter in an other strain,
Which may perhaps more pleasing be unto your vain.
^he mean time, embrace grave Catos precepts mild,
^o ere thou art that reads them, man, woman, or child.
^d therefore honest matrons, if so be you please
be so courteous, as to accept of these
^re lines, which offer here themselves unto your view
read at your own leisure, when it pleases you;
^d not to be displeased, or cast an angry brow
^ me, as if my labors, you did disallow,

Ad librum suum.
MY little book, whom will thou please, tell m^
All which shall read thee? no that cannot be
Whom then? the best. But few of them there are;
And for the bad thou shall not need to care.
If at the mean thou aymst, thou aymst too high,
The meaner sort commend not poetry.
How will thou give content then to these elves?
Please not the fools, but let them please themselves.
Pass by the worst, and set by them no store,
Please well the best, thou shall not need please more.
Ad curiosum lectorem.
MEthinks some curious Reader, I hear say,
That Latin verse in English, is not fit:
My book is plain, and would have if it may,
An English Reader, but a Latin wit.

Nec minus otiosus, quam cum otiosus.

MARCUS AVSONIVS HIS FOUR BOOKS Of Moral Precepts, Entitled CATO:
Translated out of Latin Hexameters into English meter.
The Preface.
CVm animadverterem quamplurimos homines graviter errare in via morum,
succurrendum and consulendum eorum opinioni fore existimavi, maxim, ut
gloriose viverent, and honor^m contingerent. Nunc te, fili charissime, docebo,
quo pacto mores animi tui componas. Igitur praecepta mea ita legas, ut
intelligas: legere enim and non intelligere, negligere est.

WHen I observed how many men
in manners went awry,
And grossly erred in their course
from paths of piety.
I thought by counsel to amend
if happily I might
what was amiss, and teach men how
to live in happy plight.
Now therefore my beloved son
I will inform thy mind
^o walk a course, whereby thou may
both praise and profit find.
(Therefore) my precepts read, as that by thee
they may be understood,
For why to read, and not regard
is to neglect thy good.
The first book of Moral Precepts.

as writings testify,

in souls pure verity.

affords nourishment.

the unbridled tongue to tame:
Next unto God he is that can
with reason rule the same.

The living speeches of CATO, a Dying man.
C Here up my panting feeble heart, fear not to die,
A ll must die once, some twice, such is man's destiny.
T i am finish that which God allots, welcome sweet death;
O Lord to thee I yield my soul who gave me breath.
A Postscript to the Reader.
NOw I this work performed have
and sent it to the Press:
I know that some will call me fool,
and sure I am no less,
For printing that, which long ago
by others was set out:
Which is untruth, as I can prove,
if any thereof doubt.
For though it has translated been
as I do not deny
Grammatically into prose;
yet not in poetry,
As I haved one, therefore I say,
who blames my enterprise,
If they can find no other fault,
I say they are not wise.
Farewell.

To I. B. that Grammatically translated CATO.
HAd I but seen thy work before
I finished up had mine,
I would have mended every line
by that bright lamp of thine.
Who taken has such pains therein
to give each word his due;
That no translator I have known,
has done the like but you.
And had thou set those lines on feet
that thou have done in prose:
Thy friends alone would not thee praise,
but even thy very foes;
But thou did it for scholars good
that they may profit find:
Not for thy own glory and praise,
which shows a noble mind.
Wherefore for this thy love thou bearst
to infants yet unborne:
Thy name, thy fame, and memory
shall never be outworne.
Walter Gosnold.

Three Lessons tha^ old CATO (as he did lie o^ his deathbed) gave unto his
young sonn^ CATO to be observed and kept, translated first out of Dutch into
English prose, by o^ Laurence Singleton, and now metamorphosed into English
meter, with the rest of his most worthy Precepts, by W. G.
O happy is that man, which sees others fall
And can avoid the snare that they were caught witha^*
THy wife being* wise, make her the closet
Of thy breast; else not, for she will disclose it.
For never yet was man so well aware,
But first or last, was caught in woman's snare.
Then trial make, before thou do her trust
In any thing, thou fearst she will be unjust:
As here old Cato's son did wisely try
Whether his wife could keep his secrecy.
To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, having already presented thee with many good Lessons, and
moral Instruction of Cato, which daily and hourly he taught unto his young
son: I likewise have thought fit, to present unto thy view three precepts
more, which he left unto him upon his deathbed, to be observed and kept above
all other Precepts and Commaudements formerly left him in writing, which rust
had almost consumed, and time buried in oblivion, had I not by chancc lighted
upon them, in an old Antiquaries library, and put upon their backs new
liveries, their old ones being quite out of fashion, and therefore altogether
out of request with those which otherwise might be their sociates, and
fellow-companions, being almost an hundred thirty years since they were last
printed, and translated out of Dutch into our mother tongue. Wherefore having
taken such pains in the metamorphosing of them to the same habit or style of
the rest of his most worthy Precepts, I trust they will not be unwelcome unto
thee, being no less worthy of acceptance than the former: for as my Author
wished good in translating them into English prose, so likewise do I in
metamorphosing them into English meter, following my copy in the phrase of our
speech, without adding or diminishing, either in substance or circumstance, as
near as possibly I could. If any then be so curious, as to distaste these my
poor endeavors, for the plainness of the verse, or the dislike of the
Author, being a heathen, I Will make no other apology for my self and him, but
this: For the first, it is the height of my ambition to adorn every action
with the most plainest proper object, especially where I have a pattern laid
before me for my imitation; as for the latter, it is no shame for us to learn
wit of Heathens, neither is it material in whose school we take out a good
lesson. Howsoever therefore my unpolished work shall be accepted at thy hands,
yet shall I not have cause to repent me of my labonr, for the benefit that may
come thereby, and so I conclude,

Yours assured, though there be no assurance amongst men. WALTER GOSNOLD.

A caveat to all young married men, to beware how they lay open themselves, or
trust too far at first to their wives secrecy in any weighty matter, tending
either to the loss of their lives, goods, or good name, before they be well
grounded in their wives honesty and fidelity.
IF thou'st a wife, in any case
show not thy self so kind:
As to relate, each weighty cause
unto her of thy mind.
Until that thou have trial made
of her that is but young;
And do perceive whether that she
be mistress of her tongue.
Or else too late you will repent
that hastily you told
In secrecy such things to her
which bluntly she will unfold,
Before her Gossips, when she meets
with other prattling wives:
Bringing their husbands many times
in peril of their lives.
As here you may right well behold
in this ensuing story,
The falsehood of young Cato's wife
that should have been his glory.

How a wife is sympathis'd to a vine, being both very useful, and yet very
hurtful.
HOw Wives compared are to vines
I shall not need recite:
For Poets many in this strain
endeavored have to write.
And set it forth with best of skill.
I then shall do amiss
To tautologies: yet briefly,
in few words thus it is:
The fruitful Vine, and virtuous Wife
are both for Man's delight:
For shade and comfort in the day,
and solace in the night.
To good ends both of them were made,
and so they both are still:
But oftentimes they are abused
unto most dangerous ill.
And then we find it so fall out,
that these two weaker things
Do overcome the strong and wise
yea Emperors and Kings.
W. G.

A loving exhortation to all young married women, that they discover not that
in the day, which their husbands acquaint them withal in the night.
YOu whose resplendent beauty sets on fire
Your Husbands love: and whose modest attire
Suits their estates, making the world admire
Your comely personage, and sects desire.
Let not your tongues be as a piercing dart
Or two-edged sword, to cut in twain their heart,
With words of horror, to their gentle ear
Which no mild Husband can endure to hear.
Or fondly tattle to your friends abroad
The secrets of your best beloved Lord.
This is a thing befits not your estate.
Let Beldames scould, and idle Gossips prate.
More modest carriage, should be in your years
What age so ere you are, as well appears.
For marry with a Virgin, old or young
She scarcely can offend, but with her tongue.
Then strive to tame that little member stout
Though set on fire of hell, or pluck it out.
To live at peace else, it will be a wonder
When in the house, wives makes such a thunder,
Or privately, does whisper to their friends
Their Husbands secret counsels to vile ends
Babbling what comes next unto their tongues
With heavy sighs, as if they would spit their longues
This full out is as ill, as all the rest
For both are bad, I know not which is best.
But some will scould at home, and prate abroad
That's worst of all, and most to be abhord.
Such wives there be, i would wish man no worse evil
Then to be plagued, with such a shrewish devil.
Abandon therefore all you that are wives
Such double wrongs, and quickly mend your lives.
It Is not your beauties will your husbands please,
If you be guilty of such crimes as these.
Nor yet your smiles, and flattering looks avail,
When you are given so much to scold and rail.
Without any just cause at girds and fits
As if you were distract, out of your wits,
Disgracing quite your hansome comely parts
Having fair faces, but false wicked hearts.
Then in a word, be as your Emblem shows
Loving unto your husbands, and not shrews,
For to have wives, it is the worst of evils,
To look like Saints, and yet be worse than devils.
So leave I you, each woman in her place,
Desiring God assist you with his grace.
W. G.

Three Lessons that old Cato (as he did lie in his bed) gave unto his son
Cato, to be observed and kept, above all other Precepts and Commandments
formerly left him in writing.
CAto being wise, and of an understanding wit,
Roms government he had, in judgment seat did sit,
And came to such high honor, and so great estate
That none in all the City were so fortunate.
Great offices he had, who did them well supply
Performing worthy deeds, deserving memory.
This Cato had a son, who was of his own name
As Authors manifold, do witness still the same.
When he was very old, and long time had been sick,
Nature being spent, not finding help by physic,
Perceiving i^ himself the day of death drew near
He called to him his son, whom he loved dear,
And in most decent wise, to him he did declare
His mind and full intent, as after you shall hear.
Saying, my dear and loving son, its long that I
Have lived here, my time draws near that I must die
And leave this wretched world, which is full of misery,
Deaths stroke uncertain is, yet may one it descry.
Wherefore I gladly would thee teach while I have breath
how to behave thy self, my son, after my death
That thou unto the Commonwealth may ever be
A member sound and good, from wicked vices free.
And so always to live, without reproach or shame
To the joy of friends, and increase of thy good name.
Remember many precepts I have left behind,
Writ heretofore of me, for to instruct thy mind,
Which to thy profit may redownd, if thou have wit
Those documents to follow, as becomes thee fit.
Yet notwithstanding all those rules and lessons good
I formerly have given thee, to be understood,
There be three more, which I will charge thee to observe
And keep'bove all the rest, and not from the^ to swarve.
The first Precept.
THe first precept that I of thee require
And charge thee keep, is never to aspire
To any Office of high dignity
For to advance thy self, and pedigree
By the Emperor, who is free to give
So long as thou sufficient have to live.
Or any other Prince thy state to raise
To a more higher pitch of greater praise.
For he that is content, lives most at rest.
The mean estate is ever counted best
Most sure it is, and most comfort does bring,
And he that has it, has as much as King
Or Emperor may have, no man therefore
Ought to demand or ask of God no more.
Wherefore great folly it is I say for such
As have enough, and yet repine and grutch
At that they have: yea very dangerous
That of preferment art so covetous
And through desire of honor, too greedy
To put themselves so much in jeopardy
To lose both their estates, there lives and lands,
Their goods, and all they have within their hands.
For he that does presume above his state
Instead of love, incurres but deadly hate.
As daly we may see, where greatness is,
Their envy does not want, nor malice miss.
Against those that seek to be promoted high
Through false reports, are faint in prison lie
And lose all that they have, such is their fall
That have enough, yet would have more than all.
Honor is that the mind does covet most,
And no dishonor like that honor lost.
And truly my beloved son be wise,
Great Princes are of diverse qualities,
And sometimes overcome through false report
And flattery of rich and greater sort.
Against those subjects, who are most faithful true
I then advise thee keep my precepts few.
The second Precept.
I charge thee not prolong, whilst thou have breath
The life of him that has deserved death;
Especially whose evil wicked fame
Has been a common scandal to his name.
For all those evils which he after does,
Or moves others for to do, insooth
Thou guilty art, as is himself therein
And art partaker with him of the sin.
And as the old and common proverb have,
He that a thief does from the gallows save,
He for himself a hangman does provide,
Or keeps one in store, as often betide,
To do him an ill turn in time to come;
Of this beware, my dear and loving son.
The third Precept.
THe last precept i will give thee in my life
For so observe, is first to prove thy wife
To know if she can secret keep those things
Which touch thy honest name, discredit brings,
Before to her, thou break thy secrecy,
Whereon the loss of lands and life does lie.
For there be multitudes, I do suppose
That nothing can keep secret, but disclose
All things that they have knowledge of, or find
To be reported to their fickle mind.
And few the number be, that trusty are
Secrets to keep, and never them declare.
After that Cato had thus given his son
These three Commandments, and with them done;
Willing they should observed be and kept,
He shortly after with his fathers slept;
And yielded this his mortal brittle life,
To deaths remorslesse stroke, that fatal knife*
In few years after Cato his decease
Had of these earthly cares a full release,
His son in learning, being excellent
Beloved of poor, and those of high descent
Amongst the noble, and ignoble sort
Of Rome: for's virtuous life, and good report*
The Emperor thereof being informed
By trusty friends, how well he was adorned
With courteous, modest, kind behavior*
He unto him had such a liking favor,
That presently his son, was his intent
For to commit, unto his government.
That to the end, in all good science he
And literature, might instructed be.
And for the accomplishment of this, amain
He sends for Cato, and him entertain
Into the Court, and put into his hand,
Diverse affairs of weight, and great command,
Showing him daily friendships more or less,
And pleasures great, abounding in excess;
And at the last, preferred him with great grace
Unto that worthy office and high place
Of the sole rule and Cities government
Of famous Rome; wherewith he was content.
When Cato on him had his office took,
And fortune smiling on him seemed to look,
According to the custom, it did betide.
He through the City in great pomp did ride,
Where he did meet a mighty company
Leading a thief, which was condemned to die,
Toward the place of execution,
For to be hanged with expedition,
Being a lusty proper handsome man.
Wherefore Cato had pity on him, an
Diverse that were there, moving him thereto,
Saying, he by his office might let go
At his first entering, any prisoner,
Which would to all, redowne his praises far.
Cato with pity, being then indu'd,
Willing to satisfy the multitude,
Without advisement, did the prisoner save,
Thinking thereby, the glory straight to have,
Of his promotion known, and the great love
He had to prisoners poor, which did him move,
Regarding not, or calling unto mind
The good advise, his father left behind.
In short time after his preferment, he
Performing his office in amity
Unto the Cities wealth, comfort of all
The Inhabitors thereof great and small.
As he lay in his bed taking no rest,
For the continual cares that did molest
His troubled thoughts, about the great affairs
Of his said office; straightwaies he repaires
And recollects those Precepts at the last
His wise father had given him long since past.
So that a long time after, night by night
He called them to mind as his delight,
^onsidering with himself, how that he
^ad broken two, and rest but one of three
which was to prove, if that his wife could keep
^cret those things, that should to light but peep
^^downe to his dishonor, with fortune cost
^is life and goods in danger to be lost.
^^to determined then within his mind
^o prove his wife, as's father had assigned.
and thereupon a servant of his own
that trusty was, and to himself well known
^e did command the Emperors son to take
Whom he had to instruct) all speed to make
and secretly him to convey iwis
unto a trusty faithful friend of his,
and a great nobleman, there to remain
^ntill that he did send for him again.
which was performed, as he did direct
^or one there was, did any thing suspect.
^^en shortly after on a certain night
^erceiving that his wife was in good plight
^d broad awake, began to sigh and mourn
^d privily within himself to groan.
which thing his wife perceiving did require
^ him to know the cause, who did admire
^o see his heaviness. Quoth she my dear,
^n grief, let sorrow cease, be of good cheer,
^d all things take (my husband) in good part.
(...) as a wife, I love thee with my heart.
^en turned he himself unto his wife,
Sighing so sore, as if she haled for life,
Saying sweet loving wife, and tender heart,
I have a secret matter to impart
To thee, if that I wist thou could be mute,
Though some to thee should make continual su^
To know thereof, which stands upon my life,
Honor and goods; therefore my loving wife,
Should thou reveal, what I do thee injoyne
Be secret in, you undo me and mine.
Then answered his wife, seemiug to cry,
Saying, dear husband, I had rather dye,
Then open any secret you declare;
Therefore such speeches, husband, pray forbear^
Alas! what woman think you me to be?
That cannot keep your secrets close, quoth she
Have you not seen my honesty thro^ghout,
And good carriage; wherefore then do you done
Of me? wh o knows your welfare in such measur^
That I esteem't above all worldly treasure?
Well, my beloved spouse and bedfellow,
Said Cato then, seeing you thus do vow,
And that I hear you do so friendly speak,
My hidden secrets to you I will break,
Laying my heart wide open unto thee,
Whom I do trust 'bove all assuredly;
For I do love thee, my dear wife so well,
That nothing can I keep from thee, but tell
What ere it be, I either know or do,
And much the more, because thou do me woo^
Some two days past, as I did homeward come*
^here met with me, the emperors only son,
and used me most vildely in his words,
and naughty deeds, as youth such vice affords,
which stirred me to such an angry rage,
that I could not forbear, my fury swage,
^ing with weighty affairs troubled,
and overcome with drink, I struck him dead
^ heat of blood, (not leaving me to vex)
which does me grieve, and much my soul perplex.
^urther, my furious mood to satisfy,
and deadly hate, that in my breast did lie,
^ript his body, and took out his heart,
and caused it to be dressed, with best of art
^ost finely spiced, as a man would wish,
and sent it to his parents, as a dish
^f dainty curious meat, who were not nice,
^o eat thereof as much as them suffice,
^ot knowing it to be that which it was.
^hus I my anger did revenge, alas,
that shall I do? for now I know right well,
that this most wicked deed, which has befell
^e to commit, is a most shameful act;
and I am very sorry for the fact.
^t too late it is, and above man's power
^or to recall again the day and hour
^hats past; wherefore seeing that it is done,
^ secret keepe't, reveal it unto none:
^r I never showed it any in my life,
^or never will, but to thy self, dear wife,
^ whom depends my only stay and trust,
That you will keep my secrets firm and just,
And knowing you right-well, always to be
A sober modest woman, as I see,
No wanton idle gossiper abroad
A thing in women much to be abhorred;
I am the more imboldned to impart
To you sweet love the secrets of my heart.
When as his wife the circumstance had heard
Of all the matter, no time was deferd
For to deplore with heavy heart and meed
The sinful act of this most wicked deed.
Yet solemnly she vowed to have a care
That during life, she nere would it declare
To any one: thus having past that night
With heaviness, until the morning light,
And after a small time, till it befell
A Gentlewoman, that near by did dwell
Within the City, her familiar friend
Who always knew her mind to the full end
To whom she used continually express
All her whole secret counsel, more or less.
As they discoursed had of many things,
The wife of Cato sighs, her hands she wrings.
Wherefore this Gentlewoman asked of her
What caused her grief, her sadness and demur
And why she sighed many times, saying,
Good Mistress show me, is it any thing?
Are you with grief possessed, do you find?
O^ heaviness in stomach, heart, or mind?
Yea truly very great, said Cato's wife,
But I dare not reveal it, for my life;
I Would rather die, and lay my head full low,
Then any one alive should of it know.
Mistress, said she, distracted were all those,
That would such hidden secrets ere disclose*
If you shew't me, i would rather that my teeth
Were pulled ont, or those my eyes that sees,
And that my tongue were torn out with reproach,
Then I to any one such things should broach.
May I you trust, the wife of Cato says?
Yea said the Gentlewoman by my faith.
Well then your faithful promise to me give,
I promise you, said the other, while I live,
By heaven and earth. And when she thus had sworn,
No oaths were left, or promises forborne.
Then she began at length with dreadful fear,
And dolorous heavy heart, for to declare
How that her husband, with anger being filled,
In furious rage the Emperors son had killed.
And caused his heart with spices to be dressed
In decent comely sort, as he thought best,
And to the Emperor and Empress it sent
That they have eaten it with great content.
When as all this the Gentlewoman heard,
Of this mischance, she was abasht and scared.
Being so vile and an ungodly deed.
Saying, its strange to hear such darnell seed
Should spring in so discreet a worthy man,
Whose life has been upright and just: who can
Believe he now with sin should be compact,
And overseene, to do so bad a fact.
Yet nere the less, since it was come to pass
(Said she) I unto you my promise pass
Assuredly all things in secret keep*
Till death close up my eyes in endless sleep.
And at her parting, bound with solemn oaths
To be her secret friend, no part thereof disclose.
But when she was a going toward home,
Weighing this new tidings, and what might come*
Fearing the danger great that might ensue
To her and her husband, if she were true,
And keep in secret what to her was shown,
That afterward might be reveald and known.
Also considering the favor great
She might obtain, and friendships often entreat
At the Emperors hands in showing the report
She with all speed returned to the Court,
And at her coming there she did not miss
To have access unto the Empress.
And then she kneeled down upon her knee,
Doing her duty to her Majesty:
In humble wise, with tears she then began
To say, most gracious Lady, if you can
I would beseech you give me leave to speak
A word or two with you in secret cake
Of a great weighty matter, I did hear
Of certainty reported to my ear.
The Empress hearing this, with willing heart
Caused her Ladies all to go apart
From forth her sight, that she in secret may
Know what the Genelewoman had to say.
When thus they were, all but themselves alone
The Gentlewoman with a heavy mo^e
Began to say: my sovereign, the care
And ardent faithful love that I do bear
Unto your Ladyship, makes me repeat
What else I would not, though you should entreat.
Besides the many comforts I inherit
And daily do expect above my merit
Moves me to come, and open unto you
A secret hidden thing, wherein I vow
No creature living should it ever know,
Except your self, to whom my life I ow?
For unto me it were a filthy shame,
And an impeachment unto my good name,
It to disclose, were not unto your grace
Which touch you near, your progeny and race.
Therefore I Will show you, what I have been told,
Excuse me Madam, if I be too bold.
It is well known to all the world abroad,
That you, and your most gracious loving Lord
Loves Cato more than any other man,
As well appears by your free giving han.
For you have given him many sundry gift,
And him advanced, as you him thought befit
To the chief office, government and doom
Of all the whole City of famous Rome.
And more, for the great zeal you to him have
And for his further honor, to him gave
Your son to govern, and him up to bring
In sage humanity, and good learning.
But he such service has you done in lieu
That in his beastly rage your son has slew
And took his heart out of his body sweet,
Trimmd it with spices, a thing unmeet
Thereof to you a present made with meat
And to your Lord, the which you both have eat.
The Empress at this news being amazed,
And musing in her self, to hear this blazed,
Said to the gentlewoman, what a fable
Or story do you show me, in a rabble?
Then answered she, that which I Have said to you
Most gracious Lady, is most certain true.
For truly in great secret it was shown
Me, by the mouth of his own wife: unknown
To him. Which when the Empress understood
Believing it for truth, she waxed wood,
And cried out aloud, with voice so shrill
That with the Echo did the Palace fill.
Making such sorrowful complaints and groans,
That it to pity would have moved the stones,
Her to have heard or seen. When the report
Came to the Emperor, and in what sort
The Empress such lamentation made,
He wondered much (his color began to fade)
What it should be, and came to know the cause
Of this her heaviness, making no pause.
But she so pensive was within her heart,
That of long time, her mind could not impart.
Yet at the last with weeping bitter tears
She did recount, and unto him declares
All that the gentlewoman had her showed
Concerning her dear son, with eyes bedewed.
The Emperor, hearing these tidings tart,
And crediting he would eat his own sons heart.
He was outragiously inflamed and vexed,
With anger above measure, and perplexed.
And did command without delay to make
Or further respit, they should Cato take,
And seal up all his houses, goods and lands,
And instantly him hang in hempen bands
Higher than ever any was before
(To others for example) at his door,
And that thereof to make no lingering stay,
But see him put to death without delay.
And executed with all speed and end
As at their perils they would it defend.
This being thus commanded with great charge
By The Emperor himself, in words at large,
There certain trusty men appointed were
For the same purpose, that with heedfull care
Went out forthwith and did him apprehend,
And seaz'd of all the goods God did him send.
Whereat Cato amazed stood a pause,
And did require of them, to know the cause
If they could tell it him. They answered soon
'Twas by the Emperors command and doom
For that he would slain his son, without desert
And caused him to eat his own child's heart.
Then Cato said, my Lords and masters you
All which men say is not of certain true.
Therefore I counsel you that you would put
Me into prison strong, and there me shut
Until next day, and say, that for this night
It is too late, and of no equal right,
To put me unto death, and that I may
To morrow be called forth without delay
Before the people all, there to be heard,
The matters laid against me, and declared.
So forward go in justice, and proceed
Upon my life, as you do find the deed.
And forasmuch as all men did him love,
They did consent wherein he did them move.
And leaving him in prison for a space,
Returned to the Emperor his grace,
Declaring to his Majesty and state,
Him put to death that night it was too late.
Saying to him, that it much better were
The accomplishment of justice to forbear,
Until the morn, who notwithstanding his
Great anger, rage, fury, and heaviness
That he had for the death of his dear son,
Did as the Lords advised him to be done.
Now whiles that they great company along
Were leading Cato unto prison strong,
He called his trusty servant, as he went
To him, by whom the Emperors son was sent
Unto a noble Lord of that Country
A friend of his, mean while his wife to try
Concerning matters, which he would discuss
Commanding him, saying in secret thus:
Go with all speed unto my faithful friend,
Where thou did leave th'Emperors son, God send
Him life, whom the Emperor thinks dead,
And make thou haste, least I die in his stead.
And will him that to morrow before noone
He fail not to come to me, so soon,
And bring with him the Emperors son amain
Unto his place, who thinks I have him slain.
For which I now in prison am, you see
Expecting death shortly to summon me,
And without doubt in time he does not come
I shall as thou perceivest, receive my doom,
Now it thou love me, do thy diligence
Not sparing horse, nor gripple for expense.
Upon which words, his servant made no stay
But taking leave, with speed rode fast away.
So that about midnight, he came right well
Unto the place where the said Lord did dwell,
Who was to Cato a familiar friend,
A Lord, whose worthy fame all did commend.
Therefore he had him sent, the Emperors son
So secretly as possible might be done
In his tuition him to have in store
While he this thing would prove, as ye heard before.
When Cato's servant to the place came late,
He hastily then knocked at the gate,
Whereas the Lord his habitation had,
And called out aloud with voice most glad.
Having at last approacht that Palace good,
And they within having now understood
From whence he came, they opened speedily
The gates, and brought him where the Lord did lie,
And The Emperors son, whom Cato did conduct,
Given him in charge to teach and to instruct.
Then did the Lord demand, who did him send,
And how his master did, his chiefest friend;
And what the occasion was (for to relate)
That he came in such speedy haste so late.
When he had done his masters due respect,
And no whit of his service did neglect;
Then he declared unto the Lord at last,
How that his Master was in prison fast:
And that command was given that he should die
To morrow morn, through rumor of a lie,
And false report, which on him is begun
To The Emperor, that he has slain his son,
And caused him eat the heart of his own child:
Thus they his fancy led, and him beguild.
When Catoes servant, giving them to understand
How men had showed the Emperor, out of hand,
That Cato had his son inhumane slain,
And therefore did imprisonment sustain,
That on the morrow it was determined
For that offense to be a man but dead:
The Lord and The Emperors son, at this did muse,
And wondered much to hear this heavy news
Of their good friend, incontinent they rose
With all the speed they could, you may suppose.
And called together all their servants ny,
Araying all themselves most speedily.
Especially The Emperors son most kind,
Who was in sorrow great, and grief of mind
For his said master, whom he loved well:
It was not needful as the stories tell
To hasten him for to dispatch, that he
Might with his kind and loving master be.
At the time and place appointed sure
His master should the stroke of death endure,
If fortune did not better him betide,
So they with posting speed, did thither ride.
Here will we reft to speak of The Emperors son,
Who taken has his journey new begun
toward his master dear, whom he did love
Entirely, next unto God above.
And come again to Cato where he lie
Inhoved, looking each hour for to die.
If that his faithful servant void of crime,
Came not with the Emperors son in time.
And for so much he was beloved of all
The people throughout Rome both great and small
As a wise man, of understanding great,
Most just in all his ways, and carriage neat.
No briber to purloyne, free from that fact,
Extortioner, not cruel to exact.
There was a friend of his much love professed,
A mighty governor at his request
Kept back and stayed as much as in him ly,
All the executioners of the City,
Who did consent for to absent themselves
Most willingly, for they alas poor elves,
Were grieved to do, that which should ill befall,
Cato, who was beloved of them all.
Yet as Commandment was given indeed
From The Emperor himself, they did proceed,
And Cato carried unto the place
Of execution, an easy pace:
With a great mighty troop and company,
That followed him expecting he should die.
And many people mourned that was there,
And more have mourned would, but that for fear,
That he had done this evil wicked deed
Wherewith he was accused, as some believed.
For there was many wondering at it said,
Amongst themselves, that they were half afraid
It was too true: but there were other-some
Admired he should thus be overcome,
With Satan's tempting and alluring bait,
Who for the souls of men do lie in wait.
Being so virtuous a man and wise,
Could not for truth believe, nor once surmise
That he had done this wicked sinful crime,
As for to kill The Emperors son in's prime,
And caused him for to eat his own sons heart,
Not fearing God, nor who should take his part.
Nor yet regarding loss of goods and lands,
The Emperors frowns, the terror of his hands.
And thus was there great talk both far and nie,
Amongst the Commons all of the City.
Some did believe it true, and some could not,
Yet nerethelesse he led was to the plot
Of execution, where men justice should fulfill
On him, according to The Emperors will.
And when he came to the said place of death,
The gallows ready him to hang beneath,
He made his prayers, and orations
With good and godly exhortations.
And all was finished there nothing lackt
But a hangman to perform the act.
They called fast, for one, but none would hear,
For all themselves absented that was there,
And hid themselves, for the friend of Cato's sake,
What calling ere there was, none would answer make.
Whiles thus this business was plotted well
In the mean time a wonder great befell:
For he whom Cato from the gallows saved
And pardon for his life did get uncrav'd
By the authority of his office,
Came out and did present himself, iwis,
Before the faces of them great and small,
And said on high, with open mouth to all
The people that was there, my Lords the fact
That this man here has done is a vile act.
And not to be excused nor borne withal,
God in his justice for it vengeance call.
And therefore for the love, which I do bear
Unto my Country, and the honest care,
I have to punish with a heavy hand
Such evil doers, as this wicked man,
I am my self here ready without blame
Hangman to be since none will do the same.
When as the multitude of people heard
Him thus to speak, their judgemens no whit spard
To censure him for offering so free
His needless service, as a courtesy
And looking well how he himself behaved
They said, is this not he whom Cato saved
From hanging, which to him was justly due?
And diverse that did know him, said, 'twas true,
It is the same villain and very slave
Whom Cato freed, and his life did save.
Then began the people speak, a great crew,
With one voice openly, it is most true.
A very idiot, and unwise is he
That saves a thief, and lets him go free.
For the proverb is no less true than old,
As by our forefathers has often been told,
The thief that saved is, will most ready be
To hang him who him saved, as we all see.
Cato this wretched villain seeing, said,
Thou wicked fellow, art not thou afraid
That God will power his vengeance upon thee
For being so ungrateful unto me,
As to forget the time is past, but thus
In worldly affairs it goes with us.
As they were reasoning thus of the cause,
Behold the people made a sudden pause.
For they had seen a huge great company
Of mounted horsemen, that were coming ny,
And many other following with speed
After them, on many a gallant Steed,
Making a mighty noise, and calling fast
Unto the people all, with signs in have,
Saying: put not to death that worthy man,
My good and loving master out of han.
But all the while, they wist not what was said,
Yet hoped they his death should be delayed,
Or that some pardon coming was to free
Him from deaths stroke, of cruel destiny.
Of which in heart, they were exceeding glad,
And causd them stay with Cato till they had
Intelligence, as they came riding on
They well perceived it was th'Emperous son,
Who came in haste, as fast as he could ride
With spurs clapped close unto his horses side
Calling and crying still, I pray forbear
To put to death my loving master dear,
Let none lay hands on him, life to deprive
In any case, for I am here alive.
At which, all the whole multitude did muse
Rejoicing much, to hear this joyful nuse.
The Prince approaching spies his Tutor dear
Bound and prepared for execution near,
Then leaps from off his horse, and with quick pace
Goes to his master, whom he does embrace
With such affection, and such hearty will
That mixed with kisses brinish tears distill.
And bands unbinding said, who could devise
Against you good master, and dear friend these lies?
And false reports, whereby your troubles wrough
And greatest danger to your self is brought.
Oh could the Emperor my father dear
Lightly believe, those slanderous tales he hear?
Against you even most entirely beloved
Whose faithfulness to him has been approved.
Th'amazd spectators, while they hear and see,
This gentle carriage, more amazed be.
That their great Emperors son in tears should vent
The joy and great good will, in heart he meant
Unto his Tutor, this they judge to be
A sure presage of future clemency,
For which their praises unto Heaven aspire,
And at these accidents they much admire.
Nay more, this noble Prince the Emprours son,
Makes Cato ride while he on foot does run.
And running holds the raines, as if that he
Some laquy, and not Caesar's son should be.
Thus Cato late condemned, now rides in state,
Through Romes fair streets, unto the Palace gate.
I need not tell the joy and great delight
The people took at this so pleasing sight.
For young and old, the lame, and halt, and blind
Did trudge along, there is none would stay behind.
The news before unto the Court does pass,
To the Emperors presence, and the Emperesse,
Who now forgetting state, in haste do run
To see grave Cato, and their dearest son.
But sudden joy hereat does overpoise
Their natural forces, and their senses ^ies.
They speechless stand, and are amazed quite
And struck with wonder at so strange a sight.
The Emperor reviving now might see
His sons observance and the peoples glee,
At Cato's fortune, how he was misled
By's passion rashly to command his head:
For which he now repenting, and ashamed,
Confessed his rashness, and his foll blamed,
And such salutes to him he does address
As might his love and favor best express.
Then came the Emperors son, and mildly said,
Oh! father dear, how could you be so swaid?
Rashly, without advisement to command
(Against all law, or justice in our Land.)
My faithful master to be put to death,
Ceasing his goods, that he could none bequeath,
Before you did rightwell perceive and prove
The matter clearly, as did you behove
By witnesses sufficient, that those crimes
Unto him laid were true, least aftertimes
Your furious hastiness, did justly blame,
As well they might, with a perpetual shame.
And cheefely for because, you know right well
The like now living, not on earth does dwell.
Had you him put to death, in angry spleen,
Mark I you pray what pity it had been,
And what great loss of him we should have had,
Whose very presence makes our hearts full glad.
Both you and yours, with all Romes City strong
Would have him mist, and that justly ere long.
Nay what relentlesse heart, would not have cried
That such a man, unjustly should have dyed?
Being innocent, as we see at large
And faultlesse of the act laid to his charge.
Truly I think, I nere in all my days
Should have forgotten it, but that always
I borne it should have done within my mind
Unto my grief (as love no less does bind)
And shortning of my life, for that I know
Through his great pains, that to me he did show,
I neither virtue have, not yet learning
But from him flowed, as from a fountain spring.
The Emperor him answer made, my son
Most dear, of us it was most leudly done,
And we thereby great slander should have had
And hinderance, which would have made us sad.
B'ingill reported of, for so great speed
In such a hasty unadvised deed.
And we with all the force and wealth we have
Could not the matter hide, our credit save:
Yet notwithstanding the great love that we
Had toward you, and ardent jelousie
So blinded had our eyes, thinking thy face,
We nere again should see, for to embrace
Thy handsome comely person in our sight
Whom we did look to be our whole delight,
In time to come, that we had quite forgot
All right and reason, justice, and what not?
As Caesar and his son thus reasoning were,
Cato began to speak, that all might hear
Saying, I will you show, how that all this
Has come to pass, give ear now thus it is.
First unto you it is well known that I
A discreet father had, till destiny
By cruel death me of him did deprive
Who spares none, what ere they be alive.
He well beloved was, of all degrees,
Great rule did bear amongst the noble Peers
Within this City, and much sway did bear
Reproving vice, the wicked did him fear.
Diverse good lectures to me he did preach,
Besides the knowledge of the tongues me teach.
And amongst all, and last of all, he gave
Three precepts unto me, for to observe.
And specially them keep, his will obey
Feeling for to approach his dying day
Lying sore sick in bed, he called me near
To him (as a most loving father dear)
Taking great care of me, his only son,
How I should live, when that his glass were run,
In this uncertain world no time yet past
Me taught as long as life and breath would last)
And wisdom as I looked in favor be
Contentedly to live, most prosperously
For to give ear unto those words that he
Dying should speak in secret unto me,
And circumspectly mark, and to select
Those sentences in writing me had left.
And unto them to have a due respect
And guide my doings as they did direct.
But above all, chiefly he wished me
To keep in memory three precepts, he
Would leave, and always have them in my sight
For to direct me in my paths aright.
Observing them, as workmen do their square
Thereby to rule my life, as is my care.
But being young, I following my mind
With seeking honor (overcome) inclind
Wholly forgot my fathers precepts all
Until I had great troubles me befall.
About urgent affairs, of me sought
Which to my heart a thousand terrors brought.
For then I called to memory that I
Had broken two of them, most wretchedly.
I thereupon determined to prove
The third, which I have done, as me behove
To my great trouble, grief, and jeopardy
To have both lost my goods and life thereby.
The first of the commands or precepts he
Lying upon his death bed, left to me,
Was that I, having a living competent
(As he left me) should therewith be content,
And merry be (giving God thanks therefore)
With that I had, never desiring more.
And having enough, nere to put my self
In danger of others, for this worldly pelf.
Especially in any office high
Under my sovereign Lord and Princes eye,
For fear lest I ambition, of wealth
Should be ore covetous, and get by stealth,
Many bad enemies and evil foes
Which would disdain my honor, and all those
Bring on me false reports, and speeches bad:
I might in danger be, lose all I had,
For oftentimes man takes no regard
Unto the truth, which should have rich reward;
But over hasty are, in giving ear
To false reports, without all heed or care,
As here this day experience does afford
You to behold it in our sovereign Lord,
Which like had fallen on me, so sore and rife,
That I should not have born't, but with loss of life.
If I my fathers precepts had obeyed,
And by his counsel had been ruled and swaid,
I had not to this danger come, and shame,
For to be led, with scandal to my name;
Unto the gallows, or execution place,
A traitor like unto my great disgrace.
The second was, that I should nere prolong
The life of him, who has committed wrong,
Nor such offenders free condemned to dye,
Whose hands are stained with blood or thievery:
For what evil he after did commit
I should be accessory unto it.
Also he nere would do me any good,
But all the harm, wherein he is not withstood;
And that command I also broken have,
Whom my dear father, dying, to me gave,
Which I did fear some evil would me bring
in that I did forget so great a thing,
Which proved true, for the same man whom I
Did from the gallows save, condemned to die,
This day (for fault of a hangman at need)
Came of himself, to hang me with all speed:
And that was the reward from him that I
Should have had given me for my clemency
And pity toward him, that I did show
In time of need, when friends there are but few.
Thus had be been my death and overthrow,
Had fortune me not favored as you know.
The third and last he left me in his life,
It was, that I should prove, whether my wife
Would secret keep small matters as befit,
Before greater to her I did commit;
And namely, such, as life, and lands my own
Should stand in danger to be lost if known:
For where there many are, that faithful be,
And discreet matrons, full of modesty,
That will not only secret keep all things,
But also good and wholesome counsel brings,
In matters of great weight: so likewise there
Are some, can nothing secret keep they hear.
I chanced by fortune, lying in my bed,
troubled with many businesses in my head,
So that I could not take my wonted rest,
For the continual cares, that did molest
My tired senses, touching my office,
At last I saw, that I had done amiss,
And how that now it came into my mind,
Those precepts three my father me assignde
For to observe, I two of them have broke,
As you well know, to my dishonor spoke;
For I have charged my self (the more's the pity)
With the great office of this famous city,
And also have set free at liberty
One from the gallows that deserved to die,
I then determined now in my life
To do the third, which was to prove my wife,
If she could keep my secrets firm and just
In what I did commit unto her trust.
And so upon a night, with loving charms
When I perceived her waking, in my arms
I took her, and began to sigh and mourn
And inwardly within my self to groan,
She thereupon salutes me with a kiss,
Demands to know my grief and heaviness;
Then out of policy, in secret wise
With as much outward show, I could devise
Of hearty sorrow, and as one dismayed
(As she me thought) I trembling to her said
How that I had in furious anger slain
Th'emperors son, for which I do sustain
A thousand fears in my afflicted soul,
And none that hears it, will my grief condole:
For I have slain him in my raging lust
And divellish ire, whom I had in trust
To teach in learning, vices to expel
Who vexing me, this mischief thus befell,
Yea furthermore, I caused his heart be dressed
With costly spices, as in most request,
And in the finest manner did it send
Unto his parents, as I did intend.
At a rich banquet, for a present neat,
And they thereat their own sons heart had eat.
My wife this hearing, was exceeding sad
And much lamented, as if that she had
Bin the sole actor of this bloody deed
Such showring tears from women's eyes proceed:
But I her willed, as she would my life,
And as she was my faithful and true wife,
That she in secret would it keep, and never
To any creature living it declare.
Saying this wicked deed, I did bemone,
Grieving my soul, but remedy was none,
How she in secret kept it, you have seen
or rather how unconstant she has been
As the whole world can witness at this day,
That it almost my life had cost I say
As well it did appear you all did see
Of which I make no wonder, for there be
Some women will no secret keep untold
That which is showed them, but will it unfold;
For naturally they are given to prate and talk
So that at random often their tongues do walk,
Yet there be many sober women eke,
That will not only secrets needful keep,
But also good and wholesome counsel give
Unto their husbands, all the days they live
As in good stories read may we
And partly by experience see.
Then Cato turned himself in humble wise
Unto the Emperor with fixed eyes;
Saying, oh noble and renowned prince
My dear and sovereign Lord, you see from hence,
And all your Nobles how it chanced to me
(Which thing of me cannot forgotten be)
And that by reason I did not obey
My fathers admonitions to this day.
Nor gave no credit to those words that he
Upon his death*bed dying left to me
For my direction, therefore it had bin
My duty to performed his will therein.
For I did ill his precepts to forgit
Who was endued with wisdom and such wit.
When he these words had said in the presence
Of the Empeorour, with due obedience
Before the Lords and commons of the City
Which made them note his inward grief with pity,
Then also he unto the Emprour said,
My sovereign Lord, by whom I have bin swaid
To bear great office, I do here resign
And yield into your hands that which is mine
Discharging here my self, thereof as free
Again, as er'e you gave it unto me.
For from henceforth, if God me so does bliss,
I never will on me take any office.
For which the Emperor, and many more
Were truly sorry, and did much deplore
This thing, for none in the whole city were
So worthy for to rule and office bear.
Yet nevertheless, unto his dying day,
He a great counselor was took away,
The Emperor great kindness him did show
And worthy gifts upon him did bestow.
And love him better after than before,
As his expressions showed a great deal more;
And so remained in favor all his days,
Unto Romes joy, and his eternal praise.
FINIS.
A Postscript.
THis foresaid example gives a good lesson to all honest discreet and wise
women, that they may keep secret all things touching or appertaining to the
estate of their husbands, that they show it to no creature living; for
oftentimes it chances, that in opening of small matters, comes much harm,
and most times, when they think least thereon. A close mouth (as the saying
is) makes a wise head, and a foolish woman is easily known by her much
babbling. In being close and secret, and especially in such things as men would
have kept close and in secret, can come nothing but good and quietness; for a
word is like an arrow in a bow; when the arrow is shot and gone from the bow,
it makes a noise, and cannot return again before it takes his lighting
place: So likewise, a word, when it is spoken, and gone out of the mouth, it
cannot come again before it be dispersed unto the auditors and standers by, and
of them is heard and understood, either in the good or evil part; therefore it
is good to have in memory, and mark well the saying of the wiseman Solomon;
first think a thing twice or thrice before thou speak it, and take good heed
and regard to what end and effect it may turn and come unto before thou
openest thy mouth for where much babbling is, there must needs be offense* she
that refraineth and bridleth her tongue, is wise; an innocent tongue is a noble
treasure, and as one wisely says; silence in a woman is a special virtue. It
is a wonder to see a dumb Grasshopper, because the whole kind of them is
garrulous: yet more wonderful it is to see constancy and silence in women,
because their Sex is mutable and loquacious, the tongue is an unruly member,
especially in a woman's mouth; but where grace is, it is easily bridled: the
tongue is called the gate of life and death, and that in this respect, for by
it the lives of our selves and others are daily hazarded, as you may see in the
story immediately going before. Wherefore I would once again advise all wise
and discreet women, or that would so be thought and accounted, when their
tongues at any time shall be most active, and nimble for discourse, to think
upon Catos* wife, that they reveal not in any wise, any secret, whereby any
mischief may come thereof: for by a word speaking, and that to her near
friend, and to one of her own Sex, which one would have thought would have
kept her counsel, into what great peril had she like to have brought her
husband and her self. Labor then to amend your own imperfections in this one
thing, otherwise the danger and shame in the end will light upon your selves,
as the verse herefollowing does show: Women whose tongues before their wit does
run,
Often speaks too soon, and rues when they have done.
But this is not written only to be marked of women, but also of all persons,
of what estate and degree soever they be, that have any matter of secret or
counsel committed unto them, that they may hereby learn and beware how they
show or declare any thing that they shall hear, see done, or said in any
counsel, for many times, by uttering of a small thing, great inconvenience
does come, and much hinderance to things pretended.

A Cooling*card for a scolding Wife.
WHen wife speaks most, do thou least speech afford,
For silence cuts a shrew worse than a sword,
A froward wife, for very spite will cry,
When thy neglect does scorn her tyranny.
With love and not with fury let her know,
Her errors, for by that amendments grow:
A gentle hand, a Colt does sooner tame,
Than chains or fetters which do make him lame*
QVI MIHI Turned into English meter, for the benefit of young Scholars.
WHen dolts have luck, on honors step to stay:
Let Scholars burn their books, and go to play.
You Children young, that go to school
to you I send my verse,
In English, so you shall not need,
to construe or to pearce.
The child procures his parents ruth,
that is not chastised in his youth.
The Epistle dedicatory.
REader, to whom shall I direct my pen
But unto striplings young, the sons of men?
To you I send my verses in this book,
For you to meditate thereon and look
Where you therein matter of worth shall find
To please your will, and satisfy your mind.
To you alone, and none but you I write,
Others may read, but yours it is of right.
Acc,pt you then my labors and endeavor,
And I shall be obliged to you for ever.
For these my lines are of too mean a strain
To elevate my thoughts or entertain
Higher preferment then with it agrees.
My booke's too barren for tall Cedar trees*
Children may busy here themselves at fits,
Its not for deeper, and more solid wits.
Step then into this Arbor and there walk
Where you may meditate, discourse and talk
At idle times when leisure you shall find,
To ease the lymbes, and recreate the mind.
Learning no burden is to any one,
The sweetest study is when we alone
Keep close unto our books with silent voice
Reading such things as do our hearts rejoice.
Then study you that live in grammar schools
And knowledge get, and be no longer fools.
It is not wealth will make you wise or rich,
A dunce is poor, though he bave nere so mich.
This is the counsel J to you will give
And ever shall so long as I do live.
Were I as able as I could desire
With moveing arguments for to inspire
The inward zeal to learning youth should bear
I would therein spend all my pains and care,
To spur you forward, but alas my skill
Is nothing comparable to my will.
Yet in a word thus much observe from me,
He that this wants, cannot true noble be.
Learning does help to purchase all men's fame,
So truly learnd do more renown their Name.
Some men there be, learning do not desire
But like the swine delights more in the mire.
The blockish idiots learning cannot prise
But hate even those, that are by nature wise,
And sottish fools at learning will repine
So long as puddle shall delight the swine.
Oh then sweet children, mark with heedfull care
What Is for your good, and do no labor spare
To get this precious jem of so great worth
That makes you noble, though but mean by birth.
I Will say no more, bnt only this, farewell,
He is most wise, in learning does excel.
Your faithful and wel-wishing friend, WALTER GOSNOLD.

Qui Mihi in English Verse.
The Schoolmaster precepts does often rehearse
that thou may well learn,
Which to his scholars Lilly writ in verse,
thy manners they concern.
THou child that to be taught desires
and scholar art to me:
Come hither, and mark well in mind.
these things I say to thee.
Betimes in morning leave thy bed
and pleasant sleep off shake:
Go to the Church, and unto God
thy humble prayer make.
But first let hands and face be washed,
comb thou thy head also:
And see thy clothes be neat and clean
before to Church thou go.
Avoiding sloth when school shall call
be present out of hand;
Let no excuse of long delay
procure the lingering stand.
Then me thy master, when thou see
with speech salute anon,
And all thy schoolefellowes likewise
in their degree each one.
And where I do thy seat appoint
there see thou take thy place.
And from thy seat till I thee bid
depart thou in no case:
And as each child does study most
and learning best does get;
He shall in place above the rest
more worthily be set.
Penknife, Quills, Paper, Ink and Books,
as tools most fit for thee:
Let them for use, and studies thine
provided always be.
If any thing I shall indite,
take heed thou write it right:
That in thy writing, blot or fault
may not be found in sight.
No latins unto papers loose,
nor verses do commit;
Which fair to write within your books
for scholars is more fit.
Oft-times repeat things thou had read,
and weigh them well in mind:
If thou doubt, one or other ask,
till that the truth thou find.
He that does doubt, and often ask,
does learning soon conceive;
Who does not doubt, no good he gets,
nor knowledge ever will have.
Good child, I pray you study hard,
no pains to learn refuse;
Lest that thy guilty conscience,
thy slothfulness accuse.
And see that you attentive be,
for what will it avail;
To teach thee ought, if that the same
to print in mind you fail.
Nothing so hard can be to learn,
but labor will it win:
Then take you pains, apply thy book
and study well therein.
For as from earth there do not grow
good corn, flowers, nor seeds;
Nor ought that is good, without tilling,
but fruitless noisome weeds:
So, if a child in studies good,
do not practice his wit;
His time shall utterly mis-pend,
and lose the hope of it.
A law and order in thy speech,
ought for to be attended;
^est by thy over-babling we
be too too much offended.
Be low in voice, so long as thou,
thy studies do apply;
But all the while thou say to me,
pronounce thy words on high.
And whatsoever thou do learn,
when thou say it to me;
Perfect by heart, without thy book
pronounced let them be.
No word let any prompter tell,
to him that is to say:
Which thing does cause unto a boy
no mean or small decay.
If any thing I do command,
see that thou do endeavor,
Both praise and credit for to have
for thy quick witty answer.
No commendation shall thou have
for speech too fast or slow,
To use the virtuous golden mean,
a comely grace does show.
When thou speakst, use thy Latin tongue,
this still remember well:
Shun rude and barbarous words, and then
in eloquence excel.
Besides, see thou thy fellows teach,
when they thee do require:
And all such as unperfect be,
bring on to my desire.
Who so does teach th'unlearned sort,
though most unlearned he,
Yet in short time, then all the rest
more leaned may he be:
But foolish Grammar smatterers
do follow in no case,
Which are to the famous latin tongue
exceeding great disgrace.
Whereof in speech there is not one
so rude, or foolish now,
But him the barbarous multitude,
For author will allow.
If thou desire thy Grammar laws,
most rightly for to know;
And who in speech to understand
best eloquence to show,
See thou the famous writings learn
of old and ancient men;
The which best authors be, and thou
shall know them rightly then.
Terence, Tully, and Virgil too,
now one, now other read:
And mind and mark well what they teach,
and thereto give good heed,
Which Authors he that has not learned
in utter darkness lives;
And nothing fees but foolish dreams
that simple knowledge gives.
Some boys there be whom it delights,
all virtue set apart;
Lewd toys and vices very vain
to practice as an Art.
There be some boys that pleasure take
with hands and feet t'assay,
How that they may their fellows hurt,
or trouble any way.
And some there are that boast themselves
to be most nobly borne:
And others birth do dis-allow,
with speeches full of scorn.
I would thou of such patrons bad,
should take most wary heed,
Lest in the end thou do receive
rewards worthy thy deed.
Do nothing give, nor nothing sell,
nor nothing buy nor change,
To gain by others loss; account
these things to thee most strange.
And most of all, no money use,
inticements unto sin,
That to others leave, virtue seek,
and nothing else to win.
Let noyses, brablings, scoffings, lies,
and every foolish jarre;
Stealing, fighting, gaping, laughing
be always from you far.
Nothing unhonest speak at all,
to cause or stir up strife:
For in the tongue we see is both
the gate of death and life.
Account it most great wickedness,
ill speeches for to give;
Or by Gods mighty name to swear
by whom we only live.
And last of all, keep well thy things,
and books, and be not rude;
And bear them with thee still, and thus
my Precepts I conclude.
Exhorting thee take heed, if thou
desire to live at ease:
That thou do all offenses shun,
and no man do displease.
FINIS.
A Postscript to the READER.
FRiendly READER, I had here thought to have unloaded my memory, presented thee
at this time, with some Anagrams, Epigrams, Emblemes, Epitaphs and carolls; as
also with many Characters and Essaies of my own; but not knowing how well this
work would pass, and considering with my self, I have been but a
metamorphoser of other men's labors, and therefore can no ways challenge any
higher title at the best, then the name of a translator, although indeed, my
pains therein have been no whit less, then if it had been wholly mine: as
old shoos ask more pains many times to mend, then new ones do to make; I
have thought fit to forbear my intended purpose, until some fitter
opportunity does invite me thereto; in the mean while, if thou find any
fault with what is already done, and say it is but cobled over, the reason is
ready at hand* for a translator, though in a more fine phrase, is but a cobbler*
therefore whatsoever a cobbler does, be it never so well, is but cobled. But
howsoever, when I am my craftsmaster, I will promise thee to mend all
imperfections, so it be not, ultra crepidam, till then thou can not expect
any rare workmanship from me. Farewell.

FINIS.
