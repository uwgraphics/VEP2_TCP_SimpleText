An exhortacyon made to Relygyouse systers in the time of their consecracyon
by the Reverend fader in god Johan Alcok bishop of Ely.
I ask the banes betwix the high and most mighty prince king of all kings
sone of almighty god and the virgyne Mary in humanyte Christ Ihesu of Nazareth
of the one party. And. A. B. of the the other party / that if any man or woman
can show any lawful Inpedyment other by any precontracte made or corrupcyon
of body or soul of the said. A. B. that she ought not to be married this day
unto the said mighty prince Ihesu that they would according unto the law
show it.
GOod sister we are here gadred before almighty god and all his saints in
heaven in his church here mylytau^t to solemn this noble spowsage between the
said sone of almighty god and you / which spowsage must be of your party
desired with all your hoole heart and free will / not compelled by none of your
friends / nor for cause of worldly worship nor ease of your body / but oonly
for the love and service ye owe to the said mighty prince / to serve him and
obey him and keep his commandments / and all other men and worldly worship
renounce and forsake and him to love above all thing / and his precepts to
perform and all other thing to do that perteyneth to a good wife. How much
be ye bound unto him that will consent that ye be married unto him so great a
prince and almighty / and ye a wretch his creature and of a poor lynage. For
the common usage is kings to mary togydre. Dukes and Earls togydre / and poor
people togydre / and seldom seen the rich and the poor mary togydre / and
yet this most mighty prince lord of heaven and of earth for the love he bears
unto you to make you his queen / his fader of heaven to be your fader his mother
to be yours. And so by this marriage all your kynred shall be of cosynage by
affynyte to the fader of heaven / our lady all the angels with all the hole
Genelogy of Christ / to which honor and excellence no carnal spowsage could
exalte you. Therefore if ye continue his faithful and true spowse co^myttynge
your mind your will and all your works to observe his co^man^dementes / your
reward shall be as in your Ioynter and dowery excede all rewards that can be
thought and may be given unto man.

First sister if ye will be spowsed to this noble prince and so be determined
in your mind. I say these words to you of the holy ghoost. (Audi filia et
vide and inclina aurem tua^ et obliuiscere populum tuu^ et domu^ patris tui)
That is to say / daughter here see and give humble attendau^ce / if ye will be
spowsed to this mighty prince / ye must forgete and relynquysshe Joy and
felycyte of this world / and the house of all your generacyon / your fader and
mother and all your carnal friends / and ye must follow him in condycyons /
and leave your old name and condycyons and to be called after his name* his
name is Ihesus Nazarenus. And so ye must be called Nazarena. It is written
(Nazarei candidiores niue interpretantur virgulti vel floridi sieve custodientes
aut separati a mundo vel vncti sieve sancti aut consecrati) That is to say. Ye
must be as a young grene branch and as a flower and as a keeper of the
tresour of your husbonde and severed from the world as a noynted holy and
consecrate queen / for these propertees among other has your spowse. First
ye must be as a young grene branch / the which loses his fair beauty when
he is severed from the rote. The rote of all Relygyon is Ihesu of Nazareth that
is charity (Quia deus caritas est) And who so ever is not in charity he
departs himself from almighty god. So ye must love your spowse Ihesu above
all thing / he must be in your mind / in your soul / in your heart / and in
all your works. And of him specially ye must speak / for if ye have any
pleasure for to speak of any other things of the world or of any other man /
then will he be wroth. For as saint Gregory says (Prouidendu^ ergo nobis
est quia intueri non debet quod non licet concupisci. Et johannes) Christ says
(Qui studet eligantes facies inspicere ipse fornacem passionis accendit) For he
will that ye keep oonly and entyerly unto him your five wits / to have no
pleasure for to look upon man or woman / nor to here of no worldely things /
nor speak of no concupyscence / nor handell no contagyous things / but oonly
that shall be to his pleasure and service. For as saint Ierom says. There was
never man so Ielous of his wife and takes head of his works and deeds as our
lord your spowse will take heed of you For ye can think no thought but he
knows it / nor speak no word but he hereth it / nor be in no place but he
is there present / nor no thing can dysceyue him / therefore ye must love
him above all thing and be in parfyte charity with all your systers and his
people and servants. Also Christ Ihesu is called (Flos campi) The flower of
Nazareth / the beauty of this excedeth all other virtues and it is so noble a
tresoure that it can not be praised / and therefore virgynyte is honored in
almighty god. And Christ the heed and the leder thereof and the first thing
that he did in earth when he became man he set up his household of virgyns
and men of chastyte for to serve him and his church here in earth / as he was
by virgyns the angels served in heaven / his mother was and is perpetual
virgyne. Johan Euangelyste his Secretary a virgyne. Johan the Baptyst a
virgyne. Ieremye the prophet a virgyne / and angeles in heaven virgyns and
Innumerable there singing and following the lombe of god the second person /
and ever new songs of Joy and glory. The angels of heaven honors virgyns
as their brethern and systern And as it is written (Apocal.xix) The angel of
god would not suffer saint Johan Euangelyste to worship him / for love he was
a virgyne as he was and angel and man of the earth. And therefore Saint
Bernarde says. What is more full of beauty than is chastyte (Quid castitate
decorius. Que mundum de inmundo conceptum semine de host domesticum de homine
angelum facit) The angels worshypped saint Agnes and cladde her in a garment of
chastyte / crowned saint Cecylye / saint Agas showed her holiness / saint
Katheryne buried / and delivered from death Susanne. And as it is written
Numeri.xxxi. (Omnes feminas virgins reseruare alias omnes iubentur interfici)
That is to say. That where all the people should be destroyed and slain for
sin / yet god almighty commanded to spare virgyns. And therefore says saint
Ancelme (Don est salus nisi quem tu virgo peperisti) Saint Margarete had the
devil under her feet and bound him / and he cried and said / leave ye young
maid ye destroy me. And in like wise Saint Iulyan bette him and put him to
great rebuke / and therefore the devil worshyppeth virgynyte as it is radde in
Thobye the sixte chapter. For right as the devil has power of all unclean
lyuers / right so he honors virgyns and feereth them because of the
angels. And therefore Saint Johan Crysostomus says (Castitas est res angelica
per quam solum singulariter homines angelis assimulantur) And that angels have
in heaven by felycyte. A man or a woman being their in virgynyte have by grace
and by great labor. Virgynyte by grace has diverse preuyleges. First it
replenyssheth paradyse (tricesimasecunda questione prima ca. Nupcie) The
second that virgynyte is a virtue that man oonly may please god with faith (in
aut^. de leuo. F. Scimus colla.iij. the.iij.) It is the beginning of other
virtues (In aut^. quomo^ op. ep^i. F. neque autem sacras. the.iiij.) That oonly
among wymmen a virgyn is to be consecrate.xxv. di. Sicucius. the.v.) Virgyns
martyrs and there other / and has (Aureolam tricesimasecu^da questione quinta.
Si paulus) For as matrymony replenyssheth the earth with childern / right so a
virgyne replenyssheth paradyse (tricesimasecu^da questione.i. Nupcie) Moders of
childern of the world has great besynes and sorrow for to bring forth their
childern / a virgyne is in quietness and brings forth her children in great
Joy as it is written (Mathei.xxij. Que parate erant intrauerunt cum eo ad
nupcias) And as it is written (Canticorum secundo. Sicut lilium inter spinas sic
amicamea inter filias) Virgynyte is lykened unto a lely the leuys of the lely
that conserved the beauty thereof is sobrenesse of mete and drink / the
contrary thereof is showed in Loath being dronken fyled his own daughters
(Genesis decimonono.xv. q. i. Inebriauerunt) Iheronimus (Uirgo binum fugiat pro
veneno) As who says / a virgyne should hate wine as venym.

Custos.
YE must also be a custos / a keeper of all such things as this day shall be
delivered unto you in the name of your spowse and follow hy^ therein. For and ye
keep not all things in their beyuge as he has made them / they should
forthwith be destroyed / and thereof Dauyd says (Nisi dominus custodierit
ciuitatem etc.) So ye must keep the tresour of your spowse Christ perteynynge
to his faith and to have in your remembrance and will to keep the four
things that shall be delyuerd unto you this day / your veyle and your mantyll
both being of blake and a ring with a light of wax berynge in your hand / and
in keeping of these it shall be showed as ye love your husbonde. This veyle and
mantyll remembered right well the virgyne saint Agnes when she said (Posuit
signu^ in faciem mea^ vt nullu^ amatore^ preter cum admittam) That is to say.
He has couerd my soul Inward and mine heed with a veyle / that and if I will
love any man better than him I shall goo to the color of my veyle and that is
everlasting death. In like wise she showed that her spowse Christ Ihu had
Endued her with a garment all set with precious stones / that is to say /
with charity / faith hope / hum^^^^^ / obedyence / abstynence / and prayer /
and Inbroudred a^^ ^hyse f^^^^ virtues in the blake garmente of her body and
soul here knytte togydre / which may every virtuous person daily use and
increase to his reward by grace and free will that be given unto him if he
will seek therefore. And therefore the said sayut Agnes song and said to all
virgynes (Induit me d^s ciclade auro detexta) (Anulus) Also I have by the
auctoryte given unto me by Christ Ihu to deliver unto you this day a ring in
token of marriage Indyssolyble to be made betwix you and him. For as saint Poul
says / ye must herafter remember no thing but that is godly / and therefore
the said saint Agnes cried with a great voice against the devil and him that
tempted her to uncleanly desires saying (Discite a me pabulum mortis. quia ab
ali^^ amatore preuenta sum) And showed unto him and unto all the people with a
merry voice (Anulo suo subornauit me dominus noster ihesus cristus et tanquam
sponsam decorauit me corona) That is to say. All the pleasures and temptacyons
of the world depart from me / for our lord Ihesu Christ with his ring has
wedde me and has crowned me with a crown of everlasting Joy if I keep truly
my love and spowsage unto him.

Lumen.
ALso remember the light that ye bry^ge with you / that sygnefyeth Christ Ihesu
that is (Uera lux que illuminat omnem homine^ venientem in hunc mundum) Whose
faith by his church taught you ye must entyerly keep and se your light go not
out but be brennynge in your soul and in your mind by the blessed Incarnaco^n
/ passion / resurreccyon / and the most blessed life of our savior Christ
Ihesu / and that ye fall in none erthely sin / heresye nor errors by any
man's techynge / nor dyspute not the rules of your relygyon / but with all
reverence and obedyence that ye may do ye take them / obey them / and
observe them. And what so ever your abbess or the rewlers of your relygyon
command you to do / believe it is for the health of your soul and according
to your relygyon / and honor and love them as your fader and mother / ye must
be pacyent among your systers and suffer them / ye must be meke / ye must
ete and drink such metes and drynkes as ye be commanded / and when ye have
not half slept enough ye must rise / ye must sing in your course and order
with your systers / and take no head though your voice be not most swetest and
clear / so ye have a sweet devotion / ye must serve your systers and wesshe
their feet / for Christ Ihesu to whom ye shall be spowsed unto was obedyent to
his fader and suffered death / and wesshed also he god and man the feet of his
dyscyples poor fysshers.

Nazarena.
ALso ye must be Nazarena / that it to say / deseuered from the world / as
Ihesus Nazarenus says himself (Regnu^ meum no^ est in hoc mu^do) But though
your body be here in this world corporally / your mind and your soul to be
with Christ Ihesu / and so take the world in all thing therein and say with
saint Poull. The world is to me a pain / and I to the world / my Joy is
oonly in Christ crucefyed. So sister your pleasure and conuersacyon must oonly
be in the cross of Christ / that is penance / in fasting / prayer / and
mortyfycacyon of your enemy the flesh / and let it not have his will / keep
you within your monasterye and depart not therfro (.xvi. q. i. placuit. n.)
For right as a fysshe deyeth that is without water right so a man or woman of
Relygyon being without their cloister is deed in their souls. Remember the
storye of the bybell that Dena Jacobs daughter she would not keep her within /
not close as she was commanded / but would go forth among young people and
so was corrupt and rauysshed / and thereof followed Infenyte manslaughter and
murdre. Moses being in monte of Relygyon he spoke with god / without he spoke
but with man (.xxxvi. di. c. Si) A woman of Relygyon or a man being in their
cloister in prayer they speak with god / without they speak with the devil /
and therefore an holy fader said / right as an hen yt has eggs leueth her
eggs shall of them never come chekens So shall none be good Relygyous man or
woman that leueth the place of Relygyon. And as it is rad in (Vitis patru^)
There was a monk by long space tempted by the devil and he resysted him sore
/ at the last he brought the monk to the door where he should depart from
the place of Relygyon / he made there a cross and cried to the devil / thou
haste pulled me hyder / pulle me now ferder and thou can but it shall never
lie in thy power.

Uncta.
ALso remember ye be anointed in your Baptyme and confyrmaco^n and now to be
made perfyte Nazarena Crystes wife of Nazareth ye shall be sanctefyed and
consecrate and so your name to be put in the great calendar among the virgyns
and spowses of Christ Ih^u in heaven (Ihesus nazarenus was vnctus oleo leticie
pre oibus partibus suis) And that given unto his manhone to anoynte with virtue
and grace in this present life / and with everlasting Joy his lovers and
servants / and therefore saint John Baptyst says (Nos oe^s recepimus gra^m in
plenitudine eius) No thing we have suffycyent of ourself but all comes of his
grace / and therefore if ye will be anointed with this noble oil of mercy and
grace in this present life and to come to be anointed in everlasting Joy. Ye
must do that was commanded in the gospel by the wise ma^dens yt should be
spowsed unto Christ ^^^^nge (...) et emite oleu^) Go and seek unto ye may bye
and have this oil of grace / and therefore the noble lady said to all her
gentylwy^men as it is written in the book of all songs (In odore vnguentorum
tuorum currimus) That is to say / right as an hou^de yt has found blood or
percynge of a be stryken and seeks and cease not till he find it. So our
savior Christ Ihesu was wounded and lost blood and percyd of his blessed life
in this world / to every man to taste and follow it till he find him. Ye shall
not sister need to seek far till ye fy^de percyd and savor / as Dauyd says
(Sicut cernus ad fontes aquarum) Of this sweet oyntement of Christ for he says
by his prophet Dauyd (Prope e^ dn^s oibus inuocantibus eu^) He is ready to
every body when he is called upon. Example thereof. Mary Magdaleyn she brought
with her oyntement of denocyon and sought him and therefore soon she found
him. So it is your dewte to seek Christ Ihesu to whom ye shall be wedded another
at Nazareth Bedleem nor Iherusalem / but ye shall find him here within your
own church the same god and man Christ Ihesu / and for your very love and
contemplacyon go to an awter within your church / or to anymage of our lady
where Gabryell saluteth her / Remember the mercy and the love yt the fader of
heaven bare to all mankind sent his angel to a young maid / and of her clean
blood of virgynyte god and man was Joined togydre. Then go to an other awter
or place that shows the Natyuyte of Christ and how that he lies in great
pouerte in hay and betwix two beestes and has no comfort but this young
maid his mother to be fed of her breast. And so for to go to other places with
in your church for your deuoco^n of remembrance of his passion. And specially
ones / twyes / or thryes of the day that ye seek him in your mind deuoutely
at the mount of Caluarye. That is that ye shall knele before the crucyfixe
where his image is made remembrynge how he god and man that never had offended
but took man's nature here for the great love and redempcyon thereof and put
unto so paynfull and shameful death in the mids of the world his mother being
present / his hondes and his feet nailed unto the tree / his heart stryken
thorugh / and yet in all this pain his charity was so much that he prayed
unto his fader of heaven to forgive all them that so vyolently and so wrongfully
put him to death / and desired of his fader that all mankind should be forgeuen
of their trespaces / for the offense of our first formed fader Adam and the
gates of heaven to be opened to all them that would believe in him. And in like
wise to remember some devout place of his Resurreccyon and blessed Ascensyon /
and how he shall come to make an end of this present world and deem it. (Per
igne^) And call you and all mankind to account of their demea^^^ concerning
his faith / and of you how ye have kep^e your spowsage and promise made unto
him. And if ye sister well and Justly and truly observe your name that ye shall
be called by after your husbonde / as Nazarena / that is to say (virgulti)
fair branches full of fruytes of virtue in your Relygyon and flowers of
virgynyte and keeper of commandments of your spowse / despysynge pleasures
and pomp of the world / leuynge it unto ye folysshe maidens of the world /
and anoynte your soul by holy living and so be (Sancta) as Christ is
(Sauctus) and consecrate your soul to almighty god / saying unto hy^ with the
holy maid and martyr saint Agnes and saint Awdry (Nichil in terris desydero
preter te) I desire nothing in this present life but the Ihesu to be my keeper
and defender / and to have the pryncypally in my mind and thought / and than
doubt ye no thing systers / but it shall be said unto you and euerychone of
you. (Unguentu^ effusu^ nomen tuu^ ideo adolescentile dilexerunt te nimis) The
angels of heaven being these fair young maidens and gentylwy^men. For ye bear
the name of Nazareth that is their maker and lord will make Infenyte myrthe
and defend and keep your person and not depart from till they sing this
song most blessed that may be said unto you (Ueni sponsa xp^i accipe corona^
qua^ tibi p^paranit in eternu^) That is to say come maid Nazarene Crystis
spowse to present and receive for thy reward the special crown of glory
called (Auriola) that I will not give nor reward with / but my special lovers
martyrs virgyns and prechers / and that ye may so do here yt ye may receive
this noble crown I beseech almighty god for his great mercy Amen.

consecracyon
