A RELATION BY WAY OF IOVRNALL, etc.
THE seventh of April being Thursday, 1636. His Excellency departed from
Greenwich for Germany, took Barge about three of the clock in the morning,
and landed at Gravesend, from thence by Coach to Canterbury to bed, the next
day to Margate where we dined, and about three of the clock in the
afternoon, he took shipping in one of the Kings Ships called the Happy
Entrance, and landed the tenth day being Sunday at Helver-sluce, and from
thence to the Brill, there sailing over a lake into Masanssluce, and so on by
wagons to Delph, and to the Hage: Hage.
but a mile before we came thither, there met us some of the Queen of
Bohemia's Coaches, which her Majesty sent for his Excellency, and in one of
them his Excellency went to her Majesty that night, the time we staid there,
was spent in visits between the Prince of Orange, his Excellency and the
States, with some other Ambassadors, that were then there, as the French,
Venetian, and the Swedish, here we staid three days, and departed the
fourteenth day by wagons, passing through Leiden to Woerden, and then entered
the Bishopric of Utrecht, Utrecht.
and so to the City it self where we lay, the Princes being there at school,
his Excellency went to see them that night, the next day thence to Rhenem to
dine, where the Queen has an house adjacent to the Rhine, on the left side,
which we viewed, having fair rooms and gardens belonging to it, after diner,
we entered into Gelder-land, so through Wagening to Arnheim to bed, passing
that afternoon through much danger, by reason of Out-lyers from the Army at
Schenckenschans, which was not far off, the Prince of Brandeburgh being here
in Town, visited his Excellency the next day, and the day after his Excellency
visited him, who was showed by him, the ashes of some Romans preserved in
pots, that were found in a Mountain called Zanten, which we afterward passed
by, here we lay Easter Day and the Monday following, and did see the smoke
and fire out of the great Pieces from the Sconee, as they were in skirmish,
thither his Excellency sent the Steward and a Trumpeter to demand passage of
the Spanyard in the Schans, and Grave William for the Hollander, but the
Spaniard would not grant it, without order from Brussels, Grave William hearing
their answer, sent his Excellency word, he made no doubt, but to give him free
passage the next day, for he resolved to make an assault that night upon the
Sconce, upon the assault, the Spaniards yielded it up on conditions, and here
his Excellency published certain orders, to be generally observed amongst us,
one reason was, the sickness, being here very much, we staid here three
days and departed the nineteenth in wagons for the Schans, first crossed over
the Rhine just by the town on to the right side into Cleveland, and so to the
Tolhouse, a Castle where the Hollanders take toll at, adjoining to the Rhine on
the same side, then passing through all their works and Army, leaving the
Schans at a distance which was miserably battered, until we came to Grave
William his Tent, Schen^^shants.
where some of the Spaniards were sealing of their agreements what quarter they
should have, who instantly left them, to bring his Excellency over the Rhine on
a Bridge of flat bottomed Boats, guarded with all his Troops of Horse, until
we came at the Bark wherein his Excellency lay that night, then returned and
sent a Company of English Soldiers to guard it, the next day early we
weighed Anchor and sailed up the Rhine, having a Guard of Soldiers along the
shore, by reason the Enemy went out of the Schans that morning, so passing by
Emmerick and Rees, Towns with strong sconces adjoining to the Rhine on the
left side, then in sight of the Mountain Zanten on the other side, so by
Burick, Wesell.
on the same side, to Wesell a Town on the left side of the Rhine, against
which we cast Anchor, and lay on shipboard all night, for they died there of
the sickness more than thirty a day, nevertheless the next morning we took
wagons in number eighteen and displaied our English colors in three several
wagons, passing over a little River in Boats called Lipp, then by Rheinbergh on
the right hand being the last Town of the States, then by Dinslacken, on the
same side to Dinsburgh to dinner, where none of our carriage might enter in,
for as his Excellency entered the gate, one of the watch discharged his piece
near unto the horses breast, the rest being instantly commanded to the
contrary, but the Gates were shut up, and we kept out, until the Town were
satisfied, we were no Enemy, our carriage and Company being great, frightened
them at the first after diner we past through a long Wood in much danger, and
in the view of Rogues, who did not set upon us because our Company was great,
yet we fearing the worst, had sent for a Convoy of Musketeers to the next Town
before, who met us not until we were out of the Wood.

Then we entered into Bergish-land, and went by Keiserswert to Dusseldorp to
bed, Dusseldorp.
which adjoynes to the Rhine on the left side, where the Duke of Neiuburgh lay,
who was with his Duchess abroad taking the air, but espying us coming,
returned back into the Town with speed, and sent to have the Ports shut up,
thinking we had been some Enemy, but hearing it was his Excellency was very
joyful, and sent Coaches for him, to come and suppe with him, and to make his
house his lodging the time he staid, but the next morning after breake-fast,
perceiving his Excellency would go away, had three Coaches waiting at the
door, into one he put his Excellency, and us into the rest, and brought us
out of Town, with a Company of Horsemen and Foot in Arms, and a Troop of
Lances going before, and Trumpets sounding about the Coach, his own Guard;
being thus brought without the Gates, he took his leave of his Excellency and
returned, and as we were departing, there went off great pieces of Ordnance.

Thence near Neusse, and then crossed over the Rhine at a little Dorpe called
Hittorpe, into the Territory of Collein, Collen
and then to the City where we lay. It is seated on the right side of the
Rhine, where the Bishop of Mentz was, who sent one of his Privy Counsel to
invite his Excellency the next day to diner, he then sent three of his Coaches
for us, and gave his Excellency very noble entertainment; the first night his
Excellency came, were presented unto him twenty four Flaggons of several
kinds of Wine, the next day twenty eight, and at every Present, there was a
long speech made to his Excellency in Latin by one that came with the Wine,
which came all from the Magistrates of the City in Flaggons with the City Arms
on them, the Jesuits there have built them a very stately Church and richly
adorned it with gildings and erected an Altar one of the state lie, I ever
saw, in the City likewise there is a great Church called the Dome, wherein lie
the Bodies of three Kings, called The three Kings of Collein, which went to
worship our Savior, then is there another Church called Saint Ursulas, in
which lies the bones of 1100. Virgins in places locked up, and Saint Ursula in
a fair Tomb by them, which came all thither with her for their Devotion,
there is besides a Nunnery and some English Nuns there.

Here we staid a week, and the twenty eighth day we took a Boat drawn
with nine horses and went up the Rhine, by many Villages pillaged and shot
down, and many brave Vineyards on Mountains, along the Rivers side, passing
by Bonn on the right side, and seven high Burghens with old Castles on them,
seated on the other side of the River, and to Drachenfels Castle on the left of
the Rhine, against which we cast Anchor and lay that night on shipboard, the
next morning early weighed Anchor, passi^^ (...) an Island in which is a
Monastery of Nuns called ^onenwerther, so on by Hammerstein Castle by
Keigrmagen Andernach and Ormus three Towns on the right side of the Rhine,
against Ormus we cast Anchor and lay on shipboard.

The next day early weighed Anchor and went by Engers on the left side, and
there begun Trierischlandt, and so to Coblentz a Town adjoining to the Rhine
on the right side, Coblentz.
which the French lately lost, being driven out by the Emperors Forces into a
Castle seated on a very high Rock, opposite to the Town called Hermanstein,
which commands the Town, who were then skirmishing when we came, wherefore
we cast Anchor about half an English mile before, and sent a Trumpeter
desiring passage, which they willingly granted, ceasing their fight on both
sides, the General in the Town making preparation to entertain his
Excellency, did but open the Gate, thinking to clear the passage for his
Excellencies entrance, presently they in the Castle let fly a Cannon and were
like to have slain some of them, wherefore they withdrew from showing of
themselves, until his Excellency came against the Gate, and then came forth
and entreated his Excellency to dine with him, but he staid not having a long
way to go that night; they in the Castle are besieged on every side, before
them are Cannons placed just by the Rivers side, behind them are a great
company of Horsemen called Crabbats, beyond them in a plain great field, are
other Horsemen and Footmen, and likewise in Islands in the Rhine, all watching
that they cannot be relieved, they in the Town, if they do but look out of
their windows, have a bullet presently presented at their heads, yet the Town
is somewhat the stronger for a River called the Mosell, which runs along one
side of the Town into the Rhine, over which there did stand a fair Bridge,
though part of it now be beaten down, that there is no passage over, but have
made a little lower on the Mossell a passage on Boats, to relieve the Town,
under the Castle there is a very beautiful house, which the Emperor gave to
the Elector of Tryer, and he resigned it to the French, whereupon the Spaniard
besieged him, when he lay in a fair Castle on the Mossell called Tryer, and
took him prisoner, and is prisoner now: as we were departing from hence, the
French gave us a brave vollie of shot as has been heard, with four or five
pieces of Ordnance, from hence up the Rhine, by Lonstein and Branbach two
Towns on the left side, and Capelle a Castle on a Rock on the other side, to
Boppart a Town on the same side, against which we cast Anchor and lay aboard.

The first of May being Sunday, and their Whit-sunday, we departed, passing by
Villages shot down, and by many pictures of our Savior and the Virgin Mary,
set up at the turnings of the water, until we entered the Land of Hesse, where
we still viewed pleasant Vines on the Mountains, so by Saint Goware, and by
Rhinefilds Castle both on the right side, to Catzenelbogon Castle on the other
side, then by Oberwesell on the right side; then begins the Lower Palatinate,
so by Caub on the left side, which is the first Town in the Pfaltz, and so to
Pfaltz Castle, seated in a little Island in the River, Bacharach.
from hence to Bacharach, a Town where we landed, it is seated on the right
side of the Rhine, having a Castle on a high Rock within the walls, and under
that a Church, which is from the plain ground 100. steps before one can come
into it, here the poor people are found dead with grass in their mouths:
from hence by a Village on the same side, in which none but Leapers are, being
not far off the Town, and so to Hambach on the same side, by Drechshausen on
the other side, to Armanshausen, a Town on the left side of the Rhine, against
which we cast Anchor and lay on Shipboard.

The next morning departed hence, and then begun Momtzistzland, so by a little
Tower in the water, called Mouse Thour, which one Otto a Bishop of Mentz,
having lived not well, being much troubled with Mice, built this, and lived in
it, thinking there to be secure, but even thither they pursued him also, and
eat him up: then by Bingen, a fair Town on the right side, and by Ehrenfels
Castle on the other side to Rudeshein, a Town on the left side of the Rhine,
into which I entered, and did see poor people praying where dead bones were in
a little old house, and here his Excellency gave some relief to the poor
which were almost starved as it appeared by the violence they used to get it
from one another: from hence by Geisenhem, Elfeld, and Wallaff, three Towns on
the left side of the River, and then we crossed over the Rhine, unto the other
side.

Then to Mentz a great City seated close by the Rhine on the right side against
which we cast Anchor and lay on shipboard, Mentz*
for there was nothing in the Town to relieve us, since it was taken by the
King of Sweden, and miserably battered, there the King of Bohemia dyed, in a
fair corner house toward the Rivers side, here likewise the poor people
were almost starved, and those that could relieve others before, now humbly
begged to be relieved, and after supper all had relief, sent from the Ship
ashore, at the sight of which they strove so violently, that some of them fell
into the Rhine and were like to have bin drowned.

The next day being the third of May, from hence we departed, leaving the
Rhine half a league above the City on our right hand, and entered into a
shallow River called the Maine, passing by a place which the King of Sweden was
building for a Fort, but could not finish it, then by Cassell, on the left
side, thence by Flersheim on the left side to Russelsheim on the right of the
Maine, Francfurt.
and then to the stately City of Francfurt, adjacent to the Maine on the left
side, where we landed and lay: from Collein hither, all the Towns, Villages,
and Castles be battered, pillaged or burnt, and every place we lay at on the
Rhine on shipboard, we watched, taking every man his turn; here we staid
four days, until our carriages were made ready: where we saw the place
wherein they keep the Diet, afterward entered into the Church called Saint
Bartholmews, where the Emperors use to be crowned and take their oath; the
City is inhabited with Lutherans and Jews, for in the Jews Synagogue, I
entered in to see the manner of their service, which is an undecent way, making
a hideous noise, having on their heads and about their necks things called
Capouchins, the women are not admitted into their Synagogue, but in places
about. And on Sunday the seventh of May, by wagons through the City over two
Bridges which are always guarded with Soldiers, leaving the Maine on our left
hand, from hence we took a Convoy of Musketeers along, being we went through
much danger, by Offenbach, Selgenstat, seated between us and the Maine,
passing thus along through a great Forest in much danger, hearing the great
Pieces so swiftly discharge off at Hannaw, which the Swedes subdued, and now
besieged by the Emperors Forces, being not above three English miles off, then
by a very great Mountain two English miles long, all beset with Vines, until
we came at a poor little Village where we staid and dined with provision of
our own, and after dinner departed, passing through Plains until we came at
the Maine, and there ferried over into a town called Klingenberg, passing
through this, we came to a very high hill the way up being all stone and 2.
English miles up to the top, and then through a Wood, after we were past this,
we came to a poor little Village called Neunkirchen, Neunkirchen.
where we found one house a burning when we came and not any body in the
Village, here we were constrained to tarry all night, for it grew very late,
and no Town near by 4. English miles, spending the night in walking up and
down in fear, with Carrabines in our hands, because we heard Pieces
discharged off in Woods about us, and with part of the coals of the consumed
house his Excellency had his meat roasted for supper, the next morning early,
his Excellency went to view the Church, which we found rifled with the pictures
and Altars abused, in the Churchyard, we saw a dead body scraped out of the
grave, in another place out of the Churchyard, there lay another dead body,
into many of the houses we entered, and found them all empty. From this
miserable place we departed, and heard after, that they in the Village fled by
reason of the sickness, and set that house on fire at their departure, that
Passengers might not be infected.

Then came we into Wijrtzburg-land, and descended down another steep hill and
there crossed over a little River called Tauber, and through Keichelsheim, to
Neubruim a poor Village where we dined, after dinner passing by the side of
the Maine, and through Woods and Plains, Wurtzburg
until we came to Wijrtzburg, a fair City passing over a bridge first,
standing over the Maine into the Town, seated on the left side of the River,
and a fair Castle opposite to the Town on the other side, in which the Town
put all their riches when they heard the king of Sweden was coming, thinking
there it would not be gained, but they hearing of it, surprised and pillaged it
in 3. days, and it was 3. or 4. months before the Emperors forces could
regaine it, the next day early departed, being the 10. of May, and entered
Marggrafen-land, and to Kiteingen to diner, after diner, thence through Ipza a
City, Marckbibrach
and so to Marckbibrach, where we lay all night on the plancher, for the
Village was pillaged but the day before, early the next morning we went away
and passed through Neustadt, which has been a fair City, though now pillaged
and burnt miserably, here we saw poor children sitting at their doors almost
strav'd to death, to whom his Excellency gave order for to relieve them with
meat and money to their Parents, from hence we went to Eilfkirchen a poor
Village where we dined, with some reserved meat of our own, for there was not
any thing to be found, after diner, thence we passed by many Villages pillaged
and burnt down, and so into Nurnberger-land, passing through the place where
the King of Swedens Leaguer lay, when the King of Bohemia was with him and my
Lord Craven, and in sight of the place the Emperors Army had entrenched
themselves by the side of a great wood, here the King of Sweden set upon poles
alive three of his soldiers, for killing 2. of their Commanders, and flying
presently to his Enemy, and at the end of a Battle that was then fought, he
took them prisoners, and so executed them, then drawing near Nurnburg a great
City seated in a Plain, Noremberg.
which the King of Sweden relieved at that time against the Emperor, being not
above two English miles off, here we passed by some of their works before the
Town, and then entered the Gate into the City being very stately built, and
one of the strongest in Germany, and so to his Excellencies lodging, the next
day the Lords of the City came and visited his Excellency; here we staid II
days until his Excellency had word for certain where the Emperor was, the
most part of our time was spent in seeing of the rare things in the Town, as a
very brave Magazine wherein all their munition lies, which the Governors of
the town showed his Excellency, at our first entrance we passed through a
large Court where there lay on our left hand 4. great Cannons by the walls
side, which were 6. paces long, and 2. foot broad, and worke-houses there
likewise, then entered we into a long room where there hung on both sides
armor for foot and horse, and then into the place it self, where there were
6. partitions each 28. paces long and 6. broad, all full of brass Pieces and
other small ones of several rare inventions, from hence we went to see a very
rare water-worke which supplieth all the City, adjoining close to the wall of
the Town, returning homewards, we entered into their great Church called the
Dome, there his Excellency was showed a very stately picture of the
Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, which hung in the middle of the Quire, drawn
up, which had not bin showed to any in 18. years before, and then returned
home, and the Lords with him, who supped with his Excellency, the next day they
dined with him likewise, and after diner desired his Excellency to go and take
the air in some of their Gardens without the City, which he did: the City is
very strong being encompassed without the walls with bulwarks and a mighty
deep and wide ditch, and within are many curiosities and stately buildings:
the ancient men (called Lords) govern by turns, not acknowledging any
particular Prince their Sovereign, but hold correspondency with all, for in
the time of those great wars between the Emperor and the King of Sweden, they
would resign to the Emperor one while, and to the K. another, paying great
taxes and impositions to their half undoing. From hence we departed May 22.
being Sunday, for Regenspurgh, thinking there to meet with the Emperor, first
p^ssing through a part of the upper Palatinate to Newmark, Newmark.
where we lay, seated in a plain where the king of Bohemia had a house, which
his Excellency viewed, adjoining to the wall within the Town, fortified with
bulwarks and pallizadoes, having spacious rooms and a fair Armory: early the
next morning, from hence, by Churches demolished to the ground, and through
Woods in danger, understanding that Crabbats were lying here about, until we
came at a poor little Village called Hemmaw where we stayed and dined, which
has been pillaged eight and twenty times in two years, and twice in one day,
and they have there no water but that which they save when it raineth: after
dinner, to Ettershansen a poor Village where we crossed over a little River in
Boats, the Bridge being burnt down by the Swedes forces; from hence we
ascended up a high hill, being descended down, we passed a long on an high
bank, having the River Danubius on our right hand, and high Mountains with
Vines on our left, passing thus through several Villages beaten down or
burnt, until we came at a round Fort before the Bridge which a guard kept, and
so over it through a Tower in the middle standing over the Danuby, which
runs with as swift a current as at London Bridge, dividing it self into
several Islands which have had howses on them, but now burnt, and also houses
on the Arches which were demolished likewise, Regenspurg.
then into the City Regenspurg to his Excellencies lodging, the City has bin
taken by the Swedish forces, and regained by the King of Hungary.

The 25. day his Excellency went to take the air on the other side of the
Town, and as we went did see the ruins of many houses and Churches, and one
Carthusian Monastery not so much ruinated as the rest, into which his
Excellency entered to see the rooms wherein the King of Hungary did lie all
the time he was regaining of the City, being not above two English miles off
it, and here likewise the old Duke of Bavaria, this Dukes Father lived in a
Cell for many years together, again his Excellency went to take the air the
28. day, and entered into a Jesuits Monastery, in which there is one Altar
dedicated to S. George; here his Excellency stayed a week, and departed thence
for Liniz, where the Emperor was, taking four Boats and went down the Danow
thorough Bavaria, passing by a Castle called Donastauff, seated on a high
Mountain, with a Dorpe at the foot of it, adjoining to the Danubij on the
left side, and by Werth Castle on the same side, Straubingen
to Straubingen on the same side where we landed about eleven at night and lay
that night; the next morning from thence, still by many ruins to Pogen on the
right side, at the foot of a very high Mountain, and on the top of it a
Church with a few houses about it; then by Nuternberg Castle seated on a high
Mountain on the right side of the River, and by Deckendorff on the other side,
against which we met with thirty horses fastened all to one rope drawing of
six great boats which were going to Regenspurg, then by a Castle called
Tawrin^ seated on a high Mountain, and below at the bottom is a Town walled
round, called Overwinter on the left side, Vilshoven.
and so to Vilshoven, a town on the right of the Danuby where we landed and
lay that night. The next morning as his Excellency was taking Boat, he spied a
poor Boy standing among other poor people begging for relief, who looked
very strangely and could neither speak nor hear, but a little at his mouth
and nose, having neither ears nor passage to hear with, and his face very
thin and drawn aside, yet when one hallowed he heard and answered again with
a noise, there was with him his sister, a pretty girl, who when one spoke to
him, made him understand by signs, these two his Excellency took along with
him in his Boat to a City called Passaw seated on the right side of the
Danuby, where we landed and lay, and there common ded to have new clothes made
for them and gave them money and sent them home to their friends, and a little
before we came thither, ends Bavaria; this City is seated very sweetly,
having 3. rivers running near it, the Danuby which is of a green color,
incompasseth it of one side, and a swift river called Inn, on the other side,
which comes out of Italy, and is of a white color, the third is Ilze, which
is very black, and comes out of Bohemia, and both run into the Danuby at
the end of the town, the next day his Excellency went to view a Capuchine
Monastery, seated very pleasantly on a high hill, near unto the Town, first
we passed over a bridge made of little rafts which stands over the river Inn,
and so through Instadt, and then ascended up the hill upon which the Monastery
stands, and then entered into the Chapel called our Ladies Chapel, being
built in the year 1636. where we saw a neat Altar, and a picture of the Virgin
Mary's set up in the Altar, and many fine relics, left there of those that
are said to have been healed of several diseases, coming but thither to do
their Devotion, and returned thence sound, from hence we descended to another
Chapel at the bottom of the hill, passing down 274. steps, being set in
order, 10. and 11. together. and as much plain ground as contains the steps
through out the whole descent, and in the middle of the descent is a Crucifix,
at which one daily sits to receive the alms of charitable people, which
Crucifix one rude person passing by, struck it, and fell down dead and never
revived, as these Capuchines related, and then returned. And opposite to the
city on the other side of the Danuby on a very high rock, is seated a strong
Castle which cannot be scaled, called Festingoverhouse, commanding all the
Towns and Monasteries; at the foot of this is another strong built Fort, by
which the river Ilze falls into the Danuby, between the town Ilze and this:
the city is governed by Leopoldus the Emperors second son, who is Bishop of
it; here we stayed three days, and departed the fourth of June, and entered
into upper Austria, passing by Schaumberg castle on the left side of the river,
and by Effertingen on the other side, and Wilhering Monastery on the same side,
Lintz.
to Lintz where the Emperor was, who sent to receive his Excellence at his
landing the Count of Harrack, Marshall of the Court, with some other Courtiers;
after his gratulation with his Excellence, there came ten or twelve coaches,
which waited on his Excellence to his lodging which the Emperor had provided,
and then returned. Presently after came the Count Megaw, high Steward to the
Emperor, to visit his Excellence; and the next day Count Mansfelt Captain of
the Foot-Guard to visit his Excellence, and after him Father Lemmarman, his
Majesty's Confessor.

The sixth of June, being the second day after we came, his Excellence had
audience of the Emperor and Empress, who sent their coaches for us; being
come to his palace, which is seated on a hill, we went up four ascents of
stairs, the Guard standing on each side of us, with halberds and carrabines in
their hands, passing thus through rooms, until we came at the door of the
chamber in which the Emperor was, and when his Excellence came at the door,
out came the little Count of Kezell, high Chamberlain to his Majesty, and
brought in his Excellence, and then withdrew and shut the door after him, that
none might enter in: after his Excellence had been within a while, we were all
admitted, and kissed his Majesty's hand, and then withdrew, and passed through
other rooms and a gallerie, where the Guard stood in like manner, to the
Empresses chamber, where none might enter neither, stealing a sight of her as
we stood, and then returned.

The eighth day his Excellence had his second audience of the Emperor, as
private as the first: and the tenth day audience again of the Empress, and
then we were admitted to kiss her hand: the same day there were seven men
beheaded which were Rebels, for rising up in arms with four hundred other
Boores against the Emperor: the first that was executed, was said to be one
that had enchanted himself, that no bullet could hurt him, and the only
seducer of the others: after he was upon the scaffold and his face covered, two
men held him fast to the block, then came the Executioner with a red hot pair
of pincers, and violently clapped hold of both his breasts, that done, nailed his
right hand fast to the block, and chopped it off, then presently whipped out his
sword from his side, and cut off his head, one of the hangmen presently took
it up, and cried at the ears of the head, Jesus, Jesus; then the Jesuit which
came a long with him admonishing of him, desired every one to join in prayers
with him for him; then came the other, and a Boy which was beheaded likewise,
all making their private confessions to Priests, at the foot of the scaffold,
having a Crucifix in their hand, kissing their hands and feet at the end of
every prayer: After all those men were beheaded, and quartered, there went two
of their confederates a foot to be hanged about an English mile off, to a
place where a Priest of theirs hung upon a pole, and his head on the top, which
was taken in a Church a year before called Ering, which we afterward passed by.

The twelfth day being Sunday, the Emperor, Empress, and the Arch-Dutchesse,
dined at the Jesuits College; but before, they heard Mass in their Church,
and after dinner a play was presented to them by the house, and some young
scholars, consisting of many varieties. The fifteenth day his Excellency
dined at the Count Megaws, and was nobly entertained: the sixteenth day as we
were at dinner, there came a mighty clap of thunder and lightning, which burnt
down three houses presently, being not above an English mile off, on the other
side of the water, and such accidents happen here often, by reason all their
houses be covered with thin board, in the manner of tile; and about four of
the clock in the afternoon, his Excellence had audience the third time, and
we all invited to a Balto, by the Empresses command, to the Count Slavataes,
who is Chancellor of Prague, where all the Ladies assembled, and there spent
the time in dancing: in Moravia not far from this place, there was a Baron
whose name was Rabell, having a wife, which couple had been married forty
years together, and had many children, and when he was eighty two years old,
and his wife seventie five, she conceived and brought him forth two children at
a birth, a son and a daughter, which children lived a year and died, and
then presently after their parents both died, and was buried in S. Michaels
Church, a Church of the Dominicans in Brune, a town in Moravia: this story
was related to us by a Priest of the Empresses for certain; here his
Excellence stayed nineteen days, and all the time at the Emperors charge,
and served by his Majesty's servants, in as much state as he himself; at the
first course the Drums beat up, and at the second, music with voices.

From hence we took boat for Vienna, the three and twentieth day of June,
passing down the swift river Danuby, near the Church called Ering, wherein
the Boores assembled and chose that Priest, who was taken and executed as
aforementioned, so by a fair castle called Spiulbarke, where the Duke of
Bavaria makes his Toll-place seated on the left side of the river, then by
Markhawsen on the same side, by Walzig a fair castle seated on the other side
on a high hill, and the town at the foot a little beyond, so by another fair
castle called Crayne, seated on a high rock close by the Danuby, on the left
side, the town at the foot of it, both belonging to the Count Megaw: then
through a place in the water called the Struddell, where it runs very swift,
with a great fall amongst the rocks, and dangerous to pass, having no more
space than the breadth of a boat, which if it touches, breaks into many
pieces, and over this place on a high rock is a Cross set up, having past
this danger, just by on the left side of the River is an old Chapel called S.
Nicolas, out of which came two men with his picture in a box, to receive an
accustomed reward due from those which pass by safe: from hence by a fair
castle called Besinboe, seated on the same side on a rock, and by Pekelem on
the same side, then by Wednick castle seated on a rock on the left side, with
a village beneath it, so by a castle and monastery encircled with a wall,
seated on a very high rock called Milk, and the town at the foot of the
rock along by the Danuby on the right side, part of it burnt by an accident
when the King of Hungary was in it, and by Sable castle on a high rock on the
same side, with a fair banqueting house, which belongs to the Grave
Sturbutz; and a little further on the same side, is another banqueting house,
called the Devils banqueting house, by reason of many apparitions there seen.
Then to a little poor Dorp called Aspagh on the left side of the Danuby,
Aspagh.
where we went a shore and lay that night.

Early the next morning, being the four and twentieth day, we went up the
river by a castle called the Spitz, seated on the same side, so by
Stiringsteine, a fair town on a rock adjoining to the river on the same
side, with a ruinated castle over the town on a hill, with rocks on both
sides, which are the Grave Van Seldingz: then by another fair town seated on
the same side called Stine, from which there stands a bridge over the Danuby
made of rafts, having thirty seven arches, under which we passed, and at the
end of it, opposite to the town is a monastery with many fair houses
belonging to it, and behind this is another stately built monastery, called
Kitne, seated on a hill: from this an English mile distance, with a delightful
prospect, just by are two other fair towns, the one Crempz, and the other
Winsell, seated both on the left side of the Danuby in a plain, which three
towns are within the compass of an English mile; then by Tolnie a town on
the other side, which is the oldest town in all the Empire, against which we
lay a while and dined on ship-boord: after dinner we entered into lower
Austria, and went by an old castle called Griffopsteine, seated on a rock on
the same side, in which all Priests that offend are imprisoned and tried.

Then a Dutch mile further, on the left side, the Danubius runs out to a
fair Town called Cornybrough, seated an English mile off in a Plain with
fair Monasteries therein, then on the other side of the river is
Cloysternybrough, full of Cloisters and Monasteries; so by Nustorffe on the
same side, from whence we discovered Vienna, seated in a Plain, then left the
Danu, which divides its self into sever all branches and meet beyond the
Town, and runs through Hungary into the black Sea, and went up in an arm of
it to the City, where we landed, seated on the right side of the Danu, which
is very well fortified round the walls, besides a complete Regiment of 1500 men
always ready in arms, part watching at every gate, some about the Emperors
palace, others about the place where the Jews keep their shops in the City,
for they are not suffered to lie in the Town a night, but constrained to keep
within a place on the other side of the River opposite to the City, which they
have built, and is called the Jews Burg; for if any one be found all night in
the Town, he is miserably punished, if not put to death: there are likewise
7000 Burgers in the city, which are to be in arms at an hours warning.

The next day being Sunday, his Excellence had audience of the Queen of
Hungary and the Archduke Leopoldus, the Emperors second son, being the 26.
day, and nothing we saw note-worthy at his palace, but a spacious Courtyard:
the next day again his Excellence went to see the Dukes lodging, where we saw
only a few pictures; from hence he went to several houses of the Jesuits,
the first was a University, where was presented to his Excellence a kind of
Comedy by young Scholars in masking attire, and one of the house playing on an
instrument like a Virginal, several kinds of music; after that, a banquet
brought in by the Actors: this ended, we went to the second house called the
Probation-house, where none but young men are, about fifty in number, there to
be tried whether they may be made capable of holy orders: thence to the third
house, called the Profest-house, where none but the ancient Fathers are, where
as soon as his Excellence entered, an oration was made to him by one of the
chief, and after viewed the house and Church, in which there was an hymn sung
by their best singers, with very sweet music, and they have an organ of five
thousand pipes. From hence we returned home to our lodging, where there came
presently after the Prince of Ducardins to visit his Excellence.

The eight and twentieth day his Excellence went to see a garden of the
Emperors about a Dutch mile off, called Nigobath, upon which place the Turk
once entrenched himself, when he would have taken Vienna, and was then two
hundred thousand men strong, in the Emperor Rodolphus his time, and after they
were driven out of the country, the Emperor built this on their works for a
memorial, the garden is almost foure-square, encircled with a strong stone
wall, and at every corner a fair Tower, and in the middle two, with three
partitions in every one, and the tops covered with brass, round within the
wall is a walk for two to go a breast, covered with brass, and underset
thick with pillars of stone: then returned we to another very stately large
garden of the Empresses near unto the city, called her Favorita, having
several small gardens adjoining to it and a fair house: the next day his
Excellence went to see the Queen again, and the two Princes her Son and
Daughter here we staid a week, and departed the first of July by wagons for
Prague, passing first over three long bridges handing over several branches of
the Danubius: so by the walls of Cornyburgh the town aforementioned, to Stackay
a poor village where we dined, after dinner by Kildersdorf to Holebrum a
poor village, Holebrum.
where we lay all night on the straw, having traveled seven Dutch miles, and
every Dutch mile is four English, where six and twenty houses were burnt that
day fortnight we came, by thunder and lightning, the next day early from hence
passing through plains and corne-fields which were a reaping, we came to
Kudordorp, where Moravia begins in a great plain, where two stones are set in
the ground, dividing Lower Austria and Moravia, then past we through Colendorp
the first town in Moravia, and by a Cross standing in a plain not near any
town, with many graves about it, Swamb
then to Swamb a pretty town where we dined, having past that fore-noone in
danger near a great company of Crabats, who were thereabouts, who frighted the
town: for when his Excellencies Harbenger entered the gates an hour before us,
they were all shutting up of their shops, and running out to defend the town.
After dinner through most plains and corne-fields which were a reaping, until
we came at Bodewich, a poor village, Bodewic
where we lay on the plancher, and traveled that day seven Dutch miles.

The next day being Sunday, and the third of July, we stayed there until
dinner, and thence through part of a wood called Hertz-waldt, on a causey two
English miles long, the wood being three hundred miles in length (as we were
credibly informed) passing through we saw several fires in it, and many strange
things are likewise seen, and so by Bernetz, a little town at the end of the
wood, to Iglo, Iglo.
a beautiful built town seated on a little hill, where we lay that night,
having gone four Dutch miles and an half. Early the next morning from thence
passing over a River at the end of the town, which parts Moravia and
Bohemia, and then through Stickey the first town in Bohemia, so through
Haybeireitz a village, in which an Oast killed at several times of his guests
ninety men, and made meat of them, so to Dutchbrade a town where we dined,
and then departed, passing through a plain wooddie country to Holebrum, where
we lay that night on the plancher, which was a most fearful night of thunder
and lightning, having traveled seven Dutch miles.

The next morning we departed, and went through a wooddie country again, and
through a town called Shasshaw where in the street we passed through, Shasshaw.
lies buried the body of one John Ziska, who made war against the Emperor
Rodolphus, in the defense of his dear friend John Hus, who died a Martyr: this
John Ziska in all his wars was a victor, and when he was blind desired to be
carried up and down the wars, and at his death commanded that a Drum might be
made of his skin, which was done, and wheresoever that was, they subdued
likewise; then by a silver Mine of the King of Hungaries, which was by the way
side on a little hill, into which we entered to see their works, the oar being
two hundred and fifty fathom deep, and behind this place is a city called
Kettenburgh, which we left two English miles of our left hand and thence to
Colen two English miles off likewise where we dined; about part of the town
runs the River Elbe: after dinner we past through a plain country to
Bemishbrade, Bemishbrade.
where we lay on the plancher again, having traveled eight Dutch miles,
which has been a fair built town, and very pleasantly seated, but now burnt
almost down by a Carpenter, when the Emperor was in it, and since been
pillaged twice, by the Swedish, and the Duke of Bavaria his forces.

The next morning early, being the sixth of July, from thence to Prague to
dinner, Pragu
being five Dutch miles, passing first through very pleasant plains and
meddowes, until we came near the city, which is encompassed on both sides
with rocks and hills, all planted with vines, having three towns belonging to
it, Newstadt, Oldstadt, and the Slostadt; at Newstadt we entered in at a fair
gate, passing through into Oldstadt, to his Excellencies lodging, which said
Stadt is inhabited chiefly by Jews, who have there four Synagogues, and in
one I saw there a Rabbi circumcise a child, here we were told that all their
fruits in the further parts of the country were spoiled, as corn, vineyards,
and the like, by the aforesaid thunder and lightning with hailestones as big as
ones fist, and also diverse cattle were then lost: between this and the
Slostadt runs a pleasant river called the Muldow, and over it stands a
fair Bridge of stone, as long as London Bridge, over which his Excellency
passed, going to view the Castle, being a stately large built Fort, seated on a
high hill within the Slostadt, called Ketschin, in which the King of Bohemia
lived* first we passed through three fair Court-yards, having at one of the
gates a guard of Soldiers in which Courtyard there is a statue of S. George
on horseback in brass, and a fountain, then entered we into a spacious hall,
having many fair shops in it like unto Westminster, but that their Courts of
Judicature are in other rooms by it: from hence we went up and passed through
many fair rooms well hung, and pictures in them, and one room furnished with
English pictures of our Nobility, which the King of Bohemia was forced to
leave, passing thus until we came at one room two stories high, which was
their Councell-chamber, where the Bohemians being sat at Council, and three of
the Emperors Couucell with them, there rose a mutiny, insomuch that they threw
them three out on the ground, which was fifty five foot high, and shot pistols
after them, yet none of them killed, and two of them still alive, and upon that
ground they fell on are set set up three gilt crosses: then went we down into
a stately lower room, which used to be their masking room, upholden with
several fair pillars, in the middle, and statures of brass placed by them;
by the walls hang pictures of Indian horses which were there then; adjoining to
this is a large dining room, having a table in it of Mozaique work, and
music within it not to be discerned, then at the end of this room is a
little place where choice armor is, and one Piece which I saw shot off a
bullet, not having any powder in it: then into the Schaut kamber, where the
treasure was, and a most noble collection of the Emperor Rodolphus.

In the first room was cup-boords placed in the walls on our right hand; the
first was of coral; the second, of Purslaine; the third, of mother of pearl;
the fourth, of curious brasse-plates engraven; the fifth and sixth.
Mathematical Instruments; the seventh, Basins, Ewers, and cups of Amber; the
eighth, cups of Aggets, Gold and Crystal; the ninth of rocks; the tenth, of
Mozaique work in stone; the eleventh, cups of Ivorie, and a great Unicornes
horn a yard in length; the twelfth, of imbossing work; the thirteenth, of
Brass pictures; the foureteenth, of antic things cast in silver; the
fifteenth, cabinets of Bohemia Diamonds, and little chests of Bohemia pearl;
the sixteenth, things belonging to Astronomy; the seventeenth and eighteenth,
Indian work; the nineteenth, Turkey-worke; the twentieth, of a lively statue
of a woman covered with taffatie. Then in the middle of the room are rare
clocks of all kinds; the first was like a globe with music; the second was set
round about the middle with little pillars, and a bullet running round in a
cresse out and in, and over it hung two little cords, which being pulled, we
heard sweet music, but could not discern from whence it was; the third had a
fair lively face and hand looking out, and music with voices singing, not to
be discovered; the fourth, a close clock, and by it a fair table of Mozaique
work; the fifth, with four ascents set severally with pillars, and a bullet
running round in a cresse up to the top, playing with music; the sixth, like
the top of a globe, the gold colored like a green field, and a Bucke running
round in and out, and hounds after making a noise, and beneath music, and
Anticks, dancing in a round within it; the seventh, a clock with a globe: by
the walls on the other side anticke things set up, and pictures, together with a
steel chair very curiously wrought and cut through. Then entered we into
another little closet, wherein were more cabbins placed in the walls on the same
side, of presents sent to the Emperor, as gilt helmets and head pieces, and
statues.

In the third room, four cup-boords in the walls full of rare pictures, and in
the middle of the room anticke things, as a Bore rough cast to the life, and a
statue of a strong Maid to the life, who went to war, and a press of ancient
books. The fourth room, three cup-boords full of the Anatomies of several
rarities, as Cockatrices, and fishes part resembling men; and the fourth
cup-boord of rare great shells; the fifth, of fine dishes; the sixth, of all
kind of little shells, and a Library, with one mighty great book in folio,
written by a Friar in a dungeon, who was there put in, upon some heinous
offense there to suffer, and forty years after discovered by some Friars
going near, hearing a noise, had search made, and found him, who brought forth
this book, consisting of the old and new Testament, and many strange
histories, which he was all that time a writing, and assisted by the Devil
(as he conceived) and spoke very little more before he died.

Here is likewise all the skins of those Indian horses, whose pictures hung up
in the masking room: then did we enter into a large Church, standing near
about the middle of the Castle, where about the Quire are cut in wood many fine
things, and a tomb of the Queens Confessor, called Johan. Nepomews, who was
miserably tortured by Wenceslaus the fourth King of Bohemia, to reveal her
Majesty's confession, and at last put to death by him, Anno Dom. 1383, from
hence his Excellency went to view a garden behind the castle within the wall,
where we went in a walk covered arbour-like, half an English mile long,
until we came at a stately old building, with walks round the house, and set
thick with pillars and likewise on the top of the house, with a delightful
prospect over all the city, and then his Excellency returned back to the
Keepers house, and there dined, having sent provision before: dinner being
past, his Excellency went to see a Park two English miles off the City, in
which there is a Friarie of white Friars, who were leaping then in the Park,
as we passed by to see a great beast called a Buffule, which is kept there,
and then returned home by Wallensteines new house, into which his Excellency
entered to view it, first passing through a large hall of eight and thirty
paces, or more in length, and one and twenty in breadth, we went up through
galleries having pictures hung up, and painted on the walls with stories of
Hercules, above head diverse stories of Ovid; then to the Audience-roome, where
the four elements are in the middle above head, and through other fair
chambers; then down into the garden, where there are five fountains, and
great figures of brass placed on them, and on the great fountain Neptune,
with four Nymphs about him, and a fair Grott-house, but the waters run not;
then into the stable, being curiously built, where six and twenty horses may
stand, the pillars and manger all of red marble, and thirty eight in number,
and each pillar cost twenty five pounds, there are four Court-yards which
encompasseth the house, which is now the King of Hungaries.

This Wallensteine was sole Commander of the Empire, under the Emperor, and
grew so great, which caused his Majesty to be jealous of him, as he had just
cause considering his plots which he had laid against the Crown; but to
prevent the worst, privately took order with some of his Irish Captains, who
were appointed to keep watch of him that night, to cut him off, which was
effected in the evening, pressing on the sudden into his chamber found him
only in his shirt, and said, Live Ferdinando, but dye traitor Wallensteine;
at which he opened his arms and cried, Oh my God, embracing the stabs of the
halberds, which done, they cut off his head, and presently posted to the
Emperor with it, who gave them great rewards, and they still continue much in
his favor.

The next day his Excellence was invited to a play at the Jesuits College,
where the Senior of the house is an Irish man, and there entertained
Prince-like; first, an oration by a young Scholar, then passing down by a
Guard of Soldiers, who discharged their muskets: his Excellence being past to
the room where the Comedy was acted, which action did please exceedingly, not
only in respect of substance, but also for the goodness of the action and
several habits, in number more than fifty, the chief part were young
Scholars, and diverse of them Barons sons, and being ended, desired to kiss
his Excellencies hand kneeling, in testimony of his approbation. And here is
the argument annexed in the page following.

The Epilogue

Alluding to the Arms of the House of the Howards, both wish and presage all
happiness to the Ambassador, and having made obeisance to him, give him
thanks for himself, and for all the rest.

Here we stayed seven days, and departed the thirteenth of July for Regenspurg
by wagons, over the plain where the great battle was fought, between the
Emperor and the King of Bohemia, not above two English miles from the city,
there we did observe many places in the ground, wherein the dead bodies were
put, and a great company of bones lying by on a heap, where were slain in all
on both sides about thirty thousand: from thence through a plain corn
country, to a little town three Dutch miles from Frague, called Beroum, where
we lay, which town has been burnt by the Duke of Saxon his forces. The next
morning early we went through plain corne-fields and meddowes, until we came
to Mauth, a poor village where we dined: from thence through woods, and by
poor villages burnt, to a pretty town called Pilsen, where we lay that
night, having traveled seven Dutch miles, it is seated in a plain, with three
little rivers running by it, as Misen, Glatow, and Pilsen, taking the name from
the town.

The next morning through a wooddie country and corne-fields to Swabe to
dinner; after dinner to Bishopsteine to bed, Bishopsteine.
having this day traveled but four Dutch miles, in which the Count
Dorfmastaff has a little castle pleasantly seated, and the river Igree running
about part of it, the town was never pillaged as yet. Early the next morning
from thence passing through a very stony hill, and a wood four English miles in
length, called Bemer-waldt, wherein about the midst there is a Schans, in
which Count Mansfelt and his Army lay two months, at which Schans the upper
Palatinate begins. Then to Waldminiken, a little town to dinner, the first in
the upper Palatinate; and the Oast of the house did serve Count Mansfelt as
Ancient at that time: after dinner through a wooddie poor country to Redtz a
little town where we lay that night, having traveled six Dutch miles.

The seventeenth day being Sunday, early we departed, passing through great
woods, in danger of the Crabats lying thereabouts, and carried out of our way
by by chance through an ignorant guide, until we came to Bruke, a town
miserably ruinated, seated pleasantly in a plain, where there was not above
four poor households remaining: not long since it was in great prosperity;
for when we were a little past the town, there was a gallows and scaffold by
the way, whereon the Burgers of the town suffered, and many hanging still, who
were Lutherans: then to a town called Nettenow to dinner, and from thence
after dinner to Regenspurg, having traveled seven Dutch miles this day,
passing first through many pleasant places of landskips, and over the river
Regen, (which runs into the Danuby just by the city) passing over on
rafters, the bridge being beaten down then with the other former batteries:
between Vienna and this place, are many fair built towns promising much, by
reason of their several Piazzo's, or Marketplaces and Fountains, with other
such expressions, but entering the houses, scarce find men, lodging, or people
of understanding to exchange discourse with. The next day after his Excellence
came hither, Regensp
the Ambassador of the Elector of Brandenburg visited him; and the day after
his Excellence visited him again; here his Excellence stayed but four days,
because the Emperor was not come, and departed for Augusta, on Thursday the
one and twentieth of July, and dined that day at Sall, a small town on the
Danuby, thence through Bavaria to Augsburg, a very fine town standing on the
river Volga, which a little before falls into the Danuby, and thence that night
to Neistadt, a fair town ten miles from Regenspurg, where his Excellence lay
that night.

Next day early passing through a fine wooddie country to Bezanzon, where my
Lady Abbess gave his Excellence a banquet, from thence after dinner to
Palermo, a stately town, Palermo
and there lay that night, having traveled seven Dutch miles. Satturday being
the three and twentieth of July, we departed for Augusta, passing through part
of Tiroll to Mumantia, burnt some two years since by General Cleandor, one of
the King of Swedens Colonels; and from thence to Dole, which has been a very
pleasant situated town, standing on the brow of a hill, from whence at the
distance of three English miles we beheld Augusta, which town of Dole was also
with Bezanzow burnt by Colonel Cleandor two years since, passing through this
town, we descended into a goodly valley, but ere we gut into it, went over a
small arm of the river Tanais, (which encompasseth Augusta on the West, as the
river Vindilicorum does on the East) passing this valley, which is the more
famous, in respect at the upper end of it was fought the great battle of
Pharsalia, between Pompey and Julius Caesar, from whence it takes the name of
the Plain of Pharsalia: drawing near Augusta, we passed over five bridges
standing over the river Vindilicorum, which is divided into so many branches so
running with so many Bulwarks: the river water is of an excellent green
color, which is caused (as they say) running out of Copperas mines, which are
in the mountains of Dalmatia, from whence it springs, taking its name from
Vindix a famous Captain, who first rebelled against Nero, passing over all
these bridges, we entered the outer town, which is well built, and so in at a
broad port through the high street to his Excellences lodging, that day and the
next was spent in seeing pictures: Monday being the five and twentieth day, his
Excellence went to see the Stadt-house. First you must understand it to be a
square pile, of at least one hundred foot square; in the midst against the
street, ye enter by a large pair of stairs of thirteen steps, into a
stately lower room supported by twelve Calcidonian pillars, opposite to which
against the walls stand the images of the first Caesar's, which because they were
written under,

I will mention as first, Augustus the City Founder, from whence it takes the
name, then Tiberius, Nero, Sergius, Andronicus, Meleager, Themistocles,
Lysimachus, Orion; Phoebus, Enobarbus, and Barbarossa, over it in another room
which to come to, we passed up six and thirty stairs which as the other was
supported by twelve Pillars of Corinthian work and Jasper stone, in which is
painted to the life (which they say, was done by Apelles and Michael Angelo,
the one the master the other the man) are the Images of Lycurgus, Zeno,
Aristocrates, Aristides, Agathocles, Phocion, Anaxagoras, the first Triumvirat
of Rome, thence by thirty steps more into the State-house it self, which is
a most curious piece of Work, without Pillars, peeced with Onyx and Smarage,
two excellent kinds of Marble, found in the Teneriffe a mountain of Tiroll,
it is about the Walls painted with the Stories of all the gods, painted by
Raphael Urbine, some twelve years since, against this State-house stands a
goodly Fountain in the middle on a Pedastall of Brass, the Statue of Augustus

ascents of Stairs, and through a long Gallery 90. paces long, ruff cast with
several stories, and at the end entered into a square chamber, which sometimes
is their Councell-chamber, so into the second, third and fourth room, which is

his Pictures, was the picture of his Grandfather, who had neither nose nor
chin; as the picture demonstrateth; and then presented his Excellence with a
Banquet: from hence to another fair house adjacent, and very well furnished
likewise, but before we came into the rooms, we went up the curiousest
Stayre-case of stone as ever I have seen.

And from hence to the Castle, where the Father of one of the Lords lived, who
after he had showed his Excellence all the rooms in the Castle, which adjoynes
to the wall of the Town, standing on a Hill, and a very deep Well of one

staying that night there, having no other Town near to go to. After dinner,
the Lords of the Town sent his Excellence a present of Two and thirty Flaggons

The next morning before his Excellence departed, he was visited by the Bishop
of Wesburg, whom we found, in the habit of a Country Gentleman, setting aside
his Order, which is an enamelled Cross hanging on a Black ribbon about his
neck; who made very much of his Excellence, and presented him with the Picture
of our Lady, done by Albertus Durerus, being one of his best pieces; and then
took leave of him, who was ready to ride out of Town, to some other place for
safety, the Swedes being within two days march of it, and then his Excellence
returned to his Lodging, and presently went away.

The seaventeenth day, taking a fresh Convoy went to Bishopsheim that night,
Bishopsheim.
a Town seated in a bottom, and encompassed round with Hills, having the
River Tauber running about part of it, belonging to the Bishop of Mentz;
traveling this day four Dutch miles and most part through great Woods.

Early next morning, thence through K^lsen a Village, and diverse other poor
Villages burnt and pillaged, passing through a hilly woody Country in much
danger of the Croats, and spying some running up and down in the Woods, being
round about us, in number 6000. or more, dispersing themselves into several
Companies, pillaging and robbing of the Country; traveling this day five
miles to Mildebarke, Mildebarke.
but a Dutch mile before we came thither, entered into our old way at
Nunkirken, the poor burnt Village before mentioned, which is now inhabited by
some Four or five poor people.

The 19. day in the morning, from thence another way, taking another fresh
Convoy, leaving our old way and the Maine on our right hand, passing along by
the side of it, through Hybach a Village, and a fair House which is the Bishop
of Mentz likewise, and through other Villages miserably battered, and in
Plains some six English miles in length, until we came to Selgenstadt,
Selgenstadt.
having gone this day six Dutch miles. Falling into our old way within one
mile of the Town, traveling all those days in danger of the Croats, where as
soon as his Excellence lighted, the Grave Vandosme Governor of the Country
for the Bishop of Mentz, sent his Excellence a present of half a wild Bore,
and likewise provision for his Horse; knowing that the Town could not afford
any thing.

The twentieth day being Sunday, early in the morning, we went thence to
Frankfort Frankfort
to dinner, which was three Dutch miles.

And the next morning after, his Excellence went to Hannaw to visit Sir James
Ramsey, Hannaw.
a Scotch Gentleman and Governor of the Town, and there stayed that night,
who met his Excellence without the gate with a troop of Horse, and entering
the Town there went off a brace of Canons, and when his Excellence lighted,
went off two more by the door of his Excellencies lodging; which Town, was
besiedged a Year and a half by the Emperors forces, and at the beginning of
the Siege had such a grievous Plague, that there dyed in 7. Weeks, 22000. yet
for all this, they kept out the enemy, though in great want and misery, and
three months since it was releeved by the Landt-grave of Hesse, who slew a
great company of the Imperialists and drove the rest away; for as we passed by
before at a distance, we heard them as they were in their skirmish. The next
morning, his Excellence went about the Town to view the Works, which are very
strong, scarce to be scaled by any force, having two Engines made but of six
Musket barrels a piece, which Dutch Engine discharges 80. times together,
giving fire to it but once; the Town is seated in a plain ground, having the
Main on the East, and encompassed on the North and West, with the River
Knitszig, besides Moted round, and this River serves 14. Mills which adjoynes
to the Town, and before any man can enter into the old Town he must pass
over three Bridges, and through several Bulworkes, and over another into the
new Town; and at the relief of the Town, there was one Daniel Lauter a chief
Burger, dyed for very joy; he being above in his house and seeing the victory,
was overcome with such a mighty passion of joy, that he fell down and dyed
instantly; there was likewise a woman, who killed many Dogs and sold their
flesh at a great rate to many people, and one day as she walked in the
Streets, was like to have been devoured by them, had not some poor Soldiers
by chance releeved her, who presently confessed what she had done formerly,
acknowledging she had justly deserved it; and after dinner his Excellence took
leave of Sir James Ramsey, and then returned back to Frankfort.

The four and twentieth day, four of the Burgers of the City came and
presented their service to his Excellence with twenty flaggons of Wine, and
then dined with him; here we stayed three days until our Boats were made
ready.

And on Saturday the 26. day of November, we departed from hence, and rowed
down the Main; the first night to Flersheym, which was three miles, against
which we cast anchor and lay aboard; The next morning launched forth, and past
down to Mentz, and there his Excellence went on shore, to see if it were any
way enriched since our being there, but alas, we found it as miserable as
before, with diverse poor people lying on Dunghils almost starved, being scarce
able to crawle for to receive his Excellencies alms, and presently returning
to our Boat to dinner, we afterward releeved many poor hungry souls with
the fragments; Thence after dinner down the Rhyne to Rudeshem, which was five
Dutch miles, and there cast anchor, and lay on the boards likewise.

Very early the next morning we weyed anchor, and presently entered into a
dangerous place to pass, called Bingham-Locke, where the River Lo^ falls into
the Rhyne by the Town amongst many Rocks, which causes a violent fall,
tossing us up and down, that if we had but touched any part of them we had
all been cast away; being past this, we came to Bacharach, where, some of our
Company did but go ashore (and presently hastened after in a little Boat,)
were pursued by five Musketeers almost to his Excellencies Boat, who discharged
very often at them, yet by good fortune mist them, and having overtaken his
Excellence, they instantly fled away; then going on to a large Island an English
mile from Coblentz, we there cast anchor and lay all that night; for we could
not pass to the Town without leave from the Governor, by reason of several
watches which lay in our way; which night we lay in much danger, perceiving
them walk up and down to catch a prey, for as some of our company did but go
a little way from our Boat, they were laid hold on, and one that fled, had a
Musket shot at him, and he that was taken, they carried before their Commander,
who was in a Monastery in the Island, examining him, and then let him go. The
next morning, Coblentz.
his Excellence sent again to the Governor, for passage, who like a base
fellow made us stay that night also, and the next day until three of the clock
in the afternoon, and would not let us pass, for all that his Excellence had
sent him the Emperors Pass and Letter, wherein he was commanded, not only to
give passage, but, to assist him in any thing he required; yet for all this,
he kept us still, and would not give way that our Trumpeter might go to the
French in the Castle; but they perceiving how unworthily he did deal with his
Excellence, discharged 4. or 5. Cannons at his house, and shot quite through
it, at last he came at the third sending for, with an excuse, he was very
unkindly dealt with by Cardinal Genetta, the Popes Nuntio, who lately passed
by, going to Colle^, but stayed him three days first, before he let him
pass, and made him promise faithfully not to visit the French, but being got
beyond the Town landed and went in, which made him vow not to let any pass.
But after that he had talked a while with his Excellence, gave leave to fall
down near the Town, and having cast anchor, set a strong watch about us, and
then gave leave for the Trumpeter to go to Monsieur Salade in the Castle for
passage, who most willingly granted it, and sent his Excellence a very fair
ancient Picture; but hearing by the Trumpeter the Governors base usage toward
his Excellency, presently placed their Canons against his house, and vowed his
Son should give fire to them the next morning, and would send him such a
breakfast, as that he should need no dinner; in the interim, there came a
Lieutenant from the Governor, upon a color to visit his Excellence, who
proved a second Villain in the end, for all that we used him very well, and
fed his hungry belly better than it had been long before; for the Soldiers
themselves confessed, that they had but one Brown loaf and a half of Bread
in eight days, and not one penny of money; yet this Rascal lay lurking in our
Boat till our Trumpeter returned, and then violently took him and the
Skipper, and carried them into the Town and set a watch about them; and the
next morning, sent his Excellence word he might pass, but the Trumpeter
should follow after; whereupon his Excellence sent his Steward to know the
reason, who found them tied by the Arms together, the Skippers finger cut off,
and the Trumpeters head escaped very narrowly from being cloven in two, had not
his strong Hat defended it, and also had threatened to hang them up the next day
together, but with much ado he brought them away with him, and after followed
a Gentleman to excuse that barbarous base usage of the Lieutenant, and leave to
pass, presently departing, and being gone but a little past the Town and
against the Castle, they saluted us, and said they would drink the King of
Englands health, and then gave fire to more than twenty thundering Cannons,
beside a brave volley of small Shot, which made their Houses to smoke and
tumble in our sight, but they durst not return one back again; the other
Governor Geats, gave us very noble usage, but this who was lately sent, showed
himself so base, that he deserves no name with us; from hence to Bonn, and
there cast anchor, but durst not lie nigh the Town, the Sickness being very
sore in it, and this day rowed eight miles.

The next day being the first of December, in the morning we went from thence
to Collen, Collen.
being four miles, leaving those delightful Mountains, Hills, and pleasant
Vines, and entered into a plain Country, where as soon as we came into the
Town, near the Palace where the Cardinal lay, had information, of all what
the boorish Governor of Coblentz said of him was false; we stayed here three
days until we had exchanged our Boats for bigger, and every day his
Excellence had presented unto him 24. Flaggons of Wine, sent from the
Magistrates; who once dined with him.

And on Sunday the 4. day of December, about four of the clock at night took
Shipping, and the next morning at three a clock set sail, and sailed down by
Mulheim on the left side of the Rhyne, Mulheim.
and Sonts on the other side, which belongs to the Abbots of Collen, where
we stayed to free Toll; then on by Newse on the same side, where the River
runs out to it, Dusseldorpe
and so to Dusseldorpe, where as soon as we came but near the shore, out came
the Noble Duke of Neuburgh, and clambered over other Ships to come into ours,
to visit his Excellence, being much joyed at his safe return, and had made
provision at his House to entertain his Excellence, but perceiving he would
not stay, sent for a wild Bore, Wine, and five Pictures, and presented them to
his Excellence, then took his leave, being very sorry to let him go, but
considering the time and tediousness of the weather, was more willing to give
leave, he staying by the shore until we put off, and then went off 10.
Cannons, the Duke still walking along the shore as far as the water would
give him leave, and stayed until we were out of fight. From thence by
Keiserswert belonging to the Elector of Collen, seated on the left side of the
Rhyne, where we were stayed to free our Toll again, and at our lanching forth
saluted us with one Piece of Ordnance, so on by Ordingen a little Town, where
on the other side, about a league further we cast anchor, against a small old
Castle called Engersort, sailing seven leagues and a half this day, for
before we went by miles, which were some four or five English miles at the
least in length, but these are but three English; this night we lay in much
danger, for there did lie on each side of us, parties, which robs and
pillageth all Passengers; for we saw above fifty in a company, going all along
by the shore, but a little before we cast anchor, and at 10. of the clock in
the night being very dark, was a false alarm given by the Watch of a party
coming, which made us all fly to our weapons, at last perceiving it was but
one Boat, and they that were in it, crying out Friends from the Duke of
Neuburg, else we had shot them, who came for to have passage into England.

Next morning early we weyed anchor, and went part of the day in danger
likewise, to Orsoy, the first Garrison Town of the States, where we were
stayed, and our Ship searched what we carried, but at our putting off, they
gave us two Pieces of Ordnance; so from thence along by Rhineberg, against
which there lay a man of War of the States, who saluted us with three Pieces;
then by Buricksweasell, and a league further we cast anchor in the middle of
the Rhyne, sailing this day but 4. leagues and a half, by reason of our stay
at several Toll places.

The next day early in the morning, set sail, and sailed down by Rhees,
Emmericke, and by Schenck-Schants, which is now new built and well fortified
again, where we left the Rhyne and that on our right hand, and went down in
a deep River called the Wall, by Nimmegen a fair Town, seated on the East
side of the Rhyne on a hanging Hill, where the Governor of the Town, Son to
one of the States, came forth and tendered his service to his Excellence. In
which Town there dyed this Summer 12000. people of the Plague, but now thanks
be to God, it is almost ceased: from thence, passing by several Redoubt-Houses
built at every half league, in which there lies a Watch continually to keep
the River, passing along until we came to the fourth House; where, for all
we told them it was an English Ambassador, shot four or five Pieces at us,
and mist some of us very narrowly; whereupon we cast anchor, and lay in the
middle of the Rhyne, but could not certainly learn who they were, sailing this
day seven leagues.

December the 8. in the morning, we set sail and went to Teill, Teill.
being but two leagues, and could not pass any further for ye, but sailed in
great danger thither of splitting our Ship by the violent force of it, which
caused us to stay there three days, until we heard there might be a passage
cut over the Rhyne at Viana; departed thither upon little Sledges, on Sunday
the eleventh of December, and passed over great quantities of ice, through
Burem, where the Prince of Orange has a fair Castle, thence to Culenburg, and
so to Viana to Bed, traveling with much labor some on foot, others by the
sledges this day 6. leagues, where Sir Ferdinando Curie, an English Gentleman,
entertained his Excellence that night, the Town is very pleasantly seated upon
the East side of the Rhyne, and the ^^rest things in it, are Flowers, for
there was a Tulip-roote sold lately for 340. pounds, as Sir Ferdinando informed
his Excellence.

The next morning, we took Boat and crossed over the River though with much
danger and difficulty in the wet, the wind and tide contrary, being got
ashorm, went to Vtrecht where we lay that night, which was but 2. leagues, and
where there then dyed of the Plague 80. a week, but a little before 300; from
the (...) to Leydon next day to Bed, traveling very late, and ^^ght leagues
this day; where some of the Princes the Queen of Bohemia's Sons, were at
School, whom his Excellence presently visited, and there met with some
Gentlemen, which the Queen had sent to meet his Excellence, and two of her
Coaches to fetch him to the Hague.

The next day before his Excell^ went away, he viewed the chief things of note
in the Town, as the Universities, the Anatomy School, which before we had
not leisure to see, and from thence after dinner to the Hague, which was but 3.
leagues, being Wednesday the 14th. day of December, and their Christmas Eve.

Thus leaving his Excellence at the Hague, I went for Amsterdam that famous
City, Amsterdam
first by Wagon to Harlem, which was five leagues, where I lay that night,
being a very well built Town, the next day to the City it self, which was
three leagues, passing all the way upon a Cawsey, by Harlem-Meare on my right
hand, and the River Tey on the left, and entered in at Harlem-Port, and past
through all the new Town, and over three large Graufts, Princes, Keasers, and
the Hears Grauft, these Streets be three Quarters of an English mile in
length, two hundredth paces in breadth, having an even row of stately beautiful
Buildings, and Trees planted the whole length of the Graufts side, and so into
the old Town, which is not of so stately a building, but the whole City is
built upon Piles in the water, and a great Channel runs through every
Street for the Merchants ships to sail to their doors, their Exchange is
built much like unto that in London, both beneath and above, but that it wants
a little in breadth, with water running under it, there is a very large
building called the Weishouse, wherein all poor Children, Fatherless, or of
decayed Parents, are there maintained and brought up, and there is now at this
present time 800. all clad alike, the one side of their garments Black and the
other Red; there is likewise four Hospitals adjoining one unto another, for
Men and Women to be severed each from other, the East and West Indian Houses,
two rare Builings and curious within, and many other delightful things to
please the eye, here I stayed two days; and on Saturday the 17. day of
December, at 5. of the clock at night, took a S^utz drawn by a Horse, and
went up a River along by the side of the Cawsey; than I passed down on before
to Harlem, and there at 10. of the clock in the Evening took a Wagon, and
travailed all night to the Hague, which was five leagues; but ferried over the
Rhyne at two in the morning, and got thither by 8. of the clock; where we
stayed Eight days, Hague.
and the most part of the time was spent at the Queens Court, and the rest in
visites, between the Prince of Orange, the States, and three Ambassadors which
were there; as Monsieur Charnesse from France, Seignior Carmerarius for the
Swedes, the Venetian Ambassador, and the Count of Culenburg; but hearing our
Ship was come, his Excellence took leave of the Queen at 10. of the clock at
night, and came away next morning being Wednesday, the one and twentieth of
December, and Prince Maurice along with him to Keswicke, where the Prince of
Orange has a House, which his Excellence viewed, and then the Prince taking
leave returned back again, and his Excellence rode on forward in her
Majesty's Coach to Delft where he dined, in which Town there are as many
Bridges as Days in the year, and so many Channels and Streets, where Boats
do pass up and down, and one common Passage under a Churchyard, under which
we did pass, from thence by a Scute to Rotterdam, where we lay, which is from
the Hague five leagues, until that the wind served us, and then on Saturday
being the 24. of December (and Christmas Eve by our style) at a 11. of the
clock in the night, took Boats and went to our Ship, sailing first through
Magan Sluice to Helver-Sluce, where our Ship called the Garland did ride at
anchor, and about 3. in the afternoon set sail, and sailed over the Bar,
having a Pilate sailing before us with a Lantern on the top of his Mast,
sounding for the depth all the way; and the next day at twelve of the clock
cast Anchor in the Dounes, and there rid and could not land for the roughness
of the Sea, until Tuesday morning the 27. of December, and then landed at
Deal, and from thence by Poast to Canterbury, and so to Sittinburne to bed.

The next day in the morning early to Gravesend, and there took water for
London; where on the way, my Right Honorable Lady met his Excellence, who
exchanged Barges, and there she entertained him with a Banquet, and so early
the next morning, went to Hampton Court to his Majesty.

FINIS.
