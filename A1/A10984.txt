LONDON, Printed for Nathanael Butter 1628.

A DECLARATION of the Duke of ROHAN Peer of France, etc. Containing the
justness of reasons and motives which have obliged him to implore the
assistance of the King of Great Britain, to take arms for the defense of the
Reformed Churches.
I Might content my self to oppose the sincerity of all mine actions against
the blame which ignorant or malicious persons will undertake to pour upon mine
innocence, and upon the necessity of my resolution: It might satisfy me if I
had no regard, but to my self to endeavor to do better, and to leave envy,
and slander for a chastisement to the calumniators, the equitable judgment of
good people, is to me in stead of an honorable recompense, and will always
give me more satisfaction then the blame of wicked people is able to do me
displeasure.

But for as much as at the ouerture of so great and extraordinary things which
happen among men, every one discourses according to his fantasy, and
oft-times evil interpretations do surmount above the most sound opinions, and
that above all silence is taken for a confession of the fact, and that Spirits
which are facile, and easy to be persuaded, if they be not instructed in the
truth, do readily suffer themselves to be surprised, and drawn to error;
from whence comes such diversity of speech among us, and the division of
hearts torn by contrary apprehensions, always accompanied with weakness,
and followed with ruin; and that the coming of strangers into the Kingdom
which men believe (and I do not deny it to have been procured by the care of
my brother, and my self,) shall be for a long time the subject of all the
good, or of all the evil which shall be discoursed of either within or without
this Kingdom: I have thought it my duty to put to light this small Discourse to
justify this action to all the world, to make it appear even unto our
enemies, that it is grounded upon an evident right, and to our friends that we
have been thereunto constrained by the most powerful laws of necessity.

It is well known to all men by what reasons I was bound to conclude the peace
in the treaty before Montpellier, wherein I had thought all at once to procure
deliverance, and respiration to the Church of God, to my King the honor and
glory which he could desire, and peace, and repose to the whole State, which
was thereunto so absolutely necessary: to arest the progress of the King of
Spain, who outragiously spurned with his feet the best, and most faithful
Allies of this Crown, that he might the better come with greater facility to
the end of this Monarchy, after the which he has long gaped; and the more
easily to attain this peace, we have yielded our selves with a full
confidence into his Majesty's hands, that we might be indebted for our
deliverance, next after God, to his only goodness, having for a precious gage
of our reestablishment, and preservation, his sacred word, I was persuaded
thereunto (besides the reasons above mentioned) by the Letters of the King of
Great Britain, and of eminent men amongst us, which did give testimony to
have yet much zeal for the Church.

But I know not through what Council the word which his Majesty confirmed
unto me all the time till he came to Lions, and afterward by many letters,
was found so suddenly altered, the public faith violated, and all our dear,
and most necessary liberties oppressed.

For in stead of re-establishing according to the Acts and Conditions of the
Peace of Mountpelier, in its first estate, the Magistracy is changed and parted
in two by violence; a Citadell built, as a public monument, erected to
condemn or to kill our Conscience: and a Garrison of four thousand men
maintained within the Town, to the insupportible vexation of all the
Inhabitants. In stead of demolishing the Fort of Rochell according to the same
promises specified in his Majesty's acts, they have augmented and fortifyed it
with all things necessary for a long and perpetual establishment, and from the
same do plot many enterprises against the Town, which being discovered, were
authorized, not only by impunitie, but even by recompenses given to the
undertakers.

The exercise of our religion is not reestablished in the places from whence it
was expelled during the war, but even during the peace many other Churches
are entangled in the same persecution, diverse Pastors imprisoned, Edicts and
Declarations made against the liberty of discipline, as it appears by the
presence of Commissaries in the Ecclesiastical Assemblies. And in hatred of
the Religion many places are spoiled, and razed in time of peace, as Caumont,
Castillon, Pont-Orson, and others: The Chamber of the Edict (a Court of Justice
for those of both Religions) within the Town of Castres is not reestablished
as it was promised, but is transferred to Beziers a seditious town, and of a
contrary religion. They torture, torment and send to the Galleys men that are
innocent and of reputation, upon ungrounded suspicions, and invented
accusations: They divide our Magistrates by a decree as at Pamies: they
confiscate the greatest part of our goods under title of reprisals. To
conclude, they do all things otherwise then was promised by the treaty. I
made unto the King most humble, and reiterate remonstrances by letters and
deputation, but in the end they were offended with my complaints, and imputed
them as a crime; the King by an express letter imposed Silence upon me, and
prohibited me any more to relieve the interest of our Churches, and proceeded
so far as to offer commissions to certain neighbor Gentlemen of that place
of my retreat, with great promises, to seize upon my person, either alive or
dead: and for proves of that, they have lately sent one to murder me, which
narrowly missing of his purpose, shooting of a Pistol at me burnt my Ruff,
and killed one which stood next behind me, having before divulged among those of
our religion, by men waged, and paid to that end, that I had sold the
liberty of our Churches, and had received the damnable reward of their last
infalliable destruction. And to cover unto strangers of our religion the
design which they had for our perdition, they publish in brute only war
against the Spanyard, the league with other Princes, and States interessed,
whilst that underhand by the intermission of a Legate, peace is treated with
him; and finally was concluded, as the time did make it appear, leaving for a
prey unto him those which they had animated, and armed out of those hopes,
whilst they prepared vessels, and all equipage necessary to block up Rochell.

The affairs were reduced to such terms that Mountpelier was captive,
Rochell upon the point to be the like, all the Churches of this Kingdom
threatened with bondage, and for mine own particular, I was cruelly vlcered to
see my self made so black with Calumnies, as if I had by preuarication
consented to the ruin, and oppression of so many poor people, the complaints
whereof peirced my heart, and made me to feel a more insupportable dolor
then all the rest of my sufferings.

Being pressed with such displeasures, when all hopes of bettering our
condition were taken away, and that by express letters they gave us to
understand, that the desire of changing our condition, or to require it, should
be for the time to come the greatest, and the most unpardonable of all our
crimes, and that if it we not prevented by some bold, and prompt resolution,
Rochell would be lost; my brother protected the enterprise of Blauet, from
whence insued the precedent war with such success, as is known to all men,
and which notwithstanding by the providence of Almighty God, finished with
greater advantage for our Churches, then we should have hoped for: In regard
that the King finding it convenient that the peace should be concluded through
the interuention of the Ambassadors of England, who by virtue of their
co^missions bound their Master to the inviolable observation of the treaty,
and that by writings, and an authentical act, by them signed, and sealed with
their seals of Arms, which were in their behalf sent unto us by Monsieur de
Montmartin, (at the time, when I had conuocated the Assembly at Nismes, for the
acceptance of the peace,) in two Originals, whereof the one is at Rochell, and
the other with me, which contain in express terms as follows: That they
give us such assurance, that the King of great Britain will labor by his
intercessions joined to our most humble supplications to abridge the time for
the demolishing of the Fort Lewis, for the which they as Ambassadors gave us
all such Royal words and promises as we could desire. And the said Monsieur de
Montmartin did assure me from him in that behalf, that they being returned
into England would cause to be delivered unto my brother another Act signed
with the Kings own hand, which should contain in express terms, viz. That
if the King should refuse, or too long defer the razing of the said Fort, and
the entire observation of the treaty of the peace, the said King of Great
Britain would employ all the forces which God has given him to maintain his
word, and to make us fully to enjoy those things which have been promised by
the answers and declarations of his Majesty, and by the act of the
interuention of his Ambassadors. Which gave us hope, that either the conditions
of this peace should be more exactly observed then those of the former, or in
case of new oppressions, we should have for our warrant to sustain us him who
made himself the Mediator of the treaty, interpreter of words given and
pledges for the inviolable observation thereof.

But we have been so unhappy, that although it seemed unto us that this peace
built upon so weak foundations should continue many ages, yet notwithstanding
it was worse observed then all those which have been violated with more
license, and less consideration: For after that the Kings Counsel had revoked
all promises which they had made to all strangers which are allied to the
Crown, to sign and conclude the league against the Spanyard, they made a
shameful peace with him, and have equally contemned all the the Edicts which
were given us to move us to lay down the arms we had then taken up for our
necessary defense: For the Edict was not verified in the Parliaments, but with
modifications, which destroyed them; neither could we with all our suits ever
obtain to have the said modification to be read: And in stead of razing the
Fort of Rochell, and to deliver the government thereof from souldierss
according to the promises; They have on the contrary filled the Fort with new
munitions, given the keeping of it to a favorite, and multiplied the soldiers
within the Isles; They have drawn and built mighty Forts, to hold them in a
perpetual servitude, and to take from Rochell all hope of liberty for the time
to come; they have with impunity made enterprises upon the town. They would
exile the Pastors which were affectionate to the conservation thereof; they
have filled the coast with ships of war, and by land they have hindered
them from gathering their fruits at Sea they have arrested the ships which
brought corn for their provision; They have oppressed their merchandise with
new subsidies, and by this means do spoil their commerce: To conclude, they
have made them under the name of peace to feel the hardest conditions which
they might suffer during the calamity of the war: and for the height of all
evil, they maintain within the enclosure of the walls Commissaries being armed
with emiment authority, who insolently do labor to oppress the rest of their
liberties, and to subvert all the foundations of their subsistence.

In the mean time the generality of our Churches has not been more
favorably used; for the Commissaries, who though they were always promised,
never came within the provinces for the execution of the Edict; nor the
exercise of our Religion was never re-established in the places where it was
ordained by the declaration that it should be replanted, by means whereof
there are more then forty Churches of great importance destitute of this
consolation. Our Temples are by the same injustice and violence always
detained from us as they were before. And even since the peace, in diverse
places they have committed new barbarous insolences upon this subject; among
others the Cardinal of Sourdis, and the Baron of Peraut, all which remain
without reparation, and without punishment: And by an Edict of fresh date the
14. of April, in this year 1627. they term, the liberty of our Religion, a
simple toleration, until (as they say) that we be reunited under one Pastor
(that is to say the Pope) to make us know that we deceive our selves in
believing that the most just liberties which have been granted us should be
perpetual and inviolable: And in the same Declaration they do entirely
ouerturne all the discipline of our Churches, for they do absolutely interdict
all the Pastors to make any politic assemblies, although they be but only
for the liberty of our consciences, and the assurance which is given unto us to
maintain them: And by a like draught of the pen they blast all the Pastors
which are not borne within the Kingdom, taking away their liberty to come into
the Ecclesiastical assemblies Provincial or National: And they prohibit us
to give or lend Pastors to strange Churches or Universities, or to receive any
from them without express permission from the King. They command them that are
without, to return without delay, and yet notwithstanding they say that they
may not re-enter into their houses without Letters Patents from the King,
countersigned by a Secretary of State, and sealed with the great Seal: To
conclude they impose a yoke such as our fathers never heard of.

The Church of Roan having desired the Lord of Veilleux his Minister to come
preach to them he was forbidden to go, to the end to take away for the time
to come, the liberty of our Churches to provide themselves of Pastors whose
doctrine and piety should be for the edification of every one, and not to have
power to call others, but only such as shall be to the liking of the Ministers
of the State, unto whom from henceforth we must address our selves for the
like affairs, and so to destroy the authority of Assemblies and Synods, and
the order hitherto here maintained in our Churches. The reprisall of our goods
are always in force and virtue, and if from the Chamber of the Edict some
equitable sentence be obtained, there is presently found an elusion by calling
the matter into the Kings Counsel, or by some contrary judgment of the
Parliament given at the request of a Procurator general which does make the
former void and of none effect: And they have condemned diverse persons for
cases aduowed by the General, and abolished by the Edict; and others are
burdened with great fines for the like subject; and moreover there are more
then 2000 warrants given in the Province of Languedoc, to take prisoners in
hatred of the precedent commotions, which constrain a multitude of persons
whose lives are without reproach, to banish themselves from their ordinary
habitations, leaving their families desolate, to go seek their liberty, and
the assurance of their lives. The Towns which are yet left us in diverse
places, do serve no more for retreats for those which have been therein
refuged in the former troubles, mine own house filled with people which are
driven from their own habitations, and exposed to all injuries for the same
subject. And in diverse places they have detained in chains, adjudged to fines,
and threatened with more grievous punishment diverse persons, for speaking or
writing according to our doctrine, and against the opinion of the Church of
Rome, as at Lions, Aix, Beziers and Montpelier.

At Nismes in hatred that I had there my retreat, they have there stirred up
all the persecutions that might be imagined: They have sent Commissaries to
appoint Magistrates contrary to the privilege of the place. And the Consuls
created they have interdicted them by Decrees, and given out warrants for the
attaching of their bodies, and never yet in Kings Counsel could they have any
justice* and in hatred of that which Monsieur d'Aubais had done in accepting
generously the charge of Consul, they have lodged in those places which belong
unto him certain Companies of horse to eat them up. And was never any amongst
us who either for the general or for the particular since the Peace, suing in
any request to the Counsel grounded upon the Edict, has obtained ought, but
great expenses, unprofitable suits, continual mockes or brauadoes, and most
bitter temptations to bind him either through fear or hope to make shipwreck
of his faith.

I do not here set down the persecutions which I suffer in mine own
particular, as some having for hire sought my life, and remain unpunished, and
the Auocates which plead my cause have been evil entreated and suspended from
their charge in the Chamber at Again: and still they seek by Diabolical
practices the means for to take away my life, whereof I dare not complain,
fearing thereby to procure some great advantage and honor to those which make
themselves instruments of such cowardly and disloyal attempts: And that those
which have forged the deceit by whom I was accused to have made some enterprise
upon Somniers in the time of peace, who being discovered have received no kind
of punishment, in such sort that the principal Officers who sat in judgment
acknowledging mine innocence, said notwithstanding that it was important for
the service of the King not to have it manifested: And that my Lady my mother
having sought her refuge within Rochell for her safety, and to give order for
her affairs there, they have used all possible means to have her forth,
telling the Inhabitants that she was the only obstacle to the accomplishment
of the promises made unto them for their deliverance: And this instance was
made after that her houses, and my sisters were full of garrisons, who have
outragiously beaten her officers, and committed all the most reproachable
insolences: Which notwithstanding are things which I would hold hidden in my
bosom, if the persecutions which they have made me to suffer were not the
reward of that which they think they owe me, for the entire affection which I
have always sincerely shown for the good and for the preservation of all our
Churches: But in this cause I do not desire that my interests should be had
in consideration: if I were my self alone to suffer all these miseries, my
feeling thereof should never go beyond the complaint: if it might so please
Almighty God only for me to be cast into the sea so the tempest might be
appeased: I should always be well content to sacrifice my goods, and my life,
for the tranquillity of the state, and for the preservation of the Church of
God, more then the which I confess that there is nothing which can be more
dear and precious unto me.

This is in Sum the matter of our grief, whereof every piece might serve for
the Subject of a very long and deplorable History: to those which suffer
whereof notwithstanding resulteth that they will neither administer mercy nor
justice unto us, nor no promises, nor other, no Edicts, no Declarations, nor
Acts can cover us from the persecution which vexes Us, nor from greater
calamities which threaten us; neither is there any faith, how public and
eminent soever the breaking whereof, for our destruction, is not made a glory;
And it is more firmly resolved then ever, to put in practice to our cost this
sanguinarie Maxim, that there is no faith to be kept with Heretics, for our
enemies cannot lose the desire they have for our perdition, exepecting the
opportunity and power sufficient to execute it, and in the conclusion, all the
essential conditions of peace (which was thought could not be denied us,
without an evident injustice, and which imploreth vengeance to God and men) are
found in all the principal places to be infringed and violated.

And above all the evils so great and so sensible, we have with all convenient
humility powered forth our complaints and Remonstrances at the Kings feet,
after that we had endured them with a patience without example: but the
practice of our enemies, and the hatred which they bear unto our Religion,
have so prevailed over the iustnes of our Cause, that the most humble
supplications of our Churches both in general and particular brought in the
behalf of a National Synod, and by the general Deputies, although formed
contrary to the Order granted by our Kings, and according to the commandment
and desire of his Majesty, have been sent away with ambiguous answers, or
with words without effect, or with sentences contrary to the most natural
justice, and most solemn Edicts, the power of our enemies being come to this
point, that they have call far off all hope of a general assembly to draw an
orderly form of our complaints, and then have finally prohibited our general
Deputies to present their demands in any such form, but to produce them a part
piece by piece, that they might dissipate all conjunction of our affairs, and
by that means make our Causes to be particular, and so to hinder us that we
shall not be able by any authentical Act to verify the body of iniustices,
which they do exercise against us.

Being taught by so many experiences that we can no more hope for any justice
from those which are obliged to administer it, and that our ruin was
irreuocably resolved in the minds of those unto whom the government of the
State was committed, and that our patience, in stead of diminishing our
afflictions, did augment them, and made them irremediable, and that we were in
all places accused of too simple a credulity or of an insensible stupiditie, in
the end I resolved to seek other courses then those which hitherto had been
so unprofitably used, and more solid and firm means for our re-establishment.

And forasmuch as the King of Great Britain was the Mediator of the peace,
and by the Act of his Ambassadors it was cautioned that it should be
inuiolably observed, I believed that it was not only necessary, but also most
just to have recourse to him, to inform him of the miserable estate of our
condition, and to let him know what care they have taken to deceive our
facility, to delude our hopes, and to destroy all the apparent grounds of our
liberty, to urge the performance of his word, and to conjure him as well in my
name is in the name of all our Churches, to interuent according to his promise,
and to intercede that the peace which he caused to be concluded might be
faithfully executed.

This is an Action which I suppose cannot be blamed even by our enemies,
except they be without reason, nor reproved by those of our party, except they
be without conscience: For the first do well know that the Laws of necessity
are the strongest and most natural, they know as well as we our selves the
iniustices which they have done us, the desolations wherewith they have
threatened us, the small estimation of the word which was given us, whereof they
have a thousand times very audatiously said that it was not in the Kings power
to make us to enjoy it. So far forth, that the Parliaments by their unjust
modifications have cancelled and cut off the most important Articles for our
subsistence; neither do they doubt either of the resolved design soon or
late of our perdition, and to expel us out of the Kingdom, or of the
preparatiues which they have made to come to the execution, in beginning with
the subversion or Rochell, from the which by all kind of forces and plots they
would race out the rest of our Churches, so that they cannot deny but they have
reduced us to the uttermost point of extreme necessity.

Moreover, they that have craved and borrowed the forces of strangers and of a
contrary Religion to their own to oppress us, cannot iudiciously complain
that we have sought the succors of our Brethren to defend us. And which is
more, our lives are in question, which they plot to extinguish; our goods,
whereof they have violently bereft us; our liberties, which they have
destroyed, and the greatest of all, our Religion, and the consciences which we
have toward Almighty God, of the which they would for ever deface the memory,
whosoever will impute it a crime unto us to seek all possible means to
preserve the possession of things which are so dear and precious, is bereft of
all natural sense, neither has he any more part of man left him but his
face, and does declare himself enemy to all Religion and conscience.

But forasmuch as the ministers of the State have thought good, that the
Ambassadors of the King of Great Britain, by a most authentical Act signed
and sealed in due form, making themselves, in the name of their Master,
Mediators of the conclusion of the treaty, and obliged his authority and his
word to make us enjoy the effect of all those things which were promised, and
that the Act it self was consigned unto us, I cannot persuade my self that
they can be so far unreasonable or passionate, after their consenting to so
solemn a caution as to think it strange that we should have our recourse to
the caution, and to the pledge which they themselves have chosen and approved
of, and that we entreat him to employ himself toward the principal party to
bind himself by the accustomed ways between men of this condition to
perform his Royal word, to discharge him or his caution, by the sincere and
exact maintaining and observation of all the things which were agreed upon, and
without the confession, whereof the difference should still remain, and the
things should be in as deplorable terms as they were before.

Concerning these among us which would disappproue this proceeding. I say that
they cannot with a good conscience, except therewithal they defame with odious
and execrable titles the generous resistance of those which have gone before
us, and who with their bloods have achieved us this holy and safe liberty for
the preservation whereof we do together at this time contest by the same
proceedings: which have passed the Sea to seek the succors which we have
obtained, and which went into the heart of Germany, to raise multitudes of
people, and to bring them into this Kingdom, and by force to bind their
enemies to give them peace and the liberty which was denied them, and to
perform the promise, which they had broken: And yet notwithstanding by the
Edicts of our Kings they are styled faithful and obedient Subjects and
Servants, and the memory of them shall ever be blessed in the midst of the
Church. And besides in that which concerns me, it seems unto me that all
kind of right and reason does authorize me in this pursuit, for hitherto in all
our wars of Religion, I have had in these parts the charge of chief and
General of all those which in these Provinces have had their arms in their
hands, for their just and necessary defense. The first peace has been fully
treated with me, according to the power which was given me by the general
assembly: And in the second my brother and my self alone have sustained the
charge of the war, and I have been present as General for the defense of our
Churches, and in the treaty and conclusion of peace, that cautionarie Act of
the Ambassadors of strangers was delivered unto me. And the oaths which I have
taken in all our assemblies do bind me never to abandon this cause, and to
employ all the power, understanding, and means which God has given me for the
preservation and subsistence of our Churches both in general and in
particular, and to employ therein whatsoever is most dear unto me. In such
sort that I should now hold my self perjured, and a forsaker of this so holy
and so just a Cause, if I should not by all my travails and means procure the
deliverance of so many poor persecuted Churches, the ordinary complaints and
sighs whereof do interrupt my sleep, waken my conscience, and bind me by so
necessary a duty to all that I am able to do for the easing of them, I join
thereunto the strangers Caution whereof I have spoken; for in regard that all
our Churches have received it with joy and consolation, and have blessed God
that the peace was concluded in that manner, they did not believe that it was a
piece that should be knawne with worms and rotten in a coffer. But that it
should be dearly kept, as the authentical gage of our safety, and as
necessity should bind us to make it of value and force to our advantage, and
to oppose the force of them which have taken this Cause in hand, against the
violence of those which might hereafter iniustly oppress us: and tread
underfoot the promises which were given for our subsistence.

It may seem of some that I should have entered into communication with our
Churches before I should h ue resolved for this negotiation, and to call upon
the King of Great Britain for his promise: But I do not think that men of
good understanding can make so frivolous a scruple. For among the common people
every one knows that there was no sufficient resolution for that, I know that
all men desired it, but I saw no man to at durst attempt it, and I felt my
self bound in conscience, and authorized by the right aforesaid, and I saw
that we could hope for no general assembly, and that all places among us were
filled with spies hired to discover all good actions, and to make them
unprofitable, and I considered that to communicate so ticklish a thing to many,
would be to expose to the wind, and to lose that hope which was yet left us
for our re-establishment, which is the cause that I chose rather to hazard my
self alone, then to neglect the interest of our Churches, or to expose any of
them to the persecution, whererein such a proceeeding being discovered, they
would infallibly have been entangled for ever.

And to show that in this negotiation I have had no other project then may tend
to the good of the Commonwealth, I have therein employed Monsieur de S.
Blancard, whose zeal to the Church of God has been known to all men, whose
integrity without reproach was free from all fraud and deceit, and who has
seasoned the courage which he has shown in all occasions with a singular
prudence, beyond the expectation of his age, in such sort that I having made
use of a man that was so entirely for the public good, and which has so often
exposed his life for the preservation of the liberties which yet remained unto
our Churches, who so honorably ended his life in this quarrel, that the
memory of him shall be for ever a good odor, I cannot be suspected to have
done this this negotiation for any particular ambition.

I will not here stand to make answer to those which say that what evil
soever is done us, we ought not to repulse it by force, notwithstanding any
right or necessity that may seem to authorize our defense, but only oppose
thereunto a gentle patience, and a firm resolution to martyrdom: But I leave
the decision of this question to divines and Lawyers, and will only content my
self to say that such speeches in the mouths of our enemies and of some of
our own are suggested by the passion which they have for our destruction. And
it is an effect of the hire which they have received, or are made to hope for,
experience having taught us to perceive in many, that it is the discourse of
one that is hired, and a forerunner of a declaration of an Apostacy. For the
first, namely our enemies, I find not that strange, that they endeavor to
lulle us asleep, that they may bind us, and put out our eyes, and to impose
the servitude upon us which they have proiected with less peril. For they are
taught by diverse proofs that our resistance making them to partake with us of
the fear and danger, they cannot make an attempt upon our lives without
hazarding of their own, and it is safer and more easy for them to cut our
throats in our beds, or to bring us out of prison to execution, then to force
us in a breach or in a trench, I only wonder at their impudency, all the world
knowing the small account which they make of superior powers established by
God, what leagues they have made, not only to preserve their own Religion and
lives, but to constrain the Sovereign to exterminate the others, not to bind
him to peace, but to force him to an unjust and a barbarous war against his
most affectionate subjects, and faithful servants; so far as to dispossess
him of his Throne, and to protest that they cannot subject themselves to a
Prince which professes a contrary Religion to theirs. For those that are among
us, I suppose that some speak out of weakness, and out of a desire which they
have to see the ancient zeal kindled among us, which they suppose will be
extinguished by the license of arms: But I do imagine also that many are led
thereunto by falsehood and deceit, being people little disposed to do what
they say, and whom an hundredth crowns would make to speak a very different
language. As for me having received the purity of Religion from my fathers. I
do endeavor to imitate their zeal, and to follow their example, which
(praised be Almighty God) has been without reproach: I know right well that
this point has been resolved by excellent Theologians, which be it, in
piety, be in doctrine, those of this age do not surpass: And I believe that
when God will deliver us by humane means, as often times by them he has
restored the exterior condition of his Church, we should not oppose our selves
against this work; but we ought to labor with the instruments of our
deliverance, and to acknowledge in this, above all the blessings of God powered
upon the Saints, and upon the generous labors of our ancestors, that by their
firm and bold resistance, it has pleased the Lord to procure liberty, rest,
and prosperity to his Church.

Therefore the public necessity being stronger then our patience which by
little and little made it self guilty of our destruction, we had our recourse
to the King of Great Britain to obtain, either by his intercession or by his
power that the Edicts made for our subsistence might be observed, and that the
promise which was given us, wherein, his, also was engaged for our liberty,
might not be violated: and that my brother by his presence and his continual
solicitations, had greatly advanced it, Almighty God has given me the grace to
bring it to perfection, by the employment of Monsieur de S. Blancard. For the
King of Great Britain moved with a fervent zeal for the defense of the
Christian faith, and with an incessant desire to see the Church of God out of
oppression throughout all parts of the earth, there being no place, where since
the small time that God has called him to the conduct of his Kingdoms that
this affection has not borne his courage, and employed his forces, has
embraced this Cause with great vigor, not moved thereunto out of any ambitious
desire to intrude upon others, but only out of the compassion, which he has
of our miseries, and the displeasure to see his interuention with so great
indignity contemned, so far forth as that they will make it serve for the
oppression of those whom he desired to relieve; and thereby to add unto his
Crown that rich flower of honor, to be the deliverer of the Churches of this
Kingdom, which by their faith and constancy even in the persecutions have
made themselves to be celebrate throughout the world.

Moreover, he has let us know that to be his only design, to the which he
protests to betake himself with so great firmness, as it has been
religiously confirmed unto me by men of quality, which he has done me the
honor to send unto me, that he would never let go his hold until such time
as that it should plainly appear unto him, that by an entire assurance he
has achieved us a firm repose, and a solid contentment: requiring of us
nothing else but that which the Churches which are in the estate of resistance,
I should do my duty, not only to approve the request which the said
Seignieur de S. Blancard had made unto him in my behalf, in the name of our
Churches; but also to join our selves unto his arms, and not to deport our
selves from the general end, for the respect of any particular accommodation,
and jointly with him to obtain a good, firm, and assured peace, which shall
restore unto all our Churches, at the least part of the prosperity from the
which they are fallen.

And this is the cause wherefore in the name of God I do summon those which
have any remainder of ancient zeal in their hearts, and which hitherto have
sighed, in attending who should come from any part for the deliverance of the
Church of God, and which have always protested, that when they should see any
assured grounds of resistance or of subsistence, they would make it appear
that they had no less affection then the rest for the consolation of so many
poor persecuted flocks, nor show no less resolution to sacrifice all they
have to so holy and so glorious an enterprise.

Therefore the Cause now in hand cannot be said to be unjust; for there was
never any more needful: nor the resolution to enter thereinto rash, having for
our protector a Prince so religious, so faithful, so near a neighbor, and so
powerful: neither is the design impatient, in regard that for the space of a
whole year, we have to small purpose expected to see the persecution to
cease, and the promised things to be observed: nor the execution of this
design criminal, forasmuch as we have no other end but the restitution of
the Churches by the means heretofore used by our Fathers, favored of God, and
authorized by natural and politic right.

As for me, I should for ever feel my conscience charged before God, and mine
honor defaced among men, if having seen so many oppressions upon the Church,
for the which the Son of God has shed his blood and endured death; I should
not seek with all my power and means to ease it, and seeing so great a day of
deliverance to offer it self unto me, if I should not follow and embrace so
opportune a favor, which we may justly say to be sent us from above; and if
I had either through consideration or through delays of slothfulness diuerted
so great a blessing, and refused an occasion so aduantagious to draw us from
the shame and misery wherein we are: confessing freely that I can no longer
live among so many public calamities no more then I can survive after the full
dissipation of the Church, wherewith we see our selves so nearely threatened:
also I believe that all those which hitherto God has preserved by so many of
his powerful maruailes, will not be slack to so laudable a work, and I have
too good an opinion of the courage and zeal of every one, to think that they
would withdraw themselves through impiety, or to destroy it through
perfidiousnesse.

And I assure my self, that time shall make all men to see, that I have not
been moved to this enterprise out of any desire to make my self great, or to
make any profit of the public ruin: For at the same time I see my self
engaged to travails, disturbations, and continual watchings, to be
incessantly stirred with gree es, and exposed to manifest dangers, my family
is constrained to seek by a voluntary banishment among strangers, the repose
which it cannot find with me: and as my expenses increase, my revenues do
diminish. But my conscience does so press me in this Cause, that although I
should be abandoned of all and left alone (which I think will never be) I am
resolved to pursue it until the last drop of my blood, and to the last breath
of my life: and though I should go beg my bread among strange nations, God
will give me the grace to justify unto the world, that I never had other
intent then to sacrifice mine estate, my rest, and my life, and to lay down
all my particular interests, for the deliverance of the Church, without having
any thought which shall tend to the reuolting from the obedience and fidelity
whereunto nature and conscience does bind nice to the King my Sovereign Lord.

And in this case, (if that were all) I do offer, that if the Church might be
re-established in her first prosperity, voluntarily to exile my self from this
Kingdom, and to pass the rest of my life among strangers as a private man,
and to renounce all honor and worldly advantage, and to deprive my self of
the good and repose which I should procure for others, to meditate by my self,
and to celebrate with continual praises the favor which God should show me,
to see yet once again his poor people out of anguish and bondage, and to have
gotten so great honor, to have made my self the instrument of their
deliverance.

FINIS.
