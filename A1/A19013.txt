Pretty Nannie:
OR, A dainty delicate new Ditty, fit for the Contry, Town, or City, which
shows how constant she did prove unto her hearts delight and only Love.
To a dainty delicate new tune named, Northern Nannie.


I Have a Love so fair,
so constant, firm, and kind,
She is without compare,
whose fancies me does blind.
She is the flower of Maids,
that ever was or can be,
Fair Mymphs lend me your ayds
to sing of my sweet Nannie:
Her golden hair, her face so fair,
her glancing eye has wounded me,
Her cheek like show where Roses grow,
Pretty Nanny,
My Mistress of true constancy
I am thine own and shall be.
If Venus would defend,
and grant to grace my bed,
I would not wrong my friend,
by no inticements led:
No not the fairest dame,
shall win her faucur from me,
For in the mind I am,
I Will honor none but Nannie:
For she may command my heart, my hand
my body too for to ride or go,
If she but say by night or day,
Pretty Nannie,
My Mistress of true constancy,
I am thine own and shall be.
My love I will not change
for Craesus gold and treasure,
Nor will I seem to range
from thee my joy and pleasure:
Though some do count our sex
to waver in affection,
Yet do not thou suspect,
for I do hate that action:
My love is set, none shall me let,
nor me persuade, be not afraid,
From thee to turn, I Will rather burn with fire,
Thou plain shall see that I love thee,
And will yield to thy desire.
She is so rare and wise,
and prudent in her carriage,
That gallants did devise
to win her unto marriage:
But she denies all those
that do ask such a question,
And to me she does disclose
her constant true affection:
She will not lie nor falsify,
but true does prove like the turtle-doue
As I do find to me she is kind,
Pretty Nannie,
My Mistress of true constancy,
I am thine own and shall be.
The second part,
To the same tune.


HEr favor and her face,
do set my heart on fire,
When I do her embrace,
I have my hearts desire,
Her pretty lisping tongue,
does joy my heart in speaking,
I think no time too long,
while I with her keep waking:
Her lips so soft I kiss full often,
yet she will deny immodestie,
My mother's come, O I must be gone
Pretty Nannie,
My Mistress of true constancy,
I am thine own and shall be.
When I am from her sight,
my heart is drowned with sorrow,
If I do miss one night,
I see her the next morrow:
She is my only dear,
my joy and my sweet pleasure,
She is a jewel rare,
that far surpasses treasure:
Her glistering eyes like starry skies,
her dimpled chin I have ioyd to see
Her neck so white like christ all bright
Pretty Nannie,
My Mistress of true constancy,
I am thine own and shall be.
For to sell this bargain now
I leave my heart in pawn,
As by a faithful vow,
that is betwixt us twain:
Then do not thou disdain
my Mistress true for to be,
Grant love for love again,
my own sweet pretty Nannie:
And with a kiss be friend me this,
my Love adieu I pray be true,
My heart with faith for ever says
Pretty Nannie, etc.
Then kindly she replide,
thou have thy hearts desire,
I Will be thy lovely Bride,
my love to thee is entire:
As I have constant been,
so I Will remain for ever,
As plainly shall be seen,
from thee I will not sever:
With hand and heart i will take thy part,
in wealth and woe I will do so,
The world shall see that I love thee*
Most kindly,
Thy Mistress, etc.
Though all my friends do frown*
and seem for to prevent me*
Not for a thousand pound,
that I will discontent thee:
I will not yield to love,
nor fancy any other,
My mind shall not remove,
with father nor with mother,
I will not change nor seem to range*
no, I Will endure for ever sure,
My heart is thine and thou art mine*
Sweet honey, etc.
What say thou my sweet heart*
will thou consent unto me?
It Is thou must ease my smart*
or else thou will undo me:
Quoth she I do consent,
to what thou do require*
My self I do present
to please thy hearts desire:
My love on thee shall settled be,
what thou do crave I grant you have
my life, my blood, to do thee go^^*
My honey,
Then do not doubt my constancy,
I am thine own and will be.
FINIS.
