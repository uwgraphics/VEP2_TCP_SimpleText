A letter to the true professors of Christ's Gospel / inhabitinge in the
Parish off Allhallowis / in Bredstrete in London / made by Thomas Sampson /
sometime their Pastore.

2. Corin. 6. We as helpers therefore exhort you / that ye receive not the
grace of God in vain.

Imprynted at Strasburgh in Elsas / at the sign of the golden Bibell / In the
month of Auguste. the year of our LORD. 1554.

The grace and favor of God / our heavenly father / pourchased unto us / by
the blody death of Christ our Savior / befelte and increased in all your
consciences / too your everlasting consolation.
THe violence of this age does not suffer me / my most louinge brethren / to
come (as I would do) unto you / and by talk and brotherly co^ferringe / to
put you in mind of the Gospel of Jesus Christ / which amongeste woothers
far more worthy / even I by Gods grace preached among you. I therefore have
thought nedeful by these letters / now to do the same / now I say / when
though the perverse frowardnes of men / the true preaching of Christ's Gospel
is bannished and man's doctrine is taught with lies and fables: And though
some perchance will think that this longs not to me / but too him that is
your Pastore to do / yet for as much as once I was your pastore / I ca^ not
but testefye / that some piece of pastoral cure does yet rest in my heart
toward you. The which in deed does much persuade me / as the present
necessity also seems no les to require / to make a long and a large treatise
/ by which ye might have an whole armor against all the assaults off false
Prophets. But when I consider / how truly / and that with much diligence ye
have been taught / and therewith thinkinge / that ye are not forgetful hearers
of the word / I think that among you it shall suffice / if I do but name
those greatest euelles / which now are poured forth out of pulpittes among
you / and therewith put you in mind of the truth / contrary to these lies /
which once you both herd and recyeued / desiring you to abide in the same.
This will I do shortly / as I have but littell / and the same unapt time to do
it / yet truly I trust to do it / as let Gods word therein try it. If first
ye will suffer me to tell you / that through these falls Prophets / the
castle of your health / the salvation of your souls is assalted / whom if
ye suffer too be with you if ye yield up your selfs to the beleuinge and
following of their doctrine / then know ye that as by blind lears ye be led
/ so you with them then being blinded / Math. 15.
shall with them fall in to the pit of pardicio^ / which is prepared as well
for the falsely seduced / as for the false seducer. Of this I could be content
to speak the less / but that I se that whylest of to many / and that
Londyners / these beasts befolowed. Ye have even drawn and pulled upon your
heads those abhominacions / which if but reason had ruled / should not have
been admitted before that by laws they had been thrust unto you / that I speak
not / what true Christianity should have moved you too have done.

Oh London / London / An exclamation upon London.
is this the Gospelling fruicte / to be the first / that without a law
should bannish true preaching out of the / too be the first that against
laws shall admit that massinge Idolatry / to be the first that shall give
the example of sto^bling to all England / which should yet have been the
first in constancy / in humble / saying for the continuinge of the truth in
the / in quiet and paciente suffringe for the truths sake even death / if by
the rulers it had been offered the. That ground art thou / which not in
persecucion / but before persecucio^ comes do go back / a ground thou art
reserved for the Lords woeful cures / to whose judgment London I leave the.

Seeing in London these euels are received / as it is now meet for vigilante
Pastors too watch over their flock / to chase the wolf away / les at the
Lords hand they do hear the name of hierlinges / Joan. 10
so now is it high time for you my louinge brethren / and all them that he the
children of God / to take heed whose voice ye do hear / too beware of the
leaven of papisticall Phariseis / and to keep your selfs undefiled from all
their abhominacions. The error of transsubstantiation.
The greatest of which now I will resite among all their abhominacions / one
of the principal is their doctrine of transsubstanciatio^ / the very pride of
papistrie / and the horrible offense / even of the Turckes and Heathen. That a
popish priest / by his hussing and bussinge / and mumblinge up of the words
of Christ / more like a Coniuror then a Christian / should work that
miraculous alteracion and chaunginge of the substance of bread and wine /
into the substance of the body and blood of Christ / which then is to be
taken / as Christ him self God and man / and so to be adored. But you know my
dear brethren / that there is no such miracle too be believed without the
certain doctrine of Gods word to warant the same / which the papists can
never show / and therefore their miracle is not to be believed / Christ in
Instituting the Supper / me^t not to leave there his body and blood really and
substancially as the papists do teach: For Christ in the substance of his
body / was then to be crucified / he was to dye / he was to rise again / he was
to ascend / and he was / and in the same yet now is / to appear before the
glorious God / our Bishop / advocate / and mediator / there so to remain
until the last day / as the schriptures do teach. In the Supper he
instituted a commemoration of the breaking of his body / and sheddinge of his
blood / to be done and made of them that do eat that bread / and drink of
that cup / according to his institution: which he called his body and blood
/ for that it is to the receauers a seal and confirmacion of Christ's body
broken / and Christ's blood shed for them / that the profit and commodity
thereof is theirs / which there do partake by faith. And so these words:
This is my body, and this is my blood, are to be understand / and not as the
transsubsta^ciators / literally enforce them. For their understanding / them is
both contrary to Christus meaning / and also to the office of his body /
besides that it is against the nature of his very body. And that the same phrase
of speakinge is thus to be understood / as I have said: The like phrases in
like matters in the scriptures does sufficiently teache us. As whereof
circumcision / the LORD does say: This is my covenant, where it was but the
seal of the covenant / as Paul calls it. In the same sort it is said:
This is the pasouer. This cup is the new Testament in my blood. Christ is the
rock. And in like manner are these to be understood. So that if the
adversaries will give the / give the holy Ghost leave to expound him self /
then these words. This is my body? This is my blood? are figuratively to be
understood. As the leke Phariseis are / and so serve they not all for their
monstruus transsubstanciation. The sacrifice of the mass.
The second abhominacion is their sacrifice of the mass. In which (too let
many things pass / as the straungenes of the tongue / the Iewesh apparel /
the fond noddes / crosses / beckes and duckes.) Three euels most notable and
to a Christian conscience intolerable are there. First their wicked sacrifice
/ Three abominable euels in the sacrifice off the popish mass.
which their masseboke testefieth / to be Propiciatorie / to take away the
sins of all those / be they dead or living / for whom they do say mass: Yea
/ profitable and availeable for wars / peace / wether / sickness / for
murrain of beasts / and for whatsoever ye lust to bye their appliecacion. Oh
shameful blasphemy. As concerning the sacrifice Propiciatorie for sin / ye
must hold the anchor of your faith that this sacrifice Christ him self once
offered for all in his own bloody death. He was the priest and the sacrifice /
the offerer and the thing offered / and by his own bloody offering purified he
in the shedding of his blood all his from sin. By it purchased he eternal
sanctificacion and salvation for the^ that shall be saved: and by it finished he
for ever / the full propiciacion for sins: Math. 27
for saying these words it is fynished or consummate / he yielded up the
ghost. Detestable therefore is the papisticall sacrifice and ingerous to the
bloody death of Christ.

Christ instituted this supper to be a sacrament to us / and not that of it a
priest should make a propiciatory sacrifice for sin: In the eating and
drinking of it / that we should declare the Lords death / offeringe the
sacrifice of thanks therefore (and therefore is it called of the fathers a
sacrifice of thanks) and not leauinge any more sacrifice propyciatorie for
sin too any priest too offer: Eucharistia
That we eating and drinking / according too his institucion / should by
faith apply unto our consciences / the benefit of his death and passion /
and not geuinge power too any priest by messing too apply the benefit of his
death / to whom and to what he lysteth.

The Lords supper serve not for one dead.
Christ ordained his Supper neither for the dead / which have no use of eating
and drinking with us in the congregation: nor yet for beasts / wether / nor
war / for which Christ did not dre: but for his church liui^g upon this earth /
that needs his word / and needs his Sacraments / for the co^firminge of
their faith.

Thus plainly / ye se one mischeuous misuse in this mass. The second evil is
/ that the bread and cup (which the Lord instituted too be received of the
faythefull with thanks geuinge) In their mass they do abuse / and make of it
an Idol / holding it up for the people / not only to gaze upon / but to give
unto it that honor / which is dew unto God alone: And so both make of it an
Idol / and of the people gross Idolators / and transgressers of Gods
commandment. The fylthines of which Idolatry / I know you do se so plain /
that I need not with many words to impugum it / for a Christian conscience
can not but abhor it. The third euel is that in their mass / that that is
eaten and drounken is done and devoured of the priest all alone / with
quartering and soppinge / with lickinge and suppinge / with wasshing and wyping
/ and such pretty tricks of their own inuenting. Christ in his institucion
apoynteth this supper too he selebrate of the whole co^gregacio^. Math. 26 Mar.
14. Luc. 22.
Take ye, and drynk ye all of this says he: This do ye in remembrance of me.
For so often as ye eat this bread / and drink of this cup ye show the Lords
death till he comes. Christ and Paul speaks not to the priest alone / but
too the whole congregation / too observe this ordinance of eating and
drinkinge at the Lords supper: Whereby ye may plainly se how contrary this
doing of our popish massers is in this also to the Institucion of Christ. The
mass of all Idols most abhorminable.
And too be short in this their whole mass is naught / else but an horrible
prophanacio^ of the Lords supper: Wherefore as a most iniurius blasphemye /
too the blood of Christ / as a most gross Idolatry / as a most wicked
prophanacion of Christ's institucion / of all Christians is this mass to be
eschewed and abhorred.

Out of his mischeuous Idol the mass / form they unto the people / a new
found sacrament of their own inuentinge: delivering to the people (as they
say) through the miracle of their transsubstanciatio^ a body / in which body /
because also there is blood therefore / they do not minister their consecrated
cup accordingly / for fear of spilling and yet they give drink too their
houseled to wash down the cromes withal. Oh thieves where learn ye too
minister such a sacrament. Where have ye your ground in the scripture for this
/ your unwholesome housell. Who can with a good conscii^ce receive such a new
found Popish sacrament at a papists hand / seeing also it is thereto off
them used / to put Christ's true institucion out of his true use. Whose
appointed ordinance is that the bread of thankesgeuing / and the cup of
thankesgeuing should be eaten and droncken of the congregation / as before I
said.

This their new found Sacrament they hang up in the pix / they carrye
abroad in processio^s to be adored / with many such mischiefs of their own
inuentinge / which to reken up / all were an endless labor. The papists
defend their doctrine with manacinge words, with empresoneme^t with fire
and faggot, with axe and halter. The doctrine of justification corrupted of
the papists
I leave them therefore ever listeninge when I may hear them defend these
their abhominacions by the written word off God / but this as they never yet
could do / so shall they never be able to do it / and therefore of all
Christians are they wish their euasyons to be forsaken.

In the doctrine of Iustificacion they wander enwrapped in laberin these
inextricable. They err in extenuating sin both original and actual / in
not understanding the law / the force of it (I mean) nor the end of it / in
making a Justification / partly of Christ's grace / partelye of man's free will
/ good mocyons and good worckes / and herein they so enwrappe them selfs with
their terms of the first grace / Toys for an ape too play with all.
the second grace / grace presidente / grace concomitatinge / grace folowinge
/ with merit of congruence / and merit of condignitie / that neither
understand thee true iustificacion / neither can other men understand what
they do mean by their Justification: But their doctrine is too bring men into
a continual doubting of salvation / and leads them clean from that free
Iustificacion / which we have in Jesus Christ. But you my brethren have out
of the scriptures received / and I trust by the practyses of your own
conscyences have tasted.

That by nature ye are the children of wrath of your selfs: as of your selfs
that ye are but such a lompe of sin / that in you dwells no good thing.
For which the law justly condempneth you as gilty of Gods curse and wrath
/ and so dryueth you too Christ. By whose grace ye be freely justified.

By whose bloudde sheddynge / only and alone / the attonemente is now made
made between God and you / which you believing are made the heirs of blessinge
/ of which your consciences by faith being assured by the work of Gods
spirit / Romans 5.
ye be at peace with God / because ye do feale even in your hearts by liuelye
persuasion off faith / that Christ has loved you / and given him self for you
/ Ephe. 5.
for whose only sake ye are iustefied and saved: Which you thus felinge / are
led by the same spirit that works this in you too render unto God the
sacrifice of your body / in living and doing those works / which in his sight
are acceptable / and that in a fredom and liberty off the spirit / I mean no
fleshely liberty / but that liberty of the spiritie / by which we darre
draw nigh unto the seat of Gods grace / calling him: Abba father / that
liberty that subdueth the liberty of the flesh / and makes it captive and
bond too serve the spirit. In which you also walkinge / when ye have done all
that ye can do / if ye could do all that is commanded you too do / yet saying
all man's righteousness is but as a defiled clothe / ye seek not thereby the
perimplishment of your Iustificacion. Which is all ready fully given you in
Christ's Jesus / ye look not to the merit of your good works: but on your
part knowing your own want and imperfection / Luc. 17.
yea / and sin eue^ in the best ye do / ye say: we are unprofitable
servants commending all your doings to the grace of God through Christ /
that by him they may be made pure: on Gods part considering / that the good
ye do / is the work of his spirit in you / which works in all men / both
to will and to do / ye do give unto him the glory / seeing by his grace only /
ye are that good that ye are. Nevertheless / yet this also ye know that the
Lord / Good works.
which through Christ has accepted you unto his grace / does of the same
grace in Christ / accept these your works into his favor / as just perfect
and good. Which though they be the works of his spirit in you / yet is he
content to have the^ called and esteemed as yours / and as youres does he of
his own fre grace reward the^ both in this life / and in the life to come. In
this that I have thus spoken / you se the force of sin original and actual
/ the force and end of the law / the power of man's free will / the true
justification / ma^s regeneracion / and the life / fruictes and perfection of
Gods regenerate child: By which ye may the more easily perceive how far the
papists wander from the truth of justification / by which they draw men into
a desperate doubting of salvation / which who so likes / let them taste
thereof. Here is occasion also given me to warn you of all those means that
they have taught too be meritorius to deserve Gods grace / as works of
superrogacio^ / works done of a good intent / fish fastes / vows /
pylgrimages / pardons / Conterfa^ts good works.
and such like Popish trashe / which though as yet perchance they dare not
teathe / yet have they taught / and will hereafter teach it. But against all
such / I account you sufficiently armed / if ye hold fast this that our only
merit a valiable before god / is the merit of Christ / which he freely gives
/ and God for his only sake frelye imputes to all true beleuers / which is
unto them full perfyt / and sufficient merit / righteousness / sanctification /
and salvation. The intercession of saints.
They teach also inuocacion of saints / to make them mediators / if not too
God for us / yet unto Christ to speak the better for us.

1. Tim. 2.
The scripture teaches plain / that between God and man / there is but one
mediator / the man Jesus Christ / who therefore became man / that for men he
alone should make intercession / as for man's rede^pcion he alone did dye. Joan.
15
Wherefore even he also teaches me^ to call upon the father in his name /
promising to such that they shall be hard. Prayer abused among the papists
1. Cor. 14


Prayer abuse they not only in a strange tongue / contrary to the doctrine of
Paul / which will have all things done in the congregation / to the edifyeng
thereof: in supersticious numbering of a certain number of Psalms / or Pater
nosters / of which because the people shall be sure / Math. 6
they teach the^ the use of beads / contrary unto which Christ our Savior
taught / condemninge it as a phariseicall supersticion / when for their much
clatering sake / they think them selfs to be hard: Prayenge for the dead
But also they teach and defend prayeng for the dead / to be charitable and
propiciatory. Apoc. 14


Where as yet the scripture teaches / that they that dye in the Lord / are
insolace and blessedness. As then they need not our prayers / so our prayers can
add naught unto their blessedness: Away with ioure purgatorij rakers, and
four masses of Requse^.
And on the contrary part they that dye wickedlye / have no remedy
everlastingly: So that on all parts / this kind of prayer is in vain. The
wother being in most blessed saftie / and with these the time of health and
grace being past / their curious charity therefore / and their peuishe
propiciatorye prayer has no ground in the scriptures. But through this they
have picked the purse of many a poor man / for on this unhappy ground build
they chantries / trentalles vniuersaries / diriges / purgatory / pardons for
souls departed / and a piece of their expiatory sacrifice / with many such
proper devises.

Auriculer confession.
Auriculer confession they teach / in which they enforce a numbering of sins /
which is naught / else but the tyranny of their kingdom / and as they use it a
killing of Christian consciences / and has no ground of the scriptures. In an
anguishe and dute of conscience it is both good / necessary / and comfortable /
for a man to counsel with sum such learned elder / in whose lips does lie
the law of truth. Again / if the true ecclesiastical discipline were used /
a piece of it ought too be / that the man restored / should of his faulie make
an open confession before the congregation / to declare publicquely his
repentance. Yea / and a minister may upon just ground examine any / of whom
he has cure / of such a fault / as he sees him worth to be reproved for: But
this is so far from their eareshrifte / that a man most blind / may easily
judge thereof. Popisshe inuencions.
But the rabble of their errors are to many now to recite / as of the authority
of the church / of the not erring of the church / of discipline / of their
five new enuented sacrament / of voues / of ckoyse of meats / of images / and
such like. Against all / which that ye may be armed my dear brethren / I
require you not only to call to mind the doctrine of the truth received. But
also that for the trial of the^ ye do abide in the word of the truth / Gods
word I mean. And because / here they have also an error / I will but recite
it / and so make an end. Tradicions


Their error is / that Gods written word is not a sufficient doctrine unto
salvation / but (say they) the voice of the church / tradicions / and
counsayles are to be hard of necessity. As for tradicions / there is no
tradicion of any matter of faith to be received / other then is in the
scriptures expressed. Likewise doctors and counsailles / Doctors. Counsails.
Customs. Note.
with the consent and custom of the church / are so far to be hard in
matters of faith / as they do agree with the written scripture: for it is the
touch stone to try them all by / and that in such sort / that if they say
not / according to this word / then as there is no light in them / so are
they not to be followed. Esa. 8.
As for tradicions / customs / Ceremonies
and by and for the order of the church ceremonies received and used / which
be no matters of faith / they may be admitted and altered at the discrecion of
them that have the rule of the church under Christ / according to the
necessite of the time / and the disposition of the people / so that in them be
nothing else but true edifying to unfeigned Godlynes. And such are of the
people with humblines too be received. But for the full trial of such / ^ea /
and for the full and perfect institucion of all men / in such things as
concerning salvation / God has left unto his church and people his written
word. The holy scripture is a sufficient doctrine for our salvation, without
the Popish vnvvritte^ verites. Joan. 20.
In which though all things that God might have caused to be written / be
not written. Yet in it so much is written / as suffices to teach us that
Jesus Christ is the son of God / and also that we believing / might have life
everlasting / as Ihon does witness / by which we learn / that the written
word of God. is a sufficient doctrine to instruct us in that faith / which
brings to life everlasting. It is that sufficient doctrine that can alone
make men learned unto salvation / by the faith which is in Christ Jesus / it
alone suffices to make the man of God perfectly enstructed too all that is
good / as witnesses Paul. 2. Tim. 3 Joan. 5. Luc. 16. 2. Pet. 1.
Therefore unto the scriptures do Christ send the Phariseis / Abraham too
Moses and the Prophets / Peter also to the same word of the Prophets / as to
the doctrine that suffices to enstructe us too salvation. The knowledge of
which word whosoever goes about to take from the people by putting it into
a strange langage to the end that the more safely / our popish merchants
may keep their mart of falshead and Popery / he robs the people of their
mean to salvation / he openith a door for thieves and murderers / to devour
the flock of Christ / and if at the worlds hand / he sustayneth not the
judgment of a thief / yet at Gods hand shall he be sure to have the
judgment of a soul murderer.

Thus briefly I have put you in mind my dear brethren of the principal errors
of the adversaries / and of the truth contrary to them / not so copiously as
the matter deserves / but shortly measuring the neade of your knowledge / for
I have not to do now with the ignorant / but with you / of whom by the time and
kind of your teachinge / I judge that ye be able not only too judge off the
truth / but too be brotherly enstruetors of other in the same. And thus I have
done furst to exorte you constantly to abide in the truth received.
Continuan^e in the truth
Call to your mind that God of his great mercy and goodness has long ben in
planting / sowing / and watering of you / as it were to make you a garden off
pleasure unto him self. These seeds of life the deuel by his doctors will now
go about to pick out of your hearts. But if in this Gospelling adge / ye have
been worthy hearers of the Gospel / if with the word herd with your ears /
the Lords sprite has touched your hearts to believe the word of truth
preached / as he has done to so many as have unfeignedly desired it / Joan. 10
if ye be the sheep / which have rightely herd the shepeherdes voice / then
surely the strangers supplanting voice shall ye not hear / but ye shall flee
from such hurelinges / as from thieves / robbers and murderers. Hereby
verily shall ye be known what ground ye are / fruteful / or unfruitful
constant / or seruers of the time: The property of good gospelers.
Good Gospel hearers be not such as will be tossed about with every wind /
they be no such ground as will be dried up with every blast of bourning heat
/ but they abide in Gods truth / serchinge and learning the same in his holy
scriptures / and that with such faithful diligence and constante obedience /
that if an angel from heaven shall preach an other Gospel / they hold him
accursed: Galat. 1.
Yea / and though there be many counterfaicie Christians / that fall away
from the Lords truth / yet abide they with Christ and say: Joan. 6. Hear
and keep the word off god.
Thou hafte the words of everlasting life: Consider my dear brethren / that
not too hear alone / but to keep Christ's word makes a man happy. And in
kepinge the principal part is too persevere in the doctrine off truth / this
makes Christ's disciples / this makes you free / yea / this is it / that
makes a man safe / for he that perseuereth too the end / shall be saved.

Matthew. 10
This also have I written too exorte you / to keep your selfs undefiled from
all Popish leaven / Note and bevvare.
if ye do fall from the Gospel / and embrace Popery / ye fall from truth to
lies / from the word of light and life / to darkness and death / from
salvation to dampnacion / from God too the deuell. Luce. 11.
Ye are then they / into whom the evil sprete reentreth with seven worse then
him self / ye are then the folishe buylders which suffer the unrecoverable
ruin. And as then with that filth that is in Popery / ye be defiled with it: so
of the dampnacion which is due to such abhominacion / ye shall be partakers
of it. Christ's death and the Popish Mass can not agree together.
But if ye think that ye can both embrace Popery and the Gospel / ye do
disceaue your selfs / for you can not both hold the taste off Christ's
death in your consciences / and allow also that mass / which is the defacer
of Christ's death / you can not embrace the right use of the Lords supper /
and also use and partake the horrible prophanacion of the same: Ye can not by
faith apprehende free iustificacion / and yet seek by your righteousness and
merits too be saved: you can not accept Gods written word / as the
sufficient doctrine of salvation: and alsoo take man's doctrine and tradicions /
as necessary to the same / and so forth of the rest. This can ye not do both
/ they are so contrary.

Serve God according to his word.
But if ye could do it / yet may ye not do it / for God will none of your
ma^geled service / for as there is no co^uenie^ce between Christ and Beliall /
so men must not halte on both sides in Gods service / but either say that God
is God / or else that Baal is god. 2. Cor. 6. 3. Reg. 18
God never allowed that service of the Samaritaines / which both served their
Idols / and worshipped the living God. But if ye be turned to the Lord / then
all strange Gods must ye clean forsake. The Lord is God alone / alone
therefore according to his word will he be served. Exodus 20
God is over man a gelious God / wherefore he will have whole man wholly to be
his alone / as our first commandment teaches us. Again / if you think that
in your hearts ye will serve the Lord / but yet ye will be and may be present
in parson at their Idolatry. Fleshlij pollecie.
For your heart shall be in heaven. This is but a fleshly policy / which fails
as many as trust unto it. The mass is an vvhorish thief.
How can you / too whom Christ's death is dear: abide to se that whorish
thief / that steals from Christ the glory of his death. How can ye / which
have been and are ready to receive with thankefulnes the Lords supper according
to Christ's institucion / abide to se the horrible prophanacion thereof? Heart
and mouth must go together in matters of God.
And so forth of the rest. But if your conscience were such that ye could
thus do / yet know ye this / that it is against your Christian profession.
Romans 10.
For we are taught / that too believe with the heart / and to confess with the
mouth makes a man safe. Both hearts belefe / and mouths confession must go
together / which does not so in you / when inwardly ye are Gospelers / and
outwardly dessemblers with papists. Ye are bought with a price (says Paul)
glorify now God in your body and in your sprite / which are Gods. 1. Cor. 6.
Saying both body an sprite are Gods / not only by creacion / but bought
also by redempcio^ / even in the price of Christ's blood / ye can not with a
dissembling pretense / couple your bodies with papists / for then ye do not
glorify God in your bodies. We read not that any child of God / used ever
iustlye any such dissimulacion. Examples of constanci in gods word. dan.
6.14 Dan. 3.
Daniel used none such and therefore was he sone accused of not adoring the king
/ Bell and the Dragon. The three children / whether they came by co^pulsion / or
came of their own mind / where the Idol was / dissembled not / for forth with
they were accused as transgressors of the kings commandment. Eleazarus would
not dissemble / eating even of lawful flesh. 2. match. 6
These men glorified God in body and sprite / these men believed in heart / and
confessed with the mouth / and so must you do / without any other muysinge / if
ye will do the office off Christians. Of offense geuinge. Note well.
And this to do not only the profession of Christianity enforces / but
Christian cheritie also. Our doings must be without offense geuinge: But by
this dissembling a double stomble block is given which even in things
indifferent is to be avoided. For what though a Christian may eat freely of
meats offered unto Idols / yet if thereby an Idolater / whose conscience in
his supersticion / should be confirmed thereby / it were better never to eat
flesh. And what though al things be clean to the clean to be eaten on all
days with thanks giving / yet better it is not to eat flesh / nor to drink
wine: Romans 14 1. Cor. 8
then too offend thereby thy weak brother: Note ye dissemblinge gospelers.
If this be to be observed in things indifferente / how much more in things
which are absolutely evil / must ye take heed that neither ye give occasion
off concerning the conscience of an Idolatry / nor yet of offending the weke
to draw them to the leeke evil with you: both which ye do / when both a
papist and a weke brother sees you as mingrels myngling your selfs with the
Papists in their Idolatry. As much might I speak / how that all things
that ye do in the congregation must be done to edifyeng. 1. Cor. 14
But of this to have full instruccion. Calvin.
I refer you to the mind off master Calvin / lately translated and printed
in English. Thus now I end wishing you all well in the Lord. Godly
exhortations.
Abide in his truth / keep your selfs undefiled. Offer your selfs humbly to
suffer all violence of blouddye laws for the truths sake / keep safe your
consciences / though the sword takes your lives from you / suffer and bear
withal humblenes and quiet obedience. Humble your selfs in unfeigned
repentance before the Lord / in the horrible plague of Popery / that of his
mercy he may be moved to end these days of delusion / and let your prayers
always ascend up before the Lord / begginge of him such things as ye need.
In which I beseech you to pray also for me.

Your louinge friend and orator. Thomas Sampson.

The grace of our LORD Jesus Christ be with you all. AMEN.
