wishes the perpetual comfort and increase of the holy Spirit, to the end of
their battle.
IT is not unknown to some of you (dear brethren in the Lord) that for your
sake chifly I took pains, first to gather this brief Sum: Therefore willing
now to set it out and make it common to others: I thought good to recommend the
same to you again in special, as a token of my good will toward you all, and
as a memorial of my doctrine, and earnest labors, bestowed among you, and
upon that country, for the space of six years. Wherefore desiring to hear
of your profit, and fruits of my labors, I can not, but of very love and
duty, exhort you not only to take this my labor in good part: but also to
use it aright, least it be a witness against you in the day of the Lord. It
shall be very comfortable and fruitful to you, if ye cause this short sum to
be often and diligently read in your houses: for hereby ye your selves, your
children, and servants, may profit more and more, in the principal points of
your salvation. What need ye have of this continual exercise in your houses,
ye know your selves, and I by experience, can bear witness, of the great and
gross ignorance of some among you: notwithstanding the clear light of the
gospel of long now shining there. In handling this matter, I have studied to
my power, to be plain, simple, short, and profitable, not looking so much to
the desire and satisfaction of the learned, as to the instruction and help of
the ignorant. For first, I have absteyned from al curious and hard questions,
and next I have brought the question and the answer to as few words as I
could, and that for the ease of children and common people, who can not
understand nor gather the substance of a long question, or a long answer
consirmed with many reasons. And yet if any will exercise their household in
the common Catechism, (the which thing I exhort all men to do) this my labor
can not hurt, but rather it shall be a great help to them, seeing I both
gather the substance of the whole Catechism in few words, and also follow
the same order, except a little in the beginning and in the end, where certain
things are added, which all men (I hope) shall judge to be very profitable,
and necessary to be known. There are also some questions and answers
interlaced in sundry places, but chiefly in the matter of the Sacraments,
which serve greatly to the right understanding of the matter in hand. But if
men will be both weary to learn the common Catechism, and also this brief
Sum: I can not understand, what good they will have to know the right way of
their salvation. For certain and sure it is, that the reading or rehearsing (by
word) of the Belief, the Lords prayer, the Law, and number of the holy
Sacraments, can profit nothing to salvation, without the right understanding
and lively application of the same to our selves in particular: in the which
only does the true Christian faith consist. Wherefore I marvel greatly of the
brutishnes of many, who do glory in Faith, and yet neither have they
knowledge, nor feeling of the principal heads of our Christian says, as
their answers do testify, when they are brought to any public examination.
But albeit the great multitud perish in their wilful ignorance, yet (I hope
some shall profit by this my labor, taken for the Church of God, of the which
I judge you to be a part. Therefore take heed to your selves, and suffer no
others to go before you in this spiritual exercise: for great dishonor it
shall be to you, if others shall profit more by this brief sum, then ye, seeing
for your cause it was first written, taught among you: and now lastly under
your name come to the knowledge of others. Be not of those men to whom all
kind of good doctrine is either hard and obscure, or else over base and common:
for as the one has no will to learn, even so the other would be fed with
some curiosity or new doctrine. If any shall complain of my obscurity in
these short answers, let him consider how hard a thing it is, to be both
short and plain, or yet to satisfy all men's desire and judgment in lighter
matters, then this is. Always if days be granted, I mind with the help of
God, to make this sum more ample, and more plain, if the brethren shall
judge it needful. In this mean time, I desire all men to take this my
travail in good part, and use it to the edification of the Church, and glory
of our God. To whom be all honor and praise, for ever and ever.

Amen.
At EDENBVRGH, the xx. of July, in the year. 1581.
To the Reader.
MEruell not (gentle Reader) that I allege no authority of the Scriptures,
nor fathers, for the confirmation of this doctrine: seeing my purpose is not so
much to instruct our profane Atheistes and Apostates, as to put our brethren
in memory of that doctrine, which they daily here confirmed (in our ordinary
teaching) by the scriptures and consent of the godly Fathers.

Always if either the brethren, or other would have further confirmation of
this doctrine, let the^ read the Institution of M. John Calum, and other godly
men, who have written abundantly for the defense of this doctrine, according
to the scriptures of God. I doubt not, but good men, and such as are persuaded
of the truth, will take this mine excuse in the best part, and give thanks to
God for my labor, taken for their comfort. But as for the godles band of
Atheistes and Apostates whom God has ordained to destruction, I care not what
they shall judge of this my simple writing, and pains taken for the
instruction of the ignorant. I would marvel greatly of the success of our
doctrine, which is now impugned and pursued by men, (to the sight of the world)
of great estimation and judgment, if the same had not come to pass to the
Prophets and Apostles in their age, whose doctrine and religion was most faisty
impugned, and cruelly persecuted by the Sons of perdition. Of this we are
forwarned by the Apostles, that men, after the witnessing of the truth, shall
depart to their vomit again and become Traitoures and persecutors of Gods
truth, which they professed before with us. When we see this fiery trial and
fearful judgment in the Church, let us examine our selves be time, and call
to God for constancy in the truth, and praise his justice in the blinding of
those, that in so great a light, willingly and maliciously, delight in
darkness and blaspheme the way of righteousenesse. Of this sort are sundry
of our nation, whose blasphemous writings come daily to our hands, to the
trial of our faith and constancy, to the farther blinding of the reprobate,
and their greater condemnation in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. To whom
with the Father and the holy Spirit, be all honor and praise eternally.

Amen.

Q. Why then are the Elements called his body and blood?

A. Because they are sure seals of his body and blood given to us.

Christ's natural body is received.
Q. Then we receive only the tokens, and not his body?

A. We receive his very substantial body and blood, by faith.

Q. How can that be proved?

A. By the truth of his word, and nature of a Sacrament.

the discipline.

A. We should try their sayings by the tokens of the true Church.

Q. What are these tokens or marks?

A. The word, the Sacraments, and discipline rightly used.

Q. What if no order of discipline be among them?

A. Then we should remain with the word and Sacraments.

Q. But what if both the word and Sacrament^ be corrupted?

A. Then we should not join our selves with that company.

Q. But what if they retain the name of the true Church?

A. So did Satan cloth him self with the Angel ^or. 11. 14
of light, for the further blinding of the world.

Q. But what shall men do, when they know not another Church?

A. Let them content them selves with true faith in Christ.

Q. But then they are diuyded from the Church

A. Not from the true Church, and body of Christ.

Q. How can that be proved?

A. Thus, all that are united with Christ, are joined with the Church.

with all the Saints of God, because we are joined first with God in Christ,

Q. But many are never raised again.

A. These were never of the chosen of God.

Q. Yet both they and the Church believed otherwise.

Q. Then Faieh is not certain.

A. True faith is ever certain to the believers

Q. What certainty has every one of his faith?

A. The testimony of the spirit of adoption Romans ^
with the fruits.

Q. But many glory in this testimony in vain.

A. Yet this testimony is most sure and certain.

Q. Why then are so many deceived by this way?

A. Because they glory in* a faith without fruits.

Q. How may we eschew this danger?

A. By the right trial of our adoption. (...)es. 2. 16. (...)8. and.


The trial of our adoption.
Q. Where should we begin our trial?

A. At the fruits of faith and repentance. Because they are best known to our
selves and others.

Q. What if we begin at election?

A. Then we shall wander in darkness.

Q. But Gods election is most clear and certain.

A. It is clear and certain in it self, but it is not always certain to us

Q. But this exact trial has brought some to desperation.

A. Yet Gods elect are always sustained, and finally comforted.

conscience.

more abundantly.

A short and general confession of the true Christian faith and religion,
according to Gods word, and acts of our Parliaments, subscribed by the kings M.
and his household, with sundry others, to the glory of God, and good example
of all men. At Edinburgh, the xx. of lanuarie. 1180. and the 14. year of his
reign. ()
We al, and every one of us under written, protest that after long and due
examination of our own consciences, in matters of true and false religion, are
now thoroughly re^^lued in the truth by the word and spirit of god. And
therefore we believe with our hearts, confess with our mouths, and subscribe
with our hands, and constantly affirm before God and the whole world, that
this is only the true Christian faith, and religion, pleasing God, and
bringing salvation to man, which is now by the mercy of God reueiled to the
world, by the preaching of the blessed Gospel, and is received, believed, and
defended by many and sundry notable Churches, and Realms, but chiefly by the
Church of Scotland, the Kings M. and three Estates of this Realm, as Gods
eternal truth, and only ground of our salvation, as more particulerly is
expressed in the confession of our faith, established and publicly confirmed
by sundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time has bin openly
professed by the Kings M. and whole body of this Realm, both in City and
Country.

To the which confession and form of religion, we willingly agree in our
consciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted truth and verity, grounded
only upon his written word. And therefore we abhor and detest all contrary
religion and doctrine: but chiefly all kind of Papistrie in general, and
particular, even as they are now damned and confuted by the word of GOD, and
Church of Scotland. usurped authority of the Roman Antychriste over the
Scriptures of GOD, over the Church, the civil magistrates, and consciences of
men: all his tyrannous laws, made upon indifferent things against our
Christian liberty: his erroneous doctrine against the sufficiency of the
written word: the perfection of the law, the office of Christ, and his
blessed Gospel, his corrupted doctrine concerning original sin, our
natural inhabilitie, and rebellion to Gods law, his blasphemy against our
justification by faith only, our imperfect sanctification, and obedience to
the law: the nature, number, and use of the holy Sacraments.

We detest his five bastard sacraments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and
false doctrine, added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without the
word of God, his cruel judgment against infants departing without the
Sacrament, his absolute necessity of Baptism, his blasphemous opinion of
transubstantiation, or real presence of Christ's body in the Sacrament, and
receiving of the same by the wicked, or bodies of men, his dispensations with
solemned oaths, periuries, and degrees of marriage forbidden in the word: his
cruelty against the innocent deuorced.

We abhor his devilish Mass, his blasphemous Priesthood, his profane
sacrifice for the sins of the dead and the quick, his canonyzation of men
and women saints, calling upon angels, or saints departed, worshipping of
imagerie, relics, crosses, dedicating of Churches, alters, days, vows to
creatures, his purgatory, prayer for the dead, praying or speaking in a strange
language, his processions, and blasphemous letany, his multitude of advocates,
or mediators, with his manifold orders, and auricular confession, his desperate
and uncertain repentance, his general and doubting faith, his satisfactions
of men for their sins, his justification by works, his Opus operatum, works
of supererogation, merits, pardons, peregrinations and stations.

We detest his profane holy water, Baptising of bells, coniuring of spirits,
crossing, fayning, anointing, coniuring, his hallowing of Gods good creatures,
with the supestitious opinion, joined therewith, his worldly Monarchy, and
wicked Hierarchy, his three solemned vows, with all his shauelings of su^drie
sorts, his erroneous and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the
subscribers and approuers of that cruel and bloody band, coniured against the
Church of God. And finallye we detest all his vain allegories, rites, signs,
and traditions brought in the Church, without, or against the word of God, and
doctrine of this reformed Church.

To the which we join our selves willingly in doctrine, faith, religion,
discipline, and use of the holy Sacraments, as lively members of ye same with
Christ our head, promising and swearing by the great name of ye Lord, that we
shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Church,
and shall defend ye same, according to our vocation, and power, all the days
of our lives, under the pains contained in the law, and danger, both of body
and soul, in the day of Gods fearful judgment.

And seeing that many are stirred up by Satan and the Roman Antichrist, to
promise, swear, subscribe, and for a time use the holy Sacraments in the
Church deceitfully against their own conscience, minding hereby first under
the eternal cloak of religion to corrupt and subvert secretly Gods true
religion within the church, and afterward, when time may serve, to become open
enemies and persecutours of the same, under vain hope of the Popes
dispensation, devised against the word of God, to his greater confusion, and
their double condemnation in the day of the Lord Jesus. We therefore willing to
take away all suspicion of hypocrisy, and of such double dealing with God and
his church, protest, and call the searcher of all hearts for witness, that our
minds and hearts do fully agree with this our confession, promise, oath, and
subscription, so that we are not moved for any worldly respect, but are
persuaded only in our consciences through the knowledge and love of Gods true
religion imprinted in our hearts by the holy spirit, as we shall answer to
him in the day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed.

And because we perceive, that the quietness and stabilitie of our religion and
Church both depend upon the safety, and good behavior of the Kings Majesty,
as upon a comfortable instrument of Gods mercy, granted to this Country, for
the maintaining of his Church, and ministration of justice among us. We protest
and promise with our hearts, under the same oath, handwritte and pains, that we
shall defend his person, and authority, with our bodies and lives, in the
defense of Christ's Gospel, liberty of our Country, administration of
justice, and punishment of iniquity against all enymies within this Realm, or
without, as we desire our God to be a strong and merciful defender to us in
the day of our death, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. To whom with the
father and the holy spirit be all honor and glory eternally.

Amen.
The names of all the subscribers contained in the principal copy, written in
parchment, and kept in the hands of the Ministers.

The Kings M. charge to all the commissioners and Ministers within this Realm.
Seeing that we and our household have subscribed, and given this public
confession of our faith, to the good example of our subjects: We command and
charge al Commissioners and Ministers, to crave the same confession of their
Parishioners, and to proceed against the refusers, according to our laws, and
order of the Church, delivering their names, and lawful process to the
Ministers of our house, with all have and diligence, under the pain of xl.
pounds, to be taken from their stipends: that we with the advice of our
Council, may take order with such proud contemners of God and our laws,

subscribed with our hand. At Holirudhouse, the xi. day of March 1580. The 14
year of our reign.
I Thought good to add for the better confirmation of this confession, the
judgment of the ancient and Godly Fathers, concerning the authority of the
holy scriptures, upon the which only they grounded their faith and religion,
and by the same only confuted and condemned all contrary doctrine and
religion, in their time, as their writings do testify to us. And next I lay
down the open and shameless blasphemies of the late Papists spued out, and
written in contempt of the holy scriptures, and praise of men's traditions above
the word of God, the which traditions they reverence equally with the
Scriptures, as it shall appear by their own words.

The godly Fathers.
Irenaeus lib. 3. cap. 8. THe Apostles have put in writing the things, that
were to be the foundation and pillar of our faith.

Idem Cap. 11. The pillar and groundworke of the Church, is the Gospel, and
the spirit of life.

Origenes, lib. 1. cap. 17. in Epist. ad Roman. Out of the scriptures only our
interpretations should be taken.

Idem in prim. Hieremie. Our judgments and expositions have no credit without
the testimony of the scriptures.

Idem Homil. 25. in Matthew. For confirmation of all those words we speak in
our teaching, we should first allege the judgment of the Scripture, as a
confirmation of that thing we declare unto you.

Ciprianus, de Baptismo Christi. Out of the scriptures must come all rule of
teaching.

Basilius, epist. 8. The scripture is a perfect rule and line, and admits no
addition.

Idem, ibidem. Let us stand to the judgment of the scripture, inspired by God,
and let the sentence of truth be given to them, whose doctrine is agreeable to
the heavenly oracles.

Cyrillus in Johan. lib. 12. All things, that our Lord did, are not written,
but the Apostles wrote the things, they judged to be sufficient for our manners
and doctrine.

Basilius, de vera Fide. It is pride, to reject any thing the Apostles have
written, or to add any thing to their writings, and bring in things not
written.

Theophilus, epist. 9. cap. vlt. They that offer any thing, except the doctrine
of the Apostles, they bring in slanders, heresies, and dissentions.

Ambrosius. We justly damn all new things, which Christ did not teach,
because Christ is the way to the faithful.

Idem, primo officiorum. Things that we find not in the scripture, we may
use as we please.

Hieronimus, Psalm. 86. Take heed what they say that were, and not that are now:
for whatsoever thing is spoken without the doctrine of the Apostles, let it be
put away, and have no authority.

Idem in Aggaeum. The word is Gods sword wherewith all these things are cut
off, which without the testimony and authority of the Scriptures men of their
own head do invent and feign, as traditions of the Apostles.

Chrisostomus, opere imperfecto. Homil. 49. In no way can the true Church of
Christ be known, but by the scriptures only.

Idem, in sancto and adorando Spiritu. If any thing be obtruded without the
Gospel, under the title of the spirit, let us not believe it.

Idem, opere imperfecto, Homil. 49. We should in no case give credit to the
Church, except they speak and do the things, that are consonant to the
Scriptures.

Augustinus, de vnitate Ecclesiae, cap. 2. The Scripture does show Christ in
the Church.

Idem in Johan. tract. 96. When the Lord has not revealed these things, which
of us can say: these, or these things are: and if any man will affirm this, or
that to be, how does he prove it?

Idem. de Pastoribus cap. 14. I enquire at the voice of the Pastor, to read
me it out of the Prophet, read it out of the Psalm, recite it out of the law,
recite it out of the Gospel, recite it out of the Apostle.

Ibidem, lib. 2. cap. 85. contraliteras Petiliani. Whether we are Schismatikes,
or ye, neither I, nor thou shall be judge, but let Christ be demanded, that he
may show his own Church.

Tertullianus, de praescriptione contra haereticos. The Heretics deny, that
Christ and the Apostles revealed all things to all, but some thing openly, some
thing secretly.

Athanatius orat. 2. contra haereticos, Does testify, that the Arrians glorted
in revelations and in the spirit without the word.

Augustinus, de natura and gratia. 61. I am bound to give consent, only to the
canonical Scriptures, without any excuse.

Epiphanius. lib. 1. Haeresi. 38. Affirms, that Caiani an Heretic, said,
that they received their errors, by traditions without the Scriptures.

Irenaus, lib. 3. cap. 2. The Heretics when they are rebuked by the
Scriptures, they turn to the accusation of the Scriptures, as if they were
corrupt, or had not authority, and that they are spoken sundry ways, and
that the truth cannot be found by them, if we want the traditions.

1. Leo, Epist. 83. ad Palest. Ye are armed with the name of the Church, and
therewith do fight against the Church.

Cyprianus, de simplicitate Prelatorum. The devil has found a new deceit,
that under the title of Christian people, he may deceive them that are not
wary and heedfull.

Augustinus de sermon Domini in monte. The sheep should not cast away her
skin, because wolves and todes sometimes hide them selves under it.

Papists acknowledge here your own words, against the Scriptures, agreeable to
the old heretics your fathers.

THis was the doctrine of the Fathers, and Faith of the Church, for the space
of 500. years, after the assension of Christ. The which doctrine and faith,
did piece by piece decay, as the Roman Antichrist did grow to his high
estimation, where through the true handling of the Scriptures was altogether
neglected, and his traditions placed in their room, and so the Pope with his
creatures were placed above the Scriptures, to make Scriptures lawful, or
unlawful, and to be the only Judge of all interpretations, and their sentence
to be without all error, and so all men bound to it, without any
contradictions, as the histories of the Church do plainly declare, but chiefly
the blood of the Saints of God shed for the defense of this doctrine of the
Fathers against their errors.

Wherefore I desire the diligent Reader, to mark these blasphemies following,
which the slaves of that pestilent seat have spued out against the scriptures
of God, the Fathers judgment, and the confession of the primitine Church.

The second Head, concerning the blasphemies of the Papists, against the word
of God.
Cusanus Cardinal Epist. 2. ad Bohemos. THe scriptures must follow the church,
and not the church the scriptures.

Idem. Ibidem. I say, the precepts of Christ are of no strength, except the
church admit them for such.

Hosius Cardinalis, de expresso verbo Dei. It is vain labor that is spent
upon the scriptures, we will rather wait for Gods sentence out of heaven.

Idem, Ibidem. What the Church does teach, that is the express word of god,
what is taught against the mind and consent of it, is the express word of the
Devil.

Idem, Ibidem. If a man have the interpretation of the Church of Rome, albeit
he sees not how it agrees, or disagreeth with the text, this man has the
very express word of God.

Eckius, multis in locis, The scripture is the black Gospel, and divinity of
Inck.

Herwaeus, de potestate Papae, The Pope is the whole Church in power.

Uerractus, The determination of the church is called the Gospel.

Piggius, de caelesti Hierarchia. The Church has power to give to some
Scriptures a canonical authority, which they neither have of them selves, nor
yet of their authors.

Idem, Ibidem, The scriptures are like a nose of wax, which may be turned in
what shape and form thou please to form and draw it.

Idem, Ibidem, The Apostles wrote some things, not that these writings should
be superiors to our faith, but rather that our faith should be superior to
them.

NOw let all men judge, what spirit moved these godless writers, to
blaspheme the Scriptures of God so shamefully. But some will say, they were
private men, and not the Pope: nor his Council. I answer: They were gladly
heard, authorized, and well rewarded by the Pope and his corrupted Synagogue.
And Io. Hus, Hiero. de Praga, with sundry others of our brethren cruelly were
persecuted with fire and sword, for speaking against their blasphemies.

It is true, the late Council of Trent would appear to judge more reverently
of the Scriptures, when they hid their venom under some fair and general
terms. But which of them was offended when they heard the Bishop of Poytiers
in his exhortation call the Scriptures, a void and dumb law, etc? And
likewise, who accused the profane Priest of Laterane, which in all their
presence, called the Scriptures dead Luke etc?

Andradius writing in the defense of that profane Council, does plainlye
testify, that they in their minds did thoroughly agree with these blasphemies,
but yet durst not speak so plainly against the Scriptures, least they should
have provoked the common people against them.

And therefore to bleare the eyes of the people for a time, they join the
Scriptures and their unwritten traditions together in their Decrees.

But in the mean time, they arm and send out certain vile slaves, and
godless runnegates to speak and write against the written word, who do call
it a dead Letter, obscure, uncertain, insufficient, the occasion of all
heresies, written without the commandment of Christ, and unprofitable to the
people laboring hereby to bring the consciences of men from the word of life
to their devilish traditions.

Let all men therefore that love the truth of God, flee far from this
deceitful and devilish company, which God in his wrath has raised up to
blind this unthankful age, and to try our faith and patience, unto the time
of our full victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. To whom with the Father
and the holy Spirit, be all honor, praise, and Majesty, for ever and ever. So
be it.

FINIS.
