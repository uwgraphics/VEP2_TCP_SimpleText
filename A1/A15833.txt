MVSICA TRANSALPINA.

CANTVS. THE SECOND BOOK OF Madrigalles, to 5. and 6. voices: translated out
of sundry Jtalian Authors and NEWLY PVBLISHED BY NICOLAS YOUNG.

AT LONDON Printed by Thomas Este. 1597.

To the Right Worshipful and True lover of Music, Sir Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
NO one science draws nearer to the essence of God, then this of Music.
(For as God is altogether unity: So is Music proportionably an harmoniacall
unity.) No man favors men of that quality beyond your self. To no man am I
more deeply beholding then to your good self. Lo then; In all these respects,
and without all further ceremony, I here present to your good judgment this
second Book of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well upon the gracious acceptance
of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry civil Gentlemen, and
Merchants of good sort) I have carefully culled out of the Compositions of the
best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speak not English so well as they sing
Italian. And (alas) how cold they, being as yet but late soiourners in
England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your self principally, and in your name all
others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with
friendly interpretation. And so, humbly bowing my self, I rest.

At your devotion wholly and ever Nicolas Young.

MVSICA TRANSALPINA.

TENOR. THE SECOND BOOK OF Madrigalles, to 5. and 6. voices: translated out of
sundry Jtalian Authors and NEWLY PVBLISHED BY NICHOLAS YOUNG.

AT LONDON Printed by Thomas Este. 1597.

To the Right Worshipful and True lover of Music, Sir Henry Lennard KNIGHT.
NO one science draws nearer to the essence of God, then this of Music.
(For as God is altogether unity: So is Music proportionably an harmoniacall
unity.) No man favors men of that quality beyond your self. To no man am I
more deeply beholding then to your good self. Lo then; In all these respects,
and without all further ceremony, I here present to your good judgment this
second Book of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well upon the gracious acceptance
of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry civil Gentlemen, and
Merchants of good sort) I have carefully culled out of the Compositions of the
best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speak not English so well as they sing
Italian. And (alas) how cold they, being as yet but late soiourners in
England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your self principally, and in your name all
others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with
friendly interpretation. And so, humbly bowing my self, I rest.

At your devotion wholly and ever Nicolas Young.

NO one science draws nearer to the essence of God, then this of Music.
(For as God is altogether unity: So is Music proportionably an harmoniacall
unity.) No man favors men of that quality beyond your self. To no man am I

second Book of MVSICA TRANSALPINA. Which (as well upon the gracious acceptance
of my first one,) As also the encouragement of sundry civil Gentlemen, and
Merchants of good sort) I have carefully called out of the Compositions of the
best Authors in Italy. Perhaps they speak not English so well as they sing
Italian. And (alas) how cold they, being as yet but late soiourners in
England? Howbeeit I humbly desire, your self principally, and in your name all
others for whose delight they were intended, to supply their defects with
friendly interpretation. And so, humbly bowing my self, I rest.
