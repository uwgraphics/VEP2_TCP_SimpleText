Take Time, while Time is: Being an Exhortation to all sorts or Sexes, of what
Degree soever, from the Highest to the Lowest, Old or Young, Rich or Poor.
To the Tune of, The Ladies Daughter of Paris.


OH stay a while you lusty Lads,
that seem to skip and mount,
From me your aged Patron,
although you make no count
Of Father, Mother* kith or kin,
what ever they d^t say,
You snuff and snort when they correct,
you fly and will not stay.
Oh stay, I say, and learn of me
a Lesson by the way:
You are unfit for any use,
seeing you will not obey.
Behold, I say, the Picture now
that here does stand above,
And be you warned by what I say,
if that your selves you love.
To you he offers now himself,
until your thread be spun;
But as he offers, steals away
until your thread be done.
Lay hold on him therefore, I say,
and say, I warned anew,
Lest that be steal away from you,
and bid you so adieu.
For Time does stay here for no man,
be it King, be it Prince, be it Peer;
He leaves them to what life they will,
be it joy, be it love, be it fear:
Be It life or death, I say, or ought
that blind Fate does ordain,
As some in bed asleep we see,
and some in field are slain.
His Glass that in his hand he holds
does cut off all delay,
His Wings that on his back do stick,
do show he cannot stay
For any that comes after him,
be he swarthy or fair;
But he must come and stand before,
and take hold of his hair:
And when that you have hold of it,
in no case let it go;
For having once forsook him quite,
your footsteps are too slow
For to lay hold on him again,
when once that he is past,
(...) favors, you must think,
with you will not always last*
The second Part, To the same tune.


THe Dyall fixed upon his Head,
most evident does show,
How fleeting is this mortal life,
and Time does always go,
Although we not perceive it move,
old age does come at last,
And brings diseases on us all,
our lives are but a blast.
His Sithe within the other hand,
does show how he cuts down
The lives of all, from great to small,
from Cottage to the Crown:
We are like grass which soon does fade,
and withers in an hour,
When Time is past, grim Death does come,
and feazeth with his power.
The Flowers like to Youthfulness,
is fragrant, sweet, and fair,
But soon is plucked, and vanished,
as is the smoke in air;
The swift winged Swallow shows us plain
how Time does fleet away,
We Summer have, and Winter eke,
and Time for none will stay.
What though thy Father he be rich,
and thou be young in years,
Think then that God has no means left
to blast thy Fathers ears
Of Corn, or Cattle, or what else
that does maintain his fame?
Yea, God has means enough in store
for to confound the same.
But oh, the mighty number now,
that in this Land there be,
That do go up to brave London,
out of their own Country,
And there to sport, and play their fill,
they make it all their joy:
Their careful Parents counsels all,
they make of them a toy.
But if thou followst on this life,
and mean therein to lie,
Thou shall be barred from Gods bliss,
and damned eternally.
But be thou ruled by thy friends
when Counsel they thee give,
And God shall prosper all thy ways,
that thou long days may live.
Make much of Time therefore, I say,
before that thou be old,
Lest that he tell thee to thy teeth,
that thou art too too bold,
To trust unto this winged man
that stieth on so fast:
For if thou car'st not what I say,
Repentance comes at last.
But now to make an end with you,
hoping you know my mind,
Concerning this same Picture here,
that I have so defined:
If that you mark it well, I say,
and what therein is meant,
I hope you will turn your bias round,
and of the same repent.
And let us pray unto our God,
to bless our sovereign King,
Under whose happy government,
we enjoy every thing
That God even of his mercy gives,
and down upon us sends:
He grant we may be thankful still,
and send us blessed ends.
FINIS.

the Gate.
