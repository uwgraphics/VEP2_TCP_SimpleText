experiences, and perfect knowledge of Navigations, for all Coasts and
Countries: most needful and necessary for all Seafaring men and Travelers,

Bourne.



Imprinted at London by Thomas Hacket, and are to be sold at his shop in the
Royal Exchange, at the Sign of the Green Dragon.



TO THE RIGHT Honorable, Edward Earl of Lincoln, Baron of Clinton and Say,
Knight of the Noble order of the Garter, Lord high Admiral of England,
Irelande, and Wales, and of the Dominions and Isles thereof, of the Town of
Calice, and Marches of the same, Normandy, Gascoygne and Guyone, and Captain
general of the Queens Majesty's Seas and Navy Royal: William Bourne wishes
increase of honor in perfect health.
Right honorable and my singular good Lord and Master, when I had often
repeated and called to my remembrance the opinion and sayings of the sage and
ancient VVriters, that one man should be an instructor to an other, by seeking
and pains taking to do them good: so at sundry times have I studied and
devised with my self what thing to take in ^^nde that might most profit my
friends, and my (...) country: and at the length it came unto my remembrance
how necessary a thing it was for Seafaring men to have some good
instructions, whereupon I have written this base and simple Regiment for the
Sea, and Rules of Navigations, for that I know it to be so needful and
necessary for all sorts of Sea men. Therefore at sundry times as I have had
leisure, I have compyled and written this base and simple work, calling to
remembrance the saying of Pliny, who thought all that time lost which he
did not bestow at his book: I being of all other most simple, yet
notvvithstanding this enterprise have I taken in hand, to publishe this simple
book unto all men. And for that, all my labors be due unto your Honorable
Lordship, according to my bounden duty I prefer it unto your Honor, hoping
that your Lordship will voutchsafe to take it in good part, and to receive
this barbarous work, more to take it as my good will (vvhiches is to offer
things of much more excellency) than the finenesse of the work, for that it
is but simple. AAnd so shall I not only be satisfied, but also further
encouraged heereafeer to travel, according to the simple gift and talent that
God has given unto me: for that it is not altogether gathered out of other
books, but that the greatest part is devised and practiced by me. Therefore I
trust my labors (such as they be) shall not hinder the cunning and learned
sort, but further the late beginners that are as yet not well instructed. And
thus I cease to trouble your honorable Lordeship any longer, desiring you to
take this simple thing in good part, as a true token and sign of my good
will, beseeching God of his grace to prosper your Lordship in honor and
virtue, with perfect health. Amen.

By your Honors poor servant William Bourne.

The Preface to the Reader.
IN my opinion (gentle Reader) which also is the saying and writing of all the
Philosophers, those things are most principally to be taught and maynteined,
which in the common wealth are most profitable and necessary. Then may I
boldly say (without just cause of reproof) and affirm, that Navigations is
not the least but one of the principal matters to be known, as this time does
require: Considering the state and situation of our country, for that we be
environed round about with the Sea, so that we neither can go out of our
country, neither they that are of other countries can come at us, but only by
Sea. These things (I say) considered, what can there be more necessary to be
taught in our common wealth than Navigations, considering also what Navigations
is: as Navigations is how to direct ones course upon or through the sea, where he
finds no path to any place assigned, and how to attain the port or place
appointed in shortest time, how also to preserve the ship and goods in all
common disturbances, as storms, dangers by the way, and such other like etc.
Moreover and besides that, it is not unknown how necessary Navigations is,
both for the transportation of our commodities, to find vent for them in other
countries (whereby no small number of people is set a work in England) and
also the bringing of other commodities (that we have need of) unto us, by
which means the Queens Majesty receives no small benefit for her customs.
etc. And furthermore, for that Navigations is the chief force and strength of
our country, which whether it be true I refer to the judgment of all men,
and although I be but simple (gentle Reader) and a great number of excellent
learned men in the Mathematical Science have written diverse books of
Cosmographie and Navigations, yet notwithstanding I have written this Regiment
for the Sea with a few rules of Navigations, as it were a nosegay whose flowers
are of mine own gathering. And albeit the learned sort of Seafaring men have
no need of this book, yet am I assured that it is a necessary book for the
simplest sort of Seafaring men: for that they shall find here the names of the
circles in the sphere, with the names of diverse things meet for Navigations,
together with their uses, which the most part of Sea men do mistake or miss
call: neither do they know the use of them being yet most necessary for them
that use Navigations, in which also there is a table of declination calculated
for.4. years, (that is to say, for the year of our Lord.1573. the first after
Bissextilis, the year.1574. being the second year, and the year.1575. which
is the third year, with the year.1576. which is the year of Bissextilis or
leap year it self) which the Sea men do call a Regiment, and will serve
for.24. year without any great error: and is exactly calculated for the
Longitude of London for the instant time of noone, and will serve all Europe
and Africa, near unto the coast of America without much error, saving in
February, March or September, whilst the sun has swifte declination. But
in June and December it will serve all the world over: because the sun has
but slow declination, etc. And also there be other necessary rules of
Navigations to know how to handle the Suns declination, to know the altitude
of either of the.2 Poles, (as the contents of the book do show) with other
necessary things meet to be known in Navigations, and not mentioned in the
book of Martin Curtise called the Art of Navigations. Neither do I mean to
write of any thing mentioned in that book: for that it is there sufficiently
declared already. And thus (gentle Readers) I desire you to bear with my
rudeness, that I should take upon me to open any science, for that I am
utterly unlearned, and without help of any learned persons, desiring you not
to conceive any evil opinion of me, but to take it as my good will, minding to
profit my native Country as much as lies in me. Notwithstanding it is
possible that some people will be offended with me, that I should write this
simple Treatise, but then I consider again, and know, that virtue lacks no
enemies and defacers, and vice lacks no friends and maynteyners, so that
knowledge lacks no contempt, neither ignorance lacks furtherance, and
especially among all people there is none more ready to contemn, than the
ignorant sort: for ignorance is the father of all errors and the mother of
contention. And thus I draw to end, desiring you to take this simple work in
good part, being willing to pleasure my native country according to the simple
talent that God has given me And whereas you find any error I pray you let
me gently understand, for I think not that I cause circumspectly work but I
may be deceived, for man cannot be so precise but he may err, and I have
seldom heard of any the best Authors but he has erred in some point:
therefore in those things that he knows not of himself he must needs
follow his Author, and if his Author do err he must needs fall into that
error that his Author does. And furthermore, a number of people there be that
devise nothing else but lies and slanders, yea, and those which cannot attain
to any thing themselves, do hate all those that be not ignorant as they
themselves be: for the corrupt nature of man is such, that it is a corsey to
their hearts that any should be commended before themselves, for generally
amongst all people of the earth (which is innumerable) every several person
thinks himself most worthy, imagining themselves to have no fellows: such
is the Diuill in the heart of man, pampering man's heart so with pride to think
he has no fellow, whereas man of himself is not able to do any good thing, no
not to think one good thought, but by the only might and providence of
almighty God, therefore of our selves we can do nothing that is good. And thus
gentle Reader I make an end. If this simple and barbarous thing be taken in
good part, then look for other of my works shortly, and bear him good will
that studieth for the benefit of his native country, desiryng God of his
grace, that I and you may do that thing that may be to the laud, praise and
glory of God, to our commodity and souls health, to the profit of our
brethren, and the common wealth of this our realm. Thus I betake you to
Almighty God the creator of all things, praying him that both I and you may
after this life rest in the kingdom of heaven, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
there to remain world without end. Amen.

I. H. In commendation of the Book.
WHo so thou art that mindst to pass the seas,
By Compass, Card, the Sun, or starrie sky,
Mark well this work, and gain thereby such ease,
As shall attain thee profit great perdie,
Such rules has Bourne directed to thine eye,
That even by them, if saylings art were gone,
Thou might by these direct thy course alone.
T. H. In praise of the Author.
WHo travels Countries gain is worthy of great praise:
as those yt were before our time and yy in sundry ways.
Whose acts do so excel, they pierce the lofty skies
that in good arts for common weal, both wit and will applies
For those that were tofore, have been aduanst by fame,
by due desert, by doing well, have merited the same.
As Authors old can tell, who list in them to read
who were inue^ters of the same which daily now proceed
In rule of public weal, our Jove it first began
and plast it here in all estates, for the behoof of man.
So now thou Seamen eke, that spredst abroad thy sail
be thankful for thy Author here, which is for thy avail.
Whose travail and whose toil is thy behoof and gain,
if thou do reap what he did sow, it quiteth well his pain,
And thankfulness is due, to every living wight,
and does perteyne to every man, but yet to God by right.
To who^ be praise for evermore, which rules globe and sphere,
who grant us grace to do his will, while we be living here.
FINIS.
A. R. To the Author.
WHy do thou Bourne thy self hold back
not doing what thou should?
Me thinks I hear thee Answer make
that if thou durst thou would.
Whereof art thou afraid? tell forth
to me thy doubtful case:
To utter truth no man there is
that ones will hide his face.
Perhaps thou fearst the scoffing kin^
of Momus dearlings dear,
Perhaps again thou standst in doubt,
and art now dashed with fear.
To see these shaking quaking reeds
that bend with every blast,
Look frowning on this book, in which
great pain bestowd thou have.
Why did not then Demosthenes
his works hide out of sight?
Why did not Tullie stay his pen,
when he began to write?
If taunting tongue of Momus then
had been so rife as now
Thou think perchance they would have fear^
the same as well as thou.
No sure thou art deceyud: there were
as many lightbraynes then,
As there be now in these our days
to carpe at painful pen.
But Countries profit lo it was
that caused them to write,
And praise of good men did provoke
their works to come to light.
And have not thou spent all the time
of writing this thy book
For countries sake, to profit all
that will vouchsafe to look
Thereon? behold what praise he reapt
that ship did first invent:
It cannot be but they which read
perceive shall thine intent.
Can any deem amiss of thee
that use of ship have told,
When ships inuentor gained has
such praises manifold?
Do thou not know invention
what of it may be thought,
When use and sauegarde of the same
there is none knows ought?
The Proverb says, a thing that is
to big to gripe in hand,
Can not be holden longer than
the siefe can hold the sand.
In book it cannot be denied
but thou have taken pain
To set forth plain the use of sail
for Countries common gain.
Although I know how odious
comparisons be still,
Be sure examples take thou may
and use them at thy will.
Since therefore thou example have
of famous memory,
Demonsthenes and Tullie eke
extold unto the sky,
Wh' excelling far all other men
in Greek and Latin phrase
Were subject yet to Sicophantes
and under Momus blase.
Thou have besides all this, the truth
by practice truly tried,
Whereby if any kick at thee
they may be soon espide.
Of good men I dare boldly say
that good will thou shall have,
For evil of thee they none will speak,
and praise thou do not crave.
Therefore I wish thee naught to fear
the force that tongues can bend
But still the work thou have begone
to bring to perfect end.

FOr that the common people do fall into such a number of errors as touching
the length of the day, holding an opinion that in every.15. days, the day is
an hour longer or shorter, the truth is this: the day does keep no such
proportion in the lengthening and shorting, but does length and short
according unto the swiftness and the slownesse of the suns declination, for
when the Sun has swifte declination, then does the day lengthen and shorten
apace: and when that the Declination is slow, then does the day lengthen or
shorten but slowly. And yet the most part of the common people do hold an
opinion, that at Christmasse or else at New years day at the furthest the day
must needs be an hour longer, and yet the Sun has not declined or come
toward the Equinoctial.2. degrees and a half, which will not make half an
hour in the length of the day. Wherefore I do think it good to declare
through the whole year when the day is an hour longer or shorter here in this
place for the Latitude or height of the pole Articke at London, the Pole being
raised.51. degrees and.32. minutes, or.34. minutes: and our longest Somer day
is.16. hours and a half, and our shortest winter day is.7. hours and a half
from the rising of the Sun unto the setting of the Sun: and first this,
the shortest winter day is the.11. or.12. day of December, and then the Sun
rises a quarter of an hour after.8. and sets a quarter of an hour
before.4. of the clock, and then the Sun has his greatest declination unto
the Southwardes. And then the.29. day of December the day is a quarter of an
hour longer, then rises the Sun at.8. of the clock and settes at.4. And
then the 17. or.18 of January the day is an hour longer and not before, for
the Sun must be declined from her Solstick of winter.5. degrees and.12.
minutes before the day is lengthned an hour, so that I do affirm, that from
the.4. or.5. day of November, unto the.17. or.18. day of January, in all that
time the day is but one hour shorter and longer, which is the time of 10.
weeks. And then the.27. or.28. of January the night is ^5. hours long, then
rises the Sun half an hour after.7. and sets half an hour after four
of the clock. And then the.11. or.12. day of February the day is.10. hours
long, then rises the Sun at.7. and sets at.5. of the clock. And then
the.26. day of February the day is.11. hours long, then rises the Sun
half an hour after.6. and sets half an hour after.5. of the clock. And
then the.11* day of March the sun is upon the Equinoctial and the day
just.12. hours long all the world over. And then the.24. day of March the
day is.13. hours long, and then rises the Sun half an hour before 6. and
sets half an hour after.6. of the clock. And then the.7. day of April
the day is.14. hours long, and then rises the Sun at.5. of the clock just,
and sets at.7. of the clock just. And then the.23. day of April the day
is.15. hours long, and there rises the Sun half an hour before.5. and
sets half an hour after.7. of the clock. And then the.15. day of May the
day is.16. hours long, then rises the Sun at.4. of the clock and sets
at.8. of the clock just. And then the.11. of June the Sun has her greatest
declination to the Northwarde, and then is our longest Somer days, and then it
is.16. hours and a half from the Sun rising unto the Sun setting, so that
the Sun rises a quarter of an hour before.4. and sets a quarter of an
hour after eight of the clock. And then the.10. day of Iulie the day is.16.
hours long, then rises the sun at.4. and sets at.8. of the clock. And
then the last of July the day is.15. hours long. And then the.16. day of
August the day is.14. hours long. And then the last day of August the day
is.13. hours long. And then the.13. or.14. of September the sun is upon the
Equinoctial, and the day just.12. hours long. And then the.27. day of
September the day is.11. hours long. And then the 11. of October the day
is.10. hours long. And then the.26. day of October the day is.9. hours long.
And then the.15. day of November the day is.8. hours long, and so unto the.11.
or 12. of December, and then the day is at the shortest (as before is
declared.) Thus much have I said as touching the length of the day by even
hours, which some people will have at the entrance of the Sun into the.12.
signs, of which in the lengthing and shorting of the day there is no such
matter, but only this look, when that the Sun has declined.5. degrees
and.12. minutes in this our Latitude, then is the day an hour longer or
shorter, as you shall find this matter more larglier spoken of in all places
through the world, in the.^1. chapter of the book.

An Introduction unto the Regiment for the Sea.
The names of certain things necessary to be known of them that are Mariners
or Seafaring men, meet to be known of them that do practice Navigations, as
this: the names of the circles of the Sphere, and what they are, and their
uses: and also the names of other things belonging thereunto, and what they
are, and their uses.

First what the Horizon circle is.
THe Horizon is the parting of the earth or the Sea and the sky, that is to
say, the half of the heavens being above over your head, and the other half
hidden with the earth or Sea under them: and this Horizon circle does move as
you do move: for as you do by travel change your place, so does the Horizon
change in all points.

The use of the Horizon circle.
THe use of the Horizon circle is this, to take the height of the Sun or any
star, with the cross staff, setting the one end with the Horizon, and the
other end with the Sun or star, so that you have a true Horizon: and that
must be done upon the Sea, or else it must be a very plain ground upon the
top of a hill, else it is no true Horizon. And also if the Sun or Moon, or
any star be to be seen, the^ they be above the Horizon: if they be not to be
seen, then they be under the Horizon.

2. What the Meridian circle is.
THe Meridian is a circle beginning due South, and so passing by your Zenith
that is right over the crown of your head, and so by the two Poles of the
world: and if you do travel due South and North, you do not change your
Meridian: but in the going or traveling any other way, you do change it.

The use of the Meridian circle.
THe use of the Meridian circle is, to know the just time of noone by the
Sun: for as soon as the middle of the Sun is upon the Meridian, then it is
noone, and when the Sun, Moon, or any Star is upon the Meridian, then they
be farthest from the Horizon, and it is a meet time to take their height for
to know the altitude or height of the Pole of the world, whereby you may
perfitly know how far you be too the Southwardes or Northwardes of any
place.

3. What the Equinoctial circle is, being a Parallel line or circle fixed.
THe Equinoctial is a fixed circle in the Heavens equally distant from both
the Poles, and does pass directly over the middle of the earth round about,
and is called the Equinoctial, for that if the Sun be there, then through
all the whole world the Sun is twelve hours above the Horizon, and twelve
hours under the Horizon saving under the two Poles, and there the Equinoctial
is with the Horizon. So they shall see half the Sun and no more, till the
Sun be departed from the Equinoctial. And also to them that do inhabit or
dwell in any place under the Equinoctial, the Sun, Moon, and all the
Stars be twelve hours above the Horizon, and twelve hours under the Horizon.

The use of the Equinoctial circle.
THe use of the Equinoctial, is to know what declination the Sun or any
other Star has from it, and of which side, and by that is known the height
of the Equinoctial, and by the height of that is known the height of either of
the two Poles of the world.

4 What the circle or Tropicke of Cancer is, being a Parallel circle fixed.
THe Tropicke of Cancer is the greatest declination that the Sun does come
unto the Northwards, and then is our longest Summer days, and shortest nights.

5. What the circle or Tropic of Capricorn is, being a Parallel circle fixed.
THe Tropicke of Capricorn, is the greatest declination that the sun does go
unto the Southwards, and then is our shortest Winter days, and longest nights.

The uses of these two circles be but small, but that the days being at the
longest or shortest, the Sun does return back again. etc.

6. What the Articke circle is, being a Parallel circle.
THe Articke circle does touch the Horizon due North, and is according to the
place that you are in, of any place upon the face of the earth, and does wyden
and narrow according unto the altitude or height of the Pole: for as you do
go unto the South parts, then does your Articke circle grow narower and
narower, until you come right under the Equinoctial line, and then have you
no Articke circle: and if that you do go unto the North parts, then does your
Articke circle grow wider and wider: and where the North Pole is raised.66.
degrees and a half, there the Artick circle is just with the Tropic of Cancer,
and then under the north Pole, there your Artick circle is with the Equinoctial.

The use of the Articke circle.
THe use of the Articke circle, is to know what Stars do never set unto
you, for all those Stars or lyghtes that you do see under the Pole, do not
set: and if that you be unto the North wards, of the height of the Pole, more
than.66. degrees and a half: if that the Sun or Moon be in the Tropic of
Cancer, they shall not go down unto you under the Horizon, but shall be
still in sight unto you, so that they be not let by the clouds and other
accidents.

7. What the Antarticke circle is, being a Parallel circle.
THe Antarticke circle does touch the Horizon due South, and is opposite or
right against the Articke circle, and does wide and narrow in all points,
and does not differ from the Articke circle, saving the Articke circle is
above the Horizon, and the Antartike circle is underneath the Horizon.

The use of the Antarticke circle.
THe use of the Antarticke circle is as the Articke is in all points, to know
what stars will not appear above your Horizon, and in like manner, to the
Northwardes of 66. degrees and a half, (the Sun or Moon being in the
Tropicke of Capricorn) then they will not rise above the Horizon.

8. What the Zodiac is, being a circle.
THe Zodiac is the greatest circle in all the Heavens, wherein all the
wandering lights or Planets do keep their courses, that is to say, the Sun
and Moon, and the other five Planets or Stars, that is to say, Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. etc. which circle is divided into twelve
equal parts, called the twelve singes, as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, the which
circle stands oblique equinoctial or awrye, crossing in the middle at two
places: the Northermost part is the middle of the Zodiac, and that is the
Tropicke of Cancer: and the Southermost part is the tropicke of Capricorn,
the very middle of the zodiac: and that line in the middle of the zodiac, is
called the ecliptic line, and the zodiac is.21. degrees broad, that is to
say, six degrees from the eclipticke line unto the north parts, and six
degrees unto the South parts.

The use of the Zodiac.
THe use of the Zodiac is, through the moving of the Sun and Moon and the
other planets, to know in what sign they be, and also to know the time of the
change of the Moon, with all the other respects: and in like manner to know
the aspects of all the other planets unto the Moon, and also the planets
amongst themselves: and by the aspectes in the.12. signs is gathered their
effects, and in what country it may happen.

9. What the line Ecliptic is.
THe line ecliptic, is a circle in the very middle of the Zodiac, the which
the very middle or center of the Sun does go upon.

The use of the line Ecliptic.
THe use of the line Ecliptic is this, if that the Moon or any other star
be unto the North part thereof, then it is said that they have North latitude,
and if unto the Southe part, then they have south latitude: and also by this
circle called the line ecliptic, is known the eclipse of the Sun and the
Moon.

10. What the artick polare circle is, being a parallel circle fixed.
THe artick polare circle is made by the pole of the Zodiac, or pole of the
circle ecliptic.23. degrees and a half in the heavens from the poles of the
world above the horizon.

11. What the antartick Polare circle is, being a Parallel circle fixed.
THe antartick Polare circle is just opposite unto ye artick polare, made by
the antartick pole underneath our horizon. The use of them I will declare, when
I speak of the poles of the Ecliptic or Zodiac.

12. What the two circles called Colures be. etc.
THe.2. circles called Colures, be those that do divide the Zodiac, and all
the other parallel circles into.4. equal parts, the one of the circles does
cross the Zodiac in the first point of Aries and Libra, and so passes by
the.2. poles of the world, and is called the equinoctial colure: and the other
colure circle does cross the Zodiac in the first point of Cancer and
Capricorn, and so passes the.2. poles of the world, and there at the.2. poles
the one circle does cross the other: and that is called the Solstitiall colure.

The use of these two circles.
THe use of the.2. colure circles is this, the Sun placing by them does
divide the year into.4. parts: as this, the Sun in the first point of
Aries, is Spring time. etc.

13. What the.2. Poles of the world is, imagined to be as an axiltree.
THe.2. poles of the world, imagined to be as an axiltree, (that is to say, the
North pole called the pole artick, and the South pole called the pole
antartick) the one is directly against the other: the North pole always above
our horizon, and the South pole antartick always under our horizon, being fixed
fast in the heavens, and the equinoctial just and equally between them: and
the cause why that it is imagined too be an axiltree is this, for that the
whole heavens and all the lyghtes of the Firmamente be carried round about
from the East unto the West in.24. hours: so that no light nor place remains
unremoved, but only the.2. poles of the world.

The use of the Poles of the world.
THe use of the.2. Poles, is this, to know how far we do transporte our
selves, and to know what climate, and temperatnesse we be in as touching heat
and cold.

14. What the.2. Poles of the Zodiac is, imagined to be an axiltree in the
heavens.
THe.2. Poles of the Zodiac, or Ecliptic, imagined to be as an axiltree,
(the artick pole of the Zodiac, or rather the Ecliptic, and the Antartick
pole of the Zodiac) the one being directly against the other, and the Zodiac
or rather the middle thereof, called the ecliptic, to be just or equal
between them, are called the Poles of the Zodiac: for that the Sun and the
Moon, and the other planets and fixed stars do move unto the eastward,
according to the standing of the Zodiac. etc.

The use of the Poles of the Zodiac.
TThe use of the two Poles of the Zodiac is this, (as it is before declared)
that the Zodiac is divided intoo 12. equal parts, called the.12. signs, and
those divisions by imagination do pass unto the poles of the Zodiac, in such
form as the meridian lines do all meet at the poles of the world, and so do
all those divisions meet at the two poles of the Zodiac, and then any star,
that is out of the Zodiac, either unto the southwards, or northwardes,
(according unto those divisions) they be called in the signs.

15. What the Zenith or vertical point is, imagined to be as an axiltree.
THe Zenith or vertical point, is imagined to be a prick in the heavens right
over the crown of your head, and is moveable as we our selves be, and is as an
axiltree unto the horizon circle: and as you do transport your self from one
place unto another, so does your Zenith or vertical point, and your horizon
circle also.

The use of the Zenith or vertical point. etc.
THe use of the Zenith or vertical point is this, to know how near or far
off any star is from your zenith, by taking the true height of any star
with an instrumente, for that from your zenith is always.90. degrees down unto
the horizon on every side round about you, as it shall more plainly appear
hereafter where I speak of degrees.

16. What a Degree is.
A Degree is the part or division of a whole circle, into.360. equal parts,
how big or small soever the circle be.

The use of the Degrees is manyfold.
THe use of the degrees is to know by the Sun and Moons course in the
zodiac, or any other of the planets or mouable stars, how many degrees they
be asunder: whereby is known at what time they have any aspecte the one with
the other. And also by the degrees it is known, what latitude and what
declination any light or star has from the ecliptic or equinoctial: and
also the degrees will show unto you, how many miles that you do transporte
your self upon the earth to the South or North parts, for that every degree
does answer unto.60. english miles, in the going South and North: which is
known by the altitude of the North pole or the number of degrees between the
equinoctial and your zenith or vertical point, for from your zenith unto the
horizon, is.90. degrees to the southwards, and 90. degrees unto the Northwards,
which is half the compass of the heavens for twice.90. is.180. and then the
earth does hide the other half of the heavens: and twice.180. makes.360. the
whole contents of the compass of every great circle in the heavens.

17. What a Minute is.
OF Minutes there be two sorts, minutes of time, and minutes of measure, and is
no other thing but the lesser part of time or measure, which is the.60. part
of a degree, or the.60. part of an hour: and all the divisions in these
matters, is by.60. For as.60. Minutes is a degree or an hour, so.60. seconds is
a Minute, and.60. thirds is a second, and.60. fourths is a third. etc.

18. Altitude is heigthe: the use thereof.
ALtitude is the heigthe of any thing taken, as the heigthe of the Sun, or
any Star, or the height of the Pole, above the horizon: or the height of a
steeple, or a tower, or such other like.

19. Latitude is wideness: the use thereof.
LAtitude is in the heavens: if the Moon, or any other Star be unto the
South parts or the North parts of the ecliptic, that then it is said, to be
so many degrees in latitude or wideness, from ye line ecliptic to the South
or North part: and also latitude is counted upon the earth in like manner, if
that you be in any place between, from under the equinoctial, either to the
South or North part, between any of the.2. Poles, that you are so many degrees
in latitude from the equinoctial. etc.

20. Longitude is length: the use thereof.
LOngitude in the heavens is, if the Sun or Moon or any other Star, be in
such a sign, and so many degrees: that then it is said: that they have
longitude, in such a sign and so many degrees. And also longitude upon the
earth, is counted from the Canarie Islands unto the Eastward, as this, if that
any town or city be unto the Eastwards so many degrees from the Canarie
Islands, then it is said, that the city or town is so many degrees in
Longitude, whereby is known the time of the chaunges of the Moon, or any
other aspecte, or any Eclipse of the Sun or Moon, at the city or town.

21. Declination is leaning: the use thereof.
DEclination is counted in the heavens, if that the Sun or any other Star
be unto the North part, or South part of the equinoctial, then it is said,
that the Sun or Star has so many degrees of declination to the South, or
to the North parts, as it happens. etc.

22. Circumference is the compass of a circle by the outer edge.
DIameter is the breadth of a circle, passing right over the center or middle
thereof, from outside unto outside.

23. Center is the middle prick in any circle, equally distant from the edge
of the circle in every place.
AParelell line or circle is, if two lines or more (how many soever there be)
be equally distaunt in every place alike, being right lines.

24. Auge what it is.
AVge is a point in the heavens, when the Sun or Moon is excentrick, going
nearer unto the heavens, and further from the earth than her common order is:
and the opposition thereof is, when that the Sun and Moon do come nearer
unto the earth than they do at any other time.

The use thereof.
THe use thereof is, to know when that they be in their swift motion, or in
their slow motion: in the point of Auge, they be in their slow motion, in the
opposition thereof in their swift motion.

25. What the head or tail of the Dragon is.
THe head of the Dragon, is the place where that the Moon does come over the
line Ecliptic, from the South part, unto the North part: and the tail of the
Dragon is, where the Moon passes over the line ecliptic, from the North
part, unto the South part.

The use of the head and tail of the Dragon.
TThe use of the head and tail of the Dragon, is to know, when that there is
any eclipse of the Sun or Moan: and of what quantity or greatness the
eclipse is.

26. What Navigations is.
Navigations is this, how to direct his course in the Sea to any place assigned,
and to consider in that direction what things may stand with him, and what
things may stand against him, having consideration how to preserve the ship in
all storms and chaunges of weather that may happen by the way, to bring the
ship safe unto the port assigned, and in the shortest time.

The use of Navigations.
THe use thereof is this, first too know how that the place does bear from
him, by what wind or point of the compass, and also how far that the place
is from him, and also to consider the stream, or tide gates, Currents, which
way that they do set or drive the ship, and also to consider what dangers is
by the way, as rocks and sands, and such other like impedimentes, and also
if that the wind change or shifte by the way, to consider which way to
stand, and direct his course unto the most advantage to attain unto the port
in shortest time: and also if any storms do happen by the way, to consider
how for to preserve the ship and the goods, and too bring her safe unto the
port assygned. And also it is most principally to be considered and
foreseen, that if they have had by occasion of a contrary tempest, for too
go very much out of the course or way, too know then how that the place
does then bear, that is to say, by what point of the compass the place
does stand from you: and also how far it may be from you. Which way to be
known is this: first to consider by what point that the ship has made her
way by, and how fast and swiftly that the ship has gone, and to consider
how often that the ship has altered her course, and how much that she
has gone at every time, and then to consider all this in your platte or
card, and so you may give an near guess, by what point or wind it bears
from you, and also how far it is thither. And also you may have a great
help by the Sun or Stars, to take the heigthe of the Pole above the
horizon, and also in some place you may guess by the sounding, both by the
depth, and also by the ground. And also it is very meet and necessary to
know any place, when that he does see it.

27. Of instruments to use at the Sea for to take he heigthe of the Sun or
any Stars.
ALl instruments too take the heighte of the Sun or any Star, the
original of the making thereof, it is either a circle or the part of a
circle, whose division is the.360. part of a circle, what form soever that it
has, as your cross staff, it is marked according unto the proportion of a
circle, and every one of the degrees, is the equal part of a circle, the
three hundred and sixty part. etc.

The use of the Instruments.
THe use of the Instruments, as Astrolobes or common Kings, or the cross
staff, is to take the height of the su^ne or other stars, whose uses do follow
here after in the book.

28. What manner of persons be meetest to take charge of Ships in Navigations.
AS touching those persons that are meet to take charge, that is to say, to be
as master of ships in Navigations, he ought to be sober and wise, and not to be
light or rash headed, nor to be to fumish or hasty, but such a one as can well
govern himself, for else it is not possible for him to govern his company
well: he ought not to be to simple, but he must be such a one as must keep
his company in awe of him (by discretion,) doing his company no injury or
wrong, but to let the^ have that which men ought to have, and then to see unto
them that they do their labor as men ought to do in all points. And the
principal point in government is, to cause himself both to be feared and
loved, and that grows principally by this means, to cherishe men in well
doing, and those men that be honestly addicted, to let them have reasonable
pre-eminence, so that it be not hurtful unto the Merchant nor to himself,
and to punish those that be malefactors and disturbers of their company, and
for small faults, to give them gentle admonition to amend them: and principally
these two points are to be foreseen by the masters, (that is) to serve God
himself, and to see that all the whole company do so in like manner, at such
convenient time as it is meet to be done: the second point is, that the master
use no play at the dise or cards, neither (as near as he ca^) to suffer any,
for ye sufferance thereof may do very much hurt in diverse respects: And
furthermore, the master ought to be such a one, as does know the Moons
course, whereby he does know at what time it is a full Sea, or a low water,
knowing in what quarter or part of the sky, that the Moon does make a full
Sea at that place, and also the master ought to be acquainted, or know that
place well, that he does take charge to go unto (except that he have a Pilot)
and also he that takes charge upon him, ought to be expert, how the tydegates
or currentes do set from place unto place: and also not to be ignorant of
such dangers as lies by the way, as rocks, sands, or banks, and also most
principally he ought to be such a one, as can very well direct his courses
unto any place assigned, and to have capacity how for to handle or shift
himself in foul weather or storms. And also it behooves him too be a good
coaster, that is to say, to know every place by the sight thereof. And also he
that takes charge for long voyages, ought to have knowledge in plats or
cards, and also in such instruments as be meet to take the height of the Sun
or any Star, and to have capacity to correct those instruments, and also
he ought to be such a one, that can calculate the Suns declination, or else
to have some true regiment, and also he ought to know how to handle the
Suns declination, when that he has taken the height of the Sun.

Now begins the Regiment for the Sea, the first Chapter or rule of
Navigations, and shows what the.32. points of the Compass is, and to what
uses they do serve.
THe first and most principal thing for any seafaring man or traveler, is to
know toward what part of the Earth he means to go, and then being upon the
sea, there he sees no path nor mark to travel by, but only the use of the
Needle or compass. And to show the cause how they in old time did find them
or called them, is sufficiently declared by other, but this is to be noted: 8.
Capital or head points.
There be eight capital or head winds or points, and four of them have
their names properly of themselves, and the other four of them, are derived,
or take their names of the other four, as this, South comes directly from
the Meridian, and North is directly against it, and East comes from the
Equinoctial point, toward the parts of the Sun rising, and Weast is
right against it, Northeast is in the midway between the East and the North,
and Southeast in the midway betweent the East and the South, and Southwest
between the Weast and the South, and Northweast in the middle between the
North and the Weast. 8. Inferior points or winds.
And then there be eight inferior points, or winds, half way between every
one of those.8. capital or head points or wynds, and that is North Northeast,
East Northeast, East Southeast, and Southe Southeaste, and South Southweast,
and Weaste Southweaste, and Weaste Northweaste, and North Northweaste: and
now between every one of these inferioure points, and every one of the
head wyndes there is a by point or wind, and he is called a by point, for
that he is not named but by the name of one of the head^ points next adjoining.
16. by points or winds.
There be.16. of them in number, so that there be.8. capital or head points,
and.8. inferior points, and 16. by points or winds, so that in all there
be.32. of them. The use of these points is, to direct the ship to what
quarter of the world you do assign, to keep that course to find the place so
assygned, for that the property of the Needle or Fly, is always to stand due
South and North.



As touching Navigations, for the instructions of the meanest I have set this
figure or compass, where first is to be noted the.32. winds and points of the
compass above made. The flouredeluce is the first point, and these be the
names, beginning at the North, and so with the course of the Sun to say

Equinoctial circle 360. degres one point of the compass contains 11.
degrees and a quarter.
and there is in the compass the contents of the great circle, or Equinoctial
circle being.360 degrees in compass, so that every point contains.11.
degrees, and and.4. points contain.45. degrees.8. points contains one
quarter of the compass or Equinoctial circle, being.90. degrees.16. points
contains half the circumference.180. degrees, and every degree
contains.60. secondes and so forth. Furthermore, the.32. points contain.24.
hours, that is to say, one point contains.3. quarters of an hour.45.
minutes: and.2. points one hour and a half.4. points.3. hours: The.32.
points brought into.24. hours.
8. points.6. hours.12. points.9. hours.16. points.12. hours, and so to
the rest of the points. And every hour contains.60. minutes: and every
half hour.30. minutes, and every quarter of an hour.15. minutes: and after
that rate.45. minutes makes three quarters of an hour.

The second Chapter or rule treats of the Golden number or Prime, showing the
Epacte, and by the Epacte to know the Age of the Moon.
IT is necessary and convenient for the Seafaring men, to know the Prime or
Golden number: for by the Golden number is known the Epacte, and the Epacte
shows the age of the Moon or change day, within.12. hours under or over:
and by the age of the Moon, you may know at what a clock it does flow in any
place that you do know what Moon does make a full Sea: therefore it is meet
too know the Epacte, and that is known by the Pryme, or Golden number. The
cause why that it was called the Pryme or Golden number.
The cause why it was called the Golden number, was because it was sent out of
Egypt in letters of gold, too the Romans or City of Rome. The cause why
that it is called the Pryme, was for that it was the first order that the
Moons course was known by, and it is thus known. Add one to the year of our
Lord that you would know the Golden number or Pryme of, then divide the number
by.19. the remainer is the Pryme: To know how many the Epact is.
and multiply that by.11. and look what the number comes unto, divide that
by.30. the remayner is the Epact. Then when you have once the Epact, add.11.
to your Epact for every year more, and look what that comes to, that is your
Epact: and if it do pass.30. put that away, and keep the remainer for your
Epact. And thus this rule will serve for ever, saving when the Pryme begins
at one, for then the Epacte is.11. and then do (as aforesaid) as you may
perceive by this table here following.

The Table of Pryme and Epacte for.19. years, and when those.19. years be
ended, then begin again, and so it will serve for ever. etc. The year of the
Lord. Pryme. Epact. 1574 17 7 1575 18 18 1576 19 29 1577 1 11 1578 2 22 1579 3

1 1588 12 12 1589 13 23 1590 14 4 1591 15 15 1592 16 26

THe Prime or Golden number, is the time of.19. years, in the which time the
Moon makes all her chaunges or conjunctions with the Sun, and when all
these.19. years be expired, then she begins again: as for example. The
pryme is the time of.19. years
This year being the year of our Lord.1574. she changed the.22. day of
March, and every year does alter.11. days of her change till the year.1593. and
then she changes the said.22. day of March again, as I showed you before.
The Epacte is the putting to.11. for every year. Now furthermore to know the
age of the Moon, do thus: take the number of the Epact for your year
(beginning at March always) and reckon how many months it is from March,
(counting March for one) then reckon how many days of the month it is in
which you would know the age of the Moon: To know the age of the Moon by
the number of the Epact.
Then put all your numbers together, (that is to say, your Epacte, your month
from March, and every day of the month,) then look how many it amounts
unto, that is the age of the Moon, but if it pass.30. throw all the.30.
away, and keep that that will not be.30. for when the age of the Moon is
just.30. then is it the change day: and if it be the fifteenth day of the
age of the Moon, then the Moon is at the full. When the age is between seven
days and eight, then is the first quarter. And if it be.xxij. days old, then
the Moon is at the last quarter: as for example, this year.1574. I look and
find the Epacte.7. for the year, now I would know the age of the Moon,
the.13. day of June. Now I reckon how many months it is from March, reckning
March for one, and I find it is four months, then I take and add all these
together, that is to say, seven for the Epacte, and four for the months
(that is to say, March, April, May, June) and then.13. for the days of the
month, and all comes to.24. So that you may conclude that the Moon is.24.
days old, and was at the last quarter two days before.

The third Chapter or rule treats, how to know by the age of the Moon
what hour it does flow, or is full Sea at any place, where you do know
what Moon makes a full Sea.
Now by the age of the Moon you may know at what hour it flows in any
place, where you do know what Moon makes a full Sea, which rule commonly the
Sea men call the shifting their Sun and Moon: and many ways there be too do
it, for thus they may do it: Let them divide one hour into.5. parts, and the^
take.4. of those parts, and put the fifth part away, To know the alteration of
the ^ides in.24 hours.
that serves for the alteration of 24. hours, and the four fifth parts of an
hour, are.48. minutes, and the.5. part of an hour is.12. minutes. A flood and
an ebb, does alter.24. minutes forwards: as this for example: it flows
at.12. of the clock at the Lands end upon the change day, the Moon being in
the South: at all times a full Sea* The Moon being one day old, it flows
at.12. of the clock. 48. minutes.2. days old it flows at one of the
clock.36. minutes.3. days old it flows at.2. of the clock.24. minutes: four
days old it flows at.3. of the clock.12. minutes: five days old, it flows
at.4. of the clock just: Six days old, it flows at.4. of the clock.48.
minutes: Seven days old at.5. of the clock.36. minutes: An ensample for the
full Sea upon the ^^nds end* for every day of the age of the Moon.
Eight days old at.6. of the clock.24* minutes: Nine days old, at.7. of the
clock.12. minutes: Ten days old, it flows at.8. of the clock just: Eleven
days old at.8. of the clock.48. minutes: 12. days.9 of the clock.36. minutes:
13. days old.10. of the clock.24. minutes: 14. days old, it flows at.11. of
the clock.12. minutes: 15. days old, it flows at.12. of the clock just, then
being the full Moon: and so begin again as you did before at one day old, and
so forth. For the course of the tides is nothing else but to add for every
day^ of the age of the Moon one hour, pulling back the fifth part of an
hour (being.12. minutes) and by this account you may at all times know at
what a clock it does flow, by putting to every floudde and ebb.24. minutes,
and to.2. floods and.2. ebbes putting to.48. minutes. To shift the Sun and
Moon by the points of the compass.
Now furthermore the Seamen use to make their account by this means (but it is
all one) they do allow for every day of the age of the Moon, one point and.3
minutes: for a point of the compass contains. 45. minutes that is.3. quarters
of an hour. Then they put.3. minutes to.45. minutes, which makes.48. minutes,
the said.3. minutes be the.15. part of a point, and from the change to the full
is.15. days, so that (the half compass being.16. points) they break the
odd point into.15. parts, and that comes to.3. minutes, so that the
alteration of the tides, for every.24. hours, be.48. minutes, or ye.4. fifth
parts of an hour. Wherefore there shall follow a table of tides about certain
places of this realm: for every Moon contains.29. days.12. hours.44.
minutes from change to change: The content of the number of days and hours
in one moon: ye hours in every moan be.708.44 minutes.

The content of a year is.365 days.5. hours.55. Minutes. How the mooneths
took their names.


the whole contents of the hours of the Moon, be.708. hours, and.44. minutes.
And there is in every year.12. changes of the Moon: and the year
contains.365. days.5. hours.55. minutes.13. seconds. Yet some do affirm to
be add.6. hours, but there lacks.4. minutes.47. seconds in the tropicall
year. Likewise in the year be.12. months agreeable to the.12. Moons: the 12.
Moons contain but.354. days, so that there be.11. dais more in the year,
than there be in the.12. moons. The year also is divided into.12. months,
which mooneths have taken their names at the will and pleasure of men: as
first January, was so called, of Ianus because of.2. heads, for the month of
January beholds the end of the year past and the beginning of the year to
come. February took his name of certain roman sacrifices called Februa.
March is so called of Mars, for Romulus so named it after his father. April
co^mes of Aperio, because that then the earth is opened. May of Maia, the
mother of Mercury, June so called by preparing to the war. July of Julius
Caesar, and Augustus of Augustus Caesar for in that month he entered the
co^sulship: then the rest of the months took their names of their number from
March. Now these.12. months which makes the year, the Sun does pass or go
through the Zodiac called the.12. signs, which is the occasion of the year,
for this is to be noted, that the sun as I said before, does go by his
natural moving in.365. days.5. hours.55. minutes.13. seconds, The Zodiac
conteyneth.360. degrees.
through the Zodiac, containing.360. degrees, his course being against the
24. hours, going from the Weast into the East, against the course of primum
mobile, or first mouer, being moved by the mighty providence of God, The
moving of.24. hours.
which makes the.24. hours: and so does all the seven lights, or planets,
(except) that it be in their retrogratio^: but the Sun and the Moon, be
never retrograt, as the other.5. planets or lights be. And this is to be noted,
that the Moon goes faster tha^ the Sun, for she goes through the whole
Zodiac in.27. days and.8. hours. The time that the Moon goes through
the.12. signs.
Now in that same time the sun is removed by his natural moving from that
place of the Zodiac near.27. degrees: and then because that the Moon has
not found the Sun there, it is.2. days four hours four and forty minutes
more before that the Moon ouertaketh the Sun again, so by that means it
is.29. days twelve hours and.44. minutes between the change of the Moon and
the next change, one Moon with an other through the year, although that the
Moon may change sometime in less time and sometime in longer time, that is
by the means of the.3. The.3. motions of the Moon.
motions of the Moon, that is to say her swift motion and her middle motion and
her slow motion, which grows by the means of the moons Auge or opposition
thereof. Of Auge.
The Moon being in Auge, goes but little more than.12 degrees in.24. hours.
And in the opposition of Auge near.15. degrees in.24. hours, and in her middle
or equal motion.13. degrees.12. minutes. So this is the occasion why sometime
the Moon may change sooner or be detracted longer than the time of.29.
days.12. The cause why the Moon changes rather or later.
hours and 44. minutes. This point of Auge is mouable, and does pass thorough
the Zodiac in the time of.19. year: and it causes sometime the full of the
Moon to happen sooner and later. In like manner also the quarters of the
Moon, with all the other aspects that the Moon has with the Sun, or any
other of the planets, according to the moons motion. In like manner (by the
means of the.3. motions of the Moon) sometime the Moon goes more tha^ one
point and.3 minutes in.24. hours, The moon goes in.24 hours sometimes more
degrees and sometime fewer degrees.
and sometimes less than one point and.3. minutes, as this for example: the
Moon being in her slow motion, goes but little more than.12. degrees in.24.
hours, and then the Sun in that time does go one degree: and then is there
but.11. degrees between the Sun and the Moon (that is but.44. minutes) So
that the Moon is not one point in.24. hours from the sun. The move is not
one point asunder from the Sun in.24. hours.
But being in her swift motion she goes near.15. degrees in.24. hours, and
the Sun goes one degree in that time: so that there is.14. degrees in.24.
hours, between the Moon and the Sun, (that is.56. minutes) which is a
point and.11. minutes.23. But notwithstanding I would not wish the common
Mariners to trouble themselves with these matters, The moon is in.24. hours a
point and.11. minutes asunder from the Sun
but to follow their accustomed order, to allow for every day of the age of
the Moon, one point, and.3. minutes, etc. And thus much have I said of the
Moons motion: for that some Sea men will take upon them to correct ye
Almanacks as touching the change and quarters of the Moon: holding this
opinion, that every Moon ought to be equal in the number of the days and
hours: and the full moons to be just the half contents. And the quarters in
like manner, the just.4. part in days and hours, Error of Mariners
so that some of them will take upon them to tell (by the rule of the epact,)
the true hour of the change, quarters and full of the Moon. Wherein they are
notably deceived. Again, sometime in the year you shall see the Moon rarer
tha^ at some other time, as this for example: from January to June you shall
see the Moon within.24. hours after the change: because she has North
declination of the Sun, and makes a bigger arche tha^ the Sun. From July
to December you shall not see the Moon.3. days after the change: because her
declination is to the South part of the Sun: but you may see her in.24.
hours, before her change. Now, the Sea men do imagine a prime day, which is
the half quarter of the Moon, that is: when the Moon is three days and.8
hours old, (the Moon being then.4. points to the Eastward of the Sun,
which is 3. hours) the same rule may they in like case observe when the Moon
is paste the full.3. days and.18. hours, and also in the mids of the
quarters.

Here follows a table of Tides.
FIrst, the Moon South or North: on Lands end full Sea.

The Moon South and by East: at the Gore end full Sea.

The Moon South southwest: between holy Island and Tinemouth full Sea.

It flows between Tinemouth and Flambrough head, Southwest and Northeast
Moon.

It flows between Flambrough head and Bridlington in the bay: a South west
and by West Moon.

The Moon in the West Southwest: between Bridlington and Laurenas full Sea.

It flows between Laurenas and Cromer all along the well: an East and West
Moon.

It flows between Cromer and Yarmouth rode, to Laystow North rode: a
Southeast Moon.

It flows between Laistowe rode and Orfordenas: a Southeast and by South
Moon.

It flows between Orford, and Orewel wands: a South Southeast Moon.

It flows between the Nas and the Ware head of Colne: a South and by East
Moon.

It flows at the Spittes and at the Sheue and al along the Swinne: a South
Moon.

At the West end of the Norre: a Southe and by West Moon, full Sea.

It flows at Grauesend: a South Southwest Moon.

It flows at London Bridge: a Southwest Moon.

It flows at the North forlande: a South Southeast Moon, and so along the
coast till you come to Bechy. And in the ofton from the North forland to the
South forland: it runs half tide. And from the South forland to the Nas:
the tide runs half tide half quarter. And from the Nas to the Fairly: it
runs half tide, and from Fairly to Beche: it runs quarter tide under
other.

It flows to the Weastward of Beche, a kenning: a Southeast and by South
Moon.

It flows at Portesmouth: a Southe and by East Moon.

It flows at S. Elens: a South Southeast Moon.

It flows on the Sea side of the Island: a Southeast and by South Moon: and
so on the Land, and at the Needles, and runs quarter tide in the oftonne.

It flows at Poole in the haven: a Southeast Moon.

It flows at Waymouth: an East and West Moon.

It flows at Portland a Southeast Moon.

It flows from the Weaste part of Portlande, till you come unto Plymmouth:
an East and Weast Moon.

It flows on the shore from Plymmouth to the Lizard: a West and by Southe
Moon. And in the oftonne a Southeast Moon.

It flows at Mountes baye: an East and Weaste Moon.

It flows at Selly: a West and by South Moon.

It flows at the Lands end of Goolfe: a West Southwest Moon.

It flows all along the coast up to Bristowe, and the coast of Ireland,
from Waterford to Kinsale: a West and by South Moon.

Furthermore it flows (for the most part) from the poll head of Bordeaux all
along the coast of Biskey, Galiza, Portingale, till you come to the
straightes of Maliga, a Southwest and Northeast Moon.

It flows at Flushing: a Southweast and by Southe Moon.

It flows at Anwerp: an East and west Moon.

It flows all alongest the coast of Flaunders, from the Wyldings to Calys: a
Southe and by East Moon: and so runs half a tide under the other.

Now here is one special thing too be noted, It will now a point of the
compass more in ye spring tides than in the neap tides in a River that has
any distance unto the Sea.
and that is this: it flows one point of the compass more in the Spring
streams, than it doothe in any of the quarters of the Moon (so that it be a
river where there is any indrafte, having distaunce from the Sea) when there is
neither rage of wyndes nor any cause either too hinder or further the said
effect. As for example thus: it flows at Grauesend at the change of the
Moon or full: a Southe Southwest Moon. But in any of the quarters of the
Moon it skante flows a Southe and by West Moon: and this is generally for
ever.

The fourth Chapter treats of the Sun and moons course in the Zodiac: and
how you shall know what hours the Moon shall rise and set at: and at what
point of the compass: with other necessary things.
FVrthermore the Sun (by his natural moving thoroughe the twelve Signs in
the Zodiac, in the year) does cause the height and lowenesse of his
declination: which is necessary for the Seafaring men to know, in which
declination they do take from equinoctial to equinoctial: and this is to be
noted, that as the Sun has declination, so in like manner has the Moon,
for by her declination, and the Sun, is known the time of her shyning or
abiding above our horizon. To know how long the Moon shines.
The Sun or Moon in the first minute of Aries do rise East, and set West,
and shine.12. hours. In the first minute of Taurus they rise near the East
Northeast, and set near the West Northwest, and shine.14. hours. In the sign
of Gemini: they rise near the Northeast and by East, and they set near the
Northwest and by West, and shine.16. hours. In the sign of Cancer the first
minute: they make their greatest declination to the Northwards, and they rise
near the Northeast, and set near the Northweast and shine near.17. hours. In
the first minute of Leo (discending toward the equinoctial,) as they did in
Gemini. And in the sign of Virgo, as they did in Taurus. And in the first
minute of Libra, equinoctial: beginning South declination, as in Aries. And in
the first minute of Scorpio: they rise near the East Southeast, and set
near the Weast Southweast, and shine.10. hours. In the first minute of
Sagittarius: they rise near the Southeast and by East, and set near the
Southwest, and by weast, and shine.8. hours. In the first minute of
Capricornus, they have their greatest declinatio^ to the South, and begin to
return to the equinoctial, rising near the Southeast and setting near the
Southwest, and shine more than.7. hours. In the first minute of Aquarius: as
in Sagittarius. In the first minutes of Pisces: as in Scorpio. Now by this
rule you may know the rising and setting of the Moon for ever: as thus: I
have showed you before in the shifting of the Sun and Moon, that for every
day of the age of the Moon, To know what hour or point the Moon ryseth or
sets.
the Moon goes Eastward one point and.3. minutes: in.2. days.2. points and.6.
minutes. etc. Now when you list to know the very hour and time of her rising:
Look how many days the Moon is old, then put so many points, and so
many.3. minutes, and look what it amounts unto. Which for your better
understanding, I will show by example: and first of the Moons being South, by
every day of the age of the Moon. The Moon being one day old: is South
at.12. of the clock.48. minutes. To know what hour the Moon is South for
every day of the age of the Moon.

when the Moon and the Sun be both under one like degree and minute of any
sign of the Zodiac. Of the full Moon.
The full Moon is, when the Sun and the Moon be opposite (the one being
directly against the other, and just.6. signs asunder) as you may perceive at
the full Moon: for then when the Moon ryseth, the Sun sets: and when the
sun ryseth, the Moon sets. The quarters be, Quarter of the Moon. Ensample
of the moons rising and setting.
when the Sun and Moon be just.3. signs asunder (that is, just.90.
degrees.) Now when you list to know the very time of the Moons rising or
setting, look in your calendar what sign and degree the Moon is in: then
according to the rule of the shining, divide that into.2. equal parts, then
from the South, so shall you see at what hour the Moon ryseth, as for example
this. In March always the Sun is in Aries, then the Moon being in her first
quarter, then she is 6. hours to the Eastward of the Sun, then the Moon must
needs be in Cancer. Then shines the Moon in our Horizon 17. hours, then the
Moon is South at.6. of the clock, then she shines.8. hours and a half
after.6. of the clock. So that she sets at.2. of the clock and half an
hour past, then she ryseth in the day.8. hours and a half before.6. of the
clock, that is at.9. of the clock and half an hour past. Now at the last
quarter in March, then the Moon must needs be in Capricornus, then shines
the Moon but.7. hours, then the moon is South at.6. of the clock in the
morning, then the Moon rises.3. hours and a half before, that is, at.2. of
the clock and half an hour paste in the morning, then she sets by day
at.9. of the clock and half an hour paste, and this rule will serve for ever
without any great error. But yet there is a further matter for the exact
doing, The Moon has latitude.
which is the Latitude of the Moon from the head or tail of the Dragon, but
that is but a trifle in respect of much error, and therefore I will not
trouble you with that: yet there is one thing which I would Seafaring men
should consider, although a great nu^be expert in that, yet it is meet to be
spoken of, as this. The Sun being in Cancer or Moon in like manner, You
cannot know what a clock it is by the compass, the Sun being in the north
signs.
or in Gemini, or any time when the Sun or Moon has North declination, they
will set their compass before them, and when they see the Sun give an East
shadow, they will say that it is.6. of the clock, which and if the Sun be
in Cancer, it is not much paste five of the clock, and the more to the South
wards the more they do err. And in like case, the Moon being in Cancer when
they do see the Moon give an East shadow by their compass, they will say
the Moon is Weast, but they do not consider that the Sun and the Moon being
in Cancer, Error of ye shadow of the Moon^
comes so near our Zenithe or Vertical point right over our head, which
is the very height of their declination coming so near them, therefore they
must judge the East or Weast from the Pole or North star if they will judge
truly. Wherefore I do much commend the Equinoctial Dyals for the exact
truth, The Equinoctial dyals be very good.
for they can not know the truth by their compass, so that the Sun or Moon
or any other Star have any great declination being in Cancer: and you must
consider this in like manner. The Sun having North declination, the further
you do go to the North wards, the longer is your day, and the shorter is
your night, and toward the Southward, the shorter days and longer nights.
Now contrariwise, the Sun having South declination, the more to the
Northwardes, the shorter days and the longer nights, the further to the
Southwards, the longer days and shorter nights, As touching the length and
shortness of the day and night.
and under the Equinoctial, the nights and days all one what declination
soever the Sun has: but this rule that I have given you is for London, or
any other place that has that Latitude or elevation of the Pole Articke at.51.
or.52. degrees.

The fifth Chapter or rule, is of a table of declination commonly called of
Seafaring men, a Regiment of the Sun, exactly calculated for.4. years, and
will serve for.24. years, for every day of the month.
NOw shall follow a table of declination or Regiment for 4. years, being
calculated for England, and will serve all Europe without much error, or any
other country or place that has our Longitude, as the most part of Africa,
as Ginnie and those parts to the South wards, as far as the Antartick pole,
serving for every day of the month, very necessary for them that do use to
travel either by sea or by land, and is one of the principal points in
Navigations for long voyages, and the cause why I have written this Regiment for
the Sea, Every person cannot calculate ye Suns declination.
or tables of declination, is for that I do know that every person that goes
unto the Sea as master of a ship, has not capacity to calculate the Suns
declination by the place of the sun, although they have the tables of
declination, as the Ephemerides, or Martin Curtyse, otherwise called the art of
Nauigatio^. Wherefore I have written these notes, and Regiment or table of
declination for.4. years, and the first row toward your left hand, is the
days of the month: the next row is the degrees of declination that the Sun
has at the instant time of noone: and the third row is the odd minutes of
declination belonging to the degrees. Now there be two times in the year that
the Sun has no declinatio^, Two times in the year the Sun has no
declination. 1573.
as this. For the first year after Bissextilis, (which was in ye year of our
Lord.1573. the.11. day of March, at.4 of ye clock in the morning) the Sun was
upon the Equinoctial beginning North declination. And in like manner the 13.
day of September at noone, the Sun was upon the Equinoctial beginning South
declination, and also the second year after Bissextilis, which is the year of
our Lord.1574. the sun is upon the Equinoctial the.11. day of March,
between 10. and.11. of the clock before Noone, beginning North declination:
and in like manner the.13. day of September, at.6. of the clock in the after
Noone, beginning South declination. Furthermore in the third year after
Bissextilis, which is the year of the Lord.1575. the sun is upon the
Equinoctial the 11. day of March, between four and five of the clock in
the after Noone, beginning North declination: and so in like manner the.13. day
of September, at.12. of the clock at midnighte, beginning South declination.
Lastly, in the year of our Lord 1576. that is the year Bissextilis it self
upon the.10. day of March the sun shall be upon the Equinoctial between
10. and.11. of the clock at night, beginning North declination: and in like
manner the.13. day of September at.6 of the clock in the morning, beginning
South declination: Now these four years being expired, you must after the
year of Bissextilis, begin again at the year one, as here does follow for
example.

The Balla Stella or Cross staff: to take the height of the Sun or Star.

The sixth Chapter or rule shows, how to take the height of the Sun with the
cross staff or with the Astrolobe, and also how to find the true Meridian,
with other necessary matters.
TO take the true height of the Sun at the Sea, the best way is, to do it
with the cross staff: for that the Sea is moveable, and causes the Ship to
heave, and set little or much: And also upon the cross staff the degrees be
larger marked than the King or Astrolobe: and in a large instrument an error
is seen sooner and better than it is in a small instrument.

Now to take the height of the Sun, How to observe ye sun.
to know thy Altitude of the Pole above the Horizon, do this: First set the
Sun with a compass, to know when that the Sun comes near unto the
Meridian: as soon as you see that the Sun is come unto the South and by
East, then begin to take the height of the Sun with the cross staff in
this manner: Put the Transitory upon the long staff, then set the end of the
long staff close at the corner of your eye, To take ye height of the Sun
with the cross staff.
winking with your other eye, and removing the Transitory forwards or
backwardes, until you do see the lower end of it (being just with the
Horizon) and the upper end of it, (being just with the middle of the Sun)
both to agree with the Sun and the Horizon at one time: and so have you the
true height of the Sun: this done, Still observe ye same, until you see the
Sun at the highest and beginning to descend, and then have you finished. The
cause why the cross staffe] is best to take the height of the Sun unto 50,
degrees
Yet notwithstanding this is to be noted: that it is best to take the height
of the Sun with the cross staff, when the Sun is under 50. degrees in
heigthe above the Horizon, for two causes. The one is this: till the Sun
be.50. degrees in heigthe the degrees be largely marked upon the cross
staff, but after (the Sun being above.50. degrees high) they be lesser
marked. The other is, for that the Sun being under 50. degrees in height, you
may easily take the height, because you may easily see or view the upper end
and the nether end of the crosstaffe both at one time: but if it does
exceed.50. degrees, then by the means of casting your eye vpwardes and
downwardes so much, you may soon commit error, and then in like manner the
degrees be so small marked, that if the Sun does pass.50. or.60. degrees in
height, you must leave the cross staff and use the Mariners King, called by
them the Astralaby, which they ought to call the Astrolobe. To take ye height
of ye Sun with ye Astrolobe
Now to take the height of the Sun with the common King or Astrolobe, do
thus: The Sun being (as before is declared) near the Meridian or South,
observe it (until you have the greatest heygth thereof) in this manner: Hold
the King of the Astrolobe upon one of your fingers, How to correct your
Astrolobe if it does nor hang upright.
and turn the Alhidada up and down, until you see the shadow of the Sun
pearse or pass thorough both the sightes thereof, being sure that the
Astrolobe does hang vpryght, which you may prove in this manner: Look at
how many degrees and minutes the Alhidada does stand upon the Astrolobe,
then turn the Alhidada unto the same number of the degrees and minutes on the
other side of the Astrolobe, and then taking the height of the Sun again, if
it do agree as it did before, then the Astrolobe does hang upright: but if it
do not, then it does not hang upright. For knowledge of the true height of
the Sun (the Astrolobe not hanging upright) do thus: if the Astrolobe be truly
marked, mark the diversity, that being known, rebate from the greatest
height half the diversity, or else add unto the lesser height half the
diversity, and that shall be the true height of the Sun, although that the
Astrolobe does not hang upright.

The Astrolobe is best to take the height of the Sun at.60.70. or.80. degrees
in height. How to preserve your eyes when you touch the Sun with the cross
staff and have no glasses.

The diameter of the Sun is 30. or.31. minutes.


The Astrolobe is best to take the height of the Sun, if the Sun be very high
at.60.70. or.80. degrees, and the cause is this: the Sun coming so near
unto your Zenith, has great power of light, for to pearce the.2. sights of
the Alhidada of the Astrolobe, and then it is not good to use the cross
staff, for that the Sun hurts the eyes of a man, and besides that it is to
high to occupy the cross staff, (as before is declared) so that this way you
may very much preserve your eyes. If you have not glasses upon your staff (to
save your eyes in taking the height of the Sun) but be unprovided of them, do
thus: take and cover the Sun with the end of the transitory of the cross
staff, unto the very upper edge or brinke of the Sun (so shall you not need
to behold the brightness of it) and with the other end of the transitory to
take the horizon truly, and that being done, for that the Sun is.30. or.31.
minutes in diameter or breadth, therefore you shall rebate.15. minutes from the
altitude or heigthe of the Sun, and then that which shall remain shall be
the true height of the Sun from the center or middle of the Sun. And
furthermore there is some error in the taking the Sun or Star with the
Ballastel or cross staff, and that grows by this means: for that the true
center (which is the sight of the eye) is within in the middle of the eye, Some
error in the cross staff and how to reform it.
and not in the outside of the eye: so that the end of the long staff in the
setting of it unto the corner of your eye, does stand somewhat further out
than the sight of your eye, that is too say, that the sight of the eye is
somewhat further into the head, than the end of the staff does come:
wherefore you must pare away a little of the end of the staff, for some men's
uses more, and some men's uses less, for that it is according as you may set
the staff unto your eye, for some me^ need pare away little or nothing, and
some men must pare away.14. or.15. minutes as you may set the staff: because
some men's eyes be further into their head than other some men's are, and the
bones of some men's face stand further out than other some do. It is moreover
convenient to know the true meridian, or South, which you must do, either with
a good compass or with a perfyte dial or Needel: To get the true Meridian
upon the Land.
but if you be on the land this you may do: on a piece of timber, or any other
thing that stands fast, with a pair of compasses make a circle, then in the
middle or center where the foot of the compass did stand set a wire upright
(as circumspectly as you can) and then you may do this: look in the morning
(so it be on plain ground that you may see the horizon circle, without any
let) at the Sun rising, for the shadow of the wier, and there set a prick:
then at the setting of the Sun you shall set another prick, even at the
circumference of the circle, then divide that with your compasses even in.2.
pieces, and strike a straight line from the wier or center of the circle, to
the middle or divided prick, and that shall be true meridian. Or else (the wier
standing upright) first in the fore noone when the top of the wier does touch,
or is ready to come into the circumference or edge of the circle, there make a
prick: then in the after noone in like manner, at the very coming out or
touching of the wire, of the edge of the circle, there make an other prick
even with the coming out of the shadow: this done (as circumspectly as you
can) divide these 2. pricks in the middle, then as before is said, draw a line
from the center or wier, to the middle prick, and that shadow shall be your true
meridian. After another manner you may do this: look and watch when the wire
gives the shortest shadow, and there make a prick: then draw a line from
that prick to the wire, which shadow shall be the true meridian. And yet
furthermore, To know the true Meridian at the Sea, and also (if your compass be
varied) and to know how much they be varied.
for yt it is most convenient to know ye true Meridian at the Sea, because in
long viages going far unto the Westward or Eastward, the compass does vary:
to find the true Meridian do this. Set the Sun with your compass at her
rising or appearing above ye horizon, and then (knowing what point and part the
Sun does rise at) set the Sun with your compass at her setting or departing
under ye horizo^, and (that being known) you shall perfitly know, whether the
compass be varied, and how much: for ensample this, I do set the Sun at her
rising with the compass, and she does rise upon the East point: in like manner
also I do set the Sun with her compass at her setting, and do find her to set
West Northwest: so I do see the compass to be varied one point, that is to say,
the North point does stand North and by East. etc. And furthermore (for that
seldom times the Sun does rise and set clear by the means of the clouds,
and other impediments near the horizon) you may get the true Meridian thus: at
any time in the fore noone, first set the Sun with your compass, and then take
the true height of the Sun. Now you (knowing how many degrees ye Sun was high
at that point of the compass) may in like manner observe the Sun in the
afternoon, until you do find the Sun just at that height that it was in the
forenoone, marking at what point of the compass the Sun is, and so shall you
see perfitely whether the compass be varied or no, and also how much: for
ensample thus: I take the Sun upon the Southest point.20. degrees above the
horison, and then in the after noone I do observe the Sun until such time as I
do find the Sun just.20. degrees above the horizon again, and then I set ye
Sun with the compass and do find ye Sun to be at.20. degrees in height west
Southwest, so that I see ye compass to be varied one point, yt is to say the
North point does stand North and by East. etc. Another way also to know ye true
meridian, is by the Sun: that is, to set ye Sun with ye co^pas at her greatest
height above the horizon, and so you shall know whither yt co^pas be varied,
and how much: and look what is spoken of ye Sun by day, you may do the like by
night by any of the Stars yt you perfectly do know, To find the variation of
the compass in the night by ye Stars but not by the Moon*
doing as you do by ye Sun in all points: but you cannot do it so well and
truly by the Moon, by the means of the swiftness of ye moons motion in the
Zodiac, you may also find the variatio^ of ye co^pas by the North Star, as
thus: set ye North Star with the compass, if the North point do stand right
with the Star, then it is not varied, but if it does not stand right with
the Star, then it is varied: and that must be done when the.2. Stars of
Charles Waine called the points be right under, or right over the North Star,
but if that the Stars be West from the North Star, then the North Star is
the third part of a point unto the Eastward of the North pole. If the.2.
Stars of Charles Wayne called the poynters be due east from the North Star,
then the North Star is the third part of a point unto the westwarde of the
North pole.etc. This have I said because that sometime in sundry places, the
compass does vary, and especially in the sailing of long viages running East
and West, Medell not with your compass al though it be varied.
(called the Northeasting or Northwesting of the compass) therefore I would
not wish them to meddle with the mending of their compass or whetting of the
side of the needell to the end to make it to stand due North, but circumspectly
to awaite the altering of the compass, and what quantity it does alter: as
you may do very well, by the order before rehearsed, and then let your compass
alone: for although that it does vary.2. or.3. points, To sail by the compass
that is varied.
you may make account according to the variation as thus: I admit the Northwest
point stands due North, and my course is to go due West, I will occupy the
Southwest point in this case for the west point. And thus (by observation and
trying of my compass) I care not what point stands due North, for it is all
one, so that you consider what point stands North. And now furthermore, some
are of that opinion, that (by the Northeasting or Northwesting of the compass)
you may know the Longitude: but I am not of that opinion, for I admit that it
be so (as some do affirm) that the compass does vary, (as some have said)
that is, As touching Longitude to be found by the Northeasting or Northwesting
of the compass.
that you being.90. degrees unto the Westwarde (from the place your compass
was made at) your North point should stand Northeast: and in like manner you
being.90. degrees East, your North point should stand Norwest: then by that
order the compass should vary one point at.22. degrees and a half, and that
comes unto.450. english leagues (if you be near unto the equinoctial:)
wherefore no master or pilotte of a ship, does keep so simple account of the
ships way, but that he may know what distaunce he has unto any place better
than he shall know by the variing of the compass: and also whether it be so or
not yt the co^pas does keep any such proportion in the variatio^, I do refer
that unto them that have tried the experience thereof: for I for my part can say
nothing in that matter. Wherefore I cease from writing much thereof, although
the Sea men be very desirous to have some way to get the Longitude. But if it
be true that the compass does vary by that proportion, then it were very good
for them to practice that matter that should make any discovery unto the
Northwardes, for that the degrees be so short in those Paralels.

The seventh Chapter shows how to handle the declination of the Sun, to
know the altitude of the North pole above the horizon, (the height of the
Sun being truly taken and known in any place between the North pole and
the Equinoctial) so that the Sun be unto the Southwards of you, at the
taking of the Sun upon the Meridian.
YOu must consider by the regiment or table of declination (going before) that
the.11. day of March the Sun is equinoctial entering then the first point
of Aries (called the equinoctial of spring time) where she has no
declination. The.10. day of April the Sun enters into the first minute of
Taurus, then having declination to the Northwards. 11. degrees.30. minutes.
The.12. day of May, the Sun enters the first point of Gemini, having then
declination.20. The greatest declination of the Sun.
degrees.12. minutes. The.12. day of June the Sun enters into Cancer, where
he (making his greatest progress to the Northwards) has.23. degrees.28.
minutes of declination. But now in this our time, some do affirm it to be.23.
degrees and a half, but it lacks.2. minutes. The.14. day of Iulie, the Sun
enters into Leo coming dounwards to the Equinoctial, having.20. degrees.12.
minutes of declination. The 14. day of August the Sun enters into Virgo,
having declination.11. degrees.30. minutes. The.14. of September, the Sun
enters into Libra, (then being Equinoctial, and having no declination) which
is called the Equinoctial of Autumn or harvest, Equinoctial of Autumn.
where he begins his South declination. The.14. of October the Sun enters
into Scorpio, where his declination is.11. degrees.30. minutes. The.12. of
November the Sun enters into Sagittarius, his declination being.20.
degrees.12. minutes. The.12. day of December, the Sun enters the first
minute of Capricorn, where the Sun (making greatest progress to the
Southwards) has of declination.23. degrees and.28. minutes. From whence he
retourneth to the equinoctial again. The greatest declination to the South.
The.11. of January the Sun enters into Aquarius, where his declination is
20. degrees.12. minutes. The.10. day of February the Sun enters into the
first minute of Pisces, and has of declination.11. degrees.30. minutes.
The.11. day of March, the Sun retourneth to the self same place that it
departed from before, wherefore the Egyptians did paint the year like to an
adder biting her tail, The year is compared unto a ring or an adder biting
his tail.
and (not having the use of letters) they made a ring and named it annulus, as
it were annus, that is to say a year: because a ring does turn round in it
self as does the year. The height of the Sun being known, you (knowing
the day of the mooneth, and what year it is after the Bissextilis) must turn
to the day of the mooneth, in the regiment or table going before, where right
against the day of the mooneth you shall find the degrees of declination and
the odd minutes belonging to the degrees of declination following: that being
known (that is to say, the height of the Sun with the degrees and minutes of
the declination) if the Sun have North declination, The height of the Sun
being taken and known then how to handle the declinatio^ to know the height of
the pole.
you shall subtract or take away the Suns declination from the height of the
Sun, with the degrees and minutes: and then that which remains shall be the
true height of the Equinoctial which being known, pulling that su^me out
of.90. with the degrees and minutes, that which does remain shall be the true
height of the North pole above the horizon. But if that the Sun has South
declination, you shall add or put that declination unto the height of the
Sun, which shall show unto you the true height of the Equinoctial: of the
which su^me (being taken from.90.) that which does remain shall be the altitude
of the North pole above the horizon. For this is to be noted: look what height
the Equinoctial is above the horizon, it is equal or just so much between
the Zenith or vertical point and the North pole. In like manner: look how many
degrees and minutes are between the Equinoctial and your Zenith, just that
number of degrees and minutes is from the North pole, down to the horizon,
Things to be noted as touching the taking of the altitude of the pole.
which is the cause that you must pull the height of the Equinoctial, from the
horizon with the degrees and minutes. For that your Zenith is always.90.
degrees from the horizon as you see by this figure.



The.8. Chapter shows you how to handle the declination of the Sun, when
you are between the Equinoctial and the Sun: that is to say, the Sun
being to the Southwards or Northwards of you and the Equinoctial, or under the
Equinoctial: the height of the Sun being truly known or taken.
NOw furthermore if you be unto the South parts near unto the equinoctial, so
that the Sun have any great declination either to the Southwards or ye
Northwards, you being between the equinoctial and the Sun, when you have
taken the true height of the Sun with ye Astrolobe, to know the height of any
of the.2. poles do this: seek the declination of the Sun for that day with the
degrees and minutes, the declinatio^ being known and the height of the Sun in
like manner, then add ye declinatio^ of the Sun unto the height thereof, and it
will exceed or be more than.90. degrees, then again look how many degrees it
is more tha^.90. with degrees and minutes, A thing to be noted.
that shall be the true height of the pole toward that side that the Sun is:
because ye Equinoctial is ye number of degrees above.90. (which is your Zenith)
to the contrary part from the Sunwards. For (as I have said in ye chapter going
before and is general for ever) look what height soever ye Equinoctial be from
ye horizo^, that is the true distance between ye Zenith and the pole: in like
manner look what distance is between the Equinoctial and the Zenith, ye same
is the true distance between the horizon and the pole, that is to say, the pole
is so many degrees in altitude above ye horizo^. As it is a common saying (in
knowing how far we be unto the Southwards or Northwards) yt the pole artick
is so many degrees in altitude, or (as some will say) that we are in so many
degrees in Latitude: Altitude or Latitude is all one question in effect.
the question is all one in effect, although the one be called Altitude or
heigthe, and the other Latitude or wideness, yet it has one signification:
for as when you say altitude or height of the Pole, you mean the Pole is
raised so many degrees above the Horizon. So likewise when you say Latitude,
you mean you be so many degrees in wideness from the Equinoctial: for that
your Zenith or vertical point is so many degrees from the Equinoct. Moreover
if you chance to be right under ye Equinoctial, as you cannot say that you
have any Latitude, Being under the Equinoctial you have neither Latitude nor
altitude, for that the Equinoctial is your Zenith and the Poles your Horizon.
so likewise cannot you say that you have any Altitude, for that the two Poles
be then just with your Horizon, and in like manner the Equinoctial is your
Zenith or Vertical point. But when you will take the height of the Sun with
your Astrolobe, then look what declination the Sun has, either to the
Southwardes or Northwardes. Then put the declination of the Sun unto the
heigthe of the same, and the number will be just.90. degrees: if it lacks any
thing of.90. degrees, then it signifies that the Equinoctial lacks so much
of the Zenith, and so much just shall the pole be above ye Horizon toward that
part that you be in from the Sun wards. But contrariwise, if it does
exceed or be any thing more than.90. degrees, then (as before is declared) it
signifies that the Equinoctial is as much as that number (both in degrees and
minutes. Of your zenith being between ye Equinoctial and the Sun.
) On the contrary side, from the Sun wards, that is to say, your Zenithe
shall be between the Sun and the Equinoctial, and the Pole shall be so many
degrees or minutes above the Horizon, as is the distaunce between the Zenith
and the Equinoctial, toward that part or side that the Sun is on.
Wherefore I do think it necessary to give certain ensamples (and first take
this for an ensample. An ensample.
) Admit I do take the height of the Sun unto the Northwards.80. degrees
above the Horizon, and the Sun has declination unto the Northwardes.20.
degrees, to which I add or put the height, that is to say.80. degrees (being
the height of the Sun) and.20. degrees (being the declination of the Sun)
do make.100. from which I pull.90. away (which is my Zenith) and so there
remains.10. degrees. Wherefore you may conclude that the Equinoctial is.10.
degrees to the South part of your Zenith, An ensample where the pole is.10.
degrees above the Horizon.
and the Sun to be.10. degrees to the North part of your Zenith, so that the
North Pole is.10. degrees above the Horizon, as by this example it is declared.



And for the second ensample, admit I take the Sun unto the Northwardes.75.
degrees and.20. minutes above the Horizon, the Sun having North
declination.14. degrees 40. minutes, I then do add or put.14. degrees.40.
minutes unto.75. degrees.20. minutes, and those.2. joined together makes.9^.
degrees, whereof you may conclude that the Equinoctial is your Zenith, and
then the.2. Poles be with your Horizon, as by this example it does appear.



And now follows the.3. ensample. I admit the Sun be taken with the
Astrolobe.81. degrees and.15. minutes above the horizon, and the same has
South declination.22. degrees.35. minutes, An ensample.
wherefore I do add or put together.81. degrees and.15. minutes (being the
height of the Sun) and 22. degrees.35. minutes (being the declination) and
that makes.103. degrees.50. minutes: from which I take away.90. degrees (which
is my Zenith) so that there remains.13. degrees.50. minutes: so that you may
safely conclude that the Equinoctial is.13. degrees.50. minutes unto the North
parts of the Zenith, and then it must needs follow that the South pole is.13.
degrees.50. minutes above the Horizon, as by this ensample it is declared.



The nynth Chapter shows how to handle the declination of the Sun, when
you are beyond the Equinoctial, that is to say, between the South pole and
the Equinoctial: with certain ensamples both for the South pole and the North
pole.
ANd furthermore if you be unto ye Southwards beyond ye Equinoctial, as between
ye tropic of Capricorn and ye South pole, then to use the declination of ye
Sun to know ye height of the South pole or antartick pole by the height of the
Sun, there is no other matter in the doing thereof, To take ye Sun to the
Northwardes you being between the south Pole and the Equinoctial.
but whereas we (being unto the North parts) do add the South declination unto
the height of the Sun, and rebate the North declination from the height of
the Sun, so in like manner the contrary is to be used: that is to say, to
rebate the South declination from the height of the Sun, and to add unto the
height of the Sun the North declination. As for ensample. I admit the height of
the sun be taken.28. degrees above ye Horizon due North, and the declination of
the Sun be.21. degrees unto the Northwards, I do the^ add the declination of
ye sun which is.21 degrees unto the height of the Sun (being.28. degrees) which
makes.49. degrees, and so many degrees ye Equinoct. is above the Horizon unto
the Northwards, and then (as it is before declared) pull that sum out from.90.
degrees, and there remains.41. degrees, An ensample by taking ye South pole
41. degrees above the Horizon.
which is the distance between the Zenith and the Equinoctial, which always
is equal with the distance between the Pole and the Horizon: so that you may
conclude the South Pole to be raised.41. degrees above the Horizon. As by this
figure it is showed.



And furthermore, if the Sun have South declination, then (as before is
declared) you must subtract or take away the Suns declination from the height
of the Sun: as for ensample. The height of the Sun being taken at.50.
degrees.^0. minutes unto the North parts, and the Sun having.7. degrees
and.15. minutes of declination unto the southwards, from which height of the
Sun (for that you are unto the the Southwards beyond the Equinoctial) you must
rebate the declination which is.7. degrees and.15. minutes, and there
rests.43. degrees.15 minutes, for the true height of the Equinoctial, which
sum you must take out of.90. degrees, that done, there remains.46.
degrees.45. minutes, the true height of the South Pole above the Horizon,
otherwise called the Antarticke Pole, An ensample by taking ye north pole 60.
degrees above the Horizon.
as by ensample of this Figure is plainly showed.



Yet furthermore I do think it convenient to give you an ensample unto the
Northwardes, that you may perfectly know the true order of the working, both
for the North part and also the South part. Admit therefore I take the height
of the Sun due South, at.50. degrees above the Horizon, the Sun having then
north declination.20. degrees: Now (for as much as you have the north Pole
above the horizon) you must rebate the Suns declination from the height: so
that.20. degr. being taken away from.50. there rests.30. which is the height
of the Equinoctial above the Horizon, and that.30. being taken from.90. there
rests.60. So that you may boldly affirm the North Pole to be.60. degrees
above the Horizon, as by this figure following it is showed.



In like manner the Sun being taken at that height and due South, having the
like declination also to the Southwardes that it had before to the Northwardes:
that is to say, being.50. degrees in height, and having.20. degrees of
declination unto the South parts, you must add or put the declination of the
Sun unto the height of the same, and it makes.70. degrees which is the
height of the Equinoctial above the Horizon, this done, that.70. being taken
out of.90. there remains but.20. so that the North Pole is but.20. degrees
above the Horizon, as by the ensample of this figure it is showed.



For in handling of the declination the true height of any of the Poles is
known. Always having this consideraton, that if they have the North Pole
above the Horizon, they do always add or put too the height of the Sun, A
thing to be noted in ye handling of the Su^nes declination.
the South declination of the same. Or the Sun having North declination, they
pull away the Suns declination from the height thereof. Now contrariwise, if
the South Pole be above the Horizon, you must add the North declination unto
the height of the Sun, and take away the South declination from the height of
the same. Now to know which of the 2. Poles be above the Horizon, is a very
easy matter and is known.2. ways. How to know which of the.2 poles be
under the horizon.
For first if the North Pole be above the Horizon, you may know it by all the
Stars round about the Pole, as Charles Wayne and the Guardes, with such
other marks as be about the North Pole. Neither can you pass so suddenly
beyond the Equinoctial, but it must needs be known unto you, and then you must
use that kind of working with the Suns declination that in the chapter or
rule before is rehearsed: and also you may know it by the Arc or bearing of
the Stars and lyghtes round about you. Thus much have I said as touching
the Suns declination, The cause why english me^ have not traueled far beyond
the Equinoctial.
because I know that diverse English men would have traveled further beyond
the Equinoctial than they have done, but that they have not had the capacity
to handle the Suns declination when they have been beyond the Equinoctial,
that is to say, unto the South parts, having lost the marks about the North
Pole as the North Star and other, and as for the Stars of the South, they
have not been acquainted with them, but have beaten up and down along the
coast of Ginnie and Bynney, and there have spoiled and consumed their men
through the extraordinary heat of the Sun, An intemperate place for extreme
heat. Temperate clymate.
not knowing that in going furthrr to the South parts, they should have
brought themselves into a good temperate clymate again.

The.10. Chapter shows, how to handle the Suns declination unto the
Northvvards, where the Sun does not set under the Horizon, and also to take
the Sun at the lowest being due North.
FOr further use of the Suns declination, if you have any occasion to travel
unto the Northwardes or Southwardes more than.67. degrees of Altitude of any of
the.2. Poles, or if the sun have any great declination unto those parts that
you are in, the^ shall not the Sun go down under the Horizon in a long time, Of
being under either of ye poles.
after as you be in distance unto the North parts, for if you were right under
either of the.2. Poles of the world, then would not the Sun go under the
Horizon in half a year, so that there should be continually day: And now for
the handling of the Suns declination, to know ye height of the Pole, and to
take the Sun North at the lowest, Of taking the height of the sun due north at
the lowest.
do this: First with your cross staff observe the Sun at the lowest, taking
the true distance between the Horizon and the Sun, that being truly done,
look what declination the Sun has, then have you to consider, that except
the Sun be near unto her greatest declination, that is to say, in the latter
end of Gemini, or the beginning of Cancer) the Sun does decline little
in.24. hours: A thing worthy to be noted as touching ye suns declination.
but if the declination be very swift, you must seek the Suns declination
upon the day before, and the day after, half the diversity of which shall be
the Suns declination: for that the sun is at the angle of mydnight. The
Suns true declination being known, rebate the height of the same from the
declination of the Sun, and so shall you have the true content in degrees and
minutes that the Equinoctial is under the Horizon due North, and then pulling
that sum from.90. that which remains shall be the height of the pole above the
Horizon: for (as it is before declared) look what height the Equinoctial is
above the Horizon, that is equal the distance between the Pole and the Zenith,
and look what distance is between the Equinoctial and the Zenith, A thing to
be noted of the pole and the Equinoctial, the Zenith and the Horizon
the same distaunce is between the Pole and the Horizon in like manner, look
how deep under the Horizon the Equinoctial is unto the Northwards, so far
equal is the height of the Equinoctial unto the southwards. As for ensample:
admit I were unto ye Northwards of the North cape, the Sun being in her
greatest declination unto the Northwards, which is about the.11. day of
June.23. degrees and near a half this being known I take the Sun due North
at the lowest, The Sun taken due North at.6 degrees.
just.6. degrees above the Horizon, the declination being.23. degrees and.28.
minutes. Wherefore I rebate from that.6. degrees and so there remains.17.
degrees and.28 minutes. For the depth of the Equinoctial under the Horizon,
and then do I pull that sum from.90. and there remains 72. degrees.32.
minutes for the true height of the North pole above the Horizon, as by this
ensample it is declared.



By this ensample you may also know the true height of any of the.2. poles, and
how to observe the Sun at the lowest when the Sun comes nearest unto the
Horizon, as well as you may when the Sun is upon the Meridian at the greatest
height from the Horizon, which is very necessary for them that do occupy unto
the Northwardes of Saint Nicholas in Rousey, it is also very necessary for
them that would attempt any viages of discovery unto the Northwards, Of viages
for discovery to the Northwards either to the Eastward by Noua Zemla or to the
West ward by cape de Paramantia.
as into the East by Noua Zemla, or to the West by cape de Paramantia, on the
back side of the North part of the tail of America, other wise called the
back side of Vacula, which if it were attempted, there is no doubt but they
should find it nauigable either to the East part or to the West part: and I
am of this opinion, that the thing most feared in making their discoucry unto
the Northward, deserves not so greatly to be feared as they do make it, the
cause why they are so loath to go very far unto the Northwards is, for that it
is the frosen zone, but my opinion is, that in summer time it is not to be
feared, but the further unto the Northwardes the more temperate warm, by
means of the long continuance of the Sun: for as we see by common
experience that a thing once being made warm cannot suddenly be made cold,
neither is there doubt of any great cold until the Sun be unto the
Southwards of the Equinoctial: for I admit that a ship should sail unto the
Northward, and not stay until the North pole were elevated.80. degrees above
the Horizon, Of temperatenesse the pole being raised 80. degrees
I do think then they should find it very temperate and warm unto the middle
of September, for that by the space of.9. weeks together (that is to say from
the.10 day of May, unto the 12. day of July) the Sun should come no nearer unto
the Horizon due North than.10. degrees, or.30. degrees unto the South part
above the Horizon: and yet it is possible that it may be cold there until the
end of May, for that the Sun must have a time to make the air warm. For
like as a thing once being cold cannot be sodaynely made warm, so in like
manner a place being once made warm cannot be suddenly made cold. And
furthermore he that were in the Latitude of.80. degrees should have but a
short paralele: The length of the paralele at.80. degrees is but.1250. english
leagues.
for the whole compass of the earth and Sea going East and West too come
round about to that place again in the same paralele is but.1250. english
leagues, every league containing.3. english miles: So that in sailing of less
than 500. or.600. leagues, they might see whether it were nauigable or not.

The eleventh Chapter does show how you shall know the length of the day,
and to know how much the day is shortened or lengthened by the Suns
declination.
Now I think it convenient for Seafaring men too know the length of the day
in any place that they have occasion too go unto: for that they have occasion
too travel intoo all the climates and places, transporting them selves many
times quickly from one place unto another: and although the aunciente writers
have appointed certain climates, and other late writers in like manner have
made tables very exact for the longest or shortest day in any of those
climates, and other places, according to the elevation of the pole: yet have
they not opened any way unto them in gyuing any order for them to know
when the days is an hour longer or shorter, whereby they might at all times
know the length of the day, which notwithstanding is very necessary for them,
for that they be abroad under sail both night and day, and in like manner
for that they must keep account of hours and times exactly, How necessary it
is for a Seafaring man to know the length of the day.

Under the Equinoctial the day is always.12. hours long. The pole 16. degrees
44. minutes the day.13. hours long when it is at the lo^gest*


in as much as they ought to keep an account of the ships way: wherefore it
must needs be most necessary for navigations, to know the true time of the
Sun rising and setting, which you shall know by this means: first this is
not unknown, that under the Equinoctial the Sun is.12. hours above the
Horizon, and.12. hours under the Horizon, (what declination soever the Sun
has) so that there the Sun ryseth at.6. of the clock and sets at.6. of
the clock for ever. And where the pole is raised.16. degrees and.44. minutes,
there the longest day is.13. hours, (the Sun having her greatest declination
at.23. degrees.28. minutes) and the shortest day is 11. hours long: and then
look when the Sun has declined.23. degrees and a half either backwards or
forwards, for then the day is an hour longer or shorter and proportionably:
when the Sun has declined.11. degrees.44. minutes then it is half an hour
longer or shorter. The pole 30. degrees 48. minutes the longest day.14. hours
long.
etc. Moreover where the pole is elevated.30. degrees.48. minutes, there the
longest day is.14. hours and the shortest day is.10. hours long, the Sun
then rising at.5. of the clock and setting at.7. of the clock, and there when
the Sun has declined.11. degrees and.44. minutes from the Equinoctial.etc.
unto the greatest declination, then the day is an hour longer or shorter, The
pole 41. degrees 23. minutes the longest day.15. hours long.
and when the Sun has declined.5. degrees.52. minutes then the day is half
an hour longer or shorter.etc. Furthermore also, where the pole is raised.41.
degrees.23. minutes, there the longest day is.15. hours, and the shortest.9.
hours long, (the Sun having her greatest declination, and as the^ rising
at.4. of the clock.30. minutes, and setting at.7. of the clock.30. minutes)
so that there when the Sun has declined.7. degrees.49. minutes from the
Equinoctial, the day shall be an hour longer or shorter, and when it has
declined 3. degrees.54. minutes, the day shall be half an hour longer or
shorter.etc. And furthermore, The pole raised.49. degrees. 1. mi. then the longest
day is 16. hours long.
where the Pole is raised.49 degrees one minute, there the longest day is.16.
hours, and the shortest.8. hours long, the Sun rising at.4. of the clock,
and setting at.8. of the clock, so that there when the Sun has declyned.5.
degrees.52. minutes from the Equinoctial, then shall the day be an hour
longer or shorter. And when the Sun has declyned.2. degrees.56. minutes,
then the day shall be half an hour longer or shorter.etc. Yet furthermore,
where the Pole is raised.54. degrees.30. The pole raised.54. degrees. 30. mi. then
the longest day is 17. hours long.
minutes, there the longest day is.17. hours, and the shortest 7. hours long,
the Sun then rising at.3. of the clock 30. minutes, and setting at.8.
and.30. minutes: where when the Sun has declyned.4. degrees and.41. minutes
from the Equinoctial, to the greatest declynatio^, the day is an hour longer or
shorter, and when she has declined.2. degrees.21. minutes, the day is half an
hour longer or shorter, etc. The pole raised.58. degrees. 27. mi. the longest day
is.18. hours long
Where also the Pole is raised.58. degrees.27. minutes, there the longest day
is 18. hours long, and the shortest but.6. and there when the Sun has
declined.3. degrees.55. minutes from the equinoctial, then the day shall be an
hour longer or shorter: and when the Sun has declyned.2. degrees lacking.2.
minutes, The pole raised.61. degrees. 18. mi. the longest day is.19. hours long
then the day shall be half an hour longer or shorter. Furthermore also, where
the pole is raised.61. degrees.18. minutes, there the longest day is.19. hours
long, and the shortest but.5 hours: then shall the Sun rise at.2. of the
clock.30. minutes, and set at.9. and.30. minutes, and there when the Sun has
declined.3. degrees and.21 minutes from the Equinoctial, then shall the day
be an hour longer or shorter, etc. Furthermore, where the Pole is raised.63.
degrees.22. The Pole 63. degrees. 2. mi. the longest day.20. hours long.
minutes, there the longest day is.20. hours long, and the shortest but.4.
hours, then shall the Sun rise at two of the clock, and set at ten of
the clock, and when the Sun has declyned two degrees, and fifty six
minutes from the Equinoctial unto the greatest declination, then shall the day
be an hour longer or shorter etc. The pole raised.64. degrees.49 minutes the
longest day 11. hours long.

The pole 65. degrees the longest day.22. hours long.


Now where the pole is raised.64. degrees.49. minutes, there the longest day
shall be.21. hours long, and the shortest but.3. hours: And there when the
Sun has declined but.2. degrees.36. minutes from the Equinoctial unto the
greatest declination, the day shall be an hour longer or shorter. Where also
the pole is raised.65. degrees, there the longest day shall be.22. hours and
the shortest but.2. hours long, and when that the Sun has declyned but.2.
degrees and.20. minutes from the Equinoctial etc. then the day shall be an
hour longer or shorter. The pole 66. degrees 20. minutes the longest day.23.
hours long. The pole 66. degrees 32. minutes then the Sun shall not set unto
them.
etc. And where the pole is raised.66. degrees.20. minutes the longest day
shall be.23. hours long and the shortest but one hour long, and then when
that the Sun has declined but.2. degrees.8. minutes, then the day shall be
an hour longer or shorter, and then where that the North pole is raised.66.
degrees and.32. minutes, there it is 24. hours long, for that when the Sun
has her greatest declination unto the Northwardes, then at midnight you shall
see half the Sun, and then when that the Sun has the greatest declination
unto the South parts, then you shall see but half the Sun at noone, and then
in the going but 15. miles further unto the Northwards, that is, but one
quarter of a degree, The Sun clean above the Horizon due North and not to
appear above the Horizon South at noone.
then the Sun shall be clean above the Horizo^ at the due North, and not
seen unto the South at noone above the Horizon, the Sun having her greatest
declination to the South, and then the day shall be an hour longer or shorter
when that the Sun has declined one degree.57 minutes from the Equinoctial
and so forth unto the greatest declination. And thus much have I said as
touching the length of the day, whereby you may know at all times the true
length of the day in any Latitude between the Equinoctial and the elevation
of the pole at.66. degrees and 32. minutes, by knowing how many degrees the
Sun is declined, and that you may know on every day by the regiment going
before, having this consideration, To know the length of the day at any time
in any place. What the day is.
that if the Sun being upon the Equinoctial, and having no declination,
that then in any Latitude the day is always just.12. hours long. And you
must note this, that it is called the day from the rising of the Sun unto the
setting of the same under the Horizon and not from day light unto day light.
For before the Sun rise and after that the Sun is set it is counted for no
parcel of the day but it is called the day light. And furthermore, the day
light will appear by that time that the Sun does touch the.17. degree of the
Horizon before the Sun rising, and also the day light will not be clean gone
until the Sun be more than.17. degrees under the Horizon: for as you may
perceive here with us at London that when the Sun has her greatest
declination unto the Northwards in June that the day light remains all night,
for that the Sun goes not under the Horizon, but.15. degrees and.2. minutes.

The twelfth Chapter is of the North Star.
AS touching the North Star I say but little thereof for that it is
sufficiently declared in the art of navigations, the Star has Longitude unto
the sign of Gemini, and from the poles of the world in the sign of Aries,
which Star stands upon the tippe of the tail of vrsa minor or little Bear,
and has Latitude from the line Eclipticke.66. degrees 30. minutes, The North
Stars declination*
and declination from the Equinoctial.96. degrees or there aboutes. Here
follows the note, by the guardes to know whether the North Star be above
the pole, or under the pole, and how many degrees and minutes. etc.

North star posse Guardes

North The Guardes in the North, the Star is.3. degrees under the Pole.

North east The Gards in the northeast the North star is.3. degrees and a half
under the Pole.

East The Guardes in the East the North Sarre is one degree and a half under
the Pole.

Sooth east The Guardes in the South east the North Star is half a degree
above the Pole.

Sooth The Guardes in the Southe the North Star is 3. degrees above the Pole.

Sooth west The Guardes in the Southwest the Star is.3 degrees and a half
above the Pole.

West The Guards in the West the star is one degree and a half above the Pole.

North west The Guardes in the Northwest the Star is half a degree under the
Pole.



The thirtenth chapter does show you by the sailing upon the quarter of your
compass, in how far sailing you do raise a degree, and what you do depart
from the Meridian, and in the end there is a Demonstration thereof.
FUrthermore, because there be some that desire to know the alteration of a
point: to this end, that in running of one point, they may raise or lay a
degree sooner in one than in an other: as in ye sailing south or North, In going
southwards you raise ye equinoctial and lay ye pole: in going to ye northwards
raise ye pole and lay the Equinoctial.
keeping one Meridian they raise or lay the Pole. As this for your example. In
going to the North, you do raise the Pole and lay the Equinoctial:
Contrariwise, going toward the South, you lay the Pole, and raise the
Equinoctial. But in sailing or going East or Weast, you do neither alter your
Pole nor Paralele but only your Meridian. Whereas in sailing of any other
point, you do alter both your Pole and Paralele, and also your Meridian.
Wherefore I will open unto you (in sailing upon one of the quarters of the
compass) what every point does raise or lay one degree, in how far sailing,
and how many miles you be departed from the place you departed from, and what
space you be departed from your Meridian. Of english leagues and spanish
leagues.
But here is one thing to be noted (as I suppose) in the most part of cards
they allow for every degree, but.17. leagues and a half: your cards be most
commonly made in Lishborne, in Portugal, in Spain, or else in France. But as
I take it, we in England should allow.60. miles to one degree: that is,
after.3. miles to one of our English leagues, wherefore.20. of our English
leagues should answer to one degree, for that.3. of our miles will not make
one of their leagues. And because they make their acountes by their leagues in
the cards and not by ours, therefore I will show you by our English miles.
An English mile conteyneth.1000. pases, A mile contains 1000. pases and every
pase.5. foot
and every pase.5. foot, and every foot.12 inches. Now some think that a
pase can not be.5. foot, but a pase Geometrical is.2. reasonable steps, for
it can not be a pase until the hinder foot be removed forwards, and those 2.
steps will contain.5. foot, and so may any man endure to go at pleasure.
But now to our purpose. For the sailing of one quarter of the compass, this
is to be noted. First yt in sailing directly south or North, you do raise or
lay the Pole a degree in. 60. miles going. A degree is 60. miles or 20.
english leagues.
In the altering of one point from the South or North in.61. miles: and you be
departed from the line of East and Weast, or the Meridian.12 miles. In altering
of the second point you raise a degree in sailing of.65. miles: and depart
from your Meridian.25. miles. In altering of the.3. point, you do raise or
lay one degree in sailing.72. miles and a.9. part: and are departed from your
Meridian.40. miles. A note to know in how far sailing you do raise or lay a
degree in the sailing by any one point of the compass,
Moreover in altering of the 4. point, you do raise or lay a degree in the
going of.85. miles: and depart from your Meridian.60. miles. In altering of
the.5. point or wind, you raise a degree in the sailing of.108. miles: and
depart from your Meridian.90. miles. In sailing by the 6. point, you raise or
lay one degree in.157. miles: and depart from your Meridian line, 145. miles.
Last of all, in sailing by the.7. point or wind, you do raise a degree in
going of.308. miles, and depart from your Meridian line.302. miles, and after
this manner you may consider of the other three quarters of the compass. But
if you require to know the raising or laying of a degree by the leagues of the
cards: that is, at.17. leagues and a half: then read the art of Navigations,
and there shall you find how many degrees you be departed fro your Meridian,
and also from the place that you departed from: and yet that serves for no
other place but only for under the Equinoctial, for he that makes account of
it in any other place, shall be deceived. For ever as you go to any of the.2.
Poles, your degrees be still shorter and shorter till such time as your Meridian
meet under the two Poles, whereof I entreat in the.16. Chapter. For the better
understanding of ye things aforesaid, look on this figure following.



The.14. Chapter teaches to know how far any land is off from you, knovving
but the distance between any two places: whither you run along by the land,
or directly to the shore or otherwise: with other necessary things.
FOr that I know it very necessary and profitable for Seamen, to know how
near or far they be into the Sea, and how near to the land, I will entreat
thereof for diverse considerations: And first, because in running along the
land there may be danger, which may be such a certain quantity into the sea,
that they may go both within them and with out them. And also in like manner,
for that being at one distance from the land, the land may rise in such a
shape or fashion, whereas being nearer, the land may rise in another form or
fashion: for being far off, you shall see the hills within the land, and being
near, the hills or cliffes near unto the Sea coast may take away the sight
of the land within. A note for the land rising in diverse shapes or fashions.
Furthermore also, it is very necessary to know in what fashion the land does
rise upon diverse points of the compass, as often as the fashion of the land
does alter, and to note it in some book for remembrance. First by what points
of the compass, To know how far the land is from you.

Where two lands be but one point asunder.


then the fashion, and last at how far off. etc. For knowledge how far off
you be from the land, you may have this help, if there be any.2. places by the
Sea coast, whereof you know the distance, how many leagues or miles the one
is from the other. In going along the coast you shall set them up with your
compass, and when you are thwart of them, if they be but one point asunder,
you shall be.5. times the distance between them from the land or shore. If the
two places be two points asunder, then the distance unto the shore shall be
two times and a half the distance. If.3. points asunder, then the distance
unto the shore shall be once the distance and a half. If.4. points asunder,
the same distance shall be between you and the shore, that is between the
two marks. If.5. points asunder, then is it unto the shore but.2. third
parts of the distance between the.2. places. If.6. points asunder, (you being
thwart of one of them) then shall the distance unto the shore be, not half the
distance between the.2. places. And in all these cases before rehearsed, the one
place must be thwarte of you, the other must be a head or stern of you: and so
it is exact and true. As for ensample this: I (going alongest by any coaste)
do know before hand how the one place does bear from the other, besides this
also I know the distance, that is to say, how many leagues they be a sunder.
As for ensample, the.2. places assigned bear East and West the one from the
other, I then (knowing that they be 3. leagues asunder) when I have brought one
of the places South or north of me, do set them with my compass, the one being
North of me, and the other bearing North and by cast that is one point asunder:
Now the distance unto the shore, Of.2. places to be one point asunder.
being.5. times the distance between the.2. places which be.3. leagues asunder,
I know the shore to be.15. leagues from me, which (if the places were but one
league asunder) should be but.5. leagues from the shore. To be two points
asu^der.
Furthermore if the places be.2. points asunder, that is to say, the one
North, and the other North North, then shall the distance unto the shore be 7.
leagues and a half from me. Whereas if the.2. places were but a league asunder,
it should be but.2. leagues and a half unto ye shore. And furthermore, if the
places be.3. points asunder, 3. points asunder.
that is to say, the one North, and the other Northeast and by north, the
distance unto the shore shall be.4. leagues and a half: whereas if the.2. places
were but one league asu^der, unto ye shore it should be but a league and a
half. If.4. points asunder, 4. points asunder.
that is to say, if the one place be due North, and the other place Northeast,
the^ it is unto the shore.3. leagues just. If but one league asunder then but
one league unto the shore. 5. points asunder.
Moreover if the 2. places be.5. points asunder, that is to say, the one north
and the other Northeast and by East, then ye distance unto the shore shall be
but.2. leagues: whereas if the.2. places were but one league asu^der unto the
shore should be but.2. miles. Last of al, if the.2. places be.6. points
asunder, that is to say, 6. points asunder.
the one north, and the other east northeast, then it shall not be a league and
a half unto the shore. etc. But if you come directly to ye land wards, having
no cause to be thwart of none of those known places, then to know how far you
be from the land you must do as is by the places before spoken of. For if you
go in due north the one place being north and by west, and the other north and
by east: then (the.2. places being 3. leagues asunder) you shall be.7. leagues
and a half from the shore: Of going or sailing right into ye shore.
so that if you run into the shore due north until they be.4. points
asunder, that is to say, the one north northwest, and the other north
northeast, then it shall be unto the shore.3. leagues and 3. quarters. And
furthermore, you still running in due north, till the.2. places be.6. points
asunder, that is to say, the one place to be northweaste and by north, and the
other place to be northest and by north, the distance unto the shore shall
be.2. leagues and a quarter. And again, if you run in due north, until they
be.8. points asunder, that is to say, the one place northweast, and the other
northeast: then the distance unto the land or shore shall be but half the
distance between the.2. places, that is, but one league and a half. Lastly, if
you run to the land due north, until the.2. places be.10. points asunder, that
is to say, the one place northweast and by weast, and the other northeast and
by east, then the distance unto the shore shall be but one third part of the
distance between the.2. places, that is, but one league from the land. etc.
Thus much have I said as touching the bearing of the land from you, by the
points of the compass, to know the distance or how far the land is of: which
is very necessary for Seamen to know for diverse considerations as I said
before. A way to know how one hedland bears of another.
If now therefore you know not how one headland does bear from another, do
thus: In running along the coast, when you see the appearing of any land one
before another, set them with your co^passes, and look how they bear from
you, by what point of the compass, and so shall you know justly how the one
land does bear or lie from the other. And by this order you may correct your
plats, by doing this, as often as you see.2. notable places together: as
Islands, rocks, headlands, mouths of havens, sands, or what soever else be
worthy of noting, this done, as often as you do see them together, set them
with your compass, and that will show you most certainly, that so they do bear
the one from the other. You may know the distance in like manner between them,
if you know your ships way, as thus, when you first see any.2. places
together, as.2. headlands, To know the distance at the Sea between any.2.
headlandes.
or.2. Islands, having set them with your compass, and knowing how the one
bears from the other then, for that you will not come near unto them, you do
hale off from the land, until that you have brought your self far enough
off at your discretion, and when you be thwart of the first headland, set the
other land, and consider how it ^eareth from you: then reckon your ships way,
how many leagues the ship might go until you come thwarte of the other
headlande, keeping your course along as the.2. headlandes bear, and so shall
you both know the distance between the.2. places, and also how far you be
off from them. In like manner, To know how far it is unto the land an other
way.
having consideration of the distance between the other places that you have
observed both by your compass and also by the ships way, you may know how
far it is to the shore, going right to the land wards, by your cross
staff, although you know not the distance between any two places. As thus:
take the wideness between any two places with your cross staff, bearing
right to the land wards, and then remove the cross staff or transitory
half the length of the transitory, that is to say, the end next unto you,
and then by running in till the.2. ends of the transitory do agree with the
two marks, you shall be half way to the shore: then look how far the
ship has gone in that time, for the same distance is unto the land from the
ship. But if you remove the transitory but a quarter ye length of the
transitory to youwards, then at the place where the end of the transitory does
agree with the.2. marks, shall be one quarter of the distance between the
shore and you at the first observation: and it shall be.3. times that quantity
unto the shore. etc. And to know the ships way, To know the ships way.
some do use this which (as I take it) is very good: they have a piece of wood
and a line to vere out over board, with a small line of a great length which
they make fast at one end, and at the other end and middle, they have a piece
of a line which they make fast with a small thread to stand like unto a
crowfoote: for this purpose, that it should drive a stern as fast as the
ship does go away from it, always having the line so ready that it goes out
as fast as the ship goes. In like manner they have either a minute of an
hour glass, or else a known part of an hour by some number of words, or
such other like, so that the line being vered out and stopped just with that
time that the glass is out, or the number of words spoken, which done, they
hale in the logge or piece of wood again, and look how many fadome the
ship has gone in that time: that being known, An english league.2500
fadome.

A Spanish league.2857. fadome.


what part of a league soever it be, they multiply the number of fadomes, by
the portion of time or part of an hour. Whereby you may know justly how many
leagues and parts of a league the ship goes in an hour. etc. For an English
league does contain.250. fadome. And a spanish or portingale league does
contain.2857. fadomes. etc.

The fiftenth Chapter or rule treats of the Longitude. etc.
Now some there be that be very inquistiue to have a way to get the longitude,
but that is to tedious. For this they must consider, that the whole frame of
the firmament is carried round from the east to the west in.24. hours, so as
there remains neither light nor mark, but goes round, saving only the.2.
poles of the world, and these.2. stand always fast. But (as I said before in
the.9. rule) of him that going South or North does raise or lay the pole,
Altering ye time of rising and setting of the lights.
and in like case of the Equinoctial altering his paralele, and causing the
light of the firmament to alter the time of their shining or abiding above our
Horizon: so he that goes directly east or weast, does neither raise nor lay
the pole, so that still the lights of the firmament does make one manner of arch
according to their latitude or declination: but the going East or Weast does
alter the Meridian, causing ye planets to have their aspects at another hour or
time, altering ye time of the changes of ye moon and also the time of the
Eclipses: Altering the aspects.
which is necessary for all travelers by Sea or by land. Therefore I thought
it needful to be spoken of: for as countries have Latitude from the pole so
in like manner they have appointed Longitude. Now therefore you may get the
Latitude with instruments, Of Latitude and Longitude.
but the Longitude you must bring from another place, which you can do but with
a globe or else a map or card, and then you must measure from the Meridian of
the Canarie Islands, otherwise called the fortunate Islands. And in our
Latitude of London every.555. miles which contains.15. 15. degrees is an
hour of time and at London it is.555. miles.
degrees will answer to one hour of time: and under the Equinoctial.900.
miles to.15. degrees: the degrees be as long as the degrees of Latitude, but
toward the pole fewer and fewer till they come to nothing under the.2. poles.
And now.37. miles which are at London, will answer to one degree of our
Latitude at.51. or.52. degrees of elevation of the pole, but the cause why the
Longitude was fetched from the Canarie Islands I know not, but it was as I
suppose, Longitude begins at the Cannary Ila^ds
because it was then the westermost place then known: for Ptholemeus was the
first that ordained that rule.

Now furthermore because you shall know the better, I would draw out certain
of the cheifest places about this Realm of England, both their Longitude and
Latitude, by which you shall know what manner of Arch the Sun with the other
lights does make, and also by the Longitude you may know at what time the
Moon with any of the Planets does make any aspect. Besides this, the Eclipses
of the Sun or Moon, with the change, quarters, and full Moon, by a true and
exact Ephemerides through all England to know the very true hour and minute
of the time of the diameter: To know the true time of the aspects of the Moon.
considering for what Longitude or place your Almanacke was made. And now to
get the Longitude, you may do it at the time of the Eclipse of the Moon, for
that the Eclipses of the Moon be general, so that she being above your
Horizon in any place upon the superficial parts of the earth or Sea,
considering (as I said before) by your Almanacke, at that time when the Eclipse
should happen, the very hour and minute, knowing also the place that your
Almanacke was made for: that done, according to this rule, with a precise
instrument you shall take the alteration of the time with the hour and minute
of the Eclipse. And furthermore you might know your Longitude with the
Ephemerides, by the conjunction of the Moon with other fixed Stars, if it
were not for one great infirmity, and that is the paralex of the Moon, which
the semidiametre of the earth does cause, by the neerenesse of the Moon unto
the earth: wherefore I would not any Sea men should be of that opinion that
they might get any Longitude with instruments. The Longitude is not to be
gotten with instruments on ye Sea.
Therefore let no Sea men trouble themselves with any such rule, but
(according to their accustomed manner) let them keep a perfect account and
reckening of the way of their ship, whether the ship goes to lewards or
makith her way good, considering always what things be against them or with
them: as tides, currents, winds, or such like. As for the rule of Longitude, it
follows in the next Chapter.

The.16. Chapter shows how many miles will answer to one degree of
Longitude, in every several Latitude, between the Equinoctial and any of the
a poles: with the demonstration for that purpose: and the diversities of
aspectes of the Moon.
NOw by this rule shall I teach you how many miles will answer to one degree, for
every several Latitude to any of the.2. poles either articke or antarticke.
And first, under the Equinoctial (the.2. poles being even with the Horizo^)
60. miles do answer to one degree, as I said in the.15. rule. And now shall
follow the rest. Where the poles be raised.21. degrees.56. miles belongs to
one degree of Lo^gitude. Now ye poles being raised.29. degrees.52. miles do
answer to one degree. The poles being raised.36. degrees.48. miles do answer to
one degree. The pooles.42. degrees raised.44. miles goes to one degree of
Longitude. The Pole raised.57. degrees.32. miles to one degree. The Pole
raised.62. degrees.28. miles to one degree. The Pole raised.66. degrees.24.
miles to one degree. The Pole raised.70. degrees.20. miles to one degree. The
Pole raised.74. degrees.16. miles to one degree. The Pole raised.78.
degrees.12. miles to one degree. The Pole raised.82. degrees.8. miles to one
degree. The Pole raised.86. degrees.4. miles to one degree. The Pole being
raised to the highest at.90. degrees (being then your Zenith) there all the
Meridians meet.

A demonstration to know how many miles will answer unto a degree in
Longitude in every several latitude between the equinoctial and any of the two
Poles
This demo^stration does show you, how many miles will answer to a degree,
for every several Altitude of ye Pole in the half circle is marked ye
elevation of ye Pole: in the line of Diameter, or right line, is marked the
miles answering every degree: and to know how many miles will answer unto one
degree, first lay ye thread unto the elevation of the pole that you do require
ye number of miles unto, one degree: and then the just length of the threde
being marked, lay the threde unto the line of Diameter, or right line, which
is the line of miles, and then you shall see at that place is the number of
miles unto one degree etc. Now you must consider that every hour of time in
the changing of the Moon or of the Eclipses you must allow.15. degrees, 15.
degrees answers unto an hour of time.
every degree in miles as you do see in your Latitude of the country, as thus:
those places yt be to the Westwards of your town, place or country by.15.
degrees the Moon shall change rather with them tha^ with you by one hour,
because that they shall touch your Meridian before theirs by one hour. And if
the town or place be to the Eastwards of you by.15. degrees, then shall the
Moon change rather with you than with them by one hour, as for an ensample
thus, with us at London, the.xx. day of May 1574. the Moon shall change
at.12. of the clock at Noone.5. minutes. Now to the Westwards as far as
Lishburne in Portingall the Moon shall change that same day at.11. of the
clock.8 minutes, the Longitude being thereof from the Canarie Islands.5.
degrees.36. minutes. Now to the Eastwards, that same day at noone, the Moon
shall change at one of the clock.12. minutes, because that they have
Longitude.36. degrees.40. minutes from the Cannary Islands and then by this
account.7. degrees and a half will answer to half an hour, and then.3.
degrees and a quarter will make a quarter of an hour, and then.9. miles and a
quarter will make one minute of time with us at London in our Latitude, so by
this rule you may know at what time and minute the Eclipses or chaunges of the
Moon do happen, knowing for what place your Almanacke was made, for commonly
we here in England do make them for the city of London. Thus much have I
said as touching the true time of the change of the Moon, for that some
people (as I have said before in the.3. chapter) do contemn and say, why do
they not give or make rules for ever to know the hour and minute of the
change, full, To know ye true time of ye change and quarters of the moon is a
question astronomicall, geometrical and cosmographicall.
and quarters of the Moon? And yet they be utterly void of any knowledge in
the Mathematical Science, whereby they might know the true time of the
change of the Moon: For it is a question Astronomicall, to know the Moons
motion: a question Geometrical, to know the true time of the aspectes, or
measure between the Sun and the Moon: and thirdly, it is a question
Cosmographicall, to know the true Longitude of the place he is in, at the time
when the Moon changes. etc. Now follows the next rule which shall treat
of Longitude and Latitude.

The.17. Chapter or rule treats of the Longitude and Latitude of certain of
the most notable places in England: and also how long the Moon does change
at the one town before the other: with the diversity of the longest day in
Summer, from South Hampton to the Northermost part in Scotland.
Now in this rule follows the Longitude and Latitude of the most part of the
principal places in England. The Southermost place in England, is the Lizarde
in Cornwall: the Longitude thereof is.15. degrees.5. minutes: the Latitude 50.
degrees.45. minutes. S. Michaels Mount has in Longitude.14. degrees.20.

Edenborow in Scotland, Longitude.19. degr. 50. minutes: Latitude.57. degr. 0.
minutes. Now by the Longitude and Latitude you may know the length of the day
both in Summer and in Winter, with the perfect hour and minute of the changes
of the Moon, and how long the Moon does change at one town before another,
through the whole realm of England. And now in order as I have begone before, I
will show you the distance of time. To know ye diversity of the time of the
change of the moon through all England.
And first at S. Michaels Mount, the Moon changes rather than at London by
25. minutes. Rather at Falmouth than at London by.20. mi. At Plimmouth rather
than at London by.18. min. At South Hampton rather than at London by 5. minutes.
At Portsmouth rather than at Lon. by.4 minutes. At Rye later than at London by
one minute and.. At Dover later than at London by.6. minutes and more. At
Canterbury later than at London by.5. minutes. At Sandwich later than at
London by.6. minutes. Grauesend later than at London by one minute and a half.
Bristow rather than at London by.11. minutes. Haruard rather than at London by
12. minutes. Saint David's head rather than at London by 19. minutes. Oxforde
rather than at London by.4. minutes. Cambridge later than at London by.. parts
of a minute. Norwich later than at London by.5. minutes and more. Lincoln later
than at London by.2. minutes. Welshpoole rather than at London by.16. minutes.
Westchester rather than at London by.10. minutes. Hull later than at London
by.4. minutes. York later than at London by.. of a minute. Cockermouth rather
than at London by.12. minutes. Carelyle rather than at London by.9. minutes.
Newecastle later than at London by.2. minutes. Barwicke later than at London by
three minutes and more.

The cause why that it is called the change of the Moon, is for that the
Moon changes the sides of the Sun, for before the change the Moon is on
the West side of the Sun: and after the change, the Moon is on the East side
of the Sun. etc. Now in like manner, I think it necessary to be spoken of
the difference of the longest day in Summer, in every several Latitude,
through the whole Realm of England from the Southermost part, called the
Lizard, to the Northermost part in Scotland: and this is called the day, from
the Sun rising or appearing above the Horizon.

To know ye length of the longest day through all England and Scotland.
First at South Hampton the longest day is.16. hours long.26. minutes, the
shortest.7. hours.54. minutes. At London.16. hours.30. minutes longest.7.
hours.30. minutes shortest. At Lincoln.16. hours.45. minutes longest.7. hours
15. minutes shortest.

At York, the longest.17. hours, the shortest.7. hours. Newcastle the
longest.17. hours.12. minutes, the shortest.6. hours.48. minutes. Barwicke,
the longest.17. hours.30. minutis, the shortest.6. hours.30. minutes.
Edenborow in Scotland, the longest day in Summer.17. hours.45. minutes, the
shortest day.6. hours.15. minutes. Now Catnes point being the northermost part
in all Scotland, the Pole being raised to.62. degrees, there the longest day
is.19. hours.30. minutes, the shortest day.4. hours.30. minutes. Now this
you do consider, look what the longest day does contain, look what that
lacks of.24. hours, that is the shortest Winter day. etc.

The eightenth Chapter or rule shows how to sail by the Globe.
NOw to sail by the Globe, it is convenient to be spoken of. For that
generally the most part of the seamen make their account as though the earth
were a platform. For they do not consider that the earth is a Globe, and that
the Meridians do grow narrower and narrower toward the.2. poles, for it is
impossible to draw the face of the earth and the Sea true upon a platform,
for if you will describe the land true, You cannot draw the Land and sea true
upon a flat thing.
then shall not the Sea be true, for as you go toward the North parts, your
Meridians grow together, so as your lines or points be according to the art
of Hydrography, for the Sea shall be broader to the North parts than it is.
Now and if you would describe the Sea true, with lines, courses, distances,
havens and dangers, then should your land be broader to the North parts
than it is. As for ensample, thus: England and Scotland being both one
Island, To make a Sea plat or card.
in all your Cards of Navigations, the North part of Scotland is drawn much
bigger than it is, for otherwise the lines of South and North should not be
according to the treating of the land, for if you view it well, you shall
find the North end of Scotland much more in distance than it is. As you may
see in measuring it by the trunk of your card there. For your better
understanding, I will show you the compass of the earth under sundry
Paralels or Circles, how many miles the earth does contain in compass. The
compass of the earth.
First, under the Equinoctial (where the earth is at the greatest compass)
in going directly East or Weaste, that is, by a right line over Sea and
Land, the two Poles being even with your Horizon: you have.21600. miles to
come to the place you departed from. The compass of the earth under ye tropic
of Cancer.

The artick circle of London under the Polare circle.


Under the Tropicke of Cancer, the North Pole being raised.23. degrees.28.
minutes, going directly East and West: it is.19800. miles in compass in our
artick circle of London where the pole artick is raised.15. degrees. 32. minutes,
going East and west: it is.13320. miles in compass, then underneath the Polare
circle where the Pole is raised sixty six degrees, thirty two minutes: it
is.8460. miles in compass. By this you see that the compass of the East and
Weast line (coming from the Equinoctial) is much lesser to the North wards
than it is to the South wards. Wherefore when you shall have any occasion to
attempt any voyage to the North parts, it is best to sail by a Globe: for so
shall you better see the distances and bigness of the lands, and in like
manner your lines and courses. In this order, first (according to the
accustomed manner) keep a perfitte accounte and reckoning of the way of the
ship, by what line or point your Ship has made her way good, then must
you resort to your Globe. After that consider what place and Parallel you be
in, which you may do by the Sun by day, How to use the globe to direct
your course, and to know how that any place does bear.
and by the Stars by night. Now (knowing what place and Parallel you be in)
set your Globe to the elevation of your Pole: that done, turn to the
place of your Zenith, and seek the opposite of it in your Parallel: for then
you know that in the same Parallel is your East and Weaste line: that had,
the just quarter of that circle to the Pole, must be divided into the eight
points of your compass, doing so likewise on the other side. In like case if
you come to the Southwards, divide your.8. wyndes from your Antarticke Pole, to
your Parallel circle: and thus must you do ever and anon, for the oftener you
do observe this custom, the better and perfiter shall your course be. Now thus
briefly I make an end of ye sailing by the Globe. But for them that do occupy
the Southparts, nothing is better than their cards. Because I have declared
unto you the length of certain of the Paralels, what miles the Earth does
contain in compass under them, now will I show you how many miles distance is
between every one of them. And first, The distance between the equinoctial and
the tropic of Cancer.

Between ye artick circle of London and the tropic of Cancer.


from the Equinoctial to the Tropic of Cancer, (which is there where the Sun
makes his furthest progress to the North parts) it is.1408. miles. Secondly,
between the tropic of Cancer and our Artick circle of London it is 1684.
miles. Thirdly, between our Artick circle and the Polare circle is.900. miles.
Lastly, between the Polare circle and the Pole is.1408. miles. So that it is
in all from the Equinoctial to either of the two Poles.5400. miles: which is
the fourth part of the compass of the whole Earth. Furthermore, for that you
may the better understand that the Earth is a Globe or Circular (which any
person that does occupy the Sea, The cause why that you may see the sails of
a ship and not the whole.
sees most apparently) you shall perceive it thus, if you see a Ship any
thing far off, you may perfitly see ye sails of it, but not the whole, the
cause whereof is the circularnesse of the earth and the water of the Sea: for
that the water does rise and swell between you and the other ship, according to
the distance between both the ships: because the distance to the center of the
earth or water, is in every place alike. And he that has desire to know
further heerof, M. Dee has made mention thereof in Euclides Elamentes in his
mathematical preface, and also in the.12. book, whither you may have recourse,
yet notwithstanding I will say a little thereof, whereby you may discern how far
it is possible to see a ship upon the sea: as thus: if you be on ye sea in a
ship, so yt there be but half a league between you and the other ship, the
water will be five inches and a half higher in the middle of the way between
both the ships, for that the water is equal in every place unto the center of
the earth, and then the water going by a crooked line, then to strike it by a
right line, the middle of the line that should come from the center of the
earth, shall be shorter than the other.2. lines coming from the center of the
earth between the.2. ships by.5. inches and a half, and then it must needs
be said, that the water is higher by the said.5. inches and a half. And
furthermore, if the two ships were a league asunder, then the water by his
circulernesse should be.22. inches higher than the level in the middle between
both the ships. To know how many foot and inches that the water is higher
than the level or the sea between two ships.
Furthermore, if the.2. ships be 2. leagues asunder, then the water shall be
higher than the level in the middle between both the ships by.88. inches,
which is.7. foot and.4. inches. If the.2. ships be.3. leagues the one from
the other, then the water shall be higher than the level in the midway
between both the ships, by.198. inches, which is 16. foot and a half.
Furthermore, if the.2. ships be.4. leagues asunder, the water shall be higher
than the level in the midway between both the ships by.252. inches, which
is.29. foot and.4. inches. And furthermore, if the.2. ships were.5. leagues
asunder, the water should be higher than the level of the midway between
both the ships by.550. inches, which is.46. foot lacking.2. inches. Yet
furthermore, if the.2. ships were.6. leagues asunder, the water should be
higher than the level in the middle way between them by.792. inches, which
is.66. foot. Furthermore also, if the.2. ships were.7. leagues asunder, the
water should be higher than the level in the midway between both the ships by.
1878. inches, What a ken is, and the cause why you may see a ship further out
of the top then upon the hatches.
and that is.90. foot, which is as far and rather farther than it is
possible to see any ship upon the Sea: Neither is it possible to see any land
further, but such land as is very high land, which for the greatness of the
height you may see it, wherefore.7. leagues or.6. leag. is called a ken. Now the
circularnesse of the earth is the cause that you may see a ship or land
further out of the top than, upon the hatches:

Wherefore it is a plain case, that the Earth and Sea is not flat, but
circular, as is before declared. etc.

The.19. Chapter, is as touching the making of Plats or Cards for the Sea, and
not to paint their cards as they do, but rather to supply the vacant places
with other necessary matters: and also of three necessary things contained in
the plats or cards, and their uses, which is the most necessary thing in
Navigations.
FOr the making of Plats or Cards, as touching Hydrographia commonly called sea
Cards, I mean to say little thereof: for that it is sufficiently declared in the
book called the art of Navigations: Saving this, I would wish the^ that be the
makers of plats and cards for the Sea, Not to paint their Sea cards but to use
ye vacant places with other necessary matters.
not to paint their compasses with so many colors: neither upon the Land with
so many flagges, for that it does rather hurt than good: although it may be
said they be so painted in vacant places, those vacant places I would wish
them to furnish with these 2. matters in this order. First in some vacant
place with a compass there, to place against every point of the half of the
compass, letters, or some other figures or carecters, then in like manner,
(according to that place where such a Moon makes a full Sea) to make that
letter or carecter at the haven, port, or place. As for ensample thus: I place
A at the East point, B at the East and by South, C at the East southeast, D at
Southeast and by East, and so consequently to all the points unto the Weast,
then that being done, where it flows an East Moon. I place A in the platte
or card, and where an East and by South Moon, I do place B in the card,
and so forth, according to the place of the Moon that makes a full Sea. And
where it runs half side under other, To draw ye shape of the la^d in their
cards.
to make some note upon the point of the compass. etc. This also is very
necessary to be done to furnishe up all the vacant places of the plat or
card, to draw the shape or fashion of every headland or high land along
every coast that is needful to be known, and at what point of the compass
the land is of that fashion: at how far off the land ryseth in that
fashion: and so to make the fashion of the land as often as the land alters
the form and fashion: and last of all, at what point of the compass the
land has that shape or fashion: for being upon one side, the land ryseth of
one fashion, and on the other side of an other form or fashion. Also being
near the land it will be in one fashion, and being far off in an other
fashion (as is before declared in the 14. Chapter) for there is nothing more
needful and necessary for a Seaman, than this: to know the land when he
sees it, and there is no way better to make him remember it, than to have
notes how the land does rise upon every side: Great infirmities by mistaking
any place.
and what greater inconvenience may there grow by any means, than there may
by mistaking of a place? for it were twenty times better to be thoroughly
persuaded that he knows it not, than to think he does know it not being
that place. For whereas he does think to prevent the dangers, he may willingly
run upon the dangers not known of him. Therefore in my opinion they can do no
better than to furnish their vacant places in their plats and cards with this
matter: for there can be nothing better. The use of the Sea cards is most
necessary for Navigations for long voyages: How necessary a thing the sea cards
be.3. necessary things in ye sea cards.
first for that it shows you how one place bears from another: secondly,
the distance of any places how far the one is from the other. Of which the
one is represented by the lines of the compass: the other by the scale or
trunk of measure, if the platte be truly made. Thirdly, it shows you in
what Latitude from the Equinoctial or Altitude of the pole any place is in, by
the line of degrees. Now to direct your course through the Sea by the card
to any place assigned, you must first look by what point of the compass it
bears from you, from the place you mean to set off from the land, unto
the place you would first fall with. To know how any place does bear from
you by the card.
Which you shall know thus: seek alyne from the next compass unto the place
you mean to depart from, then open your compasses unto one of those lines by
your judgment that falls near unto your place assigned: and let the other
foot of your compasses stand just at that place where your ship is, when you
direct your course: that done, bear your hands forwards even, and let the
one end be still upon the line to the which you did open your compasses,
until you come to your place assigned. But if it falls short of the place
assigned, then take the next line nearer unto the place you departed from:
when you have so done, if your compasses do over reach the place assigned,
then take a line further off from the place you do mean to set off from: and
so shall you see by what point of the compass the place assigned does bear
from you. etc. If you would know how far the place assigned is from you, To
know how far it is unto any place by the card.
set the one foot of the compasses upon the place you depart from, and
stretche out the other foot unto the place assigned just, that done
(standing still unremoved) set them to the scale or trunk of measure, and
that will show you justly how many leagues it is just from the place of your
departing unto the place assigned. If the distance between the.2. places be
more than the compasses will reach at once, then first set your compasses unto
the scale, opening the compasses unto.100. leagues more or less, as your scale
and co^passes will give you leave at your discretion, after that set ye one
foot at the place of your departing, and the other foot of the co^passes right
toward the place assigned, as often times as ye distance between the.2. places
does require, and thereof (the co^passes being opened unto.100. leagues) you
may conclude it to be so many.100. leag. unto the place assigned as the
co^passes did show unto you: but if there be any od mesure, the^ open your
co^passes to ye quantity, and set to the^ ye scale, and it will shaw you ye just
content of that measure, more than so many.100. leagues. To know what
Latitude or height of ye pole any place has by the card.
etc. Furthermore touching the third commodity, which is to know what
Latitude any place assigned has: set one foot of the compasses upon the place
assigned, and open the compasses unto the next East and Weast line, then
carry that unto the line of degrees (keeping the foot of the compasses upon
the East and Weast line) it will show justly the number of degrees that the
Pole is above the Horizon. So of these three ways, by the first is known by
what point of the compass any place bears from you. By the second is known
how far distance it is unto any place assigned. And by the third is known
in what height the Pole is in any place assigned. etc. Now (this being known)
you may with the more ease know how to attain to come unto the port or place
assigned. Yet furthermore, there is to be considered (in directing the course
of a ship to any place assigned) what impediments may be by the way: as tides,
currents, or the scantnesse of the wind which may put the ship unto the
leewardes of his course, Things to be considered by the M. or pilote of a ship.
as also the surging of the Sea: And all this must be considered by the
master and Pilot of the ship. Likewise also in long voyages, the wind may
often shifte upon him, and sometime the wind may be such as he can not lie his
course: wherefore he must keep a perfect account of the ships way, and
consider to know what point the ship has made her way good by. And at every
time that the wind does shifte, and the ship can not lie her course, to note
in the card or plat in what place the ship may be: in having a special
regard unto the way of the ship, as touching the swiftness or slownesse that
the ship goes: and if so be the weather be clear either by night or by day,
to take the true Altitude of the Pole: They may correct the ships way by the
taking ye height of the Pole.
for by that they may correct the ships way, and give a very near guess how
the place (assigned to go unto) does bear from them, as also how far it is
thither, saving only in the East and Weast course: and then they have no
other help but only the very account of the ships way. And to correct their
dead reckning by the altitude of the Pole they must do this: (especially if
the ship have had often trauerse by the means of contrary winds, so that she
could not lie her course) consider upon the card or plat how long the ship
has made her way good for so many points as the ship has sayld by: then (if
by the altitude of the Pole the ship has gone more than the dead reckning
did show you) repair unto the line of degrees, and set the one foot of the
compasses upon the degree and place of the height of the Pole, and the other
upon the next east and west line: that done, bear it unto the place you suppose
the ship to be in: and the^ bring forwards with the other compasses, what
point of the Compass the ship has sailed by, and at the meeting of the.2
pair of compasses make a note for the place that the ship is in: from which
place you may with your compasses see, how the place assigned does bear, and
also how far off you be from the same. Furthermore (if you find by the height
of the Pole that you are not so far shot as your reckning did show unto you)
you must pull back so much from the point that the ship has sailed by, as
the height of the pole does show unto you, by the order before rehearsed etc.
Furthermore (as I have declared unto you in the.14. Chapter going before) to
know how far the land is off from you, knowing (as before) the distaunce
between any 2. places by setting the land with your compass, To know how far
yt the land is of from you by the sight of the land with your compasses to
do it upon the land.
you may do the like by your card, as thus: you setting the.2. places with your
compass, do know that the.2. places be so many leagues asunder, then shall you
repair to the card, and according to the bearing of the.2. places by the
points of the compass, you (being thwart of one of these.2. places) shall reply
it with your compasses unto your scale: But for that in the scale the leagues
be so small, you may assign.20. leagues to be but one league, and open the
compasses unto that proportion that the.2. places be asunder, and the one of
them does bear from the other: that done, open the compasses again from the
center of the compass unto the place that you do imagine to be the land, and then
reply it unto the trunk of measure, you shall see how many leagues you be
from the shore and so forth. So that you may see that the plat or card is one
of the necessariest things that is to be used in Navigations. etc.

The.20. Chapter is of the Longitude and declinatio^ of.32. notable fixed
Stars for Navigations, with tables of their shining, and at what point of
your compass they do both rise and set: and also tables for every month of the
year, declaring at what hour and minute they be South, running from the first
day of the month to the.15. and from the.15. to the last day, and will
continue these 100. years without much error.
ANd furthermore I do think it convenient for diverse considerations to show
the Longitude and declination of certain of the most notablest fixed Stars
that are near unto the Equinoctial, If the pole be raised more than 50.
or.60. degrees, it is to hye to be observed by ye cross Staff. These Stars
will serve beyond the Equinoctial.
to the number of.32. of them, which are very necessary for Navigations in
diverse respects, as this: if you be unto the North parts where the North pole
is raised more than.50. or.60. degrees, then the North Star is too hye to be
observed or taken with the cross staff (as I have declared in the.6. Chapter)
and it may chance so that in the day the Sun is not to be seen at noone,
and then these Stars may serve your turn. And furthermore they be very good
for them that have occasion to travel beyond the Equinoctial where the North
pole is under the Horizon, in using their declination as they do the Suns
declination in all points, which does appear in the.7.8. and.9. Chapters of
this book. And furthermore they be very necessary for Seafaring men to know
the hour of the night: both by their being upon the Meridian, To know the
rising and setting of these Stars in all places by the order of the xi.
Chapter The order of the table following.
and also by their rising and setting: you may know the true time of their
rising and setting in every Latitude by their declination from the
Equinoctial, whether they decline to the South parts or North parts, as is
declared by the declination of the Sun in the.11. chapter. And furthermore by
any of these Stars you may try the variatio^ of your compass by night. etc.
Now shall follow the table of all these Stars. The first row of this table
contains the names of the Stars The second, the signs, that they be in
Longitude. The third, the degrees in the signs. The.4. the minutes belonging
thereunto. The.5. the degrees of declination. The.6. the odd minutes belonging
thereunto. The.7. shows toward what port they decline by letters, of which
S. signifies Septentrionell or North declination. M. signifies Meridionall or
south declination: as in the table does appear. The.8 does show nothing but
the bigness of the Stars. Now follows the Table.

The use of this Table is this: when you have taken the height of any of these
Stars upon the Meridian, then look what declination the Star has from the
Equinoctial: How to use the stars declination to know the height of ye Pole.
if the star have North declination, then subtract or take away the stars
declination from the height: if it have South declition, then add or put unto
the height the stars declination, and that will show unto you the height of
the Equinoctial, and then by the heigthe of the Equinoctial the height of the
Pole is known, as the.7. Chapter does declare. And now I think it convenient
to make certain Tables, to show unto you at what hour and time any of these
stars be upon the Meridian, whereby they may the better know these Stars.
I will also show unto you how long any of these Stars do shine or tarry
above the Horizon in this Latitude from the Equinoctial of London, that is
at.51. or 52. degrees. And also at what point of the compass any of these
Stars do rise or set, which will serve this.100. years without much error.

NOw this table serves for every monthe in the year (being exactly
calculated) the time of their being South, or touching your Meridia^ or (as
some term it) Noonestead, serving very well the Seamen to take the height of
them with their instruments upon the Sea, referring it unto the table of
declination that goes before: the first is the hours, the second the minutes,
the third be the letters that show you whether they be South by day or by
night, in the evening or morning, in the forenoone or after noone, The
signification of the letters in the table.
of which the letter E does signify Evening, the letter M. signifies Morning,
the letters DM. signifies day in the Morning, and the letters DA. signifies
day in the after noone (as I said before) the very hour and minute of their
being South. Now you see that I have put to their being South in the day as
well as in the night, to the intent to know the hour of the night as well by
their setting, as also by your compass, which I showed you in the first
chapter or rule, namely to bring your.32. points into 24. hours: and in like
manner in the fourth chapter by shining of the Moon to divide the shining into
two equal parts, then those parts (being equally divided with the hour and
minutes) and the time before their being South, put together, the half that
shines and that, shows the just rising of those stars: and the other time
of their shining after their being South, shows their setting (as I declared
in the rule of the shining of the Moon.) Now you, seeing the table runs
from the first day of every monthe to the.15. and from the.15. to the last
day, must consider (if you will know the exact time betwixt the first day
and the.15. day, or betwixt the.15. day, and the last) to do this, look how
many days of the monthe is pass either from the first day, or.15. day, and
pull four minutes from that number: for so many days as is past, for every day
that shall show you the true time of their being South. That known, you shall
do (as is aforesaid) for their rising and setting.

The.21. Chapter shows you the making of a general instrument, to know the
hour of the day by, throughout all the world.
Now for the making of your instruments for the Sea, with their uses, you
shall repair to the book of Navigations made by Martin Curtise a Spaniarde,
Imprinted by M. Judge Printer to the Queens Majesty: else I would have
showed you the making of diverse instruments, as also the making of the
equinoctial dial with his use, which is very profitable to know the hour
of the day by, in all latitudes through the whole world, for your compass is
not to know the hour of the day by in Summer, neither in the Morning nor
Evening, neither can you know when the Moon is east or West, she having North
declination, as being in the sign of Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, or Leo: because
your compass stands flat as does your Horizon. The sun and moon does
give a full shadow by the compass.

The Equinoctial dial gives a true shadow all the world over.


Wherefore it is very good for Sea men to use the Equinoctial dials, for that
it shows them the true hour of the day in all Latitudes, and also the Moon
does give a true shadow in that Dial in all Latitudes, for I do know that
Sea men are very many times deceived where it does flow an East and West
Moon, or any point between the Southeast and Northeast. Because in setting
the Moon with their compass (being in the North signs) she seems to be
East by the Compass, when she is near the East Southeast in her course: and
in like manner when the Moon seemeeth West by the compass she shall be a
little more than West Southwest in her course: which is a very perilous matter
unto them that should put into a tide, A perilous matter.
harborowe, or haven, where he knows there is water enough for him if that he
does come at a full Sea, and then by the error of the Moons shadow of the
compass he is deceived: and when he finds the error he thinks that the
cause thereof comes by the occasion of some storm of wind that is like to
follow, imputing unto it that the tide does not keep his course, whereas the
very cause grows by no other means but of receiving a false shadow by the
Horizontall compass: and especially if the Moon be near her greatest
declination unto the North parts, that is, in the sign of Gemini and Cancer.
And also that effect is most preferred if the Dragons head be in the beginning
of the sign of Aries: for that then if the Moon be in the beginning of
Cancer, she shall have.5. degrees more in declination from the Equinoctial,
than the sun shall have at their greatest declination unto the North parts:
so that reserving the Moons Paralex, which is according unto the Latitude of
any place that the Moon shall be declined.28. degrees and a half unto the
North part of the Equinoctial: so that for avoiding of these infirmities, The
moon may decline 28. degrees and a half from the Equinoctial.
I would wish them to use the Equinoctial dials. And furthermore I do think
that the Equinoctial dials be not used amongst our Mariners here in England
for that the charges is so much in the making of them, and yet it serves no
other turn but to know the hour of the day, and to show the true shadow of
the Moon. I have not known the^ used by any English Master or Pylot, but only
by one man, which person had not it for the proper use thereof, but rather had
it, to say that he had such an instrument as no English man had the like, and
to brag that he had such an instrument that he could do great feats
therewith in the going of long viages. etc. Of me^ that will have instruments,
and know not the use of them.
I would have no man offended with me. I know the nature and quality of some
that take charge: they will have instruments and other things thereunto
apperteyning, and yet they the^ selves do not know ye use of the^, yet they
will seem to be cunning, and that they need no instructions of any man, for
that they know all things, and yet in respect know nothing. (But
notwithstanding) I would wish them that be Sea faring men to use them selves to
the Equinoctial dials: for that they do serve two notable turns, as well at
home in these our channels, as also in long viages: they may make them with a
very easy charge: for whereas in the Art of Navigations it is showed how to
make them in brass, they may make them with wood in this manner: take a piece
of bordes end of six inches broad, An easy way to make an equinoctial
dial with little charge
more or less at your discretion, and half an inche in thickness, then
having cut it round, and playned it smoothe, you may either grave in it
the.32. points of the compass, or else paynt them upon it with some colors,
with the.24. hours upon both the sides: as this figure shows.



That done take a wyre of just the Diameter of the Instrument, and put it
through the middle or center of the Instrument, then make it fast that the one
end be half way thoroughe on the one side, and the other half on the other
side, this done make a frame with three pieces of bordes ends to hang the
dial or instrument upon, with one pin on the East point and an other on the
West point: then take an other piece of boardes ends being square, and with a
pair of compasses strike a quarter of a circle of just the bigness of the
quarter of the dial, and cut all that away, and then the rest of the square
that is left, (at the edge of the quarter of the circle) divide into.90. equal
parts, marking it thus.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.90. as in this form: last of
all let this be placed in the middle of the frame, so that.90. may stand right
under the very middle of the dial and there made fast, in such form that
the very end of the wire when the dial is put up and down may touch the
hollow part that you see cut away, which is called the Directer, and so it is
finished, and will stand altogether in this form.

The Equinoctial Dial.


The use of this Dial is most necessary in a ship, for that you have
occasions to transporte your selves into all the clymates. And to know the true
hour of the day do this: set this Dial by your compass (the Directer unto
the Southewardes) and then (you knowing how hie the pole is above the Horizon)
set the end of the wire right against that degree in the directer, and the
other end of the wier will point just unto the pole, then look what shadow
the wire does give by the Sun, that is the true hour of the day. In like
manner you may know the true hour of the night by the Moons shadow, and also
the Moon will give a true shadow of her place. etc.

The.22. Chapter treats of the soundings, coming from any place out of the
Occident Sea, to seek Vshant or the Lyzarde, and so all along till you come
to the coaste of Flaunders: with other necessary matters to be known, to them
that be Channellers, that does occupy, or deal amongst sands, banks, or
such other like.
Because it is necessary to be had in memory, for that it is a dangerous
place to hitte or fall with, to enter into ye Sleue, coming homewardes out of
Spain or Portugal, or from Barbary, or any other place from the Southwards,
a ship that comes from any such place to seek the I Will of Vshant, or the
Lizarde in this root of sounding of a.^00. or.90. fadoms shall find big
soundings, and shall be near about to the seames. The sounding near unto
Vsha^t and the Lizarde.
In the root of.80. fadoms you shall find cockle shelles, and dentes in the
talow of the lead: and in this sounding hold on your course to the North till
you change sounding, then if you be at.60. or.64. fadom, you shall find small
sand and Mathey ground, and shall be near the coaste of Vshant. If you have
time and day go seek it in the Northeast, and you shall be about.10. leagues
from the I Will. If you come making your course about Basefreede, you shall find
course sand, red and brown, and you shall have sounding at.40. fadom: if you
be toward the bank of Silley, you shall have soundings at 86. or.90. fadom,
and you shall find in the tallow stony ground and shall be well shot
toward the bank of Silley. When you be at.80. fadome you shall find small
black sand, and shall be well toward the Lizarde. When you be at.60. or 64.
fadome, you shall find white sand and white soft worms, and shall be very
nie to the Lizarde. Between the cape of Cornwall and Vshant amidde the
channel, you shall find 70. fadome, and near enough. Between Dodman and the
Forne in the channel you shall have.40. or.50. fadome. If you be thwarte of
Plimmouth or the Starte, you shall find streamie ground and dentes in the
tallowe, and soundings.41. or.42. fadoms. At the coming from Portland you
shall have.35. fadoms, and small shingels. And when you be nie to Portland.30.
fadoms, The sounding in the channel.
and stones like beans: and this sounding will last till S. Aldam, and in the
said soundings you shall find white stones like broken Aules, and other that be
bigger, and then you shall be thwarte of S. Aldam or of the I Will of Wight. Two or
3. leagues from the I Will of Wight, you shall find.25. fadome, with dentes and
cleftes in the tallow like small threedes.2. or.3. leagues from the Caskettes
you shall find.40. fadome and big stones ragged and black. Between the I Will
of wight and the hagge, the deepest is but.35. or.40. fadome. Between the I Will
of Wight and Lantergate the deepest is but.25. or.30. fadome. Between Beachy
and the I Will of Wight, a league from the land, you shall find.38. fadome, and
poppell as big as beans. Between Fairly and the water of Sum in the
deepest but.25. fadom. Between Folkestone and Bollayne is a bank that is
called Rippe rappe: and lies in the midde way between Pickardie and England:
and hard aborde by it, is.26. or.27. fadome. In the straights of Calice is.30.
fadom, in the road of Calice is.16. fadom. And along the coast of Flaunders
is but.20. fadome the deepest. Thus much have I said for the entrance of the
Sleeue, to come to the river of Thames, The higth of the pole at the entrance
of the Sleeue.
and in the entrance in the midway between Vshant and the Lizarde the pole
Articke is elevated.50. degrees and a half, and the Equinoctial is lifted
above the Horyzon.39. degrees and a half. And furthermore for them that are
channellers and occupiers amongst sands and banckes, and such other like, they
must have consideracion of these things followyng. Necessary things to be
noted for the^ that are Cha^nellers and dealers amongst sands.
As this: first (if you know how the channel does lie right between any.2.
sands) you must view the land to take some marks for it, in this manner to be
a leadyng mark. And that you shall do thus: look something that stands
far into the land, that you may know it well being right open with the
channel of the sands, then take an other mark near unto the water side, and
the one to be right against the other, when that you be in the middle of the
channel, and then you knowing these two marks well, they will be leading
marks unto you for ever to keep that channel. And then furthermore if it
does so happen that the channel does turn to keep an other course, or else
(some other danger lying in the way) you must have a thwarte mark to know
both when that you are clear of any danger, and also when that you are open
of an other channel, and that you shall do as before is declared, to take some
mark within the land, and also an other near unto the sea, water or river
side, to be your thwarte mark when you bring them both together. And this is
most specially to be noted: that these marks be very yare and good when the
one is far distant from the other: and those marks very slow and asks
some distance in sailing to open and shette them, which are near together
upon the land. And furthermore, for them that are Channellers or occupiers
amongst sands, for that the weather is not always clear, when they have
occasion to pass through such places, it is good for them to sound the
channelles perfitely, and to know by the depthe, what side of the channel they
are upon, and also how far they are shot into that channel. And also in
like manner to know by the sounding of any of the sides of the channel,
whether they be near any of the sands or dangers, or any breadth of: for yt
some sands or dangers there be having fair or good soundings or shaldings,
that they may borrowe of and on at their pleasure. There be again some sands
and dangers that there is no borrowing nor sounding of them, and those be
neall or deep, hard unto the sands or dangers: for that the water is deep
hard unto the sand: and these are very dangerous sands for any ship to
come near, for that they shall have the water very deep, and by and by be a
ground. Yet furthermore it is very good for them that be channellers and
occupiers amongst sands, to know which way the tide does set at every time of
the tide: for that many times it happens so, that when the sands be under
the water, the tide does set cross the channel, which is a dangerous matter
if it be not very well considered by the Master or Pilote. etc.

The.23. Chapter, is as touching the variatio^ of the Compass, called the
Northeasting and the Norwesting of the Compass: and how to give a guess to
know the Longitude.
AS touching the variation of the compass called the Northeasting or
Norwesting, it is supposed that the Compass does vary by proportion, in the
sailing to the Eastwards or Westwardes: and (as I have declared in the end of
the.6. chapter) if it varieth by proportion that the Northpoint is varied one
point from the North at.22. degrees and a half, Of the compass to vary by
even proportion.
and so until the North point does stand Northeast or Norwest. And that is,
when you are.90. degrees from the Meridian that the compass was made at to the
Eastwardes or Westwards. Some also are of an other opinion, that the compass
does vary by no proportion, Of the compass to vary by no proportion.
but does vary according unto the nature of some kind of mineralles, that
is, in some country or some kind of Islands, that draw the Compass by the
mines of the Load stone or Magnes stone that they tauche their compass with
when they make them. And furthermore the book of Martine Curtise, (called the
art of Navigations) says that the compass does vary by proportion, in this
manner: which is, by the proportion of a circle: for that the North point does
always point unto a place in the heavens that is immovable, and therefore as
you do transporte your self to the Eastwarde or Westwarde, the North point
does still point unto that place in the heaven: Of ye compass to vary
according unto the proportion of a circle, that is swiftly and slowly.
wherefore (as he says) when you be.90. degrees in Longitude from the place
of the making of your compass, that is, when you be one quarter of the
circumference of the earth, in that parallel the compass will be varied.4.
points from the North: and as you do transporte your self further, then the
North point of the compass will come nearer and nearer unto the North: and
when you are just half the circumference of the earth, that then the North
point will stand due North upon the pole again: for that you are come to the
same Meridian again upon the opposite part of the earth, (as it does appear
in the third part and.5. chapter, of the said book of Martine Curtise) but if
that be true then the compass does vary swiftely at the first and slowly
afterward in order like unto the Suns declination: by which (if it be
true) they may very well know what order the compass does vary by, and so by
the variation you may give an near estimation of the Longitude, and know in
how many degrees the compass is varied one point, two points, three points,
and so the greatest variation which is four points. Now to know the
proportion do this: First, make a circle with a pair of compasses, and
stryke a Line by the Center to the circumference, which shall be your Meridian
line, then stryke an other line by the Center a cross, that you may divide the
circle into four equal parts, To know in how many degrees going but the
Eastwarde or Westwarde that the compass does vary one point or.2. points
or.3. points. etc.
and then (for that forty five degrees is the greatest variation) set
forty five unto the East part and West part, deuidyng every one of the
quarters of the circle into forty five equal parts, according to the
greatest variation then make an other circle of that Diameter, that the
circumference touch the Center of that Circle: and divide it as you divide the
Compass after the rate of two and thirty points although you need not
divide but that side to the Norwardes, and then the Northeast and Norwest point
will fall upon forty five degrees: that done draw lines according to the
points of the Compass unto the Eastwardes or Westwardes, and look how they
fall upon the line that comes from the Center of the other Circle of which
every quarter is divided into forty five equal parts: and then (at the very
place that the line doothe touch) draw parallel lines in that Circle by
proportion, at the very place to the Eastewardes or Westwardes that the line of
the Compass falls upon: and that will show you justly how many degrees you
shall transporte your self unto the Eastwardes or Westwardes, for the varying
of the first point, second point, and third point, and in like manner the
greatest variation which is the fourth point. So that (according to that
order) it will fall out in this manner, that the Compass will be varied one
point at near eleven and. To know how many degrees is in the varying of one
point.
It will be varied two points near about four and twenty degrees and a
half. It will be varied three points at forty two degrees, and about a
half. But it will not be varied the fourth point until you be full four
score and ten degrees from the Meridian that the compass was made at: which
is a very slow varying being.47. degrees and before the Compass does vary
one point, and between the third point and the second point being.18.
degrees for the varying of that point, and then from the second point unto
the first point, it is.13. degrees and better, and last of all from the
varying of one point to the Meridian it is.11. If you will know how many
leagues a degree is, repair to the 16. chapter.
degrees and part, every degree being according to the parralel you are in,
which does alter according unto your Latitude from the Equinoctial: for under
the Equinoctial it is, 60. English miles, or.20. English leagues unto one
degree. In the Latitude of.60. degrees from the Equinoctial there in that
parralell it is but.30. miles, or.10. English leagues unto one degree. etc. as
it is plainly showed in the.16. chapter of this book, wherein is an
instrument showing you how many miles of Longitude will answer unto a degree
in every several Latitude by the replying of a thread at your discretion: so
that I conclude if the compass does vary by that order of proportion that
Martine Curtise does attributs unto it, you may give a near guess to find
the Longitude by the varying of the compass being near unto the Meridian that
the compass was made for. But if you be very far from the Meridian that the
compass was made for, then the variation is so slow that you can have no
judgment at all (by the variation of the compass) to find any Longitude. And
furthermore if the compass does vary by that proportion that Martine Curtise
does affirm, I am of that opinion that there may grow some error in
proportion in those compasses that are made for any Meridian: There may grow
some error in ye proportion of the varying of the Compass.
for those compasses that are made here with us in England whereof the needle
does stand.4. or.5. degrees unto the Eastwards of ye North (as does appear
by all the needles made for dials and also in the compasses) if they would have
the North point to stand due North, then the end of the wyers under the card
of the compass should stand four or five degrees unto the Eastwards of the
Flouredeluce: wherefore it may be doubted that the compass may vary more the
one way than it will the other way, by that proportion that the end of the
wyre does stand beside from the North point. For (if in the greatest
variation) the end of the wyre (under the card of the compass) does stand
Northwest, the flouredeluce of the compass should stand near half a point
to the Westwards of the Northwest. And in like manner at the greatest variation,
if the end of the wyre does stand Northeast, then the Flouredeluce should
stand near half a point unto the Northwards of the Northeast. etc. And
furthermore here is one thing that I could never understand the truth of,
and yet I have oftentimes demanded the question of diverse that have been in
the West part, in the bay of America, Things that I can not know.
and that is this: Whether in the compass there made, or in the dials that are
there made, the ends of the Nedles do stand due North, or not? and yet it
has not been my chance to meet with any that can tell. For if it be so that
those Nedles that are there touched do stand due North, th^n it were very
good for them that should occupy long trauerse unto the Westwarde or
Eastwarde, to have diverse compasses ready made with the Needle of them
untouched, and to carry a good Lodestone with them to touch those compasses
when the compass has the greatest variation. It is good for these two causes:
the one cause: it is the better to direct your course by. But this cause is
very special, to give a near guess of the Longitude, that is to say, the
compass will vary more quickly (according to the order before written) by
which you see they may transporte them selves further unto the Eastwards or
Westwardes before that the compass does vary one point, than it does for
the other three points, so that they are not able to give any estimation at
all, Of slow varying of the compass.
by the varying of the compass, to know any Longitude: for that they may
travel more than the quarter of the circumference of the earth, before the
compass will be varied one point backewardes and forwards. And I do very
much marvel at this, (considering how many times English men have been in the
west Indies) that I can meet with no man that can tell whether the needels of
the Dials or compasses made there do stand due North or not: which is a
thing that may be easily known. For the needels of the Dials it is s^ene
seen, and in like manner of the Compasses: How easy it is to know whether yt
the co^passes made in the West Indies* do stand due North.
for if the Needle of the Compasses there made will not stand due North, then
it is reformed upon the Card of the fly of the Compass, as if the North end
of the wyers do stand Northeast, then they will set Northeast over it, even as
we do set the end of the wyers of the Compasses with us made near half a
point to the Eastwardes of the North. etc. And furthermore it is very good for
them that are Masters or Pylotes of ships to note, Of making notes of the
variation.
when they do fall with any land where the Compass is varied, to make a
remembrance in a book how many points and degrees the Compass is varied in
every place where they come unto, which will be a great help for them to find
that place again. And to find the variation it is declared in the 6. Chapter.
And here I leave to trouble thee any further for this time: but shortly after
this, look for two other works of mine, the one called, The shoting in great
Ordinance: an other named, A Treasure for Travelers: which two Books will be
profitable I trust for all men. If these my labors may profit my Country,
then have I my desire. And thus I bid thee most heartily farewell.

The Table of the contents of this book.
THe first chapter of Nauigatio^ shows what the.32. points of the compass
be, and to what uses they do serve. Fol. 8. a The.2. chapter treats of the
golden number or prime, showing the Epact, and by the Epact to know the age of
the Moon. Fol. 9. b The.3. chapter teaches how to know by the age of the
Moon what a clock it does flow, or is full Sea at any place where you do
know what Moon makes a full Sea. Fol. 10. b The.4. chap. treats of the
Sun and Moons course in the Zodiac, and how you shall know at what
hours the Moon shall rise and set at: and at what point of the Compass, with
other necessary things. Fo. 14* a The.5. chapter is of a table of declination,
commonly called of Seafaring men a Regiment of the sun, exactly calculated
for.4. years, and will serve for.24. years, for every day of the monthe. Fol.
16. b The.6. chapter shows how to take the height of the Sun with the
Cross staff. etc. Fol. 26. a The.7. chapter shows how to handle the
declination of the Sun, to know the altitude of the north pole above the
Horizon (the height of the Sun being truly taken and known in any place
between the North pole and the Equinoctial) so that the sun be unto the
Southwards of you at the taking of the fame upon the Meridian. Fol. 29. a
The.8. chapter shows you how to handle the declination of the Sun when you
are between the Equinoctial and the sun, that is to say, the sun to the
Southwardes or Northwards of you, and the Equinoctial to the Northwards or
Southwards, or under the Equinoctial, the height of the sun being truly known
or taken. f. 30. b The.9. chap. shows how to handle the declination of the
sun when you are beyond the Equinoctial, that is to say, between the South
pole, and the Equinoctial: with certain ensamples both for the South pole, and
the North pole. Fol. 32. a The.10. chapter shows how to handle the suns
declinatio^ unto the Northward, where the sun does not set under the Horizo^:
and also to take the sun at the lowest due north. f. 34. b The.11. chap. does
show how you shall know the length of the day, and to know how much the day
is shortened or lengthened by the suns declination. Fol. 36. a The.12. chapter is
of the North-star. f. 38. a The.13 chap. does show you by the sailing upon the
quarter of your compass, in how far sailing you do raise a degree, and what
you do depart from the Meridian. etc. Fol. 39. a The.14. chapter shows how
to know how far any land is off from you, if you know the distance
between any two places, whether that you do run along by the land, or
directly to the shore, or otherwise with other necessary things. Fol. 40. a
The.15. chapter treats of the longitude. etc. Fol. 42. b The.16. chapter
shows how many miles will answer to one degree of longitude in every several
latitude between the Equinoctial and either of the two poles: with the
demo^stratio^ for that purpose, and also the diversity of aspects of the
Moon. fo. 44. a The.17. chapter treats of the longitude and latitude of
certain of the most notable towns in England, and also how long the moon
does change at one town before an other: with the diversity of the longest
day in summer, from Southhampton to the northermost part in Scotland. Fo. 45. b
The.18. chapter shows how to sail by the globe. And to know how much the
water is hyer than the level between any two ships on the Sea, which
grows by the roundnesse of the earth. Fol. 47. a The.19. chapter is as
touching the making of plattes or Cards for the Sea, and not to paynt their
Cards as they do, but rather to fill the vacant places with other necessary
matters: and also of three necessary things contained in the Plattes or Cards,
with their uses. Fol. 49. a The.20. chapter is of the longitude and declination
of.32. notable fixed stars for Navigations, with tables of their shining, and
at what point of the compass they do both rise and set: it has also tables
for every monthe in the year, declaring at what time they will be South. etc.
which will continue these.100. years without much error. Fol. 51. b The.21.
chapter shows you the making of a general Instrument, to know the hour of
the day by through out all the world. Fol. 57. b The.22. chap. treats of the
soundings coming from any place out of the Occidentall Sea, to seek Vshant,
or the Lizarde, and so all along till you come to the coast of Flaunders:
with other necessary matters to be known for them that be Chanellers, that
occupy or deal amongst sands, banks. etc. Fol. 59. b The.23 chapter is as
touching the variation of the Compass, called the Northeasting and
Northweasting of the Compass: and how to give a guess to know the longitude.
