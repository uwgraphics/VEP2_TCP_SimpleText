A MOST HVMBLE SVPPLICATION UNTO THE KING, For present performance of long
purposed allowance, to open the Law in the letters and tongue of Adam: for
Jews and all the sons of Adam.

1609.

YOur Highness readiness, my liege Lord, to honor the Gospel, and the kingdom
which advaunced Constantine your Majesty's auncestour, to rule the world, is
now come to high hope, that Jews and Christians from Bizantias Rome to
Albion, desire an absolute treatise for this cause. If it please the K to
differ no longer, long expected allowance, these treatises promised to Jews
of Germany, as the Princes have my letters, shall be soon taken in hand. The
new Testament to speak by the phrases of Law and Thalmud, which the holy most
learned Apostles translate: next that, an Ebrew treatise showing that the
Prophets made this their mark: that God in Christ reconciled the world unto
him self. The third should enlarge al S. Paul's Epistles to the Ebrewes, by
consent of Rabbines in those times. The last should bring Rabbines upon the
old Testament, to teach the same that the new Testament has. I have
celebrated over the world, your Majesty's most religious asseveration in the
year of redemption 1596. For a thousand pounds an year for clearing the
Bible: and your message by a Knight your sewer of 500. pounds annuitie. As God
has blessed the King, so your Princely honor in the principal cause of all
study, will show ready Royal liberality: and stir up all the Princes of
Christendom, with speedy zeal without delay.

Your Majesty's most humble subject, H. Broughton.
