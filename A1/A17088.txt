ANE ADMONITION TO THE TRUE LORDIS. M. G. B.
IT may seem to your Lordschippis, that I melling with heigh materis of
governing of common welthis do pas mine estait, being of sa mean quality, and
forgettis my dewtie, giving counsall to the wisest of this Realm. Not the les
seeing the misery so greit apperyng, and the calamity sa neir approaching, I
thought it les fault, to incur the crime of surmounting my private estate, then
the blame of neglecting the publik danger. Thairfoir I chesid rather to underly
the opinion of presumptioun in speiking, the^ of treson in silence, and
specially of sic thingis as euin seem presently to redound to the perpetual
schame of your Lordschippes, distructioun of this royal estaite, and ruin of
the hole co^moun wealth of Scotland. On this consideratioun, I have takin in
hand at this time to advertise your honors of sic thingis as I thought to
appertene, both to your Lordschippis in special, and in general to the hole
community of this Realm, in punitioun of traytouris, pacificatioun of
troublis ama^gis your selfis, and continuatioun of peace with our nighbouris.
Of the quhilk I have takin the travel to write: and do remit the Judgment to
your discretioun, hopyng at leist, that although my wit and forsight shall not
satisfy you, yet my good will shall not displeis you, of quhilk advertisement
the sum is this.

First to consider how godly the actioun is quhilk you have in hand, to wit,
the defense of your King an Innocent pupil, the stablishyng of Religioun,
punitioun of thiefis and traitouris, and mantenance of peace and quietness
amongis your selfis and with forrane Natiounis.

Item remember how you have vindicat this Realm, from the thraldom of
stra^geris, out of domestik tyranny, and out of a publik dishonor in the
sight of all forrane natiounis, we being altogider estemid a pepill murtherars
of Kingis and impacient of Lawis and ingrait, in respect of the murder of the
late King Henry, within the wallis of the principal Town, the greatest of the
Nobility being present with the Queen for the time and by your power one pairt
of the chief Traitouris tried from amo^gis the true subiectis, quhairby
stra^geris were co^stranid afterwart as mekle to praise your justice, as of
befoir they wra^gfully condempnid your injustice.

Item remember how far in doing the same ye have obliged your selfis befoir the
hole world to continue in the same vertew of Justice, and quhat blame ye shall
incur, if ye be inconsta^t. For all me^ can belief na vtherwise, if the time
followyng be not conform to the time past, that nouther honor nor commoun
wealth stirrid you up then, but rather sum particulair tendyng to your priuait
commodity.

Also remember how many gentill and honest meanis you have soght, in times past
to cause the King be acknawledgid, and the contrary put at rest, and how
vnprofitabill has been your honesty in treityng, your vailyeant curage in
werr, your mercyfulnes in victory, your clemency in punischyng, and facility
in reconsiliatioun.

Quhilk thyngis witnessis sufficiently, that ye estemit na man enemy that wald
live in peace, under the Kingis authority, that ye were never desirous of blude,
geir, nor honor of sic as wald not, rather in making of troubill and
seditioun, declair tham selfis enemeis to God and the Kingis Majesty, than
live in concord and amity with their nightbouris under the correctioun of
Justice.

And sen ye can nouther bow their obstinate hight with patience, nor mease
their stubburne hartis with gentilnes, nor satisfy their inordinate desyris,
vtherwise then with the Kingis blude and youris, the destructioun of Religioun,
banisching of Justice, and free permission of cruelty, and misordour, your
wisdoms may easily considder quhat kind of medicine is not only mete but alsw
a necessair, for mending of sic a Malady.

And to the effect that ye may the better consider this necessity of medicine,
remember quhat kind of pepill they are, that professis them selfis in deid,
and disemblis in word, to be enemeis to God, to Justice, and to you, because ye
maintene the Kingis actioun.

Sum of tham ar conseilaris of the King his fatheris slauchter, sum conueyaris
of him to the schambles, that slew his Grandschir, banisched his father, and
not satisfyid to have slain him self, murtherit the Kingis regent, and now
seikes his awin blude, that they may fulfill thayr cruelie and avarice being
kingis, quhilk they begone to exercise the time of their governing.

Vthers ar, that being alliat, nor neir of kyn to the Hamiltounis, thinkis to
be participant of all their prosperity and succes.

Vthers being guilty of king Henryis death, in the first parliament halden in
the kyngis regne that now is, could well accord, that the Queen should have
been put to deith also. And seeing they could not obtene that point, the next
schift of thayr impiety was to put down the King, that he should not rest to
revenge his Fatheris deith, quhilk they thocht could not be mair easily done,
then by bringing home the Queen with sic a husband, that other for auld
haitred, or for new couatice, wald desire the first degree of succession to be
of his awin blude.

Sum vthers ar practiced in casting of Courtis and reuoluing of estatis, by
raising of civil werr, and ar becum richer than ever they hopid, and because
they have found the practice sa good in time past, now they seik all wayis to
continue it, and having ones gustid how good fisching it is in drumly waters,
they can by na manner leave the craft.

Vthers of that faction ar, sum papists, sum feined protestantis, that hes na
God bot geir, and desiris agane the papistrie, not for luif they beir to it
(for they ar scorners of all religioun) but hoiping to have promotioun of idle
belleis to benefices, and lamentis the present estait, quhair (as they say)
Ministeris gettis all, and leifis nathing to good fellowis, and to this intent
they wald set up the Quenis authority say they.

Sum their be also that under color of seiking the Quenis authority, thinkis
to eschaip the punischement of auld faultis, and have license in time to cum to
oppres their nichbouris, that be febiller then they.

Now have I to schew you by conjecture, quhat fruit is to be hopid of an
assembly of sic men, as for the may pairt are of insatiabill gredynes,
intollerabill arrogancy, without faith in promeis, measure in couatice, piety
to the inferior, obedience to the superior, in peace desirous of troubill, in
werr thirsty of blude, nuryshers of theft, raisers of Rebellion, counsallours
of Traitouris, inuenters of tresoun, with hand ready to murder, mind to
deceive, heart void of truth and full of fellonie, tongue trampid in dissait,
and word tending to falls practice without verity, by quhilk properteis and many
vthers thairunto ioynid as is knawin to all men, ye that vnderstandis their
beginning, progres and hole life, may easily remember, to quhome this general
speikyng-appertenis in special, and it is not unknown to sic as knawis the
personis, how they are mellid with godles persons Papists, harlot Protestantis,
commoun brybouris, holy in word, Hypocrites in heart, proud contempners or
Machiauill mockers of all Religioun and vertew, bludie boucheris and opin
oppressouris, fortifieris of the ifis, and manteneris of traitouris.

It is also necessary to your Lordschippis to understand their pretense, that
if it be a thing quhilk may stand with the tranquillity of the commoun wealth,
your Lordschippis may in sum pairt, rather condescend to their inordinate lust,
the^ put the hole estate in ieopardie of battle.

First, it is not honor, riches, nor authority that they desire, for they
have had, and als have presently, and may have in time to cum sic pairt of all
they thingis, as a priuait man may have in this Realm, not being chargeabill
to the country, or not suspectit to ane king, as vnassurit of his awin estait.

It is not the delyuerance of the Queen that they seik, as their doyngis
contrair to their word testifeis manifestly, for if they wald have her
deliuerit, they wald have procurit by all meanis possibill, the Queen of
Ingla^dis favor and support, in quhais power the hole recouerance stood only,
and not offendid her sa heichly as they have done, and daily dois in
participatioun of the conspyrit tresoun, to put her majesty not only our of
her stait, but out of this life present, nor in receityng and mantening of her
Rebellis co^trair to promeis and solemn contract of pacificatioun betuix this
two Realms, nouther yet have hou^dit forth, proud and uncircumspect young
men, to hery, burn, and slay, and take presoneris in her Realm, and use all
misordour and cruelty, not only used in weir, but detestabill to all barbar
and vile Tartaris, in slaying of presoneris and contrair to all humanity and
justice, keip na promeis to miserabill catiues received once to their mercy,
and all this was done by commandiment of sic as sayis they seik the Quenis
deliverance, and reprochit to them by the doaris of the mischiefis, saying
that they enterit tham in danger, and supportit tham not in mister, so mekle as
to cum to Lawder and luik from them, in quhilk deserting of their Collegis,
they schew cruelty joined with falsheid, and may heich tresoun against the
Queen, pretending in word her delyuerance, and stoppyng in warke her
recouerance, the quhilk as every man may cleirlie se they soght, as he that
soght his wife drowned in the River against the streime.

It is not the Quenis authority that they wald set up in her absence, for if
that were their intentioun, quhome can they place in it mair friendly to her
then her only Sone, or quhat Governor may they put to him les suspect, tha^
sic men as have na pretense of succession to the Crown, or any hoip of
proffeit to cum to tham after his deith, or they that ever have been true
seruandis to Kingis before him, should they not be preferrit to his paternall
enemeis, yea, and slayeris of his Father, and sollicitaris of strangeris to
seik his Innocent blude?

Quhat the^ shall we think that these me^ seikis under pretense of the Quenis
authority, seeing they can not bring hame the Queen to set up her, nor will not
suffer the king lawfully inaugurate and confirmed by decreit of Parliament, to
bruik it, with sa many of his Tutoris chosin by his mother, as are not to be
suspectit to will him harm, I traist it is not uneasy to perceive by their
hole progres now presently and in time by past, that they desire na other thing
but the deith of the King and Queen of Scotland, to set up the Hamiltounis in
authority, to the quhilk they have aspirit by crafty meanis these fyftie
yeiris ago. And seeing their purpois succedit not by crafty and secreit meanis,
now they follow the same trayde conioyning to falsheyde, opin wickitnes.

And that ye may see quhat meanis they have vsid their fyftie yeires by past, to
set up by craft this authority, quhilk now they seik by violence, force and
tresoun. I will call to your memory sum of their practisis, quhilk many of you
may remember asweill as I.

First after the deith of King James the Fourt John Duke of Albany chosin by
the Nobility to govern in the Kingis les age, The Hamiltounis thinkyng that
he had been als wickid as they, and should to his awin aduanceme^t put down
the King being of tender age for the time and by the deceis of his brother left
alone, and that they wald easily get their hand beyond the Duke, being an
stranger and without successioun of his body, held tham quiet for a season,
thinkyng that other men's actioun should be their promotion, but seeing that the
Duke as Prince both wise and verteous, to bring him self out of sic
suspitioun, put four Lordis estimid of the may true and verteous in Scotland
in that time to attend on the Kingis grace, to wit; the Earl Merchell, the
Lordis Erskyn, Ruthuen, and Borthicke, The Hamiltounis being out of hope of the
Kingis puttyng down by the Duke of Albany, and out of credeit to do him any
harm by tham selfis, maid one conspyracie with certane Lordis, to put the said
Duke out of authority, and take it on tham selfis, that all things put in
their power they might use the King and the Realm at their awin pleasure. To
that effect they took the Castle of Glasgow, and there maid an assembly of
their factioun, the quhilk was dissoluit by the hasty cummyng of the Duke of
Albany with an army, for feir of the quhilk the Earl of Arrane chief of that
cumpany, ded to his wifis brother the Lord Hume being then out of Court.

The second conspiracy was after the Dukis last departing (the foresaid Lordis
separate from attending on the king) deuysit by Schir James Hammiltoun bastard
son to the said Earl of Arrane, quha conspirit the Kings deith then being in
his house in the Abbay of Halyruidhous, quhilk couspiracie ester many yeiris
reueillit, the said Schir James sufferit deith for it. This conspiracy not
being execute, Schir James perseuerid in his evil intentioun, and by secreit
meanis in Court soght alwais that the king should not mary that for lack of his
succession, the Hamiltounis might cum to their intentis. For the king was young,
lusty, and ready to adventure his persoun to all hasardis, both by sea and land,
in down putting of theifis, and vpsetting of Justice. The Hamiltounis luiked on
quhen seiknes, throw excess of travel, or sum other rakles aue^ture should cut
him of without children, and destitute of this hope, first he stopped the
kingis metyng with his uncle the king of Ingland, quha at that time having but
one daughter, was willing to haif maryid with the king of Scotland, and maid
him king of the hole I Will after him, and to have enterid him at that present
time in possession of the Duchy of York, but the said Schir James ever having
eye to his awin scope, hinderid this purpois by sum of the Kingis familiaris,
that he had practiced with by giftis, and specially by the Bischop of
Sanctandros James Betoun, uncle to the Earl of Aranis mother, and greit uncle
to Schir James wife, and raised sic suspitioun betuix the two Kingis, that
brought both the realms in greit besines.

This purpois as said is put abak, the King seeing that his Ambassadouris
furtherit not at his pleasure, deliuerid him self in persoun to ga by sey in
France, and Schir James Hamiltoun perseuering in his former inte^tion went with
him to hinder his marriage, by all menis that he might, and to that effect, the
King sleiping in the Schip, without any necessity of wind and wedder, Schir
James caused the marineris to turn saill of the West coist of Ingland bacwart
and land in Galloway, quhair the King was varray miscontent with Schir James
and Master David Panter, principal causeris of his returnyng, as diverse that
was in the Schip yet living can report. And fra that time forth, the King
having tried out his pretense, and persaiuing his unfaithful dealyng ever
disfauoured him, and to his greit displesure fauourid opinlie the Earl of
Lennox and his freindis in his abse^ce, the quhilk Earl pretended a right and
tytill to the hole Erldome of Arrane, the present Earl for that time being
knawin to be bastard, as also it was in men's recent memory how Schir James
Hamiltoun had cruelly slain the Earl of Lennox at Linlythgow, euin to the
great displesure of the Earl of Arrane father to Schir James, and uncle to the
Earl of Lennox, coming by the Kingis commandiment to Linlythgow. Sa the King
as said is, understanding the private practike of Schir James, in keipyng him
vnmaryid, haistit him the mair eirnestlie to mary, to the effect, that his
successioun might put the Hamiltounis out of hope of their intent, and him out
of danger by the Hamiltounis. And albeit that Schir James to make him self
clean of that suspitioun, soght many diueris wayis to the distructioun of the
Earl of Arrane his brother, yet he could never co^queis the Kingis favor,
until finally he was executid for tresoun, and took ane miserabill end
conform to his ungodly life.

The King at last decessit, and leuing a daughter of sex dayis auld, the
Hamiltounis thought all to be thairis. For then the Earl of Arranea young man of
small wit and great inconstancy, was set up by sum of the Nobility, and sum
familiar seruandis of the kingis lately deceissit, for they thought him mair
tollerabill the^ the Cardinal Beton, quha by ane falls instrument had takin the
supreme authority to him self.

The Earl of Arrane namid Governor, by a priuait factioun, and fauourid by sa
many as professit the true Religioun of Christ, because he was beleift then to
be of the same, howbeit he was gentil of nature, yet his freindis for the may
pairt, were gredie both of geir and blud, and geuin to injustice quhair gain
followid. Their was in his time nothing ellis, but werr, oppression, and
brybing of his callid brother the Bischop of Sanctandrois, sa that all the
Estatis were werie of him, and dischargid him of his office, and charged with it
an woman strangear.

In the beginning of his government the Queen and her mother were keipit by
him, rather like presoneris then Princessis, but yet that incommoditie was cause
of preseruyng of the Quenis life, he beleifing to mary her on his sone. But
after the Earl of Lennox had delivered tham out of his handis, and the
Nobility had refusid to mary her on his sone, howbeit he left his ferme
freindis, and come to the Queen, abiurid his Religion in the gray freieis of
Striuiling, yet he could never cum agane to his pretendid clymmyng to the
Crown, quhilk he had lang soght, partly by favor of sic of the Nobility as
were alliat with him, and partly by distructioun of the ancient housis that
might haif put impediment to his vnreasonabill ambition. For having banished
the Earl of Lennox, he thought the Earl of Angous to be the principal that
might resist him, and having enterid in waird Schir George Douglas, to be yet
mair assurid, he send for the said Earl of Angous in freindly manner, and put
him in prisoun without any just occasioun, and would have beheadid them both,
if the arriving of the Inglis army had not stayit his purpois, by the quhilk,
and feir of the murmour of the pepill, he was constranit to deliver tha^. And
seeing he durst not at sic a time put tham down by tyranny, he offerit tham to
the sword of the enemy to be slain by tham. And to the effect that they and
thayr freindes, having put aback the Inglis horsemen, and receiving an other
charge, might be the mair easily slain, they standing in battle and fighting
for him, he in the battle behind fled to (...) tham, and sa these Nobill men
sa far as lay in him was slain, and preseruid by the providence of God.

The young Queen quhilk being in her motheris keiping, he might not put down,
nor mary at his pleasure, he consentid to offer her to the storms of the sea,
and danger of enemeis, and sold her as a slave in France, for the Duchy of
Chastellarault, the quhilk he bruikis in Name only, as the Crown of Scotland
in fantasy, and receauit sic price for her as tresoun, perjury, and the
sellyng of fre persounis should be recompensit with. But yet the couatise of
the Crown that he had sold cessid not heir, for befoir her returning hame out
of France, at the troubillis quhilk began anent the repressing of the
Frenchemen and tyranny agains the Religioun, how many meanis soght the
Hamiltounis to have depryuit her of all right, and translatit the Crown to
tham selfis, is knawin both to Scotland and Ingland.

Also after the Quenis arriuyng in Scotland, sche seikyng a querrell against
the said Duike and sum other Lordis, under pretense that they had conspyrit
against her, for the Religionis cause, the Duikis freindis left him all, because
that the rest of the Lordis wald not consent to destroy the Queen, or derogat
her authority by any manner of way. A litill befoir the quhilke time, the
occasioun of the Dukis conspyracie, with the Earl Bothwell to slay the Earl of
Murray in Falkland, was na other, but because the said Earl of Murray living,
they could nouther do the said Queen harm in her persoun, nor diminische her
authority, nor constrane her to mary at their pleasure, and to her utter
displeasure.

After that the Queen had maryit with him, quhom they estemid thayr auld
enemy, and was with child, the good Byschop of Sanctondrois first callid
Cuningham, estemit Cowane, and at last Abbot Hamiltoun, not only conspyrit
with the Earl Bothwell, but come with the Queen to Glasgow, and conuoyit the
King to the place of his murder, the Bischop being ludged, as he was seildom
or never of befoir, quhair he might persaif the pleasure of that cruelty with
all his sensis, and help the murtheraris, if mister had been, and send four of
his familiar seruandis to the execution of the murder, watchyng all the night,
and thinkyng lang to have the joy of the cummyng of the Crown a degree neirer
to the house of Hamiltoun, and sa greit hoip mellit with ambition inflamit his
heart for the Kingis deceis, that with in schort time he beleuid firmly his
callid brother to be King, and he (the said Bischop) to be to him as curatour
during the hole time of his non wit, quhilke had been a langer teirme than
Witsonday or Martymes, for he thought vndoubtidlie, that the Earl Bothwell
should distroy the young Prince, and not suffer him prosper to revenge his
fatheris deith, and precede the Erlis children in successioun of the crown,
and the young Prince onis cut of, the Bischop maid his reknyng, that the Queen
and the Earl Bothwel hated already for the slaughter of the king her husband,
and mair for the innocent, were easy to be destroyit with consent of all
estatis, and the crime easy to the Bischop to be prouid, quha knew all the
secretis of the hole disseigne* or if they wauld slay the Earl Bothwell, and
spair the Queen, they were in hope she should marry John Hamiltoun the Dukis
son, quhome with merry luikes and gentill countenance (as sche could weill
do) sche had entered into the pastyme of the Glaikis, and causit the rest of the
Hamiltounis to fond for fainnes. But after that the Earl Bothwell had refusit
battle at Carbarry hill, and the Queen befoir the coming of the Hamiltounis,
come to the Lordis, the Hamiltounis as that time disapointit, fosterit their
vain hope with a merry dreme, that the Queen should be punischit after her
demeritis, and were a time in dowbill joy, that one that beying rid of the
Queen sche should not beir ma children to debar tham from the Crown: and the
other, that they might have ane easy way to calumniat the Regent for
distroying of the Queen. But seeing her kept, they blamit openly the Regent,
quha kept her in stoir in dispite of tham (as they said) to be a stud to cast
ma foillis, to hinder tham of the succession of the Crown, yet for all that,
their wald none of tham cum to Parliament to further their desire with ane
anerely vote, but lay back to keip them selfis at liberty, to repro if all
that should be done in that conuentioun, and to fenze favor towardis the Queen
quhome they hatit, sa as if by consent of the Lordis or vtherwise sche were
deliuerit, they might help her to put down the Lordis, that would not put her
down in favor of tham.

This their intentioun was opinly schawit, quhen the Queen being kept in
Lochleuin, by commandment of the hole Parliament, was deliuerit by
conspiracy of sum private men, especially of the Hamiltounis, for they
assemblit all thayr forces to put down the young King and Lordis obediente to
him. Quhilk evil will they schew towardis the Lordis at the Langside, bringing
with them great stoir of cordis, to murder and hang them, if they had been
taken prisoneris and the victory fallen to the Hamiltounis, and the same evil
will towardis the King in keipyng the water of Forth, that he should not
eschaip thayr cruel handis, being assuerit if he come in the Queen of
Inglandis power, that sche of her accustomate clemency and kindness of blude,
wald not abandoun him to thayr unmerciful cruelty experimentit already in his
father. And seeing that the providence of God had cloisit the door to all their
wickitnes at that times, they have never ceissit since to seike enemeis to his
Grace in all strange Natiounis, and perceiuyng that they had fair wordis of
all vtheris, except of the Quenis Majesty's of England, quha understood their
falls and tressonabill dealyng, they turnit their hatred against her, and
enterid in conspyracie with sum tratouris of Ingland, that were als evil mindit
towardis the Quenis Majesty their souerane, as the Hamiltounis were to the
Kingis hienes of Scotland. This is nouther dremid in wardrop, nor hard throw a
boir, but a true narratiue, of quhilke the memory is ludged in menis hartis,
both Scottis and strangeris and the verity knawin. By the quhilke ye may
understand the Hamiltounis pretense this fifty yeiris and mair.

After sa many wayis soght by them to distroy the right successioun, and place
tham in the Kynglie rowme, seeing all their practisis could not auaill, and
their forces were not sufficient, they soght to augment their factioun,
adioynyng to them all, that were participant of the Kyngis slaughter, and had
aspyrit to slay the Queen of Ingland. And to the effect they might cum to their
wickit purpois, they in a manner displayit a baner, to assemble together all
kind of wickid me^, as Papists, renegat Protestantis, theifis, traitouris,
murtheraris, and opin oppressouris. As for their adherentis in Scotland I neid
not to expreme their namis, nor the qualiteis of the conspyratouris of Ingland,
for they ar weill enough knowin to your Lordschippis. Yet one I can not
ouerpas, being the chief conspyratour chosin by them to be King of Scotland
and Ingland, I mean the Duike of Norfolk, in quhilke act ye may see how the
thrist of your blude blindit them against their awin utility. First they
chose the principal enemy of the Religioun of Christ in this i will, accompanyit
with other filthy Idolateris, to change the stait of the Kirk in both Realms
by cuttyng of the two Princes, seeing that their authority standing, the
conspiratouris could not cum to their intent. Next they respect it in that
proud tyranne, the vertewis that were commoun to him and tham, as arrogancy,
cruelty, dissimulatioun and tresoun, for euin as they had this lang time in
Scotland, sought the deith of their righteous Prince, sa he in Ingland
followyng the traide of his antecessouris, diueris times attemptyng tresoun,
wald have put down the Queen of Ingland. Heir alswa appeiris the Hamiltounis
cruelty against the Nobility of their awin Natioun, in seikyng their
professit and perpetual enemy of Scotland (as his bage beiris witness) quha
should have spilt the rest of the noble blud of Scotland in peace, that his
antecessouris could not spill in werr, by quhilk electioun, being assurit that
na Scottis heart can love them, sa can they love nane of you, against quhome,
they have vsit sa many tresonabill actis. They do schaw also how cruelty and
avarice have blindit tham that they ca^ not se in bringyng a tyranne to have
power over them, seeing they pretending neyrest clame to the crown, should be
neirest the danger. And vit for all this could these men be weill contentit, if
by any means they could attene to their intent, by spoil and rubberie, as
they did quhen as they were placid in supreme authority, or by making of you
slaves as they did in selling of thayr Queen, begin that practice quhairin
howbeit the inhumanitie was great, yet was it not in supreme degree of
cruelteis, but it is na moderat, tolerable, nor accustomate thing that they
seike: It is the blud first of our innocent king, euin sic as has been
preseruit by wild beastis, nixt the blude of all his true seruandis and true
subiectis indifferently. For quhat defense can be in Nobility, or quhat
suirtie againis tham that half murtherit a King, and seikis strangeris to
murder ane other King, quhome shall they spair for virtue and innocence, that
lately executit, and yet defendis the murder of the Regent, or quha will be
ouerseene for law, degree or base estait, in respect of they that conductit out
of Tiuidaill to slay Master Iohnne Wod, for na other cause, but for being a
good seruand to the Crown, and to the Regent his Master, and had espyit out
sum of their practisis.

If this thirst of blud of these Lochlechis, might be imputit to haistie
hounger or any sodane motion, quhilk causis men sum times to forget their
dewtie, there might yet be sum hope, that sic a passioun ouerpast, they wald
with time remember them selfis, and after power amend faultis past, or at
leist abstene in time to cum. But their is na sic humanity in thayr nature,
nor na sic piety in thayr hartis, for not contentit with a Kingis blude, they
gaip for his Sonnis murder, nor satisfyit to have slain the Regent, they
keipit the murtherar in the Duikes house in Arrane. May like thinking, as if
they honourit not the doar, they should not be knawin as counsallouris of the
deid, and wald tyne the glory of that nobill act. And besides all this they
are not only contentit to mantene Scottis tratouris, but alswa receifis
Inglis tratouris, and settis up a sanctuary of tresoun, a refuge of Idolatry,
a receptacle of theifis and murtheraris.

And howbeit the bullerant blud of a King and a Regent about their hartis, qu
hair of the lust in their appetite geuis tham litil rest, daily and hourelie
making new provocation, yet the small space of rest, quhilk they have beside
the executioun of their cruelty, they spend in deuysing of general
unquietness, throw the hole country, for not content of it, that they tham
selfis may steal, brybe, and reif, they set out ratches on every side, to gnaw
the pepillis bonis, after that they have consumit the flesche, and houndis out,
one of them, the Cla^gregour, ane other the Grantie and Clauchattan, ane other
Balcleuch and Fairnyherst, ane other the Iohnstounis and Armestrangis, and sic
as wald be haldin the haliest ama^gis tham, schew playnlie the affectioun they
had to banishe peace and steir up troublis, quhen they bendit all their five
wittis, to stop the Regent to go first North, and syne South, to puneis theift
and oppressioun, and quhen they saw that their counsall was not authorisit, in
geuyng impunitie to all misdordour, they spend it in puttyng down of him that
wald have put all in good ordour.

Their is a kind of these theifis euin odious to mair gentill theifis, quhilk
calling them selfis great Gentilmen spoyllis trauellaris, cadgearis, and
chapmen by the way, and ransounis pure men about Ediburgh for xx. schillyng
the heid, quhilke vice can not proceed of vengeance of enemeis, but rather of
love and pleasure in wickitnes. This kind of men dois not only dishonor to
Nobility in steillyng, and to theifis in purspyking, but also to the hale
Natioun of Scotland, geuyng opinioun to strangeris, that sum of the Scottis be
of sa law courage, that men amangis tham aspiryng, to the hiest estait of a
Kingdom, have crouchit them selfis in the may law order of knaifis.

Now my Lordis ye may consider, how they that slayis sa cruelly Kyngis and
thayr Lieutennentis, will be merciful to you, and quhen they sall have put you
down, that craifis revenge of the Kyngis blude, ye may understand how few dare
craif Justice of your slaughter. Ye may se how cruel they will be in
oppression of the poor, having cut of you, quhilke being of may Nobill and
potent housis of this Realm, sufferis throw your sleuthfulnes every pairt of
this country, to be maid worse than Laddisdaill, or Annarderdaill, and not
only sufferis the purspykaris of Cliddisdaill, to exercise theift and reif as
a craft, but nurisis and authorisis amangis you, the chief counsellaris of all
misordour, as ane Edder in your bosum. Of all this ye may lay the wit on na
other but vpoun your selfis, that have sufficient power to repress their
insolency, and proudnes, having in your hand the same wande that ye have
chaistifit tham with of befoir, for ye have your protector the same God this
yeir, that was the yeires bypast, vnchangeabill in his eternal counsellis,
constant in promeis, potent in punising, and liberal in rewairdyng, ye have
your true freindis and seruandis that were with you of befoir, ye ar deliuerit
of dissimulate brethren, that had their bodyis with you, and their hartis with
your enemeis, that subscribit with you, and tuik remissioun of your
aduersareis, that stuide with you in battle, luiking for occasioun to betray
you, had not God been your protector. Ye have a great number of new freindis
alienate from tham, for their manifest iniquity in deid, wickidnes in word, and
tresoun in heart, ye have of the saime enemeis that ye had then sa many, as hes
thayr hartis hardennit, and thayr myndis bent against God, and lawful
ingraitis, ye have the same action, that ye had then, accumulat with recent
murder and tresoun, to provoke the ire of the eternal, against tham, How far
God has blindid tham. blind men may se, that having sa evil ane actioun, and
sa many enemeis at hame, yet be houndyng out of small traytouris of thayr
wickid conspiracy, men execrabill to thayr awin parentis, quhome amangis
vthers they have diverse times spoylit, by hounding out I say of sic persounis,
to burn, murder, reif, and steill. They provoke the Quenis Majesty of
Ingland, to seik vengeance of thayr oppressioun against her Realm and
subiectis, quhilk vengeance Justice and honor craifis of her sa instantly,
that sche can not ceis but pursew them, thayr resettaris and mantenaris, until
sche gyif sic exempill to vthers, that althought they will not respect virtue,
yet for feir of punitioun they sall be content to live in peace with
nightbouris, quhairin her heighnes has already renuit the memory of her
experimentit liberality, and tender love to this Natioun, seikyng on her
propir charges and travel of her subiectis, the punitioun of sic, as we on our
charges should have punished, I mean not only of our tratouris, but also
ressettaris of her Maiesteis tratouris, and in doing of this se^kis
pacificatioun amangis tham that violatid peace with her without prouocatioun,
seuering the punischment of sic as ar guilty in offending, from the subiectis
that hes not violatid the peace. And as sche kepis peace and Justice amangis
her awin subiectis in Ingland, sa vnrequyrit sche offerid support to the same
end in Scotland, and not only geuis remedy to our present calamiteis, but
cuttis the root of troublis to cum, and preuenis the wickid counsall of sic,
as prouokis Inglismen, and solistis Frenchmen to cum in this Realm, to the
end, that these two Natiounis enterit in bars, the ane agains the other,
they may saciat thayr cruel hartis of blude, their obstinate will of
vengeance, their bottomless couatise of spoil and theift.

Thairfoir seeing God have sa blindit your enemeis wittis, my Lordis be in good
hope that he sall alswa cast the spreit of fear and disperatioun in their
indurat hartis, and prosper your good actioun, to the quhilk he confortis you
with his ready help, exhortis you by his word, and constrainis you by the
dewtie of your estait, and necessity of preseruyng of your lyfis and honouris.
For promeis being neglectit, says violatid, subscriptioun set at noght, their
is na mean way left but outher to do or suffer, and seeing that both ar
miserabill amangis sic, as should be freindis, yet better it is to slay justly
than to be slain wrangfullie. For the executioun of Justice in punischyng the
wickid is approuid by God and man, and sleuthfulnes in defense of Justice can
not be excusid of tresoun. And besides that God schawis him sa merciful and
liberal to you, in sending you freindis by procuiring of your enemeis, also
the persounis may recommendit of God crai^is the same, for saikles blude,
oppressioun of the pure, and of the fatherles, cryis continually to the heuin
for auengeance, quhilke God committis to your handis as his Lieutennentis and
special officiaris in that pairt, and euin as he rewardis faith and diligence
in obedience of his eternal will, sa he will not neglect to punische
sleuthfulnes in just executioun of his commandementis.

Thairfoir my Lordis, as ye wald that God should remember on you and your
posterity, quhen they sall call on him in their necessity, remember on your
King our Souerane, and on my Lord Regentis pupillis, committit to you in
tutorie by the reasoun of your office and estait, anent persounis that are not
in age nor power to help tham selfis and are recommendit specially to all
Christianis by God in his holy Scripture, and defend sic innocent creaturis, as
may nouther do nor speike for them selfis, from the cruelty of unmercifully
wolfis: neglect not the occasioun, nor refuse not the help send to you by God,
but recognose thankefully his favor towardis you, that causis your enemeis to
procure your help, neglect not the offer of frendis. In cais if ye let slyp
this occasioun, ye sall craif it in vane in your necessity. Think it na les
providence of your heuinly father, then if he had send you ane legioun of
Angellis in your defense, and remember that he schew him self never mair
freindfull and succurable, to na pepill than he has done to you, and traist
well if ye will perseueir, in obedience and recognoscence of his grace he will
multiply his benefits to you and your posterity, and sall never leif you,
until ye forget him first.

FINIS.
