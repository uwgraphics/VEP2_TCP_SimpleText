LUCIUS, ANNAEUS, SENECA THE PHILOSOPHER: HIS BOOK OF THE Shortness of LIFE.
Translated into an ENGLISH Poem.

Multum ille ad bonam mentem profecit, cuj Seneca placere caepit.

Lipsius. Imprinted at London for Daniel Friar, at the red Bull in little
Britain. 1636.

TO THE LEARNED AND Judicious, Sir Henry Wotton.
Sir,
YOur Approbation of some wandering Papers, brought casually to your sight, and
whispered to be mine, inuites me to own this, and send it abroad secured by
the Safe Conduct of Your Judgment: I venture to transform a Stoic into one of
the Muses, to reduce to Harmony a rigid piece of Philosophy; and because an
Imperial Envy, and therefore the highest, (that which designed the suppression
of Homer, Virgil, and Livie,) censured the Authors Works, to be but Arena sine
calce, I have without any violence knit up His short Book of the Shortness of
Life, into a natural Poem; which may be thus far useful, that the Readers
memory may retain his Acute and Redundant wit with more facillity: I make the
address to you, thereby to prefixe a President, that wisely spins out this
narrow Thread of Life in the way prescribed; which Remarkable Example (that
being all the Addition I make) must needs contribute no small vigor to the
Precepts of Seneca.

In Senecae de brevitate vitae Librum Elegantissime Translatum.
OBstruitur tanto mortalis vita dolor,
Taedeat ut longae semita ducta viae.
Tam suavis Senecae stilus, et Translatio libri
Vt placeat multas far relecta vices
Esse brevem cuperem misero sub tempore vitam
Sed longum vitae de brevitate librum.
G. A.

Metaphrasti Dignissimo.
TO Translate Seneca, and to observe
His Brevity, and from his sense not swerue,
Require's a Learned Judgment even in Prose;
But him in Verse to render, and yet lose
Neither his Quicknes, nor his Eloquence,
Shows both great Skill and our Tongu's Excellence;
Thus by this happy Version may we see,
That the Acutest Prose is Poetry,
And may believe that Seneca' as in name
Both Poet and Philosopher's the same.

L. A. SENECA OF THE Shortness of Life.
MOst men (Paulinus) make it Natures crime,
That we are borne to a small part of time,
Which does so speedily, so swiftly run,
That life with most is in the entrance done;
Nor do the Rude and Ignorant alone
Under this common conceived evil groan;
But it has drawn (out of an inward sense)
Complaints from men of greatest Eminence;
Hence did the chief Physician exclaim,
That Art is long, Life short to learn the same;
And Aristotl' expostulate with Nature
(More then a Wiseman ought) to the brute creature
As most indulgent, since some kind appears
To live five hundred, some a thousand years,
Whilst man to High and Noble things designed
Is to a far less term of life confined.
The time we have's not short; but much we lose,
Our life, if of the whole we well dispose,
Is long enough, and of a large extent
To bring great things to their accomplishment:
But when it is not virtuously employed*
But with excess or idleness destroyed*
Death us at length surprising, life is spent
Before we have perceived how it went;
Life is not given, but made short; nor poor
Can we be said, but prodigal of store;
For as great Riches falling in the power
Of a lewd Spend-all vanish in an hour,
And means though small, committed to the care
Of a good Husband, soon increased are;
So life well used is long enough;
Why then
Is Nature charged to have dealt ill with men?
Some to infatiat Avarice are bent;
Others to fruitless labors are intent;
This drenched is with Wine; that, dulled with Sloth,
This man's ambiton leaves him to the Wrath
And will of others; that, in hope of gain
Seeks Lands, and Seas his Traficke to maintain;
Some take delight in War, busied about
Other men's Ruins, while their own they doubt;
Some into willing servitude are brought,
Which an ingrate dependency has wrought;
Many do either earnestly affect
Other men's fortunes, or their own neglect;
Most, unresolved whereto themselves to apply,
Through vain and self displeasing levity
Fall still upon new proiects; some again
Misliking every course of life, remain
Yawning till death; so that, what has been said
And as an Oracle delivered
By that great Poet, we for truth may give,
'Ts the least part of Life that we do live:
The rest is only Time not Life; they are tied
And compassed by vice on every side,
They cannot raise themselves, nor lift their eyes
To behold truth, and from their strong Lusts rise;
They never will find leisure to retire
Into themselves; or if some good desire
They chance to have, it is like, but at the best
The Sea, that though Winds cease, is not at rest;
Their passions will afford them noe repose;
Nor would I have thee think I speak of those
Notoriously bad; they whom the World
Calls happy, are into like evils hur'ld;
How many men's great Riches have been found
An heavy weight to press them to the ground?
Many to boast their Eloquence so strain
Themselves, they dye by Rupture of a Vein?
How many have we seen grow pale and wan
With their continual pleasures? many a man
Compassed with troops of Suitors, is thereby
Deprived quite of his own liberty;
Nay run through all degrees; one goes to law,
Another Pleades the cause; this stands in awe
Of Power which threatens death, that him defends
An other will be Judge, and make them friends;
But none does to himself himself redeem;
We mutually are wasted; those that seem
Of greatest note, do with a fond respect
Court one another, and themselves neglect;
It is a folly therefore beyond Sense,
When great men will not give us Audience
To count them proud; how dare we call it pride
When we the same have to our selves denied
Yet they how great, how proud so ere, have bin
Sometimes so courteous as to call thee in,
And hear thee speak; but thou could nere afford
Thy self the leisure of a look or word*
THou should not then here in another blame,
Because when thou thy self do do the same
Thou would not be with others, but we see
Plainly, thou can not with thine own self be;
Not all the wits that are, should they conspire,
This humane blindness could enough admire;
They will have none to meddle with their Farms,
And if their bounds be questioned are in Arms;
But yet will suffer others to incroach
Upon their lives, and to their great reproach,
They will not stick officiously to call
Such as will at the length be Lords of all;
To share his money no man can abide;
Their lives twixt many all men will devide;
In keeping their Estate strict care they use;
But, come to expense of time, they are most profuse;
Of what alone (though in it self a vice)
Is an especial virtue, Avarice;
With some old man let us thus expostulate;
Thou have, we see, run through life's u^most date,
Attained perhaps, an hundred years or more,
But tell us now; how much from that great store
Thy Creditor has got, thy Mistress, Friend,
Thy Clients, or the Jar (that has no end)
Between thy wife and thee? how much is spent
In chastising thy Slaves? in Complement,
And Visits through the town? add here the cure
Of maladies, thou did thy self procure,
Time lost in doing nothing; and behold
Thou have far fewer years then thou have told:
Consider well what day has been employed
As thou determin'st, how thou have enjoyed
Thy self, or have been constant to thy ends,
Kept thy mind right, what good thine age pretends
To Have ever done, how many have bereaved
Thee of thy life when thou have not perceived,
When foolish joy, vain hope, greedy desire,
And flattering company their shares require,
But a small part will to thy self belong,
And then thou must confess thou dyest young.
But what is the cause? we live, as if for ever
We were to live, minding our frailties never?
We husband not our time, but let it fly
As if we had a Storehouse to supply,
When as perhaps, that day set to be past
Upon that thing, or man, will be our last;
As Mortal, all things sordidly we fear,
And as Immortal, our Ambitions rear:
At fifty Years some say they will retire,
And at threescore believe they shall desire
To quit their offices: but who can give
Assurance, that we shall to that time live
To Effect our purpose? what vain thought us drives
To give our selves the Relics of our lives;
And that time only unto goodness lend,
That otherwise we know not how to spend?
That man has certainly too late begun
To live, that only lives when life is done;
What madness is it to defer our rest.
Till fifty 'or threescore years? and think it best
Then to begin our life, when only some,
And perhaps few, will unto that age come?
The greatest Princes often have words let fall
Wherein they wish, commend, prefer 'bove all
A quiet life; and (might it safely be)
Would be content to quit their dignity
For though no outward danger should assail,
Yet fortune will against her self prevail.
DIvine Augustus (t'whom the Gods gave more
Then any mortal man) would often deplore
The misery that waits upon a Crown,
And still desire to lay the burden down,
His chief discourse to this did ever tend,
That in a private life his cares should end;
This hope, though vain, did sweet contentment give,
That at the length he to Himself should live:
In an Epistle to the Senate sent,
Where he desired to let them know, he meant
That his so often mentioned retreat,
Should be with reservation of his state,
Such words I find. But these things rather ought
Be done, then said; yet so far has the thought.
Of that wished time prevaild, that though the glad
Fruition of the thing he yet not had,
Yet I, in the discourse I thereof make
Do in the mean time no small pleasure take:
So did he value rest, that when he could
Not compass it in deed, in thought he would;
He that saw all depend upon his will,
And unto men and Nations, good or ill
Gave as he list, thought gladly on that day
Wherein his greatness he should put away;
He found what secret cares, and how much sweat
Such farre-renowned Honor did beget;
When first by Citizens, by Colleagues next,
And lastly by his Kindred deeply vexed,
He was compeld (so powerfully withstood)
By land and Sea, to try it out with blood;
Through Macedonia, Egypt, Cicily,
Through Asia, Syria, and the coast thereby
He led his Armies forth to foreign wars
Weari'd with slaughter in our Roman iarres;
While he the Alps appeased, did such reduce
As in the Empire lived in doubtful truce;
While beyond Rhene, Danubius, Euphrates,
He did his bounds remove, in midst of these
Great acts, in Rome it self did Lepidus,
Muraena, Caepio, and Egnatius
Whet all their Swords against him; and before
This threatening danger he had well past ore,
His daughter, with so many Nobles bound
B'Adultry, as by vow, sought to confound
His yet unbroken age; that once more he
Might fear a woman with her Anthony:
And though these ulcers with the members two,
He quite cut off, yet others quickly grew;
So bodies still break out, that are oppressed
With too much blood; he therefore sought for rest;
There dwelt his thoughts, to that his hopes aspired,
That could give others all that they desired.
When Cicero by the malicious fewde
Of Catalines, and Clodians persude,
By Pompey and Crassus greiv'd, those foes professed,
These doubtful friends, could not find any rest
In the perplexed State, which he desired
To save from ruin, he at length retired;
No less inconstant in adversity
Then he was active in prosperity;
His Consulship that he did so commend,
Though not without a cause, yet without end,
How did he then detest? what heaviness
Writing to Atticus did he express?
Old Pompey vanquished, and his Son in Spain,
His broken troops now gathering up again,
Do thou demand what I do here? (quoth he)
In Tusculanum I remain half free:
He further adds where he bewailes time past,
Condemns the present, and despaires at last
Of what is to come; did Cicero but call
Himself half free? a Wise man never shall
Descend so low; but half he cannot be,
Unbound, entirely himself, he is wholly free;
For being above fortune, nothing can
Be ever thought to be above that man.
WHen Livius Drusus one of a bold spirit,
Did strive the Grachi's mischief, to inherit
And to obtrud new Laws, followed by all
The Italian rout, scarce weighing what might fall,
Finding no hope to compass his design,
Which he with safety could not then decline,
He cursed his life, who (as he often would say)
Was the only boy that nere had leave to play;
He durst presume though yet but one of those,
That wore the Robe of Youth, to interpose
For guilty men, and in such earnest sort
That he did many sentences extort;
What would not that ambition undergo?
Such forward impudence brings certain woe,
Private and public; therefore he too late
Complained of want of play-daies, whom the state
And Justice, from a boy pernicious found;
Some thought he slew himself, for of a wound
Peircing his Groyne he did, the means unknown,
But the act thought unseasonable by none.
Twere vain to speak of more, whom vulgar fame
Has happy called, since selfe-convincing shame
Their whole life past has taught them to condem;
But these complaints nor others changed, nor them
For though such words brak from them, yet the will
And the affections have remained still;
A Life so led, although a thousand years,
Seems to best raightned much and short appears;
Such things devour an Age; though nature run
Her course, lengthned by Art, yet life's soon done;
For men observe not, nor give timely stay
To what is most swift, but let it pass away
As needless, or to be regained at pleasure;
I name those first that can afford no leisure
To any thing but Wine, and Lust, such time
Is vildly spent: Others, although they climb
With a vain glorious hope, more brauely' offend,
The Covetous, the Wrathful, they that bend
Their actions to unjust revenge, or war,
Have more pretense, Their crimes more manly are,
The sins of Lust are base; do thou suruay
The actions of most men, they spend the day
Only in counting money, plotting still
How to deceive, or fearing the like ill,
Giving or taking favors, waging law,
Or making feasts, which custom now does draw
As duties on them, between good and bad
They Are so turmoyl'd, no breathing can be had;
And it is confessed by all; that they that dwell
In too much business, can do nothing well;
Nor Eloquence, nor liberal Arts can find
Any admittance, when the busied mind
Not able to look up, with care is cloyd,
They that continually are so imployd,
Do nothing less then live, a thing discernd
By very few, and hardly to be learnd
Of other Sciences, professors are
In every place; yea boys have proved so rare
They have been teachers; but we must apply
Even all our life to live, nay all to dye:
Which many Wise men quitting both their treasures
Their worldly affairs, their offices, their pleasures,
And ready to depart hence, have professed
Not yet to know; how short then are the rest?
We may (believe me) truly think a man
Raised above humane error, when he can
So keep his time, that it be shard by none;
Life then is long, when it is all our own.
No part will to the owner useless be,
Nor subject to an others will; for he
That knows to husband time, think's nothing fit
Nor worthy here, to be exchanged for it:
He therefore has enough, while they that spend
It on the people, quickly find an end;
Nor can we therefore think from hence that such
Know not their loss, how many with too much
Felicity oppressed, amidst the Rout
Of Suitors, their law cases, or about
Some other honest misery, have cride
That time to live was unto them denide?
Which we may well believe, since all that make
Use of thy help, do something from thee take;
How much has he whom thou defend'st? or he
That by thy help expects some dignity?
Or that old Woman, that with clamor fills
Thine ears, with proving many Husbands wills?
How much has he that sicknesses does faigne
And by deluding others hopes makes gain?
Or that great friend, by whom thou art only sure;
To be regarded as his Furniture?
Recount (I say) thy days, and thou shall find
Only the reffuse to thy self assigned:
This gets the Consulship so much desired,
And then asks when the year will be expired*
That provids public sports, obtained with large
Expense, and straight grows weary of the charge:
This Lawyer hurried to every bar
By troops of Suitors, with more causes far
Then can be heard, grown weary, does pretend
That he could wish the Term were at an end;
They their own Lives precipitate, that both
Desire things future, and the present loath;
While he that suffers none his time to borrow,
But makes each present day his life, the morrow,
Nor fears, nor wishes; for what hour can bring
New joy to him, that knowing every thing
Has Mastered all his thoughts? let Fortune use
Her pleasure, he his constant life persues:
Something may added be perchance, although
Nothing diminished, but yet added so
As Meat to a full stomach, neither sought,
Nor yet digested. Let none then be thought
Old for their wrinckles, or gray-hairs, 'twere wrong
To say he lived, he only has been long:
We cannot truly say that Ship has saild,
On which fierce storms have from the port prevaild,
And driving too and fro, the voyage crossed,
That has not sailed much, but been much tossed:
I often have wondered with my self to hear,
Some demand time, and others not forbear
To grant it straight, both look upon the cause
Why it is asked, the thing from neither draws
Regard, but as nothing were sought, or given;
That which should be in most esteem, is even
A trifle made; the error hence does spring,
Because it is an incorporeall thing,
Not subject to the sense, it is therefore brought
Into contempt, or rather nothing thought.
Our Great men yearly New-yeares Gifts receive,
For which they give by way of contract leave
To use their labor, diligence, and pains,
That which costs only time, is counted gains:
But if such once be sick, and think, Death near
How are Physicians hugged? or if they fear
To loose their lives for some notorious crime,
What bounteous offers are then made for time?
So various are their thoughts; could men but tell
The number of their years to come, as well
As what are past, how would they then both make
Spare of the one, and at the other quake?
What certain is (though small) we may devide;
We must more wary be of what may slide
So suddenly from us; nor can we suppose
They know not what a precious thing they loose,
Because when they their loves would most express,
Part of their years to give, they will profess,
They give, it is true, but so, that what they leave
Others, to whom they give, do not receive,
Nor they themselves take notice of the loss;
A hidden damage seems an easy cross.
But none thy years will render, none restore
Thee to thy self; what ordered was before
Must be continued in the course begun;
Time gives no warning, but does flyly run:
Nor peoples favor, nor the Princes power
Can alter, lengthen, or retard one hour;
Thou busied art, life hastneth away,
Death comes at length, and thou must needs obey.
CAn any that to Wisdom would pretend,
Be better busied, then to learn to mend
His present life? it is a vain pretense
To think to order time, with times expense;
And to defer our purpose, when we know,
Life's greatest damage from delay does grow.
Th'expectance of an other days event,
Is nothing but a present detriment;
For to omit a day, is to dispose
Of what is fortunes, and our own to lose:
Why stay'st thou then? whereon do thou rely?
No future thing is sure; live presently.
Hear how the Poet in a Rapture cries,
Each best day first from wretched Mortals flies.
Let Us not defer (said he) for if we stay
It Is gone, though we lay hold it runs away;
We therefore of swift time swift use should make,
And as it were from a quick Torrent, take;
And to reprove our thoughts, he does not say
The best Year soonest flies, but the best day;
Why are we then so slow in such a Flight
Of time, as if we could pretend a Right
To Months, or Years, or to the longest date
That our vast minds could ere desire of fate?
He speaks but of a day now fleeting; then
Why marvel we, if wretched mortal men
(That is, such as be buside) ever find
Their best days soonest gone, whose childish mind
Age undiscerned invades; for no man keeps
Any account, by what degrees that creepes:
As they, whom some tale told, or serious thought
Deceiving, to their Iournies end are brought,
Before they think them near; so we that make
This speedy Iourney' of Life, both while we wake
And sleep, by reason of our too much care,
Do find it done before we be aware.
SHould I in parts devide what I propose,
I easily then might prove the lives of those
That so much mind the World, to be most short:
Old Fabianus (none of that odd sort
Of Chaire-philosophers, but Morrall, grave;)
Was wont to say, that vices must not have
A slight encounter, the'are (quoth he) our Swords,
That must repel such Enemies, not words;
Yet that men may their errors more refrain,
'Ti better to instruct, then to complain,
These three degrees of time make up life's sum,
What is, what was, and what is yet to come,
The present transient is, and cannot last,
The future doubtful; only what is past
Is certain: fortune here all right does lose,
Not any other can thereof dispose;
This Worldly men have lost, nor can they find
Leisure enough, their former deeds to mind;
Or if they could, 'twere an unpleasant thing,
To think of that which must repentance bring:
Men care not to look back on time ill spent,
For that remembrance needs must represent
The shame, when they shall truly ponder it,
Of what they took such pleasure to commit,
Such only as by reasons rule direct
Their actions, can upon time-past reflect;
He that has often ambitiously desired,
Proudly contemned, with insolence required
His captives thraldom; he that has deceived
Perfidiously, extortingly bereaved,
Or has profusely spent, can hardly be
Content to have recourse to memory;
Whereas that only is the Sacred time,
That does above all power of fortune clime:
No sickness can disturb, nor fear, nor want,
The firm fruition of the same supplant:
The present is but every single day,
Which passes in a moment, but we may
At our own pleasure all time past revive,
Whereof the busied do themselves deprive:
It is the quiet mind, that can revoke
All parts of life, whereas a heavy yoke
Imposed is upon the laboring thought,
That to look back it hardly can be brought:
Such lives are swallowed up; and as it is vain
To seek to fill what nothing can retain,
So is it bootlesse store of time to give
To them, whose minds are like a leaking sive:
Time present is so short, that it is by some
Thought nothing, gone ere it be fully come,
And stoppes no more then the Celestial spear,
Which never can its constant course forbear,
Yet that to busied men is only left,
Whereof they at the instant are bereft.
But would thou know how short a time they have?
Then do but see how long a time they crave;
How earnestly do old men beg t'obtaine,
Some years addition to their small remain;
Who feigning themselves younger do belie
Their age, and are deceived so willingly,
As if the fates they also could delude;
But by some deadly sickness being pursued,
How fearfully they draw their latest breath,
And go not, but are haled unto death;
Then they repent, and vow if they recover
Their health's, their wonted courses to give over;
Finding their labor to small use employed,
When what is gotten cannot be enjoyed:
Whereas a life from worldly troubles free
Is long enough, and cannot subject be
To Fortune, Riot, or an others will,
It Is all our own, and turns to profit still;
Though it be short, it does cententment find,
A Wise man dies with an assured mind:
But thou, purhaps would be informed* whom
I mean by buside men; not such as come
Early into the Pleading place, and stay
So late, that barking Dogs drive them away;
Nor those, whom either their own Clients smother
Bravely, or else by following an other
Contemptuously are trod on; nor yet those
That for base Lucre, their Estates expose
To sordid outcries; or whom flattery
Draws from their own, at others gates to lie;
Some men's repose is business; in their Beds
And Houses of retirement, are their Heads
Still vainly troubled; such cannot be said
To be at rest, but Idely busied.
Think thou them quiet, that with so much care,
Corinthian rusty Medalls will compare,
That from the false they may discern the true,
Made precious by the Folly of some few?
Or those that go to see (for lo we groan
Not under Roman vices now alone)
Youths with Oil'd-bodies wrestle on the Stage,
Bred up on purpose of like shape and age?
Think thou Him quiet, that spends half the day
To have the tedious Harbor take away
What grew the night before, that time can spare
To call a Council upon every hair
How it must lie; what Choler will he vent
If once the Barber seems but negligent?
Who to displease him is as much afeard
As if he cut the man, and not his beard;
When by a Per'wigg th'haire's restored that is shed,
Or growing thin is over the Forehead spread;
Into what passion will he straight be put
If any part of his Dear maine be cut,
Or if the same be discomposed; he frets
If all be not reduced to Annulets;
May we not well believe he takes less care
To have the State disordred, then his hair;
Who rather to be spruce, then honest strives;
Such are more curious of their locks, then lives.
Are they at rest, who their whole time do pass
But only with a Comb, and Looking-glass?
That Songs do either make, or sing, or hear;
When as the voice, that to the natural ear
In the plain note sounds best, is taught to run
Wanton division with writhed Faces done;
Who on their Fingers measure verses feet,
And though with serious, or sad things they meet,
Yet are they ever warbling; such as these
In Lazy business live, and not in ease:
Nor have they vacant time, that feasts do make;
Because we se what curious pains, they take
T'adorne with Plate their Cupboards, and devise
To put their Pages in quaint Liveries;
How careful are they least the Cook neglect
To send the Bore in dressed as they expect?
With what a quickness do the servants fall
Unto their business, when they hear the call?
How neatly does the Carver play his part,
In cutting up the foul with so much art?
And after their full Cups spewing about,
How soon the unhappy boys will wipe it out?
In these respects, they covet to be thought
Magnificent, and bounteous, and are brought
In every course of life, to this condition
They cannot eat or drink, but with ambition:
Nor have they quiet lives, that up and down
Are born in Chairs, and Litters, through the town;
For which they have their certain hours, when they
That are their Bearers, dare not be away;
Who must by other men be put in mind
To Bath, to Swim, to Sup, and are inclined
To such a negligence, that they scarce know
Themselves, whither they hungry be, or no;
One of the nicer sort (if so it be,
Niceness to loose humane society,)
Lifted by men from forth a Bath all wet
Into a Chair, said to them, am I set?
So strange a question made, can it be guest
He knows he lives, or sees, or is at rest?
It Is doubtful, which most wretchedness does show
To know it not; or to feign not to know;
Some things we do forget, and some we feign,
Some errors we are willing to retain,
As Arguments of Greatness: it is for love
And Abject persons to know what they do.
Go then, and blame the Players bold abuse*
More Follies they omit, then they traduce:
So Copious is vice grown in this our age,
Witty in ill alone, that we the Stage
May rather tax of negligence; can one
To such a sensuality be grown
That he by others must be told he fits?
He is not quiet, that such things forgets;
WE rather must some other word devise,
That he is sick, yea dead will but suffice;
He is at rest, that does his rest discern,
This halfe-alive, that must from others learn
His bodies posture, never can be thought
Of time to make advantage as he ought;
Twere long to reckon them that spend the day
At Chesse, at Ball, or at some other play
Are roasted in the Sun; such men can spare
No time, whose pleasures tedious business are;
Nor can we doubt, but they laboriously
Perform just nothing, who themselves apply
To fruitless Studies, frequent now in Rome,
It Was a disease that first from Greece did come,
To make it a rare piece of skill, to know
How many in Ulysses Ship did Row;
The Iliads or the Odisea, whether
Were written first; or from the style to gather
If one composed them both; with such as these,
Which if concealed, cannot the mind displease,
And uttered, we thereby are not become
More learned, but perhaps, more troublesome;
Behold the Romans also have affected
These needless Studies, formerly neglected;
I knew a Wise man of these times would run
Through every Act, and by what Captain done,
Affirming that Duillius first assailed
Our foes at Sea, and prosperously prevailed;
That Curious Dentatus was the first
Led Elephants in Triumph; these at worst,
Examples are of civil Actions, though
True Glory nothing to such things does owe,
Such knowledge profits little, though there be
Therein a kind of specious vanity;
Let them that will have also leave t'enquire
Who first possessed the Romans with desire
To build a Ship; 'twas Claudius, therefore he
Was called Caudex, by which word we see
The Joining fast of many Boords is meant,
Whence public Tables are by one consent
Called Codices, and Boats of Tyber framed
For Public use, are Caudicariae named;
And let this knowledge not be needles thought,
That first Valerius Corvinus brought
Messana in Subjection, and thereby
Added that Surname to his Family;
Which from Messana, by corruption came
To be Messalla, but was still the same;
And it is not a knowledge of much use,
That Sylla in the Cirque let Lions loose?
Whereas before they tied were together,
And that King Boccus sent Dart-flingers thither
T'encounter them? yet these we may remit;
But how can this for any use be fit,
To know that Pompey in the peoples sight
First brought the Eighteen Elephants to fight
With men condemned? a Prince of High esteem,
And whom Fame for Humanity might seem
To rank with Ancient Worthies, to devise
New deaths for men, and ther'with feed his eyes?
They fight, they goared are, at length they dye,
And under those Huge Monsters buried lie;
Surely this ought to have been forgotten quite,
That so no great man after might delight
To Imitate such an inhumane thing,
And envy that should detestation bring.
O, How does Greatness blind men's Judgments! he
Thought himself raised above Mortality,
When he so many wretches did ordain
To be by beasts bred in far Countries slain,
Devising a strange Combat between Creatures
Of so unequal strength, and different natures,
And in the Romans sight shedding such store
Of Blood; (compelled soon after to shed more,)
He was at length perfidiously betrayed
When his own Slave rude hands upon him laid,
And Murdered him, letting him plainly see
That his proud Sur-name was but vanity.
But to return to my discourses and thence
To show another fruitless diligence,
The same man of Metellus said, when he
The Carthaginians in Cicily.
Had vanquished, that he only Triumphed
With Sixscore Elephants, as Captives lead;
That Sylla first had leave to amplify
The City bounds for foreign Victory,
A thing allowed Aunciently to none
But Conquerours in Italy alone;
This is more worth our knowledge, then to have found
The Aventine to be without that bound,
Because the people when they did dissent,
So mainely from the Senate, thither went;
Or that the Birds at Remus-Augury
Were not observed about that place to fly:
These and a thousand more they do devise,
Which either are, or else resemble lies;
But let us on their Credits now rely,
And think them true, whose errors are thereby,
Whose Lust suppressed? whom may we therefore call
More Just, more Valiant, or more Liberal?
Our Fabianus said, he doubted much
Whether no knowledge better were, or such:
They only quiet are that Wisdom mind,
They only live; nor do they thereby find
Their lives in firm security alone,
But every age they add unto their own:
What ever has been acted heretofore
Belongs to them; yea, that unvalued store
Of Sacred Writers, for our use were borne,
Who ready are our present lives t'adorne:
Thus we by others industry are taught,
Great and rare things from dark oblivion brought,
And are not limited, but uncontrould
The secrets of all ages may behold;
And if the greatness of our minds would climb
Above all humane frailty, we have time
Enough, t'enquire out truths with Socrates,
To propound questions with Carneades,
To rest with Epicurus, to suppress
With Stoickes our affections vast excess,
And with the Cynickes to subdue them so,
That we with Fate even hand in hand may go:
Why do we then in this short time neglect
These divine things, that all good men affect?
Such as have daily offered up and down
Their meritorious Service in this town,
As vast in sensual pleasures, as extent,
That both themselves and others do torment,
When they have showed folly enough, and bin
At every house that would receive them in;
How have they been put of by Luxury?
Or Sleep? or great men's Incivillity?
Who having tortured them with long delay,
Then pretend business, and make have away;
Or else to shun the place filled with store
Of Suitors, have slunke forth at the back Door,
As if it were not far less barbarous
To deny entrance, then to abuse them thus:
How have they courted him, whose sleepy head,
Shows he has yet scarce well recovered
His last nights surfit, making others keep
Ill hours, to wait on his disordered fleepe,
Who being often told the Suitors name,
With a proud yawning will repeat the same.
They are employed to purpose, that do pass
Their time with Zeno and Pythagoras;
That often to Democritus resort,
That Aristotl' and Theophrastus Court,
With other Authors of good Learning; they
Bid all men welcome, sending them away
Not empty, but more pleased, more happy far;
They, day and night at equal leisure are;
They Will not compel, but teach us, how to dye;
They Will not consume our years, but will supply
Ours with their own; their Friendship is to us
Not costly, their discourse not dangerous.
FRom these men we may carry what we will,
And having gotten much may get more still;
What happiness, what Reverend Age shall he
Obtain, that is of their society?
There has he those with whom he may advise
What he should do when any doubts arise;
There he the truth without Reproach shall hear,
And being praised, no flattery needs fear:
By their Example he his life may frame,
And strive like them to gain a virtuous name:
The choice of our own Parents did not lie
In our own Power, Chance gave them; but hereby
We may be borne, as we our selves shall please;
The Families of Noble wits are these;
Choose then in which thou will thy Race advance,
And be entitled to the inheritance,
Not the bare name; to wealth that must not be
Hoorded up, basely, or maliciously,
But bountifully spent; men grow not poor
By such expense, those goods increase the more:
These shall thy way t'Eternity prepare,
And fix thee there, from whence none can, or dare
Think to remove thee; they alone can teach
Mortality, Immortality to reach:
Great Honors, Monuments, or what beside
In strength of Law or structure is by pride
Devised, shall soon decay, time does invade
That soonest, which the World has Sacred made:
Only true Virtue can resist the rage
Of present, and of future time, by Age
That gains esteem; things near them men envy,
But on remote look with Impartial eye:
A Wisemans life is therefore large, not bound
To those strict terms that Nature does propound
To others, Laws, which mankind does deplore;
All Ages, like a God, do him adore;
He in the thought to time past takes content,
Makes use of what is now, and does prevent
That which shall be; thus joining all in one
His constant life can shortened be by none;
Whereas their time must short and sad appear,
Who all these three forget, neglect, or fear;
And when death comes, they too late begin
To know how idly they employed have bin.
NOr is this any Argument at all
That they live long, because for death they call;
Their Folly works on their affections so,
That they, on what they fear, themselves do throw;
Thus they seek death, because they fear the same;
Nor yet can we from hence a reason frame,
Because the day seems sometimes long, for they
Repine that hours so slowly pass away
Ere it be Supper time; if they remain
But a short while unbusy'd, they complain,
And not well knowing how the time to spend,
Their thoughts to some new Vanity they bend:
How tedious seems that time, when they expect
Some Sword-play, or some Masque that they affect?
And yet how short is that they like? and short
Because they like not long, but still resort
To new delights, so that their days become
Not long at all, but rather wearisome;
Those Nights seem ever quickly at an end,
That men in drinking, or with Harlots spend;
Hence Poets in their Raptutes, to disguise
And cherish humane errors, did devise
That Jupiter, to lengthen the delight
He with Alcmena took, doubled the night:
But what can this be else, but vice t'enflame,
To make the Gods the Authors of the same?
And to Divinity ascribe the excess
Of Mortal men's Licentious wickedness?
How can those nights seem short? that cost so dear?
They lose the day, that wish the night were near;
And lose the night with a desire of day;
So much their fears their pleasures do dismay;
The thought of these two slender words, (How long)
Can turn all mirth into a mournful song:
From this affection Kings their Power lament,
And in their Greatness find but small content;
As being Frighted often with this thought,
That it must one day to an end be brought.
When that proud Persian King over vast Fields spread
His spacious Army not then numbered,
But in the view admired, He there shed tears,
To think that but within on hundred Years,
Not any one thereof should be alive;
When he that wept, soon after did deprive
By Sea and Land, by Fight, and Flight all those
Of Life, which he with grief, did then suppose
Would dye within one hundred Years.
How then?
Comes it to pass, that fear possesses men
In midst of Joy? because their Joys rely
On nothing, but the self same vanity
That gave them being: what may we then guess,
Of that, which to be wretched they confess,
When the felicity through which they bear,
And lift their thoughts so high, is not sincere?
Great fortunes are accompanied with care,
And of all others, least assured are;
They stand in need of other Happiness
To keep their Happiness, and new success
To guard their old; all things that come from Chance
Unstable are; yea that which does advance
It self the Highest, soonest falls to Ground;
Then what true Pleasure can therein be found?
Needs must their Life both short and wretched be,
When what they get with so much Misery,
They keep with more, and doubtfully maintain
What formerly acquired was with Pain;
In the mean while, but small account is made
Of unrecouer'd time; new things invade
The old, hope stirs up hope, desire desire,
They change the matter, not the end require:
Do we our selves cease to be Candidate?
We give our suffrages to others straight;
If we give over our own suites, we then
Are hired to follow suites for other men;
No sooner do we leave of to accuse,
But to be Judges instantly we choose;
Has Marius left the VVarres? He shall receive
The Consulship; did Quintius strive to leave
The charge of the Dictatourship? he now
Shall be again called to it, from the Plough;
Scipio, too young for so great things, shall go
Against the Carthaginians, and o're-throw
Hanniball, and Antiochus subdue;
The glory of our Consuls, and the true
Pledge of his Brothers Honor, who unless
Himself gainsay it, shall with Jove po^esse
An equal place; and when all this is done
He the preserver with sedition
Shall be provoked, and having quight refused
Such Honor as unto the Gods is used,
He at the length grown old, shall take content
To go into a wilful Banishment:
Thus happy or unhappy causes will
Be never wanting to breed trouble still;
Variety of business hinders rest,
A thing desired by all, by few possessed.
EXempt thy self then from the multitude
My dear Paulinus, having been pursude
By storms, which might more years then thine require,
Into a quiet Harbor now retire;
Think but what private blasts thou have endured,
What Public tempests to thy self procured;
Thy Virtue has sufficiently bin tried
In Rough Affairs; now let it be applied
To Calmer Ways; the most (at least, the best)
Part of thy life, has solely been possessed
By the Republique; let then some be spent
To thine own use; nor is it my intent
To call thee to a dull and lazy Ease,
To drown that vigor in delights that please
The vulgar People; this gives no repose
To any; there are greater things, then those
Thou have already done, that may by thee
In thy retirement safely acted be;
Th'Accompts of all the World thou managest
With temperance, as an others interest,
With Foresight, thine own, and with a zeal,
As things that much concern the Publique-weale:
In doing this thy duty, thou gayn'st love,
Wherein an other hardly could remove
A general hatred; it is better though
To take account of thine own life, then know
What store of Grain there is; that strength of wit,
That vigor of thy mind, for great things fit,
From a charge (Honorable I must confess,
But not conducing unto happiness:)
Call home to thee; and think not thou were borne
And trayn'd in famous Arts, to lay up Corn;
Thy Noble Education promised then
Things of a Higher strain; there want not men
That molded are for labor, and can be
Exact in matters of frugality;
Dull Iades great Burdens fitter are to bear
Then generous Horses; what a pity 'twere
Their stately backs with heavy loades to press?
Think also with thy self, to what excess
Of envy thou art exposed; thou have to do
With hunger, and the common people too:
No reason works, no equity prevails,
No Prayers move, when hunger them assailes.
In Caius Caesar's time, (who now at least
If Sense of things abide in Souls deceast
Is grieved to find the Roman people left
In safety, and himself of life bereft,)
The Store-howses so empty were of grain
That scarce a weeks Provision did remain;
While he with joined Ships large Bridges made,
And with the forces of the Empire plaide,
The worst of evils (Famine) was at hand,
And that which follows, Ruin of the land;
And this the example of a Foreign King,
Unfortunately proud and mad, did bring;
What thoughts had they that then employed were?
Did they not Stones, Fire, Sword, and Caius fear?
They all their Art (as they had cause) applide,
The ill that in their Bowels lurked, to hide;
For some are cured, ere they their Sickness know;
While others Deaths from such a knowledge grow.
FOr these things then do thou thy self prepare,
Which more secure, more calm, more Noble are;
Is it all one (think thou) thus to take thought
That Corn be clean into the Garner brought,
And laid up dry, least it grow Musty straight,
And heat, and that it answer the just weight?
Or to search out the highest Mysteries,
To know the Nature of the Deities,
Their Will, their Form and their Condition?
To learn what manner of conclusion
Waits on our Souls, where Fate will them bestow
So soon as they forth of our Bodies go?
To understand what holds the heavier things
Firm in the midst, and what the lighter brings
To hang above, what highest bears the fire,
And does the motions of the Stars inspire,
With all things else, that are by Nature sent
To strike the wilest with astonishment.
Would thou from Earth to these things raise thy mind?
Do It while thy blood is warm; the Sprightful find
Easi'st Aecesse, this course of life imparts
These things unto thee, Love of all good Arts,
True Use of uerrue, Courage to defy
The Power of Lusts, Skill how to live and dye;
Together with a firm and constant rest
Whereof thou never can be dispossessed;
All busied men are wretched; but yet none
Like them that toil, not only in their own
Frequent affairs, but sleep while others sleep,
And when they walk the Pace of others keep,
That eat with others appetites, and wait
To be commanded; both to Love and hate
Of all things the most free; their lives seem short
That thus unto another Will resort;
They do not envy him that gets Renown
By Pleading, or that wears the Purple Gown,
He ventures his life for it, ^'have men call
But one year by his Name, he wastes all;
Some, having stretched their ambitions wide,
Dye young, and in the midst of all their pride;
Others, that have great Dignities obtained
By many Indignity, find they have gained
But Titles to their Tombs; some, their last Age
Fed with new hopes, like their first youth engage
In great and wicked Proiects, when they see
Nothing but Death in their Infirmity,

Grown old, dies wrangling in a worthles cause,
Like him, that weary less of toil, then life,
Faints in the midst of his officious strife;
Or him, whom dying midst his heaps of Gold,
His long-fed Heir with laughter does behold:
I cannot an Example here let pass
That comes into my mind; Turanius was
An aged man, exactly diligent,
Who after Ninety years, a good part spent
As Procuratour, willing to desist,
By Caius Caesar was at length dismissed;
But coming Home, he laid him on his Bed,
Bidding his Servants Mourn as he were dead,
Who standing round about him, did express
Sorrow for their old Master's Quietness,
Nor would his Family their grief refrain,
Till to his labor he were called again:
Is it such pleasure then to dye in cares?
So are the thoughts of most bent to affairs,
Their Bodies sooner then their minds do fail,
Thus they their own infirmities assail,
And Age in no respect more Irksome proves
Then that from business it them removes;
Law does not force a Soldier to Fight
At Fifty Years, nor after Threescore cite
A Senator, men do more hardly draw
Leave from themselves to rest, then from the Law;
In the mean time, while one another peace
They daily interrupt, and never cease
To hurry, and be hurried; while they lie
Together in a mutual misery,
Their life is without Fruit, without delight,
Or any thing that should the Soul invite:
No man makes Death his Object; to their hope
All men desire to give the largest scope;
Yea many contrive business beyond Death,
Resolve of stately Monuments, bequeath
Great Gifts for Funeral Triumphs, and devise
Works to be talked of, with proud Obsequies;
But these, like such as dye to soon, should have
Torches, and Lamps, to light them to their Grave.
FINIS.
