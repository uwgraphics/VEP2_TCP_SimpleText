If thou purpose to worship for to stye
Long sleep and slouthe to vice done men excite

Virtutem prima^ puta esse compescere linguam
Proximus ille deo qui seit racione tacere
Trusts well also the first of virtues all
Is to be stille and keep thy tongue in mewe
Of tongue vnted much harm may fall
Leave me well this is as the gospel true

To god above that man is alder next
Sperne repugnando tibi tu contrarius esse
Conueniet nulli qui secum dissidet ipse
Advise the well that thou never trauerse

Sey not oon and efte the contrary reherce
Such repugna^ce wol make thy worship lame
Where steadfastness wol cause thy good fame

That with him self will ay repugne and strive
St vitam inspicias hot^m si denique mores
Cum culpas altos nemo sine crimine viuit
If thou aduertyse and behold about

If thou suppose thing that shall noye and grieve
Thaugh they be dear and right great of price
Such as suffers not thy prouffit achieue
If thou lust to be reuled as the wise
Absteyne the from such thing in all wise
For it is more wisdam in soth faltnesse
To prefer prouffit than such richesse
Constans et lenis vt res expostulat esto
Temporibus mores sapiens fine crimine mutat
It is a good lesson for the nones
A wight to be tempred with constaunce
And to be glad and merry eftesones
Not alwey sad ne light of contenance

And in his langage manace the and thre^e
Yet forbere thou not for all such displesance

As thou began correct that is a mysse
And that is a friendly teache I wysse
Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis
Sermo datur cunctis animi sapiencia paucis
Against woordy folk ay full of wind
Strive not at al It may not the proufyte
Such rasshe folks ben in conceytes blind
The witles word avails not a myte

And yet the wise full often ben for to seche
Dilige sic alios vt fit tibi (...)
Sic bonus esto bonis ne te mala da^pna sequa^tur
Love other men and have them so in chere

Rumores fuge ne incipias nouus author haberi
Mam nulli tacuisse nocet nocet esse locutum
Tydinges new that flen as the wind
Esche we my child with all thy diligence
Be never besy new tidinges to find
Such nouelte causes often offense
It is no wit It is no saprence
It hurts not a man to be in pees
But it does harm to put his tongue in prees
Rem tibi promissam certam promittere noli
Rara fides ideoque multi multa loquntur
Make no promise of other men is hest
Remember well that promise is unsure
But if thou keep thyn thy name sleest
To serve thy behest do thy besy cure
Trust not the word of every creature
Su^me man is feith is esy to break
For many folks thenke not as they speak
Cu^ te aliquis laudat iudex tuus esse memento
Plus alijs de te qua^ tu tibi credere noli
With words fair when fauel fedith the

Late thyn own ne reason alwey thy Judge be

Atque alijs cum tu benefeceris ipse s^leto
When thou see a another man is desert
As for his good deeds com^en dable
In every place preuy or a part
Such a wight with tl y good word enable
And though he have been by the auaylable

And than shall other men thin name enluu^ce
Multorum cum facta seney et dicta resenfus
Fac tibi fuccurrant iuuenis que feceris ipse
And if thou live long an oldma^ shall you be
Age wol approuche maugre who seith nay
Than perceive behold about and see
How aged folk ben treted with all day
And so pouruey for thy self a say
Into stoupyng age when thou art crept
Thing may ye help ye in thin youth was kept
Ne cures si quis tacito sermon loquatur
Conscius ipse sibi de se putat omnia dici
Charge not al thaugh you see men speak soft
Ne change no chere for often it is full bet
In secret wise to speak than cry on lofte
A man should see alwey where he were set
And after that so should he speak or let
But to the suspect of harm it seems
Men speak of him he noon other demeth
Cum fueris fel^x que sunt aduersa caueto
Non eodem cursu respondent vltima primis
When fortune has yeuen the felicite
And set the on high than be war of a fall
Than sueth often such sharp aduersite
Falls fortune tourneth as does a bal
In hyre trust have thou no sikernesse at al
Hire perelous play turns whilom to grame
For the end is woo that began that game
Cum dubia et fragilis sit nobis vita tributa
In mortem alterius spem tu tibi ponere no^i
Our brotel life is here so full of doubt
That in verrey surete no wight may stand
So suddenly crepen the fowls out
Al about this world in every land
Of young and old for every wight is bend
To death therefore set not thyn affiance
In death of him y^ may the furuyue parchance
Exigunn^ munus cum det tibi pauper anncus
Accipito placide plene laudare memento
A litel yefte given with good enter
Of thy friend that lyuith in pouerte
With right good chere such yefte take: bent
Supposing ay that as good will has be
And more than many men that richer be
Peyse not the yefte ne pondre not the pryse
Thentent is good and that shall the suffice
Infantem nudum cum te natura creauit
Paupertatis onus pacienter far memento
Since nature that is thy first norice
Has brought the hider al naked and bare
Thaugh thou never can richesse accomplice
But thou art hold alwey in pouertis snare
Yet no force make never to much care
Take patiently pouerte for the best
Riches is not of nature but of earth encrest
Ne timeas illam que vite est vltima finis
Oui mortem metuit quoth viuit perdit idip^m
Thaugh death be the fyn of every creature
And no wight on live shall from him escape
Yet deed not death with over besy cure
To live on earth It is but a Iape
If thou shall alwey after death so gape
Think well to dye but modefye thy thought
Or ellis to live avails the right noght
Si tibi pro meritis nemo respondet amicus
Accusare deu^ noli sed teipse coherce
For thy desert if no friend thank the
I mean when thou have don thy force and pain
To other folks friendly for to be
If they can not gramercy to the said
Withdraw thin hand and so thy self refrain
Blame not thy god / for thaire vnfre^dlinesse
But for such men do afterward the less
Ne tibi quid desit quesitis vtere parce
Vt que quod est serves semper tibi de^sse puta^
Since no richeman that leuith any where
If he consume his goods al and waste
But that pouerte shall grieve sore and dear
Therefore my child such goods as thou haste
Let not to sone out of thy hand beraste
Leest than thy good hereafter wol the f^yle
Hold that thou have It may the efte avail
Quod prestare potes ne bis promiseris vlli
Ne sis ventosus dum vis bonus esse videri
Behote no man a thing to lene him twyse
And fail him oones that is but vilanye
If thou may lene do it in friendly wise
Such cheuissance a friend both to be wrye
Of thy good deeds clamoure the^ net ne cry
Be not wyndy ner of words breme
If a good man thou list appear and seem
Qui similat verbis nec cord est fidus amicus
Tu quoque fac simile sic ars deluditur art
And if thou find the sone of doubleness
The false dissimilour if thou espy
With printed words and heart full of falsnesse
Thou may in no wise better blere his ye
Than to serve him with his own trecherye
With words fair and friendly to depart
Mean thou the same and art begyle by art
Noli homines blando nimium sermon probare
Fistula dulce canit uovcrem du^ decipit auceps
Preue you never a man by over printed speech
For under fair words is often annexed gile
The word is gay but friendship is to seche
As it is said such craft is in this I Will
Yet fum^e think if when they their to^ges file
The whisteling fouler makes merry song
And so the briddes begileth he among
Cum tibi fint nati nec opes tunc artibus illos
Instrue quo possint inopem deffendere vitam
When so is that thou have gotten children
Look in her yongth than inform hem so
In some craft and mister that they may therein
Learn to get her living and to deffende also
Her life which ever needs and that they unto
Virtue may atteyne for he that no craft can
Often tym^ needs and is in danger of every man
Quod vile est carum quod carum vile putato
Sic tibi nec cupidus nec auarus nosceris vlli
Have this conceit for it is often seen
Thing dear bought full often hate of price
And things that litel of valeu been
In time coming may to great derth arise
Remember well this and it ay aduertyse
Thus shall you best y^ name of chincherie fleme
And other men shall the no nygard deem
Que culpare soles ea tu ne feceris ipse
Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum
Advise the well let reason be thy guide
When other folks thou art about to blame
That such default in the be not espied
For if it be than shall thou have the shame
A man's honnour such thing wol reclame
It is full foul when a man wol teache
If that his deeds against his words preche
Quod iustu^ est petito vel quod videatur honestu
Nam stultu^ est petere quod possit iure negari
Look thy desir be grounded of right
And than that it never trauerse honest
These luratours that been misreuled so
Interrupte hem self and wrappen in much woe
For wikked wrath engenders but hate
Where as good accord norisshe leave algate
Seruoy ob culpam cum be doler vrget in fram
Ipse tibi moderare tuis vt parcere possis
When thy servant thou take in defaute
Thaugh he can not his negligence excuse
Yet in thyn Ire make not to fers a saute
But with thy male talent take treuse
So shall thou find ease this fet if thou use

Maxima etem^ morum semper pacientia virtus
Sufferance does ease was said long a goo
Suffer thou and have al thyn intent
Thaugh al thou may over yet do you not so
Conquer by sufferance and be pacient
But for to follow cruelte never consent
For it is cleped a virtue with excellence
A wight to live in humble patience
Conserua pocius que sunt iam parta labor
Cum labor in dampno crescit mortal^s egestas
Be not to skant ner be not to prodigal
Co^serue thy things gotten with true labor
It is full fair to be called liberal
But ay eschew wast and be no furfetour
Consume not al thy tresour in oon hour
When of thy labor rises noon avail
Needs pouerte must the in have assail
Dapsilis interdum notis caris et amicis
Cum fueris felix semper tibi proximus esto
Be thou not like senola for he would ete
With every man and at his fest him feed
But never no man might taste of his mete
Ner no wight to him come but he to al me^ yede
Be fre of thy mete but look that larges led
The no ferther than thou may easly ateyne
be ever thin own fre^d thus caton seith certein^
Take heed sire and see how holsumly this clerk
Entretith men with virtuous doctrine
The first part of this compendious werk
In worship how they shul full clearly shynt
Guydyng to renew straight as a line
Whois preceptis to observe if that ye ^iste
And to his conseil your hertis to enclyne
Right in your age full well It shall be wiste
The virtuous form y^ men shul forth convey
Lo in this life as bridel does a best
That man do not err here in this perilous wey
Stablisshing him as does a steadfast arest
And as saker guydes that men worthiest
Man's living here to set in governance
This sage Cathon puts in remembrance

If thou lust my child set thy hertly delyt
Of earth to know the tilthe and the culture
And if thou will be of knowleche parfit
Why sum^e is erable and sum^e eke pasture
Why sum^e is fresh like flowers of picture

In the laureat poet great virgile
Si Yomana cupis et punica noscere bella

And thou have desirous fresshe courage

Who bare him best m town and also in feld
And who did meruailes under martes sheld
Si quis amare libet vel discere amare legendo
Nase nem petito s^n autem cura tibi hec est

But yet my lef child if that in adventure
Thin heart be yeuen to no such manner thing
Or that it be not unto thy playsure

Yet that you may be wise after in thy leuynge
If thou lust to me to give audience
I shall show the doctrine of sapience
Ergo ades que s^t sapiencia disce legendo
Therefore my child come nere to me and lere
And I shall the show the verray tresure
Of sapience if the lust to harken and here
And eh how thou shall in good estat endure
And led thy life holy after goddis pleasure
Therefore approach and lere this reding
To ben a man ay virtuous of leuyng
Si potes ignotis eciam prodesse memento
Vtilius est regno meritis adjuirere ami^^s
There is no wight that ferther may report
Of thy good deeds than the stranger may
Make him ay good chere and show him disporte
And he shall with honor veter y^ this no nay

Friends y now to have It is a better thing
Than is frendles any man to be a king
Mitte arcana dei celum niquirere quid sit
Cum sis mortalis que sunt mortalia cura
Of goddis mystery and ek of his worching
Make never my child to fer inquirance
It is folly any man to muse on such thing
Dispute thou never upon thy gods purue^^ce

And since thou art man clad in mortalite
Dispute thou of thing such as (...) be

When dread of death any man so agruggeth

If you know aught y^ may turn in to shame

Ner dispreyse but let thou other men alone
Alwey after prudence thy words peyse
For thyn auant honor shall thou get none
But have a mok as soon as thou art gone
A man to preyse him self as seith the scole
Or dispreyse much is token of a fool
Litis preterite noli maledicta refer

Wrath of old y^ should be kept out of mind
Be thou not about to make it on live
But the enuyous has ay a tacche of kind

When men profre than is time to reteyne

Dread thou no dremes so seith deuteronomy ronomye
For often they be caused of duiers complexion
Some of ymaginaco^ns and many a nice fa^tesie

With the oil of playsance in full great foison
But yet under y^ keep y^ well from this poison
Segniciem fugito que vite ignauia fertur
Na^ cum a^mus languet confumit inercia corpus
Slouthe slogardy and dull Idelnesse
And lachesse that causes to be negligent
Enforce y^ ay to eschew with all thy besinesse
For Idel soul makes thy body shent
Treuly there is in earth no gretter argument

Non me scriptorem sed be neglexeris ipse
Enprinte my teching in thy soul steadfast

Vtile consilium dominus ne despice serui
Nullius sensum si prodest contempseris vnquam
Grace is youen to man in many sundry wise
Som^e have wisedam and som^e have eloquence

Nec retinere velis si cepit esse molesta
Wedde not a wife for hire enheritance
For she wol cast it often in thy berd

To wirke thing that been proffytable
But look thou never thy wi^tes apply
To things that may not be auaylable

Dispayred hope is the end of such labor
Quod donare potes gratis concede roganti
Nam recte fecisse bonis in part lucrosum est
When you shall give than give in friendly wise
Friendly content thou a prayer or a request
For thing yeuen by time is yeuen twyse
Such gladsome chere makith yeftes richest

Stulticia est in mortem alterius sperare salute^
The death of bestes that been unreasonable
As by custume and right of sacrifise
To pourge the is no seth greable
Trust not also to get thy repryse
For they that trusten so ben full unwise
By death of bestes god wol not quemed be
And a man a bide stille in his iniquyte
Cum tibi vel sociu^ vel fidum queris amicum
Non tibi fortuna est ho^s sed vita petenda
When thou would chese a fr^^d for trustiness
Of his fortune make noon inquirance
For fortune is mother of changeableness

Enfor^e thy wictes sumwhat for to lere
Aquenite the with cunnyng for it is sure
If fortune change and pouerte appear

Doctrine helpith virtue evermore on live

Hoc bibe quoth possis si tu vis viuere sanus
Morbi causa mali namque est quecumque voluptas
Drink not to much more than you may bear
Reule well ay thy self with ye bridel of mesure
To much drink wol thy body noy and dear

Come not therein fortune is unstable
After pouerte richesse is preygnable

He is a friend and she no thing to blame
Cum tibi contingerit studio cognoscere multa
Hac discas multa vita nescire doceri
When through study and great excersice

Yet ay do thy dil^gence in the most byse wise
To purchase more for it is a wholesome thing
For to great honor cunnyng may the bring

for without teching cu^nyng may not be caught
Miraris verbis nudis me scribere versus
Hec breuitas sensus fecit coniungere binds
If thou aught marvel or lust to muse
In naked words why my versis thus I write
In no wise trewly I may me better excuse
Than sey my wit so dull is and vnpersyte

No thing causes me but simpleness of wit
Now I have gadered flowers to your list
Tastes them for they be preseruatyf
Holds them fast and vere hem m your fyst

Here have I fond that shall you guide and led
Straight to good fame and leave you in her house
