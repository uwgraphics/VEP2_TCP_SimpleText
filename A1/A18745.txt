A Myrrour for man where in he shall see the miserable state of this world.
O Man remember, from hence thou shalt pass
Like as thy figure, ones seen in a glass
Does vanysshe away, yea, so shall thy breath
Bring earth unto earth, when strike the does death
This world, wise men call, a through fair to the
Follow thou it not, from vice do thou flee
Seek after knowledge, the truth to auaunce
Desire not to see, thy neighbors myschaunce
Beware of three things, print them well in mind
The devil, the flesh, the world that is blind
Fear God and thy Prince, be looth to offend
Take nothing in hand, but think on the end
Let wysdom the rule, and knowledge with al
Than thou shall stand fast, where other men fall
If thou will avoid, great aduersytie
Let other men's fautes, be myrrour to the
Or if thou wylt lead, a life with great ease
Do as most men do, thou shall feawe displease
Desire not to have, no more than thy own
For corn is not had, but where sede is sown
Through coueteousnes, is all out of turn
And many rich realms, it has brought to ruin
Some men have treasure, and hearts ease at will
Yet ever wyshinge, and near has their fill
Soch fylthy lucre, enbraceth their har^es
So that they may have, they force not who smartes
And though they have all, yet for more they gape
They drink both the wine, and lokes for the grape
Which makes the poor, right sore to lament
For they have nothing, but for dobble rent
They would wyn their fode, with labor and sweat
Yet all will not help, their rent is so great
And where they were wont, to uphold a plowe
Now skarce can they find, the grass for a cow
Their children do watch, as hawks for their pray
Yet can they not get, one good meal a day
Soch woeful morninge, as is in England
Was never before, I dare take in hand
In every place, where as I do walcke
I hear men complain, and this is thayr talcke
O Lord God they say, now hear our request
And comfort the poor, that are sore oppreste
The rich that fares well, and has nothing skant
Does never conceive, what the poor does want
But if that some men, on them take no rueth
They are all undone, this is the plain truth
I would this were known, among the best forte
Tha^ should the poor men, soon have some comfort
The rich are fair flowers, the poor ar but weeds
Yet God shall take count of every man's deeds
And when that the Lord, shall sit in Judgment
Than they that did wrong, right sore shall repent
Therefore o thou man, that feign would do well
Live thou according, to Christ's gospel
Follow not their steps, whose deeds are unjust
Remember this world, shall turn unto dust
If conscience be slain, with pomp and riches
Wisdom is turned, to great folyshnes
Of no kind of thing, desire not to myche
If thou be content, than sure thou art rich
Better is lyttel, with ease to posses
Than with much trouble, to have great riches
As sycknes and health, can never agree
So gold without rest, is but mysere
Behold well this world, take warning in time
And mark how they fall, that uses to clyme
Even now a days, soche wonders are seen
As many men thought, could never have been
Some men from honor, are brought to great care
And ends their lives right naked and bare
Some men from nothing, do come to estate
And yet at the length, are unfortunate
Some men lives in wealth, and pleasure long whyll
Yet sodaynely gone, and put in exyll
Syns wealth nor honor, on earth has no rest
A poor godly life, I think it is best
Among all degrees, a fault may be spyed
Which makes this world, to lie a tonesyed
Lords were ones liberal, but now wax they hard
The poor and nedye, they little regard
Judges give Judgment, sometimes not with right
Lawyers for money, hyedes tru^th out of sight
Bishops and preachers, seek lyuynges again
And when they wax rich, they take little pain
Marchantes and craf^es me^, selles al things to dear
And tell them who ^^yst, that will they not hear
Great bankets are kept, where good is plente
To noryshe their lusts, nothing is deynte
Baylyfs and sheryfs, one fault they punyshe
And sees a hundredth, increase and floryshe
Gentyl men were wont, examples to give
Which caused poor men, right well for to live
But now who lives worse, than men of renown
O how is virtue, so sone laid down
Women do wander, with every doctrine
And some do dyspute, much like a deuyne
Young men are blinded, so with vain glory
That wise men do laghe, at their great folly
Men should learn wisdom, at men grave and saege
Who doteth so much, as men does in aege
Thus upon hye things, I will give no saute
It may be well seen, that few is without fault
But sens that the lord, this world did begin
Was never yet seen, so much vice and sin
As is now upon earth, among more and les
Whose deeds if you mark, may bear good witness
The father does now, dysceaue his own child
Who trusts his brother, is often times be gylde
Dysceyt and falshed, puts right out of place
Truth keeps silence, this is a sore case
Sweryng and whoredom, dysemblaunce and craft
For all their preaching, yet will not be lafte
Usery is held, with them that seem wise
Now for a right trade, of good marchaundyse
All things are turned, so far out of frame
That men live now, like beasts without shame
Now those that do well, is worn out of thought
But pryuye pyckthankes, are made up of naught
Flatterers with tales, does work men much woo
Whose words are as swyft, as shaft out of boo
Defame and sklander, are busy right often
About all estates, with words fair an soft
If virtue come not, and vanyshe all this
This word can not last, not long as it is
I trust ones to se, that men shall abore
Their vycyous lives, and repent it sore
Than god shall send grace, from heaven above
To set us in rest, and brotherlye love
Than we shall se peace, where now is dyscorde
And sing psalms with heart, in praise of the lord
The poor shall live well, the rich shall rejoice
Than god shall have laud, of every man's voice
The earth shall increase, and bring forth much sede
Than shall we not want, no good thing we need
In every kingdom, shall be rest and peace
All manner of plagues, at that time shall seace
So that al vices, both branches and rote
Shall wyther away, and lie under foot
Than we shall prospere, and live in good health
And all things shall turn, unto our own wealth
God shall so love us, if we do bewail
There shall no danger, against us prevail
Nor no mysfortune, shall make us afraid
For God shall so be, our succor and aid
Right happy is he, that lives till than
To see soch great love, between God and man
Here have I set forth, after a plain sort
The state of this world, in sentens right short
For the thou blind man, that goes astraye
I lyghten this lamp, to learn thee the way
Now here is two ways, do those which thou will
Either to be safe, or else to be spylte
I can do no more, but show thee the right
To change the ill life, lies not in my might
I would that my words, were graven in stone
That all the whole world, might look them upon
Although they have heard, as much as I know
Yet think they on wartes, when tro^pets does blow
The oftener they se, a thing that is ill
The less cause they have, to bear it good will
If I could thonder, in every man's ears
I would them exhort, with weeping and tears
Yet many do teach, and few do amend
They take little head, what time they do spend
Though plage upon plage, does show them gods ire
Yet for to live well, they have no desire
Now what should I more, on soche things deffyne
Man has no more grace, than god does assyne
Therefore unto god, I would have them crepe
And for their great sins, to morn wayle and weep
He will them receive, and give them a place
Where angels do live, by sight of his face.
