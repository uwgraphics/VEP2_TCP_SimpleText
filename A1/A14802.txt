A TRVE CHRISTIANS DAILY DELIGHT: BEING The Sum of every Chapter of the Old
and New Testaments, set down Alphabetically, in English Verse, that the
Scriptures we read may more happily be remembered, and the things forgotten
more easily recalled.

By Simon Wastel, sometimes of Queens College in Oxford, now Schoolmasters
of the Free-Schoole in Northampton.

Bonus Textualis, bonus Theologus.
A good Divine he is counted still,
In Scripture text that has good skill.
Si Christum nescis, nihil est si caetera discis:
Si Christum been scis, satis est si caetera nescis.
If that thou know not Christ thy King,
No good will humane knowledge bring
If him thou rightly do adore,
It is enough, thou needst no more.
Blessed is he that delights, and meditateth in the Law of God day and night.
PSALM. 1.2. LONDON, Printed by G. Eld and M. Flesher, for Robert Mylbourne, and
are to be sold at his shop at the great South door of Paul's. 1623.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable, his singular good Lord, Sir Robert Spencer Knight,
Baron Spencer of Wormeleighton: S. W. Wishes all happiness temporal and
eternal.
Right Honorable,
THE manifold favors received from your Lordship, ever since my first placing
in the Free-Schoole of Northampton, as also your Honors late promised
assistance to help the said School to that right whereof it has been these
many years unconscionably defrauded, has caused me many times to wish that
some good occasion might be offered unto me, whereby I might witness not only
unto your Honor, but also to posterity, how much I confess my self obliged
unto you for the same. And therefore having taken some pains to turn the
contents of the Bible briefly into English meeter, for the help of weak
memories (being encouraged thereunto by the persuasions of diverse of my godly
learned friends, when they saw some entrance made thereinto.) Your Honor being
in the very Frontispice of my dearest and worthily most honored friends, I
determined to dedicate the same, together with my humble and best service, unto
your Honor; beseeching you, that both my self and it, as also our poor
wro^ged School may still be patronized and shrouded under the shadow of your
Honorable protection: so will I not fear what my back friends can say to my
Book, nor what they can devise or do against my self; so also shall your
Honor (in respect of the School) have the praise of the Prophet, to be called,
A builder of that wast place, and a raiser up of the foundation thereof; a
repairer of that breach, and a restorer of those paths to dwell in: And so be
honored and esteemed of me, and all my Successors, as the second Founder
thereof, and be paralleld and equalized with Thomas Chipsey, who was the first:
For, Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.
It Is no less pious, things lost to regaine,
Then for first Founders to give to maintain.


Vouchsafe I beseech you (my most honored Lord) as cheerfully to accept of
this my poor present and widows mite (being a pawn and pledge of my ever
dutiful and thankful mind) as Artaxerxes is said to have received an
handful of water from the poor Countryman, whose ability would afford no
better a gift. So will I ever power forth my prayers unto the Almighty
Preserver of mankind, the giver of every good gift, that he would be pleased
to vouchsafe unto your Honor, and to all your Honorable Progeny, health of
body, length of days, with increase of grace and honor in this life, and the
fruition of eternal blessedness in the World to come.

Your Honors ever to command, SIMON WASTELL.

The Preface to the READER.
NOT long ago (Christian Reader) there was published a little Book in Latin
verse, called Bibliorum Summula, set forth by Master John Shaw (a man whom both
for his learning and gravity, as also for our old and ancient acquaintance
(being Schoole-fellowes in Westmerland 50 years ago, and both of Queens
College in Oxford) I did, and do much esteem and respect.) This Book I
perceived to be much applauded of the godly learned Ministers, and of many
other Scholars that had seen and read the same. And therefore after he had
sent me one, (as a token of his love) I began to study how I might teach it to
speak English, being as desirous to benefit the unlearned, as he was the
learned; and having translated the Books of Moses, and offered them to his and
to other learned and grave Ministers view and censures, they did by their
persuasions so prick and spur me forward, that I could not give over, until
(through Gods assistance) I had gone through both the old and new Testaments. I
confess I have not precisely tied my self to his method and manner, because
the English tongue is far more copious then the Latin; but have taken
liberty (according as the contents of each Chapter were longer or briefer) to
conclude them sometimes in two, sometimes in four, sometimes in more Disticks,
with as much breuity (observing perspicuity) as I could. I have purposely
labored to speak plainly, to the capacity and understanding of the simple and
ignorant, rather then by poetical strains to please the ear, and the eye of
the curious learned Readers. Thou have also not only the contents of every
Chapter set down in order Alphabetically, with figures to direct thee unto
them, but also figures in every line to direct thee to the verse where thou
shall find that presently which thou desire to know, without reading over the
whole Chapter. Thou have also a Chronologicall observation of times from Adam
to Christ, and from Christ to Antichrist. Thou have also the names of all the
Books of the Bible, as they follow in order.

Lastly, thou have comforts and encouragements against the fear of death,
called, the old man's A. B. C. If it shall please thee (gentle Reader) when thou
have read or heard a Chapter, to read over the Contents in meeter once, or
twice, thou may be able to rehearse and say the said Contents by heart, and
so in short time be acquainted with the History of the whole Bible. If any be
so zealously affected with the knowledge of the Scriptures, as the Lord
Cromwell was, who (as Master Fox records in the Book of Martyrs, of the fifth
Edition, page 1075.) got by heart all the new Testament of Erasmus his
translation in his journey to Rome, he might in shorter time get by heart
these brief contents of the whole Bible. If therefore the Law of God be thy
delight, (as it was David's) this little Book will be a comfortable companion,
whether thou walk abroad, or stayest at home. And finally, if thou reapest
any increase of saving knowledge, justifying faith, or holiness of life, by
these my poor labors, to the edification and salvation of thy soul, I have
all that I desire, saving that I would entreat thee to ascribe the praise and
glory of all to God, and to afford me thy charitable censure, well-wishings,
and prayers.

Thine in any Christian service that he can perform, S. W.

In commendation of this Work.
TO keep us blameless what excuse have we,
If ignorant in Gods Commands we be?
Since, to inform us, what his pleasure is,
So many helps we have that others miss:
And are not now compelled to go seek,
The hard phraz'd Hebrew, nor the copious Greek.
For, God speaks English to us; and assayes
To work true knowledge in us diverse ways.
Some men interpret, some again expound;
And this our Author here, a means has found
To help the Memory: And not in vain,
If others add endeavor to his pain.
Peruse it Reader. And so mindful be
Of that, whereof this book remembers thee;
That others in thy life, may copyed find,
What thou art hereby taught to bear in mind.
GEORGE WITHER.

To the as truly religious, as learned and worthily beloved Author, and
Translator, Mr. John Shawe, Anag. Oh Show any. and Simone Wastell. Anag. So
well is meant.

OH Show me many, any man almost,
In this so sinful, sin-foule Generation,
That stands for true Religions propagation:
Oh, too too few can hereof truly boast.
Oh, yet of many, any for to Show,
Heaven has not left us hopeless: Two are here
By whose religious labors may appear
A happy Hope in Faith and Grace to grow.
Wastell, So well is meant, so well is penned
This worthy Work of thine, this Light, Delight,
That none but Rabsheca with Romish spite
Can choose but Thee and thy sweet Pains commend.
So well is meant (I say) this holy labor,
And so well formed, performed for pious use,
As justly merits each good Christians favor,
As no small help to the Book of Books peruse,
With Scriptures sacred sent their Souls to savor.
And as it is So well meant, let good men take it,
With like good mind, and their Companion make it.
Your most loving (though unknown) Friend in Christ Jesus, JOHN VICARS.
