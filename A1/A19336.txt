Prologus
All Ingratitude utterly setting a part / we owe to call to our minds the
manyfolde gifts of grace with the benefayttys. that our lo^^^ of his most
plenteuous bonte has given us wretches in this present transytorye life /
which remembrance of right dyrectly should Induce us to give his godhede
therefore contynuall and Immortal louynges and thanks. and in no wise to
fall to thygnorau^ce or forgetfulness thereof. Among which benefaytes and
gifts is granted us f^e arbytremente. And thereby with our good deserts
supported and helped by his most dygne mercy and grace we be enabled to be the
children of ever lastyng salvation / and to possess the Joys of heaven /
which are Incomprehensyble and Inestymably blysfull and good. And by cause we
be so frail and inconstante. prone to fall feeble and insuffyryent of our
self to resyste the fraudelente malice and temptacyon of our ancient ennemy
the fend Therefore he has yeuen us his mercy to be our releef Reason to be our
lantern / and Remembrance to order our guydyng Then^e first of this precious
gift of mercy we may to our great comfort verily trust to have it at all times
in this world when^e we deuly sue and call therefore. But we must know for
certain. yt we can have no capacyte* nor power to receive hit after the season
of our bodily life here. Secondly by Reason we owe in the most extreme love
and dread to know and take him as our creator and redemptour. and all our
wylles to be subgette unto his pleasure. Thryddely we owe to remember how we
may guide us for to stand in his grace. Co^syderyng what we where / what we be
/ and what we shall be. And for asmoche / as very prudence admonesteth and
techeth us how ye conclusion of every thing should be most soueraynely taken
head unto. Therefore I advise that this treatys here after ensuynge / which to
of our four last things be well over red and seen And not oonly seen and red
/ but also well conceived / noted / and often remembered. And if perauenture we
find therein any cause of grouge / or else any mocyon to blotte or ruste the
clerenesse of our ghostely understanding styryng us to unmeasurable fere / or
any other presumptuous synystre / or vain concept. Yet late us take hit all
ways to the best intent having no dispeyr in our lords mercy / for it is
infynyte. And know for truth / that none such evil moeuyng comes / but of
thynstygacyon of our goostly aduersayre / whom we must vertuosly resyste /
and catholyquely allewayes rest upon the most ferme pyller of our faith.
which is the very assured shield and mean of our goostly health. And to have
ye grace in our necessyte calie we for help unto the holy ghost that
Illumyneth and techeth every soul for to keep the ways of salvation to the
enherytynge of the eternal Joy and glory Amen.

THis present treatise is divided in four pryncypall parts. Of the which
every part conteyneth three other synguler parts as in the manner following is
showed.

Pars prima.
The first pryncypall part is of the bodily death. And thereunto belongs three
other synguler parts. The first of the three is how remembrance of death
causes a man to meke and humble him self folio.ii. The soconde is how
Remembrance of death makes him to despise all vain worldly things folio.xii.
The third is how Remembrance of death causes a man vnco^strayned to take
upon him to do penance and to accept it with a glad heart folio.xv.
Pars secunda.
The second pryncypall part is of the last day of Judgment and conteyneth in
him self three other synguler parts. The first of these.iii. is how accusaco^n
yt shall be at the day of Judgment is thing to be dred folio.xxiii. The
second is how the last day of Judgment is terryble and not without cause. for
there must be gy uen a due rekenyng and acompt of every thing folio.xxvii. The
third is how ye terryble abydyng of the extreme sentence causes doubts to be
had of the Judgment folio xxxiiii
Pars tercia.
The.iii. pryncypall part is of hell or of the Infernal gehenne and
conteyneth in it self three other synguler parts. The first of those.iii. is
how hell after holy scripture is named dyuer se and many wyses fo..l. The
second is how they yt descend in to helleben punysshed with many great and
sundry pains folio.liiii. The third is how there be many diverse co^dico^ns
of greuances in ye pains of hell fo.lix.
Pars quarta.
The.iiii. pryncypall part is the blysful Joys of heaven / and thereunto
apperteyne.iii. other synguler parts. The first of thoos three is how the
Royalme of heaven is loved praised and reco^mended for his beauty clerenes and
light folio.lxx. The second is how the Royalme of heaven is praised for the
manyfolde goodnesses yt be habundau^t therein folio lxxii. The third is how
the celestyall Royalme is to be lauded for the perpetuell and Infynyte Joy and
gladness therein folio.lxxv.
Explicit tabula.
Here after follows the prologue of the four last things.
MEmorare nouissima et meternu^non peccabis Ecclesiastici septimo capitulo.
Ecclesiasticus says in his seventh Capitre these words following Bear well in
thy mind the last things / and thou shall never fall in sin. Also Saint
Austyn says in his book of me dytacyons. That man ought rather have in fere
and eschew the abhomynaco^n and fylthe of sin / than any other crueltees of
the Infernal torments. Loo then how ye knowledge of these four last things
and frequentyng the memory and remembrance of them called us from sin / and
draws us to virtue / and conformeth us to all good works. Wherefore by the
help of the dyuyne Inspyracyon I have purposed to rehearse and say a little of
these four tynges. As which they be / and what they be / and also to declare
somewhat of every of them syngulerly by them self / precyously and dygnely by
saynges and auctorytees of saints / and generally by examples and saynges of
auctorysed clerks. It is to be noted that after the saying of saynces men sayt
comynly. there be four the last things. And which they be it appears clearly
by the words of Saint Bernard in a sermon where he says in all thy works
have remembrance of thy last things / which be four. That is to wit
first. Bodily death. Second. The day of Judgment* Third. The pains of
hell. Fourth. The glory of heaven. O what thing is more horrible than death.
What thing is more dredefull and terryble than ye day of Judgment. what thing
is more Importable to be suffered than the gehe^ne and pains of hell And what
is a more Ioyefull bliss than celestyall glory. Saint Bernard said in the
same sermon These ben the four wheles of the chare / whereof the Remembrance
brings man's soul to the everlasting glory of paradyse. These ben also
iiii. moeuynges yt awake the spirit of man to ye end that he disprayse all
worldly things and return unto his creator and maker. Lo it is then both
co^uenyent and proufytable yt they be had contynuelly in remembrance. and
therefore says ye wise man in ye xxviii. chapitre of Ecclesiasticus. Bear in
thy mind ye last and fynall thing is and look always perfyghtly upon them to
thentent yt they may be surely fixed and printed in thy memory Now syn all
this process princypally and soueraynly enforseth himself tenduce every
crature to have an assured mind and an hole remembrance of these iiii. last
things / and yt they may cordyally be enprynted with in your hertes. Therefore
it is consonant and according if it so may please. yt this present treatise may
be entytled and bear the name of the Cordyall.

Thus ends the prologue of this book named Cordyall. Which treats of the
four last and fynall things that been to come. And here begins the first
part of the said four last things.
THe first part of the four last things. whereof the remembrance withdraws
a man fro sin is death present or temporell And therefore seyth saint Bernard
in a bok called the Myrour of monks. The most souerayn phylosophye is to
think all way on death. And he that beryth it in his mind in what place so
ever he go shall never sin. Saint Austyn says in his book of exortacyons.
There is no thing that so well reuoketh and calls a man from sin as often
Remembrance of death. Certain it is yt thing which causes a man to be
humble to dysprayse himself and to do penance.

How Remembrance of death makes a man to be humble and meke.

The first chapitre of the first part pryncypal
I Say that recordyng the Remembrance of death makes a man to be meke and
humble him self. And therefore says Saint Austyn in the book that he made of
our lord. A man knowing himself to be mortal. it shall put from him all manner
of pride In very truth all our other things as well good as badde be
incerteyne. But of death oonly we may be well ensured And how be it that the
hour thereof to us is hid and incerteyn. Yet always she is approchyng and shall
surely come without long taryeng. And to this purpose says Ecclesiastics in
his.xiiii. chapitre. Bear well in remembrance that death shall not tarry. It is
also written in Thoby yt death hastes and yt there may no fleeng ^uayle. Also by
the comune law of nature every man must pay his mortal trybute. Saint
Bernarde says in a sermon O wretched man why do thou not dyspose thy self
to be ready at all hours / think that thou art now deed / lyns thou know
well that necessaryly it behooves the to dye. Remember well how thyn eyes shall
turn in thy head and the veins break in thy body. and thyn heart shall deuyde
in two parts by the right sharp anguysshe and pain of death. Who is he
then yt ought not to dread and make himself humble. when he knows
certaynely yt he must return and become earth. Now truly there shall be none
excepcyon of persons. But al shall pass that way For as it is written in the
second book of kings. When shall all dye / and the earth shall swolowe us as
it does water cast thereupon / which never retourneth. We read also that this
word (Mors) in latin may well so be called. For it is a bitter morsel unto
all men in so much yt no creature may escape it. And therefore it is said in
the book of dyspraysyng of the world. Death cutteth down and dystroyeth all
things create and made in flesh. She both beteth down the hye men and low /
for the has domynacion upon worldly living things She regneth Imperyally over
the nobles and dredeth no living creature / for her power is common over princes
and dukes. She takes as well the young as the old. And when she smyteth / she
has mercy of no creature. All things create in flesh peryssheth under her
hand Nor there be none so strong / but that the beteth them down without
rescuse. And there is no thing beryng life / but that she destroys and
wastes it without any escape. And the neither takes mede allyaunce ne
frendshyp. What shall I shore say / euydently death spares no body. For
neither poor ne rich shall mow escape out of her cheyne. Certainly I
understand now that death is the end of all worldely living things. And
therefore it is written in Ietha the Poet. That death takes away and does
anyntyse all quycke things. Lo it is not said that the wise Cathon and the
good Socrates ben deed. Which gives example that there is neither science ne
doctrine that may preserve one fro the ruynouse darte of death. It is written in
Ecclesiastes in the second chapitre. As Well dies the wise man as the fool. It
is written in Isaye in the.xxxiii. chapitre. Were are now become the lettred
men. where ben the prechers of the word of god. Where be they that were wont
to teache the childern. These questions employed as much as to say they live
not / and be goon and paste in the common course with other and deed of this
world. Now by cause Ietha named but only the two before specyfyed. I pray the
tell me / Where is now Hector of Troy / where is become Julius Caesar / where
is Alexander the great / where is Judas Machabeus / where is the mighty
Sampson. where is Crassus the rich / where to the fair Absolon / where is
Galyen the physycyen / and Auycenne his fellow / where is the wise Solomon /
where is Arystocle the philosopher / and where is Virgyle the right expert
poet / be not all these deed and passed out of this world as pylgryms and
gestes. and departed hens in a right short space. yes certainly there is not one
left a live of them. al their Joys were but vanytees and are failed / and
their days be consumed and passed. and as the Psalter seyth man passed his
days resemblyng a shadow and one time he is hole and strong of all his
members / and on the morrow seek and leyde in the earth. And as Cathon says.
Our life is given unto us to be full of doubt and of fragylyte. This appears
also clearly by a phylosophre named (Secundus) whom the emperor (Adryane)
questyoned with of yt being and thestate of man which answered as follows.
Man is subget unto death do of the place where he is a voyager passing /
semblably unto a piece of snow. Also like a reed bery and like a new apple by
which thing is euydencly showed / how frail / how sleder / and also how
little endury^ge is the life of a man. And not oonly the life of pour people.
But also the life of all humane creatures / be they never so rich or
puyssau^t. For death is a comyne thing and spared no body. And all be it she
is cruwell and perverse / yet she keeps egally one law in taking as well
kings and princes as pour folks. Thus gives she great cause to weep if it
be welred and taken that is written of her. And therefore seyth (Job) in the xx
chapter of his book of the rich fyers and orgulous man. All though his pride
be inhau^sed unto the sky yt his head should touch ye clouds / yet in then de
he shall torn to nough te and be like a dong hill. And they that have seen him
shall axe / where is he now / and no thing shall be found of him / nomoie tha^
of a fleyng dreme passed in the night. Baruch) in his.iii. chapter demau^deth
/ where be now the princes of ye people ye where woute to have domynacion over
ye bestes / and take recreacyon with hounds and with hawks of the air. And
assembled great tresours of gold and silver / where in men give their
affiau^ce and trust. what is the end of them that were besy and dylygence
here to forge gold and silver to gadre and keep it Certainly their time is
extermyned and they be descended in to hell / and now ben there other enhaunsed
and live in their places. And therefore says Prosper) in his sentence. where
be ye orators not surmountable / where be they yt have couenably disposed
their fes^^. where be^ also ye palfreymen yt kept the shynynge palfreys in
their stables / where ben the captayns of men of arms. And where ben the
lords and tyrauntes Ben not they all consumed and brought to powdre yes of
their days. And so shall be of ours. Is not theffecte of life altered in to
worms. Behold and look in to their graves / whether you canste know there /
which is the lord / which is the servant / which was the pour / which
was the rich. Dysceuere if thou can by knowleche the prisoner from the king /
the strong from the weke / the fair from the foul Crysostome) seyth. what
has hit auayled them that have lived in lechery. and in the voluptuousness
of this present life / till their last days. Auyse you now and behold in
their sepulcres / and see if thou canste aspye therein any sign of pride / if
thou canste have any knowleche of their richesse or of their lecherye. Axe
where is become their rich array / and their strange dysguysed garments with
their voluptuous / and their nyce looks. And where be also now their grette
companyes and great nombre of servants / that folowen them. where be now
their laughynges their playnges And their outrageous gladnesses out of
mesurable temperau^ce / where is all this become* and whether is it passed
Behold dylygently first the end of one thing and then of that other and
draw the nere their sepultures And thou shall find nothing therein but oonly
ashes / and the remanau^te stynkyng and fulle of worms. A remember thy self
what is the end of all mortal men / be it so yt they have passed the course of
their lives in de^lectable pleasures. or else in labor or in contynence of
their flesh / yet all must dye (Saint Bernarde) seyth in his meditacyons.
Tell me now where be the Amerouse people of this world yt late were among us.
In truth there is nothing left of them but ashes and worms. Think then
and remember often times / what thing they be / and what they have been here
tofore. Parde they have be men as thou art / they have eten and dronken /
lawhed and made great chere in their times. And after in a momente they
descended in to hell. And their flesh delivered for worms mete / and their
soul given in to hell. There to be tormented by fire unto that the body shall
come and Join ageyn there unto. And to be plonged together in thebrachementes
or paynfull Iehennes sempyternall with them yt have been there felawes in doing
sins and commyttyng vices without repentance penance and satysfaccyon. O
what has it prouffyted their vain glory / their short Joy and the
puyssau^ce of this world / the voluptuousnes of ye flesh / the dysceyuable
richesse / the great nombre of their servants / ye unhappy co^cupyscens /
where be their plays and dysportes / where is their bostynge and their worldly
pride The more they had their delectacyon and Ioyed there in here / the more
shall be their pain and sorrow there. And so after a great voluptuous pleasyre
they shall have a miserable and a perpetuell paynfull sorrow. And their being
shall turn them to ruin and hard tourmentes. Loo all that is common unto
them may happen unto you. Thou art but a man / and (homo de humo) That is to
say a man made of earth / th^^ art of therthe / and thou lyuest of the earth
/ and to earth shalt turn again. Of these foresaid amerouse people of this
world living flesshely and not d^^dy^^ge death / which is their neighbor /
speaks (Saint Bernard) unto the brethren of the mount of our lord. O ye
miserable sinners that suffyre the wretchedness of this present life to
return and led you from the right way. And the mean time ye pass your
days in making good chere / ye are descendyng to hell being on live. And
then eueryche of you may say the anguysshes of sorrowful death have
enuyronned me. And I have found my self in the peril of hell. These ben the
miserable ^^^tures that this present life dysceyueth. Of whom is written in
(Job) the.xxi. chapter. These fellows whoos life is inhaunsed in pomp and
pride and be comforted by their richesse They think that their seed shall
abide always by the multytue of their friends and of their neighbors / their
houses to be always assured and in peace. The rod of god not to come upon them
/ their kyen to conceive and not to be bareyn / then^^ece of them to grow and
not to be take from them / they rejoice themself in Iapes and dysportes. they
leave the harp / the tamboryn / the organs / and all vanytees / they continue a
while in ye myrthe / and suddenly they descend in to hell. O how greatly is he
defrauded and begyled. O how folysshely is he mocked / yt for the flourynge
vayn beauty of this world shall descend down in to hell / and lose ye dyade
me of theternall glory. Sothly ye rich man yt by syn^e has deserved ye
pains of hell / had been better to have lived virtuously in great need and
pouerte all his life / than to have great habo^dau^ce of riches and at last
for his sinful life to be dampened. Alas what proufyteth it then the great
tresours and hepes of gold and silver / when sinners shall be sent in to low
tenebres of hell / there to be payned and tormented ever lastyngly without
ceasing. My right dear brother and friend what say yt of the rich and mighty
people of this world. Dye they not as well as other In good faith me seems
they be noe thing priuyleged for as it is written in the book of sapience
the.vii. chapter / the enter of this life is one and comune to all and
semblably so is the Issue. Job says in his xx chapter. This man dies
strong lusty and rich / his bowelles be full of greece and his bones full of
merry. And this other dies lene and feeble full of sorrow and without any
riches / that notwithstondyng they shall sleep both in powdre and worms shall
ete them. Loo how the rich and puyssaunt men of this world have their death
comune and egall with the poor people. And therefore it is written in
(Ecclesiaste) in the x chapter The life of al puyssant lordship is right
breyf. For this day this man is a king / and tomorow he is deed. of such a
king is red in the second chapter of the first book of Machabees how his
glory is a foul dou^ghyll and as vile as a worm / he is to day enhaunsed /
and to morrow there is nothing to be found of him / we have an example
according of one of the highest and most excellence prince of this world.
That is to wete Alexandre the great king of Macedone / that subdewed unto his
obeisance the universal world in such manner / that he was demed to be only
lord of the earth. And it is read that this Alexandre the great sometime king
of Greece obtained many vyctoryes in many strange lands. And in his going by
diverse regyons subdewed unto his Iurisdiccyon all the world. And in a another
place is red of him that he was king of kings / and that he saw all Realms
subget unto him. whereby the voys of his renomme and fortune made an hole
monarche That is to say an hole Empire of all the world. For it was ones all
bond and subget unto him without dysobeyssaunce. And so he was grettest of
all the large world. But what thing thereof ensued. After he had
tryumphantly gotten the only Empire of the universal world / was not that ye
stablenesse of regne. the perpetuyte of might / the health of his body and the
long enduryng of his life natural. Certeynly no. But he was subdewed by ye
same thing that is comune unto all / that is to wete. Death / which is the
last recourse after all fortune and destenyes. Than might Alexander well say
at hour of his death as Job said in the xvi. chapter of his book. I am he
that sometime was rich and mygh ty / and suddenly am beten down / for he
obtained onnly his Empire. But oonly by the space of.xii years. And therefore it
is written of him in a another place. That he reigned and was obeyed xii. years.
And after that he was subget unto death / of whom lives yet the renomme and
can not dye. Semblably compleynynge him self of the death. he might say as is
wrytey in (Job) the xix chapter. My glory has dyspoyled me / and has taken
away the crown fro my head. she has also utterly destroyed me. where through I
am lost. Lo how it appears manyfestely herby. ye death is the end of all men.
And also yt how be it (Julius caesar) had all the world under his Empire / yet
his glory failed him and rested lord but of a tomb of viii foot long.
Whereby it seems that the mageste Royal all worldly puyssance all prosperous
things / and the ordinance of days / pass brefly from man without taryenge
when the hour of death is comen / and therefore seyth an other poet. if yt be
wise. thy wysdom departs with thy death / if yt be habondau^t in richesse / it
leueth the at thy death / if thou be a prudent man / thy prudence fynyssheth
with thy death / if yt be honest / by death is it taken from the / if yt be
strong thy might fails the by death. Certeynly then I now know that the
years yt pass / takes from us all things / wherefore then if yt be rich
strong or fair. what vayleth it / if thou be a bishop / a priour or an abbot
what vayleth it / if thou be a great excellent mighty lord / if thou be a
king or a pope / what vayleth it. all passes right hastly without long
taryeng. And here rests but oonly the merytes / whereof ye good shall cause us
to be gloryfyed. And therefore said Isydore in an omely. My right well-beloved
brethren / we ought to think how breef and short is the worldely felycyte /
how little is the glory of this world / and how frail and faylynge is the
temporal might thereof And therefore every man may say / where be the kings.
where be the pry^ces / where be the emperors / where be the rich and mighty
men of this world. they be all past like a shadow and vanysshed like a dreme
of ye night. for though one would seek them they will not be found here / what
shall I more say / the kings be passed and ye princes be deed nevertheless
there be many yt wenen to live long and never to dye. But always to rest in
this present life. Certeynly they be foles. For it shall not be so. But they
shall dye as other princes and men have done. For as Seneca seyth in his
epistles to Lucyll. The issue of this present life is death. It is written by a
poet named Ieta. The death vndothe all living thing / and every life fynysseth
by death. Certain the worldly death concludes all ye vayn felycytees of men.
For if thou did preche ye faith of Abraham / the pity of Joseph. The charity
of Moses. The strength of Samson. The swetnesse of Dauyd The miracles of
Elyzeus. The richesse and prudence of king Solomon the beauty of Absolon. And
in we pynf occupied the extremities of all these in declaryng their ends / the
hystoryes would show yt there is but one conclusyon. That is to say death. Here
it appears right manyfestly by the thing a fore said / that heaute lynage
condycions wit richesse nor worship can not keep a man / but that he must
stumble and fall and rotourne to ashes. for all thing that is engendered
renneth always toward his death. Ouyde says yt all thing that is engendied
asks and requyreh to come again to their universal modre. That is to say
the earth. For all that has been and paste-afore / may be resembled to a
rennyng river. Semblably I feel it by myself wretch. that am brought all
most to nothing / and have not known hit. for my days be paste fro me
little / and little as a shadow. and I am dried as the wydered hey. Certeynly
we be no thing but powder. Men's days be like the flowers in a medowe. And
them self may be lykeneth to the heye. Now auyse the then / for man is a
thing that endures but short space and is of resemblau^ce to the flower / that
grows in the medowe. It is written in Isaye the.xl. chapitre All humane
flesh is hey / and his glory like the flours of the field. Verily all people
be heye / and all heye dries and wydereth / as the flower that is fallen But
the word of our Lord remains and is perdurable / wherefore then does a man
set him self in pomp and pride being like the wydred hey of the field. It is
written by Innocente in the book of our miserable condycyons. That humayn
flesh is the vessel of fylthe / and a vessel of teeres / a dry thought / a
stynkyng sack. The life of the flesh is labor. The concepcyon of the
flesh is but fylthe. The end thereof is rotennesse. And the birth is but
vile. It was first a sparme. That is to say. The seed of man / and now it is a
stynkynge sack. and after finally shall be worms mete in the earth. Now
wherefore should a man then be proud. Saint Bernard seyth in his book of
Meditacyons / wherefore should a man wax proud sythen ye concepco^n of man is
in syn^e. And of all the birth in pain / the life in labor / and necessaryly
all must dye. And after death turn to worms / and after worms to fylthe and
stenche. Loo thus finally every man is clearly converted and turned out of all
humanyte. Consider than the beginning of thy life / the myddle / and also the
last end. And thou shalt find therein a right great occasyon and cause to
meke and humble thy self. Now what say yt / what thynkest yt / what
reckoning make thou of thy self. art thou ought but powder of the earth. It
is written in the.xii. chapter / but more plainly in the iii. chapter of the
same Ecclesiastes. The powdre recometh to the earth that it come fro That is to
wete to right a foul roten earth full of worms And therefore writes. Job in
his.xvii. chapter. I have said to rotennesse / thou art my fader and my mother
/ and I have said to the worms ye be my brethern and my sustres. It is read
in Ecclesiasticus in the xvii chapter that every man is earth and ashes / and
thereof have take their being. And also it was said to a man. Thou art but
powdre / and to powdre shall return. And as Aleyn amonysseth and warns the /
when you shalt lie in the cold earth. thou shall torn to powdre and worms
mete / and from thensforth there shall no creature be in will to look upon the.
For thy flesh shall be more rank in stynche than the flesh of a roten
hounde. To this purpose says ye holy man Saint Bernarde / what is a more vile
and slynkyng thing than the careyne of man. And what is a more odeous thing
to behold tha^ a deed man The more delectable he has been in his lyffe to the
contrary his look shall be horrible after his death / what shall it proufyte us
richesses / delectacyons and worldely worshyppes. The richesse defend us not
from death. nor delectaco^ns from the worms. nor the worshippes from foul
stynkynges. O mighty god eternal / in how miserable chance is man enclosed
Certain my right dear friend / if thou though* test dylygently of ye things
before said. thou sholdest thereby find a right great occasyon to meke and
humble thyselfe. For the Remembrance of death causes humylyte in man. It
appears well by the thrydde book of Lrynges in the.xxi. chapter of king
Achab / which when he herd by Hely the manassynge of death / and that it
approached him. He meked hy^ self in such wise that our Lord said to the
foresaid Hely. See thou not how Achab humbled himself for me. It is said
also that some time / whenne men made and created a pope. there was brought
before him a piece of flax and therein set fire / saying this words following.
Right thus passes the vain glory of this world. Like to say. That as the
fire brenneth lightly the flax / and conuerteth hit in to ashes. Semblably
the glory of this world fails and passes. Isydory reports also. That
auncyently it was accustomed at the coronacyon of the Emperor of
Constantynoble Whenne he was set in his most glory. A masson should come
before him and show him three or four manner of marbell stones / saying that he
should chese. of which of those he would have his tomb made. It is read of
Saint Johan the aumener that was some time patryarke of Alexander that had
commanded to make his Tomb / and would in no wise hit should be fully
fynysshed. And ordained that in great and solemn festes / whenne he was in
his highest honor / one should come unto him and say that thy Tomb is not
fully accomplysshed nor performed / give commandments that hit be
fynysshed. For thou knoweste not how thou shalt dye / nor when that theff
will come / which is to understand the fend. That enforces him self always
to destroy souls. And why did the Pope the Emperor and the patryarke these
things / which where the men most excellent in estate of all the world /
but only to confess and knowelege to themself that they were mortal / and
that they ought not to enhaunse them self in pride nor fortefye them in hope
of long life / whereby they should have the more power in this vain worldly
glory / but that they might have before hem then the Remembrance of death to
cause them to be the more humble in all their works. And therefore says the
prophet. Lino we all people that men be comen and made of earth. And therefore
they must necessaryly dye. It is also written in Ecclesyastes in the.xli.
chapter. All things that be come of the earth / shall be converted again to
the earth / whereof man is comen as it is well known. And therefore seyth
Iheremias the prophet in the.xxii. chapter. Earth. earth. earth. Now harken
my words. He called man thryes earth / by cause he may so be named in thie
manners. First he is earth / for he is made of the earth. Secondly his
conuersacyon is in the earth. And finally he retourneth in to the earth. So is
he earth in his creacyon / in his conuersacyon / and in his death. He is earth
by his nature in his life. And in his sepulture he has sanoured the earth. he
has lyked the earth / he has desired and coueyted the earth. The body of man
is taken and doluen in the earth. And yet he forgeteth the celestyall things /
and pleteth for the terrestyall. And gives battle for the earth. He goothe.
He comes. And tourneth abowte the earth to have the earth. And oftentimes in
anguysshes / pain / and labor / now here / now there. And all for the earth
/ and never ceasing till he him self / which is come from the earth / be
returned again to his first mother. That is to say / the earth. It may be
said / as it is written in the iii. book of the Liynges in the second
Chapter. Loo how I depart and pass the comune way of the universal earth.
And for as much as we be bounden with slyme of the earth / dou^ge of the earth
/ and be right vile thing / wherefore should we then be proud of our self
/ knowing we be come from the earth / living in the earth / conuersyng in the
earth / and finally shall recourne in to the earth / as every day it appears
euydently un to all people

How Remembran^ce of death makes a man to despise all things.

The second chapter of this first pryncypall part.
Remembrance of death causes a man to myslyke all erthely vain things. and
to repute them as no thing. Therefore says Saint Iherome in his prologue of
the Bible. That easily he dyspyseth all bad thing / that always remembers /
how he must dye. The concupyscence of eyes is despised whenne one remembers
that he shall shortly part and leave all erthely things. The concupyscence of
the flesh is dispysed / whenne one remembers / that his body shall become
worms mete. In a momente the pomp and pride of this life is set at naught
/ whenne a man counterpeyseth in his heart / how he that would be above all
other / shall be hastily cast in to earth under the fete of other. For this
cause says Saint Iherome in a pystle that he sent unto Lypryane. Remember
the well of thy death / and thou shall not sin. He then that always bererth
in remembrance / how he must dye. disprayseth easily all things present /
dysposyng himself to all good things that be to come. Certainly (Esau)
considering how death was nyghe unto him / dyspraysed lyghtely all worldely
things. It is also written in (Genesis) in the five and twenty chapter. Loo
behold I dye and what shall proufyte me all thoos things that I am borne
unto. Isydore) Also aduertysynge him self of the shortness of this present
life / which is so soon passed / and that all that men seem to have in
possessyon here shall be left suddenly by death / exorted every man to
dysprayse such things. Saying if thou will be in rest and peace / desire no
thing of this world / and so thou shall be quyete in thy courage / if thou put
from the all the desires and curyous besynesses of this present life. Set a
part all thing that may dystourbe and let thy good purpose. be thou deed
to the world / and the world to the / and as though thou were deed / behold
the vayn glory of this world. And as a man passed / dysseuer* and depart the
from the voluptuousness of this world. And as a man fynysshed / have this
world in no cheerte. And as a man passed out of this world / purge the of all
manner of fylthes. And also while thou art a live disprayse all that thou may
not have when thou art deed Seneca says. that there may no thing proufyte the
so much in that temperau^ce and dispraysyng of all worldely things as shall
do to thenke often of the short endurynge / and the Incerteynte of this present
life. Thene my right dear friend / Remember often in thy courage / how thou
must dye. It is read in a book made of the gift of dirde. How long a go^
/ there was a right wise phylosophie that holy abandoned him to the vanytees
of this wretched world / which in a time herd read of the long life of
Auncyente faders / and of eueryche of them was said in the end he is deed. As
is written in Genesis. in the fyfthe chapter. Then he thought in him self /
that semblably death should happen unto him as it did unto those / for he was
right old. And hastily he entered in to relygyon / and took the order of the
friar prechoures / and was after made master of Theologye in Paris. And from
that day forth lived a full holy life. O how well had this man before his
eyes the words of Ecclesiastes. in the enleuenthe chapter. Saying. That man /
which had lived many years always glad and Joyful / he ought to remember
well his last days / and the coming of the horrible tenebrouse time. For
then it shall be but vanytee / to argue of things paste for his remedy.
Certeynly at the day of death appears vanyte of vanytees / and how all
things shall be then vain and naught. For this cause it is written in
Ecclesiastes in the thrydde chapter. All things here be resting under
vanytee / and true it is all things of this world / and eueryche of them be
vain. For our life / and every worldely creature is but vanytee. And therefore
says the Prophet. That universally every living man is vanytee. Thou wenest
to live long / and many a years to possess delycyously thy temporal goods*
Certain my right dear friend. It shall be all other wise For man is made
semblable unto vanyte and his days pass as a shadow. Behold now and see
how thy days shall be but short / and then an other shall come and take
thy possessions. Unto this purpose says Cathon Promytte never to thy self
that thou shalt have long space of life. For in what place so ever thou
enter / death follows always the shadow of thy body. And therefore if thou
look upon the words that be said. And also conceive dilygentely in thy heart
that shall be showed the here after / thou sholdest rather say these words
than otherwise. I goo now to my death / and trust to live after by a long
space. All be it perauenture this is the last day of my life. The holy and
blessed man Saint Luke) says in his xii. chapter. O thou foul / this night
thy soul shall be axed of the and be certain that the dysposycyon of thy
tabernacules is but light. As is written in the second epistle of saint (Petre
in ye first chapter Think then that thou art deed / when thou knoweste
necessaryly that after a nombre of years thou art certain to dye Therefore
dysprayse all transytory things that must be hastly left. as is to sey
without any taryenge though it be loathe unto the. The poet tells ye wysdom.
^entis of lands possessyon of richesse. the making of walled towns / the
byldyng of houses / the glorious manner of living at the table as well in
pleasant drynkes / as in delycyous metes. the feyre soft beds well hanged
and dressed the white table clothes / the bright burnyssed cups / the rich
garments contrary to good manner the great flokkes or herdys of beestes. The
great countries of arable lands / the vyneyerdes plenteuously set with
vynes / and the Joy and the love of his propre childern / yet shall all this
be relynquysshed pass and be lost / and nothing be found thereof here after.
By these things may be seen that in this present life is no thing stable
nor permanente / which ought to cause diede. Therefore writes (Ecclesiastes)
in the second chapter. I have gretely exalted my works. I have edyfyed me
fair houses. I have planted vynes. I have made gardeyns / wherein I have
graffed of all manner of trees. I have also cast poondes / and stagnes / and
have set trees in the forest I have had servants and chamberers. and
great company in my household more thanne ever had any before me in
Iherusalem. I have had great flocks of sheep / and droues of bestes. I have
assembled for me gold and silver. and gadered the tresoure of kings / and of
the prouynces / my neighbors. And also have herd before me syngers / both men
and wymmen / and many delectaco^ns of the childern of men. And have done so
much / that I have surmounted in richesse all that have been before me in
Iherusalem Wisdom also has all ways perseuered in me and all that ever
mine eyes have desired. I have not denied them not defended / but that they
have used all voluptuousness / and they have had no delectacyon / but in
such things that I had ordained them / and when that I turned me and beheld
well all these things / and the works that my hands had wrought and looked
upon the labor that I had many times swette in. and all for naught. I
perceived then and knew well / that all my works were but vanyte and
affection of spyryte. And yt under the son in this world was no thing
permanent nor sure. Now in troth all things pass here like a shadow.
Therefore seyth Johan de garlandia. That al thing of this world. yt was is and
shall be. perysseth in the moment of an hour. what proufyteth than to have been /
to be now / or to be herafter. Certain these be three things blowyng without
flours For all thyngis yt were be or shall be have a finyssynge The world
passes and the concupyscens thereof also. And therefore it is said / wherefore
takes a wyseman thought for to get tresoure which is sone lost. And saint
Bernarde says in his book of medytaco^ns. wherefore makes any man tresour here
of riches / sythen with out delay both that yt is assembled and he that gadereth
hit passen and be lost together. O thou man what anayll entendes yt to have in
this world / whenne the fruit is but ruynouse and the end death My cordyall
and good friend / now would god that thou would understand well these
things / and suerly ordeyne for thy last things. Petre de bloys says in a
pystle. that the dysceyuable vayn glory of this world begyleth all thoos that
loves hit For all that ever it promytteth in time to come or pretends in
time present fails and comes to naught / as water cast upon the earth.
Behold then how frail / how disceyuable / and how vayn is the world and the
Joy thereof / that we desire so mekell. O ye fool wherefore dispysest thou not
lightely thoo^^ ^^nges that thou see (...) shortly fail and pass. Lrnowest
thou not how the world is right naught and furyous And that in languyssyng /
it perysseth by the gleyue of the right cruel death / hit is a troth that none
argument can serve to the contrary wherefore / and by thise things before
rehearsed / it appears manyfestely how Remembrance of death should cause
dispisyng of all worldly things and withdrawynge a man from falling to sin.

How Remembrance of death makes a man to take upon him penance.

The thryd chapter of the first pryncypall part.
Following thorder before let. It is now to enquere diligently. how remembrance
of death causes a man to do penance and gladly to accept it. This appears
clearly by Jonas the prophet in the ii^. chapitre / spekyng of them of Nynyue
/ which did penance for fere of death / wherefore saint Johan Baptyste
enduceth men also to do penance. As Saint Luke writes in his.iii. chapitre
saying. Do ye the dygne fruytes of penance. And he says afterward. The axe
is set to the rote of the tree. Which sygnyfyeth the thretenynges of death.
And therefore says Saint Ambrose upon Luke. Alas lord if I have not bewailed
my sins. Alas lord if I have not risen at myd night to confess me to the.
Alas if I have begyled my neighbor. Alas if I have always said truth. The
axe is ready set to the rote. Every man therefore then do penance / and
deserve the fruit of grace. For here comes ye lord to ask the fruit of our
life For this cause Job considering the shortness of this present life / had
lever and chase to have repentance presently / than afterward whereby should
grow no fruit The same Job said in his.x. chapter. shall not my short days
breefly fynysshe / yes in truth The life present is right short. Alas then a
little while let me compain and bewail my sorrow a fore my departing in to
the tenebrous derkenesse of death with out retornyng. And it is also said in
Job the xiiii. chapter. That man's days be breef. It is written in the first
pystle ad Corintheos in ye evii. chapter / the time is breef / were it not
better then now breefly to sustain a little pain / then afterward when it
cannot profyt to repent without profyt and bewail it infynytely. Saint Austyn
seyth ye better is a lityl bytternesse in ye mouth / then eternally to suffer
pain in all ye hole body of man. Also he seyth in a sermon / yt ye life of every
man from his youth to his age is but short / though Ada^ lived yet. and should
this day dye what should it aua^taged him to have lived so long. sothly little
or naught / but he might sey ye time of my life is past And also says a wise
man / what should it profit a man to live. CC. years when at his death. he shall
think all his life is passed as wind. And saint Austyn says upon the
Psalter. If thou had lived sens Aoam was chased out of paradyse terrestre
till now / and that thou sholdeste dye this day / thou sholdest think thy
life not long / which so soon should pass. Now how long so ever a man's
life be / take that it may be lengthed asmoche more to cause many years / yet
it shall fail and vanysshe / as the shynynge of the morrow son. And the
same. Saint Austyn seyth in an Omely. that we be more frail and brotyll /
then though we were made of glass. For all be it that glass is brotyll / yet
if it be well kept it may endure right long. But man's life be it never so
well and dilygently kept it may not long endure. Therefore it is written to the
Hebrews in the.ix. chapitre. It is establysshed and ordained every creature
ones to dye. And Senek says in his book of remedies against fortune That our
life is but a pylgremage and when one has long walked / he must finally
return This necessite to dye / and shortness of ye life of man was well
considered by ye paynym Xerses. Of whom saint Iherom wrote in a pystle to
Elyodorus sayng yt this puyssa^t king xerses / which subverted ye monteyns and
couored the sees / being ones in right hye place looked upon the Infynyte
multitude of his host and tendrely wept / by cause he knew yt none of thoos
whom he beheld should live over an. C. years It is a thing right necessary in
the world / yt man's life be not long lasting. And as Balam says. It is
lykened to a tree having.ii. worms fretynge in the rote / the one blak and the
other white in ye symylytude of the day and the night / which Incessantely
gnawe the rote of the tree of life. Saint Austyn upon the sayng of Saint Johan
in his.iii. chapitre treatyng upon this questyon Quid est vita nostra etc) This
life is a doubtful life / a blind life and a nedy life / humors make hit to
bolne. sorrows make hit feeble / hete dries hit / eyer dysposeth hit to
sickness / mete makes hit to swelle / fasting makes hit lene / plays makes
hit to err / waylynge destroyed hit / business constreyneth hit / sewer^e
makes hit rude / rekles riches enhaunseth hit pouerte abateth hit / weeping
abassheth hit / youth makes hit wanten / age makes hit to yield. sickness
makes hit to break. And after all this comes death / which destroys and
makes an end thereof with all his Joys in such wise. as whenne the Joys be
past / all seems as they had never ben. Also it is read in the book of
Sapyence in the.ii. chapitre. That the days of our life nys but short / and
yet are they full of greuaunce / we be made and wot not whereof And after we
shall be. as we had never ben. For our days passen as does a shadow. It
is red in the same book of Sapyence in the same chapitre. That our life passes
like the trace of a cloud and shall fail as the little cloud. that is broken
by the might of the son beams. It is written in Job the.vii. chapitre.
Behold how my days be all passed / and I shall goo forth in the pathe / and
shall never return ageyn. Also the same Job says in the.ix. chapitre My
days are passed more lightly than a curroure or a messanger. They are gone
lightly away as ships done that be charged with apples. Or as an egell does
flee for his mete. Job says also My days be passed more lightly than clothe
is cut from the lome. and they be all wasted without any hope of recouerey.
O lord god Remember then. is my life ought but wind / and shall not my eyes
return ageyn to see ye good things to come To ye purpose speaks Petre de
bloys in his book called Aurora. My life shall be sooner out of this world / than
a web of clothe cut from the lome Remember you then how thy life may be
resembled to the wind. Loo now my right dear friend how short / how little
/ how mutable / how disceyuy^g is this our life present / for as it is said
in Ecclesiastes in the.xviii. chapitre. It is great age in a man to be.C. year
old* but by succession of time it is gretely amynysshed It is written in the
Psalter. The days of our years be.lxx. and if we may come to four score year
/ the superplus is no thing but labor and sorrow. But what is it of.lx. year
or yet of Cought this to be taken of a long time and a great space of years.
Certeynly nay in regard toward the sempiternyte. It ought rather be named a
moment tha^ a space of time. for to our lord a.M. year is but as yesterday.
which lightly is past. Derely this life in short and transytory / paynfull and
wretched / hit is not only to be thought nor poysed for the shortenesse. But
much more for the incerteynte thereof which is doubtful / and full of casuel
peril / and we be not sure thereof day nor hour. And whenne it shows us
sewerte and peace then suddenly comes death / and with hit perauenture ye
false theif Satan Therefore says to us a poet. who is he knowing himself to
live many years / sens we know not whether we shall dye to morrow or sooner.
It is written in Isaye the xxxviii. chapitre saying. Dyspose thy house / for you
shall dye sone / and not long live. Isaye seyth also in the same Chapitre / yt
my life is hit from me as a piece of clothe from the lome. And whenne I began
first the lyffe. then began death to approach toward me. For this cause it is
said in the book of Sapience in the.v. chapitre / we be soon born. and sone
leave our being. To this purpose seyth Senek in his pystles. Eueryday we dye.
and every day is taken away from us part of our life. Than thus what is our
life ought else but a passage / or a rennyng toward death / and therefore it is
not unreasonable yt she be lykened to an Orylage / which gooth always from degree
to degree co^tynually mouynge till it come to a certain point / and then it
stryketh suddenly upon ye belle / which co^streyneth the sown Semblably our
life passes always and renneth till it come to a certain point. That is to
wit The hour of our death which our lord has prefixed / and no man may it
pass / and than our life falls and fails without remedy. Awake then and
entende wisely to the end of thy life For thyn Orylage has but few degrees
to run. and every hour she ouerpasseth many. And whenne it comes to the
last / thou shall stomble suddenly in to the cauerne or cave of death. Now
harken what a Poet says. The present life is short always fleing / and
fades as a shadow / and departs and falls suddenly / when one wenes that
she be most permanente and abydyng / and in the mids of our life / we be
often at our death. And therefore have we in Ecclesiastes in the.ix. chapter.
That man knows not his end / but as a fysshe taken with a net / and the
bryddes with a trappe. Semblably men be taken at inconuenyent times / thus
comes our end and death is ye last thing to all things beryng life. It is
written in a book of the life and of the deeds of great Alexander. O how happy
should a man be if he had always in Remembrance of the eternal Joys / and
drad death yt is ordained as well to the nobles as to the poor people which
comes to the great peril and danger of the soul whenne it is unpurueyed.
Loo here then my right dear friend / you see well yt the life of man is but a
thing dyked about. and enuyrou^de with ruynous death / our flesh is but
ashes. And such as was the beginning / such shall be the end / saint
Bernarde says. whe^ne I Remember that I am but ashes / and that mine end
approached my dread and fere is without end / and I wexe cold as ashes. And
therefore as* Saint Gregory says. That man sollycyteth well his good works /
that thenketh allewaye upon his last end And we should dread that every day
should be our last day. And always have in mind / that necessaryly we must
dye / who may have then a bold courage considering the shortness the great
Incerteynte of our life / the approchyng of our death which is coming / who
is he also you ought not think dilyge^tely that our days and our years fail
and waste as the smoke. And ye man naturelly born lives but a short space /
and fades as a flower / and flees a way like a shadow / who is he also that
calls thyese things to mind / and peyses them well in his heart / and so
subdeweth the devil the flesh and the world and repents him in this
short space. To say you troth there be none that defer and be neclygent so
to do / but oonly those that be all blinded in malice and lack of grace. O
how great a pain shall ensewe of neclygence. Thappostle says to the Hebrews
in the seconde-chapitre. How shall we flee that despise so great an health. As
to say we might have heaven if we would. And Saint Effran says. My right dear
brotheren and friends. if we be neclygent in the little space of time that we
have now / we shall have no manner of excusacion to allegge for remedy of our
sins. Therefore dysprayse not the shortness of this time. But do penance
while ye have space here For after it will be to late and without fruit. And
better is to do penance here / than Infynytely and world without end to
repent hit. Now haste ye therefore and tarry not. Lest that ye finally be shet
out with the fine fatuat and fonned virgyns. Saint Mathewe seyth in his.xxv.
chapitre Loo here is the spouse come / and thoos that were ready / ben entered
with hy^ to the weddyng / wherup on Saint Gregory says. That the palace of
the heart might well asauoured how wonderful was that word. Here is the
spouse which is come. How sweet was that word to them. that entered with him
to the weddyng. And how bitter was ye other word. the yates be shytte and
closed. My dear friend if you did savor and understand well all this things
and beheldest them well in thine heart. Certeynly you would run with all
dilygence for to do penance. and would not lose so vnproufytably. and without
fruit ye acceptable time and days of thy health / for no manner of voluptuous
playsers or other idleness And as it is written in ye Apocalips in the.ii.
chapitre. Remember the fro whens thou art fall or departed / and do penance.
It is red how in days passed it happened in the Abbey of Cleruaulx yt an holy
man being in his prayers herd a voys making a pyteous lamentacyon. And as he
asked who it was. a soul answered saying I am the soul of a dampened man /
complaynyng mine unhappy cause of condemnaco^n. And then he demanded him of
his pain. which answered yt of all things yt causes most pain to a dampened
soul was loss of time / that god had ordained man by his grace that he in a
little time might have done penance. which should delyuere him from the
everlasting peynes of the gehenne of hell. To this purpose said Hugo of saint
Dyctour. The lackyng of the sight of our lord / and faylyng of all the goods
of grace / that we might have had should surmou^te and be more grievous unto
the / thanne all the Infernal tourmentes. Let us do good works while we have
time / lest we say in repentance. As is said in Iheremyas in the.viii.
chapitre. That is to wete. Heruest is past. Somer is fynysshed / and we be not
saved / wherefore my friends I require and humbly pray you / that ye will
amend your self in short time and make you ready in this.x. hour / for the
euenyng hastes him. And the rewarder shall come to yield every man after his
works. Hit may appear by these examples / how Remembrance of death should
induce a man to do penance. It is red of a felonous and a cruel knight.
which would never accept nor do any penance enjoined him by pope Alexander.
And at last the pope gave hy^ his ring / yt he should here it on his finger /
by way of penance. And as often as he beheld him to think on his death. And
when he had boren hit a space of time with ye Remembrance on a day he come
ageyn to the pope sayng he was ready to shryue hy^ and to fulfill every other
manner of penance. that he would enjoin him. It is red of an other sinner yt
in like wise would do no penance / and at last his confessoure enjoined him /
that he should command his servant to present him every day at his table
with the first mess / a staff the rynde scorched of / saying. Sir Remember
that necessaryly ye must dye / not knowing where / whenne / in what manner nor
how. And as this was a good while continued / because of that Remembrance /
all that he ete turned him to grefe and trouble. And then he called again
for his confessor / saying he was ready to do and obey any penance that he
would ordeyne. For his heart was merueylously brought in great trouble by the
fere of death / which he was in. Loo by these things a fore rehearsed /
appears then clearly Enough how Remembrance of death causes a man to humble
him self / to despise all worldly things / and acceptably take upon him to
do penance and consequently to eschew sins And therefore my right dear
brethern and friends. Remember you often / ye and right often that ye shall
dye. And ye here in your minds the death / ye shalt well come by that
reme^bryng to most happy resort of life. That is to wit. the heritage of our
lord Ihesu Christ.

And thus ends the first part of this treatise divided in four.
Here begins the prologue of the second party of the four last things.
THe second part of the four last things whereof frequenting ye
Remembrance reuoketh and calls us from syn^e. Is the last and fynall day of
Judgment / of which ye Remembrance draws us not only from the dedely great
sins. but also from the small venyall. And therefore it is read in Vitis
Patru^ in the life of faders That an ancient man seeng a young man laugh
dyssolutely / laid sone we must give acco^pte of all our life / before heaven
and earth / why laughest thou so fast. As who says / if you knew how strayte
a Rekenyng shall be at the day of dome of all sins as well great as small.
Certeynly you would not laughe / but rather sorrow and complain. Now is here
the place to weep and to put away sins. And thoos that now weep for their
sins shall laugh herafter. Saint Gregory says in his Omelye. That the
gladness of this time present ought to be but such. as thereby the bytternesse
of the day of Judgment be not put out of Remembrance. Therefore it is written
in Ecclesiastes the.xxxviii. chapitre. Here my Judgment in Remembrance. And
also our lord by his prophet in ye psalter seyth when I shall see or take the
time. I will deem and do Justice to every one. and Iohell says in his last
chapitre. All men arise and come togydres in to the vale of Iosephat. For
there I shall sytte and Judge all manner of people about me. Iheremyas in his
second chapitre says yt our Lord says. I shall amownte with you in
Judgment. Of this Judgment is written in Ozee the fourth chapitre. Ye childern
of Israhell / here ye the word of our lord of the fynall Judgment that
perteyneth to our Lord upon thenhabytantes of ye earth. Sothely this Judgment
is gretely to be doubted. Therefore says the prophet. I dred for thy
Iugementes. It is written in the book of Sapyence in the.v. chapter. They that
see the great Judge / shall be horrybly troubled / playnynge and waylyng the
dread of their souls. Certeynly in this day shall all people be troubled /
and they that dwell in the vtterest party of the world shall fere those
tokens and signs / and they shall doubt them / and not with out cause. For
they shall be merueylously horrible Saint Luke seyth in his xxi chapitre /
whenne the sone of man shall show himself. That is to sey The child of the
virgyne marye coming in a cloud in mageste with a great puyssau^ce / then
shall the signs show in the son / in the moon / and in the s^erres. And on
the earth shall be pressure of people dredynge to be cunfused with the sound
of the wawes of the sea. Men universally of all ye world shall fall down for
the dread and fere that they shall have then. O thou wretched man. Remember
of the terryble coming of this Judge / that is both god and man / which a
fore him has a brennyng fire. And a strong tempeste. I say there shall a
fire go before him. which shall flamme holy about his enemies. It is written to
the Hebrews in the tenthe chapter. Right terryble is the abiding of this
Judgment. And the fere thereof / which shall destroy his adversaries. And
Malachyas says in his iii. chapitre. See here the day yt shall come fla^mynge
like a chemenye. And then it shall brenne all proud men / and thoos yt have
committed felonye It is read in Isaye in the.xlvi. chapitre. Here is our lord
yt shall come and Judge by fire. And Iohell in his.ii. chapitre says He shall
have a fire before his face devouring and behind him a brennyng flamme. For
this cause says Malachyas in his thrydde chapitre / who shall he be then
that shall now see our Lord. For he shall be as a fire glowynge / set to
make clean / and purge silver / who is then he of devout courage that shall
not dread with all his heart this Judge and his coming. And therefore says saint
Gregory upon Ezechyell / who may have ye courage / but that shall fere and dred
the presence of the eternal Judge / when all things shall come then to the
sight of every man / and all things done before by delectacyon shall be with
right great dread called to Remembrance. Certain as it is written in ye
Prouerbys in the.xxxviii. chapitre. The evil men thynken not of the Judgment
But they yt desyren and dreden god / have in their hertis all good things.
saint Bernard says in a prose. truly I dread sore the vysage of the Judge yt
shall come to whom no thing can be hyd / and shall no thing rest unpunished.
and who shall he be of us yt shall not dred when yt Judge shall come which
shall have fire brennyng before him to the destruccyon of all sinners.
Certeynly this last Judgment ought greatly to be dred and for.iii. causes. The
first the accusementes shall be in many manners. which all synneis ought
grievously to wayle. The second is the right strayte sentence upon our
governance that syngulerly shall be made to every thing. The third is the
horrible feerfull abiding of the Judgment / which then by the Just Judge
shall be terrybly given These things all sinners ought tymerously dread / which
by consequens the Remembrance thereof should withdraw man from doing sin.

Here ends the prologue of the second part.
How the Accusacyon that shall be at the day of dome is to be drad.

The first chapitre of the second part.
THe first thing then. where by the fynal Judgment ought specially to be
drad is the many and diverse accusacyons / which shall be there against all
sinners / wherefore it is to be known that we find in holy scryptures seven
things that accuse sinners at the great day of Judgment. The first is our
propre conscience / which shall argue against the sinner / not secretly / but
manyfestely then before all. It is written in Danyele in the seuenthe chapitre.
Thy Judgment is set / and thy books be open. That is to wete / the
conscyences / which then be openly uttered In those books be contained the
sciences of life or of death / of glory and of confusyon / of salvation
perpetuell / or da^pnacyon eternal. It is red also in the.xx. chapitre of the
Apocalypse. That deed men shall be Iuged of the things written in their own
books. That is to say / in their consciences Therefore it is written in the
Pystle to the Romans in the second chapitre That their conscyences shall bear
them wyttenesse. For as wyttenesse of the evil conscience is thaccusacyon /
the pain. and the tourment of sinners. Right so shall the good conscience be
help and salvation to the good creatures. The second thing that shall accuse
the sinners / shall be the fendes and the evil spyrytes / which falsely and
traitorously have procured and sturred men to sin. And of all that the
sinner has done they will accuse him / as one thef accuses an other of one
felony done by them both. It is written in the Apocalypse the.xii. chapitre. The
fend is called the accuser of brethren. And Saint Austyn say the. They be all
before the Iudycyall sete of Ihesu Christ. And there the deuellys shall be
ready* which shall rehearse the words of our professyon and shall appose to
our face that we have done / and wherein we have sinned / and in what place /
and what we ought to have done / and left it undone. Truly our adversary that
same fend shall say then. O right wise and Just Judge. Deem this man to be
mine for his sins. For he will not be thine by grace. He is thine by nature.
He is mine by his mysery. He is thyn by thy passion. He is mine by persuasyons.
He has bendysobeysaunte unto the. He has been concentyng unto me. He has
received of the / yt stole of Immortalyte / and of me this black garmente that
he wereth of perpetuell death he that left thy lyuere and has taken mine. he
has left thy Joy and bliss. and has taken my sorrow and pain. O thou
Just Judge. Judge him therefore to be mine / and that he be condampned with me
perpetually. These words said our lord unto. Saint Austyne. The third
thing that accuses sinners. shall be angeles / and the happy good spyrytes.
Certain it is to be believed / that he that has given them our souls to keep
/ shall require to have Reason of that keeping. And as those that never lie nor
will take upon them the sin or fault of other / must nedys say / they be
not to blame. But the gylte is in us sinners / which would not obey nor believe
them. Semblably it is not the defa^te of the physycyen / which does his cure
as it ap perteyneth if he hele not his pacyent which is disobeysau^t unto him.
And therefore hit is written in Iheremye the one and fyfty chapitre / we have
had Babylon in cure / and yet she is not heled. These be the words of the
Angeles as they will say / we have done all that was necessary to be done to
Babylon to the end that should be cured and heled. But it is in her defaut yt
she is not he led. This Babylon is to be lykened to man's soul The.iiii.
thing yt shall accuse sinners / shall be creatures. And if thou axed me /
which creatures they be. I answer the / all and eueryche oon of them by them
self. For and the creatoure of all things be offended. all the good
creatures shall have him in hate / thath has dyspleased him. For as Job says
in his twentyest Chapter. The heuens shall show and lift up the evil
works of the sinners / and the earth shall adresse him against them. For our
lord shall call unto him the heaven above / and the earth be nethe to dyscerne
his people. And therefore says Crysostome upon the Gospel. of Saint Mathewe.
There is no thing that we shall mow remedy by answer that day / whenne
the heaven and the earth / the son and the moon / the night and the day /
and all the world shall bear wytenesse against us for our sins. The refore
says Saint Gregory. If thou axe me / who shall accuse the I say to the / all
the world. And that the creatures shall not oonly accuse the sinners. But also
shall require the creator of all things to take vengeance on them for their
sins. To this purpose it is written in the book of Sapyence in the fyfthe
chapitre. He shall arm all creatures to take vengeance on his enemies. And
with him shall fight all the world against those / that have been Insensate.
that is to wit / against sinners. All creatures seeng him that is maker of all
things shall chase them to cause tourmentes to be given upon thoos that have
not be Just. The fyfthe thing that shall accuse the sinners / they shall be
miserable persons / that have suffered so many wrongs. For then they shall
accuse thoos that have done them wrong peyn and tourment. At that time shall
the word of the prophet be verifyed which says. I have known well that our
lord will give Judgment / for the poor folks yt have suffered wrong. and
shall avenge the quarrel of thoos yt be Impotent for he yt beholds the deep
botoms of the sees / and sytteth above all the Cherubyns and Seraphyns / and
gooth above all the wyndes. He is more terryble to be drad in his counselles
and wylles than is the sons of men He shall Judge then^e poor mennys cause
that have been constant. And shall hold against those that have done them many
anguysshes Then^e shall the fader of Orphans / and the Judge of wydewes venge
all wrongs / the pacyence of poor folks shall not then perysshe The
subgettes shall also accuse the felones and neclygente prelates and curates And
therefore says saint Bernarde upon the Cantycles. O how cruel our lord shall
be upon the sons of men. Certain the wretched sinner shall say then all for
naught to the monteyns. Fall ye upon us and to the Rocks cover ye us. They
shall come then^e before the trybunall sete of Ihesu Christ / where shall be
herd full grievous accusacions by thoos that have paid their wages / and boren
their dispenses wrongfully / and their sins shall not be defaced nor hid of
those yt fraudelently have blinded their doctors and confessors. The vithyng
yt shall accuse sinners / shall be malice and sin / we read in Iheremye the
second chapitre Thy malice shall accuse the / and thy refusyng shall blame the
For the sins shall then be bonden unto the neck of sinners. To this
purpose seyth Ozee in his xiii chapitre / the iniquyte of Effraym is bound
togydre and his sins be not hyd / we read mine iniquytees be trussed and leyde
in mine neck / and as the stolen good taken on ye neck of a thef accuses him
semblably syn^e shall then accuse the wretched sinner It is written also in the
Prouerbys the fyfthe Chapter. Iniquytees shall take the felone sinners / and
there eueryche of them shall be taked and strayned with coordys of their
sins. And the Prophet seyth. The coordys of my sins have enuyrou^de / and
goon round about me. By the which coordys I say also the wicked folks by
deuellys shall be drawn in to hell. Certeynly they fall in to their nets.
and be taken by their baytes / we red of the properte of an Archyn which / yt
when he enters in to a gardey ne / he lodeth him with apples stykynge on his
pryckes. And when ye gardener comes. he would flee but he is then so laden
that he can not away / and so he is there taken with all his apples. Semblably
falls hit to the sinner / yt is all laden with sins / and at the great day
of Judgment he is with them taken and accused / wherefore says the Psalter.
Our lord shall be known in making his Iugementes and handwerkes / and the
sinner shall be taken. Upon the which says Crysostom Our own thoughts / and
specially our works shall be before our eyes / and shall accuse us before god.
And therefore says saint Bernarde. Our works and we shall speak together and
say. O miserable sinner thou haste made us / we ben thy works / we will not
leave the / but go with the to thy Judgment. It is red in Ezechiell the.xviii.
chapitre. Like as the Justice of the right wys man shall be on and for him.
Right so the felony of the felon shall rest upon him The Psalter says. Here
ye all people here / and reteyne well in your eres all ye that dwellen in this
world / wherefore shall I not be dredefull in that evil day. That is to wyce.
the day of dome. which shall not oonly be evil to me But it shall be right
evil to every sinner. where unto he answers himself saying. I shall dread
then For the Iniquyte of my fete shall enuyron me. The seventh and the last
thing that shall accuse sinners / shall be the tourmentes and Instruments of
the passion of Ihesu Christ. And also Ihesu Christ himself wherefore says saint
Iherom. The cross of Ihesu shall fight against the. Ihesu Christ shall show and
allegge his wou^des again the. And ye trace of the said wou^des shall speak
against the. The nails shall complain on the. As Saint Austyn says in his
treat of symboll* perauenture our lord has kept in his body the trace of
tokenes of his wou^des to thentent that at the day of dome / he will she we
them against sinners to their reproach. And in vaynquyssyng them say Lo here
behold the man that ye have crucyfyed. See here god and man / in whom ye would
have no believe. Look upon the wou^des that ye have made him. knowledge the
side that ye have wounded and hurt / which has been opened for you. But ye
have not well entered therein. Ihesu Christ also then accusyng the sinners /
shall say as Naum said in his third chapitre. I shall show thy de fautes
before thy face / and shall show to the people thy nakedness and to the reames
thy shame. Ozee in his second Chapitre says. I shall manyfeste and show thy
folly before the eyes of thy lovers. and that is / no man may draw the out of
my hondes. O how desolute and how sorrowful that the miserable sinners shall be
in the day of the great Judgment. For then as it is written in the first
chapitre of the Apocalypse. Every eye shall see him / and all the lynages of the
earth shall complain on him. Then sinners seeing all this shall be full of
anguysshes and fere

How the last Judgment shall be terryble. For then^e shall be given rekenyng
of all thing.

The second Chapitre of the second part.
THe second thing that shall cause the extreme and last Judgment to be
dredefull / shall be the strayte Reckoning and accomptes of our vile dedys in
all thing. Saint Luke says in his.xvi. Chapitre. yield Reason of thy dedys /
for after this life thou shall mow no more work. My right dear friend. if
thou sholdest give a Rekenyng and accomptes of a thousand ponde / before a
temporal lord prudent and wise thou would be full well ware and take good
head how thou sholdest make him a Just and a due Reckoning. Have thou then
much more thought and be more dredefull to yield good Reckoning and accomptes
of all thing that thou haste committed and done / and of thy dute left undone
/ whenne thou shalt come before god / his angels / and all his saints. In
whoos presens necessaryly thou must account. And not only of the great
things but also of the small. ye unto ye lest part of them And as it is written
in the third chapitre of Isaye Our lord shall come to Judge with all his most
Ancient people. zacharyas in his.xiiii. chapitre says. Our lord my god
shall come / and his sayntis with him. That is to wit. To the general
Judgment / which shall be done before all openly and not in hydeles. And
therefore it is gretely to be doubted. For it is written in zophonyas in the
third chapitre. He shall hold his Judgment in the morning by day light. and
shall not hyde him. There shall be then^e many diverse Reasons to give Rekenyng
of all things. First of our soul / which has been committed and given us
by God. Now truly if a king had delivered his daughter to one of his
subgettes yt he entyerly loved / entendyng to make her a queen in his Reame.
And if the said subgette had not kept her well / who would doubt / but
that the Lrynge would have a Reckoning / and know the cause / how and why /
his daughter had be so evil and so neclygentely kept / what shall the
king of heaven do then to him that has taken his daughter to keep That is to
wit. The soul / which he loves specially / and entendeth to enhaunse to
Royal dignyte in heaven if he have kept her evil shall not god therefore axe to
have thereof rekenyng and reason / yes hardely It is written in Deutronom^i the
fourth chapter. ^repe thoughtfully thy self and thy soul also. And Saint
Austyn says. It is a greter loss of one soul / then of a thousand bodies.
Saint Bernarde says in the book of his Medytaco^ns That all this present
world may not be esteemed nor valued to so high a price as one soul. Also
he says / wherefore make thou thy self fact and enournest thy flesh with
precious stones / which after a few days worms shall ete within thy
sepulture. And wherefore makeste thou not thy soul fair with good manners and
virtues / which at the day of dome ought to be presented to God and his
Angels / wherefore take thou none head to make her fair and clean against
that time. And why applyest thou rather to thy flesh. then ne to her / why
put thou the chamberer before the lady as to be governed rather by thy
flesh / thanne by thy soul. It is a great abusyon. saint Bernard seyth
himself in the book of dyspraysyng of the world. Now a days the cure and the
charge of the soul is despyseth and left / and thaccomplysshemente of all
their desire is after ye will of the flesh / they dread not to do sin nor
remember not how they shall be rigorously punyssed My right dear friend wylt you
then love better things of little valewe than thoos that been more dygne and
of here price Enhaunse not thy body and suffer never the lady to be come
Chamberer. To this purpose says Crysostome. If we dysprayse our soul / we may
not save our body. Truly the soul is not made for the body / but the body is
made for the soul. Then he that dysprayseth the highest and first thing and
enhaunsed the second and the lowest / hurts both the one and the other. But
he that keeps therein good order / exalts and keeps that that is chyef / and
dysprayseth that / that is second for he heleth that / that is most dygne and
first. That is for to say the soul. If thou will than save thy soul / and
yield god a good rekenyng there of. Instruct her with science and dyuyne
virtues. Plato says in his book of Thymeo. The soul is Joined with the body
to thentent that she may learn science and virtue. If she come with wynnynges she
so to be resceyued of her maker / and if not she then to be sent in to hell
there to remain in tourment and pains perpetuell. Secondly we must yield
Reason and rekenyng of our body. It is our castle committed and delivered us
by god wherefore says Saint Bernard He keeps well a good castle / that
keeps well his body. There shall be axed reckoning of the keeping of this
castle. As wether the enmyes of our Lord / which be vices and
voluptuousness of the flesh / have be resceyued therein at any time. And if
his friends and his servants / which be virtues and good works / have been
shamefully chased out. If we have done so / it is a great sign and
suspeccyon of our perdycyon. And we shall nedely yield Reason and Reckoning.
Thefore our body is as a Mare that our Lord has given us to use for the
prouffyte of our soul / of the which we shall yield Rekenyng. As in three
things. It is written in Ecclesyastyco the three and therty chapitre. The mete /
the Rod and the burdon is given to the ass. The bread the oyscyplyne and the
work is given to the seruau^te. Certeynly our body sygnyfyeth as well a mare
and an ass / as a servant / unto whom is given the bread for sustentaco^n of
nature The rod of dyscyplyne. for to refrayn vanytees. And the burdon of good
works / for the peefeccyon of penance. Our Lord then shall axe of this
his Mare / his Ass / or his Servant / if we have mynystred to him his mete
dyscretely not to largely nourysshynge. For he that nouryssheth over
delycyously his servant / shall find him after the more fyers and proud. It
is written in the Prouerbys the nine and twenty Chapitre. And also not to give
the body over little of that / that is necessary to hit. For so we might be
homycydes of our own flesh. Against this speaks Saint Bernarde in a Pystle
to the Brethren of the mount of God saying. There be many other excercyses of
the body / in the which it is necessary to labor as in wakynges / fastings /
which impecheth not / nor lets spyrytuall things. For if they were let
other by defaute of spyryte / or by sickness of the body / he that so should
take away from his body theffect of good work. The true desire of his
spyryte. The good example to be showed to his neighbor / and the honor to God
his maker. He should do sacrylege / and be culpable of all this things
ayenste God. Yet says saint Gregory in his Moralys in the one and therty
chapitre. By abstynence should the vices of the flesh be quenched. Certaynely
yet whenne we put away our enemy we gryue our own flesh. Secondely our
lord shall ask us / if we have corrected our body with the Rod of
dyscyplyne in refraynynge hit from Rebellyon and other vain Iolytees. Sayut
Bernarde says upon the Cantycles. that the dysacustomynge of good works /
must be chastysed and helped by the bytte of discyplyne. He says also in a
Pystle. O how well good disposicyon yeldeth discyplyne to the state of the
body. and the habytaco^n of ye thoughts abateth the sleep of the head. she
ordeyneth the contynuaunce of the vysage. she tempereth the tongue / she
refrayneth the throat / she appeseth the Ire / and dresseth the going Thyrdely
our lord shall ask / if we have labored our body in virtue and in works of
penance. Thereof says saint Austyn in his book of Baptysyng of children That
Adam was chased out of Paradyse terrestre / because yt delycyous place it
should sygnyfye / that labor which is contrary to delight should be showed unto
the tender flesh of the childern. And therefore our bodies may be called a
labory^g best. which our lord has sent us to do and accomplysse the works of
penance. Hold not the body then in yolenesse / in an much as you know not
/ how long hit shall abide with the. But perform the works of penance.
Lest perauenture he asks it again that has lence hit the. Crysostom says.
If you have borrowed an Ox or an Horse / thou will anon set him a work lest
he be asked again of the on the morrow / why wylt not thou semblably do with thy
body. as thou wylt do w* the Horse or Ox. Thus then norysshe dyscretely thy
body / which is lent the by Ihesu Christ in such wise as thy nature may be
sustained / and the vices overcome and thy body corrected by the rod of
discyplyne / so as it may be obedyent and resplendysshyng in Chastyte.
Instruct it to good labors / so that hit chase away all idleness and finally
that thou may yield our lord a good and a Just Rekenyng there of at the
day of Judgment. Thyrdely we must yield rekenyng of our next kynnesmen.
First the fader of the sone. As is written in the first book of Lrynges in the
second chapitre and the third of Hely that was punysshed for his childeren
because he knew they did a mysse / and corrected not their defautes Therefore
is also written in Solomon the nine and twenty chapter. Learn and teache thy
sone. And to the same purpose said A wise man. If thou have a sone / correct
him if he sin. lest by right thou abye not his trespace. Secondely the
Prelate shall give Rekenyng of his subgette or dyocesan. For it is written in
Ezechyell the eght and therty Chapitre. My sone I have set the to be a
beholder and ouerseer of men in the house of Ysrahell. when then thou herest
any of the wordest of my mouth show them on my behalf That is to wit If I
say to a felon. O theff you shall dye an evil death. And if thou show not my
saying to him. to thentent that he may amend him / if he dye in that
wickedness. I shall ask of thy hand his life again. Item the same Ezechyell
says in his.xxxiii. chapter. Behold and see how I am my self above all my
other herdemen. And I shall ask my bestayll of their hondes The lords or
Princes Royal shall yield rekeny^g and accomptes of their subgettis As it
appears in the Book of Nombres in the.xxv. chapitre / where the worldely
Princes are commanded to be hanged on the galowes for the sin of their
people / because the people did fornycacyon with the daughters of Moab which
they called their Sacryfyce. As is read in the said chapitre. Such then be
the Princes and Prelates. As is written in Iheremyas the five and twenty
chapitre. Howl ye herd men and cry strongely / and cast upon you ashes /
for your days be complete / to thentent yt ye be slain and cast in the earth
as precious vessels. Behold then these prelates of the church / and the
princes universal of the Earth. that be constytute above all other. Look how
they govern by example. How they instruct by words. How they defend by deed
the poor people. that arne committed to their governance. Certeynly the
prelates owen to teache their people and defend them wisely from the assawtes
of Heretykes worse and more cursed thanne wolves / and from their cautellys
wylyer thanne foxes. And the temporal Princes owen to do Justice upon
trespassours and defend their good subgettes. And keep wedowes. orphans. and
wretched persons. And not to gryue any body by unrightful exaccyons / or
Iniust causes They may know what is written in the book of Sapyence the.vi.
Chapitre. How there shall be a right hard Judgment to thoos / that been
precellent above all other. Certeynly mercy shall be granted unto the good
poor man. but the badde rich man shall suffer great tourme^te. O ye prelates
of the church / and ye princes of the universal world these words ben
addressed unto you / to thentent ye should learn wisdom and not to fall
therfrom and that ye enstructe govern and defend your subgettes so well that
ye may be sure at the last day of the right hard Judgment. where the
gretest and strongest payns shall be to thoffenders / that have been myghtyest
here. Fourthly it behooved to yield Reckoning of all our wylles and works. And
Anastasye says upon the Symboll. (Quicunque vult saluus esse etc.) How at
the coming of our Lord Ihesu Christ all mankind shall arryse bodily / and
yield Reckoning of their propre works. That is hit that is written by
Thappostle in the second Pystle ad Coryncheos the fyfthe chapitre. where he
says. It behooves that we show us all manyfestely before the Iudycyall sete
of Ihesu Christ to the entente that eueryche resceyue there good or evil
according to their merytes and deserts. It is read in Ecclesiastes in the
last chapitre. Our lord shall bring unto the Judgment all things that be
done And not oonly the great and grievous sins / but also those yt we think
belytyll or none The paas of a man seems but a small thing. Nevertheless it
shall be Rekened for at the fynall day of Judgment. Therefore say the Job in
his.xiii. chapitre. Sire thou have welmarked my ways and my paths / and haste
beholden the Traces of my fete. And after he seyth in the chapitre folowy^g
Thou have nombred al my steps. Item also it is written in Ecclesiasticus in
the seuententh chapitre. His eyes behold Incessauntly all the ways of men. As
to say / he will Reward all that they done according there after. We read in
Vitis patru^. an example of an angel / that sometime nombred all the paaces of
an Heremyte / which paas is a less thing than an idle word. Therefore seythe
Saint Matthew in his.xii. chapitre. That men shall yield Reckoning and Reason
at the day of dome of every Idle word that they have said. It is written in
the book of Sapyence in the first chapitre He that speaks evil and peruersely
shall not mow hyde him at the day of Judgment. And correction shall not
pass besides him. Vain thoughts seems but a little thing. Nevertheless it
is written in the Book of Sapyence in the first chapitre How felonous and evil
thoughts must be answered unto. For he will search all our thoughts. It is
also written in Isaye in the last chapitre. I shall search their works and
their thoughts. and shall come and assemble my self with people That is to
say to deem them as I shall Judge them. Therefore speaks Iohell also in his
third chapitre. I shall assemble all manner of people in the last days / and
shall bring them to the vale of Iosaphat. And there I shall dispute with them
techyng my people / and mine heritage of Israhell. All our thoughts / our
words / and our works shall be then right straytely Iuged. And as Saint
Gregory says upon the Gospel of Saint Matthew the three and twenty chapitre.
All the here is of our hedes be nombred. Semblably God consydereth all our
goynges and stappes. And will that all our vain thoughts and our idle words
shall not rest vndyscussed at the day of Judgment. Certain all our works
shall be then as manyfestely showed unto all people / as though they were
written in our forhedes. As it is written in Ecclesyastyco* in the enleuenth
chapitre At the end of man / all his works and deeds shall be uncovered and
made open. Fyftely it behooves to yield Rekenyng and accomptes not oonly of the
sins that we have done / but also of the virtuous and good dedys that we have
left undone Saint Matthew says in the five and twenty chapitre. Thene shall
the great Lrynge say to thoos on his lift hand Depart from me ye wicked
sinners and go in to the fire everlasting. which is made ready for the deuylles
and their angeles. I have been hungered and ye have not fed me ^^ which one of
the causes why the false rich glotone fond no water to refresshe him with /
was yt he ne would suffer the pouer Lazar to have ye cro^mes that fill from his
table. One shall not Rekenen oonly of things done and forgeten. but also of
time lost in executyng evil things / and left that / that was good undone.
It is written in Ecclesiastes the.xvii. chapitre. That our lord has given man
a nombre of days / and a season to then tent he should use hit well and
holsomly to his pleaser / and their own health / whereof many folks taken none
head / and Improfytably wast their time / whereupon Saint Bernarde complayneth
him to his Scolers saying. There is no thing more precious here than time. But
alas now a days it is most vyly lost. The days of Salvation passen / and
noman hedeth hit. There is none complayneth him of the loss of a day / and
yet it can never be recovered. There shall not be lost an here of an head nor a
moment of a time. but all shall come to a due Rekenyng. O what dread had
Saint Ancelme in his Medytacyons saying. O unprofitable and dry tree. what
shall be thyn answer the day whenne thou shalt be questyoned to give Rekenyng
of all thy work / and account for ye lest twynkelynge of thyn eye and all the
time of life that has been lent the. How thou have dyspended hit. And therefore
says Sapyens in Ecclesiastes the fourth chapitre. My dear beloved sone / keep
and spend well thy time. The sixthe and the last thing that behooves to give
Rekenyng and accomptes for is all the yeftes that we have resceyued of our
lord God. Suerly our lord has given us no thing / but that he will have
thereof both Reason and Reckoning / where by hit seems rather that he has but
lent hit us then given hit us absolutely. Certainly he shall call us to
Rekene. For all his gifts be they spyrytuell as the gifts of grace to the
soul / or temporal as strength delyueraunce / and beauty of the body / or
worldely richesse / power / and worship in this life of all these things. It
appears by Example and by a parabole in the Gospel of saint Matthew in the
five and twenty Chapitre of the five talentes / which be pieces of money / and
of Saint Luke in the nynetenth chapitre* How ye noble man delivered to his
servants certain richesse / whereof they were feign to yield Reason and do
account for every thing thereof pertyculerly As it is written in Job. the.xix.
chapitre. I mow ye that at Judgment all these things before said shall be
rekened for full straytely / wherefore says Job in his.ix. chapitre. what shall
I do whenne our lord shall rise up to Judge all men. And whenne he shall
questyone me / what shall I answer then. O how lyghtely and how soon shall
he come asking a due Reckoning and accomptes of all our works. Our perdycyon
is nyghe / and the time hastes fast and is always coming. That is to say /
whenne our lord shall come and Judge his people. For as says Abdeas in his
oonly chapitre. The day of our lord shall come in the evening at mydnyght.
At Cock crow / or in the morning. As is to say. If he come suddenly / yt
he ne find you slepynge This that I say to you I say it in like wise to all
other. Be ye wakyng then and sleep not. For if ye watch not. I shall come to
you as a thef. and is shall not know whenne ne what hour. It is red in
Apocalypse in the last chapitre. Lo see how I come anon and bring with me
rewards to yield every man after their deserts. Now then^e my right dear
friend / sens yt must nedely of so many things and eueriche of them yield due
rekenyng and acco^pte be not unpurveyed / but make dilygently. examen thyselfe
dilygently / and purge well thy conscience to the bothom. to the intent. that
when our lord shall come to Judge all thing / as well deed as quyke Thou may
couenably and resonably answer / and thereby to have his mercy grace and
pardone of al thy sins. And this is that Ecclesiasticus ammonysshed us in
the.xviii. chapitre saying. Examen thyselfe before the day of Judgment. And
that shall be to thy help in the presence of our lord Ihesu christ.

How the horrible abydyng of the last day and extreme day of Judgment is to be
doubted.

The third chapter of the second part.
THe last thing yt rendret the fynal Judgment to be dredefull and doubtable.
is the terryble sentence that then shall be pronowuced by ye Judgment of god
the rightful Judge This sentence shall be terryble and ferefull / and specyaly
for.iii. things. The first is the doubt and the Incerteynte of the sentence /
for there is noman sure whether it shall be given with him or against him. And
as it is written in Ecclesiastes the ix chapitre. They be Just and wise. and
their works be in ye hondes of god. how be it there is noman here that knows
whether he stand in hate or love / and all things to come. be in none
certain. To this purpose it is read in Vitis patru^. How that an abbot called
Agathon / being in ye article of death And so lyeng by the space of.iii. days
without meuynge or openyng of his eyes. His brethern seeng him so lyeng /
pusshed him / saying unto him. Fader abbot / where art thou. At last he
answered. I am in the presens of all folks / wherefore they said unto him.
then thou dredest and art aferde. Unto whom he answered. Though I have kept
the commandments of our lord as vtuously as to me was possible yet I am a
man / and wot not whether my works be agreeable unto hy^ for the domes of our
lord be all other then the Iugementes of men. and yt is the cause of my dread.
I have neither hope ne wanhope before god. Saint Austyn seyth That. that we
deem to be Justice / well examined before the dyuyne Justice / is often
Iniustyce. And therefore it is written in the Proverbs of Solomon the xiiii
Chapitre. There is one way / which seems Just to a man / but the end
thereof ledeth him to death And for asmoche as this holy fader Agathon
cou^terposyng in his heart all these things a fore said. all be it that he was
right dylygent to keep ye commandments of our lord. Yet always he drad full
sore the last day of Judgment. It is also red in Vitis patru^ how there was
sometime an ancient fader / which said. I dread.iii. things / that is to
say. First when my soul shall depart out of my body. Second when she shall
come before our lord. The.iii. when she shall abide and here the fynal sentence
of ye last day of Judgment. Lo see how many holy faders have drad this last day
of Judgment for ye none certain of the doubtful sentences yt there shall be
given. now certeynly it is a thy^g which of reason ought time rously to be
drad. It is written in the Gospel of saint Matthew ye.vii. chapitre and by the
words of our lord Ihesu christ. Many men shall say to me. Sir sir. have we not
prophesied in thy name. and cast out ye deuels of men and done many virtuous
dedys Then he shall say unto them I know you not nor ever knew you. depart
from. If the prophets and those yt have chased out deuels. and those yt have
done miracles in the name of our lord be so put a back who shall then now be
sure. and who shall conne live here so holyly. but at day of dome he ought to
tremble and fere. Certeynly none / for upon the earth is there no body purely
clean without fylthe not a child of one day old for it is bow in origynal
sin Therefore it is wryte^ in I say the lxiiii. chapitre we be all made as a
foul clothe / and we ought to dread all our works which shall be showed
before us at dome. all though we think them good virtuous and Just. Therefore
say the Job in his ix. chapitre I have drad al my works Se^vlably saint Poule
wiche was a delectable chosyn vessel. all be it he was then full clean in
co^scye^ce in so much he said in the.xxiii. chapitre of Thactes of Apostles.
I have been conversant with our lord with all my might and in good conscience
to this day. And yet it is according where to the same holy Apostle ferefull
wrote in his first Pystle ad Coryntheos the faueth chapitre said. I feel not
myself gylty in any thing / that notwithstondyng I fere yet by cause I am not
Iustyfyed. Saint Gregory said. The Just men diede in all their works / when
they wisely consydre how the must come a fore the high Judge. For as Thappostle
writes unto the Romans the xiiii. chapitre. we shall come all before the
trybunall sete of Ihesu Christ Alas then I wretched sinner what shall I say
or what shall I do* when I shall come before so great a Judge without good
works for my help. The second thing which causes this sentence to be
terryble. Is the hard lamentable and Intolerable vtteraunce of the said
sentence / whenne our lord Ihesu Christ shall say. Go ye fro me ye cursed
people. To that purpose is written in the Gospel of Saint Matthew in the.xxv.
chapitre / whenne the sone of man shall come in his mageste and all his angels
with him. Then^e he shall sytte in the high Iudycyall sete. and all manner of
people shall assemble before him / and shall deuyde ye one from ye other as the
sheparde keeps ye sheep from the wolves. Certeynly he ordeyneth and sets ye
sheep on his right hand / and the wolves on the lift hand And then shall the
king of glory say to thoos that shall be an his right hand. Come ye on with
me that be blessed of my fader / and possess the Royalme of glory / that is
enorned for you from the beginning of the world. I have been hongry. and ye
have fed me etc. Then he shall say to thoos on his lift hand Depart
from me ye yt be cursed / and goo in to eternal fire / which is arredyed for
deuylles. And theruppon says a wise man. The words of the Judge in sentence
are but short / as come ye and go ye. For he shall say to those that be
reproved Go on your way. And to those yt be Just. come ye with me. O how
gracious shall yt word of our lord Ihesus christ be / when he shall say come ye
with me O how hard bitter and in tolerable shall the pronownsyng of yt word be
Depart ye fro me. or go ye from. Suerly Go ye from is a full sharp word
And come ye with me is a full blessed word. Saint Bernarde says O how cruel
shall those words be. Go ye from / to them on the lift hand, spoken by the
king of kings geuer of all life which shall say to other. Come ye with me
This is yt cuttyng swerd with two edges yssewed out of ye mouth of ye sone of
man / as it is written in ye first and xix chapitre of the Apocalypse. Certeynly
he shall then smite the earth with the Rod of this mouth / and shall slay
the felonous sinner by his works. As it is written in I say the.xi. chapitre.
O how terryble a thing shall be to here this voys. Therefore says Saint Austyn
upon the Gospel of Saint Johan. Those that fill backewarde by one word of
Ihesu Christ / whenne he went toward his passion / what shall they do /
when^e they here the voice of the sante Ihesu christ whenne he shall Judge all
the world. for certain he shall braye like a lion. As Amos said in his iii.
chapitre. when^e the lion shall braye / who is he yt then shall not be
aferde. I say in his.v. chapitre says. His brayeng shall be like a lion.
Iheremye also says in his xxv. chapitre. Our lord shall braye from an high
/ and from his tabernacle shall descend his voys / whereof the sown shall
extend unto thextre myte of the earth. and shall make his dome and Judgment
unto ye people. The voys of our lord shall be then in great magnifycens. It
is the voys of our lord yt shall break down the high Cedres of the mou^te of
Lyban. that is to understand. His enmyes proud people enhaunsed And yet all
be it they have been so raised It shall then fail and vanysshe as smoke. And
at that Judgment they shall be made humble / and reduced to no being. This
voys so coming from our lord / shall be like a thundre betyng the earth.
Therefore seyth Job trembling in his five and twenty Chapter. Who shall mow
behold thondre / or sown of the magnytude of our lord. And the Psalter
says. Our lord has thondred from heaven / and the most high has vttred his
voys. Job says in his seven and therty Chapter. Our lord shall thondre
meruelously by his voys / and he does many great things / which ought not
to be enserched nor mused on. And Saint Ancelme says in his Medytacyons /
wherefore slepeste thou slougthefulle soul worthy to be cast out of all
light / he that waketh not nor dredeth not this great thondre slepeth not /
but rather is deed. The word of our lord shall be in manner a right hot
lightenyng / wherefore zacharye in his.ix. Chapter. says. His darte shall
depart like a lyghtenyng And our lord shall sown the trompe Certain as it is
written in Isaye in the seven and twenty chapitre. In that last day shall sown
the great trompe. And therefore says Crysostome upon the Gospel of Saint
Matthew. the four and twenty chapitre. The virtues of heaven shall be moved. now
truly you shall be by a great voys. which is of the terryble trompe / whereunto
all wyndes and elements obeyen / which voys renteth stones and opens hell
/ and breketh the gates of brass and breketh the lygatures of deed bodies and
restores the souls to the bodies ageyn. and co^strayneth them to come to the
great Judgment. And all these things be consumed again more lightly then the
flight of an arow passing in the air / witness of Thappostle yt says in his
first pystle ad Coryntheos in the xv chapitre. In a moment in the twynkelyng of
an eye in the sownyng of the last trompe shall be the Judgment. Of this trompe
speaks Saint Iherome upon the Gospel of Saint Matthew. saying / when and as
often as I think on the last day of Judgment. I tremble for fere / be it when
I ete or when I drink and in any of my works / me thinks always that
terryble trompe sownes in mynere saying. Arise ye arise ye deed folks and come
to your Judgment. All men troubled or grieved ought by penance to think
ofte^tymes in this day and it shall be a great well and ease to their souls.
And therefore says Saint Gregory in an Omely. My right dear brethern and
friends / let ye day of Judgment be always before your eyes. For what grievous
thing so ever ye here / it is but soft in comparyson of that sore day. we
ought also to fere and dread the same day For yt is the great Journey the
Journey of wrath and of bytternesse. Sophony as says in his first chapitre.
The way of our lords Journey shall be full bitter. For there shall be noman
so strong. but then he shall be troubled that shall be the very day of wrath
trybulacion an guysshe chalange myserye and derkenesse of clouds and storms
of the sown of the trompe. Isaye in his xiii chapitre says The day of our
lord shall come / which shall be full of Indygnacyon ^^ath and of furour.
Iohel also in his.iii. chapitre says. The son shall be converted in to
derkenes and the moon in to blood a fore the coming of ye great and horrible
day of our lord. O how drad Saint Bernard that same day when^e he said / whiles
I yt am a mortal man remember what I shall be after my death The fere there of
puts me in terryble doubts. for I am not verrely assured of yt / that I
long after. for the day of fere / of wrath / of Ire / and of furour. the day
of waylyng and the vengyng of sinners / affrayeth me hydeously. Of this same
day says he also in one of his sermons / they shall be all bare and naked
before the trybunall sete of Ihesu christ to thentent yt they may here ye ^oys
of his Judgment. Be cause they have stopped here eres from ye weyes of good
cou^seyl. Now what seyth our lord god. Do ye penance / nevertheless there be
many yt disymylyngly close their eres and will not here hit / and think it is
to hard to do. O remember ye felons because of your obstynacy / ye shall here
therefore the hard and lamentable word pronounced unto you. That is to seye.
Go ye cursed people in to everlasting fire* what shall then those poor
wretched perpetuell dampened people say. Seenge the holy blessed people called
up Ioyefully in to the eternal glory and bliss of heaven. And they that be
dampened in to the Iufynyte pains of hell. Certeynly as it is written in the
book of Sapyence ye.v. chapitre They shall wepyngly say in themself for the
great anguysshe of their souls. Let us do penance / for we be thoos yt have
blasphemed hit / and as foles out of all wit and reason had in derysion the
living of the penyte^t folks / thynkyng it was no worshipful life How be it
we see them now taken and accepted with the sone of god / and their works
allowed and cherysshed so yt they be accompanied with the happy and blessed
saints / and we with ye dampened fendes of hell We have erred from the way of
troth / the light of Justice has not shyned in us / nor the son of
rightwysnesse risen in us. we have left ye ways of our lord Ihesu christ and
have gone dangerous and evil ways / yt is to say The ways of Iniquyte and
perdycion / what has our great pride proufyted or auayled us. or what auantage
have we had of all our great richesse / par de all is paste as a bird fleyng
in the sky / or a ship glydyng thorugh the water. whereof the traces can not
be apperseyued. Now then to make confession is over late for their
repentance grows but for the pain yt they suffer. And therefore they can
obtain no pardon / also they are past ye place of mercy and grace. and be in
the place of equity and Justice. For when^e the Judge / which ought so
gretely to be doubted has pronounced his Judgment and sentence / saying. Go
fro me ye wicked. and Come to me ye blessed / their Remedy is paste. To this
purpose read we in ^itis patru^. How there was some time an holy man / which
was tempted with the spiryt of for nycacyon / and he besought our lord yt his
enemy the fend which tempted him might appear visibly unto him. and so he
did. Thene the said holyman seyde unto the fend / what avails the thus for
to tempte the people / parde it is a great folly. for whe^ne ye have brought any
to sin thy trespass is the gretter / and consequently ye augmentest thine own
pain To whom the fend answered. Certeynly all yt is true / but I know well
the mo folks yt cause to sin / the more I defer the coming of the day of
dome. I dread that day above all things / and the heryng then of that
hard sentence. Goo ye wicked and cursed in to eternal fire / which is made
ready to the devil and his angellys. And therefore I do my power to prolonge
the time of coming of ye sentence. O good lord what cause of dread have these
fendes and these unhappy sinners then. If thou wylt be assured in this
horrible and dredefull Journey. Sow now in thy life the works of Mercy Pity
and Justice. O how blessed and how happy shall he be / that now entendeth to
the poor languysshyng nedy people. For in yt hard Journey our lord will
delyuere them therefore from all dau^gere. It is written in the Prouerbys of
Solomon in the.xi. chapitre. The merciful man does great good unto his soul
/ and does also the digne fruytes of penance For they yt now sow teres and
lamentaco^ns the reward thereof shall come and bring them in to the lodgyng of
Joy and of gladness. But there be many yt sown now presentely thorns and
cokyll / wenynge to repe and Inn good whete / but ywys foles it will not be
so. For as Thappostle says ad Galathas in the.vi. chapter. Such as a man
has sown here / such shall he repe then^e for himself. And therefore says
our lord by his prophet. Ozee in his.x. chapitre / ye have sown felony and
have reped iniquyte and he that has sown sin and evil works / he shall be
repen and Joined in to the pains of hell. But he yt has sown virtues and
the good works of penance He shall repe and gadre the everlasting glory. And
all that have done well shall rest in the Joys of heaven. And those that have
done sin and wickedness shall go and rest in the pains of hell. Certainly
their works folowen them. As it is written in the Apocalypse the.xx. Chapter.
After their works men shall be both saved and dampened. It is read in the
Gospel of Saint Johan the fyfth Chapter. An hour shall come to the which
all that be in Monumentes or Tombs shall here the voys of our lord. And they
that have done well / shall go in the Resurreccion of life. And they that have
done wyckedly / shall go unto the Judgment of death. It is written in the
second Chapitre of the Apocalypse how the Judge shall say. I am he that
ensercheth the hertes of persons and shall give to every of you his Reward
after his works. And as says Abdeas. It shall be done unto the / as thou have
done To the same purpose is written in Iheremye the.l. chapitre. And these be
the words of the eternal Judge unto the evil angel spekyng of the dampened
sinners / yield and do him after his dedys and works. And therefore if thou
wylt have a good heruest and habun dance of fruit / sow good works largely
in the time of this present life. For he that sows them now largely / shall
gadre them then habundantly. And he that now sows them sparyngly / shall then
gad them scarsely / and he yt sows them with blyssynges* shall gadre them
with great Joy and gladness. As it is written in the second Epistle ad
Coryntheos in the ix. chapitre For he that sows his sedys in syn^e and
maledycco^ns / semblably shall Inn and gadre them And as it is written in a
Proverb. The sede that man sowes in this present life / shall be his house when^e
the Judge shall say Come ye and go ye. The third thing. why the dome of the Judge
shall be terryble. It is to be remember how dampened souls shall be by the
morning sentence. full of all sorrow eternally separated and departed from god
and his saints of paradyse / and put on the lift hand unto the tendes of
hell. Certeynly Incontynente and without caryeng that this horrible sentence
shall be pronounced by ye mouth of Ihesu christ. The perpetuell deuylles shall
be there arredyed and ready for to take and rauayne the souls of the wretched
sy^ners / which they shall lyghtely bring unto everlasting tourmentes and
pains. This may appear unto us by a figure in the book of Hester the.vii.
Chapitre of the mynystres of king Assuer / which were desirous and ready to
take Amon as it is contained in the same Chapitre. How the word was not all
out of the mouth of the said king. But that the mynystres had covered the
vysage of the same Amon. In like wise the deuylles in this hydeous Journey
shall be more then ready to resceyue ye souls of these wretched sinners. And
this is written in the Lamentacions of Iheremye in the first Chapitre. All his
persecutees have taken him. Johan Crysostom says in the book of Repayryng of
forfaytours. Remember these cruel and terryble tourmentoures that never may
show mercy on any body and ledeth down the unhappy sinners unto everlasting
tourmentes. And Hugho of Saint Vyctour. says. That the horrible mynystres of
hell shall be apparayled and arredyed incontinent as the sentence is given /
to take the condemned unto tourmentes. And then ye wretched unhappy
caytyffes lamentably shall say. they have caught me like as a deuoryng lion
lurky^gly has taken his pray. O what sorrow and pain / whereof may not be
esteemed in man's my^de nor by tellyng pronounced / wherefore saint Bernarde
says in his Medytacyons / what thynkest thou / what weeping / what waylynge /
and what sorrow shall be whenne the sinners shall be expulsed out of the
company of Just men / and put from the sight of God and delivered and cast
unto the hondes of the deuylles to go with them in to everlasting fire / and
utterly banysshed from all the Joys of heaven / to abide in the derknesse
there suffryng payns for their demerytes after the quantyte of their sins.
And then^e the miserable sinners being in despeyre of the Redemption shall
enter into the lowest parties of the earth in the ho^des of our lords glayue
there to remayn with out seeng of any light. Of this pain of separacyon or
departing says also Crysostome. Some foles wene and think to have their
wysshynge if they may escape the gehenne of hell. But as to me I say that
there be other tourmentes much more grievous. that is to say to be estrau^ged
and cast away from the grace of the soueraygne glory / and I deem that the
banysshyng there from is the most egre and grievous torment. whereupon says
saint Gregory He is gretely tormented yt is constrained to be put a part from
the presens of our lord. And I deem yt it is the most grievous thing yt may be
/ and passes all ye gehe^nes of hell. The same saint Gregory says of this
word of the Gospel of Saint Matthew the xvi. chapitre. He shall be cut and
sent in to the eternal fire. Certeynly ye gehe^ne of hell is a thing
intolerable and none can co^prehende how intolerable it is. Nevertheless if
there were a.M. gehennes in hell / there is none so lamentable pain as to be
exempt from the honor of the blessed glory of heaven. and to be hated of our
redemer Ihesu christ maker of all things For as saint Austyn seith The wicked
reproved shall lever sustene all the torments of hell / then to behold the
rightful Iuges face angered with them. Iohell says in his second chapitre.
The earth has trembled for his face and moeuynge of his eyes / the son and
the moon have derked / ye sterres have withdrawn their shynyng. the people
have been tormented beholding his vysage. Certeynly sy^ners shall then^e
perysshe before his face / thorugh the great sorrow they shall have of them
self. And when they shall see him coming his vysage from them* it shall meue
them to myserably. And then^e the Judge egrely shall say as is written in
Iheremie the.xviii. chapitre. In the day of their perdycyon I shall show them
my back / and not my face. O what shall be ye separaco^n O how bitter and
sorrowful shall it be to the sinner to depart fro the face of our lord /
when^e he shall horrybly say. I tell you I know you not / and therefore seyth a
wise man The departing of frendis is right sorrowful. but the separaco^n of the
body and the soul from the presens of the deyte / is the most sorrowful
thing. For all this things a fore said and many other. which infynytly might
be rehearsed / for breefnesse of time I pass them over. But yet awake ye awake
ye my dear frendis and lift up your hedes. abhortyng and feryng ye tymerous
and dreadful day of Judgment. For as Sophonyas in his first chapitre says. The
day of our lord approaches nyghe and shall not tarry. It is written in Isaye in
the.xiii. chapitre. Sorrow ye and cry / for the day of our lord is nyghe.
Sleep not then^e. For ye know not the day ne the hour. as it is written in the
Gospel of Saint Mathewe the xxv. chapitre. It is also written unto the
Tessalonyes in the last chapitre of ye first Pystle. My brethern ye knew well
yt the day of our lord shall come by night as a thef. and whenne men shall
think themself assuredly in peace. He shall come suddenly and take them in a
mortal defaulte / wherefore my brethern Rest not in the syn^e of wretchedness.
Leest that day suppryse you not suddenly as a thef. Surely we be all the
children of day and the sons of light. Then let us not sleep as other do.
But let us awake and be sobre as it is written in ye same chapitre. It is written
in the Gospel of Saint Luke in the.xxi. chapitre. Give attendaunce in your
self. Leest perauenture your hertes be fulfilled with gloteny and dronkenship
and in other vain works of this present life. And lest yt the foresaid
dangerous day fall not suddenly unto you. which shall fall universally to all
thoos yt shall be upon the earth. Be ye then^e in your prayers. so yt at al
times ye may be the more dygue and able to flee all the dangers that be to come
whenne yt shall be before the sone of man? As it is written in the same chapitre
for a troth. There shall be then tremblyng fere and sorrow intolerable And
therefore said Iohell in his second chapitre Our lords day shall be great
and right terryble. And who shall be he yt shall mow sustene or suffer it.
Isaye says also in his second chapitre. They shall enter in to the cauernes
among stones and hydplaces of the earth for dread of our lords face and of
the glory of his mageste whenne he shall arise to smite and punysshe the earth.
And as it is read in Abacuk in the.iii. chapitre In his ^^^snes he shall trede
down the earth / and the people shall be abashed of his furour. Isaye in
his.x. chapitre says / what shall ye do in that day of vysytacyon and of
calamyte coming from terre parties / to whom shall ye run to have so ^our
and help. Certeynly the syn^er shall have then no refuge solace nor socours.
And therefore said Ancelme in his book of Medytaco^ns. On ye right hand shall
sins be accusyng the wretched sinner On the lift hand infynyte no^bre of
deuels. underneath the co^fusyon of hell / which is greatly to be doubted /
and over this the presens of the wrothfull Judge / and without all the world
bre^nyng / and within this the conscience glowyng. This ought to be remembered.
Alas the miserable sinners taken in ye trappe. whether shall they flee. It shall
be then^e Impossyble to hyde them. It shall be an Intolerable oredefull thing
to appear in that day. The said sentence is mure ferefull and dangerous / be
cause it Iuged not oonly the body / but also it condempneth the soul. To yt
purpose is there red an example / how that there was sometime.ii. brethren /
whereof the one was a fool and ignorant / and the other was wise / which went
togydres in a way. and as they walked / they come at last to a forked way.
which led to sundry places / whereof the one was fair and pleasant. and the
other sharp and no thing inhabyted And when^e the fool saw the fair and
delectable way he said. Brother goo we this way. Then the wise brother
answered. I know well that this way which thou will led us is fayer and
delectable. but netheles in the end it will being us to an right evil lodgyng.
And therefore I counsel yt we take the other way. For all be hit yt it be
sherpe and not inhabited / finally it will bring us to right a good and honest
harberoughe and full of rest / where unto the fool answered. I will rather
trust myneye in yt I see / than thyn in that you see not. And so set him
forth in the soft and delectable way which thing the wise brother seeng
that he could not make him relynquysshe his purpose / followed him And whenne
they had gone together a little space / they fortuned anon to be taken with
soldeyours / which dysceuered them and put them in to diverse prysones. Now
hit happened that the king of ye country commanded on a day / that all
prisoners should be brought before him yt he might Judge them according to
their demerytes. And whenne these two brethern came before him / and echone
knew other / the wise brother said. O sir king and our Judge. I complain me
greatly of this man my brother / for as we went togydies in a way he being
reputed a fool and I wise. yet nevertheless. he would not believe me no: goo
after me the good way that I taught him but has made me to follow him in ye
evil way wherein we were taken / and so he is gylty of my death. And to the
corntarye the ignorant fool said to the same king. Sir I have gretter cause and
strenger Reason to complain me against my brother / for where he ought not to
have byleued me nor followed me lightly in ye way / which he knew well was
evil and dangerous. for and he would not a followed me. I would have returned
ageyn and followed him / whereby I should in no wise have fallen in his
daungere / and therefore he is verrey gylty of my death. when^e these words were
had on either party. The king pronownsed and gave a sentence saying Thou
fool / thou would not trust thy wise brother / and thou wise haste followed
this fool in his evil ways / wherefore ye both shall be hanged and condemned
to death. Semblably shall it be at the day of Judgment in the consu^maco^n of
this world. when by ye almighty power of god the soul of every man and woman
shall return ageyn and be reioyned to the yr own bodies appery^g before the
high Judge to resceyue dome and Judgment of all things known and forgoten.
for ye folysshe body because it would not follow ye counsel of ye wise soul /
and the wise spyryte because it would not resyste but ensue the folysshe body.
they shall be both dampened together in the last extremyte of Judgment. For this
cause the sentence of the Judge is called a sword with two edges. as is written
in. thapocalips in the first chapitre. For it shall stryke the wretched sinner
both in body and soul It is written in the Gosspell of saint Matthew in the.x.
chapitre. Dread hy^ yt shall mow lose and pu^ (...) the ye body and soul in
(...) gehe^ne of hell The qualyte of the said Judge yeldeth and shows the
said sentence to be dredefull and dangerous Certey^ly it shall be pronounced
by a circu^specte and a right prudent Judge which shall never fail. for every
thing is notarily to hy^ known. for god knows the hid thyngis of the heart
and sercheth the works of men. wherefore it is written ad Hebreos in the.iiii.
chapitre. All thy^gis be open to his eyes for he looks into the hertes. As it
is red in ye first book of Lrynges in ye xvi chapitre. Also it is red in
Ecclesiastes the xxiii. chapitre The eyes of our lord be much clerer then^e
the son. for they behold all the ways of man / and the profou^de depnesse
and the hertes of men / and see all the hid things of the earth. And as
Boece de consolacde says. Great curyosyte to do well is introducte un(...)
because all yt we do is done before him yt sees all things. Iheremy seith in
his xxii chapitre. Thyn eyes be open upon all the ways of the childern of
Israel and I shall yield to eueryche of them after his ways and after the
fruit of his admynystracions. Certeynly the Judge is gretely to be drad. which
looks upon al things both open and shette / and all secret thyngis to him
known / all derke things to him is clear / all dome things answer unto him
/ and all thoughts speak to him without voys and al sylences confess them
unto him This sentence is to be given by the Just Judge / which will not
be^owed / and he shall Judge all the circuyte of the earth. and the people in
equity* He grutcheth not attethe might of any body / nor he excepteth no
person what soever they be / nor he ne will be appeased then by any gifts. It
is written in Deutronomii in the.x. chapitre God is great mighty and terryble.
which will favor no person nor he resceyueth no gifts. Certainly a pure and
a clean conscience then shall be more worth. then the purses full of silver. The
habondau^ce of richesse shall not proufyte then / nor any thing yt longs to
rich people. But oonly shall proufyte the works of Pity and of Justice. It is
written in Ezechiell in the.vii. chapitre. Their money shall be then their
dou^ghylle / neither their gold nor their silver shall mow deliver them in ye
day of furour of our lord. Then^e shall appear ye fraud and the falshed* of
this world. and vileness of all richesse. O how sweet a thing and how great a
Joy shall it be then^e to those yt have hated this world. and how sorrowful
and bitter shall it be unto them yt have had it in lust and delectaco^n. This
sentence is also to be given by the Judge yt will not be corrupt then by prayers
nor appeased by desires. And as it is written in the Prouerbys of Solomon in
the.vi. chapitre. He will not obtempre then nor bow to oni requestis what
soever they be. Crysostom says the angeles will not then intercede nor pray for
the men / for the Just Judge will show there no mysery cord. but will yield to
eueryche after his meryt and the merytes egally not bowyng Justice / and
therefore says he by his prophet Ezechiel in the vii. chapitre. I shall do the
right after thy ways and shall Judge the after thy Iugeme^t^ and I shall make
the know yt I am thy lord. For yt cause said Job all dredefully. I resyne
all my works knowing the / yt ne wylt spare any thing the delynquentes or
trespassours. of all these things speaks Saint Bernarde in a pse which he
made saying. Certainly our lord shall Judge Justly and shall except no person
nor shall be corrupt by any pryse nor gifts Semblably he shall not bow for
any manner of prayer O my right dear friend labor then dylyge^tly to bear
Justice thither as you shall find no mysery cord. For as it is written in the
Prouerbys of Salomo^ The riches shall not proufyte in the day of vengeance /
but Justice shall cause then delyuerance from death And if the scolers yt can
not their lesso^s dread greatly to be examyned of their master. lest they
should be egrely punysshed. how much should the sinners dread then thextremye
examynynge of the sovereign Judge / when they have not studied in the book of
Justice and of troth. Certeynly in ye apposayle is examyned all things yt now
be naught / the unjust sinners shall be punysshed / and the seed of felons
shall perish. and to the contrary the Just people shall be then in the
eternal memory and shall not dread in any wise any euyil accusacyon. It is
written in Ecclesyastyco the.xviii. chapitre. Make ready Justice before the
Judgment This fynall sentence shall be also given by a Judge cruelly moved which
in no wise shall mow be appeased. For our lord Ihesu Christ that naturally
is now amyable and meke as a lamb shall appear th^nne as a lion right cruel
and gretely moved. And therefore said Ozee in his.xiii. chapitre It may well be
the words of our lord by the covetous glotons and proud people at the day of
Judgment / saying thus. they have fulfilled them self in their pastures and
arreysed up their hertes. and forgeten me. I will be to them as a lioness and
as a leoparde in the way of assy^yence. I shall come against them as a she bear
/ which has lost her whelps / and shall break their Iugementis within and
shall destroy them like a lion. How might one remember a more cruel thing then
by thoos beestes. Our lord shall say to the felons yt shall be conda^pned / as
is written in Ezechiell in the.vii. chapitre. The conclusyon is come / and now
comes the end upon the / and I shall send my furour in to yt Certeynly sir
as the fire brennes the forestes and the mystes break upon the molyteynes.
Semblably in that tempeste you shalt then persecute thy syn^ers and trouble
them in thine Ire. And then thy wrath shall be chased like fire and shall
abasshe the people in thyn anger. It is written in Isaye in the xxx. chapitre.
The name of our lord shall come from right far / his fersenesse shall be
brennyng and grievous to bear / his lyppes shall be fulfilled with Iudygnacyon /
and his tongue shall be like a deuouryng fire / and his spyryte shall be like a
broke rennyng over the bry^kes for to destroy people and to bring them to no
thing. Job took sometime this furour in a vysyon whenne he said / who shall be
that living man yt shall do so mykell with the that thou wylt defend me from
hell and hyde me till thy furour be paste. Certeynly the furour of the Judge
shall be so great then / that it can not be expressed by any words nor
thought by any corages Derely all the Iugementes and sentences that have been
against and upon the humayne lynage since the beginning of the world. be but
like a lityll fla^me or a spark in regard to the furour of Ihesu Christ /
which he shall excercyse in the last day of Judgment. And how straytely
shall he that is risen debonayr and past up in to heaven return to do
Judgment and therefore says saint Gregory in an Omely. upon the word of saint
Johan euangelyst yt saint Thomas one of ye xii. apostles called Dydymus which
is to say long doubtyng said thus. My brethern and friends order your life
your werkis and your condycyons / and puruey / for he that is risen meke and
amyable shall come hard and stray^e at the day of Iugemet Certeynly at that
day of examynacyon / which is so gretely to be doubted / he shall show
himself clearly among angeles and archangeles and among the trones and
domynacions / among the pryncypals and potestates / and all the skies shall be
moved / and the earth and the other elementis in the fere and dread of his
service. Set then before your eyes this Judge yt is cause of so great
abassheme^t. and fere and dread him both now and herafter. To thentent that
wheu^e he shall come / ye shall not see hy^ in fere. but be well assured he
ought to be dred now to the end that he should not be doubted then. Certeynly
if one of you had to say or allege a cause ageyn your enmye and should to
morrow present you to my Judgment perauenture ye will pass all the night
without great sleep / remembryng your self in great pain and thought what
things might be alleged against you / and what ye would answer to thobieccyons
/ and should dread gretely leest I should be sharp unto you. and would fere
lest it should* be thought that ye were culpable / and would search what I
where. and whether I should become Certeynly not long after I have be man. I
shall become worms / and after worms powdre Now then if the Judgment of him
that is but powder is to be drad and had in so great fere. By what entencyon
is it to be thought that fere must be most dredefull / which is of the
Judgment of the most grettest and highest mageste. All these things said
saint Gregory in the chapitre aforsayd. Yet is there sum thing more
concerning the said sentence / that is to wit / that there is no puyssaunce
can resyste it. And as it is written in the book of Sapyence in the.xi.
chapitre. who shall be he that shall resyste the virtue of thine arm. Isaye also
said in his xlvii chapitre. I shall take vengeance on them. and no man shall
resyste me. Verily none shall mow resyste hit / but edely all must appear
there generally if they will or not. they shall abide before the angels the
sentence of the sovereign Judge / which spoke by Isaye. him self in the said
chapitre to the sinners that are to be condampned. and thus thy shame shall be
known and the vylen reproach shall be seen / wheruppon I will take vengeance
and shall no man mow resyste hit. Job said in his.ix. chapitre. God is he
that in his wrath no man may resyste. And as it is written in the book of
Hester the.xiii. chapitre. Fair lord god king omnypotent all things be set
under thy Iurysdyccyon. and is none that may resyste thy will. Certain yt haste
made the sky the earth and all that is contained in the circuyte of the world
/ thou art lord of all things / and is none that may resyste thy will This is
the great mighty and puyssaunt lord / of whose gretnesse and might there is no
nombre nor end and he shall dread none be they never so mighty. It is written
in the book of Sapience in the vi chapitre. Our lord shall dread no body what
so ever he be / for he has made both great and small. It is red in the
Apocalypse. in the.vi. chapitre. Our lord shall not dread the gretenesse of man
what so ever he be. The kings of the earth / the princes of the world / the
trybunes. the rich. the strong / and all men as well bond as fre. shall hyde
them in the caves and among stones of the roches. saying to the mounteynes /
fall upon us / and hyde us from the face of him that sytteth in the trone /
and the wrath of the lamb / for the great day of Ire is come. It is read in
the same Apocalypse in ye xviii chapitre. The kings of the earth shall weep /
and they shall specially complain that have made fornycacyon with Babylon and
have lived in delectacyons / when^e they shall see the smoke of his embrasynges
and shall will them to be far for fere of the tourmentes. Certain as saint
Mathewe says in his.xxii. chapitre. There shall be then great trybulaco^n /
and so great. that sythens the beginning of the world till now was there never
none like. Secondly there is another thing that agrogeth ye said sentence That
is to say. that there is no place there for sy^ners to hyde them in / and as
Saint Ancelme said It shall be then a thing impossible one to hide hy^ And
therefore he says in his.xxiiii. chapitre. There shall no tenebres be there nor
no shadow of death that they may hyde those that have done iniquyte. Saint
Bernard said in one of his sermons. That before the Judicial chere of Ihesu
christ shall they stand all naked / yt have stopped their eres to the voys of
counseyll / wherefore they shall here the voys of the Judgment as it is before
alleged. My right dear brother and friend dread this day and doubt cordyally
the said Judge and lord that shall deem all things / to the intent that you
may the more dylygently eschew all sins. And it is red in an other place.
That in dredyng our lord it withdraws every man from evil doing. There is
yet an other thing which agrogith this sentence. there is no place to apele
to any other / nor space for to flee To that purpose seyth the Psalter whether
shall I goo bakwarde from thy spiryt. and how shall I flee bakwarde from thy
face / if I mount up in to the sky / you art there. if I descend in to hell
you art present there besides me. and therefore says our lord of sinners by
Amos in the xix. chapitre. They shall flee and there shall be none saved of
them / if they descend in to hell / my hand shall pull them up from thens /
and if they hyde them in the mou^teyne of Carmele. I shall seek them till I have
put them thens. And if they hyde them in the botom of the sea. I shall send a
dragon which shall devour them And if they go in to seruage among their
enmyes. I shall send a sword which shall slay them and shall cast mine eye
upon them in wrath and not in love. Job says in his x. chapitre. Our lord
ought to Judge all thyngis and is none that may escape his hondes. Certeyly I
see clearly the hand of our lord almighty will find us over all. And
therefore says the Auctour of the chare of the soul / what will thou rich
man do / that never shall live surely. whether shalt thou retraye the /
whether wylt thou torn thy body / for you art not sure here nor else where
fore and thou stye up in to the sky / or descend in to hell / he that has
domynaco^n is ye cruel and mighty king. If thou go in to the sea / that king
has governance there / thou shall not mow then goo no part surely / for
thou shall be found every where. Certeynly you shall have no place to flee to
/ another in thy death / nor in thy life. O how well comprehended this Elezearus
that said I will neither flee quyk nor deed from ye hondes of the almighty. As
it is written in ye second book of Machabe the.vii. chapitre. Lo by these our
lords sayenges it appears in many manners that fynall Judgment is to be
redoubted of all / and shall be for thaccusaco^n of diverse things / which
must be vyolently suffered sustened and born. and for the Just Reason that must
needs be yelden syngulerly and generally of all things. And for ye diffynytyf
sentence that shall be then^e pronounced right horrybly by the Just Judge. The
remembrance then of these things dilygently continued / that is to say of
the fynal Judgment and of the sentence that shall be given there / as it is
said shall p^serue and defend and not without reason every man from falling in
to sin / and eschew to do evil to the end. to come finally to the glory
with the happy saints of paradyse.

And thus ends the second part of this treatise divided in four parties.
Here begins the prologue of the third part of the four last things to
come.
THe third of the four last things whereof the remembrance preserves from
syn^e is hell or the infernal gehenne. And therefore says Anastasye of saint
Anthony the heremyte. when^e the devil tempted him to any sin / he remembered
the pains of hell due unto sinners* wiche thought was so enprynted in his
heart yt finally he thereby vaynquysshed the devil and was delivered from his
temptacyons and rested free from all sin. It is to be noted how touching
this matter present three things are pryncypally to be considered. First the
diverse nomynacyon of the paynfull places of hell. Secondely the many fold
afflyccions of thinfernall mynystres. Thirdely the strange and diverse manners
of the torments of hell of the which.iii. things the remembrance
proufyteth gretely and withdraws a man from falling to sin.

How hell is named by holy scripture in diverse wise.

The first chapitre of the third part princypal
IT is now first to be Declared pryncypally the nomynacyon of the paynefull
places of hell / wherefore it is to be known that hell is a place full of
fire and is so called de Infero infers. That is to say to bear in / for the
souls of sinners be borne in to it for to suffer pain there eternally And
therefore says Job in his seuenthe chapitre. He that shall descend in to hell
shall not come again ne ever return unto his house. And also hell is
oftentimes called gehenne of fire. The foresaid saint Gregory in his fourth
book of his dyalogys said. Certeynly it must be byleued that there is oonly
but one fire in the gehenne of hell / but it tormenteth not all sinners after
one manner / for every man shall have pain after the quantyte of his gylte and
trespace. Isydorus in the book of sovereign goodness says that the fire of
the gehe^ne of hell shall shine and light to the dampened folks in encreasyng
of their pains to thentent that they may see their own sorrows. it shall
neither light nor shine to their consolaco^n nor give them cause of any
reioysyng. The pain of thoos yt be dampened is doubled by sorrow and pains that
torme^teth the soul and fire that brenneth the body. Of this fire of hell
speaks ye Psalter saying. The coals shall fall upon sinners which shall be
cast in to the fire having no conforte in their myseryes / our lord shall
tormmente them with his Ire and the fire shall devour them. wherefore it is
written in Isaye in the.ix. chapitre The people shall be as mete unto the fire /
it is also said to every sinner in Ezechyell in the.xxi. chapitre. Thou shall
be fyres mete. In Iheremy the.xv. chapitre seyth our lord to the dampened
folks. thenbrasyng fire inferyour shall broyll and brenne upon you all. this
fire is of that nature yt perpetually it shall bren^e and shall never have need
to be renewed. It is written in Job the.xx. chapitre. The fire which can never
be quenched shall utterly devour them O how sore shall our lord venge him
then upon the dampened sinners. As it is said in Ecclesiastico in the.vii.
chapitre. The flesh of sinners shall have vengeance by fire. This fire of the
gehenne of hell is differente from the materyall fire pryncypally in iii.
things First in fyrsnesse and egrenesse for the power of hit in brennynge is
Infynyte / wherefore says saint Sebastyane whenne the angel of heaven rowned
him in the ere / he said that our sensyble fire is no more like the fire of
hell / then the fire peynted upon a wall is like our materiale fire. Secondely
in enduryng. For our materyale fire may be quenched and so may not that. It is
written in Isay in the last chapitre / that the fire for sinners shall not be
quenched. Thyrdly in wastyng. for our sensyble materyall fire may consume and
wast all things as ye philosophre seith but ye fire infernal may not wast nor
consume neither the body nor the souls of syn^ers by brennynge. Job says in
his.xx. chapitre of the sinners being in hell. He shall bye full dear now that
he has done and yet he shall not be wasted. Johan crysostom seyth also that
our materyall fire consumes all thing that is leyed in hit / but the fire of
hell tourmenteth contynuelly thoos that be therein / and yet it preserves them
always in lengthynge their pains. Therefore it is said that it is not to be
quenched not oonly because it can not be put out but that it shall not sease to
destroy them yt shall come therein. For ye cause says the holy scripture that
the sinner shall be clothed with corrupcyon not oonly of their life but in
languysshyng and torments always coming. Certainly no voice could expowne nor
no word could express the gretenes of the pain. nor the feruentnes of that
fire. Alas what shall we do therefore there. and what shall we answer / for in
hell shall be but gryndyng of tethe / yowlyng. cryeng. and weeping in pain /
but then penance is to late / and from all parts shall comfort and help
be put away / there shall be no thing but augmencacyons of pains. as that
fire of hell is not of nature to druoure / no more is it to give no
comfortable light. It is an obscure fire / and the flamme thereof tenebrous.
Secondely hell is called locus inquietus. that is to say a restles place ever
enduryng and shall never have end / wherefore it is said in this life that
there is one place which is always still / that is to wit the center of the
sky. Other be sometime troubled as mean parts of ye air / semblably it may
be proved that the lowest part is always in trouble without rest And therefore
it is called tartarus. For after Papy tartarus is as mykell to say as troubled
and obscure Certainly the unrest and trybulaco^n comes there specially of
three things. First the varyaunce of pains as one says / the weder is
troubled / when it is now meddled with reyn. now with hayll. now with snow. or
such storm which as it is said / be of all those manners in hell as
wytenessen prophets saying. It shall rayn upon sinners both fire and
brymstone. and the spyrytes of tempest shall give them part of their
tourmentes. Secondly of the mynystres infernal. As it is written in Iheremye
the.xvi. chapitre. Those deuylles that ye have served / nether night nor day
shall suffer you in rest. Thirdely thenter changed cry. as it is written in
Isaye the.lxv. chapitre. ye shall weep for sorrow and by contrycyon of soul
howl. In truth our lord shall answer to all those yt so shall howl and
cry. As it is said in Iheremye the.xxx. chapitre. Wherefore cryest thou and
howlest thou now by contrycyon sithe thy sorrow is not to be heled. I have
punysshed the thus for thy wicked felonous sins. Thirdely hell is called a
place right distempred. As Auernus. That is as mykell to say as a thing
without a temperau^ce of delight for the pains be no thing moderated there /
but continue in great excess / of troth there is therein without mesure
excessesyue tenebres / which be called exteriores. as saint Mathewe says in
his.xxii. Chapitre. we have example of this in Exodo in the.x. chapitre. By the
manyable tenebres that were sometime in Egypt. O how mykell shall the tenebres
of hell be more grievous than those. It is written in Job in the.xx. chapitre.
All horrible tenebres shall come on him. Again then shall the ^^^ners say. As
it is said in the Psalter. They have cast me in to the lowest lake and in the
tenebrous place and in the shadow of death / they have lodged me in the
obscure place as deed fro this world / wherefore my soul is angry with me.
Semblably it is written in the Lame^tacyons of Iheremye. They have lodged me
with thoos that be sempyternally deed / there is therein an excessyfe hete. As
Job says in his xiiii. chapitre. The hete is great therein, and the cause is
that it breketh not out but is closed in / as the hete in an oven. The Psalter
says. Whenne thou art an angered thou shalt put the sinners in an oven full of
fire. Also our lord shall torment them with his wrath / and fire shall devour
them / there is there also a right sharp cold. As is written in Job in the
said chapitre. It is said the water of snow is colder then all other waters
/ Yet the waters of hell may not be compared with of chyllyng nor cold. And
therefore seyth full gen^yus in his Pystles. There is in hell.ii. pryncypall
manner of torments / that is to wit by in tolerable cold and by
inquencheable hete. It is written in the xxiiii chapitre of Saint Matthew There
shall be in hell both weeping and cold certeynly the efflucco^n of teeris by
weeping comes of hete / but the inward sorrows is caused by cold. To this
purpose witnesses Job in the said xxiiii. chapitre. The sinner ouerpassed
with the cold water of snow / gothe after in to the great fyry hetes. It is
found also in a little book of the deeds of Alexander the king of Macedone.
That when^e he was for clommed with the Isse and with the cold of the snow he
would goo to the fire of colys. O how miserable and paynful shall this trouble
be to thoos that shall not dye nor have lightnyng in that piyson of hell / but
be tourmented there Infynyt^ly Fourthely hell is called a noyfull waylyng
place and therefore after Papie it is named Acheron / yt is as mykell to say as
a place without Joy lackyng all goodness. For this cause says the Comentator
Aueroys in the iiii. chapitre of Poetrye. That hell has a contynuell sorrow
and weeping without consolacyon. In troth the dampened folks there beneth have
no comfort in the world / for the orysons and prayers that been said in the
church mylytant may proufyte them no thing / and from above comes there no
help to them / there falls on them no myse rycorde. wherefore they be in
dyspayre of any grace in time coming and know certeynly yt they with out
remedy and not to be quyte out of the prison / and so they rest sempiternally
in waylynge in sorrow and in desolacyon. It is written in the book of Sapyence
in the iiii. chapitre. That the dampened souls shall be utterly in desolacyon.
Also the dampened soul says in the first chapitre of the Trenys of The remye.
I am cast in desolacyon and am conuycte in to weeping. It is written in Isaye in
the xxxiiii chapitre. That the wretched sinner shall be in desolacion during the
world of worlds. Alas alas what pain is yt to be endured. O most cruel
pain. O desolacion full of all tourmentes. and therefore o thou man remember
the and prynte often in thy heart and mind these things above said to
thentent* thou may esche we and withdraw the from sin. and there by have the
most precious glory and felycyte perdurable.

How those that descend into hell be cruelly punysshed.

The second chapitre of the third part payncypall.
Now to proceed following by order it rests to be expowned how there be many
and diverse afflyccyons given by the solderyours of hell. Those sol deyours
ben to vnderston de the deuylles / which ben tourmentours and hangemen full
abhomynable to behold and cruel in their dedys / never weary to tourmente nor
to give pains. I say first that those deuyles be horrible to behold. And
therefore they be so painted in the church with hydeous and horrible fygures /
to this purpose it is read that where sometime a relygyous man was leynge in
his dortor among his brethern. It happened in a night that he cried horrybly /
where thorugh all the brethern of his couente resorted unto him / and they
found him staryng and his eyes fixed upon a wall fyrmely without moeuyng
and would answer to no questyon yt they demanded him / he was so moeued with
a mernelous fere. and in the morrow his pryour came unto hy^ and asked what him
ayled that night / and he answered. He had seen the devil. And then it was
questyoned him / what shappe he was of. And he answered yt his shappe ne might
lightly be descryued / and said / if there were here an oven full of fire and
yonder the devil. I had as leef enter in to the oven / as long to behold on
his most horrible figure. and as saint Bernarde says in the Psalm of Qui
habitat in adiutorio. O my right dear brethern what thyn he ye / if it were a
thing syttyng / that one of thise princes of tenebres / that be of so many
hydeous and merueylous shappes should come and appear amongen you with his
great cruelte and unformed tenebrous body. what temporale or spyrytuale wit
might sustain to behold him. It is read in the book of Ditis patru^. How
there was sometime an ancient man that said. I trow there is no living
creature / but and he same the devil in the same form that the dampened
souls see him / he should no more life after / but shortly should dye. Also
Saint Gregorye says of one called Cryssoryus / which being full seek saw
beside him a great multitude of deuylles / wherefore he cried full hydeously
after help. he turned him this way and that way. to thentent he should not
see them / but he was so fervently troubled with them in fere / that right
soon he dyed. Certeynly all those that see the deuylles be in such great
troubles that all men diede the syghte of them / and not without Reason / for
their horrible figure tourmenteth those to death that beholds them. It is
written in Job the.xx. chapter Horrible things shall go and come upon them And
that Saint Bernard shows whenne he said. O my soul what fere shall you have
/ whenne thou shall leave the presence of all things where in thou haste Joy /
the sight of that / that is agreeable unto the and all thy famylyaryte. and
shalt enter allone ferfully in to the regyon / which is to the unknown /
whenne the right terryble and horrible monstres shall come in great companyes
against the. O how great a deformyte shall be in thoos horrible deuylles that
shall appear in figures of right cruel beestys. And as it is written in
the.xi. chapitre of Sapyens. Because they permytted errors as done serpents
and other superflue beestys / thou have sent them a multitude of dome bestys
in vengeance to the entente that they may know wherein they have sinned /
they to be tourmented by the same. Certain it is not Impossyble that the most
mighty hand that has create and made all the universal world of thing
unseen. should send a multitude of fers beres of hardy lions and other many
furyous beestys of diverse shappes castyng vapures of fire gyuyng stynkyng
smokes putting out of they eyes sparks brennyng of fire. but all these
things should be to the hurt of sinners and also the beholdynge might slay
them / as it is written in the chapitre a fore said. Job said in his.xvi.
chapitre. Mine enemy has behold me with terryble eyes. He also says in
his.xli. chapitre. His look and beholding is like a glystryng of fire out of
his mouth stremyng as it were brennyng lamps. and popilleth as water boylynge
out of a pot. Therefore says a Poet that there be therein serpe^tes vomyshyng
out of their mouths brennyng flammes with the which blastes the souls of the
miserable sinners ben all perysshed Secondly the fendes be cruel by effect.
where as it is written in Job the xvi. chapitre. They are assembled against me.
they have opened their mouths upon me as a rauyssyng lion / they have tempted
me. they have mocked me and grennyngly and felonesly showed me their tethe.
Also in Ecclesiastico in the.xxi. Chapitre. is said. Their tethe be like the
tethe of lions / which devour the souls To this purpose is written in the
first Pystle of saint Peter the.v. chapitre That how the devil is like a
braynge lion / which gooth sekyng to devour some soul. Certain the devil
shall be appointed at ye last day for to devour sinners. It is written in Isaye
in the lvi. chapitre. O ye all bestes of the feldes and wyldernes come ye for
to devour. Iheremye in his.xii. chapitre says. Come ye all bestes and
assemble and make you ready for to devour. Saint Gregory in his Dyalogis talks
thereof and says. That there was sometime a monk not yet verily monk in deed
but so named / which was called Theodorus. It was right dyspleasant unto him
/ whenne one spoke to him for his saluacon / he would not oonly leave to do good
/ but it lothed him to here speak thereof / and as Theodorus was at the article
of death. al his brethern of his covent assembled about him in prayers and
devout orysons yt they might help and defend his soul at ye departing from
his body. then he began suddenly to cry and with a great voice had them break
of and leave their oryso^s and prayers and depart / for he was given unto an
horrible dingon for to be devoured / which he said for their prayers might not
devour him. and yet he had swalowed his head / and prayed them therefore go
thens and pray no more / but let hy^ do that. that he purposed to do / sens he
was given unto him / and the foresaid Theodorus said / why suffer ye me so
long to be in this case. Then said his brethern unto him what is it that
thou see make the figure of the cross upon the. To who me the said Theodorus
answered with a lamen table cry. I would feyne bless me / but I can not / for
I am to hardely prycked and oppressed with the vyolence of this dragon. And
whenne his brethern herd him say so. they fill flat to the earth with
weeping teeres / and began again their prayers and orysons devoutly for the
help and Redempcyon of this Theodorus / which soon after suddenly began to
cry with a loud voice saying. I yield loving thanks and grace to god my
creator / for now that Dragon / which should have devoured me is driven and
chased away fro me by your good and devout prayers and orysons. Also Saint
Gregory tells an example in the fourth book of his Dyalogis that how in the
parts of Anchone in a monastery called Congolathon be fell sometime that there
was therein a monk which was taken for a very holy man meruelously well
dysposed toward god / But whenne his brethren went that he had fasted he was
accustomed secretly to ete. And when^e he was at the battle of death / he
called generally for all his brethren. saying unto them. I am delivered now
unto a dragon to be devoured / which with his tayll has knytte togydre my fete
and also my knees and puts his head in to my mouth and draws my soul out
of my body / and after he had said those words he dyed forth withal. It may
seem these words be for the conde^pned sinners which be written in Iheremy in
the.li. chapitre. He has eten me like a dragon. This dragon is hydeous and
great and has vii. hedes and.x. horns in the same as it is written in the
Apocalypse in the xii. chapitre. There has been a great battle in the shye so
yt saint Mychyell and his angel has fought with ye dragon and his angel
which might not resyst. and sith their rowmes in heaven could not be found but
were cast down and so yt dragon au^cyent serpent / which is called ye devil
satan enforces hy^self to make war upon the universal world here. And for
ye cause it is red in the same chapitre. That harm come to yt earth and to ye
see / for the devil is descended among you with all his great furyous anger
This devil has a merueylous great hate unto all good people which disposes
them to take possession in ye towme of heaven / from whens he was put out and
chased in to theterrnall pains / and ye more yt the day of dome approaches the
more te^pteth he more cursedly and more forseth himself to do evil in
destroynge of souls. O how great is ye wickedness and the malice of this
devil of hell. whereof Saint Bernard talks in a prose saying O how felonous
shall then this tormentours be which shall pain and tormente sinners. how
terryble shall their vengeance be in vengyng vices wret chednes and sins
Certey^ly their cruel malice is yet augme^ted in diverse manners. First
because they be so innumerable and of so diverse sorts. The Psalter seyth. why
be those so multyplyed that tormenteth me / and there be many that dress them
a yenst me. and as it is written in Job in the.xix. chapitre They have asseged
my tabernacle about me It is written in ^itis patru^. That there was a good
ancient man that saw the duyll enuyronynge the people and were as thyke as
beys that make honey / wherefore it is said also in the Psalter. They have
compassed me as beys be cause they be many and of great might* as Thapostle
witnesses in his pistle ad the Epheseos in the.vi. chapitre. where he calls
them princes and potestates and governors of the world be cause they be
subtle and mighty to noy souls. ye Psalter seyth. The strong have fought my
soul This strength is under stand by the deuylles. It is red also of that
streng the in Job the.xli. chapitre. There is no might upon the earth to be
compared with that / you has done so yt it dredeth no man save him that sees
all thing from above and is king over all the childeren of pride the deuylles
shall ernstfully exercise their might in pride to the punission of sinners and
them shall cruelly tourmente. It is written in Ecclesiastico the xxxix chapitre.
There be spyrytes that be ordained to take vengeance and has confermed the
torments in their furour enduryngly till the consummaco^n of the world. Job
says in his.xvi. chapitre. He has compassed me with his speris and has not
spared me. but has hurt my reins / he has cast my bowell to the earth / and
given me wounds upon wound and this come sholderyng against me like agaynd
Thirdely the malice and cruelte of the devil is comforted and is more grievous
be cause they are never weary of tormentyng As it is written in the book of
Danyell in the.iii. chapitre The mynystres shall not sease in sturynge the
fyres of the fourneys to the causynge of pains. Therefore said a wise man that
there be tourmentours. which be more to be lothed then serpents / and they be
black and defourmed and will not be beten down And they be never weary to do
harm / but newly encreasen their malice al way ready and boylyng desyrously to
put souls to pain / and Incessantly they excersyse their cruelte more and
more. And it is said to all sinners in Deutronomye in the.xxviii. chapitre.
Thou shall serve for thine enemy whenne our lord shall send the naked unto
him in honger and thyrste and in alpouerte. And then shall thysore wounds
enereace perpetuelly. O how great shall the pains be there to dampened folks
which shall last contynuelly in anguysshe and myserye without Intermyssyon
lacking peace or rest. It is read of the sinners in Ezechyell in the seventh
Chapitre. That whenne they shall feel this Anguysshyous pain / they shall
desire and require to have peace / but then they get none / for they sall
have conturbacyon and sorrow upon sorrow. It is written in Thapocalyps
the.xiiii. Chapitre. That thoos that have been beestly shall therefore have no
rest by day nor night. Then^e mow the sinners well say. as it is written in
Isaye in the xxxviii. chapitre. I shall not see our lord god in the living
land / nor I shall no more behold any man / that is inhaby tour of rest.
Semblable as it is written in Ihere mye the.xlv. Chapitre. Alas I am unhappy /
for our lord has added in me sorrow to sorrow / for I can find no Rest.
Sorrow shall be then cast at his head / and all Inyquyte shall descend
upon him. Now by these things above said it manyfestly appears how such as
descendet in to hell be punysshed with many diverse pains / and therefore me
thinks dear brethren how it should be often in your Remembrance to defend
you from falling to sin / whereby ye should lose the company of the happy
and blysshed saints and the celestial glory. which is perdurable and shall
dure world withouten end.

How there be many condycyons of tourmentes encreasynge the pains of hell.

The third chapitre of the third part pryncypale.
NOw rests to declare the third part of this matter / which is in showing
the condico^n of thinfernale tourment which be full diverse. Certain there be
sundry condico^ns yt specially encreace by occasyons the pains of hell. The
first is bytternesse weeping gryndyng of tethe / complaynyng the perpetuell
death / paynfull languyssynge in despair / and the wrath and blamyng of the
creator of all things with other many tourme^tes and pains innumerable to
be recyted / which doubteles shall be well fel^e and understand there by
syn^ers / as it appears in diverse places of holy scripture / and as it is
written in Thapocalyps in ye.xvi. chapitre. They have eten their conges for
great sorrow and have blasphemed the god of heaven for their anguysshys and
their wou^des. saint Gregory says that he yt is condemned to the cormentes
fyndeth more pain there then^e can be supposed or thought. said The rome
seyth that the force of the sorrow in hell shall be so great yt it can not
address his courage / but as the force of the said so row will co^strayne.
Certain the sinner shall say then as is written in Iheremye in the.viii.
chapitre. My woo increases in sorrow upon sorrow. The egrenesse of the pains
of hell shall be so great that sinners shall hate and dysprayse life / which
universally is delyted and with a brennyng desire wysshe to find death which
every man would flee. As it is written in ye Apocalypse in the.ix. chapitre. A
day shall come yt men shall desire and wysshe for death / and shall not have it
/ they shall require death and it shall flee away from them. In truth our
lord witnesses the egrenesse of the pains of hell in Iheremy in the.ix.
chapitre / where he says. I shall feed my people with absynth / commonly named
worm wode the which is a bitter herb. and I shall give them to drink galle /
whereby is signified the bytternes of the torments of hell It is red yt this
egrenesse was well considered by a young man which was delycyously nourysshed.
Nevertheless he entered in to thorder of prechers / and whene he had been in the
said order a while / there came a man from his kynesfolkes to amonisshe hy^ to
depart thens or he were professed / showing hy^ how delyciously he had been
brought up and therefore he might not sustain ye dures pains and troubles
perteynyng to the said order. The young man answered. I have entered in to this
order knowing well yt I was voluptuously nourysshed and might not well suffer.
But I remember well that the troubles pains of hell shall be importable /
wherefore I had lever to sustain the lityll pain of this order / then the
pains which ar incomparable. For Job says in his.vi. chapitre. the snow
shall fall upon them that shall dread the little mist. This consyderacyon
moved an here myte called Pyers to enterprise a merueylous penance. which he
accomplysshed / as Saint Gregory shows in the.iiii. book of his dyalogis this
heremyte dyed by a sickness / and yet after his death his soul was restored
again to his body. Also Saint Gregory says / that there was sometime a monk
horn of Irlonder called Pyers. this monk affermed how he had seen the grievous
tourmentes of hell. the innumerable paynfull places and fla^mes of fire. and
told how he had seen there certain mighty men of this worl de hanged up in
the said fla^mes. And he said as he was brought for to be cast in / suddenly
appeared an angel clothed all in white. which saved him and bad him goo thens
and attentyfly to remember how he should live from thens forthwarde to keep him
out of the danger of the pains. After that he had herd that voice. he reuyued
and came to him self lityll and lityll and showed unto his brethern there all
the thyngis that he had felt and seen / and from that day forthwarde he used
and lived a blessed life in fasting and doing penasice. so that by his
conversation after it might well seem ye pains of hell ar to be dred The
second condition encreasyng the pains of hell is the multyplyeng of the
tourmentes there. In certain they be innumerable. And as the psalter says. The
pains / which be without nombre have enuyrou^d and beclypped me. It is written
in Deutronomy the xxxii chapitre. I shall assemble many diverse pains upon
them. and I shall acco^plyshe or spend the shot of mine arowes in them. and as
it is written in Isay the.v. chapitre. His arowes be full sharp and all his
bows are bent / our lord has many arowes in his quiver / which he has not
yet shot forth / but after ye Judgment he shall smite all sinners with them.
These arowes are the diverse pains of hell / where as sy^ners shall be then
tour mented in many manners the Psalter says. The arowes of the mighty. yt is
to say of our lord be sharp among the coals of desolacyon. Our lord says
in Deutronomy ye xxii. chapitre. I shall ^mbrewe mine arowes in their blood /
my sword shall devour their flesh they shall perysshe by famyne / and the
birds shall strangle them with a full bitter morsel. I shall send avenst them
the tethe of wild bestes with the furour of those yt rampe and devour upon the
earth. Outward ye swerd shall destroy them. and Inward fere and dread shall
wast them Of this multitude of pains speaks saint Gregory in the.viii.
chapitre of Saint Matthew saying. They shall be cast out in to thuttermeste
tenebres / that is to say hell where shall be an vnsuffrable cold / an un
quencheable hete / an immortale worm / an intolerable stynche / a derkenesse
manyable / and an hortyble vysyon of deuel les thresshyng and betynge a
confusyon of syn^ers a separacyon of all Joys And therefore said a wise man /
yt hell is a mortyfyeng pyt full and accomplysshid with all pains and
myseryes. The Psalter seyth. It shall reyne brymstone upon sinners and the
spyrytes of tempestis. which be part of the sorrows and tourme^ntes of hell.
And that saying is to be noted by cause that there be many other parts of
tourmentis impossyble to be expressed. all that ever we have spoken of the
pains of hell is a full little thing in regard of the great infynyte
multitude of them / but to thentent yt the multyplycaco^n of the ^e pains may
be the more expressly declared. It is also to be noted how dampened souls
shall be full of all myseryes and so rows. for they shall ever have weeping
eyes gryndyng of their tethe. stynche in their noses wayllyng in their voices.
fere in their eres / brennynge of fire in all their members / and therein shall be
bounden hand and foot. Lo how the wretched syn^er descendyng in to hell shall
be fulfilled with all torments. It is written in Job the.xv. chapitre of ye
dampened man how tribulaco^n shall hold him. and anguys she shall enuyron^e him.
And in the.xiii. chapitre of Isaye. How all mennys hertes shall be abashed and
ferde for the sorrows and torcyons that shall hold him having the pain that
women suffer trauelyng of child / echo ne shall sorrow upon his neighbor /
and their broyled faces shall affray eve rich other. Therefore Baruch said in
his.vi. chapitre. Their faces be blacked with smoke / for the faces of all
sinners shall be brought to the likeness of a round pot. as it is written in
Iohell the second chapitre. Also it is said in Ecclesiastyco the.xlviii.
chapitre. The pains of a woman trauelynge shall come unto them. The same also
is written in Ozee the.xiii. chapitre. So as it appears there be many scorges
and fleyles in hell for to beat sinners therewith. Certeynly the dampened soul
shall mow say with the Psalter. The sorrows of death have compassed me / and
the pains of hell have fou^den me. It says. It has compassed me for this
cause. For it is to him a vestyment or coueryng of maledyccion. which shall be
both within him and without him. O what vestyment shall this be that shall be
women with so paynfull thredes / and those without nombre / which can never
be undone nor taken away. for with an inmortale stryng it shall be inseparably
bounden unto the sinner. This shall be a sore and a bytynge vestyment to be
suffered. This is the vestymente that is written of in Isaye in the.xiii.
chapitre saying. Thy vestyment shall be worms. The co^syderaco^n of these many
fold pains revoked and called Dauyd from syn^e and caused him to do
penance. and therefore he said to our lord. How many sorecribulaco^ns have yt
she wed me. and yt converted have reuyned me. The consyderaco^ns also of thise
for said pains moeued sometime an heremyte for to take-vppon him a right sharp
paynfull life. which he led in his heremitage. as it is red in Vitis patru^.
It was axed of hy^ why he would so slay him self. And he answered. All the
labor of my life is not suffycyent to be compared to one of the days of
tourmentes that be or deyned and reserved for sinners in time to come Beda
shows us in his writing of England. how yt in ye time of young Consta^tyne
there dyed a knight about the years of our lord.viii. C. and.vi. which knight
reuyued. and after for the pains yt he had seen / he fled in to an
heremytage / as it is red in Vitis patru^ / and he made hy^ a lityll house by a
Ryuyer side. In the which ryuyer he would run oftentimes all clothed in the
winter time. and would suffer his clothes to frese unto his flesh / and then
after he would lepe in to a bayn as hot as hit was possible to hy^ to suffer.
And this life he led unto his death. And when^e folks saw him do so / they
blamed him therefore. and he said to them If ye had seen that I have seen / ye
would do as I do. and rather more Saint Gregory says. The vysyon of the pains
of hell is the most excellent moeuyng that can be to penance and contricion
The third condycyon encreasyng the pains of hell is the euerlastyngnesse
thereof. It is written in the book of Sapyence the.iiii. chapitre. Our lord
shall mock them. That is to understand sinners after they shall fall from
their worship among them that be sempyternally deed. Saint Matthew says
the.xxv. chapitre. They be those / that shall goo in to tourmentes. In Iudyth
the xvi. chapitre is red / that our lord shall send worms of fire against
their flesh / that they may bre^ne and yet live and feel the pains for ever.
To that purpose speaks Isaye in his last Chapitre thus. Their worms shall not
dye / another their fire quench. And therefore says our lord in Deutronomye in
the.xxxii. chapitre. The fire is kyndeled with my furour and shall brenne in to
the lowest part of hell / and that shall be perpetuelly and endelesly. Isaye
in his.xxxiii. chapitre says. O which of us shall mow suffer and endure the
devouring fire / who shall mow be among those that shall be burnt
sempyternally. In the xxxiii. chapitre of the same Isaye is said. The ground
where they dwell shall be converted into brennynge pytche night and day / and
shall not quench / and the smoke shall be from generaco^n to generaco^n upon
them during the world of worlds. It is written in the Apocalypse in the.xx.
chapitre. The devil shall be sent in to the lake of fire and sulpher and
brymstone. where the evil best and the false prophet shall be tormented
night and day in the world of worlds. And he that shall not be fonden in the
book of life / shall be sent in to the lake of fire there for to dwell in the
shadow of death / where is none order / but sempyternall horror and sorrow.
It is written in Job the.x. chapitre / and also Saint Gregory seyth in his
Moralles a right horrible word. That is to wit. Then shall the miserable
sinners suffer a great pain with a great fere / a great flamme with a
derkenesse / and death without death / an end without fynysshyng / for that
death shall ever live / and that end shall begin always again. and that
fault shall never fail And a poet shows how that miserable death can not
dye nor fynysshe / but seems all way that it begins and renews wepynges
and languysshynges. Peter de bloys said in a pystle. There shall be none order
of any manner of torments another sparynge / but endelesly the pains shall
renew and begin ageyn / death can not dye there / for it shall be always
permanent and never cessyng to thentent yt ye conda^pned souls may myserably
always encreace in their pains and sorrows and be nourysshed in eternal death.
The Psalter says. They be casten in to hell as sheep and death fedeth them.
Mow then this sinners have their fedynge of death. what shall be their drink.
Herkene what is written in Deutronomye in the.xxxii. chapitre. the burgynge of
the grape and the vine that they shall have / shall be aysell and galle of
Dragons / and the venym of the Adder called aspe. which is incurable. O
wherewith shall the sinners be nourysshed / see yt not how they be
perpetually tourmented with the most cruel death / they shall live then in
dyeng / and shall be deed living. Saint Bernard seyth in a book that he sent
unto Pope Eugeny. The bytynge worm and the living death. I grouge and secre
gretely. I dread to fall in to the hands of the death that ever lives / and
of the life that never dies. Saint Gregory says. That the felon sinners
shall dye of inmortall death. O good lord eternal why have you suffered me do
contrary thy will and work mine own sorrow / why helpest thou not me out of
syn^e. whereby I might escape this perpetuel death. O how happy. o how blissed
shall he be yt shall not be fouled nor smonged with the fylthes of sin / and yt
has not reioysshed him in the sensuale voluptacyons of this transytorye world
/ nor in te^porall vanytees. Certain I am ferde yt we miserable sinners have
erred from the way of life / and that the light of Justice has not shyned
upon us / we have not followed the ways of our lord / but have taken the
unhappy ways of Iniquyte and perdycion. It is written in Isaye the.xlix.
chapitre / we have labored in vayn and for naught we have wasted all our
strength. what has our pride auayled us / what has profyted our pomp and
the vanyte of the richesses of this world / what be we amended by our
Iewelles. or precious garnementes. by our delicious metes and drynkes / our
glotonyes / our laughynges and idle disportes. now what auantageth us all
things. wherein we have vaynely vnproufytably / and dampnably spent our time.
Alas alas / we have lost and passed our days without fruit. and may be
lykened to werse then a dounghyll / and all those things be paste / but our
wretchedness shall remain to our eternal tourmentes. Our lord shall say
to every dampened soul. as is written in Job in the.xx. chapitre. He shall
suffer tourmentes and pains after ye multitude of his wicked operacyons. and
in the xviii. chapitre of thapocalyps is wryte^. As much as he has gloryfyed
him self in delytes and pleases / as much tourment and pain shall be yeuen him
therefore to remain therein eternally. Now is it not a great folly for the rich
or vain pleasyr of this world or any other miserable thing a man to submytte
him to perpetual torment both of his body and of his soul. Johan crysostom
says in his book tytled of the reparacyon of defaultes / what contynuau^ce of
lecherye and space of delectacyons wylt you compare to the sempyternall pains.
Now take yt thou live. C. year in delectacynns / set thereto an other. C. and
yet. C. and after that.x. hundred if you wylt yet what comparyson is this to
theternyte. May not all the time of our bodily life. though we intended never
so voluptuously be resembled unto a dreme of the night in regard of the
sempyternall life. Is there any person yt ought will to have one pleasant and
delectable night in diemes / and therefore to find the sempyternall pains /
and so change for a pleasant dreme so little enduryng / to have ye pains of
hell. which be perpetuel. what shall we speak of this pleasyr / or of those
pains. The pleasyrs pass lightly away / and the pains must remain
euerlastyngly. Now take it. that the time and the space of the pleasyrs and of
the pains were egale. Is there any that ought to be so mad or so folysshe /
as to chese for to have for one day of pleasyr here a day of dampnacyon in
hell. Remember how that one hour of bodily sickness in this world puts
away all pleasyr for the season. Right so Remembrance how the perpetuell
pains ought to resyst against all sins. O how great tourment and pain shall
be to the dampened souls / their everlasting dampnacyon and perpetuell death is
so hard and so sore / that I wot not how / that I could express hit
greuousely Inowe. for certeynly it can not suffycyentely be spoken. conceived
in mind nor comprehended in heart. Now take we that there were a piece of
metalle as great as might be comprehended within the concauyte of the.viii.
spear. and every.M. year there should be taken from hit a little piece like a
grayn / and so consequentely till it were all brought to no thing / should not
the eternyte be fynysshed by that time / and the dampened souls delivered out
of their pains. I answer and say you nay / for the perpetuyte shall be
then but at the beginning. there can be no proporcion in a thing Infynyte
/ as Arystotyle the phylosophre says in his.viii. book of his physykes.
Certainly if dampened souls myghten know and understand that they should be
delivered out of thyntollerable pains of hell as soon as the said piece of
metalle were so wasted and gone / as is above said yet they might have hope of
their Redempcyon against that season / and have some manner of confort. knowing
that their tourmentes should some time taken end / yet the years would be
incomprehensyble and innumerable. Now surely one of the grettest pains is the
desolacyon and defaulte of hope ever to be redeemed and delivered out of
theternall tourmentis For as it is written in Isay the.xxxiiii. chapitre. The
sinner shall be in desolacyon time and world withouten end. It is written in
the book of Trenys the third chapitre. Mine end and mine hope in god is
perysshed. Iheremye in his xv. chapitre asks / why is my sorrow made
imperpetuell and my wounds in desperaco^n / whereunto is answered in the.x.
chapitre of the Prouerbys. That whenne the felon sinner is ones deed. there is
then none hope to be had. Entende and remember this all ye that be for geters
of our lord / leest that this most cruel and sorrowful place of hell
swalowe you / from whens ye may never be pulde out. Loo now ye may see
clearly / how the wretched sinner can not be redeemed out of hell. wherefore my
right dear friends I amoneste and require you / bear that remembrance well in
your minds / and conceive well the Example of the piece of metalle above
specyfyed. And now tell me what thou felest. and what thyn own heart demeth
and Iugeth in this matter. I wene certainly thy dyscrecyon will give thereunto
credence / for true it is / and to troth by Reason yt must needs apply. Also
bethynke the of the diverse prouynces of lands and ymagine every Regyon of
them. Consider the sees the ryueres and the poondes. Enclose in thy mind the
circuyte of the world / and goo every where thereof. Flee up in to the air /
and then descend in to the lowest part of therthe / and of all this think
in thy mind / thou have made an hole substance and ymagyne and extend how
great a thing this should be / and if hit might not be consumed by tracte of
time / and then tell me what you thynkest of thynfynyte pains of sinners.
whether should be long endurynge the consumyng of the same substance. or the
relessyng of the perdurable pains. I ^^owe thou wylt agree. yt there can no
thing be compared to a perpetuyte / wherefore we ought all in our corages
tymerousely to tremble and fere it. Now who is he yt dredeth hit not. who is he
yt abassheth not thereof. who is he yt had not lever abide the consumyng of ye
foresaid substance. than the time of eternyte. Let this said substance and
this time of eternyte be couched upon thyn heart and thou shall find it a
proufytable thing and gretely to thine auantage. For if thou wylt not correct
and revoke thy self from thy sins by the love yt thou owe to bear unto
god. yet the myrour and Remembrance of the Intolerable and Infynyte pains
should reuoque / sequestre and withdraw the from sins. O lord god that this
perdurable pain is to be eschewed and drad. And wepynly we ought to Remember
our sins by great contryon / that we might there by come to the everlasting
salvation. Loo here before has be showed the encreasyng of thynfernale pains /
and how they may never cesse nor finysshe. which was well considered by one
sometime called Fulson of Mercelles / which was in his days an excellent Iouge
lyre all abandouned and given to the vanytees of the world. In a day he
bethought hy^ of the pains of hell and of the eternyte theeof / and Remembered
in his heart. If he were compelled to lie in a fair and a soft bed well
hanged and pleasantely dressed and for no necessyte might depart out of it.
yet all were it never so delycyous / it could not lie in his power contynually
to endure hit. And there upon Remembered him how he should then mow sustain
thintollerable per petuell pains of hell / which are languerouse and from
thens none may depart. This forsayde Fulson consyderyng that left all his
vain worldely delytes and made him self a monk / and lychen was archybysshop
of Toulouse / where he lived and guyded him right holyly in the service of our
lord. The consyderaco^n of the perpetuell pains of hell should endure and
comfort every good soul to fight and resyst myghtly against his ghostely enemy
/ for if the fend vaynquysshe and overcome him / he may be sure to lie
therefore without great repentance and grace in the sempyternale pains of
hell. And therefore for Ihesus sake with all your might fight and resyste
vygorously ayenste the cruel enemy of all mankind / which does naught but
lies in a wait for to bring us all to dampnacyon. Egesyppus says in his
book of the destruccyon of Jews. How that one of the great Capytaynes of king
Alexander being chyef of an Host / saw on a time an Innumerable armee coming
against him to fight with him. And whenne his people saw them come / they
dysposed them to ete and to drink for to make them of the more bodily might
and put therein their trust. This good Capytayne seeng that they gave more
hope to their bodily strengthes than to the power of him. whom all other
myghtes can not resyste. said in this wise. O ye noble and worthy men / let us
dyne now together / for we be like to souppe this night in hell all in a
company. This people heryng these words to eschew that heavy soupper / put
their affyaunce in our lord and set on / and fought so vyguorously / that
they with Tryumphe and honor overcome their enemies. Consyderyng that
Remembrance of the pains of Helie should withdraw us from worldely delytes.
Hit is read in Vitis Patrum. How there was an Ancient man that said /
whenne a woman will ween her child and make it to loathe the sweetness of her
milk / she will put upon her pappes head a little mustarde or some other
bitter thing / when^e the child feleth that / it withdraws and puts a
way his appetyte from the sweet milk. So semblably the sour Remembrance of
the perpetuell tourmentes and pains of hell ought to reuoque a man from all
the vain delectacyons of this wretched world. Job says in his.vi. chapitre.
May not a man cast of a thing / which should cause him the right bitter
death. That is to say / the pains perpetuell. Prosper seyth. In this present
life the temporal delytes be full pleasant / and the trybulacions full bitter.
But who is he that should not gladly suffer trybulacyons in this life for fere
of the sempyternall pains of hell And who is he that ought not to despise the
delycyouse pleasyrs of this world forto have the most happy Joy of
everlasting bliss. It is said also in the Legende of Saint Johan the
Euangelyst. That rich and mighty folks were converted by his predycacyon /
and relynquysshed all their worldely rychesses. Yet they saw after some / yt
were their servants raised in the flatryng glory and fortune of this world
wherefore they repented them / that they had lost all their goods so. which
thing Saint Johan understood by the holy ghost. and prayde unto our lord for
their salvation / and then our lord changed certain pieces of timber unto
fine gold / and hard flynte stones unto precyouse Ieweles. and so they were
restored unto gretter tresoure and richesse / than ever they had lost for
our lords sake. Then^e it happened that Saint Johan reuyued from death a
yongly man which showed unto chose folks the eternal glory that they had
lost for ^^ichesse of this world / and how the pains of hell did but abide
them whenne the folks herd and understood yt they were so abashed and in
so great fere. that forth withal they myspraysed / despised and refused all
worldely richesse and delytes and wylfully returned unto their pou^^te for
their salvation. It is read in Vitis patrum. How there was some time a young
friar that said unto a fader of his order. I am slouthefull and weary to sytte
always thus still in my celle. To whom this good fader answered / thou have not
seen nor understand the tormentis yt be to come in hell / which shall be
perpetuelly enduryng. and therefore if thou prynte yt well in thyn heart / though
thy celle were full of worms. you sholdest not grouge / but would abide in
hit patiently for to eschew these pourable pains. For every syn^er must
endure the eternale tormentis of hell / or ye right sharp pains of purgatory
/ or else he must do and suffer suffysant penance in this world. Then what
unhappy creature is he that is so blind and so ha^tred with vngrace and lack
of Reason / that had not lever suffer here suffysante panaunce than in hell
to be tourmented and punysshed with outen end. Isydore says. Think in thine
heart all the sekenesses and pains of this world all the bytternesses and
sorrows what so ever they be. comparyng them dystynctely with the gehenne of
hell / and thou shall mow well know that all pains here be in Regard as
no thing unto thoos. Saint Bernard says in a Pystle. Thou diedest to wake
on nyghtes / to fast and to labor with thyn hands. But Remembryng the
perpetuell fla^mes all that ought to be but light unto the. Certain all
solytarye life is to be confonted by that Remembrance. And if thou knew
thextreme dyscussynge of all idle words / silence should dysplease the no
thing. Saint Austyne in a sermon says. How delectable thoughts cause often
humayne nature to be conquered and ouercomen with the delytes and the
voluptuous concupyscence of this world / which eschew all labors. and are
naught but pleasyrs and follow all ways delectacyons. But whenne that
thoughts fall to Remembrance of the necessyte and dangerous last Judgment
with the eternale Pains. What other for fere of those tourmentes / or sometime
for hope of the most rich Reward hit moeueth a man from all the passions of
his pleasyrs and Voluntarely to rise up in Battle against them encendynge to
have vyctorye upon his first delectable vain pleasante thoughts. Abacuk
says desyrousely in his.iii. Chapter. Rottynnesse will enter in to my bones
/ and spring under me in my life by cause I should rest me the day of
trybulacyon. Behold here my right dear friends how fructuouse and how
hoolsome is the Remembrance of the Infernalle pains. The psalter says.
Sinners they be transported in to hell. Wherefore by good medytacyons every man
in his life entende to the resystence of that daungere. Or else they must
living dye perpetually. It is read. How he is e^re^sely happy that beholds
the de^^ ^enebres. That is to say. To regystre in his heart the Infernale
tourmentes / and that with a contynuall Remembrance in contemplacyon to
frequente that sure memory. Now me thinks I have suffysantely showed you the
manyfolde manners of the diverse pains of Hell / and how vayllable and to
what proufyte grows the memoryale Remembrance thereof. O mortal man / what
error / what folly / and what fault is in the / whenne it lies in thy free
arbytrement to have Joys everlasting and wyllyngly castest thy self in to the
Infernal tourmentes and pains / from whens none may return. but brenne
there in fire world without end.

And thus ends the third part of this treatise dyuyded in four parties.
And here begins the prologue upon the.iiii. part of the.iiii. last thyngis
which be for to come
THis third part of the four last things which be for to come. whereof
soueraynely the Remembrance withdraws a man from sin. Is the mind of the
everlasting celestyall glory. And if a man refrain himself from mourder of
from any crymynale cause for fece of losing of his honor or temporale goods.
how much more ought he refreyne / dread and eschew all sinful operaco^ns.
whereby he might lose the most blysfull sempyternall Joys. saint Austyn
says in a book of his confessyons. There is a Joy / which is not to be given
to the felon sinners / but to those that of their free will love and worship
the lord god / and thou thy self art that Joy. For this cause it is written
in the first Pystle ad Coryntheos the.vi. chapitre The felon sinners shall not
possess the kingdom of heaven / but shall confusedly be put therfro^ as the
vile glotons and dyshonest folks be chased out of the emperor his court / and
not suffer to sytte among kings and princes at their excellent and solemn
tables. And Cassydore says yt every man is put and cast from the deyte after
the quantyte of his sins. And certeynly his casting fro. is mesured after ye
delectaco^ns that he has had in them Now should not then^e every creature
eschew to do sin. and have it in abhomynacyon as a mortal thing / knowing
yt thereby is lost the celestyall eternal glory. O what shall I poor wretch
bareyn of know seche say* or how shall I talk of this glory
inco^prehensyble. Certeynely there was never eye yt saw / nor ere yt herd /
nor here yt thought the Joy yt god has ordained for those yt he loves. As is
written in the first Pystle ad Coryntheos the.ii. chapitre. Therefore what shall I
now more say or write / in this work I am as one born blind yt dysputeth in
colors having no co^fydence to mine own proper wyste. But there for I must
refer myself to ye testymonyes of scriptures / by ye which I will speak. It
is to be noted / how albe it in the heavenly glory there be innumerable thyngis
plainly approuyng the Joy and felycite thereof. Yet I will specially show how
it is to be rocomeded for.iii. things The fyst for the soue rain and
excellent clerenesse thereof. Secondly for ye most habundau^ce of the
goodnesses that be therein And thirdely for ye most blyssull Joy thereof
perdurably enduryng. the beauty thereof. nor the clernesse can not be mesured /
the Infynyte goodness can not be esteemed. nor theternall Joy can not be
compared nor sufficiently praised. Of these.iii. things I shall treat breefly
by order in this last part.

Thus ends the prologue of the forth and the last part of this book.
How the Royalme and kingdom of heaven is praised for his beauty and clerenesse.

The first chapitre of the fourth part and the last pryncypall.
FIrst the kingdom of heaven is to be recommended for the souerayn beauty and
clerenesse thereof as it is written in the book of Sapience the.v. chapitre
wherein it is called the Royalme of beauty. The Psalter says. Lord I have loved
the beauty of thyn house. It is also written in Thoby the. xiii chapitre. I shall
be happy if the Relyques of my seeds may see the dernesse of Iherusalem /
whereof the gates be made of Sapphires and emerawdes and other precious stones.
The cyrcuyte of the walls with fair bright stones. and all the places paued
with fine gold. It is written in Thapocalips the xxi chapitre That cite was
made of fine gold pure and clean as glass. The fondement of walls enourned
with all precious stones. The twelve gates shall have twelve Margarytes. And
the streets of the cite shall be of fine gold shynyng as bryghte as glass.
The temple is not yet spoken of* Certeynly almighty god is the temple thereof /
and the Lamb is the light. The forsavd Cite has no need of the Son / nor
of the Moon to light hit with all. For the clerenesse of our Lord shall
Illumyne hit / and the Lamb shall be the lantern / and the people shall mow
walk by that clerenesse. It is also read in the.xxii. Chapitre of
Thapocalyps. It shall never be night there / wherefore there needs no candell
nor lantern / nor light of the son. For the bryghtnesse of our lord shall
light and Illumyne them enduryngly world withouten end / which saying may
well accord with that / that is written in Isaye the.lx. chapitre. Thou shall
have then no need of the shynyng of the son nor Resplendysshyng of the moon. For our lord shall light and Illumyne the sempyternally. In troth he
is a glass without any spot and a light Illumynyng euerlastyngly As it is written
in the book of Sapyence the.vii. chapitre. Also our lord shall be the
Resplendysshynge of glory. As is written to the Hebreos in the first chapter.
which resplendysshyng shall be an hole light. Abacuk in his.iii. chapitre
says of this resplendysshyng all the saints shall take in the Royame of heaven
clerenesse and sempyternall light. wherewith all they shall rejoice them
incessantely in great felycyte. It is also written in the book of Iugys the.v.
chapitre. Those that love the / shall shine and resplende as the son does in
his rysyng. Also is written in the book of Sapyence the.iii. Chapitre. How those
that be Just shall shine in their faders Royalme like the son. O lord
sempyternall ground of all virtue. how good and how glorious is the Royalme /
and how ought thy tabernacles to be beloved. how great is thy beauty / how
habundante is thy Resplendysshyng in thy cite. how merueylous is the bright
clerenesse thereof / and how souerayn is the swetnesse of thy celestyal co^tree.
For this cause seythe Saint Austyn in his book of free arbytremen te. So great
is the beauty of Justice / so great is the sweetness of thyn eternal light.
That if it were not expedyent to de lyte therein but one hour of the day for
to have that Joy oonly. The in numerable days of this present life full
habundante of all temporal goods ought therefore reasonable to be myspreysed
and forborne. Now certeynly it is not vnresonably spoken / nor without a great
ground / that better is to be one day in that court than a thousand in this
world. O celestyal Iherusalem. O shynyng house full of al bryghtnesse I wysshe
my pilgrymage to reche unto the / and to be possessed in the by him that made
both the and me. And therefore seyth Saint Bernarde in his third book upon the
Gospel Missus est angelus Gabriel. O how glorious is the Royalme of heaven The
kings have assembled them in a mont that is to understand. to love praise and
gloryfye him that is king above all kings and lord over all lords. In the
resplendysshynge contemplacion of whom the Just people shall shine as the
son in the Royame of their fader. To this purpose seyth the Psalter thou
shall replenisshe me with gladness in thy face Job seyth also in ye xxxiii
chapitre. His face shall be seen in great Ioyeful gladness. All those shall behold
and have syghte of that most sweet Vysage / yt have trewely served our lord
and savior Ihesu christ in humylyte of heart / in good labors and virtuous
works. Isaye says in his.xxxiii. chapitre They shall see the king of kings
in his great beauty. O how blysfull. O how aggreable. O how sweet and how happy
shall be the beholding of our sauyoure Ihesu christ to those yt have perfyghtly
loved him Certeynly they shall mow Ioyefully say as is written in Abacuk the
iii chapitre. I shall rejoice me in our lord and disporte me in Ihesu crist my
god O how greatly shall those rejoice them yt shall be fulfilled with the
celestyall Joys / and what gladness shall they have yt shall be Illumyned
with the vysyon of the resplendysshynge face of our lord god. The which Joy
and gladness shall be permanent and abydyng world without end.

How the celestyal royalme is to be commended for the goodness that is therein.

The second chapter of the fourth part and the last pryncypall.
THe Royalme of heaven is secondly reco^mended for thabondante goodness thereof.
Saint Austyn says in his book de Ciuitate dei. That. yt god has ordained for
those yt he loves / may not be oonly atteyned by hope without it be co^pryseo
with charity and so it may will be atteyned. the Rewards of the happy saints
can not be nombred nor estymed / thabu^dau^ce thereof is without end. and is
so precious yt it can not be suffycyentely preysed. Of the superhabu^dante
rich goodness of this celestyal Royalme is written in Deutronomi in the.viii.
chapitre thus Our lord god shall led the in a good co^tree / which is
Indewed with waters. with fontayns. with spry^gis. with feldes. with montayns
Out of ye which shall come floodes and ryueres. He shall led the also in to a
land / where grows whete / barley / and vynes / and where grow fygues and
apples / grayns and olyfs / oil and honey / and there without any necessyte
thou shalt ete thy bread with habundance of all good is Now certain this is a
right comodyous co^tree fulfilled with sweetness / this is the contree / to
the which were sent the sons of Adam As is written in the book of Iugys
the.xviii. chapitre / which said at their Return. we have seen a comodyous
plentyfull contree right rich / will ye not myspreyse it nor cesse we not /
but let us go take possessyon thereof. For there is no labor / and our lord
shall give us a room therein / whereby we shall have none necessyte nor lack.
For there is no thing that enoyeth / and all good delectacyons be there Saint
Austyn says that the eternal beatytude and well be specially in two things.
That is to wit. In the absence of all evil / and in the presence of all well.
Now if yt wylt axe me / what things be in heaven. I can answer the none
otherwise / but all thing that is good is there. and all thing that is naught
can never come there. And therefore says saint Gregory. There is no good
thing desired nor lacked there / another there is any thing within hit yt
hurts or enoyeth. It is written in the last chapitre of thapocalyps They
shall no more have honger nor thyrst / nor the son nor the hetes shall no
more hurt them for the lamb of god / which sytteth in ye myddle of the crone
shall govern and bring them to the fontayne of the water of life. And more is
following in the same chapitre he seyth. Show me the flode the ryuere of the
water of life. who has thyrste / come and drink / who will have of that water
of life come and take it. And he that has of that water / shall never be
thyrsty / as it is written in the gospel of saint Johan in the. iii chapitre. O
how happy and how blessed is that contree / where god shall be all thing in all
thing and where is no pouerte. nor lack of any thing that is good. This
contree is the celestyall pasture / wherein shall need nothing to be wysshed.
For in this pasture shall our lord beayte and feed his true lovers whom he
will beclyppe perpetually. Therefore says our lord in Ezechyell the xxxiiii.
chapitre. I shall put them in their co^trees and feed them in the montayns of
Israhell. Now certeynly the happy saints of heaven be well fed with knowleche
of the sovereign truth / which is to them a full fructnouse pasture. be it
when they enter in contemplaco^n of the dyuynyte / or in considering the grace
of the humanyte. And in both these they shall find cause to be sacyate and fed
with delectacyons. And they shall feel the fruit of souerayn sweetness / and
as the Psalter says. He has given the thy fill of the fine fatness of the
flower of the whete. The fatness of the flower of the whete is delectacion of
sweetness caused by the love of god. Of the which flour of whete by the same
love mote my soul be fulfilled / and then I shall rest in the eternal
Ioyouse surete always wexynge grene and never to dry. Here is now showed how
good is this contree where in the happy men shall be fed / which is so fruit
full and plenteuous. Certainly this is the contree of life. In the which we
must hope to see ye goodness of our lord. the Psalter says / we shall all be
fulfilled with the goods of thyn house. Now what be the goods / that saints
shall be fulfilled with. but oonly the grace of the Incomprehensyble glory.
Saint Bernard says in a sermon of the Dedycacyon. The reasonable soul made
after the image of God may well be occupied with all other thyngis. but it may
not be all fulfilled. Certeynly she co^prehendyng god may not be fulfilled with
less thing than god. we shall not oonly be fulfilled with this vnrecytable
glory. but also we shall be dronken and assotted thereon. It is read in
Iheremye the.xxxi. chapitre. I shall make drunk the souls of the priests of
grace / that shall be at the great soupper which is ordained for good folks. He
shall set and admynystre them mete of glory. and give them drynk of
merueylous Joy and swetenes Then it shall be said to those that shall ete there.
As is written in the Cantycles the.v. chapitre. My right dear friends. Ete and
drink and make you dronken. In Isaye the.xxix. chapitre also it written Make
you dronken / but not with wine / and where with then^e shall they make them
dronken / with Joy and with gladness and with felycyte / and with many manners
of the celestyall glory. O good lord god eternal. how swetly shall thy good
and new servants be dronken with the plenteuousnes of thine house / and with
the voluptuousness of the. For in the is the fontayne of life / the fontayne
of beatytude and of glory permanent and never fayllyng. Certeynly all
sweetness belongs to thine house. It is the house of our lord / the cite of
god / which is full of all rychesses / and resplendysshed with all goods.
Therefore seyth Isay in his xxiii chapitre. Thyn eyn shall see Iherusalem full
habundant of all goods. The great multitude of the copyous habundance of the
things before said of this cite should not holy satysfye to call us thither /
but also right specially the restfull multitude of this peace. wherein those yt
be happy / shall delight them enherytyng ye contree above specifyed The same
Isaye says in his lv chapitre. ye shall pass out in Joy / and shall be
brought in to peace. O how great shall the habu^dance of this peace be in
Iherusalem / wherein it shall remain perpetuelly without any waire. Isay yet
says in the.ix. and.xxxii. chapitres. My people shall be in the beauty of peace
/ and in the tabernacles of confydence / and in the rich habundance of rest.
Also Thobye says in ye.xiii. chapitre. O Iherusalem cite of god. happily
blyssed be thoso yt love the / and rejoice them in thy peace. It is in Ezechyell
the.xiii. chapitre. The saints see in the vysyon of peace / there is Joy and
peace with peace / which is so precious. yt it surmou^teth / and is by yonde
all humayne understanding. Now then^e he yt will be particypable of so great a
Joy and peace with the saints eternally an high in heaven / he must learn now
to suffer humbly and have pacyence here a low in earth For as it is written in
a book called Aurora drawn out of the Bible. By suffrance is wonnen that
most noble rest / and there is none so wise that can rejoice that peace. but
oonly it is had by trauayll and suffryng of trybulaco^ns and pains pacyently
in this mortal world etc.

How the Royalme of heaven is praised and landed for the Joy and bliss yt is
therein euerlastyngly.

The third chapitre of the fourth part and the last pryncypall.
THyrdely the Royalme and kingdom of god is to be reco^mended for great Joy
and gladness that is therein eternally enduryng / and there upon says Saint
Gregory in an Omelye. who has that tongue that can suffysantely declare and
express the Joys of that sovereign Cite. Or who has conuenably the
understanding to comprehend / how great those Joys be to the companyes of
Angellys / and to the happy souls. And how Inestymable is that most blysfull
eternal Joy and glory in beholdynge the vysage of our lord god having no
manner of trouble nefere of death / but live in reioysyng them of that most
precious gift of grace / which shall ever be permanent and without
corrupcyon. Certain that Royalme ye cite of our lord must be understand
Iherusalem / which Iherusalem is most bonteuousely plenteuously and blyssedly
edyfyed. O cite of cytees / which is so habundantely full of blysfull Joys
to the happy souls loved be you. It is written in Isaye the last chapitre.
Rejoice you with Iherusalem. and disporte you in her to the end / that ye may
know and be fulfilled and fed with the pappe of consolacyon / and that ye may
be habundant in all manners with the delectaco^ns of that glory. Of the which
inmesurable felycyte and glory of that noble Cite speaks Saint Austyn in his
book of the cite of our lord saying. O how great shall the felicite be there.
where shall be another pain / nor harm / nor well / nor good thing hid / but
entendynge holy unto the louynges and praysynges of our lord. It is written in
Isaye in the lxiiii. chapitre. There was never eye that saw without the that
Joy / which yt haste ordained to them that abide the / nor more great
gladness can be than that thou wylt give those that thou love which they
shall possess perpetuelly. It is red in the same Isaye the.xxx. Chapitre. They
shall come in to syon and all louynges and sempyternall Joys upon their hedes.
The Psalter says. Our lord has known the days of those yt be pure and not
smouged / and their heritage shall be perpetuell. It is written in Thobye
the.xiii. chapter. Lord thou art right gretely eternal / and thy Royalme is
in all worlds. Saint Austyne says in his book of the Cite of our lord. we
shall be understanding and shall see / preyse and love ont lord. This shall be
in then de / which is withouten end. Now what should we desire to be our
end. but to search and seek the ways to atteyne the coming in to that royame
wherein Joys have none end / which royame is ye royame of all the worlds /
and certaynely thy power and lordshyppe is upon all generacyons. Thoby says
in his xiii. Chapitre. Blessed be our Lord / which has so high raised
Iherusalem to the entente / that his royame be above in the world of worlds.
O how glorious is the Royame / where in the blyssed saints reioy se them with
Ihesu Christ / and they cladde as in white aulbes follow always the lamb Now
of this world to come speaks saint Austyn in his book of the debate by twix
virtues and vices saying The love of this prelence world is departed from me /
for there is no creature / but he must nedys fynysshe and dye here. Hit all
other wise of the love of the world / that is to come. In the which all be
so vyuyfyed / that they can never dye after therein. And therein is none
aduersyte / no trouble / none anguysshe no pain / no disease ennoyng. nor
werynesse. but therein reygnen sempyter nall Joys. The Psalter says. The Just
folks eten and drynken / and reioysen them in the presens of our lord
delycynge them in gladness. And all sorrow and waylynges flees from them It
is written in Thapocalyps the.xxi. chapitre. Our lord shall dry the teeres of
their eyes. Moreover / there shall be then no weeping. saying. sorrow. nor death.
for all that shall be passed before. Isaye says in his.xxv. chapitre. Our
lord shall take away the teeres of every face / and shall take away the
repreuys of his people in every land / and then the folks shall say Here is
our lord god / whom we have abyden which shall save us / we have sustained
and suffered for him. And therefore we rejoice us with and by him in salvation. O
how great shall be that Ioyeful gladness to those that shall be gloryfyed not
oonly in loule / but also in body It is written in Isaye the.lxi. chapitre. They
shall be double possessed in their land. And in the Prouerbis the last
chapitre is written. All his famylyare husholde servants shall be cladde
double. That is to wit with two aulbes yt one is the body. which they now
possede. tho there the soul. and they shall not oonly have Joy of their own
proper good werkis. but also syngulerly of the merytes of the happy saints.
Our lord says in Iheremye the xxxiii. chapitre. I shall enhabyte them
assuredly / and they shall be my people. I shall be their god. and shall gyne
them an heart and a soul* not oonly by the unity of substance / but by the
boside of charyce. Behold me right dear friends / if the soul of a martyr /
of a confessor / of a virgyn and youres be allones Consequently it seems that
ye shall rejoice you in their Joys and that your souls shall be semblable unto
the apostles or any other saints. Saint Gregory says how charity shall be so
plenteuously there that that will. which he has not for him self. he shall
rejoice in seeng an other to have it. Certeynly those merueylous and manyfolde
Joys can never enter man's heart here and there every heart shall be
replenysshed and fulfilled with them. For wtin and without / above and
benethen. and in every part the happy souls shall merueylously reioy se them.
In the Inward part by the pureness of their conscyences. In the outward
part by the gloryfyeng of their bodies. In the lower part by the renouelyng
beautees of the heuens and of the creatures there. In the highest part by the
clear and vysyble syghte of our lord god. And in all other parts by the
Ioyefull and delectable company of all the saints of heaven. Now trewely there
is no man that can ymagyne or think the gretenesse of the Joys yt be there. I
ne can tell the reioysyng of the Inhabyta^tes in henen reygnynge there among
the angels of our lord god perpetuelly. It is written in the Gospel of Sayn
te Mathewe in the.xxv. chapitre. Enter thou in to the Joy of thy lord / enter
thy self in to that Joy / and with all thine heart enter therein Of those
Inmesurable quantytees of the celestial Joys speaks Saint Bernarde in his
book of Medytacyons. Their gladness has all thing in possessyon / therein all
festynges be possessyd. and the men accompanied with angels shall remain
there perpetuelly without having any manner fleshly Infyrmyte. There is
infynyte Ioyousnes / there is sempyternall beatytude / and after ye one is there
to receive it / he shall remain therein perdurably / there is rest without
labor / peace and frenshyp without envy. quietenes and surete without dangere
and the most pleasant swe tenesse in the vysyon of our lord god. Saint
Bernarde says. The Joys and sweetness of that contree is so great / that if
a man were therein but oonly ye space of an hour all the Joys and delectacyons
of this present life might comparabyly by Reason be myspraysed. and al Joys
swecenes and beautees yt could be thought and had here / be but pains
bytternesses and fylthes in regard of those / right as the might and bou^te
of our lord god excedeth and surmou^theth all other worldly thyngis O good
lord god / what have I wylled to have in this er the when in heaven al things
should be much more desired than any power here. gold. sylner. or any
precious stones. Now what shall I more say of this contree and holy Cite of
Iherusalem where in the streets is songen Incessantly Alleluya with Ioyouse and
sweet melodyous tunes. As is written in Thoby the.xiii. chapitre. It is red also
in Isay the.li. chapitre. xlll Joy and gladness shall be founden in ye contree
with accyons of graces and voices of louynges and all shall say in his Temple
/ loving honor and glory be to the lord. And therefore the voys of gladness
and health shall sown in the tabernacles of Just folks. In the Cite of our
lord sown contynuelly thorgons of the saints / which have utterly forgeten
the trybulaco^ns pains / labors / and wretchednesses of this world using in
enioyeng the celestyall bliss. O how swetely / how pleasantly. and how
clearly sing those in delasol that before have wept in gammoth and in are. Of
this Cite speaks Saint Austyne in his book of medytacyons saying. O cite /
which is a celestyall house and a sure contr^e containing all thing / that
may cause delect acyon. There is thynhabytyng of rest. The people is there
without murmour or grouge. O how many glorious things be said of this Cite.
the Inhabytacyon of our lord is in the as in a thing enioyenge all good
things. There is peace / pity / bounte / clerenes / light / virtue / honest /
glory / rest / loving / love / good concord / Joy / swetences / blys / and
perdurable life. Of all those and the perdurable life shall the happy souls be
certain and sure without any lesyng thereof. Isaye says in his.xxxii.
chapitre. There shall be surete for ever. Ezechyell says in his.xxxviii.
chapitre. They shall inhabyte fermely in eternyte without any manner of fere.
It is read in the Proverbs of Solomon in the first Chapitre. He that has
well herkened / shall rest without fere and enjoy in habundance. Saint
Austyn says. That the eternal surete enourneth and fulfylleth the beatytudes
of all the celestyall goodnesses. where if that sempyternyte should faylle /
all the other celestyall goodnesses be they never so sweet / should be the
less to be praised. Saint Johan says in his xviii. chapitre. In assuring us
/ there is no man that shall bereue you your Joy. O house of our lord. Cite
of the great king / how Innumerable and how great be thine eternal Joys with
the manyfold gladnesses of those happy souls yt be enhabyted with the. Now
surely lord they be well blyssed that be Inhabyted in thyn house in loving the
during the world of worlds. who is he having an hole Remembrance that is
so Ignorant / that he thinks not that all the company of heaven loves the
not dyuynely in heaven. The assurance of this perpetrell celestyale Joy and
gladness may be understand in that / that it is compared unto the olyfe
tree. As Ozee says in his.xiiii. chapitre. His glory shall be like an olyfe
tree. which is and contynueth grene winter and somer. Of this eternal glory
says also Johan Crysostom in his book of the Reparacion of the fall of man.
How great shall the voluptuoulnesse be / how great shall the Joy and gladness
be to the soul to be with Ihesu criste reco^^ned to his proper generacyon and
assuredly and vndoubtely to behold and see our lord. The gretenesse nor the
quantyte of that Ioyeful blys can not be told nor recyted. For one reioyseth
him not oonly of that well and pleaser that he uses and has presently in
oeure / but much more by cause he may be sure. Those Joys pleasers and blys
shall never admynyshe nor end. Loo who is he that shall be partyner to that
Joy / which is endeles. Certain it is ordained for folks / lords and other
shall rejoice them in the glory of our lord that have followed his traces in
this world / whereby they shall reygne with him gloryfyed worshypped and
crowned eternally in heaven. O my right well-beloved brethern how gretely shall ye
rejoice you / if ye be transported unto that eternal glory Certain ye shall
say then^e in cryeng and singing as it is written in Isaye the.lxi. chapitre.
I glad and Ioyefull shall rejoice me in our lord / and my soul shall be
merry in my god / by cause he has cladde me with the vestyment of salvation. Of
truth as it is written in Job the xxii chapitre. Thou shall be habundant
then in the delectacyon of the most mighty lord / and shall lift up thyn
eyes toward god / and the light shall shine in thy ways Of this light is
written in Ecclesyastyco the.xi. chapitre. It is a delectable light to see the
son That is to understand Ihesu Christ. which to know and behold
perdurably passes and surmou^teth all the Joys of this world / and is no
meruayll. for that knowleche and vysyon is the fode glory and life sempyter
nall of the happy saints. Saint Johan says in his.xviii. chapitre. the
eternal life is this / to know the sool very god and Ihesu Christ / whom
thou sendest down in to this earth for our redempcyon. Now then he that
may obtain and come to that blysfull knowleche after dyuyne lecture and to
see god face to face / that shall be the most excellent Joy and a spryngyng
of all Ioyefull gladnesses. saint Bernard says in his sermon. Verayly that is
a true and a sovereign Joy / which is conceived and had not oonly by one
creature / but also by the creator and maker of all creatures / which Joy you
shalt have when he shall show the his face. wherefore the prophet de syryngly
said. Lord I require the / let me see thy gracyous face full of all Joy and
gladness Alas my delectacyon is prolon ged from me till I may have that great
well. and till I may be drawn unto god my savior / I shall shede teeres
night and day. Certainly the vysyon by the which our lord is seen face to
face is in the third heaven / and if it might be said / it is the paradyse of
thousand heuens / wherein the fontayne of clear water is seen by the happy
life. Isaye says in his.lx. chapitre Thou shall see then the face of our lord
/ and shalt be habundant in delectacyons and Joys sempyternally. O how good
art thou lord of Israel to them that have rightful hertes / which will
give them so great so rich and so pleasante Joys. My right dear brethern
ye here gladly speak of these delectacyons and Joys. and take pleaser therein.
Nevertheless ye ought not to be Ignorant to understand that the blessed
saints come never to these Joys / but by great pains and labors. Saint
Gregory seyth in his Omely The gretenesse of the rewards gives me courage /
and my labors ought not to fere me / for one may never atteyne to the great
rewards but by great labors. That noble prechour Saint Poull in the second
Pystle to Tymothe the second Chapitre says. How that there shall be none
crowned / but such as have manfully foughted. Verily every man shall receive
his Rewards / which shall be after his labors. There be diverse that will
not live well / and yet they desire to dye well. They may know the death of
saints is full precious in the presens of our lord / they may know also
when our lord has given rest to his souls they shall dwell in his heritage
permanentely by cause they have be those that always have followed him in
resystynge temptacyons. Many of you would regne with Ihesu Christ / but ye will
suffer no thing for his sake. Balaam ariolus was such one / for in
considering the castle of the childern of Israhell he intended the having of
the eternal beatytude / and said in himself. Dye my soul as Just folks
dye / and be my last things semblable unto theyrs / he delyted gretely their
glorious end / but he grouged to take their labors and pains where by they
had deserved the glory eternal. O god lord Ihesu we would gladdely regne
with the. Nevertheless we will not labor nor be partycypable to thy suffrances
Thou chaseste myserye and pouerte / and we have taken us unto voluptuousnesses
and delectacyons. Thou have taken upon the and suffered bytternesses and
sharpenesses to thy body / and we have chosen and followed our sensuale
pleasyrs. Saint Bernarde said. The sone of god is borne / to whoos will was
granted all that might please him. He chose to be borne in the most grievous
time / and the blessed lityll babe borne of a poor mother uneath having
clothes to wrappe and cover it in the crybbe. Certainly Ihesu Christ / which
never is deceived chase that / ye most molested and grieved his flesh. Loo
then it is best swettest and most profitable to chese the bardeste pain in
this world. And who so ever amonesteth or techeth otherwise one ought to
beware of him and give him lityll credence. It was ones promised by Isaye a
lityll child / that could repreue the evil and chese the good. The evil was
the voluptuous pleaser of the body and the good was the pain and afflyccion
thereof. A truth this child is the sone of god / which chose thafflicco^ns
and repreued and forsook the voluptuous pleasers. As saint Bernard said. O
right dear child / thou haste chosen from thy beginning here corporal
affliccions / and in suffrance have entered into thy glory which was properly
thine owen / and we living in delectacions would enter in to that glory /
wherein we be but strangers and not dygne to come thither / but by thy grace.
There against speaks Saint Austyn saying. If it have behooved Ihesu criste
lord and king whose name is above all names to have suffered and thereby has
entered in to his eternal glory / what hope or trust shall we have to come
thither without suffrance / syther we be strangers / and can ha ue none enter
there but by him. O how folyshe and how hard herted we be trust in reioysyng
us in this world and after to regne with Ihesu crist in heaven / he entered
there in all naked / yet was he therein lord / and we would enter therein that
be alcharged with superfluous garnementis with richesse of gold and silver and
precious stones. He entered therein chaste and fasting and thou wylt enter therein
full of glotonye and lecherye. He dyed upon the cross for to redeem the / yt
delycyously slepeste in thy bed. Should then the servant have yt the master
had not and will not bye it as he deed Certeynly nay / and me thinks it were
a thing to unreasonable. Harken now what a Poet says. The lord has swet upon
the cross shall not the servant do the same. Now bear your cross for he has
borne his / taste of the vynegre as he deed. The reverence nor the ease of the
servant should not be more than that of the lord. If you wylt follow him you
must ensue his tourmentes / and hold for certain / thou can not come in
heaven by delytes and pleasyers. And therefore whenne thou shall pay onto our
lord thy de^^e of natural death which thou owe unto him. fle
voluptuousnes. break thy delytes / refrain thy flesh / and dye then^e in the
love of Ihesu criste. Saint Iherom says in a Pystle that he sent unto Iulyan
how it was a great diffyculte and a thing as is Impossyble a man to use and
have the welthe and pleasyer of this world pure / and also of that to come.
and that the fyllynge of his belly here should feed his soul / and that he
should from delytes and pleasers here / goo to delytes and pleasers there / and
that he should appear gloryfyed in both worlds. He seyth also in an other
place / that it is Impossyble a man to be habundant in worldely richesses / and
ensue Ihesu christ. For nature will not that two contraryes be meddled together.
Certaynely we may not both be servants unto god and to the devil. Other I
am deceived / or in the end they shall be begyled that byleueth it not. Think
how the richesses of this world turn to necessytees in the other world / the
dampened Dives ete and drank and lived delycyously werynge precious garnementes
here / but when he was deed / because he would not believe Moses / he
apperce^ued his defaultes and felt them well when he was in the torments of
hell / saint bernard showed this also by a speech yt was betwix Christ and
saint Peter. where he said thus Abraham said to the false rich gloton. Thou
have had many great welthes in thy life and ye lepre has suffered many pains*
but now he is in Joy and consolaco^n. and you art in pain and torment
everlasting / what shall we more say. After that we end so must we be Iuged
/ weeping is thextremyte of Joy and ye may not have Joy in this world by
aduersyte / but by aduersyte here ye may have theuerlastyng Joy Certain it is
manyfeste. that this worldly goods be not very goods another they be true
that so accept them. The sentence of Solomon is Just. His sentence is that it
is better to be in the house of lamentacyon / than in the house of worldely
felycyte. For those that in their life here have received worldly prosperytees
shall after therefore be tourmented / and for reioysynge in their consolacyons
here / is ordained them a sempyter nall pain / what may be the end of those
that have here so great multitude of solaces and pleasers. Doubteles no thing
but afflyccyons and sorrows. Consequentely thoos that reteyne the pleasyrs and
solaces of this world. that not with stondyng the universal tourmentes and
sorrows remaynen unto them. They have taken unto them the coragis of wretches /
and all such as their corages be led by their good angels / despise and
refuse the goods of this present life / and chose to suffer penance therein /
whereby they atteyne the goods of our lord with all solace. Saint Bernarde
seyth Let thy soul then renounce to be in consolacion here in this valleye
of teres myseres and sorrows for tourmentes and pains shall come unto those
that receive here their Joys and solaces. Now then dysprayse and despise
shoos transytory vanytees. and flee the worldely delectacyons and Joys / and
beware that thou gloryfye not thy self but in the cross of our lord Ihesu
Christ. Petre de bloys wroot unto a king of England upon the book of Job /
wenest thou that one may have Joy in this present life / and also in that /
that is to come. Nay* without his Joy here be sprengeled with bytternesse and
sorrow. Thou art deceived to presume to have perfayte Joy both here and
there to use this world and take the delytes thereof / and nevertheless to
obtain the richesse of the glory celestyall / and to Joy with Ihesu Christ.
Herkene more what is said in the Gospel by the rich man which was tourmented
in the fire of hell that desired a drope of water for the refresshyng of his
tongue. It was answered him. Thou haste received ye welthe of the world / and
Lazar the pain therefore he has now delectacyon and Joy / and thou art in
the pain and torment. The said Peter de bloys said / we might well repute and
call foles the holy kings and prophets / thapostles. the martyrs / the
confessors and the delycate and tender virgynes which all have myspraysed and
fled from the worldly richesses / and have offered and taken them to the
trybulaco^ns and shamous dethes for the love of Ihesu christ. If they might
have obtained by voluptuouse delectacions the Joys of heaven. which they have
not gotten but by an guys and pain in this world. Verily friends / what so
ever be said believe fermely and hold for certain. Ye shall never enter heaven
but by the ways that the dyscyples of Ihesu Christ have taught you. That is to
wit / by trybulacyons by good words / good works. and good faith. And what
have the dyscyples taught / have the not showed us to live so berly and Justly
and to reteyne with all our power / humylyte / charity / pacyence / constance
and all other virtues. to misprayse the world and all the parts thereof. to
flee richesses and delectacyons / to do penance / and vygorously to rejoice
in trybulaco^ns Now do then semblably after them and their doctrine / and ye
shall live for ever eternally. Be ye of constante corages in all your
anguysshes and labors having hope in the help of our lord / and he shall
soon hele and relyeue you. Labor manfully as good knights with Ihesu Christ
and weary not in your self saying. Our labors be great / and we so feeble /
that finally we may not persevere in this purpose. recomforte your self / and
herkene well the words of Saint Gregory saying. There ought no time be
thought long / nor any labor great / whereby is gotten the glory eternal. As
Johan Crisostome said upon the Gospel of Saint Mathewe. If ^^^e (...) he
have begone his Journey think the way laborous / he ought to be thought
slouthefull if the perylouse wa was of the sea be thought easy and sure to the
maroneis by the delectacyon that they have to their owen proufyte for winning
of temporal goods thereupon. Semblably the storms frostes and reins to the
laborers of therte for their winning / the wounds and strokes to the good
knights and champyons for their honor and auantage. if all these be thought
easy / much more pain ought to be taken without felyng any grouge for the
recover of the celestyall bliss / which is ordained for the Reward of them
that will deserve hit. Take none head of thy paynfull life here / but behold
wheder it will led the. Take Regard to the pleasant life here / but Remember
how soon it will faylle the. Trewely ye may well think that the royalme of
heaven is no thing appertinent unto slud gardes nor the eternal beatytude
ordained to recheles and yole folks. As Pope Lion said in a sermon. And the
Gospel of Saint Mathewe says the.xi. Chapitre. The Royalme of heaven is wonnen
in suffrynge of force and vyolence in this world. And it may well be byleued /
for Ihesu Christ said that suffryng vyolence geteth it A Pot said. Your
living must be sharp / your labor paynfull / and your clothing grievous
and so must all your other things be here / if ye will be lodged there
above in heaven. This may appear manyfestly unto you. Also in the Acts of the
Apostles the.xiiii. chapitre is written. How our enter in to heaven must be by
many trybulacyons. O how well was it understand by Saint Austyn That one may
not enter the bliss of heaven but by trybulacyon and pain in this world. For
he said. A my soul if we should always supporte and sustain tourmentes and
pains here. and also suffer by a long space the gehenne of hell / to the end
that we might there by surely see our lord Ihesu Christ in his glory and be
accompanied with his saints. Now were it not an excellent dygne thing to
have so great a well / as to be partyners to so parfayte a glory. Petrede
bloys said. My members faylle me by age / and be enfebled by fastings / and
broken with labors / and I melte with teeres of mine eyes. But if all my brayn
and the mary of my boones were converted in to teeres / yet were it not
suffysant passion in this present time in comparyson to atteyne thereby the
glory to come / which shall be showed unto us. If a man knew what thing he
is / and what it is of him and of god / he would think that suffryng of
thousand dethes for his sake were but as no thing. Behold now how good and
how proufytable it is to suffer penance for our lords sake. Sustain it then
gladly and endure it benygnely taking an example by morderers and theuys
condemned to death. which would gretely rejoice them self. if they might by
the hyttyng of of one of their eres have their lives saved. Rejoice your self
semblably in great gladness / for in doing of a little penance here ye may
escape and exclude the death of your souls and win the eternal Joy. Then
thou man that art mortal suffer for to atteyne the life that to perpetuell /
such pain as thou would endure for to save thy self temporal / which is
in incertayne and of little enduryng. To this purpose it is written in
Ecclesiastico the.vi. chapitre. Thou shalt a little labor / and here in this
world is the lytlenesse of penance. and thou shall soon ete and drink the
generacyon thereof / that is to understand ye fruytes of the glory / which be
engendered with the labor of penance. It is written in the book of Sapyence
the.iii. chapitre. yt that be weary of a little / yet dyspose you well and your
Remuneracion and reward shall be right great. Saint Effram said. My right
dear and beloved brethern / the labor of our instytucyon is but little / and
the rest is great / our afflyccyon dureth not long. but our Retrybucyon /
that is to wit / the delytes of paradyse. The Joy and gladness there shall
endure world withouten end. The wise man said in Ecclesyastes the last
Chapitre. Behold how little I have labored / and I have found for me great
Rest. By the Reasons above written it appears manyfestely / that though our
labors here be but little and good / our Rewards in heaven may be great and
many / for the Joys there are Impossyble to be comprehended or declared by us
/ for there was never erthely heart that could ymagine the pleasers thereof /
nor to any comparyson eye could see / nor ere here the delectacyons melodyes
and swetnesses that be there / and the goodnesses Iwys can not here dyrectely
be sauoured nor felt / but it may well be surely thought / that all that ever
is felt delectable or good in this present world is but as the
resplendysshynge and a shadow of the goodness of heaven / which we ought to
take as an allec tyfe desyryng to come to the orygynall and rote there of / and
to have part of that most precious bliss / which is our enherytance. Now in
concludynge finally it may appear by great euydence and Inuynsyble reasons.
that the four last things above alleged / which is to wit / the bodily
death / ye day of Judgment / the gehenne of hell / and the glory of peradyse
defenden and withdrawn from sin in many manners / such as have the same four
last things withouten oblyuyon in a contynuale Remembrance. Where by they
acceyne and edytye their souls to remain eternally in the most glorious blys
of heaven. And whenne any fall to sin / it is by cause they have not the
said four things cordyally emprynted in their minds. And alas nor the
suffrance of our lord. There be to few that consider and poyse the said four
last things. Many there be that think to live long / and to repent them in
their age / and there by appeyse the Judge and flee the danger of hell And in
that hope live in delectacyons and idleness. And yet after they think so
possede heaven eternally. O what presumptuous folly is hit to believe and trust
thereto. That argument concludes not / but mocketh and deceyueth all such / as
have hope or confydence therein. Therefore do penance to your salvation / or
ye shall peryshe and dye in your sins to your dampnacyon. It is written in
Ecclesyastes in the second chapitre. If we do no penance / we shall fall
in the hondes of onre lord. and not in to the ho^des of man. Alas now who is
he that suffysantely bewayleth his sins / that has good pacyence with his
enmye / yt has compassyon upon the poor people / and relyeueth them in their
necessytees / that duly mynystred Justice / and that for no vain glory ne
lucie of the world will offend his conscience Our generacyon is so wretchyd
and so frail that our hertes can not address to the well / but rather to the
harm / we favor and delight worldely things / and seek not after Ihesu
Christ / we love vices / we flee virtues / and lie and rest in our owen sins
as beestes do in their owen dounge / and therein rote myserably. Our lord
lokoth upon the sone of man / and beholds if there be any axinge grace or in
good dysposycyon / but well away he sees to few Inclyned thereto / and many
dysposed to the contrary in all sin and wretchedness / where by is to be
drad / that the miserable time of this world is nyghe comen / which Mycheas
prophesied of in his.vii. Chapitre saying. Holiness is perysshed in the earth
/ and among the men is there none that is right wise. O Remember well how
every man almoost now a days seeks for his owen particular cause and lucre /
the shedyng of blood and the wrongynge of other / what shall I more say / few
there be that will entende to any good perfeccyon / nor open their eyes for
their saluaco^n / so be they blinded in their malycyous folly. O cursed malice
and unhappy folly. whereby the life is voluntarely lost. and the death won.
the well despised. and the harm accepted / our lord dyspleased / and the
fend obeyed. Now then my right dear brethern and friends stryke not of your
hedes with your own swerdes / as to say / let not your owen deeds be your
destruction perpetual. Rise out of sin. look up and remember you what
oyfference is betwix eternale dampnacyon and perpetuale Joy and bliss.
Forsake and renounce your sins / and defend you from the fendes power /
which ye may surely do with contrycyon / and in axinge help and grace of our
lord. Iwys it is meruayll that man / which above all erthly thing is a
creature reasonable ensues not the verayorygynall of reason / but dysprayseth
and forsakes that / that is most proufytable and eternally good for that /
that is mortale and most harmefull. O good lord what unhap causes it / and
werfore should we by our folly lose tho souls that thou have bought so dear
with thy most precious blood. Certaynely the cause is lack of prudence /
good counseyll / grace / and cordyall Remembrance of the said four last
things. O our Redemptour almighty and merciful Ihesu / grant us so thy
grace / that we may yet surely purueye for our last things / and so cordyally
frequente the Remembrance of thy godhede that it cause us here after to
repelle and reuoque our sins. Resyste our goostely enemy / and conform us
in all good works unto thy blessed will / to the obteynynge finally with the
happy saints of thine eternal glory. To which bring us the fader / and the
sone / and the holy ghost reygnyng in unity sempyternally world withouten end.

THis book is thus translated out of frenshe in to our maternall tongue by the
noble and virtuous lord Anthony Earl Ryuyres. Lord Scales and of the Isle
of wight. De fensour and dyrectour of the ^uses Apostolyque for our holy fader
the Pope in this Royame of England Uncle and governor to my lord prince of
Wales / which book was delivered to me wyllyam Caxton by my said noble lord
Ryueires on the day of puryfycacyon of our blessed lady falling the tewsdaye
the second day of the month of Feuerer. In the year of our lord a.
M..CCCC. and.lxxviii. for to be enprynted / and so multyplyed to goo abrood
among the people / that thereby more surely might be Remembered the four last
things vndoubtably coming. And it is to be uoted that sythen the time of the
great tribulaco^n and aduersyte of my said lord / he has been full virtuously
occupied / as in go^ynge of pylgremages to Saint James in in Galyce / to Rome /
to Saint Barthylme we / to Saint Andrewe / to Saint Mathewe / in the Royalme
of Naples. and to Saint Nycholas de Bar in Puyle. and other diverse holy
places. Also he has procured and gotten of our holy fader the Pope a great and
a large Indulgence and grace unto the chapel of our lady of the Pyewe by
Saint Stephens at Westmestre for the relyef and help of christian souls
passed out of this tra^sytorye world / which grace is of like virtue to
thindulgence of Scala celi. And not withston dyng the great labors and chargis
that he has had in the service of the king and of my said lord prince /
as well in wales as in England which has be to him no little thought and
besynes both in spyryte and in body / as the fruit thereof experymently
shows. yet over that tenriche his virtuous dysposycyon / he has pnt him in
deuoyr at all times when^e he might have a leyser / which was but starmele
to translate diverse books out of frenshe in to english. Among other passyd
thorugh mine hand the book of the wise sayenges or dystes of philosophers /
and the wise and holsom prouerbys of xprystene the pyse set in meter. Over
that has made diverse balades against the seven dedely sins. Furthermore it
seems that he conceyueth well the mutabylyte and the unstableness of this
present life. and that he desires with a great zele and spyrytuell love our
goostly help and perpetuell salvation. And that we shall abhor and utterly
forsake the abhomynable and dampnable sins. which comunely be used now a
days / as Pride / periurye / terryble sweryng / theft / murder / and many
other. Wherefore be took upon him the translatynge of this present work named
Cordyall / trusting that both the reders and the herers there of should know
themself herafter the better / and amend their living or they depart and
lose this time of grace to the recover of their salvation. Which Translatynge
in my Judgment is a noble and a merytoryous deed / wherefore he is worthy to be
gretely commended / and also syngulerly Remembered with our good prayers. For
certaynely as well the reders as the herers well conceyuyng in their hertes the
forsayde four last things may there by greatly be prouoqued and called from
sin to the great and plenteuous mercy of our blyssed savior / which mercy
is above all his works. And no man being contryte and confessed needs to
fere the obteynynge thereof / as in the preface of my said lords book made by
him more plainly it appears. Then in obeynge and following my said lords
commandment. In which I am bounded so to do / for the manyfolde benefetes
and large rewards of him had and received of me undeserved. I have put me
in deuoyr taccomplysshe his said desire and com maundemente / whom I beseech
almighty god to keep and mayntene in his virtuous and laudable acts and
works. And send him thaccomplyssnemente of his noble and Joyous delyres and
pleasers in this world. And after this short dangerous and transytory life
everlasting permanence in heaven. Amen. Which work present I began the morn
aiter the said Puryfycacyon of our blyssed Lady. Which was the day of Saint
Blase Bishop and Martyr And fynysshed on the even of the Annuncyacyon of our
said blessed Lady falling on the wennesdaye the four and twenty day of
March. In the.xix. year of hynge Edward the fourth.
