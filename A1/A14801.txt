MICROBIBLION OR THE BIBLES EPITOME: In Verse.

Digested according to the Alphabet, that the Scriptures we read may more
happily be remembered, and things forgotten more easily recalled.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable his singular good Lord, Sir William Spencer Knight,
Baron Spencer of Wormeleighton, and to his Honorable Lady: Simon Wastell
wishes increase of honor in this life, and eternal happiness in the world to
come.
RIght Honorable; Excellent is that sentence which Agapetus wrote to Justinian
the Emperor long ago, viz It is the crown of Fi^^ie which adornes a
Potentate; for riches (...) with us, and glory vanishes (says he) (...) that
renown, but that care of leading (...) lives according to Gods will, has the
promise of a Reward everlastingly permanent, and of a Crown immarcessible. And
such has been Gods mercy to your Honors, that he has accumulated both
internal and external blessings upon you, adding to your temporal greatness,
spiritual graces, which make your Honors far more amiable in Gods sight, then
any terrene (though transcendent) felicity can make you admired in the sight
of men. The very Ethnicke could say, Nobilitas sola est atque vnica virtus. If
the glimmering light of their purblind intellectualls, could appropriate such
like Panegy rickes, only to their Moral and Socraticall virtues, how great
are those praises which are due to those Theological and heavenly graces,
which by a more divine Spirit, are breathed into the souls of David's Saints on
earth: Wherein though your Honors endowments have not the meanest portion (they
not being in you, mean, but even Heroical,) yet lest I should seem (as the
manner of some Dedicatory Epistle is) to make my way to your Honor by a
Parasiticall salutation of all your resplendent virtues in my passage, and lest
I do therein offend your right Noble and magnanimous disposition, whose
property it is not to be very much affected with those your deserved praises;
and because also the action in me would be cozen-German to base flat^erie: I
therefore pass them by in silence, whereat my mind shall never cease to afford
the due tribute of perpetual admiration. May it therefore please your Honor
(as formerly it pleased your worthy Father my good Lord, now deceased) to
patronize this little work, which with all submission I present unto your
Honors. Sure I am, that those manifold favors which I (unworthy I) from time
to time have received from him and you, may challenge requital; which to be
performed by me is impossible, and to be testified by so small and slender a
Dedication is in a manner indecent, as being in no ways proportionable to your
large and copious demerits. But I am somewhat encouraged to make it travel
under your Honors Patronage. I know that in all ingenuous and heavenly
begotten souls, there is an affection in some sort analogical to God himself,
of accepting the desire for the deed* Receive it therefore I beseech you, it is
performed as I could, not as I would; (...) your Honor look to the matter of
that book, it is an Epitome of Gods Oracles, and contains some of that aqua
coelestis, or living waters of life and grace: If to the manner of handling the
matter, it is brief, and Alphabeticall, and metricall, for the better and
surer memory. Plain also it is because the pure and spiritual word needs not
the mixture of man's depraved brain; and also because the simplest Christian
may reap the greater benefit, when all things are done to edification. Thus
presuming upon your Honorable protection, and entreating the Almighty, that in
blessing he would bless both your Honors, and honorable Progeny, I humbly
take my leave.

Your Honors ever to be commanded, SIMON WASTALL

To the Christian READER.
IT is the speech of all, almost, and the complait of the most sincere, that
these our last and worst days, are days very wicked, days very dangerous,
and therefore surely very dangerous, because very wicked; yet if we look to the
means of knowledge and of piety, never time enjoyed larger, or better: Great
is Gods mercy, small our amendment. And where is the fault? why our own
consciences do condemn us, as delinquents, who will not receive that which
Gods mercy would afford us. Christ may now take up his Elegies against England,
as once against Jerusalem, How often O England, England, would I have gathered
thee as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but thou would not. I
have sent my Ambassadors to declare my good will and pleasure to thee, and my
love which I reserve for thy people, if ye would return, but thou would not.
I have often knocked at the door of thy heart for entrance, that thou might
be enriched with my Spirit, but thou would not. I have offered thee, that,
ask and thou shall have, knock, and I will open unto thee, but thou would
not. I have exhorted thee to crucify those carnal lusts, which fight against
thy soul, but thou would not. I have been crucified, dead, and buried,
that by believing in me thou might have life, but thou would not. I have
ascended from death to life, that by my example thou might rise from the
death of sin to the life of grace here, and to glory hereafter, but for all
this thou would not. These or such like words might Christ justly use to the
most part of the men of England, whose ignorance is almost gross and affected,
and whose knowledge (except it be practiced) will but augment their
condemnation: for this is condemnation, that the light is come into the world
amongst us, and we love darkness more then light. We know indeed our Masters
will, but will not do it. Or if we have but so much of the gold of the
Sanctuary as will tip our tongues, and guild over our external carriage, we
think we have enough; whereas the heart was requisite in every sacrifice, and
that being first formed, and given us of God first, should be reformed first
and given of us to God again. But alas, most men now content themselves to
live in this our Church which hates Idolatry, and popish superstition, and
think this will be sufficient to flit them to heaven after death whereas
(poor souls) they ought as well to look to the truth of their profession, as
to their profession of the truth, lest he, who is the Way, the Truth and the
Life, do for their want of truth, deny them the way to everlasting life. But if
these men, or any other, would in sincerity, see footing into the ways of
Gods commands, it is then necessary, necessitate a priori, that they first know
what it is which God commands: now this is revealed unto us in his word, and
his word must be a light to our feet, and a lantern to our paths, we must
talk of this when we rise up, and when we lie down, and meditate therein day
and night, which that we may do, we must labor (Christian Reader) to get it
into our memories: and to this purpose, at also for a direction to our whole
life, is this little Breuiary of the holy Scripture composed into this form,
which if it profit, let all the praise be given to him, who is the Author of
every good and perfect work. Now if any yet desire to be more curious in
prying into the strictness of the Chronology, I refer such to Herlinus,
Gemma Fabri, Funccius, Beroaldus, Broughton, Pantaleo^, Schubertus, Cariom,
Lodowick LLoyd, Bucholcerus, and others that have professedly undertaken that
task: As for the Grecian computation by Olympiads, and the Caldean, Assyrian,
Egyptian and Persian Chronologers, let them agree with them no further then
they agree with the holy writ which was 2000. years before any of them. Thus
entreating thy charitable censure, well-wishing, and prayers, I bid thee
farewell, resting

Thine in any Christian service that he can perform, S. W.

In commendation of this Work.
TO keep us blameless what excuse have we
If ignorant in Gods Commands we be?
Since to inform us, what his pleasure is,
So many helps we have that others miss:
And are not now compelled to go seek
The hard phraz'd Hebrew, nor the copious Greek,
For, God speaks English to us; and assayes
To work true knowledge in us diverse ways.
Some men interpret, some again expound:
And this our Author here, a means has found
To help the Memory: And not in vain
If others add endeavor to his pain.
Peruse it Reader. And so mindful be
Of that, whereof this Book remembers thee;
That others in thy life, may copyed find,
What thou art hereby taught to bear in mind.

to younger wives (he says)
KEepers at home, chaste and discreet,
they must in any case
Still show themselves, lest Christ's Gospel
by them should have disgrace.
LIkewise young men are bid to live
in all sobriety:
And Titus must a pattern be
of godly gravity.
MAsters must be obeyed and pleased
of servants taking pain;
Showing forth all fidelity;
not answering again.
NOte that Gods grace has now appeared,
and reaches us to fly
Ungodliness and worldly lusts,
and so live soberly:
Our Savior still looking for,
who was content to dye:
That he might save us, and our souls
from sin might purify*
Chapt. 3

and but them all in mind

and to be meek and kind.
QVicke, ready, forward eke to be
to every godly deed,
And that they should in goodness still,
and gentleness proceed.
RElating that even he himself,
was in times past most vile,
Living in all licentiousness,
in malice, envy, guile:
Serving his lusts, until Gods love,
and Christ's did plain appear;
Not by the works (...) done,
but of his mercy mere.
THat Christ he says has saved us
by true regeneration,
Washing us in his blood, and by
the spirits renouation,
Upon us richly which he shed,
that be our souls, might save,
And justify us by his grace,
eternal life to have.
Advised is Titus this to teach,
that who in God believe
Should carefully show forth good works,
and in his fear should live.
But foolish questions all should hate,
of fruitless brawlings vain;
An heretic twice warned they must
reject, avoid, disdain.
COndemned eu^n in his own heart,
and of himself he is:
He bid, that Titus should with speed,
come to Nicopolis.
DEclaring that he purposed there

IN loving sort he calls them babes,
and writes to this end:
That they no more should live in sin,
but sinful manners mend.
Known this he makes yet to us all,
and it believe we must,
That if we

Loving us, he is for our sins
the reconciliation;
Yea for all faithful in

MAde sure hereof we are hereby,
and that we know

and walk as in his sight.
NOte him that says he knows him,
and yet does not obey
His precepts, that man has no

Observe that he that keeps his word,

In him is perfect, he is in Christ;
we need not doubt nor dread.
PVrely (as Christ did) must he walk;
no sin his life
That says, that he is joined with Christ,
and does in him remain.
QVestionlesse, no new command

But that same word

Because that both in Christ and us
it is apparent true.
Since that the darkness now is past,
and light does shine
He wills us walk as sons of light,
and darksome sins refrain.
THat man that says he is in light,
and does his brother hate;
He is in sinful

Unto his brother who is kind,
and loves him with his heart;
He bides in light, and with no evil;
will such a man take part.
AS for that man that brother hates,
in darkness still he lies;
He knows not whither he goes,
darkness does blind his eyes.

That he might sin destroy in his,

SO that in him that is borne of God,

Because his

THus are Gods children known from Devils,

Unto you all, and unto us,

Dear love we have perceived from Christ,

So ought we to
to do our brethren good.
Esteem him void of Christian love,
that has this earthly good,
And sees his brother stand in need,
and will not give him food.
FRom sincere hearts, in deed and truth,
he bids us show our love,
And not in word and tongue alone,
which does but fained prove.
GOds Sons we know ourselves to be,
by love and charity,
And have assurance
before his Majesty.
HE bids us here look to our hear^,
if they shall us accuse:
God (who is greater then our hearts)
will not one sin excuse.
IF that our hearts condemn
with God we may be bold
To ask and have:
does from his sons with hold.
KNow what this his commandment is;
it is faith in Christ to have,
And that we one another love,
as he commandment gave
Learn that in him that keeps his Jaws,

And by that spirit given to us,
we know this thing full well.

BEfore my face the Picture hangs,
That daily should put me in mind
Of those cold qual^^es and bitter pangs,
That shortly I am like to find.
But yet alas, full little J
Do think hereon that I must dye.
I often look upon the face
Most ugly, grisly, bare, and thin;
I often view the hollow place,
Where eyes and nose had sometimes bin:
I see the bones, a cross that lie,
Yet little think that I must dye.
I read the Label underneath,
That tells me whereto I must:
I see the sentence eke that says,
Remember man that thou art dust.
But yet alas but seldom I
Do think indeed that I must dye.
Continually at my beds head
An hearse does hang which does me tell,
That I ere morning may be dead,
Though now I feel my self full well:
But yet alas for all this I,
Have little mind that J must die.
The Gown which I do use to wear,
The knife wherewith I cut my meat,
And eke that old and ancient chair,
Which is my only usual seat,
All these do tell me I must dye,
And yet my life amend not I.
My Ancestors are turned to clay,
And many of my mates are gone,
My yongers daily drop away,
And can I think to escape alone,
No, no, J know that I must dye,
And yet my life amend not I.
Not Solomon for all his wit,
Nor Sampson though he were so strong,
No King nor person ever yet
Could escape, but death laid him along:
Wherefore J know that I must dye,
And yet my life amend not I.
Though all the East did ^ake to hear
Of Alexanders dreadful name:
And all the West did likewise fear
To hear of Julius Caesar's fame:
Yet both by death in dust do lie,
Who then can escape, but he must dye.
If none can escape Deaths dreadful dart,
If rich and poor his beck obey,
If strong, if wise, if all do smart,
Then I to escape shall have no way.
O grant me grace, O God that I
My life may mend, since I must dye.

LIke as the Damask Rose you see,
Or like the blossom on the tree,
Or like the dainty flower of May,
Or like the morning to the day,
Or like the Sun; or like the shade,
Or like the Gourd which Jonas had.
Even such is man, whose thread is spun,
Drawn out and cut, and so is done:
The Rose withers, the blossom blasteth,
The flower fades, the morning hastes.
The Sun sets, the shadow flies,
The Gourd consumes, and man he dies.
Like to the Graffe that's newly sprung,
Or like a tale that's new begun,
Or like the bird that's here to day,
Or like the pearled dew of May,
Or like an hour, or like a span
Or like the singing of a Swan.
Even such is man, who lives by breath,
Is here, now there, in life, and death:
The Grass withers, the tale is ended,
The bird is flowne, the dew's ascended,
The hour is short, the span not long,
The Swan's near death, man's life is done.
Like to the bubble in the brook,
Or, in a Glass, much like a look:
Or like a shuttle in Weauers hand,
Or like the writing on the sand,
Or like a thought, or like a dream,
Or like the glyding of the stream:
Even such is man, who lives by breath,
Is here, now there, in life, and death.
The Bubble's cut, the looke's forgot,
The Shuttle's flung, the writing's blot:
The thought is past, the dream is gone,
The water glides, man's life is done.
Like to an Arrow from the Bow,
Or like swift course of watery flow,
Or like the time twixt flood and ebb,
Or like the Spiders tender web;
Or like a race, or like a Gole,
Or like the dealing of a dole.
Even such is man, whose britle state
^s always subject unto fate:
The Arrowe's shot, the flood soon spent,
The time no time, the web soon rent:
The race soon run, the Goal soon won,
The dole soon dealt, Man's life first done.
Like to the lightning from the sky,
Or like a Post that quick does hie,
Or like a quauer in short song,
Or like a Journey three days long;
Or like the Snow when Summer's come,
Or like the Pear, or like the Plum.
Even such is man, who heaps up sorrow,
Lives but this day and dies to morrow
The Lightning's past, the Post must go,
The Song is short the Iourney's so,
The Pear does rot, the Plum does fall,
The Snow dissolues, and so must all.
