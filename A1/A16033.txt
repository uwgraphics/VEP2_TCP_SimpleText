Ihesus clamabat (Qui habet aures audiendi audiat) Luc. viij.
These words ben written in the gospel of this day. And thus to be
englysshed. Ih^u our savior made a proclamaco^n with a high and great voice
to the people that came to here him / saying. Every man which has eeres of
herynge may if he be well dysposed here what is said unto him. Bid says that
these words ben often time repetyd both in the gospelles and in the appocalypsis
/ and has in them great mysterye of ye pleasure of god almighty. Saint Ierom
in the chapter upon John shows that all the sermons and prechynges that
Christ Ihesu made he said them (cu^ magno clamore) by the which he certyfyed
the people that he preched unto the great zele and affection that he had to the
well of there souls / and that they should be desirous to here the word of god
/ by the which they should be delivered fro all mortalyte and be made by it
(filias dei per adopcione^) Five proclamaco^ns specially made by Christ Ih^u. I
note in his holy gospelles / which ben of that auctoryte / that who so ever
wol not here them and endeavor him to keep them / shall never come to
everlasting Joy. Wherefore friends give better eere and take more head to
them. The first proclamaco^n I note in the gospel of this day where he called
the people that came fro cytees / towns and borughes / and showed to them a
parable of sede which was sow in diverse places not conuenyent for the
growing thereof / and perysshed / but yt which was sow in good tylth and earth
/ multeplyed and encresed meruayllously to the great riches of him that sewe
it. Christ Ihesu calls this sede his word by the which all thing is made
and multeplyed and has their being as it is written. i. q. i. Inter
catholicam. Oi^m reru^ recreacio et oi^m recreacio fuit in verbo. Psalm. Verbo
dm^ celi firmati su^t. Et gene. i. Dixit et facta sunt. et. xxxiij. q. h. c.
Quid ergo. And right as seeds sow brings forth infenyte corn to the
sustenau^ce of man. Right so the word of god sown in man's soul brings
forth infenyte virtues / as is noted. i. q. i. c. (Interrogo vos) Man is the
perfeccyon of the hole work of god. He made heaven and creatures celestyall
Inuysyble to us that be mortal creatures here in earth. And made man and other
creatures here in earth terrestryall / but the perfecco^n of his work is the
coniuncco^n of the soul which is celestyall / to the body that is
terrestryall / for the which body all thing that is made here in earth / as
tree / fruit / beestes / foul and fysshe and all other are create to feed and
serve the body the body to serve the soul / and the soul oonly to serve
almighty god. And therefore it is written (de penitencijs did. i. recreatus.
Sicut ai^a est vita corporis. ita deus est vita ai^e) And right as almighty god
has purueyed for mete to the sustenaunce of the body / in like wise he has
ordained spyrytuall meet for the sustenau^ce of the soul / which is his
word / as he says Math. iiijo. (and written extra de officio. or. c. Inter
cetera. Non i^ solo pane viuit homo. sed in o^ni verbo quoth procedit de ore dei)
By the virtue of his blessed word / he has ordained yt the materyall bread
which fedeth the body / shall be transformed in to his flesh and blood / and
it to be most precious mete to feed ye soul of man. Therefore Dauyd says in
the psalm. Afferte dn^o. Vox dm^ in magnificencia. That is to be understand /
that the voys of the word of our lord has ye virtue of magnyfycence / that
is when his servant in due form according to his law ordened and says the
words upon the materyall bread / there is that magnyfycence in the words that
inco^tynenty / that which was materyall bread is converted in to his flesh /
and the materyall wine in to his blood. Which season the angels in heaven in
ye Immolacyon ben there present in mynystrynge and doing sacrefyce to their
maker / as it is written (de con. did. ij. Quis fideliu^) And of this ye should
not greatly marvel. For a young maiden our lady saint Mary when she said
these. v. words. Fiat michi scdm verbu^ tuu^. God and man were knytte together
in her womb. And so (verbu^ caro factu^ est) In likewise when ye priest says
these. v. words (hoc est em^ corpus meu^) there is together in that materyall
host god and man / the same which was born of our lady and hanged upon the
cross / that rose from death to life and ascended to heaven. And is and shall be
(iudex viuorum et mortuorum) And all faithful christian men which in true life
and faith ben fed with it (viuu^t i^ eternu^) And so it is (viaticu^) to
strength man's soul to come (ad monte^ oreb) to the presence of the trynyte
Deus fecit ex bonitate celu^ and terra^. ex conpassione redemit genus hu^anu^.
ex permissione misit in terra^ spm^ scm^. et ex sua su^ma caritate quotidie
pascit nos eius corpere and sangui^e vt essemus caro de carne eius et os de
ossibus) So friends who so hereth this proclamaco^n thus made by the sone of
god / and called to ete of this blessed meet and will not / he shall never
come to heaven. The second proclamaco^n that Christ made is written (John. vijo.
and. xxxiij. q. h. tu^c saluabitur) where he said (Si qis sitit venit ad me and
bibet) who so ever list drink let him come and drink of my drink / and he
shall never after be thursty. For right as he called them before to ete of his
bread / right so now he calls them to drink of his drink. This drink
friends is the blessed blood and water yt was let out of Crystis side when he
hanged on the cross / clean blood of our redempco^n / and clear water of our
regeneraco^n. And not (flegma) as the heretyke says / as is declared (de Su^.
tri. et fi. catho. in clc.) And of this blood and water yt passed out of
Crystys side all the sacraments of the church / in whom all our saluaco^n and
health lies in / has their effect / as is noted (in. c. cu^ Martha. extra de
ce missarum) And right as water wassheth and clenieth al fylth / right so ye
sacrament of Bapteme wassheth man's soul fro al manner sy^ne oryginal mortal
and venyal / and is called (Ianua sacrame^torum) And this sacrament has his
effect by the word of god / as Dauyd says in the psalm (Afferte. Vox dm^
super aquas. deus maiestates intonuit dn^s super aquas multas) and right as
when Christ was baptized / the fader showed his pleasure (in voce) ye sone (in
carne nra^) and the holy ghost (in spe^ colu^be) And all ye angels were there
present at ye reverence of the Instytuco^n of that sacrament. Right so at this
season at the baptysyng of every christian creature / is ye holy trynyte present
with angels. And there is infused in ye soul of yt christian creature (tres
virtutes theologice Fides. spes. et caritas) As is noted in the said
(clementine de Su^. tri. et fi. catho) So friends who so ever may be baptized
in water and will not / he shall not come in heaven. The third proclamacyon
made by our savior Christ Ih^us is written (Ioh. xio. et. xiij. q. ij. c. Qui
diuina. et de pe. did. vi. c. io.) When he raised Lazar from death to life
cryenge with a great voys (Lazare veni for as) And incontinent at the
commandment of his word / the soul that was (in limbo) resorted to the body
and gave it life. Christ saying to his dyscyples (Soluite eu^ and sinite abite)
Every man being in dedely sin friends is deed in the sight of god. And as
Ancelme says among all-the people of the world is none more odyous / than a
traitor to the king / and all the people feereth to deal with him. And in
like wise he that is in dedely sin / is odyous to all creatures for his
Ingratytude and dysobeysaunce to almighty god / as is noted. xxiij. q. iij.
Sex. Yet let no man dyspeyre / if he woll come at the calling of Christ And
if he be in never so great sin and wretchedness His word is of that effect
and has grace and virtue which takes away all sin / and breketh the yates
of hell and all the power thereof. And thereof Dauyd says in the psalm above
reherced. Vox dm^ confringentes cedros. These words ben the words of our
lord / when the priest says those words (Ego absoluo te a peccates tuis) The
high trees of cedre pride / envy / Ire / couetyse / with all other capytall
sins / are destroyed / and never shall appear to hurt him which is
confessyd of them. This proclamacyon friends is of that necessyte / that who
so ever may be confessyd to a priest (in forma eccl^ie) and will not / he shall
never come to heaven. The fourth proclamaco^n Christ made when he hanged upon
the cross and made his prayer to his fader for all sinners yt would believe yt
he was god and man / when he said these words. Dimitte eis qr nesciu^t quid
faciu^t. Luce. xxiijo. et. xxv. q. v. S. io. And this sygnefyeth (sacramentu^
extreme vncto^is) by which all venyall sins are taken away / which should
be the Impedymentes for entering in to everlasting glory. This sacrament has
his effect of the word of almighty god / as Dauyd reherceth in ye said
psalm. Vox dm^ p^parantes ceruos. For right as a heart desires for his help
ye water / right so man's soul having this sacrament desires pryncypally
heaven. This sacrament is deprecatori and stondeth in prayer right as Christ
prayed upon ye cross So in mynystraco^n of this sacrament ye priest anelynge
diverse parts of man's body besecheth almighty god / that what so ever this
creature has offended in his heart / by his eyes / his eeres / his hondes and
fete / or any other part by the which he has dyspleased him / to forgive him
(vt extra de sacra. vncto^e. c. vnico) And so who so wol not receive this
sacrament and may / shall not come to ye glory of heaven. The fyfth proclamaco^n
shall be made by commandment of Christ Ihesu which is (rex et pontifex) at
the day of dome / as is read Math. xxvo. Media nocte clamor factus e^) at
which voys and cry all mankind / as well (fideles as infideles) shall rise with
the same bodies which they have here now / and they shall be incorruptyble.
And all faithful christian men which has kept Crystys proclamacyons shall
receive everlasting Joy by the sentence of Christ Ihesu (pontificis) to whom
oonly ye pronuncyaco^n of the Judgment is given Saying Venite bn^dicti patris
mei percipite regnu^ quoth paratu^ est vobis ab origi^e mu^di. de pe. did. iij.
c. ad huc instant in gl^o. And so to receive everlasting Joy / and to be
confermed in the same. This proclamaco^n and sentence represents the
sacrament of Confyrmaco^n. which must oonly be done by a bishop as is written
(i. c. vnic. de sacra. vncc) And in that (dantur gra^ et robur vt de co^. did.
ij. oe^s) And though it be so yt a man baptized deye are he be confermed / he
shall have everlasting Joy / but not so plenarye as he should have if he were
confermed. It is ordained by the church / that a child confermed / by the
space of three days shall bear a shred or bend about the neck / in token he
is become a servant of three persons and one god / the fader / the sone / and
the holy ghoost. And therefore Dauyd speaking of this sacrament / calls it the
sacrament of great virtue and grace for the stable confyrmacyon thereof saying.
Vox dm^ in virtute. And who so ever may receive this sacrament and woll not /
he shall never enter the kingdom of heaven. There ben other two sacraments
instytute by Christ Ih^u / which ben put in man's will to receive them or
nay. And they taken byndeth the takers to observe them under the pain of
their dampnaco^n. Which ben the sacrament of matrymony and order. Of the
sacrament of matrymony speaks Dauyd in ye fore reherced psalm saying Vox dm^
int^cedentes fla^ma^ ignis. The flame of cucupyscence of the flesh in
fornycacyon which is dedely sin. By this sacrament of matrymony yt mortalyte
of sin is turned in to venyal in diverse cases (vt. xxvi. did. deinde. and.
xxxij. q. ij. Sicut. Et quoth ip^e deus e^ custes and defensor mat^mo. xxxij q.
iiij. nemo i^ fi. And ye sacrament of order is ye second which is put in
man's eleccyon / in the which (imprimitur caracter indebilis and datur
special gra^) And he ordered specially to be mynystre of al other sacraments.
Of this order and power thereof speaks Dauyd in ye above said psalm saying.
Vox dm^ conmouentis desertu^. Which deserte this world is called. And his
office is mankind living in it to inform and meue with his good example of
living and holy doctrine (increpando. arguendo. exhortando. et conminando) And
they ben ordered to love god pryncypally as is noted. h. q. iij. Qui ep^s. I
have showed unto you these five proclamacyons / which must be kept under pain
of your dampnacyon. Wherefore I say to you with Christ. Qui habet aures
audiendi audiat) yt is to say. Ye yt here the word of god / here it devoutly
and prynte it in your souls perfytly / and execute it acordynge to ye same.
God almighty friends never left man without remedy for the saluaco^n of his
soul / as in the old Testament was circu^cysyon and sacrefyce of beestes and
other after the form then given / which were expyaco^ns for sin for yt
season / but they had no virtue to open heaven yates and bring man in And there
when he ascended ( corperalr) he left in his church the. vij. sacraments in
the remembrance of his passion and to have their virtue of de same / as is
written in the chapter (cu^ martha de ce missarum) He left also his mother here
behind hy^ which lived diverse years after him to instruct ye Appostles and
Euangelystes of his incarnaco^n and his blessed life and commandments / and
therefore she is called (matter eccl^ie). And as ye great doctor Albertus says
upon the gospel (Missus est angelus gabriel) that our lady received all the
sacraments of the church except preesthode / for three causes. The first was
(propter hu^iliacione^) where yt our first mother Eve was condemned for her
pride / she in her life showed al mekenes and would be among wy^men as one of
them. And so would be after the law purefyed though she neded it not / but be
as one of the^ a mother like as her sone Christ Ih^u would be circumcysed as a
child as Saint Bernarde says. The second cause was (propter instrucco^em
aliorum) that by her ensample every man and woman should receive their
sacraments / without which they might not be saved. For why / her sone had said
as is written (Math^ vlti^o) geuynge his appostles in commandment Eu^tes
docete oe^s ge^tes baptisantes i^ noi^e pri^s and fi. et ss. docentes eos
seruare q^cu^que mandaui vobis. The third cause (propter supererrogacione^) as
is written Apocalipsis vlti^o. Qui iustus est. iusti ficetur adhuc. And though
it be so yt she was (ab inicio sanctificata ex vtero matris. et plena gra^. et
magis repleta in concepco^e filij sui) And though she neded not to receive the
sacraments for purgaco^n of sin / yet she received them (vt cresceret per
effectu^ sacrame^torum) She would be baptized as her sone was and so receive
(carectare^ baptismalem) And be nombred among christian people / and dystyncte
from the Jews. She was confessyd to the Euangelyst of no sin / but geuynge
laud and praysynge to almighty god / that it pleas^ him to make her his mother
being his creature. Also she received of the said saint Ioh^n which said
mass before her and mynystred to her the same body / which was born of her.
Joined to the godhede in remembrance of his passion / and to her great
consolacyon in his absence. And so al other sacraments except preesthode as is
above said she received / which is to the stablysshement and confyrmaco^n of
the sacraments of the church and the veryte and truth of the same / and to
the confusyon of all Heretykes. And therefore we sing in the church Gaude
maria vergo cu^ctas hereses tu sola interemisti. This is noted by Antonyne (in
quarta perte titlo. xvo. c. xvio.) Ye know right well brethern that credence is
not to be given to no proclamaco^n but to yt / which comes by the kings
high commandment and under his seal / and the more honorable person that
brings and proclameth it / the more credence ought to be given to it.
Proclamaco^ns ben made in diverse places of ye cytees and land / to the intent
they should be well understand / and no man after to allege Ignorance
thereof. To ye transgressors and brekers thereof sometime the penalyte is treason
/ sometime death / inprysonement and loss of their goods as the law assygneth
in that behalf / noted (extra de constit. c. fi^ali) These proclamacyons
friends ought to be accept above all other / for they come from the king of
all kings almighty god / as is red apocalipsis (xixo. et de constable. iiij. c.
proprie. et de re. iudic. c. ij. in. cle) This glorious godheed stondeth in
three persons / the fader / the sone / and the holy ghost (Pater est deus.
filius e^ deus. spiritus scu^s e^ deus) Also of one essence nature and power /
and who so ever dyspleaseth one / dyspleaseth all (qr tres illi vnu^ su^t) and
no man may resyste him (in celo neque in terra. John. xvijo. et in c. cu^
martha de ce missarum extra de conse. did. ij. c. i^ xp^o xxxv. q. x. c. io.)
And that his proclamaco^n should be more of auctoryte to be accept / the fader
of heaven sent his oonly begoten sone ye second person of the trynyte to make
these proclamaco^ns / and mantylde ye godheed in our nature and becam man in
every condyco^n as we are except sin. And with a plenarye commyssyon given to
him all power in heaven and in earth / as is noted (Math^ vlti^o. et Io. ij. De
plenitudine eius oe^s nos accepimus gra^m. de co^. did. i^. s. io. et did.
ij. c. Saxta^. et de pe. did. i^. c. libenter. et de pur. post pertu^. c.
vnico) And the second person of the trynyte of a congruence was sent on this
message to be the sone of man / right as he was in the trynyte the sone of the
fader / as is noted / by the master of the Sentence. His natyuyte was
proclaimed by angels at Bedleem the night of his birth / as is red (Luc.
ijo. Ecce em^ euangeliso vobis gaudiu^ magnu^. quoth exit o^ni populo. et de con.
did. i. nocte) And that more credence should be given / yt god had taken our
nature / an host of angels appyred and song Gloria in excelsis deo. et in
terra pax hoibus bone voluntatis) And said to the shepeherdes that they should
goo to Bedlem / and there they should (inuenire infante^ iacente^ in presepe et
inuolutu^ pa^nis) So friends right as a man having his garments upon him / ye
may not se his propre naked body. Right so Christ heynge here in earth mortal
(quo ad humanitate^) his godhede was not seen / but the humanyte was the
Instrument and garment thereof (Quia deu^ nemo vidit vnquam) as is written John.
ijo. et in. c. Moses. viij. q. i. in glo) The fader also preued / that he was
his one geten sone / and that he had co^myssyon in heaven / in earth / and upon
all creatures / as is written Math^. xvijo. et. ij. q. vij. Item obicitur) And
as it proved in his transfyguracyon / for out of hell he called Moses / and
out of paradyse ye prophet Hely / and the fader appyred (in voce) saying. Hic
est filius meus dilectus. in quo michi bn^ conplacui. ip^m audite. xciij. did.
legimus. et de con. did. iij. c. fi) and so our maker and fader almighty god
wol and commands / yt we shall here him / accept him / take hy^ for his one
geten sone / and by hy^ and his word we shall be restored to our Inherytaunce
which man is excluded for the preuarycaco^n of our fore fader Adam / which
was commanded by the second person of the trynyte that he should not ete (de
ligno sciencie boni et mali) and brake his word and commandment. Right so
now by the commandment of the said second person god and man / by his word
and proclamaco^n shall be saved and restored to their old Inherytau^ce / who so
woll believe in him and observe his word as is written John. iiijo. Qui credit
in eu^ no^ iudicatur. qui aute^ no^ credit. iam iudicatus est. de pe. did.
iiij. c. Ante. et. c. in domo. Et oi^s qi credit in eu^ no^ pereat. sed habebit
vita^ eternal vt. xxiij. q. iiij. Sex his oi^bus. When this noble messenger the
sone of god and man according to his faders commandment had made his holy
proclamaco^ns / the Jews axed of him by what auctoryte he took upon him so to
make new laws and proclamaco^ns / and what he was and from whens he came. And
he answered saying as is written John. vio. Ego su^ alpha et o. principiu^ et
finis. de celo descendi. no^ vt facia^ voluntate^ mea^. sed eius qui me misit.
de pe. did. iiij. c. Si ex bono. And yt I am sone of the fader in heaven and he
in me and I in him. And yt I have suffycyent power to save ye world and shall
deem it I shall preue by your laws and scryptures / witness suffycyent and
deed. Moses which is your (legeslator) to whom ye give credence and must in
the scripture which he wrote unto you / when I had spoken with him in the
mount / and gave him ye law (in tabulis saxeis) He wrote upon me when he said
(propheta^ suscitabo eis de medio fratru^ suorum silem tut. et pona^ verba mea
in ore eius. loqueturque oi^a ad eos q^ p^cipero illi And of me / my power and
cunning he prophesied In like wise ye sent to John Baptyst your priests and
levites / whom ye had in great veneracyon for his virtue and holiness. And was
in yt season (lucerna lucens) And he certefyed you what I was. I need no
testymonyall of man / for I have testymonye of my fader in heaven yt he is in me
/ and I in him. And ye understand yt none may forgive sin but almighty god.
And that I am god and man / and have power of body and soul it is read
(Math^. ix. et de pe. did. iij. ss. productorum. et de pe. did. i. ss.
denique) that the Jews brought a man before me which had the Palsy in every
part of his body. I seeing their devotion and faith said to the seek man
(Confide fili remittu^tur tibi peccata tua) The Scribes and Pharysees being
present when I forgave hy^ his sy^nes / thought that I took upon me that which
was the office of god and not man / and said (Hic blasphemat) I understanding
there froward hertes said unto them. Whether it is less dyffyculte to forgive
sin / or to bid this man lyenge shaking here in his bed to rise and go.
And that ye shall se that I god and man have power in earth to forgive sin. I
say to the rise and beer thy bed with the and goo home to thy house. This man
was heelyd in every part of his body Incontynenty and without any tracte of
time / which passyd all natural power of man / and did as Christ commanded
him. The water knew that he was god when he walked on it / as Math. xiiij.
and. xxij. did. c. Si qid. The earth knew him / when he hanged on ye cross
(terre motus factus e^. Math. xxviij) The son / moan / and sterres with other
elements knew hy^ (in passioe^) and in detestaco^n of the Jews cruelte
withdrewe their light (et tenebre fact su^t) Math. xxvijo. And all creatures
knew hy^ / and in manner sanctified hy^ except ye Jews. And many bodies which
were buried many years tofore / rose fro death to life in ye time of his
resurrecco^n / and apperyd to much people / and certefyed them yt he was god
and man. And as it is written by a devout doctor / yt the princes of the Jews
which had put Christ unto death / herd tell yt such bodies were risen and so
certefyed / sent diverse men of substance to se and speak with them / and to
know ye truth / and so was done / by the which many of them were converted.
And so friends it is proved euydently yt Christ has power in heaven and earth
and is (iudex viuorum and mortuorum) Wherefore it is expedyent to take heed of
his laws and proclamaco^ns. And therefore I say to you the words of my time.
Qui h aures audiendi audiat.

I showed you before yt proclamacyons be made in diverse places of cytees of
the land / to thentent that no man should pretend ignorance. Ignorance
friends is very peryllous / for it is the mother of all errowyse / as is written.
xxxviij. did. ignora^cia. And though it be so yt certain persons be excused
for certain causes in the law posytyue / yet in the law of nature and the law
of god / they be not excused hauy^ge there wits and be of lawful age (vt in
p^dco^. c. qi ea eade^ did. Et turpe e^ ignorare ius circa quoth qis versatur.
ff. de origi^e iuris. l. ij. ss. si ius. et. xxxvij. did. qi de mensa) There
is no thing more Inconuenyent than a man to be ignorant in yt law which he
is daily conuersau^t with / as is written. xxviij. did. Si in laices
i^tollerabil vir inscie^cia. que to mages i^ clerices. nec excusaco^e digna e^.
nec venia. Therefore it is written in the said chapter (ignora^cia. xxxviij.
did) yt all priests are bound to understand (sacras scripturas and canones)
and to use them in there prechynge and in there good examples / or else they
shall have the punysshement yt god speaks of by his prophet / saying (Tu
sciencia^ repulisti. and ego repella^ te. ne sacerdocio fu^gares m) There be
three special ignorau^ces to my purpose at this time (vt in. c. turbata. i^. q.
iiij. Ignora^cia supina. crassa. et affectata) Supina and crassa is that thing
yt is openly done and proved / and yet there be some yt wol not understand it /
as the Jews did of Christ whose coming / and he was god and man / was preued
by prophecye / by miracles by angels / and also by other ways / as I have
showed to you before. And yet they perseuered in there obstynacy / and would not
know him of malice. Et ignorancia affectata is yt / when a man may be learned
to understand and will not endeavor him to have it / but refuses in manner to
have knowledge of it / and they be ye persons yt Dauyd spoke of in the sawter
Nolu^t i^telligere vt bn^ agere^t) they woll not vndstonde to do well. Saint
Poul spekyng of these three ignorau^ces says (ignorans ignorabitur) and as it
follows in ye same distyncco^n. He yt wol not know god here in earth and
follow his commandments / god wol not know and hy^ at day of dome / but
say to hy^ as it is wryt (Math^. xxv. et. i. q. i. c. prophetauit. Ame^ dico
vobis nescio vos) Christ said to ye Jews when they would not believe in his
words / nor his miracles / nor believe in hy^ (Moriemini i^ pccis v^ris) I have
showed you both by my prechers / prophets / and also come my self to teache you
/ and so ye can lay none excuse. Right so friends many a noble sermon is said
in this place in ye year / and in like wise in manner through ye realm and the
laws of god showed you / and how ye shall plese hy^ in leuyng your sins of
pride / couetyse / symony / usury / aduoutry and fornycaco^n and all other
mortal sins. And as men say there was never more pride / couetyse / usury
ne other capytall sins used than be now a days / for all the noble prechynge
yt is there made. And truly brethern I am sure yt in no manner reame in
crystendom / be so many noble clerks of Curates in all manner facultees and
virtues also as be in this reame of England. And though all be not so perfyte
as they should be / yet love and worship the other that been good. For Peter.
John and other of the apostles ought not to be despised / by cause of Judas yt
was apostle / and saint Austen says. Blame not my house if there be one therein
not good / for I can not make my house beter than Abraham's house. To whom was
said. Ecce ancilla^ cu^ filio eius. And in Noes house ye sone scorned the
fader. And in Crystis house the servant betrayed the master as is noted.
xlvij. did. Qua^tu^libet. It is red (xiij. q. i. quasi per totu^ et extra de
perochijs) yt al crystendom is dyuyded after spyrytual diuisyon in diocesis /
and every dyocese has a bishop which has cure of al ye hole dyocese / and
al ye diocese is his parysshe. And the dyocese is dyuyded in parysshes / and
every parysshe has a church and a curate lymyt to it. And every man yt
dwells within the said parysshe / is parysshon thereof. And it is red also
Luc. ij. et. xi. q. i. Magnu^. that the season yt christ should be born / every
man was commanded to go to the place where he was born / and there he should
make his professyon to the emperor with a certain trybute / and his name to be
written and sent to the Emperor. And therefore Joseph went to Bedlem / to make
his professyon where he was born. Bedlem friends (interp^tatur domus panis) and
it sygnefyeth to every man his parysshe church which is the place of his
regeneraco^n where he shall be fed with the bread of Bedlem Christ Ih^u and with
his sacraments which has (oe^m dulcedine^) to saluaco^n of man. No man ought
to be crystened but in his parysshe church / nor to be shryuen by the law /
but of his curate / which has charge of his soul / as it is noted (in. c.
O^is extra de pe. and re) Nevertheless there be other places that men may be
shryuen in by dyspensaco^n / as in places where pardons ben. And to certain
freres which ben admytted to here confession. Nor he ought not to be houseled
but in his paryssh^ chirchee and also there to be buried / except he chese some
other place making in his own church his (vltimu^ vale) To this Bedlem his
parysshe church he ought to come every holy day and other days if he
conuenyently may to love / and to here his matyns / mass and euesonge. And who
so ever absenteth himself fro his parysshe church in the time of service and
gooth about in other places / it is a token by lykelyheed yt he woll fall in
great error and heresye William Durant in his book called (Raco^nale
diuinorum) says yt every sunday a curate goth in to the pulpytt / to show
the people how each one shall pray for other / and other things necessary to
them for ye weke following / in keeping holy days or fasting to the we will of
there souls. And stondeth on hye / to the intent he may se if he want any of
his parysshons / and if any be acustomed to be absent to show it to ye
bishop. And to bid strangers to go to their own chirches / except they ben
pilgrims. And though it be so as I am sure almighty god is greatly pleased with
the perfyte living of men of relygyon for their contemplaco^n / prayers /
their good example and prechynge also. But in nyn opinion ye parysshe chirches
ben they / yt hold and keep the people in good rule to love and serve god to
there preseruaco^n of the faith / wherefore friends I exhort you to love the^ /
honor and mayntene them / as loved be god they be full honorable here in this
cite and in other places of this reame / to the great pleasure of god. Dauyd
says (Dilexi decore^ domus tue) and Solomon had his great wysdom for edyfyeng
ye house of god / as is noted (. xvi. q. vij. Et hoc diximus. xxxvi. did. ss.
Ecce. et de con. did. i. c. io.) We se by experyence friends yt to ye place
where proclamaco^ns be made much people resort to here what is proclaimed /
and in their return many of them varye in their rehersall and can not tell ye
very truth for their varyau^ce to other yt herd not the proclamaco^ns made.
Wherefore a wise man that would know the proclamaco^n and such things as is
comprysed in it and tauoyde ye penalyte will go to the kings Chau^sery where
ye orygynall is under the kings seal and get a copy thereof and will prynte it
well in his mind yt he forgete it not. In the Chaunsery friends ye know there
is my lord Chau^seler as heed / and. xij. masters / and certain other officers
/ as bowgers and clerks to write and serve the people of such things as
longs to the law. And as Breton says in his book which he made of the law
of the land Nemo dz recedere a ca^cellaria sine remedio) And there is rolled
all statutes proclamaco^ns and the kings high commandments and all other
ordynau^ces made for ye we will of the reame. The church of god may well be
called the Chaunsery. The Chau^seler hereof is Christ Ihesu as saint Poul says.
Ip^e e^ caput eccl^ie. Et nemo potest ponere aliud fu^damentu^ p^ter id quoth
positu^ e^ quoth est x^ps ih^s) And he says also (ad Ephesios iiijo. Quoth i^pe
dedit quosda^ quide^ aplos. quosda^ aute^ prophetas. alias euangelistas. alios
aute^ pastores vsque ad consu^macione^ sanctorum in opus ministerij.
mediacione^ corperis xp^i. extra de heretices. c. extra iniu^cto et. c. Sicut
in vno) And Saint Austen says in this verse. Pro patribus tuis nati su^t tibi
filij. constitues eos principes super oe^m terra^) written. xxi. did. c. in
nono. et. lxviij. did. Quorum vices) that ye church has yet apostles /
which ben the Bysshoppes (Et septuaginta duos discipulos) the prophets and
eua^ugelystes prechers of the word of god. Pastores and the holy doctors
which expowned the holy scripture. And this chaunselery with all the mynystres
thereof shall endure to the end of the world. And all the tyrauntes yt ever
was / could never destroy it / nor never none shall. For as John Crysostom
says. Christ ordained the angels / prophets / appostles / martyrs /
confessors / virgynes and all other for his church. And at last came
himself. And though he made all the world with one word / yet he was in
building his church by the space of xxxiij. years. And he said to Peter.
(Rogaui petre vt non deficiat fides tua. xxi. did. S. io.) And the church
universal can not err (in his q^ su^t fidei) For almighty god says by his
prophet Dauyd speaking of the church. Et volu^tate labiorum suorum no^
fraudabitur) that is to say the will and dysposyco^n that the church makes
for the we will of man's soul concerning the faith / shall be ever true and
stable. The church is our mother / for she must feed us and teache us to please
almighty god and the way to come to heaven. In her doctrine and holy scripture
is no falshede ne feyned matere / but all truth and cunning for the we will of
man's soul. For as saint Austen writes to saint Ierom and is noted. x. did.
Ego solis. cu^ tribus. c. seque^t.es yt there is no falsehede nor lie in all the
scripture. And saint Ierom says as is written (xxiij. q. c. Quid ergo. quod
nephas est dicere mendaciu^ in sacra scriptura) Wherefore no man should disdeyne
to learn at this scole ye church. For as saint Poul writes (ad ephesians. iiij.
Quia oi^a creauit vt innotescat principibus et potestatibus in celestibus per
eccl^iam multiformis sapiencia dei) And saint Ierom says yt the angels knew
not plenarye the mystery of the Incarnaco^n till the season that Christ suffered
his passion / and thapostles preched and taught by the church. And John
Crysostom says in his prologue (super Iohe^m Namque quoth angeli nobiscu^ per
Iohi^s voce^ et per nos didiceru^t) And as it follows after / that without
doubt the angels give great attendau^ce to the word of god when it is
preched. And to us is great honor and Joy that the angels lerneth with us
and by us that which they knew not before. And so friends who so ever is not
of the scole of Christ / is against him / as he says hy^self the words written.
Luc. xi. et. xxiiij. q. i. Qm^ vetus. Qui no^ est mecu^. contra me est. et qi
no^ colligit mecu^. dispergit) which be all heretykes and presumptuous men in
there reason and arguments (Heresis greece dr ab elecco^e. s. eam disciplina^
qua^ sibi vnusqisque elegit putat sibi melio re^. vt. xxiiij. q. iij. heresis.
Et hereticus e^ qi aliter scriptura^ sacra^ intelligit. quam sensus spu^s
sancti efflagitat) He is an heretyke that takes the scripture of god after his
will / and not after the sense of ye holy ghost. And that presumptuous man yt
woll defend any error dampened by the church (hereticus est) as is written
(.xxiiij. q. iij. Qui in eccl^ia) Then to the heretyke which says that the
words of Christ (Hoc est em^ corpus meu^) written in his holy scripture (Math.
xvi. Mat. xiiij. Luc. xxij. et Io. vi. de co^. did. ij. c. Loquido. et. c. cu^
oe^) said by the priest ordered in due form should not be there
transformacyon fro the materyall bread in to his flesh / and the wine to be
his blood for the redempco^n of man / you would make him a liar / which is
(Veritas) For he says hy^self Ego su^ panis viuus qi de celo descendi. Siqis
manducauerit ex hoc pane. viuet in eternu^ Ioh. vi. xxxi. q. i. c. Quo^. in fi.
de con. did. ij. Species) Christ said I am bread the sone of god and man
descends fro heaven / that who so eteth of my bread / shall ever live / for
this bread which I shall give / is my flesh (pro mu^di vita. de con. did.
ij. xp^s. et. c. veru^) And that this is true / saint Johan the Euangelyst
(John. vio.) swereth in this wise saying Amen ame^ dico vobis nisi
manducauerites carne^ filij hoi^s et biberitis eius sanguine^. non habebitis
vitam in vobis. vt. xxiiij. q. i. Si aute^) Friends this word (Amen) is an
oath of that Inportau^ce / that it could not be properly translate. And thereof
saint Ierom and other translatours of the scripture let it stand in that
sygnyfycacyon that it was in. (apud Hebreos) But it sygnefyeth an oath in every
place of faith and truth. And saint John doubleth his oath where he says
(Amen amen) to ye Instruccyon of faithful men / and to the condempnacyon and
expulsynge out of heaven all heretykes. Or else he doubleth this oath swerynge
that there were two natures in Christ / the godhede / and the manhede / And
again such heretykes he wrote his gospelles / that Christ was god and man.
Thou heretyke should men believe the rather than faint Poul. He says as it is
written (ad Corinth) I never learned the scripture that I write to you of no man
/ but of god almighty (Et si angelus de celo euangeliset vobis p^ter quam
euangelisauimus vobis. Anathema sit. ad Galath. i. et. xi. q. iij. c. Si. i. s.
qi p^est) And he speaking of the blessed sacrament of the awter / as is written
(prio. ad Corinth. xio.) says. Dn^s ihu^s xp^us in qua nocte tradebatur
accepit pane^ benedixit ac fregit. Dedit discipulis suis dicens. Accipite et
manducate. Hoc est corpus meum. quod pro vobis tradetur. hoc facite in meam
commemoracionem) The night before that Christ our savior suffered his passion /
he took bread and blessed it / brake it and gave it to his dyscyples / saying
/ take this bread and ete it / this is my body which shall deye for you / and
do ye in like wise after in remembrance of my passion fore forgeuenes of
sin. These words spoke not saint Poul in figure / but in veryte / that that
bread was turned in to his flesh and blood / aduertysynge every man that
should receive it / that he should be out of sy^ne to avoid his dampnaco^n
Friends though there ben made infenyte arguments to preue yt after these
words said / the bread to be changed and made the body of Christ / shall
never be understand without the light of very faith / as is noted (xx. q. i.
Quia) I read friends that there was a great doctor of the university of Paris
/ which was ever dysputynge of the verytee of the sacrament of the awter. And
at last / he fell in great error thereof by his resonynge / and was foully
accombred in himself. And came to diverse doctors for reformaco^n. At last
he came to an au^cyent doctor which said to him. Brother thou have ben to besy
in dysputaco^n of ye sacrament of ye awter believe as the church byleueth as is
thy dewty and all christian men and go no ferder / and so he did and was
delivered fro his error. The law of Civil says. Qui negat alimenta. necare
videtur) Syres the blessed body of Christ is our sustynau^ce and meet to
bring us to heaven / and is called (viaticu^) And these false heretykes that
would bring us to wrong believe / and make us to goo to hell with them / as
the said law of Cyuyl says it is not long to dyspute with them / they being
obstynate / but give them that / which is ordained for them / fire.

Ye know right well friends / yt the Chau^sery and all persons yt perteyneth
to it ben preuyleged / that they nor none of them shall be co^uented nor sewed
in no court but oonly in the same court of ye chau^sery. And if any of them
be sewid in any other court / the Chau^seler woll send a writ called
(corpus cu^ causa) or else a (cerciorare) and remeue the cause and bring the
person to his own court. And in like wise is daily done in the kings benche
and the common place / and in the kings cheker also / and will not have their
preuyleges dysputed / but they woll interpret them themself. Christ Ihesus god
and man his Chau^sery is the church as is said before. And he has himself
preuyleged it / and given to it lybertees / yt none should adnulle nor break.
And for ye perpetuyte thereof / he has put it in his testament and sealed it /
and also confermed it (morte eius vt ex. de cele missarum. c. cu^ martha) And
as I said before / no man should interpret his will and his scripture / but
himself / his church and they that he has given auctoryte / his appostles and
them which succedeth in their places / as is written in the gospel of this day
Vobis datu^ est nosci misteria regni celorum. ceteris autem in parabolis. In
the old testament friends was anointed bishops / kings / prophets and
priests. And the tabernacle (archam mensa^) and (vasa) as is noted ( Exodus c.
vlti^o. and ex. de. sa. vncco^e c. vnico) And al these persons and things
thus anoy^ted / should be had in honor / and no man to deal with them / but
they which were anointed and stood in the same dygnyte. And therefore almighty
god gives a general commandment / saying by his prophote Dauyd. Nolite
tangere cristos meos. neque in prophetis meis malignari) And also he says by
his prophet Zach^. ijo. Qui vos tangit. tangit pupilla^ occuli mei) which
text is declared by holy faders (. ij. q. vij. Accusacio) that right as in a
man is the precious thing that he tendreth most the balle of his eye / right
so almighty god tendereth most preesthode / which ben the Executours of his
will again his adversary ye devil. And it follows in the same text / yt
every man would punysshe his servant yt offends him / himself and suffer
none other man. In like wise almighty god would not have his servants /
priests anointed punysshed but by such as he has deputed by his law / ne
woll not have them sclau^dred / for they ben the pyllars which holds up his
church / as it is red (.x. c. iij. did. Dn^s noster ih^s xp^s. rex iudeorum.
et deus noster. vsque ad passionis die^ seruauit honore^ pontificibus et
sacerdotibus. quamuis illi. nec timore^ dei. nec agnico^em xp^i seruassent) And
as he says himself (John. xvo. Non vos me elegistes sed elegi vos. ex. de
sensibus. c. procuraco^es in fi.) And when it pleased him to be taken and led
to his passion / he said to ye knights which took him. Si me queritis. sinite
eos abire) that is to say. Suffer my apostles to depart / for ye have no
Iurysdyccyon in them / nor in me neither / but that I woll suffer you as it is
written. Io. xix. et. xxiij. q. i. Quid culpatur. et. xxij. q. i. c. Mouet Also
friends beside this preuylege granted by almighty god to his church / there
ben other preuyleges granted to it by holy faders. Popes. Emperors and
kings. And by general cou^selles which byndeth all the world / for there
ben present all kings for their lands and comynaltee / and all bishops for
their chirches / dyocese and clerge. And in these general cou^selles ben
accursed all they which breketh the lybertees of the church / which rests
in the materyall church / that no man do no vyolence therein / but have it in
honor (vt matter nostra) And that no man should lay hand of spyrytuall
persons being ordered nor invade their goods and spoylle them against their
will / if they do / they ben acursed. And also all makers of statutes / writers
and kepers / or favors the said statutes and makers of them / ben acursed /
as is noted (ex. de sen. ex. c. Nouerit. et. c. graue^) It is a great shame
friends a man to go and do contrary his own deed promised and sealed by him.
And be some doctors (incidit in pena^ ad turpilianu^. ff.) This reame being
in great trouble in time of kings / as Johan. Henry. And Henry the second and
the third / to the plesur of god and pleasynge the land was made a statute
called (Magna carta) And yt it should be inuyolatly kept and observed / the
king and all the lords temporal and the comynaltee by their attourneys. And
all the bysshoppes of the reame being in this same place Poules cross (in
pontificalibus) cursed all them yt brake any article comprysed in the same / in
the which (Magna carta) by these words written (Habeat acclia anglicana. oe^s
libertates suas integras et illesas) And the lybertees of ye church of god is
/ as is above said / that no temporal Judge shall have any Iurisdicco^n in a
spyrytuall person under the pain before said. And daily again ye will of god
his law and determynaco^n of his church is done the contrary. As Pharao
despised ye prechynge of Moses / and the commandment of god / yt he should
sease his persecuco^n of the people of Israel. And ye more that Moses spoke
unto hy^ to sease and keep gods commandment / the more rygorous and cruel
he was / till he was drowned in the reed see / and all his great Iuges and
officers with him. For he and his counsel would not understand the
commandment of god / nor the words of his precher. And therefore it is written
of him ( Exodus vijo. et. xxiij. q. iiij. c. Nabugodonosor. duratu^ est cor
pharaoi^s etc.) That is to say His heart is so Indurate that he woll not
understand the commandment of almighty god showed by his precher / but as it
did please him.

John Andrewe in the book called Ieronimanu^ says / yt there was a Greek and an
heretyke which dysputed with a catholycall priest in the church of Jerusalem
/ and the said priest alleged to the heretyke saint Ierom / and the heretyke
said to him again. Thy Ierom which thou alledgest lies falsely / and even
forth with his tongue was taken from him and he spoke never after. And in like
wise one of the sect of Arianis said that saint Ierom was false / and his
wrytynges were not true. And incontinent the devil entered in him / and he
cried ever (Ieronime Ieronime) and so deyed in wretchedness.

It is written also friends in the law. Non est bonu^ ludere cu^ sci^s) And
there was also certain men which played at the dyse / and it was showed unto
them yt they should sease / for it was a game forboden by the law of god and
his church and by saint Ierom / saint Austen and many holy faders. At yt next
metynge when they should play one of them said I woll play at the dyse in
spyte of Iorom. Austen decrees and all other that bordeth it / and forthwith
the devil slew him and bare his body away through the rouffe of the house /
and let the bowels stynkyng there. By this ensamples friends we may
understand that the auctoryte of the church and the prechynge of the
mynysters thereof ought not to be despised / but with all reverence to be
honored and the holy doctrynes of it to be observed and kept. Brethern
understand well the words of the said chartre. Magna carta) wherein is said
(Habeat eccl^ia anglicana libertates suas. non tuas) not yt you geuest it any
lybertees / but yt they should have there own given them by god and holy faders
of ye church / as popes emperors / kings / and (integras) Not a part of
their lybertees / but they should have them hoole with out any dyuysyon (et
illesas) not to be hurt by any interpretaco^n nor wrong declaraco^n / but
according to the intellect of Crystys church. And for the very perfyte
intellect yt temporell men should not deal with no spyrytuall person / but
let the church have his hoole lybertee. Saint Thomas of Canterbury / whom
heaven and earth takes for a saint deyed for none other cause / but for the
lybertees of the church. And therefore we say in our service to almighty god
in his laud. Deus pro cuius eccl^ia gliosus pontifex et martyr thomas occubuit
etc. And yt his cause which he deyed fore was accept of almighty god / for
saving the lybertees of his church. It is red that Christ Ih^u said to him
(Thoma thoma. eade^ gloria^ quam dedi apostolo meo petro. do tibi) And it is to
presume brethern yt if Saint Thomas of Canterbury were now living / they
which dyrectely now do against the lybertees of the church / would put him
to death again / as saint Poul says (ad Hebre. vio et de pe. did. ij. Si em^.
ss. paulus) that sinners daily crucefye Christ / sitting on the right hand of
his fader / dyspysyng his law and his church / which is planted with the
blood of his saints. The church friends of god in every reame of crystyante /
ye heed thereof is christ. The church of Rome (Seeds apostolica) is our mother /
and we all are generat by her (vera fide) and dyspowsed in (castitate) to
Christ Ihu^. And the lybertees which he has given / be not give to one
church synguler but to all as one / as he says hy^self yt words written
(.xxiiij. q. i. loqitur. et.c. oi^bus vna e^ colu^ba mea. perfecta mea and vna
e^ matris sue electa geniticis sue) And who so woll dyuyde them or take ye
preuylege from one of them / he takes ye preuylege from them al / and is demed
by all the law (vt scismaticus) and stondeth acursed as is noted (xxiij. q. h.
No^ vos. et tunica^ dm^ in consutilem) he would deuyde again the will of god
(vt.xxiij. q. i. Qm^) and in yt be of worse dysposycyon than ye Jews were /
which said (No^ scindamus ea^. s sorciamur de ea) It is an argument with some
people / yt a priest or a consecrate person do a temporal deed / why should
not he be punysshed by a te^porall Judge. This reason can have no place / where
there is a prohybyco^n given and a certain Judge lymyt for ye punysshement of a
person so ordered by ye law of god. For ye offense friends chau^geth not ye
Iurysdycco^n in this case / and though he yt is co^uentyd would consent in a
te^porall Judge / he may not (vt ex. de. f. c. per. t.) And it is often said yt
the bishops of England have given consent thereto / which they may not do by
ye law. And such yt did so ben acursed / and their consent is / as no
consent (potis. i^ cri^ali) It is red ij. regu^. xxiiij) that great varyau^ce
was betwix Dauyd and Saul a king anointed. And where as Dauyd might have slain
him and spared / saw that he kytte a pese of Saul's garment / in, token that he
might have destroyed him. Yet in it yt he was anointed Dauyd had great
conscience and said (propicius sit michi dn^s. ne extenda^ manu^ nea^ in xp^m
dm^) For as saint Austen says in the chapter (Dn^s.i. q. i. quoth saul no^
habebat innocencia^. et tame^ habebat sanctitate^. no^ merito vite sue. sed
tame^ vncco^is) Christ knew yt Judas was a traitor to him / and showed it to
his dyscyples / as is Io. vio et.i. q. i. Christ saying. No^ne ego vos duodecim
elegi. and ex vobis vnus diabolus est) Yet he depryued not him (de apostolatu)
but suffered hy^ in his company till he hanged himself as is written (actuu^.i.
et. i. q. i. Qui studet) And all sacraments mynystred by him were approuyd
though he were not well dysposed himself / as is written (.i. q. i. dedit)
Therefore Dauyd in his sawter after made / by hy^ aduertyseth al faithful men
in eschewynge ye great dyspleasure of god saying. Nolite tangere xp^os meos.
et in prophetis meis. nolite malignari) The holy ghost speaking in the mouth
of Dauyd / says these words / touch not my prestes / nor malygne not again
my prophets which ben in ye new testament / the priests and prechers of ye
word of god / as Bede says upon this gospel. Ecce ego mitto vos) They yt
malygne again priests / be of yt condyco^n that Herod was / as it is red
(actuu^. xiij.) which stroke of saint Iamys heed for no cause but yt he was
(de eccl^ia) And in like wise he put saint Peter in prison and for the same
cause. Brethern malygne not that a clerk priest be promoted to great dygnyte
in the church / as ye se daily poor men of birth exalted to have rule / for
yt is the purueau^ce of god to poor men's sons and virtuous. For he wol also
dystrybute at his pleasure all dygnytees spyrytuall and temporal. Example. He
called the first king Saul of ye people of Israel from keeping of asses / and
Dauyd ye second king from keeping sheep. And saint Peter fro fysshyng and other
of his apostles / and made them pry^ces of all the world. Constitues eos
principes super oe^m terra^) This felyshyp that speaks and malygneth against
the church in their resonynge and arguments to oppress the auctoryte thereof
/ may well be lykned to a dog when the moon shyneth fair and bryghte / he
barketh and bayeth even against it as he would destroy it / and yet he neither
understands what it is / nor it lies not in his power to hurt it And this
dog thus barkynge / lets other men of their rest and seaseth not till he
be rapt on ye heed and so slain and thrown in a dyche. Right so these barkers
and malygnours against the church / and the auctoryte thereof shall be stryken
with the vengau^ce of god and shall be buried in the stynkynge dyche of hell
as heretykes ought to be / as is red (de hereticis. ex. per totu^). In the
beginning of my sermon I said friends / yt he which herd not the
proclamaco^ns made It were expedyent for him to go to the Chaunsery and get
him a copy of them / to the effect he might keep them and avoid ye penaltees
of them. Saint Austen says that all christian people stondeth under one faith in
two manner kinds / as priests and lay men. And these two people pryncypally
ought to take heed of Crystes proclamaco^ns and to prynte them well in their
mind. For each one of them must give a sore count for the obseruau^ce and
keeping of the same. First as for preesthode shall have a bylle of
remembrance in this manner. Estote sancti. sicut dn^s deus vester scu^s est) as
is written ( Leuit. xix. et xxxi. did. c. tenere) Be ye holy as I am your maker
and god / and so ye ought to be. And to worship and love me above al other
thing. I made your souls to my image of Immortalyte / and when ye had foiled
it / and lost your Inherytau^ce. I took your nature and made my self like to
you. I was conuersaunt among you in the world (sicut pontifex and sacerdos) I
gave unto you power yt never I gave unto creature before. For right as I god
almighty made all thing of naught. Right so ye my priests / shall change the
nature of bread and wine in to my flesh and blood / by the which ye ben (os
de ossibus meis / et caro de carne mea) Ye have power also to open heaven yates
and spare them. Against your power all hell may not resyste. I have boughte with
my precious blood of my fader all oblaco^ns / tithes (primogenita) and all
other lyuelode and goods longyng to the church here mylytau^t / and given
them to you servants of my church so that ye shall lack no thing. Orygene
says upon this text ( Leuit. xiij. quoth oi^a ai^alia prioge^ita) and all
vessels in the temple which were depute to the service of god were (sca^) and
no man should touch them but he yt were (scu^s) And so every priest which is
consecrate / is depute and hallowed to almighty god / and every part of his
body ought to be hallowed / and to be put to no occupacyon worldely / by the
which sin should grow thereof and god dysplesed / not to look and se amysse
/ here nor speak but yt which should be to his laud / nor handle no thing
with ye hondes / which should touch his body / but (q^ su^t mu^da) And as
saint Ierom says god almighty has an household in heaven al of virgyns and
clean creatures. Right so Christ set up here his household and his church /
and would have the^ chaste people and virgyns / and so by ye law every man
reccyued in to holy order should profess chastyte / as is noted (xxviij. did.
Ecce i prin. cu^ se) And as saint Ciprian says in the chapter (nec aliqua.
xxvij. q. i.) yt there was never man more Ielous of his wife yt she should cast
love to no man in famylyar talking / plesur in speech ne sight / but to hy^
oonly / than Christ is of his prestes / men and wy^men of relygyon / yt have
vowed chastyte. And is forbode (extra de vi. et ho. cle) prestes to dwell with
wy^men / hard it is to be among scorpyons and be not venymed. And a priest
also friends ought to use his garments acordynge to ye law of god and his
church (quod nec sint sordidi nec fulgidi. neque nimis long. nec nimis curte.
xli. did. ss. i.) And should always be dystyncte and known by their garments
from lay men. And if you se a priest go like a lay man / with his typpet /
slyppers / and great sleues / it is to presume yt he repents him yt ever he
forsook the habyte of a lay man / and therefore he uses it. And the penalyte
of them yt goon so is by the law they be suspended (ab ministraco^e) and other
pains lymytte in the Clementyne (de vita et ho. cle. ^xxi. q. iiij. per totu^)
And it is lawful to the church to have silver and gold / for it was never
forbode to saints ye use thereof / but ye abusing. And saint Ierom says (xij.
q. ij. c. Auru^. Auru^ h eccl^ia no^ vt seruet. s vt erroget. et in
necessitatibus subueniat) And Christ had (loculos) gold and silver for his
college (ct pro egenis and pauperibus) geuynge example as is ready (xij. i. c.
Exemplu^) that it is lawful for the church to have gold and silver under him
as dyspensatours. Therefore we all bishops / persons vycaryes / and other
spyrytuall persons have ye goods of the church (ad ministratores) and to
spend them to his commandment / accoidynge to his law and his church in
four manner wise / as is noted (.xij. q. ij..c. Quatuor. cu^. c. sc) which ben
these. First to se his church and chau^sell to him belonging be honorable
and worshypfully reparellyd. In this shall he please god specially / and to
himself great worship and merit. The second part of his good should be
spend above reparaco^n of his manco^n and lyuelode it to be reparellyd and
kept according to his behauour suffycyently / whereof himself shall have great
pleasure and thank of god and man. The third part to be spent in hospytalyte
/ keeping household and geuynge meet and drink to his parysshons and other
poor folks / and in this behalf he shall be compared to Abraham and Loath /
which diverse seasons fed angels / and by them they were delivered often time
fro great persecuco^n. And in thy keeping household you shall greatly please
Peter and Poul / yt persuad^^^ said unto prestes. Diligite hospitalitate^) and
noted (xvi. q. i. c. vlti^o) The fourth part ye must spend to get you
friends specyal to speak for you in time of need / which ben as Christ says
(pauperes) blind lame / and they which can not help themself / ne may not.
And scu^s Iohe^s Elemosinarius) called poor men and beggars his lords / for
they might best spepe for him / and help him with almighty god / which good
given unto them / is given unto Christ / and he woll defend all them yt
socoure and help the poor people / as is written (xxij. q. ij. Glia) No man may
spend their goods more honorably / than in these four causes ye which
Christ and his church has assygned us. And at our coming to Christ / we shall
have a special thank with words of comfort. Euge serve bone and fidel) And if
you deye in great riches and kept it (in sudario) and spent it not in reparacyon
of thy church / mansyon / keeping household / ne geuynge to poor people /
according to gods commandment and his church / thou shall be called (seruu^
nequa^) and called a theyf with Judas which had Crystys money in
admynystraco^n / and spend it otherwise than was Crystis commandment to his
own use and pleasure. And therefore he is called Fur in ye gospel of John and
in the said chapter (exemplu^.xij. q..i.) And have the pain lymytte as he
has / written (ex. de pe. clericorum in.c. penulti^o.

The copy of ye byll for remembrance of the proclamaco^ns for seculer men is
this / that Dauyd speaks by the auctoryte of the holy ghost. Iusti
hereditabunt terra^. psalo. xxxvio.) For as every priest in his conuersaco^n
and deeds / ought to be holy / so every christian man ought to be (iustus) a true
man. And as ye know by experyence / yt the fader of his child has a great
plasure being like him in hauour and condyco^ns. In like wise almighty god
has great pleasure in his childern true men being like unto him. Iustus dn^s.
et iusticias. dilexit. equitate^ vidit vultus eius) And as Arystotle says / no
virtue may make man so like almighty god / as Justice. The proprytee of man is
to desire to be (felice^) here in this world and so to live ever to have good
name and fame / and to have such things which is necessary to his exibycyon
/ and that that he has charge upon. Among all virtues moral is none to
conserve a man in all thing as is the virtue of Justice with true faith and
charity. And therefore it is written (Ius tus ex fide viuit. ad Hebre. x. et de
pe. did. iiij. In domo. et. xxiiij. q. i. vbi. Et iustus germinabit sicut
liliu^) A true man to be except and florysshe in the sight of all good men /
and they to be glad of his company. Et iustus vt palma florebit) a just man
shall as a palm tree endure. Dauyd friends with his merry songs which he
syngeth with his harp in his book called ye sawter / in ye psalm Noli
emulari. and Qua^ bonus. makes a dyologe after the common opinion of men /
bytwix a false man and a true liver co^syderynge the prouydence and ryghtwysnes
of god / yt an untrue man / which observes not nor keeps his law / has
peace without trouble. He has felycyte also in temporal goods / as is red (
eccliasti. vij. Iustus perit in iusticia sua. et impius multo tempore viuit in
malicia sua) The wicked man has riches to help him when he is seek by
physyke. A poor just man has none / and therefore lies in great pain. They
are never put to labor and afflycco^n / as other true poor men be / when
ought is to be done for the common we will / nor to pay tax / but at their
pleasure / and ever lives in their pleasure and solace / and so spared for
their riches / and oftyme ye good of Just men be perysshed by casueltees and
Ieoperdy of the sea and their goods ben spared and not perysshed. They
oppress ye Just men and despise god / though they have al thing at there
desire. This prouydence of god and pacyence made Dauyd to starker and muse in
his mind what this should mean / and could not find by no natural reason /
yt the unjust should thus be spared / and the poor just man punysshed Donec
intrare^ in sa^ctuariu^ dei and intelliga^ in nouissimis eorum Unto ye season
he has the scripture of god ruled and showed unto him / and he remembered (quod
iudicia dei vera su^t) And lykned these unjust men unto herbs which sown
soono grow and soon fade / and unto ye fume of a fire / the hyer it flees /
ye sooner it is destroyed / and unto a man in his sleep dremynge of much good
/ and when he waketh he is in pouerte as he was before / and we ben all a sleep
living in this world / till we shall be waked (in nouissi^a die tuba michelis)
And when Dauyd had consydred all this he song with his harp. Vidi impiu^
exaltatu^ sicut cedros libani and transiui et ecce no^ erat. quesiui and no^
inuentus locus eius) I saw said Dauyd wicked proud and unjust men exalted in
honor and worship as great hye trees of Lybanye / and soon after I sought
them and their progeny / and all their goods and proud servants about them
/ and could not find them above the earth / but they passed as a shadow. Of
this friends we have examples enough in our days without scripture / of great
men how they are passed with all their great dygnytees and riches / and little
speech is now of them. The said Dauyd therefore song with his said harp an
other balet / saying. Junior fui ethem^ senui: et no^ vidi iustu^ derelictu^.
nec semen eius quere^s pane^) that is to say I was young and now am I old /
and I saw never a true man yt god forsook but gave him help in time of need
to his profit / nor his childern being true at last danger of their extreme
pouertee. And what hungre or other trybulaco^ns they suffered / were for the
we will of their souls and everlasting Joy at their departing. The law of
god / and in like wise the law of natural reason would yt the fader should
make his sone his heir / and to succeed him in his goods and lyuelode. And as
I have experyence thereof / yt many faders which for the love they owe to their
childern sercheth to make ye lands sure unto their childern after their
dyscese / and costeth them much money to men of law for the same intent /
which as I have herd men of the law say / it is hard to do And durst not
take upon them to promise them. But friends I dare take upon me to make your
children and you also / sure and everlasting Joy / and not to be forgote /
but to be helped by almighty god here in this world / if ye woll get your
good truly with out sin and falshede / and of those goods so gotten / give
part of them in deeds of charity / as is written ( eccliastici. xliiij. Hij
su^t viri mi^e. quorum iusticie obliuione^ no^ acceperu^t. cu^ semine eorum
permanent bona hereditas sca^. nepotes eorum) These ben the words of the holy
ghoost / and thus much to say. These men which ben merciful in deeds of
charity / their ryghtwysnesse in their living and getynge of good truly /
shall never be forgote. His childern and neuewes shall enjoy his goods and
Inherytau^ce. Et in testamentes stetit seme^ eorum) As he dysposed in his
testament / so shall his will be performed. Wherefore if ye woll that your
childern shall enjoy your goods / pryncypally se yt they be well gotten. For the
ryghwysnes of ye fader / gives great Influence of grace to his succession / as
ensample of Abraham yt good true man gave to his sone Ysaac / and Ysaac to
Jacob his sone / and Jacob to his. xij. sons / of who^ comes the. xij. tribus
of Isrl. And as Lyre says the kingdom of Isrl was kept by a long season in ye
succession of Dauyd after his dyscesse / not for there merytes / but for the
goodness and truth of Dauyd / and therefore it is written In bonis iustorum
exaltabitur ciuitas and in perdico^e eorum erit laudacio. et in bn^dicco^e
iustorum exaltabit ciuitas) That cite which is replenysshed with good true men
/ is exalted / and to it all good men have good will to enhabyte therein. And
when a wicked man deyeth therein / to them it is a great reioysynge. And ye
blessyng of god which true Just men have / concerueth the cite in prosperyte.
And Archedeken (in rosario. c. hoc aute^. xxx. did. says. Si iusti fuerimus.
debemus deo honore^. sanctis imitaco^em. defunctis conpassione^. pro xio.
amore^. peccato odiu^. diabole continuu^ bellu^) First you must do honor and
worship to almyggty god with body and soul as thy creator. And in token
thereof / to yield unto hy^ tithes / oblaco^ns and other sacrefyces. Qr eius est
terra et plenitudo eius. viij. did. c. Quo iure) And secondly to follow
example of holy saints. A priest to follow saint Peter and the apostles /
saint Martyn and saint Nycholas holy confessors. And lay men to follow
Zachee. Which said to Christ. Si alique^ defraudaui. reddo quadruplu^) If I
have do any man wrong or desceyued him. I woll make amends with due
satysfaccyon / or else I know well I can not be called a Just man / and have
god in my house. The third to have co^passyon of them which be departed the
world and pray for them. And who so have any goods of there is / to dyspose
and do it not / and causes them to lie in pain. It is a great offense friends
to desceyue a man that is a live / but much more to desceyue him which is
deed And all brekers of a man's last will / be acursed as ye have herd often
times. The fourth / ye must love your neighbor as your self / and desceyue
him not / like as ye would not be desceyued yourself neither in word nor deed.
And good friends note oo word what I shall say to you / which John crysostom
says (in.c. eicie^s. lxxxviij. did) to al them yt uses choppyng and
chau^gynge what occupaco^n they be of / he byddeth them beware in their byeng
and sellyng / yt they use no oaths / perjury / nor desceyte / for all such
merchants Christ beat out of ye temple / and the prophet says. Quia no^
cognoui negociaco^es i^troibo i^ pote^cias dm^) I knew never such untrue
buyers and sellars enter in to ye kingdom of heaven. And he puts an example of
a man which syfueth or fanneth corn / the good corn falls through / and there
remains but stones and other harlatrye. Right so a man that has gotten with
oaths / lies / and fasehede his goods / let him restore all yt he has gotten
by that way / and there remains to himself but sin The fyfth is we should
hate sin. Sin is that thing which is contrary to all Justice / and
forbode by the law of god / as is written (.xv. q. i. c. i. in fie) And as
long as a man is in dedly sin / he is dread in the sight of god and called
(seruus peccati) a servant of the devil. And Ancelme says / when a man is in
dedly sin / all creatures made by almighty god abhors hy^. And therefore
says Seneca as ye glo. notes (xv. q. i. c. merito Si scire^ deos
ignoscituros. hoi^es ecia^ nescituros. adhuc dedignarer peccare) And he that
seaseth not to be in dedly sin / but contynewe therein / he shall have this
punysshment / to forgete god when he deyeth and to ask him mercy / as saint
Gregory notes in a sermon de Innoce^. and noted (xxxij. q. v. c. Sicut cu^
glo. John. et Guide.) No man can live so perfytly here ocupyed in ye world /
but he must fall in to vanyal sin / yt ben put away dyuersly / as by saying
his pr^ nr^ / by holy water / by alms deed / by tunco^n made on his breast / by
fasting / by anelyng / by general confession by blessyng of the bishop / and
priest being at mass and by contryco^n of thy sin / which all ben noted (de
pe. did. iij. de quotidianis. cum glo. Iohe^s et Guido. et ex. de pe. et re.
c. Oi^bus per hostien^) The vi. and last is to contynewe battle ever with the
devil. And who so ever woll have the vyctory of hy^ he must arm hy^ with
humylyte / which is the virtue yt he hates most in man here in the earth /
which virtue he forsook in heaven / therefore he is called the king of all
proud men. Job.xli. et.xiij. did. Nulli per Guido) I fere friends yt he is a
great king over many folks and much people in this land now a days / as
apperyth by their array / and many gooth in his clothing / exceeding their
power / office / blood and dygnyte. And right as the devil presumed to be like
almighty god / exceeding his order and degree and so cast out of heaven / and
is and shall be in everlasting pain. Right so all proud men now being in
this land / werynge their garments in form and manner of them / that put
Christ to death / and his saints as ye may se in stories of pycture thereof. The
abhomynaco^n of their clothing and mysshappe thereof / is far out of reason /
that it passes my wit to show the vnthryftenesse thereof / and the pains
put in holy scripture which they shall suffer for their mysbehauour in this
behalf. And therefore almighty god says these words written. Sophonie. io.
Visitabo super oe^s qi induti su^t vest peregrina) I shall punysshe all them
yt brings in new shape of garments / which causes my people to fall to
wantennesse / and in varyau^ce of their array. Therefore saint Ierom says upon
this text. Sanguis ft^is tui clamat vindicta^ ad me) who so ever brings in a
wrong custom in to a cite / or any shape of garments which should cause
sin among the people / as long as it is used he shall never come in heaven.
Friends I remember days here before in my yongthe / yt there was a virtuous
monk of Bury called Lydgate / which wrote ma ny noble hystoryes / and made
many virtuous balettes to the increase of virtue / and oppressyon of vice. And
among other he made a treatise called Galand. and all the kyndred of Galand he
dyscryued therein. I suppose if galantes understood the progeny / they would
refuse to be of yt felyshyp and kyndred. The occasyon of making this book was
when english men were beat out and had lost France. Gascoyn. Gyon. and
Normandye / and came home dysguysed in their garments in every part of their
bodies / which englyssh men saw never before. And many followed the lewd and
abhomynable garments / in so much yt all good men cried out of them. And this
good monk in detestacyon of their sin and wretchedness made the said book
in balette wise. And the repete of every balett was this. England may wayle yt
ever Galand came here. And in short season after / were great surrecco^ns / and
murdre of lords and other / as I doubt not many yt lives can remember it. I
pray god they may amend them / yt we be not punysshed for them and wayle
their wretchedness / for by cause we suffer ye subgettes of the king of pride
to dwell among us. Friends I say the words of Christ unto you which I took
to my time. Qui habet aures audiendi. audiat) yt these words which ye have
herd by my symplenesse and by your materyall eeres / may be understand also
by your Inward eeres of your soul by true Intellecte / and so put in
execusyon. For I say unto you as saint Ierom says in an epistle / and saint
Austen in like wise (quod no^ su^t nuge et friuola que dixi vobis Sed su^t
scripture et verba dei) And therefore saint Poul says. Syres take good head at
the law of god / and perform it in yt you is (qia deus no^ irridetur) he will
not be laughed to scorn / but punysshe them that by word or deed despyseth
his commandment Then friends I end thus / besechynge each one of you / to
remember and keep the five proclamacyons which I have showed unto you. And ye
of the spyrytualte to call to mind your bylle of remembrance to be holy in
your conuersaco^n. And ye masters of the temporalte to remember your bylle of
Justice and truth to god and man. And if ye have grace thus to do. I answer
and dare promise in the name of Christ Ihesu / ye shall have Joy that the eye
may not se / nor heart can think / nor tongue can speak / to the which god
bring all.

Amen.
