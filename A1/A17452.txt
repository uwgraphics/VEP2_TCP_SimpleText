LONDONS LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US.
A true Relation of five modern Plagues or Visitations in London, with the
number of all the Diseased that were buried: viz: The first in the year of
Queen Elizabeth, Anno 1592, the second in the year 1603, the third in that
(never to be forgotten year) 1625. The fourth in Anno 1630. The fifth this now
present Visitation 1636, which the LORD of his mercy deliver London and England
from.
Certain approved Medicines for the Plague, both to prevent that contagion, and
to expel it after it be taken, as have been approved in Anno. 1652. as also in
this present Visitation 1636.
A cheap Medicine to keep from infection.
TAke a pint of new milk, and cut two cloves of Garlic very small, put it
in the milk, and drink it mornings fasting, and it preserves from infection.

REader, what ever thou art, rich or poor,
Rowse up thy self, for death stands at the door;
If God says strike, he must and will come in
For death we know is the reward of sin.
His very breath is so infectious grown,
He poisons every one he breathes upon;
He is the rich man's terror, makes him fly,
And bear away his bags, as loath to dye.
What shall the poor do that behind do stay?
Death makes them rich by taking them away.
But what shall poor men do, then that do live,
It Is surely fit the rich should comfort give,
And weekly means unto them still afford*
Oh such rich men shall be rich in the Lord!
Death startles all, but more the guilt of sin,
Which sinful man long time has lived in,
Does make them fearful of that punishment.
Due unto sin, for time that is evil spent.
Oh why was this not thought on long ago!
When God expected our repentance so?
When six years since, a little Plague God sent,
He shoke his rod to move us to repent:
Not long before that time, a dearth of corn
Was sent to us to see if we would turn:
And the last Summer none deny it can,
The beasts did suffer for the sin of man:
Grass was so short and small, that it was told,
Hey for four pound a load was daily sold.
These judgments God has sent even to cite us
Unto repentance, and from sin to fright us.
Oh stubborn England! childish and unwise,
So heavy laden with iniquities:
Return, return, unto thy loving Father,
Return I say, and so much the rather,
Because his Son thy Savior pleads thy cause,
Though thou have broken all his holy laws:
Say to thy self, my sins are cause of all
Gods judgments that upon this land does fall,
And sin's the cause that each one does complain
They have too much, sometimes too little rain:
Say to thy self, this Plague may be removed,
If I repent, as plainly may be proved
By Niniveh, that City great and large,
For God has given to his Angels charge,
To strike and to forbear as he sees fit;
If it be so, then learn thou so much wit,
To use thy best endeavor to prevent
A plague, which thou may do if thou repent.
Let all infe^^^d houses be thy Text,
And make ^^is use, that thine may be the next.
The red cross still is used, as it has bin,
To show they Christians are that are within.
And Lord have mercy on us on the door,
Puts thee in mind to pray for them therefore.
The watchman that attends the house of sorrow,
He may attend upon thy house to morrow.
Oh where is the vows we to our God have made!
When death and sickness came with axe and spade,
And hurld our brethren up in heaps a pace,
Even forty thousand in a little space:
And now again he does with us begin,
TO increase the Plague, as we increase in sin:
Each spectacle of death and funeral,
Puts thee and I in mind we must dye all.
A Prayer fit to be used in this time of sickness and mortality.
O Lord God, strong and mighty, great and fearful, which dwell in the
heavens, and workest great wonders; we thy miserable children here on earth,
do most humbly beseech thee to be merciful unto us, to pardon our offenses,
and forgive us all our sins: O Lord enter not into judgment with thy
servants, for if thou do, there shall no flesh be saved in thy sight: we
confess and acknowledge O Lord, that it is our sins which have moved thee to
wrath, and to show such fearful tokens of thy displeasure toward us in these
our days; first by locking up the heavens that no rain should fall to succor
the earth, nevertheless upon our repentance and humility, it has pleased thee
of thy fatherly goodness to send down some sweet comfortable showers of thy
mercy upon the earth. O Lord increase our thankfulness, and give us grace to
amend our lives, that thou may turn from us all those judgments which we
most righteously have deserved; thou have sent thy messengers of mercy, thy
Ministers of thy holy Word to allure us by fair means to repentance, thou
have sent Monsters from the Sea, and cast them up upon our English shore,
fearful and strange to behold, to cry out against us; nay, thou have suffered
the tempter, that old enemy of man's salvation, to work upon the weakness of
some of our poor brethren, to assume unto themselves the names of Prophets, to
prophecy evil against this nation; but thou have disclosed the subtilty of
the Serpent unto us, that as he was a liar from the beginning, so thou have
proved his Prophets to be false Prophets, by sending down these sweet and
comfortable showers of rain upon the earth, giving us to understand, that
Prophesying is ceast, and that no man is worthy to know the secrets of thy
will. Nevertheless though we are not Prophets, nor Prophets children, yet we
cannot but expect utter desolation and destruction without speedy repentance:
Give us, O give us repentant hearts, that we may be truly humbled at the sight
of our sins, and walk in newness of life all the days of our life: we
bese^ch thee good Father to turn in mercy to us, and remove from us this
Sickness lately begun among us: LORD command the destroying Angel to hold his
hand, that our brethren which are fled from us for the preservation of their
lives, may return again with joy, that we with them may praise and glorify
thy name, now and for evermore, Amen.
