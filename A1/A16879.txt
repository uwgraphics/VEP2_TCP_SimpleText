To the right Honorable, Henry Earl of Huntingdon, Lord Hastings, Hungerford,
Botreaux, Molines and Moiles, my singular good Lord.
I Have studied (right Honorable) what way I might manifest my tha^kfull
mind, for the exceeding favors, wherewith I and mine are bound unto your
house for ever. I find none more likely, then if I might add somewhat (after
the faithful and happy travels of others) to your present and immortal
honor. Considering therefore, that the God of heaven, has set you in so high
a place, not only in his own eye, but also in the view of your country, to
be beholden of all, as a mark, for the salvation or perdition of very many,
and that little faults in your Honor, must needs much blemish you, as a
virtuous life shall make you glorious: I have endeavored for my part to put into
your hands a true glass and perfect map: Iam. 1. 25.
, a glass which will not flatter you in showing your spotts, because it is the
Lords, a map which will not deceive you, for the narrow way of life, because
it is bounded by the Lord himself, trodden by our Savior, with all his holy
Saints, which have gone before you; yet so small as you may ever carry in
your bosom. My humble suite at the hands of the Lord and your honor is this,
that when you have tried them to be such, (where the superstitious Papists
spend some hours in blind devotions) you would bind your self by a constant
vow before the Lord, to spend but one hour weekly, besides other your holy
exercises, in vewing your self in this Crystal glass, Iam. 1. 23. 24. 25.
desirous to cleanse your spotts hereby; and to consider your ways according to
this map, Psalm. 119. 59.
laboring so to direct your steps: for setting your self with resolute
purpose of heart Acts. 11. 23.
to walk herein all your days, you have the Lords own promise, that he will
make you truly honorable in the sight of all men, 1. King. 3. 11. 12. 13.
as ever was any of your Progenitors, so as your very enemies shall acknowledge
it, Dent. 4. 6. 7. and 28, 10. 11. 12. 13.
and he afraid of you: and that he will moreover prolong your days, and give
you a guard of his glorious Angels for your safety, Psa. 91. 11. 12. and 34. 7.
to bear you in their hands in the day time, and in the night season, when
you are secure, to pitch their tents about you: your country shall be blessed,
that ever God vouchsafed such a light unto it. 1. King. 10. 8. 9.
Where any point seems doubtful there make a mark. Phil. 3. 15.
walk in the rest until the Lord clear that unto you. As this shall add
unto me joy, 2. Ioh. 1. 2. 3. 4.
so for thousands which now pray for the increase of this honor, many times
ten thousands shall ever praise the God of heaven for you. Now is the time, all
men's eyes are upon you. Your honor knows the proverb well. Magistratus virum
indicat. Strive forward cheerfully (most noble Earl) in this narrow way of
life, Mat. 7. 14.
according to the hopes now long conceived of you, following herein all the
worthies of the heavenly Jerusalem, Apoc. 21. 26. 27.
and you shall live with them immortallie; but if you should turn to the broad
way of all the world (which the Lord forbid) you must perish with the world
eternally. Apoc 22. 14. 15. Mat. 7. 13.
The Angel has sworn it, Mar. 8. 38.
Time shall be no more, Apo. 10. 6.
but how soon it is unknown unto you. Luke 12. 20. 21. 34. 35. 36.
Take it now while it is called to day; Heb 3. 7. 13
pay your vows and shine for evermore. Dan. 12. 3. Psalm. 56. 12. and 50. 14.


Your Honors for ever most bounden. I. Brinsley.

To the Christian Reader.
COnsidering (christian Reader) that in every place, all those who have found
any sound comfort in the Gospel, are desirous to express the same in their
conuersations, by walking in thankfulness as it becomes the servants of
Christ, to adorn their profession, and yet notwithstanding the greatest part
do much fail herein: I have thought it my bounden duty to afford unto the^
such help as God has vouchsafed me in this behalf. For alas it it too
manifest, that too many even of them, do omit sundry and those of most
necessary duties, as by looking perhaps to some of the duties of the first
Table, neglect the second, or to the second only omit the first, which is
called the great commandment: or looking only to the law, are too short for
the gospel: or boasting of faith regard not works. Others lie in fearful
sins thorough ignorance hereof. And very many are observed daily to fall into
grievous offenses, to the dishonor of Christ, and discredit of their
profession, yea to the grief of the godly, offending the weak, hardening the
ungodly eye, to open the mouths of the Papists, and Atheists, with all the
profane, to blaspheme that glorious name whereby we are called. And not only
so, but more also to the wounding of their own consciences, and giving
advantage to Satan, to accuse them before the Lord. Nay sundry of most
upright hearts, and who have made good proceedings in godliness, are yet known
to lie languishing under the burden of their sins, and fear of Gods
displeasure, thorough want of knowledge how to find out their special
offenses, whereby their consciences are disquieted, and Gods hand does lie so
heavily upon them: Many living in continual doubt whether they be in the
favor of God or no: great multitudes in all places ordinarily thrusting
themselves irreverently into the presence of the Lord, to the word, sacraments,
and all other exercises of the service of God, without any examination, or
preparation of their hearts before, to the provoking of the grievous wrath of
the Lord thereby. Now for these (I say) and for all other, whose desire is to
walk with God, and be pleasing unto him, finding the true felicity that is in
godliness, I have thought my self bound by the Communion of Saints, to offer
this my poor labor, which first was undertaken for my self and some few of
my christian friends: the better to prevent all the former evils, and for the
more easy obtaining the benefits following such a careful watch. Herein I
have used the help of sundry learned and godly divines, following chiefly the
direction of these two holy men of GOD, Master Greenham and Master Perkins;
whose writings were the first occasions of thinking hereof: M. Greenha^ in the
comfort of an afflicted conscience page 130.
the one requiring this examination necessarily unto true and sound repentance,
M. Perkins. of the practice of repentance. cap. 7.
the other for the thorough curing of the wounded conscience. And hence also I
have bin more encouraged, to make this public, not upon any vain or by
respect, but by some gracious experience of the profit hereof in both
accordingly: especially in restoring some of no mean note, from much trouble,
and horror of conscience, to exceeding joy, and strong assurance, when all
other means have failed. Neither can this seem strange to any considering it
aright; for what is it that brings that peace and joy of conscience passing all
understanding to a Christian soul but an assured testimony of our conscience,
that we do not lie in any one sin, so far as by wise searching we are
able to find it out, but hate and abhor even the very least? and contrarily,
that we have begun, and so strive on forward to walk in every commandment of
God without reproof: and that of true love to our Lord and Savior: for to
such a soul only all the promises do appertain, as they are applied
thorough the whole Book of GOD. In a word, I have been more imboldened, by
observing daily, how on the one side the godly preachers, upon every occasion,
calling men to repentance, exhort all earnestly with the Prophet Jeremy to
examine and try their ways, La^. 39. 40.
and turn again unto the Lord, if ever they will find mercy with him: which
work of examination hardly one of a thousand knows how to perform in any
good measure, as may bring true comfort unto their souls. And on the other
side, how many of our simple seduced brethren, have bin drawn to a dislike of
our religion and a liking of popery, by this especially, because ours, (as they
say) is a religion of carnal liberty, theirs of holiness, ours full of
divisions and uncertainty, theirs of perfect unity, that they also may see
hereby, that ours is indeed a religion of perfect holiness and unity
prescribed by the Lord himself, whereunto so many of us as are truly called
to the sound profession of it, do strive instantly to attain day and night: so
worshipping the God of our fathers, in spirit and trneth: walking in the self
same narrow way of eternal life. And that all their imagined holiness is
nothing for the most part, but mere superstition, in outward shows, of men's
inventions, concerning which, GOD will ask them one day, Esa. 1. 12.
who has required the^ at their hands, Deu. 4. 2. and 12. (...). 32.
altogether neglecting most of the duetyes of true piety, as those of the first
table: that so they perceiving how they have been dedeluded, Act. 13. 48
(may at least some of them whom God has ordained unto life) come out off the
snare of the devil, 2. Tim. 2. 25. 26.
and join themselves to us again: Ap. 14. 9. 10. 11.
so to escape that torment which all that receive the mark of the beast, by
any such submission to that Roman Antichrist, must eudure for evermore. Pardon
me therefore, that I have presumed to offer this unto thee, seeing that how
plain so ever it is, yet it may prove profitable (as I hope) to many thousand
poor souls, who want leisure or ability to search greater volumes, being so
brief and easy for all: and also that it may be to me as the widows mite,
thrown into the treasure of the Lord, If thou be one who by reason of thy
ripeness and perfection, despisest it, as having no need of any such a help,
yet have compassion of thy brethren: neither know thou what a day may bring
forth: or if thou see the good that may come to very many by such a course,
help to perfect, that which is here thus begun, or at least, if God shall
persuade thee, of the benefit which thy self may reap hereby spend one hour
with me constantly every week, in trying thy ways, and turning thy feeete
unto the testimonies of the Lord. And then, as I cannot doubt of thy prayers
for me, so I assure my self that the chief comfort and blessing shall turn
into thine own bosom; thy Lord and Savior shall be glorified by thee, the
godly edified by thy holy ensample, the wicked converted, or at the least have
their mouths stopped, and be left more without excuse.

Meditate seriously of these worthy places of scripture.
Let not this book of the law, depart out off thy mouth, but meditate therein
day and night, that thou may observe and do according to all that is written
therein, for then shall thou make thy ways prosperous, and then shall thou have
good success. Ios. 1. 8.

Blessed is the man that does not walk in the council of the wicked, nor
stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful. Psalm. 1. 1.

But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day
and night. 2.

For he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that will bring
forth her fruit in due season: whose leaf also shall not fade, so whatsoever
he shall do shall prosper. 3.

The wicked are not so, but as the chafe. etc. 4.

VVhete withal shall a young man redress his way in taking heed thereto
according to thy word. Psa. 119. 9.

I considered my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. verse. 59.

I made have and delayed not the time, to keep thy commandments. 60.

Oh how love I thy law? it is my meditation continually. 67.

By thy commandment, thou have made me wiser then mine enemies, for they are
ever with me. 98.

I have had more understanding then all my teachers, for thy testimonies are my
meditation. 99.

I understood more then the ancient, because I kept thy precepts. 100.

I refrayned my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. 101.

Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my paths. 105.

Thy testimonies are my delight and my cou^cellors 24.

They are better unto me, then thousands of gold and silver. 72.

The Lord is with you whilst you are with him, if you seek him he will be
found of you, but if you forsake him he will forsake you. 2. Chapter 15. 2.

The hand of our God, is upon all them that seek him in goodness, but his
power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. Exr. 8. 22.

The just shall live by faith, but if any withdraw himself, my soul shall
take no pleasure in him. Heb. 10. 38.

Because iniquity shall be increased, the love of many shall wax cold, but he
that endures to the end he shall be saved. Mat. 24. 12. 13.

Prou. 3. 21, 22. ad 26. et 4. 6, 19, 20, 21, 22 Job. 22. 21, 22* 23. 10, 11,
12. 28. 28. Mat. 7. 13. 14. Apo. 22. 14.
Wherefore is living man sorrowful? man suffers for his sin. Let us search
and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord. Let us lift up our hearts
with our hands to God in the heavens. Lam. 3. 39. 40, 41.

When I held my tongue my bones consumed, or when I roared all the day. Then I
acknowledged my sin unto thee, neither hid I mine Iniquity: for I thought I
will confess against my self, my wickedness unto the Lord, and thou
forgauest the punishment of my sin. Psa. 32. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.

Job. 33. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28.
The trial of our estate.
The means whereby we may obtain a certain assurance, that we are the
children of God, and in his favor, and also get the same more confirmed daily.
THe means is, 2. Cor. 13. 5
by a careful examination of our selves, 1. Cor. 11. Mar. 1. 15.
whether we feel these two graces, Act. 1. 38. Luke 3. 3.
Repentance and Faith: Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 3. 26.
and that increased in us, or at least continued: Col. 3. 9. 10. 11.
for hereby we have put off the old man and put on the new, and so are
acceptable to the Lord through Jesus Christ.

2. The rule of our trial.
We must try our repentance by the law of God, Heb. 6. 1.
whereof the ten Commandments are the sum: and our faith by the Gospel,
Mat. 1. 15.
whereof the Articles of our faith contain a short sum also.

3. The Subject of our trial or parts to be examined,
We must examine our selves, and that for all parts. 2. Cor. 13. 5.


1. 1 These 5. 23.
Our mind whether it be enlightened to know that which is good and to be
embraced, Col. 1. 9. 10
and that which is evil for to be avoided. Heb. 5. 14. 1, These. 5. 21.


2. Our memory whether it do firmly keep those things that it has learned.
Psa. 119. 11.


3. Pro. 7. 1. 2.
Our will whether it choose the good and refuse the evil. Luke 2. 51. Romans 7.
18. 9. 20.


4. Our affections whether they love that which god loves, hate that which he
hates. Romans 7. 22. 24.


5. 1. Cor. 6. 20
Our body whether it endeavor to perform every duty accordingly and in every
part, Romans 6. 12. 19.
and all this at all times and in all places. Iam. 1. 26.


All these parts being the Lords, Deu. 6. 4. 5. 6*
he does require this holiness in them all, and that by striving to
perfection. Mat. 22. 37. Luke 10. 27. 1. These. 5. 23. Phil. 3. 12. 13.

Time of our examination.
The fittest time is. Eccl. 4. 17. Ps. 26. 6. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 31.


1. In our preparation to the Saboth, to observe it continually.

2. More carefully before our receiving the sacrament or before a fast public.
private.
Joel. 2. 12. 13. 17.

The reason is because the Lord will be sanctified in all them that come near
unto him in any such special manner And moreover we may certainly expect a
measure from him of blessing, Leu. 10. 3, Exo. 19. 22
as we measure to him in our preparation to such holy exercises. Mat. 7. 2.
Mar. 4. 24.


Place for our examination.
The meetest place is, Psa. 4. 4. 5.
where we may be most secret, and freest from distractions, setting our selves
as in the presence of GOD with whom we have to deal, and where we may most
freely power out our souls without suspicion of hypocrisy.

Helps before our examination, to make it more powerful.
We may use the help of this threefold consideration.

1. Of the misery into which every sin brings us until we have truly
repented of it.

2. How our sins are made more heinous by circumstances.

3. The blessings following a holy conversation.

The first help, viz. danger of impenitency in any sin.
1. By every sin we dishonor God more or less, according to the quality
thereof, and so provoke him to dishonor us again. 1. Sam. 2. 30.

2. Every sin defaceth in some sort the Image of God in us, which we should
labor to repair daily. This image is the holiness commanded in the whole
law. Col. 3. 9. 10.

3. Each makes us in part like Satan, whom in that sin we resemble, John. 44.
giving him advantage thereby both to accuse us before the Lord, 1. Ioh. 5. 18
and to lay special claim to us for the same, Job. 1. 9. 10 11. 12.
or at least to get liberty to afflict us thereupon.

4. Each as a cloud separates between the Lords mercy and us, Esa. 59. 2.
hides from us the comfortable light of his countenance, Ios. 24. 19. 20.
hinders the course of his graces, Ier. 5. 25.
for our God is so holy, Psa. 5. 4. 5.
that no evil can dwell with him, and so turns away blessings temporal and
spiritual.

5. Prouokes the anger of our most loving father against us, as the faults of
children do of their parents. 1. Cor. 10 22. Exodus 4. 14. 24. Ioh. 22. 17. 18.

6. Brings distrust of Gods providence, Psalm. 50. 16. 17. 18.
and weakeneth our faith in all his promises by the same example of a lewd
child continuing obstinate against the parents in any fault, Esa. 1. 12. 13. to
17. 66. 3.
so that we cannot say that God is our God, or that we are his dutiful people
and children, and in his favor so long as we continue therein. The trial of
this in our most serious prayers in time of trouble is most evident.

7. Brings temporal scourges on our bodies, Exo. 4. 24. 26.
goods, friends or name, whereby the Lord shows his hatred of every sin even
in his own children, 1. Cor. 11. 30. 31.
awakeneth them, Number. 27. 12. 13. 14. and. 20. 12. 24.
that they may not be condemned with the world, preuents the like in themselves
and others, as David's ensample fully declares.

8. Greiues Gods spirit to cause it to depart so far, Ephesians. 4. 30.
as that we shall loose al sound feeling of any true comfort in Christ, 1.
These. 5. 19.
be made unable to pray, Ps. 95. 8. 9. 51. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.
hear or perform any spiritual duty aright, and contrarily become hard
hearted without all sense of sin or Gods Anger for it, to cost us many a
sorrowful heart before we recover it again: to teach us to know Gods
holiness and our own vileness, Cant. 5. 2. 3. 6. 7.
and so to be made more watchful after to keep and stir up the spirit, to
make more account of it and give it better intertainement.

9. Brings a wounded conscience, Pro. 18. 14.
the greatest plague of all other, for the conscience will keep a remembrance,
though it sleep until God awake it, and call it to an account, Gen 4 7.
and then will follow.

1. Shame to make us run from God as Adam. Genesis 3. 8.
2. Sadness as in Naball. 3. Terrible fear, as in Bellchazzar. 4. Despair as
in Cain, Saul, Judas, Achitophel.
5. A hell in our consciences that we shall be as the raging sea, Esa. 57. 20
21.
casting out our own shame, the worm of conscience beginning to gnaw without
hope of release or any ease, unless all this be prevented by speedy and
unfeigned repentance in this life, which we know not whether it shall be
continued unto the morning. Luke 12. 20.


10. Barreth us out of heaven and depriueth us utterly of all the joys
thereof. Mat. 5. 19.
1. Cor. 6. 9 10. 11.

11. Thrusts us into hell to abide the torment thereof with Satan and his
Angels for evermore. Apo. 21. 8. Gal. 3. 10 Romans 6. 23. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Genesis 2.
17.

The second help, viz. by considering the circumstances whereby our sins are
made so sinful.
1. The terrible majesty of the glorious God against whom the sin is
committed, declared evidently in the punishment of the Angels, Adam, the old
world, Sodom, at the giving of the Law on mount Sinay, 2. These. 1. 7 8. 9. 10.
and to be revealed more fearfully, when Christ shall come with thousand
thousands of glorious Angels to take an account for the keeping thereof, in
flaming fire to render vengeance to all who know not God, being disobedient to
the gospel of Christ.

2. Because our sins have bin committed against his mercies bestowed upon us,
both ordinary and extraordinary. 2. Sam. 12. 7. 8.

3. Against the checks of our consciences which have bin convinced for the
same. Ioh. 15. 22. 24. Romans 1. 18. 21.

4. Against our high calling. 1. These. 2. 12. and 4. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 1. Pet.
1. 15.

5. Against our covenants at baptism, our vows often renewed, with many holy
motions and purposes. Ezech. 16. 4. 6. 8 Eccle. 5. 3. 4. 5.

6. Against threats, and examples of Gods Judgments and his fatherly
chastisements. Dan. 5. 18. 22. 23. 24.

7. By committing the same sins often after our repentance and pardon obtained.
2. Pet. 2. 22.

The third help, viz. by considering the blessings following a holy
conversation.
As, 1. The escaping of all the former misery of sin. Deuteronomy. 6. 24 25.

2. We shall honor God and adorn his Gospel and so be honored of him
again. Tit. 2. 10.

3. We shall repair his image daily, to cause him to delight in us. Ephesians. 4. 23
24. Col. 3. 10.

4. We shall get more assurance of his favor, Psa. 34. 10. 18. 37. 24. 25.
fatherly protection and providence for all benefits, so far as may stand
with his own glory, our salvation and the good of his Church.

5. We shall obtain boldness and power in prayer. Pro. 28. 1. Psalm. 4. 3.

6. We shall escape many scourges Heb. 12. 5. Ap. 3. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 30. 31. 32

7. We shall stir up and rejoice the spirit of God in us, and so get an
increase of al graces: for to him that has shall be given and he shall have
abundance. Math 25. 29.

8. We shall dismaie and drive away Satan, with all temptations and
accusations. Mat. 4. 11. James. 4. 7.

9. We shall stop the mouths of all the wicked when we may bear their
reproach as a crown, and so have boldness in the day of trial to stand forth
for any good cause. Job. 31. 35. 36

10. We shall get and keep a good conscience, Pro. 15. 15.
which is a continual feast, Ro^. 14. 17.
even the beginning of the Kingdom of Heaven in peace and joy in the holy
Ghost, Psa 91. 11 and 34. 7.
with assurance of the guard of the Angels, and all other blessings thereunto
belonging. Mat. 11. 29. 30.

11. We shall escape the lake and torment which all the foolish, that is, all
impenitent sinners must endure for evermore. Apo. 21. 8.

12. We shall obtain the crown and kingdom laid up for all those who thus
walk with God, 2. Tim. 4. 7. 8. 1. Cor. 2. 9.
even the joys which never eye saw, Mat 6. 1. 4. 6. 18. and 10. 42.
nor never ear heard, nor entered into man's heart for to consider of, with a
certain reward of every good duty that ever we performed.

13. And so having the full assurance of all the promises for the life present,
1: Tim. 4. 8
and that to come, we shall be able to wait continually, for the appearing of
our Lord and savior, crying always, come Lord Jesus, Come quickly. Apoc. 22.
20.

Some other rules to be observed for our direction and comfort in our
examination.
1. That we examine for sins.

1. past. 2. present. 3. Which we are in danger of.

2. Concerning sins past, Psalm. 25. 7. and 51. 1. 2. 17.
whether we have so unfeignedly repented of them, that the very remembrance of
them is grievous unto us.

3. A contrite heart after every offense, Psalm. 51. 4. 17.
because we have therein offended our loving God, with a lively hatred of the
same, and a resolute purpose never to commit it again, (looking withal at
Christ, Zac. 12. 10
whom we have pierced thereby) is as much with God, for all satisfactorie
punishment, as if there had been no sin committed; with David's speech (I
have sinned) is joined the answer of the Prophet: The Lord has put away thy
sin: but we are never to rest until we feel our hearts so affected. 2.
Sa^. 12. 13


4. For sins of which we are in danger, Ioh. 15. 7. and 16. 23. 24.
because we are strongly inclined to them, or otherwise, or for graces which we
want, let us beg in faith earnestly, looking at Christ. Math. 77. and 21. 22.
Let us ask the ouercomming of any sin, using all the means thereunto, 1.
Ioh. 5. 14 Iam. 4. 3.
especially avoiding the occasions of it, and we shall prevail by little and
little, until we attain a perfect conquest, Mat. 5. 6. and 15. 22. 25. 27. 28.
through the victory of Jesus Christ, Ioh. 7. 38.
so for any grace or an increase thereof, Psalm. 10. 17. and 145. 18. 19.
let us importune the Lord after the same manner, Romans 8. 26
and we shall obtain the graces, Dan. 6. 10.
for such a begging is the grace we crave, Exo. 29. 38. 39.
In 1. Acceptance. 2. Beginning or first fruits. 3. Pledge of perfection.


5. Our begging must be by solemn prayer upon our knees, Psa. 25. 1. and 123.
1. 2. 3.
morning and evening at least, 1. These. 5. 17.
with giving special thanks for that measure of grace we have attained unto,
and by the earnest lifting up of our hearts continually.

6. We must beware that we neither trust so much to our prayers, Mat. 4. 7.
as to cause us to neglect any other means ordained of God for whatsoever we
desire, but that we use them all still more conscionably, especially the
principal, Psalm. 127. 1. 2.
as the word preached, and all other in order, neither that we trust so much
to the other means as to neglect prayer.

7. So many sins as we have overcome of conscience and love to God, or graces
as we have thus attained to or can pray earnestly for, Gal. 5. 22. 23. 24.
so many lively evidences we have of the sanctifying spirit of God, Romans 6. 5.
and of our sound regeneration so long as we lie not in any one known sin: and
as we grow herein, Romans 6. 12. 14.
so grow we in assurance before God.

8. In all these God accepts our endeavor to obey, as perfect obedience, so
that it be total in every part, Neh. 1. 11.
viz. in our mind, Mat. 17. 20.
conscience, will and affections, Act. 11. 23.
and also earnest to do what we can without hypocrisy, Esa. 42. 3.
as he did Abraham's resolution to offer Isaac, Genesis 22. 16 17.
and as the kind father accepts the endeavor of the child, Mal. 3. 17.
or as it is in alms, 2. Cor. 8. 12
where a man is accepted according to that which he has, 1. Ion. Iam. 4. 3
and not according to that which he has not: so that there be first a willing
mind, Mat. 5. 6.
so is it in all graces if there be a strife with hungring after more until
we come to a perfect man, Ephesians. 4. 13. 14.
even the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.

9. Gods grace is sufficient for us. To 1. Supply that which is wanting. 2.
Forgive that which is committed. 3. Impute Christ's obedience. 2. Cor. 12. 9.
4. Support our weakness. 5. Restore and raise us up being fallen.


10 Gods power is made perfect, 2. Cor. 12. 9
or manifest thorough our weakness that God may be glorified and we humbled
continually, that he that rejoices may rejoice in the Lord. 1. Cor. 1. 31.

11. In greater measure of graces as we get more assurance, so we must return
more thankfulness, and become more humbled, watching against pride, 1. These.
5. 18.
for fear of the messenger of Satan to buffet us: for pride springs up, 2.
Cor. 12. 7
when all other sins dye.

12 In less measure we are to mourn after an increase by the careful use of
all the means, Mat. 5. 6.
for more assurance and comfort, 1. These. 4. 1. 10.
least we deceive both our own selves and others, having nothing but a show,
being as the foolish Virgins, and as the barren Fig Tree. Math. 25. 2. 3. Luc.
13. 7.

The Glass of the Law, or Map of the narrow way of life, through every
commandment, whereby we beholding our own natural misery, may be driven
daily to put on Christ, and considering our ways, may turn our feet to the
testimonies of the Lord.
IN all this view, we must ever remember to be thankful for every grace
received, mourn for every sin committed, looking at Christ crucified,
begging pardon through him, and the imputation of his obedience: In all wants we
are to entreat an increase of strength and grace through him, Pro. 4. 18
by lifting up our hearts until we attain to perfection, Ephesians. 4. 13 14.
observing how we grow in grace daily and in subduing of every sin. 2. Pet. 3.
17.

This is the way, walk in it. Esa. 30. 21.

Lord open thou mine eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy law. Psa. 119. 18.

1. Commandment. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.
Which inioynes us to have Iehoua only for our God, and commands the parts of
his inward worship.

Here we are to examine how we walk foreward more cherfully in these principal
duties, which are the very entrances to all true godliness.
1. Knowledge of God, Pro. 6. 22. 23.
and of his will revealed in his word] which is a principal part of the image
of god, Col. 1. 10. 3. 10.
whereof we may glory, Phi. 1. 9. 10
and without which we must needs perish, Ier. 9. 23. 24.
being unable to go one step toward the Kingdom of heaven. Hos. 4. 6.

2. Faith] Whereby we believe God to be our God, and withal every part of his
word, so as we feel the power of it in our hearts. as of 1. Commandments, to
obey them readily, as Noah and Abraham. 2. Judgments and threats, to terrify
us from sin as the Ninevites. 3. Promises to comfort us, and encourage us to go
on more cheerfully in godliness, Heb. 11. 2. 6
as Abraham and all the fathers who received good report hereby. Without this it
is impossible to please God. Romans 14. 23.


3. Confidence in Gods prouidence] to be able to cast our burden only upon
God, Psa. 55. 22.
rejoicing in him always, Phil. 4 4.
that he is our God: Psa. 3. 6.
full of Christian courage as David, Nehemiah, Daniel. Neh. 6. 10 Dan. 6. 10.

4 Patience with cheerfulness in the midst of all our trialls, even then
when God seemerh to have forgotten us, Romans 8. 28.
or to frown upon us, Genesis 50. 20
having our eye still at him, and how he disposes all for our comfort in the
end: thus waiting for the happy issue, Job 13. 15.
saying with Job, Heb. 13. 5.
though he kill me I will trust in him, and ^^prooue my ways in his sight,
knowing assuredly that he cannot forsake, fail, or forget us.

5. Love of his Majesty because of his goodness, loving fervently all his
commandments, ordinances and servants with whatsoever he loves, and that for
his cause only, zealous therein to promote his honor, hating that which he
hates with a vehement indignation, as our Savior and David. Psalm. 69. 9. 17.

6. Child-like-feare] living always as in Gods presence, Psalm. 16. 8.
laboring to approve our hearts unto him, Genesis 5. 24.
thus walking with him as Enoch until he take us hence: not fearing the faces
of men, but as the three children and Nehemiah. Nehem. 6. 10. 11. 12. 13: 14.
Dan. 3. 17. 18.

7. Humility] because of his excellency and our vildnesse, his holiness and
our sinfulness, 1. Pet. 5. 5. 1. Cor. 4. 7.
so giving all the glory of all our good things to him alone, Psalm. 131. 1. 2.
as the free gifts of his rich mercy, acknowledging withal, Iam. 1. 17.
that we are not worthy the least of them, 1. Cor. 1. 26. 31.
as Jacob and Daniel, mourning withal for all the horrible sins of our time,
Dan. 9. 3. 4.
as just Lot, 2. Pet. 2. 7. 8
and the mourners in Jerusalem before the captivity. Ezech 9. 4.

Abhorring contrarily all the breaches of this commandment; as the mother
sins, of all the fearful abominations that are committed in the world.
1. Atheisme] whereby most live, as if there were no God, or heaven, Judgment
or place of torment, as those fools that say in their hearts, there is no God,
Psalm. 14. 1.

2. Ignorance] or spiritual blindness, Hos. 4. 6.
whereby multitudes perish living without Christ and without GOD in the world,
Ephesians. 2. 12.
and so go hudwincked to hell, Esa. 1. 3.
as the Gentles; worse then the Ox that knows his owner.

3. Infidelity] whereby the greatest part neither regard the word or works of
God, nor yet depend upon him, showed evidently by these signs. 1. Profaneness
of life. 2. Contempt of Gods word. 3. Impacience and fainting in trialls. 4.
Tempting God by using unlawful means in stead of waiting his leisure. 2. Kin.
6. 33 7. 2.
5. despair of his mercy. 4. Carnal confidence] trusting in vanity, even in
any thing but God, whether In 1. Wit and policy. 2. Power and strength. 3.
Wealth. 4. Friends, favor or any other means, for hereby we withdraw our
hearts from God, Ier. 17. 5.
bring a curse upon our selves making these our Gods. 5. Coldnes] or
lukewarmnesse in the love of God his truth and servants as the Laodicean, Apo.
3. 15. 16.
or decaying in our first love, as the church of Ephesus. Apo. 2. 4. 5 6.
Loving or delighting in any thing above God, his word and ordinances, or
preferring them before God and his favor, as -- 1. Parents, children, or
friend, as Elie. 2. Pleasures, as Esau. 3. Pomp and wealth of the world, as
the young man coming to Christ. Mar. 20. 21 22.
4. Our selves, whereunto Peter persuaded our Savior. Mat. 16 22.
7. Hatred of God] appearing in malice against his word, Romans 1. 30
or servants for doing his commandments, Exo. 20. 5.
as in Cain, Ahab. Deuteronomy. 7. 10. 8. Wilful disobedience] against the light of
our consciences, as in Saul, which is rebellion, and as the sin of
witchcraft. 1. Sam. 15. 22. 23. 9. Timorousnes] fearing men more then God, Apo.
21. 8.
and thereupon doing, or forbearing good or evil, for fear of men only, which
is Idolatry, making Gods of men. 10. Presumption] upon his mercy to sin
because he is merciful, Romans 2. 4. 5
as most hypocrites do, though he have said plainly he will not be
merciful unto such. Deuteronomy. 29. 19. 20. 21. 11. Pride against God] setting our
selves against his word, judgments or servants with an high hand, 1. Pet. 5. 5
as Pharao: or taking his praise to our selves as Herod, not considering our
own weakness, as Peter. Luke. 5. 8. 12. Having other Gods] whether the Pope of
Rome, as all the Papists reverence his word, and ordinances above Gods: Ro^.
10. 14.
or any of the Saints, whom they invoke, Phil. 3. 19.
or our bellies, or Mammon. Mat. 6. 24.



2. Commandment, Thou shall make thee no graven image etc.
Which commands Gods outward worship with all the parts and means thereof,
that we worship him only according to his will revealed in his word.

Here we are to examine how we walk on more conscionably.
1. In a more careful use of all the ordinary means of holiness, and parts
of Gods service, as frequenting the word preached, which is the ordinary means
to beget faith, and the principal to increase it, reading or hearing some part
of it read daily, meditation, conference, the use of good books, company of
the godly, practice of the duetyes of piety, Exo. 29. 38. 39.
omitting no opportunity nor part thereof privately nor publicly, Dan. 6. 10.
prayer duly morning and evening at least: in the most humble manner, as the
perpetual morning and evening sacrifice under the law.

2. Using the helps ordained to bind and stir up our selves hereunto, as 1.
Vows of things in our own power, Esa. 22. 12. 13.
as Jacob. 2. Fasting when God calls us thereunto, Ezr. 8. 21. 22. and 10. 6. 9.
by some judgment already upon us, or threatened, or for obtaining some
special blessing. Act. 13. 2. 1. Cor. 7. 5.


3. Striving for the maintenance of the faith, Iud. 3.
that is of Gods pure worship and truth, without any mixture of man's
inventions or of any other corruptions. 1. Tim. 6. 14.

Abhorring all breaches of this commandment.
1. Imagery of the true God and Christ, or of fained Gods, Saints or Angels
for any religious use, as Crucifixes and the like. Deu. 27. 15.

2. Every outward representation, devised by a man, to be either a part of Gods
worship or to teach some religious duty: for all such likenesses are expressly
condemned. Nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above. etc.

3. All will-worship] that is all not warranted by the word of God though done
in never so good an intent, as in Nadab and Saul, Deu. 12. 32
for Christ is the only teacher of his Church, Mat. 7. 7. 8. 9.
and sole ordainer of the means of his own worship. Luke 12. 1. 2. 1. Sam.
15. 15. Mat. 23. 10.

4. All approbation of any idolatry, superstition, or false worship 1.
Presence. 1. Th. 4. 22.

4. Silence. 1. King. 19. 18.



5. Keeping relics, Deu. 7. 25. 26.

God cannot endure. Esa. 30. 22.

5. Al occasions of insnaring our selves or others in superstition, Deu. 7. 2.
3 4. 5. 25.
as by unnecessary and unlawful traficke, or familiarity with Idolaters or
false worshippers; seeking help of, 2. Cor. 6. 14 and 18.
or favoring them. Ezra 9. 2. 14. 12. 10. 1. 11. 12.

6. Adoring Saints or Angels, as the Papists do. Acts. 20. 25. 26. Apoc. 19.
10. 22. 6.

7. Esa. 8. 19. 20.
Worshipping Satan, Apo. 21. 8.
by seeking to effect strange matters by means forbidden, or not warranted:
For Satan is very ready, when any homage is done unto him by practicing such
means, as to Saul seeking the witch when he was forsaken of God, and to
sorcerers, as we see by daily experience.

8. Hipocriticall worship] as 1. Outward ceremonies, or bare shows of
religion. Mat. 23. 23* 25.
2. Forwardness in small matters, omitting the most weighty, 1. King. 18* 21.
as the Pharisees. 3. Halting between two religions.


9. Neglecting the service of God or any part or means thereof.

3. Commandment, Thou shall not take the name of etc.]
ordayning the right manner of performing Gods worship.

Here we are to vewe how we run on more cherefully in these duties.
1. A reverent use of all the names of God, as 1. Titles, as God, Lord. Deu. 28.
58
2. Attributs, as mercy, Truth. 3. Ordinances, as word, sacraments,
ministry. Acts. 9. 15. 4. Judgments bodily. spiritual.
5. Mercies
taking occasion to consider of and set forth Gods glory shining in every one
of them, using them to the ends he has appointed.

2. Swearing religiously.] that is by the Lord alone, and in matters of
importance, for his glory and the good of our neighbor, which cannot otherwise
be ended, Ier. 4. 2.
and also with great advise, least we forswear, Heb. 6. 16.
or at least take that glorious name in vain, at which we ought to tremble,
and so performing our oaths faithfully. Psa. 15. 4.

3. In a more fruitful use of the word, sacraments and other means of our
salvation, Luk 8. 15.
that is with feeling the power of sanctification by the^ through mixing them
with faith. Heb. 4. 2.


4. Praying with feeling, Ephesians. 6. 18.
feruencye and faith, Col. 4. 2.
giving thanks also with cheerfulness.

5. Sanctifiyng al Gods benefits, ordinances and chastisements with the works
of our calling by the word and prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 5.
that so we may have a more holy use thereof.

gracing it by a holy conversation, 1. Pet. 3. 2. 14. 15.

and Abraham, who built Alters wheresoever he came, Dan. 6. 10.
even amongst the Infidels. Ier. 10. 11.

7. Performing faithfully and constantly all our holy vows. Psalm. 50. 14. 116.
14.

And contrarily mourning for and abhorring all abuses of the glorious name of
our God* as
1. Careless using any of his names in our common talk. Deuteronomy. 28. 58.

2. Swearing lightly, or profanely, for which the Lord Land
mournes, Hos. 4. 2.
and much more for forswearing, Ier. 13. 10.
as Zedekiah. 2. Chr. 36. 13.

3. Blaspheming] by speaking basely or contumeliously of any of his names to
his dishonor. Leu. 24. 11. 14. 16.

4. Cursing] for God has given us tongues to bless with, and said, bless and
curse not. James. 3. 9. 10. Romans 12. 14.

5. Abusing Gods Religion] as his word, sacraments or other ordinances (whereby
he most familiarly shows himself and all his goodness to us, and would have
us to make profession of him) which is done not only by neglecting of any of
them, Heb. 2. 3.
but

1. by using them unprofitably without reformation of life, 2. These. 2: 10. 11.
12.
and increase in holiness* Psalm. 50. 16. 17.

2. Making a profession, yet living profanely to make Gods enemies to
blaspheme. 2. Sam. 12. 14. Acts. 2. 13.

4. Dissembling any part of the truth, where we ought to profess it. Romans.

5. Unseasonable or crafty profession. Phil. 1. 15. 16.

or requiring them unkindly. 2. Sam. 12. 7. 8.
Whether Public as 1. Gospel. 2. Peace. 3. Deliverance 4. Prosperity.
Private in Soul. Body. Goods. Friends. Name.



8. Abuse of our Christian liberty though in things of their own nature
indifferent. 1 Cor. 8. 9.
Romans 14. 13. By 1. Grieuing the godly. Romans 14. 15. 20. 2. Causing the weak
Christian to stagger. Romans 14. 13. 22. 23. 1. Cor. 8. 7. 10. 11. 12. 13.
3. Nuzling the ignorant in superstition. 4. By Hardening the Idolater. 5. By
Giving occasion to the wicked to blaspheme,


9. Breach of our vows and covenants with God, as that at baptism and ever
since. Deu. 23. 21
Eccl. 5. 3, 4, 5.

4. Commandment, Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy]
inioyning the time of Gods solemn worship.

Here we are to consider well how we grow in a conscionable practice of all the
duties of the Sabbath.
I. Before the assemblies,
1. Remembering the Sabboath before it come, that we may dispatch all our own
works in the six days, Esa. 56. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7.
to attend the right sanctification thereof, according to the caveat Remember:
so to consecrate it as a glorious day unto the Lord, to honor him, not doing
our own ways, Esa. 58. 13. 14.
nor seeking our own will, nor speaking a vain word.

2. Preparing our selves thereunto, either the day before, Eccl 4. 17.
or rising early in the morning, Exodus 19. 14. 15. 22.
by examining our hearts both by the law, Leuit 10. 3.
and Gospel, and so reconciling our selves to God, 1. Cor. 11. 28 31.
renewing our vows of walking more conscionably after we have cleansed our
hands by repentance. Mat. 5. 23. 24.
Gen 35. 2. 3.

3. Making fernent prayer, Psalm. 26 6.
for 1. Forgiveness of our particular sins. Eze. 7. 10.
2. Increase of those graces we most stand in need of. 3. That the preacher
may be fitted so to speak, and we to hear, as may be most to Gods glory, and
our salvation.


2. At the assemblies.
1. Being present with the first at all public assemblies of the Church, Ezekiel.
46. 10.
with carefulnes and reverence, Psalm. 1 10. 3. 40. 8. and 95. 1. 6. 1.
as before the Lord of the whole earth, both to declare our love and homage,
Deuteronomy. 33. 3.
and for the good ensample of others; Esai. 2. 3. 49 23.
afraid of the least unseemly gesture, Acts. 20. 9. 10.
or being overtaken by sleep or drowsines.

2. Joining with the congregation in every public action, chiefly in our
hearts, as being one body of Christ, of one heart and of one soul. 1. Cor. 12.
12. Act. 2. 46. 4. 32.

3. In hearing, and applying each speech as spoken by the Lord to us
particularly, Psa. 27. 8. and 40. 8.

as members of the same body, or in danger thereof. Ez. 8. 9.
Act. 2. 37. 2. Chr. 34. 27

2. Rejoicing in all promises.

3. Thankful for the mercies.

4* Desirous of the graces.

5. Resolute to walk in every good way, Psa. 27. 8.
to depart from the evil. Exodus 24. 3.

This is the best art of memory, for exceeding joys, griefs, hatred, or
desire, do leave the deepest impression in us, and so stick longest in memory.

4. Waiting for the blessing to be put on us, by the Minister, never departing
before it be pronounced. Number. 6. 23. 27. Ezekiel. 46. 10.

3. After the Assemblies.
1. Meditating on the whole sermon in order, as 1. Text. 2. Occasion, meaning,
division. 3. Doctrines severally, by marking the text, and how they were
gathered out of it. 4. Proofs of the several doctrines. 5. Uses. 6. Applying
it better to our selves, trying what work every part had in us.

2. Conferring of the same in the same order with our families or others.

The benefit whereof is most evident by experience, both herein and in every
trade and science, for those who confer most, Mal. 3. 16.
are ever most expert: besides that hereby the godly do kindle zeal in one
another, Luke 24. 14*
and contrarily without it are made drowsy and unprofitable hearers, Mar. 4.
25.
letting Satan steal away the seed out of their hearts* Mat. 13. 19.

3. Meditation upon the creatures.

1. Generally to behold the Lord in every one of them, Romans 1. 10.
that is, his 1. wisdom 2. Power. 3. goodness. 4. providence.

Collecting. 7. Relieuing.


Avoiding as warily all the breaches of the Sabath, as

as to sayres, wakes, or whatsoever, for pleasure. profit.
Esa. 58. 13. 14.

2. All vain delights and sports, hindering godliness, immoderate feeding or
whatsoever may make us heavy or unfit for the service of God. Romans 12. 11.
Deuteronomy. 28. 47.

3. That ordinary good fellowship in tippling, vain talk void of edification,
Ephesians. 4 29.
and much more all open profanesse. Col. 4. 6.


The 2. Table commanding duties of love to our neighbor. 5. Commandment.
Honor thy father and thy mother, etc.
wherein the Lord takes order for preserving the honor and dignity which he
has bestowed upon every one.

Here we are to examine how we perform these duties.

2. Obedience belonging to the^ To. 13. 1. 7. 1. Pe. 2. 13. 14.

regard of our selves, and so without reproves. Tit. 2. 12.

4. Toward Inferiors.
1. Shining before them in a holy conversation with all gravity, according to
our place, Mat. 11. 29
as our Savior and Paul. Phil. 3. 17.

3. Afraid to wrong or despise the basest of them as Job. Job. 31. 13.

1. Earnestly seeking peace with all men, so far as is possible, as Abraham

available to gain love even from our very enemies, and do much adorn
Christianity.

Unadvised, anger Ephesians. 4. 27.
whereby we first give place to the Devil to enter into our hearts.

2 Malice or hatred, 1. Ioh. 3. 12
which is murder before God, especially Cains hatred for the good things we

2. Avoiding all those things which tend to the destroying of our souls, and
that so much more carefully, as the soul is more excellent then the body,
eternal life then this, and eternal death more fearful, as

1. To live in any one known sin, Romans 6. 23.
for the wages of the least is death eternal, Gal. 3. 12.
and will certainly destroy the soul, Psa. 34. 12. 13, 14.
if it be lived in with delight. Pro. 11. 19.
Ezekiel. 18. 11. Iam. 2. 10. Mat. 5. 19. 1. John 3. 8.

because he that wins souls is wise, Dan. 12. 3.
and shall shine as the brightness of the firmament for evermore, Iam. 4. 17.
but he that gathers not with Christ scatters, Lu. 11. 23.
and to him that knows to do well and does it not, to him it is sin.

2. Being afraid of hindering the salvation of any one, 1. Co. 8. 11.
and much more of being any cause of their damnation or fall, by 1. Giving
offense thorough our scandalous lives, Mat. 18. 6.
or evil ensample, To. 14. 15.

any way to sin, as Joseph's brethren, David in the murder of Vriah. 3.
Encouraging or praising others in their sin, Hab. ^. 15.
as the false Prophets, crying peace. 4. Consenting any way to the sin of
others, as the Beniamites, and the company of Corah. To. 1. 32. 5. Not
testifying our dislike, so far as we may conveniently, Ezekiel. 33. 7. 9.
and hindering. 6. Not punishing according to our authority, Nu. 25. 4.
but rather winking as faults, 1. Kin. 20. 42.

1. by admonishing, 2. exhorting. 3. reproving, 4. instructing by catechisings

obedience and submission to the means, as Abraham, Joshua, Hester, Nehemia,
Cornelius. Genesis 18. 19. Ios. 24. 15. Neh. 13. 15. to 22. 8. 1, 3, 8. Hest. 4.
1^. Acts 10. 2. 24. 33.

7. Commandment. Thou shall not commit adulterie]
wherein the Lord commands his people to be a chaste and a holy people.

Here we are to examine how we increase in 1. Chastity, possessing our
vessels in holiness and honor, 1. These. 4. 4. 5.
both in the single and married estate, by using carefuly these helps and
preservatives.
1. Modesty, observing Christian comeliness, Job. 31. 1.
to express the holiness of of our hearts, and that in all our words. Genesis
4. 1. Ps. 51. 10. behauour. Genesis 24. 46.


2. Temperance, Pro. 23. 29. 33.
in the sober use of our 1. diet. 2. sleep. 3. pleasures.

as they be no prouocations to the flesh, Gal. 5. 13.
nor hindrances to holiness, otherwise to abate them. 1. Cor. 9. 27.

3. That there be no nerenes of blood. Leu. 18. 4. Consent of Parents 1. Cor.
7. 38. parties. Genesis 24. 57.



2. Abhorring not only those monstrous kinds of uncleanness which ought not to
be named amongst Christians, as fornication, Ephesians. 5. 3.
adultery, incest, rape, Sodomy and the like, which the very light of nature
condemns, but more
1. All wantonness privately with others.
Ephe. 5. 3. 4.

2. Nocturnall pollutions coming of excess. Deuteronomy. 23. 10, 11 To. 13. 13.


3. Voluptuous abuse of the marriage bed, otherwise then for some of the right
ends of marriage before mentioned. Yet observing duly 1. The natural time of
separation. Leu. 18. 9.
2. Of solemn humiliation, when the bride and bridegroom are to leave the
marriage chamber. 1. Cor. 7. 5. Joel 2. 16. Ezekiel. 18. 6.
3. Shunning as warily all causes and occasions of uncleanness, as 1. Within
us, all vnpure thoughts and lusts which are the adulteries of our hearts. Mat,
5. 28. 15. 18. 2. without us all prouocations, as 1. Surfeiting and
drunkenness, Ezekiel. 16. 49.
immoderate eating and drinking; Prou. 23. 32. 33.
or of such things as most stir up lust, at unseasonable times. 2 Idleness
and sluggishnesse, as in Sodom, David. 3. Pride appearing in face, hair,
apparel, or behavior: as in the women of Judah before the captivity. Esai 3.
end. 4. Society with lascivious persons, which are infectious. Genesis 39. 10. 5.
Lewd books or ballads, fitter to be burnt, as Acts. 19. 19. 6. Filthy talk, or
foolish jesting, Mat. 12. 35. 36,
bewraying an unclean heart, and corrupting others. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Pro. 7.
11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Ephesians. 5. 3* 4. 5. 12. 7. Wanton looks, from eyes full of
adultery, as in Potiphars wife. David. 2. Pet. 2. 14. 8. Lewd houses, of evil
report. Prou. 5. 8. 9. Wanton pictures, plays, dancing or dalliance, of the
very beholding whereof, every ones conscience will tell him the danger, when it

8. Commandment. Thou shall not steale]
inioyning the preservation and increase of our own goods, or outward estate,
and also of our neighbors.

Here we are to examine, 1. How we labor to maintain our estate holily and
honestly, according to our place and calling, walking in all these duties more
cheerfully.
1. Painfulnes in our particular calling, as Jacob in Labans service, Paul both
in his ministry and to get his living; Ephesians. 4. 28. Acts 20. 31. 2. These. 3.
8. 9.
using double pains early or late to recompense the time spent in the service
of God; as in gathering Manna before the Sabbath, that they might rest that
day. Exodus 16. 22. 23.

2. Thrift] putting all things to the best, John. 6. 12. Pro. 5. 15. 16. 17.
and 21. 17. 12. 27.
looking warily that nothing be lost, as our Savior, who gave charge for
saving the crummes, though he was able by his word to provide what he would.

3. Contentation] with that estate wherein the Lord setts us, 1. Tim. 6. 8.
assured that he sees the estate to be best for us, living within our
compass, depending only upon his providence without distrustful care, and
much more without repining, or murmuring, as the Israelites in the wilderness,
being certainly persuaded, Heb. 13. 5. 6.
that he will not fail us of that which shall be best for us, in his due,
time, so using the world, as though we used it not. 1. Cor. 7. 31.

4. Living within our compass. 1. These. 4. 11. 12.

4. Peaceablenes] avoiding law and contention, Mat. 5. 5. 1. Cor. 6. 7.
using all honest means to get and hold our own with peace, if it be possible,
remembering that the meek shall inherit the earth, putting up some wrongs as
Abraham to Lot.

6. Dealing vprightly] being sincere both in word and deed, such as in whom is
no guile, as Nathanael.

2. We are to examine, whether we endeavor to employ our goods aright
according to Gods will.
1. To the promoting and maintenance of Gods religion and service, by our
selves and others, both privately and publicly, as at the building of the
tabernacle and Temple, every one brought their gifts of the best things: and
so in all the sacrifices: the women ministering to Christ, and in the Primitive
church. Acts 2. 44. 4. 32.

For this is the honor dew to God for all, Prou. 3. 9.
and the chief end of our riches; otherwise Idolaters shall condemn us, who
have been ever devout herein, Mic. 6. 67.
as the Israelites at the making of the golden calfe, the Papists at this day.

3. To the charitable relief of all in necessity, Gala. 6. 10.
as kinsfolks, Romans 12. 13.
friends, neighbors* church, country, especially the godly poor: Heb. 13. 2.
so that of them we respect our kinsfolks in the first place, if they be
such, and so others according to more special bonds. 1. Tim. 5. 4.
Thus to employ them to Hospitality; to good works, and alms, 1. Pet. 4. 9. 10.
as

Job, Job. 29. 31
who caused the backs, and bellies of the poor to bless him. 1. Kin. 18. 13.
Obadiah which fed the Prophets of the Lord with peril of his life. Acts 9.
36. 39.
Dorcas who made garments for the poor Christians. Nehemiah Neh. 5. 14. 15.
that worthy governor who took not his due, because he would not be
chargeable to the poor people, in their distress: but maintained at his own
charges sundry of those who were in need: which fact comforts him to entreat
the Lord, ^er. 17. 18. 19.
to remember him in goodness according to that* Cornelius, whom the holy Ghost
has set forth as an ensample for this, Acts 10. 2. 4.
and shows how God kept a remembrance of it. Acts 11. 29. 30.
The Christiians of Antioch, Macedonia, and Corinth sending relief to the
poor brethren in Iudaea. 2. Tim. 1. 6.
Onesiphorus to Paul in prison, not ashamed of his chain. The primitive church
generally. Acts 2. 45.

This is the feeding of Christ that shall be acknowledged before the whole
world, Mat. 25. 35 45. 46.
and the very want of it shall condemn all the world, nothing being more
neglected then it, even amonst them that make show of godliness. 2. Ti. 3. 5.

4. To the dew performance of all promises, Psa 15. 4. 37. 21.
which is a property of a blessed man, and the contrary of an unfaithful and
wicked. Pro. 25. 14.

5. To be able to lend freely, Luke 6. 35.
looking for nothing again, that is for no gain, and sometime not the
principal. Neh. 5. 10.

6. To make restitution to the utmost of whatsoever our consciences can charge
us to have been unjustly Luc. 19. 8.
gotten or detayned: Ezekiel. 18. 19.
as Zachaeus.

7. To keep justice, giving to every man his right, and judgment, Iere. 22.
3. 15.
never consenting to the wronging of any man, but saving all from wrong, so far
as we are able. Psalm. 82. 3. 4.

3. How we prevail in rooting out of our hearts that bitter root of
1. Couetousnesse] whereby we are either hindered from heavenly duties, 1. Tim.
6. 9. 10.
or from feeling the sweetness that is in godliness, or from depending upon Gods
providence: or are drawn immoderately after the love of the world, as to seek
to get by unlawful means, or to vex and disquiet our hearts with carking
cares. 1. Tim. 6. 10.


4. How we grow in our detestation of all kinds of thefts proceeding from
covetousness.
1. Thefts in the Church.
1. Simony] buying or selling the gifts of the holy Ghost, Acts 8. 18. 20.
whether Church offices, or places to exercise those offices in, or the goods
of the Church to the hindrance thereof, or to our own private gain.

2. Sacrilege] conueving to our selves, Ios. 6. 8. 19.
or detayning things dew to God, Mal. 3. 8. 9. 10.
whereby he is robbed of his honor, or the salvation of his people hindered,
as by all sorts of unconscionable ministers, and all others keeping away Church
livings, without dew regard of the peoples salvation, and Gods worship.

3. Gain by things hindering the gospel, and true piety, or furthering
superstition: as Demetrius the siluersmith. Acts. 19. 24.

2. Thefts in civil dealings.
1. Counterfeit or colored deceit by fair words, or the like, as in Amos
days. Amos. 8. 4. 5. 6.

2. False scales, waights, or measures, all which God abhors. Deuteronomy. 25. 13.
14. 15.

3. Racking the prices of things, to the oppression of the poor, or evil
ensample of others: thus did the gygyants before the flood, that the earth was
full of cruelty: Mic. 2. 1, 2, 3.
and the great men before the captivity, Ge^. 6. 4. 11.
for which God threatened to plague them with other spoylers, Esa. 5. 7. 8.
as it came to pass: This causes the poor to sigh, whom God will avenge.
Exodus 22. 23.

Deuteronomy. 15. 9. 10. 11.

4. Ingrossing] getting up all commodities to sell as men list, even the the
very refuse. This is to swallow up the poor, a sin which the Lord will
not forget. Am 8. 4, 5. 6. 7. 8.

5. Sale upon day] to the hurt of the buyer: 1. The. 4. 6.
that is, inhauncing the price, only in consideration of longer time of
payment, more then the buyers are able to make of it, which is usury or worse.

6. Becoming bankrupt, to enrich our selves by the spoils or goods of others,
which is flat cosinage and theft. 1. These. 4. 6.

3. Thefts in lending.
1. Vsury] as when men exact a gain by covenant, above the principal lent,
only in lieu and recompense of the lending, Exo. 22. 14. 15.
which is biting ordinarily, for it is very rare when one or other is not
bitten by it. Psa. 15. 5.
All usury is of this sort wherein charity is broken toward any one. Neh.
5. 7. 8 9. 10.


4. Thefts in withholding.
1. The pledge. Ezekiel. 18. 7.

2. That which has been committed to us in trust for others, as the husbandmen
the vineyard. Mat. 21. 41. Pro. 3. 28.

3. Our debt] which is a mark of an ungodly man; for the godly should owe
nothing but love, and that to every one. Psalm. 37. 21. Romans 13. 8.

4. The hirelings wages] a sin crying for vengeance. Iam. 5. 4. Ier. 22. 13.
14.

5. Things found] if we can know the owner. Leu. 6. 23. Deuteronomy. 12. 1.

6. That which we have unjustly gotten from others, and not making restitution
thereof with the better, if we be able. as Zachaeus. Phil. 4. 8.
Leu. 6. 1. ad 8. Luke 19. 8.

5. Theftes, whereby we rob our selves and those who depend upon us, disabling
us to perform the duties which we owe to them and others.
1. Vnthriftines] not regarding to save that which God has given, but wasting
without reason or regard, upon lewd companions, or vain delights, as the
prodigal son. Luke 15. 13.

2, Ephesians. 4. 28.
Living inordinately] without painfulnes in our calling; the Pismire shall
condemn such unprofitable servants. Prou. 6. 6.

3. Rash suretishippe] without regard of the circumstances, so often forbidden by
the wise Solomon. Pro. 17. 18.

6. Other ordinary thefts, in getting goods by unlawful means.
1. Removing our neighbors marks, or bounds, to enlarge our own, which is
accursed. Deu. 27, 17.

2. Uncharitable inclosure] to the hurt of the common wealth, or of any one,
without sufficient satisfaction, for which the Lord threatens a woe. Esa. 5. 8.

3. Perverting the law, or corrupting judgment, by bribes, friendship or
craft, to wring the poor, as Iezabell did Naboth for his vineyard.

4. Man-stealing] viz. stealing away or enticing children or servants, a far
worse theft then stealing any goods inasmuch as these are more precious. 1 Timothy 1. 9. 10.

5. Practice of unlawful arts] as such as have no warrant by the law of God
or nature, as magic, coniuring, playing the wiseman, for no such ought to be
found amongst Gods people, being abominable to the Lord. Deu. 18. 9. 10. 11.
12.

6. Gaming] for more then we may conveniently spend, or could be content to
give, especially at unlawful games, or unfit times, Phil. 4. 8.
or falsely. A matter of badde report, to the hurt of our selves, or our
neighbor or both, accompanied commonly with many disorders, brawles, grudges,
covetousness, oaths fraud, and the like.

7. Falsifiyng the will of the dead] a sin against the Law of nature. Gal. 3.

8. Pilfering] the least matter or cosening, 1. These. 4. 6
for God is the auenger of all such things.

9. Conspiring] or any way favoring or consenting to any such fact, he that
does this hates his own soul. Pro. 29. 24.

9. Command. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbour]
inioyning us to seek all means to maintain our own good name and our
neighbors.

1. For our own good name we are to examine how we grow.
1. Seeking a good name by living religiously, walking in all the commandments
of God without reproof, Luke 1. 6.
as Zachary and Elizabeth, Act. 10. 1
Cornelius, Act. 16. 1. 2.
Timothic a young man: Pro. 10. 7.
For the memorial of the just being as a precious ointment shall be blessed,
but the name of the wicked shall rotte. Eccl. 7. 3.

2. Keeping narrow watch against every sin continually, because every fault
is to the godly man, Eccl. 10. 1.
as the dead fly, marring the sweetest ointment, and a little leven to the
whole lump, besides the malice of Satan, and the wicked to blaze us, and
blaspheme our religion for any one fault, passing by all the good things in us,
as in David for Vriah. 2. Sam. 12. 14. Even this is a stain to the worthiest
kings of Judah, that yet the high places were not taken away.

3. Seeking in every thing Gods glory alone] and not our own more then for
him, for then he will give us glory abounda^tly, but seeking our own glory he
will turn it into shame. 1. Sa. 2. 30.

4. Careful to judge and speak the best of all other, professing godlinesse]
for God will cause others to measure so to us again. Eccl. 7. 24.
Mat. 7. 2.

5. Using but few, and wise speeches] for in many words are much vanity, Pro.
10. 19
but such speech in due time are like apples of gold, with pictures of silver.
Pro. 25. 11.

6. Striving to cheerfulness and affability in all our speeches, as our
Savior. Matthew. 11. 17. 19.

7 Indeuoring to be sincere in word and deed, abhorring dissembling; so we
shall have the commendation of Nathaniel even of the wicked, at least in their
hearts, to be right Christians in whom is no guile, Ioh. 1. 47.

2. Concerning our Christian neighbors good name, whereby God is glorified.
1. Rejoicing at it, as John for the elect Lady and her children. 2. Ioh. 1. 4.

2. Defending their credit by public or private testimony according to our
persuasion of them, as our Savior did of John and of his own disciples, they
again giving testimony to him. Mat. 11. 2. 7.

3. Gladly acknowledging all the gifts of God in them, as our Savior of the 7.
Churches, and Paul of the Christians, to whom he writ.

4. Covering their faulty so much as we may without sin, as Shem and Iaphet
their fathers nakedness, for which they are blessed, yet not approving of the
least of their sins, but seeking privately in all love the reformation of
them Ephesians. 5. 11.

5. Readily receiving every good report of them, for that is the nature of true
love, Act. 16. 3.
yet not committing our selves over hastily unto them, 1. Cor. 13. 7.
until sufficient trial, Ioh. 2. 24
as our Savior.

6. Expounding each doubtful matter in the better part, if there be any
probability thereof, as Jacob the death of Joseph and his dreams, for love
thinks not evil. 1. Cor. 13. 7.

7. Showing a dislike to whisperers and talebearers, which will drive away the
slaundering tongue. Psa. 15. 3. Pro. 25. 23.

8. Using all good means for the mainteinance of the good name of every one
professing the fear of God, by admonishing, exhorting, or directing them in
love and wisdom by our selves and others.

Abhorring these contrary vices.
1. Envy at the worthy credit of any, as the pharisyes against our Savior.

2. Evil suspicion without evident cause, as the Barbarians against Paul. Act.
28. 4.

3. Itching ears to hear our own commendations with the discredit of others,
or at least to be flattered, as Ahab by the false prophets.

4. Speeches sauouring of malice or disdain at the credit of others, as Corah
and the Pharisees.

5 Boasting] seeking our own glory, though with the disparagement of others,
as the proud Pharisie.

6. Uncharitable iudgeing of others for some slipps, infirmities, evil
reports, crosses, or some other accident, as Hely of Hanna, Jobs friends of
him, to be an hypocrite, and much more to judge so for good things, or such as
may be well taken, as the Pharisees of our Savior eating with the Publicans.

7. Aggravating small faults or slau^ders, without care to cover or amend them.

8. Reporting men's bare words or actions without their intent and meaning,
wresting or any way perverting them, as the false witnesses against our
Savior, Jews against Stephen.

9. Bearing false witnesse] or accusing falsely, as Haman against the Jews,
Amazia against Amos: as also the accusations, Amo 7. 10
against our Savior, Jeremy, Paul.

10. Lying] which is very falsehood in word or deed with purpose to deceive.
This is a principal sin of Satan, Ioh. 8. 44.
who was a lier from the beginning, and the father thereof.

11. Unjust or rash arbitrament or giving judgment, as the Elders against
Naboth.

12. Malicious accusations, not of any conscience to God, or for amendment of
the party, or good of others, but of spite, as Doeg.

13. Betraying others, or their cause, craftily under pretense of friendship
or otherwise: as the Herodians intended, and Judas dealt with our Savior.

14. Bewraying the secret or infirmity of our neighbor to his discredit,
which we might well have concealed. Mat. 18. 15.

15. Lightly believing flying tales or suspicions, Psa. 15. 3.
against our brother, as Saul against David, and the Priests, much more
spreading them, or adding to them.

16. Flattering] as Corah and his company did the people; and as Absolon or the
false Prophets crying peace, which is to lay nets for men, and to be huntsmen
for Satan.

10. Com. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house]
wherein the Lord requires our very hearts to be upright toward our neighbor.

Here we must examine our hearts how we grow.
1. In intertaining only holy thoughts, purposes and affections for the good of
all men. 1. Th. 5. 23


2. In suppressing evil thoughts and motions, Zach. 7. 10.
that we may never give any consent, Ro^. 7. 7. 20 23. 24.
nor take the least delight in the^, but labor to the utter burying of all
concupiscence, until we be perfect in the heavens.

The glass of the Gospel, or the examination of our faith, according to the
Articles of faith, which contain the sum of the Gospel. Rules.
1. THe measure of our faith is according to the measure of the power thereof in
comfort and sanctification, 1. Cor. 4. 20
issuing from every article, 2. Tim. 3. 5.
except in the time of temptation. 2. Cor. 1. 22


2. All the benefits contained in the articles of faith, 2. Cor. 1. 20
are ours, in and through Christ only, when he is ours.

3. Let us prove our selves therefore whether we are in the faith, let us
examine our selves; 2. Cor. 1 3. 5
know we not our own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in us, except we be
reprobates.

4. And if Christ be in us, Romans ^. 10.
the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life for righteousness
sake.

5. For the Kingdom of God is not in word but in power. 1. Cor. 4. 20


6. We must therefore show our faith out of our works: for as the body
without the spirit is dead, even so faith without works is dead. I am. 2. 18.
20. 26.

1. Article.
I believe in God]
1. This is my faith, that though by nature thorough Adam, I and the whole
Church are Apostates from God, Ephesians. 2. 13.
and enemies to him and his law, yet by grace thorough the second Adam Jesus
Christ, God is our God, and we his people reconciled unto him, Heb. 8. 3.
to serve him in newness of life all our days. Luke 1. 74 75.


2. This is my comfort hereof, that God is my God, and has sealed me for
himself, Ioh. 20. 28. 29.
and therefore I am most blessed, being in such a case. Psalm. 144. 15.

3. This gives me further assurance that this my faith is sound, because
together with this comfort, he has given me since I believed in his name a
heart desirous to depart from all iniquity. 2. Tim. 2. 29.

Father]
1. This is my faith, Gal. 3. 22. 26.
that though I was a child of wrath, yet by grace in Christ I am the child of
God, Ier. 4. 19.
and God my loving father.

2. This comfort I receive hereof, that I being thus his child shall lack
nothing, because my heavenly father does tender me much more, Mal. 3. 17.
then any earthly father his child. Esaias. 46. 15. 16.

3. This is my assurance, that my faith herein is sincere, Mal. 1. 6.
because together with this comfort, Mat. 12. 50.
I feel my self affectioned to reverence, Gal. 4. 5. 6.
love and obey him as my most dear father, and am enabled by his spirit to
run to him with boldness in all my wants, crying Abba, oh my father. Romans 8.
15.

Almighty]
This is my faith, that though I be weak and unable to resist my enemies
bodily or spiritual, no way able to help or provide for my self, yet my
heavenly father is of all majesty and power, Mat. 8. 2.
guiding continually men, Angels, Psa. 23. 4.
devils, and all creatures to serve for his own glory, and the good of his
children.

2. This comfort I receive hereof, that he does and will continually make all
things work together for the best unto me, Romans 8. 28.
not only the holy means appointed thereunto, 1. Cor. 3. 20 21. 22.
but also mine afflictions, Acts. 4. 28.
yea my greatest enemies, Sins and Satan himself, until I be perfected in
the Heavens. Genesis 50. 20.

3. This also does further assure me, that he thus works for me: because he
has first showed the same mighty power, quickening and raising me up from the
death of sin, Ephesians. 1. 19. 20.
which he showed in raising my Savior from the grave, and secondly for that I
have sensibly felt all things thus working together for my salvation.

Maker of heaven and earth]
1. This is my faith, that though through Adam I had lost the right, both of
heaven and earth, and of every creature, so as I could have no comfort in the
use of the^, but terror as an usurper, being cast forth off the earthly
paradise, Genesis 3. 24.
lest as an heir of the curse, yet thorough my Savior the second Adam, Romans
5. 17. 18.
since I truly believed in him, I am restored to a far better estate, Heb. 1.
2.
being made in him a right heir of all, Romans 8. 17.
never to be cast forth off my inheritance any more.

2. This comfort I receive hereof, that heaven is mine and all the joys
thereof, Ephesians. 2. 6.
and that I am set already in the heavenly places in Christ my head, who
reserues the full fruition for me. And secondly that all the creatures in
heaven and in earth be they good or bad, Job. 5. 23.
are at a league with me, 1. Cor 3. 21. 22. 23.
to help for my good, so far as may stand with his glory, my salvation and the
good of his Church. Hos. 2. 18.

3. This is also my assurance, that my faith is sincere herein, because that
together with this comfort, I both perceive all the creatures thus ready to
help me, Exodus 16. 25. 35. and 17. 6.
especially in time of trial when ordinary means fail: 2. Tim 4. 5.
and also feel a holy care wrought in me to use the creatures aright,
sanctifying them by the word and prayer, Ephesians. 2. 6.
and that my affections are set on heavenly things. Col. 3. 2.


2. Article.
And in Iesus]
1. This is my faith, Psalm. 51. 5. 1. and 39. 1^.
that though I am guilty of innumerable sins both original and actual,
even the breach of the whole law, Romans 3. 10. 11. 13. 19. 20. 21. 22.
and every part thereof, and so am worthy to be damned, and have all the
plagues of God dew to my sin cast upon me, 2. Tim. 2. 26.
yea though I was a bondslaue to sin and Satan, yet I believe that Jesus is my
Savior, Luke. 4. 18.
and has delivered me from al my sins, both the guilt, and satisfactory
punishment of them, Psalm. 1. 21.
as also from the power of sin and Satan. Job. 1. 29.
Romans 6. 12. 14.

2. This says is my comfort, and moreover that all my sins and enemies shall
not hinder my salvation. Romans 8. 39.

3. This is also for my full assurance thereof, Luke 1. 47.
because besides that I feel my soul rejoicing in God my Savior, and I
perceive my self also delivered from the tyranny of Satan, and power of
sin, even of those sins which before led me captive, Romans 6. 12.
so that no sin has any more dominion over me, Romans 7. 24. 25.
that I do serve it in the lusts thereof, and for that I am withal delivered
from the terrors of conscience for my sin.

Christ.
1. This is my faith, Dan. 9. 24.
that though I was in the kingdom of darkness and a stranger from God by my
sin, yet Christ was anointed for me with all the gifts of the spirit to be
my mediator, my King. Heb. 1. 9.
Priest. Psalm. 45. 7.
Prophet. Mat. 23. 10. Act. 3. 22. 23. Apoc. 1. 5.



2. This is my comfort, Col 1. 13. Ioh. 10. 28. 29 30.
that he being my king, has and will fully deliver me from the kingdom of
Satan, and give unto me his heavenly kingdom. Romans 3. 24. 25.
Secondly being my Priest, has first reconciled me to his father; 1. Ioh 2. 1.
by the sacrifice of himself, Heb. 7. 25 and 9. 24.
and keeps me since in favor, by his perpetual intercession. Thirdly being
my Prophet, Romans 8. 34.
will proceed to teach me all the will of his father necessary to eternal
life. Heb. 8 10. 11.


3. This is for my assurance hereof, Apo. 1. 6.
because I feel my self to have received of the anointing of every one of
these from Christ and the fruit of them. 1. Cor. 9. 27
1. of his kingdom, 1 Ioh. 3. 3.
inabling me to begin nor only to subdue my sins and evil affections, but
also to rule so sar over my self, as to bring my very thoughts and all
committed unto me into some obedience to Christ. 2. Cor. 10. 5
2. Of his Priesthood whereby I am made able to offer to the Lord my self, 1.
Pet. 2. 5
supplications, Romans 12. 1.
thanks and works of mercy, Heb. 13. 15 16.
with all that I have to serve him.

3, Of his Prophesy, Ro^. 15. 16.
making me to grow in the knowledge of himself, 2. Ioh. 2. 20. 27.
and in care to instruct others therein. Ioh. 6. 45.


His only sonne]
1. This is my faith, that he being the only son of the Father by nature,
Ga. 4. 4. 5. 6
has made me a child and heir by the grace of adoption, Ephesians. 2. 3.
who was by nature a child of wrath and perdition.

2. This comfort I find herein, Gal. 4. 7.
that to me belongs the inheritance of Gods sons. Romans 8. 17.
Gal. 47. Romans 8. 17.

3. This also is for my assurance, for that he has sent the spirit of his
son into my heart, whereby I can call him father with comfort, which is my
witness and seal. Romans. 8 16. 2. Cor 1. 22.

Our Lord]
1. This is my faith, Ga. 4. 5. 6. 7
that though I was under the Prince of darkness, 1. Pet. 1. 19.
having Satan my Lord, Ioh. 10. 29
until I believed in Christ, yet since I am Christ's and he is my only Lord By
1. Purchase with his blood. 2. Gift from his father. Ephe. 5. 32.
3. marriage co^tracted to be co^sumate at his appearing. Hos. 2. 20.



2. This is my comfort, that being thus purchased and given to him as a
peculiar gift, Ioh. 10. 28.
I shall never perish, and being thus contracted to Christ my Lord, the bond
thereof is in such faithfulness, Hos. 2. 19.
as shall never be dissolved, until I be brought into the bride-chamber, and
fully glorified.

3. This increases my assurance, for that together with this comfort, Apoc. 5.
9. 24. 4.
I feel my self redeemed from the earth: viz. my earthly conversation, and
do delight to hear the voice of my bridegroom.

3. Article.
Which was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Mary]
1. This is my faith: that though I was conceived in sin, Psalm. 51. 5.
and borne in iniquity, and so corrupted in all the parts both of my soul and
body, yet that both the conception, birth and whole nature of Christ my
Savior, Romans 8. 2. 3
was fully sanctified by being united to his Godhead, Luke 1. 35.
to be imputed unto me.

2. This is my comfort, that my God has given me this holiness of his son, 2.
Co. 5. 21.
as a robe to cover all my sinfulnes, Phil. 3. 9.
and whereby I do both presently, and shall ever stand most gloriously in Gods
sight, chiefly at the great day.

3. This is my further assurance hereof, because I can mourn for this total
corruption in me, and being humbled in the fense of it, Romans 7. 14. 15. 18.
23. 24.
am driven daily to put on Christ by faith: and for that I feel also the new
birth in me, by a change begun in all the powers both of my body and soul,
Romans 7. 22.
wrought by virtue hereof, since I was conceived and borne in the Church, by
the power of the holy Ghost.

4. Article.
Suffered under Pontius Pilate: was crucified]
1. This is my faith, Gal. 3. 13.
that besides all the evils which my Savior endured for me, in all the
course of his life, he also endured that most shameful and accursed death
which I had deserved, to satisfy his fathers instice for me, and to pacify
his wrath toward me.

2. This is my comfort hence, Gal. 3. 13.
that I am delivered from the curse of the law, he being thus accursed for
me, and that whatsoever sufferings I endure in this life, are sanctified
hereby to be to me Fatherly 1. Exercises. 2. Chastisements. 3. Trialls. 4.
Fulfilling of Christ's afflictions. 5. Means to confirm me to Christ my head,
Romans 5. 3 Heb. 12. 11 and 6, 7, 8. Apo. 3. 10. Col. 1. 24. Romans 8. 29.
6. Examples to others.


3. This also warrants the soundnes of my faith herein. Gal. 6. 14.
1. Because I feel my self to profit in Christianity by my afflictions and
crosses. Psa. 119. 67 71.
2. I desire to take pleasure in such sufferings for Christ's sake. 2 Cor. 12. 20.
3. Because the old man in me begins to be crucified with Christ, Gal, Phi.
1. 29.
2. 19. 5. 24.

Dead.]
1. This is my faith, 1. Cor. 15 55. 56. 57.
that Christ has died for my sin and by dying has over come death, and so
taken away the sting thereof, that it cannot hurt any of those that believe in
him.

2. This comfort I find hereupon, that death shall be so far off from hurting
me, Phi. 1. 23. 2. Cor. 5. 1. 2.
that it is already sanctified by this death of my Savior, to be to me the
gate of life.

3. This also increases my assurance that my faith is sound herein, because I
find together with this comfort, that every sin has received his deaths
wound in me (each beginning to dye) and for that I feel a power by Gal. 2. 19.
Christ's death, Phil. 3. 10.
to triumph against the terrors of death, Col. 3 2.
waiting for it, when I have finished my course, Phil. 1. 21. 23.
wishing to be dissolved and to be with Christ. Romans 7. 24.

And buried]
1. This is my faith, that Christ was buried for me, both to assure me of the
certainty of his death for me, and that all my sins are buried in his grave,
yea withal to bury sin in me, Romans 6. 3. 4
and to sanctify my grave to be a sweet bed for my body to rest in until
the resurrection. Esaias. 57. 2.


2. This very faith is my joy, and moreover that my sins thus buried shall
never come into remembrance to accuse or condemn me, Romans 8. 34. 35.
or to hinder Gods everlasting mercy and love from me.

3. This also furthers my assurance, for that together with this joy, I feel
many sins buried in me, Col. 2. 11. 12.
and consuming daily by the virtue of this death and burial of my Savior,
especially, Romans 7. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24.
the strength and delight I took in every sin.

He descended into hell]
1. This is my faith, that Christ suffered not only in his body the punishment
due to my body, but in his soul also the torment due to my soul, which I
should have endured for evermore, Mar. 14. 33. 34.
and that not only upon the cross, Luke 22. 44.
but also in the garden, as appears by his speeches, his pravers, Heb. 5. 7.
his cry, his agony, and bloody sweat, and so has for me triumphed over hell.

2. This is my comfort, that though I stood ever in danger of eternal death for
all my sins, yet now by my Savior I am delivered from the terrors thereof.
Heb. 2. 15.

3. This is further for my assurance hereof, Ioh. 3. 14. 15.
for that I have received comfort in this only, Number. 21. ^
even then when the pains of hell have gotten hold upon me for my sins; and
because I feel a desire to save others also from that place of torment by
leading them to this my Savior, Ioh. 3. 18. 36.
and have now entered the narrow way to heaven following my Savior therein, Mat
7. 13. 14.
having left the broad way going to destruction.

5. Article.
The third day he rose again from the dead]
1. This is my faith, that my Savior has fully satisfied the justice of his
father for my sin, even to the uttermost farthing, Romans 4. 25.
in that he rose again, because any one sin of his elect not satisfied for had
kept him in death, 1. Cor. 15. 15. 56. 57.
seeing he took upon him to become surety for them all.

2. This is my joy, that thorough him I am justified and stand as righteous in
the sight of my God, all my sins being utterly done away, Romans 4. 25.
and covered hereby.

3. This helps my assurance hereof, for that besides this comfort, Ephesians. 2. 5.
6.
I feel my self also raised up to a desire of a perfect holiness. Phil. 3.
10.
Apo. 20. 5. 6.

6. Article.
He ascended into heauen]
1. This is my faith, that when my Savior had fulfilled all things in the
earth for the redeeming of his church, he went up into heaven, Luke 24. 51
both to prepare the way, Act. 1. 9.
and also to take possession and to keep it for me. Ioh. 14. 2.

2. This is my joy, that none can hinder me from thence, Ioh. 17. 24
but where my Savior and head is, there shall I be also.

This ratifieth my assurance, for that my affections are already ascended,
being set on things that are above. Col. 3. 2.

And sits on the right hand of God the father almighty]
1. This is my faith, Mat. 28. 18
that my Savior has all power given him over all sorts, John. 17. 2
to give eternal life to whom he will, Ephesians 4. 8. 10
and condemn the rest, sittes as King at the right hand of his Father, filling
his Church with his gifts, guiding it by his word and spirit, until he have
glorified it, Esa. 54. 10 59. 21.
and subdued all his enemies, 1. Cor. 15, 24. 25.
conuincing them by the light of Nature his works, 1. creatures. 2. judgments.
3. mercies.
word.



2. This is my comfort, that he will guide me by his word and spirit
continually: Phil. 1. 6.
and overrule whatsoever Satan or the wicked can do against me, 1. Pet. 1. 5
to serve for my good, Esa. 8. 16
and against themselves.

3. This is also for my further assurance herein, because I feel my self
desirous to be guided by the direction of his holy spirit speaking in the
word: and moreover, Esa. 30. 21.
I hear a voice behind me saying; This is the way, Esa. 59. 21.
walk in it, when I turn to the right hand or to the left.

7. Article.
From thence he shall come, to judge the quick and the dead.]
1. This is my faith, Ioh. 5. 22.
that my Savior shall come to be the judge of the whole world, To. 14. 10.
to judge every one according to their works. 2. Cor. 5. 10


2. This is my joy, that though I did, and do naturally quake, so often as I
hear or think of the terrible judgment, Act. 24. 26
yet remembering the judge, 2. These. 1. 10.
who has by himself satisfied for all my sins, so taking them on himself,
and given me his own absolute righteousness, I can cry; Come Lord lesus, Apo.
22. 20
come quickly, since he shall come to me a most happy Savior, and not an
angry judge.

3. This is also for the accomplishme^t of my assurance, 2. Cor. 5. 9. 20. 11.
that this my faith is sincere, because besides this comfort, I labor always
to have a clear conscience, that I may have boldness at that day, and can
persuade men, knowing The terror of the Lord.

8. Article.
I believe in the holy Ghost]
1. This is my faith, that the holy Ghost is God, 1. Cor. 12. 12. 13.
the third person in Trinity, sanctinfier and preserver of his Church, Ephesians. 4.
15, 16. and 4. 4.
knitting the whole church to Christ the head thereof, and every member one to
another.

2. This is my comfort, that he will perfect in me this good work of
sa^ctification until the appearing of Jesus Christ, Phil. 1. 6.
having already so knit me to Christ my head, as I can never be separated.

3. This assures my heart, because I have already received the first fruits of
this blessed Spirit, Romans 8. 23. 26.
whereby I am enabled to sigh, waiting for the perfect adoption, and to pray
with groans, striving against that corruption in me therefore it is to me as
the seal and earnest of my inheritance against the day of glory. 2. Cor. 1. 22.

9. Article.
The holy catholic Church.]
1. This is my faith, that God has always a chosen flock, Esa. 59. 21
not only of those who triumph already in the heavens, Ro^. 11. 3. 4.
but even militant here in the earth, Mat. 28. 19
universally scattered, Mar. 16. 15.
all which he has ordained to eternal life, Ioh. 4. 21. 22. 23.
by his son Jesus Christ, to whom all his promises appertain, Mat. 28. 29.
and 10. 14.
having these principal marks, Luke 10. 16
a cheerful submission to the word and sacraments outwardly, Act. 2. 42. 46.
and holy affections inwardly according to the same, Mat. 7. 23.
proceeding from this holy faith: though the number of them have been very
small in the most flourishing ages of the church, and those ordinarily of the
baser sort, 1. Cor. 1. 26 27.
and shall scant be found when Christ shall come. Luk 18. 8.


2. This is my comfort, that GOD has vonchsafed me to be one of that little
flock. Luc. 12. 32.

3. This assures me further hereof, because I feel in my self a hungring
after the word and Sacraments, Ioh. 6. 27. and 10. 27.
as my spiritual nourishment, and can willingly submit my self to be guided
by the same word, for the perfecting this work of grace begun in me.

The communion of Saints.]
2. This is my faith, Romans 8. 15. 16. 28. 30.
that this whole Church has a communion or fellowship together in Christ and al
his benefits, Ephesians. 4. 4. 5.
and so in every article of this faith, 1. Cor. 1. 9.
as in the same Savior, 1. John 1. 3.
Father, 2. Pet. 1. 2.
preserver and sanctifier: Phil. 2. 2.
and also amongst themselves, 1. Pet. 1. 10.
being affected alike both inwardly in love, Act. 2. 44. 45. 46. and 4. 32.
hatred, joy, grief, that is, to love the same things, and for the same: and
outwardly in relieuing, helping, and caring for one another.

2. This rejoices my soul, that the Lord has vouchsafed me to be of this
blessed communion.

3. This further assures me hereof, because together with this comfort, I am
so affected to all the true servants of God, 1. Cor. 12. 26.
thus soundly professing the Gospel, To. 12. 15.
that I can pray heartily for them, Mat. 12. 49. 50.
mourn and rejoice with them, and for them, as for my brethren and sisters,
and bereadie to help them in whatsoever, esteeming of them as members of
Christ with me, and can claim the word as my portion and heritage for ever.
Psalm, 119. 111.

10. Article.
The forgiveness of sinnes]
1. This is my faith, Heb. 8. 10. 11. 12.
that all this whole church and every member thereof, Apo. 7. 14.
have all their sins forgiven for Christ, being all washed in his blood.

2. This comfort I find hereof, that howsoever I am a miserable sinner many
ways, yet none of all my sins shall ever be imputed unto me, being of this
holy Communion. Romans 8. 33.

3. This is also for my assurance, Zac. 12. 10
because I can often mourn bitterly, Mat. 5. 11.
when I look at my Savior, Romans 7. 20.
whom by my sins I have crucified, Mat. 6. 14. and 5. 44. 45
and do abhor them as none of mine, but fruits of that sin that still dwells
in me in part, and moreover because I can forgive and pray even for my very
enemies, and have set my self to wage continual war against every sin.

11. Article.
The resurrection of the body].
1. This is my faith, that all bodies shall rise again at the last day, Ioh.
5. 29.
when Christ comes, the bodies of all the faithful to eternal joy by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, though all the rest to condemnation.

2. This is my comfort, that this my body now subject to diverse infirmities,
Job. 19. 25. 26. 27.
as sickness, manifold pains and sorrows, Phil. 3. 21.
etc. shall then arise a glorious body like the shining body of Jesus Christ,
Apo. 7. 16. 17. and 14. 13
free from any more misery, pain, or labor, all tears being wipt away from
mine eyes.

3. This is also my further assurance hereof, because I feel in my self the
first resurrection, by a daily rising in my inner man, to newness of life.
Apoc. 20. 6.

12. Article.
The life euerlasting]
1. This is my faith; that in steed of this transitory life, so full of
labors and griefs, God has provided for all this holy church a most happy and
blessed life, which shall continue for evermore. Apo. 21. 22. and 22. 1. 2. 3.
4. 5.

2. This joy I find herein, that though my life be full of crosses and
troubles, every day subject to a thousand temptations, and very momentanye,
Romans 8. 18.
yet then it shall be a most glorious life, 2. Cor. 4. 17 and 12. 4
when I shall dwell in Paradise in the presence of God, Psa. 16. 11.
and all his blessed Saints and Angels for evermore. 1. Th. 4. 17
1. These. 1. 9. 10.

3. This finally confirms my assurance hereof, because I feel the life of
grace begun in me already, Gal. 2. 20.
which is the beginning of this eternal life (but that then it shall be far
more holy and glorious, Romans 14. 17.
and every way more blessed then the heart of man can conceive,) and moreover
for that he has given me this grace to believe in the son: John 3. 18. 36.
5. 24. 25.
I therefore know by the testimony of my Savior, that I have eternal life; 1.
Ioh. 5. 11 12.
and withal he has given me a heart to hear his voice with delight, John 10.
27. 28.
so that I shall never perish: yea my faith herein is such, that I account all
things but loss and dung, in respect of Christ Jesus my Savior, Phil. 3. 9.
and all the troubles of this life, Romans 8. 18.
not worthy the glory, Phil. 3. 13. 14.
that shall be then revealed unto me, and so strive hard forward toward this
mark, laboring always to keep a good conscience, both toward God and man;
Luke 20. 35
that I may ever be prepared for the full fruitio^ hereof, and counted worthy to
enter through the gates into the City. Apoc. 22. 14.

This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. 1. Ioh. 5. 4.

Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
Apoc. 2. 10.

Here is the patience of Saints, here are they which keep the commandments of
God, and the faith of Jesus. Apoc. 14. 12.

I have sworn and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments
always. Psalm. 119. 160.

Then shall I not be confounded, when I have respect to all thy commandments.
Psalm. 119. 6.

Lord increase my faith. Luke. 17. 5. Mar. 9. 24.

The benefits of this practice of examination to encourage us unto it, since it
is wearisome and unpleasant to flesh and blood.
1. Performing it aright, we shall avoid al hardness of heart, luke
warmness, Ps. 119. 6. 80. 101. 104.
sleeping in any sin, and prevent an evil conscience, with many other
punishments of sin, Lam. 3. 39. 40.
and withal we shall be able to recover our selves forth with, out of every
gross sin, and from Satan's power, yea even from the gulf of deepest
despair. Psalm. 32. 4. 5.

2. We shall daily be putting off the old man, and putting on the new: strippe
us off the rags of our sins, and put on our wedding garment, Ephesians. 4. 21.
22. 23. 24.
to make us still more glorious in the eyes of our bridegroom: yea we shall
cast away the works of darkness and put upon us the armor of light. Romans
13. 12.


3. Being thus armed, we shall be so enabled to watch continually, Ephesians. 6. 11.
22. 13. 14. 15. etc.
and defend ourselves against Satan, Mat. 4. 11.
and all his power, that he shall never give us any deadly wounds, Iam. 4. 7.
but we shall put him to flight, Ro^. 16. 20.
and in time trample him utterly under our feet.

4. We shall be able to see the good way and wherein the perfection of a
Christian consists, Pro. 2. 9.
with his true glory and felicity in this life, Psa. 1. 1. 2
and to rejoice in them that are such: 1. Ioh. 1. 1 2. 4.
and withal to behold the fearful state of the world, Ps. 119. 136
to mourn for it with just Lot: 2 Pet. 2. 7. 8
so to judge aright between the godly and the wicked, Luke 19. 41. 42.
and specially to judge for our own estate. Phi. 1. 9. 10


5. We shall be fitted in some measure according to our place and calling as
we are Christians, to teach, convince, admonish, reprove, exhort and comfort
both our selves and others.

6. We shall be enabled to pray for our selves and others, Romans 15. 14.
with the whole Church of God, 1. These. 5. 11. 24.
according to our several necessities, Ioh. 15. 7. 1
and after the will of God in faith, 1. Ioh. 5. 14 ^^ 3. 22.
and withal to make a most sound confession of our sins general or
particular, with feeling, and so most seweet thanksgiving for all mercies,
with a like comfortable profession of our faith.

7. We shall so grow in Christ, and repair his image, as by beholding and
observing our selves, 2. Pet. 1. 10. 11.
we shall get most strong consolation, 1. The. 1. 3. 4. 5.
that we are true branches of that holy vine, lively members of Christ's body,
John. 15. 1. 2. 7. 8.
the very sheep of his fold, to stand at his right hand, and hence most
certain assurance of eternal life sealed unto us by his holy Spirit, 1. Tim.
4. 8.
having in the mean time all the promises of this life, 1. Cor. 3. 21. 22. 23.
and that to come, all being ours and for us.

8. Seeing our growth in grace, perceiving what sins we have overcome, Romans
5. 10.
and what graces we have obtained, Gal 3. 3.
we shall be encouraged to strive forward to perfection, Heb. 10. 32. 33.
until we obtain the end of our strife, 2. Tim. 4. 7. 8.
the crown of glory. Apoc. 2. 9. 10.

9. We shall shine as stars in the world, Phil. 2. 15.
to the greater glory of our god. the comfort and good ensample of Gods
servants, 1. Pet. 2. 12. 15.
the conversion of the wicked, or stopping their mouths, and leaving them more
without excuse.

10. We shall increase the brightness of our glory in heaven, Dan. 12. 3.
as we have more glorified God in the earth: Rom 2. 6. 7
for the practice of this examination in the course of our life, Mat. 19. 28.
29.
is a spiritual sowing, 2. Cor. 9. 6.
whereof we shall in due time reap a plentiful harvest, if we fail not.
Gal. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.

11. We shall be sure to get and keep a good conscience, whereof such peace,
boldness, security, and heavenly joy will follow in us, Pro. 15. 15.
as passes all understanding, Romans 5. 3. 2. 3.
and no carnal man can possibly feel, Phil. 4. 7.
but only those for whom the kingdom is prepared, 2. Cor. 1. 12
because it is the beginning of it in this world. To. 14. 17.


12. Briefly, which is the sum of all, we shall get this assurance that Jesus
Christ is our Savior anointed for us, our King. Priest. Prophet.
having made us also Kings and priests, Apo. 1. 6.
to our God for evermore. 1. Pet. 2. 9.


Some necessary questions appertayning hereunto.
1. Of senselessness in sin.
Quest. Can any man living without feeling of his sin, and misery by it, or
of his spiritual poverty, have any sound hope of his salvation by Christ?

Ans. No. Christ is a physician only to them that are sick, Luke 4. 18.
a deliverer to them who feel themselves in prison, Esa. 61. 1.
calls them only that travel, Mat. 11. 29 30.
and are ready to faint under the burden of their sins.

Of obstinacy in sin.
Q. Can any who continue stubbornely in any one sin, not submitting
themselves to be ruled by the word of Christ and his ministers, in all things,
hope for eternal life by Christ, or the favor of God?

A. No, Mat. 16. 24. 25.
they that come to Christ must follow him forsaking themselves, Luke 9. 23.
taking up their cross daily, Mat. 11. 30
and learn of him to bear his yoke: Act. 3. 22. 23.
if ever they will find rest unto their fowls, Luke 10. 16
they must hear his voice, or else they shall be destroyed from among his
people. For they that despise Christ's messengers, refusing to hear them,
despise him: and all that boast of faith, Ia^. 2. 17. 18
must show their faith by their works, to be a living faith, else it shall no
more profit them then the faith of the devils, yea all must follow holiness
without which no man shall ever see God with comfort. Heb. 12. 14.

3. To whom sound comfort belongs.
Q. Can any but they who indeauor to walk with GOD in holiness all their
days, have any comfort that they shall be heard in their distress, or can
they pray?

A. No, for the justice of God will not admit it: for he that turns away
his care from hearing the law, Pro. 28. 9.
his prayer is abominable, and what marvel is it, if God call to us, and we
will not hear to obey him, Prou. 1. 24. 25. 28. 29.
though he hear not us, Psalm. 66. 18
when we call and cry to him. Therefore we must hold the prophets rule for
certain. John 9. 31.
That if we but incline unto wickedness in our hearts, Esaias. 1. 15.
God will not hear us. Esa. 66. 2. 3.


Experiment general.
Try whether we can find any sound comfort in our prayers, that God will
hear us in the day of our affliction or any time of need, or that any one of
the promises of GOD belong to us, or so much as believe any article of faith
with comfort, until we have soundly repented of all our sins, our known
sins particularly, unknown generally, with a full resolution to know the
Lord, and fear him, walking in all his commandments for ever.

4. Quest. Of the causes of backsliding.
Quest. Since sin has such fearful effects, and men void of feeling of
their sin, are in so dangerous a case, how come a number, who have had some
good feeling, to such coldness in religion, hardness of heart and
senselessnesse in sin, as to make no conscience almost of any sin?

Ans. 1. By neglecting the means of the preservation of grace, as of ordinary
hearing, reading of the Scriptures and other good books prayer, Mar. 4. 24. 25.
meditation, Heb. 10. 24 25. 38. 39.
conference, examination, fasting, and the like, or doing these things for a
fashion only, without reverence, or at least not waiting, for the fruit of
them.

2. By committing some gross sin, or living in some known sin without
repentance, Mat. 25. 29
as David, or for not glorifiyng god according to our knowledge of him, Romans 1.
21 22. 24. 16. 28.
in practicing all holy duetyes which he requires, or at least, not receuing
the love of the truth. 2. These. 2 10. 11. 12.

3. By overmuch greediness in seeking earthly things, whether our pleasures,
profits, Mat. 13. 23 44. 45 46
ease or credit, which steal away our hearts and choke grace; Luke 8. 14
or seeking the^ more then Gods glory and his favor, Mat. 6. 33. (...). 37. 38.
with the things concern his kingdom, Mat. 6. 24.
or with the neglect hereof, 1. Ioh. 2. 15
and of the salvation of our brethren. For our love cannot be in the highest
degree, to two contrary masters: but as it increases toward one it
decreaseth toward the other. neither will our jealous God part our love with
the world, for either he will be loved with all the heart, Iam. 4. 4.
and with all the soul, Mat. 22. 37
and above all earthly things, Luke 14. 26
or not at all.

4. By familiarity with the enemies of Gods religion, Psa. 26. 45 and 16. 3. 4
and 25. 4.
or men notoriously profane, Pro. 22. 24. 25.
or lukewarm professors for it is the just judgment of God to lead us into
temptation hereby, Deuteronomy. 7. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
so giving us up for these sins.

Some special preservatives against every sin.
1. That we be resolute to choose rather to endure any misery, then to sin
against God. as Joseph, Dan. 1. 8.
Daniel, and the three children.

2. That we consider the haynousnesse of the least sin, that it is against
Gods infinite majesty, and Christ's blood, deserving the eternal curse of God;
and more by the fearful punishment of the sin of the angels, Number. 29. 12.
of Adam, Moses, Vzzah, Saul, and chiefly, Deuteronomy. 3. 26.
that upon the son of God himself, 2. Sam. 6. 6. 7.
so to accustom our selves to subdue the very least sins.

3. That we warily resist the first motions to any sin, 1. Chro. 13. 10.
and be careful avoid every occasion thereof, 1. The. 5. 22.
as we do of infectious diseases. Genesis 39. 10. Pro. 5. 8. and 6. 25. 27. 28.


4. That we live always as in Gods presence who may take us away on a
sudden, Genesis 17. 1.
remembering also our appearance before him. Job. 32. 22.
Acts. 24. 15. 16.

5. That we keep continually a fresh remembrance of Gods great goodness, 2.
Cor. 5. 10. 11.
especially his chiefest mercies bodily, Psalm. 203. 2. 3. 4. 5. etc. 116. 12.
and 16. 3.
and spiritual, ordinary, and extraordinary, Genesis 39. 9.
to say always as Joseph, Psa. 91. 11.
how can I do this, and sin against my good God? Neh. 6. 11. 13.

6. That we be walking ever painfully in our special calling with God. Deuteronomy.
32. 15.


7. That we keep withal a perpetual memory of the former misery of sin,
and blessings of righteousness.

8. That above all we use seruent prayer upon all occasions to be kept by
these preservatives. 1. These. 5. 17. Ephesians. 6. 18.

Means to keep always a tender conscience.
1. This practice of considering our ways. Psalm. 119. 59.

2. Careful using all the means of grace, 2. Tim. 1. 6.
neglecting no one.

3. Avoiding presumptions, Psalm. 29. 13.
or gross sins.

4. Companying familiarly only with the godly, avoiding the contrary so far,
Psalm. 15. 4. and. 16. 3. and 119. 63.
as is possible.

5. Watching against worldly cares, that they steal not away our hearts. Mat.
6. 24. and 13. 22. Luk 21. 34.

This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek thy face,
this is Jacob. Psa. 24. 6.

The way of the righteous shines as the light that shines more and more unto
the perfect day. Pro. 4. 18. 19.

The loving kindness of the Lord endures for ever and ever upon them that
fear him, and his righteousness upon childrens children. Unto them that keep
his covenant, and think upon his commandments, to do them. Psalm. 103. 17.
18.

FINIS.
