Now she that I. Louyd trewly. Beryth a full fair face
Has chosen her. A new lover. God send her evil grace
Sith she is gone. Remedy none. There is that I can sey
wherefore I sing. A way morning. All thought and care a wey
I woyd her. In good manner. Great love till her I had
This fair woman. She letyd tha^. As though she had be glade
But at the last. She pleyd a cast. And grauntyd un to me
In wynd and wedder. To were a fether. Hit will no better be
At your meti^ge. And last partynge. She gave me a proud skorne
And saeyd that I. was a semely. Person to were an horn
wherefore I sey. In ernyst and play. To match with such a make
A thousaund fold. yet rather I would. The devil had her take
I have her lost. For all my cost. yet for all that I trow
I have perchance. A fair ryddau^ce. And am quyt of a shrew
I sey no more. I can no more. The moon is at the full
That all his life. Has a shrewde wife. He has a crow to pull
Iusticia Regat.
