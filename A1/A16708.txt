SAINT AVSTINES RELIGION.

COLLECTED FROM HIS own writings, and from the confessio^s of the learned
Protestants:

Whereby is sufficiently proved and made known, the like answearable doctrine
of the other more ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church.

TO THE MOS HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE, JAMES by the grace of God, King of great
Britain, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith; my most gracious and
dread Sovereign.
THe much observed and no less commended care, wherewith your highness
endeauoreth to enrich your Princely understanding, not forbearing so much as at
the time of your bodily repast, to have for the then like feeding of your
intellectual part your highness table surrounded with the attendance and
conference of your grave and learned divines (in which respect you may not
unaptly be termed in the very words of Eunapius, a living liberary, and
walking study) adds a more then ordinary luster of ornament to your royal
estate, and encorageth my otherwise fearful and humble thoughts, more bouldly
to approach and salute your highness with this saying of S. Lib. 8. indict. 3.
ep. 37. Innocentio. prope sin.
Gregory, Si delicioso copitis pabulo saginari beati Augustini opuscula legite:
And although the viandes hereby thus prepared may, in reguard of the Cooks
plain or rather unskillful workmanship in confection, seem unworthy of your
royal presence; for so much yet as they be of them selue^ sovereign Antidotes
whereby to repel the dispersed contagio^ of dangerous infection, and are now
placed on the table before your highness by the attendance and service of men to
your Majesty not ungrateful or suspected, even the learned Protestants them
selves, from whose frequent abounding confession the many hereafter ensuing
particulars of S. Austines professed religion are collected; I am not without
hope that your highness will in such respect vouchsaife to esteem them as not
unworthy either of your own taist, or the view and further trial of your
attending learned divines.

And pardon great Saueraigne your meanest (yet well meaning) subject, but to put
your Majesty in remembrance, that seeing our knowledge in this life is but in

part, even by a 1. Cor. 13.12.
glass in a dark sort, and that the Sciptures a lone are prescribed by your
learned divines for the satisfying and quieting of our knowledge in all doubts
of religion whatsoever; that your Majesty would plese to take notice that the
said sacred Scriptures are not able to afford us so much as certain and
infallible proof and knowledge of them selves; for as the titles of the said
books can be no certain proof of their divine authority, considering that
many writings of like title were forged under the Sea Eusebius hist. l. 3. c.

what books we are to esteem holy, which point is confessed impossible for the

it is not the word of God which does, or possibly can assure us that we do well
to think it is his word. From whence it is that yet to this present,
Protestants so importantly differ in the very Canon of the Scriptures, for it

the Epistle of S. James, the second and third of S. John, the latter of S.
Peter, the Epistle of S. Judas, and the Apocalips of S. John: with whom agrees

unable to afford us but so much as certain proof of them selves, then in all
true consequence of reason much less are they able to direct and exempt us in
case of al doubt or question infallibly from error.

And the rather cosidering that in such case (as D. Conference c. 2. diuis. 2.
p. 68.
Raynoldes confesses) It is not the show but the sense of the words (of
Scripture) that must decide controversies; and that touching this questionable
sense, the Scripture howsoever infaliible and sufficient in it self which none
denies, yet it is not (which is the only point now pertinent and
questionable) infallibly sufficient as to us in her instruction thereof, as not
resolving and instructing us therein infallibly, because not immediately of it

contrary notwithstanding, and like further observation that the chief question

of the said Scripture, for what avails it us to be made certain of the
books, and left incertaine of the sense. What reason can our adversaries
allegde whereby to acknowledge the Churches privilege in the one and deny it
(where it is no less needful) in the other?

It cannot therefore I hope (in these times of so great doubt and question)
seem either unfitting or unsafe, that for our own more certain instruction
in the doctrine of the Primitive Church, (which both parties acknowledge for
the true Church) we should make humble recourse unto the received and renowned
writings of S. Austin (a principal member of the said church) who living so
long before these our times, and being in such respect indifferent to our late
since vprisen controversies, is by our learned adversaries professedly
reverenced, as the undoubted See hereafter c. 1. h. etc.
best witness since the Apostles times of Apostolic doctrine.

Neither can the persuasion which is oftentimes settled and grown strong in us
by education, afford any infallible certanty to your greatest Majesty, or your
learned divines, whereby to secure your selves from error, as might be made
plain (without al further needful discourse) by example, not only of sundry

the current and countenance of the state, our judgments (no less then theirs)
in like sort might have been preoccupated and transported with the same
errors; so their example affords us just forwarning, not to rest secure upon
the appearing probability of any such like settled persuasion whatsoever.

upon a second consideration for false, what he once held for undoubted and most

Al which (or any part thereof) I would not be mistaken to apply or intend in
any sense or sort further, then only as thereby in all humble manner to move
your Majesty unto a second and more serious consideration, upon occasion of the
now thus propounded and confessed ensuing particulars of S. Austines professed
religion: wherein if according to that liberty of sincere and plain speaking,
which (as in this case) is no less then appertaining (or rather prescribed) to
a man of my function, I have forborne as unworthy, that adulterate placency or
Sophistication of insinuating or temporizing speech, which is not the least
infelicity that usually attends upon greatness, and in steed thereof
(according to the Psalm. 119.4^.
Prophets directing me for to speak of Gods testimonies even before kings,
and not be ashamed) have with more candor of mind ingenuously (and yet I hope
not offensiuely) signified to your highness, that not vndoubtful possibility of
erring, from which not Kingly majesty exempteth humane condition, I am not
vnconfident, that in the equity of your Princely judgment, you will as in my
excuse vouchsaife to approve this worthy saying of S. Amhrose to the noble
Emperor Theodosius, Ambros. ep. 17. ad Theodos. prope initium.
neque Imperiale est libertatem dicendi negare, neque sacerdotale quod sentit
non dicere etc. nihil in sacerdote tam periculosum apud Deum, tam turpe apud
homines, quam quod sentit non libere denunciare. The zeal of Gods truth, and
my devoted best affections to your highness, as to my gracious and dread
soueraige liege Lord, (whose ever honored memory with me remaneth in such
respect as almost charely enfoulded within the purest find on of my loyal
heart) have required at my hands the performance of this duty. The which with
most humble and suppliant desire of your majesty's pardon, (which haith
enlarged it self to become sanctuary to a greater offender) I do al prostrate,
presume hereby to offer up as sacred to your highness name, with my daily
continued prayer unto God, the author of al truth, to direct and preserve your
royal heart and understanding in the ways of his truth.

Your humble servant. JOHN BRERELEY.

The authors preface to his learned adversaries.
THough not from any great hope to persuade, where the whole frame of our
religion appears as al declining, or rather prostrate under the burden of
disgrace, nor as confident in my own particular, whereby to oppose my self
against so great a multitude of doctors, yet if for no other accasion, but that
posterity may know we have (according to the measure of our knowledge) not
been wanting in our better offices toward our dearest country, from which
not perils, at home, or exile abroad can ever estrange our Christian
affections; as also to make full supply in liew of my own confessed vnablnes in
that behalf, I have (as no less then zealous of the one, and al conscious to
my self of the other) undertaken to offer unto your grave considerations, a
brief survey of the many collected particulars of S. Austines professed
religion, a father whose never dying memory is by your See hereafter, c. 1. h.
selves yet hitherto not unworthily celebrated.

In which course howsoever I have not made strange to communicate with the
commendable labors of our other learned writers, with whom I am joined in one
communion of faith, I have yet nevertheless performed it with such addition
and further alteration of manner and method, as I may perhaps be thought to
have written, though not noua, yet noue, as having accomplished the same (to
use S. Austines Tom. 3. de Trinitate. l. r. c. 3. ante med.
words) diuerso stilo non diuersa fide: for besides the nouelty of this
argument in our language, and my particular cyting (not from others
collections, but from mine own eyes perusing the originals at large) of the
certain tome of The edition of S. Austines works usually followed in this
treatise, is that which is in folio. printed Lugduni. An. 1586.
S. Austines works, the book, the chapter, and very part of the chapter
(where it is capable of partition) in which S. Austines alleged sayings are
extant, to be found; I have yet further added a general See hereafter c. 19.
prevention to such other his more obscure sayings as are by our adversaries
vulgarly objected; and have also in more full and evident explication of his
religion yet further explained the same from the like answearable consenting
doctrine of the other ancient Fathers that lived next See hereafter, c. 20.
sect. 13.
before his age, in See hereafter, c. 20.
his age, and See herafter. c. 2. sec. 13.
after his age, from al whom it is incredible that he should dissent, him self
saying of the Fathers, Tom. 7. l. 1. contra Julian. Pelag. c. 5. prope fin. and
see c. 7. ante med. and l. 2. versus finem.
what they believe I believe, what they hold I hold, what they teach I teach
what they preach I preach etc. And lastly I have made most of all this
(concerning both S. Austine and the foresaid other Fathers) evident, not from
my own private enforcing or applying of their produced sayings, but from the
frequent abounding confession of our learned and understanding adversaries them
selves, of whom I must yet say (as did Tom. 7. ad Donatistas post. collationem.
c. 34. fin.
S. Austine in like case of the Donatistes) we must rather for this thank God
then them, for that in our behalf they should publish and lay open al those
things either by word or reading, it was the truth that enforced them, not
charity that invited them.

Now as concerning your alleged writers whom I thus produce, as confessing for
us and against both you and them selves, they are not unlearned, vulgar, or of
mean esteem, but men eminent and of chief rank in your Churches, as namely
and chiefly for foreign authors, the Century writers of Magdeburge, Luther,
Suinglius, Calvin, Beza, Bucer, Bullinger, Melancthon, Musculus, Zanchius,
Peter Martyr etc. And for domesticke writers, Jewel, Humfrey, Whitguift,
Bilson, Whitaker, Willet, Fulke, Perkins, Brightman, Carthwright, etc. Now of
what account haith ever been the argument thus taken from the learned
adversaries confessing against them selves, is in it self most clear, and
haith been by See Protest. Apol. p. 671. And D. Morton in his Apeale, ep.
dedic.
others largely confirmed from Protestant writers; wherefore against the
hereafter ensuing further force thereof, you can have no other remedy then (as
did Theodoret. hist. Tripart. l. 6. c. 17.
Julian the Apostata in the like case) to forbid and bar us Catholics for the
time to come from the reading of your Protestant authors; for me to have
alleged the particular sayings of S. Austin, and the other ancient fathers
without improbable urging the advantage resulting from the words and
circumstance of the place, would have been, though perhaps not over difficult,
yet to some tedious, and still subject to question and reply; whereas to allege
them in the very same confessed sense, wherein they are by your own learned
brethren understood, and for such thereupon by them selves rejected, as making
directly against both you and them, is that which as to the point of S.
Austines now controuerted religion gives end to al question or further doubt
thereof, and enableth me your humble adversary bouldly to provoke your grauer
judgments unto the consideration of this treatise following.

Now as touching S. Austines writings alleged in this ensuing treatise most
of them are undoubted, known, and confessed, as being specially named and
cyted by S. Austin him self in his confessed books of Retractations: And as
for those other few alleged books, that are by some affirmed not to be S.
Austines, as namely the books entitled, Hipognosticon, de Ecclesiasticis
dogmatibus, de visitatione infirmorum, Quaestiones veteris et noui Testamenti,
de verbis Apostoli, de vera et falsa paenitensia etc. Besides that these are by
In iustitut. printed, 1602. in the Alphaberical table under the word
Augustinus, most of these books are ranked and alleged as in the Catalogue of
S. Austines own books.
Calvin, and the Cent. 5. c. 10. col. 1127. 1128. 1129.
Centuristes, acknowledged to be S. Austines proper works, and are the
undoubted writings, if not of S. Austine, at the least yet of some other
ancient Fathers that lived in, or near his time, they be also in this
treatise purposly forbonre as being but very seldom or sparingly alleged or
if at al alleged, yet commonly not without some other saying annexed thereto,
taken from S. Austines own undoubted writings, or from some other ancient
Father of his age.

But yet to speak somewhat in proof of these books, and first concerning
Hipognosticon, the same being professedly written contra Pelagianos, et
Celestianos, against whom likewise S. Austin wrote, argues the book to be
written by him, or some other father of those times: In which respect M. In
Problem. p. 29.
Perkins seuereth it from the spuria scripta Augustini, and places it under
the other title of Dubij tractatus. And it is yet further alleged almost 500.
years since by Peter Lib. 4. did. 21.
Lambard, under S. Austines name; and is by D. Defense of the reformed
Catholic, p. 91.
Abbot, for such acknowledged and urged.

Concerning the book de Ecclesiasticis dogmatibus, it is cyted 800. years
since, under the name of Genadius (who lived in S. Austines age) by Walfridus
De rebus Eccles. c. 20.
Strabo, by Lib. 1. de corp. et sang. Dom. c. 22.
Algerus, and by In Symacho. fin.
Platina.

Concerning the book, de visitatione infirmorum, it is likewise by M. In
Problem. p. 30.
Perkins severed from the spuria scripta Augustini, and by him placed under the
title of Tractatus dubij, being so reputed the work of some ancient Father.

As touching Quaestiones veteris et noui Testamenti, it is alleged under
Austines name, almost 500. years since, by Cause. 32. quaest. 2. parag. Moses
tradidit.
Gratian and Peter Lib. 4. did. 31. 32.
Lombard; In so much as M. 2. part of his answer, p. 19. 4.
Hutton professes to think the author of this book somewhat auncienter then
Austin.

And as for the book de vera et falsa paenitentia, it is alleged under S.
Austines name almost 500. years since freque^tly by Lib. 4. did. 15. 17. 19.
20.
Peter Lombard, and for such acknowledged and urged by D. 2. part. of his
defense. p. 289.
Abbot.

Lastly as concerning the book de verbis Apostols, it is alleged under S.
Austines name by Peter Lib. 2. did. 30. l. 4. did. 21.
Lombard, and about 900. years since by S. Bed^, (as appears next before the
beginning of every several sermon of that book, according to the edition of S.
Austines works printed Lugduni. 1586.) and is for such alleged and
acknowledged by Vbi supra. p. 192. 252. 296. 399.
M. Abbot: whom I the rather here allege, for that of all the Protestant
writers yet come to my hands, he shows him self most conversant and
frequent in the reading and alleging of S. Austin. As likewise I do the rather
here allege Gratian, and Peter Lombard, for that the Protestant writer In
Method. aliquot locorum etc. fol. 12.
Simon Pauli, making a Catologue of the Doctors and restorers of the heavenly
doctrine, therein ranketh Gratian, and Peter Lombard, together with Husse,
Luther, and Melancthon, and so also does Method. theol. in pref. p. 1. 2.
Hiperius.

But to return to the learned adversaries; this careful preparation being by
me thus made, I can but here request leave to admonish you with the Apostle,
lac. 2. 1,
not ^o hold the faith of Christ in the acceptance of persons, reguard not I
pray you who it is that writes, but what is written, and howsoever you think
of me as perhaps (and not iniustly) but weak and despicable in the presence of
your own very learned judgments, for bear not yet I pray you, your due
respect unto S. Austin him self, and to so great a troop of your own learned
writers, who in reguard of their so many alleged sayings digested into this
brief treatise, are the primarie authors, and my self but as it were the
collectour or reporter thereof.

And let me also request further leave without offense to premonish, that in
answer hereto you would not (as some of you whom I spare to name have
heretofore done in answer to other treatises) seek to euade, or to obscure
the matter thus evidently proved, either by prolixity of discourse (as thereby
to seduce or divert the unwary reader from the point properly issuable, which
in case of supposed truth might with shorter terms receive direct and full
answer upon your confessing, denying, or distinguishing) or by passing over
with silence without al answer thereto such proofs as are of greatest
importance, for howsoever this kind of omission may be houlden excusable by the
precepts of Rhetoric, yet is it in divinity gross and unworthy; or
otherwise by usual tergiuersation of obiecting (in steed of answering)
certain old objected and often answered obscurer sayings of S. Austin, See
hereafter. c. 19.
(hereafter purposly in part prevented) or other of the Fathers, wherein their
contrary meaning is evident and for such by learned Protestants them selves See

confessed: or else by digressing into allegation of certain schoolmen
dissenting sometimes from the more common received doctrine concerning not the
conclusions of faith, but the manner of some such conclusion, or some other
like point not then by the Church determined. Which how little it forces, is by
S. Austin him self in sundry Tom. 7. contra Julian. Pelag. l. 1. c. 6. post

them afterward Ibidem.

whatsoever, howsoever countinanced with variety of reading, or other
probability and ornament of discourse, (as heretofore it haith been, and in
such elaborate sort as I have seldom known, so il a tale so well told) yet
what was it then as to the Fathers by us objected, and by our adversaries
confessed judgments in the conclusions of faith? Or what can it be now as to
the point of S. Austines controuerted religion, and so many of your learned
brethren confessing thereof against both you and them selves? If any shall
undertake to publish such further answer of this kind, as I nothing doubt but
that the studious Reader thus premonished will of him self be able easily to
discern the same to be no other then wast of time and paper, so I for my part
in steed of reply thereto (which in case of more direct and full desired
answer would not be wanting) shall rather choose to spend part of my good
hours in earnest prayer for the party which shall so abuse his better leisure,

THE AVTHOR BEGINS HIS BOOK TO HIS Catholic 'friend. CHAPTER. 1.
GOod Sir, whereas at the time of our last conference had (during our small
abode together at the Spawe for both our healthes) concerning the misbegotten
controversies of this age; you signified to me how grateful to al men (in this
so great crowd and throng of writing) were little portable treatises, and how
much the dilicacy of our times was in dislike with greater volumes, as al
weryed or rather offended with prolixity of discourse; In which respect you
moved me to undertake (as my health whould permit) some such short labor as
might become grateful, thereupon propounding for matter fitting to be hanled
the doctrine of S. Austin concerning the many now controuerted points of
religion, whereof you willed me to collect and set down for every one some
little: And albe^t that your thus directing me to such enjoined breuity (which
in case of the adversaries answeares thereto, lies commonly open to the
inconvenience of great disadvantage) be contrary to that form of larger
discourse which Tom. 2. ep. 23. Bonifacio. post. med.
S. Austin observed from Nebriclius for necessary, who affirmed that in a great
question he hated a short answer; the more yet that I have sithence
considered of your motion, the more with all did I (as condescending to the
necessity of the times) incline (so briefly as the matter will permit, and
without al affected curiosity of words) to undertake in satisfaction thereof,
this ensuing labor, as receiving (I must confess) no small encoragement
thereto both from ancient writers and Doctors, and our modern Protestant
adversaries them selves, al of the^ approving and much commending S. Austin and
his Ep. to S. Aug. extant in Austines works Tom. 2. ep. 25. prope initium.
doctrine.

S. Hierome says to S. Austin, I have always reverenced thy sainctity with
that honor which is fitting, and I have loved our Lord and Savior dwelling in
thee etc. increase in virtue, thou art famous in the world, Catholics do
worship thee as the builder again of the ancient faith etc. S. Extant in S.
Austin. Tom. 2. ep. 31. paulo post initium.
Paulinus Bishop of Nola, in his like Epistle to S. Austin terms him, the
salt of the earth, and the light worthily placed upon the candlestick of the
Church. Ep. ad quosda^ Galliarum Epis. extant, Tom. 1. Con. cil.
Caelestinus says, we have always accounted Austin a man of holy memory, for
his life and merits of our Communion etc. whom we have long sicne remembered to
have been of so great knowledge, that by our predicessors he was always
esteemed amongst the best Masters. Prosper Lib. 3. de vita contemp. cap. 31.
describes S. Austin to be sharp of wit etc. painful in Ecclesiastical
labors, clear in daily diputations etc. Catholic in his exposition of our
faith etc. yea he slyleth him Ep. de gratia et de lib. arb. ad Ruffinum.
The chief portion of the Preistes of our Lord of that time. And the like
deserved prases are largely given to S. Austin, by In his epistle extant, Aug.

Vand. Cas. in prologo super Psalterium.
Seuerus Sulpitius, Possidonius, Hilarious, Victor, Cassiodorus, and sundry
others.

But the splendor of his deserts is so shyning, as that even the learned
Protestants rest in greatest admiration thereof: So D. Tom. 7. Wittenberg. fol.
405.
Luther affirms that, since the Apostles times the Church never had a better
Dactor then S. Austin. And, Loc. com. clas. 4. page 45.
after the sacred Scriptures there is no doctor in the Church who is to be
compared to Austin. Doctor Answer to John Burges. page 3.
Couel affirms, that he was A man far beyond all that eu^^ were before him, or
shall in likelihood follow after him, both for divine and humane learning, those
being excepted that were inspired. With whom agrees Doctor Of the Church l. 3.
fol. 170.
Field tearming Austin the greatest of all the Fathers, and worthiest divine the
Church of God ever had since the Apostles times. which so high commendation
made of him, is not the only private judgment of these few, for an other

Protestant writer acknowledges that Austin of all the Fathers is houlden most
pure in the opinion of al. And M. Monas Tessagraphica etc. in pro^m. p. 3.
Forrester styleth him. That monarch of the Fathers S. Austin.

But not only S. Austin personally, but even the age wherein he lived for
sainctity and learning ha^th been ever and very specially houlden for most
renowned. So D. In his letter to Sir Fraucis Knowles extant in the treatise
entitled, informations from Scotland, p. 80.
Raynoldes affirms that The time of S. Austin was the most storishing time
that ever happened since the Apostles days, either for learning or zeal. Yea
says M. His trial of the Romish Clergy. p. 293.
Wootton, The Church in S. Austines time by the blessing of God was so
enlarged, that it had the possession of many parts of the world: And that, in
comparison of it the Arian heresy was but in corners. Calvin Institut. l. 3. c.
3. sec. 10.
him self hereupon yet further acknowledging, that Austin only is sufficient
to show, the judgment of the ancient Church. In so much as M. His Retentiue,
p. 85.
Fulke forbeareth not to bear the world in hand, that (to use his words) the
Popish Church is but an heretical assembly departed from the universal Church
long since Augustines departure out of this life. whereto D. Answer to F.
Campion in English, in the contents, fol. a. 2. parag. 28.
Whitaker adds that, Austin was wholly on the Protestants side.

Now as it cannot upon these premises be denied concerning S. Austines religion
ingeneral, but that (even in our adversaries judgment) it undoubtedly was the
same religion which the Apostles pubiished and delivered to posterity, so can I
not but join with you in resting hopeful, that if I can be able though but
briefly yet truly to make it appear, that the particulars of S. Austines
doctrine touching the several points at this day in controversy were consonant
and agreeable with our now professed Catholic religion, this then will fall out
to be a matter unto our adversaries very persuading, and to al indifferent
readers no less then conuincing, that our said religion is the very same for
truth and substance with that undoubted Primitive faith, which the Apostles
them selves first taught, and delivered afterward by their successors to S.
Austin. And for so much as S. Austin living so many ages before our times, and
as then ignorant of our late since vprysing and daily increasing controversies,
could not foresee to leave behind him direct and pnuctual resolution to every
of our now occurring particular doubts, or further to entreat of them, then
as was casually ministered to him by the accidental occasions of those times;
the due observation hereof does premonish the indifferent reader, (as discerning
the suns great brightness though shyning to him but through a slender creuise)
how to esteem of that little (in comparison) which shall so appear unto him
upon examination taken in this kind from S. Austines dispersed writings; which
animaduersion thereof, but once for all hereby thus remembered, I will now
(briefly according to your desire) proceed to the several here next ensuing
points of controversy not in such exact order of method (I must confess) as a
curious reader may perhaps exspect, but so as the condition of my present
estate (wanting both health and leisure to renew and set in better frame this
my cursory and indigested labor) can permit.

Concerning God, the humanity Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the holy
Angels. CHAPTER. 2.
S. Austin teaches that the Son of God, is God of God, and not of him self.
SECTION. 1.
PRotestants Whitaker contra Camp. rat. ^. p. 121.
teach that Howsoever the Fathers of the Nicene Council affirmed Christ to be
God of God, Calvin nevertheless affirms, that we are firmly to believe, that
Christ is God of him self. And Calvin Ep. 2. ad polonos, extant in tract.
theol. p. 706.
affirms this prayer, holy Trinity one God have mercy on us, to displease
him, and to savor of barbarism; so Contra Bellar. part. 1. c. 19. p. 121.
Daneus affirms that, Calvin truly thought and writ this phrase, God of God,
to be improper, and to savor of barbarism. In like sort auocheth M. Synopsis.
p. 610.
Willet of Christ that, As the son of God, he is of him self, neither takes
he his essence but person only of his Father. The same doctrine is also taught
by sundry other Snecanus in method. de script. p. 107.
Protestant writers.

But contrary to all this S. Austin agreeably with the Nicene Council, and our
now Catholic Church teaches that Tom. 9. in John. Tract. 48. paul. ante med.
the son is God of God etc. And that, the Father by generation gave to the
son that he should be God. And again Ibidem. tract. 106. paulo post med.
of whom ( to wit the father) he haith to be (son) from him he haith power.
Also, Tom. 6. contra sermon. Arianorum. c. 34. See this book mentioned Tom. 1.
l. 2. Retract. c. 52.
so God the Father and the son, God of God, at once are etc. for so he
received life from the Father.

Now this faith of S. Austin is so undoubtedly true, that with him there in
agree sundry Protestant doctors. Zanchius De tribus Elohim. part. 1. l. 5. p.
322. and in epistolis. l. 1. p. 206.
says, The very essence of God is in Christ etc. But from whence haith he it?
from him self or from another? If thou say simply from him self, then he is
not begotten of the Father, for what is the son begotten of the Father, but
God of God, light of light, true God of true God, as the Fathers in the Nicene
Council have defyned out of the word of God? etc. Therefore from the Father he
haith his essence, and what he is etc. He is begotten of the Fathers substance.
And with Zanchius do agree herein Loc. com. p. 25. Tig. diu. in consensus

Melancthon, the Tigurin divines Pezelius D. Abbot, and sundry other Protestant
writers.

S. Austin teaches, that God does not reprobate any to sin or damnation, or
command any thing impossible. SECTION. 2.
Calvin Institut. l. 3. c. 23. parag. 6.
teaches that God by his council and appointment does so ordain, that amongst
men some be borne destined to certain death from their mothers womb, who by
their perdition may glorify his name. Beza Display etc. p. 17. 31. 76. 116. 202.
affirms that, God decrees to destruction, creates to perdition, and
predestinateth to his hatred and destruction: God exciteth the wicked will of
one theife to kill an other etc. This slaughter springs from God justly
enforcing the will of the thief. Suinglius Tom. 1. de prouidentia Dei. fol.
365. 366.
expressly terms God, The author, mouer, and causer of man's sin, and he
exemplifyeth in adultery, and murder: and the like is taught by sundry other
Luther in Assert. art. 36. Bucer, in Enar rat. in ep. ad Romans in c. 1. page 94.
Brentius m Amos. in c. 3.
Protestant writers.

But the contrary to this with our Roman Church teaches S. Tom. 7. de pec.
mer. et remis. c. 18. post initium*
Austin that it is wickedness to say, that the evil will of man is to be referred
to God as the author thereof. And again, Tom. 3. de spir. et lit. c. 31. post
med.
otherwise is the author of sin, which God forbid. And according to this he
further avouches Tom. 7. l. 6. hypognost. c. 2. ante med.
that God only foreseeth and not pred^stinateth evil (or sin) but he
foreseeth and predestinateth good things; and he denounces of the damned that
Ibidem. fine.
God does therefore punish them, because he foresaw what they would be, but he
made them not, or predestined to be punished, but only, as I have said, he
foresaw them in Massa damnabili, in a state of damnation; of this he gives
instance in Judas saying, Ibidem. c. 5. post. med.
God foresaw but caused not the sins of Judas, as I have said before etc. he
was only foreseen not predestined. And he concludes that Ibidem. c. 6.
paulo post initium.
the rule of this disputation is to be houlden most firm etc. That sinners in
their sins are only foreseen, not predestined. This doctrine is so
clearly S. Austines, that the Prot. Polanus confesses that Symphonia. p. 185.
Austin, Tom. 7. ad decimum artic. sibi falso imposit. says, It is an
abominable opinion which believes God to be the author of any evil will, or
evil action: the same Austin ad 13. Artic. says, If any man fall from justice
and godliness, it is through his own will etc. Nothing there the Father, nothing
the son, nothing the holy Ghost, neither in such business does any thing of
Gods will happen, by whose help we know many to have been stayed from falling,
but none forced to fall. And our adversaries in their translation of his book.
de ciuit. Dei. l. 5. c. 9. p. 209. do allege S. Austin to say, God is not the
geuer of al wills, for wicked wills are not of him etc. And the like is
acknowledged of S. Austin by Decades in english, dec. 3. sermon. 10. p. 494.
Bullinger, Loc. com. part. 1. fol. 161. 162. 167. 169. 172. 182.

Popish practices. p. 237. Knoxe in his answer against the adversaries of Gods
predes^ination. p. 116. 123.
doctors do teach that Gods foreknowlege is the cause of things, so as we
cannot leave undone the sins which God foreseeth, S. Austin teaches directly
to the contrary that Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 5. c. 10. post med.
we are no ways compelled, houlding Gods foreknowledge to take away the
freedom of will etc. for neither does man therefore sin because God foresaw
him to be a sinner etc. If he will not, he sins not, and if he will sin, God
haith also foreseen this. This is Page 211. 212.
confessed, and accordingly translated in our adversaries own english
translation de ciuit. Dei. where they further relate S. Austin to say, It Ibid.
p. 209.
does not follow that nothing should be left free to our will, because God
knows the certain and set order of al events. But S. Austin is so full
herein, that the Protestant Symphonia. c. 2. page 114.
Polanus alleges several sayings from him and S. Hierome, to this purpose.

In like sort whereas Calvin and his followers, as M. Willet relates, Comment.
upon the Romans, in c. 9. p. 443.
affirm that, God by his absolute will haith reprobate and rejected some
without respect unto there sins: The same M. Willet confesses to the contrary
that, Ibid. p. 438.
Austin refers reprobation unto the foresight of original sin, and
considers man in massa corrupta. A point so plain in S. Austin against
Calvin, Beza, and the rest, that Beza In respons. ad acta. colloq. Montisbel.
part. 2. p. 164.
confesses it, and therefore reprehendeth S. Austin. Again where Calvin and
others do refer the induration or hardening of Instit. l. 1. c. 18. parag. 2.
Bucet. in ep. ad Romans in c. 9. p. 394. 397.
Pharos heart, to the actual working of God, S. Austin is so direct therein
against Calvin, that Instit. l. 2. c. 4. sect. 3.
Calvin confesses saying the ancient Fathers were sometimes over religiously
fearful to confess the truth in this matter etc. Not Austin (him self) was
free sometimes from that superstition, as where he says, that induration and
excaecation pertain not to the working of God, but to his foreknowledge.

Lastly where M. His meditation upon the 122. Psalm. p. 91.
Willet and other Caluinistes do generally teach that Gods commandments are
to us impossible, S. Austin avouches to the contrary that, Tom. 10. de temp.
ser. 61. ante med.
God who is just can not command any thing impossible, nor he that is holy will
damn man for that which he cannot eschew. Yea, we accurse ( says Tom. 10. de
temp. sermon. 191. prope fin.
he) the blasphemy of them who affirm any thing impossible to be commanded by
God. And the very same saying of S. In explanat, Simbol. ad Damasum.
Hierome is confessed and reprehended by Tom. 2. Wittenberg. fol. 216. Hamel.

1. ep. p. 290.

l. 1. ep. p. 290.
S. Austin teaches that Christ suffered not according to his divine nature; nor
according to the same was Priest, or offered sacrifice, or was mediator: and
that from his nativity he was free from ignorance, and; after his death
descended into hell: and that his body by Gods omnipotency may be without
circumscription. SECTION. 3.
SVinglius, Tom. 2. in resp. ad confess. Lutheri. fol. 458. Hosp. hist. sacram.
part. 2. fol. 57. et 76.
and Hospinian, do confess of Luther, and In epist. theol. ep. 60. p. 185.
Beza, of Musculus, and Islebius, that they al of them teach that, Christ
suffered according to his divine nature: But S. Austin condemns this
blasphemous opinion for heresy saying, Tom. 6. de Haeresi. ad quod vult Deum.
Haer. 73. initio. And see Tom. 3. deagone Christiano. c. 23. et tom. 2. ep.
102. ad Euoditum et tom. ^0. de tempo. ^^. sermon. 191.
there is an heresy that says Christ's diuinty to have suffered when his flesh
was fastened upon the Cross.

M. Jewel, and M. Fulke, with others houlding that, Fulks retentiue p. 89. and
his confut. of the Papists quarrels, p. 64. 65. And against the Rhem. Test. in
Heb. 5. v. 6. sec. 4. fol. 399.
Christ according to his divinity, was his Fathers Priest, and offered
sacrifice. S. Austin opposes him self to the contrary teaching that Tom. 8.
in Psalm. 109. v. 4. multo post med.
according to that he is God, he is not a Priest, but a Priest for his flesh
assumpted; In so much as he withal further teaches against our adversaries, as
the Centuristes say of him, Cent. 5. col. 496. et Aug. Tom. 1. l. 10. confess.
c. 43. prope initium.
Austin seems to attribute to Christ the office of mediator only according
to his humane nature, for so he says, in as much as he is man he is mediator,
but in as much as he is the word, he is not mediator, because he is equal to
God* and the like Tom. 2. ep. 59. ad Paulinum. circa med. Tom 3. l. 1. de
Trinit. c. 7. ante med. Tom. 6. l. 16. cont. Faust. c. 15. et tom. 9. in John.
tract. 82. prope fin.
sayings are frequent in him in sundry other places.

In like manner whereas Protestants Willet in Synopfis. p. 599. et 600.
teach that Christ was not from his nativity free from ignorance, but received
daily increase of knowledge by education. D. Sutliue hereupon urging that
Examination of Kellisons Survey. p. 55.
If Christ as man by the union (with the Godhead) be omniscient, why is he not
also omnipotent and present in all places? S. Austin to the contrary says Tom.
7. l. 2. de pec. mer. et remis. c. 29.
which ignorance I can by no means believe to have been in that Infant in
which the word is made flesh etc. neither can I imagine that infirmity of the
mind to have been in Christ a child which we see to be in Children etc. A
saying so pregnat that Resp. ad Bellar. ad 2. controuers. c. 1. p. 145. and
sec. p. 249.
Danaeus answearing thereto confesses that, Austin. l. 2. c. 29. de pec. mer.
et remis. denies Christ to have taken childrens infirmities and ignorance:
which to be false (with leave of so great a man) I have showed before, says
he. But yet with S. Austin agrees S. Lib. 8. ep. 42.
Gregory, who condemns this opinion as nouel in the Heretics who were
thereupon termed Agnoitae. And with both S. Austin, and S. Gregory, agree also
Lib. 10. demonst. Euang. c. vlt.
Eusebius, S. Lib. 5. de fide, c, 8.
Ambrose, and S. (p) Hierome.

Concerning Christ's descending into hell after his death, In c. 11. Isaiae.

Willet, D. Fulke, M. In his book, that Christ descended not into hell.

Christ was Tom. 2. ep. 57. ad Dardanum. solut. 1. quaest. post. init.
in hell according to his soul, but in the grave according to his flesh. And
further demands Tom. 2. epist. 99. ad Euodium. post init. and tom. 10. sermon.
137. de tempore.
who but an infidel will deny Christ to have been in hell. To which purpose and
sense he is so understood and alleged by D. Survey of Christ's sufferings. p.
626. 598. 599. Aretius, loc. com. p. 53.
Bilson and other Protestant writers.

Concerning the possibility of our Saviors body to be without circumscriptio^,
Protestants in their translations of his books l. 22. c. 8. p. 888.
de ciuitate Dei, ( directly against the Caluinistes Fulke against the Rhemish
Test. in Joan. 20. 19. sec. 2.
opinion) do allege S. Austin as reproving those that will not believe that
Jesus Christ was borne without interruption of the virginal parts, nor passed
into his Apostles when the doares were shut. Of which last point him self
affirms that Tom. 2. ep. 3. ad volus. paulo ante med.
Christ brought his body through the doares that were shut: Saying further also
hereof, If reason here be expected, it were not miraculous, if example, it were
not si^gular. In so much that whereas Iouinian then objected this scruple of our
B. Ladies virginity (as our adversaries do now object the scruple of like
incircumscription in the sacrament) to be against the truth of his humane and
natural body, S. Austin for him self and us, answeareth and confuteth Iouinian
herein, saying, Tom. 7. contra Iul. Pelag. l. 1. c. 2. post med.
This also did Iouinian in the name and sin of the Manichees, denying the
virginity of holy Mary, which was while she conceived, to have remained when
she brought forth, as though we believed with the Manichees Christ to be a
fantasy, if we affirmed him to be borne, his mothers virginity not corrupted,
but etc. The Catholics have despised this sharpest argument which Iouinian
produced, and they neither believe holy Mary by bringing forth to have been
corrupted, nor our Lord to have been a phantasy, but that she remained a virgin
after the birth, and of her notwithstanding the true body of Christ to have
been borne. And that Iouinians denial of our Ladies virginity consisted in this
very point, it is confessed by De Haeresibus. c. 82. fol. 233. and see the
Centurists. cent. 4. c. 5. col. 381.
Danaeus. yea this doctrine is so clearly S. Austines, that the Protestant
Rungius acknowledges the same in these words, In disput. 11. ex ep. ad Cor.
2. fol. 83. and These. 30.
as Austin concerning the entrance of Christ through the doares shut, with
reverence said, let us grant that God can do some thing, which we confess we
cannot find out; Let weight and manner cease for a time etc.

S. Austin teaches that the blessed Virgin Mary was freed from original sin;
that her body was assumpted into heaven: And that she vowed chastity. He also
teaches the different degrees of Angels and Archangels. SECTION. 4.

Centuristes, under their title of the Doctors errors, do confess and allege

thus, as touching original sin for as much as concerns Mary, Austin
writes, excepting the holy Virgin Mary, of whom in honor of our Lord when we
treat of sins, I will have no question at al etc. This therefore Virgin Mary
excepted etc.

Protestants acknowledge. Yea there is extant in S. Hieromes works a notable
sermon, De festo assumptionis Mariae, written by him, or as others think, by
Sophronius his equal. Further mention also hereof is to be seen in S. Gregory,
in Antiphonario et Sacramentario, and in Andreas Cretensis ( ancient to S.
Gregory) in his special oration of this feast, extant in Surius: In so much as
the Protestant Dresserus reproves even S. Damasus saying, De festis diebus. p.
148.
Damasus ordained the feast of the Ascension of Mary in the year of Christ
364. for an ungodly use, that therein honor might be given unto her, and
prayers offered etc. Therefore this feast is deservedly rejected, says this
Protestant* with whom agrees M. Perkins in like sort rejecting Missale

And De tradit. Apost. part. 1. l. 5. col. 434.
Hamelmannus alleges further testimonies hereof from Nicephorus, Dionisius,

Austin, it is confessed by many Protestant Fulke against Rhem. Test. in 2.

S. Austin likewise taught that the B. Virgin vowed perpetual chastity, for
thus he writes Tom. 6. de sancta virginitate. c. 4. prope initium.
How says she shall this be done, hecause I know not man, which truly she would
not have said, if she had not before vowed her self a virgin to God etc.
Verily she would not have asked how a woman should hring forth a son promised
unto her, if she had married to have lain with a man. This is so clearly S.
Austines religion, that D. Fulke confessing the same, charge S. Austin with a
non sequitur, saying, Against Rhem. Test. in Luke. c. 1. v. 34. sec. 13.
although S. Austin gather she vowed virginity, yet it follows not etc. And
Chemnitius (to use his own words) attributes Examen. part. 3. p. 39. And sec.
p. 56.
to Austin this fained vow of Mary, which directly (says he) impugneth the
Scriptures. Yea says Peter De Eucharist. et votis. col. 1609.
Martyr, Austin in his book of holy virginity believes that B. Mary vowed
virginity etc. which (says this heretic) al easily know how absurd it is.

No inferior shall (in heaven) envy his superior, even as now the other Angels

Thrones, Dominations, Principalities etc. Saying further, how they differ
amongst them selves etc. In the next life we shall see face to face.

Concerning the sacred Scriptures. CHAPTER. 3.
S. Austin teaches the sacred Sciptures to be discerned for such by the
authority of the Church. SECTION. 1.
Whereas Protestants ordinarily teach that the sacred Scriptures are
infallibly discerned by us from al Apocriphal writings either by the
Scriptures them selves, or the private spirit, S. Austin agreeably with the now
Roman Church, refers our certain knowledge thereof to the authority and
determination of the Church of Christ, saying, Tom. 6. contra ep. fundamenti.
c. 5. ante med.
I would not believe the Gospel, unless the authority of the Catholic Church
moved me thereto etc. If thou houldest me to the Gospel, I may hold my self to
them by whose commandment I believed the Gospel, and these commanding I will
not credit thee etc. The Authority of Catholics weakened, I can not then
believe the Gospel etc. It is necessary that I believe the Acts of the
Apostles, if I believe the Gospel, because Catholic authority does commend a
like both Scriptures unto me. And though sundry In whitakers duplicatio
aduersus Stapletonum. l. 2. c. 8. p. 387.
Protestants labor to euade this, by affirming that S. Austin spoke of the
time past when he was a Manichee, and not as then being Catholic: all the
words cyted do clearly contest the contrary, and accordingly are understood
by the Protestant Centuriae tres. cent. 2. q. 3. p. 267.
Bachmannus in this very sense which we now urge. And Suinglius having recyted
this former saying of S. Austin, in steed of better answer, is not ashamed
to give this undeserved censure, saying, Tom. 1. fol. 135.
here I entreat your indifferent iudgement^ that you freely speak, whether
this saying of Austin may not be thaught more audacious then meet, or to have
been uttered imprudently.

S. Austin teaches the books of Tobie, Judith, Hester, Machabees etc. to be
divine and canonical Scriptures. SECTION. 2.
Saint Austin professedly dissented from the Canon of the Hebrews saying,
Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 18. c. 36. fine.
not the Jews but the Church houldeth the books of Machabees for Canonical;
which saying is so plain, that the Protest. In his defense englished, art. 5.
p. 151.
Pierre du Moulin, affirms these words of the Church houlding the^ for
Canonical to be an added falsification, alleging yet not any proof or
testimony thereof, whereas al copies are consenting against him: In so much as
our P. 725.
adversaries english translation of this book not daring to deny these words,
does of fraudulent purpose, and to make them less apparent, only omit this
other parcel, (quos non Iudaei sed) because that this but appearing, it argues
the said books to be Canonical in the same sense wherein they were by the
Jews rejected, and therefore properly Canonical. But concerning all the books
now in question S. Austin comprehends them at once with the other undoubted
Scriptures under one and the same word Canonical, saying, Tom. 3. de doctrina
Christiana. l. 2. c. 8. ante med.
The whole Canon of the Scriptures is contained in these books following, and
then next immediately numbering them up, he places in rank with Genesis, Exodus
etc. the other now controuerted of Tobie, Judith, Hester etc. which Protestants
generally reject for Apocriphal. And whereas S. Austin was present and Council.
Carthag. 3. fine
subscribed to the Carthage Council, in the same it was universally decreed.
Council. Carthag. 3. can. 47.
That besides the Canonical Scriptures nothing should be read in the Church
under the name of divine Scriptures, now the Canonical Scriptures are Genesis
Exodus etc. wherewith it in order reckneth the other books now in question,
most evidently so placing and ranking them under the foresaid title of
Canonicas Scripturas, and of such as are to be read in the Church, sub nomine
diuinarum Scripturarum.

And though M. Moulins obiecteth that S. Austin says, His defense, p. 152. and
see Aug. tom. 7. contra Epist. Gaudentii. l. 1. c. 31. circa med.
The book of Machabees is received not unprofitably of the Church, if men read
it soberly, yet M. Moulin in the same place gives the answer him self,
which in substance is, that S. Austin said this as in respect of Razes killing
himself: whose example the Donatistes of indifferent zeal followed, in
reguard whereof S. Austin requires this sobriety. And he further explaineth
this (which M. Moulin omitteth) saying, Ibidem. and tom. 2. ep. 61. post med.
The Scripture of the Machabees touching Raze his death haith told how it was
done, but not commended it as though it were to be done: Even as the book of
Cap. 16.30.
Judges reports the like of Sampson, whom yet the Hebr. c. 11.32. And see
Aug. de ciuit. Dei l. 1. c. 21.
Apostle commends.

Again to that other often answered cauil of our adversaries, that the
foresaid Council of Carthage here mencioneth, five books of Salamon, whereas
we have but three; I do once more in answer thereto explain, that the Council
under those five books of Salamon, comprehends also the other two books of
Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, both which as S. Austin further explaineth, De
doctrina Christiana. l. 2. c. 8. circa med.
were said to be Salamons, in reguard of a certain resemblance of style.

But the truth hereof is so clearly defended by the Carthage Council, and S.
Austin, that our adversary Mathaeus Tract. tripart. theol. p. 46.
Hoe, confesses and reproves the Carthage Council in these words, The
Council of Carthage haith decreed for Canonical all the books of the old
Testament, excepting the third and fourth of Esdras, and the third of Machabees
etc. I ad that the Council of Carthage ought not to have Canonized more books,
because it had not authority etc. To which the French Prot. Poliander, adds
saying, In his refutation. p. 44.
To come now to the error of some Councels, the Councels of Carthage, and
Florence, have enrouled for Canonical books, and as divinely inspired etc. The
books of Tobie, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and the Machabees etc. And
the Popes Innocentius, and Gelasius have reckned these books among the
Canonical etc. And to be breife, S. Austin is so clearly ours in this
waightiest point concerning the number of the sacred scriptures, that he with
the foresaid Council is therefore sharply reprehended by Hist. sacram. part. 1.

S. Austin teaches that one text of Scripture may have diverse true senses.
SECTION. 3.
DIrectly contrary to Confut. of Purgat. p. 151. Willet in his sinopsis. p. 26.
D. Fulke, and D. Willet, S, Austin teaches with us, that one text of
Scripture may have diverse true senses, saying, Tom. 1. l. 12. confess. c. 31.
initio.
when one says this meant the Scripture which I do, another says, yea that
which I do, I think I speak more religiously in saying, why not both, if
both, be true, and if a third and fourth etc. why not al? which in diverse
other places he so often repeateth and confirms that sundry The divines of
Geneua in their propositions and principles etc. c. 52. p. 149. Zanchius de
Scriptura. p. 422. 424. 425. Aretius. loc. com. loc. 59. p 187. 177. The author
of Catholic Traditions p. 86. 112. Bilson in his survey p. 418.
Prot. authors do assent to his judgment therein.

Now this truth supposed, it fully preuenteth our adversaries usual evasion in
many points of controversy, as for example, where we allege the Fathers;
expounding some texts of Scripture in behalf of Purgatory, Prot. do commonly
object the same or some other Father, upon occation of other application,
understanding thereby the tribulation of this life, so opposing this against
the other, which exposition the said Fathers never intended, but admitted both
the said senses. And the like instance might be given of our adversaries like
evasion in other points of doctrine, as namely in the further exposition of Tu
es Petrus et super hanc Petram etc. Hoc est corpus meum etc. and sundry such
like. Now this is so certainly S. Austines doctrine, that the Prot. In the
ministers defene for refusal of subscription part. 1. p. 61.
Hutton accordingly alleges and confesses the forecyted saying of S. Austin
to this purpose.

S. Austin teaches that besides the sacred Scriptures, the Traditions of the
Church are to be received and believed: as also that al heretics do insist
only upon the Scriptures. SECTION. 4.
COncerning the question, whether the Scriptures do contain al needful points
of faith and salvation, not only by general direction to Hebrews. 13.17.
Obey our Prelates; Math. 18.17.
Hear the Church; hold 2. These. 2.15.
the Traditions etc. which we grant, and in which sense the Fathers do often
commend the Scriptures perfection; but also so particularly, as that there
should be no need of any unwritten Traditions, which we deny, and Protestants
affirm: S. Austin disputing against Ciprians error of rebaptizing, Tom. 7. de
Baptismo, contra Don. l. 5. c. 23. ante med.
says, The Apostles commanded nothing herein, but the custom which was
opposed against Ciprian is to be believed to have proceeded from their
tradition as many things be, which the universal Church houldeth, and are
therefore well believed to have been commanded by the Apostles, although they
be not found written. And speaking of the Baptism of Infants he Tom. 3. de Genesis
and lit. l. 10. c. 23. prope finem.
avouches that it were Not at al to be believed, if it were not an Apostolical
Tradition. Again Tom. 2. ep. 118. ad Ianuar. c. 1.
Those things which we observe not written but delivered which are kept al
over the world ar to be understood to be observed as decreed either by the
Apostles the selves, or general Councels. And so likewise Tom. 3. de doctrina
Cristiana. l. 4. c. 21. prope initium. And in council. Carthag. 3. can. 24.
The mixture of water with wine in the Chalice, he confirms from Tradition*
which his sayings are so evident for Apostolic Traditions, that M. In
Whirguiftes defense. p. 103.
Carthwright answearing thereto says, To allow S. Austines saying is to bring
in Popery again. Adding Ibidem, and in Carthwrightes his 2. ^eply. part. 1. p,
84. 85. 86.
further that If S. Austines judgment be a good judgment, then there be some
things commanded of God which are not in the Scriptures, and thereupon no
sufficient doctrine contained in the Scriptures.

Lastly whereas M. Carthwright, and others, do usually In Hookers Eccles. pol.
l. 3. sec. 7. p. 118.
object against unwritten Traditions certain obscure, and by us often
answered sayings of S. Austin, and other Fathers, our learned adversary M.
Ibipem. p. 119.
Hooker forbeareth not (in our so clear a cause) by his special explication
and answer, to explain and clear them to our hands, so that al further
answer I deem over tedious and unworthy. I will now conclude this point with
but remembering how peculiar S. Austin makes it unto heretics to insist upon
only Scripture: To which end he induces the Arian heretic saying then to
Catholics, as Protestants, Puritans, Brounistes, Anabaptiistes etc. do now
say to us, If Tom. 6. contra Maximinum. l. 1. prope init. and prope finem.
you bring any thing from the Scriptures etc. it is necessary that we hear it,
but these words which be besides Scripture are in no case received of us,
seeing our Lord does admonish us saying; In vain they worship me teaching the
commandments of men. And elsewhere he affirms as common unto al Tom. 3. de
Trinitate. l. 1. c. 3. prope n.
Heretics, to endeavor to defend their false and deceiptufl opinions out of the
Script. (As it is in part confessed and observed of him and others by the
Protestant Symphonia. c. 1. p. 96.
Polanus.) Yea he further avouches that, Tom. 3. de Genesis ad lit. l. 7. c. 9.
propc fin.
Not for any other cause they become heretics, but for not understanding the
Scriptures aright, they obstinatly defend their false opinions against the
truth of the Scriptures. And that Tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 18. prope init.
Heresies do not rise etc. but when good Scriptures are not well understood. In
which respect he says truly of heretics, Tom. 7. de Bap. contra Don. l. 3.
c. 19. post med.
Scripturas tenent ad speciem, non ad salutem, they have the Scriptures for a
show, but not to their salvation. And agreeably with S. Austin, says S. Orat.
2. contra Constantium. and l. ad Constantium. cyted by Polanus in Symphonia. p.
95.
Hillary, remember that there is no heretic which does not faigne the
blasphemies which he teaches to be according to Scriptures. Yea says S.
Disput. contra Arianos.
Athanasius, (cyted by In Symphonia. p. 95.
Polanus) every heresy is masked with the doctrines of Scriptures: whereupon
Lib. de praescript. and see S. Hierome ep. ad Paulinum.
Tertulian premonisheth against the uncertain encounter with the heretics by
Scripture.

Concerning the Church of Christ. CHAPTER. 4.
S. Austin teaches that the Church of Christ is freed from error. SECTION. 1.
DIrectly contrary to the general doctrine of Protestants impugning that
special privilege of the Church of Christ, being freed from error, S. Austin
agreeably with us Catholics, is so plain and full herein to the opposite, as
that he doubts not to refer us to her final determination in all questions of
doubt and difficulty: for speaking of the Rebaptising of heretics he says,
Tom. 7. contra Crescon. l. 1. c. 33. init.
Although example of this be not brought out of the Canonical Scriptures, ^ot
the truth of the same Scriptures is houlden of us in this matter, when we do
that which now pleases the universal Church which the authority of those
Scriptures commends, that so because the holy Scripture connot deceive
whosoever fears to be deceived with the obscurity of this question, let him
take council therein of the same Church, which without al ambiguity the holy
Scripture demonstrateth. Yea he fur-auoucheth that Tom. 2. ep. 118. c. 5. circa
med.
It is a point of most insolent madness to dispute against that which the
universal Church thinks. In so much as he faith, Tom. 7. de Bapt. cont. Don.
l. 7. c. 53. cir. med.
Of the Churches universal consent (in any point of doctrine) Id autem sit
securae vo^is asserere, it is secure to affirm it. And lastly he affirms the
decree of a general Counsel to be, Tom. 7. cont. duas ep. Pelag. l. 4. c. 12.
prope fin.
competens sufficiensque Iudicium, a competent and sufficient iugdement.

S. Austin teaches that the Church of Christ is Catholic or universal.
SECTION. 2.
THough the very name of Catholic be so vngratful and odious to the
auncienter heretics, that the Aug. tom. 7. l. 1. cont, Gaudent. c. 33. prope
init. et post med.
Donatists termed the sam an humane fiction, which yet says (S. Austin) are
words of blasphemy; as also to the more nouel sectaries, D. Against Rhem.
Test. in Act. 11.26. sec. 4.
Fulke confessing that, some Lutherans have altered the word of the Creed, and
for Catholic, put Christian. And Praefat. Noui Testamenti. Anno. 1605. And
see the Lutherans in colloq. Altemberg. in Respons. ad accus. corrupt. fol.
154. 353.
Beza styling it, The most vain term Catholic: yet S. Austin so highly
esteemed thereof, that he said, Tom. 1. de vera religione. c. 7. paul. ante med.
We must hold the communion of that Church which is named Catholic, not
only of her own, but also of her enemies, for will they, nil they, Heretics,
and Schismatickes, when they speak not with their own fellows but with
strangers, call the Catholic Church, nothing else but the Catholic Church,
for they could not be understood unless they discern it by this name, wherewith
she is called by the whole world. And though it be common to Protestants with
former heretics in words to style them selves Catholics, yet says S. Tom.
6. l. cont. epist. fundam. c. 4. circ. med.
Austin; whereas al heretics would be called Catholics, yet if a stranger
ask the way to the Catholic Church, no heretic dare show his own Church
or house. And the like saying is to be seen in S. Catech. 18.
Ciril. And even so at this day the name Catholic, is ordinarily appropriated
to us Roman Catholics by M. Act. mon. p. 613. Sleid. in the english history.
l. 7. fol. 96. et l. 10. fol. 127. Iac. in his reasons taken out of Gods word.

214. Humf. in vita Iuelli. p. 102. 100.
Fox, Sleiden, Jacob, Wilkes, Dresserus, Humfrey, and al other writers.

Yea this name Catholic was so powerful with S. Austin, as that he made it
one special motive (as now the like it should be to us) for to preserve and
keep him in the Churches bosom, saying hereof, Tom. 6. cont. epist. fundam.
c. 4. circa med.
Lastly the very name Catholic houldeth me etc. which words are so
undeniable, that D. Against Rhem. test. in Act. Apost. c. 11. v. 26. see, 4.
Fulke grants that, Among many other things which kept S. Austin in the
Church, the name of Catholic was one.

But to pass from the name to the thing it self, or reason of the name, that
the true Church should be called Catholic, not (as D. Ibidem.
Fulke with old heretics pretends) only in reguard of it observing all the
commandments of God, which very assertion S. Tom. 2. ep. 48. ad Vincentium
paulo ante med.
Austin confuteth, saying to the heretic, thou seem to have said somewhat
wittily, when thou expoundest the name Catholic, not by the communion of the
whole world, but by the keeping of all the commandments etc. But in reguard of
it becoming and continuing after it first increase Catholic and dispersed
over the world: In proof whereof S. Austin as the very Cent. 5. c. 4. col.
410. and col. 414.
Centuristes do observe) alledgedgeth many testimonies from the sacred
Scriptures saying, Tom. 7. de unit. Eccles. c. 8. initio.
Therefore let us hear some few from the Psalms song so long ago, and let us
see with great joy that they are accmoplished. And then immediately after both
there, and cap. 9. he alleges testimonies from the Psalms, over many to
recyte, and right worthy of the readers perusal and observation. And speaking
of the Ibidem. c. 7. initio.
Prophets, How many and how manifest are the testimonies (says he) of the
Church dispersed through al nations over all the world, from whence I will recite
some few, leaving more to the leisure of the readers fearing God. And then
reckning up a number of Esaies prophecies to this purpose, he affirms many
more, which (says he) are so many that from Esaias alone, if I should gather al,
I should exceed the measure of fitting speech. And in reguard of his so many
and plain predictions, S. Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 18. c. 29. post. init.
Austin affirms that, Esaias prophesyed so, that by some he was termed rather
an Evangelist then a Prophet: concluding also directly to the point, that as
heretical conuenticles connot be called Catholic in reguard they do but
preauile for certain times and incertaine provinces so again the true Church
is called Cath* in reguard of i^ foretold large and lasting extent; for thus S.
Tom. 9. de Symbolo. l. 4. c. vlt. circa med. and see To^. 10. de tempo^e. ser.
131. post med.
Austin writes, the Church possesses the whole which she received of her
hu^band in dowry etc. Eu^ry congregation of what heresy so ever lurketh in
corners, she is a concubine not a matron. O Arian heresy why do thou insult?
why do thou puf? why do thou also for a time usurp many things? etc. And
he urges the Donatists saying, Tom. 7. cont. Gaudent. l. 2. c. 2. circa med.
If yours be the Catholic Church, show it to stretch out in beams over the
whole world, show it to extend it bows with plenty of fruict over the whole
earth, for hence by the Greek word also it is named Catholic. And again it
is called in Greek Tom. 2. epist. 170. ad Seuerinum. ante med.
Catholic, because it is spread over the whole world, it is lawful for none to
be ignorant of her. And whereas D. Answer to a counterfeare Catholic. p.
95. and against Purgatory. p. 14.
Fulke obiecteth to the contrary that, the Church is not called Catholic,
because it should be every where etc. The Popish Church is not in every part of
the world, for Mahomet sect is the greater part, many countries are Idolaters,
and most of them that profess are not in the fellowship of the Popish Church.
This very objection S. Austin answeareth against Cresconius the Donatist in
these words, Tom. 7. cont. Crescon. l. 3. c. 63. fine.
Thou disputest foolishly against the most manifest truth, that therefore the
world does not communicate with us, because as yet there are many of barbarous
nations who have not believed in Christ, because under the name of Christ there
are many heresies different from the communion of our society etc.

S. Austin teaches that the miliant Church must ever continue, and that
visibly. SECTION. 3.
THough the militant Churches perpetual continuance, and visibility, be already
sufficiently employed in S. Austines foresaid assertions of it remaning
Catholic, yet because the contrary is very daungerously taught by sundry
Prorestants, I will yet further proceed therein. And first concerning her
continuance, whereas our adversaries teach that, before Luthers time Perkins
upon the Creed. p. 400.
an universal Apostasy over spread the whole face of the earth, and that
(their) Church was not visible to the world: Also that Chamierus in ep. Jesuit.
part 2. p. 49.
error possessed not one or other little portion (of the Church) but the
Apostasy auerted the whole body from Christ. That likewise Whitak. in resp. ad
rat. Camp. rat 3. p. 48.
the mystery of iniquity went through all the parts of the Church, and so at
last possessed the whole Church. In defense of which so miserable a refuge
(whereto our adversaries are enforced to betake them selves upon our provoking
them to show forth their Church for former times.) D. Fulke, and D. Willet are
not abashed to conclude that Answer to a counterfeat. Catholic. page 79.
the visible Church may become an Adultres, and be divorced from Christ: and
that the Synopsis. p. 52. 54.
visible Church may fail upon earth. Now S. Austin (directly against all this)
reproves these Protestants in their forefathers the Donatistes, as being
erroneous (says he) Tom. 7. de unit. Eccles. cap. 13. prope fin.
in that they wrested the Scriptures against the Church of God, as though it
might have been thought to have fallen away and perished from the whole world.
Reprehending them ^lso yet further in their saying (as Prot. now did) Tom. 8.
in Psalm. 101. con. 2. ante med.
Apostatauit et perijt Ecclesia de omnibus gentibus, the Church haith fallen
away and perished out of al countries. And again Ibidem. paulo ante.
That Church which was of al countries, now is not, but haith perished. whereto
he there answeareth saying, This they say (or object) who are not in the Church,
O impudent speech? etc. why do thou say that the Church haith perished out of
al countries? and concludes thus, Let not heretics brag as though the days
of the Church were few, for they are even unto the very end etc.

Now touching the Churches ever visibility, S. Austin affirms that Tom. 8. in
Psalm. 47. prope init.
she is the city placed upon a hill which cannot be hid, the candle which is not
hid under the bubel (but) known to al. And that Tom. 7. cont. lit. Petil. l.
2. c. 32. circa med.
Hence it is that the true Church is hidden to none, whereupon that is, which
Christ says in the Gospel, a city placed upon a hill cannot be hid, and
therefore in the Psalm it is added, he haith placed his tabernacle in the
sun, id est, in manifestatione, that is clearly to be seen. This inference
thus made by S. Austin from the Scriptures argues, that S. Austin spoke not
only as of the Church of his own time, but also as of the Church in the
ensuing times, which the said alleged Scriptures respected both a like: Yea S.
Austin is so confident in this doctrine of the Churches ever visibility, as
that he doubts not to set dowen this as a special mark, or as he says, Tom.
6. cont. Faustum. l. 13. c. 13. initio.
A manifest sign whereby evermore to direct the ignorant, which among so many
pretended congregations is the true Church.

S. Austin teaches that the Church was built upon S. Peter: and that S. Peter
was the head of the whole Church. SCTION. 4.
COncerning the Churches being builded upon the Rock, as S. Austin
acknowledges the building thereof upon Christ (as being the primary Rock or
foundation) so likewise does he affirm (as from the then common received
doctrine) our Saviors building of his Church upon Peter, as being a secondary
or ministerial Rock or foundation, houlding both these expositions for good
and probable, saying hereof expressly, Tom. 1. l. 1. retract. c. 21. post init.
Let the reader choose whether of these two opinions be more probable. To this
purpose then he writes, Ibidem.
in his book (contra epistolam Donati) I have said in a certain place
concerning Peter the Apostle, that upon him as upon a Rock the Church is
builded, which sense is also song by the mouths of many in the verses of most
blessed Ambrose etc. but I know that since I have often expounded that which is
said by our Lord; thou art Peter and upon this Rock I will build my Church,
that it might be understood upon this which Peter confessed, saying, thou art
Christ the son of God. And then presently afterward (as before he
concludes) but of these two opinions let the reader choose which is the more
probable. And he alleges and approves S. Tom. 7. de Bapt. cont. Don. l. 3.
c. 1. ante med.
Ciprian saying, for neither Peter whom our Lord chose first (or chiefest) and
upon whom he built his Church etc. And him self says elsewhere, Tom. 8. in
Psalm. 30. con. 2. ante med.
O Church, that is, o Peter, because upon this Rock I will build my Church, kill
and eat. And of Peter's sea, he denounces that, Tom. 7. in Psalm. cont. partem
Donat. versus finem.
It is the Rock which, the proud gates of hell do not overcome: In so much that
the Protestant Hammelmannus confesses this of S. Austin saying, De
Traditionibus Apostolicis. part. 2. l. 3. col. 622. and see the like sayings
of the other Fathers alleged and rejected f^r the same. col. 621. 623. 624.
625.
Austin in his book against the epistle of Donatus, teaches that the Church
was founded upon Peter as upon the Rock, and he proves this his opinion by
the verses of Ambrose etc. concerning the Cook etc.

But S. Austin proceeds yet more particularly saying, Tom. 4. quaestion. ex
Nouo Test. quaest. 75. post med.
Our Savior when he commanded that there should be given for him and Peter,
then he seems to have paid for all, because as in our Savior there were al
causes of pre-eminence, so also after our Savior al are contained in Peter,
for he ordained him the head of them, that he might be the Pastor of our Lords
flock etc. It is manifest that al are contained in Peter, for asking for
Peter, he is known to have asked for all, for ever in the superior, the people
are either reproved or commended. And again Tom. 8. in Psalm. 108. enarrat. 1.
prope initium.
certain things are said (in the Gospel) which properly seem to belong to
Peter the Apostle, yet they have not a clear sense, but when they are referred
to the Church, whose person figuratively he is known to have borne, by reason
of the primacy which he had over the Disciples etc.

S. Austin teaches the primacy of the Roman Church. SECTION. 5.
COncerning S. Peter's successors, the Bishops of Rome, S. Austin acknowledges
that in the Roman Church Tom. 2. ep. 162. multo ante med.
the principality of the Apostolical chair ever flourished. And Tom. 6. de
vtil. credendi. c. 17.
shall we doubt (says he) to hide our selves in the bosom of that Church,
which etc. from the Apostolical sea by successions of Bishops haith obtained
the hight of authority? To which not to give the Primacy, is truly either the
greatest impiety, or headlong arrogance. And writing to Pope Bonifacius him
self he says, Tom. 7. cont. duas epist. Pelag. ad Bonifac. l. 1. c. 1. circa
med.
It is common to us al wbo are Bishops, although thou therein do excel by
reason of the greater height of thy pastoral watchtower. In like sort he
writes to Pope Innocentius saying, Tom. 2. epist. 92. ad Innocent. prope finem.
we think etc. that by the authority of thy holiness derived from the authority
of the holy Scriptures, that they will more easily yeald who believe such
perverse and pernicious things: so attributing the Popes authority to the
Scriptures them selves. And as for Innocentius him self, the Centuristes
confess, Cent. 5. col. 1230. 662. and see Osiander. cent. 5. p. 59.
that he labored much for the primacy of the Roman Church, which is evident by all his epistles etc. whereupon they allege from his epistles, sundry of his
sayings, which importing so much, are therefore by them Cent. 5. col. 775. 779.
reprehended. And whereas Innocentius writ one epistle to the Fathers of the
Carthage Council, wherein he affirms the Primacy of the Roman Church to be In
Aug. tom. 2. ep. 91. prope init. and see cent. 5. col. 825. and 780.
decreed, non humana sed diuina sententia, not by humane but divine sentence.
And an In Aug. tom. 2. ep. 93. multo ante med. and see cent. 5. col. 843. 780.
other to the Milleuitane Concel, wherein he chalengeth that matters of faith
are to be referred to the Apostolical Sea. Though the Centuristes do dislike
and reprove these said epistles for the foresaid doctrines tauhgt therein by
Innocencentius; yet S. Tom. 2. epist. 106. post init.
Austin writing to Paulinus of the Pelagian heresy, which was condemned in
those two foresaid Councils, and me^cioning two several letters of those two
Councels sent to the Apostolic sea: To which two letters Innocentius made
several answer in his two former recyted epistles from whence are alleged
the testimonies of his clamed Primacy. S. Austin (I say) of these very
answeares or epistles writes thus worthily, Ibidem.
Innocentius of blessed memory writ back unto us concerning al things in that
manner which was fit and convenient for the Bishop of the Apostolic sea: and
elsewhere he further says of the same epistles, Tom. 7. cont. Julian. Pelag. l.
1. c. 4. post med.
what could that holy man (blessed Innocentius) answer to the Affrican
Councels, but that which aunciently the Apostolic Sea, and the Roman Church
continually held with the rest? Most evidently so hereby giving his allowance
of that very Primacy which Innocentius clamed in or by these two foresaid
epistles.

But indeed S. Austin was always so duly respective to the Roman Sea, as that
he greauosly reprehended the heretics of his time for their then Tom. 7.
cont. lit. Petil. l. 2. c. 51.
tearming the Roman Church (as our adversaries now do) the chair of
pestilence; and teaching with all (against the Protestants often objection) our
due reverence thereto, not withstanding the wicked lives of any Popes, Tom. 2.
ep. 165. ante med.
although (says he) any traitor in those times had crept into that rank of
Bishops, which is continued from Peter himself to Anastasius, who now sits
in the same chair, it would nothing hurt the Church and innocent Christians,
for whom our Lord providing, says of evil Pastors, what they say, do ye, but
what they do, do ye not. Lastly this wholesome council he gives unto al
heretics, Tom. 7. in Psalm. contra partem Donati versus finem.
come ye brethren if you will be ingrafted in the vine, it is a grief when we
see you cut of so to lie, number the Preistes even from the Sea of Peter, and
see in that rank of Fathers who succeeds another, that is the Rock which
the proud gates of hell do not overcome.

S. Austin denies Ecclesiastical Primacy to Emperors, and Kings. SECTION. 6.
THe Milleuitan Council (whereat S. Austin was present and In the last Canon of
the Mileuitan Council.
prescribed) decreed in the case of clergy me^ that Can. 19.
whosoever should ask of the Emperor the knowledge (or hearing) of public
judgments, should be deprived of his honor: Of which Canon Cent. 5. c. 33. p.
152.
Osiander says, It is not worthy of commendation. And whereas M. Jewel Reply.
art. 4. p. 272.
obiecteth the testimony of S. Austin concerning Constantine the great
undertaking the judgments of Bishops and their causes upon appeal made to him
in that behalf; S. Austin him self shall give him his answer in these
words, Tom. 2. ep. 162. multo post med.
The Emperor granted them another judgment at Arles, to wit, of other
Bishops, not because it was needful, but yealding to their importunities etc.
for neither durst the Christian Emperor so receive their tumultuous and
deceiptful complaints, that him self would judge of the sentence of Bishops,
which sat at Rome, but as I have said, he granted other Bishops, from whom
they also chose to appeal again to the Emperor, wherein you have heard how
he detested them etc. And as he had yealded to the^ to judge of their cause
after the Bishops, afterward he asked pardon of the holy Prelates: Yea S.
Austin says further that, Ep. 166. ante med.
because Constantine durst not judge of the cause of a Bishop, he committed the
same to be discussed and ended by Bishops. Optatus also (who lived with S.
Austin alleging Constantines answer to the Bishops that appealed to him
says Lib. 1. versus finem.
Constantine with great anger answered etc. you ask of me judgment in the
world, when I except the judgment of Christ. And a little after, Donatus
thinks that he may appeal from Bishops to which appeal Constantine thus
answered, O outrageous bouldnes of fury, as in the causes of Gentiles etc. Yea
this is so clear in S. Austin, that M Carthwright answeareth to M. Whitguifts
like obiecting hereof saying, 2. Reply part. 2. p. 163.
Austin says that the Emperor was driven by the Donatistes importunity who
made no end of appealing unto him, to give sentence in that matter, for the
which also he was to crave pardon of the Bishops etc. Lastly S. Athanasius
reports that the Bishop Hosius, said to Constantine, In ep. ad solitariam
vitam agentes.
I beseech thee to cease, and remember thou art mortal etc. do not entermedle
in Ecclesiastical matters, nor do thou command us in this kind, God haith
committed to thee the Empire; to us those things which concern the Church
etc. Take heed lest that drawing to thee those things which concern the
Church, thou be guilty of great crime etc. And again, who seeing him in
decreeing to make him self the prince of Bishops, and to be president in
Ecclesiastical judgments, may not deservedly say, that he is that abomination
of desolation which was foretold by Daniel?

Concerning the Sacraments. CHAPTER. 5.
S. Austin teaches that the Sacraments do not only signify, but truly confer
grace to the worthy receiver. SECTION. 1.
THough Fulke against Purgat. p. 35. Willet in his Sinopsis p. 415. Perkins in
his reformed Catholic. p. 294. 298. Jewel in his defense. p. 201.
Protestants usually teach, that Sacraments do signify grace, but not confer
it: yet S. Austin with us Catholics teaches the contrary saying, Tom. 9. in
John tract. 80. versus finem.
from whence is that so great virtue of the water, that touching the body it
washes the heart, but the word working it? etc. Clensing therefore would not
be attributed to the liquid and slippery element, if it were not added in the
word. And he proves by example of Circumcision, the force of Baptism to
children though they want faith, saying, Tom. 7. l. 4. de Bapt. cont. Don. c.
24. post init.
The Sacrament of it self was of great force. But this doctrine is so clearly
S. Austines, that Luther answeareth to Cochlaeus his obiecting of S. Austin in
this manner, Lib. cont. Cochlaeum.
But if there be any of the Fathers who have thought the Sacraments to justify
by their own virtue, though it be Austin as Cochlaeus contendeth, I nothing
care, they are the sayings of men. Agreeably to which also writes Calvin,
Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14. sec. vlt.
peradventure those immoderate commendations of the Sacraments which are read
in the ancient writers, as that of Austin etc. haith deceived those miserable
Sophisters.

And whearas Willet in his sinopsis. p. 418.
Protestants do further teach that the Sacraments of the old law are equal in
force to ours, S. Austin with us to the contrary avouches that Tom. 8. in
Psalm. 73. multo ante med.
There are some sacraments giving salvation, others promising the Savior; the
Sacraments of the new Testament give salvation, the Sacraments of the old
Testament promise the Savior. A saying so pregnant against Protestants that if
we believe Loc. com. p. 299. and see Calvin. l. 4. institut. c. 14. sec. vlt.
Musculus it was spoken inconsideratly by Austin. Yea says Calvin, Lib. 4.
instit. c. 15. sec. 7. And see Chemnitius examen. part. 2. p. 38.
Let it trouble no man, that the ancient Fathers strive to make a difference
between the one and the other, their authority ought not to be such as to
shake the infallibility of Scripture etc. Neither is that quircke of Austin to
be approved, that by the Baptism of John sins are forgeuen in hope, but by
the Baptism of Christ sins are forgeuen indeed.

S. Austin teaches that certain of the Sacraments do imprint a Character or
mark in the soul of the receiver. SECTION. 2.
THough D. Sinopsis. p. 419. and upon the 112. Psalm. p. 91.
Willet with other Protestants utterly deny al such Character, yet S. Austin
avouches the same, comparing the Character imprinted in the soul by certain
Sacraments with the external mark or Character used in warfare, saying, Tom.
7. l. 2. cont. epist. Parmen. c. 13. post med. tom. 7. l. 6. de Bapt. cont.
Don. c. 1. tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 5. and 6. tom. 7^. cont. lit. Petil. l. 2.
c. vlt. tom. 7. cont. Crescon. l. 1. c. 30. tom. 9. tract. 5. in ep. Joan. tom.
2. ep. 23. post med. et ep. 50. 204.
when a man is set at liberty and punished, is that Character renewed, or
rather being known, is it not allowed? Do Christian Sacraments less inhere
then this corporal mark seeing we see that the very Apostataes do not want
Baptism. But S. Austin is so clear in this point that D. Couel approves the
same in S. Austin against the Puritans saying, Defense of Hooker. art. 13. p.
91.
you scof at the word Character, as if there were no stamp at al which made a
difference between the Clergy, and Laity etc. S. Austin was the first that
used that word in this sense, and no doubt of it, there is in Baptism that
mark stamped upon us etc. This form, figure, impr^ssion, or Character, is
called indeleble, because that is not to be reiterated, from whence it comes,
that the Character of order is an active power etc. And the answearable
doctrine of the thing though not of the word, is so certainly taught by M.
Eccles. pol. l 5. sec. 77. p. 228.
Hooker, that M. Willet does therefore charge him with teaching that,
Meditation on the Psalm. 122. p. 91.
There is in orders given an indeleble Character.

S. Austin teaches that there are seven Sacraments. SECTION. 3.
COncerning the number of the Sacraments, which Protestants Willet in his
sinopsis p. 423.
generally teach to be but two, although S. Austin had no special occation
given him to write purposly of their certain number, yet by that which he
writes casually and but obiter, as by way of other discourse, he signifies
his opinion to be far different from Protestants. Behold (says Tom. 8. in
Psalm. 103. Concione. 1. ante med.
he) the guiftes of the Church, the gift of the Sacraments, in Baptism, in
the Eucharist, in the other holy Sacraments, what a gift is it? The Tom. 7.
cont. lit. Petil. l. 2. c. 104. circa med.
Sacrament of Chrisme in the kind of visible signs is sacred, even as Baptism
it self. In like sort comparing Baptism, with order, and proving that orders
once received connot be lost, no more then Baptism, he says, for both are
Tom. 7. cont. epist. Parmen. l. 2. c. 13. ante med.
Sacraments and with certain consecration both are given to man, that when he
is Baptized, this when he is ordered etc. And again, If both be Sacraments,
which none doubts of, why is that lost, and this not? Neither Sacrament must
be injured. Yet further, Tom. 7. de Baptis. cont. Don. l. 5. c. 20. post med.
If etc. by a sinner Sacraments are not celebrated, how does God hear the
mortherer praying, either over the water of Baptism, or over the oil, or over
the Eucharist, or over the heads of them upon whom hands are imposed. And
that S. Austin thought the same concerning Matrimony, Penance, and Extreme
unction, shall be showed hereafter in their proper places.

Ad only hereunto, that S. Dionisius the Arcaopagite, in his writings
confessedly ancient to S. Austin, does no less confessedly according to
Luther Tom. 2. Wittenberg. de captiu. Babil. fol. 84. Humf. in Jesuit. part. 2.
p. 519.
and D. Humfreys acknowledgements, mention six Sacraments, and S. Ciprian also
casually mencioneth fine, as Examen. part, 2. p. 7.
Chemnitius is forced to confess: Having no other answer thereto, but only
pretending without al proof that this sermon is forged and none of Ciprians;
whereas the book, de operibus Cardinalibus Christi, (whereof this sermon de
ablutione pedum, and the other de caena Domini, are parcels) is dedicated to
Cornelius Bishop of Rome in Ciprians time and to whom Ciprian him self wrote,
l. 1. ep. 1. and 3. in so much as Erasmus in his Annotations annexed to
Ciprians works, affirms it to be, Upon the folio. 287.
the work of some learned man of that age. And M. Fulke acknowledges that,
Against Rhem. Test. in 1. Cor. c. 11. v. 20. sec. 6.
The author (thereof) was not in time much inferior to Ciprian.

S. Austin teaches that the Sacraments are to be administered with the sign
of the Cross. SECTION. 4.
DIrectly contrary to al Puritans, and the more usual practice of Protestants
S. Tom. 9. in Euang. Joan. tract. 118. prope fin.
Austin teaches that, unless the sign of the Cross be applied, whether to
the foreheades of the believers, or to the water wherewith they are regenerated,
or to the oil wherewith they are anointed, or to the sacrifice wherewith they
are nourished, none of these are rightly administered. And the like he teaches
in sundry Tom. 10. de tempore. ser. 181. c. 3. fine. tom. 10. sermon. 19. de
Sanctis. fine.
other places. In so much that the Centuristes recyting and reproving this fore
alleged sentence, affirm thereof that, Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 657.
superstisiose loquitur, he speaks superstitiously. And D. Fulke
acknowledges that, Against Rhem. Test. in 1. Cor. 11. v. 34. p. 532.
Indeed S. Austin in John. Tract. 118. says, that the sign of the Cross was
a ceremony used in all the Sacraments which if it were not used, nihil eorum
rite perficitur, Burges in Couels answer to him. p. 136. Puritanes in their
treatise of the sign of the Cross. p. 21.
nothing is performed or done according to the ryte or custom. with whom agree
other Protestants, reproving S, Austin for this Catholic doctrine of the
sign of the Cross. And yet S. Chrysostom (living together with S. Austin)
gives like testimoney for the Greek Church saying, In Mathaeum. Hom. 55. post
med.
al things which help to our salvation are perfected by the Cross, for when
we are regenerated the Cross of our Lord is present, when we are nourished
with the most sacred meat, when we take Orders, every where and always that
ensign of victory is at hand.

Concerning Baptism. CHAPTER. 6.
S. Austin teaches that Baptism takes away al sins, both original and
actual. SECTION. 1.
FOr the obtaining of the grace given by Baptism, S. Austin agreeably with our
Catholic school men requires fit disposition: In so much that Hagoges
Christiana, part. 4. c. 28. p. 519.
Danaeus having recyted the effects of Baptism, affirms that, the scholemen
say, these are to be understood of those, who put no bar (or hinderance) to the
effects of Baptism, but it is (says he) an obscure speech, though Austin. c.
23. ad Bonifacium, says, obicem ponere. Now this bar supposed to be removed S.
Austin teaches, that, Tom. 7 cont. duas epistolas Pelag. l. 3. c. 3. circa med.
Baptism washes away al sins, al altogether, of deeds, words, thoughts,
or original. And the like he has in Tom. 9. de Symbolo ad Catechum. l. 3. c.
10. initio. Tom. 7. de pec. orig. c. 40. tom. 8. in Psalm. 50. ante med. Tom. 7.
contra Julian. Pelag. l. 6. c. 5. tom. 8. in Psalm. 118.
sundry other places so expressly, that the Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 368. and 516.
and 1133.
Centuristes, and Examen. part. 2. p. 38.
Chemnitius, do allege his sayings, and confess his judgment in our behalf.

S. Austin teaches that concupisence remaning after Baptism is not sin.
SECTION. 2.
IN reguard of this plenary remission of sin, S. Austin consequently further
teaches that Tom. 7. de nuptiis et concupis. l. 1. c. 23. prope initium.
concupisence is not now sin in the regenerate. And again Tom. 7. de pec.
mer. et remis. l. 2. c. 4. initio. et cont. Julian. Pelag. l. 6. c. 5. prope
fin. cont. duas ep. Pelag. l. 1. c. 13. tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei l. 1. c. 24. fin.
concupisence in children Baptized is free from guilt, it is left for the
combat. But this doctrine is so confessedly S. Austins and the other Fathers,
that Calvin says thereof Institut. l. 3. c. 3. parag. 10,
it is not needful to search much, what here the ancient Fathers thought, when
Austin alone may suffice thereto, who haith gathered with fidelity and great
diligence al their opinions, therefore let the readers take from him, if they
will have any certanty of the sense (or meaning) of antiquity, but between him
and us this difference may seem to be, that he etc. dares not call that
disease (of concupisence) sin, but etc. teaches it then at length to be
sin, when to the (first) conceiving or apprehension either deed or consent
follows. with whom agrees Chemnitius, who speaking of our concupisence
says, Loc. com. part. 3. in his Theses thereto annexed. fol. 18. b. parag. 10.
Austin began to dispute, that it was not properly sin but so called by a
figure etc. which ( if we will believe Chemnitius) was spoken incommodiously.

S. Austin teaches that children dying unbaptized are not saved. SECTION. 3.
THough it be now an ordinary opinion among Carthwright in Whitguiftes defense.
p. 516. Dillingham in his disput breuis de Symbo. p. 4. 5.
Protestants that children borne of faithful parents dying without Beptisme may
be saved, whose cruel and vnchariritable practice herein is over frequent and
answearable: yet S. Austin jointly with our now Roman Church teaches the very
contrary saying, Tom. 7. de anima et eius origin. l. 3. c. 9. initio. tom. 10.
de verb. Apost. ser. 14.
If thou will be a Catholic, do not believe, do not say, do not teach, that
children dying before they be Baptized, can come to forgeuenes of original
sins. And Tom. 2. ep. 28. ad Hieron. multo post med.
whosoever says that children shall be revived in Christ who dye whithout
participation of this Sacrament, this man truly contradicts the Apostolical
preaching, and condemns the whole Church etc. So generally received was the
doctrine hereof in his time. Lastly he teaches, that though Tom. 7. de pec.
mer. et remis. l. 1. c. 16. initio.
it may truly be said, that children dying without Baptism are to be in
damnatione omnium mitissima, in the easiest state of damnation, yet he
deceives and is deceived, who teaches that they are not to be damned. Now
these sayings are so vnanswearable in S. Austin that M. Carthwright confesses
that In Whitguifts defense. p. 521.
Austin was of mind that children could not be saved without Baptism: for
which he over bouldly charge him with Ibidem. p. 516.
absurdity. Sundry other Bullinger his Decades in english. dec. 5. ser. 8. p.
1049. Musculus, loc. com. c. de Baptis. p. 308. Dillinham de Symbo. p. 4. 5.
The Centuristes. cent. 5. c. 4. col. 379.
Protestants acknowledging and reproving likewise in him the same doctrine.

Now in reguard of this so absolute necessity of Baptism unto children, S.
Austin is confessed to teach, that in case of necessity it is lawful for the
Laity to Baptize, for thus writes In resp. ad act. colloq. Mon. tisbel. part.
2. p. 143. and see Whitguifes defense, tract. 9. p. 522. 523.
Beza, whereas Austin writes to Parmen. l. 2. c. 13. that he knows not
whether the Baptism which a Lay person etc. enforced upon necessity (of the
child) perishing does administer, is piously to be reiterated, is a blemish (or
error in S. Austin says Beza.

S. Austin teaches sundry ceremonies of Baptism now used in the Roman Church.
SECTION. 4.
FIrst then he teaches that, Tom. 10. in l. 50. homil. hom. 27. multo ante med.
the water being consecrated in the name of Christ is signed with his Cross,
and that, Tom. 10. de tempore sermon. 181. c. 3. prope fin. and ser. 19. de
sanctis. prope finem.
with this sign the font of Baptism is sanctified: which consecration of the
water is taught by S. Lib. 1. c. vlt. ante med.
Ciprian saying, the water ought to be cleansed and sanctified first by the
Priest. And by S. De mister. init. c. 3. post med. and Aug. tom. 9. in Joan.
Tract. 118. prope fin.
Ambrose in these words, when the water of salvation shall be consecrated with
the mystery of the Cross etc. S. Tom. 2. ep. 105. ad Sixtu^. versus fin.
Austin also teaches, the exorcisme of Infants from the Churches ancient
ryte, or custom; as also their Exuflation: of both which, speaking of Iulianus
he says, Tom. 7 de nup. et co^cup. l. 2. c. 29. fin.
He haith accused of greiuous crime the most ancient tradition of the Church,
whereby, as I have said, children are exorcised and breathed upon. And speaking
to Iulianus him self says Tom. 7. cont. Iul. Pelag. l. 6. c. 5. post init.
Thou were to be blown but of the whole world, if thou would contradict
this exufflation, wherewith the prince of the world is cast out of children.

In like sort concerning Annoyling before Baptism he further says, Tom. 9. in
Euang. Joan. tract. 44. post init.
He is annoyled but not yet washed etc. It is not sufficient for the
Catechumens) that they are annoyled, let them hasten to washing (or Baptism.)
Of this Carthwright confesses that, 2. Reply, part. 2. c. 4. p. 226.
Annoynting in Baptism was as general and of as long continuance as the
Cross, for b^ing in Afric in Tertulians time, it spread it self into the
east and west Churches.

Concerning Abrenunciation, and Godfathers to Infants. S. Austin affirms
that, Tom. 10. de tempore. ser. 116. prope fin. And tom. 9. de Symbol. l. 2. c.
1. and l. 3. c. 1.
The Godfathers answer for them that they renounce the Devil, his pompes, and
works: And that Tom 2. ep. 23. ad Bonif. post med.
They answer in the childs behalf to several interrogatories; mentioning
Tom. 9. in Euang. Joan. tract. 44. post init.
withal the use of spistle.

In like manner as touching trinall immersion, S. Austin says, Tom. 10. de
tempore. ser. 201. post med.
The mystery of the Trinity is also showed in the Sacrament of Baptism, whiles
the old man is thrice drowned. This ceremony is further mentioned by De co^ona
militis. Basil. de Spir. Sanct. c. 27 Cir. Catech, 2. Chrisost. hom. 24. in
Joan.
Tertulian, S. Basil, S. Ciril, and S. Chrysostom, which being afterward
misapplyed by the Arians to the signifying of three several natures in the
three persons (as S. Lib. 1. ep. 41. ad Leandrum.
Gregory records) one immersion was thereupon in some Churches Council. 4.
Toletan. c. 5.
established.

To conclude, al these ceremonies of Baptism are so clearly set down and
taught by S. Austin, that the (f) Centurie writers do particularly and at large
record and dislike the same: Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 415. 417. 418. 419. and Cent.
5. c. 6. col. 652. 657.
of which also says Resp. ad Tom. 2. Bellar. p. 281.
Daneus, so Austin and some Fathers thought, that they were Apostolical
traditions, which they believed to be most ancient, but without ground, says
Daneus.

Concerning the Sacrament of Confirmation. CHAPTER. 7.
COncerning Confirmation S. Austin writes that the water thereof is oil or
Chrisme. Tom. 9. in ep. Joan. tract. 3. ante med.
Spiritual unction (says he) is the holy Ghost him self, whose Sacrament is
in the visible unction. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 26. in praefat. enarrat. 2. prope fin.
we are now anointed in the Sacrament. And, In Psalm. 44. circ. med.
The visible oil is in the sign, the invisible oil is in the Sacrament.
Again, Tom. 3. de Trinit. l. 15. c. 26. post init.
God haith anointed him with the holy Ghost, not with the visible oil, but
with the gift of grace, which is signified by the visible oil wherewith the
Church does annoyle those that are baptized. This doctrine is so clearly S.
Austines, S. Hieromes, and S. Ambroses, that Danaeus reproves them in his
answer to Bellarmine, obiecting the same Fathers saying Resp. ad tom. ^. c.
6. p. 452.
Ambrose favors over much his Siricius and the Roman Bishopes, who brought
forth that Confirmation. Therefore what etc. Ambrose writ, it is to be
attributed to his error or favor toward the Pope of Rome, not to the truth;
Hieromes sentence against the Luciferians, corrupts the place of the 8.
chapter of the Acts; Austin was overwhelmed with the error or shipwreck of
his age. So general was the doctrine hereof in S. Austines time, for which also
S. Ciprian is reproved by De tradit. Apost. col. 773. 774. 775.
Hammelmannus.

This Chrisme according to S. Austin was only to be consecrated by a Bishop;
In so much that the 3. Carthage Council (whereat S. Austin was present and
subscribed) decreed that, Can. 36. and see council. 2. Carthag. c. 3.
A Priest should not consecrat virgins without acqua^ting the Bishop and should
never hallow Chrisme. A Canon so plain in our behalf that Osiander censureth
it to be Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 24. p. 529.
superstitious ambition, and ambitius superstition, and yet the answearable
doctrine of the other Fathers herin is reported by the Cent. 4. col. 865. 869.
503. 1274.
Century writers.

Yea S. Austin expressly calls it a Sacrament, saying, Tom. 7. cont. lit.
Petil. l. 2. c. 104.
The Sacrament of Chrisme is in the kind of visible signs sacred, even as
Baptism it self. These words are over plain for our adversaries to euade by
saying that S. Austin here used the word Sacrament improperly or but in a
general sense, except they will say the like of Baptism, which would be over
gross. And we have seen before, that S. Austin required the sign of the
Cross for the duly administering of this Sacrament. For which doctrine also the
Ministers of Lincoln diocese in their abridg. p. 41.
Puritans reprove Tertulian, Ciprian, and Ambrose.

This Confirmation S. Austin affirms to have been given with imposition of
hands: The holy Ghost (says Tom. 7. de Baptismo. cont. Don. l. 3. c. 16. ante
med.
he) is said to be given by imposition of hands etc. but the holy Ghost by the
imposition of hands is not now given as heretofore it was with temporal and
sensible miracles confirming the same to the commendation of the faith now
taught, and to enlarge the beginninges of the Church, for wbo now may exspect
that those upon whom hands are imposed for the obtaining of the holy Ghost,
should suddanly begin to speak with tongues? And again Tom. 3 de Eccles. dog.
c. 52. ante med.
those who are strengthened with the imposition of hands and Chrisme, let them
be admitted to the Eucharist. And whereas our Calvin institut. l. 4. c. 19. sec.
6. Carthwright. 2. Reply, part. 2. p. 233.
adversaries would escape by affirming that by this giving of the holy Ghost
was only meant the miraculous guiftes of the holy Ghost, mentioned in the Cap.
8. 17.
Acts of the Apostles, peculiar (say they) to those beginning times, S. Austin
haith already here sufficiently answered the same, and yet in further
surplusage he writes thus hereof, Tom. 9. in ep. Joan. tract. 6. post med.
Is it expected that those upon whom hands are imposed for the obtaining of
the holy Ghost, that they speak with tongues, or when we impose hands upon
these Infants, does every one of you observe whether they speak with tongues?
when you see that they do not, is any of you so perverse (as Calvin now is) for
to say that they have not received the holy Ghost?

Now as concerning the effect of this Sacrament which is the giving of the
grace of the holy Ghost, S. Austin and the other Fathers do so generally teach
the same, that according to M. Eccles. pol. l. 5. sec. 66. p. 170.
Hooker, The Fathers every where do impute unto confirmation the gift or grace
of the holy Ghost, not which makes us first Christian men, but when we are
made such, assisteth us in all virtue, armeth us against temptation and sin.
And in this truth the Fathers are approved by D. Modest examination. p. 192.

Concerning the real presence, or Sacrament of the Eucharist. CHAPTER. 8.
S. Austin teaches the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist. SECTION. 1.
TOugh the opinions of Protestants in this waightiest point of religion are
known to be many, and those very diverse and distracted amongst them selves,
yet S. Austin most conformably to the Roman Church teaches and believes the
true and real presence of Christ's sacred body and blood in the Sacrament: for
writing upon those words of the Psalm, he was carried in his own hands, he
demands, saying, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 33. concione. 1. versus fin. and see
concione. 2. et ante expositionem Psalmi.
Brethren how can this b^ done? In man who understands it? for who is carried
in his own hands? A man may be carried in the hands of others, in his own
hands no man is carried: How this may be understood in David according to the
letter I find not, but in Christ I find it, for Christ was carried in his own
hands, when commending his own body he said; This is my body, for then that
his body was carried in his hands. Here note that these words, were carried
in his hands (according to S. Austin) are literally understood of Christ
carrying his body in his hands at the last supper, when he gave the Sacrament
to his Disciples. Yea this saying is so vnanswearable that the Protestant Hist.
Sacram. part. 1. l. 4. p. 292. 293.
Hospinian undertaking to set dowen the hiperbolical phrases of the Fathers,
does among others for such place this now saying of S. Austin.

In like sort does he affirm that the Communicants do receive blood contained
in the Cup, no less truly then it was contained in the cup of the old
Testament; for whereas Vrbicus held, that the old Testament was so changed, as
that the beast gave place to bread, and blood to the Cup, S, Austin recyteth
and reproves his opinion saying, Tom. 2 in ep. 86. ad Casul. post med.
this vrbicus affirms old things so to be changed, that in Christ a beast
should give place to bread etc. blood to the Cup etc. he affirms a beast to
have given place to the bread, as not knowing, that the^ even the bread of
proposition was accustomed to be placed upon the table of our Lord, and that
now him self does reciue part of the body of the immaculate Lamb, he
affirms the blood to give place to the Cup, not remembering that now him self
receives blood in the Cup, therefore how much better and more fitly might he
affirm old things to have passed, and new things so to be made in Christ
that the Altar should give place to the Altar, sword to the sword, fire to
fire, bread to bread, a beast to a beast, blood to blood: Affirming so that for
the bread of proposition in the old law, we now have the bread of life, for
their then sheep, the now Lamb of God, and for their then blood of brute
beasts, the now blood of Christ. To which purpose he further says, The people
Tom. 4. quaest. in Leuit. quaest. 57. prope sin.
(of the old law) were prohibited from the blood of the sacrifices which were
offered for sins, but now by those sacrifices this one sacrifice is
signified, by which is made true remission of sins, and yet not any is
prohibited, not only for taking for nourishment (of the soul) the blood of
this sacrifice, but rather those which will have life are exhorted to drink it.
According to which also says S. Sermon. de caena Domini. multo ante med.
Ciprian, The doctrine of this Sacrament is new etc. Christ being the teacher,
this doctrine was first made known to the world, that Christians should drink
blood, the drinking whereof the authority of the old law did most strictly
forbid, for the law prohibiteth drinking of blood, the Gospel commands that
it be drunk.

S. Austin teaches that the very wicked do truly receive the body of Christ.
SECTION. 2.
Saint Austin affirms that, Tom. 7. de Baptismo. cont. Don. l. 5. c. 8. post
med.
It was the body and blood of our Lord even unto them to whom the Apostle said,
he that eats unworthily eats judgment to him self. Again, Tom. 9. in
Euang. Joan. tract. 27. versus fin.
Let us not eat the flesh of Christ and the blood of Christ only in the
Sacrament, which many evil men do, but let us eat it to the participation of
the spirit: And elsewhere he mentions the whicked, Tom. 7. cont. lit. Petil.
l. 2. c. 55. fine.
who eat and drink his body in the Sacrament: Now in these two last places,
by his thus adding these words, in sacramento, in the Sacrament, he does in
prevention of our adversaries usual answer, that by the body is meant the
Sacrament of his body, most directly to the contrary distinguish the body from
the outward Sacrament. In which doctrine he is so full that he affirms that,
Tom. 7. cont. Fulgent. Donat. c. 6. circa med.
The traitor Judas received the good body, and Simon Magus the good baptism of
Christ. And he doubts not to say further that, Tom. 2. ep. 162. versus finem.
Our Lord suffered Judas to receive amongst the innocent Disciples (quod
fideles norunt) pretium nostrum, our price (or ransom) which the faithful
know. This doctrine is so undeniable in S. Austin, that the Protest. Compend.
theol. l. 1. c. 8. p. 237. 238.
Echartus, alleges diverse of these sayings to this very purpose of wicked
men's real receiving of Christ's body. And Bucer says, Scripta Anglicana. p.
679.
How often does Austin write that even Judas received the very body and blood
of our Lord.

S. Austin teaches that great care is to be used lest any part of the
Sacrament do fall upon the ground: And that it is to be received fasting;
Besides which, he also teaches and allows the use of holy bread now used by
Catholics. SECTION. 3.
With what great care do we observe (says S. Tom. 10. l. 50. homil. hom. 26.
post init. And see sermon. ad Infantes.
Austin) when the body of Christ is ministered unto us, that nothing thereof do
fall out of our hands upon the ground: In which he is so clear that this
doctrine is acknowleged in him by the Prot. Praxis de Ceremoniis. sec. 13. p.
10.
Crastouius. And yet with him agrees herein Catech. 5. prope. fin.
S. Ciril, saying, Take heed lest any thing of it fall from thee etc. As also
Lib. de Cor. mil.
Tertulian writing, we take it greauosly that any thing of our Chalice or bread
do fall upon the earth. And the same is likewise taught by Hom. 13. in Exodus
Origin. For which their doctrine and reverence toward this most holy
Sacrament, they are confessed and reproved by the Protestant writers Against
Symbolising. part. 1. p. 148.
Parker, Aphorism. de Eucharist. fol. 230.
Vadian, Lib. ep. Suing. et Oecol. p. 690.
Oecolumpadius, and Reioynder to Bristow, and answer to Sanders p. 687.
Fulke.

In like sort concerning the receiving of this Sacrament fasting, it is so
evidently taught by S. Tom. 2. ep. 118. c. 6. ante med.
Austin, that Hist. sacram. part. 1. p. 48.
Hospinian confesses that Austin clearly signifies this fast to be an
Apostolical tradition, and therefore necessary to be observed, for he says, It
pleases the holy Ghost, that in honor of so great a Sacrament, our Lords body
should enter into the mouth of a Christian before other meats. which practice
was so general also in the greek Church, that Hammelmannus affirms that De
Apost. tradit. part. 3. l. 3. col. 814.
Theophilus accused Chrysostom under this title, that he debarred not from the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, those that were not fasting etc. but Chrisost.
taking this for a greauous crime does greatly excuse him self in his Epistle
etc. in these words, If this be true let my name be blotted out of the book
of life. And the same Hammelmannus concerning this very point says unto S.
Ibidem. col. 815.
Austin, Although thou Austin affirmest that the Church al over the world
observes this etc. yet I will bring the contrary against thee.

The same also is acknowledged by De Sacramentis. p. 803. 804.
Zepperus of S. Austin, who further there Ibidem. p. 805.
recyteth sundry Fathers requiring like enjoined Chastity of married persons
before their communicating.

Lastly concerning holy bread S. Austin writes that, Tom. 7. de pec. mer. et
remis. l. 2. c. 26. prope init.
Though that which the Catechumens receive be not the body of Christ, yet it is
more holy then the meats wherewith we are nourished: And that the Catechumen
might not receive the Sacrament (which S. Austin here calls corpus Christi)
appears by S. Austin in several Ibidem. c. 2. ad tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 11.
and 96.
places. A truth so clear that D. Against Heskins etc. l. 3. c. 23. p. 377.
Fulke answearing thereto, terms it, A superstitious bread given in S.
Austines time to those that were Catechumens, in steed of the Sacrament.

S. Austin teaches that the Sacrament of the Eucharist is to be adored: and
other Fathers teach that it is to be inuocated; and that Angels are present in
time of the sacrifice. SECTION. 4.
THough al Protestants, Caluinistes, or Suinglians, do generally disclaim in
the Sacraments adoration, yet S. Austin writing upon that part of the Psalm,
Adore ye the foote-stoole of his feet, does by this footstool understand
earth, and by earth the flesh of Christ, saying, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 98. circa med.
Expounding what is the foote-stoole of his feet, he says, the earth is the
foote-stoole of his feet: I become doubtful, I fear to adoare the earth, lest
he condemn me which made the heaven and the earth. Agine I fear not to adore
the foote-stoole of the feet of my Lord, because the Psalm says unto me,
adore ye the foote-stoole of his feet. wavering I turn my self to Christ,
because here I seek him and I find how the earth may be adored without sin,
how without sin the foote-stoole of his feet may be adored. for he took of
earth, earth, because flesh is of earth, and of the flesh of Mary he took
flesh. And because he walked here in that flesh, and gave us that flesh to eat
for our salvation, now none eats that flesh but first adoreth it. It is found
how such a foote-stoole of the feet of our Lord may be adored, and not only
we may not sin by adoring, but sin by not adoring etc. Therefore when thou
do bow down and prostrate thy self to every earth, do not behold it as
earth, but as that holy one whose footestoole it is which thou adorest, for,
for him thou do adore. Now whereas D. Bilson answeareth hereunto that His
true difference. part. 4. p. 536.
It is eaten with the spirit, adored with the spirit, yea the very eating of it
is the adoring of it, S. Austin directly to the contrary distinguishes eating
from adoring, and makes (as we do) adoring in priority to eating, saying, no
man does eat that flesh before that he adore it. Teaching withal there yet
further, our adoring thereof not only in spirit, but also by external bowing
down and prosternation: And all this not as to his body or flesh present to us
always after one and the same manner in heaven, but as in reguard of the
diversity of time and place upon often celebration) ad terram quamlibet, even
to every earth, or consecrated host which we behold. And in further discovery
of this shift, S. Austin makes further frequent mention of adoration even in
the unworthy: for speaking of the rich proud men who do unworthily receive,
acknowledges yet their external adoring, saying thereof, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 21.
concione. 1. prope fin.
All the rich men of the earth have eaten and adored, the rich men of the earth
have eaten the body of their Lords humility, yet they are not filled to
imitation as the poor, but yet they have adored. And again, Tom. 2. ep. 120.
ad Honoratum.
They are brought to the table of Christ and receive his body and blood, but
they only adore. they are not filled, because they do not imitate etc. They
come to the table, they eat and adore, but they are not filled, because they
do not hunger and thirst justice. This doctrine of Adoration is so plainly S.
Austines that Scripta Anglicana. p. 678.
Bucer confesses that Austin writes in many places that the body and blood of
our Lord is to be honored and received in the visible signs.

In further explication of S. Austines belief in this so material a point of
faith, the answearable sayings of the other Fathers are very pertinent, as
namely of S. Ambrose, S. Chrysostom, S. Nazianzen, and S. Basil, al of them
living in S. Austines age, and by him highly Tom. 7. cont. Julian. Pelag. l. 2.
c. 2. 3. 4. 10.
commended. S. Ambrose then (as heretofore did S. Austin) De spiritu sancto. l.
3. c. 12.
says, by the footstool is understood the earth, and by earth the flesh of
Christ, which we also at this day do adore, not mystically or in a mystery, but
in mysterijs etc.) in the mysteries of the external elements of the Sacrament.
Even as S. Austin in like manner is confessed by Hospinian to say, Hist.
sacram. part. 1. l. 5. p. 533. and see Gratian distinct. 2. Nos autem.
we do truly honor in the form of bread and wine which we see, things
invisible, that is to say, flesh and blood. S. Chrysostom accordingly writes,
In 1. Cor. hom. 24.
I will show thee upon earth (and therefore not in heaven only) that which is
worthy of greatest honor etc. the kingly body in heaven is now set before
thee on earth to be seen etc. And that which is the chiefest and principal of
al, thou do not only see it upon earth, but thou touchest it, and not only
touchest it, but thou eatest it etc. And ag^^ne, Ibidem.
This body did the wise men worship in the manger etc. And with fear and much
trembling adored it: Let us therefore imitate those strangers etc. Thou see
it not in the manger, but upon the Altar, not a woman houlding it in her arms,
but the Priest present. Yea S. Chrysostom admonishes us to pray unto it,
saying, In 1. Cor. hom. 41.
We do not in vain celebrate the memory of the dead as the holy mysteries, or
come beseeching the Lamb lying there. Agreeable to which says also S. Basil,
writing in behalf of unwritten De spir. sanct. c. 27.
Traditions; who haith left in writing the words of invocation whiles the
bread of the Eucharist and the Cup of benediction is showed?

And in reguard of the body thus honored on the Altar, S. Chrysostom further
teaches that De Sacerdotio. l. 6. c. 4. and hom. 1. de verbis Isaiae.
The Angels are present with the Priest, and that the place round about the
Altar is filled for the honor of him that lies thereon, the Angels co^passing
it about with reverence. And to prevent al usual answer of figurative or
excessive speech, he further De sacerdotio. l. 6. c. 4.
confirms the same by a vision thereof told to him as from an old man to whom
many revelations were showed. And In c. 1. Lucae.
S. Ambrose says, doubt not but that the Angel is present when Christ is
present, Christ is sacrificed etc. S. Gregory Nazianzen, reports that his
sister Gorgonia being diseased Orat. 11. de Gorgonia sorore.
prostrated her self before the Altar, and calling upon him who is worshipped
on it etc. O miracle (says he) she presently received health. This place is so
evident that D. Fulke (though euading what he may) is yet enforced to affirm
thereof that, De successione Eccles. p. 230.
Gorgonia had the Eucharist on the Altar in great reverence, and peradventure
not without superstion. And Hospinian terms Hist. sacram. part. 1. p. 477.
Gorgoniaes fact superstitious and wicked, as though the miracle here showed,
or Nazianzens commending of her herin, would have been for superstition. But
this truth is so confessed in the Fathers o^ that age, that Examen. part. 2. p.
92.
Chemnitius alleges at large the foresaid sayings of S. Austin, S.
Nazianzen, and S. Ambrose, him self thereupon concluding with Luther, that the
Eucharist is Sacramentum venerabile and adorabile, A venerable Sacrament and to
be adored. In so much that Chemnitius says of him self and other Ibidem. and
p. 94.
Lutherans, by such external confession (of the Sacraments adoration) we
separate our selves from the sacramentaries. And the very some is taught and
confessed from the foresaid Fathers by De Bapt. et Euchar. p. 472.
Chitraeus an other Lutheran.

From this known adoration of Christ under the Sacramental forms of bread and
wine, proceeded the mistaking of the Heathen, who (says S. Tom. 6. l. 20.
contra Faust. Manich. c. 13. post med.
Austin) do believe that we do honor, insteede of bread and the Chalice,
Ceres, and Bacchus. And why were Christians thus charged to worship Ceres, and
Bacchus, for the sacrmental bread and Cup, rather then Neptune, or some other
like for the water in Baptism, were it not in respect of the honor peculiarly
exhibited to the Eucharist, and not to Baptism.

In like sort whereas in regard of the height of the mystery, and the foresaid
honor so exhibited the fathers of that age were unwilling to expose the
celebratio^ thereof to the unworthy eyes of the Catechumens, whereof In ep. 8. p.
80.
Beza says, Most of the most ancient (writers) thought that Christinorum
sacra, the sacred mysteries or sacrifices of Christianes were to be hid, not
unlike to certain mysteries of Ceres, in so much that they would not admit the
Catechumens to behold them. As also they were unwilling to expose the same to
the profane scorn or misconceiuing of the Heathen, in so much as they
therefore, and especially Tom. 8. in Psalm. 33. and in Psalm. 39. Tom. 10. in l.
50. homil. hom. 42. tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 10. c. 6. fine. Tom. de verbis
Domini. in ser. 46. tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 26. tom. 2. ep. 162.
S. Austin profess to speak thereof, not without special reservation, as
Norunt fideles, the faithful know, norunt qui initiati sunt, they who are
admitted (or professed) know, and such like. Whereupon Maximus a heathen writer
(though acknowledging Tom. 2. ep. 43. prope init.
one chief God without beginning does, in reguard of this private celebration
of the Eucharist, wherein (as he conceived) Christians saw and worshipped Christ
their God, present to them in secret places, demand to know from S. Austin,
Ibidem. ep. 43. post med.
what God that is which you Christians challenge as proper to your selves, and
dispose your selves to see him present in secret places?

Now whereas Protestants do generally object that Pope Honorius, who lived, Anno
Domini. 1220. was the first that commanded or decreed the adoration of the
Sacrament; the decree of See cap. sanc. de celebratione Missatum.
Honorius only being that, The Priest should often teach his people that when
at Mass the Host is elevated, they should reverently bow dowen, this the^
rather most evidently proves the the^ before general received doctrine and
practice thereof among the Clergy and only argues the lay peoples then late
beginning negligence in some places, and so far is this decree from al
suspicion of innovation, that whereas the Roman Church had many then open
adversaries, no one of them yet charge this Honorius with innovation.

But to clear Honorius, of the least suspicion herin, before him lived Odo In
Synodicis constit. c. 5. de secram. Altaris.
Parisiensis. Anno. 1175. who advises that, The Lay people be often
admonished, that whersoeuer they sbal see the body of our Lord to be carried,
forthwith they bow their knees as to their Lord and Creator. Before Odo lived
Algerus, Anno. Domini. 1060. who says, De sacram. Euchar. c. 3.
with this faith we adore the Sacrament as a divine thing, we speak unto it as
a lively and reasonable thing, and pray; Lamb of God which takes away sins
have mercy upon us, because we believe not that which is seen, but that which
truly is, Christ to be there. About these times lived the heathen Philospher
Aueroes, Anno. 1142. as witnesses M. Cronicle. fol. 208.
Couper, who testifyeth so abundantly the general practice of this adoration in
his time, for which he deryded Christians, that the same is confessed and
reported by M. Against Heskins. p. 235.
Fulke, and by De religione Chrstiana. l. 4. c. 18. p. 340.
Ramus. In so much that M. Sutliue relates that, Abridgement or, survey of
Popery. c. 47. p. 295.
Aueroes of al religions accounted Popery to be most absurd, for that the
Papists worship a piece of a Mass cake for their God, and yet presently
devour him into their bellies. Before al these lived S. Damascene, whom Cronic.
p. 451.
Carrion charge, not only with Transubstantiation, but withal places, the
adoration of the reserved and elevated bread within the second 500. years
after Christ. Pratorius De sacramentis. p. 288.
also not only telling how Damascene taught transubstantiation, but withal
affirming that Anno. 735. Adoration of the bread followed it, as if Christ were
there, says he; whereto M. Act. mon. p. 896.
Fox adds, that if Honorius did not (as we have seen he did not) first
begin the same the^ we cannot (says he) find it out to come in by any other.

And do but now lastly obsetue that whereas D. Appeal. l. 4. c. 29. p. 566.
Morton does praticularly recyte al or most of these alleged premises, he does
yet in liew of direct answer thereto, shufle them of with other extrauagant
discourse, and deceipful comparing of phrases, answearing nothing at al to the
aknowledged testimonies of Odo, Algerus, Aueroes, Carrion, and Praetorius, al
which do evidently prove the observed practice of adoration, before the time of
Honorius the 3. He also answeareth nothing to that which is there inferred from
the words of Honorius his decree proving adoration to have been then before
general. He likewise answeareth nothing to the foresaid and there cyted
testimonies of S. Austin, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and Nazianzen, nor to
Chemnitius, so alleging them. He trifleth about Urban the 4. who lived after
Honorius the 3. He obiecteth for authentical against us, Cassander, a condemned
nouelist, his alleged words yet being not against the adoration, but
circumgestation of the Sacrament: and he finally endeauoreth to deceive and
sophiticate his reader from external adoration, to adoration improperly taken,
by deceiptful comparing of phrases, which course but admitted, no point of
religion can be so plainly delivered, but may thereby be euaded, seeing no word
almost can be alleged which haith not sometimes by some of the Fathers, in some
one or other matter and upon other occasion been improperly used.

Wherefore I bouldly provoke to the readers judgment that none so stupid as
hence discerns not, that the known and vnanswearable practice of this
Adoration, perpetuated thus from before the objected time to the contrary of
Honorius the 3. to the foresaid confessed much more ancient times, without any
nouel contradicted beginning thereof in the mean time known, is a most sure
and saife interpreter of the other foresaid sayings alleged formerly in proof
thereof from S. Austin, Chrysostom, and other the ancient Fathers of that
age, and that as those Fathers did agree with the times following in semblable
terms of Adoration, so likewise in one and the same intended truth and
meaning thereof: Then which what can be produced more conuincing and
demonstratiue in proof of the real presence, which the said adoration does
necessarily suppose.

S. Austin teaches that the Eucharist is a true and proper sacrifice, and that
it is propiciatory even for the dead; And that it was offered upon Altars
consecrated with oil, and the sign of the Cross. SETION. 5.
IN further proof of S. Austines professed doctrine concerning both real
presence, and adoration, he affirms with us the Eucharist to be a sacrifice
according to the order of Melchisadech, exhibited of Christ's body and blood
offered. To which purpose he writes, Tom. 6. cont. aduers. leg. et Prophet. l.
1. c. 20. post init.
Those who read know what Melchisadech brought forth, when he blessed Abraham,
they are also partakers of it, they see the like sacrifice now to be offered to
God al over the world. Again, Tom. 2. ep. 95. ad Innocent. post med.
Melchisadech bringing forth the Sacrament of our Lords table knew to prefigure
his eternal Preisthood. As also, Tom. 5. de ciuit Dei. l. 18. c. 35. circa med.
we see this sacrifice by the Preisthood o^ Christ according to the order of
Melchisedech to be now offered to God in every place from the East to the west.
This point of Melchisedeches sacrifycing is so clear in S. Austin that D.
Appeal. p. 166.
Morton in his very obiecting of him, yet acknowledges that S. Austin held
that Melchisedeches offering was a sacrifice.

Now this sacrifice of the new Testament according to the order of
Melchisedech, S. Austin teaches to be the sacrifice of the body and blood of
christ saying most pregna^tly of christ that, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 33. Con. 2. ante
exposit. Psalm. post med.
Of his body and blood he or dained a sacrifice according to the order of
Melchisedech. As also Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 17. c. 20. post. med.
what more credible to speak, then that which pertains to the participation
of this table, which the Priest him self the mediator of the new Testament
exhibiteh according to the order of Melchisedech of his own body and blood;
for this sacrifice haith succeeded to all the sacrifices of the (...) Testament.
Again reporting, how Ibidem. l. 22 c. 8. ante med.
one whose house had suffered hurt by wicked spirits, requested a Priest to go
thither, whereupon (says S. Austin) one went and offered there the sacrifice of
the body of Christ, praying earnestly that that trouble might cease, (and) God
forthwith taking pity, it ceased. And as here he calls it the sacrifice of
Christ's body, so elsewhere he calls it, the sacrifice of the mediator,
saying, Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 110. initio.
It is not to be denied, that the souls of the dead are reliued by the piety
of their living friends, when the sacrifice of the mediator is offered for
them. A saying also so plain for Purgatory, that for such it is confessed and
rejected by In his Treatise upon S. Aust. Enchirid. in c. 110. fol. 310.
Danaeus. It is also called The sacrifice of our price or redemption, for S.
Austin speaking of his mother Monica then dead, he says, Tom. 1. l. 9.
confess. c. 12. circa med.
when the sacrifice of our price was offered for her etc. And again, Ibidem.
c. 13. circa med.
she desired that she might be remembered at thy Altar etc. where she knew the
holy oblation to be given wherewith the band it cancelled which was against us.
He calls it also, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 8. c. 27. ante med.
The sacrifice of Christians, See before here at t.
which succeeded all the sacrifices of the old Testament: whereof he also further
writes, that, Tom. 7. de bapt. cont. Don. l. 3. c. vlt. prope fin.
Those whom our Lord cleansed from the leper he sent back to the same
Sacraments, that with the Preistes they might offer for them selves sacrifice,
because the sacrifice which he would have to be celebrated in the Church for
them al, had not yet succeeded.

S. Austin also avouches, that this sacrifice of Christ's body and blood is
propitious or auailable for the souls in Purgatory, his words are, Tom. 3. in
Enchirid. c. 110. post med.
when therefore the sacrifices whether of the Altar, or of the Alms, are
offered for all the dead that are Baptized, they are thankes-geuinges for those
that are very good, and they are propitiations (or sacrifices to apease Gods
displeasure) for those that are not very evil: These words are so conuincing
that De sacrificio M^ssatico. l. 2. c. 7. p. 525. And see the Centuristes.
cent. 5. c. 6. col. 674.
Hutterus excusing Ciprians objected words of sacrifice for the dead, as to
be but meant of the sacrifice of prayer; yet coming next after to answer
this place of S. Austin, in steed of al evasion it is so direct and plain for
external sacrifice for the dead, that as enforced he says thereof, In
aeternum defendi non potest, it can never be de^ended; And therefore immediately
after he provoke to the law and testimony of Esaias. 8.20. having affirmed
before that, In this present question (of sacrifice) Austin does not agree with
him self. But S. Austin proceeds yet further teaching this to be a tradition
of the universal Church, saying, Tom. 10. de verbis Apost. sermon. 32. c. 2.
initio.
It is not to be doubted but that the dead are helped by the prayers of the
holy Church, and by the wholesome sacrifice, and Alms, which are given for
their souls, that our Lord may deal more mercifully with them then their
sins have deserved. for the universal Church observes this as delivered from
their forefathers, that those should be prayed for, and the sacrifice remembered
to be offered for them who dye in the communion of the body and blood of
Christ, when they are remembered in their place at the time of the sacrifice
etc. It is not to be doubted, but that these things do profit the dead, but
such, who have so lived before their death, that these things might be
profitable to them after their death. for such as d^e without faith, which
works by charity, and the Sacraments, in vain are these works of piety
bestowed upon them by their friends etc. Therefore no new m^rits are ob^ayned
for the dead, when their friends do any good for them, but their own merits
going before, these are made to follow. Lastly his advise is that, as for such
things which help the souls of the dead, as sacrifices, prayers, Alms, they
bestow for them more diligently, instantly, abundantly which being dead in
flesh not in spirit, they love not only carnally but spiritually: This place
is so pregnant for our purpose that it is recyted, confessed, and rejected by
De origin erroris. c. 9. fol. 223.
Bullinger. Lastly S. Austin teaches that this sacrifice is offered upon
Altars saying, Tom. 10. de sanctis ser. 11. prope init.
The body of our Lord is offered upon the Altar. And Tom. 5. de ciuit Dei. l.
22. c. 10. circa med.
we erect Altars in which we sacrifice to one God. Affirming further that, Tom.
10. de sanctis, ser. 19. prope. fin.
Altars are consecrated with the sign of the Cross: And that Tom. 10. ser. de
tempore. 255. initio.
The stone is hallowed or anointed, upon which the divine sacrifices are
consecrated unto us. Yea such reverence he bore to Altars, that says he,
Ibidem.
We celebrate this day the consecration of the Altar. And the use of Council.
Agathens. can. 14.
Altars was such in this age of S. Austines, that the Centuristes say, Cent. 5.
col. 744. Osiander. cent. 5. l. 4. c. 18. p. 482. and l. 1. c. 30. p. 123.
they begun in this age etc. to consecreate Altars of stone, pouring upon them
Chrisme as is decreed in the 26. Canon of the Council Eupaunense.

Concerning the Sacrament of penance: wherein auricular confession to Preistes,
imposed penance, and days of pardon are taught by S. Austin, and other
Fathers. CHAPTER. 9.
AS concerning Penance, S. Austin teaches, that it imports a further penalty
then only repentance or grief of mind for sin committed, and that
therefore it extends it self also to external accomplishments, consisting in
Alms, fasting, and other like works of penance: In which respect he
describes Tom. 4. de vera et falsa paenit. c. 8. post med.
Penance to be a certain revenge of him that sorroweth, punishing in him self
that which he is sorry for having committed.

This penance according to S. Austin is diversely imposed, Tom. 3. in Enchirid.
c. 65. initio.
according to the measure (or diversity) of every ones sin: And, Ibidem. And
see council. Carthag. 3. can. 31.
times of penance (says he) are rightly appointed by them who govern the
Church. And whereas M. Synopsis. p. 504. Cal^in. Institut. l. 4. c. 15. sec. 4.
etc. 19. sec. 17.
Will. thinks that the remission given us in Baptism does suffice for all the
sins committed after Baptism, and therefore that the Penance, now entreated
of, should be unnecessary. S. Austin to the contrary writes that Tom. 2. ep.
23. ad Bonif. multo ante med.
If the child with the increase of age become evil, then begins he to have
his own sins, which are not taken away by regeneration (or baptism) but are
cured by another medicine: which in an other place he explaineth to be Penance,
saying, Tom. 6. l 2. de adulterinis coniug. c. 16. prope intium.
If murder be committed by a Catechumen. it is washed away by baptism, but if
it be committed by one that is b^ptised, it is healed by penance and
reconciliation.

In like sort those words Joan. 20.23.
of Christ, whose sins you forgive, they are forgeuen, whose sins you
retain, they are retained, in S. Austines judgment do extend further then to
our private repentance for says he, Tom. 10. l. 50: homil. hom. 49. c. 3. post
med;
do ye such penance as is done in the Church etc. Let no man say to him self,
I do it secretly, I do it with God, God who pardons me knows that I do it
with my heart, for then without cause it had been said, what ye shall louse in
earth, shall be loused in heaven, then without cause are the keys given to the
Church of God, we make void the Gospel of God the words of Christ, we promise
to our selves that which he denies.

Hence also it is that S. Austin makes the Priest the delinquents judge,
saying, Tom. 4. de vera and falsa paenit. c. 20. ante med.
Let the spiritual judge take heed etc. for he ought to know what he is to
judge, the power of a judge requires this. And again, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei.
l. 20. c. 9. ante med.
No judgment given seems better to be taken, then that which is said,
whatsoever ye sbal bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven. yea he
ennableth the spiritual judge, the Priest, as truly to louse or forgive the
sinner upon his repentance, as in type thereof Lazarus was upon his restoring to
life, loused and let go, for thus he writes, Tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 49. in
c. Joan. 11. versus fin. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 101. con. 2. post init.
when thou confessest, thou go forth, for what is it to go forth, but as it
were by going forth to be cleared from hidden sins? But that thou may
confess, God causes crying with a loud voice, that is calling with great
grace. Therefore when the dead man came forth yet bound, confessing and yet
guilty, that his sins might be loused, ou^ Lord said to the ministers, louse
him and let him go. what is this, louse him and let him go? Whatsoever you
shall louse upon earth, shall also be loused in heaven. As also, Tom. 9. in Joan.
tract. 22. circa med. And see Tom. 4. de vera and falsa paenit. c. 10.
before he confessed he was hidden, but when he confesses, he comes forth
out of darkness to light, and when he haith confessed, what is said to the
ministers? That wbich was said at the grave of Lazarus, louse him and let him
go, how? It is said to the Apostles the ministers, whatsoever ye shall louse
upon earth, shall be loused also in heaven.

In further explanation yet of S. Austines judgment in this so weighty a
point, we may see also the agreeable sayings of Pacianus, and S. Ambrose, from
whom S. Austin may not be thought for to dissent: whereas then the Nouatians
erroneously taught concerning such as fell in persecution that, Hist. t^^partit.
l. 2. c. 13.
They were to be invited to penance, but the hope of forgeuenes they were to
expect not from the Preistes, but from God alone who haith power to forgive
sin; Against this Protestant like error of the Nouatians, Pacianus says, In
ep. 1. ad Symphronianum.
Thou affirmest that God only can do this, it is true, but that also which he
does by his Priests, is his power, for what is that which he sath to the
Apostles, whatsoever ye shall bind upon earth etc. Answearably to which writes
S. Ambrose of the same Nouatians thus, Lib. 1. de paenit. c. 2.
But they say they give reverence to our Lord to whom only they reserve the
power of forgeuing sins, but to none do they greater injury etc. for seeing
our Lord said in his Gospel etc. whose sins you forgive they are forgeuen
etc. who does more honor, he who obeys the commandments, or he that
resists? And Ibidem. c. 7.
why do ye baptize, if by man sins may not be forgeuen? This error was so
certianly the Nouatians, that for such it is reported and confessed by Examen.
part. 2. p. 193.
Chemnitius.

Hence also it is, that S. Austin so often persuades, not only to Confession,
but also against al shamefastnes in hinderance thereof, which argues a further
Confession then only private to God, premonishing withal to provide in time,
and setting forth the great danger, if so by the deferring they should dye
before the Preistes absolution received: Of these points then he writes thus,
Tom. 8. in Psalm. 66. Post med.
Thou fear to confess, who not confessing yet connot be hidden: Thou shall
be condemned houlding thy peace, who confessing might have been freed. And a
little after, be sorrowful before thou co^fessest, being confessed rejoice, now
thou shall be healed. The conscience of of him that does not confess had
gathered corruption, the impostume swelled, it vexed thee, it did not suffer
thee to be at rest. The Physician applies the plastars of words, and sometime
cutteth etc. Ackowledge thou the hand of the Physician, confess, let it go
out in confession, and let all the corruption run out. Again, Tom. 10. l. 50.
homil. hom. 12. init.
We ought to confess our sins daily and humbly, not only to God, but also
to holy men and those that fear God etc. For God will not therefore that we
confess our sins, as though he could not know them, but because the devil
desires this, that he may find what to object against us before the tribunal
of the eternal judge etc. Therefore against his enchantments and decepts,
wherwit he does now hinder our return let us take most wholesome precepts
against him, who now will hinder in us the confession of sin. Yea he advises
us to be mindful hereof in time of health, Ibidem. hom. 41. post. med.
because (if a man) shall prolong it to the end of his life, he knows not
whether he can receive penance, and confess his sins to God and the Priest.
To which purpose his council further is, that man Tom. 4. de vera et falsa
paenit. c. 10. initio.
make known his life to God by the Priest, let him prevent the judgment of
God by confession. And again, Tom. 9. l. 2. de visit. infirmorum. c. 4. paulo
ante med.
There are some who think it sufficient for their s^luation, if to God alone,
to whom nothing is hid etc. they confess their sins, for they will not, or
they are a shamed, or they disdain to show them selves to the Preistes etc.
but I would not have thee deceived with that opinion etc. for his judgment is
to be undergone whom our Lord does not disdain to be his Vicar. As also,
Ibidem. c. 5. ante med.
If thou do remember the places and times in which thou have sinned, and with
whom thou have sinned they are to be told.

Concerning shamefastnes, a great tentation against confession of sins, S.
Austin writes that, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 50. multo ante med.
there are man's who are not ashamed to sin, (but) are ashamed to do penance;
O incredib^e madness, thou art not ashamed of the wound it self, yet thou art
ashamed of the bynding thereof etc. Therefore fly to the Physician, do penance.
For blushing (says he Tom. 4. de vera and fall. paenit. c. 10. prope initium.
elsewhere) obtains part of remission etc. for in this that him self tells
to the Priest, and overcomes shame with the fear of offense, the sin is
pardoned. And speaking of Cities besiged, who joined Baptism and penance
together for their relief, he tells how that in such common danger there is
Tom. 2. ep. 180. ad Honoratum. circa med. and see tom. 6. de adult. coniug. l.
1. c. 28. fine. and tom. 10. 50. homil. hom. 41.
concourse of people of al ages, some desiring Baptism, others reconciliation,
others also the doing of penance it self etc. where if the ministers be
wanting what destruction follows them who dye, either not baptized, or bound,
etc. but if the ministers be present etc. some are baptized, others reconciled
etc.

This absolution or reconciliation was given by the Priest with imposition of
hands, and enjoined penance, for thus the 4. Council of Carthage (whereat S.
Austin was present and subscribed) decreed that, Cap. 76.
he who in his sickness desired penance etc. should be reconciled by imposition
of hands etc. If he recovered etc. he should be subject to the appointed laws
of penance, as long as the Priest who gave him penance shall think good. This
Canon is confessed and approved by Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 15. and see the
Council, can. 78.
Osiander. And the Centuristes do acknowledge for the practice of this age
that, Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 665.
Penitents were absolved with imposition of hands. To which purpose also S.
Austin advises the sinner that He Tom. 4. de vera and falsa paenit. c. 15.
prope initium.
put him self wholly in the power of the judge, in the judgment of the Priest,
re^eruing nothing to him self, that he may be ready to do al things for the
recovering the life of his soul, which he shall command. And his further
advise is that, Tom. 10. de sanctis. sermon. 39. post med.
we seek confession with pure heart, and perform our penance given by the
Preistes. Of which penance the third Council of Carthage decreed, that Can. 31.
by the sentence of the Bishop times of penance should be appointed to
penitents according to the difference of their sins.

This Penance or temporary punishment was so enjoined, as that sometimes also it
was remitted by indulgence or pardon, for so the 4. Carthage Can. 82.
Council (whereto S. Austin subscribed) decreed, that penitents should kneel
down even upon the days of pardon. And Innocentius who (in reguard of the
known corresspondents between him and S. Austin) is no obscure interpriter of
his doctrine, affirms likewise Ep. 1. ad Decentium. c. 7.
of penitents etc. who do penance etc. that the custom of the Roman Church
shows, that the Thursday before Eeaster pardon was to be given them. In which
belief S. Chrysostom was so full as that the Centuristes confess that, Cent.
5. c. 6. col. 692.
Chrysostom affimeth that there are days of pardon and Indulgence. And to
omit S. Lib. 3. ep. 15. 16. 18. and Council. Ancyran. Can. 5 and Council. 1.
Nicen. can. 11.
Ciprian, teaching pardon of penance enjoined. M. Bell acknowledges that Survey
of Popery, part. 3. c. 11. p. 492.
Pardons sealed with lead, called the Popes Bulls were granted by Pope Adrian.
Anno Domini. 772. S. Gregory also is most expressly reprehended and charged
Symonds upon the reuelatio^s. p. 84. Bale in actis pontif. Roman. p. 46.
for granting pardons to such as frequented Churches on set days. Pantaleon
Cronic. p. 48.
to this end alleging S. Gregory's own writings.

But to conclude, our doctrine of penance and confession is so clearly taught
by the fathers of those Primitive times, that M. Simondes charge Upon the
revel. p. 57.
Leo the 1. with auriculer confession: The Cent. 3. c. 6. col. 127.
Centuristes confessing the same of other more ancient Fathers. A doctrine
also in it self so true, that In Apol. confess. Augustan. art. 13. de numero.
sacram. fol. 161.
Melancton thinks it easy to judge, which are properly Sacraments etc.
Therefore (says he) Baptism, the Lords supper, Absolution, are truly
Sacraments etc. with whom agrees Luther saying, At the first I denied 7.
Sacramets and only placed 3. for the time, Baptism, Penance, bread etc. And
the like doctrine is taught by Loc. com. Tom. 1 fol. 305. Altham. in Conciliat.
loc. script. pugn. loc. 191. fol. 211. and loc. 195. fol. 219. Spang. in
marga^ita theol. p. 116. 117.
Sarcerius, Althamerus, Spangburgius, al of them Protestant writers.

Concerning the Sacrament of Extreme unction; wherein is proved the same to be a
Sacrament: And used in the Primitive Church. CHAPTER. 10.
THough the Sacrament of Extreme unction be generally impugned by Protestants,
yet S. Austin with us teaches the same saying of the sick. Tom. 9. de
rectitudine Cathol. co^uersationis. post init.
Let him ask of the Church holy Oil wherewith his body may be anointed
according to the Apostle. James. 5. And again Tom. 10. ser. de temp. 215.
circa med. and see tom. 9. de visit. Infirm. l. 2. c. 4. initio. Origin, hom.
2. in Leuit. Prosper. de praedict. l. 2. c. 29. Chrisost. de Sacerd. l. 3. c. 6.
Let him anoint his body, that it may be fulfilled in him which is written, is
any man sick? Let him bring in the Preistes, and let them pray over him,
annoynting him with oil. But in further explication of S. Austines judgment,
Innocentius Bishop of Rome then living with S. Astine, upon more casual
occasion of a demand propounded to him, answeareth concerning the fore
mentioned saying of Ep. ad Eugubinum.
S. James, c. 5.14. without doubt (says he) it is to be understood of the
faithful being sick, who may be anointed whth the holy oil of Chrisme.
Affirming yet further concerning, not the ministering but the receiving thereof,
that Not only Preistes in their sickness, but also Laye-persons in theirs may
have the benefit and use thereof. This is so clear in Innocentius that Bale
says, Acta Romanorum Pontif. p. 31. and in his pageant of Popes. fol. 26.
Of the annoyling of the sick Innocentius haith made a Sacrament. Agreeably to
whom Speculum. pontif. p. 33.
Szegedin also writes that, Innocentius the 1. and Faelix the 4. have made a
Sacrament of the annoyling of the sick.

And for this very cause the epistle of S. James which the Fathers and we
allege in behalf of Extreme unction, is rejected by Luther in these words,
Tom. 2. Witteberg. de captiuit. Babylon. fol. 86.
But I say, if in any place it be foolishly written in this especially etc. but
if it were the epistle of James the Apostle, I would say that it were not
lawful for an Apostle by his own authority to institute a Sacrament etc. for
this belongs to Christ alone. And the self same is defended by De
Sacramentis. c. 7. p. 95.
Hunnius. Lastly the ancient practice of this Extreme unction was so
undoubted in the Primitive Church, that M. Whitaker confesses respectively
thereof saying, Contra Duraeum. l. 8, p. 650.
I acknowledge the superstitious custom of this annoyling to have remained
longer in the Church then was meet.

Concerning the Sacrament of Orders: wherein S. Austin teaches that they are
properly a Sacrament, given only by a Bishop, who haith authority to
excommunicate eue^ the dead: and that Preistes may not marry, or be one that
was Bigamus. CHAPTER. 11.
Saint Austin comparing Baptism with Order, and proving that Orders once
received cannot be lost no more then Baptism, gives for the reason hereof
that, Tom. 7. cent. epist. Parmen. l. 2. c. 13. ante med.
both are Sacraments, and both are given to man with certain consecrition,
that, when he is baptized, this, when he is ordained. And again, Ibidem. post
med. and see Tom. 7. de bapt. contra Don. l. 1. c. 1. circa med. And Tom. 6. de
bono coniugali. c. 24. ante med.
for if both be Sacraments, which no man doubts, why is not that lost and
this is? neither Sacrament is to be injured.

But S. Austin not only thus plainly acknowledges Orders to be a Sactament,
but withal reprehendeth (and as it were points at) the promiscuous tumultuary
parety and ordination now affected by the Puritan Clergy, saying of certain
heretics that Tom. 5. ex quaest. vet. et noui Testam. q. 110. ante med.
They trouble the Order begun by Peter the Apostle, and observed even until
this time by the continuance of Bishops succeeding one another, chalenging to
them selves Order without beginning, that is, professing a body without a head,
whereupon it is meet to call their Seathe chair of pestilence.

S. Austin likewise affirms Tom. 6. de haeresibus. haer. 53. de Arianis circa
med.
the equaling of Presbiters with Bishops to be the condemned error of the
Arians, in so much as Danaeus confesses that, De haeresibus. c. 53. fol. 175.
Epiphanius, Austin, and Isidore, have enrouled the Arians within the Catalogue
of heretics, in that they made the dignity of a Priest and a Bishop alike.
And the same is yet further confessed of Austin, and Epiphanius, by M. In his
2. reply. part. 1. p. 619.
Carthwright.

And whereas M. Whitaker affirms that Contra Duraeum. l. 9. p. 813.
Presbiters are named Preistes, not properly but improperly; S. Austin
expounding certain words of the Apocalip^ affirms to the contrary that,
Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 20. c. 10. post med.
They are not only understood of Bishops and Presbiters, who now in the Church
are properly called Preistes.

He further likewise teaches against the Puritans, the civil jurisdiction of
Bishops, whereof M. Whitguift concludes from sundry his sayings by him
alleged that, In his defense. tract. 23. p. 771. 772.
Austin hears civil cases, Austin a judge in worldly matters, Austin thinks
that the holy Ghost haith bound Bishops unto civil cases, to which purpose he
also produces other Fathers, who with S. Austin are further reprehended for
this very cause by In omnes Pauli epistolas, in 1. Cor. 6.4. p. 254.
Calvin.

S. Austin likewise mencioneth the Bishops blessing in these words, Tom. 5. de
ciuit. Dei. lib. 22. c. 8. ante med.
we rise and receiving the Bishops blessing departed. yea he reprehendeth the
Pelagians for impugning the same, saying, Tom. 2. ep. 90. ad Innocent. post
med. see Sozomen. hist. l. 8. c. 18. Chrisost. orat. 4. cont. Iudaeos. Conc. 3.
Aurelian. Can. 22. et Regiense. can. 4. et Agathen. c. 30. and Bode, hist. l.
5. c. 4. and 6.
by the contention of these Pelagians, our bl^ssing is contradicted, that so we
may be thought to speak in vain over the people.

He reserueth as peculiar to Bishops the Consecration of virgins, and Chrisme,
for in the third Council of Carthage (whereat S. Austin was present and
subscribed) it was decreed, Can. 36.
that a Priest should not consecrate Virgins without the advice of the Bishop,
and that he should never make (or hallow) Chrisme. And the like reservation of
Orders to be given only by a Bishop is defyned in the fourth Can. 3. and 4.
Carthage Council, and so confessed by D. Sermon at Lambeth. p. 40.
Downham.

S. Austin attributes the power of excommunication as appartayning (not as
Carthwright in his 2. reply. part. 2. p. 77. 78. etc.
Puritans think unto the Presbitery or Congregation but) to the Bishop, him
self to such purpose excommunicating Tom. 2. ep. 187. ad Bonif. fine.
Bonifacius, and thereupon affirms Tom. 7. de corrept. et gratia. c. 15.
the Episcopal judgment to be the greatest penalty in the Church: teaching
likewise that, Tom. 2. ep. 118. ad Ianuar. prope initium.
by the authority of the Bishop every one (offending) ought to be removed from
the Altar to do penance, and by the same authority reconcyled again. A point
so clear that D. Whitwhiguift proves from S. Austin the Carthage Councels and
others, that Defense. tract. 18. p. 676. 677.
the Bishop alone did excommunicate.

Yea S. Austin was so full herin, that he threatened excommunication in case of
desert, even to those that were dead, in these words, Tom. 2. ep. 50 ad Bonif.
post init.
If those things should be true which are objected by them against
Caecilianus, and could at any time be showed unto us, we would excommunicate
him even being dead: whereof also report the Centuristes that, Cent. 5. c. 6.
col. 666.
The severity of this discipline went so far, that it spared not the dead. So
Arsacius successor to Chrysostom was Excommunicated after his death etc. after
the same manner Austin says of Caecilianus, that he would excommunicate him
though he were dead, if those things could be proved which were objected
against him by the authorities, in ep. ad Bonifacium. 50. And according to this
Innocentius (living in the same age with S. Austin) says, In ep. ad Archadium.
We do excomunicate Arsacius even after his death whom you in steed of great
John brought into the Episcopal throne; And this is so certain that it is
recorded and acknowledged by the Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 663.
Centuristes. Now answearably to this practice of S. Austin in the Primitive
Church, the Catholic Church of latter times haith proceeded to take up and
burn the dead bodies of some condemned heretics, as of Wicclife, Bucer, and
others; which though by our adversaries it be tragicaly objected and amplifyed,
yet is it by them selves upon the like ground and occasion accordingly put in
practice, for Osiander reports that Cent. 16. l. 2. c. 4. p. 120. and l. 3.
c. 32. p. 673.
David George dying at Basil, some years after his death his heresy was laid
open, wherefore the senate of Basil commanded that his dead carcass should be
taken out of the grave, and should be burned by the executioner or hangman.

S. Austin likewise acknowledges the several orders or degrees of Deacons,
Subdeacons, Acolites, Exorcistes, etc. for these are not only al Can. 4.5.6.7.
named in the fourth Carthage Council, but also the very ceremonies yet
questionable and appertaining to these times are there appointed, as namely to
the Can. 5.
Subdeacon, the Patten, Chalice, Cruet full of water and towel for the Preistes
hands: to the Can. 6.
Acolite a waxen candle, that he may know him self appointed to lighten the
Church lights, and Can. 7. and see Aug. Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 10. c. 22.
initio. englished. p. 389.
for the Exorcist a book of Exorcismes. In so much as Osiander recyting the
several Canons hereof, condemns the^ for Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 4. and 5.
trifling and superstitious. And whereas Protestants pretend Exorcisme to be a
miraculous gift peculiar to the Churches beginning times, S. Austin to the
contrary places it among the other foresaid Ecclesiastical Orders; decreeing
yet further also to the contrary that Council. 4. Carth. can. 90.
The Exorcistes do daily impose hands upon those who are possessed; for which
he with that Canon is reproved by Osiander, saying, Cent. 4. l. 1. c. 1. p. 17.
It haith neither command nor promise in the Scripture.

S. Austin also teaches (to the dislik of our adversaries) that who so married
a widow, or had him self been twice married, should not be afterward made
Priest, for thus he writes, Tom. 6. de bono coniug. c. 18. prope init. And see
Tom. 3. de Eccles. dog. c. 92. and Concil^. 4. Carthag. can. 69.
Dispensatorem Ecclesia non licet ordinari etc. It is not lawful for a minister
of the Church to be ordained, unless he be the husband of one wife, which they
understood more subtly, who think that neither is he to be ordained, who
being a Catechumen, or a Pagan, haith had an other wife, for here is treated of
the Sacrament, not of sin, seeing in Baptism al sins are forgeuen etc. And
As the woman, though a Catechumen, if she be defloured, cannot after Baptism
be consecrated amongst the virgins of God, so it seems not absurd that he who
haith had more wines then one haith not committed any sin, but haith lost a
certain rule of the Sacrament, not necessary for the merit of good life, but
for the seal of Ecclesiastical ordination. This saying is so recyted,
confessed, and reprehended by De Poligamia. 213. 214.
Beza. And where the like is decreed of Bigamie being a let to Preisthood by
the 4. Carthage Council, Osiander condemns the said Council for Cent. 5. l.
1. c. 1. p. 14.
superstitious herein.

Lastly he teaches that Preistes may not marry; and so in the 2. Council of
Carthage it was thus decreed, Can. 2.
It haith pleased us to decree, that the sacred Bishops, and Preistes of God
etc. should be continent in all etc. that so what the Apostles have taught, and
antiquity it self haith observed, we keep; by all the Bishops it was said, it
pleased us al, that Bishops, Preistes, and Deacons, or such as handle the
Sacraments, kepers of chastity shall co^taine them selves even from their wives.
And the same is decreed in the third Can. 17. and 25.
Carthage Council, and for such acknowledged by Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 24. p. 526.
Osiander. As also by the 5. Carthage Council, where the African Fathers renew
the decree thereof, Can. 3.
secundum propria statuta, according to their own former decrees: In so much
as In ep. ad Romanos. p. 365.
Melancthon specially reprehendeth this first Council, and Osiander avouches
that, Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 33. p. 156. And see Aug. Tom. 6. de adulterinis coniug.
l. 2. c. 20. circa med. and Tom. 10. ad frattes in Eremo. ser. 37. and
Possidonius in vita August. c. 26.
It plainly fights with the doctrine of Paul.

Concerning the Sacrament of Matrimony taught by S. Austin: And that the
innocent party upon Adultery may not marry another; and of the Preistes
blessing after marriage. CHAPTER. 12.
THat marriage should be a sign of the conjunction of Christ with his Church,
is so inducing to prove it a Sacrament, that therefore such signification thereof
is deuyed by the Puritans, as M. In his 2. part of the answer c. 17. p. 112.
and p. 147. and see the survey of the book of common prayer p. 132.
Hutton relates who yet, alleges against them Chemnitius and the cenfession
of Wittenberge assenting to have marriage called a Sacrament.

Now S. Austin in this respect writes, Tom. 7. de nupt and concupis. l. 1. c.
10. initio.
A certain Sacrament of marriage is commended to the faithful that are
married, whereupon the Apostle says, husbands love your wives as Christ loved
the Church. This doctrine is so clear in S. Austin and the other Fathers, that
M. Fulke grants that In Rhem. test. in Ephesians. 5. 32. sec. 5.
Austin and some other of the ancient Fathers take it, that Matrimony is a
great mystery of the conjunction of Christ and his Church. yea S. Austin
expressly terms the marriage of Christians a Sacrament, saying, Tom. 7. de
nupt. and co^cupis. l. 1. c. 17. initio.
In marriage let the good things thereof be loved, Children, Faith, Sacrament
etc. A Sacrament which the husbands, separated and commiting adultery do not
loose. And, Tom. 6. de bono coniug. c. 24. init.
The good of marriage etc. for as much as concerns the people of God, is in
the sanctity of the Sacrament. As also, Ibidem. c. 18. post med.
In our marriages the sanctity of the Sacrament is of greater worth then the
fruictfulnes of the womb. And again, Tom. 4. de fide and oper. c. 7. prope
initium.
not only the bond of marriage, but also the Sacrament is so commended, that it
is not lawful for a husband to give his wife to another. In these and sundry
other such sayings S. Austin distinguishing the marriage of Christians, from
the marriage of the Gentiles, he makes our marriage a Sacrament not otherwise
then in respect of Christ and his Church, and their other marriage no
Sacrament, which argues that he used the word Sacrament properly.

It is likewise the doctrine of S. Austin, that in case of divorce upon
adultery, the innocent party may not marry again, for thus he writes Tom.
10. in l. 50. hom^l. hom. 49. post init.
By reason of only fornication it is lawful to dismiss a wife committing
adultery, but it is not lawful to marry another whiles she lives. And again,
Tom. 6. de adult. coniug. l. 1. c. 21. fin. and de bono coniug. c. 7. and de
adult. coniug. l. 1. c. 8. l. 2. c. 4. and 9. l. 11. c. 21. 22. 24.
He that dismisseth his wife except for fornication, causes her to commit
adultery, but if for this cause he dismiss her, let him so remain him self.
And agreeably to this, the Can. 17.
Milleuitan Council (whereat S. Austin was present) is so plain herein that it
is therefore reproved by Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 33. p. 151. Pelarg. in his disput
and ^^^^d to his schola ^^dei. fol. 5 (...)
Osiander, and Pelargus. Melancthon also acknowledgeing that, In ep. ad Romans in
c. 14. p. 367.
The Milleuitan Council, at which Austin was present etc. decreed concerning
divorce, that the innocent person should not marry again; whereof also say the
Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 519. etc. 10. col. 1133.
Centuristes, The opinion of Austin is, that it is not lawful for the innocent
party to marry another: for which also he is reprehended by Examen. part. 2. p.
263.
Chemnitius.

S. Austin further teaches and commends the vowed perpetual chastity by
mutual assent of married persons, for speaking of man and wife he says, Tom.
6. de bono coniug. c. 25. circa med. etc. 3. and Tom. 4. l. 1. de sermon. Domini
in monte. c. 14. Tom. 3. de fide ad Petrum. c. 3.
Let both know who with like consent haith vowed to God Chastity, that a
greater reward is truly due unto them. In which place and sundry other he is so
plain herein that the Century writers do object to him his opinion hereof,
tearming it, Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 518.
An opinion not agreeable to the word of God. But yet S. Austin is so full in
this point, that he persuades Armentarius and his wife to the accomplishment
of their vow in that behalf, writing unto them both, a special epistle Tom. 2.
ep. 45. init.
to that purpose; of which and such other like examples out of S. Austin, Peter
Martyr says, De Euchar. et vot. col. 1608. 1609.
These things brought out of Austin do not agree with the sacred Scriptures:
And, the man of God writes these things being deceived as man. And the like
reprehension is given to S. Austin, by De origin Monach. fol. 102. 105.
Hospinian.

Lastly, the blessing of the bridgroome and bride, by the Priest after marriage
made, is decreed by the 4. Carthage Council in these words, Can. 13.
The husband, and the wife, when they are to be bl^ssed by the Priest, and when
they have received the benediction, in reverence thereof let them remain the
same night in virginity. This Canon is reproved by Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 6.
Osiander, and confessed by the Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 453.
Centuristes.

Concerning free will, Justification, merit of works, works of superogation,
and the difference of mortal and venial sins. CHAPTER. 13.
S. Austin teaches that man haith free will. SECTION. 1.
THe Sacraments being thus ended, I will now proceed to other doctrines, and
first concerning freewil enhabled now in us, not by nature, but by grace;
wherein I find, as in the former points of faith, so likewise in this, S. Austin
most agreeable with our now Catholic Roman Church, for thus he teaches, that
Tom. 6. in actis cum Faelice Manich. l. 2. c. 4. circa med.
every man haith in his will, either to choose those things which are good, and
be a good tree, or to choose those those things which are evil, and be an evil
tree etc. This therefore our Lord saying, either do ye this, or do ye that,
shows that it is in their power what they should do. Again, Tom. 8. in Psalm.
7. prope fin.
He that made us would have it in our power not to consent to the devil: yea he
affirms that, Tom. 3. de spir. and lit. c. 34. post med.
It is in our will to consent to Gods calling, or to dissent from it: As also,
Tom. 2. ep. 47. Valentino. ante med.
I have dealt with yours and our brethren what I could, that they would
persevere in the sound Catholic faith, which neither denies freewil whether
to bad life or to good, neither attributes so much unto it as that without
grace it avails any thing. And for our performance of good he teaches that
Tom. 7. Hypog. l. 3. circa med.
God does (by his assisting grace) work and man (by his freewil) cooperate;
Saying also of the faithful person that, Tom. 9. in Euang. Joan. tract. 72.
versus finem.
Christ working in him he also works his own eternal salvation and
justification.

But in this point S. Austin is so confident, as that he doubts not to
condemn the Manichees of heresy for their denial of freewil: Tom. 6. de fide,
cont. Manich. c. 9. fin.
Against these things (says he) the Manichees bark with accustomed blindness,
and when they are convinced that nature is not evil, but (most pregnantly for
freewil in us) that it is in the power of man either to do well or evil, they
say that the soul haith no freewil, and do not see their own blindness. with
him agrees S. Hierome affirming that In proaemio librorum aduersus Pelagianos.
fine.
It is proper to the Manichees to condemn the nature of men and to take away
freewil and Gods assistance; for which error also they are condemned by S. In
Joan. hom. 45. prope initium.
Chrysostom: In all which places of these Fathers it is evident by the context
of the^, that the said Fathers condemned the Manichees as erroneous, not only
for their denial of freewil in Adam, (as Protestants pretend) but also for
their further denial thereof in us, as is likewise confessed by the Protestant
De universally gratia. p. 109.
Hemingius: And in this S. Austin labored so far as that he alleged a whole
composed Tom. 7. de great. et lib. arb. c. 2. troughout.
Tract of collected Scriptures (not peculiar to Adam, but such as concern us,
in further proof thereof. For which and sundry other his plain sayings in
proof of freewil he is acknowledged and disliked by the Cent. 5. c. 4. col.
500. 501.
Century writers.

Hence also it is, that S. Austin so utterly disclameth from the Protestants
supposed impossibility of keeping the commandments, as that he forbeareth not
to affirm, Tom. 7. de great. and lib. arb. c. 2. init.
that the commandments of God would not profit man unless he had freewil,
wherewith doing them etc. And again, Tom 6. de fide. cont. Manich. c. 10.
initio.
who will not cry out that it is a foolish thing to give commandments to him
who h^ith not freedom to do what is commanded, and that it is injury to
cond^me him, who had not powwer to fulfill the commandments. This is so
clear in S. Austin, that Melancthon says thereof, Lib. 1. epist. p. 290.
Austin haith not sufficiently explicated the justification of faith etc. which
thou shall rightly understand, if thou do cast away thine eye wholly from the
law, and from Austines immagination of fulfilling the law.

Yea S. Austin doubts not to give direct sentence against our adversaries
concerning Genesis. c. 4. v. 7. referring Caines dominion there expressed, not
as intended to Abel, (as Protestants do of late translate) but to sin, saying
thereof, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 15. c. 7. circa med.
Thou shall have dominion over it, what, of thy brother? God forbid, of what
then but sin? whereto assenteth his familiar S. Hierome, saying likewise
thereof, In quaest. in Genes.
because thou have freewil, I do admonish thee, that sin have not dominion
over thee, but thou over sin. And the very same reading is affirmed and made
good by diverse learned Protestants, as namely In his great Bible in Genesis 4.7.
Mercerus upon Genesis. in Genesis 4 7. Pezel. in Genes. c. 4. p. 94. Gesnerus, in
Genesis p. 114.
Castalio, Mercerus, Pezelius, and Gesnerus, who special^y recyteth and
answeareth our adversaries usual objections to the contrary. Yea the agreeable
translation hereto is accordingly observed by the great English Bible of Anno.
1577. and by the english Bible in 4. of Anno. 1584.

And whereas Protestants usually object S. Chrysostom to expound this place
according to their mind; the truth is, he gives both expositions saying
thereupon, In Genes. hom. 18.
I have delivered both senses, leaving to your wisdom that to be chosen which
seems more agreeable to that which haith been said: yea he infers and
collecteth from this very place the freedom of will saying, In Genes. hom. 19.
c. 4. prope initium.
The Lord of al things haith made our nature to have freewil etc. he suffers
al to lie in the will of him that is sick, this therefore is now also done in
Cain.

To al which (in more clear explication of S. Austines judgment) I will ad the
further answearable consenting doctrine delivered by S. Hierome and the Fathers
of the Arausican Council, which was celebrated in the age of S. Austin. and
against the Pelagians who too much inhabled freewil as of it self sufficient
without grace: wherefore S. Hierome says to the Pelagian Dial. 3. aduers.
Pelag.
This is that which I told thee in the beginning, that it is in our power to
sin or not to sin, that freewil may be kept. The foresaid Council also
says, (y) This also we believe according to the Catholic faith, that grace
being received by Baptism, al who are baptized through Christ's help and
cooperation may and ought to fulfill such things as belong to salvation, if
they will labor faithfully.

S. Austin techeth that our justification consists not only in remission of
sins, or not imputation thereof, but likewise in good wo^kes: and that the
same once had may be lost. SECTION. 2.
HOfman, with other Protestants, teaches that, Comment. de paenit. l. 2. fol.
114.
The justice wherewith we are saved etc. consists wholly in remission of our
sins, or as Viril says, Compendium Christian. relig. l. 1. c. 4. fol. 17.
in imputation, both which Volumen These. theol. vol. 1. loc. 15. p. 256.
Piscator makes al one. But S. Austin teaches to the contrary that, Tom. 2.
ep. 106. Bonif. post init.
The grace of God etc. brings to the life of the second man, not only by
blotting out sins, but also by helping not to sin. As also Tom. 2. ep. 105.
ad Sixtum. post med.
neither etc. is any man freed and justified but by the grace of God etc. not
only by remission of sins, but first by the inspiration of faith it ^efle,
and the fear of God etc. Again, Tom. 7. de natura and great. c. 26. post init.
Our heavenly Physician does to this end only cure our diseases that now they
be not, but that hereafter we may walk rightly. And the Milleuitan Council
(whereat S. Austin was present and subscribed) decreed that, Can. 3.
whosoever shall say, that the grace of God wherewith we are justified etc. does
avail only to the remissio of sins etc. let him be accursed. Yea S. Austin
is so plain herein, as that Calvin mantaining imputative justice by only
faith, and as secluding works therein, reproves S. Austins contrary doctrine
saying thereof, In omnes Pauli epist. ep. ad Romans c. 3.21. p. 35.
I am not ignorant that Austin expounds otherwise etc. I know over well, that
certain new spyers do produce very proudly this doctrine of Austin.

And whereas Protestants usually object S. Paul as contrary to S. James
concerning Justification by works. D. Whitaker confesses that S. Austin
agreeably with us Catholics does reconcile them together saying, Resp. ad
rat. Camp. rat. 1. p. 12. and see the Centuristes. Cent. 5. c. 10. col. 1133.
and see Aug. quaest. 83. quaest. 76.
Austin reconcyleth James to Paul, wherefore (says Austin) the sentences of
the two Apostles Paul, and James are not contrary in them selves etc. because
Paul speaks of works which go before faith (unto which never Catholic
attributed justification) and James of those works that follow faith, (which
is the very point that Catholics now teach concerning justification by works.

Now that this justification by faith and works once had may be lost, it is
likewise taught by S. Austin saying, Tom. 7. de praedestinatione Sanctorum. c.
14. post init.
why is it granted to some that they be taken out of the dangers of this life
while they are just, and others that are just do live longer in the same
dangers until they fall from justice? who knows the sense of our Lord? And
again, Tom. 7. de correp. et. great. c. 13. post init.
Let al fear who run well, it being unknown who shall come (to the mark:)
Therefore by reason of the profit of this secrecy, it is to be believed that
some of the sons of perdition, not receiving the gift of perseverance unto
the end, do begin to live in faith which works by charity, and for a time do
live faithfully and justly, and afterward do fall, neither do they dye before
this happen unto them.

And from this vncertanty of perseverance S. Austin likewise advises that,
Ibidem.
none of the multitude of the faithful, as long as they live in this mortality,
presume them selves to be in the number of the predestinate, because it is
needful that that be hid in this place (or life;) which truth is further
confirmed and depending of this his other doctrine that, No man can be certain
of his own final perseverance. And so speaking of the just he affirms (even
according to our adversaries english translation) that Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei.
l. 11. c. 12. circa med. And according to the english translation. p. 419.
these though they be assured of their reward for their perseverance, yet are
they not sure to persevere (or rather according to the Latin they are
uncertain of their perseueranc^) for what man knows that he shall continue to
the end in action and increase of justice, unless he have it by revelation?
And the good of this vncertanty he avouches saying, Tom. 2. ep. 107. ad
Vitalem circa med.
it is profitable to al or most for their sound humility, that they may not
know what hereafter they are to be, to this end it is said, he that seems to
stand, let him take heed lest he fall.

S. Austin teaches that good works do merit; and that there are works of
supererrogation. SECTION. 3.
THat good works do merit remission of sins and life eternal, it is clearly
taught by S. Austin saying. Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 70. circa med.
By alms God is to be pacifyed for sins past. And Tom. 8. in Psalm. 37. fin.
Let alms be given, sins redeemed. As also, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Deind. 21. c.
27. multo ante med.
Our Lord shows how much alms avail for the blotting out of sins past.
And he demands saying, Tom. 2. ep. 105. ad Sixtu^. multo ante med. And see
Tom. 2. ep. 52. 46. 47. and Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 106. 107. et tom. 7. de not.
et great. c. 2.
Are there no merits of the just? there are truly, because they are just etc.
yea he further avouches that, As to the demerit of sin death is given as
wage, so to the merit of justice as wage life eternal.

He proceeds also further teaching the diverse degrees of merits in these
words, Tom. 9. in Euang. Joan. tract. 67. circa med.
Many mansions do signify the different (degrees or) dignities of merits in one
life eternal. And Tom. 6. de sancta virgin. c. 26. circa med. and tom. 5. de
ciuit. dei. l. 22. c. 30.
One star differs from another in glory etc. these are the diverse merits of
saints. But in this he is so full that the contrary error he condemns in
Iouinian: We condeme (says Tom. 10. de tempore, ser. 191. prope fin. and tom.
6. haer. 82. tom. 1. l. 2. retract. c. ^2.
he) the error of Iouinian, who affirms no difference of merits in the world
to come: hereof also say the Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 518. and see Chemnit. exam.
part. 4. p. 110. 142. And see Wotton in defense of Parkins. p. 500.
Centuristes, It appears that Austin was of that opinion, that virgins
dedicated to holiness have more merit with God then the faithful that are
married, for because Iouinian thought the contrary, that they had no more
merits, this in him reprehendeth Austin. l. 3. de pec. mer.

He likewise further teaches by the example of Moses preualing for the
Israelites, Tom. 4. super Exodum. quaest. 149. post med.
that we should be admonished, that when our own merits do hold us down that
we be not loved of God, that we may be helped with him by the merits of them
whom God loves. In so much that he further auocheth that, Tom. 6. cont.
Faustum. l. 20. c. 21. post init. and tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 21. c. 27. post
med.
Christian people do celebrate with religious solemnity the memories of martyrs
etc. that they may be partakers of their merits, and helped with their prayers.
yea be encorageth us to do good in hope or expectation of reward, for thus he
writes, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 120. post med.
when thou do a good work, do it for life eternal etc. do it not but for
life eternal, if therefore thou do it, thou do it securely, for this God
haith commanded.

And as for works of supererrogation or Christian perfection, that is, that a
man may do more then he is commanded to do, S. Austin speaking of
Commandments and Councels, and alluding to Luke, 10.35. says, Tom 6. de
sancta virgin. c. 30. circa med.
Those things are exacted these are offered, if these be done, they are
commended, if those be not done they are condemned, in those our Lord
commands what is debt, but in these if ye shall any thing supererrogate, at
his return he will repay you. And again Tom. 10. de temp. sermon. 61. circa med.
One thing is counsel, another command, etc, he that willingly hears counsel
and does it shall have greater glory, he that fulfilleth not the cammaundement,
unless he repent, cannot escape punishment. To this purpose he also cyteth
those words of S. Paul to the Tom. 7. Hypognost. l. 3. c. 8. multo post med.
Corinthians, Of virgins I have no commandment of our Lord, but I give
counsel. And in further example hereof the Protestant writer M. Upon Jude. p.
226. and see Aug. tom. 2. ep. 89. versus finem.
Trig says, S. Austin counting it a degree of perfection in Christianity not
to seek after the riches of the world, thus writes of himself: I who write
these things have loved that perfection, whereof our Lord spoke to the young
man, go and sell al thou have, how far I have gone forward in this way of
perfection I know more then any other etc. and to this purpose with all my might
I exhort others, and etc. have companions to whom this is persuaded by my
ministry. But to conclude this doctrine of works of supererrogation is so
true and clear, that it is therefore assented unto by M. Eccles. pol. l. 3.
sec. 8. p. 140. and l. 2. p. 103. 122.
Hooker, and D. Defense of Hooker. art. 8. p. 49. 50. 51. 52.
Couel.

Lastly S. Austin is so plainly agreeing with us and dissenting from
Protestants in these questions of justification and merits of works, as that
he is therefore reproved by sundry Protestant wri^ers. Austin sometime (says
Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 23. p. 520.
Osiander) in the article of iustifi^ation seems to attribute over much to
the merits of good works which are done after a man's conversion. The
Centuristes likewise say, Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 507.
Austin sometimes gives over much to good works. Brentius In confess.
Wittenberg. and see Melancthon. l. 1. epist. p. 290. and in Council. theol. p.
240. Calvin institut. l. 3. c. 11. sec. 15.
affirms that, S. Austin taught affiance in man's merits toward remission of
sin. The divines of Wittenberge charge S. Austin for his teaching (say
English harmony of confessions. sec. 16. c. 25. p. 509.
they) that we obtain remission of our sins and life, not only for Christ
his sake through faith, but also for the merit of our works. Melancthon
writes that, In colloquio Altembe^g. fol. 307.
we are just not only by faith, but by all guiftes and virtues, and this truly
is Austines mind: yea he preuenteth the objection of S. Austin sometimes
mencioning only faith, saying, Ibidem. fol. 308.
with Austin only faith only excludes works going before (faith.)

S. Austin teaches that mortal and venial sins do differ of their own
natures. SECTION. 4.
COncerning the distinction of mortal and venial sin; the difference whereof
aryseth, according to the Protestants opinion, not from the diversity of the
sins in them selves, but of the parties committing them, so as to their
faithful professors (if we will believe Institut. l. 3. c. 4. sec. 28. Fulke
against Rhem. Test. in ep. Iean. sec. 5. fol. 447.
Calvin, Fulke, and others) al sins are venial, and unto others as Willet
sinopsis. p. 560.
Papists, al sins are mortal. yet S. Austin teaches the contrary, sometimes
(says Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 22. post med.
he) we lie for the good of others, a sin therefore it is, but venial. And,
Tom. 7. cont. duas ep. Pelag. l. 3. c. 3. post init.
Al sins do not make us the sons of the devil. yea he recyteth, Tom. 10. de
sanctis. sermon. 41. post init. And Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 78. 79.
quae sunt minuta peccata, which are little sins as for example, as often as a
man eats and drinks more then is necessary, or speaks more then is meet,
or is more silent then is expedient, with a number more such like. In so much
that Peter Martyr writes that Common places. part. 3. c. 4. sec. 81. p. 153.
S. Austin in his books de spir. et lit. c. 28. says, even as there are
certain venial sins without which every just man cannot live, and yet they
hinder us not from salvation, so are there etc. And as for these venial sins,
S. Austin thinks that the saying of our Lords prayer is expiatory for them,
for thus he writes, There Tom. 9. de symbolo ad Catechum. l. 1. c. 7. circa
med.
are venial sins without which this life is not etc. for little sins,
without which we cannot be, prayer is invented, what haith prayer? forgive us
our debtes etc. if their sins were small ones, this daily prayer would
suffice to blot them out. In like sort Tom. 4. de vera et fall. paenit. c. 4.
propefin.
There are certain venial sins which are daily loosed by our Lords prayer
etc. but others which are to death, are not so loosed, but by the fruictes of
penance. Again, Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 71
for daily, short, and light sins without which this life is not spent, the
daily prayer of the faithful satisfyeth. And he expressly makes difference
between Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 21. c. 27. and in the Eng. trans. p. 871.
872.
sin, and crime, between great sins and small sins; affirming withal
that this which he speaks of our Lords prayer concerns small sins only.
To which purpose he is further alleged by the 4. Tolletane Can. 9.
Council. As lastly that S. Austin doubts not to affirm that, Tom. 4. de
vera et fall. paenit. c. 20. et vlt. post init.
venial sins were always forgeuen by ceremonies. Now this doctrine of the
difference of mortal and venial sins is so clear a truth that with S. Austin
and us it is likewise taught and defended by Loc. com. part. 3. in his Thesis
thereto annexed. fol. 24. Melancth. in council. Euang. p. 546. Musculus. loc.
com. p. 29. The harmony of confessions. p. 81.
Chemnitius, Melancthon, and other Protestant writers.

Concerning prayer for the dead, Purgatory, material fire in hell, Lymbus
Patrum, invocation of Saints, their worship, and Images. CHAPTER. 14.
S. Austin teaches that it is lawful and godly to pray for the dead; and that
there is a place of Purgatory after this life. SECTION. I.
COncerning prayer for the dead, S. Austin was so wholly Catholic, as that
without altergiuersation or staggering he spares not to write that, Tom. 10.
de verbis Apostoli. sermon. 32. c. 2. initio.
It is not to be doubted but that the dead are helped by the prayers of the
holy Church, and by the wholesome sacrifice and alms which are given for their
souls, that our Lord may deal more mercifully with them then their sins
have deserved; for the universal Church observes this as delivered from their
forefathers, that those should be prayed for, and the sacrifice remembered to be
offered for them, who dye in the communion of the body and blood of Christ,
when they are remembered in their place at the time of the sacrifice etc. It is
not to be doubted, but that these things do profit the dead, but such, who
have so lived before their death, that these things may be profitable to them
after their death: for such as dye without faith, which works by charity, and
the Sacraments, in vain are these works of pity bestowed upon them by their
friends etc, Therefore no new merits are obtained for the dead, when their
friends do any good for them, but their own merits going before, these are
made to follow. Yea his advise is that, as for such things which help the
souls of the dead, as sacrifices, prayers, alms, they bestow upon those more
diligently, instantly, abundantly, who being dead in flesh not in spirit, they
love not only carnally but spiritually. Again, Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 110.
initio.
there is one so good that these things he needs not, and again, another so
evil that neither can he be helped with these when he dies etc. therefore they
profit not al men etc. when then the sacrifice of the Altar, or of any Alms
are offered for all the dead that are baptized, for those that are very good
they are thanksgeuinges, for those that are not very evil they are
propitiatio^s, or sacrifices satisfying Gods justice. Also, Tom. 4. de cura pro
mortuis. c. 18. init.
they profit not al for whom they are done, but those only who while they
lived deserved that they profit them, but because we know not who those are, we
ought to do them for all the regenerate. Now whereas D. Morton and other
Protestants do vulgarly object that S. Austin prayed for his mother Monica,
whom yet he thought to be in heaven, and that the like was done by other
Fathers for those who undoubtedly were also in heaven; this S. Austin for him
self and the other Fathers haith answered and explained in the precedent
words, affirming that for such as were very good, or in heaven, prayers were
thankesgeuinges, and for those who were not very evil, or in hell, they were
propitiations, or satisfactions. Yea S. Austin is so Roman Catholic, as that
M. Fulke avouches that, Confut. of Purg. p. 349.
Austin defended prayer for the dead, and that, Ibidem. p. 326.
it was the common error of his time: for which also he is acknowledged and
reproved by Tract. theol. p. 394. Bulling. de origigine erroris. c. 9. fol. 223.
Calvin, and Bullinger.

In like sort concerning Purgatory or temporal punishment after this life, S.
Austin affirms expressly that, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 21. c. 13. ^ane. and
after the eng. translation. l. 21. c. 16. p. 857. and l. 21. c. 21. p. 860. and
l. 21. c. 24. p. 863.
some suffer temporal punishments only in this life, others after death, some
in both; and that there are Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 20. c. 25. ante med.
certain Purgatory pains for certain persons hereafter: In so much that D.
Fulke acknowledges that Confut. of Purgat. p. 110.
Austin de ciuit. Dei. l. 21. c. 13. concludes very clearly that some suffer
temporal pains after this life, this may not be denied. And that, Ibidem. p.
78.
Austin speaks indeed of the amending fire, but had no ground of that fire,
but in the common error of his time.

S. Austin teaches local hell, and material fire therein: As also Limbus Patrum,
or Christ's descending into hell. SECTION. 2.
COncerning local hell, and that the material fire thereof punishes the wicked
spirits and souls of men; whereas M. Jacob says, In Bilsons survey of Christ's
sufferinges p. 43.
You set your self to prove that in hell there is material fire etc. you call it
true fire which we utterly deny. And Ibidem. p. 46.
The Scripture show no more any corporal or material, or true fire in hell, then
a corporal worm, material brimstone etc. which are only so termed
metaphorically. yet S. Austin to the contrary affirms that, De ciu. Dei. l.
21. c. 10.
incorporeal spirits may be strange yet true means be tormented with the
punishment of corporal fire: In so much as D. Bilson confesses that In his
survey. p. 44.
S. Austin long since haith plainly resolved, that the fire of hell is not only
a true fire, but a corporal fire, that shall punish both men and devils;
auoching yet further this to be a doctrine received by the Fathers of al ages
in Christ's Church. Amongst whom S. Hierome condemns Origin for teaching this
error that, Ad Auitum. And see Bilsons survey. p. 51.
The fire of hell etc. does not torment, but the conscience of sinners. And yet
Danaeus is content to be condemned for an heretic with Origin in defending
that, Resp. ad Bellar. disput. part. altera. ad. 6. controu. p. 1227.
The word fire is taken in the holy Scripture Metaphorically and tropically,
not properly. As also D. Reynoldes mantaining that, Censura librorum
Apocriphorum, in his title of lecture. 51. 52. 53. 54. 56. 57.
the fire of hell is not material, nor burns souls corporally; with whom also
agrees Institut. l. 3. c. 25. parag. 1^.
Calvin. Lastly S. Austin is so clear herein, that Danaeus being to answer
his testimony objected by Bellarmine, haith no other refuge left him, but
barely to say that, In re^pons. vbi supra. p. 1327.
the authority of Austin here is none, or of no worth.

So likewise concerning Limbus Patrum, or Christ's descending into hell, S.
Austin teaches that, Tom. 10. de tempore. ser. 137. prope init.
Christ laid his flesh in the monument, and his soul accompaning him he
descended to hell, whereby the elect, who though they were in the bosom of
tranquillity, yet being detained within the gates of hell, are brought again to
the pleasures of Paradise: neither was this the private opinion of S. Austin,
for he further auocheth that, Tom. 2. ep. 99. ad Euodium. multo ante med.
almost the whole Church agrees concerning the first man (Adam) that Christ
loosed him (from hell.) To which purpose D. Bilson Survey. p. 598.
particularly alleges S. Austin.

S. Austin teaches that Saints are to be inuocated, and worshipped: As also
their relics to be reverenced. SECTION. 3.
COncerning invocation of Saints, S. Austin is so fully agreeing with us,
that him self doubts not to pray unto S. Ciprian, being long before
martyred, saying, Tom. 7. de Baptismo. contra Don. l. 7. c. 1. and see l. 5. c.
17.
Let him help us with his prayers etc. that our Lord granting, we may
immitate his goodness, as much as we are able* yea he reports in proof hereof
this strange miracle, Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 12. c. 8. circ. med. and in the
english translation. p. 886.
One Florentius (says he) here of Hippo, a poor old man lost his upper
garment, and being unable to buy an other, he came to the shrine of the 20.
Martyrs, and prayed aloud unto them to help him to rayments etc. at his
departure he espied a great fish newly cast up by the sea etc. and cutting the
fish he found in the belly thereof a ring of gold. And in this doctrine S.
Austin is so clear, that Chemnitius relating his former prayer to S. Ciprian
affirms that, Examen. part. 3. p. 211.
Austin did this without Scripture, yealding to the time and custom: So
general was the custom of praying to the Saints in the time of S. Austin;
for which he is also further reprehended by other The Centuristes. Cent. 5. c.
6. col. 674. Lectius. in praescript. theol. l. 2. p. 174. 277. 280.
Protestants; M. Fulke not forbearing also to acknowledge and say, Reioynder to
Bristow. p. 5.
I confess that Ambrose, Austin, and Hierome, held invocation of Saints to
be lawful.

In like sort, in proof that Saints may be worshipped, he writes thus of
martyrs, Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 8. c. 27. init.
we honor their memories as of holy men of God. And, Ibidem. l. 20. c. 21.
ante med.
we worship Martyrs with that worship of love etc. but with that worship which
in gre^ke is called Latria (or which is proper only to God) we neither worship
them nor teach them to be worshipped. Yea S. Austin is reproved for using our
now usual distinction of Dulia, and Latria, by Hospinian saying, De Templis. p.
207.
Blessed Austin first invented this distinction of Dulia and Latria, and
amongst religious worshipes he thus distinguished, that, that which is due
only to God, he calls Latria, and that he names Dulia which is lawful to
give unto creatures. And to this purpose he alleges sundry sayings of S.
Austin.

But S. Aust. also approves the feasts celebrated in honor of Saints
saying, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 63. initio.
Having this day the feast of the passion (or death) of holy Martyrs etc. As
also, In Psalm. 88. con. 2. and see Council. 3. Carthag. can. 47.
The martyrs, whose birth d^yes we celebrate, said etc. yea Chemnitius
alleges S. Austin to say, Examen. part. 2. p. 176. and see Aug. tom. 6.
contra Faustum. l. 20. c. 21. post init.
Christian people do celebrate together the memories, of martyrs with religious
solemnity. Furthermore concerning the honoring of the Relics of Saints, the
5. Carthage Council (whereat S. Austin was present) decreed thus, Can. 14.
It pleases us that Altars which are errected in the feildes and high ways,
as the memories of martyrs, in which no body or relics of martyrs placed, are
approved by the Bishops etc. be cast dowen. This Canon Osiander terms Cent.
5. l. 1. c. 33. p. 158.
a foolish and grossly superstitious constitution, Austin being either present
or approving it. And the like dislike of this Canon is to be seen in the Cent.
5. col. 697.
Century writers. But S. Austin him self further says, Tom. 2. ep. 103. ad
Quintianum fine.
They carry the relics etc. of Stephen the martyr, which your holiness knows
how fitly you ought to honor as we have done. And, Tom. 3. de Eccles. dog. c.
73. initio*
we believe that the relics of martyrs are most sincerely to be honored as
the members of Christ etc. if any impugn this opinion, he is not to be thought
a Christian, but an Eunomian, and Vigilantian. This point of doctrine was so
received in that age of S. Austin as that Osiander faith of S. Hierome (who was
familiar with S. Austin) that, Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 19. p. 506.
He foolishly contended, that the relics of Saints were to be worshipped.
And the Centuristes recyte the very words Cent. 4. c. 10. col. 1250. and col.
602.
of S. Hierome concerning the worship of Relics as also of Vigilantius
obiecting to Catholics their then usual honoring of relics: The doctrine
whereof S. Hierome reports to have been the received doctrine in his time (to
use his own Lib. contra Vigil. c. 3.
words Non vnius vrbis, sed totius orbis, not of one City, but of the whole
world. yea they were as then so religiously esteemed, as that, Tom. 2. ep. 137.
multo ante med. And see tom. 3. de Eccles. dog. c. 73.
Pilgrimages were made unto the places of their abode.

Lastly whereas Faustus the Manithee charged Christians in their honoring of
martyrs to have made them Idols, even as White in his way to the true Church.
p. 220.
Protestants do now charge us Catholics for worshipping of Saints, S. Austin
thinks so unworthily and so basely of this objection, as that he says
thereof, Tom. 6. cont. Faust. Manich. l. 20. c. 21. initio. And see c. 4. and
tom. 2. ep. 43.
It does not move me so much as to answer this calumnis etc.

S. Austin teaches that it is lawful to use and worship the Images of Christ
and his Saints. SECTION. 4.
ALthough occasion to entreat of Images was not so ministered to S. Austin as
of other things, yet he leaves us not without al testimony thereof, but
indeed affirms that it was usual and frequent in his time to have the
pictures of Christ and his Saints: for upon occasion of certain Pagans
devised forgeries against Christ, and Peter, and Paul, S. Austin coniecturing
why they named therein those two Apostles rather the^ the other, says, Tom. 4.
de consensu Evangelist. l. 1. c. 10. circa med.
I think it was because they had seen in many places them pictured together
with him, to wit, Christ: And which argues him to speak of Christian
countries, he adds immediately next after (as in reason of being so painted
together with Christ) because Rome does more famously and solemnly celebrarte
the merits of Peter, and Paul, even for the same day of their sufferinges.

And as concerning the division of the ten Commandments into the first and
second table, S. Austin (directly to the contrary of our adversaries pretended
argument against Images) differs from them, therein Tom. 4. quaestionum in
Exodus l. 2. q. 21. post init.
affirming this part of the commandment. Thou shall not make to thy self any
graven thing, not to be a several distinct precept of it self, but parcel of
(and therefore explained by) this former, Thou shall not have strange Gods.
Herein he writes so largely, and his judgment is so confessed, that Musculus
speaking of Catholics says, Loc. com. de Decalogo. p. 39.
They divide the precepts of the first table into three, and of the second into
seven, and so they leave out the commandment concerning Images and graven
things etc. following Austin who l. 2. quaest. super Exodum. c. 71, etc.
appoints three precepts to the first table, and the other seven to the
second. And then as pretending most unworthily, S. Austin to be herein contrary
to him self, he further says, But the same Austin plainly differs from him
self etc. again if the authority please, why does it not please in that which
he writes agreeably with the rest of the more ancient (Fathers) rather then
in that which he write differently from others and him self; but it agreed
better to the time wherein graven things and Images were brought into the
Church of Christ. Willet likewise for this very cause reproves S. Austin
saying, Comment. upon Exodus in c. 20. p. 515.
As for the reasons of the contrary opinion, they are of no value, Austin would
have but three precepts in the first table. And again, Ibidem. p. 314.
The Romanistes opinion is, that there are but three commandments in the
first table, putting the two first into one etc, of this opinion is Austin
quaest. 71. in Exodus

And as by the premises S. Austin includes the lawfulnes of sacred Images, so
withal he confessedly teaches (which in direct terms extends it self to
the Numeri. 21. 8.
brazen serpent, and the Images of Exodus 25.18.
Cherubins, appointed by God him self) this our Catholic principle, that,
Tom. 3. de doctrina Christ. l. 3. c. 9. initio.
The honor given unto profitable signs appointed by God (as being in it self
lawful) passes from them to the thing signified. To which purpose Hospinian
affirming that Sacraments may as signs be honored, says (even as we say of
Hist. sacram. part. 1. l 5. c. 8. p. 477.
Images) that honor stays not in them, but passes from them to the things
which are signified. In proof of which opinion, he also alleges S. Austin
saying, Those things which Austin writ, de doctrina Christiana. l. 3. c. 9. do
agree with these, who adoreth (says he) a profitable sign appointed by God,
whose power and signification he understands, does not honor that which is
seen and passes, but rather that whereunto al such things are to be referred.
This place is so pregnant, as that it is therefore alleged to the same purpose
by Defens. de Euchar. loc. 1. col. 382.
Peter Martyr.

Ad lastly thereunto that the Lutheranes have still Images in their Churches, as
witnesses Defense of the English tra^slat. of the Bible. c. 3. p. 119.
M. Fulke, and are therein defended by diverse Caluinistes, as namely D.
Answer to certain object. p. 83. and 53. Tuch. Antidot. p. 92. Bucer, in
Centuria. ep. theol. p. 270. Pet Mart. and Melanc. in Polmerus. de Imaginibus.

Fotherby, M, Tuchborne, Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Melancthon.

Concerning Christian fastes, as abstinence from certain meats upon certain
days: As also concerning vowed chastity and monastical life. CHAPTER. 15.
S, Austin teaches that prescribed days of fasting, and abstinence ^ from
certain meats are lawful. SETION, 1.
FIrst as concerning the fast of Lent, S. Austin teaches that, Tom. 10. de
tempore. ser. 77. init. and ser. 62.
not to keep it at al is sacrilege, and in part to break it is sin: This
doctrine is confessed and disliked in S. Austin by the Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 686.
687.
Centuristes, and De tradit. Apost. part. 3. l. 3. col. 824.
Hamelmannus; and it is further explained by S. Ambrose, whose disciple S.
Aust. was, as the same Ibidem. col. 786.
Hamelmannus testifyeth: and of whom Oecolampadius says, How Epist. Oecol. and
Suing. p. 608.
should Austin teach contrary to Ambrose by whom he was ordered! Now it is
evident that S. Ambrose expressly affirms that Ser. 25. 34. 36.
It is sin not to fast in Lent; wherein he is confessed and reproved by M. In
Whitguiftes def. p. 100.
Carthwright, who also says of them both 2. Reply part. 1. p. 83.
Ambrose and Austin were both of them corrupt in Lent fast: for which also S.
Ambrose is at large reprehended by De tradit. Apost. col. 788.
Hamelmannus.

In like sort concerning the then usual fast of Wednesday, friday, and
Saturday, S, Austin says, Tom. 1. ep. 86. ad Casulanum. mult. ante med.
The Christian who accustometh to fast Wednesday, friday, and Saturday, etc.
This saying also is acknowledged by the Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 730. 686.
Centuristes.

But S. Austin proceeds yet further condemning the contrary opinion of
Protestants in the heretic Aerius, saying of him, Tom. 6. haer. 53. init.
It is reported that he haith added some opinions of his own, saying that we
ought not to pray or offer sacrifice for the dead, and that appointed fastes
are not solemnly to be kept. In which his censure he is acknowledged and
disliked by De haeres. c. 53. fol. 177. Fulke in his answ. to a cou^ter. Cath.
p. 44. 45. Osiand. cent. 4. l. 3. c. 47. p. 434.
Danaeus, Fulke, and Osiander: And yet the same censure is given against Aerius
for the greek Church by S. Haeres. 75.
Epiphanius.

And whereas the Puritans, as M. Welsh, one of them confesses, Reply against
Brown. p. 196.
say, we think it no heresy to fast on the Lords day, more then other days.
yet S. Austin avouches that, Tom. 2. ep. 86. ad Casulanum.
To fast on the Lords day is a great scandale, yea a scandal of the whole
Church. In which he is confessed and alleged by M. Defense. p. 102.
Whitguift and the Cent. 4. col. 445. 401.
Centuristes, and both he and S. Ambrose by De tradit. Apost. part. 3. l. 3.
col. 786. 787.
Hamelmannus, and the 4. Can. 64.
Carthage Council for decreeing the same doctrine is reproved by Cent. 5. p. 13.
Osiander.

In like manner concerning abstinence from certain meats, S. Austin reports
of his time that Tom. 6. cont. Faust. Manich. l. 30. c. 5. post init. see Tom.
1. de moribus Eccles. c. 31.
Catholics etc. do abstain, not only from flesh, but also from certain
fruictes of the earth, not that they think them unclean etc. And, almost al
in Lent observe this abstinence; which also may yet more appear by Faustus the
heretic Manichee, who in defense of his own wicked perpetual abstinence from
certain meats, as of their own nature unclean, signifies the Churches then
Catholic custom, in his obiecting thereof and saying to S. Austin, Aug. Tom.
6. cont. Faust. Manich. l. 30. c. 4. post init.
If Lent be observed by you without wine and flesh not superstitiously but by
Gods law etc. yea in this S. Austin was so full that he censured and condemned
Iouinian for his contrary doctrine: whereof says Exam. part. 4. p. 142. and see
Aug. tom. 6. haer. 82. circa med.
Chemnitius, Austin affirms Iouinian to have taught, fastes or abstinence
from certain meats to profit nothing. Of which also S. Austin says him
self, Tom. 3. de Eccles. dog. c. 68. init. and see the Centur. cent. 4. c. 5.
col. 381.
to believe that no merit increases to those that abstain from wine or flesh,
is not the part of a Christian, but of a Iouinian, or nouel Protestant; amongst
whom 3. part of his defense of the reform. Cath. p. 60. Will. in Antilogie. p.
13. Dan. in 1. part. alt. part. p. 938.
D. Abbot, Willet, and Danaeus, are not ashamed to defend Iouinian in his
foresaid error.

S. Austin teaches that the vow of chastity is lawful. SECTION. 2.
TO omit that S. Austin affirms it to be Tom. 1. l. 2. Retract. c. 22. initio.
the heresy of Iouinian to equal the merit of wives with virgins; he taught (as
before) the lawfulnes of vowed chastity amongst those who are married,
affirming that to such See before chap. 12.
as with mutual consent have vowed to God chastity, that a greater reward is
truly due unto them; and that Tom. 2. ep. 45. prope fin.
such things are not to be vowed by married persons but by mutual consent etc.
which once had he adds further, give both to God what you have both vowed;
yea he censureth the breach of the vow of chastity for damnable adultery,
saying. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 83. post init.
If he shall marry after the vow which he haith promised to God, he shall be
condemned etc. If a Nun shall marry, she shall be reputed to have committed
adultery against Christ. To this purpose also the fourth Carthage Council
(whereat S. Austin was present and subscribed) decreed concerning vowed widows,
that Can. 104.
If any widows though young in years etc. shall vow themselves to God, and
casting of their lay habit, shall appear in religious habit under the
testimony of the Bishop and the Church, and shall afterward turn to secular
marriages, according to the Apostle, they shall have damnation. This decree is
so disliking to Danaeus, that he charge the Council and S. Austin with 1.
partis. alt. part. p. 1011.
abusing manifestly the word of God; and as Osiander thinks Cent. 5. l. 1. c.
1. p. 20.
this Canon haith great errors in it.

And whereas the ancient Nouelistes did usually object (as Protestants still
do) that of 1. Tim. 4.3. thence to infer, that the Churches forbidding of
marriage in vowed persons, is the doctrine of devils. S. Austin answeareth
thereto in these words, Tom. 6. cent. Faust. Manich. l. 30. c. 6. prope init.
He forbids to marry, who says that it is evil, not he who prefers
before this good an other thing better. And the same answer is made by
Protestants in the case of fasting from certain meats as namely by M.
Eccles. pol. l. 5. sec. 72. p. 209. Jacob in his defense of the Church. p. 59.
quaerimonia Ecclesiae. p. 106. 107.
Hooker, M. Jacob, and others. Ad lastly herunto that this vowing of chastity
by Preistes, Virgins, or Widows, was not (as Protestants seek to euade) in S.
Austines judgment Aug. Tom. 6. de virginit. c. 13. 22. 23. And see Fulke
against Rhem. Test. in 1. Cor. c. 7. ad 28.
in reguard of this present life, neither that they should pass the time
without greater troubles, nor for the avoiding of greater vexations, but
expressly for the life to come, which is promised in the kindome of heaven. And
according to this he reports Iouinians condemned error, saying, Tom. 6. haer.
82. prope fin.
He would not marry, not for any greater merit with God in the kingdom of life
everlasting, but for the present necessity lest he should suffer the troublet
of marriage.

S. Austin teaches that it is lawful to vow the state of monastical or
religious life. SECTION. 3.
COncerning the professed poverty of Monks, S. Austin reprehendeth one
Ianuarius for that Tom. 10. de diuersis. sermon. 49. de com. vita Cleric. c. 2.
ante med.
professing a life in common, he made a will and appointed heirs etc, whereof he
further says, Proh dolor illius societatis, O grief of that community. The
beginning of this very sermon is above 900. years since alleged verbatim
under S. Austines name by S. Bid in 2. Cor. c. 8. And this sermon and these
very words now cyted, are at large recyted under S. Austines name above 100.
years since in the Council of Cap. 112.
Aquisgrane, under Lewis the first. The Centuristes also say hereof, Cent. 5.
col. 710.
Austin by the way reherseth certain things of Monks etc. as that, None of
them possessed any thing proper to them selves: And the same is confessed by
Polit. Eccles. l. 2. c. 13. p. 474. Hosp. de orig. Monach. fol. 74.
Zepperus, and Hospinian, as also of S. Hierome, by Estate of the Church. p.
132.
Chrispinus.

And that this profession of Monathisme was under vow, S. Austin further says,
Tom. 8. in Psalm. 75. mult. post med.
what is it, they made void their first faith? they have vowed and not
performed; therefore let no brother placed in the Monastery say, I will leave the
Monastery etc. it is answered to him they have not vowed, thou have vowed, thou
have looked back etc. remember Lots wife. And yet in more full explication of
S. Austines judgment and the doctrine of his time; the Protestant Mollitor
affirms even of the Calcedon Council, De Eccles. milit. p. 80. and see
Council. Calced. can. 15.
that it, against the Oracles of the holy Ghost, forbad the use of marriage to
Monks, and Nuns.

But S. Austin yet further impugneth the heretic Petilianus for inueighing
against this profession, he spoke ( says S. Tom. 7. cont. lit. Petil. l. 3. c.
40. post med.
Austin) with contumelious mouth in disprase of Monks and Monasteries. And he
charge the Circumcelians, for that Tom. 8. in Psalm. 132. post init.
they were accustomed to say what means this name of Monks. And again,
Ibidem. ante med.
what do they say who insult against us concerning the name of Monks etc. who
say unto us, show ye where the name of Monks is written?

Now as concerning the religious habit of professed Virgins, Widows, and
Monks, the 4. Carthage Council (whereto S. Austin subscribed) speaking of
professed Widows, says, Can. 104.
Those who leaving their laycal habit have vowed them selves to God under the
testimony of the Bishop and the Church in a religious habit etc. The
Centuristes also confess Cent. 5. c. 7. col. 744. and see also Osiand. cent.
5. p. 155.
veiled virgins (to be mentioned) in the 26. Canon of the Milleuitan Council,
whereto also S. Austin subscribed; as also to the 4. Carthage Council wherein it
was decreed that Can. 11.
when a Nun is presented to the Bishop for her consecration, that she be
clothed with such garments as shall be fit for her profession and sanctimony
ever after to use. This Canon is also acknowledge by Osiander, charging it
Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 6.
with superstitious and hipocritical habits. And the like is to be seen in the
3. Can. 4.
Carthage Council, reported also by the same Cent. 4. p. 523.
Osiander. The Centuristes also speaking of the Monks of the 4. age, confess
that they used Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 472. and see cent. 5. c. 6 col. 704. and
Sozom. hist. l. 3. c. 13.
a certain clothing (or covering) upon their heads, which they called their
hood, a girdle also about their loins, and a garment upon their shoulders; and
they mention also the Cent. 5. c. 6. col 733.
habit of Nuns. In like manner as touching the abstinence of Monks the
Centuristes report from Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 688. and col. 711. 732.
S. Austin their almost incredible fastes, affirming also from him that, some
spent very often three whole days and more without meat or drink, and that
they abstained also from flesh and wine: and that Aust. in ep. 86. tells that
many in the Monasteries fasted five days in the week during their whole life.

S. Austin also testifyeth him self to have been a Monk, for speaking of
Monachisme he says, Tom. ^. ep. 89. ad Hilarium. versus fin.
I who write these things etc. do exhort others to this purpose with all my
power, and in the name of our Lord I have partakers. And speaking against
Petilianus he affirms that, Tom. 7. cont. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 40. post med.
he spoke with contumelious mouth in disprase of Monasteries and Monks,
reprehending also me, that this kind of life was instituted by me. To which
purpose also says Passidonius of S. Aust. that, In vita August. c. 5. init.
being made Priest, presently he erected a Monastery within the Church, and
began to live with the servants of God according to the manner and rule. yea S.
Austin further says of him self, Tom. 10. de diuersis sermon. 49. de com. vita
Cleric.
I disposed my self to be in the Monastery with the brethren etc. I sold my
slender means, and gave to the poor etc. behold how we live, it is not
lawful for any in our company to have any thing proper to them selves. And the
Centuristes likewise report that Gent. 5. c. 6. col. 701.
Aust. in Psalm. 103. exhorts rich men, that they will sell their gooddes,
fields, villages, gardens, to give to the servants of God, and to build
Churches and Monasteries, yea (...) the 11. epistle is troubles him not to
number him self with the Monks, when he says, I in my little cottage with my
Monks etc. The Centuristes also say concerning Eremits. Cent. 5. c. 6. col.
714.
It is evident that there were Eremits etc. but they are called Anchoretes etc.
Austin Tom. 1, de moribus Cathol. Eccl^s. l. 1. c. 31. expressly says, that
kind of men to be dispersed chiefly through the East and Aegipt, who living
most private, altogether from the sight of men, do inhabit most desert places,
and do enjoy the speech of God: Of whom also S. Austin there affirms for
their diet that they were content only with bread and water; mencioning also
particularly one Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 5. c. 26. post. init. And after the
english translation. p. 232.
John an Eremite and Prophet.

Lastly though Protestants would delude all this, by barely affirming that the
Monks of those Primitive times were much different in their profession and
manner of life from ours of these, yet, besides the premises which do over
clearly convince the contrary, it is evident that, that very Monachisme which
S. Austin haith thus described and commended, is much disliked by our libertine
Nouelistes, and so accordingly Institut. l. 4. c. 13. sec. 16.
Calvin says, In the mean time I do not dissemble, but that in that very
ancient form (of Monachisme) there is some thing which little pleases me. for
which also both S. Austin and S. Hierome are further confessed and reprehended
herein by De origin Monach. fol. 100. 106.
Hospinian, who terms also Ibidem. fol. 33.
Austin a great lover of monastical profession according to the custom of that
age etc. but this Father (let it be spoken otherwise with leave of so great a
man) wresteth the words of the Prophet, says this Protestant: So little
pleasing is S. Austin and the ancient Monks with their perfection and
austerity of life to modern Protestants.

Concerning Antichrist, usury, and permission of stews. CHAPTER. 16.
Concerning Antichrist his coming at the end of the world: And of Enoch, and
Elias, their coming as then to resist him. SECTION. 1
VVEreas our adversaries do think, the word Antichrist to signify, not an open
professed adversary, but Christ's pretended Centuristes cent. 1. l. 2. col.
435. Musulus, loc. com. p. 184.
Vicar; the Centuristes do to the contrary confess, that S. Austin is of
opinion that Antichrist shall be one, who will directly oppose him self to
Christ, for thus they write, Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 416.
Austin teaches the Etimology of Antichrist, in epist. Ioannis. Tract. 3.
Antichrist in latin he is said who is contrary to Christ etc. some understand
Antichrist to be so called, because he is to come before Christ etc. it is not
so said, it is not so written, but Antichrist, that is, contrary to Christ etc.
likewise in Tract. de Antichristo, desiring to know of Antichrist; first you
shall mark why he is so called, to wit, for that he will be contrary to Christ
in all things etc. he will dissolve the Euangelical law, and will recall into the
world the worshipping of devils.

S. Austin likewise affirms that he shall spring from the Jews saying, Tom.
9. tract. de Antichristo. post. init And see cent. 5. c. 4. col. 416. And see
tom. 3. de benedict. Jacob. prope fin.
As our authors say, Antichrist shall ^e borne of the people of the Jews, of
the tribe of Dan, according to the Prophet saying etc.

The Centuristes also confess that in S. Austines judgment Antichrist should
not come til all the subjected kingdoms were revolted from the Roman Empire
which yet is unaccomplished, for thus they write, Cent. 5. c. 4. col. 420.
Austin in his treatise of Antichrist declares in few words the time of
Antichrists coming, therefore the Apostle Paul from hence affirms Antichrist
not to come before into the world, unless first a departure shall come, that is,
unless al kingdoms shall depart from the Roman Empire, which were before subject
unto it: And then next afterward they ad, but this time is not yet come
because though we see the Roman Empire for the greatest part to be overthrown,
yet as long as the kings of France shall continue who must possess the Roman
Empire, it shall not wholly perish, because it shall stand in it kings. And the
same continuance yet of the Roman Empire, is collected by other Dresserus in
Millenario 5. in his oration added to the end thereof. de Monarchia 4. fol. Nn.
2. and fol. Nn. 3. Sonhius, tom. 1. continen. scripta. etc. p. 173. Springerus
de pace religionis. p. 18. 20.
Protestants even from the Scriptures them selves.

Now concerning the short reign of Antichrist, S. Austin (according to our
english translation) Tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 20. c. 23. circa med. And
according to the engl. transl. p. 823.
writes Antichrists kingdom shall be most cruel against the Church, though it
last but a while etc. The times, time, and half a time, is three years and a
half: a year, two years, and half a year, and this is declared by a number
of days afterward, and by the number of months in other places of
Scripture. As also, Ibidem. c. 8. p. 801.
bound he is, and in the last and smalest remainder of time shall he be loosed,
for we read that he shall rainge in his greatest malice only three years and
six months. And again, Tom. 9. tract. de Antichristo. prope fin.
Antichrist when for three years and a half etc. he shall vex the world etc.
afterward he shall kill Enoch and Elias.

But as touching Enoch, and Elias, S. Austin says, Tom. 7. de pec. orig. c.
23. post med. and tom. 3. de Genesis ad lit. l. 9. c. 6 post med. and tom. 3. de
mirabilibus sacrae Scripturae. l. 1. c. 3. post med.
We doubt not Enoch, and Elias, to live in the bodies wherewith they were borne:
which he confirms in sundry other places, and of the same opinion are also
sundry Protestants. Pet. Mart. in his common places in english. part. 3. c.
16. sec. 17. p. 380. Calvin. in Haebr. in c. 11. 5. and see Luther Tom. 6.
Wittemb. fol. 79. Willet upon Genesis in. 5. p. 69.
But S. Austin yet teaches further saying, Tom. 5. de ciuit Dei l 20. c. 29
post init. and after the eng. transl. p. 830.
that Elias shall convert the Jews to Christ, (vltimo tempore) before the end
of the world etc. is most commonly believed and taught of us Christians, and is
held as a point of infallible truth, for we may well hope of the coming of him
before the judgment of Christ, whom we do truly believe to live in the body at
this houer, without ever having taisted of death. Again (even according to our
english Ibidem. p. 834.
translation) somewhat before the day of judgment, Elias shall come, the Jews
shall believe, Antichrist shall persecute, Christ shall judge, and the dead shall
arise.

Lastly S. Austin teaches that at the day of judgment Christ shall come Tom.
10. de tempore. ser. 130. post med.
with the sign of the Cross before him: And the same is taught by Origin,
Chrysostom, Hierome, Hillary, Theophilact, Euthemius, and Bid, in their
several commentaries upon Math. 28.30. And the same is defended by the
Protestant M. Trig, saying, True Catholic. p. 295.
Gualter of famous memory so expoundes Math. 24.30. And by the sign of the
son of man, he understands the Cross, these be his words, most of the
ancient Fathers expound the Cross to be this sign etc. Also Thomas Couper
Bishop of Lincoln said, my brethren can you not endure that sign to be made
here upon earth, which before the coming of the judge shall be conspicuous in
heaven? And yet all this is so Popish to M. Nappeir, that he blusheth nor to
write, Upon the Reuelat. p. 89. 90. 214. 215. 219. and Proposition. 31. p. 72.
73. 74. 75.
The sign or Cross which appeared in vision to Constantine with these words
in hoc signo vinces, in this sign thou shall overcome, was the first public
and visible mark of Antichrist. O times, o times, what a monster have ye bred?

S. Austin teaches usury to be unlawful. SECTION. 2.
THough many Molinaeus in Fento^ of usury. l. 2. c. 2. sec. 3. p. 44. Bucer. in
his scripta Anglican. p. 789. 790. 791 Virel, in his prin. grounds of religion

^7^. Osiander. cent. 16. l. 4. c. 34. p. 1047.
Protestants do defend usury for lawful, yet the contrary with all Catholics
is mantained by S. Austin, of whom thus writes M Fenton, Treatise of usury, l.
2. c. 3. p. 52.
If we desire S. Austines judgment (who is in steed of many) he is so
confident, that he appealeth to the usurers them selves, who practiced in his
days, saying in Psalm 36. quam detestabile sic, quam odiosum, quam execrandum,
pute et ipsi Faeneratores norunt, (how detestable, how odious, how execrable,
it is, the very vserers know them selves:) but he might happily speak of some
excessive usury or extortion, observe therefore how presently he explaineth him
self in the very same place saying, Si aliquid plus qua^ dedisti expectes
accipere, Faenerator es, et in hoc improbandus, (If thou expect to receive any
more then thou delivered, thou art a Usurer, and in this thou art to be
condemned:) the common objection which is made for usury etc. is answered by
the same Father saying. the usurers also dare say, they have not else whereon to
live, so may the robber say etc. so may the burgler say etc. so may the baud
say etc. his final sentence is, that usurers belong not to the Church of God.
Thus far M. Fenton from S. Austin against usury.

S. Austin teaches that stews may be permitted for the avoiding of greater
evil. SECTION. 3.
AS concerning Stews which are permitted in some Catholic countries in
prevention of greater inconvenience, as of unnatural or violent accomplished
lusts, and the general over spreading of that particular evil, which
otherwise; like the plague, would disperse it self into al or most parts of
the city were it not restrained (as is the other to the pesthouse) to the sink
or channel or some one like reserved several precinct: In this respect
Catholic divines hold, that for the preventing of greater mischeife, it may
be so permitted, though not allowed; as in like respect the Math. 19.8.
libel of diu^rce was by Moses not allowed, but permitted for the hardness of
the Jews hearts; or as is usury by the Church Fenton in his treatise of
usury. l. 2. c. 9. p. 71. 73.
of England, and some Of Geneua, see Hutton in his preface to the 2. part of
the answer.
other Protestant Churches not allowed, but like wise permitted, in respect of
trade, commerse and other important necessity. To which purpose writes, In
nou. Test. in Anot. in Math. 19.8.
Beza, The civil laws if they be well enacted, do command nothing which God
prohibiteth, nor prohibit any thing which God commands, but through the
iniquity of men they are compelled only to moderate many things, which they
cannot quite take away, and these are they which are said to be permitted by
the laws, for example, Christian charity forbids to commit usury, yet by
reason of the trading of men, many Magistrates see they cannot absolutely
forbid it, therefore they prescribe a certain quantity of gain. But is it
therefore lawful with a good conscience to commit usury? No truly: neither do
the civil laws approve, but rather condemn what they only tolerate, the
wickedness of men compelling them thereto. Luther also writes that, In Deutero.
in c. 24. fol. 160.
Christ Math. 19. proves sufficiently the law of divorce to be merely civil
and permitted for the hardness of the people etc. Many things in a common
wealth are to be suffered by reason of those that are hard and intractable,
lest greater evils be done. And hereof also says In Mat. c. 19. 8.
Pelican, he pardoned the lesser evil, lest the greater should be committed.

Now upon this one and the same like ground is established our not allowance,
but like permitting of stews, yet not without condign answearable punishment
inflicted upon Fenton vbi supra. l. 2. c. 9. p. 70. 57.
usurers and See F. Persons in his answer to Nichols. fol. 1. and 3.
stews.

But to come to the point of stews, S. Austin writes, Tom. 1. l. 2. de
ordine. c. 4. circ. med.
what can be said more unclean, more void of comlines, more full of turpitude,
then harlots, baudes, and such other like pestilences? take harlots from among
men, and you shall disturb al things with lecherous lusts etc. A saying so
direct and pertinent, that it is therefore confessed and rejected by Peter
Common places in english. part. 2. c. 11. sec. 6 p. 471. Jewel in his defense
of the Apology. p. 409.
Martyr and M. Jewel. And whereas M. Jewel would euade, that S. Austin wrote
those words, him self yet keeping a concubine, and living in whordome: It is
evident to the contrary and confessed by the Cent. 5. c. 10. col. 1120. under
the titie, scripta ab August. cum adhuc esset Catechumenus.
Centuristes, that S. Austin after his conversion and before his Preisthood,
wrote many excellent treatises, among which this book de Ordine, was specially
one, and for such mentioned by the Centuristes, and written by S. Austin as him
self testifyeth, Tom. 1. l. 1. Retract. c. 3. initio.
when he wrote contra Academicos, which was as him self yet further testifyeth,
Lib. 1. retract. c. 1. initio.
eue^ when he had given over the world: And which is most, S. Austin ranketh
this book among his many other excellent treatises by him specially mentioned
and reuewed in his book of Retractations, and explayning or retracting from
each of them what he thought needful, he does the like to this, Lib. 1.
retract. c. 3.
but yet without al explanation or exception to the saying now alleged.

Concerning Ceremonies. CHAPTER. 17.
S. Austin teaches sundry holy ceremonies now used in the Catholic Church in
the administration of the Sacraments. SECTION. 1.
Having thus gone through the many particular points of doctrine, we will now
lastly end with Ceremonies, which how forcible they be to stir up in us
devotion, S. Austin very pertinently affirms saying. Tom. 2. ep. 119. ad
Ianuarium. c. 11. fine. and see c. 7.
I think that the very motion of the mind, as long as it is yet entangled in
earthly things, is more slowly inflamed, but if it be directed to corporal
similitudes, and from thence to things spiritual, which are represented by
those similitudes, by the very passage as it were it is strengthened, and as
fire stirred up, it is inflamed, and with more ardent love is drawn to rest
and quiet. As also Tom. 2. ep. 5. ad Marcel. post init.
There are certain signs, by the celebration and use whereof, not to God, but
to us, profitable offices of piety are excercised. And Tom. 9 de visit. Infirm.
l. 2. c. 3. init.
there are certain exterior signs which sometimes stir up sluggish faith. In
example whereof he further says, Tom. 4. de cura pro mort. c. 5. post init.
when they kneel dowen, when they stretch out their hands, when they lie
prostrate upon the ground etc. A man by these does better stir up himself to
pray etc. And, the same external things visibly done, that internal invisible
(motion) which caused them is increased, and hereby the affection of the heart,
which went before, that these things might be, increases, because they are
done.

But to descend to Ceremonies in particular, and first concerning Ceremonies
usual in administration the of Sacraments, we have See before, c. 5. sect. 4.
already alleged from S. Austin the confessed general usage of the sign of
the Cross in the administration of the Sacraments: we have also alleged from
See before c. 6. sect. 4.
him the other usual Cerem^^^ used in Baptism, as namely, the Consecration of
the water of Baptism, Exercisme, Exuflation, Annoyling, Abrenunciation, the
usage of spitle, Godfathers, and trinal imersion. As concerning Confirmation,
we have alleged the Sea before. c. 7.
consecration of Chrisme or Oil, the signing of the party confirmed with the
sign of the Cross and, imposition of hands.

As touching the Eucharist, S. Austin with the third Carthage council decreed
concerning the mixture of water with wine in the Chalice, that Can. 24. and
Aug. tom. 3. de doc. Christ. l. 4. c. 21. and Tom. 3. de Eccles. dog. c. 75.
in the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord, nothing more be offered
then our Lord him self delivered, that is, bread and wine, mingled with water;
This is confessed by Osiander, who says thereof, Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 24. p. 527.
mingling of water is not without superstition. In like sort concerning the
consecration of the Sacrament with the sign of the Cross, S. Austin writes,
Tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 118. prope fin.
which sign unless it be applied to the foreheades of the believers or to the
water wher^^^ they are regenerated, or to the oil wherewith they are anointed,
or to the sacrifice, wherewith they are nourished, none of them are duly
performed. As also, Tom. 10. ser. 19. de Sanctis. prope fin.
with the sign of the Cross etc. the Sacraments of the Altar with addition of
our Lords words are made. And most plainly, Tom. 10 ser. 181. de temp. c. 3.
fine.
with this sign of the Cross the body of our Lord is cos^crated. This point is
so plain in S Austin that for such it is confessed by M. In Couels answer to
Burges. p. 130.
Burges, and the Treatise of the sign of the Cross. p. 27.
Puritans.

S. Austin also taught before the receiving of the Sacrament See before. c. 8.
sect. 3.
fasting; and the use of holy bread. He also teaches that, Tom. 8. in Psalm.
113. con. 2. post med.
vessels consecrated by their very ministry are called holy: whereof also says
S. Ep. ad Theoph. Alex. ante libros paschales
Hierome, the sacred Chalices and holy coueringes, by reason of touching the
body and blood of our Lord, are to be worshipped (eadem maiestate) in like sort
as the body and blood. And S. Austin with the 4. Carthage Council decreed that,
Can. 5.
the Subdeacon when he takes Orders etc. shall take from the hand of the Bishop
the empty Paten, and the empty Chalice, and from the hand of the Archdeacon,
the Cruet with water and Towel. Al which is confessed by the Cent. 4. c. 9.

Centuristes and Osiander. And as for Deacons and their office, S. Austin
says, Tom. 4. in quaest. Vet. et nou. Test. q. 101.
they power water upon the hands of the Priest, as we see in all Churches: so
general was the usage hereof in this ancient age. And we have seen See
before. c. 8. sect. 5.
before that S. Austin taught that, the body of our Lord is offered upon the
Altar: And that Altars were consecrated with the sign of the Cross and
Chrisme.

We have seen likewise See before. c. 9.
concerning the Sacrament of Penance, that S. Austin mencioneth confession of
our sins, and the Preistes absolution with imposition of hands, and enjoined
penance: for the mitigating whereof pardons were sometimes granted.

And as for the Sacrament of Orders we have likewise seen See before. c. 11.
before the several rytes used in ordaining Bishops, Preistes, Deacons,
Subdeacons, Acolites, Exorcistes, Readers, and Doorekeepers: In some whereof are
mentioned, Chalice, Paten, Cruet, Towel, Waxen candles for Church lights,
books of Exorcisme etc. Al which is confessed and reproved by Osiander for
Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 4. 5.
superstitious. It was likewise decreed in the 4. Carthage Can. 41.
Council that, the Deacon should only wear the Albe in time of the sacrifice
or reading. Of which Canon Osiander also says, Cent. 5. p. 10.
these things smell of the idle Roman pontificial Ceremonies; S. Austin
likewise Tom. 4. quaest. vet. et nou. Test. q. 46. post med.
mencioneth as is also confessed by M. 2. part. of the answ. p. 194.
Hutton the vestiment called Dalmatica, worn by Deacons. But to conclude many
in one. M. Parker affirms that, Against symbolising. part. 1. c. 1. p. 52.
The Fathers will have the garments to be religious which are used in the Church.

Lastly concerning Matrimony, S. Austin See before. c. 12.
before mentioned the Preistes blessing of the Bride and Bridgroome.

S. Austin teaches sundry Ceremonies concerning prayer now used in the Roman
Church. SECTION. 2.
TO forbear the many other Ceremonies, which would require a larger discourse,
and to recite but some few of those which are concerning prayer. And first
concerning even the Rogation week, D. Boys avouches that, Exposition of the
dominical epistles, the spring part. p. 219. 220.
It is more then probable that rogations were in the Church before the days of
S. Austin; in proof whereof he alleges diverse of S. Austins wrytinges.

Concerning Canonical hours, S. Austin advises thus, Tom. 10. de temp. sermon.
55. post init.
upon the vigils rise more early and above al things assemble together at the
third, the sixth, and the ninth (hours.) And concerning prayer toward the
East, the Centuristes confess and say of Austin that he, Cent. 5. c. 6. col.
677.
l 2 de sermon Domini in monte. testifyeth that they did pray standing, and
with their faces toward the East. And the like is confessed of S. Basil, and
the other Fathers by the same Cent. 4. col. 432.
Centuristes. In like sort S. Austin mencioneth Tom. 4. de cura pro mort. c. 5.
post init.
our kneeling dowen, our stretching out our hands, our lying prostrate upon
the ground, our Tom. 10. de verbis Domini. ser. 8. post init. and de temp. ser
48. and tom. 8. in Psalm. 31. enar. 2. ante med.
knocking of our breasts, as Ceremonies helping to better devotion in prayer.

He commends also the signing of our foreheades with the sign of the Cross:
The people (says Tom. 6. cont. Faust. Manich. l. 12. c. 30. circa med.
he) are marked in their foreheades with the sign of our Lords passion, in
preservation of their saifty; and, Tom. 9. in Euang. Joan. tract. 3. post init.
he would not have a star to be his sign in the foreheades of the faithful,
but a Cross. Yea speaking of him self and his own practice, he glories of
the Cross in these words, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 141. circa med. and tom. 9. in Io.
tract. 36. and tom. 8. in Psalm. 46.
I am so far from being ashamed of the Cross, that I do not keep the Cross
of Christ in a hidden place, but I carry it in my forehead. yea further speking
against the Pagan contemning the Cross he says, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 141. circa
med.
Let him insult against Christ crucified let me see the Cross of Christ in the
foreheades of Kings.

He likewise affirms that, Tom. 2. ep. 178. mult. post med. and tom. 7. cont.
lit. Petil. l. 2. c. 78. and see Willet upon the Romans in c. 16. p. 737.
confessing this.
Al nations do sing Amen, and Alleluia, in the Hebrew words, which (says he)
neither the Latin nor the barberous may translate: And that Tom. 3. de doc.
Christ. l. 2. c. 11. prope init. And see this confessed by Fulke against. Rhem.
Test. in revel. 19. 4. sect. 2.
for the more sacred authority of the words so remaining.

The Centuristes also report from him concerning the practice of the Christians
in those times that, Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 692.
as before Easter they spent the Lent with affliction of the body, as haith
been said before, so after Easter they spent the Quinquagesima (or days
between Easter and Whitsontide) with much joy, so that etc. they used Alleluia
in their Hymns and Canticles, as Austin relates. Tract. 17. in Icanet Ep. 86.
and 119. Of this also says S. Austin him self, Tom. 8. in Psalm. 106. prope
init. and tom. 10. de temp. ser. 151. circa med.
there is Alleluia, and twice Alleluia, which at certain times we are
accustomed solemly to sing, according to the ancient tradition of the Church.
Again, speaking of Easter time he says, that then Tom. 2. ep. 119. ad Ianuar.
c. 15. prope fin.
fastinges are released, and we pray standing etc. and Alleluia is sung. And
according to this M. Hooker Eccles. pol. l. 5. sec. 71. p. 199. 205. 215. And
see Aug. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 110. post init.
approves the Churches appointing of several times, some in signification of
our joy, and others of our sorrow.

S. Austin with the fifth Carthage Council decrees that, Can. 6.
as often as any doubt is had of Churches whether they be consecrated, without
al fear let them be consecrated. Of this Canon Osiander says, Cen. 5. l. 1.
c. 33. p. 157. and see the Centuristes. cent. 5. col. 644.
the other part of this chapter concerning the cosecration of Churches is
superstitious.

The Church thus consecrated S. Austin affirms it to be a sanctuary for
persons fleeing thereunto, whereof he writes thus to Bonifacius, Tom. 2. ep.
187. prope init. And see tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 1. c. 4. and the Centuristes.
cent. 5. col. 720. 721.
thou have taken violently a man out of the Church etc. therefore restore him
again saife to the Church whom thou most irreligious have taken away etc. and
I do excommunicate thee until etc. And Osiander recyteth and reproves as Cent.
5. l. 2. c. 28. p. 294. and see Socrat. hist. l. 6. c. 5. and Council. Agath.
can. 29. and Tolet. 12. can. 10. and Ilerdense. can. 8. and Matisconense. 2.
can. 8.
wholly superstitious the 5. Canon of the Arausecau Council, in which it was
decreed that, such as fled to the Church ought not to be delivered up, but
defended for the reverence and intercession of the holy place.

Concerning also several parcels of the Mass, S. Austin speaking of Kyrie
leison, affirms that, Tom. 2. ep. 178. versus fin.
Al Christian Greeks, Latins, and barbarous, do pray for mercy in the greek
tongue. And the like usage thereof, at Mattins, Mass, and Euensong, is expressly
affirmed Can. 5.
(about S. Austins time) in the Council Vasense, and afterward by S. Lib. 7.
ep. 63.
Gregory.

He mencioneth also Tom. 7. de bono persevere. c. 13. and tom. 20. de temp. ser.
44. versus fin. and tom. 8. in Psalm. 85. and Ciprian de orat. Dom. versus fin.
and D. Boys in his exposition of the Lyturgy. p. 118. and Aug. tom. 2. ep. 57.
ad Dardan. ante med. and tom 3. de spir. et lit. c. 11.
Sursum eorda, habemus ad Dominum, gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro, dignum et
iustum est etc. which argues the then public Lyturgy of the west Church, to
have been for substance the same in form and language with ours now of this
age.

And yet in further proof of the Latin language of public service in those
ancient times of S. Austin it is made yet more certain, in that no nouel
contradicted beginning thereof since S. Austines time can be named, whereas to
the contrary, Mass in Latin is confessed by the Cent. 7. c. 6. col. 154.
Centuristes to hane been, Anno Domini. 681. And the usage thereof before this
in England is acknowledged by the Cent. 7. c. 7. col. 233. and 143. Osiand.
Cent. 7. p. 189. Spark against John de Albinis. c. 17. p. 161.
Centuristes, Osiander, and M. Spark: In so much that Willet him self writes
that, Sinopsis contr. 4. q. 10. p. 160. 164.
about the year of our Lord 666. the Latin service was commanded to be used
in all countries. And the no less antiquity thereof is granted by Hist. sacram.
part. 1. l. 3. p. 192.
Hospinian. But M White aryseth yet higher confessing that, Way to the true
Church. p. 378.
Mass in Latin, where the people understood it not (to have been) in the time
of Gregory 600. years after Christ.

And whereas all that our adversaries do hence infer is, that they do not
expressly find Mass in Latin before these times; D. Spark very pertinently
confesses and answeareth unto the like objection in another matter saying to
the Puritans, Persuasion to uniformity. p. 25.
The most diligent searcher of ancient writers cannot show the first beginning
and original thereof, he may show when first he reads it was used, but that will
not prove that it was not used before, but rather shows the contrary. Hereunto
only yet ad the example of al ancient Lyturgies of the western Church whereof
none be found in England, French, Spanish, Dutch, or Italian: And also that the
public Lyturgy in Latin, though confessedly it was ancient, is not yet
known to have been contradicted upon any first known nouel beginning thereof
sinnce S. Austines time, and thereupon then let the reader judge but
indifferently of the whole.

Lastly S. Austin mencioneth the very word Mass it self, saying, Tom. 10. de
temp. sermon. 91. init. And see ser. 237.
In the lesson which is to be read to us at Mass, we are to hear etc And
whereas M. Against Rhem. test. in 1. Cor. 20. sec. 9. fol. 279.
Fulke does in evasion hereof over bouldly without al proof answer, those
sermons of S. Austin, wherein Mass is so named to be couterfeated, he is
refelled therein by his own Protestant brethren Peter In Crispinus of the
estate of the Church. p. 141. And see him self in his common places in
English. part. 4. c. 12. p. 216.
Martyr, and De opificio Missae. l. 1. sec. 12. p. 5.
Crastouius, of whom thus writes Crispinus, Many doubt whether these sermons
be Austines, but Peter Martyr says, the style and sentences seem to be
Austines. I am of opinion that in the time of Austin the word Missa began to be
usurped. And Crastouius confesses that, S. Austin, and S. Ambrose, used the
word Mass, and thereby understood that sacred action of the Christian Lyturgy.
M. Problem. p. 31.
Perkins also among his other exceptions against some of S. Austins sermons,
forbeareth yet to except against these sermons now alleged.

But not only S. Austin, but all the Fathers of the 2. Can. 3.
Carthage Council, as also of the 4. Can. 84.
and the Milleuitan Can. 12. and see Osiander confessing this cent. 5. l. 1. c.
1. p. 17. and l. 1. c. 33. p. 149.
Council do mention the word Missa: In so much that M. Fulke confesses that;

Council Milleuitan. can. 12. Hereto I will only ad, that where the Apostle
promises concerning the public celebration of the Eucharist saying, 1. Cor.

that point, whereby are infinuated those many things concerning the same which
are observed by tradition, S. Austin frames Tom. 2. ep. 118. ad Ianuar. c. 6.

Concerning miracles reported by S. Austin, and making in further proof and
confirmation of our Catholic religion by him formerly taught. CHAPTER. 18.
S. Austin reports several miracles in proof of invocation of Saints.
SECTION. 1.
NOw for the further, and yet more clear understanding, and no less
confirming of S. Austins now examined religion, we will next briefly recite or
rather but abridge, certain of those miracles done in testimony thereof and
reported by S. Austin him self in his undoubted book de ciuitate Dei. l. 22.
c. 8. which (in reguard of the known worthiness of the said book) is by a
Protestant (termed by one of his own brethren Preface of the translation to
the Earl of Pembrooke.
a famous Father) now lately translated into English. first then in proof of
invocation of Saints, S. Austin relates (as before that one De ciuit. Dei. l
22. c. 8. and in the Engl. transl. p. 886.
Florentius of Hippo a poor old man, lost his upper garment, and being unable
to buy another, he came to the shrine of the 20. martyrs, and prayed aloud unto
them to help him to rayments etc. at his departure he spyed a great fish upon
the shore etc. which cutting in pieces he found in the belly thereof a ring of
gold.

He reports also of Ibidem. and in the engl. trans. p. 887.
one Bassus a Syrian that dwelt at Hippo, who praying for his sick daughter at
S. Stephens shrine, and having her garment with him, word came by a boy that
she was dead etc. he coming home fynding al in tears, laid her garment upon
her and she presently revived.

He likewise relates, Ibidem. and p. 889.
a miracle wrought (says he) amnngst us so famous, that I think none of Hippo
but saw it, or knew it. The substance of this his report concerns partly
Paladia a devout woman and greatly diseased, who repared for her health to the
monument of S. Stephen, and descending Ibidem. and p. 890.
from the steps whereupon she stood, she went to pray to the holy martyr (these
last words are purposly left out in the English translation) and having
touched the grate, she thereupon fel-downe as it were a sleep, and rose up
again sound etc. then rose such an exultation both of men and women etc. their
joy was so loudly expressed, that it was able to strike the strongest ear with
stupour. This he reports as of a thing done in his own presence.

He besides reports Aug. tom. 4. de cura pro mort. c. 16. prope init.
the aparition made to the Citizens of Nola by (holy) Faelix when it was
oppugned by the Barbarians: And though the Cent. 5. c. 13. col. 1482.
Centuristes reject such apparitions of the disceased, they do yet report Cent.
5. c. 13. col. 1482. 1486. 1487. 1489.
other like from the other Fathers of S. Austines age.

S. Austin reports several miracles in proof of the honoring of Saictes
relics. SECTION. 2.
TO this purpose he says, Ibidem. and p. 883.
The miracle that was done at Millaine when I was there, when a blind man
obtained his sight, might come to the notice of many etc. the thing was done
many people being witness that ran to the bodies of the martyrs Protasius, and
Geruasius, who lying hid and altogether unknown, were found by Ambrose the
Bishop by revelation in his sleep. This miracle S. Austin also records in
his book Lib. 1. c. 13. post med.
of Retractations: And Lib. 9. confess. c. 7.
elsewhere relates that the bodies of Protasius, and Geruasius, were
miraculously preserved after many years uncorrupted, and at last revealed to
S. Ambrose.

He reports also that, Ibidem. and p. 886.
when Bishop Proiectus brought the relics of Stephen the martyr to his tomb,
many people flocked together, amongst whom a blind woman prayed them to lead
her to the Bishop that carried the holy relics: the Bishop gave her certain
flowers which he had in his hand, she took the^, put the^ to her eyes, and
forthwith had her sight restored, she went before them rejoicing, those who
were present being astonished.

He testifyeth also of Ibidem. and p. 887.
Eucherius a Spanish Priest, that dwelt at Calam, who was cured of the stone by
the same relics which Possidius brought thither: and being afterward of
another disease laid out so for dead (vt ei iam pollices ligarentur) that his
hands were bound, by the help of the said martyr, when the garment of the said
Priest was carried back from the shrine and laid upon his body as he lay, he
was raised to life.

The like he mencioneth of a certain Ibidem. and p 887.
Voteresse, who being sick and past recovery, sent her garment to the same
shrine, but before it came back she was dead, yet her Parents covered her dead
carcass with it, which done she presently revived. Elusinus (also says Ibidem.
and p. 888.
he) a captain, seeing his son dead, took him and laid him upon the shrine
etc. where after he had prayed a while, he found him revived.

S. Austin reports some miracles in proof of the sign of the Cross: And of
pilgrimage to the holy land. SECTION. 3.
HE records that, In Carthage Ibidem. and p. 884.
Innocentia a most religious woman etc. had a canker in her breast, a disease,
as the Physicians say, incurable, etc. she turned her self only to God in
prayer, and was admonished in her sleep, that etc, what woman who being
baptized did first meet her, should mark that place with the sign of the
Cross, she did so, and forthwith was cured. This miracle is also reported by
the Gent. 5. c. 6. col. 661.
Centuristes.

And as concerning the holy Land, or Pilgrimage thereto, S. Austin affirms of
a certain man that Ibidem. and p 885.
had bestowed on him by a friend a little of the holy earth, brought from
Jerusalem, where Christ being buried rose the third day: he hanged it in his
Chamber for the better auoydance of evil (or wicked illusions) from his person,
now when the house was cleared of that infestation he began to think what to
do with that earth, which for reverence thereto he would not keep longer in his
chamber: It happened that I and my fellow Bishop Maximus being near etc. he
desired us that it might be buried some where, and there a place to be made for
public prayer etc. and it was done accordingly. There was there a young man
troubled with the palsy, who hearing hereof desired his parents, that without
delay they would bring him to that holy place, whether being brought, he prayed
and forthwith he went away upon his own feet sound.

S. Austin reports certain miracles in proof of the sacrifice of Christ's
body; of Altars, and of penetration of bodies. SECTION. 4.
HE records that, Ibidem. and p. 885.
one Hesperius who lives at this day (says he) by us, haith a farm^ called
Zubedie, in the territory of Fussali, which he having observed by the harm
done to his servants, and cattle, that his house was hanted with evil spirits,
he desired our Preistes in my absence, that some one of them would go thither,
by whose prayers they might depart, one went, and offered there the sacrifice
of Christ's body (for which the English translation most corruptly says, one
went, prayed, and minstred the Communion) praying very earnestly that the
vexation might cease, and by Gods mercy it forthwith ceased. This miracle is
confessed by the Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 684. Hospinian. hist. sacram. part. 1. p.
389. 591. Lauath. de spectris. part. 3. c. 10. p. 254.
Centuristes, and Hospinian, as also by Lauatherus, who recyting this story
verbatim, infers thereupon, that it is clear that superstition presently,
began etc. As also, to pray and sacrifice for souls.

In proof of Altars he reports how that Ibidem. and p. 886.
A young man possessed with a devil being brought to the memorial of the two
martyrs Geruasius and Protasius etc. with a terrible noise catched fast hold
upon the Altar, whence he durst not once move or could not, but held it as if
he had been bound to it etc. then the devil within him with great howling
asked that he might be spared etc. and departed out of the man.

Concerning penetration of bodies, S. Austin reports how that Ibidem. and p.
888.
Petronia a most excellent woman was miraculously cured of a great and
continual sickness, in which all the helps of the Physicians failed etc. she
affirmed that she was persuaded by a certain Jew that she should sow a ring
within a girdle of hair, which she should wear about her next her naked body:
and the ring should have a stone in it which is found in the raines of an ox.
Being tied as it were with this remedy (of the Magitian) she came to the shrine
of the holy martyr. But going from Carthage etc. rising to go on her journey,
she saw the ring lying before her feet, and wondering she felt the girdle of
hair wherewith she was girded: which when she perceived to be fast tied, as it
was at first, she suspected that the ring was broken and so fell of; but when
that was found to be whole she presumed she had received as it were a pledge of
her future health by so great a miracle, and so loosing the girdle, she cast it
with the ring into the river. They do not believe this ( says S. Austin) that
will not believe that Christ was borne without interruption of the virginal
parts, nor passed into his Apostles, when the doares were shut. But let them
inquire of this, and if they find it true, let them believe the other. The
woman is famous, nobly borne, nobly married, she dwells at Carthage, a great
City, a great person, those that are inquisitiue after it, they will not suffer
to be ignorant of it. The martyr him self, by whose prayers she was cured,
believed in the son of the perpetual virgin, believed in him, who went into
his Disciples the doare being shut.

S. Austin reports some miracles to be wrought by holy Oil. SECTION. 5.
I Knew (says S. Ibidem. and p. 886.
Austin) a virgin in Hippo, who was freed from the devil by annoynting her
self with oil, into which the Priest that prayed for her had mingled his
tears. As also, Ibidem. and p. 888.
Irenaeus his son being dead, and ready to be buried, one of his friends
advised him etc. that the body should be annoyled with the oil of the same
Martyr (S. Stephen.) It was done and he revived.

A further confirmation of these foresaid miracles reported by S. Austin in
proof of our Catholic religion. SECTION. 6.
VVHeras it is objected against these miracles, and against this chapter of S.
Austin, that Viues in his annotations upon this chapter affirms that he
suspected many things to have been Viues in comment. in l. 22. de ciu. Dei. c.
8. And see his preface in comment. ad libros de ciuit. Dei.
added thereto: This his suspicion is not concerning any the miracles therein
mentioned, but only concerning some few words (which he says were in his
opinion) added, velut declarands gratia, for more cl^are explication, of which
he further says, some I will leave out, others according to my custom I will be
content only to point unto; whereas he neither omitteth nor excepteth against
any of these miracles, but to the contrary there iustifyeth his addition of
them from the answearable correspondence of diverse ancient In Aug. de ciu.
Dei. l. 22. c. 8. at k. q. s. z. and in praefat. in comment. ad libros de ciu.
Dei.
manuscriptes; and from diverse old In his other praef. there de veteribus
interpretibus huius operis
expositors of this book, who never took exception against this chapter now
in question. The divines also of Louaine in the fifth Tome, after the end of
Page 313.
the books de ciuitate Dei. do mention 8. old manuscriptes, or copies there in
particular named, according to which they had conferred and published the
books de ciuitate Dei. Hereto I but annex, the 9. and 10. chapters of the same
22. book de ciu. Dei. most evidently relating to the many great miracles,
there next before mentioned, which can not be true, if the forementioned
miracles reported there c. 8. unto which they so relate, be but added or forged.

In like manner whereas M. Maulin obiecteth saying, Defense of the Cath. faith,
englished. art. 17. p. 323.
S. Austin Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. c. 8. is to be suspected, for he speaks there
of miracles done in Africa etc. whereas him self, Tom. 2. ep. 137. says that
etc. in Africa there were not any miracles wrought in any place. In solutio^
hereof, to forbere al distinguishme^t of times according to which the said 137.
epistle might be written long before the other book de ciu. Dei. as in deed
S. Austin in his Lib. 2. and see Danaeus his like answer concerning another
book. in prologom. ad Ang. Enchirid.
Retractions, places this book de ciu. Dei. among his other latest books
(which only observation in other matters suffices to reconcile no less great
seeming repugnances:) And to forbear likewise, that if repugnancy were
admitted, greater proof is yet See hereafter in this section at r. s.
alleged of this book de ciuitate Dei, then can be for that foresaid Epistle:
for a Protestant writer in his preface usually set before S. Austines Epistles
printed in 8. censureth thus of them, that certain were mingled which at the
first were found not to be Austines etc. some absolutely to be forged etc. In so
much as he sets dowen in the Page 757.
margin upon S. Austins foresaid words of trial by compulsory confession,
whereupon M. Moulins now objected words are depending and immediately next
following thereto, nouum iudicium, as thinking the same but nouel and forged.
But besides all this it is otherwise answered that as S. Austin ep. 137. most
evidently Tom. 2. ep. 137. ante med.
speaks of certain suspected delinquents, who denying the offense, were for
their trial sent, not indifferently to al places of the martyrs relics, where
miracles were showed, but only unto certain such, as the offending party
repairing thereto, was there miraculously compelled to confess his fault, (of
which kind of compulsion S. Ibidem. and Hierome in Apol. aduersus Iouin.
Austin, and S. Hierome, do make particular mention) so likewise his thereupon
ensuing there denial of miracles in Africa is not concerning the miracles of
health, formerly alleged from this book de ciu. Dei. much less the^ not
indefinitly of al miracles (as Moulin pretends) but respectively as to the
premises, and with limitation, as but denying only talia hic fieri, such
other kind of miraculous compulsory confession of the offense to be done in
Affricke, as is last before mentioned: whereupon S. Austin there enters into
special consideration concerning the great diversity of miraculous gifts,
diversely attributed both to persons and places. A thing to evident that Moulin
him self does in his very foresaid book acknowledge the foremencioned miracle
Defense etc. art. 9. p. 208.
of the house haunted with spirits, and cleared by the Priest saying Mass in
it.

To conclude therefore this passage concerning the miracles (most of them done
in Africa at the memorial of S. Steph^n) reported by S. Austin in his foresaid
book de ciu. Dei, it is yet further to be observed, that the same are also
acknowledged and recorded by Euodius of whom thus writes S. Austin, at Lib. 22
de ciu. Dei. c. 8. and after the engl. trans. p. 888.
Vzaly near Vtica, have many miracles b^ne wrought by power of the said
martyr, (Stephen) where Bishop Euodius erected his memorial long before this of
ours. The same Euodius did accordingly publish a special treatise in 2. books

shall oppose his own bare unwarranted denial, we leave that man as much more
worthy of contempt then further reply: And thus much briefly concerning such
miracles collected from S. Austin, as do clearly convince what religion it was,
whether Catholic or Protestant, which was by him professed, and by miracles
thus confirmed.

Concerning such sayings of S. Austin as are usually objected by our
adversaries against his former Catholic doctrines, confessed for such by
Protestants, and confirmed by miracles. CHAPTER. 19.
Such places are answered, as are urged against the Canonical Scriptures:
against Traditions, and the authority of Councels. SECTION. 1.
AGainst the book of Machabees, M. Moulin obiecteth that S. Austin says,
Defense. p. 152.
The book of Machabees is received not unprofitably of the Church, if men read
it soberly: M. Moulin in the same place gives the answer him self, which in
substance is, that S. Austin said this as in respect of Razes killing himself,
whose example the Donatistes of indiscret zeal followed, in reguard whereof S.
Austin required this sobriety; explaning further there, and elsewhere Tom. 2.
ep. 61. post med.
(which Moulin omitteth) that, The Scripture of the Machabees haith, touching
Razes death, told how it was done, but not commended it as though it were to
be done. And in the book of Judges Cap. 16.30.
is reported the like of Sampson, whom yet the Apostle Hebrews. 11.32. and
Aug. de ciu. Dei. l. 1. c. 21.
commends.

Whereas M. Carthwright In Hookers Eccles. pol. l. 2. sec. 7. p. 118. 119.
obiecteth against unwritten traditions, certain obscure sayings of S.
Austin, and other Fathers: M. Hooker forbeareth not (in our so clear a case)
by his special explication and answer, to explain, and clear them to our
hands.

D. Fulke In Hookers Eccles. pol. l. 2. sec. 7. p. 118. 119.
obiecteth against the authority of Councels, that S. Austin teaches that,
Answer to a counterf. Cath. p. 89. And Aug. tom. 7. de Bapt. cont. Don. l. 2.
c. 3. post med.
general Councels themselves may be often amended, the former by the later,
when by some experience of things, that is opened which before was shut, and
that known which before was unknown: But his meaning here is only concerning
matters of fact, or at most but concerning such points of faith, as were by
former Councels, not erroneously determined, but only left vndefyned, and
afterward resolved upon by later Councels; for S. Austins words of Amendment
argue him not to speak of faith (seeing faith or heresy is not properly said
to be amended) but of matters of fact, which are subject to amendment. A truth
yet more evident in that this amendment is here said to come to pass by the
experience of things, unto which experience not doctrine of faith, but matters
of fact be properly subi^ct.

M. Jewel obiecteth Reply. art. 4. p. 272.
the testimony of S. Austin concerning Constantine the great, undertaking the
judgment of Bishops, and their cause upon appeal made to him in that behalf,
but M. 2. Reply. part. 2. p. 163.
Carthwright answeareth hereto in our behalf, that, Austin says, that the
Emperor was driven by the Donatistes importunity, who made no end of appealing
unto him, to give sentence in that matter, for the which also he was to crave
pardon of the Bishops. To which purpose also S. Austin, and Optatus have See
before c. chapter. 4. sec. 6.
formerly made their several, answeares.

Such places are answered, as are objected from S. Austin against Baptism by
women in case of necessity: And against the real presence. SECTION. 2.
Master Carthwright obiecteth against Baptism by women, the 4. Can. 100.
Carthage Council saying, In Whitguiftes def. tract. 9. c. 5. p. 523.
Let not a woman presume to Baptize: But his answer is given him by his
Protestant adversary M. Whitguift in these words, Ibidem.
that Canon inhibiteth women to Baptize in the open Church, and this (says he)
is a sufficient answer. with whom agrees Osiander, affirming that this
objected Canon is, Cent. 4. l. 1. c. 1. p. 19.
rightly understood, de Baptismate publico, of public Baptism.

Against the blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, some object S. Austin to call
it sometimes a sign or figure; but this we also acknowledge it to be, and the
same yet no more against our real presence, then confessedly it is against the
other not only Sacramental, but also real presence affirmed by Instit. l. 4.
c. 17. parag. 7. and 10. and 32. Iuel. reply. p. 341. Pol. In Syllog. p. 307.
Beza in ep. theol. ep. 5. p. 59.
Calvin, Jewel, Polanus, and Beza, by some of whom and others this seeming
difficulty is avoided and answered: for Calvin writes that. In omnes Pauli
ep. in 1. Cor. 11. p. 323.
whereas some gather from hence that Christ is absent from the supper, because a
memory (or remembrance) is not but of a thing absent, the answer is ready
etc. saying also of the Sacrament, Instit. de caena Dom. c. 12. p. 331.
It does not only figure (or represent) but also truly exhibit etc. And
again, Institut. l. 4. c. 17. sec. 10.
There is no cause that any should object that it is a figurative speech,
whereby the name of the thing signed is given to the sign. whereof other
Caluinistes also say Collatio Cath. orthod. etc. p. 548.
there is not any found amongst the Orthodoxal, who affirm the body of Christ
to be only figured or signified in the supper of the Lord: which also M. Bruce
explaineth yet more fully saying, Sermon upon the Sacrament page 10.
I call them signs, because they have the body and blood of Christ conjoined
with them, yea truly is the body and blood of Christ conjoined with the bread
etc. and not in respect only of their representation are they called signs.
But Beza writing to Alemannus, who objected against Bezaes foresaid real
presence (as the Caluinistes usually do against ours) an obscure sentence of S.
Austin, answeareth saying, Ep. theol. ep. 5. p. 59.
therefore that place of Austin in Psalm. 98. you are not to eat this body
which you see etc. thou art not so to take, as though it favored thy opinion,
for Austin does not so exclude al eating of the true body. In like manner also
answeareth Bucer saying, Scripta Anglicana. p. 678.
Here it is objected, that the holy Fathers, especiallly Austin, do call the
bread the sign of the Lords body. which he explaineth further saying. where do
the holy Fathers make the Sacramental signs, the signs of Christ absent; etc.
The Fathers call them signs, but they understand signs that do exhibit. And
the like answer is Tom. 7. Wittemberge. fol. 405.
given by Luther.

Hereby and otherwise is also answered that common objection taken from S.
Austin saying, Tom. 2. ep. 23. ad Bonifac. versus fin.
As in a certain manner the Sacrament of Christ's body, is the body of Christ,
the Sacrament of Christ's blood, is the blood of Christ, so the Sacrament of
faith, is faith: for Ep. ad Frudegardum.
Paschasius and Lib. cont. Berengarium.
Lanfranfrancus do answer this to be spoken of Christ's body and blood, as in
respect of the Cross, and that the external Sacrament of both kinds, though
being but (as in respect of his passion upon the Cross) a representation of
his body there crucified, and of his blood there shed might nevertheless in
respect of such representation, be termed the thing it self in such manner
suffering upon the Cross (for of that Immolation so once made in the words
there next before he speaks.) Algerus rests in the other answer before
mentioned, affirming the Sacrament to be called Christ's body both Lib. 10. de
sacram. Euchar.
properly and improperly, improperly, (says he) for as much as concerns the
species and form of the elements, properly, for as much as concerns the
sumbstance which it contains. And if S. Austin otherwise with Suinglius had
intended an only Sacramental representation, without real presence of the thing
it self thereto annexed, why then should he in the now objected words, term
Baptism a Sacrament of faith, and not a Sacrament of Christ's blood? This
point Carthwright observed, and therein disliked S. Austin, saying therefore as
to this now very objected sentence, In Whitguiftes def. tract. 16. p. 619.
I can not allow S. Austins reason which he makes, nor the proportion that is
between the Sacrament of the body and blood, and his body and blood it self
on the one side, and between the Sacrament of Baptism and faith on the other
side etc. whereas he should have said, that as the supper being the Sacrament of
the body of Christ, is after a sort the body of Christ, so baptism being a
Sacrament of the blood of Christ, is after a sort the blood of Christ: so many
ways are these common objections answered, and that by Protestants them
selves. Calvin Institut. l. 4. c. 17. parag. 34.
also obiecteth S. Austin as seeming to Tom 5. l. 21. de ciu. Dei. c. 25. verse.
fin.
deny that the wicked do receive the body of Christ in the Sacrament; in
explication hereof it is obserueable, that S. Austin mencioneth a double
receiving of Christ's body, the one only Sacramental, whereby is received
Christ's body present under the Sacramental forms of bread and wine, common
with the wicked and the good; the other spiritual, of which S. Austin to the
full clearing of this point says, Tom. 10. de verbis Domini. sermon. 2.
There is a certain manner of eating that flesh etc. according to which
whosoever eats remains in Christ etc. but after a certain manner. Now by
this spiritual together with the Sacramental receiving, is likewise received
the grace and spiritual effects of that body peculiar only to the good; and
this kind of receiving Christ's body it is which he denies to the wicked: In
which respect be commends those, Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 21. c. 25. ante med.
and prope fin.
who eat the body of Christ, not only in the Sacrament, but in very deed;
admonishing therefore that, Tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 27. versus fin.
we eat the flesh and blood of Christ not only in the Sacrament, which also
many wicked do, but that we eat it to the participation of the spirit. And
again, Ibidem. tract. 26. post med.
See brethren that you eat the heavenly bread spiritually; And yet most
pregnantly, Tom. 10. de verbis Apost. ser. 2. This sermon is cyted for S. Aust.
by Bid. in 1. Cor. 10. and ad Philip. c. 2.
The blood and body of Christ will be life to every one, if that which is taken
in the Sacrament visibly, be eaten spiritually (in ipsa veritate) in very
truth; explayning yet further of the wicked that Tom. 9. in Joan. tract. 26.
versus fin.
he does not eat his flesh spiritually etc. although he cut with his teeth the
Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ carnally and visibly. And lastly he
concludes as See before. c. 8. sec. 2.
before, that the wicked do according to the firster foresaid sense truly
receive Christ's body; And this so plainly that Bucer recyting the common
objection from S. Austin concerning panem Dominum, and panem Domini, concludes
nevertheless of the wicked saying, Scripta Anglicana. p. 679.
In how many places does Austin affirm, that they also receive the body and
blood of our Lord? how often does he write, that Judas himself received the
body and blood of the Lord?

In proof also against Incircumscription, it is urged that S. Austin says,
Ep. 57. ad Dardan.
Take space of places from bodies and they will be no where: And against the
being of a body in many places at once; It is likewise objected, that S. Austin
affirms of Christ, Lib. 20. cont. Faust. c. 11. post. med.
that he could not be at one time in the Sun, and in the Moon, and upon the
Cross: But Chemnitius answeareth for him self and us that Loc. com. part. 3.
fol. 195.
Austin when he disputes of the common law and order of nature, he says, If
spaces of places be taken away, bodies have not where to be, nor can be: But
yet he does not therefore deny, when the Scripture delivers that the body of
Christ entered through the doares being shut, where penetration of dimensions
being made, two bodies were in one place or place was wanting to a body, but he
affirms that by the power of the law of God, the law of nature does cease.
Auouching yet further hereof that, Al antiquity with one consent etc. does so
take it and understand it. But hereof we have spoken more largly See before. c.
^2 sec. 3.
heretofore.

Such places are answered, as are urged from S. Austin against invocation of
Saints, Images, and relics. SECTION. 3.
AGainst invocation of Saints, M. Moulin Defense. etc. englished. art. 8. p.
199.
obiecteth these words of S. Austin, Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. 22. c. 10. circ.
med.
At which sacrifice etc. martyrs are named in their place and order, but they
are not inuocated by the Priest who sacrifices. S. Austin hereby only
means, that in the act of sacrifycing due only to God, not martyrs but only
God him self is inuocated or sacrifyced unto: accordingly as he most evidently
explaineth him self in the same treatise saying, Ibidem. l. 8. c. 27. prope
init. And tom. 6. cont. Fast. Manich. l. 20. c. 21.
who of the faithful ever heard the Priest standing at the Altar etc. to pray,
I offer sacrifice to thee o Peter, o Paul, or o Ciprian; This therefore is the
only invocation, to wit, by way of sacrifice, which he impugneth.

M. Mouling also Vbi supra. art. 8. p. 198.
urges these other words of S. Tom. 7. l. 2. cont. Parmen. c. 8. ante et post
med.
Austin Permenianus in a certain place makes the Bishop mediator between God
and the people etc. If therefore Paul should be a mediator etc. the reason of
Paul should not be good, wherein he said one God, one mediator etc. whereupon
Moulin infers that S. Austin said thus as against mediatorship or
intercession: But D. Orthodoxus Iacobus. p. 48.
Gordan, though obiecting this saying, yet explaineth there from S. Austines
other words in the same place, that this does not take away our mutual
intercession one for another, showing further also that, Ibidem. p. 45.
Christ is the mediator of God and men (not because he is the only mediator of
intercession but) because in him being one, God and man are joined. As for
Parmenian the Donatist, his error being, that the grace of the Sacrament did so
depend upon the goodness of the Priest, that a good Priest Baptising did
sanctify, and that the evil Priest Baptising did defile; this tying so of grace
to the Preistes personal goodness, did (as S. Austin argues against it)
consequently infer, that the Priest should be the mediator of grace and
redemption, which is the point that S. Austin confuteth in the place objected.

Against pictures and relics this place of S. Austin is ordinarily objected,
Tom. 1. de moribus Eccles. c. 34. post med.
do not follow the troops of ignorant men, who in their very religion are
superstitious etc. I know that there are many worshipers of sepulchers and
pictures. I know that there are many who drink most riotously over the dead,
and bringing banquets to the dead bodies, they bury themselves over those that
are buried, and ascribe their gluttony and drunkenness to religion. This he
spoke not as against al religious reverence done before the pictures, or at the
monuments of the dead Saints or martyrs, but only as against those who put
the same in practice promiscuously to or before the picture or sepulcher of any
dead person, whether martyr or other, and the same also not without luxurious
excess of drinking: This superstitious and ignorant abuse he there taxes, as
also elsewhere saying, Tom. 2. ep. 63. Aurelio. circa med.
drunkenness an ryetous banquets in Churchyards, were thought by the carnal and
ignorant people, not only to be the honors of Martyrs, but also the comforts
of the dead. Besides this we have seen See before. c. 14. sec. 3. 4.
before S. Austins acknowlegment of the reverence due to profitable signs, and
relics: As also the orderly usage Tom. 1. l. 6. confess. c. 2. and tom. 5. de
ciu. Dei. l. 8. c. 27. ante med.
of bread and wine etc. at the sepulchers of Saints, which him self
reports his own mother Monica to have practiced, until the contrary upon
just occasion was prohibited by S. Ambrose. And he yet further says, Tom. 2.
ep. 42. ad Madaurenses. circa med.
you have seen etc. the highest top of the most noble Empire (or the Emperor)
bowing dowen his crown to pray at the sepulcher of Peter the fisher: But of S.
Austines allowance of pictures, and relics, we have seen more largly See
before. c. 14. sect. 3. 4.
before.

Such places are answered as are urged from S. Austin against Purgatory.
SECTION. 4.
DOctor Fulke Against Rhem. test. in 1. Cor. 3. sec. 6. fol. 267.
obiecteth these words of S. Austin Tom. 7. Hypognost. cont. Pelag. l. 5.
The third place we are utterly ignorant of: But S. Austin said this as only
against the Pelagians who (as M. Of the Church l. 5. c. 19. p. 71. And see the
same in Danaeus in Isagog. Christ. part. 4. p. 557.
Field confesses) taught that there was besides heaven, and hell, another third
place of everlasting continuance for such children as dyed unbaptized. Now in
respective co^futatio^ of this said imaginary third place of everlasting rest,
S. Austin said as is objected: otherwise how full and resolute S. Austin was
concerning Purgatory, and prayer for the dead we have clearly seen See
before. c. 14. sec. 1.
before, and for such confessed by Protestants.

But D. Against Rhem. test. in 1. Cor. 3. sec. 6. fol. 267.
Fulke further obiecteth, that S. Austin says, Tom. 3. Enchirid. c. 69. init.
et 68. post. init.
It is not incredible that some such thing is done after this life, and it may
be inquired of, whether it be so and either be found or hid: S. Austin uttered
these words not as being doubtful of Purgatory, but only whether that some of
the faithful after this life be saved so much later or sooner by a certain
Purgatory fire, as they more or less loved their transitory goods. So that
his doubt there is not, whether there be any Purgatory, which by the very
words objected is rather supposed, and in this very same book is confessedly
affirmed, but, only (as he yet further in this place objected, explaineth him
Ibidem. c. 68, post init.
self) whether that such affection to worldly things lawfully enjoined (as to
wife, children and) that without grief of mind he cannot part with them, be
punished in Purgatory or not. This only is his doubt, and may by us yet be
doubted of, but without al scruple or doubt of Purgatory in him or us.

Such places are answered, as are v^ged from S. Austin against justification
by works, freewil, and merit of works. SECTION. 5.
VVEreas some object in behalf of justification by faith, and against works,
that S. Austin in some places affirms only faith to justify. This is
explained and answered (...) See before. c. 13. s^c. 2. and 3.
by D. Whitaker, and Melancthon, both of them affirming that S. Austin in those
places only intends to seclude such works from justification as go before
faith, not such as follow; which is the same which we al teach.

Others likewise object certain places which seem to make against freewil; but
in those places S. Austin writ against the Pelagians, who to much enhabled
freewil, and natural works, as of them selves sufficient Tom. 2. ep. 200. ad
Asellicum.. multo ante med. an ep. 89. ad Hillarium. quaest. 2. init.
without grace, which does nothing prejudice us, disclaming in the sufficiency
either of freewil or works without Gods grace. But Hemingius does answer
this objection very directly saying, Lib. de universally gratia. p. 105.
As often as Austin weakneth freewil, he speaks against the opinion of
Pelagius, for otherwis^ he often attributes freewil to man, and confesses
that man without freewil can neither live well nor sin etc. nor that there is
any place for rewards or punishments: wherefore it is diligently to be
observed, in wh^^ respect freewil is some times affirmed and sometimes denied by
S. Austin.

Such places are answered as are objected from S. Austin concerning vows,
miracles, and Ceremonies. SECTION. 6.
SOme object certain places De sancta virginitate. c. 34. de bono viduitatis.
c. 9. and 10. and ep 72. ad Bonifacium.
of S. Austin to make for the marriage of votaries, as that such marriage
should be in force and not void: In answer hereto, and to other like
objected sayings from S. Lib. 1. ep. 11. Epiph. haer. 61.
Ciprian, Epiphanius, and others, it is to be observed, that there is a double
vow, the one private or simple, wherein is nothing but the parties bare
promise, the other termed a solemn vow, wherein is not only a promise, but
a delivery also made of the thing promised, whereof the Church takes solemn
acceptance, and the party is thereupon by the Church specially consecrated to
Christ: In the firster case, the marriage though sinful by breach of the simple
vow, is yet in force, and of this vow are the Fathers objected sayings
understood; but in the other foresaid case where the thing promised is solemnly
delivered over the special consecration of the party, al pretended marriage is
a mere nullety, and so by S. Austin and other Fathers adjudged; for in this
case any pretended marriage is termed by the fourth Can^. 104.
Carthage Council, crimen adulterij, the sin of adultery, and therefore
nothing less then marriage; in so much as Osiander reprehendeth this Canon, as
affirming Cent. 5. l. 1. c. 1. p. 20.
spiritual marriage betwixt consecrated widows and Christ. And it is further
termed Adultery by S. Ep. 6. ad Theodor. Basil. de vera virginit. Ambros. ad
virg. laps. c. 5. Aug. Tom 8. in Psalm. 83. multo ante med. Innocent. ep. ad
Victoricum. c. 12. 13. Council. 2. Turon. can. 21. whereof see the Centuristes.

tradit. Apost. part. 3. l. 3. col. 814.
Chrysostom, S. Basil, S. Ambrose, S. Austin, S. Innocentius, and by S.
Hierome, not only adultery but incest. And S. Innocentius mencioneth the
former distinction of simple and solemn vow, affirming of the first, that the
breach thereof is sinful, but the marriage true, but of the latter, that it is
adultery and not marriage.

D. Fulke Confut. of Purgat. p. 333.
obiecteth S. Tom. 7. de unit. Eccles. c. 19. prope init.
Austin as disclaming from miracles; it is answered that S. Austin writing
against the Donatistes, who bragged of their secret apparitions (commmon
likewise to the Protestants Hacket, Carolastadius, Suinglius, and Luther) which
he termed the false reports of lying men, or else the wonders of deceiving
spirits, does not reject, but in that spe^ial disputation only forbear the
argument of miracles, especially seeing that the miracles whereof the Donat^stes
so bragged, were (though granted for true) but such as the Devil might bring
to pass, as not exceeding the power of nature. But as concerning such true
miracles as exceed al power of nature and secundary causes, as curing the
diseased without means of physic, raising of the dead etc. these are urged
by Tom. 5. de ciu. Dei. l. ^2. c. ^.
S. Austin him self as a strong argument against the Pagans: In so much that
he numbering up Tom. 6. cont. ep. fundam. c. 4. ante med.
the many things that held him in the Churches bosom, names expressly
miracles for one.

Against Ceremonies sundry Fulke against Rhem. test. in Gal. 4.3. sec. 3.
Morton in his appeal. p. 53 Calvin, institut. l. 4. c. 10. sec. 13.
Protestants do object S. Tom. 2. ep. 119. c. 19.
Austin; but he in the very place objected explaineth him self to speak only
against such, which neither are contained in the authorities of Scriptures, nor
found to be decreed in the Councels of Bishops nor strengthened with the custom
of the universal Church etc. so that scarce, or not at al, can reasons be found
which people followed in the making of them. To which purpose also M. Wh^^guif^
directly answeareth to this place objected saying, Defense. tra^^. 10. c. 2. p.
545.
Austin. ep. 119. speaks but of unprofitable ceremonies etc. neither grounded
upon the Scriptures, determined by Councels, nor confirmed by custom.

A further answer ingeneral to al such objections as are urged from S.
Austin, or others of the Fathers. SECTION. 7.
AS concerning al these and such other like triuial and unworthy objections so
often from S. Austin and the other Fathers by our adversaries reenforced and
urged, and by our writers more then often explained and answered, we do hereby
once for all premonish and commend to the readers remembrance these few further
general observations next ensuing, in more full explanatio^ of these and other
like occurring obscure sayings of S. Austin and other Fathers wherein (as our
adversaries acknowledge Beza ep. theol. ^p. 82. p. 382. Snecanus method.
descript. p. 429. Chemnitius examen. part. 1. fol. 80. White in his way to the
true Church. pref. to the reader, sec. 17.
and answer) they could not possibly fore see to write of al things so
distinctly and clearly, as is now to be wished.

The first then is, that (according to the direction even given by Protestants)
we do understand the obscure saying of any Father, agreeably to his many more
plainer sayings delivered in other places of the same matter: and much more
then that we do not insist upon any seeming doubtful saying against those many
more which are plain, and for such confessed. Of this observation Snecanus
method. descript. p. 414.
Snecanus alleges Tertulian saying, It is fit that the fewer be understood by
the more. And again, lest one speech should overthrow many others, it is to be
expounded according to al, rather then against al. Hereof also says Pezelius,
In argument. ^t object. p. 254.
A profitable rule in teaching is delivered, that it is fit that the few be
understood by the more. M. Carthwright yet says further, 2. Reply. part. 1. p.
627.
If it be a simple answer to set one author against another, it is much more
simple to set one authority at varience with it self, without showing any way
of reconciliation.

And yet what more frequent with Protestants then this simple kind of answer
for does not D. Whitaker, in steed of better answer say, De sacra Scriptura.
p. 690.
though (Austin) in this place seems to favor Traditions, yet in other places
he defend^th earnestly the perfection of the Scripture. And of S. Basil he
likewise says concerning the same traditions, Ibidem. p. 670.
he fights with him self. And De principiis Christ. dog. l. 2. c. 10. p. 675.
Lubertus says, I oppose Basil against Basil. As also, Whitaker. vbi supra p.
678.
Chrysostom fights with him self. And, Lubertus. vbi supra. p. 676.
I oppose Chrysostom to Chrysostom. Neither Ibidem. p. 678.
does Damascen agree with him self. The like simple answer is given by
Hospinian against S. Austin saying, Hist. sacram. part. 1. in indice 3. Patru^.
at the word Augustinus. col. 3.
He wants the testimony of Scripture* neither agrees he with him self, yea,
he contradicts him self. Of whom also says Synopsis de Patribus. p. 34.
Tossanus, Austin is often wavering, and not agreeing with him self in all
things. with these also answeareth no less simply Malancthon saying, In ep.
ad Romans in c. 14. p. 418.
I know many things may be gathered out of the ancient (writers) which are
contrary to our opinions etc. I provoke not to all the writers, ^ut to the
better sort, Ambrose, Austin, and as far forth as the rest agree with these,
who seeing they sometimes speak contrary things, they shall give us leave if
we reprehend some things. But Beza extends this simple kind of answer yet
further, for speaking of the ancient Fathers in Theodosius his time, he says,
In nou. Test. in praefat. ad principem Condensem. p. 4.
I confess that as then there were many most learned Bishops, but withal I
affirm etc. that scarce any of them can be found, who differs not, both from
him self, and from many others in matters of greatest moment. Calvin also
having mecioned the ancient Fathers and better writers of this age, says of
them, Instit. in praefat. ad Regem. Gal. p. 7.
Those holy men were ignorant of many things, they do often feight amongst
them selves, and sometimes with them selves. And the like says Peter Mart^r, De
votis. p. 463.
that chiefly is to be observed that the Fathers do not always agree amongst
them selves, and sometimes not one with him self.

Wherefore to omit this kind of simple answer, as in it self base, to the
Fathers injurious, and used only by such as find them selves galled, or rather
condemned by the same Fathers, seeing the forementioned objections of our
adversaries taken from S. Austin, being at the least but places obscure and
questionable, and those other by us alleged being plain, and for such by the
learned Protestants acknowl^dged, it were absurd and against al sequel of
reason, either to urge these places as one contrary to another, or to expound
and determine the sense of those that be so confessedly plain and out of
question, by these other whose sense is obscure, doubtful, and yet depending in
question; which only observation being in it self so clear and manifest,
suffices of it self to dissolve all the foresaid, and other objections framed
from S. Austin or other Fathers by so many Protestant writers.

The second observation is, that we also understand the Fathers doubtful
sayings according to the then common received opinion of the other Fathers, as
is by S. Austin him self in this case confessedly observed: for whereas
Iulianus the heretic, to prove that children are without original sin,
objected this sentence of S. Chrysostom, we baptize Infantes though they have
no sins: S. Austin teaches how to understand this obscure sentence saying,
Tom. 7. contra Julian. Pelag. l. 1. c. 6. multo ante med.
intellige propri^, understand it of sins of their own, (or actual) and
there is no contention; but thou will say, why did not (Chrysostom) ad
propria, their own? why do we think but because disputing in a Catholic
Church, he thought he should not be otherwise understood, nobody was troubled
with such a question, you not as then wrangling, he spoke securely. This point
and very example is observed by Peter Common places in english. part. 2. p. 228.
Martyr, as also by Chemnitius, who thereupon observes and infers Examen.
part. 1. fol. 80. And see Snecanus in method. descript. p. 429. 430. 432.
that, In this sort Austin, de natura et gratia, applies the sentences of
Hillary, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Hierome, which Pelagius had alleged in
confirmation of his error, according to the Analogy of faith, adding a fit
interpretation.

Now according to this observation and practice of S. Austin al. our
adversaries mistaken obiection^ from him are again at once determined by the
confessed contrary doctrine in the next Chapters alleged from the other
Fathers, that severally lived in the same age with S. Austin, and in the other
ages next before and after him. As also according to both these foresaid rules
may easily be avoided that pretended necessity of childrens receiving the
Eucharist under pain of damnation, wherewith S. Austin is by D. Answer to a
counterf. Catholic. p. 87.
Fulke and many others so often and so seriously mischarged. For hereto it may
be answered, that in S. Austines opinion* children in Baptism received the
effect of the other Sacrament, without which vertual communicating he thought
them not saved: otherwise that he did not think their Sacramental receiving of
the Eucharist necessary appears, first, in that he taught before, that in
Baptism was a plena^^ remission of al sins. Secondly in that our adversaries
cannot allege any his saying affirming directly to to the point, that a
Baptized child dying before his communicating is damned. Thirdly in that S.
Austin teaches that Sermon. ad Infantes apud Bedam. in 1. Cor. 10. And see Tom.
7. l. 1 de pec. mer. et rem. c. 19. and tom. 5. de ciuit. Dei. l. 21. c. 16.
and after the english transl. p. 856.
none ought any ways to doubt, but that every one of the faithful is made
partaker of the body and blood of our Lord, when he is made in Baptism a
member of Christ, and that he is not estranged from the fellowship of that
bread and Chalice, although before he eat that bread, and drink the Chalice,
he depart out of this world being in the unity of the body of Christ, This
point is so clear in S. Austin as that the Cent. 5. c. ^. col. 604.
Centuristes do in particular free him from this impution.

As for S. Austines communicating to Infants (but without al opinion of the
necessity before supposed) we grant his doctrine thereof: A doctrine likewise
houlden good not only by S. Ciprian, who recyteth a Sermon. de lapsis. circ. med.
memorable miracle concurring therewith, and one in his own presence; But also
Musculus, who makes true and Loc. com. e. de caena Dom. p. 34^.
direct answer to those words of S. Paul, Let a man prove him self, and
alleges Ibid. p. 341.
the ancient Churches judgment and practice in proof thereof. A doctrine also
still defended Lib. ep. Oecolam. et Suing. p 305. 329.
by the Bohemians.

The third observation is, that according to our adversaries own Chemnitius
examen. part. 1. fol. 80. Snecanus method. de script. p. 290. Bancroftes
survey. p. 336. Humfrey in Jesuit. part. 2. rat. 5. p. 501. and rat. 2. p. 129.
and see S. Basil. ep. 64.
rule, we do discern the Fathers sayings by them uttered in heat or feruor of
disputation, from those other which they write dogmatically; for that in the
first kind, the Fathers being more attent and busied how to convince and
overcome, then always precisely obseruant or circumspect of their manner of
speaking (which they never doubted would be understood otherwise then according
to the Catholic received sense, even as next here before S. Austin expounded
and excused S. Chrysostom) their meaning may the more colourably be mistaken:
In which respect such their objected sayings (as namely those commonly urged
against freewil, and merit of works, taken from S. Austins disputation with
the Pelagians who enhabled these as available without grace) are not houlden
so conuincing or fit for argument; which few observations thus propounded being
but duly observed, by the studious and indifferent reader, will suffice to
deliver him from the doubtful laborinth of al vprising objected difficulties.
And thus much briefly in answer to all the objections pretended from S.
Austin, wherein our adversaries most colorable endeavor is, but to make him
no further contrary to us, then confessedly therein he should be contrary to
him self, which is nothing; he being in very deed so plain in our behalf,
and so far from Luthers new erected doctrine, that one of Luthers scholars
blushed not to say, Alberus contra Carolastadianos. l. 7. And see the like in
Musculus in praefat. in libel. Ger. de diaboli tyrannide. And Hospin. hist.
sacram. part. 1. fol. 346.
I doubt not but if that Austin were non living, he would not be (...) to
pr^fe^^e him self Luthers scholar.

Concerning the doctrine and religi^a of the other Fathers in general, and also
of those who lived in the age of S. Austin: And that it was the same with the
doctrine* and religion here formerly taught by S. Austin, and at this day
taught by the Catholic Roman Church. CHAPTER. 20.
The Fathers in general and who lived in the age of S. Austin confessedly
taught the same doctrine with him concerning Christ being our mediator only
according to his humanity; concerning the sacred Scriptures. and traditions.
SECTION. 1.
Having thus hitherto entreated of the religion professed by S. Austin to whom
above all the Fathers Protestants do usually make their bouldest claim, a^
pretending him to make most for them, and against us: Hereby I hope
sufficiently appears, what is to be expected in this kind from the other
Fathers; for if D. Boys does acknowledge that, Exposition of the dominic.
epist. the winter part. p. 253. and see before. c. 1.
the most indifferent for both parties among the Fathers is Austin, who yet
stands so adverse against them, as we have formerly seen by all the
premises, much more adverse then in all probability are the other Fathers. And
for so much as the further explanation of the other Fathers judgments yealdeth
a yet further strong proof of S. Austires See before in the pref. to the
learned adversary.
professed like consenting religion, and that in reguard of my enjoined and
affected breuity, I have not opportunity to demonstrate the same from the other
Fathers own alledgedged sayings at large, I will now therefore only ad (as in
full satisfaction of al reasonable readers) a breife recytal of our learned
adversaries them selves, charging and reproving the Fathers indefinitly, or else
sundry of them at once, and charging also diverse of those who lived in S.
Austins age with their known confessed judgments and practice in particular
of our Catholic faith.

First then in proof of our Saviors office of mediatorship only according to
his haman nature, Calvin him self denying it, yet says of the Fathers Instit.
l. 2. c. 14. sec. 3. and Beza in ep. theol. ep. 28. p. 174.
herein the error of the ancient Fathers cannot be excused.

In like sort concerning the canonical Scriptures the Protestant Poliander
says. See before. c. 3. sec. 2.
to come now to the error of some Councels, the Councels of Carthage, and
Florence, having rouled for Canonical books, and as divinely inspired etc. the
books of Tobie, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and the Machabees etc. and
the Popes Innocentius, and Gelasius, have reckoned these books among the
canonical. And the like is formerly confessed by sundry other Protestants.

Traditions are so fully taught by the Fathers, as that for teaching the same

see Schrod^^us in opusc. theol. p. 72.
Chrysostom, Epiphanius, Tertulian* Ciprian, Austin, Innocentius, Leo, Basil,
Eusebius Damascen.

The Fathers in general are confessed to teach the Primacy Ecclesiastical of of
Peter, and the Bishops of Rome: As also to deny supreme Ecclesiastical
government to temporal Princes; and that the Pope is not Antichrist. SECTION. 2.
COncerning S. Peter, and his then successors, Bishops of Rome in the foresaid
ancient times; sundry of the Fathers are by Protestants reprehended for their
affirming the Church to be builded upon Peter, whereof Calvin says, Instit l.
4. e. 6. parag. 6.
Some of the Fathers have so expounded (those words super hanc Petram) but all the Scripture cries the contrary. Danaeus also says of the Fathers, Resp. ad
Bellar. part. 1. p. ^77.
the saying of Christ, thou art Peter etc. they have noughtily expounded of the
person of Peter. And the Cent. 3. col. 84. 85. and cent. 4 col. 1250. and col.
1141. and col. 555. 557. 558.
Centuristes do expressly reprehend and charge many of the ancient Fathers with
this opinion. D. Fulke affirms that (not some few Confut of the Papists
quarrels. p. 4.
but) many of the ancient Fathers etc. were deceived to think something more
of Peter's prerogative, and the Bishops of Romes dignity, then by the word of
God was given to either of them: In so much as in reguard of the Roman Bishops
then c^aimed and enjoyed Primacy, Protestants fear not to affirm, that the
Roman Bishops in the time of Constantine the great, were very Antichrists*
whereof writes M. In Apocalip. p. 539.
Brightman, Antichrist haith reigned from the time of Constantine the great to
this very day: And speaking of the Pope of Rome he says, Ibidem. p. 477. and
see p. 471.
for these thousand three hundred years he is that Antichrist; whom M. Nappier
names Upon the revel. p. 362. 85 88. 75. 68. And see Gauuius in Palma
Christiana. p. 34.
to be Siluester the first.

But Protestants forbear not to reprove and charge with affected and usurped
Primacy, even S. Peter him self, and the other next to him succeeding bishops
of Rome, for of this certain Caluinistes write thus, Catalogus testium
veritatis tom. 1. p. 27.
It may not be denied but that Peter was sometimes faulty in ambition and desire
of power etc. by which infirmity of Peter, doubtless it was signified, that
those Bishops which bragged of Peter's succession, were to be faulty of the
like, yea with greater ambition by infinite degrees etc. wherefore this so
perverse abition of Peter and ignorance of heavenly things, and negligence
withal etc. did without doubt signify that the Roman Bishop, because he would
be chief and heir of Peter's privileges, was to be ignorant and a contemner
of heavenly things, and one desirous of human riches, power, and pleasures. To
which purpose also avouches another Protestant writer that, Philippus
Nicholai, in comment. de regno Christi. p. 221.
The affectation of Primacy was a common infirmity of the Apostles, as also of
the first Bishops of the City of Rome.

Hence also it is that the ancient Fathers did confessedly reprove some
Emperors of their times for usurping of Ecclesiastical government, of which
thus write the Centuristes, Cent. 4. c. 7. col. 54^.
The Emperors also did sometimes assume to them selves unseasonably the
judgment of matters of faith, which Athanasius reprehendeth in Constantius,
and Ambrose in Valentinian: of which latter also says Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 9. p.
477. And D. Downham in his defense. l. 1. c. 8. p. 162. 163.
Osiander, Ambrose answered, o Emperor, do not trouble thy self to think
that thou have any imperial right over heavenly things, do not extol thy self
etc. with whom agrees M. 2. Reply. part. 2. p. 161. 162. 155. 156.
Carthwright adding further, Ambrose says, it was not read nor h^ard of
before, that any Emperor was judge over a Bishop in a cause of faith; which
was not the judgment of Ambrose only but of other Bishops round about. Of
which point also Polanus alleges Symphonica. e. 22. These. 2. p. 836. 837.
838. 839. 841. 842. 843. 844. 849.
sundry testimonies of the ancient Fathers.

Concerning Antichrist whose coming, person, and continuance were no doubt
plainly and faithfuly delivered by the Apostles to their followers, and from
them successively continued in the Church of God, in better forewarning and
discovery of the monster when he should appear: And first as touching the time
of his coming, foretold not to be before the end of the Roman Empire, M.
Fulke confesses saying, Against Rhem. test. in 2. These. 2.3. sec. 4.
Indeed most of the ancient Fathers did judge that the Roman Empire should
first be decayed before Antichrist were reveled: whereof also says Calvin, In
2. These. 2.3.
for as much as they have expounded this place of the defection of the Roman
Empire, it is more frivolous then that it needs any long confutation, and I
do marvel that so many writers otherwise learned and witty, have been deceived
in so easy a thing, but that when one had erred, the rest without judgment
followed in troops: which their pretended error was for sooth, because they
did not agree in the said exposition with the Fulke in his answer to a
counterf. Cath. p. 27. 36. Downham of Antichrist. l. 1. p. 4. Willet in synops.

preserved and in being.

As concerning the person of Antichrist, M. Whitaker says, Lib. de
Antichristo. p. 21
The Fathers for the most part thougt that Antichrist should be but one man,
but in that, as in many other things they erred: whereof also says 2. Repl.
part. 1. p. 508
Carthwright, diverse of the ancient and chiefest of them imagined fondly of
Antichrist, as of one singular person: for which doctrine also the Fathers are
charged with error by Hist. Antichristi. p. 11.
Gracerus.

Now as for the short time of the height of his persecution, M. Fox confesses
that In Apoc. c. 12. p. 345.
Almost all the holy and learned interpreters do by a time. times, and half a
time, understand only three years and a half. Affirming further this to be,
Ibid. p. 362.
the consent and opinion of almost all the ancient Fathers: In further proof
thereof also says Bullinger, Upon the revel. englished in c. 11. ser. 46. fol.
142.
doubtless al expositors in a manner, grounding them selves upon this text, have
attributed to the kingdom of Antichrist, and to his most cruel persecutions,
no more them three years and a half.

The Fathers in general are confessed to teach our Catholic doctrines
concerning the Sacrament of Baptism. SECTION. 3.
IN proof of the efficacy of Sacraments, and of the grace given thereby
Suinglius writes, Tom. 2. de bapt. fol. 70.
Here most of the doctors understanding by the name of water, that material and
external water of Baptism, have attributed unto it much more then was fit,
whereupon it afterward came to pass, that they ascribed the clensing of
souls to the element of water. Of which also says Luther, Tom. 2. Wit^emberg.
fol. 229.
I excuse the Fathers, who driven either by temptation, or necessity, stoutly
denied sin to remain after Baptism: In so much as Calvin acknowledges, See
before. c. 6. sec. 1.
the ancient Churches judgment coneerning concupisence remaining after
Baptism not to be sin, without our consent thereto; And he and others also do
reprehend See before. c. 5. sec. 1.
the Fathers for preferring the efficacy of our Sacraments before the other
Sacraments of the old Testament.

In like manner concerning the necessity of Baptism, Musculus grants that,
Loc. com. p. 308.
some Fathers, amongst who^ is Austin, have subjected Infantes dying without
Baptism, to damnation; Of the generality of which opinion we have spoken See
before. c. 6. sec. 3.
before. And whereas M. In his appeal. p. 244.
Morton insteede of answer hereto, obiecteth as from the Fathers their like
supposed erroneous necessity of childrens receiving the Eucharist, that this
necessity was not as in respect of salvation, but by him mistaken, I have
showed See before. c. 19. sec. 7.
already. Yea the Fathers were so resolute herein that as Calvin testifyeth
Instit. l. 4. c. 15. sec. 20.
of them, it was usual many ages since, even almost from the beginning of the
Church, that in danger of death Lay people might baptize, if the minister was
not present in due time: And Conference at Hampton court. p. 18.
the denying of private persons in case of necessity to baptize, were to cross
al antiquity, says D. Bilson. And as for the Ceremonies of Baptism, and the
Eucharist, Beza says, Ep. theol. ep. 8. p. 79.
I cannot sufficiently admire all that decking, wherewith the most ancient
thought to adorn Baptism and the Lords supper: And having recyted sundry of
these ceremonies he calls them Ibid. p. 80.
stagelike fooleries, affirming further that, those who make the Apostles
authors of these fooleries, are not worthy of confutation, how ancient writers
so ever they be. Zepperus also having mentioned holy water, salt, Oil,
Exorcisme, Spitle, etc. says hereof, Politia Eccles. l. 1. c. 12. p. 123.
I confess these superstitious ceremonies are very ancient in the Church,
being not many ages after the Apostles times; whereof also see Echartus Compend.
theol. l. 1. c. 8. p. 204.
alleging these ceremonies from the Fathers.

The Fathers ingeneral are confessed for our Catholic doctrines concerning
the Sacraments of Confirmation, Orders, and Extreme unction. SECTION. 4.
COncerning Confirmation, it is reported how that M. The conference at Hampton
court. p. 10. And Downhams defense. l. 4. p. 23.
Whitguift showed at large the antiquity of confirmation, as being used in the
Church ever since the Apostles times. And the ministers of Lincoln diocese
charge Abripgment. p. 41.
Tertulian, Ciprian, Ambrose, with error of using the Cross in confirming
those that were baptized: whereto the Century writers ad the Fathers further
confessed usage of Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 478.
Chrisme in Confirmation; wherein Bucer yet further acknowledges that in the
Primitive Church it was done with Scripta Anglicana. p. 570.
hand-imposing only of a Bishop.

As touching Orders, D. Field avouches that Of the Church l. 5. c. 25. p. 121.
and the Centuristes. cent. 3. c. 7. col. 149. 150.
there is no question but that the minor Orders of Subdeacons, Acolites,
Exorcistes Lectors and Ostiaries, are very ancient; alleging further in
proof thereof S. Ciprian and many other Fathers.

And as for Extreme unction, M. Whitaker answearing to the ancient Fathers
objected testimonies in behalf thereof, confesses saying, Contra Duraeum. l.
8. p. 650.
I acknowledge the superstitious custom of this unction to have continued
longer in the Church then was meet.

The Fathers in general are confessed for our Catholic doctrines concerning
Confession, satisfaction and pardons. SECTION. 5.
THe Century writers speaking of those auncientest times of Ciprian, and
Tertulian, affirm that, Cent. 3. c. 6. col. 127. and cent. 4. c. 6. col. 425.
they gave absolution from sins thus, if any did penance they should first
confess their sin, for so does Tertulian in his book de paenitentia,
greatly urge confession, and it appears by certain places of Ciprian, that
private confession was usual, wherein they confessed their sins and wicked
thoughts, as in sermon. 5. de lapsis. et l. 3. epist. ep. 14. and 16. where he
expressly says, of lesser sins also, which are not committed against God, it
is needful that confession be made, and this also he often commands to be. l.
1. ep. 3. etc. that satisfaction also was accustomed to be imposed according to
the offense, it appears sermon. 5. de lapsis. And whereas M. Morton affirms
against this confession of the Centuristes that, Appeal. l. 2. c. 14. parag.
2. p. 254.
Ciprian mencioneth not sins of thought: May it please him to read Ciprian.
sermon. 5. de Multo post med.
lapsis, where he thus writes, but because they have but thought hereof, let
them confess this sorrowfully and simply to the Preistes of God etc. they
disburden their minds, they seek for wholesome cure, though but for little and
small wounds etc. I beseech you brethren that every one confess his sin
etc. whiles satifaction and remission made by the Preistes is grateful with our
Lord. And the same necessity of private confession is Ep. 91. ad Theodor. et
ep. 80. ad Episc. Campaniae. Basil in quaest. breu. interrogat. 288. And see
further Ciprian. l. 3. epist. 16. 17.
taught by S. Leo, and S. Basil.

As for the common objection to the contrary of Confession abrogated by
Nectarius (urged by M. Appeal. p. ^56.
Morton:) admmitting the story for true, it is answered thereto first, that the
confession abrogated by Nectarius, was not private, but public confession,
sometimes by penitents upon devotion voluntarily used. This he abrogated upon
occasion of scandale in a particular cause thence ensuing, as appears by
Cassidorus Hist. tripart. l. 9. c. 35.
his more ancient translation, and whereof see Bellarmine De penit. l. 3. c. 14.
more at large. Secondly I answer that the fact of Nectarius is reprehended
by Lib. 7. c. 16. finc.
Sozomen the reporter thereof, as giving occasion unto desolute life. Thirdly I
say that thereby was only abrogated at the most, not al confession, but a then
late precedent, and there mentioned particular order for Confession to be made
unto the penitentiary parish Priest, leaving the penitents at liberty to resort
for confession elsweare. Fourtly, whereas the Nouatian heretics were condemned
for that they denied Preistes power to remit sin (and consequently thereby
confession) that these also were the men, who then first impugned this
appointed penitentiary Priest, appears by the reporters of this objection
Lib. 5. c. 19. and Soz. l. 7. c. 16.
Socrates, and Sozomen, who likewise do further Soc. l. 5. c. 10. Soz. l. 7. c.
12.
report how much Nectarius depended upon the advice and counsel (in other
matters) of the same Nouatians; which is also acknowledged Cent 4. col. 862. ct
1129.
by the Centuristes, and for which he is by Osiander Cent. 4. l. 4. c. 13. p.
486.
termed Nectarius Bishop of small judgment and counsel in matters of
divinity. In reguard of al which several premises, what can this suspected and
perplexed fact of Nectarius, who is therein also reprehended Cent. 4. c. 7 col.
501.
by the Centuristes, prevail against the confessed clear stream and current
of al antiquity?

Furthermore concerning Penance and satisfaction, the Century writers speaking
of the 4. age, do therein hold Cent. 4. col. 294. and see col. 231.
reproueable the Fathers of that age, and the other ages precedent: Calvin also
houlding herein, Instit. l. 4. c. 12. parag. 8. and l. 3. c. 4. parag. 38.
inexcusable the immoderate austerity of the ancient Fathers, as wholly
different (says he) from the Lords commandment. And, I am not Ignorant
(says Examen. part. 4. p. 68.
Chemnitius) that the ancient do sometimes commend that canonical discipline
over largely, and with over great words. whereof also says Libelli aliquot.
fol. 11.
Melancthon, All the Nicene Council being overcome with the consent of the
multitude and time, approved the Canons of Penance. M. Whitaker adds yet more
expressly that, Contra Camp. rat. 5. p. 78.
the Fathers thought by their external discipline to pay the pains due for
sin, and to satisfy Gods justice: And that, Ibidem.
not Ciprian only write some things concerning penance very incommodiously,
and foolishly, but almost all the most holy Fathers at that time were in that
error etc. and depraved penance. Lastly concerning Pardons. D. Field confesses
that, Of the church. l. ^. c. 17. p. 33.
the ancient Bishops were wont to cut of great parts of enjoined penance,
which remission was called an Indulgence. And whereas he would euade, that the
enjoined penance thus remited, was not then imposed as in satisfaction of Gods
justice, it is so evidently against the Fathers judgments confessed here by
M. Whitaker and others, as needs no further confutation.

The Fathers in general are confessed for our Cathlicke doctrines concerning
real presence, the reservation of the Sacrament and receiving fasting, and
chaste. SECTION. 6.
NOw as concerning the confessed judgment of the ancient Fathers in proof of
the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Sacrament, Calvin affirms
that Lib. epist. and resp. ep. 208. p. 392.
The ancient Fathers and chiefly Hillary, and Ciril, went further herein then
was fitting, and that therefore he will not subscribe to them: Of which also
says Peter In ep. annexed to his common places in english. ep. to Beza. p. 106.
Martyr, I will not easily subscribe to Ciril, who affirmed such a communion, as
thereby even the substance of the flesh and blood of Christ, first is joined to
the blessing, for so he calls the holy bread: In so much as he is not ashamed
to term 2. Alphabet. table at the word heresy.
it the heresy of Ciril, touching our communion with Christ. And Bucer (though
falsely pretending the Fathers) professes yet Scripta erudita etc p. 37.
to avoid the sayings of the holy Fathers etc. as being different (says he)
from the word of God, and serviceable to Antichrist.

Now in reguard of the known antiquity of real presence See Protest. Apol.
tract. 1. sec. 3. p. 82. Praetorius de sacram. p. 221. 288. Zepperus de sacram.
p. 48. Vrsinus in commonefact. etc. p. 211. Centuristes. Cent 8. c. 4. col. 312.
confessed in Gregory, Ambrose, Chrysostom Eusebius Emissen, S, Ciprian, and
others, a learned adversary acknowledges that Adamus Francisci in margarita.
p. 256.
even Transubstantiation entered early into the Church. And another also
confesses saying, Antonie de Adamo in Anotamy of the Mass. fol. 246.
I have not yet hitherto been able to know when this opinion of the real and
bodily being of Christ in the Sacrament did begin.

In like sort concerning the used chastity even of married persons before their
receiving of the Sacrament Hospinianus confesses that, Hist. sacra. part. 1.
l. 2. p. 46.
in the Primitive Church the Eucharist was received chaste. for which he
alleges sundry Fathers testimonies. And the same doctrine is reprehended by
Zepperus, De sacram c. 36. p. 805.
in Tertulian, Hierome, and the Fathers of the Council of Eliberis.

So also as touching receiving fasting, Hospinian affirms that, Hist. sacram.
part. 1. l. 2. p. 47.
In the Primitive Church they fasted before the receiving of the supper: whereof
I have spoken more at large See before. c. 8. sec. 3.
heretofore.

But now to speak of the Reservation of the Sacrament, used in all Catholic
countries for the more present help and comforth to the sick and which is
neglected generally by all Protestants; M. Fulke confesses and reprehendeth the
Fathers saying* Against Heskins etc. p* 77.
that the Sacrament of some was reserved in the elder days of the Church, is
not so great a controversy, as whether it ought to be reserved. Calvin speaking
of Catholics reserving the Sacrament for the sick says, Instit. l. 4. c.
17. parag. 39.
I confess that those who do so, have the example of the ancient Church, but
in so great a matter, and wherein the error is not without great danger,
nothing is more secure then to follow the truth. And whereas S. Ciril, speaking
of the heretics Anthropomorphits says of them, Ad Calosyriu^.
I hear they say, that the mystical blessing, if any remnant thereof remain
til the next day following, is unprofitable to sanctification, but they are mad
in so saying, for Christ is not another, neither shall his body be changed, but
the virtue of blessing and lively grace do always remain in it; Hereto Peter
Martyr answeareth Aduersus Garden. ob. 213. col. 838.
whereas it is added that the remnants of the Eucharist kept til the day
following, do not cease from sanctification, I think this belongs to a
certain received custom etc. which custom though it tasted of some
superstition, yet Ciril and others subscribed unto it: for forthwith from the
times of the Apostles by little and little they began to degenerate from that
ancient simplicity of Gods worship etc. the Anthropomorphits heretics
believed, that those remnants had such a conjunction with the body of Christ,
that what corruption happened to them, they thought did also happen to the body
of Christ. Now how could the heretics have immagined thus; had not the real
presence been the received doctrine of those ancient times? And as for M.
Mortons answer Appeal. p. 602. 603.
thereto, it is so impertinent and extrauagant as I deem it unworthy of al
further reply.

Wherefore to proceed, according to Chemnitius, Exam. part. 2. p. 102.
witnesses of this custom of private reservation of the Eucharist, are
Tertulian, Ciprian, Ambrose, Hierome, Basil etc. it is known how much certain
of the ancient (writers) have commended this private reservation, as
Nazianzen, Ambrose, etc. and truly if the antiquity of a custom universally
dispersed or long continued might impose either necessity, or prescribed to the
truth, by no means ought that private reservation either be changed or
abrogated. Now whereas D. Appeal. l. 2^. c. 3. p. 136.
Morton would divert his reader from the point urged, under pretext that, the
carrying of the Sacrament unto private men's houses, used in the time of
persecution in the Primitive Church, haith been sithence abrogated, the
persecution being ceased, what is this against the reservation of the Sacrament
in the Church for such as are sick? or in answer to the inference made upon
the other, as namely that the Fathers therefore thought it a sacrament, and
Christ present before our receiving thereof: to the contrary whereof Protestants
teach that Willet in his synops. p. 460,
It is no Sacrament, unless it be received. In like sort where M. Morton
obiecteth the Fathers delivering sometimes the remains left of the Sacrament,
unto App^^le. p. 136.
Innocent children to be by them eaten, or else to the pure element of the fire
to be there consumed, to what purpose was all this, had the Fathers but thought
of the remanies of the Sacrament, as Protestants now do, to wit that they were
but particles of bread only representing the body of Christ? And lastly whereas
the same M. Morton yet urges, that S. Ciprian says, Ibidem. p. 135.
that that bread is received not shut up; what avails this but to prove that
the Sacrament should be not only reserved, but also received? Otherwise how
plain S. Ciprian was for reservation appears by his own Sermon. 5. de lapsis.
writings, and is formerly confessed by Chemnitius.

But Oecolampadius yet further hence acknowledges, Lib. epist. Oecolam. and
Suing. p. 690*
the religion of the ancient Fathers, who took it grievously that the
Eucharist should fall upon the ground: for which the said Fathers are reproved
by M. Parker, who terms Against symbolising. part. 1. c. 3. 10. 11. p. 148.
it in them hypocrisy; and the like is acknowledged by Aphorism. de Euchar. l.
6. fol. 230.
Vadian.

The Fathers in general are confessed concerning our Catholic doctrines of
the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood in the Eucharist: As also that the
same was propitiatory even for the souls departed; and of mingling water with
wine in the Chalice; and of Altars. SECTION. 7.
DOctor Conference. p. 552.
Reynoldes affirms concerning Altars, and sacrifices, that they are linked
together by nature in relation and mutual dependence one of another: So as
proof of the one is also proof of the other. Now M. Carthwright says, 2.
Reply. part. 2. c. 9. p. 264.
the abuse of the ancient writers herein may easily appear, in that in this
so great liberty of speech, they used to call the supper a sacrifice, and the
communion table an Altar; whereof also Peter Martyr says, Common places. part.
4. c. 12. p. 225.
the Fathers should not with so much liberty have seemed here and there to have
abused the name Altar: In so much as in respect of this antiquity of Altars,
diverse See Milius in volumen 1. disput. 15. fol. 254. 257.
learned Protestants do retain and defend them against their other brethren.
But as touching sacrifice it self, Calvin writes, In Haebr. c. 7. 9. p. 924.
when so many ancient doctors of the Church had forged without commandment a
sacrifice in the supper of Christ, and so by adding sacrifice had adulterated
the supper, afterward they endeauored on every side how to get colors
wherewith to shodow their error. And again, De vera Eccles. reform. in tract.
theol. p. 389. and i^st. l. 4. c. 18. parag. 11.
The ancient (Fathers) are not to be excused, for so much as it appears that
they have varied from the pure and proper institution of Christ, for seeing the
supper is to be celebrated to this end, that we communicate with the sacrifice
of Christ, they not content herewith have also added an oblation, this addition
I affirm to be faulty. Crastouius a learned Caluinist confesses that, Lib. 1.
de opificio Missae. p. 28. 58. 102. 171. And in Calvin in ep. ad Haebr. c. 7.
9. p. 924.
The Fathers thought the Eucharist to be a sacrifice according to the order of
Melchisadech. Fulke also says hereof, Against Heskins. p. 99.
I confess that diverse of the old Fathers were of opinion, that the bread and
wine which Melchisadech brought forth was sacrificed by him, and that it was a
figure of the Sacrament, which they improperly called a sacrifice etc. Cipria^
also thouhgt that herein Melchisadech resembled the Preisthood of Christ.

And that the Fathers taught, that this sacrifice of the Eucharist was also
propitiatory or satisfactory for sin, the same Crastouius acknowledges
saying, Lib. 1. de opificio Missae. p. 167.
But the sayings of the Fathers do not only import impetration, but also a
certain intrinsecal force of appeasing, Origin. hom. 13. in Leuit. says, This
is the only commemoration which makes God propitious to men. Athanasius sermon.
de defunctis, cyted by Damascen says, the oblation of the unbloody host is a
propitiation. And he alleges yet further to the same purpose the like
sayings of S. Chrysostom, Ambrose, Austin, Gregory, Bid, etc.

The Fathers also confessedly taught that this sacrifice of the Eucharist was
to be offered also for the dead; hereof also writes In tract. theol. p. 394.
Calvin, There remaneth another sort of the dead whom (the Fathers) would have
remembered at the supper, that place of rest might be given them etc. I do not
deny that this was a most ancient custom. which also was so general, that M.
Gifford confesses that, Demonstration against Brounistes. p. 38.
in the (Churches) public worship to pray for the souls of the dead, and to
offer oblation for the dead, was general in the Church long before the day s
of Austin, as appears in Ciprian, and Tertulian. Zepperus De sacram. p. 47.
alleges S. Austin and diverse other Fathers, by whom (says he) sacrifice
for the quick and the dead was made of the holy supper. And according to
Bullinger, De orig. erroris. fol. 223. And see Decades in english. dec. 5.
sermon. 9. p. 1082.
Austin makes mention of oblation for the dead etc. in Enchirid. c. 109. etc.
which I therefore speak of more largely, that you may understand this custom
of offering for the dead, not to be ordained by the Apostles, but by the holy
Fathers. M. Fulke does not deny but plainly acknowledges that, Confut. of
Purgat. p. 362. 303. 393. and Osiander in his refutatio aduersus Costerum. p.
73.
Tertulian, Ciprian, Austin, Hierome, and a great many more, do witness, that
sacrifice for the dead is the tradition of the Apostles. And whereas S. Ciril
Catech. Mistag. 5. ante med.
terms the Sacrament the host of propitiation, and the greatest help for
souls (departed) for which it is offered; Hospinian hereupon says, Hist.
sacram. part. 1. l. 2. c. 7. p. 167.
Ciril affirms according to the received custom of his time that the
sacrifice of the Altar is the greatest help of souls. To conclude, not only
the generality of Mass for the 1000. years last past is granted by many
Protestant Bacon in his relics of Rome. fol. 344. Danaeus de Antichristo. c.
20. p. 101. the Cet^ristes. cent. 6. c. 6. col. 336. Hospin. concord. discord.

writers, but they likewise further admit that, Ascam. in Apol. pro caena Dom.
p. 31.
It cannot be known at what time and by what men the super of the Lord was
cast out of possession by the Mass.

Lastly as concerning the mingling of water with wine in the Chalice for the
sacrifice (by us houlden necessary, not to make the Eucharist a Sacrament,
wherein M. Appeal. l. 2. c. 4. p. 138. 139.
Morton deludeth his unwary reader, but as to the been esse of it, or
representation, so as to omit the same were sin whereunto D. Morton answeareth
nothing) M. Whitguift avouches that, Defenc. tract. 8. p. 473.
Ciprian was greatly ouerseene in making it a matter so necessary in
celebration of the Lords supper to have water mingled with wine, which was at
that time no doubt common to more then to him; whereto agrees M. Ibidem. p. 525.
Carthwright: In so much as M. Jewel confesses of this mixture that, Reply to
Harding. p. 34. and Parker against symbolysing. part. 1. c. 2. p. 103.
Indeed S. Ciprian and certain old Fathers speak of it and force it much.

The Fathers ingeneral are confessed for our Catholic doctrines concerning
prayer for the dead, Purgatory and Limbus Patrum. SECTION. 8.
DOctor Fulke confesses that, Confut. of Purgat. p. 313. and see cent. 4. c.
6. col. 454.
In the burial of Constantine (our first christian Emperor) is mention of
prayer for his soul according to the error of the time. And again, Confut. of
Purgat. p. 320. 326.
Ambrose indeed allows prayer for the dead, it was a common error of his
time. with him agrees M. Gifford saying, Demonstration against Brounistes. p.
38.
this corruption (of prayer for the dead) was general in the Chuurch long
before the days of Austin etc. It was the practice of the Church ingeneral,
and the corruption so ancient, that Tertulian says, it was observed by
tradition from the Apostles etc. the doctrine of Purgatory was crept in also.
whereto might be added sundry Willet in Tetrast. part. 3. p. 97. Chemnit. exam.
part. 3. p. 107. Fulke in his retentiue against Brist. p. 106. Hospin. hist.
sacra. part. 1. p. 155. Calvin. instit. l. 3. c. 5. parag. 10.
other testimonies of our adversaries, so likewise reprehending and charging
the Fathers with prayer for the dead. But M. Carthwright forbeareth not to
con^esse that, 2. Reply. part. 1. p. 619.
Epiphanius (a greek Father) esteemed Aerius to be an heretic for his
judgment, that we ought not to pray or make any oblation for the dead; and
Austin (a Father of the Latin Church) reports this as one of his heresies. Of
this also says D. Fulke in the like words, Answer to a counterf. Cathol. p.
44. 45.
Aerius taught that prayer for the dead was unprofitable, as witness both
Epiphanius and Austin, which they count for an error. But D. Fulke says yet
further of Confut. of^ Purgat. p. 161.
Purgatory, The error of Purgatory was somewhat rifly budded in Austines time.
And again, Ibidem. p. 78. 194.
Austin speaks of the amending fire in the place by M. Allen alleged, he
does so indeed but had no ground of that fire, but in the common error of his
time.

In like sort as touching Limbus Patrum, M. Jacob for the Puritanes confesses
that, In Bilsons full redemption. p. 188.
All the Fathers with one consent do affirm, that Christ delivered the souls
of the Patriarchs and Prophets, out of hell and his coming thither, and
sospoyled Satan of those that were then in his present possession. And D.
Barlow confesses likewise for the Bishops that, Defense of the articles. of
the Prot. relig. p. 173.
This passes most rife among the Fathers, who taking inferi. for Abraham's
bosom, expound it, that Christ went thither ad liberandu^ liberandos, to
convey the Fathers deceased before his resurrection into the place where now
they are: whereto might be added like further confession and testimony of D.
Contra Duraeu^ l. 8. p. 567. Dan. ad Bellar. disput. part. 1. p. 176. Bil^on in
his full redemption. p. 189. and in his survey of Christ's sufferinges. p. 656.

Whitaker, Danaeus and sundry others.

The Fathers in general are confessed for our Catholic doctrines of
invocation of Saints, of our reverent use of Images, relics, and the
Cross. SECTION. 9.
OF the Fathers belief concerning invocation of Saints and Angels, D. Fulke
says, Reioynder to Brist. p. 5.
I confess that Ambrose, Austin, and Hierome, held invocation of Saints to
be lawful. And Chemnitius having alleged S. Austin, praying to S. Ciprian
being martyred before, concludes thus thereof, Examen. part. 3. p. 211.
Austin did this without the Scripture, yealding to the times and custom. And
again, Ibidem. part. 3. p. 200.
Invocation of Saints began to be brought into the public assemblies of the
Church about the year of our Lord 370. by Basil, Nyssen, and Nazianzen. The
Cent. 3. c. 4. col. 83.
Century writers also speaking of the more ancient times of Ciprian, and
Origin, do confess that they also contain manifest tokens of the invocation
of Saints. So little do these confessions of our learned adversaries agree
with or rather so far do they exceed D. Appeal. p^. 227.
Mortons evasion of Rhetorical Apostraphes.

In more full confirmation whereof ad only that Chemnitius in this respect does
not excuse with retorical Apostraphes, but flatly accuse and reject Examen.
part. 3. p. 211.
most of the Fathers, as Nazianzen, Nyssen, Theodoret, Ambrose, Hierome. etc.
who (says he) did not disput^ but avouch the souls of martyrs and Saints,
etc. to hear the petitions of those that prayed, and to carry them to God etc.
they went to the monuments of martyrs, and often inuocated the martyrs by name.
Of which also says M. Volum. 2. p. 592.
Parkins, The Fathers, especially those after the 400. years, have erred in
the invocation of Saints.

As touching the public placing of Images in the Church (which M. Fulke
thinks to be Defense of the engl. translat. c. 3. p. 119.
against the commandment) sundry examples or testimonies of the ancient
Fathers are in proof thereof alleged by M. Against sybolising. part. 1. p 32.
Chem. exam. part. 4. p. 26. 29. 30. Cent. 4. col. 409.
Parker Chemnitius, and the Century writers: In so much that in respect of such
ancient public allowance of images, the Protestant Functius affirms that
Lib. 7. comment. in praecedent. Chronolog. at Anno. Christi. 494. fol. m. c^
Anno. 494. Xenaias was the first in the Church that stirred up war against
Images.

And as for relics of Saints and pilgrimage thereto, the Century Cent. 4. c.
6. col. 456.
writers do charge the Fathers of the 4. age, with public translation of
Saints relics. And Chemnitius affirms that, Examen. part. 4. p. 10.
from translations presently were made cicumgestations of reliqu^s, as is to be
seen in Hierome, and Austin etc. yea says he, Ibidem. and see cent. 4. c. 6.
col. 457.
they made pilgrimages to the places where they heard there were relics
famous by miracles, so they went in pilgrimage to the holy land, and to Rome,
to the Churches of Peter, and Paul: and the like hereof is testified by the
Century writers.

Now in more semblable proof yet of Images, M. Parkins reports concerning the
reverence in ancient times given to the Cross, that Volum. 2. p. 596 and Fulke
against Heskins. p. 657.
Paulinus. ep. 11. says, the Bishop of Jerusalem yearly at Eaester set forth
the Cross for the people to worship, him self being the chief of the
worshipers. So general and received was the usage thereof in the time of
Paulinus, who according to Cent. 5. l. 3. c. 2. p. 387.
Osiander, was familiar with Hierome, Austin, and Ambrose. Neither was this
reverence exhibited to the Cross by the clergy or vulgar people only for
Prudentius reports the like practice thereof in the old Emperors saying, In
Apothe^^.
Vexillum Crucis summus dominator adorat, the greatest commander (the Emperor)
adoreth the standred of the Cross. Danaeus Primae partis. alt. part. ad
Bellar. 5. controu. resp. p. 1415 And Parker against symbolising. part. 2. c.
7. p. 61.
also affirms that S. Ciril, and sundry other learned Fathers were plainly
superstitious and blinded with this enchantment of the Crosses adoration.
Furthermore M. Burges says concerning the Fathers opinion of the Cross (with
exception only to the point of adoration, which is next heretofore already
sufficiently confessed) that, In Couels answer to Burges. p. 130. 136.
there is nothing ascribed to the Cross in or out of Baptism by the rankest
Papists, but the Fathers are as deeply engaged in the same, so as if we will
use it as the Fathers did etc. we take the soul to be fenced with crossing of
the body, and the Cross to have virtue of consecrating the Sacrament, driving
away devils, witchcraft etc. In proof whereof he alleges sundry ancient
Fathers, and the like is affirmed by several Treatise of the sign of the
Cross. p. 21. and see cent. 4. col. 3^2. and 1493.
Puritans and the Centuristes: In so much that as to the many miracles by us
objected in this behalf from the Fathers, D. Couel avouches that, Answer to
Burges. p. 138.
No man can deny but that God manifested his power to the amasement of the
world in this contemptible sign, as being the instrument of many miracles.

The Fathers in general are confessed for our Catholic doctrines concerning
freewil, and merit of works. SECTION. 10.
COncerning the Fathers doctrine of freewil, Protestants affirm that Discovery
of untruths in D. Bancrofts sermon. p. 23.
the error of freewil derived from Justin martyr, and Irenaeus, was at the time
of the Nicene Council in some ripenes etc. we know that ever since the Apostles
times in a manner it flourished every where, til Martin Luther took the sword
in hand against it. The Centuristes, speaking of the times next after the
Apostles, do think, Cent. 2. c. 4. col. 58.
that scarcely there is any point of doctrine which began so soon to be
darkened as this of freewil. As also Ibidem. col. 59. and cent. 4. col. 291.
Calu. instit. l. 2. c. 2. parag. 4. Hamelman. de tradit. Apost. l. 2. c. 7.
col. 93.
after the same manner Clemens every where affirms freewil, that it may
appear, that not only all the Doctors of that age were in such darkness, but
also that the same increased afterward in the later ages. In like manner
concerning induration, Calvin affirms that, See before. c. 2. sec. 2.
The ancient Fathers were superstitious, and afraid to confess the truth
thereof.

And as for the Fathers doctrine of works, D. Humfrey is fully of opinion
that, In Jesuit. part. 2. p. 530.
It may not be denied, but that Ireneus, Clemens, and others, whom they call
Apostolical (in respect of the time in which they live) have little
Apostolically inserted into their writings the opinion of freewil, and merit
of works. Melancthon also thinks that, In ep. ad Romanos. p. 391.
Origin; and many others following him, feigned men to be just for their
works. And M. Whitaker houldeth chargable Resp. ad rat. Camp. p. 78. and in
Fulkes defense of the engl. transl. p. 368.
with error herein (to use his own words) not only Ciprian, but almost all the most holy Fathers of that time. The Centuristes speaking of the Fathers of
those ancient times say, ^ent. 3. c. 4. col. 79.
It seems that for the most part this chiefest article of justification to
have been obscured, for they attributed to works justice even before God.
Again, Ibidem. col. 78. and see cent. 4. col. 292. 293.
The doctors of this (third) age have declined from the true doctrine of Christ
and the Apostles concerning good works: yea they conclude upon recytal of
sundry of the ancient Fathers sayings thus, Ibidem. col. 293.
Now let the godly reader think how far this age haith declined in this
article from the doctrine of the Apostles* Lastly Calvin writes. Instit. l. 3.
c. ^5. parag. 2.
I confess that the writers of the ancient Church have every where used (the
name of merit) and I would to God that by the abuse of this word they had not
given to posterity occasion of error; yea the Fathers were so full herein, that
we have seen before See before. c. ^3. sec. 3.
their confessed condemning of Iouinianus for his denial of merit^^.

The Fathers ingeneral are confessed for our Catholic doctrines concerning
vows, the single life of Preistes, Monachisme, prescribed fastes, and
Ceremonies. SECTION. 11.
WE are not ignorant ( says Exam. part. 3. p. 41.
Chemnitius) that the Fathers allowed the vows of perpetual single life, and
that they also brought them to be obligatory, or to bind in conscience. Peter
Martyr thinks De votis. p. 524.
Epiphanius with many other of the Fathers to err, in that they said it was
sin to break^ such a vow when need required, and that they badly ascribed it
to Apostolical tradittion. M. Wootton censureth Defense of Parkins. p. 491.
this to be one of the blemishes of the ancient writers: whereof also says
Instit. l. 4. c. 13. parag. 17.
Calvin, they say this was observed from longest memory, that those who would
dedicate them selves wholly to our Lord, should bind them selves with the vow
of chastity, truly I confess that this custom was aunciently received, But I
do not grant that this age was free from al vice. Retentiue against Bristow p.

But Hospinian affirms yet further that, De orig. monach. fol. 102.
not only Austin, but other Fathers also erred in the vowed chastity by mutual
consent (even) of married persons. And as for the forbidding of Bigams, and
marriage unto Preistes, the first is so general and ancient that M. Fulke
confesses that he which haith had two wives, could not be a Priest in Hieromes
time. And as for the other, of the unmarried life of Preistes, M. Jewel says,

Here I grant M. Harding is like to find some good advantage, as having
undoubtedly a great number of holy Fathers on his side. Bucer likewise
acknowledges that, Gratulatio ad Eccles. Anglic. p. 35.
The Church of the East Aegipt, and the sea Apostolic were accustomed in S
Hierom s time, not to take for Preistes, but either such as were not married.

of Preistes marriage was condemned in Contra Vigilant. c. 1. and Fulke against

S. Austin, This heresy was quicly trodden dowen and extinguished, neither
could it ever prevail so much as to the deceiving of any Preistes.

But now to speak of the professed religious life of Monks, and Nuns, M.
Carthwright acknowledges that In Whiteg. def. p. 344.
Ruffin, Theodoret, Sozomen, Socrates, do mention monks a most in every page.
And the Centuristes do begin a whole special tract, the title whereof is, Cent.
4. c. 10. col. 294.
Of the Monks through Syria, Palistine, Bithinia, and the other places of Asia
under Constantine the great: They do also make another like special tract, the
title thereof being Ibidem. col. 1306

another bearing this title, Ibid. col. 1331

neither had houses, nor did eat bread, nor supping meats, nor drunk wine,
but dwelled in mountains; As also abstained Ibid col. 474.
from al flesh, fish, eggs, and cheese. Osiander and the Centuristes do also
report Osiand. cent. 4. p. 100. 440. the Centurists. cent. 4. col. 1323.
their enclosing or muring up of them selves in little strait Celies. They
affirm also, Ibid. col. 474.
that many of them slept upon the ground, others went barefooted, and others
weared hairecloth privately. And as for their professed voluntary poverty they
further say, Ibid. col. 464. 300. 301. and Osiand. cent. 5. l. 3. c. 13. p. 356.
It is evident that those who were to profess monastical life, did distribut
their goods before they entered into the Monastery. In like sort concerning the
vowed chastity of Monks, the Council of Calcedon is therefore reprehended by
Cent. 5. l. 3. p. 359.
Osiander. And as for Nuns, the Century writers report that there were Cent.
4. c 6. col. 467.
Monasteries of women professing chastity: And that there were virgins before
Constantines time professing perpetual chastity. Iustus Molitor De Eccles.
milit. 8.
also says, The Council of C^lcedon contrary to the oracles of the holy Ghost,
forbad the use of marriage to Monks, and Nuns. And of the very name of
Nuns, the Centuristes say, Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 470.
Hieronimus ad Eustochium Nonnae etiam vocabulo vsus est, Hierome used the word
Nun: And they report that Ibid. col. 468.

afterward they shall not be turned into secular habitations. The Centuristes
also testify, Cent. 5. c. 6. col. 709.
the obedience of Monks to be such, as that they went not out of their Cel
upon any occasion without license of their superior, whom they called Ibid.

ignorance of many Pet. Mart. in com. places in engl. part. 4. c. 1. p. 7. White

Protestant writers, who bear their readers in hand, that these ancient
Monasteries and Monks of the Primitive Church, were nothing less then Popish,
as being (say they) in very deed no other then Colleges of stude^ts, such as
are yet in use in Ca^bridge, Oxford, and other universities: But this evasion
is further plainly confuted by the like confessed Cent. 4. c. 6. col 467. 476.
1335. 1337. Osiand. cent. 4. l. 4 c. 19. p. 503. 507.
Monasteries of virgins ( which I hope our adversaries will not pretend to have
been Colleges of women students. As also by M. Carthwright, who in reguard of
so evident premises, concludes to the flat contrary, that 2. Reply. part. 1.

the Monks, Eremites, and Anchorites, in Hieromes time were very gross.

To speak now of the prescribed fastes approved and used in the Primitive
Church, whereof Calvin writing says Instit. l. 4. c. 12. parag. 19. 20.
I cannot altogether excuse the ancient (Fathers) in this respect, but that
they laid some seeds of superstition etc. the observation of superstitious
Lent was then every where in force. Chemnitius also acknowledges that, Exam.
part. 1. p. 89.
Ambrose, Maximus, Theophilus Hierome, and others, do affirm the fast of Lent,
to be an Apostolical tradition: whereof also says Scroderus Opusculum
theologic. p. 71.
almost in the same words, Ambrose, Theophilus, Hierome, and others, do decree
Lent to have descended from Apostolical tradition. The Cent. 4. c. 6. col. 440.
Centuristes also do charge the Fathers of the fourth age with superstitious
fasting upon Wednesday, and Friday. In so much as M. In his true Catholic. p.

Trig, in reguard of such their confessed antiquity, professes to defend and
urge against his other Protestant brethren, The fast of Lent and solemn

Lastly as concerning Ceremonies, M. Calfhil (to omit others) affirms that,
In Fulkes Reioynder to Martials reply. p. 131. 132.
The Fathers declined al from the simplicity of the Gospel in Ceremonies. As
for D. Appeal. p. 53. 324.
Mortons obiecting of S. Austin against Ceremonies, it is evident that S. Tom.
2. ep. 119.
Austin spoke not of the Churches ceremonies, but only of such particular

customs as were taken up of the common people as not instituted by the
Church: An answer so clear that M. Whitguift answeareth Defense. tract. 10.
c. 2. p. 545.
Carthwright agreeably in these words, Austin ep. 119. speaks but of
unprofitable ceremonies etc. neither grounded of the Scriptures, determined by
Councels, nor confirmed by custom.

The Fathers ingeneral are confessed by Protestants not only for particular
points of faith, but jointly at once for many or most of them together.
SECTION. 12.
TO forbear as now al such like particular further allegation, and to
comprehend at once many or the most of the points in controversy; D. Whitguift
discoursing of Defense page 472. 473.
doctrine taught in any age since the Apostles times, affirms without any
other exception either of age or father, that almost all the Bishops and learned
writers of the Greek Church and Latin also for the most part, were spotted
with doctrines of freewil, of merit, of invocation of Saints, and such like
etc. Meaning thereby such other like points of our now Catholic doctrine:
which his assertion is now sithence specially renewed and made good almost in
the same words by D. Couel, saying, Against the plea of the Innocent. c. 9. p.
120.
diverse both of the Greek and Latin Church were spotted with the errors about
freewil, merits, invocation of Saints, many things might be alleged in this
kind if it were any virtue to rip up their faults, whom we ought to honor.

In like manner concerning the like liberal acknowledgment of the Century
writers, Calvin, and whitakers; whereas Cardinal Bellarmine alleges the
particular sayings of Calvin and the Centuristes, as charging the ancient
Fathers with De notis Ecclesiae. l. 4. c. 9. nota. 6.
error in freewil, Limbus Patrum, denial of our concupisence without consent to
be sin, satisfaction. prayer for the dead, merit, penance, the fast of Lent,
the unmarried life of Preistes, Baptism of lay persons in case of necessity,
the manner of sacrifycing etc. Whitaker answearing thereto iustifyeth the same
saying, De Eccles. controu. 2. 9. 5. p. 299.
whereas Bellarmine alleges certain testimonies from Calvin, and the Century
writers, as noting certain errors of the ancient Fathers, which were common
to them with the Papists, as namely freewil, merit, Limbus, Invocation of
Saints, the unmarried life of Preistes, satisfaction, and certain other such
like etc. ( before mentioned by Bellarmine) I answer thereto, that it is true
which Calvin and the Century writers have written, that in many things the
ancient Church erred, as in Limbus, freewil, merit of works, and in the
residue of those other before recyted.

Agreeably hereunto also acknowledges Nouum. testam. praefat. ad Principem
Condensem.
Beza of the times of Ciprian, Austin, and Chrysostom, that even then Satan
did lay the first foundation in Greece of invocation of the dead, whereto some
Bishops of chiefest note were so far from opposing them selves etc. that they
did not only not express the open superstitions arising, but also nourished
them etc. Hence those opinions of freewil etc. affirming presently after that
the knowledge of providence, freewil, faith, and free justification, was as
then almost oppressed with the commentaries of the Grecian Bishops etc. At the
same time invocation of the dead prevailed, and the foolish opinion of single
life; which shamful errors being openly defended, the multitude also of
Ceremonies increased etc. and the Monks in Aegipt and Syria etc. almost al
admired as Angels, prayers also for the dead, begun then to be used more
freely, and the Platonical question concerning Purgatory fire etc. This
acknowledgment of Beza is so certain that the Protestant Asinus Auis. sec. 43.
p. 60.
Holderus purposly preuenteth al extenuation or excuse thereof.

M. In Apoc. in c. 14. p. 382.
Brightman having named S. Athanasius, Basil Chrysostom, Ambrose, Hi^rome
Augustine etc. avouches further, that they were in words condemning Idolatry,
but indeed establishing it, by invocation of Saints, worshipping of Relics,
and such other like wicked superstitions; affirming yet further that no more
pure doctrine can be drawn out of their writings, then any profitable notion
be gathered by the beating of the waves*

In like sort M. Napier records that, Upon the revelation p. 361.
The Bishops staf, the Archbishos cloak or pale etc. Item, their holy water,
their Chrismes in Baptism, the shauing of their heads, their golden and
silver vessels in the Church, their Albes, and Corporals, of linen for the
Altar, their consecration of the Altar, the observation of days etc. the
fasting in Lent from flesh, the choice of meats, the pretended chastity of the
Clergy, the celebration of Masses in memory of Martyrs, the adoration of the
Cross, were al instituted and devised, and arose about the 313. year of
Christ, together with the style of Primacy, usurped by the Roman Bishop: The
Ib. p. 362.
supper of the Lord (was then) degenerate and turned over to the Mass, to be
celebrated for dead men etc. and mixed with water. In the Ib. p. 363.
20. Articles of the first Council of Nice are superstitious rytes, even the
observation of days, to wit, of peace (or indulgence) and superstitious
penances etc. Th^se and diverse other abuses and superstitious rites creeped
in, in the outward visible face of the Church in Siluester the first his days.

The Century writers in their fifth Century being that age wherein S. Austin
flourished, affirm that as the^ (...). dedic.
every where Monasteries and Celles of Eremites were builded, and that they had
for their praisers Austin, Chrysostom, and others most excellent men: Hence
also the chief articles of faith, of free remission of sins by faith in
Christ, began to be obscured and defiled etc. The doctrine also of good works
was diversely corrupted etc. They attributed salvation to them with reproach and
injury to the merit of Christ etc. The light also of true invocation began to
be obscure etc. Afterward also because overmuch should be challenged to the
merits and worship of dead men, in this age also rise up the worship of
Relics etc. running to pieces of Saints, as they were commonly thought:
Therefore these chief heads being adulterated, it is easy to conceive that in
the other parts also of heavenly doctrine sincerity was many ways corrupted
etc. The Roman Bishops not only greedily, but also impudently sowed the seeds
of their Primacy or eminency above other Churches of the world, etc. Rome
formerly the head and mistres of the world is become the seat of Antichrist etc.
and more particularly they charg the Fathers of this age as erring in our
Catholic doctrines of Cap. 4. col. 500.
freewil, of Col. 504.
Justification, of good Col. 506.
works, of Col. 510.

1.
Most divines of this Century did no little divert from the purity of
Apostolical doctrine unto human opinions and Traditions etc. In this Century
Antichristianisme was conceived in the brain of Ambitious Bishops etc. So
confessedly ancient are both the foresaid rites and doctrines of our
Catholic religion from the abounding testimonies of the Centuristes,
Osiander, Calvin, Beza, Whitaker, Brightman, and Napier.

And here it may be well observed that the foresaid Protestants rejecting the
Fathers thus in general for agreeing with Catholics in all the foresaid points
of faith, that this preuenteth and confuteth D. Mortons usual evasion
throughout his Appeal, in pretending that the Fathers held these points, but
in other manner then we Catholics now do, as though the Fathers agreed with
us in words and terms and differed from us in meaning.

Ad now lastly hereunto, that in reguard of our foresaid sympathy with the
Fathers in matters of faith and religion, that D. Whitaker further avouches,

The Popish religion to be a patched couerlet of the Fathers errors sowed

Humfrey did greauously reprehend M. Jewel for his so bold appealing to the
Fathers, saying therefore to us of him, He granted overmuch, and yealded more
then of right unto you, and injured him self overmuch etc. and in a manner
spoiled him self and the Church etc. what have we to do with the Fathers, with
flesh or blood? Lastly Peter Martyr concludes for certain, De votis. p. 476.
that so long as we do insist upon Councels, and Fathers, we shall be always
conversant in the same errors.

And do but now remember that which is heretofore Heretofore in the preface to
the learned adversary
alleged, as acknowledged concerning the vnanswearable argument thus taken and
prosecuted from the frequent abounding confession of the learned adversaries
testifying against them selves; and then let the indifferent reader in Gods
name but consider whether that the foresaid doctrine of our now professed
Catholic religion taught thus by S. Austin and the other ancient Fathers, be
not sufficiently in this kind explained and made manifest, both particularly,
and in general, even to the full preventing of al colorable reply to the
contrary.

That the Fathers who lived next before and after the times of S. Austin agreed
with him in the Catholic Roman faith. SECTION. 13.
HItherto haith been discuorsed concerning S. Austines religion, as well from
his own confessed sayings and reported miracles, as also from the like
confessed answearable judgment of such Fathers (amongst other) as were
conversant and living with him: Only now in more evident and concluding proof
of his religion, we will lastly ad a brief touch of the religion in general,
confessedly professed in the several ages which were next after and before the
time in which S. Austin lived. First as concerning the age after, nothing is
more memorable in illustration thereof, then is the very conversion of us
English men by the other S. Austin sent thereto by S. Gregory, Anno Dom. Cooper
in Chron. fol. 156. Fox. act, mon. p. 117.

learned adversaries them selves do not only confess all the Humfrey in Jesuit.

Austin came and brought in Popery; and that, Bale in catal. script. illust.
cent. 14. p. 117.
Austin by his interpreters taught our people the Papistical faith: And
according to Bale, Austin was sent from Cent. 1. fol. 3.
Gregory to season the English with the Popish faith, and that King Ethelbert
dyed one and twenty years after he had received Popery. And being thus (in the
opinion of Protestants) the Ascham in Apolog. pro caena Dom. p. 33.
ouerthrower of true religion, and establisher (not of some part but) of al
Popish doctrine, he heretofore Osiander cent. 6. p. 290.
after his death undoubtedly went to hell there to receive his reward.

In like sort concerning our country man S, Bid (who was living In his hist.
Anglorum. l. 5. c. vlt.
in the age next after our said conversion, and til whose time according to In
Lombardu^ in Proleg. fol. *.iiii.
Danaeus, S. Austines doctrine was defended, Osiander Cent. 8. l. 2. c. 3. p.
58.
avouches that He was enwrapped with all the Popish errors in the articles in
which (says he) we differ this day from the Pope.

And for so much as our Catholic religion, whereto we were so converted, was
not then private only to us english men, but (as is known and confessed by
many Protestants) was Parkins in his exposition of the Creed. p. 307. 400.
Hospin. hist sacram. l. 2. p. 157. Fulke in his answer to a counter. Cath. p.

universally then dispersed and professed over the Christian world, it thence
evidently follows, that it was not as then begun with innovation, b^t was the
same with that former religion which the elder S. Austin i^ the time so nere
precedent professed and taught.

This point is made as yet more clearly evident by the undoubted great miracles
showed by God, at the time of our said conversion, and the same so credibly and
certainly reported from S. Lib. 7. ep. 30. Indict. 1. Bid. hist. l. 1. c. 26.

Among them who profess the faith of Christ, albeit not with equal truth and
sincerity, the less sincere parties may work miracles whereto God concurreth,
but not for proof of the errors, which are proper unto them selves, but for
confirmation of the truth, which with them is common to the Church; therefore
etc. we may grant that God does cooperate by them to the conversion of
Infidels. In like sort answeareth D. Comment. de regno Christi. l. 1. p. 91.
289. 312. 313. 314. 318.
Philip. Nicola^ speaking of those known and confessed miracles, which
impudency it self may not deny to have been showed by God in the late
Conuersions in this age of sundry nations in the oriental India and elsewhere,
The Jesuits (says he) and Popish Preistes etc. do like the Bileamites build
the Church of Christ, and do in the name of God among the Indians, and
Americans, succesfully expel the Idols and devils of the Gentiles, and do work
great miracles, especially when they undertake the conversion of Idolatrical
nations, and now comes his answer, Huc vsque enim Ibid. p. 91. 53.
Lutheranizant etc. that they do all this as in confirmation of the Lutheran
religion Ibid. p. 5^.
Converting the Gentiles in that way of religion to Christ which them selves do
not so much as enter into. Thus both Lutherans and Caluinistes being unable to
deny the evident truth of so many great miracles undoubtedly wrought by our
Church upon her converting so many heathen nations to the faith of Christ, are
nevertheless not abashed to pretend that the foresaid miracles were yet by God
so showed, as in confirmation not of our Catholic faith but of their
Protestant religion: Speak now here ingeniously, can you believe them?

Neither does D. Morton his evasion any thing help him, alleging the example
of the water miraculously vanishing away from the font, at such time as a
dissembling Jew came hipocritically unto a Nouatian Bishop for to be Baptized:
for here was no miracle wrought at the instance of the nocatian, or by his
agency, or ministry, or in any sort colorable to confirm Nouationisme, but
rather to the contrary; for this perfideous Jew (as Hist. lib. 7. c. 17.
Socrates reports and the Cent. 5. c. 13. col. 1483.
Ceturistes confess) having been before baptized after the Catholic manner
by Atticus a Catholic Bishop of Constantinople, and coming now again (under
pretense thereby of begging money) to be a new baptized of Paulus the nouatian
Bishop, God him self as unwilling to have his Catholic baptism formerly
received to be so scornfully and sacrilegiously profaned, did immediately of
him self, and without al agency therein of the Nouatian, miraculously hinder
the said Jew from being again baptized by the heretical Bishop: A thing so far
from confirming Nouationisme, as it argues rather directly the contrary.

And no less if not more disparity, or rather impertinency is obserueable in
D. Mortons like further obiecting of Balaam, and Cayphas, (not working miracles
but) prophesying of Christ against their own wickedness: whereto but further ad
concerning al these examples, as well that no one of them came to pass (as did
our foresaid other miracles) upon occasion or in behalf of commending or
publishing to the heathen people or others, any doctrine then before there
unknown or not received; as also that Cayphas his objected Joan. 11.49.50.
Prophesying was but for once, the Apostles then doing many Math. 10.1.
great miracles: As likewise was Numer. 24.17.
Balaams Prophesying for once, even in the time of Moses, whose many
stupendous miracles need no recytal; And so in like manner that which is
objected to concern the Nouatian, was but for once and the fifth Century when
as the Church of God was most Cent. 5. c. 13. from col. 1478. til 1494.
glorious in miracles: whereas in the other foresaid examples of undoubted
miracles confessedly wrought by S. Austin in our conversion, and by our
Catholic Preistes in their late co^uersions in this age of sundry heathen
nations, the Protestant Church was confessedly destitute of al like answearable
example in that kind, as is confessed by D. Fulke, saying, Against Rhem. test.
in Apoc. 13. sect. 3. fol. 478.
It is known that C^luin and the rest, whom the Papists call Arch-heretickes,
do w rke no miracles; with whom agrees D. Sutliue in these words, Examination
of Kellisons survey. p. 8.
neither do we practice miracles, nor do we teach that the doctrine of truth is
to be confirmed with miracles. And of Luther inparticular, his own Prot.
neighbors say, Divines of the Count Palatine in their Admonitio Christiana de
libro concordiae. c. 6. p. 203.
we have not heard of any miracle that he did. And thus much in proof that the
ages next succeeding S. Austin agreed with him in our Catholic Roman faith.

But now to come to the age precedent to S. Austin, that the same Catholic
faith was then also universally professed, and Protestancy not so much as
known to have been then in being, to omit much other proof (whereof this
short intended treatise is not capable) that learned and so excellent a man

the Apocalips: whereto M. Leigh adds that Britannies great delivery. fol. B. 2.
The Popes ever since the first 300. years have been Devils.

We may yet further ad hereto in behalf of the like yet further acknowledged
antiquity of our Catholic religion, that M. Napier further avouches Upon the
revel. in c. 16. p. 191.
that, during even the second and third ages (next after Christ) the true
temple of God and light of the Gospel was obscured by the Roman Antichrist
himself. That also in the book so In ep. theol. ep. 46 p. 232.
gratful to Beza, and penned by Caelius secundius Curio (a Caluinist) is
affirmed and houlden for good, De amplitudine regni. Dei. lib. 1. p. 43. 45. 47.
that, The world continued in great darkness, blindness, and ignorance, almost
from the Apostles age to these very times, in which above al expectation the
Lord began to manifest him self etc. Lastly Sebastianus Francus concludes for
certain that, Ep. de abrogandis. stat. Eccles.
Presently after the Apostles times al things were turned vpside down etc.
And that for certain through the work of Antichrist, the external Church
together with the faith and Sacraments vanished away presently after the
Apostles departure, and that for these 1400. years the Church haith been no
where external and visible etc. So peremptorily do they charge the ancient and
holy Fathers of the Primitive Church with Antichristian Apostasy from the faith
of Christ. Yea they do not forbear to publish to the world their special book
of that argument entitled, His Majesty in his declarati^n concerning his
proceedinges with the states in case of Vo^stius. p. 15. 19. 35.
De Apostasia Sanctorum, and to send the same to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and to mantaine further by letter unto the said Archbishop, that the doctrine
contained in that book, de Apostasia Sanctorum, was agreeable to the doctrine
of the Church of England. The miserable deceived author thereof, and other his
accomplices, Napier, Brightman, Brocard, Leigh, and sundry other Protestant
writers not discerning, that by such their pretended Apostasy, them selves do
in very deed, as precursors, prepare and make way to that fearful Apostasy,
which is in their opinion foretold by the 2. These. 2.3. and see Calvin upon
the same place, as also Piscator.
Apostle to happen before the end of the world: for what else is this pretended
Apostasy of the Primitive Church, other then a plain preparation and earnest
persuasion to make Apostasy or departure from the doctrine of the Primitive
church, and so consequently from the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles? So
clear it is that not only the ages subsequent, but also precedent to S.
Austin up to the Apostles are al of them disliked and condemned by Protestants,
as wholly papistical, and Antichristian.

The conclusion of the whole book.
HItherto (gentle Reader) have I entertained thy pains and patience, in making
proof to thee of S. Austines professed religion, from his own alleged
sayings and reported miracles, with solution also to the contrary objections
usually pretended from S. Austin: only now in conclusion of al, I offer to thy
consideration, how unlike it is, that I should be able to allege to thee so
many plain and pregnant sayings of S. Austin, in behalf of so many several
points of religion, and al or most of them for such by the learned adversary
confessed, and yet further confirmed with like confessed consenting doctrine of
the other ancient Fathers that lived next before, in, and after his age, and
(all this notwithstanding) no such matter (as some adversaries pretend) to be by
S. Austin therein intended or meant. Could he not in some only one or other,
but in all the chief points of controversy speak so plainly with us and
against Protestancy, and so likewise acknowledged by Protestants them selves,
and yet himself in those very points join in religion with Protestants and
against us? Al which being so abundantly hertofore in this treatise examined
and proved even from the sparing and wary confession of the learned
adversaries, who acknowledge no more then the rack of truth enforces them
unto, may suffice to satisfy thee, studious Reader, that hereby is delivered to
thee, but (as it were) the bare out side or naked appearance of things, in
comparison of that far greater proof and evidence, which is in very deed at
large abou^ding in the writings of S. Austin and the other ancient Fathers: If
therefore any shall without al forehead seek to abuse thee with denial of so
evident premises, I do therein boldly appeal to the equity of thine own
indifferent judgment. And as for those other who with more plain dealing, but
no less offense in do ingeniously confess and acknowledge S. Austines
foresaid doctrine to make with us, yet withal contemn and reject the same for
Popish, if any (I say) supercilious forehead of that rank, who Math. 13.13.14.
having ears to hear and will not hear, eyes to see and will not see, shall
oppose against us his own late adverse nouel doctrine, as pretended from the
Scriptures, in the understanding whereof he doubts not to prefer his own
private interpretation before S. Austin and the other Fathers, I can but (yet
not without commiseration) pronounce of such a one, Apoc. 22.11.
Qui sordidus est sordescat adhuc: And I must needs apply unto him those
words of our Kings most excellent Majesty which he worthily delivered against
Vorstius, a principal pretender of this Christian liberty: As for In his
foresaid declaration. p. 63. 64.
this Christian liberty (says he) which Vorstius does urge so much, certainly
he does it with no other intention but only under this fair pretext etc. to
abuse the world etc. To abuse Christian liberty in presuming to propound a new
doctrine to the world in point of the highest and holiest mysteries of God, is
a most audacious rashness, and impudent arrogance. And again, Ibid. p. 61. 62.
If one particular man may take upon him such singularity as this, how shall he
be subject to general, national, and synodical Councels etc. Wherefore he is
plainly discovered to be resolved, not to be subject in any sort to the
judgment of the Church etc. for he knows to well that the ancient Church etc.
(is against him) And this is the reason why he will not in these points submit
him self to the judgment of any mortal man, but upon this occasion mantaines
his Christian liberty: Thus far his Majesty against Vorstius, and indeed
against al Protestants, who being pressed with the aucthority of S. Austin, and
the other Fathers of the Primitive Church, either for the interpretation of the
Scriptures or for our knowledge of the practice of those purest times in
matters of faith and religion, do finally betake them selves to this desperate
refuge of contemning S. Austin, and al Fathers upon pretense of this Christian
liberty, that al controversies are to be decyded only by the private spirit
interpreting the Scriptures.

Now lastly as to al Catholic Readers I conclude, that seeing the faith which
at this day we believe and profess, is confessedly the same with that of S.
Austines, and the other holy Bishops and Doctors of the Primitive Church, that
therefore amongst the other greatest blessings of God bestowed upon us, we ever
esteem this with highest respect of our happy vocation: In due requital and
gratitude whereto, let us with all exultation of mind accept and embrace what
pressures, punishments, and torments so ever inflicted upon us, for our defense
thereof; yea if death it self be urged, let us rather make choice to dye in our
Lord, with S. Austin, S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, S. Gregory, and the other holy
Prelates, Martyrs, Confessors, and Virgins, of those purest times, then to dye
the death of the wicked, with Aerius, Iouinian, Vigilantius, Waldo, Wicliue,
Husse, Luther, Calvin, and other damned Heretics; whose very inconstancy and
civil dissentions amongst them selves, may serve us for a strongest argument,
that their singular doctrines first proceeding from the spirit of error and
ignorance, were after mantained by the spirit of pride and obstinacy, and
shortly will be ended by the spirit of discord and contradiction.

God save the KING.
