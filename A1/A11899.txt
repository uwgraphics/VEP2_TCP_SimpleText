CVi potius liber iste dicari velit, vel ego debeam dedicare quam Honori tuo
(vir omnibus nominibus Honorande) deliberanti diu and multum cogitanti, plane
non occurrebat. Etenim cum Philosophia ipsa inculta prorsus sit, and ab omnibus
neglecta fere, tum si a plerisque vt horrida conspuatur, non est sane mirandum:
Quo magis veteri quidem debet, ne temere cuivis sese offerat, ne forte in eos
incidisse videatur, qui cuticulam curantes ipsi, nihil admirantur vltra cutem;
quorum oculis nihil placet, nisi quod externa specie, and lineamentorum
harmonia se commendet; quorum aures omnia respuunt, nisi quae cum voluptate
quadam influunt: quod si contingat, quomodo non contemptui apud omnes esset
liber is, qui apud eum ipsum quem patronum sibi delegit potissimum, sordescat?
Quod si ioculare quiddam and molliusculum in publicum proferendum statuerem,
quod voluptate nescio qua, mentes hominum titillaret tantum, Introrsum turpe
and speciosum pelle decora,
(Vt inquit Poeta) non deesset hercle, qui
Fautor vtroque meum laudaret pollice ludum,
Nec certe
-- Nauibus atque
Quadrig^s peterem. --
Mihi patronum aliquem
Quoi donem lepidum nouum libellum.
Opprimerer eorum multitudine credo, qui occurrerent mihi naenijs hisce
patrocinaturi: Cum autem res serias tantum tractet author hic noster, idque
serio; quae tantum ijs arrident, quibus leuiora illa arrident minus; tum eos
qui subtiliori quodam oculo, and mentis, acie, venustatem Philosophiae illam
intueri possunt, (quae si corporeis oculis cerneretur, mirabiles amores
excitaret sui) nescio quod fatum contraxit in compendium. Et certe quamuis
eorum numerus tantus esset atque talis, quorum in sinum hic noster posset tuto
Conuolare, vt delectus ipse delectum fere tolleret, nescio tamen an cuiquam ex
omnibus deberi se magis agnosceret, quam Honorituo, qui cum in eam opinionem
iam diu veneris, vt inter prudentissimos, and virtute quam maxim excultos,
principatum quendam tenere videaris; tum etiam ita ad certam authoris huius
normam vitam direxisse, and momenta officiorum ea perpendisse videris omnia,
quae ab ipso in ^apiente requiruntur; vt si in eadem tempora incidisses, ille
ne praecepta ad exemplum tuum, an tu vitam ad ipsius praecepta conforma^is,
esset vehementer dubitandum. Qua de causa quidem, in spem maximam venit, aditum
ipsi apud te patere; quod ea afferat potissimum, quae si tibi placeant, (quod
non desperate) nemini quidem a tuae vitae ratione non alienissimo, poterint
displicere.

Quid quod and eum sibi Patronum deligendum censet, qui ipsa authoritate possit
eam ab aliorum iniurijs vindicare! quod cum ita sit, nullius quidem iniurijs in
eo locus erit, quamdiu totus ipsi apud te suerit, cuius potentia, and
authoritas, cum sit maxima, talem tamen intuemur, vt maiorem indies and
auctiorem fieri velimus omnes, qui videmus.

Inter Ajacem, and Vlyssem, litem nonnullam apud Poetas legimus interiectam de
Achillis armatura quondam, vter indueretur^ ipsa; de facto non disputo.
Poetarum men's ea fuit, vt cum prudentia polleret alter and concilio; lacertis
alter atque robore; apud quem tandem armorum eorum ius resideret, eumne qui
prudentissime ijs vti posset, an qui robus^issime eluceret: quod si ex iure
manu consertum vocaret authoritas sapientiam, and sapientia authoritatem, ad
quem tandem Senecae nostri patrocinium aequius pertineret, haud esset difficile
quidem ad iudicandum. Tu vero vir Honorande cum tanta sis sapientia, vt ab
authoritate quantumuis maxima vinci non possit, and authoritatem tantam nactus
es, vt ne sapientiae tuae quamuis eximiae and illustri velit loco cedere,
facile controuersiam ^anc omnem dirimes; in quo cum vtraeque summae de paritate
contendant ad quem patronum potius accurret, quam ad te, qui and propter
sapientiam singularem optime consultum voles libro non insipientissimo, and
propter egregiam authoritatem effectum dabis, libro male ne consulatur (dico
confidenter) egregio.

Ad me vero quod attinet (Illustrissime Moecen.) cum multa alia perpulerint, vt
te potissimum seligerem sub cuius nomine prodeat hic labor in Seneca
transfere^do meus, tumista inprimis quae dicturus sum. Nempe vt ad senem ille
de senectute senex, and amicissimus, scripsit ad amicum de amicitia, ita and
ego (illud sileo quod quam vellem vt possem attexere) Philosophiae libros hos
(quam sapientiam dixere veteres) ad te sapientissimum and Philosophorum Oxonij
studentium omnium Patronum primarium inprimis statui dedicandum. Quo quidem in
loco non possum illius non meminisse, (quod praetermitti sine scelere nefario
non potest) quodque grauissimi est instar argumenti, cur tibi vel soli, vel
certe potissimum omnium nostrum qui Oxonienses audimus in gratae mentis
testimonium, labores and studia inseruiant; qu^d per te effectum est fere, vt
studijs nostris ibi locus sit, vbi cum floruere maxim, tum maxim eiecta inde
voluissent ij, qui minime debuissent: per te vero iam effectum id videmus, vt
qui fontes illos limpidissimos conturbarunt, quo minus haustus inde puriores
essent, iam tandem aduersum Musarum Alumnos vtcumque coaxant fortasse, tantum
tamen coaxare possint.

De hoc autem ni grati simus omnes, omnium erimus ingratissimi. Quin quod magis
me ipsum spectat, illud Cardinale quiddam est, quod cum beneuolentiae erga me
tuae vestigia semper vidi non leuiter impressa, mihi nun quam satisfacio ipsi,
priusquam tibi (non dicam satisfaciam de animo erga me tuo) at agnoscam certe
quantis nominibus obstrictum me and obaeratum sentiam: quin attexo, ideo tibi
lubens dico, quod cum mihi beneuolus semper extiteris, tunc etiam and ab ijs
qui ex me emanarunt vtcumque, animo esse non poteris alieno.

Hac spe fretus (Honorande Maecenas) hosce meos labores, quales, quales tibi
trado in manus, quos aequi si consulas, condition haudquaquam iniqua susceptos
existimauero: Deumque rogabo Opt. Max. vt tamdiu nobis te conseruatum volet,
quam-diu te virtutum tuarum minime poenitebit.

CVm nulli magis opprobrijs alios conscindunt, and lacerant maledictis, quam ij
qui in opprobrium ipsi facillime incurrunt; tum plerumque id euenit, vt exilis
cuiusdam ingenij ipsi sibi conscij, nihil sapere videri se credant aliis, nisi
plane desipere se probent; dum ea carpunt omnino, quae non Capiunt. Ex quo
euenit, vt nihil egregium ita and excellens in publicum emanarit vnquam, in
quod dentes isti mordaces non impegerint. A quo hominum genere cum ego me
facile vindicare nesciam, apud vos (Viri Doctores doctoresque p^estantissimi,
politioris literaturae alumnos, qui quales erga vos ipsi velitis alios esse,
tales estis erga omnes) praefatione vti nonnulla haud absonum fore existimaui,
vt rationem consilij de Seneca in nostrum sermonem transmittendo mei, vobis
explicem.

Video autem multis id displicere quidem, idque vehementer, quod authors ita
Latini transferantur, and in sermonem nostrum migrent Anglicum: cum multa alia
tum illud inculcantes, iniuriam lite^i^ insignem inuehi, quod ea quae
literatorum deberent esse propria, nunc denuo prostituantur and omnibus
contrectanda^ prouulgentur: Qui cum id agunt quid aliud agunt, quam vt nostri
ad vnum omnes, a virtutum scientia vt profani quidam arceantur, veluta Dianae
sacris? De quibus illud est Calimachi (...). Hi dum a se scientias omnes velut
a Chaldaeis dies postulari volunt, quid aliud agunt quam quae ipsi vident vt
caeteris omnibus inuideant? Quae simens eorum fuisset qui ista primo literis
mandauerunt, quomodo tandem egregia illa ingenij eorum monumenta ad nostra haec
tempora permanare potuissent? Nec vero nios ille priscis inoleuit, vt cogitata
illa sua praeclara caeteris inuiderent, qui per se minus acie valerent and
ingenio, and ex omnibus certe vix paucos reperias qui vel Graeci Latin, vel
Romani Graece scripserint, quo minus suis innotescerent ea quae libri sui
praeclara continerent: ex quo effectum, id est vt quantum bruta intellectu
caeteri, tantum ipsi ingenio caeteros antecesserint. Neque vero non laudare
possum Sapientissimum illum apud laertium, qui cum de tribus Diis ageret
gratias, quod homo esset natus, non brutum; quod vir, non foemina, tertium id
erat quod Athemensis esset, non Barbarus; non quod solus inter eos sapere visus
est, sed quod ex infinitis vnus esset, qui non nihil sapere didicisset: Et
recte ad Amicum scribens M. Tullius monet, vt vbiuis esse malit, quam vbi sit,
propterea quod multo rectius illic viuendum sit vbi aliquo numero siet, quam
illic vbi solus sapere videatur. Et sane si aequi rerum aestimatores velimus
esse, facile quidem inueniemus excultiores multo nostros, and limatiores quam
antea extitisse, ex quo doctrina illa veterum, and historia Romanorum vernacula
ipsos alloquente lingua perpoliri caeperunt. Quo in curriculo labores mei cum
non nihil desudarint, tum facti mei tamdiu me non paenitebit, quamdiu publicae
vtilitati and honori patriae inseruire intellexero: and quanquam omnes
reclamantes videro Comici, tamen illo me facile consolabor and recreabo, quod
nihil in animo magis habeam, quam vt pluribus prosim.

Quin illud fortasse non recte quod (...) occurrunt Senecae nonnulla, quae
celari multo possunt honestius, quam in apricum protrudi, lucem non ferentia;
and male locata^ operam eam omnem clamabunt omnes, quae in re non bona. Habet
etiam (...) qua^ plurima, quae si recte ediscantur nihil illa nocebunt:
quanquam quid egi? Aut in quo euigilauere curae and cogitationes meae, nisi vt
lectorem pro virili praemonerem, and ad scopulos eos digitum intenderem, ad
quos si adhaeserit fortasse, naufragium illico facturus sit?

Nec vero defuerint ij, qui id vitio mihi vertendum senserint, quod in omnibus
non verbum verbo respondeat, quin infidus interpres sit ille necesse est, and
vbi fide est opus vel maxim, fideliam adhibebit, qui ita interpretem agere
edidiscit. Quin ille rectissime. Non verbum verbo curabitred dear fidus

Ne poterit quidem; quod tum eo res deducetur, vt dum in verbis se torquebit
nimis, sensus interim elabatur omnis. Quis autemita inscius erit, vt illud non
intelligat in omni sermon, idiomata loquendi quaedam apparere, and flores
elegantiarum, quae si verbis alienis efferantur, illico pro ridiculis
habeantur? Longum esset huc omni^ conuertere quae salsissime a Latinis dicta, a
nostris enuntiata verbis ijsdem, appareant insul^a. Quo facilius adducor, vt
eius omnia sic interpreter, vt quae proprijs verbis enuntiari non possunt,
enuntientur quibus possunt aptissimis: Hic ego, si reprehensionem incurro
iustam, exemplo me consolabor eorum, qui cum in hoc genere palmam ferant,
crimen commune mecum sustine bunt, nec nostroru^ solum, sed and eorum etiam
omnium qui in Hispania, Gallia, Italia communem mecum in eo genere nauarunt
operam. Agnosco vero libentissime errata huc irrepsisse nonnulla, quae vt
homini cuiuis in summo otio non vigilantissimo, facile possunt obrepere
quaedam, ita si mihi in hoc opere frequentiora visum est qua^ erat aequum,
facile ignoscet, qui rem ipsam vt acciderit cognoscet prius. Cum enim primo
statuerem ita in hoc opere meam operam posuisse, vt nequid per incuriam elapsum
mihi videri possit, in medio operis a me suscepti nescio quomodo in medium
rerum omnium certamen incidi; Praeterqua^ enimillud quod fratre charissimo
pientissimoque essem orbatus, ita vt studijs nullus in me locus esset relictus,
quem dolor vniuersum occuparat, accidebat id etiam, vt turbis ijs forensibus,
and molestijs vndique circumfrementibus opprimerer ita, vt dum illius omnia
(iam cum beatis illis incolis agente aeuum) co^ponere studeo, ne subcisiuas
horas certe mihi relinquo vllas, quibus huic operi iam inchoato supremam manu^
imponam.

ornanda se melius ne minimum quidem indulsit temporis. Ita fit vt quod mensium

meum dehinc otium quae rudia iam excidere, limentur accuratius, and quae

mihi facile spero, qui prius norint, quibus rationibus adductus, huic ego

nonnullam operi toti possent ^f fricare. De reliquis autem id tantum dico, quod
cum authoris huius an sint a multis in dubium vocari video, tum an a me sint
interpretanda vehementer dubito.

Habetis iam tandem (Doctores and lectores beneuoli) quae ego dicenda habeo,
quae si vobis candidioribus arridere perspicero, tum vt iis placeant quibus
omnia displicent, vehementer non contendo. Valete.

To the Courteous Reader.
IT was well done by Nature (gentle Reader) to give time, but ill done by men
not to apprehend the same: How much thou have lost in life in begetting
vanities and nourishing them, in applauding follies, and intending them, read
hear; and begin now to apprehend this, that it is but lost life, that men live
in entertaining vain things, and that no time is better spent, the^ in
studying how to live, and how to die well. This shall thou learn in our Seneca,
whose divine sentences, wholesome counsels, serious exclamations against
vices, in being but a Heathen, may make us ashamed being Christians; when we
consider how backward a course we have run from the right scope, by being
buried in vain readings, besotted with self opinion, by apprehending virtue
no more, but in a shadow, which serves for a veil to cover many vices. It is
lost labor in most men now-a-dayes whatsoever they have studied, except their
actions testify that readings have amended the ruins of their sick and
intemperate thoughts: and too pregnant a proof is it, of an age and time ill
spent, when as after a man has summed up the account of his days that are
past, he finds the remainder of his profits, he should have gotten in
life, to be either ambition unsatisfied, or dissolution attended by poverty, or
vain understanding boulstered by pride, or irksome age called on by surfeit; I
must confess that (had I effected it) I could have picked out either an author
more curious, or a subject more pleasing for common ears, to allure and
content them. But seeing the worlds Lithargie so far grown, that it is
benumbed wholly with false appearance, I made choice of this author, whose life
was a pattern of continence, whose doctrine a detection and correction of
vanities, and whose death a certain instance of constancy. Would God
Christians would endeavor to practice his good precepts, to reform their own
in seeing his errors; and perceiving so great light of learning from a Pagans
pen, aim at the true light of devotion and piety, which becomes Christians.
Learn in him these good lessons, and commit them to memory, That to be truly
virtuous is to be happy, to subdue passion is to be truly a man, to contemn
fortune is to conquer her, to foresee and unmask miseries in their greatest
terrors is to lessen them, to live well is to be virtuous, and to die well is
the way to eternity. This as often as I think upon, I find an alteration in
my resolution, which heretofore has too long time surfeited upon
time-pleasing; I am armed against all worldly contempts, wherewith Envy may
pretend to load me. My soul and conscience bearing me witness that my
intent and scope was only to draw men to amendment of life, and to root out
vain customs, that are too much ingrafted in this age; What care I for
detraction? which rather barketh for custom sake, then baiteth at me for
fierceness. No Soldier is counted valiant, that affronteth not his enemy; no
Philosopher constant, that contemns not Fortune; nor writer understanding,
that scorns not detraction; I had rather be condemned for confirming men in
goodness, then flattering the world in folly. Gentle Reader for thee I
labored, for thy good have I made this admirable Roman speak English, if it
profit thee I have my wish, if it displease thee, it is thy want of judgment.
Farewell.

THE LIFE OF LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DESCRIBED BY IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
CHAP. I. Of his Country and Parents.
IT has been an old custom to publish the lives of worthy men, and those
whose wisdoms, writings and actions we admire it does not a little content us
to know such other things as concerned or appertained unto them. I will
therefore speak of Seneca as far as may be, and will collect and dispose all
those things that concern this matter, both out of himself and diverse other
writers. It appears that he mas borne in Corduba, an old and flourishing
Colony in Andalouzill in Spain, and besides that, the chiefest in those
Regions. This does Strabo testify in these words: Amongst all other Cities of
Hispania, Batica, or Andalouzie, Corduba i^ enlarged both in glory and power
by Marcellus means: Lib. 3.
as also the City of Gaditana, the one by reason of Nauigations, and the
societies o^ the Romans: the other, because of the goodness and greatness of
the country; the river Babs likewise conferring much hereunto. They praise it,
and therewithal prove it to be ancient, because it was Marcellus work: which
of them, was it his that was Praetor, or the other that was Consul? For Marcus
Marcellus the Praetor governed Spain, as Pliny testifies in the year of the
City DLXXXV. although, Lib. 43.
as it seems, in peace and quietness; by which means the rather this Colony
of his countrymen was drawn thither, and happily the Ci^ie both increased and
adorned. For that it was not built anew, it appears by Siluius, who even in
Hanibals time called it Corduba. I had rather therefore ascribe it to him, then
to the Consul Marcell^s, who in the year DCI governed the hither part of
Spain, as it appears in the Epitome, and thou may gather out of Appian^ and
having worthily executed his charge in that place, triumphed Celtib^rs. He had
therefore at that time nothing to do with Baetica, or our Corduba, which is in
the farther part of Spain. But Strabo adds more, The most chosen Romans and
Spaniards inhabited this Corduba from the beginning, and into these places did
the Romans send their first Colonie. Note this word Chosen; for it was so
indeed: and thereupon afterward, as I suppose, it obtained this privilege,
that it was called Colonia Patricia. Pliny testifies it most plainly; Corduba
(says he) named the Patrician Colonie, and in Augustus stamp of money,
Permissu Caesaris Augusti, Lib. 3. cap. 1.
with his head on the one side, and then on the other side, Colonia Patricia.
The cause of which title, in my opinion, is, because that being both a fair
and a rich City, it supplied the Roman^ Commonwealth with Fathers and
Senators. For now in Augustus age they made choice of men out of every Province
to make up the Senate. Furthermore, Strabo says, That the first Colonie was
sent thither, which read thou with circumspection. For Carteia in the same
country of Bae^ica, before this time had a colonie planted in it by Lucius
Canuleius Praetor: but because they were not of the better sort, it was called
Colonia Libertinorum, or the colonie of the Libertines. Thou shall read it in
Liuy, in the beginning of his 43. book: yet may thou, and happily ought
thou to defend Strabo, that those inhabitants were not sent from Rome or
Italy, but that they were begotten by the Roman soldiers upon the Spanish
women; and by the permission of the Senate the Bastards had their liberty
given them and were planted in a colonie. But Strabo expressly writes, that a
colonie was sent thither. Enough of Corduba, and this was his country; but who
were his parents? It appears that they were of the Annaean race, whose name
seems to be given them in way of good fortune, ab Annis. The surname of
Seneca likewise was fortunate. For the first, in my judgment, had this name
given him, although Isidore think, that he who was at first so called, was
borne gray headed. Undoubtedly Seneca, or as the Ancients write, Senica: (for
Senecis is derived a Seen) signified (...), as Senecio does. Let Nonius be
seen in Senica. Hereunto I add that in another kindred also I find this
surname; as in Accia in an ancient stone M. Accio Seneca. Manlio Plauta 11.
virg. Quinq. But whether those of the race of Annaea were of the Spanish race,
or were sent out of Italy in a Colony, I dare not affirm; this only I say,
that they were of the order of Knights: for so Seneca himself speaks of
himself in Tacitus. Lib. 14.
Am I he that sprung from the order of knight, and in a provincial place,
numbered amongst the chiefest Peers of the City? Can it be amongst the Nobles,
that boast themselves of their long worthiness and antiquity, that my
novelty should shine? his father therefore, and happily his grandfather were
Knights, and not above. For he presently makes mention of his novelty; which
he would not have done, if any of his Ancestors had attained unto honors. But
his father was known both by himself and his writings, to be Lucius Annaeus
Seneca, whom for the most part, they distinguish from the son by the title of
Declaimer, in which kind he excelled. Diverse Declamations are extant, which
were not his own but another man's, digested by him, which he distinguished by
some titles and Annotations, and by this means sufficiently expressed his
mild and happy wit: he had to wife one Heluia a Spanish Lady, a woman of
great constancy and wisdom as her son sufficiently describes her in his
Consolatorie book unto her. The father came to Rome in Augustus time, and
presently after his wife with her children followed him; amongst which was this
our Seneca, as yet but very young. In that place lived he long, and followed
his af^airs with the favor and good report of all men, and I think that he
lived till about the later time of Tiberius; and hereunto am I persuaded,
because he makes mention of Seianus conspiracy in his books, and of other
things that appertain hereunto. I let him pass, and return unto his son,
of whom I have intended to speak.

CHAP. II. Of Lucius Annaeus Seneca himself and his brethren, where he was
borne, and when he was brought to Rome.
IN Corduba was he borne, and was translated from thence to Rome when he was a
child; Co^s. ad Hell. cap. 16.
which he himself testifies thus, where he praises his Aunt: By her hands
was I brought into the City, by her pious and motherly noursing I recovered my
self after my long sickness. If he were carried in her arms, it must needs
be that he was but an infant, and thou see that h^e was sick at that time
likewise and was recomforted by her care and diligence. This think I happened in
the fifteenth year or thereabouts, before Augustus death, the argument whereof
i^ Senecaes young years in Tiberius time, whereof I must speak hereafter. The
father therefore not long before that time came to Rome: he had two brothers,
and no sisters; which appears by his words unto his mother; Thou bu^iedst
thy dearest husband, by whom thou were the mother of three children. Ad Hell. c.
2.
And these three were M. Annaeus Nouatus, L. Annaeus Seneca, L. Annaeus Mela;
all borne in such order as I have set them down. This appears by the
inscriptions of the Controue^si^s, where they are so set down, although by their
sirnames. But the eldest of these brethren presently changed his name, and was
c^lled Iunius Gallio, because he was adopted by him. Which Gallio is
oftentimes named by Seneca the father in his declamations, and is called ours,
either by reason of their common country Spain, or of that friendship which
was between them were they not likewise allied and a kin? I know not, yet
suspect (...), by reason of this adoption. And this Gall^o it is who is called
Father by Quintilian and Tacitus likewise, in the sixth of his Chronicles. But
this our adopted Gallio in the Eusebian Cronicle is called Iunius Annaeus
Gallio, Senecaes brother, and a worthy Declamer. Was it by the name of both the
Families (which was rare amongst the Ancients; nay more, never heard of) that
it might appear into what family he entered by adoption, and in what he was
borne by nature? It appears mani^estly, if the name and title be true. He it
is to whom our Seneca both sent and wrote his books of Wrath, in which he
calls him Nouatus: yet the same man in his title of blessed life calls he
his brother Gallio, and likewi^e in his Epistles his Lord Gallio^ and that
honestly as him that was his elder brother. Observe this therefore that he
seemed not to be adopted at such time as his books of Anger were written, that
is, when Caius was alive, but afterward, and that then he changed his surname:
but his youngest brother was Annaeus Mela, so called by Tacitus Dion and
Eusebius, who was only a Roman Knight (for he that was the elder was a
Senator) who begat Lucan a great access to his greatness, as Tacitus says.
These therefore were the three brothers, of whom Martial witnesses, And
learned Senecaes house,
That is thrice to be numbered.
He calls him learned, (I mean, the Orator) his treble-house; his three
sons called his families.

CHAP. III. His youth, his Masters and studies.
He came therefore to Rome when he was a child, Epist. 113.
and in that place ripened he his excellent wit in the best studies: his youth
happened in the beginning of Tiberius government, as he himself confesses, and
about that time, when foreign sacrifices were removed and abolished. This was
in the fifth year of Tiberius, Lib. Annal. 14. in fine.
and of that of the City Dcclxx^^. which appears manifestly by Tacitus, who
writes, that the sacrifices of the Egyptians and Jews were abolished. Seneca
therefore about that time grew to man's estate, and was about some twenty or two
and twenty years old. For that he was well stepped in years in Augustus time,
hereby it appears; because he observed a Comet or a flame before his
departure; Qu^st. 1. c. 1.
of which he saith^ We saw before the death of Augustus such a kind of
prodigy, which children could not so curiously observe. His father, in my
opinion, was he that first instructed him in eloquence^ and this do his books
of Controversies and their Praefaces testify. For why should not this worthy
old man, who both directed and taught others, direct and instruct his own
children in that kind. He did it, and left two of them most excellent and
exercised in eloquence, Gallio, and this our Seneca, for I have red nothing of
Mela. This is that Gallio whom Status commends for his sweet discourse. And
thus much more, that from his happy line
He blessed the world with Seneca divine,
And brought to light that Gallio, whose grace
And fluent speech the commons did embrace.
He that was the author of the book Of the causes of corrupted eloquence,
said, that he had a certain resounding and pleasing eloquence, which he
calls the resounding of Gallio, meaning it by the son and not by the
father. But our Seneca, besides his eloquence, addicted himself to Philosophy
with earnest endeavor, and virtue ravished his most excellent wit, although his
father were against it. He himself diverse times says, that he was withdrawn
from Philosophy, and that his wife was she that dissuaded him; yea, and that
she hated it, he openly writes in another place: yet did the sons desire
and forwardness get the upper hand, so that he diligently and carefully heard
the most famous and serious Philosophers of that age, and namely, Attalus the
Stoicke, Sotion one of the same sort, although he seemed to follow Pythagoras
and Papirius Fabius, ^p^st. ^9.
which he names likewise, and praises with a g^atefull memorie^ he was Sotions
scholar in his younger years, and he writes, And now, though a child, I sat
and heard Sotion. Moreover, he admired and honored Demetrius the Cinique,
conuersing oftentimes with him in his elder days, and at such time as he
served in Cour^, both privately and publicly. For he made him his companion
both in his walks and travails. Such was his forwardness in honest studies,
yet his father broke him off, and in the interim caused him to follow the
Courts and to plead causes: which course, as it appears he continued long,
yea, even in Caius time, being greatly favored and famed for his eloquence.
Epist. 49.
Undoubtedly there are no Philosophical treatises extant, that were his before
that time.

CHAP. IIII. His honors and civil life.
HIs father likewise persuaded him to affect government, and to make suit for
honors: he therefore first of all was Threa^orer, in obtaining which office,
he acknowledges what helps his Aunt had procured him: Cons. ad Hi^. cap. 16.
She (says he) tried all her friends in my suite for the Threaso^ership, and
she that scarcely would endure to be conferred withal, or publicly saluted in
my behalf, overcame her modesty by her love toward me. What woman this was,
and what husband she had thou shall learn by my notes: but when he was
Threasorer I do not certainly know: for his years, it might have been under
Tiberius, or it might be under Caius, but I intend not to define the matter.
This had I rather say, that by Agripinals means presently after his exile he
got and exercised the Praetorship. For thus says Tacitus: Agripina got at her
husbands hand, not only a release of Annaeus Senecaes banishment, but also the
Praetorship, supposing that it would be pleasing to the common sort by reason
of the fame of his study, 12. Annalls.
and to the end that Domitius childehood might be the better ripened by such a
master, and that he might use his counsels, under hope to attain the
sovereignty. Thou see^t that he was suddenly made Praetor, and ^earest what
praises and endowments Tacitus unfeignedly honors him with. The love of the
commons was gotten by that means. Because Seneca now was accompanied with
every man's good words and favors, by reason of the excellency of his studies,
and was desirous that under such and so great a Master, that their Domitius
should be brought up, and should be addressed (and herein note his civil
prudence) both to obtain the Empire, and to govern it. He was therefore
Praetor the year of the City DCCII. and was he not afterward Consul? The
Law books affirm the same to S.C. Trebellian, as Vlpian. In the time of Nero
in the Octaues of the Calends of September, when Annaeus Seneca and Trebellius
Maximus were Consuls, it was made irreuocable. The same is written in the
elements of Justinians institutions. But they that made our holy^daies, make
these substitute Consuls (for ordinary they were not) the year of the City
DCCCXV. which should be the year, and some few months before Senecaes death.
Some men perhaps will doubt of the whole matter, because Ausonius in his
thanksgiving s^ith openly, The rich man Seneca, but yet not Consull^ Seneca
likewise himself never makes mention of this honor, although he wrote many
Epistles at that time. I answer, for Ausonius it is to be understood, that it
seemed to him to be an ordinary Consulate; for our Seneca, that a silence is
no denial. Furthermore, ^ add this likewise, that the Chronicle-makers seem
to have digested their relations badly; for in that year undoubtedly he was
not. For see here in the very beginning of the year, how Tacitus makes
mention of his cold entertainment by Nero, Annal. 14.
and how his detractors had diversely iniuried him, and how he himself with a
confident Oration came unto the Prince, and desired viaticum, and resigned his
substance: yet Caesar permitted it not, and yet Seneca from that time forward,
as Cornelius says, changes the prescripts of his former power, forbids
intercourse of Courtiers, auoydeth attendants, is sildome seen in the City,
and as if ouer-tired with sickness, keeps himself at home, intending only
the study of wisdom. These are no proper actions of a new made Consul or a
Candidate, and his death that followed presently afterward, forbids us to
consent hereunto. But what was it that learned men suspected thus? That which
Tacitus writes in that year was done by the consent of the Senate, lest a
fained adoption should in any sort further a public Office, and least in
usurping heritages, it should profit. But this appertains nothing to that of
Trebellian, it has another reference: if a man do examine those things
likewise that are in Tacitus. I therefore consent that he was Consul, but in
another and a former time, the certainty whereof I will not set down. But the
perpetual honor of this man, and how he was both the teacher and governor
of a Prince, undoubtedly worthy as long as he addicted himself to his
counsels and admonitions^ Tacitus concealeth not, and names two, to whom the
Prince was well inclined for his own profit. Murders had prevailed except
A^ranius Burrus and Annaeus Seneca had withstood them. These were the
Governors of the Emperor in his younger years, and con^formed in that equal
society they had in government, and in diu^rs sorts they had equal power.
Burrus in his change, in regard of warlike affairs and severity in his
manners. Seneca in his precepts of eloquence and honest affabilitie^ assisting
one another, whereby they might more easily restrain the tender years of the
Prince if he despised virtue, by granting him ple^sures^ O laud^ble endeavor
and consent, which is too ra^e in Court, where ^uery one for the most part will
desire to be so eminent that he desires no second. But to Seneca.

CHAP. V. His private life, his wife, his children, his banishment.
WHether he acted any other thing in public, I know not; Consola^. ad
Helu^am. cap. 21.
but privately I find, or at least wise I collect, that during his younger
years he was in Egypt upon this occasion; because his Uncle was P^ae^ect
t^ere: for he writes of his Aunt to his Mother, She will show th^e her
example, whereof I was an eyewitness. An eye witness? he therefore associated
his Aunt in that Navigations (of which he speaks in that place) when as his
Aunt returned from Egypt. And how could this be, except he himself likewise
had been in Egypt? Undoubtedly it was thus: and this is the cause why he
curiously intermixeth many things of Egypt and Nilus, especially in his books
of Natural Questions. Lib. 6. c. 17.
Perchance he trau^iled out of Egypt into ^ndia by the red Sea, and therefore
would he comment upon ^ndia, upon that which was written by Pliny. But now he
married a wife at Rome, which though it be uncertain to be so, yet the reason
he had children do approve it: for he makes mention of Marcus a wanton lad,
with much praise and affection to his mother Heluia: neither is it to be
doubted but that he was his son, at least wise his own verses will approve
it, where amongst his vows, So may young Marcus, who with pleasing prate
Contents us now, in eloquent debate,
Provoke his uncles, though in being young
In wit, in wisdom, and in fluent tongue.
For should I give way to those who attribute this to Marcus Lucanus, I find
no reason for it; yet makes he no mention o^ his former wife: not in these
books, I confess; what then? nor o^ his brother Annaeus Mela by name, had he
not therefore a brother? Notwithstanding thou art to consider whether thou
understand not this by his first wife: Thou know that Harpastes my wives
fool remained as an hereditary burden in my family: 3. de Ira. c. 1.
what wife? his first wife? for the books of Anger seem to be written in a
place well known to us. But he married Paulina after his exile, a woman of
great Nobility, which, as I tell thee, married him when he was old and powerful
in the Court: which very thing Dio likewise, or whatsoever he were in Dion,
thought good to object against Dion; which is, that being s^ept in years he
had married a young wench. Such were both of them, and Seneca himself,
testifies it. This said I to my Paulina which commends my health unto me:
Epist. 104.
it came into my mind, that in this old man there is a young one that is
forborne. A young one? he means Paulina her self: for undoubtedly she loved her
husband, as there in many places he boasts, and that unfeignedly, which she
expressed in his death, when in as far as in her lay, she sought to
accompany his soul with hers. Hereafter we shall see it. And these were his
wives. The rest of his life quiet, and without offense, excepting only that
grievous accident of his exile. For under Claudius the first year of his
reign, when Iulia the daughter of Germanicus was accused of adultery (Gods
and Goddesses by Messaline?) and was driven her self into banishment: and
Seneca, if he had been one of the adulterers, was exiled and sent into
Corsica; I will not say whether it were upon a just cause, I could wish it were
not, and happily Tacitus with me, who when he speaks of his banishment.
Seneca was angry with Claudius, it was supposed by reason of the injury that
was done him. Note this ^niurie: he therefore had received some. For who would
otherwise be ignorant to interpret the accusations of that impudent Ha^lot (I
mean Messaline) and that my son beast Claudius? For, for the most par^e they
practiced no mischief but against good and innocent persons. He lived about
some eight years or thereabouts in exile, I, and constantly too; yea, if we
may believe himself, happily intending only the best st^dies, and the
wholsomest meditations. For thus writes ^e to his mother; That he is blessed
amongst those things which are wont to make other men wretched. And afterward
(but I pray thee observe him) he worthily Philosophieth, he adds in the end,
and rowseth himself; Conceive what thou should, think me to be joyful
and addressed as it were in the best fortunes. Cap. 4.
But they are the best, when as the mind, deuoide of all thought intends
himself, and sometimes delights himself in lighter studies, and sometimes
mounteth into the consideration of the nature of himself, and the whole world
being desirous of truth. O man, O honest words, which the Author of Octauia's
Tragedy would imitate^ for it was not he (God forbid) in these Verses in the
person of Seneca; Far better lay I hid: removed far
From enuies storms amidst the Corsicke shores,
Whereas my mind was far from any jar,
Fixed on my studies, not on earthly powers:
O what content had I? (For never nature
Mother of all things, Mistress of each creature
Could grant no more) then to behold the heaven,
The Suns true motion, and the Planets seven.
These are better, yea, far truer then he has written in his consolatorie
book to Polybius, ouer-basely and humbly. And is it impossible that our Seneca
should write it? Oftentimes have I doubted it, and almost durst forswear it.
Howsoever, he was a man, and happily that writing was enlarged and published by
his enemies, and happily they corrupted it: yet note this in Senecaes words
abouesaid; That there he delighted himself in more slighter studies likewise,
which I suppose should be Poesy: and amongst them is Medea, which I am half
assured was written in his exile, at such time as Claudius conquered Britanie;
and therefore made he choice of that argument of Jason, that he might intermixe
somewhat of the Ocean that was subdued. Is it possible that those verses in the
Chorus should have relation to any but Claudius?

Spare me, O gods, I do entreat for grace,
Long let him live secure that has subdude.
And again, The Seas --
Enough already O you gods, you have
Reuengd you on the Seas, now spare the Power.
Which he applied to Cla^dius, although he were living, and will have the gods
to spare the god in his Poetical fiction.

CHAP. VI. His riches, his granges, his lands, his usury.
But presently after he returned from his exile, he grew again into
reputation, being both at that time, and before his advancement in Court
plentifully enstated, for his father had left him rich: Cap. 2.
neither owes he all his wealth to his industry and forwardness. Hereupon to
his mother; Thou being the daughter of a family, did freely bestow thy bounty
on thy welthy children. And he praised her liberality the rather, as he says,
because she bestowed it on her wealthy sons, and not such as were needy. This
before he came to Court; but when he lived there he got mighty riches, or
rather admitted them which thrust themselves upon him before he sought them.
For he got much by the Princes beneficence; for thus speaks he unto Nero in
our Tacitus: Thou (said he) have given me great grace, and innumerable
treasure; so that oftentimes I my self turn ^t oftentimes by my self: where
is that mind which contented himself with a little? Does he plant such
Gardens, and does he walk about these manors without the City? and is he
stored with so many acre^ of land, and with such mighty vsu^ie? Note Gardens,
Manors, Granges, Fields, and Usury, and all these bountifully and abundantly.
Will you hear Tacitus words once more, but from another man's mouth, and in
another sense: Lib. 14.
Senecaes calumners, says he, accuse him of diverse crimes; as that he, as yet
increased his mighty riches, which were raised above any private fortune, that
he won and drew the Citizens hearts unto him, and as it were exceeded the
Prince likewise in the annuity of his Gardens, and the magnificence of his
Manor houses. And Suillus in the same Tacitus expresses the measure of his
riches likewise, with what wisdom, with what precepts of the Philosophers
during th^se four years that he was in the Princes favor, had he gotten
three thousand HSS. that in Rome, whole Testaments and Inheritances were taken
and got hold on by his cunning and search; Lib. 13.
that Italy and the Provinces were exhausted by his immesurable usury. His
estate amongst us should be seventy five hundredth thousand crowns. These
riches were almost regal, I confess it, but I condemn that which he
annexeth, that it was gotten by unlawful means and deceit. Before he came to
Court, as I said, he had a great revenue, and what wonder is it that he
increased the same in so mighty a Court, and so great felicity of the Roman
state? But he says likewise that Italy and the Provinces were exhausted by
his usury: his meaning is, that he had money at use in diverse places, and I
suspect it likewise in Egypt. This gather I by his Epistle, Epist. 77.
wherein he writes that the Alexandrian Fleet suddenly arrived, and that all
men ran unto the haven and to the shore; but I, says he, in this general
hasty running of all men, found great pleasure in my slackenesse, that being
to receive my Letters from my friends I made not have to know in what estate
my affairs stood in that place, and what they had brought. For this long time
I have neither won or lost any thing. He had there his Brokers or Factors,
who followed his business; it was therefore in some great stock of money or
in lands. For to have possessions beyond the Seas was no new matter in that age
wherein he lived, and in so great abundance. Verily Dion amongst the causes of
the war in Britain, reckons this up likewise, That when as Seneca had
upon great interest trusted the Britains with four hundredth HSS. which in
our reckoning amounts to the sum of ten hundredth thousand crowns: he called
in for that whole sum of money at one time. Whether he spoke this truly or
no I know not; for every ways he was a mortal and professed enemy of our
Seneca. Yet tells he no untruth, for there likewise had he money. Why now
Gardens and houses of pleasure? he had diverse, and differently bewtified.
Iuuenall touches it, The Gardens of most wealthy Seneca. He himse^fe likewise
makes mention of his houses; Nomentanum, Albanum, and Baianum, and without
question he had many. He likewise had a house within the City, which
continued the name for many years after, and was called Senecaes house in the
Region P. Victor. His household stuff also was envied at, and Dio obiecteth,
that he had five hundredth tables of Cedar with Iuorie feet, all of them alike
and equal. This was a great matter if truly great (for this always ought we
to be wary in Dions objections) that he had so many tables, whereof any one is
usually taxed and prised at the rate of an ample possession: for they must not
have been so choice and so rare; but what if they were not? I deny not but
that it was the custom of dissolute and lavish men to have such: for thus
speaks Martial of one of these: A hundredth Moorish tables stand about,
With Libique teeth, and golden plates do crackle
Upon our beds.
For in great banquets they set a Table before every several man, (which is
elsewhere to be noted) and to this end therefore they had diverse. I do not
therefore say I deny or doubt hereof. But because Seneca himself touches and
reprehendeth this madness oftentimes, yea, at such time as he was in Court,
and in his old age, in those books of Benefits which he then wrote. What does
he not in his book of Tranquillity, about the beginning, openly deny that he
took no pleasure in those Tables that were conspicuous through variety of
spots. Nor was wont to use them? Wonderful is this impudence, in a matter so
evident and object to the eyes of that age, to dissemble or to lie so openly. I
cannot think it; especially if Dion report the same, or any other to whom Dion
assigns this office. For in another place have I noted, that these things
seem to be deduced and urged against him in some inuectiue Oration; and there
by the way have I acquit him of the crime of his riches, which any man may
read if he please. But rather let him read Seneca himself, who about this
time published his book of Blessed life, in which his project is to defend
himself from those aspersions, wherewith his enemies would have attainted him.
O excellent, O wise book, and more allowed in this behalf was the reproof,
that was the mean to bring it to light.

CHAP. VII. His Manners, and first his Abstinence, his Truth, his Safety, and
Piety.
But his very manners refu^e this objection of his riches, and justify his
use, and not ab^se of them. For what has he offended in pride, excess, and
pomp? Let them tell us it, and we will be silent. What was he happily lavish,
either in his diet or feasting? Let us hear himself professing openly; When
as I heard Attalus declayming against vices, Epist. 108.
errors, and the infirmities of life, oftentimes have I had compassion of
mankind, and have bel^^^ed that he (...) sublimed and raised above human^
^each. When he began (...) traduce our pleasures, to praise a chaste body, a
sober ^able, a pure mind; not only from unlawful pleasures, but al^o ^ro^
superfluous, I took a liking to temper mine appetite and bel^^ Of these
instructions some have sithence dwel^ with me my L^cillius; for I came with a
great alac^itie to all things. Afterward being reduced to a civil life, I
stored up some few of these ^hy good beginnings. Hereupon for all my life time
after, I renounced all Oysters and Mushromes. Ever since for my whole life time
I have abstayned from iniunction; since that ^^me my stomach has wanted wine,
neither have I ever since, vouch sa^ed to bath my self. Where was ever any
such frugalitie in any other place, or by what name is it called? And this have
I written of, in my commendation of Seneca, so let us no^ repea^e it he^re, now
as touching the rest of his life it was both serious and severe. 11. de Comment.
The Court corrupted him not, neither inclined he v^^o flattery, a vice almost
familiar, and allied to such places. No: he unto Nero. Suffer me to stay here
a little longer with thee, not to flatter thine ears, for this is not my
custom: I had rather offend thee by truth, then please thee by flattery. And
being now ready to die, in Tacitus he willed them to make known to the
Prince, 15. Annal. 3. de Ira.
That his mind was never inclined unto flatrerie^^, and that this was known
to no man better then to Nero w^o had more often made use of Senecaes liberty
then he had experience of his servitude. Moreover, what exaction and
examination of his manners and life? Again he himself, I use this power, and
daily examine my self when the light is out and my wife is silent, which is
now privy to my custom. I examine the whole day that is past by my self, and
consider both mine actions and words. I hide nothing from my self, I let
nothing slip: for why should I fear any of mine errors? When as I may say,
See that thou do this no more, for this time I pardon thee. Can the study of
wisdom appear either more greatly or more clearly? Finally, how often
appears his piety and submission toward God? I will set down one thing
that I gathered from him. Epist. 96.
If thou beleeuest me any ways, when I discover my most inward affections to
thee, I am thus formed in all occurrents, which seem either difficult or
dangerous. I obey not God, but I assent unto him; I follow him from my heart,
and not of necessity. There shall nothing ever befall me that I will grieve
at, or change my countenance for when it happens. I will pay no tribute
unwillingly, and many such like observed by me in my Manuduction or
Phisiologie. Yea, some of that unstained piety that Tertullian and the
Ancients call him Ours. I have in my Fragments set down some of his
counsels, let them make use of them. Furthermore, Otho Frigensis affirmed,
that Lucius Seneca was not only worthy to be reputed a Philosopher, but also
a Christian. And for these his eminent virtues sake, even in that age there was
a great good opinion held of him, yea and they destinated him to the Empire.
Tacitus plainly writes that this was set abroach, 15. Annal.
that the Empire should be delivered to Senecaes hands, as to one that was
guiltles, being chosen, by reason of the excellency of his virtues, to the
highest dignity. O Rome thou were unworthy of this felicity; neither did God
respect thee so well otherwise. Iuuenal Satyr. 10.
If all the people might have leave to speak,
What one of them (how desolate soever)
Would fear or doubt to honor Seneca
Far more then Nero.
Yet some there are that doubt of the realitie of his virtues, and think them
rather words and ostentation. Did he not therefore in his death make it
manifest how slightly he esteemed all humane things, how he addicted himself
to God?

CHAP. VIII. His Manfull and Constant life, set down out of Tacitus.
AND let us see the commodity thereof, but from whence should we gather it
rather then from Tacitus, the most faithfullest of all other Writers? Behold,
I set thee down his own words: Hereafter follows the slaughter of Annaeus
Seneca, most pleasing to the Prince, not because he had manifestly found him
guilty of treason, but to the end he might confound him by the sword, since
his attempt in poisoning him, so badly succeeded. For only Natalis discovered
no less. That he was sent to Seneca at such time as he was sick to visit
him, and to complain why he barred Piso of access unto him, that it would be
better for them if they should exercise their friendship with familiar
intercourse. And that Seneca answered, that mutual discourse and often
conference would be profitable for neither of them both, yet that his safety
depended on Pisoes security. This was Granius Siluanus, the Tribune of the
Praetoriall Band, commanded to relate unto him, and to enquire whether he knew
these speeches of Natalis, and acknowledged his own answers. He either by
chance or wittingly had returned that day out of Campania, and remained in a
house of pleasure of his in the Suburbs, above four miles off. Thither came
the Tribune about the evening, and beset the Village with a troop of his
soldiers. There discovered he unto him whilst he sat at supper with Pompeia
Paulina his wife, and two other of his friends, what the Emperors command
was. Seneca answered, that Natalis was sent unto him, and that he complained in
Pisoes behalf, that he had bin debarred from visiting him, and that he by
reason of his infirmity, and love of his quiet, had excused himself. But why
he should prefer a private man's security before his own, he had no cause;
nor that his mind was inclined to flattery, and that the same was best known
unto Nero, who had more oftentimes made proof of Senecaes liberty then
service. When as this answer was related by the Tribune, in the presence of
Poppea and Tigillinus, which were inward Counsailors to this merciless Prince,
he asked him whether Seneca had prepared himself for a voluntary death. Then
did the Tribune confirm, that he discovered no sign of fear, nor appearance
of dismay, either in his words or countenance. He is therefore commanded to
return, and to tell him of his death. Fabius Rusticus reports, that he
returned not by the same way he came, but that he stepped aside to Fenuis the
Prefect, and told him^ what Caesar had commanded, and asked his counsel
whether he should obey him, and that he was advised by him to execute his
charge, which was the fatal cowardlinesse of them all. For both Siluanus was
one of the Conspirators, and increased their heinous offenses, to whose revenge
he had consented; yet spared he both his speech and presence, and sent in one
of the Centurions to Seneca, to signify unto him the fatal sentence. He no
ways dismayed hereat, called for the tables of his Testament, which being
denied him by the Centurion, turning himself toward his friends, he
testified unto them, that since it was not permitted him to remunerate their
kindness toward him, yet testified he, that he left them yet that which of
all others he esteemed most worthy, namely, the image of his life, whereof if
they were mindful, they should carry away the fame of good learning, and of
so constant friendship. And therewithal recalleth their tears, and calls
them to constancy now by speeches, now by expostulations, after a more
intended manner; asking them, where are the precepts of wisdom? where that
premeditated resolution, which you have studied for so many years against
imminent dangers? For to whom was Neroes cruelty unknown? Neither remained
there any thing after the murder both of his mother and brother, but to annex
the death of his Governor and Master? When as he had in general said these or
such like words, he embraced his wife; and having somewhat tempered her against
the present fear, he prays and entreats her to moderate her grief, and
not to make it continual. But in contemplation of her life that was virtuously
led, to endure the lack of her husband with honest solaces. She contrariwise
alleged that her self was sentenced to die also, and calls for the
executioners help. Then Seneca loath to obscure her glory, and loving her
entirely, least he should leave her to the injuries of others, whom he so
dearly loved, said, I have showed thee the proportions and images of life, but
thou had rather have the glory of de^th^ I will not envy thy example. Let
the constancy be equal in us both in this so short a death, but thy renown
will be far greater. After which words, both of them ^ut their veins at on^
time. Seneca in that his body was old and lean, by reason of his sparing
diet, and that by this means his blood flowed more slowly; cut the veins of
his legs and hams likewise. And being wearied with cruel torments, lest by
his pain he should weaken his wives courage, and he by beholding her torments
should fall into some impatience, he persuaded her to step aside into another
chamber. And in the last moment being no ways disfurnished of his eloquence,
calling his writers about him, he delivered many things, which being
discovered to the world in his own words, I intend not to alter. But Nero
that had conceived no private hatred against Paulina, and being afraid lest
the odiousness of his cruelty should increase the more, commandet^ her death
to be hindered. By the exhortations of the soldiers, ^er slaves and bondmen
bind up her arms, and stop the blood, the matter being yet uncertain whether
it was with her consent. For amongst the common sort (who are readiest to
speak the worst) there wanted not some that believed, that during the time
that she feared that Nero was implacable, she sought to accompany her
husband in the same of his death: but when more apparent hopes were offered,
that then she was overcome with the sweetness of life, whereunto she added a
few years after, with a laudable memory toward her husband. But her face
and other parts of her body were grown so pale and discolored, that it
easily appeared that her vital spirits were much spent. In the mean while
Seneca seeing the protraction and slownesse of his death, besought Statius
Annaeus, a man well approved unto him, both for his faith in friendship, and
skill in Physic, to have and bring him that poison which in times past was
provided, and by which they were put to death who were by public judgment
condemned amongst the Athenians; and having it brought unto him he drunk it,
in vain, by reason that his lims were already cold, and his body shut up
against the force of the venom. At last he entered into a Bath of hot water,
besprinckling those his slaves that stood next about him, saying that he
offered up that liquor to Jove the deliuerer^ Then put into the Bath, and
stifled with the vapor thereof, he was buried without any solemnity of his
Funeral: for so had he set it down in his Will. Even then when as being very
rich and mighty, he disposed of his last Will. Hitherto Tacitus. Neither will I
repent my self i^ I insist lightly, and examine and illustrate his sayings: He
says, that this slaughter of his was most pleasing to the Prince. For of long
time he was aggrieued against this Master and Teacher of his in goodness and
equity, and his intent was to shake off that Rain of reverence once whereby
he was restrained against his will, by cutting him off; yet had he otherwise
sworn, as Suetonius witnesses: He compelled Seneca his Master, says he, to
choose his death, although when he oftentimes sought for a viaticum at his
hands, and surrendered up all his goods unto him: he had solemnly sworn that
he was suspected without cause, and that he had rather die then that he would
hurt him. He swore, that is, he deluded the gods also: he says, When as his
intent to poison him succeeded not: for he had attempted it; for so says the
same Tacitus in a former place, Some delivered poy^on unto Seneca by Neroes
command, prepared by the hands of one of his free men, called Cleonicus, but
that it was avoided by Seneca, by the discovery of his Libertine, or through
his own fear, whilst he sustained his life with a spare diet with wild
apples, and if he were athirst with running water. He goes forward: Or knowing
of it; as if he had knowledge of the conspiracy, and the prefixed time.
Likewise, he returned out of Campania, from some Lordship of his there. And
there truly oftentimes before his death lived he solitary, and in that place
wrote many of his Epistles to Lucillius. Four miles off, in some Manor of his
likewise, what was it Nomentanum? This did Xitho Polentinus write, but upon
mere conjecture, as I think. Neither does Tacitus admit it, who speaks of
some four miles off the City; but Nomentum is at least twelve miles off. No
signs of fear. Behold a death both worthy of a Philosopher and a Stoicke,
which those things that follow commend. The image of his life: if Seneca I pray
you were so absurd a fellow, as Dion speaks, should this be spoken of his
life in the shutting up? Would he thus dally and deceive his friends, and
delude his familiars? Sometimes with speech, that is, gently and familiarly,
Being hardened against present fear, I write it not again rashly, yet some man
may doubt, should it not be Molitam that she was mollified, having relation to
his wife? That which follows seems to infer the same, when he requires
her to temper her sorrow; and that which he annexeth: Thou see, says he, the
portra^ture of life. These, and diverse others are Senecaes own words, or very
like unto them, which were extant and well known, as presently after he
says: his aged body. By my reckoning he was some threscore and three, or
four years old. For that he was not elder, Neroes words to Seneca convince,
not spoken long time before that in Tac^tus. But thou art both ripe in years,
and sufficient for affairs, and the fruit of them, which thou can not
truly speak of the elder. Calling his writers about him. O man. O mighty
mind? To dictate that when he was a dying that might help posterity. For it
is not to be doubted but that they were such, and mere precepts both of
constancy and wisdom. The argument is, because they were published; which
should not be except they had been excellent. And because they were published,
Tacitus omits them. O improuidently done? O that we likewise had but a touch of
these Swan-like songs. A Bath of hot water: he means some Bathing-^ub, and
then first used he cold water when he should use it no more. Carried into his
Bath; that is, into his Stoue or dry Bath, as I think: for he shows that
by the vapor and acrimonie of the heat, he was strangled. Even then when he
was most rich and mighty: this is somewhat wherein Tacitus seems to carpe at
him, yet, if I conceive him rightly, Tacitus meant his funeral, and that he
forbad the solemnities thereof, but how in that He made his last Will. What,
would Ner^ have broken his Testament? who happily was appointed heir of the
greatest part thereof, and would suffer himself to loose nothing through
negligence. Or does he touch Senecaes parsimonie herein? But dead words pass
not far. Another man may find it.

CHAP. IX. His body, his sickenesses, his form.
I Have ended, except it please you that I write somewhat of his body: for men
delight, if I may so speak it, to take notice of the habitations and
receptacles of great wits: his body from his childehood was but weak. This
says he of his Aunt, after he was brought into the City. By her pious and
motherly care, Cons. ad Hell cap. 16. Epist. 54.
after I had been long time sick I recovered my health. And in a certain
Epistle: Sickness had given me a long safe conduct, and suddenly invaded me.
In what kind, say thou? And not without cause do thou ask me this,
since that there is not any one that is unknown to me. But to one kind of
sickness I seem as it were destinated; which why I should call by a Greek
name I know not, for it may aptly enough be called Wheosing or Astine. And
presently after he adds, All the incommodities or dangers of the body have
past by me. Behold an old man well exercised, when likewise being a young man,
was exercised with Distillations and Rhumes, by means whereof he seemed to be
inclined to a consumption. Himself again: That thou art troubled with often
distillations and agues: it grieves me the more, because I have had proof of
that kind of sickness, which in the beginning I contemned; Epist. 78.
for at first my youth could wear out the injury, and oppose it self boldly
against infirmities, at last I was masterd, and was brought to that pass, that
I my self was consumed by distillations. I was brought to an extreme
leanenesse, and oftentimes had I a mind to shorten my days, but my careful
and loving fathers old years restrained me. He writes expressly enough of his
leanenesse and consumption. Neither is it to be wondered at, that Caligula was
so persuaded by a woman: for Dio writes, When as Seneca had worthily and
happily handled a certain cause in the Senate, that this Prince waxed mad red
with anger, who only would seem to be eloquent, and bethought himself of
taking away Senecaes life, which he had done if one of his Concubins had not
told him this, That in vain prepared he a death for him that was already
dying, and was spent with a consumption. He gave credit to her; and this was
the means of Senecaes safety. So true is that which he (what was a looker
on?) wrote. Many men's sickness deferred their death, and it was a means of
their security, that they seemed ready to die. But till his last hour he had
but a dry and decayed body, why wonder we when either it was through his
infirmities or his studies? Epist. 45.
And Tacitus likewise adds a third cause, That his body was attenuated by a
slender diet. And that it was not bewtifull, Seneca himself expresses in
another place, That thou requirest my books, Epist. 104.
I do not therefore think my self more eloquent, no more then I should judge
my self fair because thou requirest my picture. He touches that he was not,
and that image, which is discovered of him by Fuluius Vrsinus, Lib. 3. cap. 7
shows not a countenance worthy that mind; yet confirmed he his body,
though weak, with more harder exercises, as in tilling the fields, and in
digging of Vineyards, whereof he makes mention in a certain Epistle of his,
and in his natural Questions, where he called himself A diligent digger of
Vineyards, and generally likewise of Gardens, Epist. 112.
which he terms his cunning.

CHAP. X. Those books of his that are extant.
THus of the body only; neither had we any fruit by it, but great from his
mind, and let us see them by an Index.

His Verses and Poems, which undoubtedly and plen^ifully he wrote, he himself
shows that he penned them in his exile: Lib. 14.
and Tacitus then likewise when he was stepped in years, and lived in Court. For
thus do his calumners object against him to Nero; For they objected against him
that he got the praise of eloquence to himself only, and wrote verses very
often, after that he knew that Nero was in love with them.

Orations of Declamations he made many and worthy one, yea, even in the Senate,
besides those which he wrote to the Prince, to be received likewise in the
Senate; neither doubt I but that the Edicts unto the people, and the grauer
Epistles were written or Dictated by him.

His book of Earthquake, which, as he testifies, he wrote when he was young,
in the sixth of his Natural Questions, chap. 4 Thou shall not want, for he has
handled the same matter again in the same Questions.

That of Matrimony, whether it were a book or an Epistle I know not, but S.
Jerome cites it against Iouinian, lib. I.

His History or Compendium out of Lactant. the 7. and 15. Chap.

His books of Superstition was undoubtedly one of his best ones, S August. in
his book de Ciuitate Dei praises it, and culleth somewhat out of it, and
Tertullian makes mention thereof in Apologetico.

His Dialogues, which Fabius names, and no more.

His Moral books, Lactantius cites them in his eleueth book, Chap. 11. and
in other places, and Seneca himself in his hundredth and sixth Epistle in the
beginning, and his Epistle 109. he wrote it in his later time, as it appears
there. O worthy work? And it grieves me that it is obscured.

His books of Exhortations: for there were many of them, as may be gathered
out of Lactantius, and see our Fragments. Who thinks that this likewise is
not to be numbered amongst his best works? There are other, yet such that thou
may not confidently ascribe to this man, as his books of notes, which seem
rather to be his fathers. Likewise of Causes; for so an unknown Chronicler
among the Britains testifies; He makes mention of Seneca de Causis, wherein
he says that Cato defined the office of an Orator thus: An Orator is a good
man that is, exercised in eloquence. But this belongs to the father also, and
they are the books of Controversies; in the first book whereof, and in the
very Praeface thou shall find that this of Catoes is cited there: and except I
forget my self, thou shall find it likewise in my Fragments, although these
smaller things do not so much ouerslip me, as I suffer them to pass by me.

But hark you Sir, make we no reckoning of his Epistles to S. Paul?

Those that are now extant are not so much worth, nay, it is most certain,
that they have all of them the same author, and that they were written, but by
some scarce learned Clerk in our disgrace. He trauelleth and attempteth to
speak Latin, whosoever it was that was the Author: did they not therefore write
one unto another? De scriptorib. ecclesiasticis.
S. Jerome, Epistola 53 ad Maced. and de Ciuitate Dei. cap. 10.
S. Augustine, and Pope Linus more ancient then them both auerre it, and it is
a passive opinion. And John of Salisbury likewise confidently writes, They
seem to be foolish, who reverence not him who, as it appears, deserved the
familiarity of the Apostle. De passione Di^i Pauli. Lib. 8. Polycar. cap. 13.
I therefore dare not wholly reject and contemn this; it may be there were
some, but others then these, if these^ I required the judgment of the best
Fathers.

The end of Senecaes life, written by Lipsius.
LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA. Of-Benefits. THE FIRST BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
I Place these Books amongst the last of his Philosophy, although they have
been planted in the forefront. But so it is if you consider the time; They
were all together written under Nero after Claudius death. A certain argument
whereof is, in that in the end of his first Book he writes very contemptibly
of Claudius, and traduceth his slight judgment: which he would not have done
had he been living. The Books are good; but in faith confused in order and
the handling; which a man though circumspect shall hardly expedite: yet will we
do our best. The first Book begins with a complaint of Ingratitude which
is usual, and yet greatest amongst vices. Therefore says he, That he will
write of Benefits what their force and property is. This handles he until
the fifth Chapter. Then defines he, that a Benefit consists not in the
matter, but the mind of him that bestows it, and has his weight from him: He
diduceth it by examples and arguments until the eleventh Chapter. There
proposes he two members to be entreated of. What Benefits are to be given; And
how: The first he performs in the end of the Book; the other he deferreth
till the Book following.

CHAP. I.
AMongst the many and manifold errors of such as both rashly and
inconsiderately lead their lives, Men's indiscretion in giving and receiving
benefits makes ingratitude so frequent.
there is nothing for the most part (most worthy Liberalis,) that in my
judgment is more hurtful; than that we neither know how to bestow, or how to
receive Benefits. For it consequently follows, that being badly lent, they
are worse satisfied, and being vn-restored, are too lately complained of; for
even then when they were given, even then were they lost: neither is it to be
wondered at, that amongst so many and mighty vices there is no one more
frequent than that of Ingratitude. For this in my judgment proceeds from
diverse causes. The first is, because we make not choice of such (on whom we are
to bestow our benefits) as are worthy to partake them; but being to take bonds
of any man, we diligently inquire after his lands and moueables: we sow not our
seeds in a fruitles and barren ground, and yet without any election we rather
betray, than bestow our benefits. Neither can I easily express, whether it be
more dishonest to deny, or redemand a benefit. For such is the nature of this
debt, that so much is to be received thereof, as is willingly repaied: but
neither to will, nor to be able to perform a man's promise, is most loathsome, A
^ood intent is a kind o^ satisfact^on.
in this respect, because to discharge a man's credit, the mind suffices,
though the means be deficient: For he restores a benefit that willingly owes
the same. But if there be a fault in them who are ungrateful even in
confession of a favor, there is also some defect in us. By experience we
^inde many ungrateful, and make more; because some-whiles we are grievous
vpbraiders and exactors: other-whiles full of lenity in our liberality, and
such that as soon as we have lent, repent us of the deed doing: other-whiles
complaining of men's faint correspondence, and accusing them of some fault and
offense they do unto us, how little soever it be. Thus corrupt we all
thanksgiving and remuneration, not only after we have given our benefit, but
whilst we are in giving of it. For which of us was content either lightly, or
at one time to be required? The errors of them that give.
which of us (when he but suspected that something would be demanded at his
hands) has not disdainefully frowned, or turned away his face, or pretended
some business, and by long discourses, and purposely-produced speech without
head or foot, forestalled the occasion of demanding a favor, and by diverse
subtle devises deluded hasty necessities, but being cunnngly incountred in
such sort as he must needly answer, has not either deferred (that is)
fearfully denied, or promised but difficultly, but with bended brows, and
strained and reproachful words? But no man willingly owes that, which he
received not voluntarily, but extorted violently. Can any man be thankful
unto him, who proudely either reprocheth a benefit, or wrathfully flung it to
him, In^or^ed and e^torted fau^ur is not ^^ank^sworthy.
or (being ouer-wear^ed) gave it him to the end to avoid his further trouble?
He is deceived whosoever hops to have a satisfaction at his hands, whom he
has dulled with delay, or tortured with expectation. A benefit is acknowledged
according to the intent wherewith it is given; and therefore we ought not to
give negligently. For every one is indebted to himself, for that which he
receives of a neglectfull debtor. Neither must there be flackenesse in our
liberality, because whereas in all offices the will of the giver is highly
esteemed, he that has bin slow in benefiting, has been long time unwilling.
Neither ought we to bestow our benefits contumeliously; for whereas by nature
it is so provided that injuries leave a more deep impression in our minds,
than good deserts: and the last are suddenly forgotten, where the first are
continually reserved in memory, what expects he who offends, whilst he
obliges an other? His satisfaction and gratuitie is sufficient if any man do
but pardon his benefit. The multitude of er^our ought not to ex^inguish a
v^rtue.
Neither is there any cause why the multitude of ungrateful men should make us
slower to deserve well: For first of all, (as I said) we increase the same:
Furthermore, neither are the immortal Gods deterred from their plentiful and
ceaseless bounty: notwithstanding the sacrilegious and neglectfull behauiors of
men. They use their nature, and infuse their bounty on all things, yea even on
those amongst the rest, that use the worst interpretation of their benefits and
largess. Let us follow these as our guides, (as far as our humane frailty
will permit us) let us give benefits, not lend on usury. That man is worthy to
be deceiued^ who thought upon requital when he presented his courtesy. But it
was ill employed. A laudable action must be ^^ntinued without exception.
Both our children and wives have deceived our hopes, yet do we both bring up
the one, and marry the other: and so obstinate are we against experiments, that
being overcome in war, and shipwrackt by sea, we give over neither: How much
more becomes it us to be constant in giving benefits? which, whosoever gives
not, because he has not received, gave that he might receive, and makes the
cause of the vngratful receiver justifiable, to whom in that sort at length it
is absurd not to repay, although he has power. How many are unworthy the
light, and yet the day rises to them? How many complain that they are borne?
Yet nature increases mankind, and suffers those to enjoy life, who loathe
to possess it. This is the property both of a great and good mind, not to
follow the fruit of Benefits, but the benefits themselves, and after the evil
to search likewise some good. What bounty were in this, to profit many, if no
man were deceived? Now is it a Virtue to give benefits, A virtuous man in his
good action is not d^terred by any occurrent.
whereof there is no hope of recompense again, and of which the fruit is
already received by a worthy man. So far should this thing be from
deceiving us, or making us flow to perform so worthy a thing, that although
my hope were utterly cut off for ever finding a grateful man, yet had I rather
be exempted from receiving benefits from any man, than not to bestow them.
Because that he which gives not, is more faulty than he which is
ungrateful. I will speak what I think: he that requiteth not a favor done
him, sins more; he that gives not, sooner.

CHAP. II.
If thou profusely wilt thy goods bestow Accius the Poets saying.

On every vulgar Person thou do know,
Full many favors must thou needly lose,
That one at length thou justly may dispose.

IN the former Verse thou may justly reprehend both these two clauses; for
neither must our benefits be profusedly lauished on every man, The nature of a
Benefit is changed by the use.
neither can the prodigality and largess of any thing be honest: especially
that of benefits. For if thou give them without judgment and discretion,
they cease to be benefits, and admit any other name whatsoever you will give
them. The sense following is wonderful, which repaireth the indemnities of
many benefits ill employed and lost, with one well bestowed. See, I pray you,
whether this be not more true, and more correspondent to the greatness of a
Benefactor, to exhort him to give, although he were assured that he should
employ no one gift well: For that is false. That many things are to be lost,
Nothing is lost that is rightly given.
because nothing is lost; the reason is for that he who loses, had numbered
it already amongst his desperate debts. The respect and manner in employing
good deeds is simple and plain, they are only delivered out; if any one to
whom they are trusted restore any thing, it is gained, if no man yield
satisfaction, there is nothing lost: I lent the same to the only intent to give
it. No man registreth his good deeds in his book of debtors. Neither is there
any exacting Usurer (how extreme) soever he be) that punctually impleadeth
his debtor on the day and hour of his payment. An honorable Benefactor never
thinks on the good turn he does, Only satis^^ction refreshes memory in a
good Benefactor.
except he that has received the same, refresh the memory thereof by
repaying him: Because otherwise it cease to be a benefit, and becomes a
debt. To bestow a favor in hope to receive an other, is a contemptible and
base usury. How badly soever thy former favors have fallen out, yet persevere
thou in bestowing upon others. They are best hoarded in the hands of the
ungrateful, whom either shame, or occasion, or imitation, may at length
fashion to be grateful. Persevere continually, and cease not to be
bountiful: Accomplish that good work which thou have begun, and perform
the duty of a good man. Relieve this man with thy goods, an other with thy
credit, that man by thy favor, this with thy good counsels, and wholesome
precepts.

CHAP. III.
WIld Beasts (yea even they that are most sauadge) acknowledge the good that is
done unto them. Neither is there a^y living creature so untamed and
intractable, that with gentle handling, and careful nourishing, is not made
gentle and familiar. Such as have the keeping and charge of the Lions, may
muffle and handle them without harm or danger. Benefits redoubled animater the
most ungrateful to satisfaction.
Meat so much humbles the fierceness and haughty courage of Elephants, that
they refuse no servile and base burdens. Finally, all these brute beasts, so
deficient in understanding, and esteem of the benefits they receive, at
length are tamed and made humble by the frequent and daily access of the same.
Is he ungrateful for one good turn? happily he will acknowledge a second.
Ha^h he forgotten two? the third may perhaps bring him to remembrance of all
the rest: He loses the good that he does, that believes that he has
ouer-quickly lost the same. But he that perseuereth in well-doing, and
redoubleth his benefits one upon the neck of the other, exhorts an
acknowledgement from the most obdurate and forgetfullest rec^iuer. He dare not
lift up his eyes against many good turns. Whither so ever he turns himself
in se^king to betray his own memory, there let him see thee beleager him on
every side by thy bounty: The force and properties whereof I will discover
unto thee, if first of all thou give me license to expalliate in a word or
two, and to touch certain things impertinent to this matter. Why is it that
the Ancients have fained that there are three The Poets fain^ the^ to ^e thr^e
Ma^d^ns, wh^^h as ^hey say were Daughters o^ IVP^TER, and V^NVS, The G^^^k^s
call them Charites, and ^he ^a^^nes Graces.

CHRYSIPPVS opinion.


Graces, that they are Sisters, having their hands in hands? and why are they
pictured laughing, young, and tender in years, Virgins, attired in loose
garments, clear and transparent? To this some answer, That there ought to be
three, because the one of them represents him that Bestows; the other, him
that Receives; the other, him that gratifieth and remunerateth the Benefit.
Others say, that there are three kinds of benefits, the one of those who
bestow the same, the other of those that restore the same, and the third of
those that receive, and therewithal requite good turns. Of these things
judge as thou please, the knowledge hereof full little profits us. What
means this dance of theirs, in which hand in hand they trip it always in a
round? To this intent it is, Because the order and process of benefits (that
pass through their hands that give the same) is such, that they return
again to the giver, and should wholly loose the grace of all which they should
effect, if ever they should be interrupted: contrariwise, that they always
retain their beauty, when they are united and hand-fasted together, and when
they are restored and acknowledged in their time. Therefore paint they them
laughing, Because the countenances of those that will deserve well at any man's
hands, should be smiling and pleasant, such as theirs is, who are wont to give
or receive benefits. They paint them young, because the memory of benefits
should not wax old. They feign them Virgins; because they are incorruptible,
sincere, holy, and profitable unto all men; Their garments shining, Videant
opera vestra bona,
and transparent, because good works would be seen. Let him that will admire
this miracle, invented by the f^bulous Grecians; let him, that list, maintain
that they are necessary and profitable: yet is there no man that will
justify, that the names which Hesiodus has given them are any ways pertinent
to this fable, or that purpose; or that knows why he termed the eldest of
them Aglaia^ the second Euphrosine; and the third Thalia. Each one has thought
good to wrest the interpretation of these words according to his own
fantasy, and has labored to fashion them, and conform them to some
congruencie of reason. Notwithstanding Hesiodus has given these young Maidens
that name, which was best liking to his humor. Homer also changed one of their
names, and called her Pasithae, and says, that she was married and espoused
to a husband, to the end thou should know that they were no Virgins. I will
find you out an other Poet that describes them girt, and apparrelled in
thick and gross robes. Mercury also is painted by them; not for that devise
and good discourse gives any luster or esteem to benefits, but because it so
pleased the painter to describe them. Chrisippus likewise (whose understanding
is so sharp and subtle, and that searches and sounds the very depth and
secret of matters, he that pretends to speak of good customs, and
conformeth his style to every man's understanding) farceth his whole book with
these follies, in so much as he speaks very little of the manner of giving,
receiving, or restoring benefits, in such sort as he mixeth not his fables
amidst his discourse, but rather mixeth his discourse amidst his fables. For,
besides these things which Hecaton has written, Chrisippus maintains, The
Poets feign the Sun had a certain number of hand-maides, which he called
the Houre^. See Ovid.
That the three Graces are the Daughters of Jupiter and Eurimone, somewhat
younger, but fairer than the Hours, for which cause they were given for
companions to the Goddess Venus. Chrisippus likewise makes a mystery of the
name of the Mother of these Graces, saying; That for this occasion she was
called Eurimone (which in Greek signifies a good patrimony) because it is
the property of a great and ample patrimony to know well how to employ and
bestow benefits; as if it were a matter of custom to give the name of Mother
after that she had children; or as if the Poets assigned the true name of all
things whereof they entreated. There were in Rome certain men whose office it
was to carry by heart the names of the Citizens, who during the election of
publik officers were always assistant.
For even as the Nomen-Clators or Beadles (whose office it is to relate their
names that ought to be solicited to purchase some dignity) sometimes make use
of their boldness, in stead of their memory, and forgetting the proper names
of such as they should certify, forge an other according to their own
fantasy: So Poets think it not pertinent to the matter to speak truth, but
either compelled by necessity, or surprised with affection of consonancie,
command each thing to be termed by that name that best beseems the harmony
and cadencie of their Verses. Neither are they to be blamed herein, because
they enlarge the matter with some new device of their own: for the first Poet
that shall speak of them, The vanit^e of Po^ts.
will give them what name he pleases. And to prove this to be true, behold
this name of Thalia (whereof principally all of them make mention) which in
Hesiodus is one of the three Graces, and in Homer one of the nine Muses.

CHAP. IIII.
But least I should seem to incur the same fault my self, which I reprehend
in others, I will relinquish all th^se things, which are so far from the
matter, that they no ways concern the same; I only pray thee to defend my
cause, if any man shall tax and reprehend me for this, He privily here tax^th
the Grecians inc^stantie
that among the rest I have not spared to reprove Chrisippus, being a man so
great, (but yet a Grecian) whose understanding is so acute and subtle, that it
oftentimes confounds and puzleth it self: for even then when he seems to
aim at the best, and to affect any thing: he only pricketh, but pierces not;
touches, but teaches not. And what subtlety or sharpness, I pray you, is
herein? Of benefits then we are to entreat, and to set down an order and
direction in this virtue, which chiefly concerns humane society: we are to
prefixe and set down a law of living, least inconsiderate facility in giving,
grow in favor under the color of benignity; least this observation, whilst
it temperateth liberality, (which must neither be defective nor superfluous)
restrain the same wholly. Men are to be taught to receive with
thankfulness, and to restore with the same correspondence, and to procure (in
regard of those that oblige them with any benefit) not only to be equal with
them in will, but to overcome them with greater gratuitie: because that he
who is obliged to acknowledge a good turn, requiteth not the same, except his
remuneration exceed the giuers merit. These are to be taught to impute
nothing; they to owe more; the one not to vpbraid^ the other more and more to
acknowledge. To this most honest contention of ouercomming one benefit by an
other so does Chrisippus exhort us, Chrisippus triuiall subti^tie.
that he says, that it is to be feared, least because the Graces are the
Daughters of Jupiter, it be reputed sacrilege to grow unthankful for good
turns, and injury be thereby offered to so amiable Damsels.

Teach thou me somewhat that may make me more ^orward to do good unto all
men, and more thankful unto those that have done me good offices. Tell us
something whereby the will of those that oblige by their bounty, and of those
who are obliged, are answerable, and made competent: so as the benefactors
keep no account or memory of their good deeds, and those that shall receive
the same, put them not in oblivion, but perpetually remember them. And let us
leave these follies and toies to Poets, whose project is to delight the ear,
and to invent a pleasing fable. But they that will heal men's disfigured and
vicious minds, that serve to maintain faith in humane things, and desire to
engraue the memory of good turns in the hearts of men; Let them speak
seriously, and employ their utmost forces: except thou happily think that it
is possible by a slight and fabulous discourse, and by old wives tales, that a
thing so pernicious, and so much abominable in the world, (as is the general
abolition of debts, and an acquittance of all good deeds) may be prohibited.

CHAP. V.
He returns to the matter.
But as I insist not on those things which are of small importance, so is it
likewise necessary that I endeavor my self to make this well known, that
first of all we ought to learn how much we are obliged, when we have
received a benefit. One man acknowledges himself indebted for the money he
has received, another for a Consulate, Bounty is not the ob^^^^ of the sense,
but is engrau^n in the heart.
another for the office of Priesthood, another for the government of a
Prouince^ yet no one of these things is properly a benefit, but only the mark
and sign of a benefit or merit. A benefit cannot be touched by the hand, but
is carried in the heart.

There is much difference betwixt the matter of bounty and bounty it self: For
this cause neither gold nor silver, (nor any other thing we receive at our
friends hands) is the true and re^ll benefit, The perpetuity of a b^ne^ite.
except his will only that bestows the same. The rude and ignorant sort
observe only that which is seen by the eyes, or thrust into the hands, or
which is delivered them, or they possess; and contrariwise, they make little
account of that which in realitie of truth they ought most to prise and praise
also. These things which we possess, these things which we see, and wherein
our covetousness is so engaged, are frail and incertaine: and either fortune,
or injustice can take them from us: but a benefit remains, although the
matter whereby it is made manifest, be lost and extinguished. Undoubtedly that
thing is well done which no force can defeat or diminish. I have redeemed
(say thou) my friend from the hands of pirates, and him has an other enemy
surprised and put in prison. Although this enemy has defrauded and acquitted
me of the use of this good work, yet can he not extinguish the good work it
self. I have saved some men's children from shipwreck, or have delivered them
from the force of the fire, and these has either some sickness or other
casual injury violently taken from me. Yet remains that without them,
which is given in them. All those things then which improperly usurp the name
of Benefits, are but the means and instruments, by the which the will of a
good friend is expressed. The like appears in many other things, so as it
falls out, that the true thing is in one place, and the sign and resemblance
thereof in an other. The Emperor or Chiefetaine of an army gives a chain of
gold to some one soldier of his that approved his value in some difficult
enterprise, moral or civil: a Crown unto another that first scaled the
enemies wall, or for that he saved a Citizens life. I ask you now what
precious thing has this Crown in it? what is this embroydered gown or
garment which is given to Noble-mens children? These ensigns of magistracy,
the axe and rods, what value are they of? what profits the Judges Tribunal,
or his painted Caroch? None of all these things are honor, but only signs of
honor. In the like manner that which is offered to the eye, is not the good
work or benefit, but only a luster and sign of the some.

CHAP. VI.
WHat therefore is a benefit? What a benefit is, and wherein it consis^eth.
It is a beneuolent action which causes and yields pleasure by that good it
communicates to others, inclined and disposed of it self, and of her proper
motion, to that she does. A benefit therefore consists not in that which is
either done or giu^n, but in the mind of him that either gives or does the
pleasure. And hereby may thou understand, that there is a great difference
betwixt these two, because the benevolence is alwaie^ good; but that which is
done, or given, is neither good nor evil. It is the mind that valueth small
things; The mind and heart are they that prize or diseste^me things.
illustrateth and exemplifieth obscure things; and contrariwise, sets light
by those things which are most esteemed and precious. Those things which we
desire and long after most, have a neutrall and indifferent nature, and are
neither good nor evil. That which is most materially to be considered, is,
whether the mind that governs them aims and impelleth them, from which all
things have their form. That then which is reckoned, or given, is not the
benefit, no more than the honor of the Gods depends not on those beasts that
are sacrificed unto them, (how costly and sumptuously soever they be) ^ut in
the piety and rectitude of those minds which worship them. A comparison to
this effect.
For which cause the good and virtuous men, who have nothing to present the
gods with but a cake and an earthen vessel, are held for religious. And
contrariwise, the worser sort are not exempted and acquitted of impiety,
although they have imbrewed the altars with much blood and sacri^ice.

CHAP. VII.
He proves his ^efinition.
IF benefits consisted in those things which we receive, and not in the will
wherewith they are given: so much the more greater should they be, the greater
the good turns are which we have received. This has some co^so^^ncie with
the alms which the widd^w and the Pharisie gave in the temple.
But this is false; for sometime he obliges us more that has given a little
magnificently; that has equalled the riches of Kings by his value and richer
mind: that gives a little, but freely; that forgets his own poverty and
necessity; whilst he respects mine; that had not only a will to help me,
but a great desire to favor me; that when he gave a benefit, Arguments of true
pi^^ie and bounty.
thought that he received the same; that gave without hope of recompense, and
received as though he had not given; that not only sought occasion to do good,
but laid hold on the opportunity, whereby he might profit others: Contrariwise
these things which either are extorted from the giver, or seem to fall from
his hands that gives them: although they seem highly prised and of great
appearance, yet, as I said, they are unworthy of thanks, because a gift is
much more gratefully accepted and reckoned of that comes from a free and
liberal hand, than from a full and rich-fisted penny-father. It is but a small
thing he has given me, but he could not give me more. But that which the other
has given me, is far more worth: Yet doubted he; yet delayed he when he
should give; yet grumbled he in bestowing; yet gave he presumptuously, excusing
himself by many circumstances, A sicken^sse o^ th^s age i^ you note it.
and would not please him to whom he lent his goods. Finally, that which he
gave me, was not so much to give it me, as to bestow it on his ambitious
thoughts.

CHAP. VIII.
WHen as many men offered many presents to Socrates, each one according to
their possessions and possibilities: one of his poorest scholars, whose name
was AEschines, came unto him, and said; I find nothing worthy thy self, that I
may give unto thy self: and in this one only kind I find my self to be
poor. That one thing therefore which is only in my possession, I offer thee,
which is my self; beseeching thee to accept of this gift such as it is, and to
consider that they which have given thee many things have reserved much more to
themselves. To this Socrates answered: Who doubts but that thou have offered
me a great present, were it not that thou valuest and esteemest thy self so
little, I will therefore take care to restore thy person to thy self, better
than at this time I receive him from thee. By this present of his, AEschines
exceeded Alcibiades (a man as mighty in mind as in me^nes) and all the
liberalities of all the most richest young men of Greece.

CHAP, IX.
THou see how a good mind finds m^tter of liberality, even in the
greatest gall and torment of misery. AEschines (me thinks) reasons thus in
himself: Think not Fortune, that thou have prevailed any thing against me in
making me poor, be thou never so refractarie; yet will I find a present that
is worthy Socrates; and since I can not give any thing that is thine, or thou
have given me, I will give mine own, my self, and the best of me. You must
not think that AEschines valewed himself basely to himself, that knew none
more worthy present besides himself without himself. This ingenious young
man found out the m^anes, how he might make Socrates his, by giving him what he
was. We are not to respect the value of these things that are given, but the
virtue of him that gives. A subtle and politic man willingly gives
audience to those that demand and propose unreasonable suites, and intending no
ways to help indeed, nourishes their fraudulent hope with deceiptfull
words. But yet worse is his opinion, that with proud language, grave and
severe looks, has disdain^fully set out the sum of his riches. For they
that make a show to respect and reverence a man on whom Fortune smileth, are
the first that detest and seek to do him mischief; and such notwithstanding,
that if they had the power, would themselves do that which the other did. In
this place Lipsius and Anicetus observe a d^sect which may be c^niectured by
the small conformity between^ the antecedent and subsequent reasons.
Some there are that not privately and behind their backs, but openly and to
their faces have scorned and mocked at other men's wives, and yet have abandoned
their own to those that loved them. There are women likewise, that in these
days account those married men rustique, inhumane, and of froward condition,
that will not suffer their wives to get up into their Caroches, and prance
through the streets to be gazed at by the passers by. A sin more imitated in
thi^ age than any virtue.
That man who is not noted for intertaining a Mistress, or for courting his
neighbors wife, him do these Matrons account base in condition and heart;
base in choice and election, and only worthy to court their basest
Chamber-maids. Hence is it, that in these days adultery is reputed the most
honestest method and manner (that is) to wed a woman. Some had rather consent
never to entertain marriage, than not to have such a woman to his wife, that
was not debauched from her husband. Th^re is neither measure nor rule in men's
expense. They contemn an other man's poverty, and fear none but their own:
they dread no other evil, they never pardon injury, they tyrannize over the
weaker sort, and outrage them by fo^^^ or fear. For to see Provinces sacked,
the chair of Justice sold, and judgments set to sale to him that will give
most, is not to be wondered at, since it is permitted by the Law of Nations to
sell that thou have bought.

CHAP. X.
BUT the subject whereof I entreat, has so much distracted and transported
me, that it has carried me further than I thought. Let us in such sort
endeavor to depart out of this life, A notable lesson o^ an E^hnike ^or all
good Chris^ians.
that our sins may not seem to be rooted and settled in the same. Hereof our
Ancestors and Predecessors complained, hereat we our selves are agrieued; and
for this will our Successors sigh, because good customs are abolished,
impieties have pre-eminence, and humane affairs grow worse and worse, and men
leave no wickedness or sin unsought after. And the worst is that these vices
do, and shall remain in the same place, although they be a little moved here
and there, as the Floods of the Sea, which when the tide comes, are carried
out into the Ocean, and upon the ebb are contained a while on the brimme and
bank of the river. In this time shall adulteries be more frequent than any
other vice, and modesty shall turn loose and Libertine. In an other Age the
fury of Banqueting shall flourish, and the indecent abundance of Kitchins:
the shops wherein so infamously men's Patrimonies are sold and bartered. An
other time shall come of immesurable and unbridled curiosity in apparrelling
the body, and painting the face, which external fuke shows how foul and
filthy the soul is internally. At this time great men abusing their
authority, shall be both audacious and insolent. At an other time men shall
flesh themselves with publiqu^ and private cruelties, and in the furious
madness of ^iuill dissension, whereby every sacred and sanctified thing is
profaned. The time will come wherein drunkenness shall be honored, and he
shall be esteemed most virtuous and gallant that has sucked in the greatest
excess of wine. Vices continue not always in one and the same place, they
agree not well together, they change time and place, they urge and give chase
one to an other. In a word, we may always boldly say thus of our selves, that
we are evil, that we have been evil, and (unwillingly I speak it) we
always shall be. Ingratum dixeris, and omnia dixeris.
In all times there will be Murderers, Tyrants, Thi^ues, Adulterers, Robbers,
Church-breakers, and Traitors, and the least of all these is the ungrateful
man, except it be that all these are the children of ingratitude, without which
scarcely any evil enterprise has been plotted or performed. Beware and
esteem thou this as the most grievous and greatest of crimes, let him not take
hold of thee; and in another man pardon the same as if it were the slightest of
all others. For in effect all the injury that he did thee consists in this,
that thou did loose thy good deed: but comfort thy self with this, that thou
did not loose the better part thereof, which is, the honor to have given the
same. But even as we ought to be well advised, not to employ our favors on
those that will not heartily and freely acknowledge the same, so ought we
sometimes to hazard a benefit, although we are out of hope of acknowledgement
or satisfaction. And not only when we are afraid that they will be
ungrateful, but also then when we shall be most assured that they have already
bin approved and known for ungrateful. Even as if I can, I am undoubtedly
bound to restore unto a father (provided that it be not with any hazard of mine
own fortunes) his children whom I had saved from a great peril: So likewise
ought I to defend a virtuous and worthy man, and second him in the danger
wherein I shall find him, though it be with the loss and expense of mine own
blood. If likewise by my outcrie I can deliver a man from the hands of thieues,
(although he be unworthy of any favor) I ought never to repent my self if
by my words I have saved a wicked man's life.

CHAP. XI.
IT follows now that we declare what sorts of benefits we ought to give,
and after what manner we ought to give them. First of all let us give things
necessary, then profitable, thirdly agreeable, and permanent. Let us begin with
that which is n^cessarie. The ne^essarie.
For we account our selves far more beholding to him that has given us our
life, than to him that enlarges our honors or instructs us in virtues.
Never will he esteem it a thing according to the value if he can easily slight
it over, and say, take it to thee, I want it not, I am contented with mine
own. So doing thou will not be obliged to restore that which has bin given
thee, but thou will disdain it and cast it away. But amongst those things
which are necessary some hold the first place, and they are those without
which we cannot live. Others hold the second: and they are those without which
we ought not to live; Others the third, without which we would not deserve to
live: The first of this note are, to be delivered out of the enemies hands,
exempted from a tyrants wrath and proscription, and other perils, which being
both diverse and incertaine beleager and besiege man's life. Which so ever of
these we shall have prevented or cut off, the more greater and terrible it is,
the greater thanks shall we receive. For they will bethink them from what
evils we have delivered them, and the precedent fear^ of danger which they have
had, reuiueth their remembrance, and gives life to the desert fore-past, when
they bethink themselves from how many miseries they are delivered. Yet hereby
is it not intended if we should maliciously defer or deny our succors to him
that is in any danger, to the end that fear should give a greater weight to
our benefit or merit. In the second rank are those things without which truly
we may live, but live so miserably, as death were better than the life; of
which kind are liberty, modesty, and a good mind. In the last place we rank
those things, which alliance and parentage, familiar conuersations, and long
use, has made us always repute and account most dear and precious: as our
Children, our Wives and houses, and all these things whereunto we have so much
addicted and dedicated our hearts and desires, that we had rather die than
divide our selves from their company. After these necessary things succeed
those that are profitable, The profitable.
whose nature and argument is far more ample and diverse. Here enters money (not
superfluous but sufficient to entertain an honorable means of life) here
enters honor and the good carriage of affairs, to the end to attain to
greater matters. For nothing is more profitable than to be made profitable to a
man's own self. Profit is first to be respected in regard of a man's
particular. The agreeable.
The rest is but even great abundance and superfluity which spoileth men, and
makes them effeminate. But when we would intend to do a pleasure, we must
provide that the opportunity may make it more pleasing; that the thing we
intend to present be not common and ordinary; that few men have had the like
in times past, and that as few yet in these our days can match the pattern:
and if it be not rich in it self, at least let the time and place, wherein we
give the same^ cause it to be more heighly prized. Let us bethink our selves
what present we might make, that might yield some pleasure and contentment,
that might be more oftentimes seen and handled, to the end that so often as
he should take my present into his hands, so oftentimes he should have and
hold me in his remembrance. We ought likewise to beware that we send not
unseemly presents; as to a woman, or an old and impotent man, toiles or other
necessary instruments of hunting; to a Country Clown books; or nets to him
that is studious and addicted to his book. Contrariwise also we ought to be
very circumspect, least thinking to send some agreeable present, we send to
every one such thing as may reproach him of his infirmity; as wine to a drunken
man, and medicines to a sick man. For this begins to resemble rather an
outrage than a present, If that which is given do tax the imperfection of him
that receives the same.

CHAP. XII.
The permanent.
IF it be in our election to bestow what we list, Let us present such things as
may continue longest, to the end that the good which we do, and gifts we
bestow, may be lasting and of long continuance. Things of conti^^ance live
long^st in the rec^iuers me^orie.
Because amongst those that receive, there are few so thankful that they
remember them of that they have received, except they have it always in their
sight. And the ungrateful also, when the present and favor is always in
their eyes, are thereby drawn into the memory thereof, which suffers them
not to forget themselves, but renders and redoubleth the memory of him that
gave the same. So much the rather therefore let us seek out things that are
of continuance, because we ought never to vpbraide a benefit but suffer the
present it self to quicken and revive decaying memory. More willingly will I
give silver plate than ready money, more willingly statues, than apparel, and
such things as in a short time are worn out by use. Few there are that
remember to give thanks after they have pocketted the present. Many there are
that no longer make estimate of a good turn, than whilst they may make use
thereof. If therefore it possibly might be so, I would not that my gift should
be consummate, or worn out of memory, my desire is it should be extant, and
of long continuance, and accompany my friend and live jointly with him. There
is no man so foolish that had need to be taught; What discretion th^re ^^ght
to be used ^n pres^nting.
that he should not inuit his friend, and present him with the public
shows of fencing, and baiting of savage beasts, when as these proclaimed
sports have been performed and shown, or Summer suites for Winter time, and
Winter garments in heat of Summer; we need no more than common sense to make
us know what is fitting and acceptable. We must respect the time, the places,
the persons, because in the moments of time, or occasion, some things are
grateful and ungrateful. How much more acceptable is it if we give that,
which the person to whom we give has not, than that wherewith he is
abundantly stored? if we present him with that which he has long sought and
could not find, than that which is merchandable and easily bought in every
place? Our gifts ought rather to be exquisite and rare, than precious and rich,
and such and so extraordinary, that he that seems to have least want of any
thing by reason of his abundance, may accept and hold them dear for their
raritie and novelty. Raritie, ^e the pre^ent never so small ^aketh it
ac^eptable.
Were they but common apples which in a short space by reason of their
abundance would be displeasant to the whole world, yet if a man make a present
of them in their prime ripeness, and when there is a scarcity of them, they
will be far more acceptable and esteemed. These presents likewise are not
without honor, which either no man else has presented them with, or we our
selves have not given to any other.

CHAP. XIII.
WHen as Alexander of Macedon after his Oriental victories had raised his
thoughts above humane reach; certain Ambassadors were sent unto him in the
behalf of the Corinthians, to congratulate his victories, and to present him
with the Title of a free Citizen of Corinth. Which offer of theirs when
Alexander had scornefully derided, one of the Ambassadors said unto him:
Consider, noble Prince, that we have never imparted this privilege of our City
at any time to any else, but thy self, and invincible Hercules. Which when
Alexander had heard, he thankefully entertained the honor they had offered
him, sumptuously feasted, and gratefully embraced the Ambassadors, conceiving
thus, and contemplating, not what they were who offered them their City, but
who he was to whom they had first presented the same before him. This man who
was so addicted, and drunken in glory: (whereof he neither knew the nature
nor the measure,) following the traces of Hercules and Liber, yet not content
himself to bound his ambition within the limits where they ceased, he respected
what companions in honor the Corinthians had presented him with, And thereby
finding himself to be compared with Hercules, he thought that already he was
possessed of heaven, which vain and fruitless hope he foolishly embraced.
For tell me, I pray you, wherein might this young fool in any thing resemble or
compare himself with Hercules, who had but happy temeritie in stead of
resolution and value. The true difference betwixt Hercules and Alexander.
Hercules achieved no conquest for his own particular interest, he trauersed
the whole world, not desiring possessions, but revenging injuries. What desire
of conquest, or affection of profit, could this Enemy of evil men, this
Protector of good men, this Pacifier both of Land and Sea in any sort conceive
or have? But this man from his young years was a Thief, a Forager of
Countries, the ruin both of his Friends and Enemies, who held it for his
chiefest happiness to be a terror to all mortal men; remembering not that
not only the most cruel beasts, but also the most ^eeble and coward, are
redoubted, and feared for their pernicious venom.

CHAP. XIIII.
LEt us now return unto our purpose. That benefit which is given to every man,
is grateful to no man. No man will ever think that a Tauerner or Hos^ler
entertaineth him as a friend. No man supposes himself to be invited by him
that furnishes a feast to entertain a whole City. For a man may say, what
pleasure has he done me? he has favored me no otherwise than he would a
stranger, or an enemy, or the basest fellow, or plaier, he might have met
withal. But he thought me more worthy or better esteemed than any other?
nothing less: that which he has done is but to content his own humor and
infirmity. If thou desire that thy presents may be acceptable, make choice
of some rare thing. Who will account himself obliged for a courtesy which is
done unto every man? Let no man interpret these things in that nature as if I
would restrain men's liberality, and repress them more than reason required.
I will not so bound the same that it may not be general, or employed where a
man pleases; yet my desire is that it should not be extrauagant or
misimploied, but justly intended. A man may so sort his good turns, and so
honestly distribute the same, that they who have received them, although they
be many, may suppose that they are not favored in common, but in particular.
Let every man have some familiar note, whereby he that receives may conjecture
that he is more inwardly respected by him that bestows the benefit. Let us
give him an occasion to say; I have not received more than that other man, but
that which was given me came with a freer bounty and good will. I have
received the same present which an other man had, yet I more speedily and
readily than he, Means to fashion men to acceptance and gratuitie.
where as he long before had merited the same. Some there are that have had
the same favors, yet not delivered with the same gratulatorie speeches, nor
presented with the like courtesy from the Benefactor. This man received after
he had entreated for his benefit, but I, when I was besought to accept the
same. Such a man received a rich present; it is true: but he could more easily
give recompense; for being as he is a man of many years, and without heirs,
he promises great hopes to the Benefactor. But that which I received is of
more esteem, because that which he has given me is without all hope of
restitution. Even as a Curtizan so divides her self amongst many, that each
one has a particular insinuation and proof to be more favored than the rest:
So he that desires that his courtesies should be esteemed, ought to bethink
him, not only in what sort he may oblige all men unto him, but how every one
may have something whereby he may think that he is preferred before the rest.
For mine own part I desire not to restrain any man from distributing his
liberalities as him lists: the more and greater his largess is, the more
honorable and praiseworthy they be; yet wish I notwithstanding that his
bounty should be bounded with judgment. For these things that are given
rashly and without consideration, are never well reputed or accounted of. For
this cause if any man should think that in commanding this, I would by this
means banish and exterminate liberality, and should not afford the same
limits large enough; Undoubtedly he has made but little use and received
less profit of these my instructions. For is there any virtue that I have more
prized? or whereunto I have more incited men than to that? to whom appertains
these exhortations and instructions more than to me, who by liberality would
establish and assure a firm commerce and society amongst men?

CHAP. XV.
Reason and judgment ought to accompany liberality: prodigality
extingu^sheth it.
HAppily thou will enquire how far Bounty ought to be limited, for that it is
certain, that action or design of the soul can be decent or honest, although
it has had his original from a just will, but that whose weight and just
measure is transformed into virtue? To this I answer, that here I only
pretend, that liberality ought not to be prodigal or misimploied. Then is it
that a man should be glad to have received a good turn, (yea willingly, and
with open handes^) when reason and judgment has addressed it to their hands,
who are worthy of the same, when by temeritie of fortune, or by heat of
courage, it is not unprovided and disfurnished of good counsel, and when a
man may take pleasure to show it to the world, and profess himself to be the
Author. Will thou esteem that for a benefit which thou have received from such
a man's hands, whom thou art ashamed to name? Contrariwise, how much more
agreeable are those good turns unto us, how inwardly are they grounded and
ingrafted in our memories, (from whence they are inseparable) when they content
us, and make our thoughts more pleasing, in imagining from whom, than what we
have received? Crispus Pasienus was accustomed to say, that he more esteemed
other men's judgments, than their gifts, and other men's gifts, than their
judgment; and annexed this example; I had rather (said he) have AV^VSTVS
judgment, yet love I well CLAUDIUS bounty. But for mine own part, I think
that no man ought to desire a benefit at his hands, whose judgment is
deficient and idle. What then? should not that which Claudius gave be received?
why not? but in such manner as if thou had received it from Fortunes hand,
which thou might imagine might suddenly become a misfortune. But why say
thou should we separate those things which are so united? because we cannot
call that a benefit which wants his principal part, that is, to be done and
given with heartinesse and deliberation. A great sum of money, if it be not
given prudently, and with a will grounded on reason, is a treasure, but no
benefit.

Finally, there are many things which we may receive, and yet not be obliged
for them.

The end of the first Book of Benefits.
LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE SECOND BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
HE assumeth and entreats of an other part, How Benefits are to be given.
He gives many precepts hereupon; that we bestow them willingly, speedily,
and without dubitation. That some things are to be given openly, other some
things secretly. Then what they are which are hurtful, if they be not given,
although they be demanded, and yet not dishonest, and such as may breed future
infamy. Then that the persons ought to be esteemed both of him that gives,
and him that receives, that both of them may be decent. An other part of the
book: How he that receives should behave himself, from whom he receives,
and how, especially gratefully. By occasion he decideth what it is that makes
men ungrateful: Pride, Avarice, Envy: Finally, in many words he disputes of
gratitude, and proves that it consists on will, where as wealth and means
wants.

CHAP. I.
LET us look into and examine that (most worthy Liberalis) which as yet
remains of the first; that is to say: In what manner we ought to bestow a
benefit. To the better performance whereof I shall in my opinion set down the
most expedite way and means. So let us give as we would receive a good turn.
But above all things what we do, let us do willingly, speedily, and without
hesitation or doubting: Ungrateful is that benefit that has long time stuck
betwixt his fingers that gives the same, that a man seems hardly to part
withal; and delivers in such sort, as if he had robbed himself of it. Yea
if we cannot give so soon as we would, and that we are enforced to delay our
benefit, let us strive at leastwise by all the means possible, He that
delaieth or dallieth in his bounty, loses his gift and merit.
that it be not supposed, that we have hung long time in deliberation or
suspicion, whether we should give or no: He that doubts, is next to him that
denies, and deserves no thanks for the same. For since in a benefit there is
nothing more agreeable than the will of him that gives the same, he that in
delaying gives us to understand that he gives against his will, in effect
gives nothing, but rather knew not how to keep it from his clutches, that
drew it from his hands. Diverse there are that are bountiful for shame sake:
but those pleasures that are readily bestowed, that are given before they are
demanded, that are vnattended by any delay (except it be the modesty of him
that receives the same) are far more agreeable. First of all it behooves us
to prevent every man's desire, Willingness and prevention are the signs of a
free and liberal mind, delay and dilatum of a suspicious and niggardly heart.
and afterward to follow the same. But the best is to prevent and present our
favors before they be sought after. And for that an honest man blusheth
always for modesty when he demands any thing, whosoever he be that
remitteth and excuses him of this torment, redoubleth and multiplieth the
pleasure. He received not gratis, that received when he demanded. Because
(according to the opinion of the grauest Authors and our Ancestors) there is
nothing that costs so much, as that which is bought with prayers. Yes, grace
that is purchased by prayers.
Men would more sparingly tender their vows unto the gods, if they should do
it openly; and rather desire we in secret to pray and perform our vows unto
them, because our desire is that our thoughts should be only known unto them.

CHAP. II.
THe words are distasteful, and full of disturbance, for a man of honor (with
abashed and abased look) to say, I beseech you. Labor thou then to excuse thy
friend herein, and whomsoever else thou intendest to oblige unto thee by thy
bounty. How forwardly soever a man give, that gives after he is entreated,
let him know this lesson, that he gives too late. Endeavor therefore to
divine and foresee every man's will; and when thou understand the same,
discharge him of the grievous necessity of asking. Know thou that that benefit
is most pleasing, and of longest perpetuity in man's memory, That comes
unsought for and vndemanded. And if happily thou have not had the opportunity
to prevent his necessity, yet at leastwise intercept the reasons and motives
which he should use in requesting thy courtesy: Vrbanitie in a Heathen
inimitable by Christians, as the Christian world is carried in these days.
thou ought to make him believe by thy readiness and forwardness, that
thou had a desire to do him friendship before he demanded the same. And as
meat which is presented a sick man in due season profits him much; And
simple water being given in time of necessity, is sometimes of as much worth
and value as a medicine: even so a pleasure although it be but little and small
in value, if it be freely and fitly given, if it be done in due time, and
fitting to the occasion, valueth and commends it self the more, and
surmounteth the estimate and worth of a rich and precious present, which has
been long time devised and dreamt upon. It is not to be doubted, but that he
who so readily distributed his largess, performed the same as willingly. And
therefore with ioyfulnesse fulfilleth he that he intended, and thereby gives
testimony of his good mind.

CHAP. III.
THe immesurable silence of some, and their slownes in speech (the
first-borne-breed of sullennes and sottish gravity) has made many men loose
their benefits, notwithstanding their great worth and value. For although they
promise with their tongues, they deny in the carriage of their eyes. How far
better were it to accompany good works with good words, and to give credit to
the good office thou do with familiar and courteous language? Challenge him
that requires aught at thy hands, for this cause, that he has deferred so
long time to make use of thee, in forming against him this familiar quarrel:
Terms befitting a liberal mind.
I am much displeased with thee, for that thou have not acquainted me sooner
with that which thou desire at my hands, for that thou have used too many
ceremonies and circumstances in requiring my help; for that thou have employed
a third means for that which thou might have commanded thy self: For mine
own part, I hold my self most happy and contented, that thou have sought to
make proof of the good affection I bear thee. From hence forth if thou be
pressed with any necessity, command and claim whatsoeu^r is min^ as thine
own: Let this one error pass, I pardon thy rusticitie. Hereby shall thou make
him esteem and value thy noble mind more, than all that he came to claim at
thy hands, how precious soever it be. Then does the benefactors virtue most
manifestly appear, then is his bounty remarkable, when as the other passing
from him, shall depart muttering to himself: Great has been my gains this
day; It more contents me that I have found him such a man, than if the
benefit had b^ene redoubled unto me by any other way, for to a mind such as
this is I shall never yield retribution or condign satisfaction.

CHAP. IIII.
But many there be, that by the bitterness of their words, and the
crabbednesse of their looks, The errors of those that give after an evil
manner.
make their favors odious, by using such speech, and expressing such pride,
that it repents him that demanded the courtesy, that he has obtained it.
It falls out oftentimes likewise, that after the promise made, there are some
delays and procrastinations: yet is there not any thing more loathsome and
distastefull, A lost courtesy to receive after much craving.
than when a grace is once granted, to be enforced to go and redemaund it
again. The favors we intend, ought not to be deferred, which cost more
sometimes in their recovery than in their promise. This man must thou beseech
to put his Lord in remembrance, that man to receive the favor for thee; thus
one simple gift (by passing through many men's hands) is diminished and lessened
very much, and he has least satisfaction that has made promise thereof. For
they, whom afterward we must importune, get the better part of the thanks. If
therefore thou will have thy gifts to be acceptable and grateful, thou must
procure that they pass through their hands that sought the same untouched and
entire, and (as they say) without any diduction. Let no man intercept, let no
man detain them; there is no man that in that which thou art to give, can
purchase any credit, but that he impaireth and diminishes thine.

CHAP. V.
Refusal i^ better ^^an incer^aintie.
THere is nothing more tedious and irksome to a man, than to hang long in
suspense. There are some that had rather that the hopes of their pretensions
were scantled, than delayed. And many there are (too fowly possessed of this
vice) that with a depraved ambition protract and defer those things they have
already promised, to no other end, but to increase the number of those that
solicit and sue to them. Such are these ministers of kingly majesty, who take
delight in the admiration, A pattern of a proud Cour^^^r.
which other men conceive of their greatness and pomp, who think themselves
disabled in their power, if by many delays and longer procrastinations they
make not every man understand how powerful and graced they be. They perform
nothing speedily, they dispatch nothing at once. Their injuries are headlong
and sudden, their benefits silly and slow. Wherefore think that most true
which the Comicke Poet says: Do thou not so much of thy thanks diminish,
As thou delay'st thy benefit to finish?


From thence arise those complaints which ingenious sorrow expresses, Do
speedily, if thou will do any thing; and nothing is more dear. I had rather
thou should have utterly denied me. Such manner of discourse use they at that
time that are wearied with a long delay, which makes them already contemn
and hate the good, which they heartily expected. Can they for this be esteemed
ungrateful? Even as that cruelty is the greatest that brings out and
protracteth the pain^, and to dispatch a man of life quickly, is in some
occasions a kind and sort of mercy, (because in the end the last torment
draws with it self the remainder of it self, True liberality ^ imp^t^ent
of d^l^y.
and the time precedent, is the greatest part of the punishment that
succeeds:) so the less time I am held in suspense, the greater thanks owe I
for the favor I receive. The expectation of things, how good and honest soever
they be, is both tedious and displeasant: and where as there are many benefits
which are a total remedy to some instant necessity; he that suffers the
indigent either to be tortured by delay, whom forth with he could dispatch, or
makes him languish in expectation, and grow forlorn before he compass the
favor, abuses his own benefit, and lays violent hands on his own good
work. Bis dat qui cito dat.
All true liberality is addressed and expedite, and it is the property of him
that does willingly, to do quickly. He that gives later than he should do,
and wearieth out both time and occasion, before he assist and succor the
indigent, witnesses by his actions, that he had never a will to succor him.
And by this means loses he in one benefit two most important things, that
is to say, time, and the argument of his friendly intention and will, because
to will a thing ouer-late, is not to will it at all.

CHAP. VI.
IN all affairs (Liberalis) that which imports most, is the manner and
fashion of speaking or doing any thing. Celeritie has done much, ^ fit
similitude.
Delay has defrauded more. Even as in weapons of all sorts, the edge and point
both of the one and of the other, are of the same force and keenen^sse as the
rest are; but there is a great difference in them, The manner of giving makes
the gift either plausible or dist^^^efull.
if they be enforced by a brawnie and forcible arm, or managed by a faint and
feeble arm. It is one and the same sword, that slightly raceth and rudely
pierces through: that which most imports, is the strength of the arm that
governs it. The like may be said of that which a man gives; the only
difference is, in the manner of giving. O how precious, and how sweet a thing
is it, to encounter with a Benefactor, that consents not to be clawed with
acclamations and thankes-giuings! and that as soon as he bestows a
benevolence, forgets the same! for to reprove him to whom thou art most
beneficial, and to intermix injuries and outrages with courtesies and good
turns, is no less than madness. Benefits therefore are not to be exasperated
or intermedled with any distaste or misliking. Though happily thou have
something that thou have reason to reprehend him in, reserve it till an other
time more proper and convenient.

CHAP, VII.
FABIVS VERRVCOSVS called that disgraceful courtesy, Enforced courtesy has no
merit^.
which was presented by a niggardly hand, Grauelly and stale bread; which a
hungry man must of necessity take, yet can hardly eat, Tiberius Caesar being
requested by Marcus Allius (who had been Praetor) to discharge him of those
many debts, wherein he was engaged: Caesar commanded him to set down the
names of all his creditors. This is not properly to give, but to summon them to
whom he owed any thing to composition. As soon as he had received the
register of their number, he wrote a schedule wherein he commanded to pay his
prodigal nephews debt, and gave it to him, and therewithal so bitter and
contumelious a reprehension, as the poor man was so much dismayed, that he
neither knew that he had received any money for his creditors, from the
Emperors hands; or any favor for himself: He delivered him from his
Creditors, but obliged not him unto himself. Some motive there was that guided
Tiberius herein; and in my judgment, He excuses Tiberiu^ in some sort.
that he did, was to the end, that no man should importune him more in such
like requests; and this happily was an effectual way, through the shame and
reproof of one man to repress the disordinate desires of covetousness in all
other men. Yet he that gives a benefit, must absolutely follow a far
different way.

CHAP. VIII.
BY any means procure thou, that whatsoever thou intendest to give, may be
adorned with all that which either may make thy gift more acceptable, or better
received: for otherwise thou do no good work, but disclose and reprehend an
hidden error. And that I may express by the way (in my judgment) what my
opinion is herein, me thinks it is a thing ill-beseeming a Prince, to give a
favor with an affront and infamy: nevertheless, for all this Tiberius could
never by this manner of dealing fly that whith he feared: for many others
came afterward and besought him in the same sort, and for the same relief as
Allius did, all whom he commanded to inform the Senate, in what manner they
had spent that money they had borrowed, and thereupon gave them certain sums
of money. This is no liberality, but a censure; this is no succor, but a
principal tribute. Because that cannot be esteemed a good work, which I
cannot call to memory without blushing, and disgrace: I am sent to the Judge,
to obtain that which I required, I was enforced to suffer a criminal process.

CHAP. IX.
The twofold manner of employing benefi^s.
THe Wise men therefore, and such as are Authors of Wisdom, advise, that some
benefits are to be given openly, othersome secretly. Those are openly to be
given, which may honor and magnify him that receives them, such as are
Military presents and dignities, and whatsoever other gift, which the more
public and notorious it is, the more honorable it becomes. Again, those
gifts, which neither promote nor advance a man's fortune, nor augment his
reputation, but only succor his infirmity, his necessity, and ignominy:
must be given so secretly, that he only may take notice thereof that has the
benefit and assistance thereby. And sometimes also we ought to deceive him
that we intend to relieve, in such a sort as our gift may come unto his hands,
and yet he ignorant from whom he received the same.

CHAP. X.
He proves by example that favors are to be done in secret.
ARcesilaus (as it is reported) being aduertized, that a poor friend of his
(who concealed his necessities, as much as in him lay) was fallen sick, and
yet notwithstanding would not discover the poverty he endured in his
sickness; bethought him that he should not do amiss, to relieve him
secretly. For which cause, under color to come and vi^ite him, he left a
bag full of money under the sick man's pillow; to the end that the poor
soul (being more bashful than wise) might rather think that he had found
that which he desired, than that he received it as a benefit. What then?
should he not know (say thou) from whom the favor came? No. At the first
let him be ignorant thereof, since the not knowing thereof is a better part of
the good work. Afterward I will do him many other pleasures, I will give him
so many other things, that in the end he shall perceive who was the first
Author of them: Finally, he shall not know that he has received, and I shall
understand that I have given. Me thinks thou tellest me, that this is
nothing. I answer thee, That it is insufficient, if so it be, that by thy good
work thou seek interest and praise: but if thou desire to do it in that
kind, that it may be more and better profitable to him that receives the
same, thou would content thy self to be a witness, that thou thy self
did it. Because thou seem not to take pleasure in doing thy good work,
but desire to make it known, that thou have done the same: I will (say
thou) that he know that I did him the good turn. This is to seek out a
debtor. But my desire is (say thou) that he should know it. Tell me why?
If it be more profitable for him that receives the benefit, not to know
whence it comes; if it be more honest, and more agreeable that he know it
not,: will thou not in this point be of our opinion? I will that he know it.
Thou would not then save a man's life if the night were dark. I deny not but
that upon some just occasion it may be lawful for a man to take some
contentment in his thankfulness that has received a benefit. Do your
charity secretly, that you may be rewarded openly.
But if then when it is needful to assist and succor our friend, we perceive
that he should receive some disgrace thereby, if the good that we do him,
shall sort to his indignity, except it be done secretly: We ought not to
insinuate or make known our good turns. Were it answerable to honesty to
tell him that it was I that have given it him? whereas by the precise and
principal precepts I am forbidden at any time to vpbraid him, or to refresh
the memory of my favor done unto him: An inviolable law in doing good.
For this is an inviolable law betwixt him that gives, and him that
receives, that the one ought incontinently to forget the good he has done,
and the other ought to have a continual remembrance of that which he has
received. There is nothing that more tyreth and trauaileth a good mind, than to
be oftentimes reproched and vpbraided with those pleasures which have been
shown him.

CHAP. XI.
IT contenteth me much to make a public narration of that exclamation which a
certain Roman used, who had been saved by one of Caesar's friends (during the
time of the proscriptions of the Triumuirate) who being unable any further to
endure his pride, most manfully cried out thus; Redeliuer me I pray thee to
C^sar, and the power of Justice: How long will thou reproach and vpbraide me
saying, I have saved thee, I have delivered thee from death? If I forget not my
self, I must confess that thou gave me life; but if I remember me of thy
often reproaches, I can not conceive but that thou have given me death. I owe
thee nothing; if thou have saved me to no other end, but to make an ostentation
of thy vanity. How long will thou lead me about for a spectacle to men, and a
torture to my self? how long will it be ^re thou suffer me to forget my hard
fortune? Had I been led in triumph by the enemy, it had been but one day^s
miserable spectacle. Secrecy must accompany benefits.
Never ought we to disclose that which we have given: he that vpbraideth a
courtesy redemaundeth it. We must not importune^ we ought never to refresh the
memory of a former pleasure, but by seconding it by another. Neither ought we
to disclose it unto others. Let him that has done the good office, conceal
it: let him that has received the same, disclose it. Otherwise it may be said
unto him as it was to one who publicly vaunted and boasted of the pleasures
he had done^ Happily (said he that had r^ceiued the gift) thou will d^ny but
that thou have received again that which thou gave mee^ And as the other
asked him when? He answered; Many times, and in many places: As if ^ee should
say^ As oftentimes, and in as many places as thou have vaunted thereof vain^ly;
what need had thou to speak it? or usurp upon an other man^ office? An
other man might have done it more honestly, who reckoning up the good he has
received at thy hands, might praise thee in diverse things, which thou can
not, or do not discover. At leastwise thou will say of me, that I am
ungrateful, ^f concealing thine own bounty and desert, I make it not known
who have received the same. But this ought not to be; but rather, if any should
relate before thee, what good thou have done me, and the evil I commit, in not
confessing thy goodness, thou ought pesently to make this answer. Truly he is
most worthy of far greater benefits, which I know that I have better will,
than power to perform. Which speech we ought to utter, not with flattering
dissimulation, or fained pretense, or as some men do, who make a show to
reject that which they would feign draw unto them. Briefly, we ought to use all
kind of sweetness and courtesy, as much as in us lies. The husbandman should
loose all his labor, if after he has cast his corn into the ground, he make
no more reckoning of that which he has sowed. The corn cannot come to
maturitie without much manuring and regard, nothing can bring forth fruit, if
from the beginning to the end it be not labored and handled with due industry.
The same condition is of all benefits. Can there be a greater care, and more
circumspect diligence in this world, than that which the parents have over
their children? and yet their pains should be lost, if so be they should
abandon them in their infancy: if their deuoire and paternall piety should
not nourish them long, Bounty must be accompanied with love and charity.
and tenderly protect that unto the end which Nature has recommended unto
them. All other benefits are of the self same condition; except thou helpest
them, thou loosest them. It is a small matter to have given them. We must
likewise nourish them. If thou will have them thankful who are obliged unto
thee, thou must not only give them bountifully, but love them heartily. But
especially (as I said) let us have a care that we offend not their ^ares;
admonition is tedious, reproach ingendreth hatred. There is nothing so much to
be avoided in giving a benefit, as for a man to show him self proud. Whereto
serves an arrogant and disdainefull look? to what end are swelling and
reproachful words? Pride makes charity nothing.
Thine own good works will sufficiently praise thee: we ought to alien from
us all vain boasting. The actions will express themselves when we are
silent. That which a man gives proudly, is not only displeasant, but also
odious.

CHAP. XII.
CAEsar gave Pompeius Pennus his life (if it may be said, that he gives life
that takes it not away.) Afterward, when he had absolved him, and the other
humbled himself to give thanks; Caesar presented him his left foot to kiss.
In^olence of great fortune.
They that pretend to excuse him, and deny that it was done by way of
insolence, say, Homer has alw^yes some body ^^ s^o^^h his errors.
that he did it but to show his gilded Buskins; or rather, or more rightly,
his buskins of gold, enchaced and enriched with precious pearls. In so doing,
what outrage might the^e be? What evil was it for a man (although in former
times he had been Consul) to kiss gold and pearl, since no better place
might be found more seemly and honest in Caesar's person for him to kiss? A
man only borne to change and reduce the manners of an absolute and free State
into servitude, worse than that of the Persians: he thought it a small matter
than an old Senator, who in times past had been graced with so many and great
honors, should in the presence of Princes in submissiue sort li^ prostrate
before him, after the manner of a vanquished Enemy before the feet of the
Conque^or. This was he that endeavored to find something out more base^ than
the knee, whereby he might subject and suppress the liberty of Rome. Is not
this to tread the Majesty of a Commonweal under foot? Yea with a left foot
will some men say (and very answerable to the purpose^) For he had not showed
himself vilainously furious and insolent enough, to have taken his fair
buskins to assist and sit in judgment upon the life of one who had be^ne a
Consul, if the Emperor had not also thrust his studs and golden buttons into
a Senators mouth.

CHAP. XIII.
O Pride of great fortune! O pernicious folly! O how happy is he that is not
constrained to receive any pleasure at thy hands! O how well art thou
instructed to convert each benefit into injury! How much art thou delighted in
outrage and excess! O how ill do all things beseem them! O how highly
raisest thou thy self, to abase thy self more lowly! O how approuest thou,
that thou acknowledgest not those goods wherein thou take so much pride! Thou
corruptest whatsoever thou give. I would ask thee therefore for what cause
thou thus forgettest thy self? what peruerteth both thy looks and the habit
of thy countenance? had thou rather go masked than show thy face open? most
pleasing are those courtesies which are given with a kind, smiling, and
pleasing countenance, which when my Superior gave me, he exulted not over me;
but as much as in him lay showed me all the benignity and favor that he could
imagine, and abasing himself so far as to equal himself with me, he
disclothed his gifts of all kind of pomp, he observed a fit time, wherein
rather he might help me upon occasion, than in necessity. In one and the
same sort, in my judgment, we may persuade these men that they loose not
their benefits through insolence, if we shall prove unto them that their
benefits do not therefore seem more great, because they have been given with
insolent and tumultuous speeches; and that they themselves cannot for so doing
seem greater in any man's eyes; and that the greatness of pride is but vain,
and such, as that it draws the things of most esteem into hatred and
contempt.

CHAP. XIIII.
SOme things there are which prove so harmefull and prejudicial to those that
receive the same, that to deny them, and not to give them, proves to be
favor and benefit. This say I, because we ought rather to intend the profit,
than the affection and will of those that require our favors. For oft-times we
wish and labor for those things that are damageable unto us. Neither can we
judge how harmefull it is, because our affection blinds and perturbeth our
judgment; but when the desire is pacified and allaid, when that ardent
impression and impulsion of the mind (which exileth from it self all good
counsel) is extinguished and abated, then abhor we those pernicious Authors
of those unhappy and evil gifts. Discretion in benevolence.
Even as to sick men we deny water, and to those that are melancholy and
loath their li^es, a knife; or to such as are in love, all that which their
inflamed and ardent affection, or rather desperation, doteth after. So ought we
to persevere diligently and humbly in denying and refusing all that which may
do much harm to those who miserably and blindly demand it at our hands.
Furthermore, it imports every man to have a care and observation, not only
of the beginning of his gifts, but of the end and issue also, which they ought
to have; and so procure, that they may be such things, that not only give
content in the receiving, but delight also when they are received. Many there
are that say, I know that this will not be profitable unto him, but what shall
I do? He entreats me, and I cannot deny his suit: let him look unto it, he
shall complain of himself, and not of me. Thou abusest thy self, and art
deceived: it is of thee and none other (and that justly) he will complain, as
soon as he shall recover his senses and perfect wits; and that passion which
perturbed and inflamed his mind, remitteth and cease. And why should he not
hate such a man who assisted him to his damage and danger? To condescend unto
his request that asks that which will be harmefull unto him, is a cruel
bounty, and a pleasing and affable hatred: Let us give such things as may
please more and more by their use, and that may never breed any damage. I will
not give money which in my knowledge shall be given unto a harlot, because I
desire not to be partaker in any dishonest action, or in evil counsel.
Limitations in bounty.
If I can, I will at leastwise retire him; if not, I will not boulster or
further his sin. Whether it be choler that transporteth him farther than
becomes him, or heat of ambition misleadeth him from the secur^st course, I
will not so far forget my self, that hereafter he may say, He has killed me
with kindness. Oftentimes there is very little difference betwixt a friends
gift and an enemies wishes and execution. All the mischief an enemy can wish
us, the foolish affection of a friend may bring us: There is nothing more
absurd (and yet this oftentimes falls out) than not to know a difference
betwixt hate and favor.

CHAP. XV.
LEt us never give any thing that may redound to our disgrace and damage. And
since the greatest friendship we can intend to any man, is to make him equal
with our selves, and suffer him in every sort and jointly to enjoy our goods
and fortunes; so ought we equally to advise him to the good and honor of us
both. I will give unto him in his necessity, Proximus vnusquisque sibi.
yet in such manner and measure, that I will shun mine own misery: If I see
him in danger of life, I will succor him; provided always, that I be
ascertained of mine own security: except I shall be the ransom of some great
man, or some affair of greater importance. I will do no good turn that I
would be ashamed to ask: I will not greaten that which is of small value;
neither will I consent, that such a thing, which in it self is of much worth,
should be received with little estimation: For even as he loses the grace and
remuneration of his good work, that registreth the same in the book of his
accounts; so he that shows how great the pleasure is which he has done,
priseth not, but reprocheth and dispraiseth his pleasure he has done. Let
every man have a respect to his faculty and ^orces, least either we give
more or succor less than is answerable to our abilities. Respect of persons.
Let us also have a respect and esteem of the person and quality of him to
whom we give; because there are some gifts that are of less value than the
greatness of him that gives the same requires; and other-some which are not
answerable to the merit of him that receives the same. Confer therefore and
compare with thy self the conditions of him that gives, and him that
receives, and examine the qualities of that which is given (whether it be
little or much) in respect of him that gives the same; and whether likewise
thy present be too little for him that receives, or whether he be incapable of
so much.

CHAP. XVI.
THat furious and outrageous Alexander (who never settled his thoughts but on
great and mighty enterprises) foolishly gave a City to a certain follower of
his; Alexanders indiscr^tion in giving is the cause why he is taxed in this
place.
who measuring his own unworthiness, and desirous to discharge himself of
the envy he might incur, by receiving so great a benefit, came unto
Alexander, and told him, That neither in fortune or condition he deserved so
much. To whom Alexander answered^ I respect not what becomes thee to receive,
but that which in honor becomes me to give: A speech that in appearance was
both kingly and heroical, but in effect most fond and foolish. For all those
things which are a man's own, become not other men to receive or accept;
Circumstances in giving.
but it imports us to consider what that is which is given; to whom, when,
why, in what place, and other circumstances, without which thou can not
justify thine action. O proud and insolent creature! If it becomes not him
to receive this thy gift, as little befitteth it thee to give the same. There
ought to be a difference and proportion both of persons and dignities, as
whereas there is a measure in virtues every ways, as greatly sins he that
exceeds, as he that gives too little. And although this beseems thee, and
thy fortune has raised thee so high, that thy royal gifts are no less than
Cities (which with how greater mind might thou not have taken, than lauishly
distributed) yet is there some more less, than that thou should hide and
bury a City in their bosoms.

CHAP. XVII.
DIOGENES the Cinique required a talent at Antigonus hands, and being repulsed
by him, besought a penny: To which he answered, That it was too little for a
Although these Pagans had not a perfect knowledge of the virtue of wilful
poverty, yet had they some resemblance and smacke thereof, and in particular
there was a Sect of them called Ciniques, that were of this profession, amongst
whom this Diogenes was one that required this alme^ a^ Antigonus h^nds.
Cinique to ask, or a King to give. This was but a bare and idle c^uill: For
hereby found he out an invention to give neither: in the penny he respected and
had reference to his Kingly majesty; in the talent to the Cinique: whereas he
might have given a penny as to a Cinique, and a talent as he was a King. I must
needly grant, that there are some things of so great value, that they should
not be given unto a Cinique, yet is there nothing likewise so little, that a
liberal and courteous King cannot honestly give. But if thou ask my opinion
herein, I cannot but allow Antigonus action: For it is an intolerable error in
those who make profession to contemn money, afterward to beg it shamefully.
Thou have proclaimed open war against wealth and riches, thou have publicly
protested thy hatred against money: This habit have thou taken on thee, and
this needly must thou personate. Unworthily and wickedly shall thou do to hunt
and haunt after money, under pretense of so laudable a poverty and necessity
as thou professest. It concerns each man therefore to have as great a regard
and respect of himself, as of him to whom he would do a pleasure. There must
be a proportion in good works betwixt the giver and the receiver
I will use our friend Chrysippus similitude of the play at ball, which
undoubtedly falls either through his default that serves the same, or his
that receives it: Then does the ball keep his due course, when as betwixt the
hands of both the gamesters, it fitly flies to and fro, being served by the
one, and reinforced back again by the other: yet ought a good Tennis-player
to serve either easily or strongly, according as he perceives his companion to
be further or nearer off him. The same reason is there in good deeds: for if
they be not answerably applied to the person of him that gives, and him that
receives, they will never slip from the hands of the one, or come into the
posses^ion of the other, according as they ought to do. If we pass the time
with an exercised and cunning gamester, we will strike the ball more boldly and
sti^fely: for on which side soever it is bandied, an expedite and nimble hand
will return and strike it back. Contrariwise, if we play with a nouice and
young learner, we neither will strike it so stiffely, not level it so
strongly; but serving and striking it gently, we will give the ball to his
hand; and if he rebandie it back, we return it as gently. The same manner
must we observe in doing our good works: Let us teach some how to receive
them, and judge it a sufficient recompenc^, if they endeavor themselves to be
thankful; if they are, if they will be thankful. For oftentimes we make
them ungrateful, and help to keep them so, as if our good turns were every
way so great, that there might not be a thankfulness which might in any sort
equal them. The same pretend those malicious gamesters, that deceive and chase
their contrary party here and there, to the spoil of the game, which cannot
be maintained and continue, except ther^ be consent and conformity between
them both. There are diverse of so perverse and devilish a nature, so proud,
and imputative in that they bestow, that they had rather loose that which they
lent, than to seem that they have received the same. Were it not a more better
and friendly course to suffer them to acquit their deuoir toward us, and to
favor and succor them, when they would acknowledge the goods which they have
received at our hands? To take all in good part, and at such time as they
should only give thanks in words, to give them as favorable audience as if
they satisfied us, and to allow that he who finds himself obliged to us,
should have the means to recompense us? That Usurer is commonly hardly thought
of, if he exact his debts rudely. He likewise is worse thought of, if then when
his money is tendered him, he will not receive it, but deferreth to admit the
payment. A benefit is as worthily received back again when it is returned, as
it is given honestly, The conditions of a perfect and absolute well-giuer.
when it is vndemaunded. The best well-doer is he, that has done a courtesy
freely, and never sought requital, that took a pleasure when as any man could
freely repay that which he had friendly lent and given, and utterly forgotten,
and that receives not as a return of his favor, but as a grace and
remuneration.

CHAP. XVIII.
SOme there are that not only give a benefit proudly, Here begins the
proo^e, that we ought not receive at every man's hands.
but also receive it disdainefully, which ought to be avoided. But now let us
pass over to that other part, and entreat therein, how men should behave
themselves in receiving benefits. Whatsoever act of virtue consists on two
persons, exacteth as much from the one, as from the other: when as thou have
diligently examined what the father ought to be, thou shall find it no less
difficulty to conceive what the son ought to be. There are some duties
belonging to the husband, and some also that appertain unto the wife. These
deserve one and the same rule and measure, which (as Hecaton says) is very
hard to observe and keep. A hard matter is it to perform that which honesti^
commands, yea that also which nearest approaches honestie^ For we are not
only tied to perform the same, but to perform it with reason. She it is that
must be our guide in the way we are to hold. The things of smallest moment,
Reason is the guide and di^po^er of liberality.
and those of greatest importance, are to be governed by her counsel: and as
she counsaileth, so ought we to give. And first of all she will advise us this,
That we ought not to receive a favor at every man's hands. From whom then shall
we receive? To answer thee in a word; It is from those to whom we would have
given. For more carefully ought we to make choice of those from whom we would
receive, than of those to whom we would give: For least many inconveniences
happen (which are wont to follow) know this, that it is a grievous torment to
be indebted and obliged to him, to whom thou would owe nothing. And
contrariwise, it is a thing most pleasing and agreeable, to have received a
benefit at his hands, whom although he should offer thee hard measure, thou
could both love and affect: But the greatest misery ^or a good and
shamefast man is to love and to be obliged to such a man a^ he can neither
fancy nor favor. Here must I needly and oftentimes advertise thee, that I
speak not of those truly wi^e and virtuous men, which take pleasure in that
which they ought to do, and are Lords of their own minds; that prefixe such
Laws unto themselves as best likes them; and having prefixed them, keep
them: but of these imperfect men, that are willing to follow virtue, whose
affections and passions are forcibly impelled to obey reason. I ought then to
make an especial election and choice of him from whom I would receive a
pleasure; and it concerns me much more carefully to choose and diligently
seek out such a one to whom I will impart my benefit, than such a one to whom
I will trust my money: because that to the one I am not bound to restore any
more than I have received, and having repayed my debt, I am acquitted and
discharged ou^ of his books: but to the other I must repay more than I have
received, and having recompensed the good he has done me, yet is not this my
entire obligation: the friendship must continue and flourish between us. For
after I have remunerated his kindness, I am tied to renew and refresh it
again: And above all things the law of friendship admonishes me, That I
receive not a kindness from any that is unworthy. Such is the right, such is
the sacred law of Benefits (from whence friendship takes his original.) It is
not always in our choice (as Hecaton says) to refuse a pleasure, and to say I
will not accept it: We ought sometimes to receive a benefit against our minds.
A Tyrant will give thee somewhat; and so cruel and outrageous is he, that if
thou refusest his present, he will account it no less than an injury and
indignity: To this will thou say, shall I not accept the same? make reckoning
that this King is a Thief, and a Pirate, (since in mind he is no better than
a Thief, or a Pirate) what shall I do in this case? I see that he is unworthy
that I should owe him any thing. To this I answer then, when I say that thou
art to make thy choice of him, to whom thou will be obliged, it is not intended
in a case of so great violence and fear; because where these prevail,
election perishes: but if thou be at thine own choice, if thou have liberty
to elect what thou listest, then have thou means to make use of that which
best pleases thee. But if the necessity of occasion restrain thy election,
know this, that thou do not receive, but obey: no man is obliged in
receiving a thing which he cannot refuse; if thou desire to know, if I would
have that thou give me, bring to pass that I may refuse what thou offerest
me: But he gave thee thy life: it skilleth not what the thing is which is
given, but whether he that gave, and he that received the gift, gave and
received the same willingly. Thou art not therefore my defender, because thou
have saved me. Poison sometimes has been a medicine, and yet for all that it
is not numbered amongst those things that are wholesome. Some things there are,
which although they profit us much, yet they oblige us not.

CHAP. XIX.
A Certain man that came with a resolution to kill a Tyrant, gave him a stroke
whereby he opened him a dangerous impostume. For this the Tyrant gave him no
thanks, although by wounding him he had healed him of a sickness, whereon
his Physicians durst not lay their hands. Thou see there is no great moment
in the thing it self, because he seemed not to have given a benefit, who with
an evil intention procured his profit. Fortune it was that wrought the good,
and from the man it was the injury came: we have beheld a Lion in the
Amphitheater, who calling to memory one of those who had been condemned to
fight against wild beasts (because in times past he had been his Governor)
protected him from the fury of the rest. Shall we not then say that the
succors which the Lion gave was a benefit? No^ Because he neither had will to
do it, neither did it to the intent to do good. We are to repute and rank
him with this beast, who attempted to cut off the Tyrants life. Both this gave
life, and the other also, but neither this nor that a benefit; because it is no
benefit, or good work, which I am enforced to receive. It is no benefit that
makes me indebted to him I would not. First must thou give me the freedom
and power of my self, and next the benefit.

CHAP. XX.
MEn have oft-times debated and disputed of Marcus Brutus, whether he ought to
accept a grace, and receive a pardon at Julius Caesar's hands, who in his
judgment deserved not to breath or live. What reason moved Brutus to conspire
and kill him, I will express and handle in an other place. For mine own part,
although I esteemed Brutus in all other things a wise and virtuous man, yet me
seems that in this he committed a great error, and neglected the Doctrine of
the Stoickes; who either feared the name of a King, (whereas the best and most
happiest estate of a City is to live under a just and virtuous Prince) or
hoped that liberty would be had there where so great a reward was prefixed to
those that commanded, and those that served; or imagined that such a City as
this might repossesse her ancient honor, and former luster, when virtue and
the primitive Laws were either abolished, or wholly extinguished; Or that
Justice, Right, and Law, should be inuiolably observed in such a place, where
he had seen so many thousand men at shocke and battle, not to the intent to
discern whether they were to obey and serve, but to resolve them under whom
they ought to serve and obey. O how great oblivion possessed this man! how much
forgot he both the nature of affairs, and the state of his City! to suppose
that by the death of one man there should not some other start up after him,
that would usurp over the commonweal; whereas after so many Kings
slaughtered, either by the sword, or by lightning, they grew Vassalls and
Subjects to a tyrannous This was the seventh and last King of the Romans,
^alled (and that ius^ly) by the name of Tarquine the proud. He died a banished
man out of his Country, and deprived of his Kingdom.
Tarquine; yet ought h^ to have accepted his life, and yet for all this
notwithstanding was he not obliged to repute and esteem him as his Father, for
that iniurio^sly and against all right he had usurped the authority, to give
him his life: For he saved him not, who flew him not, neither gave he him
life, but dismissed him from dying.

CHAP. XXI.
THis rather, and more rightly, may be drawn into some question, what a poor
captive should do, when as a man prostituted in body, infamous and dishonest
in speech, offers to pay down the price of his ransom? Shall I suffer my
self to be redeemed by so impure and base a wretch? and again, when I am
discharged, what thanks shall I return him? Shall I live with an impudent and
s^urrilous fellow? shall I not live with him that has redeemed me? no truly,
for herein thus stands my opinion. Even from any such a one would I receive
the money which I would employ for my redemption, yet so would I receive it as
money upon interest, not as an act of courtesy. I will repay him his money, and
if after that I shall find him in any danger, or pressed by necessity, I will
relieve his wants, prevent his danger, yet contract no such friendship with
him, as should be correspondent betwixt men of equal virtue. Neither will I
reckon him for such a one as has saved my life, but make account of him as an
usurer, to whom I know I must repay back again that which I have borrowed.
Contrariwise, if there be some worthy and virtuous person, from whom I should
receive a courtesy, yet ought I not receive the same, if I knew that thereby
he should incur any detriment, because that I am assured that he is
addressed (though it be to his own hinderance, nay which is more, to the
hazard of his life) to do me a pleasure. I understand that he is resolved
(knowing me to be accused of a capital crime) to plead my cause, and to
undertake my defense, though it be to his disgrace, and the displeasure of his
Prince. I should show my self an enemy unto him (if indeuouring himself to
vnder^goe danger for my sake.) I should not perform that which is most easy
for me to accomplish, that is, to entertain the damage my self, without his
detriment or danger. Here Hecaton sets down an example (which is no ways
answerable to the purpose) of Archelaus, who would not receive a certain sum
of money which was offered him by a young man, who was subject to the government
of his Father, because he would not offend the covetous and niggardly parent.
What did Archelaus herein that was worthy praise? Is it because he would not
receive that which was stolen from his Father? Is it because he would not
entertain the gift, least he should be tied to recompense, and restore it
again? What modesty or virtue used he in not accepting other men's money? But
leaving this, if it be necessary to set down an example of a generous mind,
let us make use of Graecinus Julius, a man of rare virtue; whom Caius Caesar
put to death for this cause only; in that he was a better and honester man,
than any one ought to be, who should live with and under a Tyrant. This man, at
such time as he received a certain quantity of money from the hands of his
friends (who contributed and levied the same to defray the charge and expense
of those public plays which he prepared) refused a great sum of money
which This Fabius Persicus was Consul under Tibetius, a man of great note in
Rome.
Fabius Persicus sent unto him. His friends which respected not him that sent
the money, but only the money that was sent, reproved him, because he would not
accept the same. Will you (said he) have me receive a benefit from such a man,
whom I would not pledge, although he offered me the cup? And when as This
Rebillius was Consul under Julius Caesar, and Augustus Caesar, who died in his
Consulship.
Rebillius (one who sometimes had been Consul, yet of no less infamy) had
sent him a greater sum of money, and instantly entreated him to command his
servants to receive the same. I pray you (said he) pardon me, for PERSICVS
offered me the same, and yet I accepted it not. Here undoubtedly some reasons
are deficient wh^nce grow^th this question, as may be gathered by the little
conformity it has wi^h that which g^^^h before. See Pincianus upon this place.
Whether is this to receive presents, or to examine the receivers?

CHAP. XXII.
WHen as we determine to receive any thing, let us receive it with a glad some
countenance, expressing thereby the pleasure which we take, and manifesting to
the Bene^actor how thankefully we accept the same, to the end that he may
gather the present fruit of his good work. For it is a just cause of gladness
to see a man's friend contented; and more just to be the cause of his
contentment. Let us make it known unto him that his presents were very
pleasing unto us, let us express the affections of our will^ not only in his
own hearing, but in every place wheresoever we be. For he that receives a
good turn with gladsome acceptance, has already satisfied the first payment
of the requital.

CHAP. XXIII.
He that covertly desires to receive a kindness has but an evil intention.
SOme there are that will not receive but in secret, they admit not witnesses of
the good which is done unto them. Believe thou that such men have very bad and
base minds: Even as he that does a good turn, ought not to publish the same,
or make it known, but in as much as he knows that he that receives the
same will conceive a contentment thereby: so he also that receives the same
ought to make it publicly known. Receive not that which thou art ashamed to
owe. Some there are that secretly, and in corners, and by whisperings in the
ear, give thanks for the good they have received: This is not mode^tie and
shamefastness, but an undoubted sign of their will and intent to deny the
benefit. He that gives thanks in secret, and admits no witnesses of the
good he has received, is ungrateful. Some there are that will borrow money,
provided that it be not in their own names, neither certified by obligation,
nor signed by witnesses. They that will not that any man should have notice of
the good is done unto them, resemble such men. They are afraid to make it
known, to the intent they may be thought rather to have obtained the same by
their own virtue, than by an other man's liberality and assistance. Such as
these are, are least officious unto those by whom they hold their lives and
dignities, and whilst they fear to be esteemed for such as are bounden and
obliged to their Benefactors, they undergo a more grievous imputation, and are
justly called ungrateful.

CHAP. XXIIII.
SOme other there are that detract and scandalize their benefactors, and of
these there are some, whom it were better to offend currishly, than befriend
courteously. For showing themselves openly to be our mortal enemies, they
pretend th^r^by to make men think that they are obliged to us in nothing.
There is nothing that more carefully we ought to intend, than this, that the
memory of those who have in any sort succored us, be not at any time
extinguished in us, we must from time to time renew and refresh it. He cannot
give thanks, that forgets what he has received; and he that carries a
good turn in memory has already satisfied it: neither ought we to receive a
courtesy nicely, neither submisly or humbly: for if in receiving a man show
himself cold and negligent, (whereas the benefit that comes last, is the
most pleasing and acceptable) what will he do afterward when he shows
himself so cold in the greatest heat of that which he has received? Another
receives disdainfully, as if he said, I had no need, but since thou so far
pressest me, I will do what thou requirest. An other receives so carelessly
that he leaves his benefactour in suspense, whether he saw or felt what was
given him. An admonition against the vice of ingratitude.
An other scarce moves his lips, and proves more ungrateful than if he had
held his peace, That weight should our wondes have as the greatness of our
benefit requires, and boldly should we say; Thou have obliged me more than
thou think. For there is no man that is not contented to hear his courtesies
amplified, and made great by good reports: Thou ^anst not imagine how great the
pleasure is thou have done me, yet hope I to make it known unto thee, how much
more I prise thy good turn, than thou esteemest. He that burdeneth himself
with that which he has received, is instantly grateful as if he said thus. So
much esteem I the benefit which I have received at your hands, that I shall
never have the means to make you satisfaction, at leastwise I will publish
this in all companies, that if I requite it not before I die, it shall only be
for this cause that I want means to make requital.

CHAP. XXV.
This Furnius was surnamed Caius, and was Consul in Rome in the year 1226
FVRNIVS never won Augustus Caesar's heart more, or knew better by any means
to make him his own (whereby he might compass all that which he demanded at
his hands) than at that time, when (having obtained his fathers pardon, who had
been a party in Antonius action) he said unto him: Only this one injury
(Great CAESAR) have I received at thy hands, which is, that by thy means I
live, and by thy means I die, without grateful acknowledgement of that
thanks I owe thee. What mind may be more thankful than his, who in no sort
satisfies himself with his own thankfulness, but utterly despaireth to
equal the good he has received? By these and such like speeches let us so
endeavor, that our will be not restrained or hidden, but be apparent and
manifest every way. And although silence obscure our words, yet if we be so
affected as we ought to be, our interior thoughts will appear in our outward
countenance. He that will be thankful, no sooner receives the courtesy, but
conceiueth and bethinketh him how he may make requital. Chrisippus says, That
he that accepts any friendship, resembles him that is addressed and ready
to run for a wager, and stands in the List, expecting the signal,
whereupon he might speedily set forward. And truly, he that receives, had
need to be a swift footman and a great competitor, to the intent he may
overtake his benefactor, who began the race before him.

CHAP. XXVI.
Three principal causes of ingratitude, selfe-opinion, covetousness, and
envy.
LEt us now consider and examine what most of all makes men ungrateful. Truly
it is either an ouer-weening of our selves, and an ingrafted error in men to
admire and applaud both themselves and their actions, or else it is
covetousness or envy. Let us begin with the first. There is no man but is a
partial and favorable judge of himself: And thence it is, that he supposes
that he has deserved all things, and if any thing be given him, he receives
it as a debt or duty; and moreover, supposes himself to be disgraced, and
vnder-valued. He gave me this (says he) but how late? But with how much
travail and entreatie? How many more things might I have obtained in the mean
while, had I but fawned on such a man? or attended that? Or had I intended mine
own profit? I looked not for this, I am numbered amongst the baser sort:
Supposed he that my value and merit deserved so little? More honestly had he
dealt with me, had he presented me nothing at all.

CHAP. XXVII.

made him seem poor, and in the wayning (for this man saw four thousand
Sestertiae of his own; and fitly said I so, for he did no more than see them)
was as shallow in wit, as base in mind and courage: For although he were as
covetous as Covetousness it self, yet sooner vented he his money than his
words; so weak and wanting was he in uttering what he should. This man being
obliged to Augustus for all his advancement and fortunes (to whose service he
had brought nothing but distressed beggerie, under the title of Nobility)
having obtained the government in the City (both for the favor he had with
the Emperor, and the money held in his own possession) was wont oftentimes to
complain himself unto Caesar, That he had retired him from his studies, and
that he had not given him so much as he him self had lost by giving up his
study of eloquence. And yet amongst other graces, Augustus had done this for
him, that he had delivered him from other men's scorns, and his own
fruitelesse labor. This a^reeth with S. Gregory's saying and that of the Port,
Cre^cit amor nummi quantum ipsa p^cunia crescit.
But Covetousness consents not that a man should be thankful: For unbridled
hope is never satisfied with that which is given. The more we have, the more
we covet; and covetousness engaged amidst a heap and multitude of riches, is
more incensed and forward. Even as the force of a flame is a thousand times
more fiercer, the more violent and greater the fire is from whence it blazeth:
So ambition suffers not a man to rest upon the measure of that honor which
heretofore be would have been ashamed to have wished for. No man gives
thanks for being advanced to a Tribuneship, The endless desire of man is
never gl^tted nor satisfied.
but complains, that he is not preferred to the dignity of a Praetor:
Neither does this suffice him, but that he must needs be Consul: Neither will
the Consulate content him, except he possess it more than once. Ambition still
presses forward, and understands not her own felicity, because she
respects not whence she came, but whither she is addressed. Of all these
vices which hinder our gratuitie, the most importunate and vehement is Envy,
which tormenteth and vexes us with comparisons of this nature: He bestowed
thus much on me, but more upon him, and more speedily also. Finally, the
envious man negotiateth no man's business, but favors himself against all
men.

HOw much more wisely and virtuously were it done, Remedies against the errors
of those that receive unthankfully.
to engreaten and dignifie a good turn received, and to consider and know,
that no man is ever so well esteemed by another, as he esteems and prizeth
himself. I should have received far more; but it was not for his ^ase to
give me more: his liberality was to extend to more than my self. This is but
a beginning: Let us take it in good part, and urge on his to further favors, by
showing our selves thankful for the good we have received: He has done but a
little, but he will do it often: He has preferred that man before me, and me
also has he preferred before many others. This man cannot equal me either in
virtue or honesty, yet in his carriage and actions he has something more
pleasing than is in me. By complaining my self I shall never be held worthy
of a greater good, but shall rather show, that I am unworthy of that which I
have already received. There was more courtesy done to those lewd fellows:
What is this to the purpose? How seldom is Fortune bountiful with judgment?
We daily complain, that men that are least virtuous are most fortunate. Often
times the hayle and tempest that ouer-passed the lands of a wicked and ungodly
man, has beat down the corn of the best and vprightest men. Each man (as in
all other things, so in friendship) has his chance and fortune. There is no
benefit so fully good, that malignitie and envy cannot impugn and detract;
there is no courtesy so scanted and barren, but a good interpreter may enlarge
and amplify. Thou shall never want a subject or cause to complain of, if thou
behold benefits on the weaker and worser side.

CHAP. XXIX.
SEe, I pray you, how some men (yea, even those who make a profession of
wisdom) have unjustly censured, and vnindifferently esteemed the goods, and
those graces which they have bestowed upon us. They complain because we
equal not Elephants in bulk of body, These will be the better understood i^
we note that which Galen says, in the beginning of his Treatise de vsu
partium, where he says, That those creatures whom nature endowed with fore^s
to defend the^s^lu^s from the^^ Enemies, are not e^dowed with swiftness to
s^^e, as it appe^reth in the Elephant. And contrariwise to those she has
denied force^ to def^nd themselves, them has she preuided of swiftness to
she from their contrary, as for example the Heart and Hare.
Hearts in swiftness, Birds in lightness, Bulls in force. They complain that
beasts have substantialler hides than we, that fallow Dear have a fairer
hair, the Bear a thicker skin, the Beuer a softer. They complain that
Dogs overcome us in smelling, that Eagles in seeing, that Crows in
out-liuing, and many other beasts in facility of swimming. And whereas nature
permits not, that some properties should be united in one and the same
creature (as that swiftness of body should be matched with mightiness in
strength) they suppose themselves injured, because man was not composed of
these diverse and dissident goods; and blame the Gods for neglecting us, because
they have not given us perpetual health, invincible virtue, and exemption from
vices, and certain foreknowledge of things to come: yea and so far are
they plunged in impudency, that they scarcely temper themselves from hating
nature for making us inferior to the Gods, and not equal with them in their
Divinity. How much more better were it for us to return and reflect upon the
contemplation of so many and so mighty benefits which we have received at
their hands, and to yield them thanks, for that it has pleased them to alot
us a second place in this most beautiful house, and to make us Lords of all
earthly things? Is there any comparison betwixt us and those beasts, whereof
we have the sovereignty? All whatsoever nature denies us, she cannot
conveniently bestow upon us. And therefore whosoever thou art that do so
undervalue man's fortune and chance, bethink thee how great blessings our
sovereign parent has given us. How many beasts more forcible than our selves
have we yoked, and brought under our subjection? how far more swifter
creatures have we ouer-taken, and how no mortal thing is secured and exempted
from our strokes and power. So many virtues have we received, so many arts, and
in conclusion, such a mind and spirit, that in that very It is not intended
that the same thing which the soul desires should presently come to hand, but
that by the means, and se^bl^^e, which is s^d^^nly ^ormed in the soul, it may
e^^o^ and use the same in some manner.
instant wherein it intends a thing, in a moment it attaineth the same, and
more swifter than the stars fore-seeth long before the course and motion they
are to obs^rue and hold in time to come. Finally, such a plenty of fruit, such
store of wealth, and such abundance of things heaped one upon an other.
Although thou take a view of all things, and because thou find no one thing
entire which thou hadest rather be, pick out such several things as thou
would wish to be given thee out of them all. So when thou have well waighed
the loving kindness of nature, thou shall be forced to confess, that thou
were her darling: And so is it indeed. The immortal Gods have and do love us
entirely, and (which is the greatest honor that could be given) they have
placed us next unto themselves. Great things have we received, neither were we
capable of greater.

CHAP. XXX.
THese things (my Liberalis) have I thought necessary to be spoken, He
answers to a sec^et objection
both because it concerned me to say somewhat of great benefits when we were
discoursing on small; and also because the boldness of this horrible vice
flows from thence into all other things. For unto whom will he be thankful
for good turns; or what benefit will he esteem great and worthy the
requiting, who despises the highest benefits? To whom will he confess
himself indebted for his health and life, that denies that he has received
his being from the Gods, to whom he prays daily for the same? Whosoever
therefore gives instructions of thankfulness unto men, negotiateth the
affairs of men and Gods; to whom, being unpurveyed of nothing, and freed from
the desire of affecting or coveting any thing, yet to them may men
notwithstanding be both acknowledging and thankful. There is no cause why any
man should lay the blame of his thankelesse mind upon his own weakness or
poverty, and say, What shall I do? How or when may I find any possibility to
remunerate and acknowledge the benefits of my superiors, the Lords of all
things? To requite is an ^asie matter: for if thou be a niggard, thou may
requite without expense; and if thou be slothful, without labor. In that
very moment wherein thou art obliged, if thou listest, thou may make even
with any man whatsoever, because that he who willingly has received a benefit,
has restored the same.

CHAP. XXXI.
IN my opinion, that doctrine (which the Stoickes place amongst their
ext^aordinarie Paradoxes) is not so wonderful and incredible, He disputes
whether an interior thanksgiving is sufficient to satisfy a bene^^t received.
That he who willingly has received a benefit, has restored the same. For in
as much as we measure all things by the mind, look how much a man is minded to
do, so much has he done. And for as much as piety, faithfulness, and
uprightness, and finally all virtue, is perfect in it self, although a man
could not remunerate an act, yet may he be thankful even with his will and
heart. As often as any one compasses and obtains his purpose, so often he
reapeth the fruit of his labor. What purposes he that bestows a benefit? To
profi^ him to whom he gives the same, and to content and delight himself: If
he has finished that which he intended, and the good turn he intended me be
come to my hands, and both of us are mutually affected with joy and
contentment, he has obtained that which he sought: For his intent was not to
have any thing in recompense, for then had it been no benefit, but a bargain.
Well has he sailed that has attained the Haven whereunto he shaped his
course. The dart that hitteth the mark it was aimed at, has performed the
office of a steadie hand: He that does a good turn, means to have it
accepted thankfully^ if it be well taken, he has his desire. But he hoped for
some profit thereby: This was no benefit whose property is to think no ways
of remuneration. That which I received, if I accepted and entertained the same
with the like good affection as it was given me, I have requited it: otherwise
the thing that of it self is best, were in worst case. To the end I should be
thankful, I am sent to Fortune: if I cannot satisfy for want of her succor,
my good mind shall satisfy a good mind. What then? Shall I not endeavor my
self to the uttermost to make recompense? Shall I not seek opportunity of
time and matter, and labor to fill the bosom of him, at whose hands I have
received any thing? Yes. But yet the world went ill with good doing, if a man
might not be thankful, even with empty hands.

CHAP. XXXII.
That is Chrisippus.
HE that receives a good turn (says he) although he has taken it with never
so thankful a mind, yet has he not consummated and performed his duty: An
objection and similitude against the precedent Paradox of the Stoics.
for there is a part which remains, which is of restitution. As at a
Tennis-play it is somewhat to receive the ball cunningly and diligently; but he
is not termed a good gamest^r, except he be such a one as returns and
strikes back the same as fitly and readily, as it was served to him. This
example is far different and impertinent: And why? because the praise hereof
is in the motion and agilitie of the body, not in the mind. And therefore it
is requisite, that the whole should be laid forth at large, where the eye must
be judge. Yet will I not for all that deny him to be a good gamester that
receives the ball as he ought to do; though he strike it not again, so the
fault be not in himself. But although (says he) there be nothing deficient
in the art of him that plays, because he has performed a part, and can
likewise perform that part which he has not done, yet is the game it self
imperfect, which is consummated in taking and returning the ball back again
by turns. Here he resol^eth this q^estion by Ch^i^sippus one example.
I will no longer refell this; let us suppose it to be so; let somewhat be
deficient in the game, and not in the gamester: So in this also, whereof we
dispute, there wants somewhat in respect of the thing that was given, to
which some condign satisfaction is due, although in respect of the mind there
be nothing deficient. The bountiful mind that is seconded by a thanke^ull and
grate^ull mind, has for his own part all that which is to be desired by him.
He that has gotten a mind answerable to his own, has performed as much as
in him lies that which he would.

CHAP. XXXIII.
HE has given me a benefit, and I have accepted it no otherwise than he
himself would have it received: Now has he the thing that he sought, and the
only thing that he sought, I am grateful. After this there remains the use
of me, and some profit from a grateful man. This is not the remnant of an
imperfect duty, but an in-come and accession to a perfect one. Phidias makes
an Image: the fruit of his art and knowledge is one thing, the commodity of
his workmanship and labor another: The property of his art is to have made
the Statue, but of the workmanship to have made it with profit. Phidias has
perfited his work, although he has not sold it: A threefold profit reapeth
he by his work; the one in his conscience and conceit, and this he receives
as soon as his work is finished; the other of his fame; the third of his
profit, which shall accrue unto him either by favor, or by sale, or by some
other means. So the first fruit of a benefit is the conscience and contentment
a man conceiueth^ that he has well finished the same; the second is of
reputation; the third of those things which may be made reciprocal one unto
another. Grateful acceptance is a kind of satisfaction.
When as therefore a benefit is thankefully accepted, he that bestowed it,
has already received recompense, but not satisfaction as yet: I therefore owe
that which is without the benefit, and in receiving it kindly and thankfully, I
have satisfied the same.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
WHat then? (^aith he) has he requited a favor that has done nothing?
Confirmations of the precedent Paradox.
He has done much, he has repaied good will with as great good will, and
(which is a certain sign of friendship) he has done it with an equal
affection. Moreover, a debt is satisfied one way, and a benefit another. Thou
art not to expect that I will show thee my payment. This affair is managed
from will to will. That which I say unto thee shall not seem harsh and
distasteful to thee, although at first it fight against thine opinion, if thou
conform thy self unto me, and imagine that there are more things than words.
There are a great number of things without name, which we note not by their
proper titles, but such as are both foreign and borrowed: We call the foot
whereon we walk, a foot; the foot of a Bed, the foot of a Hanging, and the
foot of a Verse: We call by the name of Dog, both a Hound, a Fish, and a Star:
For we have not words enough to give a proper name unto every thing; and
therefore when we have need we borrow. Fortitude is a virtue that contemns
just dangers: or it is a Science to repel perils, or to know how to sustain
them, or how to provoke them: yet say we, that a Fencer is a stout man, and a
wicked slave, whom rashness has animated and enforced to contempt of death.
Parsimonie is a Science to avoid extraordinary expense, or an art to use a
man's estate and substance moderately^ and yet we call him a very sparing man,
which is of a niggardly and pinching mind, whereas notwithstanding there is
infinite odds between moderation and niggardize. These are of diverse natures,
and yet for want of words we are enforced to call both the one and the other a
Sparer; A benefit not only signi^yeth a bounteous action, but the thing
whatsoever that is bountifully bestowed.
and him likewise strong who despises casualties with reason, as that other
also, who runs headlong upon dangers without judgment. So a benefit, as we
have said, is a bounteous action, and that very thing which is given by that
action, as money, a house, a garment; the name of them both is all one, but the
virtue and power of them far different.

CHAP. XXXV.
Give care therefore, and thou shall presently perceive, that I say nothing
that is contrary to thy opinion. That benefit or good turn which is finished
in the doing of it, is requited, if we take it thankfully. But for that other
which is contained in the thing, we have not yet requited it, but we intend to
requite it: we have satisfied good will with good will, and we owe still a
thing for a thing. Therefore, although we say, that he has given thanks that
has willingly received a benefit, yet will we him that has received to
restore some such like thing as he has received. Some of the things we speak
do differ from common custom, and afterward another way they grow in use and
custom again. We deny, that a wise man receives any wrong, and yet the man
that strikes him with his fist, shall be condemned of injury and wrong doing.
We deny, that a fool has any goods of his own, and yet if a man steal any
thing from a fool, we will condemn him of felony. A Stoicall opinion.
We say that all fools be mad, and yet we cure them not all by Eleborus. Even
unto those very men whom we term mad we commit both Suffrages and
Jurisdiction. So likewise say we that he has requited a good turn that has
received it with a good mind; but yet nevertheless we leave him still in
debt, to make recompense even when he has requited. Our so saying is an
exhortation, and not a remitting of the good turn. Let us not fear, neither
(being depressed with an intolerable burden) let us faint in mind. Goods are
given me; my good name is defended, my misery is taken from me, I enjoy life
and liberty, deerer than life: And how shall I requite these things? When will
the day come that I may show him my good will again? This is the day wherein
he has showed his. Take up the good turn, embrace it and be glad, make
account that thou owe not that which thou have received, but that which thou
may requite. Thou shall not adventure on so great a thing, as that mischance
may make thee unthankful. I will propose no difficulty unto thee: be of good
courage, shrink not for fear of pains and long servitude: I delay thee not,
it may be done with things that thou have already. Thou shall never be
thankful except thou be instantly: What will thou therefore do? Must thou
take arms? Perchance thou must: Must thou sail over seas? Likely yes: and
even then also when the storms threaten thee with shipwreck. But will thou
restore a benefit? Take it thankefully, and thou have requited it; not so as
thou should think that thou have paid the same, but so as thou may owe
it with the more hearts-^ase.

LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE THIRD BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
HE discourses of ungrateful men, what they be, and whether they are to be
punished, or called before the Judge. He denies it by a curious disputation,
and adds, that their punishment is in hatred, infamy and in the mind it
self. Afterward upon occasion he debateth whether a Lord should be grateful
to his slave? Or receive a benefit at his hands? He affirms; and this very
plentifully, because in those days there was often use of servants. Hereunto
he annexeth; whether the Son gives his Father a benefit? He disputes on
both sides, but affirms the affirmative.

CHAP. I.
NOT to render thanks for benefits received (my AEbutius Liberalis) is both
loathsome in it self, and hateful in all men's opinion. That which is
complained of by all men, is exercised by most me^.
And therefore such as are themselves ungrateful, complain of ungrateful
men: and so are we fashioned and addressed to the contrary of that we ought to
do, that there are some who become our Capital enemies, not only after
benefits received, but for the very favors they receive. I cannot deny but
that this happens unto some by reason of the corruption of their nature: to
many, because that the interposition of time extinguisheth the remembrance. For
those things that were fresh in memory with them, while they were newly done,
do in process of time wear out of remembrance. Concerning which so^t of men,
I know that thou and I have otherwhiles disputed, He terms all sin equal,
according to the doctrine of the Stoickes, but all the Fathers and Christian
religion teaches otherwise.
whereas thou maintainedst that it were better to call them forgetful than
ungrateful. Shall he therefore be excused of ingratitude because he has
forgotten, when as no man can forget, except he be ungrateful? There are many
sorts of ungrateful men, as there are of Theefes and Murderers, whose fault
is one, but in the parts there is great variety. Ungrateful is he who denies
that he has received a good turn, which has been done him: Ungrateful is
he that dissembleth: Ungrateful is he that makes not restitution: and the
most ungrateful of all is he, that forgets a favor has been shown him.
For they, although they requite not, yet are they indebted, and some certain
impression of the good turn (hoarded up in their corrupt consciences) is
extant with them. And upon some cause they may at length dispose themselves to
gratuitie, if either shame shall put them in mind, or some sudden desire to
proceed honorably: such as for a time is wont to awaken it self in men of
the worst disposition, if any easy occasion should inuit them. But never can
he become thankful who has forgotten the whole benefit. And whether
think thou him worser, in whom the thanks of a good turn is lost, or him
in whom the very remembrance perishes? Faulty are those eyes that fear the
light, but blind are they that see not at all. Not to reverence and love ones
Parents is impiety, and not to acknowledge them is madness. Who is more
ungrateful than he, who having received such a courtesy as he ought to
treasure up in the foremost part of his memory, and continually meditate
thereon, has laid it so far a-side, and neglected it, that he grows wholly
ignorant thereof? It appears that he never bethought him of restitution, that
suffered oblivion so far to usurp upon him.

CHAP. II.
IN a word, to the requiting of a good turn there needs virtue, time,
ability, and favorable fortune. He that remembers a friend is thankful
without expense: He that performs not this (which to atchieue neither
requires labor, nor charge, nor felicity) has no covert or patronage to
conceal himself in. For never meant he to be thankful, who cast a benefit
so far from him, that it neither suruiued in his sight, An apt comparison.
nor his remembrance. Even as those things which are in use, and are managed
and handled daily, are never in danger of soil or rusting; and those which are
out of sight, and use (so as they have lien by, as unnecessary) do gather
soil by continuance of time: So that which frequent cogitation exercises and
renews, is never wrought out of memory, which loses and forgets
nothing, but that, which she respects and looks not back unto very often.

CHAP. III.
BEsides this cause there are other also, which sometimes conceal the greatest
merits from us. Besides forgetfulness, he sets down other causes of
ingratitude.
The first and chiefest cause of all others, is this; that being always
continually busied with new desires, we have an eye and regard, not to that we
have, but what we require, intentive, not on that which is in our present
possession, but on that we affect and fancy most. For whatsoever is at our
command, is base and contemptible. Whence it follows, that as soon as the
desire of new things has made that light which we have received, the Author
also thereof is slenderly respected. So long as those things which a great
Lord has given us, have been pleasing and well-liking unto us, we have loved
and courted him, and confessed openly that our state was founded and raised by
him; but if any new ambition assault us; if our mind fall into admiration of
other things, and earnestly aff^ct the same, (as the manner of mortal men is,
after great things to desire greater) we straight ways forget that which in
times past we called a benefit^ we neithe^ respect or look into those things,
which have advanced us before others^ but those things only wherein other men
have had the fortune to outstrip us. But it is impossible for any man, both to
repine and envy, and to be thankful: for to envy, is the property of a
complaining and discontented man, but to give thanks is the property of him
that is well pleased. The second cause of ingratitude is, because none of us
make any account, but of that present time which speedily passes and fleeteth
before our eyes; and few or none are they that cast back their minds to think
on things past. By means hereof it falls out, that Schoolmasters, and their
good deeds, are buried in oblivion, because we wholly loose the remembrance of
our infancy. Hereby it comes to pass, that we forget all those things
which are bestowed upon us in our youth because we never think upon the same.
No man accompteth that which he has been, as it were a thing past, but as a
thing lost. Thus the desire and apprehension of things to come, defaceth the
memory of things past.

CHAP. IIII.
IN this place must I give testimony of the Epicures upright judgment, The
remembrance of kindn^sse received, ought to be numbered amongst the greatest
pleasures.
who continually complains, for that we are ungrateful in regard of things
past, for that we recall not to memo^ie whatsoever benefits we have received,
neither number them amongst pleasures, when as there is none more certain
contentment, than that which cannot any more be taken from us. The goods and
pleasures that are present are not as yet wholly assured; some casualtie may
intercept and cut them off. Those things that are to come, are uncertain and
doubtful: That which is past is laid a-side amongst those things that are in
safety. How then can any man acknowledge the good that is done him, who has
forgotten the whole course of his life? The apprehension and consideration of
things present, and the memory of things past, makes a man grateful; He
that attributes most to Hope, yields least to Memory.

CHAP. V.
EVen as (my Liberalis) there are certain things which being once
apprehended, continue still in memory; and some things that to know them, it
is not sufficient to have learned them, (for the science of them is forgotten,
except it be continued) I mean Geometry, and the course of Celestial
things, and of such which by their subtlety do easily flip out of our
memories: So the greatness of some benefits suffer them not to be forgotten.
Some lesser and more in number, and diverse in time, are easily buried in
oblivion; Beca^se, as I said, we handle them not often, neither willingly
acknowledge what we owe unto e^erie man. Hearken what speeches suitors and
suppliants use. There is not any of them, but says, that h^e will for ever
keep in mind the favor done him; every man protests and voweth himself to
be at commandment, and if any more submissiue speech, whereby he may engage
himself, may be found out, he spares it not. But within a little while after,
those Gallants esteem their former words as too base and illiberall: and
finally, they grow to that point (which as I suppose every one the lewdest, and
most vngratefullest attaineth unto) that is, to forget the same. For even as
ungrateful is he that forgets, as he is grateful that remembers him of a
benefit.

CHAP. VI.
YEt the question is whether this so hateful vice should be left unpunished?
and whether this law which is exercised in declamatorie Schools, should be
ratified also in the City, whereby a man may call an ungrateful man in
question? Sure it seems a matter worthy the censure of justice, in all men's
judgments. Why not? since certain Cities also, have reproched other Cities
for the loanes and favors they have done them, and redemand from posterity
that which they have lent to their predecessors. Our Ancestors, those mighty
and virtuous men, required satisfaction only from their enemies; as for their
benefits, He concludes the negative p^rt.

He approves that which he concluded.


they gave them with a great mind, and lost them with as great. There is not
any Nation in the world, except the Medes, that have thought fit to impleade an
ungrateful man, or call him in question. And this is a great reason why none
should be granted, because by mutual consent we punish misdeeds; and for
Murder, Witchcraft, Paricide, and breach of Religion, have here and there
enacted diverse punishments, and in all places some: but this most frequent
crime is no where punished, and every where improued. Neither absolve we the
same: but whereas the judgment of a thing uncertain is difficult, we have
only condemned it with hatred, and left it amongst those things which we
refer to the justice and judgment of the Gods.

CHAP. VII.
Reasons to approve that ingratitude is not punishable by Law.
But many reasons offer themselves unto me, whereby it appears that this
error and crime is not punishable by Law. First of all, the better part of the
benefit should perish, if a man should have an action allowed him, as he has
for lending money, or for bargains of hyring, and letting out. For this is the
greatest grace of a benefit, that we have given it, although we should loose
it, that we have referred all to the courtesy of the receivers. If I arrest
him, and call him before the Judge, it begins to be a debt, and not a
benefit. Again, whereas it is a most commendable thing to requite, it cease
to be honest, if it be of necessity. For no man will commend a thankful
person, more than him that has restored a thing which was committed him to
keep, or discharged his debt without being sued. Thus corrupt and deface we
two things (than which in humane life there is nothing more worthy) that is
to say, a grateful man, and a bountiful giver. For what honor, I pray you,
shall he have in this, if he gives not a benefit, but lends it? or in
that, if he requite, not because he will, but because he must of necessity?
It is no glorious thing to be grateful, except it be a matter unpunishable to
be ungrateful: moreover, this inconvenience would ensue, that all Courts would
scarcely serve, and suffice this one law only: who is he that might not sue?
who is he that might not be sued? all men prise and praise their own doings,
all men enlarge those things they have employed upon others, be they never so
little. Besides, whatsoever things fall into knowledge of the Judges, may be
comprehended by the^ without giving them infinite license and liberty. And
therefore the condition of a good cause seems to be better if it be restored
to a Judge, than if it be remitted to compromise, because the Judge is bound
unto an order, and has his certain bounds limited him, which he may not
exceed; But the Vmpieres conscience being free and tied to no terms, may both
add, and take away, and order the sentence, not as law and justice
counsaileth, but according as humanity and pity shall move. An action of
ingratitude would not oblige the Judge, but set him at liberty to rule things
as he listed. For it is not certain what a benefit is; again, how great
soever it be, it were much to the matter how favorably the Judge would
construe it. No law defines what an unthankful person is. Oft-times he that
has restored as much as he has received, is unthankful, and he that has
not requited, is thankful. There be some matters also which some unskillful
Judge may dismiss the Court of, as in cases where the parties confess a
deed, The Roman Pra^or was wont to commit, some affairs of importance to
be determined to a certain number of chosen men, selected out of the order of
Knights.
or no deed, where the opening of the evidence dispatcheth all doubts. But
when as Reason must give judgment between two persons which debate, there
ought our understanding to use conjecture and divination: and when as a thing
which only wisdom ought to determine, falls in controversy, a man cannot
(in that case) take a Judge of the number of those whom the Praetor chooses,
and such a one as is enrolled in the Register of the Judges; because he has
the rents and riches which a Roman Knight ought to have.

CHAP. VIII.
THis thing therefore seemed not to be very unmeet to be made a matter in
law, but that no man could be found to be a competent Judge in the case; which
thou will not wonder at, if thou consider thoroughly what puzzell and
difficulty he should find who should enter into the ouer-ruling of such
cases. Some one has given a great sum of mon^y^ but such a one as is rich;
but such a one as shall not feel the want thereof. An other has given, but
with the hazard of forgoing his whole inheritance. The sums are a-like, but
the benefit is not the same: Yea, let us add yet further; This man laid down
money for him that was adjudged a slave unto his creditour; but where he had
it at home lying by him. That other gave as much; but ^ee took it up upon
interest; or borrowed it with much entreaty; or deeply endangered himself to
^inith^^ lent it. Think thou that there was no difference betwixt him that
bestowed his benefit at his case, and that other that borrowed to give the
same? Some things are made great in time, and not the greatest. It is a
benefit to give ^ possession whose fertility may ease the dearth of corn; one
loaf of bread in time of scarcity is a benefit. It is a benefit to give whole
Regions, through which many Rivers may run able to bear ships. It is a
benefit to those that are dried up with thirst, and scarce able to draw them
breath through their dried jaws to show them a fountain: who shall
distinguish these one from an other? who shall weigh them thoroughly? hard is
the determination of that case, which requires the force of a thing, and not
the thing it self. Although they be the same, yet being differently given,
they weigh not alike. This man did me a good turn, but he did it unwillingly;
but he complained that he gave it, but he beheld me more proudly than he was
accustomed, but he gave it so late, that it had been better for me if he had
quickly denied me. How can a Judge make an estimate of these things? whereas
the speech, the doubt, and the countenance of a man may destroy the grace of
his merit?

CHAP. IX.
WHat shall we say of some things, which because they are much desired, are
held for benefits? and of others, which are not esteemed by the common sort,
for such, although they are greater then they seem. Thou call it a benefit
to have given a man the freedom of a most rich and wealthy City, to have made
a man a Knight, and to have placed him on the These degrees or places of
Knighthood amongst the Romans were not obtained by antiquity, but diligence
and favor: so may you gather from our Auth^r here, and from Iustus Lipsius,
lib. de Amphitheatro cap. 14.
fourteenth scaffold, destinated for the Roman Knights, to behold the plays
and public spectacles? and to have defended him upon an indictment of life
and death: but what think you of it to have given a man good counsel? to
have hindered him from executing a wicked enterprise? to have wrung the sword
out of his hand, wherewith he would have slain himself? to have comforted
him in his sorrow by wholesome counsels? and to have brought him back to the
fellowship of life, from his wilful seeking and longing to accompany his
deceased friends in death: what think you it to be, to sit by a sick-mans bed,
and since his evil came by fits and at certain hours, to have waighted a fit
time to give him meat? and to have bathed his veins with wine when he
fainted? to have brought him a Physician even then when he exspected to die?
who is he that can justly value these things? what Judge shall he be that
shall command these benefits to be recompensed with the like? Some man
perchance has given thee a house, but I have foretold thee that thine own is
falling down on thy head. He has given thee a patrimony: but I a planck to
floate upon, and save thy life in shipwreck. He has fought and has been
wounded for thy cause: but I have given thee thy life by my silence on the
rack. Whereas a benefit is given one way, and recompensed an other: it is a
hard matter to make them equal.

CHAP. X.
FVrthermore, there is no day limited for recompencing a good turn, as there
is for money lent: he therefore that has not as yet requited, may requite. For
tell me in what time may a man discover an other to be ungrateful? The
greatest benefits have no probation at all, they for the most part are hidden
in the consciences of two. Shall we bring the world to that pass that we may
not do a good turn without testimony? What punishment then shall we
destinate for the unthankful? shall we prefixe one for all, where the
benefits are different? or unequal punishments, either greater or lesser,
according to each man's benefit? Go to then; let the penalty be pecuniarie:
why? Some benefits concern life and are more greater, than life; what penalty
will you pronounce against them? less than the benefit? that were not
indifferent: equal, and so capital? what more inhumane, than that the issue
of benefits should be bloody?

CHAP. XI.
Certain privileges (says he) are given unto Parents. And as there is an
extraordinary consideration had of these, so is it reasonable also that a
respect should be had of other benefits. We have hallowed and sacred the
condition of Parents, because it was expedient that children should be bred and
brought up. They were to be encouraged to this travel, because they were to
under go an uncertain fortune. It could not be said unto them, which is
spoken unto those that give benefits. Be wary in thy choice to whom thou
give: If thou have been once deceived, seek out hence-forward such a one as
is worthy of thy benefits, and succor him. In breeding and bringing up
children, the Parents judgment prevails little, all that they may do is but
to wish well, and hope the best. Therefore that they might the more willingly
adventure this chance, it was reason that some prerogative should be given
them. Again, the case stands otherwise with Parents, for they both do and
will bestow benefits upon their children, although they have done never so much
for them already: and it is not to be feared that they will belie themselves
in giving: In others it ought to be examined, not only whether they have
received, but also whether they have given. But the merits of these consist in
their confession; and because it is requisite for youth to be ruled, we have
constituted, as it were, certain domestical Magistrates over them, under
whose government they should be restrained. Again, the benefits of all
Parents was equal and alike, and therefore it might be valued after one rate,
but the rest were diverse, unlike, and infinite odds was between them, and
therefore could they fall under no compass of Law; so that it was more fitting
to let them all alone, than to make them all equal.

CHAP. XII.
SOme things cost the giuers much; As the qualities of benefits are diverse: so
also are they diversely esteemed by those that receive them.
and some are much worth to the receivers, and yet stand the giuers in nothing.
Certain courtesies are done to friends, some to strangers, and (although the
gift be one) yet is it better employed on him that then thou beganst to know,
when thou vndertookest to succor him. This man gives succors; that ornament;
these other consolations. Thou shall find some that imagine nothing more
pleasing in this world, or more great and agreeable, than to have a friend that
may succor, and to whom he may discover his miseries and calamities. Again,
you shall find some man more jelous of his Honor, than his Security, and
other some that suppose themselves more indebted to him, by whose means they
may live in repose, than to him by whose means they might live in some honor
and estimation. These things therefore would fall out greater or lesser,
according as the Judges mind were bent to the one or to the other. Besides I
choose my self a creditor: I oftentimes receive a benefit at his hands, from
whom I would not; and sometimes I am obliged ere I know thereof. What will thou
do? will thou call him ungrateful that had a good turn cast upon him before
he knew it, and if he had known thereof would not have received it? and will thou not term him unthankful which howsoever he received thy good turn, in
no sort requited it?

CHAP. XIII.
SOme man has done me a friendship, and afterward the same man has offered
me an injury. Whether am I tied by one courtesy to suffer all injuries? or
shall I be acquit, as if I had acknowledged the same, because he has defaced
his former benefit by his succeeding injury? how then can thou determine
whether the pleasure he has received be greater, or the outrage that is
afterward offered him? The day would fail me if I should attempt to prosecute
every difficulty. We (says he) make men slower to do good, If ungrateful
receivers should be punished, few would entertain benefits.
when we challenge not the things that are given, but suffer the deniers to
escape unpunished. But you must bethink your self of this also on the
contrary part, that men will be much loather to receive benefits, if they
should stand in peril of process thereby, and if their innocence be no ways
assured. Moreover, by this means we our selves shall become loather to do men
good, for no man willingly gives unto those, who are unwilling to receive. But
whosoever is provoked to pleasure others of his own good nature, and for the
worthiness of the thing it self, will give willingly also even unto such as
shall think themselves no more beholding to him than they list: For the glory
of that office is diminished, which carries a promise with it.

CHAP. XIIII.
SO shall there be fewer benefits; yea but they shall be truer. And what harm
is it to have the rashness of benefiting restrained? For this even intended
they that constituted no law for the same: that we should more circumspectly
give, and carefully choose those on whom we bestowed our favors. Consider
diligently to whom thou give, so shall there be no suing, so shall there be
no calling back or repetition. Thou art deceived if thou think that any Judge
can help thee. There is no Law that is able to set thee clear again. Only
have thou an eye to the thankfulness of the receiver. By these means
benefits hold their authority, and are magnificent: thou defilest them if thou
make them a matter of law: In debt it is a most justifiable speech, and
answerable to the law of all Na^^^ns, to say, Pay that which thou owe. But
this is the foulest word in benefiting ^^at can be, to say, Pay: For what shall
he pay? He owes his Life, his Greatness, his Honors, the assurance of his
Fortune, his Health. The greatest things cannot be requited. At leastwise
(says he) let him repay somewhat of like value. This is it that I said, that
the estimation of so noble a thing should perish, if we make a merchandise of
benefits. The mind is not to be incited to Avarice, to Process, or Debate: he
runs into these things of his own accord. Let us withstand them as much as
we can, and cut off the occasions of complaining.

CHAP. XV.
I Would to God we could persuade them not to receive again the money they had
lent, save only of such as were willing to repay. Would to God the buyers were
never obliged to the sellers by any promise^ nor bargains and covenants were
ratified under hand and seal; but that faith should rather keep them, and a
mind observing equity. He repre^endeth the little faith and double dealing of
men.
But men have preffered profit before honesty, and had rather enforce others
to be faithful, than behold them faithful. Witnesses are employed, both on
the one and the other side. This man lends his money upon interest to many,
whom he causes to be bound by public instruments. That other is not
contented with sureties, except he have a pawn in hand. O loathsome confession
of humane fraud, and public wickedness. Our seals are more set by than our
souls. To what purpose are these Worshipful men called to record? why set
they to their hands? namely, least he should deny that which he had
received. Think thou these men to be upright, and that they would maintain
a truth? yea, but if they themselves would instantly borrow money of any man,
they cannot get it, except they be obliged after the same manner. Had it not
been more honesty to let some pass with the breach of their credit, than
that all men should be mistrusted of unthankfulness, and perfidiousnesse.
Avarice wants but one only thing, which is, That we should do no man good
without suretiship. It is the property of a generous and magnificent mind to
help and pro^it others; he that gives benefits, imitateth the Gods; he that
redemandeth them, is as the Usurers. Why then abase we our selves to those
vilest sort of ^ake-hells, by resembling them?

CHAP. XVI.
But if no action be liable against an ungrateful person, the number of the
ungrateful will be the more? nay rather they will be the less; for men will
be more advised in bestowing their benefits. Again, it is not expedient to
have it known to the world, what a number of unthankful persons there be:
For the multitude of offenders will take away the shame of the deed, and a
common crime will cease to be accounted a reproach: The multitude of offenders
cloudeth and makes the crime less odious.
Is there almost any woman in these days that is ashamed of divorce, since the
time that certain of the noble Ladies, and Gentle-women, have made account of
their years, not by the number of Consuls, but by the number of their
husbands; and depart from them to be married, and are married to be divorced?
So long as divorce was rare, so long was it feared, but after that few or no
marriages were continued without divorce, the often hearing of it taught them
to use it. Is any woman now a-daies ashamed of whordome, since the world is
grown to that pass, that few take a husband but to cloak their whoredoms?
Chastity is an argument of de^ormitie, where shall a man find a woman so
miserable, or so loathsome, that will content her self with one pair of
adulterers? I pray God these Pagan errors together with divorce be not crept
into England.
except she have for eu^ry hour one, and yet the day is not long enough to
suffice all, except she be carried to one friend, and dine with an other, nay
she doteth, and is too much of the old stamp, that knows not that the
keeping of one Lemman is good wedlock. Like as the shame of these faults is
vanished at this day, since the sin began to get large scope, so shall thou
make the thankelesse sort both more and more bold, if they may once begin to
number themselves.

CHAP. XVII.
WHat then? shall the thankelesse person escape unpunished? what then? shall he
be vnchasticed that has no piety? the malicious, the covetous, he that
follows and feeds his own desires, he that delights in cruc^f^e?
Think thou that they shall be unpunished which are so hateful? or supposest
thou that any punishment is more gri^uous than public hatred? The punishment
of ingratitude is contempt of all men.
It is a punishment that he dare not take a good turn at any man's hands, that
he dare not do a good turn to any, that he is a gazing-stock to all men, or
at leastwise supposes himself to be so, and that he has lost the
understanding of the thing that was singularly good, and singularly sweet.
Call thou him unhappy that wants his eyesight? or him whose cares are
deafned by the means of sickness? and do thou not account him wretched,
The misery of an ungrateful receiver.
that has lost the force of benefits? He fears the Gods, who are witnesses
against all ungrateful men, the knowledge he has how he is entercepted and
excluded from benefiting, or doing courtesies, burns and vexes him inwardly:
finally, this very punishment is great enough for him, that (as I said before)
he cannot reap the fruit and enjoy so pleasant a thing. But he that is
delighted, and contented in that he has receiu^d a good turn, enjoys equal
and perpetual pleasure, and rejoices in beholding the mind of him that gave,
and not the thing was given. A good turn continually delights a thankful
man, an ungrateful man but once. Besides this, let either of their lives be
compared with other. The one is always sad and sorrowful, and walks like a
cheater, and fraudulent person, who respects not the duty he owes to his
Parents which begot him, nor of those friends that bred him up, nor of those
Masters which instructed him. The other is always joyful and merry,
expecting an occasion to yield satisfaction, and conceiving a great joy in this
very affection, not seeking means to make that appear less which he has
received, but how he may satisfy more fully and honorably, not only his
Parents and Friends, but also other persons of meaner reckoning. For although
he has received a benefit at his bond-mans hands, he considers not from
whom, but what he has received.

CHAP. XVIII.
ALthough it be a question amongst some (amongst whom Hecaton is one) whether a
bondman can benefit his Master or no. For there are some that distinguish
after this manner. That certain things are benefits; certain, duties, and
certain, services. They say that we ought to call that a benefit which we
receive from a strang^r, and we term him a stranger that is not borne to do
us any pleasure, except he please: They name that, duty, which appertains
properly to a Son, a Wife, and those persons who are provoked by alliance,
and tied by offices, He reproves this opinion and proves the contrary.
to assist. They term that, service, which belongs to a slave or bondman,
who is brought to this exigent by the condition of his fortune, so that he
cannot in any sort challenge his Superior for any thing, whatsoever he has
done unto him. This notwithstanding whosoever denies, that bondmen may not
sometimes do their Masters a good turn, is ignorant of the Law of Nature, for
it concerns us to consider, of what mind he is that gives the benefit, not
of what state or calling. Virtue hides her self from no man, she
entertaineth and accepts all men, she inuiteth all^ Gentlemen, Francklins,
Bondmen, Kings, and banished Men; she chooses neither house nor revenue, but
is contented with the bare name. For what safeguard should there be against
casualties, or what great thing could the mind promise it self, if fortune
could change a certain and settled virtue? if the bondman gives not a benefit
to his Master, neither does any Subject to his King, nor Soldier to his
Captain, for what skilleth it, in what state of subjection a man be, if he be
under one which is Sovereign? For if necessity, and fear of extremity do
bar a bondman from attaining the name of desert, the same also will bar
him that is under a King, or a Captain, who have the like power over him,
although it be under a different Title: but men gratify their Kings, and give
benefits to their Captains, therefore slaves may do courtesies to their
Masters: A bondman may be just, valiant, and courageous; Ergo, he may also
give a benefit. For this proceeds only from virtue, and so may bondmen give
their Masters benefits, as they have often times made them their benefits.
There is no doubt but that a bondman may do a courtesy to any man, why then
may he not give favor and pleasure to his own Master?

CHAP. XIX.
BEcause (says he) he cannot become his Masters creditor, Objections against
the above said reasons.
if he should give him his money; yet otherwise he daily obliges his Master
unto him: he follows him in his iournies, he ministers unto him in his
sicknesses, he reuerenceth him with great care, and labor: yet all these
(which would be thought benefits if an other should do them) are but services
as long as a bondman does them: All good offices in a slave are but duties
and no benefits.
For that is a benefit (and is only rightly so called) that a man does, who
was at liberty not to do it. But a bondman has not the power of refusal,
thus gives he, and lends he nothing, but is only obedient to that which is
commanded him: neither can he boast of his doing, because he could not refu^e
to do the same. Even under these terms will I conquer thee, and confute thy
opinion, and so far will I plead the bond-mans cause, that in diverse acts he
shall be esteemed free. Mean while, I pray you tell me, if I show you a slave
fighting courageously without fear of death, in defense of his Masters life,
and without respect of his own, wounded with infinite blows, yet suffering
his blood to stream from his deep wounds, even to the last and uttermost
drops, to the end that his Master in the mean time may find an opportunity
to escape, purchasing the means by his own death, to win so much time as he
may, to save his Masters life: Would thou deny that he did his Master a
friendship, because he is his bondman? If I show thee one, that by no
tyrannical premises could be corrupted, or threats terrified, or torments
feared, to bewray his Masters secrets; but as much as in him lay, removed all
suspicions that were surmised, and employed all his forces to express his
faith: would thou deny (because he was a bondman) that he did his Master a
good turn? See rather, if it be not so much the greater kindness, as the
example of virtue is rather in bondmen; and consequently, so much the more
worthy thanks: for that whereas superiority is commonly hated, and all
constraint esteemed grievous, yet the love of some one toward his Master, has
surmounted the common hatred of bondage. So then, for that cause it cease not
to be a benefit because it proceeded from a bondman: but therefore is it
greater, because bondage it self could not deter him from doing the same.

CHAP. XX.
He is deceived, whosoever thinks that servitude takes possession over the
whole man: the better part of him is exempted. The bodies are bred and subject
to their Masters, but the mind is privileged in it self: it is so free and
restless, that it cannot be restrained in this prison, wherein it is enclosed:
it cannot be held from using his forces, and performing great matters, and
passing beyond all bounds, as companion of the celestial Gods. It is the body
therefore that Fortune has submitted to the Master, This bought he, this
sells he: that interior part cannot be bought or sold, or suffer servitude.
Whatsoever issues from that is free: for neither can we command them all
things, neither can our bondmen be compelled to obey us in all things: they
are not bound to execute that which shall be prejudicial for the common weal:
they are not tied to assist any wicked and insolent action.

CHAP. XXI.
He yields a direct answer to the former reply.
THere are certain things which the laws neither command, nor forbid to be
done: in these has a bondman matter of benefit. As long as he does that
which his Master may justly command him to do, it is called and is service;
when more then is necessary for a servant to do, a benefit: when it passes
into the affection of a friend, it cease to be called a service. There are
certain things which a Master is bound to furnish his servant with, namely,
with meat, and drink, and raiment: but no man will call this a benefit. But
if he have given him all that he would, if he have nourished him as a freeman,
if he have instructed him in the liberal sciences: this ought to be called a
benefit. The same contrariwise may be said in the person of a bondman:
whatsoever it be that exceeds the duty and rule of a bond-mans service, it is
not done of awe and command, but voluntarily and willingly, is a benefit,
provided always, that it be such, that it may merit the name, when another
foreign person shall do it.

CHAP. XXII.
A Bondsman (as Chrysippus says) is a perpetual hireling, now even as he
gives a benefit, when he performs more then that days work to which he was
hired; so when as the bondman (by reason of the love and affection he bears
his Master) surpasses the terms of his miserable fortune, and performs some
extraordinary and brave enterprise, which might be held honorable in one more
happily borne, and surmounteth the hope and expectation of his Master, then is
it a benefit, which is found in his own house. Seems it a matter just and
indifferent to thee, that if we be displeased with those that do less then
their duty, we should not be thankful unto them, that perform more then
either they should or are accustomed? will thou know when it is no benefit?
then it is, when it may be said, what if he would not do it? But when he
performs that which he might lawfully refuse, it is praise-worthie in him
that he had a will to do it. A benefit and an injury are contraries. The
slave may pleasure his Master, i^ he may receive an injury at his hands: And
yet there is an express Judge appointed to hear the complaint of bondmen
against their Masters, who may contrary and repress their cruelty, lust, and
hard dealing^ and chastise the covetousness of those Lords, who refuse to
allow their slaves ordinary food, and necessary garments. What then? does the
Master receive a benefit at his bondmans hands? ye, a man, from a man: To
conclude, he has done that which was in his power, he has given his Master a
benefit; it is in thy choice whether thou will receive it from a bondman. But
who is so great whom fortune may not compel to stand in need even of the
basest and poorest of his people? Now will I relate many and different examples
of benefits, and some also contrary to one another. Some one slave has saved
his Masters life, another also gave him his death. An other has delivered his
Master at the instant when he should die, and (if this be but a small matter)
by loosing his own life has saved his Masters. There have been some that
have helped their deaths, and others that have preserved them by beguiling them.

CHAP. XXIII.
CLAUDIUS QVADRIGARIVS in the eighteenth Book of his Chronickes reports,
that when the City Grumentum was beleagred, and brought into a desperate
estate and extreme misery: that two slaves fled unto the Enemies camp, and
performed an action worthy their labor and peril: For after the City was
taken, and the victorious enemy ranged and reuelled every where, these two
slaves (who knew all the by-waies) were the first that set forward to make
booty of that house wherein they had served. And having surprised their
Mistress, they rudely drove her before them: And being demanded what woman she
was: they answered that it was their Mistress, who had in times past most
cruelly handled them, and that they dragged her out, to bring her to her death:
and by this policy having gotten her out of the City, they carefully hid
her: But afterward when the Roman Soldiers were satisfied with pillage, and
reduced to their former discipline and manners, these slaves likewise returned
to their former servitude, and gave their Mistress her wonted liberty. In
acknowledgement whereof she presently set them both at liberty, and was not
ashamed to receive her life at their hands, over whom she had absolute power
both of life and death: Could she have more cause of contentment than hereby?
for had she been otherwise preserved, she had but received an ordinary
courtesy and vulgar clemency, (which is many times usual amongst Soldiers)
but being preserved after this manner, it was a noble Story, and an
everlasting example, to both the Cities. In so great confusion of the surprised
City, when every one minded his particular safety, all fled from her, except
her own fugitives. And they to express with what mind and intention they
practiced their former flight; fled from the Conquerors, to the Captive;
pretending the countenance of Murderers, which was the greatest point in that
benefit. So much thought they it better to seem Murderers of their Mistress,
lest than that she should have been murdered indeed: It is not believe me,
it is not I tell you, the act of a servile mind, to buy a noble action by the
fame and opinion they gain of their wickedness: Caius Vettius the Praetor of
the Marses, See Lipsius notes, why this Transla^ion is used contrary to the
original.
was led unto his death; his bondman drew the sword of that very Soldier that
dragged him, and first of all slew his Master, and afterward (it is time,
says he, to enfranchise and deliver my self, since now already I have set my
Master at liberty) at one stroke thrust himself through. Show me any man that
has preserved his Master more magnificently.

CHAP. XXIIII.
CAESAR besieged The Romans now call it, Camp del Santo Pelino.
Corfinium, and Domitius was shut up in the same, who considering his danger,
commanded a slave of his (who was practiced in Phisique) to give him poison:
And perceiving that by all means he sought occasion not to do it, Why
delayest thou (says he) as if all this were in thy power? armed, I entreat
thee, to yield me death. Hereupon his slave promised to perform it, and gave
him a harmless potion to drink up, wherewith being laid a-sleepe, he came
unto his son and said. Command me to be kept in sure hold, till by the event
thou understand, whether I have given thy Father poison or no. DOMITIVS
lived, and was saved by Caesar; but yet his bondman had saved him first.

CHAP. XXV.
DVring the time of the civil Wars, a bondman hid his Master who was
proscribed, and having fitted his rings on his fingers, and put on his garment,
he presented himself to the Sergeants, and told them that he required no
favor at their hands, but that they boldly might perform that which they
were commanded; and there withal held out his neck for them to hew off. How
great a man's part was this for a slave to be willing to die for his Master in
such a time, as it were rare fidelity not to wish his Masters death? in
public cruelty to be found gentle? in public perfidiousnesse faithful?
when great rewards were published for every one that would betray, to desire
death as the reward of his fidelity?

CHAP. XXVI.
I Will not ouerslip the examples of our Age: under Tiberius Caesar there was
an ordinary license, and almost a public rage in appeaching and accusing,
which (far more grievous than any civil War) consumed and destroyed both
the Senate and Nobility. Exceptions were taken against drunken men's words,
and things spoken in jest were censured in earnest nothing was secure, and all
occasion of cruelty was pleasing; neither now expected men what their penalty
should be who were accused, where all were punished after the same sort. In
that time Paulus who had been a Praetor before-times, supped at a certain
banquet, having on his finger a rich stone, whereon was engraven the Image of
the Emperor Tiberius^ I should play the fool too much if I should seek for
some more cleanely words to express unto you, how he took the chamber pot:
This was presently observed by Maro (who was one of the Spies, and most noted
informer^ of that time.) But his slave (against whom this treason was plotted)
secretly stole away the ring from his Masters finger who was drunk: and when
as Maro afterward would take witness of those that were at the banquet, how
Paulus had handled his members (not to be named without modesty) with the
Emperors Image, and importuning them to subscribe to that accusation, the
slave showed before all the company, that his Masters ring was on his finger.
Whosoever shall term this man a slave, he should also call that other Spy an
honest guest.

CHAP. XXVII.
Under Augustus Caesar, men's words were not as yet dangerous unto them; yet
began they already to displease: Rufus a Senator, as he sat at supper,
wished that Caesar might not return in safety and health from that progress
he then intended; and added this further-more, That all the Bulls and Calves
of the Country desired no less: Some there were that diligently observed his
words: The next morning, as soon as it was day, a servant and bondman of his,
that had attended at his feet, reported unto him those words he had spoken in
his drunkenness the night before, and counseled him presently to go and
seek out Caesar, and to be his own first accuser. According to this his
counsel his Master met Caesar at his first coming down. And when he had
sworn unto him that he was not well in his wits over night, and wished that
the evil he had uttered might fall upon him, and upon his children, and
besought Caesar that he would pardon him, and receive him into his favor
again? After that the Emperor had assured him that he would willingly do
it; no man will believe, said RUFUS, that thou have admitted me again into
thy favor, except thou give me somewhat, and thereupon he required no small
sum of money, at reconciled Caesar's hands, and obtained the same, who there
withal said unto him. For mine own sake I will endeavor never to be angry
with thee without an occasion. CAESA^^ behaved himself honestly in pardoning
him, and besides annexed this liberality to his clemency. Whosoever shall
hear this example reported, he must needly praise Caesar, but it must be after
he has praised the bondman. Except you mean that I should show you that he
was made free for this service he did. He was so; but not without ransom, for
Caesar had paid the money for his freedom.

CHAP. XXVIII.
AFter so many examples, is there any doubt but that a Master may sometimes
receive a benefit at his bond-mans hands? why should the person rather lessen
the dignity of a thing, then the thing ennoble the person? All men have the
same beginnings, and the same original; no man is more noble then another,
except it be such an one that has a better wit, and is more apt to good Arts.
They that set forth their Pedigrees, and their ancestors in a long row,
interlined with many branches of collateral descents on the forefront of their
houses, are rather noted then noble: we have all of us but one parent, which is
the world, whether it be by famous, or bare descent; every man conueyes his
first pedigree from it. There is no cause why these should deceive thee, who
when they reckon up their ancestors: wheresoever some noble name fails them,
they presently feign a god. Despise no man, though his pedigree be worn out of
remembrance, and he smally furthered by unfriendly fortune, whether our
predecessors were freemen, or bond, or forrainers. ^ouragiously advance ye your
minds; and whatsoever baseness lies in the way, leap ye over it. Great
nobility attends for you at the last. Why with pride are we lifted up unto
so great vanity, that from servants we disdain to receive benefits; and look
upon their sort, forgetting deserts? Do thou call any one a servant, thou
being a servant of lust and of gluttony, and of an adulteress, yea a common
slave of adultere^ses? Call thou any one a servant? Whither now art thou
dragged by these grooms; who bear about this thy litter? Whether do these in
liuery-cloaks, who counterfeit a souldier-like, and no vulgar attire indeed?
Whither, I say, do these carry thee abroad? to the door of some
doore-keeper, to the gardens of some, who does not indeed bear office in
ordinary. And yet deniest thou, that a benefit can be given to thee by thy
servant, to whom it is a benefit to have a kiss from the servant of another
man? What so great discord of mind is this? At the same time thou despisest
and reuerencest servants. Within doors thou art imperious and out-ragious,
base abroad; and as well contemned, as contemning. For never do any more abase
their minds, then they who wickedly lift them up: and none are more ready to
tread upon other men, then they who have learned to proffer reproach, by
receiving it.

CHAP. XXIX.
THese things were to be spoken to repress the insolency of men depending
upon fortune, and to approve the right of a benefit to be given by a servant,
that also it might be approved to be given by a son. For it is in question,
whether children at any time can give greater benefits to their parents, then
they have received. This is granted, that many children have been greater, and
more mighty then their parents, as also better and more virtuous then they:
which being true; It may be also that they have done more for them that bred
them; whereas both their fortune was greater, and their will better: But
whatsoever it be (says he) that the son gives the father, it is less then
his father has done for him, because of duty he owes this power of giving to
his father. So as he can never properly be overcome in benefits who has given
another the means to exceed him in the same. For some things take their
beginning from others, and yet they are greater then their beginnings, neither
is any thing therefore greater then that from whence it had his beginning, for
that it could not have grown to that greatness except it had begun. There is
almost nothing but far exceeds his first original. Seeds and grains are
the causes of all that which grows in this world; yet are they the least
parts of those things which come of them. Look upon the Rhine, look upon
Euphrates, finally do but observe all other rivers so renouned, and what are
they if you estimate them by their head-springs from whence they flow?
whatsoever they be feared for, wherein soever they be renouned, they have
purchased it in their course and progress. Take away roots and the Forests
will never grow nor ouerspread, neither shall the tops of the mountains be
covered with woods. Look upon these Timber Trees, whether you regard their
great height, or their wonderful solidity and broad spreading of their
branches, how small a thing, in comparison of these, is that which the root in
small and tender spreadings comprehends. The Temples are builded upon their
foundations, as also these great walls of Rome, are, and yet that which was
first laid to sustain this whole work, lies hidden under earth. The like
falls out in all other things. The greatness that they attain unto in time,
does always obscure their beginnings. I could not have attained to any thing,
if the benefit of my parents had not gone before; yet follows it not for all
this, that that which I have obtained is less then that same which gave me
the means to acquire it: Except my nurse had suckled me in infancy, I could
have performed none of those things, which I have sithence acted by my counsel
and valor, neither should I have obtained this dignity and honor, which I
have risen unto by civil and military demerit: but will thou for this cause
more prize my nurses first endeavors, then the great acts I have achieved by
my so many virtuous attempts. And then what difference will thou find herein,
considering that I could not increase in honor, without the tender care of my
nurse, no less then without my fathers benefit?

CHAP. XXX.
But if I owe wholly to my beginning, whatsoever I more can do, think you that
neither my father is my true beginning, nor my Grandfather indeed. For always
there will be somewhat more ancient, from which the original of the nearest
original may descend. But no man is said to owe more to them that are
unknown, and to ancestors which have been before memory of man, then to a
father. But, I owe more, if my father, because he has begotten me, owneth this
very thing unto his ancestors. Whatsoever I have done for my father, how great
soever it be, it is nothing to be esteemed in respect of the benefit he has
done me, for I had not bin, had he not begotten me. And by the same reason, if
any man has healed my father, being sick and ready to die, I should be able
to do nothing for him that were not to be esteemed less, then the benefit he
did unto my father: for had he not received his health, my father had never
begotten me. But see if this carry not a more likelihood of truth, that the
things which I could both do, and have done, should be esteemed as mine own,
and in mine own power, and at mine own will. That I am borne (if thou
consider what a thing it is in it self) thou shall find it a small and
uncertain matter, and the common subject of good and evil, and undoubtedly
the first step to all things; but yet not therefore greater then all, because
the first. I have preserved and kept my Father alive, I have preferred and
exalted him to the highest degree of honor, and have made him a Prince in his
City: I have enobled him, not only by those my virtuous enterprises, which I
have honorably achieved; but also have given him an assured means to advance
himself, I have put into his hands an easy means to obtain much honor and
glory: I have heaped together upon him dignities and riches, and all
whatsoever men's ambition can desire. And where I surpassed all others in
authority, I submitted my self to him: Tell me now, I pray thee, if thou
could do all these things, except it were by thy fathers means? I will
briefly answer, and tell thee, that it is altogether so, if to the performance
of so many worthy things it sufficed only to be borne. But if to live well and
virtuously a naked life is the least part, and if thou have but given me that
which is common to me, with brute beasts, yea, with the least, the most
despised, and the most loathsome: I beseech thee attribute not that to thy
self, which proceeds not alone from thy benefits, although in some sort
also, it cannot either breed or be without thine. Suppose that for the life
which thou have given, I have restored thy life: in so doing likewise I have
surmounted thy benefit, because I know what I give, and thou that which thou
receiuedst: whereas I gave thee life, not for my pleasure sake, or with my
pleasure, when seeing it is so much more estimable to be able to retain and
conserve life, then to receive the same, by how much it is less dreadful and
terrible to die, then to apprehend the fear and conceit of death.

CHAP. XXXI.
I Gave thee a life, that thou might presently use: thou gave me a life,
when I knew not whether I should enjoy it, or no. I gave thee life, when thou
were in danger of death: thou have given me life, to the end I might die. I
have given thee a consummate and per^ite life: thou have engendered me deprived
of reason and judgment, and no otherwise but to be a burden to others arms.
Will thou know how small a benefit it is to give life in such sort? If thou
had cast me forth, then in that case it had been injury to have begotten
me. Whereby I gather, that our begetting by father and mother, is the least
benefit that can be, except other things accompany it, that must prosecu^e the
beginning of this benefit, A Christian doctrine from a ^ea^^en Stoic.
and so ratify the same by other offices. It is no good thing to live, but to
live well. But you will say, I live well: yea, but so I might also have lived
ill: therefore this only is thine, that I live. If thou imputest unto me a
life in it self, naked and destitute of counsel, and boastest thereof, as if
it were a good and great thing: think with thy self, that thou imputest to me
such a good, which is common as well to worms and flies, as to me. Moreover,
not to vaunt of any other thing, but only in that I have endeavored my self
to learn the liberal sciences, to the end I might direct the rest of my life
in the right way: if I live discreetly by this means, thou have in this
received a greater benefit then thou gave me. For thou gave me unto my
self both rude and ignorant, and I gave my self to thee such a son, as thou
may rejoice that ever thou bego^test me.

CHAP. XXXII.
MY father nourished me, if I do no less for him, herein I am more
beneficial unto him, because he not only conceiueth joy, in that he is
nourished, but because he is nourished by his son, and grea^ter pleasure and
contentment he receives in my good will, then he does in the gift it self.
The meat which he gave me, only nourished my body. What if a man has so far
advanced his own fortunes, that either for his eloquence, his justice, or his
chiualrie^ he should grow famous in foreign countries, and had also made his
father highly renowned, and so by his luster dispelled the obscurity and
cloudie darkness of his base birth: has he not, think you, herein bestowed
an inestimable benefit upon his parents? Should any man ever have known
Ariston and Grillus, had it not been for ^en^phon and Plato their sons?
Socrates exempteth Sophro^is^us his name from oblivion and death. It were too
long to reckon up all the rest, who live by no other means, but, in that their
children eternized their memories, by their own famous actions. Whether did
Agrippa the father (who after his sons greatness was scarcely known in
Rome) give a greater benefit, or Agrippa the son to his father, who alone was
honored with a Nauall Crown (which was the greatest honor that was
accustomed to be given to men of war) who raised so many sumptuons buildings
in the City, which both exceeded all former magnificence, and were never
equalled by any after? Whether did Octauius give his son Augustus the Emperor a
greater benefit, or the Emperor Augustus to his father, although the shadow of
adoptiue father had in some sort obscured the benefit of Octauius? What joy and
contentment had he conceived, if after the extirpation of a civil war, he
had seen him command and govern the Roman Empire in security and peace? Who
doubts, but that he could hardly acknowledge his own good, or sufficiently
believe the same, and as often as he considered his own mean estate, conceive
that such a man a^ he could be borne in his house? Why should I now prosecute
the rest, whom oblivion had already swallowed up, except their childrens glory
had delivered them out of this forgetful darkness? Moreover, we enquire not
whether any son has given greater benefits to his father then he received at
his hands^ but, whether any son can yield greater? And although the examples
of those which hitherto I have related, do not as yet suffice and satisfy,
neither surpass the good which they have received at their fathers hands; yet
Nature may make us s^^, that h^reafter, which has not as yet been seen by
the ages ^ore passed. I^ on^ only benefit cannot surmonnt the greatness of
parents deserts, it may be that many put together may outstrip them.

CHAP. XXXIII.
SCipio then but a boy, in a certain battle set spurs to his horse, and
charging the enemy, saved his fathers life: And is it but a small matter,
when, to make good the place where his father fought, he contemned so many
dangers, that he pressed so many great Captains, that he brake through as many
opposites as he found before him: in the first service that ever he had seen,
and being as yet but a raw soldier, he s^t forward and charged before the
oldest seruitors, and performed many valorous actions, far exceeding the
forces of his age? Add hereunto, that he defended his father, being accused of
a capital crime, and delivered him from the conspiracy of his mighty enemies,
that he gave him a second and third consulate, and other honors also, which
they who before time have been Consuls, might wish and crave for: and seeing
him poor, gave him those goods which he had gotten by right of war, and that
which a man who makes prof^ssion of arms esteems most honorable also: he
enriched him with those spoils which he had gotten from his enemies. If this
as yet seem but little unto thee, thou may add the Provinces which he gave
him, and the governments and extraordinary charges, which were afterward
continued unto him by his means. Add further, that after he had razed so many
great cities, how this brave man (the defender and founder of the Roman Empire,
that was to be extended from the East unto the West, without a Riual) enobled
him the more, who was already noble. Say that he was Scipios father, yet
undoubtedly the common and ordinary good that parents do in begetting
children, has been far surmounted by Scipios incomparable piety and virtue,
who I know not whether he brought the City more defense or honor.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
THen if these examples seem little unto thee; admit that some man has
delivered his father from torments, suppose that he himself has suffered the
same to deliver him. For thou may dilate and extend the childrens benefits
as far as thou will. Whereas contrariwise the fathers benefit in procreation
is not only simple and easy, but further not voluntary also in him that
gives: what need we so many words? Lex Pappia, or Poppea.
The father has given being to those, to whom he knows not, whether he has
given being or no, wherein he has his wife a consort and partaker, wherein he
respects the law of his Country, the praise and reward of Parents, the
perpetuity of his house and family, and all things rather then him to whom he
gave the same: what if any one (having obtained wisdom) has informed and
instructed his father therein, shall we now grow in question whether he has
given any thing greater then he received? Considering that he has given his
father a happy life, having received at his fathers hands but a badde life
only; but says he, it is the fathers benefit whatsoever thou do, or
whatsoever thou can return unto him again. So is it the benefit of my
Master, if I have profited in liberal studies^ and yet we may transcend and
surpass those goods, we have received from those, who have taught us, as we
also do their benefits, who have taught us to read, and to know our first
elements. And although without them no man can learn any thing, yet all that
which he has afterward learned is not the inferior to the same: There is a
great difference betwixt the first and the greatest things: neither therefore
are the first comparable to the greatest, because without the first the
greatest cannot be.

CHAP. XXXV.
IT is time now, if I may so term it, to produce some pe^ces of our own
coin. He that has bestowed such a benefit, above which there may be somewhat
found better, may be overcome in benefits: The Father gave life unto his
Son, but there is something better then life, so the father may be overcome
in a benefit by the son, because the son may give some thing better and
greater then the father. Furthermore, he that has given life to an other man,
if once or twice ^e were delivered by the same man from death, he has received
a greater ben^^it then that which he gave; so the father has given life; but
if he be oft-tim^s delivered from the peril of death by his son, he shall
receive a greater b^nefit then he gave him. He that has received a good turn,
the more he needs that which he has received, he has received the great^r
goodness: but he t^^t lives, has more want of life, then he that is not borne
(as of whom he cann^t properly say, to have need of any thing.) The father
therefore has receiu^^ ^ greater good turn, if he has received life at his
sons hands, then the son from the father, in that he is borne: But the
parents benefits cannot be surmounted by these good offices, the child
performs unto him, why? because he ^ath received his life from his father,
which had he not received he could not have given a benefit. This is then but
common to the father, and all those who have at any time given life to any man.
For had they not received life, they could not have returned beneficial
gratitude: Therefore greater sa^tisfaction is not intended to the Physician,
though the Phys^^^^^ likewise i^ wont to give life; nor to the Mariner though
he has saved from shipwreck, so that a man may surmount the benefits both of
the one and ^he other, who has by any means saved our life's; and consequently
then the benefits of our parents may be also exceeded: if any man has done me
a good turn which serves me to no use, except it be assisted and seconded by
the ^auours of diuer^ other persons, and if afterward I have done him an other
courtesy, that has no need of other men's assistance, I have given a greater
good turn then that which I have received: The father has given life to his
child, which he should loose instantly, were it not sustained by diverse other
succours^ But if the son has saved his fathers life, he has given him such
a life, as has no need of any other assistance to sustain it self of it
self. Ergo the father receiving life at his sons hands, receives a greater
benefit, then that was which the father has given him.

CHAP. XXXVI.
Note the authors prudence.
THese things destroy not the reverence which is due unto parents, neither make
they their children to become worse unto them, but rather better: for virtue is
of a glorious and noble disposition, and deserves to outstrip the foremost.
The piety and affection of children will be more forward, if they may hope to
surmount the kindness and favor their parents have done them. If this should
happen to parents willing and glad of the same (because in many things it is
for our own good to be overcome) whence can we imagine to ensue so
acceptable a contention, whence so great happiness to parents, as to confess
that they cannot equal their childrens benefits? If we be not thus minded, we
give our children means to excuse themselves, and we shall make them more slow
and retchlesse in acknowledging their fathers benefits, whereas we ought to
excite them the more, and say unto them, Do this worthy children. An honest
contention is raised btwixt parents and their children, to know which of them
has given the greatest benefits, or who has received the most. The fathers
have not therefore prevailed, because they have given the fir^^. Take heart
young men worthy your selves, take heed you loose not your courage to overcome
those who desire no other thing then to be overcome: You want no Captains to
undertake so brave a conflict, and to encourage you to follow them, who command
you but to go the same course for to obtain ^^ese victories, which they have
often gained against their parents.

CHAP. XXXVII.
AENEAS ouer-came his father in courtesy, for his father carried him in his
arms when he was an Infant (a weight neither dangerous nor heavy) where the
other bare him on his shoulders, laden with age, through the midst of the armed
enemy, and through the falling ruins of his City, at such time as the devout
old man embraced betwixt his arms his domestique Gods, and the sacred Relics
of his house, loding his sons shoulders with more then his own person, yet
went he onward with much ado: carrying him through the slames and ruins of
the City (what is it not, but the piety and love of a son may preserve) and
bringing him out of all danger, ranked him afterward amongst the Gods, and
placed him in the number of those first founders of the Roman Empire, to be
honored and reverenced with them. The young men of Sicily ouer-came and
surmounted their fathers. For at such time as Mount AEtna was so highly
enflamed, Two young men of Sicily the one called Amphinomus, the other An^pus.
that it vomited fire upon the Cities and neighboring Plains, and had
consumed the greater part of the Isle, they carried their fathers thence upon
their backs: It is believed that the fire miraculously separated and divided it
self, and that the flames retiring themselves on both sides, opened a large
passage to suffer those virtuous young men to travel through it, to the end
that without danger they might safely perform their great attempt: Antigonus
son also ouer-came in this kind, who when as in a great battle he had
discom^^^ed his enemy, transferred the treasures and wealth of the conquest,
to his father, and with it gave him the Empire of Cipres. This is a Kingdom in
mind to refuse government, See Cicero 3. de Ossicijs, and Liuie in his 7.
Book, as touching this Manlius.
when it is in thy hands. Titus Manlius also ouer-came his Lordly and Imperious
father; who although he had been driven out of his fathers house for a time,
and sent into the Country, because in his youth he was somewhat hard in
apprehension, yet came he to the Tribune of the people (who had adjoined his
father to appear in person to answer to a capital crime) and asking him what
time of appearance, he had assigned his father. The Tribune hoping that he
would betray his hated father, supposing that he had done herein a thankful
office for the young man, he suffered him to see, (amongst other crimes he
accused him of) how he had banished and driven him out of his house: which
when the young man discovered, getting him alone in a secret place, he drew his
dagger which he had hidden in his bosom, and said; Except thou swear to
revoke this personal adiourniment of my fathers, I will thrust thee through
with this weapon: It lies in thy power to choose which of these two ways, my
father shall have no accuser. The Tribune swore and kept touch with him: but
he made it known in an assembly of the Roman people, why he had desisted from
this accusation. It had not been possible for any other man to have ouer-ruled
the Tribune after this manner, and to escape unpunished.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
Diverse examples might I produce of many other memorable children, who have
delivered their parents from danger, that from a base degree have raised them
to high estate, and from the meanest and ignoblest race of men, have given them
eternal and indefinite honors: It cannot be expressed by any force of words or
faculty of wit, how great a work it is, how praise worthy, and how perdurable
and lasting in men's memory; justly to be able to say, thus much I have obeyed
my parents: I have fulfilled their commandments in whatsoever it were, either
right, or wrong; I have showed my self obseruant and submissiue, in this only
thing I have been wilful, that I would not be overcome by them in benefits:
Fight valiantly therefore, I pray you young men, and though you were defeated,
yet reinforce the fight anew. These that overcome shall be happy. They that
shall be overcome shall be no less blessed; what person can ever receive
more honor? then that young man, who may say unto himself (for it is not
lawful for him to say it to an other) I have overcome my father in
well-doing? Is there any old man more happy, then he that may vaunt in all
places, and before the whole world, that he has been overcome by his son
in well-doing and benefiting? What greater happiness is there for a man so to
yield unto himself?

The end of the third Book.
LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE FOVRTH BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
HE handled curious matters for the most part, but (according to his usual
custom) intermixed with those that are profitable. He demands whether a
benefit or favor may be simply in it self desired? He proves the
affirmative against the Epicures, who measured all things by their profit.
Amongst other arguments he teaches by this, that the Gods also give benefits,
which he proves very amply against those that deny the Gods. Then he remoueth
some objections, which seem to teach, that profit is common in benefitting.
And so he comes to thanksgiving, and shows that it is only to be yielded
in regard of honesty, not of profit. Then he demands whether a benefit is to
be given to him whom thou know will be ungrateful: he distinguishes in
this point, and partly affirms, and partly denies.

CHAP. I.
OF all those things (my AEbutius Liberalis) whereof we have entreated, there
is nothing so necessary to be known, or (as Salust says) more carefully to
be taught, then that which is now in hand; namely, whether to give a benefit,
and to restore the like, be things which ought to be desired for the love of
themselves. Some men there are which respect not honesty, but for profit sake,
and admit not virtue without advantage (which has nothing magnificent in it
self, if it has any thing that is mercinarie.) For what is more loathsome,
then for a man to make reckoning how much we ought to estimate an honest man,
when as virtue is neither invited with gain, nor terrified with loss, and is
so far from corrupting any with hope or promise, that contrariwise she
commands men to spend all their substance on her, and for her sake; and more
often contenteth her self with that which is given freely without demand? To
follow her, a man must tread all profit under foot: whither soever she
calls, whither soever she sends, he ought to go, without respect or
interest of his estate or private affairs: and sometimes also he must set
forward with the hazard of his own blood and life, neither must he ever
refuse her commandments. What reward shall I then have say thou, if I do
this thing valiantly, or that thing gratefully? Only this, that thou have done
it; virtue promises thee nothing beside her self. If any profit casually
befall thee, account it amongst thine accessarie good happes. The price of
honest things is in themselves, if then that which is honest be to be desired
for it self, and a benefit being honest, the condition thereof cannot be
different from honesty, because they are both of one nature. But that the
thing which is honest is to be desired for it self, it is often and abundantly
proved already.

CHAP. II.
IN this point I must wage war with the nice and effeminate troop of
Epicures, that talk of Philosophy only at their banquet, with whom virtue is
the vassal and handmaid of vicious pleasure^ them she obeys, them she
serves, them she beholds preferred above her self. There is no pleasure
(says he) without virtue. But why is voluptuousness advanced before virtue?
Think thou we dispute of the order between them, no, the question is of the
whole matter, and the power thereof, it is not virtue if it dance attendance
after delight. The chiefest place is hers, she it is that must lead, command,
and have the chiefest place: thou biddest her ask the watchword. What
skilleth it thee, says the Epicure? I also maintain, that a blessed life
cannot be without virtue. I condemn and contemn the pleasure it self which
I follow, and to which I have made my self a bondslaue, if virtue be removed
from it. The only question is in this, whether virtue be the cause of the
chiefest good, or the chiefest good it self. Admit that this be the only thing
in question, think thou that there is but the only change of place and
order only between them, that breeds the difference? This is a very
confusion, this is a manifest blindness, to prefer the last before the
first. I am not displeased because virtue is placed after pleasure, but because
it is any ways or at all compared, or paralelled with pleasures. Virtue is the
despiser and enemy of delight, and estrangeth her self far from her, more
familiar with labor and sorrow, more fitly to be inserted into manly
incommodities, then into this effeminate felicity.

CHAP. III.
THese things (my Liberalis) were to be spoken of, because a benefit, (whereof
we now entreat) is an act of virtue, and foul shame it were to give it for
any other respect, then to have given it only. For if we do a courtesy in
expectation of a recompense, then should we do it to the wealthiest, and not to
the worthiest. Now we prefer a poor man unable to requite, before a rich man.
It is no benefit that has reference to Fortune, or hope of interest. Besides,
if only profit should entice us to do good, they should do least good, that
have most means. Such as are rich men, powerful men, and Kings, because they
have least need of other men's help. But the Gods likewise should withdraw
their so many liberalities, which, without intermission, day and night they
power upon us. For why, their proper nature and being suffices them in all
things, and makes them abundant, secure, and inviolable every way. To none
therefore should they give their benefits, if their only cause of giving
proceeded from no other intention, then to think on themselves and their own
private commodities. This is no benefit, but a loan upon use, to respect not
where you may best bestow it, but where you may place it most gainfully, whence
you may most readily receive it. Which intention, seeing it is far estranged
from the Gods: it follows that they are divinely liberal. For if the only
cause of giving a benefit, were the giuers profit, and no profit is to be
hoped or expected by God at our hands; there is no cause why God should be
bountiful unto us.

CAAP. IIII.
I Know well what answer is made hereunto, These are the Epicures reasons,
full of blasp^emie and impiety.
which is, that God bestows no good upon us, but is altogether careless and
regardlesse of us, and not daring to cast his eyes upon this world, busieth
himself about other matters or (which seems to the Epicure to be the
chiefest felicity) he does nothing, neither do benefits or injuries touch
him. He that thus says, hears not the vows of those that pray, neither the
cries nor vows which every one makes, as well in private, as in public,
lifting up their joined hands unto heaven: which undoubtedly would not be done,
neither would all mankind consent unto this madness, to implore a deaf
deity, and invoke such gods as had no power to help them, if they knew not
assuredly that the Gods give benefits, sometimes of their own proper motion,
otherwhiles upon prayers, that it is they, from whom we receive so many great
graces in their due times and seasons, and that by their assistance we are put
out of fear, of such imminent and eminent mischiefs, as daily threaten us:
who is he that is so miserable, and rejected by heaven? who is he that is so
disgraced, and borne to continual affliction and travel? that has not
sometimes felt these great favors and liberalities of the Gods? Do but
behold, I pray you, even those who incessantly complain of their miseries, and
who live so mal-contented with their fortunes, yet shall thou find, that they
are not wholly exempted, and destitute of succors from heaven, and that there
is no man on whom there has not fallen some drops from this sweet and
gracious fountain. Think thou that it is a small matter which is equally
distributed to all those that are borne in this world? And (to omit those
things which the Gods bestow at their pleasure, with all proportion of measure)
is it a small matter that nature has given us, when she has given us her
self?

CHAP. V.
Does not God bestow all benefits upon us? In this Chapter follows a nobl^
contemplation of Gods benefits, and men's negligence, and careless
consideration ^herof.
From whence then have thou all those things whereof thou art possessed? which
thou give? which thou deniest? which thou keep? which thou take
unjustly? From whence come the infiniteness of things that delight the eyes,
affect the care, and please the understanding? From whence is this abundance,
that furnishes our royoto^s excess? For they have not only provided for our
necessities, but we are tendered by them even unto delicacie also. From whence
have we so many trees, bearing sundry sorts of sauourie fruit, so many
wholesome herbs, for the maintenance of our healths, such variety of meats,
strong for all seasons through the whole year, that an idle sluggard may find
by casualtie sufficient sustenance upon the earth to feed and nourish him.
Whence come so many sorts of beasts? whereof some are bread on the earth, other
some in the water, and others descending from the air, to the end there might
not be any part of nature, that should not be tributarie unto us of some rent?
The Rivers likewise, whereof some enuiron the plains, with their pleasant
reuolutions and roundnesse, other stream through their hollow and nauigable
channels, bring us merchandise from foreign seas, of which some at certain
prefixed times take wonderful increase, so as the sudden force of the Summers
flood moisteneth and waters those grounds which are situate and planted under
the droughtie and burning Zoane. What shall I say of the veins of some
medicinable waters? What shall I speak of the bubling and boiling up of hot
Bathes even upon the very shoares?

And what of thee O mighty Lake, and thee
Proud billowed Benac swelling like the Sea. Georg.

CHAP. VI.
IF a man had given thee a few acres of land, thou would say that thou
hadest received a benefit at his hands, and deniest thou that the unmeasurable
extent of the barren earth is no benefit? If a man should give thee money, and
fill thy coffer (for that seems a great thing in thy sight) thou would
term it a benefit. And think thou it no favor, that God has hidden so
many metals in the earth, spread so many rivers on the sands, which floating,
discover ingots of massy gold, silver, brass, and iron, which he has hidden
every where; that he has given thee means and knowledge to find it out, by
setting marks of his covert riches on the upper face of the earth? If a man
should give thee a house enriched with marble pillars, if the cover thereof
were resplendent, and painted with gold and goodly colors, thou would
highly esteem this present of his? God has builded thee a great palace,
without any danger of fear or falling down, wherein thou see not little
pieces, smaller then the chizell it self, wherewith they were carved, but
entire huge masses of precious stone, all fastened and fashioned after a diverse
and different manner, the least piece whereof makes thee wonder at the beauty
of the same: the roof whereof shines after one sort by day, and after another
by night: and will thou then deny that thou have received any benefit at all?
Again, whereas thou set great store by that which thou have, think thou
(which is the point of a thanklesse person) that thou art beholding to no body
for them? Whence have thou this breath which thou drawest? Whence comes this
light, whereby thou disposest and orderest the actions of thy life? From whence
have thou thy blood, in the motion and flowing whereof, thy natural heat is
maintained? Whence come these meats, which by their delicate tastes and
pleasing savors, inuit thee to ^ate far more then thy stomach can digest?
Whence come these things which awaken thy pleasures and delights, when thou art
wearied? Whence comes this quiet and repose, wherein thou ^ot^^st and
witherest away? Will thou not say, if thou be thankful: From God springs
this repose, and evermore
Him for my God ^^e honor and adore. Virg. 1. ^cl^g.

Upon his Altar, to perform my vow,
A fir^tling Lamb my pastures shall allow:
For he it is, as thou do plainly see,
That yields my wandering teame their pasture free,
He lets me time at pleasure, as they feed,
My country lays upon mine ^^te^ re^d.
It is that God, which has not only permitted us to feed a small number of
meat, but that has filled the whole world with great troops of cattle, that
nourishes all beasts which wander here and there, in so many and diverse
places; that gives them new pa^ture^ in Summer time, after they have eaten up
their Winter provision: which has not only taught us to play upon a reed, and
after some manner to tune a reed, and delightfully sing to it; but also has
invented so many arts, so many varieties of voices, and so many sounds, to
yield sundry tunes, some by force of our own breath, and some by a borrowed
and external air. For thou can not call those things ours, which we have
invented, no more then thou can call it our own doing that we grow, or that
the body has his full proportion, according to his determinate times. Now our
teeth fall in our infancy, anon after we pass into an age, which in a few
years gives us all our increase, again, ripe age after our young and
springing years, making us become more strong, setleth us in a perfect and
manly age. Finally, we are come to the last period, which makes an end of the
care and course of our life. The seeds of all ages and sciences are hidden in
us from our birth, and that great workman God produces out of the hidden all
natural instincts.

CHAP. VII.
IT is nature, says he, that communicates and gives me all these things.
Understand thou not that in speaking after this manner, thou changest the
name of God? For what else is nature but God, and a divine being and reason,
which by his searching assistance resideth in the world, and all the parts
thereof^ A^ often as thou listest thou may call him, sometimes the Author of
all things, and sometimes Jove, (most good and most mighty.) Thou may also
well ^^arme him the Thunderer, and establisher, who had not that name given
him, because (as the Historiographers write) that after the Romans had made
their vows unto him, he reinforced their hearts, and discomforted armies in
the^^ behal^e: but because all things stand and are established by his benefit,
he is therefore so called. Thou shall not also lie, if thou call him Destiny,
for whereas Fate and Destiny is but an immutable ordinance, which holds all
causes (...) and chained together: he it is that is the first of all, and he on
whom all the rest tha^ follow do depend. Thou may fit him with any other
names wha^soeuer thou will, provided that they signify and contain the force
and effects of celestial things. In brief, he may have as many names, as he
has attributes of graces, wherewith he besteedeth us.

CHAP. VIII.
Our men likewise suppose that he is Father Liber, that he is Hercules and
Mercury. Father Liber, because all things have had their being and original
from him. Because that by his means we first of all found out, and knew the
power and virtue of seeds, which should afterward nourish us with a sweet and
honest pleasure. Hercules, because his force is invincible, which when it shall
be wearied in performing actions, and producing inferior things, shall return
into fire. Mercury, because it is he from whom reason proceeds, and the
judgment, numbers, ranckes and order of things, and all those sciences, which
we term Liberal. Whither soever thou turnest thee, there shall thou see him
meet^ with thee: nothing is void of him. He himself fills his work to the
full. Thou preuailest nothing then (thou vngratefullest man of the world) when
thou auowest, that thou art no ways indebted to God, but to Nature: for
neither is Nature without God, nor God without Nature. Both these two are but
one, and differ not. If thou should confess that thou owe to Ann^us or to
Lucius, that which Seneca has lent thee, thou should only change the name,
but not the Creditour. For whether thou call him by his name or surname, it
is always one man,. Call him then as thou please, either Nature or Fate, or
Fortune, it makes no matter, because they all are the names of the selfsame
God, who diuersely uses his divine providence. Even as Justice, Integrity,
Prudence, Magnanimity, Temperance, and the goods and virtues of the soul, if
any of these please thee, it is then the soul that pleases thee also.

CHAP. IX.
But lest by these discourses I should wander, I say that God bestows many
and mighty benefits, expenses without hope of interest or recompense: for he
has no need of our tributes, neither can we also give him any thing. A benefit
therefore ought to be desired, for the love of it self; the only thing that is
respected therein, is the profit of the receiver: herein let us employ our
selves, forgetting our own private commodities. You say (says he) that we
ought to make diligent election of those on whom we will bestow our benefits,
(considering the laborers and husbandmen themselves, will not commit their
seeds unto the sands) which if it be true, we regard in giving benefits, as we
do in laboring and sowing our land: for to sow is not a thing that should be
desired only of it self. Furthermore, you ask us to whom we ought to give
our benefits? which should not be done, if to give a benefit were a thing to be
desired of it it self, in what place soever, after what manner soever it was
given, it was a benefit: for we follow that which is honest, for no other
respect, but for the love of it self. Yet although no other thing be to be
followed, we require what we shall do, and when, and how, for that honesty
consists of these circumstances. When therefore I make choice of a man on
whom I will bestow a courtesy, I do it to the end that I may never fail to
do a benefit. Because if it be bestowed upon an unworthy man, it can be
neither honest, nor a benefit.

CHAP. X.
TO restore a thing which a man is put in trust withal, The method of
restitution.
is a thing to be desired of it self; yet ought I not to restore it always,
nor in all places, nor at all times. Sometimes it skilleth not whether I deny,
or whether I restore the same in all men's sight, I will respect his profit to
whom I am to restore it, and perceiving that by my restitution I shall do him
injury, I will deny him his right. The same will I do in a benefit: I will
see when I give, to whom I give, how I give, and why I give. For nothing is to
be done without reason: it is no good turn, except it be done upon reason,
because reason ought to accompany all honest things. How often have we heard
men, that have reproved their own inconsiderate larges, and cast forth these
words, I had rather have lost it, then to have given it to such a one. It is
the most vilanous manner of losing that may be, for a man to give foolishly and
without consideration: and it is much more distastefull to have employed a
benefit badly, then not to have received any. For it is another man's fault, if
we receive not, but it is our own, that we made better election and choice in
bestowing it. In making my choice, I will respect nothing less then thou
think, namely from whom I shall receive satisfaction. Oftentimes he that
never requiteth is grateful, and he ungrateful that has made requital; my
estimation aims at nothing but the mind and heart. And therefore will I
ouerpasse the rich unworthy man, and will bestow my courtesies on the poor
good man: for in his greatest wants he will be thankful, and when all things
fall him, his mind and true heart shall not fail him. I seek to raise no
profit for my courtesies, neither affect I pleasure or glory: I content my self
that I can pleasure one man. I will give to this only intent and end, that I
may give that which I ought: and that which I ought to do, is not to be done
without choice and election; which, of what quality it shall be, do you ask
me the question?

CHAP. XI.
I Will choose an honest, simple, mindful, and grateful man, that usurps not
upon another man's fortunes, nor niggardly hoardeth up his own, or intends
evil unto any man. When I have made this election, although Fortune has left
this man no power to yield any satisfaction, yet have I accomplished my desire,
and obtained my wish. If profit or base consideration makes me liberal, if I
profit no man, but to the end that he may pleasure me: I will not give a
gratuit^e to him that trauaileth into diverse and foreign Countries: I will not
give unto him that will be always absent; I will not give unto such a one, who
is so sick, that there is no hope of his recovery, I will not give, whereas I
am dying my self, for I shall have no time to receive friendship again. But
to let thee know, that a benefit is a thing that ought to be desired for the
love of it self: we succor strangers, that are upon the instant cast upon
our coasts, and will presently depart for another: we must give and riggeship
to such a one that has suffered shipwreck, that it may carry him back again
into his own country. He departs suddenly, scarcely knowing him that was the
author of his safety, and making no reckoning ever more to return or reuisit
him again. He assigns the payment of his debt unto the gods, and beseeches
them, that since he has no means of satisfaction, that it will please them to
be thankful in his behalf: mean while the conscience of a barren benefit
does content us. See thou now, that at such time when we are at deaths door,
we make our last Will and Testament, and dispose our goods and possessions,
although we can reap no profit thereby? How much time is spent; how long are
we secretly deliberating how much and to whom we shall give? For what skils it
to whom we give, if we shall receive of none? And yet we never give any thing
more diligently, we never more travel and rack our iudge^ents, then when as
setting all profit aside, we only set honesty before our eyes: for so long
are we evil judges of our own offi^es, as long as hope, fear, and pleasure
(the dishonestest vice of all) depraueth our iudgemtnts. But when the assurance
of death has made us lose the hope of all things, and has That is, our selves
dying. See Lipsius his note.
sent a just and uncorrupted Judge to give sentence, then seek we out the most
worthy, to whom we may deliver our inheritance; neither dispose we any thing
with more circumspection and regard, then those our possessions which
appertain no longer unto us.

CHAP. XII.
ANd undoubtedly, even then conceiueth a man the greatest contentment, when he
thinks with himself; I will make such a one more rich then he is, by giui^^
him a piece of my possessions: I will in^rease the honor and nobility of his
house: In brief, if we never give, but when we hope to receive again, we must
die intestate. Thou maintaynest (says he) that a benefit is a debt
vnrepayable: but a debt is not a thing to be desired for it self, Ergo,
benefiting or good doing, is not a thing to be desired of it self. When we
call it a debt, we use a comparison and translation. So likewise say we that
the law is a rule of just and unjust; and yet the rule is not to be desired as
a thing of it self, but we are constrained to use these words, the better to
express our intent and meaning. When I say a debt, it is to be understood as a
thing trusted. Will thou know all? I add further, vnrepayable, which shall
never be satisfied; although there be not any debt, but either may or ought to
be paid. Good deeds are not to be done and per^ormed either for asse^^ation or
vaineglory, but for virtues sake.
It is so far from it, that we ought to do a pleasure for our profit sake^
that for the most part (as I have said) we ought to do it, though it were to
our loss and peril. As for example; I rescue a man circumuented by th^^^^^,
to the end he may be permitted to pass in security: I defend a guilty person,
disgraced and oppressed by the credit of his adversaries, and purchase to my
self the displeasure and faction of great men for my labor, to receive
perchance by the means of the same, accusers, the disgraces and miseries I
freed the poor man of: whereas I might have been party against him, or
beheld a far off, and with all assurance the debates and contentions which were
entertained by other men: I give caution for my friend adjudged, and suffer not
execution to be served upon his goods, but offer my self to be bound for him
to his creditors, and to save him from the prescription, I come in danger to be
outlawed my self. No man determines to buy a place near Tus^^, or Tiburtine
for his health sake, or for the sweetness of the air, and avoiding the summer
heats, that debateth for how many years he shall buy it: but when he has
bought it, he must keep it. The same reason is in benefits. For if you shall
ask me, what profit will accrue thereby: I will answer, a good conscience.
Ask thou what pro^^t is yielded by benefiting? I ask thee likewise, what
profits it to do justly, to live innocently, to be valiant and stout in
honorable dangers, to live chastely, to be temperate, if thou seek any other
interest then themselves?

CHAP. XIII.
TO what end continues the heaven his daily and usual course? To what end is
it, that the Sun enlarges and shortneth the day? All these are but benefits,
for they are made for our profit. Even as it is the office of this Universe, to
turn about and dispose of the order of all things: as it is the office of the
Sun, where he may arise, and where he may set, and to perform all these
fair, profitable, and wholesome effects for our sake, without hope of any
profit from us: so is it the duty of one man, amongst other things, to do
good unto another. Ask thou me, why he gives these benefits? Forsooth to
this end, that he may not be vpbraided with guing nothing, and that he may not
lose the occasion of well-doing. But all your pleasure and delight, is to
accustom your delicate bodies to a lazy idleness, and to long for a
security, resembling that of sleep, to couch and lie hidden under a close
covert and arbor, and to entertain the dullness of your decayed minds, and to
honor them with sweet and agreeable thoughts, which you call tranquillity, and
repose of spirit, to pamper your unwieldy carcasses while they wax wanne with
meats and drinks, in the caves and cabinets of your gardens. Contrariwise, we
feel a pleasure truly worthy a man in giving benefits: although that they
breed us much sorrow and labor, provided they set them out of trouble for whom
we do them: although they be full of danger, provided that we relieve others
from their misery: although all be to the loss and diminution of our
substance, provided that another man's poverty and necessity be relieved. What
have I do to receive benefits at another man's hands? When I have r^^eiued
them, I must employ and bestow them. A b^nefite respects not our particular,
but only his profit to whom it is given; otherwise we give unto our selves,
and not unto others. And by this reason many things which breed another man
great profit, lose their grace, because they are done for gain. The Merchant
is very profitable for the City, the Physician for the sick, and the Mango is
one that properly sells slaue^, young boys or girls, as their old custom
was.
Regrater for goods that are to be sold. But because all these are not
profitable to any, but to enrich themselves, they oblige not those who receive
good by them.

CHAP. XIIII.
IT is no benefit that is employed to profit. This will I give, this will I
take, is but open sale and chaffering. I will not call her modest that repulsed
her lover, to the end to enkindle his love the greater, that feared the law or
displeasure of her husband: for as Ovid says, She gave that did not give
because she could not.
Not undeservedly is she numbered amongst the dishonored women that rather
consecrateth her honesty to fear, then to the respect of her own self: In
like manner he that has given a benefit to the intent he might receive a
requital, has not given it. Shall we say that we do good unto beasts, when
we fatten them for our service, or nourish them to yield us food? That we do
good to our fruit trees, or the Gardens, wherein they grow; when we dig
about them, least through dryness or hardness of the earth (if they were not
well looked unto, or timely, and oft-times removed) they should grow barren and
withered? no man manureth his fields for this cause only; because to labor is
a thing good in it self: nor does any other business, without hope of
interest or gain. A covetous thought, and addicted to gain, will never breed
in us a desire to do good: but a humane and liberal heart, which after it
has given any thing, desires still to give more, and redouble new courtesies
upon the old: a heart that thinks not what profit shall arise to him that
gives: for otherwise it is a base contemptible and abject matter to do good
unto an other, for a man's particular interest and profit: what magnificence is
it for a man to love himself? to think on nothing but his own thrift? to
travail no ways but for himself? But the true desire of doing good unto an
other, withdraws us from all this; and laying hold on us, draws us to our
loss, and disdayning our particular good, highly rejoices in the act of
well-doing only.

CHAP. XV.
CAn it be doubted, but that injury is contrary to a benefit? Like as to do
an injury is a thing to be esteemed and shunned of it self; even so to do
good is a thing to be coueted for it self. In the one the fear of dishonor
has more power over us, then all the recompenses that may move us to do any
thing that is evil: and in the other the appearance of honesty, which has
great power and effic^cie of it self, sufficiently inuiteth us. I shall not
lie if I say that there is not any one but loves his own, and that there is
not any man of so mortified a will, that conceiueth not a great contentment, to
see him whom he has oft-times pleasured, and has not a desire to further him
farther, because he has done for him once before. Which thing could never
come to pass, except we naturally took pleasure in our goods deeds. How
oftentimes may thou hear some say. I cannot abandon him whose life I have
saved, and whom I have already drawn out of danger? he beseeches me to
maintain his cause against his adversaries, who have great favor and
authority: I will not: but what shall I then do? See you not how in this
case, there is a certain peculiar virtue and power that constrains us to
succor him, and further to do him this good in his utmost necessity; first,
because it behooves us to do it; secondly, because before times we have done
him the like pleasure? And although at the beginning we had no reason to
succor him, yet at this time we will assist him, because we have already done
it at another time. So far is it that profit should impell us to do a
pleasure, that contrariwise we persevere to maintain and nourish those things
that are vnpro^itable, and conserve them for the only love we bear to our own
benefits. And if we have been unhappy in doing pleasure to any one yet is
there as great reason to pardon him, as to forgive our graceless children.

CHAP. XVI.
THese Epicures confess that they themselves do yield thanks, not for that it
is honest so to do, but because it is profitable, yet with little labor we
may easily approve that it is far otherwise. For by these very arguments,
whereby we proue^ that to give benefits is a thing to be desired in it self; by
the same also we shall gather and conclude this: That it is a thing most
assured, and from whence we gather all our proofs for all this dispute, that
we prise not honesty, but only because it is honest. Who therefore dare draw
it into question, that to remunerate a courtesy is not an honest thing? who is
h^e that detesteth not an ungrateful man, who is only unprofitable to
himself? But what will thou say of him (when thou hear it reported) who is
ungrateful and unthankful to his friend for his many and mighty benefits?
how will thou endure him, and interpret it, whether he have played an dishonest
part in so doing, or that he has dealt fondly, in omitting that which was for
his commodity and profit? I think thou will account him a wicked man, and
imagine that he rather deserves some punishment, then needs an ouer^seer to
order his estate to his profit. Which thing should not fall out so, unless
honesty were a thing both honest and to be desired of it self. Other things
perhaps have not their excellence and dignity so apparent, and have need of
an interpreter to express whether they be honest or no. But this is so
apparent and so beautiful, that it can not be doubted, but that the clearness
thereof will shine very brightly. What thing is so laudable, what so equally
entertained and allowed in all mo^s judgments, as to be thankful for benefits?

CHAP. XVII.
TEll me what cause induces us hereunto? Is it gain? It is impossible, for he
that despises not the same is ungrateful. Is it ambition? It cannot be, An
ungrateful man neither fears nor owes.
because to repay that which a man owes, is no matter of glory, or occasion
to bring it. Is it fear? The ungrateful man has none, and therefore the
Commonweal prefixeth no laws for giving thanks, because that nature has
sufficiently commanded us, and enjoined us to be grateful. As also there is no
law that binds us to love our parents, nor to tender and cherish children. It
should be but lost labor to constrain us, to do that whereunto nature
sommoneth us of herself. And like as no man needs to be incited to self
love, because he has it by kind: so is no man to be exhorted to follow
honest things or himself, virtue is so pleasing and gracious of her own
nature^ that the wickedder sort also have a certain instinct to approve the
better. Who is he that would not seem to be bountiful? who is he that
desires not to be accounted good, even when he does most wickedness and
wrong? and when he has most exercised his tyranny and cruelty, would not
shadow the same under some surface of iustice^, that strives not also to make
men think that he has done good unto those whom he has most of all offended?
And therefore they suffer themselves to be entertained at their hands, whom
they have most of all afflicted, and feign themselves to be good and liberal,
because they cannot approve themselves such: which they would not do, except
the love of honesty, which is to be desired for it self, compelled them to
seek a contrary reputation to their corrupt manners, and to conceal and
cloak their wickedness, the fruit whereof is desired, but the thing it self
is shameful and odious to them: neither is there any man so far estranged
and sequestered from the law of nature, and degenerated from manhood, that would
be naught for his minds sake only. Ask any of these Gallants that live by
rapine and spoil, if they had not rather get their goods by any honest means,
then by robbing and stealing? He that inricheth himse^fe by spoiling and
killing passengers, will rather wish to find those things he has purchased,
then take them by force; you shall find no man but had rather enjoy the fruits
of his wickedness, without performing the wickedness it self: we have this
great benefit at natures hands, that virtue permits each man^ mind to be
illuminated with her beams; and they which follow her not, have a full view of
her.

CHAP. XVIII.
ANd to let thee know, that the affection of a grateful mind is to be desired
for it self, it is certain that ingratitude ought to be fled and eschewed in
it self. Because there is nothing that so much dismembreth and dissipateth
men's friendship, as this vice. For in what other thing are we secure but in
this, that we are helped by mutual offices, and interchangeable friendships?
by this one and only commerce of benefits our life is not only assured, but
better defended against all sudden incursions. Single us alone, what are we?
but a pray and sacrifice for ravenous beasts, neither is there any blood more
vile or easier to be spilt: for other beasts have sufficient force to maintain
and defend themselves. Whatsoever beasts are bred to wander up and down, and
to lead a solitary and separated life, are armed, weakness girteth in and
gauleth man on every side: the force of his nails, the sharpness of his teeth
has not made him terrible to the rest, being naked and inform: society
assures and defenceth him. Two things has she given him, to wit, reason and
society, which make him, (although he be exposed to all other dangers) most
powerful and puissant. And thus he, that being alone and separated, was the
least and feeblest to all the rest, is become the Master of all things.
Society gave him the dominion over all living creatures, Society whereas he
was borne for the Land, has transmitted him into a sovereignty of an other
nature, and made him Lord of the Sea likewise. Society has repressed the
violence of infirmities, puruaied succors and assistance for old age, and
given comfort against sorrow. She it is that gives us forces, and animateth
us to resist fortune. Take Society away, and thou shall extinguish and cut off
the unity of mankind, whereby life is sustained. But you take it away, if you
bring to pass that a thankelesse mind is not to be esteemed for it self: but
because that he ought to fear, least a greater mischief befall him. For how
many ungrateful men are they, that may be ungrateful without punishment. To
conclude, I call him ungrateful whosoever is grateful for fear.

CHAP. XIX.
NO man of sound understanding has ever feared the Gods, It is not in^e^ded
that the just man has no fear of God, if ^eare be taken for one of the seven
gifts of the holy Ghost: but this place is to be understood that love, which
is not co^patible with that love wherewith good men love God, but with him is a
servile ^eare, which is not of children, but of slaves.
for it is a madness to fear these, from whom we receive all our good and
happiness, neither does any man love those whom he fears. Finally, thou
Epicure, thou have disarmed God, thou have dispoiled him of his arms and
power, and least he should be (...) by any man, thou have turned him out of the
world. Being then after this manner begirt and environed with a strong and
impregnable wall, separated and retired out of the sight, and touch of mortal
men, thou ought to have no fear of him, because he has no means to do
either good or evil. But remaining alone betwixt the space and distance, which
is between one Heaven and another, abandoned of all company of creatures and
men, disfurnished of all things, he is out of danger of the ruins of the
world, which he sees fall above him, and about him, not making any reckoning
of our vows and prayers, neither having any care of us. And yet such as he is,
thy desire is that we should think that thou worshippest him, and that thou
owe him as much reverence, as thou do to thy father. All which thou do,
in my judgment, to this end only, that thou mighst not be accounted
ungrateful: Or if thou do it not to this end, if thou will not have us
suppose that thou art thankful, because thou think that thou have received
no benefit at his hands, and that happily thy little Atoms and mites, which
thou have fantastically coined in thy brain, have rashly and vnsurely formed
and fashioned thee such as thou art, why do thou worship him? It is (thou will answer) for the excellency of his great Majesty, and for his wondrous
nature; I put the case that this be thus, at leastwise thou do it without
hope of any good, and without any persuasion or appearance of profit. There is
therefore somewhat that is to be desired for it self, the dignity whereof
inuiteth and draws thee to love the same, and truly, that is, honesty. For
what is more honest then to be grateful? the matter of this virtue extends
it self as far as our life.

CHAP. XX.
But in this good, says he, there is some profit likewise: for in what virtue
is it not? But that is said to be desired for it self, which although it have
some commodities without it self, is notwithstanding well pleasing and
acceptable, even when those commodities be removed and taken away. It is
profitable for me to be thankful, yet will I be thankful although it be
to my harm: what seeks he that is thankful? Is it to the end that his
acknowledgement may get him new friends, and more benefits? what if in so doing
he should purchase other men's displeasure? if a man be assured that he shall
gain nothing in restoring the good which he has received, but contrariwise
that he shall love much of that he has already gotten, and hoarded up in his
cosfers; would he willingly light upon this los^e? undoubtedly, that man is
ungrateful that fixes the eye of his desire upon a second good turn, when
he satisfi^th the first, hoping to make profit of that pleasure, whereof he
acquiteth himself. I call him ungrateful that sits by a sick man, and
continually attends by him, because he is to make his last will and
testament, or has so much leisure as to think of any inheritance or legacy.
Although he do all things which a good friend (or such a one as is mindful of
his duty) ought to do, if he conceive in himself any int^ressable hope, he
lays a snare, or as a fisherman armeth his bait, if he expect and linger
after the death of the party, and houer about his c^rkasse like carrion crows,
which stand spying near at hand for the fall of some cattle by the rot, he
will give an occasion for each man to think, that he does but expect the death
of his good friend, and does but houer and haunt about his person. A thankful
heart conceiueth no pleasure, but in the only virtue of his good intent.

CHAP. XXI.
Will thou know that this is true, and that a thankful man is not corrupted by
profit? there are two sorts of thankful men. He is said to be thankful, that
makes satisfaction in some sort for that he has received. This man
peradventure may vaunt himself, he has somewhat whereof to boast, and to
speak of. He likewise is called thankful, that has received a benefit with a
good mind, and owes it with as good. This man hides himself in his own
conscience: but what profit may he reap of an affection so deeply hidden? But
that other man, although he wants means to do more, yet is he thankful: he
loves, he owes, he desires to yield satisfaction, what ask you more? he is
not wanting to himself. A workman is a workman, although he want his tools
to exercise his Art; and a cunning Musician is a Musician, although his very
voice cannot be heard for muttering and noise that is made about him. I will
give thanks for the good that is done me: after this there remains something
for me to do, not that I may be thankful, but really acquit of my obligation.
For oftentimes he that recompenceth is not thankful, and contrariwise, many
that do it not, The mind and intent crowns the action.
are thankful. For as of all other virtues, so the whole estimation of this
has re^erence to the mind, if she be obseruant of that which concerns her,
whatsoever otherwise is deficient, is the error of Fortune. Even as a man
cease not to be eloquent, although he be silent, nor strong, although his
hands be bound and fettered, neither a good Pilate, although he be upon the
firm land, because he wants no perfection in his science, although there be
some impediment that lets them from using the same. Even so also is he
thankful, that has only a will to be thankful, and has no other witness
of his willingness, but himself. Nay I will say thus much more, sometimes
even he is thankful, which seems unthankful, and whom misdeeming opinion
traduceth for the contrary. A good conscience contemns oppression being
erect and con^irmed in it self.
Wherein then reposeth this man his trust, but in his conscience, which
rejoices in it self, although it be oppressed, which reclaimeth and
gain-sayeth all that eloquence can urge, or favor detract: and reposeth all
things in her self? And though she sees never so huge a multitude of men that
reprove her intentions, she makes no reckoning of the contrary opinions, but
thinks to justify her self in her own secret judgment. And albeit she
perceive, that her faithfulness bear the punishment of perfidiousnes, yet she
abateth no whit of her courage, neither is abashed thereat, but stands still
aloft, above her punishment.

CHAP. XXII.
I Have (says he) that which I would, and that which I desired: I have not as
yet repented me, neither will I ever repent my s^lf^^ neither shall Fortune
(how adverse soever she be) (...) this pusillanimitie, as to make me say^ What
is that I intended? where^^ has my good will now profited me^ It profitteth me
when I am on the rack^: it profitteth me being in the midst of the fire,
which if it should be applied to every member of my body, and by little and
little should en^^rone and devour the same on every side, although my body
(fraugh^^d with a good conscience) should be put into a fl^ming fire, and
tortured and burned therein, yet would the fire be pleasing to me, because
through it my spotless ^aith would shine and appear. I will now once more
reinforce that argument which I have used in times past. Why is it, that when
we die we are desirous to be grateful? Why examine we every particular man's
deserts? Why endeavor we to refresh the memory of all our life past, to this
intent, that we might seem to be forgetful of no man's kindness. At that time
there remains nothing for hope to linger upon, and yet standing at the pits
brim, our desire is to depart this world, to every man's satisfaction. The
reason is, because the proper act of thanksgiving draws with it a most great
reward of it self, and the force of virtue is very great, to draw men's hearts
unto it, and the beauty of honesty so enuironeth and surpriseth men's minds,
that it rauisheth them with the admiration of the light and brightness
thereof, yea many commodities ensue thereby. For the life of such as are honest
is more secured and innocent; which is accompanied with a thankful soul, and
out of fear. Nature had dealt unjustly with v^, if she had made us partakers
of so great a benefit, with misery, danger, and uncertainty. But, Innocence
in danger is confident, in prosperity mild, in all encounters happy.
consider I pray you, although thou might easily, and without danger attain
very often to this virtue by an assured and easy way, whether thou could
not find in thy heart to make thy way thereunto, by inaccessible rocks,
through stony ways, full of Serpents and savage beasts.

CHAP. XXIII.
YEt ought we not to say, that a thing should not be desired for the love of it
self, because it is accompanied with some foreign profit that attends it.
For we see almost daily, that the fairest things are accompanied with
accessory endowments, but yet so as they draw these commodities after them, and
they themselves go before. May it be doubted, but that the course and circular
motion of Sun and Moon, do temperate this dwelling place of mankind by
their diverse changes? Or that by the heat of the Sun, all bodies are
cherished, the earth is relaxed and opened, superfluous moistures abated, and
the irkesomenes of Winter that binds all things allayed, or that by the
effectual and piercing warmth of the Moon the ripening fruits are moistened?
Or that the fruitfulnes of man is answerable and correspondent to her course:
or that the Sun by his proper motion makes the year discerneable and the
Moon by her circumuolution in shorter space makes the month. But admit you
take these virtues from the Moon, were not the Sun of it self worthy to be
beheld and admired in our sight, though he did but swiftly pass before our
eyes. Were not the Moon to be admired by us, although she ran by us but as
an idle Star? When the heaven by night time darteth out his lights, when we
behold such an infinity of Stars shine upon us, Admiration of these things
accompanied with devotion, what admirable ^ffects w^rke they in the Soul?
who is he that is not ravished to behold them? Who is he that seeing himself
to be surprised by so great a wonder, has leisure at that time to think on
the good and profit that they bring? Behold, those Stars that glide aloft in
the still firmament, after what sort hide they their swiftness, under an
appearance of a standing and immooueable work? How much is done this night,
which thou obseruest only for a reckoning and difference from the days? What
a troop of things are unfolded under this silence? What an order of destinies
does this certain bound bring forth? These things which thou beholdest no
otherwise, but as matters dispersed for beautifying, are every one of them
occupied in working. For thou can not imagine that the seven Planets only
have their designed motions, and the rest stand fixed, will comprehend the
motion of very few. But there is an infinite number of A Stoicall error, who
ascribe Deity to the Stars.
gods, which are far severed and withdrawn from our sight, which both go
and come. And of those which are subject to our sight there are diverse, that
have obscure motions and hidden courses. What then should thou not be
strooken with admiration to behold so huge a work, yea though it ruled thee
not, preserved thee not, cherished thee not, ingendered thee not by his winds,
and moystned thee not by the air?

CHAP. XXIIII.
NOw, even as these things, although they have their first and principal uses,
and are both necessary and profitable for our life yet it is the maiesti^ of
them that occupies the whole mind. Even so all virtue (and especially the
virtue of gratefulness) yields very much profit, yet will it not be loved
for the same; for it has yet a further thing in it, neither is it sufficiently
understood by him, which accounts it amongst gainefull things. Is a man
thankful because it concerns his own profit? Ergo, also he is thankful,
but for so much as implies his profit. Virtue entertaineth not a covetous and
base minded Lover, she will be courted with open hands and a liberal heart.
The ungrateful man thinks thus: I would feign requite the courtesy I have
received, but I fear the charge and expense, I fear the peril, I am affraide
of displeasure, I will rather do that which is more profitable and secure for
me. One and the same cause and reason, cannot make a man thankful, and
ungrateful: as their actions are diverse, so their intentions are different.
The one is ungrateful although it behooves him not, because it is for his
profit, the other is grateful although it be against his profit, because he
ought so to be.

CHAP. XXV.
We are resolved to live conformable and agreeable to nature, and to follow
the example of the gods. But in all that whatsoever the gods do, they follow
nothing else, but the reason of doing that they do, except hapily thou
imaginest, that they receive the fruit of their labors out of the smoke of
i^^railes, and the odor of the incense which is consumed in their sacrifices.
Consider how great things they atchiue and compass daily, with what abundant
fruits they replenish the earth, with how seasonable and favorable winds
(fitly serving to convey us into all foreign Coasts) turn they and move they
the Seas, with how many and sudd^n showers mollify they and moysten they the
earth, and replenish the dried veins and fountains, and renew them by
infusing nutriment, by the hidden and secret Spring-heads. All these things do
they without any recompense, and without any profit that may accrue unto them.
This example also ought our reason to observe (if it disagree not from this
pattern and president) lest it follow honest things, as if hired and engaged.
Let us be ashamed to sell the least courtesy that we do. The Gods expect no
recompense for that they do. If thou will imitate the Gods (says he) thou
must pleasure even those that are unthankful: for the Sun rises upon the
wicked, and Pirates have the sea open unto them.

CHAP. XXVI.
IN this place they demand whether a good man may employ his benefits on an
unthankful man, knowing him to be such a one? Give me leave to speak somewhat
by the way, lest I be entangled with a doubtful question. There are, according
to the opinion of the Stoics, What a burden has iniquity on his back?
two sorts of ungrateful men. The one ungrateful, because he is a fool, and
wants judgment; but he that is a fool, is consequently evil, and an evil
man is replenished with all kinds of vices, and therefore is ungrateful. In
like manner we term evil men intemperate and dissolute, covetous, prodigal,
and malicious, not that these great and notorious vices are incident to every
evil man, but because they may be, and are in them, though undiscovered. The
other is ungrateful, which in all men's judgment and voices is termed so; and
for that by nature he is prone and inclined thereunto. To that ungrateful man,
that so is not free from this vice, as he is free from no vice, a good man may
do a courtesy and kindness: for should he but reject those of this
condition, he should do good unto no man? But unto this ungrateful man, which
is a defrauder of benefits, who naturally has his heart addicted to
ingratitude, he shall no more give a benefit, then to trust his money to a
banquerout, or leave a pledge in his hands, who has heretofore defrauded many
others of their right. We call him coward who is a fool; for this follows
those wicked persons, The description of a Coward.
who are indifferently seized of all kinds of vices: but properly we account
and call him a coward, who naturally is affrighted with the the least trifling
noice he hears. So a fool has all vices, but is not naturally wicked unto
all: one is subject to avarice, the other to prodigality and outrageous
expenses, the other to shameless petulancy and wantonness.

CHAP. XXVII.
THey then are deceived, who question with the Stoickes after this manner. For
he was called Aristides Iustus.
What then, is Achilles a coward? What then, is Aristides (to whom Justice gave
his name) unjust? What then, is Fabius (who by cunctations and delay, restored
his decaying Commonweal) rash? What then, fears Decius death? is Mutius a
traitor? is Camillus a forsaken? Noe, we intend no such matter; neither say we
that all sorts of vices are so inseparably united in all men, as in some there
are particular faults, and they more eminent. But this we say, that a foolish
and wicked man is subject and inclined to all vices, in so much as we acquit
not the bold man of fear, nor discharge the prodigal man of niggardize. Even
as man is naturally endowed with all his five senses, An apt similitude.
and yet all men are not so quick-sighted as Linceus: so he that is a fool
has not all vices, so vehement and disordinate as some of them, have some
vices. All vices are in all men; yet are not all of them eminent in every man.
Nature impelleth one man unto covetousness, this man to lust, that man she
addicteth to wine, or if not as yet addicted, yet is he so formed, that his
disposition draws him thereunto. For this cause (that I may return unto my
purpose) I say that there is no man that is not stained with ingratitude, and
that is evil: for he has all the seeds of wickedness in him, yet properly
he is called ungrateful, who is more inclined to that vice. On such a one
therefore will I bestow no benefit. For like as he has very little care of
his daughter, that marieth her to a contumelious and often-diuorced husband:
and as he is esteemed an ill husband and householder, who prefers to the
stewardship of his house, and government of his patrimony to one already
condemned for ill managing his masters business. And as he commits a great
folly, and makes a mad will, that leaves such a one Tutor and governor of
his heir, that has been a spoiler, an overthrow of innocent Orphelins. So
shall he be reputed to bestow his courtesies very inconsiderately, who makes
his choice of ungrateful men, on whom he may bestow that which is sure will
be lost.

CHAP. XXVIII.
THe Gods also (says he) give many things to ungrateful men: but these, had
they prepared for the good, yet befall they the evil also, because they cannot
be separated. And more reason is it to profit the evil for the goods sake,
then to abandon the good for the evils sake. So those things thou speak of
the day, the Sun, the intercourse of Winter and Summer, the temperate sweetenes
of the Spring and Autumn, the raines, the water-springs, and the ordinary
blasts of winds, were devised by the Gods for all men in general, they could
not sever and separate them, only for those they intended good to. The King
gives honors to those that are worthy, but he oftentimes yeelde^h public
larges, and presents of victuals to those that deserve it not. The thief, the
perjured man, the adulterer (provided always that he be a Citizen) received
the public larges of wheat, which is monthly given to the people of Rome,
without respect of his manners, when there is any thing that is to be bestowed
simply, as upon a Courtizen, and not upon a good Citizen, both the good and bad
receive the same indifferently. God likewise has given some things in general
to all mankind, from whence no man is excluded. For it could not be, that the
winds should be favorable to the good, and contrary to the wicked. It was the
good and profit of all nations, that the seas were open and nauigable, for the
good of the merchants traffic, and to extend the Kingdom of mankind. Neither
could there a law be prefixed to the rain, that it should not as well water
and ouerflow the lands of the wicked and unjust. There are certain things
which are common, both to the one, and to the other. Cities are built, as well
to entertain the good, as the evil: the monuments of learned men's wits are
published and vented abroad, to be read as well to the reprobate, as the
virtuous. Medicine ministers help even to the most debauched. No man ever
concealed the composition of wholesome medicines, for fear lest the unworthy
should be healed. Seek thou a strict account and valuation of persons, in
those things which are given severally unto a man, as a man worthy, and not in
these things which confusedly admit the common sort. For there is a great
difference betwixt choosing a man, and not repulsing him. The law is open to all
men, the murderers themselves envy the peace, and they which have stolen
another man's goods, recover their own. Such as are quarrellers, and ready to
strike any man in time of peace, are defended from the enemy with a wall in
time of war. Those that have most oftentimes offended the laws, are
maintained and conserved with all assurance, under the authority thereof. In
brief there are some, though of that nature, that they could not be applied to
some persons in particular, except they were granted unto all in common. There
is no cause therefore, why thou should dispute of these things, whereunto we
are publicly induced. That which in my choice and judgment I would give to
any virtuous man, I will carefully provide that I cast it not away on such a
one, whom I know to be ungrateful.

CHAP. XXIX.
Will thou not then (says he) give counsel to an ungrateful man, who would
take thine advice in his affairs: nor permit him to draw water out of thy
fountains: nor show him the way if he be out of it? or would thou do these
things for an ungrateful man, yet refuse him afterward all other sorts of
good? I will distinguish in this point, or at leastwise I will end^uour to
distinguish the same. A benefit is a profitable work, T^^ difference between
a profitable work and a benefit.
but every profitable work is not a benefit. For some things are of so small
moment, that they deserve not the name of a benefit. Two things must concur
in making of a benefit. First, the greatness of the thing, for some things
there are, that undergo the measure of this name: who ever accounted it a
benefit, to have given a shiue of bread, or a piece of bare money, or to have
permitted a neighbor to enter and kindle fire in his house^ And yet sometimes
these things do a man more pleasure then far greater: but the b^senes of them
diminishes their reputation, even then, when the necessiti^ of the time makes
them needful. Again, we ought to consider that which is principal and of
greatest force: which is first of all, that I do it for love of that person, to
whom I would give my benefit, and whom I account worthy to rec^iue the same.
Finally, that I do it with a good will^ and that I feel^ in my self a great
joy and pleasure that I do it. Of which points there are none at all in these
things that we speak of; for we bestow them not as upon worthy men, but
carelessely as small things, and we give it not unto the man, but unto
humanity.

CHAP. XXX.
I Deny not but that sometimes I may bestow some things on those that are
unworthy for other men's sakes. As oft-times in the pursuit of honors and
dignities, the ancient Nobility of houses has been the cause, that those men
were preferred, who were unprofitable, and of base estimation, before those
that were learned and of good spirits. Honor enkind^^th good spirits, and
makes labor pleasing.
Not without cause is the memory of great virtues sacred; and many men affect
goodness with greater delight, when they perceive that the honor of good men
dies not with them. What merit made Ciceroes son Consul, but the memory of
his father? What thing is it that caused Cinna of late (returning from the
Enemies camp) to be honored with the Consulship? why was Sextus Pompey, This
Sextus Pompey was the Son of Sextus Pompeius, who was Consul the year 1218.
and the rest, that have borne the name of the Pompeis, preferred in the like
manner, but for the excellency and virtue of one only man, whose greatness
was so great, that his ruin and death could raise so many of his posterity,
to so worthy estimation? What made Fabius Persicus lately (that was so hateful
in the most abi^ctest men's eyes, that they disdayn'd to kiss him) attain unto
the Priesthood of so many Colleges, but only the same of the Verrucosians and
Allobrogicks, These were of the Fabian Family.
and of those three hundred, that opposed one family against the intrusion of
their enemies in their Countries defense? So much ar^ we indebted unto virtues,
that we ought to respect them, not only while they be present, but also when
they are most distant and out of sight. Even as those virtues wrought this
effect, that they profited not only one age, but left their benefits behind
them to all ages: so let us not be grateful to one age only. This man has
begotten noble children, he is then worthy of good turns whatsoever he
himself is, because he has brought forth such. Another is borne of noble
Ancestors, whatsoever he himself is, let him be shrouded under the shadow of
his Ancestors. Like as obscure and unclean places are lightened by the
repercussion of the Sunne-beames, It is some part of happiness to be borne of
good parents.
so let idle and unworthy men be illustrated by the light of their forefathers.

CHAP. XXXI.
IN this place, my Liberalis, I intend to excuse the gods. For sometimes we
are wont to say, Whereat aimed the providence of the gods, when they committed
the government of a Kingdom to Alexanders Brother.
Aridaeus hands? Think thou it was given him? It befell him for his fathers
and his brothers sake. Why gave she the Empire of the whole world to Caius
Caligula, a man so insatiate of man's blood, that he commanded the same to be
shed before his eyes, as if he had a desire to drink and devour it with his
mouth? What, think thou, that this greatness was given him for his own
merit? No, it was given to his father Germanicus; it was for his grandfathers,
and great grandfathers sake, and to others no less famous men their
pred^cessors, although they led a private and ordinary life. What, when thou
made Scaurus Mamercus Consul, did thou not know, that he received with
open mouth the monthly excrements of his unchaste chamber-maids? For did he
dissemble? Would he seem to be pure? I will relate unto thee a speech of his
own, which was ordinary in every man's mouth in my remembrance, and was
commended in his own presence: Asinius Pollio being on a time laid upon his
bed ^he said unto him (but with words unworthy to be named) that he would do
that unto him, which he had rather suffer himself. And seeing that Pollio was
displeased therewith, and that he began to ^^nd his brows. If I (...) spoken
any evil (s^id he) I (...) upon me and on my head. This speech is objected,
not to Liberalis, but to providence.
This saying of his ^e himself bla^ed (...) thou admitted a man so openly
shameless and im^udent to the Mac^^ (...)bunal of Consuls? Verily when thou
b^though^^^ thee of that old (...), the Prince or prime man of the S^nate in
times pa^^s ^hou could^^ not suffer his race and posteri^ie to be ab^sed or
extinguished.

CHAP. XXXII.
Easy it is for us to percol^e how the godd^s deal^ more ^auour^bly with some
for the merits and deserts of their fat^^r^, and predecessors, and with other
some for the towardness that shall be in their children, and childrens
children^ and in those that hereafter shall descend from their post^ritie. For
they know the successiue order of their works, and they hau^ an infallible
science of all those things which are to pass through their hands, although
they are f^rre remo^^ from our knowledge and understanding. All these reasons
he urges in the person of God.
The things that we suppose to be casual and sudden, are foreseen and
familiar to them. Le^ these be Kings (s^y they) because their ancestors have
not been, but imagined it to be a true Kingdom, to be just and abstinent. And
because they have not used the commonweal for their profits, but dedicated
their persons to the service and increase thereof. Let these men reign because
some good man was their great grandfather, whose mind was greater then his
fortune, who in civil discentions chose rather to be vanquished, then to
vanquish; because it stood with the profit of the Commonwealth. His goodness
could not be requited all this whil^^ In respect of that man, let this man have
pr^h^minence over others, no^ because ^e is of knowledge and ability how to use
it, but because the other has deserved ^t for him: for peradventure this man
is in body mis^apen, in count^^ance lo^thsom, and will be a slander to the
place and persons of his advancement. From hence, to the end of the Chapter all
is disioynted.
Now will men find fault with me, and say, that I am blind, and rash, and
ignorant where to bestow the things that are due to the chiefest and
excellentest persons. But I know that the giving of this thing to the one, is a
satisfaction of it to the other, to whom it was due long since. Whereby do
they know such a certain man, who was such a contemner of glory, when it
followed him, that he a^uentured upon peril with the same countenance that
others escape it, and that never made difference betwixt his own profit and
the profit of the Commonwealth? Where is this man? who is he? how know you
him? Th^se ^^^konings of such receipts and payments are stricken out of my
bookes^ I know what and to whom I owe. To some I make payment after long time,
to other some I give aforehand, or else I deal with them according as occasion
and the vtility of my commonwealth requires.

CHAP. XXXIII.
SOme things I will then give to an ungrateful man, yet will I not give it for
his own sake. But if (says he) thou know not whether he be thankful or
ungrateful; will thou expect until thou know the same? or will thou not lose
the opportunity of giving the benefit? It is too long to expect: for (as Plato
says) it is hard to conjecture what a man's mind is, and not to exspect is
rashness. To him we will answer, that we will never expect a certain
comprehension and knowledge of things, because it is a difficult matter to
find out the truth; but that we follow that way whereunto the similitude of
truth leads us. All men's offices and actions proceed this way; under this
hope we sow our lands: thus ^aile we, thus undertake we war, thus marry we,
thus bring we up our children; whereas the event of all these is uncertain. To
those things address we our enterprises, whereof we believe that we may hope
the best. For who can warrant a rich harvest to him that sows, a safe Port to
him that saileth, victory to him that warreth, a modest wife to him that
marries, toward children to him that begat them? We follow those things
whereunto reason induces us, not those whereunto truth draws us. If thou
expectest to do nothing except thou be secured of the good success, if thou
lingerest until such time as thou have found out the truth, thy life will
become unprofitable and idle, neither shall thou ever dare or attempt any
thing: whilst the appearance of truth impelleth me to do this or that, I will
not fear to give a benefit to him, who in my opinion and in all likelihood,
will approve himself thankful.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
Many things may chance (says he) whereby we may take a bad man to be good, a
good man to be bad, because the appearances of things whereunto we give credit
do oftentimes deceive us. Who denies this? But I find nothing else, by which I
should govern my thoughts. By these footsteps must I pursue the truth; more
assured I have none. This will I endeauo^r to examine with all diligence,
neither will I assent unto them over quickly. For so may it fall out in war,
that being deceived by some false appearance, I may aim mine arrow against my
fellow Soldier, leaving mine enemy untouched and in safety, but this both
seldom times falls out, and not by mine error: whose purpose was to wound
mine enemy, and defend my fellow Citizen. If I know him to be ungrateful I
will give him no benefit. But he cosened me, he deceived me; here is no fault
of him that gives, for I gave it as to a thankful man. But if (says he)
thou have promised to do a man a pleasure, and afterward thou find him to
be ungrateful, will thou give it or no? if thou do it thou offendest
willingly, for thou give to him, thou ought not to give: if thou deniest,
in this case likewise thou offendest, because thou performest not that which
thou have firmly promised. Sapientis est mutare consiliu^.
Your sect in this place staggereth and trippeth, and that proud promise of
theirs, that a wise man never repents himself of that which he has done;
neither ever reformeth his actions, nor changes his counsel, begins to be
shaken. A wiseman changes not his counsel, as long as the cause and
circumstances continue the same, as they were when he determined. And therefore
never repents he himself in any thing, because nothing could be better done
at that time then was done, nor nothing better ordered then that which was
ordered. Finally, all things he undertakes, he attempteth them with this
condition, if nothing fall out that may interrupt his sage designe^. And
therefore say we, that all things befall him to his wish, that nothing has
be^^^ed him contrary to his expectation, because he presumes in his mind,
that sundry things may fall out which may cross his purpose. Fools are they,
that are too confident, and who promise unto themselves over peremptorily, that
Fortune will favor them, but a wise man considers her both waye^ he know^th
very well what sway error bears, how uncertain worldly things be, and how
many things hinder men's determinations: he follows variable Fortune, and the
hazards of humane affairs, with an uncertain and doubtful hope, expecting
with assured counsel the uncertain ends thereof. But the conditions, without
which he begins and enterpriseth nothing, warrantise him sufficiently herein.

CHAP. XXXV.
I Have promised to do a pleasure, except there fall out some occasion whereby
I am let from giving that I intended^ but what if the Commonweal command
me to give that unto her which I have promised my friend, if a public law be
made that no man shall do that which I have promised my friend to perform. I
have past my word to give thee my Daughter in marriage, and afterward thou art
convicted to be a forrainer, with whom we are forbidden to contract
matrimony. The law that prohibiteth, that, defends also my cause: then shall
I break my word, then shall I be justly taxed with inconstancy; if all the
circumstances continuing as they were when I promised, I neglect to perform
the same: Because otherwise whatsoever thing is changed, gives me liberty to
determine anew, and discharges me of my former obligation. I have promised to
plead thy cause, and afterward I find that the prosecution ther^of will in
the end redound to my fathers prejudice. The law of bounty is limited by
circumstances.
I have promised thee to take ^ long journey with thee, but afterward upon
better instructions, I understand that the way is dangerous and full of
thiefes, I intended presently to come and visit thee about thine instant
business, but my child's sickness, or my wifes falling in labor, kept me at
home. All things ought to be in the same estate, they were, when I promised
thee, if thou will that my faith be obliged unto thee. But what greater change
may there happen then if hereafter I am informed that thou art an ungrateful
and wicked man? That which I gave thee, as to a worthy man, I will refuse thee
as a man unworthy, and further more I shall have a just cause to be angry with
thee, because thou have deceived me.

CHAP. XXXVI.
YEt will I nearely examine the greatness of that I have promised. The value
of the thing, which I have promised to bestow, shall give me counsel. If it
be a small matter, I will give it; not because he is worthy, but because I
have promised. Neither will I give it as a benefit, but only to redeem my
word, and hereafter will I take better heed, and by my loss I will chastise
my rashness in promising; and to the end I may have a more feeling and
sensible apprehension of the same, and henceforward be more circumspect in that
I speak, I will, (as the common proverb says) pay a fine for my tongue. But
if it be a thing of greater price, I would not, (as Mece^as says) spend two
hundredth and fifty thousand crowns, to buy mine own blame: I will diligently
compare both these things between themselves. It is something to keep a man's
word when he has promised, and again it imports very much to take care
that we give to such a one as deserves the same: yet must we consider how
great our promise is: If it be a thing of small value, I will give it as though
I winked thereat. But if it may be either greatly to my loss, or greatly to my
shame. I had rather excuse my self once for not doing it, then condemn my
self always for giving it. In brief, all the weight of the matter consists
(as I say) in this to know of what value and estimate the promise is that I
have made. For I will not only retain that which I have rashly promised, but I
will redemand also that which I have given amiss. He is out of his wits, that
binds his faith for an error.

CHAP. XXXVII.
PHILIP of Macedon had a valiant and brave Soldier, who had faithfully served
him in all his wars, to whom in remuneration of his virtue, he had
oftentimes given a good part of that which he had taken from the enemy, and
encouraged him with rewards, he being a man of a mercinarie mind. It fortuned
that this Soldier was shipwrackt and cast away at Sea, and that the tempest
and billows cast him on the shore near to a certain Macedonians dwelling
place, who being advertised of this his fortune, ran unto him, and recovered
him to life, being well-nigh dead. He carried him unto his own house, he lodged
him in his own bed: he entertained this forlorn man so carefully and
kindly, that he recovered his forces, he maintained him thirty days at his
own charge, he relieved his necessity, and gave him money and means to
bring him back again to the army. This Soldier, upon his departure, told him
this very often; If I ever chance to see my Prince again, I will requite this
thy kind entertainment. Certain days after being arrived at the camp, he
failed not to tell Philip of his unhappy shipwreck, but he concealed who had
succored him, and forthw^^h besought him to give him a certain man's lands,
and this was his heritage who had so graciously entertained him, and with so
much care and diligence had preserved him from death. You may see (by the way)
how Kings now and then, (but especially in war) give many things, their eyes
being shut: no one man alone is able to satisfy so many armed desires; there
is not any man that at one time can be a good man, and a good General. How
shall so many thousands of insatiable men be satisfied? what shall they have
if every man may keep his own? This said Philip to himself, when he
commanded him to be put in possession of those Lands he demanded. This man
thus violently thrust out of his possessions, smothered and smoohed up this
injury, not as a Clown, but with much silence and sufferance, contenting
himself with this; that though they had usurped his possessions, they had not
restrained him of his liberty, and privily wrote a short and stout letter unto
Philip, A lesson for Princes that are o^tentimes thus deluded and blinded.
wherein he discovered the injury which was done him, upon the reading whereof,
Philip was so displeased, that he presently commanded Pausanias to restore the
land to the former Lord, and as for the other reprobate and dishonest Soldier,
ungrateful guest, and covetous castaway, to brand him in the forehead, to
witness that he was an ungrateful and unthankful guest. Truly, he was
worthy, not that these letters should be written, but engraven on his forehead,
that expulsed and exposed his Host, like to a naked and shipwrackt-wretch, on
that very shore, where once he had succored him. We shall afterward see what
more greater punishment he deserved: mean while those goods were to be taken
from him, which he had so injuriously usurped. The reason why this ungrateful
man was to be punished.
And who would be moved at his punishment, who had committed such a heinous
crime, that might be the cause, that no man hereafter would count miserable the
misery of the most miserable?

CHAP. XXXVIII.
Shall Philip be constrained to perform his word unto thee, because he has
promised thee, although he ought not to do that, though he injury another man,
though he commit a heinous crime, although by this one act of his, he locketh
up the havens, and shuts up theports against those that are shipwrackt? It
is no point either of lightness or inconstancy, for a man to forsake a known
and condemned error. And a man ought ingeniously to confess and say, I
thought otherwise, I am deceived. But this is a perseverance in an arrogant
foolishness to say, That which I have spoken once, whatsoever it be, I will
abide by it, and make good my word. It is no shame to change a man's opinion,
when the business is changed. Go to, if Philip had left him in possession of
these demeasnes, and that seacoast which he had gotten by his shipwreck, had
he not barred all miserable men from relief? It is better (says he) that thou
should carry throughout my kingdom these letters engraven in thy most
shameless forehead, more worthy to be written in thine eyes. Show thou in thy
punishment, how sacred a thing the table of hospitality is. Let all the world
read this my law, enregistred in thy countenance, by which is decreed, that it
is no capital matter, to entertain any miserable person into a man's house. So
shall this constitution of mine be more strongly ratified, then if I had
engraven the same in brass.

CHAP. XXXIX.
WHy then (says he) did your Zeno, when he had promised a certain man to lend
him five hundred pence, and had found him to be insufficient, and not able to
repay him, contrary to the advice of his friends, who cou^selled him not to do
it, perseuered in trusting him, because he had promised him? First there is one
condition in a debt, another in a benefit. If I have lent my money to an evil
debtor, yet have I means to recover it again: I may call any debtor into
justice, when the term of payment is come, and if he break or play the
banquerupt, I shall have a portion of my debt, but the benefit is wholly lost
insta^tly. Moreover, this is the act of an evil man, that of a bad husband.
Again, neither would Zeno have perseuered to credit him, if the sum had bin
greater, it was but five hundred pence; put case (as it is commonly said) that
he had spent it in a sickness, was it so much worth not to revoke his promise. I
will come to supper (although it be cold) because I have promised, but if it
snowed or were bad weather, I would not step out of my doors. I will arise out
of my bed to accompany a Bridal, because I have promised (although I have not
sufficiently slept or disgested my meat) but not at all, if a favor surprise
me. I will come and give my word for thee, because I have promised, but not if
thou would make me stand bound for an uncertain thing, or if thou will bind
me to the Exchequer. I tell thee there is always a secret condition implied;
so I be able^ so it be lawful. If thou will have me keep my promise, set
the matter in the same state, that it was in when thou demandedst, that it was
in when I promised. It can be no point of lightness to disappoint one, The
condition of the Prince may alter the Counsel.
if there happen any alteration by the way: why wonderest thou if I change my
counsel, when the conditions of my promise are changed? I am ready at this
time to be the same I was then, if thou show me all things in that estate I
left them: we promise to make appearance for my friend, yet is it not
performed. For if there be any one that is hindered by force, or by a lawful
cause he is excused by essoyne.

CHAP. XL.
THe same also will serve for an answer to this demand; whether a courtesy is
to be requited in any wise, or whether a benefit be every way to be restored?
I am bound to yield a thankful heart, but sometimes mine infelicitie suffers
me not to make requital; and sometimes his felicity, to whom I am indebted:
for what can I, being poor, restore to a King or a rich man? whereas some
suppose it to be an injury to receive a benefit, and benefits do always
burden the receiver with other benefits. What other satisfaction can I make
unto such a person, then to be willing to acknowledge their goodness. For I
ought not to reject his new benefit, because I have not satisfied for the
former, I will receive as willingly as it is given me: I will offer my self
unto my friend as a sufficient matter, to exercise upon me all his good
thoughts, and liberality. He that will not receive new courtesies, is offended
with the old. I, but I render not the like: what is that to the purpose? the
delay is not in me, if either occasion fail, or ability be wanting: when he
did me a pleasure, he had the means and the commodity. He that has done it,
is either a good or an evil man; if he be a good man, my case and cause is
good enough; if he be an evil man, I will not plead before him: neither
think. I it meet also to be over hasty in yielding recompense, contrary to
the minds of those who have done us pleasure, or that we importune them to
receive, when they are unwilling to take it. It is no requital of a good
turn, to render that which thou have willingly received, to him that is
unwilling to accept the same. There are some, who if a friend send them some
little present, do suddenly after requite them with another, to the end they
may vaunt they are not any ways obliged. Ha^tie return of favor is rather a
defacing of a benefit, then a satisfaction.
This is a kind of refusal, when a man will make requital so soon, and by
this means deface so suddenly one present by another. Sometimes also I will
not restore a benefit, when I am able; namely, when I shall detract more from
my self, and do my self, more hinderance, then I shall profit him; when as
he shall feel himself nothing amended by receiving it, and I shall find my
self greatly impaired by forgoing it. He then that hastes to restore and
requite a kindness, has not the mind of a grateful man, but of a debtor.
And to conclude in few words, he that is desirous to pay over soon, does owe
unwillingly; he that unwillingly owes, is ungrateful.

The end of the fourth Book.
LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE FIFTH BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THe two special parts being concluded and determined. How a benefit should be
given, and how it ought to be received. He says that he passes over to
certain things, that are not so much in the matter as of the matter, and both
near and united to the same. Then annexeth he certain questions, and first
of all this. Whether it be a loathsome matter to be overcome in benefits? He
denies that he may be o^er-come, and approves him to be always equal, that
is desirous to make recompense in good will, if in act he cannot. The second
question is: Whether any man may give himself a benefit? He denies it, yet
argues the matter on both sides. The third question he uses is, Whether any
man according to the Stoics doctrine may be called ungrateful? he affirms
and teaches it. His fourth question is, Whether all are ungrateful? he says
no; although he confess many. Then as depending of the said question: How
far and whither we are bound one for an other, as the Son for the Father,
and such like? He answers by a distinction, and rather denies. The fifth
question is, Whether an unpleasing benefit may be given to a man unwilling to
receive? It may. The last question, Whether a benefit may be redemanded?

IN these my former books, me thought, I had consummated and accomplished my
principal intent, when as I had entreated and discovered, after what manner a
good turn is to be done, and in what sort it is to be received, because these
two points are the Poles, on which the Sphere of this discourse is moved.
Whatsoever I entreat of, or linger on further, is not of the necessity of the
matter, neither much impertinent thereunto, which we ought to follow, not only
whither it leads us, but also whither it inuiteth us. For continually there
will some arguments arise, that will allure and entertain our mind with the
sweetness thereof, which is rather not necessary then superfluous. But since
you will have it so, having ended all that which appertayned to the matter, let
us p^rseuer to search out these things, tha^ ar^ annexed unto it, but not
coherent, which whosoever does curiously look into, neither performs a
matter of great moment, An extraordinary commendation of AEbutius Liberalis.
neither loses his labor. But unto thee (my AEbutius Liberalis) who art a
man of the best nature, and so inclined to courtesy, no praise of th^se
benefits may suffice^ I n^uer saw any man so favorable an esteemer of the
smallest good offices, as thou art^ And thy bounty has already attained so
far, that thou esteemest the courtesy done unto thy self, which is employed
on any other man. Thou art always ready to give satisfaction for the
ungrateful, least any man should repent him of his bounty and kindness: and
so far art thou from all arrogancy and ostentation, so desirous art thou to
disburthen those whom thou have obliged, that whatsoever thou bestowest on any
man, thou would not seem to have given it as a benefit, but to have repaied
it as a debt. Bounty is redoubled to the worthy benef^ctor.
And therefore, such things as thou bestowest after this manner, return unto
thee more plentifully. For commonly good turns attend upon him, that intends
not to redemand them. And as glory and reputation, do most of all fasten
upon, and follow those who fly from the same; so the fruit of benefits is more
graciously correspondent unto those as give men leave to be thankelesse, if
they list. It shall not be through thy default, This is intended as a debt,
not as a gui^t.
but that they who have received benefits at thy hands, may freely redemand the
other, neither^ will thou refuse the former, which are either suppressed or
dissembled by thee. The intent of a generous man, and such a one as has a
noble mind, is so long to forbear, and wink at an ungrateful person, until
he has made him thankful: neither will this manner of dealing deceive thee
ever; for naturally vices submit themselves unto virtue, and loose their
courage, if thou hasten not too much to hate them.

CHAP. II.
THou conceiuest likewise a singular pleasure, to hear this magnificent
saying, that it is a shame to be overcome in giving benefits, which whether it
be true or no, it is wont to be enquired upon a good ground, and I think it
far different from that which thou imaginest. For never neede^t thou to fear
any affront or dishonor in suffering thy self to be overcome in the noble
competencie of virtuous actions, if so be thou forsake not thine arms, but
being once overcome have a will to overcome again. Every man in a good
purpose has not the same forces, the same faculties, and the same fortune:
which only t^mperateth the ends of the best actions. The will of him that
keeps the right way, deserves to be praised, although a more swifter runner
has set foot before him. It is not in this case as it is in the public
prizes, set out for spectacle, wherein the victory proclaims the better man;
although in them also casualtie has often preserved the worst. When we speak
of duty, and both the one and the other desire to acquit themselves fully; if
the one of them has had more meanes^ if he have had matter at hand
correspondent to his mind, if fortune has permitted him to do what him
lists: And contrariwise, if the other has had as good a will, although that
which he has restored is of l^ss^ value then that which he has received, or
if he have not satisfied at all, yet if he have a good mind to make a future
satisfaction, if he bend himself wholly to that business, if he duly think
on nothing but the same, he is no more overcome then he that dies manfully
fighting, whom his enemy could sooner kill then put to flight. That which thou
supposest to be dishonorable or dishonest, cannot befall a good man; that is to
say, to be vanquished: never will his heart fail him, never will he give over,
he will be always ready to acknowledge even until the last hour of his
life. He will do in this station, and will confess himself to have received
great benefits, and will protest that he has a desire to repay them with the
like.

CHAP. III.
THe Pancratiastes was he, that not only with naked hands and ^ists, but with
his feet and whole body entertaineth the fight.

Costus was he, that with armed hand, or heavy buttons or waights of brass,
iron, or lead, charged ^is adversary.


Lacedaemonians, forbad their Citizens to fight at buffets or braces, where he
confessing himself to be vanquished, does show him to be the weaker man. The
runner that first obtains the goal, out-strippeth his companion in
swiftness, but not in courage. The wrestler that has fallen, and been foiled
three times, has lost the palm, but has not yielded it to his adversary.
Whereupon the Lacedaemonians being desirous above all other things, that their
Citizens should be invincible, they inhibited and forbad them the use of all
such games, in which the victory is given not by the opinion of the judges, or
by the issue of the game, but by the voice of him that yields, and his that
commands him to submit and yield. Virtue and a good heart give unto all men
that which the Lacedaemonians do observe amongst their Citizens, virtue and
good will yields all men that they shall never be vanquished, because even
amongst those that are overcome the mind continues invincible. No man
therefore says, that the three hundred Fabij were conquered, but slain. And
Regulus was Captain amongst the Carthaginians^ but not conquered, and all else
whatsoever oppressed by the force and weight of enraged and cruel Fortune. The
care is all one in benefits, he that has received more great, more precious,
and more often, is not for all this vanquished. It may be that the benefits of
one, are overcome by those of another, in respect of those things that are
given, and are received. But if thou will make a comparison betwixt the giver
and him that receives (whose minds must be estimate also by themselves) there
is neither of them shall have the palm. For we are accustomed to say, that
he who is wounded in diverse parts, and he that has but a slight hurt, have
departed on even hand from the combat, although one may seem to have received
the fo^le.

CHAP. IIII.
The will to recompense redeemeth the want.
NO man therefore can be overcome in benefits, if he know that he owes, if he
have a will to recompense, and if that which he cannot attain in act, he
equalleth in mind and will. This man, as long as he is con^tant herein, as
long as he has a good intent, approving his grateful mind by outward signs:
what skilleth it on whether part more presents may be numbered? Thou have the
power to give much, and I only the power to receive the same: good fortune is
on thy side, and good will on mine, yet am I so equal with thee, as some naked,
or slightly armed, are equal to some that are armed at all points. No man
therefore is overcome in benefits. For every one is as thankful, as he would
be. For if it be an affront and dishonor to be overcome in kind offices, we
ought not to receive a benefit at mighty men's hands, to whom we can in no sort
yield any satisfaction. I speak of Kings and Princes, whom Fortune has
entertained in that estate, that they may do much, and bestow great largess,
but they cannot receive but very little, and far inferior to their own
gift. I say, Kings and Princes, to whom notwithstanding there may be service
done, whose greatness and power is not sustained but by affection, and the
common consent which their subjects have to obey them. But there are some that
are unattained with any covetousness, that are scarcely touched with any humane
desires; to whom Fortune her self can give nothing. I must needs be overcome
by Soc^ates in benefits. I must confess the like of Diogenes, who marched
naked amiddest the riches and most precious moueables of the Macedonians, and
trampled their Kingly treasures under his feet. Did not he then (yea and that
deserved) both in his own eyes, and other men's sight (whose eyes were not
sealed up from seeing the truth) seem more eminent above him, under whose
greatness all things lay subject. He was then more powerful and more rich then
Alexander, who at that time possessed all things, for there was more that this
man would nor receive, then he was able to give.

CHAP. V.
IT is no shame to be overcome by such as these, for neither am I less
valiant, though you match me in fight with an enemy that cannot be wounded.
Neither therefore can the fire burn less, if it light upon a matter
inviolable by fire. Neither therefore has the tool lost his force in caruing,
if the stone be so hard that it cannot be pierced, and if naturally it be so
rebellious against all things that are hard, that it will rather break in
pieces then yield. The same do I answer of a thankful man, it is no dishonor
for him to be overcome by the benefits which he has received at their hands,
whose fortune is so great and mighty, and virtue so excellent, that it has
barred all return of benefits unto him. We are for the most part overcome by
our parents, for so long do we hate them, as long as we judge them to be
troublesome and insupportable, and as long as we understand not their
benefits. When as our years have taught us some experience, and we begin to
perceive, that they ought to be beloved by us, for those things for which they
were misliked; I mean their admonitions, their severity and diligent
ouer-sight of our inconsiderate youth, then are they snatched and taken from
us. Few there are that have lived so long as to reap the true fruit of their
childrens towardness, the rest have felt a burden by them and discontent:
yet is it no shame for children to be surmounted by their parents. And why
should it be shameful to be surmounted by them, since it is no disgrace to be
vanquished by any whatsoever? For sometimes we are equal and unequal to one
and the same person; we are equal in good will, which is only r^quired, which
we only promise and profess: but we are unequal in fortune, for want
whereof, if a man be hindered from being thankful, he ought not for that cause
to be ashamed and blush, because he is vanquished. It is no dishonor to be
unable to overtake, so a man pursue and follow still. Sometimes we are
enforced before we have restored the old, to crave new benefits. Neither
therefore surceas^ we to ask, or demand we disgracefully and dishonestly,
because we run further in debt, The miserable man then is to be excus^d,
unless his mind be faulty in making satisfaction
before we be able to repay the former, because the fault is not through our
default, but for that disabilitie preuenteth our gratuitie. But some thing will
fall out otherways, which will keep us from satisfying, yet will we not be
ouer-matched in mind, neither will w^e be shamefully overcome in these
things, which are not in our power.

CHAP. VI.
ALEXANDER King of Macedon, was oftentimes wont to boast, that never any man
could overcome him in benefits. There is no cause why this ouer-haughty minded
Prince, should cast his eyes on the Macedons, Greeks, Carians, Persians, and
other nations which were bound unto him by way of conquest. He should not
think that that great Kingdom, which extended it self from the furthest
confines of Thrace, to the banks of the unknown Sea, had given him the means to
accomplish and do this. Socrates himself might vaunt that he had done as much,
and Diogenes also, by whom he was overcome. Why should he not be overcome that
very day, wherein the man swelling above measure with humane pride, he saw a
man to whom he could neither give, nor from whom he could ever take any thing?
King Archelaus entreated Socrates to come and visit him; to whom (as it is
reported) Socrates returned this answer: That he would not come unto him from
whom he should receive a benefit, which he could not requite again. First of
all^ it was in his power not to receive any thing: secondly, it was he that
began to give a benefit. For he came unto him upon his request, and gave that
which the King could never equal or satisfy. Moreover, Archelaus was to give
him gold and silver, but was himself to receive the contempt of gold and
silver. Could not Socrates therefore requite Archelaus courtesy? Had he not
equalled the good which he was to receive, had he made him see a man perfect in
the skill of living and dying, knowing the true ends of them both? If he had
taught the King (who saw not at midday) the secrets of Nature, whereof he was
so ignorant, that upon a day when the Sun was in Eclips, he caused the doors
of his Palace to be shut; and (as men were wont to do in time of mourning and
great misery) he cut off his sons hair: How great a benefit had it been if
he had drawn him laden with fear out of the lurking places where he lay
hidden, T^is is a^ain^t (...) neu^r was Eclipse ^t ^ull M^one n^turally, hat
in (...) death s^pernaturally.
and had encouraged him, saying, This is no defection or obscuring of the
Sun, but the encounter of two Planets, when as the Moon, shaping her course
more lower th^n the Sun, has placed her Orb under him, and by her
interposition holds his light obscured from our sight: sometimes covers no
more then a small part of his body, when in the conjunction she passes no
more but on one side; otherwhiles she ecclipseth a greater part of his light,
when she sets her self in his front, and before him; otherwhiles she
covers him wholly, if with a just and equal counterpoi^e, she entirely
^ettle her self opposite betwixt the Sun and the earth: yet the swiftness
of these stars shall suddenly separate the one from the other, the earth
hereby shall recover her light: and this order shall continue in all ages to
come. There are certain and destinated days, wherein the Moon shall by her
intercourse hinder the Sun, not from shooting forth the fulness of his beams.
Stay but a while, and thou shall suddenly see him break forth, thou shall see
him discharge himself of the Moon as it were of a cloud, and (shaking off as
it were those impediments that detain him) thou shall see him send forth his
desired light most freely again. Might not Socrates then have requited
Archelaus, if he had given him instructions how to govern his Kingdom? As
little as you make of it, it had been a great benefit in Socrates, and greater
any ways then Archelaus could have given him. Why then said Socrates thus?
Forsooth, because he took a pleasure to pass the time in ^iguratiue mercy,
and jesting discourse, he mocked the whole world, but especially great men, and
had rather deny him subtly, then arrogantly and proudly. He said that he
would receive no benefits at his hands, to whom he could not return an
answerable recompense. He feared happily least he should be compelled to take
that which he would not, he feared least he should receive something that
were unworthy, Socrates. But some man will say, that he might have denied the
same, if he misliked it, but by this means he had incensed an insolent King
against him, who would have all that which came from his hands, highly
esteemed. It is nothing to the purpose, whether thou refusest to give any thing
to that King, or receive ought at his hands, he construeth and conceiteth the
one repulse, as badly as the other, and to a proud man it is more distasteful
to be disdained, then not to be feared. Will thou know what he truly and
really intended, he would not entertain a voluntary servitude, whose
liberty a free City could not endure.

CHAP. IIII.
WE have, as I suppose, sufficiently debated upon this part, whither it were a
dishonor to be overcome in benefiting. Which whosoever draws in question,
he knows that men are not wont to give themselves benefits; for it had been
manifest that it is no shame for a man to be vanquished by himself.
Notwithstanding amongst some Stoics, this also is brought in question, whether
a man may give himself a benefit, and whether he ought to yield himself
thanks? The causes why this matter seemed to be disputable, were these that
follow: We are wont to say, I thank my self, and I can complain of no man
but my self, I am angry with my self, and I will be revenged of my self,
and I hate my self, and many other such things besides, whereby every one
speaks of himself, as if it were of an other. If (says he) I can hurt my
self, wherefore can I not benefit my self likewise? Besides, if those
kindnesses which I have bestowed upon an other, should be called benefits, why
should they not retain the same name, if they were employed on my self? Had I
received them of an other, I should owe the same, why then had I given them to
my self, should I not owe them to my self? why should I be ungrateful to my
self? whereas it is no less dishonorable and dishonest for me, then to be
niggardly to my self, then to be cruel and tyrannous toward my self, and
neglectfull of my self? As infamous is the band of another beauty, as she
that sets her own to sale: we reprehend a flatterer, and an applauder of
other men's sayings, and such a one as is always ready to yield a false luster
and laud to every thing: So likewise is he most justly reprehended that
pleases himself, admireth himself, and (if I may say so) flattereth
himself. Vices are not only hateful, when they sin abroad, but when they
are retorted upon themselves. Whom will thou more admire then him that
governs himself, and that always carries in his hands the bridle of his
own motions and affections? It is more easy to govern Barbarians, and such
as are impatient of foreign government, then to contain a man's mind: and
make it subject to it self. Plat^ (says he) thanketh Socrates because he
taught him. Why should not Socrates thank himself for teaching himself?
Marcus Cato says: That which thou want, borrow of thy self. Why can I not
give it my self, if I can lend it my self? There are innumerable things
wherein custom of discourse divides us from our selves. We are wont to say,
Let thou me alone, I will speak with my self, and I will pull my self by the
ear: Which if they be true, even as any man ought to be angry with
himself, so ought he to thank himself: as he may rebuke himself, so may he
praise himself: as he may harm himself, so may he profit himself. An
injury and a benefit are contraries: if we say of any man, he has wronged
himself, we may likewise say, he has done himself a good turn.

CHAP. VIII.
NO man is indebted to himself; but by the order of nature: we must first owe,
before we pay. There is no debtor without a creditor, no more then there is a
husband without a wife, or rather a Father without a Son. There must be some
one to give, if there be any to receive. It is neither to give, nor receive, to
turn out of the right hand into the left: Even as no man bears himself,
although he move and remove his body: As no man, although he has pleaded his
own cause, is said to have been his own Advocate, neither raises he a
statue to himself, as if he had been his own Patron. As the sick man, when
as by his own diligence he has recovered his health, requires no recompense
from himself: so in all affairs, yea even in those wherein a man has
deserved best of himself, yet ought he not yield himself thanks, because he
has not any to whom he may yield thanks: and if I grant thee that any man may
do himself a pleasure: I say, that in giving the same, he receives also.
Admit I grant thee that any one receives a pleasure from himself; in
receiving the same, he satisfies for the same likewise. This cloaking and
changing of persons (as the common proverb runs) is made in thine own
house, and passes away forthwith as a fained and idle debt. For he that
gives is none other then he that receives, and both are but one. This word,
to owe, has place, but between two several persons: how then may it consist
in him only, which in that very instant requi^eth when he is obliged? Even as
in a Bowl or Ball there is neither high nor low, nor first nor last, because
that in tossing and turning the same, the order of these things are changed: so
as that they which went behind are now before, and those things that fell,
mount up again; and all things in fine return unto one point, in what sort
soever they be removed; even so must thou think that it falls out in man:
when thou have changed him into diverse fashions, he is but one and the same
man. He has beaten himself: he has no man to sue for doing him injury. He
has bound and shut himself up in prison: he cannot complain of the injustice
and force he has done unto himself. He has gratified himself, and has
forth with restored, even when it was done, and a doing. Nature, the Mother of
all things, is said to loose nothing; for whatsoever is taken from her,
returns to her again: neither can any thing perish, because it can find no
place where to issue out of it self, but returns thither from whence it
departed. But what resemblance (says he) has this example to our matter in
question? I will tell thee: Put case thou be ungrateful to thy selfe^ the
benefit will not be los^, because he that gave it retains it still: Put
case thou will not receive it, it is in thy possession, before it is repaid
thee. Thou can loose nothing, for that which is taken from thee, is
notwithstanding gotten for thee. The wheel is turned within thy self;
receiving thou give, and giving thou receiuest.

CHAP. IX.
A Man (says he) must do good unto himself, and consequently he must be
thankful to himself. First, that is false whereon the sequel depends. For
no man gives himself a benefit, but obeys his own nature, by whom he is
composed and framed to love himself, whence there grows in him an especial
care to avoid those things that are harmeful, and to desire those things that
are profitable. For which cause, neither is he liberal, that gives to
himself, nor pitiful, that pardons himself, nor merciful, that is
touched with his own miseries. That which (were it employed on other men)
might justly be called liberality, clemency, and mercy: in regard of our
selves, is but nature. A benefit is a voluntary thing, but to profit a man's
self, is a necessary matter. The more benefits a man has given, the more
bountiful is he. Who ever was applauded for succouring himself? for
delivering himself out of the danger of thiefes? no man gives himself a
benefit, no more then he entertaineth himself in his own house, no man
gives to himself, no more then he lends to himself. If any man gives
himself a benefit, he always gives, he gives without intermission, he
can never keep just reckoning of the number of his benefits. How can he then
return a recompense, when as in that very thing wherein he satisfies, he
gives a benefit? for how can he discern whither he give or restore unto
himself a benefit? whereas the matter concerns but one only man? I have
delivered my self out of danger: have I given my self a benefit? Once more I
preserve my self in peril, do I my self a good turn, or do I restore it?
Moreover, although I should grant that first, that we give a benefit to our
selves, yet will I not grant the consequent. For although we give, we owe
not. Why? because we presently receive: First, must we receive a benefit, and
then owe it, and then requite it. But here is no time of owing, in so much as
we receive again without any delay. No man gives but to an other man, no man
owes but to an other man, no man restores but to another man. All that which
in this sort requires two persons, cannot be done in one.

CHAP. X.
A Benefit is that whereby something is profitably given, but this word, to
have given, appertains to others. Shall he not be supposed to be a mad man,
that says, he has sold any thing to himself? because a sale is an
alienation of a man's substance and right, and a translation thereof unto an
other. But even as in selling, so in buying any thing we ought to make a real
surrender of the thing, and to leave that which a man has, to suffer an other
to enjoy the same. Well, if benefiting be of the same nature, then can no man
benefit himself, because no man can give ought to himself. For then should
two contraries concur in one, so as giving and taking should be all one
thing. But there is great difference betwixt giving and taking. And good cause
why, considering that both these words are placed as contraries, the one
against the other, but if a man may give himself a benefit, there is no
difference betwixt giving and receiving. I said a little before, that there
were some words that appertayned to others, and are so formed that their whole
signification departed from our selves. I am a brother, but an other man's
brother: For no man can be his own brother. I am equal and like; but to some
man: for who is equal with himself? That which is compared, is not to be
understood without an other^ that which is united, cannot be without an other:
If both, that which is given, is not without an other, so likewise a benefit is
not without a receiver. And this appears in the word it self, wherein this
is contained to have benefited. But no man benefiteth himself, no more then
he favors himself, or takes part with himself: I might prosecute this
thing longer, and with larger examples, and why not? when as a benefit is
numbered amongst those things, which require a second person. Some things which
are honest, praiseworthy, and of great virtue, have no place, but with
another. Faithfulness and integrity, is commended and praised by every man,
and are esteemed amongst the greatest blessings which appertain to mankind,
and yet have you ever heard, that any man has been faithful to himself?

CHAP. XI.
I Come now to the last part. He that requi^eth a good turn, must employ
somewhat of his own, as he does who repayeth the money he owes: but he lays
out nothing who satisfies himself, no more then he gives, who gives to
himself. A benefit and a remuneration must pass from one unto an other: for
in one person there is no vicissitude or change: He therefore that requiteth a
good turn pleasureth him again, from whom he has received any thing. He
that is grateful to himself, whom profits he? himself. But what man is he
that thinks not that acknowledgement of a favor is in one place, and the
benefit in an other? He that requiteth himself; profits himself; but what
ungrateful man was there ever that would not do this? nay rather who was not
ungrateful that he might do this? if we (says he) ought to thank our selves
for that we have done well, we ought likewise to yield some recompense to our
selves. But we say, I thank my self, because I married not that wife, and for
that I contracted not society with that man. When we say thus, we praise our
selves, and to approve our fact, we abuse the words of those that give thanks.
A benefit is such a thing which may not be restored, even then when it is
given, he that gives himself a benefit, cannot choose but receive that which
he gave, Ergo, it is no benefit. A good turn is entertained at one time, and
recompensed at an other; And in a benefit the thing that is most probable, and
of greatest repute, is, that he forgets his own profit to do an other man
good, and takes from himself, to give unto a second; this does he not that
gives himself a benefit. To give a benefit is a sociable thing. It joins
that man's favor, and obliges this man's friendship: To give to a man's self is
no sociable thing, it joins no man, it obliges no man, it encourages no man
to say, This man deserves to be honored, he did such a man a good turn, and
will do me the like. A benefit is that which a man gives, not for his own
sake, but for his to whom he gives it: he that gives himself a benefit,
gives it for his own sake. Ergo, it is no benefit.

CHAP. XII.
SVpposest thou that I lie and grow deficient in that which I promised in the
He said in the beginning of the first ^hapter of this first Book, that
although he had not to entreat of things necessary yet the labor should not
be lost.
beginning? say thou that in stead of performing some laudible thing, I
run at random, and thinking to do well, have lost my labor? Expect a little
I pray thee, and thou shall say this more truly, (as soon as I have led thee
into these laborinthes, from whence, when thou have escaped, thou shall attain
no more, then to fli^ those difficulties into which it was in thine own choice
not to descend: what profit receiuest thou to unloose those knots which thou
have expressly knit with much travail, to the end thou might, when thou
have tied them, busy thy self to loosen them? But even as some of them are so
fastened (for delight and meriment sake) that it is a hard matter for an
unskillful man to loosen them, whereas he who has tied them, may easily
slack them, because he knows the stops and entanglings thereof, and yet
notwithstanding those have some pleasure in them, for they try the sharpnes of
men's wits, and awaken them to more diligence: so these things which in
appearance are subtle and deceitful exile security, dullness and sloth from
men's minds, to which sometimes easy passages are to be laid open, in which
they may wander, sometimes somewhat difficult and dangerous is to be set in
their way, through which they may hardly creep without travel, or in which
they may not walk without difficulty. It is said that no man is ungrateful,
and this is thus concluded. A benefit is that which profits, but no man can
profit an evil man (as you Stoics say) therefore an evil man receives no
benefit, and consequently also he cannot be ungrateful. Furthermore, a benefit
is an honest and probable thing: with a wicked man there is no place, either
for that which is honest or profitable, therefore not for a benefit, which if
he cannot receive, he ought not to restore, and therefore is he not
ungrateful. Again, as you say, A good man does all things iustly^ if he does
all things justly, he cannot be ungrateful. A good man restores a benefit, an
evil man cannot accept it. Which if it be so, neither any good or evil man is
ungrateful: and consequently, this name of ungrateful is but a frivolous and
imaginary name in this world. There is but only one good with us, and that is
honesty. This cannot an evil man apprehend, for he cease to be evil, if
virtue enter into him, but as long as he is evil, no man can give him a
benefit, because good and evil things are at odds, and cannot be reconciled:
therefore no man profits him, for whatsoever befalls him, he corrupts it
with evil use. For even as the stomach being troubled and corrupted by long
sickness, and oppressed by choler, changes whatsoe^er meats it receives,
and conuerteth all the nutriment it receives into the cause of his grief:
even so a blinded mind, whatsoever thou committest to him, it makes the same
his burden, his bane, and the occasion of his miseri^. They then which have
most riches, and possess most goods, are subject to most storms and t^mpests,
and the less find they themselves, the more they fall into a greater occasion
of impi^tie and disturbance: nothing therefore may befall the e^ill that may
profit them, nay rather, nothing that does not hurt them. For wha^soeuer
befalls them, they convert into their own nature, and those things which in
outward appearance are pleasing and profitable, if they were given to a better
man, are pestiferous and harmefull to them. Therefore also can they not give a
benefit, because no man can give that which he has not, and for that they
want a will to do good.

CHAP. XIII.
But although all this were true, yet may an evil man receive such things as
have a similitude and resemblance of benefits, which being unrecompensed, he
shall be justly termed ungrateful. There are goods of the mind, goods of the
body, and goods of fortune. Those goods of the mind are such, as foolish and
bad men are incapable of them. To these is he admitted, who can both receive
the same, and is tied to restore them; and if he restores them not, he is
ungrateful. And this is not our constitution only, it is of the Stoics
doctrine. The Peripatetiques also (who prefix such large and ample bounds to
hunmane felicity) say, that the smaller sort of benefits befall the evil men,
that whosoever restores not, he is ungrateful. We therefore esteem them no
benefits, which cannot better and enoble the mind, yet deny we not, but that
they are commodities, and such as are to be desired, these may an evil man
give, and receive from a good man; as money, garments, honor, life, which if
he requite not, he falls into the name of an ungrateful man. But how call
you him ungrateful, for not restoring that, which thou deniest to be a
benefit? There are some things, which although they are not truly such, yet for
the similitude and likeness they have with them, are comprehended under the
same word. So call we a box, An^ yet is called a Box, from the Box-tree, o^
which boxes first were made, it answ^res to the Gre^ke word (...).
both of that which is of gold, as that which is of silver: so term w^e him
unlearned that is not wholly rude, but as yet untrained and taught in higher
discipline: so he that sees a man ill clothed, and in ragged garments, says
that he has seen a naked man. These are no benefits, yet have they a
resemblance of b^ne^its. As th^se are but benefits in appearance, so seems he
to be ungrateful, yet is not he ungrateful. This is false, because that he
that gives, and he that receives calls them b^n^fits. So also he that has
deceived under pretense and color of a true benefit, is as ungrateful as he
is held to be a poysoner, that gives a stupifying medicine, when he believed
it was poison.

CHAP. XIIII.
CLEANTHES urges this more vehemently; Although (says he) it b^ not a benefit
which he receives, yet is he ungrateful, because he would not have restored
it, although he had received it. So is he a thief (yea eu^n then before he
has polluted his hands) because he is already armed to kill, and has a will
to spoil and murder: wickedness begins not, but is exercised and opened
in the action. That which he received was no benefit, but was so called.
Sacrilegious persons are punished, although they lay not their hands on the
Gods. How (says he) may a man be ungrateful toward a wicked man, when as a
benefit cannot be given to a wicked man? Verily in that respect, because he
receives of him some of those things, which amongst vulgar and ignorant
persons are called goods, whereof, if evil men have abundance, he also in the
like matter ought to be grateful, and restore those things, whatsoever they
be, for good, whereas he received them for good: he is said to owe another
man's money, both he that owes gold, and he that owes lether coined with the
public stamp, such as was current amongst the Lacedaemonians, that stands in
stead of ready money: in that kind thou art obliged, in the same to yield
satisfaction.

CHAP. XV.
WHat benefits are, and whether the greatness and dignity of a name so
honorable should be employed in this abject, and humble matter, it
appertains not to you, a true benefit belongs unto others. Compose you your
minds to the resemblance of a true benefit, and whilst you say that thing is
honest, whatsoever it be, if it be reputed and esteemed for honest, esteem and
praise that: Even as (says he) no man in your judgment is ungrateful, so
again by your reckoning all men are ungrateful. For as you say, all fools
are evil men, but he that has one vice is possessed of all, and all men are
fools and evil, therefore all men are ungrateful. What then? does not the
reproach generally light upon all mankind? Is it not a public complaint that
benefits are lost, and that there are few which requite not evil, for such as
have deserved well? neither have thou cause to conceive that this is our
particular misconceit, or deceit, and that we alone repute all things evil,
and depraved that fall not out even and just, with the rule of right. Behold I
know not what vein it is, or whence it is sent, which cries not out of the
Philosophers house, but from the midst of the multitude, condemning People and
Nations. Nor from the Host the guest can be secured,
Nor from his Son in-law the Father freed,
Nor Brother from his Brother be assured:
Both Man and wife have eithers death decreed.
But this now is more, benefits are turned into banes, and their blood is not
spared, for whose defense we ought to spend our own. We follow and gratify
benefits with Sword and Poison. At this time it is reputed dignity and
greatness, to violate and spoil a man's Country, and to oppress her with her
own authoririe. He that has not trodden the Commonwealth under his feet,
supposes himself the basest and ignoblest in the same. These Armies that were
levied by her, are armed against her, and her imperious voice is applauded and
listened to, that says. Fight against your wives, draw your Swords against your
children, destroy your Temples, raize down your houses, and cast your household
gods on the ground. You that should not enter Rome (no not to triumph) without
permission and command of the Senate, and to whom bringing home their
victorious Armies, audience was given in the Senate without the City walls,
enter the City now with displayed ensigns, murdering the Citizens, and
bathed in the blood of your nearest kinsfolks. Let liberty be silent amidst
these warlike ensigns. And let that conquering Nation, and that people which
has established peace through their whole Empire; and driven wars out of
their Provinces, and allayed all terror and fear, now besieged and terrified
within their own walls, be affraide of their own Standards and Eagles.

CHAP. XVI.
Ungrateful was This was a valiant Captain amongst the Romans, who being
banished upon certain occasions out of the City ( as Titus Liuius reports
in his second Book, Ab vrbe Condita.) Was so skillful to enter and insinuate
himself amongst the Vol^eans, that leuying an Army of them, he began to
invade his Country, until being moved by his Mothers Prayers and tears, he
ceased from the battle.
Coriolanus, to late pious and penitent after his wickedness committed: he
laid aside his Arms, yet so laid he them aside, that it was in the height
and midst of civil parricide. Ungrateful was This was another rebellious
Citizen of Rome, who leuying an Army both of his natural Contrymen and
strangers, intended to destroy the same, had he not been prevented by Ciceros
wisdom, as Salust witnesses in the wars of Catiline.
Catiline. It is a small matter with him to surprise his Country, except he
utterly ruinate it: except he lead the regiments of the Sauoyes and Dalphinois
to spoil the same; and these enemies whom he had levied on the other side of
the Alps, had satisfied and glutted their old and mortal hatreds: except the
Roman Captains had paid their long-due anniuersaries of infernal sacrifice
to the Sepulchers of the Gauls. Ungrateful was This was another Roman
Citizen, who being obscurely borne, and of a rustique conversation, became
Consul in Rome seven times, and ouer-came a nation called the Cymbrians, and
afterward being incensed against his Citizens, for banishing him for a certain
space into Affricke, he committed huge murders in the City.
Caius Marius, who was raised from a common Soldier to a Consular: who except
he had equalled the Roman Funerals with the Cimbrian slaughters, except he
had not only given a sign of civil slaughter and murder, but himself had
been the murderer, he would have supposed that his fortune had been changed
very little, and that he had not grown greater: but was buried in his former
obscurity. Ungrateful was Lucius Sylla, who healed his Country with harder
remedies then the dangers were; who when he had marched from the tower of
Praeneste to the gate Collina, through the blood of slaughtered soldiers,
waged new battles in the City, executed new slaughters, and slew two legions
(O cruelty) after victory, and (that which was most impious) when he had
driven and gathered them into a strait, he murdered them notwithstanding,
after he had faithfully promised them their pardon, and invented a proscription
(O sovereign Gods) that he who had slain a Roman Citizen, should not only be
discharged and exempted from punishments, but receive reward, and which is more
receive the reward done to him that preserved a Citizen. Ungrateful is He was
exercised in the affairs of the Commonwealth, when he was but twenty three
years old.
Cneus Pompey, who for his three Consulships, for his three triumphs, for so
many honors; which for the most part were thrust upon him, during his immature
and young years, returned the Commonweal this requital, that he seized
others of the possession of the same, supposing thereby to discharge himself
of that envy, that might be conceited against his greatness and authority,
if that which were lawful for no man might be admitted in many, whilst he
longed after extraordinary chaunges and commanudes, whilst he distributeth
Provinces, to make choice of that which best liked him, whilst in such sort
he divided the Commonweal into the hands of the Tribunes, that two parts
thereof remained always in his own house, he reduced the Roman people to
that extreme, that they could not be discharged or secured, but by their
servitude and loss of liberty: Ungrateful was he, who was both Pompeyes
enemy and conqueror, who drew the war from the uttermost bounds of Germany
and France, before the walls of Rome. He it was (that pretending popularitie,
and so great love and tender care of the Comminaltie) that pitched his tents in
the The Romans had in their City three round Courts, or Circles, whi^^er they
resorted to see their sports and plays, whereof this was one which was therefore
called the Flaminian Circle or round, because a Consul called Flaminius builded
the same.
Flaminian round, nearer then the place where This was a King of the Etrurians,
who waged war against the Romans to install Tarquine the proud, and planted
his colors as Julius Caesa^ did, near to the Flaminian round or Theater.
P^rsenna encamped. True it is that he^ tempered the power which the law of
arms and victory allotted him, and performed that which he was wont to say,
and never slew any, except such a one as was armed and addressed to fight
against him. But what imports all this? The rest exercised arms more cruelly
then he did, yet were they satisfied at length, and laid them down, but this
man sheathed his sword quickly, but never laid it aside. Ungrateful was
Anthony toward his Dictator was the highest dignity and Magistracy that was
in the Roman Commonweal. See Aldus in his book De legibus Romanis^^
Dictator, whom he pronounced to be justly slain, and assigned to his
murderers great Provinces and governments: and having torn and tired his
country with pros^riptions, incursions, and civil wars after so many evils,
he decreed that, that generous Commonweal, which in times past had given
liberties, exemptions, and particular privileges to the people of Achaia, and
the Rhodians, and many other famous Cities, should her self become tributarie,
not to Roman Kings, but to infamous Eunuchs and Geldings.

CHAP. XVII.
THe day would fail me, if I should reckon up all those that were
ungrateful, even with the utter destruction of their Countries. And no less
endless labor would it be, if I should begin to relate how ungrateful our
Commonweal has been toward the best, and most tenderly affected Citizens
she had, and how as often she has sinned in ingratitude her self, as others
have sinned against her. She sent All these were valiant Citizens of Rome, who
employed themselves in many notable services, and received disgraces for their
good deserts. This Island is not exempt from such like presidents.
Camillus into exile, dismissed Scipio, banished Cicero after Catilines
conspiracy, she raced his house, spoiled his goods, and exercised against him
all those cruelties which Cateline himself could have done, had h^e been
Conqueror. Rutillius, in reward of his innocence, was banished into Asia, to
live there in obscurity. The Roman people denied Cato the Praetorship, and
would never grant him the dignity of a Consul. In brief, we are all of us
generally ungrateful. Let every one examine himself; there is not any man
that will not complain of some ones ingratitude. And it cannot be that all men
should complain, except there were some cause also to complain of all men.
All men therefore are ungrateful. Is this all? and are they thus only. All are
covetous, the world likewise is subject to avarice, all are malicious, all
fearful, and they especially who seem to be most confident. Furthermore, all
men are ambitious, and all men are wicked: But thou must not be displeased and
agrieued hereat, all of them are mad. I will not recall thee to uncertainties,
as to say unto thee, see how ungrateful youth is. Who is he (be he never so
innocent) that wishes not that his Father had breathed his last? who is he
(how modest soever he be) that gapes not after his death? who is he (how
religious and pitiful soever he be reputed) that thinks not of his Fathers
death? what husband so fears the death of a good wife, as he counts not the
gain he shall receive if she die? what man is he, I pray you, who being
entangled in the law, and delivered by an other man's diligence, that bethinketh
him of so great a benefit any longer, then until a second action? This is
confessed, and certain without all exception: Is there any man that dies
without complaining? who at his last gasp dare say thus: My days are done,
Virgil. AEn^id. 4
now have I brought to end
The course of life, that Fortune did me lend.
Who dies not unwillingly? who departs not mournefully? But this is the part
of an ungrateful man, not to content himself with the time that was lent him.
The time will always seem short unto thee, if thou reckon the same. Think
that the chiefest good is not in time, and how little soever it be, take it in
good part. It adds nothing to thy felicity, if the day of thy death be
prolonged, because by delay life is not made more blessed, but more long. How
much better is it to give thanks unto the gods for those honest pleasures,
which we have received, and not to busy our selves in numbering other men's
years, but to esteem our own thankefully, and to put them in the account of
our gains: has God thought me worthy of this? this suffices me: might he
have given me more? but this also is a benefit. Let us be thankful to the
gods, let us be thankful to men, let us be thankful unto those that have
done us any courtesy, and thankful to those likewise who have done any
kindness to any of ours.

CHAP. XVIII.
THou obligest me infinitely (say thou) when thou say Ours, prefixe
therefore some end. He that bestows a benefit on the Son, as thou say,
bestows it likewise on the Father. First, I ask where, and whither, and
afterward I desire thee likewise to inform me, whether a pleasure done unto
the Father, be likewise done unto the Brother, to the Father, the Uncle, the
Grandfather, the Wife, the Son in law? Tell me where I should end, how long
will thou that I follow the order and petigree of so many persons? if I have
tilled thy land for thee, have I not done thee a pleasure? if I have quenched
the fire that would have burned thy house, or if I have repaired it, for fear
it should fall upon thee, shall I not give thee a benefit? if I save thy slaves
life, shall I impute it unto thee? If I preserve thy Son, have thou not
received a benefit at my hands?

CHAP. XIX.
THou set down unlike and different examples, because that he who tilleth
my Land, gives not the benefit to my Land, but to me: and he that
vnder-proppeth my house, least it should fall, does the pleasure to me: for the
house it self is without sense. I must needs be in his debt, because none else
is. And he that manureth my land, does it not to deserve well of the soil, but
of my self. The same will I say of my servant, for he justly appertains to
me, It is for my profit he is preserved, and therefore I am indebted for him.
My Son is capable himself of a benefit, and therefore he received it; I am
glad of the favor done him, it concerns me somewhat, yet am I not obliged.
Yet would I have thee answer me, who think thou art not indebted, whether
thy sons good health, felicity and patrimony appertains to the Father?
He shall be more happy if his son be whole and safe, and unhappy if he
los^ him. What then? he that is made happier by me, and delivered from the
perrill of a mighty infelicitie and misfortune: has he not received a
benefit? no (says he) for certain things are bestowed upon others, which
extend also unto us; but every thing ought to be required at his hands, on whom
that is bestowed: as money is required at his hands who borrowed the same,
although the same came in some sort into my hands. Mark a glimps of charity
even in a Pagan.
There is no benefit, the profit thereof touches and extends not to our
neighbors, and sometimes also to those that are farthest off from us. The
question is not whether the benefit be transferred from him to whom it is
given, but where it is first placed, thou must always redemaund it from the
principal debtor, and he that ought it first. What then I pray thee? say
thou not thou have given me my son, and if he had perished I should not have
lived? gave thou not a benefit for his life, whose safety thou preferrest
before thine own? At such time as I saved thy son, thou did not fall
down at my feet; thou did not pay thy vows unto the gods, as if thou thy
self had been pr^serued? did thou not cry out after this manner, the
same have thou done in succouring my son, as ni saving mine own person make
account that thou have saved two, and me especially: Why say thou this, if
thou receiuest no benefit? because although my son has borrowed money,
which I will repay unto his creditor, yet shall not I be indebted: and if my
son has been taken in adultery, I may happily be ashamed, yet shall not I
therefore be the adulterer: I say that I am bound unto thee for my son, not
because I am, but because I will offer my self unto thee a voluntary debtor.
But a great pleasure has befallen me by his safety; inestimable is the profit
I conceive thereby, and which is more, I have escaped the grievous wound and
corrasiue of being child-lesse. The question is not now, whether thou have
profited me; but whether thou have given me a benefit; for a living creature,
an herb, a stone profit me, yet give they me no benefit, which is never given
but by such a one as is willing. But thou will not give unto the Father, but to
the son; and in the mean while thou know not the Father; when therefore
thou say, Have I not therefore given a benefit to the Father, because I have
saved his son? Argue thou this contrariwise: How could I therefore give a
benefit to the Father, whom I neither kn^w, or ever thought upon? and why
falls it not out sometimes, that thou shall hate the Father mortally, and yet
be desirous to save his sons life? Would thou say that thou gave a
benefit to the Father, whose mortal enemy tho^ were at that time? Resolution
of the doubts.
But laying aside these questions which I entreat of by way of Dialogue, I
will now answer like a Lawier: And say, that the mind of the giver is to be
respected. He gave him the benefit to whom he intended it; even as if he did
it in honor of the Father: the Father received the benefit, not the son; so
is not the Father bound for a benefit bestowed upon his son, although he
envy it. Yet if occasion be offered, the Father shall not do amiss, to be
willing to give somewhat, not that he is constrained by necessity to pay any
thing; but that he might have found a sufficient cause to begin to do a
pleasure. A benefit therefore ought not to be redemanded at the Fathers hands,
for a courtesy done unto the son: and if he voluntarily show himself
grateful for the same, he ought rather to be esteemed just than thankful. For
otherwise there would never be an end; if I give a benefit to the Father, the
mother, the graund-father, the uncle, to the children, kinsfolk, friends,
servants, and country: where then begins a benefit to rest? For me thinks
I am fallen into an argument which the Grecians call Sorites, which has never
an end, because it drudgeth on, and stealing forward by little and little,
cease not continually to pass on further. Men are wont to debate upon this
matter: Two brothers are at deadly feude the one against the other, if I
preserve the one, have I profited the other, who will be sorry that his brother
has escaped with life? There is no doubt but that it is a benefit, although it
be against his will that receives the same: Even as contrary wise, he has not
given a benefit, that profited against his will.

CHAP. XX.
Call thou that (says he) a benefit wherewith he is offended and vexed?
many benefits have a harsh and distasteful appearance; as when we cut and
cauterize to heal, and imprison to amend. We ought not to respect whether a
man be sorry for a benefit received, but whether he ought to rejoice. The
coin is not bad, which a barbarous and ignorant person accepts not for
current and rightly stamped money. He hates the benefit and yet he receives
the same, if it be profitable unto him, and he that has given the same, has
done it to the end that it should be profitable: it makes no matter though a
man receive a good turn with an evil will: So to let us turn this the
contrary way: A man hates his brother, whose life imports and profits him
much, him have I slain. This action of mine is no benefit unto him, although
he say it is and rejoice thereat. Most traitorously does he hurt, who receives
thanks for doing harm. I do than see something is profitable and is therefore
a benefit, hurtful and therefore is no benefit. Behold I will give that which
is neither profitable nor hurtful, and yet it is a benefit. I have trauersed a
desolate place, and found some man's father stark dead, and have buried his
body, neither have I profited him that was slain (for what concerned it him
after what manner he were consumed?) neither was it profitable for his son,
for what could he gain hereby? I will tell you what he has gained, he has
discharged by my means a necessary and solemn office. I have done that to
his father: which he himself would have done, nay more, which in duty he
ought to do. Now if I did it not for common piety and humanities sake only, as
I might have buried any other dead man's body, but knew the carcass and thought
upon the son at the same time, and did it for his sake, then is it a benefit.
But if I bury a dead man that is unknown to me, no man is indebted to me for
this office, because it was but a point of public humanity. Some one will
say unto me: Why art thou so busy to ^nquire who it is to whom thou have done
a pleasure, as if thou would hereafter redemaund the same? There are some
that judge that it should never be claimed again, and allege these causes.
The unworthy receiver will not requite the same to be redemaunded, the
thankful and worthy receiver will of himself yield recompense. Besides if
thou have given to a good man, be not to earnest in clayming it, least in
demanding the same thou do him wrong; as if he would not have satisfied thee
of his own free will. If thou have given it to an evil man, have patience.
Corrupt not thy benefit with redemaunding the same, and of a courtesy make it
no debt. Besides, that which the law bids not to be redemanded, it
forbids. These things are true, as long as nothing urges me, as long as
fortune inforceth me nothing, I will rather crave then ask again. But if it
be to save my children^ lives: if my wife be in danger of hers, if the
liberty and good of my Country constrains me to go thither whither I would
not, I will command my bashfulnesse, I will protest that I have endured all
things before I would be enforced to demand succors at an ungrateful man's
hand. In brief, the necessit^e of receiving a good turn, shall overcome the
shame of claiming it, when therefore I employ a benefit upon a good man, I so
give it as if I would never redemand the same, except necessity enforce me:
but the law (says he) not permitting to demand, forbids to claim.

CHAP. XXI.
THere are many things which neither have law nor action, to which the custom
of humane life, more powerful then any law, gives entrance. No law commands
us to discover our friends secrets, neither does any law in like manner tie us
to keep promise and our word with our enemy. What law tyeth us to perform
that which we have promised to any man? yet will I justly complain of him that
has discovered my secret, and be displeased with him that has given me his
word, and has not kept it. But thou (says h^) make a debt of a benefit.
Nothing less: for I do not exact it, but redemand it; neither do I redemand
it, but admonish: neither shall my extremest necessity enforce me to this, to
come unto him with whom I shall be forced to use long contestation. Who so is
so far plunged in ingratitude, that he will not be content to be advertised
and admonished, I will let him passe^ neither will I think him worthy to be
enforced to be thankful. Even as the usurer raketh not upon those debitors,
whom he knows to have played the banckerouts, or to be so poor that nothing
is left them to lose that may make them ashamed: so will I ouerpasse some that
are publicly and obstinately thankelesse^ neither will I redemand a benefit
at any man's hands, but from him only from whom I shall not take away by force,
but freely receive it.

CHAP. XXII.
Many there are that neither know how to deny the good they have received,
nor to restore it when it is needful: who are not so good as the grateful,
nor so evil as the ungrateful: slack and idle debitors, yet not evil. There
is as great weakness in many men in not being able to limit the opportunity
of their satisfaction.
These will I not challenge, but admonish: and since they forget their duty, I
will make them remember themselves, so as they will presently answer me in this
sort: Parda^^^^, I pray you, in good faith I knew not that you had need hereof:
for ^ad I t^ought s^ much, I had offered i^ you of my self: I beseech you
account me not ungrateful, I remember well what kindness you have done unto
me. Why should I fear to make these men better to themselves, and to me also?
I will bind whomsoever I can from sinning, much more my friend from offending,
and especially against my self. I give him an other benefit, if I suffer him
not to be ungrateful, neither will I rudely vpbraid him with the good turns he
has had of me: but as mildly as I can will I only refresh the memory of them,
to the end he may have occasion to restore me some such pleasure: I will pray
him to do me a good turn, to the end he may understand that I do it to
redemand mine own. Now and then will I use sharp and bitter words, if I
conceive any hope that he may be amended: for a desperate person, who has lost
all shame I will not exasperate him, lest of an ungrateful man I make him mine
enemy. For if we remit and forbear to admonish sharply, and call on those
that are ungrateful, we shall make them more slow to requite our courtesies.
But some that may be amended, and who may be made good, if any thing touch
their conscience: shall we suffer them to be lost for want of admonition,
wherewith the father has sometimes corrected his son, and the wife recalled
and reclaimed her straying husband, and a friend refreshed the languishing
faith of his friend?

CHAP. XXIII.
SOme there are that so sleep, that they are not to be awaked by striking,
but by jogging. In like manner there are some that want not the will to yield
satisfaction, but they are too slack and slow in the performance thereof, let
us awaken it. Be not thou the cause that thy benefit be converted into an
injury. Thou should injury me, if thou would not redemand the pleasure,
which thou have done me, for this cause, that I might become ungrateful. What
if I know not what thou want? what if distracted by occupations, and
employed otherways, I have not observed the occasion? show me what I may, and
what thou would. Why dispairest thou, before thou triest me? why art thou
so hasty to loose both thy benefit and thy friend? whence know thou that I
will not, or I know not, or whither my mind or means be deficient; make
trial of me. I will advise and admonish him then, not bitterly, not openly,
but so modestly, that he may think that of himself he has called the matter
to memori^, and was not put in mind by me.

CHAP. XXIIII.
A Certain old Soldier, who had used some violence toward his Neighbors,
was drawn in question before Julius Caesar, and seeing himself ouer-charged,
and like to loose the process. CAESAR (says he) remember you not how you once
sprent your anckle in Spain near to Sucre; a River of Valentia? when C^sar
had answered him that he remembered it well, the Soldier continuing his
purpose, said thus: Do you remember likewise, that being couched under a Tree,
that gave but little shadow, and desirous to rest your self, to fly the heat
of the scortching Sun, in a barren and rockie soil, in which there was not
but that only Tree, that grew from amongst the craggy cliffes, there was one of
your Soldiers that spread his cloak under you. When Caesar had answered, yea
marry, why should I not remember it: for when I was nigh dead for thirst,
because I was not able to go to the next spring, by reason of my foot, I would
have crept thither upon all four, but that a Soldier of mine, a man both
stout and valiant, brought me water in his Helmet. Emperor (said this
Soldier) do you now know that man, and that helmet, if you see them. CAESAR
answered, that he knew not the Morion, but that he knew the Soldier very
well, and further said, (displeased, as I suppose, for that he interrupted the
pleading of the cause, to listen to that old story which he had told him.) I
am sure thou art not he. CAESAR (said the Soldier) I blame thee not, in that
thou have forgotten me, Or Munde^ara, a people of Andaluzia.
for when this was done, I was whole and sound, afterward I lost an eye at the
battle of Munda, certain splinters of my skull were taken out of my head,
neither would you know the Helmet if you should see it, for it was cleft in
pieces by the stroke of a Spanish Curtelax. Hereupon Caesar commanded that he
should not be troubled any further, and gave unto his Soldier those small
parcells of Land, through which the way lay, that made this strife betwixt him
and his neighbors.

CHAP. XXV.
WHat then? should he not re-challenge the benefit at the Emperors hands, whose
memory was confused through the multitude of his affairs? whose great fortune
in disposing of his army, suffered him not to remember and reward every
private Soldier? This is not to redemand a benefit, but to resume it again,
being ready at hand, and laid up in a good place, and yet if a man will have
it, he must stretch out his hand. I will therefore redemand the same, if I be
constrained to do it, either by necessity, or for his sake, of whom I must
require it. A certain familier of Tiberius Caesar, prete^ding some suit unto
him in the beginning of his Empire, began his speech thus: Sir remember you
not? to which he answered before he uttered any further tokens of their former
and ancient friendship, I remember not what I was. From such as this Prince
was, not only should a good man forbear to ask recompense of former
courtesies, but also he ought to desire and procure that he might forget them
utterly. He disdained the memory and knowledge of all those persons, who he
reputed either for his friends, or equals, before his Empire, his only desire
was tha^ they should respect that present fortune and authority, wherein he
was placed, that only would he have to be thought upon, that only to be spoken
of, he reputed his ancient friend for a busy Inquisitor. It is better to
redemand a pleasure thou have done in times past in time and place, then to
require and crave anew. Moderation of words is to be used, that the
ungrateful man, wha^soeuer cannot pretend to have forgotten them. If we lived
amongst men of science and conscience, we might hold our peace and exspect, and
yet it were better to give them notice of our affairs, and the estate of our
necessities. We pray unto the gods, who know all things, our prayers obtain
not that which we demand, they only advertise them of that which we would
entreat at their hands. That Priest which speaks in Homer, represents unto
the gods the honor which was done unto them: and those Altars which were
devoutly addressed, and dressed for them, to the end they might be favorable
to his petitions, and attentive to his prayers. It is a second virtue, both to
be willing, to be admonished, and to be able to entertain good aduertizements.
The mind is to be reigned softly this way and that way, few there are that are
perfectly governed by the same, but they that by honest aduertisements return
into the right way, hold the second place; and from these we ought not to take
the guide that conducteth them. The eyes that are shut have a sight, but
without use, which then grow in use, when the daylight which the gods send
us) calls them forth and awakneth them to perform their offices. Instruments
and tools lie by and serve no uses, except the workman move them, and employ
them in his labor: mean while there is a good will in his soul, but either
idleness or delight benummeth it, or the ignorance of his art makes him err.
The will is to be awakened, least it languish in error.
We ought therefore to amend our will, and not to suffer it through despite to
languish long time in error: but following the custom of Schoolmasters, who
instruct young children, we ought patiently to endure, and discreetly to pardon
them, if they have forgotten any thing through defect of memory. And even as
in telling them a word or two, they fashion them to construe their whole
lesson: so by some little admonition we ought to reclaim such as are
forgetful, and fashion them to acknowledge a Benefit.

LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE SIXTH BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
Again continues he his questions after the manner of CHRYSIPPVS. First he
enquireth whether a benefit may be taken away? he differently disputes
thereupon, yet concludes that the use thereof may be taken away, but not the
benefit it self. His second question is, whether we be indebted to him, who
either profited us willingly or ignorantly? he denies. His third is, whether
we be obliged to him that profited us for his own sake? if only for himself,
he denies it; but if for mine also, he admits it. He mixeth subtilties with
examples. The fourth is, whether it be lawful to wish another man an evil
turn, to the end thou may restore him his benefit? it is not lawful, and
he condemns it. He opens another way of restitution, even to those that are
happy, yea to Kings, by counsels, admonitions, and doctrines.

CHAP. I.
THere are some things (my Liberalis, the worthiest of men) which are only
drawn in question to exercise the spirit, and have no use in them. There are
other things also, which not only move delight, whilst they are disputed
upon, but after they are debated, are greatly profitable unto us. I will
present thee with all sorts of them. Thou may as it pleases thee advise me,
either whether I shall finish those that are begun, or that I present them
only on the Theater, for show and ostentation sake: and although thou
command them to be incontinently relieved, yet will there some profit arise
thereby: for although there are some things which are unnecessary to be spoken
of, yet it avails us somewhat to know them. I will therefore be at thy
disposition and beck, and shape my proceedings according to thy pleasure: some
will I debate upon more amply, other some will I cast out headlong from off
this Theater.

CHAP. II.
THe question is whether a benefit may be taken away. Some deny that it may,
for a benefit is nothing but an action, even as the gife is one thing, and the
giving another, and he that saileth one thing, and the Navigations it self
another thing. And although the sick man be not without sickness, yet is not
he that is sick and the sickness it self all one: so the benefit it self is
one thing, but that which comes to each one of us by the benefit, is another
thing. A benefit is a thing incorporeall, which cannot be frustrated, the
matter thereof is tossed hither and thither, and changes his master. When
therefore thou take the same away, Nature it self cannot undo those things
she has done. She stops the course of her benefits, but cutteth them not
off. He that dies, yet has lived, and he that has lost his sight, has
formerly seen. It may be brought to pass, that those things that are come to
us may not be, but that they may not have bin, it is impossible; but the part
of the benefit, and the most certain is that which was. Sometimes we hinder the
use and long possession of a benefit; the benefit it self cannot be r^zed out.
Though nature summon al her forces to this end, yet has she no power over
that which is past. Thou may take away the house thou gave me, the money
thou lendest me, the slave I bought, and whatsoever else, wherein the name of a
benefit consists, but the benefit it self is stable and immutable, no force
can effect this, that the one has not given, and the other has not received.

CHAP. III.
MARCUS ANTONIUS (as the Poet This was a noble Poet that wrote the Civil wars,
and commended by Ovid.
Rabirius sets it down) seeing his fortunes translated to Augustus, and
that no other refuge was left him, but the privilege of death, and that that
also (except he took hold of the present occasion) would quickly be taken from
him, cried out in my opinion most heroically. That only now I have,
Which I to others gave.
O how much might he have had if he would? These are the most assured riches
which will continue at one stay, in whatsoever inconstancy and leuitie of
humane fortune, which the greater they be, the less envy will they have. Why
art thou so sparing of that thou have, as if it were thine own? thou art but
Fortunes factor. All these things which thus puff us up, that emflame us with
pride, that seem to make us more then men, cause us to forget frailty. These
therefore which you keep within iron walls, with armed hands, these goods
which you have purchased with other men's bloods, and defended with your own,
for which you rigge forth whole nauies to stain the seas with blood, for which
you beleager Cities, and yet ignorant, what store of weapons Fortune has
prepared against those, who are opposed against her. These for which two
^m^itiou^ pretenders of Empire (the laws of affinity, friendship and
confed^^acie being broken) have so oftentimes caused the world to be so
crushed and confounded, are not yours; they are but as things in trust left in
your hands, and shall suddenly be translated to another master. All greatness
is transitori^, the perdurable good is least apprehended.
That enemy, from whom you have pillaged them, or some successor of his
enmity and hatred shall come and force them from thee. Ask thou me how thou
may make them thine own? I answer thee, by well bestowing them. Be
provident therefore in thy affairs, purchase unto thy self an assured
possession of those things which ca^ never be taken from thee: thy riches
shall not only be more secure, but also more honest: that which thou admirest
and prisest so much, that which in thy judgment makes thee rich and
powerful, as long as thou detainest it in thy hands, retains no other title
but the villainous name of avarice, as for example, thy house, thy slave, thy
money; but after thou ha^t given them, they are accounted and reckoned for
benefits.

CHAP. IIII.
THou confessest (says he) that sometimes we are not obliged and indebted to
him, of whom we have received a benefit: Ergo, it is taken from us. There are
many causes which discharge us of the obligation, whereby we are tied for the
good we have received, not for that it is violently taken from us, but because
it is corrupted by another means. A certain man defends me, being accused
and guilty of some capital crime, and afterward uses infamous violence to
my wife, and rauisheth her; he has not taken away the good that he did me,
but opposing an equal injury to the same, he discharges me of my debt; and
if he has hurt me more then he profitted me before, the good turn is not only
extinguished, but I have free liberty both to complain, and to revenge,
where, in comparison of the benefit, the injury ouer-weigheth it: so the
benefit is not taken away, but ouerpressed and drowned. What? are not some
fathers so hard hearted and wicked, that it is both lawful and rightful to
loath and shun them, and not to acknowledge them? have they therefore taken
from them that which they gave them? nothing less, but the impiety of
succeeding times, has taken away the commendation of every former office and
kindness: the benefit is not taken away, but only the thanks, which ought to be
acknowledged for the same, and it is brought to pass, not that I have it not,
but that I owe it not. If a man lend me money, and afterward burn my house,
his debt is satisfied by my damage; I have not paid him, and yet I owe him
nothing. Even so stands the case here: though a man has done me some
friendly good turn, though he has dealt with me somewhat liberally, yet if
afterward he many ways use me proudly, contumeliously and cruelly, he has
left me at that stay that I am, as free from him, as if I had never received
any thing at his hands, for the fault is his own, and he himself has
violated his own benefits. The Landlord cannot constrain his tenant to pay
his rent (although the deeds remain in force uncancelled) if he tread down
his corn, fell down his fruit trees, not because he has received that which
he couenanted, but for that he himself is the cause that his tenant cannot
satisfy him. So is the creditour oftentimes endamaged toward his debtor, if
he take more for some other pretext, then that which he lent did amount unto.
The Judge sits not between the creditour and debtor to say only this, Thou
have lent him money: what then? thou have driven away his cattle, murdered
his servant, taken possession of his land, which thou never payedst for; when
all these things shall be well considered of and valued: depart thou a debtor,
who came a creditour. There is therefore a just rating and valuation betwixt
benefits and injuries to be made. Oftentimes the bene^it remains, and we are
not obliged to satisfy the same, if he that gave it repented himself
afterward, if he say he was unhappy in that he gave the same, if when he gave
he sighed, or bent his brows, if he believe he has lost and not given: if he
has done it for his own profit, or (...) least not for mine? if he has not
ceased to insult, brag and boast every where, and make his benefit bitter and
distasteful to the receiver. The benefit therefore remains, although it be
not due, even as certain moneys are due, but not exacted, because the
creditor has no law to recover them.

CHAP. V.
THou gave a benefit, and afterward did an injury, there is both a
thanks due to the benefit, and a reward for the injury, for I owe him no
thanks, nor he me any punishment, the one satisfies the other. When we say, I
have satisfied his benefit, we say not thus, that we have restored that which
we received, but this for that; for to restore, is to give one thing for
another. Why not? because every payment restores not the same, but as much in
value: for we are said to have satisfied our debt, although we have paid silver
for gold, and although we pay no money at all, but either by assignement to
other, or by way of exchange we make our satisfaction. Me thinks thou tellest
me that I lose my labor: for what profits it me to know, whether that which
is not due remains still in obligation? These are but impertinent subtilties
of the Lawyers, who say that no man can acquire the possession or dominion of
an inheritance, but only the goods thereof, as if the heritage were ought
else, then those things which are in the inheritance? I had rather thou
should distinguish me this (which may be pertinent to the matter) namely,
when as the same man had done me a courtesy, and afterward offered me an
injury, whether I ought to requite his kindness and notwithstanding revenge
my self for the injury offered me, and make a several satisfaction, as it
were, for two different debts, or recompense the one with the other, and not to
take any more care of it, so as the benefit be taken away by the injury, and
the injury by the benefit. For I see that this is observed in the Courts of
pleas, what the resolution of your School is, you your selves know. The
actions are several, and conformably to the course of our pleadings, so
answerably are we dealt withal. For otherwise there should be a great
confusion in the Iudgement-seat and course of law: if he that should leave in
my custody goods or money in trust, should afterward steal from me, I should
enter my suit of felony against him, and contrariwise he plead against me,
for the money left in trust with me.

CHAP. VI.
THose examples (my Liberalis) which thou have proposed, are contained under
certain laws which we must needs follow, for one law is not confounded with
another, each one keeps his one way. As for the matter in trust, there is a
distinct action, so is there also for the theft. A benefit is not subject to
any law, only I that received the same, am the arbitrarie Judge thereof: I have
authority to compare together, how much good another man has done me, or
what damage I have received by him: whether I be indebted more unto him, or he
obliged more to me. In judging by law and ordinances I have not any power,
thither must we go, whither they lead us. But in matter of benefit, all the
power and privilege is mine own, and therefore I judge them, and separate not
the actions, I summon the benefits and injuries before one Judge: otherwise
thou should command me at one and the same time, to love and hate one and
the same person, to complain of him, and to give him thanks, which nature
cannot permit: nay rather by comparing the benefit and wrong together, I shall
see whether any thing be owing me of surplusage. Even as he that imprinteth
other lines aloft upon my writings, takes not away the former letters, but
only raceth and hides them. Even so an injury that succeeds a benefit,
blemisheth it so, that it cannot appear.

CHAP. VII.
THy countenance (to whose direction and beck I submitted my self) begins
to frown, and thou bendest thy brows upon me, as if I strayed from my
purpose, me thinks I hear thee say: Whether so far disioyned from the port,
Do thou upon thy right hand sail before?
Ply hitherwards, unto this haven resort,
And leave the maine, and love and like the shore.
Pardon me, I can keep no nearer. If therefore thou think that I have
satisfied and sufficiently debated on this matter: let us pass onward to the
other, and examine whether we be indebted to him that has done us a pleasure
against his will. I might speak this more plainly, but that the proposition
ought to be more confused, to the end that the distinction which follows
presently after, should show that we dispute both the one and other point: that
is to say, whether we are bound unto him that has procured our good, and meant
it not, and also whether we be beholding to him, that has done us good, and
knew it not. For if any man by compulsion has showed us any kindness, it is a
matter so manifest that he obliges us not, that there need no words to be
spent to this purpose. And the said question may easily be answered, and
whatsoever may b^e objected of the same nature, if we often convert our
thoughts to this general principle. That there is no benefit but that which is
accompanied with a good thought toward us; and such a thought and intent
likewise, as is both friendly and bountiful. And therefore we thank not the
rivers although they bear great ships, and with a large and perpetual
channel, fleet along to furnish us with commodities, and although wooing the
wondering eye, and full of dainty ^ish, they steal along and moisten our
fatned fields: neither will any man judge that he is indebted to Nilus, or
displeased therewith, if it has ouer-flowed and drowned his la^d, or too
slowly grown to ebb: neither does the wind befriend us, although it blow a
gentle and prosperous gale, nor the victuals we eat, although they be
profitable and wholesome. For he that properly, will give a benefit, must not
only profit me, but have a will to do me good. Therefore men are not indebted
to dumb beasts, yet how many has the swiftness of a horse delivered out of
danger? nor to trees, and yet how many troubled with heat has the shadow of
their branchie arms delivered and covered from the scortching Sun? what
concerns it me whither he that did me good, know not that he does it, or
be not able to know it, when both of them wanted will to do it? And what
difference is there, whither you command me to owe a benefit to a ship, or a
chariot, or a spear, or to such a one, who, as these, had no purpose to do
good, but was profitable unto me only casually?

CHAP. VIII.
A Man may receive a benefit unwittingly, but no man does good without knowing
of the same: Even as many men have been healed of their infirmities, by some
casual accident, and yet for all that they are no true remedies: As some men
have recovered their health by falling into a River in an exceeding cold day:
As a quartaine ague has been driven from some men by whipping, and a sudden
fright has disappointed the exspected hour of an ague, by fixing the
imagination on an other distasteful evil, and yet none of these, although they
have been the cause of recovery, can be said but to be a sovereign remedy,
so some men profit us while they would not, or rather because they will not do
us good, yet are we not indebted to them for the benefit. What if fortune has
altered their pernicious counsels, and drawn them to a better end? Supposest
thou that I am any ways bound unto him, whose hands striking at me, light upon
and hit mine enemy: who would have hurt me, except he had swarued? Oft-times
a witness whilst he manifestly forsweareth himself, has detracted from
their credit who were true witnesses, and has made the Judges to commiserate
the prisoner, supposing that it was but some slanderous circumuention and
conspiracy. Oft-times the very great power and authority of the adversary,
has delivered the delinquent out of the Judges hands, who would not condemn
him upon the credit and favor of the accuser, which otherways they had
convicted by the justice of the cause. Yet did not these give a benefit,
although they profited, for the question is, whereat the dart was aimed, not
where it lighted, and it is the mind, and not the event, which distinguishes
a benefit from an injury. Mine adversary, while^t he speaks contraries, and
offends the judge by his pride, and rashly dismisseth one of his best
witnesses, gives great advantage to my cause. I ask not whither he erred to
pleasure me, because his intention was to hurt me.

CHAP. IX.
VErily, to approve my self grateful, it behooves me to have a will to do
that which he has done: if he would that I should take it for a benefit, he
ought to have a will and intent. For what is more unjust then that man who
hates him, that has kicked him in a throng, or soiled him with dirt, or
thrust him thither, whither he would not? But what other thing is there that
may exempt him from the blame whereas there is an injury in the action, then
that he knew not what he did? The same thing that priuiledgeth the one from
being judged to have done injury, exempteth the other also from being thought
to have done a pleasure. It is the will that makes us either friends or
enemies. How many has sickness discharged from warfare? Some have been
let from being oppressed with the ruin of their own houses, by keeping
their day of appearance at the suit of their enemies. And some by shipwreck
have escaped the hands of Pirates, yet are we not obliged to these misfortunes
for any benefit, because casual events have no correspondencie with amity;
nor to our enemy, who would trouble us by process, and detain us under
arrest. It is no good deed that proceeds not from a good will, except he
that gave it acknowledge it. Has a man pleasured me and know not of it, I owe
him nothing? Did he do me good when he would have hurt me: I will do the like
to him.

CHAP. X.
LEt us return again to the first point: Thou will that (to the intent I
should be thankful) I should do somewhat, and yet he that did me kindness,
^ath done nothing. Let us speak now of the second. Thou will have me very
forward to gratify him willingly, although in the giving he had no good will
or intention to give. For what shall I say of the third, whose injury is
exchanged into a benefit? If thou will have me to owe thee a good turn, it is
not enough for thee to be only willing to do me good: but to make me
vnbeholding to thee, it is enough that thou meanst it not toward me. For the
bare will cannot make a benefit. But even as that should not be a benefit, if a
good and free will were abandoned by fortune; so likewise is it not a benefit,
if the will marches not before the fortune. For if thou will have me
beholding to thee, thou must not only do me good, but also thou must do it
with a will to profit.

CHAP. XI.
CLEANTHES uses this exampl^, I sent, says he, two (...) the Academie to
seek out Pl^to, and to bring him (...) one of them sought him out in all the
Galleries and Porches, where he was wont to walk, and ran through all other
pl^^^s wherein he had any hope to find him out, and at length b^ing weary
with his way, and frustrate of his hope, returned home. The other stood gasing
at the next Iugler, or mounte-banck, or whilst he wandreth up and dow^ and
plaieth with his fellows and companions, sees Plato passing by, and found him
whom he sought not. I, says Cleanthes, will commend that Boy who performed that
he was commanded, to his uttermost and will chastise that other who was more
fortunate in laziness. It is the will that is the lawful Mistress of these
actions, the condition whereof must be considered, if thou will have me to be
thy debtor. It is a small matter to wish a man well, except thou pleasure him;
It is a small matter to have pleasured, except thou had a will to do it. For
put ease a man had a will to give, yet gave not, undoubtedly I have his heart,
but not his benefit which consummateth and perfecteth both the thing and the
will. Even as I owe him nothing that would have trusted me with his money but
did not: so will I be a friend, but not obliged to him, that would have done
me a courtesy but could not: and I shall have a will to do him good, because
he had a will to pleasure me. Notwithstanding if fortune be so favorable unto
me, as that I may have the means to give him any thing, it shall not be to
gratify his courtesy but to give him a benefit. It shall be his duty to yield
me thanks, and the beginning of the debt shall be derived from me.

CHAP. XII.
I Perceive now already what thou meanest to demand: thou need not to tell
me, thy looks express thy thoughts. Are we indebted in any sort to him
(say thou) who, to profit himself, has done us a pleasure? For of this
thing oft-times I hear thee complain, that there are some men, who reckon
that kindness to be done unto another, which they give to themselves. I will
satisfy thee herein, my Liberalis: but first of all I will divide this little
question into two parts, and separate that which is just from that which is
unjust. For there is a great difference whether a man gives us a benefit for
his own sake, or for our behoof, or for his own and ours. He that solely
respects his own commodity and profit, and profits us notwithstanding
(because otherwise he cannot further himself) seems, in my judgment, to be
all one with him who prouides prouender and sommer-fodder for his cattle; or
him that feeds his captives liberally, to the end they may be the better
sold; or him that fa^^ens and curries his Oxen, to make them more vendible; or
that Master of skirmish and defense, who exercises his family of Fencers with
great care, and adorneth them most diligently, to the end they may get him
^^^ntenance. There is a great difference (as Cleanthes says) betwixt a
benefit and a negotiation or bargaining.

CHAP. XIII.
Again, I am not so neglectfull or evil, as to forget my acknowledgement
toward him, who in being profitable unto me, was as provident and careful to
procure his own good. For I do not exact this^ that without respect of his own
estate, he should advance mine: but rather I wish that the benefit which is
given me, should most of all redound to his profit that gave me the same. As
long as he that gave the same had a respect unto two in giving it, and divided
the same betwixt himself and me, although he for the most part possessed the
some, if he admit me as a co-partner with him, if he thought on two: I am not
only ungrateful but unjust, except I rejoice that he found profit by that
which was profitable to me. It is an effect of excessive malice, not to call
that a benefit, except it be such a thing as returns the giver thereof some
incommoditie. I will answer him after another manner, who gives the benefit
for his own sake: Why will thou say that thou have rather profited me, then I
pleasured thee? Put case (says he) that I cannot otherwise obtain a
Magistraci^, except I redeem ten captive citizens, amongst a number of others
that are in thraldom and servitude: shall thou owe me nothing when I have
delivered thee from servitude and bonds? yet will I do this for mine own
sake. To this I answer: Herein do thou somewhat for thine own sake, and
somewhat for mine. It is for thine own sake that thou redeemest me, and for my
sake that thou chusest me. For it is enough for thee in regard of thine own
profit, to have redeemed any whatsoever. I therefore am indebted to thee, not
because thou have redeemed me; but because thou chosest me: for thou might
have attained as much by another man's redemption, as thou do by mine. Thou
diuidest with me the profit of the thing, and make me partner of that benefit
which should profit two. Thou preferrest me before others, thou do all this
for my sake: if therefore the redemption of ten Captives should make thee
Praetor, and we were only ten Captives, none of us should any ways be indebted
unto thee, because thou should have nothing that were with-drawne from thy
profit, that thou might impart to any of us. I am no malicious interpreter
of a benefit, neither desire I that the pleasure should redound only to my
self, but to thy self likewise.

CHAP. XIIII.
WHat therefore (says he) if I had commanded all your names to be cast into
lots, and your name amongst the number of such as were to be ransommed, were
admitted to pass, should thou owe me nothing? vndo^btedly I should be
indebted unto thee but very little. And what this is I will let thee know, thou
do somewhat for my sake, because thou admittest me to the fortune of
redemption^ because my name was registered amongst the rest. I owe this to
fortune that my name was drawn amongst the rest, to thee that it might be
drawn. Thou gave me an entrance to a benefit, the greater part whereof I owe
unto fortune^ but the ability I had to be indebted to fortune, that owe I to
thee. As for those who set sail on those courtesies they do to others, I will
wholly ouer-passe them: because they respect not to whom they give, but for
what advantage they gave, and such a benefit as this retourneth every way to
his hands that gave the same. A certain man has sold me corn. I cannot live
except I buy the same, yet am I not obliged to him for my life because I bought
the same: neither estimate I how necessary it was without which I could not
live, but how freely it was bestowed, which I should not have had except I had
bought it. In the conueyance whereof unto me, the merchant thought not how much
succors he should bring me, but how much profit he should breed unto
himself. That which I bought I owe not.

CHAP. XV.
IN this manner (says he) thou will say that thou art no ways indebted to the
Physician, except it be for some small fee, nor to thy master, because thou
have paid him some money: but amongst us we yield them much reverence, and
offered them more love. To this I answer, that there are some things more
precious then we prize them. Thou buyest at the Physicians hands an inestimable
treasure, to wit, thy life and health: from thy master and instructor in good
Arts, liberal studies, and the certanie ornaments and riches of thy mind. To
these therefore we pay not the price of that they give us, but the reward of
their labors, because they serve us, and abandon their own particular
affairs to intend ours. They receive the reward, not of their merit, but of
their travail. Another answer may be given to this, more answerable unto
truth, whereof hereafter I will entreat, when I have first of all made it
apparent how this may be disproued. Certain things (says he) are more worth
then they were sold for, and therefore although they are bargained for and
bought, thou owe me somewhat over and besides for them. First of all, what
skilleth it how much they are worth, when as both the buyer and seller are
agreed upon the price? Again, he sold it not at his own price and valuation,
but at thine: it is more worth (says he) then it was sold for; but it could
not be sold for more. And the time is it that gives the price unto all things,
when thou have praised them to the uttermost, they are worth but as much as may
be gotten for them; besides, he owes nothing to the seller, that has bought
it cheap: moreover, although these things are more worth, yet is it no thanks
to thee, considering that the estimation of these things depends not upon the
use and effect of them, but upon the custom and scarcity of them. What pay
do thou allot him that crosses the seas, and having lost the sight of land,
cutteth through the midst of the waves an assured and direct course, and
foreseeing future tempests, even then when there is greatest appearance of
security, commands suddenly to strike the sails, to stoop the top-sailes,
and to be addressed to endure the sudden assault of a storm? yet pay we the
reward of so great a merit, no otherwise then with an ordinary fare. How much
valuest thou a lodging in a desert, a sheade in a shower, a stoue or fire in
cold weather? yet know I how much I shall pay for this, when I come to mine
Inn. How greatly befriendeth he us, that keeps our house from falling, that
vnderproppeth it with great cunning, and vpholdeth it in the air, being cle^t
and winde-shaken from the very foundation: yet neither the supporting nor
vndersetting cost me very much. The wall of a City keeps us in safety from
our enemies, and the sudden incursion of thieves. Yet is it well known what
wages the Mason deserved by day, that builded those fair Towers and strong
Bulwarks, that were raised for the public security of the inhabitants.

CHAP. XVI.
IT were an endless matter for me, if I should gather together those plenty
of examples, whereby it might appear that there are great and precious things,
which cost us very little. What then? why is it that I owe some great matter to
my Physician and Master, and fail in the satisfaction of that which they have
worthily deserved? Because, of a Physician and Schoolmasters they become our
friends, and oblige us not by the Art they sell us, but by their gracious and
familiar good will. To the Physician therefore (who does no more then touch my
purse, and numbreth me amongst one of those his patients, whom he ordinarily
walks to, and visits, prescribing me without any particular affection, what
I ought to do, and what I ought to eschew:) I owe no more, and am no whit
indebted: because he visits me not as a friend, but for that I had enjoined
him to come unto me: neither have I cause to reverence my Master, if he has
made no more account of me, then of one of his ordinary scholars, if he
thought me not worthy of private and peculiar care; if he have never settled
his thoughts upon me, and when generally he imparted his knowledge to the rest
of his scholars, I rather gathered from him, then learned of him. What is the
cause then, why I should owe so much unto these? Not because that which they
sold is more worth then we bought, but because in particular they have given us
something ouer-plus. This Physician bestowed more labor on me then he was
bound to do, he had more care of me then of his reputation and credit, he not
only contented not himself to prescribe me remedies, but also vouchsafed to
apply and minister them. In the mean while he sat carefully by me, and
succored me, and prevented the suspected time, and rigor of my access, no
office distasted him; no pain disliked him, if he had seen me bemoane my
self, he was sorrowful. Amongst all those that called him, he had a
particular care of me, he implied no other time in visiting the rest of his
sick patients, then such wherein my infirmity remitted and gave him
opportunity. To this man I am not tied, as to a Physician, but as to a friend.
Again, that other Schoolmasters took great care and pains in teaching and
instructing me; and besides those lessons and common lectures which he
communicated to all particularly, he reformed me in some points of importance,
he quickened my spirits by good exhortation, and sometimes by praises he
animated me in my studies, and sometimes by admonitions discussed my sloth.
Furthermore (if I may so speak it) he by the hand of his industry drew out
and whetted my hidden and heavy wit, too much drowned in the prison of my
body, neither lingeringly and subtly dispensed he his knowledge, to the end
I might have longer use and need of him, but desired, if he might, to
communicate unto me at one instant, all that which he knew. Ungrateful am I,
except I love him as one of my most grateful and truest friends.

CHAP. XVII.
WE allow always somewhat (over and above the ordinary rate we buy at) to
merchants and sailers (even in the most mechanique and basest trades and
offices) if we perceive some extraordinary diligence in the service we employ
them in, and to the master of a ship and workman of a base price, how base
soever they be, although they be but day-hirelings, we allow some over plus
above his pay. Unthankful then is he, that in the best Arts, which either
preserve or adorn man's life: that supposes himself to be no more indebted,
then for that he couenanted. Add hereunto that the tradition of such studies
unites and allieth minds together, when this is done, both the Physician and
the Schoolmasters have received the reward of their labor, but their
affections and good minds rest yet unsatisfied.

CHAP. XVIII.
WHen Plato had crossed a certain river in a ferry-boate, and the ferry-man
had exacted nothing for his passage, supposing that it had been done for his
honors sake, he said unto the ferry-man, that Plato ought him a good turn; but
anon after perceiving, that with no less diligence he freely transported many
others: Friend, said he, thou have now discharged me of that obligation,
whereby I held my self tied and bound unto thee. For to the end to make me thy
debtor, for any thing thou give me, thou art bound not only to give it me,
but to give it me solely, as to my self: For that which thou give unto a
multitude, thou have no reason to redemand at a private man's hand. How then? Is
there nothing due for this? nothing, as for one in particular, I will pay with
all that I owe thee withal.

CHAP. XIX.
THou deniest then (says he) that he gives me a benefit, that freely and
without recompense transported me over the river of Poe. True it is he does me
some good, but he gives me no benefit, for he does it for his own sake, or
at leastwise not for mine. In sum, neither does he himself judge that he
gives me a benefit, but he does it either for the Commonweals sake, or for
his neighbors sake, or for his own ambition sake; and for this expects he
some certain other commodity, then that which he is to receive from every
private person. What then (says he) if a Prince should give immunities to all
Frenchmen, As Claudius did at that time, Seneca wrote this.
and discharge all Spaniards of paying tribute, should not every one of them in
this case be particularly bound unto him? Why should they not be obliged?
undoubtedly they cannot be otherwise, yet not for a particular, but for a part
of a public benefit. But (say thou) he never thought on me. At that time
when he did so much good unto all men; he had no particular intent to give me
the City, neither addressed he his purposes to my profit: wherefore then
should I be obliged to him in any thing, who no ways thought on me at such
time as he was to act that which he intended. First when as he bethought
himself to do good unto all the Gauls, he though^ also of me, because I was a
Gaul, and comprehended me, although not by my proper name, yet under the
public name of the nation. Again, I shall not be tied unto him, as if the
good were properly and particularly mine, but as one that partaked his favor
amongst the comminaltie. I will not satisfy as in mine own behalf; but I
will contribute as for the common good of my country.

CHAP. XX.
IF a man l^nd a sum of money to my country, I will not say that I am
indebted to him, neither will I acknowledge it as my debt, although I sued for
a public office, neither also if I were sued as a debtor; yet will I
contribute my part in payment of this debt. In like sort, I deni^ that I am
debtor for the favor that is done unto all my nation, because he gave it me,
yet not for me; and in such manner gave it me, that in giving the ^ame he knew
not whether he gave it me, yea or no: yet know I that I must pay some portion
thereof, because the good by one means or other appertains to me, and tyeth
me to requite it. It must be done for me that shall oblige m^. In the same sort
(says he) neither owe thou any thing to the Moon or Sun; for they are not
moved for thy sake: but whereas they are moved to this end, that they may
preserve all things, they move for me also, for I am a part of the Universe.
Moreover, our condition and theirs are different: for ^e that profits me, to
the intent that by my means he may further himself, gave me no benefit,
because he made me the instrument of his profit. But the Sun and Moon,
although they do us good, yet to this end profit they us not, that by our means
they should profit themselves: for what can we be-friend or further them in?

CHAP. XXI.
I Shall know (says he) that the Sun and Moon have a will to profit us,
if they had the power not to be willing: but they cannot surcease to stay
their motion, n^yther can they abridge or intermit their accustomed travel.
See by how many ways this may be refelled. A man is not therefore the less
willing, because he cannot be unwilling, nay, rather it is a great argument of
a firm will, not to be able at any time to change. A good man cannot choose but
do that which he does: for he shall not be a good man except he do it.
Therefore a good man bestows no b^nefit, because he does that which he ought
to do, but he cannot do otherwise then that which he ought. Besides, there is
much di^ference whether thou sayest^ He cannot choose but do this because he is
compelled: or, He cannot be unwilling to do it. For if he mus^ ^^edes do it, I
am not tied unto him for his benefit^ but to him that compell^d him^ B^t if the
necessity of his willingness proceed of this, because he has nothing better
that he can will, then is it he himself that compels himself. And so,
look for what thing I should not have been beholding to him, as compelled by
others for the same; shall I be beholding to him, as to the compeller of
himself. This will make them cease (says he). I pray you think a little on
this matter: What man is he, so void of understanding, that will deny that it
is no willingness in him that acts any thing, which is not accompanied with
danger of impediment in performance, or altering it self to the contrary,
seeing that on the other side no man may of right seem so willing, as he whose
will is so assuredly certain, that it remains eternal and immutable? If he
be willing, that may anon after be unwilling: shall not he be thought to be
willing, who is of that nature that he cannot be unwilling?

CHAP. XXII.
But (says he) let them stand still, and leave to move if they can. It is as
much as if thou said, that these stars which are separated by so great
distances the one from the other, that are ranged in so goodly an order; to
conserve and intertaine the whole world in his entire, should abandon their
places, that the Planets being troubled with a sudden confusion, should
interchecke and come one against an other, and having broken the repose and
concord of all things: that the heaven it self should fall into an irreparable
ruin, that the course of so violent a swiftness, which had promised to be
never interrupted, should stay in the midst of his way: that the heaven and
stars, that moved themselves of late, the one after the other, in so just a
measure, that equally and by agreeable seasons tempered the whole world; should
be burned and consumed in a sudden flame: that so great a variety of all things
should be dissolved and abolished, that they should return into one, that the
fire should seize all, that afterward a darksome and heavy night should
obscure this world, and that finally a bottomless gulf should devour and
swallow this great n^mber of the gods. We must not admit an evil so
pernicious; it must not cost so dear to prove thee a liar. The stars have
power to give thee all this in d^spite of thy self: they finish their courses
and ordinary reuolutions for thy great profit, although there be another more
great and original cause that moves them.

CHAP. XXIII.
FVrthermore add thou this, that there is not any foreign cause that may
constrain the gods: their eternal and inviolable will is that which s^rueth
them for a law: they have established that which they intend not to alter.
They therefore cannot seem to do^ any thing against their will: for whatsoever
cannot end or cease to be, they would have to continue still; neither do the
gods repent them ever of their first counsels. Undoubtedly they cannot stand
still, or run a contrary course, yet not for all this do they keep their
wonted course out of weakness, because their own force keeps them in the
same purpose still; yet observe they not the same of weakness, but because it
becomes them not to alter or err from the best course, and because they have
determined so to go and shape their courses. Most c^rtaine it is, that amongst
their first ordinances they established, in disposing all things, they likewise
had a care of us, and conceived some special regard of man. They therefore
cannot s^eme to shape their courses for their own cause only, and to
accomplish their own works for their own selves, because men also are a part
of their work. We are then obliged to the Sun and Moon, and the other powers
of heaven for the good they do us. For although they have more great ends for
which they rise and set then only for us, yet aiming at greater, they help us
also purposely. And for this cause we are obliged unto them, because we did not
light upon their benefits without their knowledge, to whom they gave them, but
they knew certainly that we should receive them. And although their intentions
be more eminent, and the fruit of their travel more great and pertinent, then
to nourish and conserve mortal things: yet so it is, that in the first
beginning of the world, they have employed their thoughts on our profit, they
have pre^ixed such ordinances and laws unto the heavens, that it evidently
appears what care they had of us, and that it was neither their least nor
last. We owe our parents honor and reverence, yet many of them matched and
married without desire to b^get children. The gods cannot seem to be ignorant
of that they ought to do, whereas they have suddenly provided us of nourishm^nt,
and all other things that are necessary for us; neither carelessly created they
them, for whom they created so many things. For Nature minded us before she
made us: neither are we a work of little importance, that she could make us by
chance, as doing something else. See how great a power she has given into our
hands: Consider how the condition of command, which she has given to man, is
not only over men. See what liberty our bodies have, to wander and trauerse
over many places. See how she limiteth them not within any certain bound of
land, but sends them into all places, yea, into every corner of the world.
Consider the confidence of humane understanding: see how they only either know
or seek the gods^ and raising their minds aloft, they converse with, and
contemplate those divine influences continually. Believe then that man is not a
rash or unthought upon work. Nature amongst her greatest works has nothing
wh^rof she may more vaunt, or to whom she may vaunt of her workmanship, or that
she would replenish with more great glory. How great a madness is this to
call the gods in question about their own blessings? How can he be
thankful to them, whose courtesies he cannot requite without charge: who
denies that he has received them from the gods, which will both give
always and receive never? What refractary and perverse mind has he, that
will not be grateful or beholding to any, because his liberality extends to
such a one, as denies the good that is given him, and to term the
continuation an immutable order of their benefits, an argument of one that
gives of necessity? and to say^ I care not for his courtesies, let him keep
them to himself, who requir^th them at his hands? And an infinite sort of
other such like purposes, proceeding from an impudent mind, which thou may
pack and number with these: yet shall not he deserve the less at thy hands,
whose beauty redounds unto thee, even whilst thou deniest it, and of whose
benefits even this is one of the greatest, that he is ready to relieve thee,
even then when thou complainest most against him.

CHAP. XXIIII.
See thou not how parents in their childrens most tender infancy, constrain
them to suffer those things patiently, which are most healthful for them? With
diligent care they nourish their tender bodies, and still them when they cry,
and swathe them when they struggle; and lest continual slacknesse might make
them grow awrie, they bind them straight to make them grow right: when their
infancy is past, they present them liberal sciences, threatening them with the
rod if they be negligent: and finally, when they grow to more maturitie,
they teach them to be sober, and counsel them to do nothing that should breed
their shame: they fashion them in good manners, and if their youth as yet be
not liable to obedience, forcibly they constrain that by awe which counsel
could not effect: at last, having attained to full growth and maturity, and to
have a feeling of their own government, if either by intemperance or fear,
they reject the counsels and remedies, which are given them for their profit,
they use greater violence and servitude. So that the greatest benefits which we
receive of our parents, is at such time as we know them not, or when we refuse
them wholly.

CHAP. XXV.
TO this sort of ungrateful men, and such as refuse benefits, not because they
desire them not, but for that they would not remain indebted, they are like,
who contrariwise will be ouer-gratefull: who wish that some adversity and
mishap may befall those to whom they are obliged, to the end they may have an
argument and occasion, to let them know how neeedfull they are of the benefit,
and what desire they have to make restitution. The question is, whether such
sort of men do well to desire and wish the same, and whether their desire be
honest? These kind of thankful men, in my judgment, resemble them very much,
who, in^lamed with lascivious love, do wish their lover banishment, to the end
they might accompany her in her distress and departure: or wish to see her in
necessity, to the end they might relieve her misery: or to see her sick, to
the end they might sit by her, and tend her: and finally, which under
profession of love, do wish whatso^uer her enemy would have wished unto her.
Assuredly the issue of this foolish love and capital hate are wel-neare all
one. Into this very inconvenience do they fall, who wish that their friends
were in misery, to the end they might afterward relieve them, and make way to
bene^iting, by doing them wrong, whereas it w^r^ much better utterly to desist,
then to seek occasion to do a courtesy by means of wickedness. What if a
Master of a Ship should pray the gods to send them cruel storms and
tempests, that by the danger his Art might be held more gracious? What if an
Emperor should beseech the gods, that a great multitude of enemies might
besiege his camp, and with sudden assault fill full the Trenches, Non sunt
facienda mal^, vt inde cuenirin^ bona.
and raze down the Rampires, and (to the great amaze of his army) advance
their colors even in the very ^ntrance of his Fortifications, to the end he
might receive more honor and glory, in succouring his army in this great
danger, and at that very instant, when his whole camp imagined the field to
be lost, and the army discomforted: all these convey their benefits by a
detestable way, who call the Gods to plague him, whom they themselves would
profit, and to hate them, whom they themselves would relieve. Inhumane and
perverse is the nature of this grateful mind, which wishes evil unto him,
whom he cannot honestly forsake.

CHAP. XXVI.
MY wish (says he) hinders him no ways, because I wish the peril and
remedy both at once. This is as much as if thou said that thou have
committed some small fault, but that thou sinnest lesser, then if thou
should wish him danger without remedy. It is mere wickedness to plunge a
man into a river, to the end to draw him out, to ruinate that thou may
reedifie, to imprison, that thou may deliver. The end of an injury is no
benefit, neither is it a part of kindness to withdraw that from one, which he
himself had laid upon him. I had rather thou should not wound me, then that
thou should not heal me. Thou may deserve my thanks, if thou healest
me, because I am wounded, but not if thou wound me to the end I may be healed:
the scarre never pleased, but in comparison of the wound, for the healing
whereof we so rejoice, that we had rather not to have been wounded: if thou
should wish this unto him, that had never done the good turn, the vow were
unhuman, but how much more inhumane were it to wish it him, to whom thou art
indebted for a courtesy.

CHAP. XXVII.
I Wish that (says he) at one and the same time I may yield him some succor.
First, that I may prevent thee in the midst of thy wish; thou art already
ungrateful. I hear not as yet, what thou intendest to do for him, yet know I
well, what thou would he should endure: Thou wishest that care, fear, or
some greater mischief should befall him, thou desire that he may want help,
and this is against him. Thou desire that he may need thy help; this is for
thee, thou will not succor him, but pay him satisfaction. He that hastes the
matter thus, would himself be paid, not pay. So that the only thing that might
seem honest in thy vow, is dishonest and ungrateful, to wit, not to be willing
to owe any thing. For thou desire not, that thou may have ability to
requite a courtesy, but that he may have need to implore thy help. Thou
make thy self his superior, and (which is a heinous wickedness in thee)
thou castest him down at thy feet, that has deserved well at thy hands. How
much better is it to owe with an honest-good will, then to pay by an evil
means? If thou should deny that thou have received, thou should sin
less, for he should lose nothing more then he had given. But now thy intent
is, to bring him under thy subjection, even with the loss of his own
fortunes, and to be drawn to that disaster by the change of his estate, that
he must lie lower then his own benefit. Will thou that I report thee for a
grateful man? Wish it in his presence, to whom thou will yield profit. Termest
thou this a wish, which is as well divided between a friend, as an enemy?
which undoubtedly an adversary or enemy would have made, if the latter points
only were excepted? Mortal enemies also have wished, that they might surprise
certain Cities, to the end they might preserve them, and to overcome some
enemy of theirs, to the end they might pardon them: neither therefore are
their vows other then hostile, in which, that which is most courteous and
calm, succeeds cruelty. To conclude, what kind of vows iudgest thou them
to be, which no man would wish less prosperous unto thee, then he for whom
thou vowest them? Thou dealest most injuriously with him, to whom thou wishest,
that the Gods should hurt, to the end he may be helped by thee; and impiously
also with the Gods themselves, for thou put over the cruelty to the^, and
reseruest the humanity to thy self. Shall the Gods be injurious, to the end
thou may be courteous? If thou should suborne an accuser, whom afterward
thou would remove, if thou should entangle him, in some suit of law, to
the end thou might deliver and discharge him thereof, there is no man that
would grow doubtful of thy impiety: what difference is there, whether this
thing be attempted by fraud or by vow? saving that thou seek more powerful
adversaries for him. Thou can not say, what wrong have I done unto him? Thy
vow is either fruitless or injurious, nay rather it is wrongful, although it
be not successful. Whatsoever thou effectest not, it is Gods mercy, but
whatsoever thou wishest is mere injury. The matter is plain enough. We
ought no otherwise to be displeased with thee, then if thou had effected it.

CHAP. XXVIII.
IF vows (says he) had been any ways available, they had prevailed in
this, that thou should be in safety. First of all, thou wishest me an
assured peril, under an uncertain help. Again, suppose both are certain,
yet that which hurts is foremost. Furthermore, thou know the condition of
thy vow: A tempest has surprised me, uncertain of either haven or help. How
great a torment supposest thou that it was for me to have wanted them, although
at length I recovered them? to have feared, although I be preserved; come to
trial, and drawn in question, although I were acquitted. There is no end of
fear so pleasing, that a solid and unshaken security is not more acceptable:
wish that thou may restore me a benefit when I have need; not that I may
have need. If that thou wishest, were in thy power, thou thy self would
have done it.

CHAP. XXIX.
HOw far more honest is this vow? I desire he should continue in that estate
wherein he might always distribute benefits, and never need them. Let the
means and matter which he so bountifully uses in giving and assisting, so
follow and second him, that he never want occasion of giving benefits; or
repent him of that he has given. Let the multitude of grateful men stir up
and provoke his nature (of it self prone enough to humanity) to mercy and
clemency. Whom let him never want to befriend, nor have need to try. Let him
be merciless to none, and have no need of being reconciled to any man. Let
Fortune persevere to be so equally favorable unto him, that no man may be
grateful unto him, but in mind and acknowledgement. How far more just are
these vows, which defer thee not in expectation of any occasion, but make
thee presently grateful? For what lets us to be thankful to those that are
in prosperity? How many means are there, whereby we may yield satisfaction to
those to whom we are obliged, although they be happy? Faithful counsel,
diligent conversation, familiar speech and pleasing, without flattery, ears
diligent, if he would deliberate, secret, if he would trust; familiarity in
conversation. Prosperity never raised a man so high, that by so much the
rather he had not want of a friend, by how much he had affluence in all things.

CHAP. XXX.
THis hateful and damnable occasion is every way to be detested and driven
far from us. Must thou needs have the Gods displeased, to the end thou may
be grateful? And understand thou not, that hereby thou sinnest more,
because he to whom thou art ungrateful has the better fortune? Propose unto
thy mind imprisonment, chains, stincke, servitude, war, poverty; these are
the occasions of thy vow: if any man has couenanted with thee, by these he is
dismissed. Why rather would thou not have him mighty and blessed, to whom
thou art most indebted? For what (as I said) forbids thee to be grateful
even unto those that are endued with the happiest estate, whereas thou have
ample and several matter and occasion to express thy self? What that men pay
debts even unto those that are the wealthiest? neither will I constrain thee
against thy will. Truly, although most powerful felicity has excluded all
things, yet will I show thee what thing it is that greatest estates are poorest
in, and what things are deficient to those that possess all things. Truly
such a one that will speak truth, that will vindicate a man astonished and
amazed amongst flatterers, and drawn from the knowledge of trut, h by the very
custom of hearing rather pleasing then profitable counsels, from the company
and consent of deceitful men. See thou not how extinguished liberty and
faith transformed to servile obsequiousness, drive them headlong to their
ruin, where no man persuades or disswadeth him according to his conscience,
but each man strives who may flatter most, and the only office and contention
of all his friends is, who can deceive him most pleasingly. They knew not their
own forces, and whilst they suppose themselves to be so great, as they hear
they be, they brought upon themselves unnecessary wars, and such as should
hazard their whole estates, they break the true and necessary concord, and
feeding there own wrathful spleen, which no man revoked, they drew many men's
blood, being at last like to lose their own; whilst they seek to get
uncertainties for certainties; and think it no less disgraceful to be
persuaded, then to be overcome, and suppose those things to be perpetual,
which being brought to the highest do most of all stagger. They ouer-turned
great kingdoms upon themselves and theirs, neither understood they in that
stage glistering both with vain and transitory goods, from that time forward
that they should expect very great adversities; since when they could hear
nothing that was true.

CHAP. XXXI.
The ruin of greatness in the falsehood of flatterers.
WHen Xerxes proclaimed war against Greece, there was no one but enkindled and
incited his proud and forgetful mind, to what fickle and frail things he
trusted. One said that they would not endure the first message of the war,
and that upon the first rumor of his approach, they would turn their backs.
Another that it was not to be doubted, that not only Greece would be overcome
by that huge multitude, but that it might be overwhelmed: that it was more to
be feared, lest they should find their Cities desert and desolate, and the
vast solitudes left to them, and the enemies flying, not having no opposite
whereon to employ his so puissant power. Another, that the whole world was not
sufficient for him, that the seas were to narrow for his Navy, his camp for
his soldiers, the fields to embattell his cauellerie, nay scarce the heaven
large enough to contain the shafts that should be darted from every hand. When
after this manner many things were tossed and talked of on every side, which
incited the man, too much enraged and besotted with esteem of himself.
Demeratus the Lacedemonian was only he that said, Profitable perdiction of
succeeding misery.
that that very multitude so disordered and so mighty, which was so pleasing
unto him, was most of all to be feared by him that conducted them, because they
were rather combersome then strong, that over great things can hardly be ruled,
neither endures that long, which cannot be governed. Presently, said he, upon
the first encounter, the Lacedaemonians will come and present themselves unto
thee upon the first mountain, that thou would pass, and will make thee
know what they are: Three hundred soldiers shall make stand these so many
thousand men; they shall plant themselves strongly in the passages, and defend
the straits committed to their charge, and stop them up with their bodies:
all Asia shall not remove them from their places. A few men shall sustain so
great affront of war, and the charge almost of all mankind that intends to
rush in upon them. When Nature changing her laws, has made thee pass into
Greece, thou shall stick in the strait, and shall esteem thy future damages,
when as thou shall think how much the straits of Thermopolis cost thee. Thou
shall know that thou may be put to flight, when understand that thou
may be stayed. Happily in diverse places they will give thee passage, and
retire, as if carried away after the manner of a torrent, whose first forces
ouer-floweth with great terror, afterward they shall muster and charge thee
on every side, and shall ouerpresse thee with thine own power. True it is that
is said, that thy show of war is greater then these regions can contain,
which thou intendest to conquer. But this thing is against us: for this very
cause will Greece overcome thee, because she is not able to contain thee, and
thou can not use thy whole self. Moreover which is the only safeguard of
things) thou can not prevent or be present at the first assaults, neither
second those that begin to retreat and decline, neither sustain and confirm
those things that fall to ruin: Thou shall be vanquished long before thou
shall perceive thy self to be overcome. Furthermore, thou art not therefore to
suppose that thine army is invincible for this cause, because the number of
them is unknown, even unto him who is their Leader. There is nothing so great
that cannot perish; and though other occasions wanted, yet would the owner
thereof be the cause of his own destruction. The things that Demeratus
foretold came truly to pass. He that thought to enforce both heaven and
earth, and he that changed whatsoever withstood him, was driven to a stand by
three hundred soldiers. And so Xerxes being defeated and overthrown on every
side through all Greece, began to learn how much difference there was betwixt a
multitude and an army. Xerxes therefore being more miserable in his shame then
in his loss, gave Demeratus thanks, for that he alone had told him the truth,
and permitted him to require what he would: he desired that he might enter
Sardis, the greatest city of Asia, in a Chariot triumphant, having an upright
Tiara on his head, an ornament which the Kings did only use to wear. Worthy
was he of this reward, before he demanded it, but how miserable was that
nation, among whom there was not one man that would speak the truth unto the
King, except he would not speak truth unto himself.

CHAP. XXXII.
THe Emperor Augustus banished and confined his daughter, that was grown so
impudentt, hat her modesty exceeded this common course, and blazed abroad the
whoredoms of the imperial house, as how she had admitted whole troops of
adulteries; spent the whole night in banquets here and there in the city, how
she had soiled and sinned with her adulterers, in that every Court and
judgment seat, from whence her father had published laws against adulteries,
her daily haunt and concourse to Marsias s^aule, whereas from an adulteress
she became a common strumpet, and required the liberty of all licentiousness,
under an unknown adulterer. These things which a Prince ought as well to
conceal, as to punish (because the dishonor and disgrace of some things
oftentimes redoundeth to him who would punish the same) he unable to conquer
his displeasure published abroad. Where good counsel is wanting, impatience
breeds remediless harms.
Afterward some few days past, when remorsefull shame had supplied the place
of his displeasure, lamenting that he had not obscured those things in silence,
which so long time he was ignorant of, till it was loathsome for him to speak
it, he oftentimes exclaimed, None of these things had befalne me, if either
AGRIPPA or MECAENAS had lived. So hard a thing is it to him that had so many
thousands at his beck, to supply the want of two. His legions are slain, and
forthwith new are levied: his Navy defeated, and within few days a new
floated: fire had defaced and consumed the common buildings, and better were
raised then those that were burned; but all his life time he could not find
any to supply Mecaenas or Agrippas places. What shall I think? Did there want
such to succeed them, or that it was his error, who had rather complain then
seek friends? There is no cause we should imagine that Agrippa and Mecaenas
were wont to speak truth unto him, A corrigible custom for great men to
eschew.
who had they lived, had been amongst his dissemblers. It is the manner of
Kingly dispositions, in contumely of the living, to praise those that are lost,
and to give them the honor of speaking truth, from whom they are now out of
danger of hearing any more.

CHAP. XXXIII.
A lesson ^or upright Counselors.
But that I may return unto my purpose: thou see how easy a thing it is to
be thankful to those that are happy, and are planted in the height of humane
riches. Tell them not that which they are willing to hear, but that they
should be contented always to hate. Let sometimes a true word enter their
ears which are filled with flatteries: give profitable counsel. Thou ask
what thou may do for a happy man? Bring to pass that he be not too
confident in his fortune, that he may know, that many and faithful hands must
sustain the same. Is the favor little thou bestowest of him, if thou shall
once drive him from this foolish confidence, that his power shall be always
perdureable, and shall teach him that these things are transitory, that
casually yield, and fleet away with greater forwardness, then they come,
neither return by those means, whereby they attained their felicity? That
oft-times there is but little difference betwixt the greatest and lowest
fortune. Thou know not the value of friendship, if thou understand not,
that thou shall give him very much to whom thou give a friend, Few ^^iends,
many ^latterers.
a thing not only rare in houses but in ages, which is no where so deficient,
then where it is supposed to be most abundant. What think thou, that these
books of thine, which scarce thy remembrancers, or registered memory, or hands
can comprehend, are the names of thy friends? These are not thy friends which
in great troops knock at thy doors, who are disposed according to the first
and second admissions to visit. This is an old custom of Kings, and those that
counterfeit Majesty, to number a multitude of friends. It is the property of
pride to make great account of his door, and touch of his threshold, to give
it as a favor to sit nearest to his closet, that thou step the first foot
into his house, in which besides there are many doors, which exclude those
that are admitted to enter.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
THe first amongst us that commanded their troops should be separated, and
that some should be received in secret, other some with many, and other some
with all men, were Caius Gracchus, and after him Liuius Drusus. These therefore
had their first friends: they had their second also, but never any true.
Call thou him thy friend, whom thy servants successively admit to salute
thee; or can this man's faith be apparent unto thee, who enters not, but
slippeth and throngeth into thy doors, that are so hardly gotten open? May
that man press in to thee with full use of his liberty, which may not salute
thee with God save thee, a common and usual word to all persons, yea, even to
those that are strangers; but in his turn. To whomsoever therefore of these
thou shall come, whose salutation shakes the city: know thou likewise, if
thou mark it, that although thou see the streets besieged with a great
assembly of people, and the passages locked up with the press of those that go
and come to salute thee, yet that thou come to a place filled with men, but
void of friends. A friend is sought in the breast, not in the Court of thy
house: there must he be entertained, there retained, and in the veryentrails
must he be lodged. Teach him this thou art grateful. Thou esteem^st very
basely of thy self if thou ar^ unprofitable, What true friends are and wh^re
they should be ^ound.
except it be to one in affliction, or if th^^ think thy self vnn^cessarie in
time of prosperity. Even as thou demeanest thy self wisely both in doubtful,
aduersd, and prosperous affair^s, that in doubtful thou handlest them wisely,
in adverse constantly, in prosperity moderately^ so likewise may thou show
thy self profitable in all things in thy friends behal^e. Although thou
neither forsake him in his adversities, neither wish his misery; yet in so
much v^rietie many things may fall out that thou should not wi^h; which will
afford thee mattter to exercise thy faith. Even as he that wishes riches to
any man, to this end, that he himself may partake a part thereof, although he
seem to wish for him: has a respect unto himself. He that reiects his
friends misery to the end he may succor him is ungrateful.
So he that wishes his friend any necessity, which by his assistance and
faith he may relieve (which is the part of an ungrateful man) prefers
himself before his friend, and makes so great account, that he should be
miserable, that he him self might be grateful, for this very cause is
himself ungrateful. For he would disburthen himself, and discharge himself
of a burden too heavy to sustain. There is a great difference, whether thou
hastnest to give thanks to the end thou may restore a benefit, or to the end
thou might not owe it. He that will be grateful will apply himself to his
friends commodity, and desires that he may have a fit opportunity. He that
desires nothing else, but that himself may be discharged, desires by any
means to accomplish the same, which is an argument of a most evil will.

CHAP. XXXV.
THis to much hastening say I, is the act of an ungrateful man, this can I not
more manifestly express, then if I should repeat what I said. Thou will not
restore a benefit thou have received, but thou will fly from it. This seem
thou to say: When shall I be rid of this fellow? I must endeavor by all the
means I can, that I may not be beholding unto him. If thou should wish that
thou might pay him with his own, thou should seem to be very dishonest
and unthankful, but this thou wishest is far more wicked. For thou cursest
him, thou desire that mischief might fall on his head, whom thou should
account both Holy and Sacred. No Man as I think would doub^ of the impiety of
thy mind, if thou should openly wish him poverty, if captivity, if famine
and fear. And what difference is there whether this be thy voice or thy vow?
wish any of these in thy right wits. Go to now, and suppose this to be a point
of thankfulness, which the most ungrateful Man would not attempt, that were not
grown so far as to hate but only to deny his benefit.

CHAP. XXXVI.
WHO would entitle AEneas by the name of pious, The precedent reasons are
confirmed by example.
if he would have his Country sacked, to the end he might deliver his Father
from captivity? who would not imagine the young men of Sicily unnatural, if to
show good example to their children, they had wished that AEtna burning with an
unmeasurable force of fire above custom should give them occasion to express
their pieti^ by carrying away their Fathers out of the midst of the fire. Rome
is nothing indebted unto Scipio, if he wished the continuance of the
Carthaginian wars: nor beholding to the Decians who saved their Country by
their own slaughter, if they had formerly wished that extreme necessity
should make place for their constant devotion. It is the greatest disgrace for
a Physician that may be, to wish for business. Many who increased and
exasperated diseases, to the end they might cure them with greater glory,
could not afterward expel them, or to the great agony and vexation of the
miserable patients, have at last overcome them.

CHAP. XXXVII.
An other answer to the former by the examples of Calistratus and Rutilius.
THey say that Calistratus (for truly Hecaton testifies of him) when he
departed into exile, into which the seditious and intemperately free City, had
expulsed many with him: when a certain man wished, that the Athenians might
be enforced to recall their banished men, was much distasted with such a
return. Far more manly and full of magnanimity was that of Rutilius, for
when as a certain man comforted him, and assured him that civil war was
intended shortly, and that in few days all banishments should be reuersed.
What evil (says he) have I done thee, that thou wishest me a worser return,
then I had a departure? I had rather my Country should be ashamed of my
banishment, then bewail my return. This is no exile where no man is more
ashamed thereof, then he that is condemned: even as they performed the duty of
good Citizens, that would not recover their native homes with a public
slaughter, because it was more fitting that two should be punished unjustly,
then all perish publicly; so observes he not the affection of a grateful
man, who wishes that he who has deserved well at his hands should be
oppressed with difficulties, which he might redeem. Who although he think
well, wishes evil. It is a poor excuse and a weak glory to extinguish a
fire, which thou thy self have kindled. In some Cities a wicked wish has
been reputed for a wicked crime.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
A third confirmation h^^^of.
TRue it is that Temades in Athens condemned him that sold necessaries for
funerals, when as he had proved that he wished for great gain, which could
not befall him, except it were by many men's deaths. Yet is it wont to be
demanded whether he were worthily punished. Perhaps he wished, that he mi^ht
not sell unto many, but that he might sell dear; that they might cost him
little which he was to sell. Whereas negotiation consistest on that which is
bought and sold, why wrestest thou his vow one way, whereas profit is in both?
Besides thou may condemn all that are in this negotiation, for all will the
same, all wish the same in their hearts: thou will condemn the most part of
men. For who has not profit by an other man's incommoditie? The Soldier,
wishes for war: Dearth of Corn sets up the Husbandman. The greatest Lawiers
desire most pleas. A sick year is the Physicians harvest. Such youths as are
prodigal and dissolute, rich the Merchants of delicate wares. Let houses be
neither hurt by fire or tempest, the Carpenter may betake him to his rest. One
man's vow was excepted at, where all men's are alike. Think thou that
Aruntius and Aterius and all others that professed the art of Executorship had
not the same vows and wishes, as the masters of funeral Ceremonies and they
who were Ministers in burying the dead? yet know not they whose death they
wish: they desire that some one of their nearest familiars should die, in whom
for friendship sake they had most hope. No man lives by the loss of those,
whosoever differreth the other undoes them. They therefore wish, not only that
they may receive that which they have dese^ued by base servitude, but also that
they may be freed of a gri^uous tribute. It is not therefore to be doubted,
but that these men rather wish that which is condemned in one man. One man's
pleasure is another prejudice.
They by whose death any profit may accrewe, are hurtful to them by their
life. Yet all these men's vows are as well known as unpunished. To conclude
let each one take counsel of himself and examine his inward conscience, and
see what he has secretly wished, how many wowes are they which we are ashamed
to confess unto our selves? how few which we dare justify and effect before
a witness?

CHAP. XXXIX.
But every thing that is to be reprehended, is not to be condemned as this vow
of a friend, whereof at this present we entreat, abusing his good will, and
falling into that which he flies from. For whilst he hasteneth to express a
grateful mind, he is ungrateful. This man says, let him fall into my
hands, let him want my favor, let him neither be secure, in esteem, or safe
without me, let him be so poor and miserable, that whatsoever is restored him,
may serve him in stead of a benefit. And this in the hearing of the Gods. Let
domestical treasons circumuent him, which I alone may suppress. Let a potent
and heavy enemy assault him, deadly foes, and they armed, charge him, a
creditor and accuser urge him.

CHAP. XL.
SEe how just thou art, It is better never to be obliged, then to requite out
of season.
thou had wished him none of these, except he had given thee a benefit. To
ouerslip the rest more heinous, which thou committest by returning the worst
for the best, truly thou art faulty in this, that thou expectest not the
proper time of every thing, which, who so follows not, sins as much as he
that preuenteth it. Even as a benefit is not always to be received, so is it
not to be restored in all seasons. If thou should restore it me, when I
required it not, thou should be ungrateful, how far more ungrateful art
thou, if thou compellest me to desire it? Expect: Why will thou not suffer my
benefit to rest in thy hands? Why grieueth it thee to be obliged? Why art thou
so hasty to level thy account with me, as if thou had to deal with a
cruel Usurer? Why seek thou my trouble? Why incensest thou the Gods against
me? How would thou exact thy debt, if thou satisfy in this sort?

CHAP. XLI.
Instructions to take opportunity in requital.
Above all things therefore, my Liberalis, let us learn this to owe benefits
securely, and to observe the occasions of restitution, and not to seek them,
and let us remember our selves, that this very desire to discharge our selves
speedily, is the act of an ungrateful man. For no man willingly restores that
which he owes unwillingly, and that which he repineth to keep by him, he
rather judges it a burden then a benefit. How much better and iuster were it,
to bear the deserts of our friends in memory, and to offer them, and not to
press them, nor to think our selves too much in their debt, because a benefit
is a common bond, and lin^keth two together. Say I care not how thy benefit
returns to thee. I desire thou should receive it cheerfully, if any of us
both be threatened with necessity, and it be given us by a certain fate,
either that thou be compelled to receive thy benefit again, or I to take
another; let him give still that was wont to give. I am ready, there is no
delay in Turnus: I will show this willing resolution, as soon as time shall
happen, in the mean space the gods shall be my witnesses.

CHAP. XLII.
What means are to be observed in acknowledging a good turn.
OFtentimes, my Liberalis, I am wont to note this affection in thee, and as it
were, touch it with my hand, that thou fear and frettest, lest thou
should be tardie in any office. Anxietie becomes not a grateful mind, but
contrariwise an assured confidence of himself. The conscience of true amity
should put this care out of our minds. It is as great a vice to receive again
that which thou ought not, as not to give that which thou ought to give.
Let this be the first law of a benefit given, that he which gave the same, may
make choice of the time when he is to receive it back again. But I fear me,
lest men should speak sinisterly of me: He does badly that is grateful rather
for reputation and fame sake, then for conscience and honesty. Thou have two
judges of this thing; thy self whom thou can not deceive, and him whom thou
can. What then if no occasion shall happen? Shall I always be indebted? Thou
shall be indebted, but openly indebted, but willingly indebted, but with great
contentment shall thou behold, the gage laid up by thee. He repents himself
of a benefit received, that is sorry that as yet he has not requited it. Why
should he that seemed worthy to bestow a benefit on thee, be roputed
unworthy to have thee his debtor?

CHAP. XLIII.
GReat are their errors, who believe it to be the act of a great and generous
mind to do many courtesies, to give and fill another man's bosom, and enrich
his house, whereas sometime it is not a great mind, but a great fortune that
does it. They know not how much more great and hard a matter it is somewhiles
to receive, then to lavish courtesies. For to the end I may detract from
neither, because both of them when they are done out of virtue are equal. It
is no less proper to a noble heart to owe, then to give, yet more laborious is
this, then that, as the keeping of things received requires more diligence,
then does the giving of them. We therefore ought not fear, that we restore
not time enough, nor hasten to do it out of season, because he sins as much
that hast^neth to recompense a good turn out of due time, as he that requiteth
not when the opportunity is offered him. It is laid up with me for him,
neither fear I in his, nor in mine own behalf. He that requiteth
unseasonably, is no less faulty, then he that requiteth not in time and place.
He is wholly assured, he cannot lose this benefit, but with me, no not with me
also. I have given him thanks, that is as much as I have requited him. He that
thinks very much upon the restoring of his debt, imagines that the other
thinks upon his satisfaction too much. It behooves him to be pro^e to do
both the one and the other, if he will receive a benefit again, let us tender
it, and deliver it willingly, if he had rather continue it in our custody.
Why should we dig up his treasure? Why refuse we to keep it? He is worthy to
do what he lists. Touching opinion and report, let us so prise them, as that
they should attend us, and not lead us.

The end of the sixth Book.
LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA Of Benefits. THE SEVENTH BOOK.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
LIke unto the first: Certain questions, and yet things profitable, intermixed
with subtle. That in the beginning serious: that curiosity is to be
restrained, and too much desire of knowledge; that the mind is rather to be
applied to manners and virtue, that is, to wisdom. After this a question,
upon occasion of the word, Whether any man may give ought to a wiseman,
whereas all things are his? He says that he may, because he possesses all
things in mind, but not in use. Another, whether he that has endeavored or
assayed to restore a benefit, has restored it. He has: yet notwithstanding
he teaches him to endeavor again and ^gaine. The third, whether thou art to
restore that thou have recei^ed from a good man, to the same man being now
evil. Thou shall restore it, but with caution, not that he use them wickedly
or to his own or another man's harm. The fourth, whether he that gives, ought
to forget himself of that benefit he has bestowed. By no means: nay^ more
he says he may keep the same in memory, yea, and sometimes exact it. The
last, how grateful men are to be borne withal, with a pleasing, mild, and
great mind.

CHAP. I.
COurage my LIBERALIS; Now have we got the shore, I will not here
Tire thee with long discourse, or task thine ^are
To lingering prohemes, or dilated words.
The remainder this book concludes, and the matter being spent, A ^ood proi^ct
to f^shion ^en^ ma^ners, followed somewhat interr^pth, but learn^dly to the end.
I look about me, not what I shall say, but what I have not said: yet accept
thou in good part whatsoever is the remainder, whereas it is reserved to thy
self. Had I had an intent to polish my work, it should have increased by
little and little, and that part had been reserved till the conclusion, which
every one would have longed for, although he had been satisfied. But
whatsoever was most necessary, I presently gathered and congested into the
beginning of the Book: now if any thing has escaped me I recollect it.
Neither truly if thou ask me, do I think it much pertinent to the matter,
whereas those things are spoken which governed manners, to prosecute the rest,
which were invented, not for the cure of the mind, but for the exercise of the
wit. For Demetrius the Cynique (a man in my judgment great, although he were
compared with the greatest) was wont very worthily to say this: That it is more
profitable for thee, if thou remember a few precepts of wisdom, and have them
in use and readiness, then if thou learned many things, and had not the
ready use of them. For (says he) like as that man is a worthy wrestler, not
that has per^itly learned all the tricks and sleights, which he shall
seldom have occasion to make use of against his adversary: but he that is
well and dilig^ntly exercised in one or two, He means that many thin^s
delight the vnderstand^ng, and there are ^^w things that conquer the will.
and intentiuely expects and waits ^he occasion^ of them (for it skils not
how much he knows, if he know so much as suffices for the victory) so in
this study, many things delight, but few overcome. Although thou be ignorant
what cause it is, that moves the Ocean to ebb and flow, why every seventh
year impresseth an alteration and sign in our age, why the latitude of a
gallery to those that behold it a far off, keeps not his proportion, but
gathers his ends or sides into a narrowness, so as the farthest spaces of
the pillars are joined in one: what it is that separateth the conception of
twins, and joins their birth: whether one act of conception be divided into
two distinct creatures, or else they are begotten at several conceptions: why
their destinies be different who are borne twins together, and their
conditions prove so greatly different, whose birth was one, or at least in the
same instant. It shall not much hurt thee to ouerslip those things which
neither thou can know, nor is profitable for thee to know. Truth lies
covered and hidden in the depth: neither can we complain of the malignitie of
nature, because the invention of any thing is not difficult, but only of that
which yields us not any fruit, except the only invention thereof: whatsoever
should make us better or more blessed, nature has either laid open before us,
or near unto us. If the mind has contemned casualties: if she has raised
her self above fear, and with greedy hope embraces not things in^inite, but
has learned to ask riches of her self: if she has cast out from her the
fear both of gods and men, and knows that there is a very little to be
feared from men, neither any thing from god: if contemning all things whereby
life is tortured, whilst it is most adorned; he has attained so much, that it
manifestly appears unto him, that death is no matter of any mischief, but
the end of many: if he have consecrated his mind unto virtue, and thinks
that way playnest whither soever she inuit him: if he be a sociable creature,
and borne to community: if he respects the world as one house, and opens
his conscience to the gods, and lives always as it were in public: if more
afraid of himself then others, being discharged of these tempests, he has
retired himself to an assured and quiet repose, he has consummated a very
necessary and profitable science. The rest are but the delights of leisure: for
now is it lawful (the mind once withdrawn into safety) to expatiate and ariue
at these also, which rather yield ornament then courage to our minds.

CHAP. II.
THese are the things which our friend Demetrius wills him that is proficient
to lay hold on with both hands, to abandon them never, nay, rather to affix
them to himself, and make them a part of himself, and by daily meditation to
be instructed so far, that these wholesome instructions may present themselves
before his eyes freely; and being desired for, might be at hand at all times
and places, and that instantly that distinction betwixt good and evil may be
remembered, whereby he may know, that neither there is any vice, which is not
vi^cinous, nor any good which is not honest. Let him dispose his actions by
this rule of life: according to this law let him execute and exact all things,
and judge those the most miserable amongst men (how rich and refulgent in
wealth whatsoever) that are slaves to their belly and lust, whose minds are
benumbed with sloathfull idleness: let him say unto himself, Pleasure is
frail and fleeting, she is quickly wearied of her object; the more greedily
she is deuoured^ the more hastily is she disposed to a contrary desire: she is
always of necessity accompanied with repentance or shame: there is nothing in
her that is honorable or vertuous^ there is nothing in her that is either
noble or worthy the nature of a man, who would resemble the gods. It is a
bare thing, proceeding from the most loathsome and vildest ministeries of our
bodies, shameful in the end. This is the pleasure that is worthy a man and a
noble mind, not to fill and flatter the body, not to provoke his lustful
desires, which are least hurtful when they are most quiet. But to live exempt
from the passions of the mind, especially of that which enkindleth the
ambition of those men, who entertain quarrels and contentio^s among
themselves, and also of that intolerable passion, which coming from high,
has made us believe all that of the gods, which report and fables have forged,
and has planted this opinion in us, to measure them by our own vices. This
equal, dreadlesse, and neuer-loathing pleasure does this man enjoy, whom we
here fashion and describe, who (as I may say) being skillful both in divine
and humane laws, contenteth himself with the things that are present, and
depends not on those that are future: for never lives that man in assurance
that doateth on uncertainties. Exempted therefore from mighty cares, and such
as distract the mind, he hops nothing, he coueteth nothing, he hangs not on
expectation, but contenteth himself with his own: neither suppose you that
such a man is contented with small riches; ^or all things are his: yet not in
such sort as they were Alexanders, who although he had conquered as much as to
the shore of the red Sea, yet wanted he more then he left behind him from
whence he came. Those very countries, which either he possessed, or had
conquered, were not his. When as he had sent Onesicritus the general of his
Galleys to discover the Ocean^ and to search out fur^her war in an unknown
Sea: did it not sufficiently appear, that he was poor, who extended his
wars beyond the limits of nature, and thrust himself headlong through his
blind covetousness into a vast, unattempted, and boundless Sea? What skils
it how many Kingdoms he has violently taken, how many he has given, how
many countries he has laden with tributes? He wants as much as he desires.

CHAP. III.
Neither was this Alexanders error only, whom happy temerity enforced beyond
the tract of Bacchus and Hercules, but of all those whom fortune has made
greedy by ouer-glutting. Run over and reckon up Cyrus and Cambyses, and all the
progeny of the Kings of Persia, whom will thou find contented and satisfied
with his Empire? that ended not his life in thinking on some further project?
Neither is this to be wondered at, what so falls into a covetous hand, is
forthwith exhausted and hidden: neither skilleth it much, how much thou
throngest into that which will never be satisfied. The wiseman is only he
that is Master of all things, neither costeth it him much to keep them. He
has no Ambassadors to send beyond the Seas, nor camps to pitch in his enemies
country, nor garrisons to dispose in convenient fortresses, he needs no
legions or troops of horsemen. Like as the immortal gods, without the
assistance of any arms, do govern their Kingdoms, and entertain their greatness
in all assurance, without disturbance, or forsaking the place high and eminent
wherein they repose: even so the wiseman executes and governs his offices,
although they have a large extent without tumult, and beholds all other
mankind, being himself the powerfullest and best of all under himself. Mock
him as thou li^test, yet is it a matter worthy of a generous spirit, after thou
have in mind diligently considered both East and West, whereby also thou may
penetrate into the remote and most retired solitudes, when as thou have beheld
so many living creatures, such affluence of all things which beautiful nature
most blessedly lauisheth, to break into this discourse, beseeming a god, All
these things are mine. So comes it to pass that he desires nothing, because
there is nothing which is not his.

CHAP. IIII.
THis is that (say thou) that I expressly willed, I have overtaken thee now,
and intend to see how thou will rid thy self of these incombrances, whereinto
thou art wilfully fallen. Tell me, how may any man give ought to a wiseman,
if all things are his? For that also which he gives him is his own. A
benefit therefore cannot be bestowed upon a Under this name Wiseman, he
intends to signify through the whole body of this discourse, the same which it
signifies in the book of Pro^er^es and Ecclesiastes, and Wisdom, where this
word wisdom signifies virtue or ius^ice; and the name of Wise man is in this
sense a virtuous or just man.
wiseman, who can have nothing given him which is not his own: yet say you, a
man may give somewhat unto a wiseman. But know this, that I demand the like in
respect of friends. You say that all things are common amongst them, therefore
can no man give any thing to his friend: for he gives that which is common to
him. There is no cause but that somewhat may be both a wise-mans, and his that
possesses it, to whom it is given and assigned. (...) civil law all things
are the Kings: and yet those things whose entire possession appertains to the
King, are distributed amongst several lords, and each thing has his
possessor. Therefore may we give the King our house, our bond-slaue, and our
money^ neither for all this are we said to give him his own. For to Kings
appertains the power over all, but to several men the property. We call them
the bounds of the Athenians, or Campanians, which otherwise the neighbors by
private termination distinguish amongst themselves: and all the lands belonging
to this or that man, are the Common-weals, and yet each part has his
determinate owner, we therefore may give our lands to the Commonweal,
although they be said to be the Commonweals, because in one sort they are
theirs, in another sort mine. Can it be doubted, but that a slave, and
whatsoever substance he has is his masters? Yet may he give him a present. In
what manner a man may give unto a w^se man.
For a man cannot therefore say that the servant has nothing, because he could
not have, if so be his lord said he should not; neither therefore fails it to
be a present, when as he gave it willingly, because it might be taken from him,
although he would not. Even as we have approved that all things appertain
unto a wise man (for we are already agreed in this point) so we must at this
present express, that we have more matter then we need, to give liberally unto
him, whom w^e confess to be the master of what we have. All things are the
fathers, which are in the possession of his children; yet who knows not that
the son also may give his father somewhat? All things appertain unto the
gods, yet have we sacrificed at their Altars, and offered many times in their
Temples. That therefore which I have, fails not to be mine, because it is
thine, for one and the same thing may be thine and mine. He (say thou) is a
Baud, that is the owner of common harlots, but a wise man is owner of all
things, and amongst all things the prostitute are comprehended: therefore a
wise man is a Baud. In like manner they forbid him to buy, for they say no man
buyeth his own, but all things appertain unto a wise man, a wise man
therefore buyeth nothing. In like manner restrain they him from borrowing any
thing, because no man pays interest for his own money. Innumerable are the
things they contend and cavil about, whereas notwithstanding they fully
conceive what is spoken by us.

CHAP. V.
Undoubtedly in such sort conclude I all things to be a wise man's, that each
one notwithstanding remain master and lord of that he has, even as under the
government of a good Prince: the King posseseth all things by regal
authority, and every private man by particular tenure and title. The time will
come when we shall prove this; mean while let this suffice for this question,
that I may give a wise man that, which in one kind is his, in another mine:
neither is it a strange matter that somewhat may be given him, who is Lord of
all. I have hired a house of thee; in this house there is something thine and
something mine. The house it self is thine, the use of this house is mine.
Thou therefore shall neither touch the fruit, if the Farmer forbid thee,
although they grow on thine own soil, and there should be a scarcity of
corn; or famine: Alas, how all in vain shall thou
Behold another mighty mow.
That grew in thine own ground, was stacked in thine own barn, and must be
stored in thine own garners. Thou shall not enter my hired tenement, although
thou be lord thereof, neither shall thou carry away thy slave, which is my
hireling; and if I hire a wagon of thee, thou shall take it for a kindness, if
I give thee leave to sit in thine own wagon. Thou see therefore that it may
so be, that man receiving that which is his own, may receive a courtesy.

CHAP. VI.
IN all these things which I lately recited, both one and the other are masters
of one and the same thing. But how? Because the one is the lord of the thing it
self, the other of the use. We say that these books are Ciceroes, and Dorus
the Booke-seller says those very same books are his, and both these are true,
the one challenges them as the author thereof, the other as the buyer, and
rightly are they said to appertain to both; for the right is in both of them,
yet not after the same manner. So may Titus Liuius receive in gift, or buy for
money his own books at Dorus his hands. He answers the former objections.
I can give that to a wise man, which particularly appertains unto me,
although all things be his. For since after a kingly manner he possesses all
things freely, and the propriety of every thing is distributed to every
particular person, he can receive a present, he can owe, and buy, and hire. All
things are Caesar's, yet nothing but that which is his own patrimony and
particular demeanes is returned into his Exchequer: all things are subject to
his sovereign power, but his peculiar heritage is properly his own. The
question is, what is his, and what is not his without diminution of his empire.
For even that which is adjudged to be none of his, is in another sort his own.
So a wise man in mind possesses all things, but by law and right only that
which is his own.

CHAP. VII.
BION somewhiles in his Arguments concludes all men to be sacrilegious,
sometimes no man, when he would cast all men from the This was the Tarpeian
rock, whence heinous o^fenders were headlong cast down.
rock, he says, whosoever has taken away or lauished that which appertains
to the Gods, and converted the same to his own^ use, is sacrilegious, but all
things are the Gods, whatsoever every one takes away, he takes it from the
Gods, to whom all things appertain, therefore whosoever takes away any thing,
is sacrilegious. Again, when he would have Temples broken open, and when he
commands that the Capitol should be pillaged without fear or vengeance of
the Gods, Capitol is a place in Rome dedicated to Jupiter, which in times past
was called Tarpe^^.
he says, That no man is sacrilegious, because that whatsoever is taken out of
that place, which appertains to the Gods, is transferred into another place,
which appertains likewise unto the Gods. To this it is answered, that true it
is that all things are the Gods, but that all things are not dedicated to the
Gods, and that sacrilege is observed and committed only in those things,
which religion and devotion has consecrated to the Gods. So say we likewise,
that the whole world is the Temple of the immortal Gods^ only worthy to
contain^ their Majesty and magnificence, and yet that profane things are
different and distant from sacred, and that it is not lawful to act all things
in a corner of the earth, that has been called a Temple, which we may lawfully
do in the sight of heaven, and view of all the Stars. Undoubtedly the
^^crilegious cannot ^o any injury to God, whose divinity has planted him
without the shot, yet is he punished, because he has done it, as it were^ to
God^ for both our and his own opinion obliges and makes him subject to the
penalty. Even as therefore he seems to be sacrilegious that takes away any
sacred thing, althoug^ whithersoeuer he transferreth that he has taken away,
it is within the limits of the world: in like manner a man may rob a wise man,
for that is taken from him, not which is his, as he is Master of all things in
this world, but that whereunto he had a peculiar title, which he reputeth and
uses as his own in several. That other possession he acknowledges, the
other he would not have though he might: and into this discourse will he
break, which the Roman Emperor uttered, when as for his virtue and good
government, so much land was decreed and allotted him, as in one day he could
enuiron with his plow: You have not need (says he) of such a Citizen, that
has need of more then one Citizens living. How much more worthy, think
thou, was this man in refusing this gift, then in deserving it? For many great
Captains have broken and defaced other men's bounds, but never a one of them
has limited his own.

CHAP. VIII.
WHen as therefore we behold a wise man's mind, powerful ouerall things, and
spreading his Empire over all the whole world, we say that all things are his,
when as we refer him to the right of daily custom, he shall be taxed by the
powle, if the cause so require. There is a great difference whether his
possession be estimated by the greatness of his mind, or by his revenues; he
would hate to be lord over all these things whereof thou speak. I will not
reckon up Socrates, Chrysippus or Zeno, and such other great personages, who in
this are greater, because Envy obscureth not the praise of such, who have
lived in times past. A little before I made mention of Demetrius, whom nature,
in my judgment, seems purposely to have bred in our time, to show that
neither we could corrupt him, nor he correct us. A man (though himself deny
it) of exact wisdom, and of firm constancy in those things which he
determined, yea and of that eloquence which best sitted matters of greatest
strength^ not polished or painted in words, but proof, cutting his causes with
great courage, according as the heat carried him. I doubt not but the diuin^
providence gave this man such a life and such ability in discourse, to the end
our age might want no good example, nor reproach.

CHAP. IX.
IF some one of the Gods would deliver all our goods into Demetrius possession
upon this condition, that it might not be lawful for him to give it away, I
dare auerre it, he would refuse them, and would say I will not entangle my
self with this inextricable weight: I will not plunge this man so clean and
free from avarice, into this deep bog and sincke of these things. Why bring
thou me the mischiefs and infelicities of all men, which I would not receive,
although I could give them away presently, because I see many things which I
might not honestly give? I will contemplate those things which dazzle the eyes
of Kings and Nations. I will behold those things for which you spend your
bloods, and hazard your souls. Set before mine eyes the chiefest spoils of
superfluity, whether it be that thou will unfold them in order, or (as it is
better) deliver them in gross. I see a vaulted roof most cunningly carved
with curious variety: and the shells of diverse the most loathsome and sluggish
creatures bought at excessive prices. Wherein that very variety which most
pleases, is made of counterfeit colors, according to the similitude of the
things themselves. I see in the same place tables and wood, estimated at no
less then a Senators substance, by so much more precious, by how much the
infelicitie of the tree had writhed and wrested it into infi^it knots. I see in
the same place vessels of Chry^^all, whose brittlenesse enhanseth the price.
For amongst ignorant men, the p^^asure of all things is augmented, even by that
very dange^, which should ^^use us hate them. I see pots and vessels of
Murrhine, as if superfluity and rio^o^^ e^pence had not been sufficiently
prized, if they had not vomited in great v^^sels of precious stone the
excessive wine they had drunk to one an others health. I see pearls not
severally fitted for every ^are one; for now the ears are accu^tomed to bear
burdens, diverse of them are tied together, and if there (...) but two, a third
is hanged under them. The madness of women had not ^ufficiently brought their
husbands into subjection, except they hanged at either of their cares the worth
of two or three men's patrimonies. I see silken garments (if they may be called
garments) wherein there is nothing that may cover either their bodies, or at
leastwise their shames; which when a woman has put upon her, she may scarcely
swea^e that she is not naked. These for a great sum, are by way of commerce
fetched from foreign Nations, that our matrons may show no more of themselves
to their adulterers in their chambers, then in public.

CHAP. X.
WHat do thou avarice? How many things are they, which in value surpass thy
gold? All these things which I have reckoned up are of more honor and better
price. Now will I recognize thy riches, the plates of both metals, at which
our covetousness is dazeled. But the earth which produced whatsoever was
pro^itable for our use, has drowned these metals, yea, and with her whole
weight has cast her self upon them, as upon hurtful and hatef^ll things^
which could not come to light: but to the common hurt of all nations I s^e that
Iron is taken out of that very darkness, whence gold and silver were had, to
the end that neither instruments for mutual slaughters, n^yther price for the
murderers should be wanting, yet have these things some matter of esteem in
them. There is somewhat wherein the mind may follow the error of the eyes. I
see these Patents, these Indentures, and Obligat^ons, the empty images of
covetousness, certain shadows of sick avarice, by which they deceive the
mind, that delights in the opinion of transitori^ things. For what are these?
What is interest? What day-bookes and usury, but c^rtaine names of humane
covetousness, which nature never heard of? I can complain of nature, because
she has not hidden gold and silver deeper, because she has not cast a
heavier bu^then on them, then that it might be removed. What are these
Registers, these computations, and sailable time, These were called Centesima,
which was a kind of usury amongst the Romans: the creditor was wont to give his
debtor 100. crowns, and ^or the use thereof he paid for every month a crown
^or his interest, till a hundredth months were past; at the end whereof he
returned the principal to his crediter.
these bloody vsuries of twelve for a hundredth? They are voluntary evils
depending on our constitutions^ in which there is nothing that may be subjected
to the eyes, or held in the hand, the dreams of vain covetousness. O how
wretched is he, who takes delight to read over the great rentall of his
patrimony, or large demeanes to be tilled by his bondmen, or infinite herds
of cattle, that need whole countries and Kingdoms to feed them, or his family
greater then warlike nations^ and private buildings, that in bigness exceed
great cities! When he has well examined these things, whereby he has disposed
and spread out his riches, and made himself proud; if he compare that which
he has with that which he desires, he is a poor man. Let me go, and restore
me to those riches of mind: I know the Kingdom of wisdom to be great and
secure: so enjoy I all things as all men may enjoy theirs in particular.

CHAP. XI.
WHereas therefore Caius Caesar gave Demetrius two hundredth talents, he smiled
and refused them, not deeming the same of such value, as he might justly glory
that he had refused them. O gods and Goddesses, with how small a thing would he
either have honored or corrupted such a mind! I must testify for so worthy a
man: I have heard a great matter reported by him, that when he had wondered at
Caesar's indiscretion, in that he thought that he could be changed for so
slight a matter, he said thus: If, said he, he had intended to tempt me, he
should have tempted me with his whole Empire.

CHAP. XII.
SOmething therefore may be given to a wiseman, although all things be his: so
likewise nothing lets but that something may be given to a friend, though we
say that all things are common amongst friends. For in such sort are not all
things common betwixt me and my friend, as they are with a partner, so as my
part and his should be all one: but as children are common to their fathers and
mothers, who having two betwixt them, have not each of them one, but two a
piece. First of all I will make him know whatsoever he be that will be
co-partner with me, that there is nothing common betwixt him and me: and why?
because this association cannot be but amongst wisemen, who only understand
and practice the use of true friendship^ the other are no more friends then
they be copartners. Again, goods are common in diverse kinds. The sieges in
the Theater ordained for Knights, appertain to all the Knights of Rome; and
yet in these, the place that I sat in is mine own. If I have yielded up my
place to any, although I give him place in a thing c^mmon to all, yet seems
it that I have given him somewhat. There are things which appertain to some
men, under certain conditions: I have my place amongst the Knights, not to
sell, not to hire, nor to possess continually; but only to this end, to
behold the publik sports. I shall not therefore lie, if I say I have a place
amongst the knights; but when I come into the Theater, if the place^ be all
taken up, yet in right have I a place there, because it is lawful for me to
sit there: and I have it not because it is occupied by those, who have as much
title to the place as my self. Suppose the care is the same amongst friends.
Whatsoever our friend ^ath is common to us, yet the property is his that
possesses it: I cannot use it against his will. Thou mockest me (say thou)
if that which appertains to my friend be mine, I have liberty to sell the
same: but I have no liberty; for thou can not sell my Knights place, yet is
it common to thee, with those of the same order. It is no argument therefore
that a thing is not thine, because thou can not sell it, because thou may
not consume it, because thou may not change it for worse or better: for it
is thine, although it be thine but upon a condition. I have taken the place,
yet have thou it nevertheless.

CHAP. XIII.
NOt to dally or delay with thee any longer, one benefit cannot be greater
then another: but those things whereby a benefit may be given, may be greater
and more; into which beneuolenc^ may extend it self, and so please it self:
as lovers are wont, whose many kisses, and closer embracements increase not,
but exercise their loves. This question also that ensues, is fully debated in
our former, and therefore it shall be shortly handled: for the arguments we
have used in the other questions, may be employed here. The question is,
whether he that has done his best to restore a benefit, has given
satisfaction. That thou may know, say thou, that he has not satisfied,
he has done all he can to recompense him: it appears therefore that that
thing is not done, because he had not the means to do it, as he has not paid
the silver which he ought unto his creditor, who, to perform the same, had
sought him every where, and could not find him. Some things are of that
condition, that they must needs be effected, and in some things it is as much
to have attempted what a man could, as to have effected the deed. If the
Physician has done his uttermost to heal his patient, he has performed his
part. The Orator although his cly^nt be condemned, if he have showed the
uttermost of his art, has not lost the honor of his eloquence. The General
and Captain, although conquered, is commended, if in as much as in him lay, he
proceeded with prudence, industry and fortitude, he has attempted all means
to recompense thy courtesy, but thy felicity let him. No calamity has
fallen upon thee, whereby thou might make trial of his true friendship. He
could not give unto a rich man, sit by a healthful man, succor a happy man.
He was thankful unto thee, although thou receiuedst no benefit. Besides,
intending this matter always, and expecting the time and opportunity of this
same; he that has spent many cares to this e^d, and employed much diligence
to find an occasion of requital, ^ath endeavored more then he whose fortune
it was, to make satisfaction suddenly.

CHAP. XIIII.
THe example of the debtor is far different from this, who has done little
in gathering in his mon^y, exc^pt he has paid it: for there his importunate
creditor stands over his head, who sussereth not a day to pass without
interest; but here thou art matched with a bountiful creditor, who when he
shall see thee ^ro^ting up and down, careful and pensive to satisfy, says
unto thee Dislodge this care from out thy breast.
Cease to be so urgent in thine own trouble: I am wholly satisfied. Thou do
me injury, if thou think that I desire any thing more at thy hands: I am
fully possessed of thy good mind. But tell me (says he) would thou say that
he had restored a benefit that had only been thankful? By this reckoning
he that has requited^ and he that has not satisfied are of like reckoning.
Contrariwise, put case; if any other has forgotten the benefit he has
received, and has no ways endeavored himself to requite the same: would
thou say that he had requited? But this man (of whom we speak) has wearied
himself day and night, and renouncing all other offices only to think upon
this, has wholly intended satisfaction, and labored that no occasion should
ouer-slip him. Shall therefore the like respect be had of him, that has cast
away the care of returning gratuitie, as of him that never thought of ought
else? Thou dealest unjustly with me, if thou exactest that recompense at my
hand, when thou see my mind ever addicted to content thee. To be short; put
case thou were in captivity, and that to ransom thee (having engaged all my
goods unto a creditor, who had taken them in assurance of the money which I
borrowed for thee) I put forth to Sea in a sore stormy winter, by coasts and
promontories beleag^ed by Pirates; and furthermore suffered all the perils that
may chance even in a peaceable Sea^ and after that having trauersed all the
deserts, which all men living fled, and sought to find thee; and coming at
last to the Pirates, from whose hands already another had discharged thee: will thou deny that I have not requited thy goodness, i^ in undertaking this
journey, I have by shipwreck lost that money which I borrowed for thy ransom?
If I fall my self into that captivity from whence I would deliver thee; will thou not confess that I have been thankful unto thee? Yet undoubtedly the
Athenians called Armodius and Aristogiton Tyrant quellers, and Mutius hand left
upon the enemies Altar, was as much as if he had slain Porsenna: and virtue
likewise wrestling against fortune, although the intended action was not
effected, was always honored. He has performed more, who has followed
flying occasions, and ever hunted after new by which he might be thankful,
then he whom the first occasion made grateful, without pain or travel.

CHAP. XV.
He has (says he) employed two things for thee, his will and goods: thou
likewise owe him two. Worthily might thou say this unto him, that had
only yielded thee an idle will, but thou can not speak it to him, who both
wills, and endeauoreth and leaves nothing unattempted, for he performs
both, as much as lies in his power. Again, a number is not always to be
equalled by a number, for sometimes one thing ouer-valueth two. Therefore so
forward and desirous a will to make restitution, stands in stead of the
benefit. But if the mind without the act be not sufficient to requite a
benefit, no man is thankful to the gods, on whom there is nothing bestowed but
the will, we can (says he) give nothing to the gods but our will, but if I
have no other thing to give him to whom I am obliged, why should I not be
reputed grateful toward men, in yielding herein that more, then which I cannot
give unto the gods?

CHAP. XVI.
YEt if thou ask me what I think, and wilt subscribe unto mine answer, let
this man judge that he has received the benefit, and that man know that he
has not requited it. Let the one release the other, and the other confess the
debt. Let this man say I have it, and that man I owe it. In all controversies,
let us respect the common good, let ungrateful men be exempted from
excusations, to which they may fly, and under which they may color their
refusal. I have done all that I could. Do it now likewise. What, think
thou our ancestors were so imprudent, that they understood not that it were an
unjust act to set no difference between him, who had spent the money he had
borrowed of his creditor in royot and sports, and him, who either by fire or
thieves, and by any other misfortune, both lost his own and other men's? Truly
they admitted no excuse, to the end that men should know that faith was to be
observed every way. For it was better that a just excuse amongst few should not
be accepted, then that all men should attempt any. Thou have done all thou
can to satisfy. Let this suffice him, and thee a little. For even as he is
unworthy to receive any requital, who suffers thy serious and sedulous
endeavor, to slip away unregarded; so likewise art thou ungrateful, if thou
think not thy self more freely obliged to him, who takes thy good will for
payment, and by this means acquiteth thee of that thou owe^t. Lay not hold of
this, neither contest, yet seek thou occasions of restitution. Requite the
one, because he asks it, the other, because he releaseth thee. Repay this
man, because he is wicked, and the other, because he is not evil. And
therefore thou have no cause to think this question may stand thee in any
stead: whether he that has received a benefit from a wise man, when he is
wise, is bound to restore it afterward, when he is become foolish, and shall
no more be a good man. For thou would restore a thing committed to thy
trust, which thou had received from a wise man, yea and to an evil man,
would thou satisfy that he had lent thee: why then likewise would thou
not restore a benefit? Because he is changed, shall he change thee? What if
thou had received any thing from a man in health, would thou not restore
it when he were sick, whereas we are always most obliged to our friend when
he is weakest? Truly this man is sick in mind, let him be helped, let him
be borne withal, folly is a sickness of the mind. To the intent that this
may be the better understood, me thinks it good to use some distinction
herein.

CHAP. XVII.
THere are two kinds of benefits, the one which a wise man cannot give, but to
a wise man; and this is an absolute and true benefit: the other vulgar and of
little value, whereof the use is ordinary amongst us ignorant men. Of this
there is no doubt, but that, that I ought to restore it to him I owe it,
whatsoever he be, whether he be become a Homicide, a Thief, or an Adul^^rer.
There are laws to punish crimes and bad actions: the Judge better chast^seth
these, then an ungrateful man. Let no man make thee b^d^ because he is bad
himself. I will fling away my benefit to a wicked man, and restore it to a
good man, to the one, because I owe it, to the other, lest I should be in his
debt.

CHAP. XVIII.
OF the other kind of benefit there is some question, which if I be not
capable to receive, except I be wise, I ought not likewise to restore but to a
wise man. For put the case I should tender it, yet cannot he receive it, for
why he is not capable of it, but has lost the science how to use it. What if
you command me to bandie back the ball to a maimed man's hand, it is but a
folly to give him that has no power to receive? And that I may begin to
answer thee to thy last speeches, I will not give him that which he cannot
receive, yet will I recompense the good he has done me, although he cannot
receive it. For I cannot oblige any man, but him that receives, yet may I be
discharged, if I give satisfaction. Cannot he make use thereof? Let him look
to that, the fault shall be in him and not in me.

CHAP. XIX.
TO restore, says he, is no other thing, but to deliver it to his hand^ that
ought to receive it. For if thou owe wine unto any man, and he wills thee
to power the same into a net or si^ue, would thou say that thou ^addest
repaid him, or would thou return him that, which whilst it is restored, is
spilt between both. To restore, is to give that which thou owe to him, to
whom it appertains, and that has a will to receive the same; this is the
only thing I ought to perform. That he may receive, that which he received,
at my hands, is now a further charge. I owe him not the custody thereof, but
the acquitall of my faith: and far better is it, that he have it not, then
that I should not restore it. I will presently satisfy my creditour, although
I know that he will suddenly send that I owe him unto the stews. Although he
assign it over to be satisfied to an adulteress, I will pay it. And if he
would power the money, which he is to receive, into his bosom, being untied,
yet will I give it. For I must repay it, yet am I not bound either to keep or
defend it. I ought carefully to keep the good I have received, and not that
which I have restored. As long as it remains with me, I will see it shall not
be lost, but if it be called for, it must be satisfied, although it should slip
ou^ of his hands that received it. I will restore it to a good man, when it
shall be profitable for him, to an evil man when he shall demand it. Thou can
not, says he, redeliuer a benefit unto him in such a sort as thou receiuedst
it, for thou receiuedst it from a wise man, thou repaydst it to a fool.
Neither is it embased by me, but by him. I will render that which I have
receiued^ and if he recover his wisdom, I will redeliuer it entirely, such as
I received it; as long as he is evil, I will render such a one as he may
receive. But (says he) what if he be not only made evil, but cruel and
enraged as Apollodor^s or Phalaris, were, will thou restore the benefit thou
have received at his hands? Nature suffers not so great a change in a wise
man, for falling from the best into the worst, it must needs follow also, that
some impression of goodness remains in him, even in his wickedness. Virtue
is not so much extinguished in men, but that she impresseth some marks, which
cannot be defaced by any change. Wild beasts that have been brought up
amongst us, when as they break out into the woods, retain some part of their
former tamenesse, and look how much they be wilder then the ^amest beasts, so
much are they tamer the^ the wildest beasts, and such as never were many
tractable by man's hand. No man has ever fallen into extreme wickedness, that
has ever stuck unto wisdom: he is tainted more deeply, then that it may be
wholly washed out, and changed into any other color. Furthermore, I ask thee
whether he, of whom we speak, be only savage and cruel in mind, or if he
take pleasure to procure the ruin and public misfortune of the whole world.
For thou have proposed unto me Apolidorus and Phalaris the tyrant, whose
nature, if an evil man have in himself, why should not I restore him his
benefit back again, to the end I may be wholly acquit of him for ever? But if
not only he delights and takes pleasure in humane blood, but exercises his
insatiable cruelty on all ages, and rages not for anger, but of a certain
thirst and desire he has to shed blood: if he kills children in their
fathers presence, if not contented with a simple death, he tortureth them, and
not only burns those that are to die, but scorcheth them: if his altar be
always soyled with new murders and massacres. It is a small matter to keep
back a benefit from such a one. Whatsoever it was, whereby he and I were
lincked and united together: that has been dissolved, by reason that by his
cruelty and tyranny he has broken the rights and laws of humane society.
If he had done any thing for me, if I had received any good at his hands, and
afterward he had taken arms, and made war against my country, whatsoever he
had deserved he had lost, and to be thankful to him, would be reputed a
heinous crime. If he assail not my country, but be tedious to his own, and
doing no injury to my nation, ^e persecuteth his own: notwithstanding that so
great impiety of his mind, dissolueth the bonds whereby we were united: and if
this be not sufficient to make him mine enemy, at leastwise I shall have
occasion to loath and hate him, and the respect of duty which I ought to
bear to the common good of men, deserves to have more power over me, then
the obligation that I owe to one particular person.

CHAP. XX.
But although this be so, and that I may freely act whatsoever me lists
toward him from that time since, whereby violating all laws, he has brought
to pass, that nothing may be unlawfully attempted against him, yet believe I
that my actions must be so limited, that if the good I intend in my benefit,
shall neither augment his forces to the destruction of all men; neither
confirm that power which he has already, that is to say, that I may do it
without the ruin of the Commonwealth, I will restore his benefit: I will save
his child being an infant. What does this benefit wrong any of those whom his
cruelty dism^mbreth. I will not furnish him with money to pay the soldiers of
his guard. If he shall want ^ither marble or rich raymen^, it shall be no ways
preiudi^iall to any man, that shall supply his excess and superfluity.
Soldiers and furniture I will not help him with. If he request me in way of
great kindness, to send him cunning Comedi^ns and Gourtezans, and such other
delights as may t^mper his cruelty, I will willingly offer them. Though I would
not send him armed Galleys and ships of war, yet would I send him whirries
and covered barges, and other such like things wherein Kings take their
pastime, when they intend to sport themselves upon the sea. And if the hope of
his amendment were utterly lost, yet with the same hand that I give benefits to
all men, I will return him his; because the best remedy for such evil
dispositions is not to be, and it is best for him to be dead, whose life will
neither be reclaimed nor recti^ied. But seldom is so great wickedness seen,
it is rare; and reputed always for strange and wonderful, they are feared as
the gaping and openings of the earth, or as great fires which burst forth from
the deepest caves of the sea. Let us therefore leave these, and speak of those
which we detest without horror. To this evil man whom I may find in every
marketplace, whom private men ^eare: will I return the benefit I have
received: I must not make my profit of his wickedness. Look what belongs not
to me, let it return to him that owes it, be he good, or be he bad. How
diligently should I examine these things, if I should not restore but give?
This place craves a merry fable.

CHAP. XXI.
A Certain Pythagorist had upon his credit bought a pair of clownish shoes
of a Cobl^r (a great matter I warrant you) some few days after he came unto
the shop, to make satisfaction, and when he had long time knocked at the door,
there was one that answered him: Why lose you your labor? That Cobbler you
seek for is carried out and burned. This may be a grief to us which lose our
friends for ever, but not to you that know he shall be borne anew. Thus iested
he at the Pythagorist. But our Philosopher carried home his three or four
pence very merrily, shaking them diverse times in his hand, as he went homeward.
Afterward accusing himself of the pleasure he had conceived in non-payment,
and perceiving how much that little gain of his was pleasing to him, he
returned to the shop, and said unto himself; He lives to thee, pay thou
that which thou owe. With that word he thrust the four pence into the shop
at a crany of the wall, where the closing of the panell was shrunk; chastising
himself for his cursed avarice, lest he should accustom himself to detain
another man's goods.

CHAP. XXII.
Seek thou then to whom thou may return that which thou owe, and if no
man require payment at thy hands, call thou thy self to account. It
appertains not to thee, whether he be good or evil. Restore and accuse thy
self, not forgetting how offices are divided between you. Have we commanded
to forget thee, we have enjoined him to remember; notwithstanding he deceives
himself, that thinks that when we say, that he who has given the benefit,
should never more think on the pleasure he has done; that we would have him
entirely lose the remembrance of the honestest thing that may be done in this
world^ we command some things more strictly then we ought, to cause them to
return to their true and particular proportion, when we say that he must not
remember our meaning is, that he must not publish it abroad, he ought not to
vaunt, he should not reproach. For some there are that make the courtesies they
have done, their table-talke amongst their companions; of this talk they when
they are sober, of this they talk being drunk, this discover they to
strangers, this commit they to their friends. That this inordinat and
reproachful memory might be repressed: we commanded that he that had done the
courtesy to his friend, should never remember it, and commanding him more then
he could perform, we persuaded him to silence.

CHAP. XXIII.
AS often as thou distrusteth those over whom thou have command, thou may
exact far more then thou need, to the end that that may be performed which
is sufficient. Every Hyperbole aims at this issue; that by a lie a man may
attain unto the truth. He therefore that said, That did exceed the snow in
whiteness,
And did surpass the winds in lightness.
That which could not be said, to the end the most that could be, should be
believed. And he that said, More fixed then these rocks, more headlong then
this torrent.
did not think that he should persuade this, that any one was so immovable as
a rock. This excessive and superlatiue kind of speech never hops so much as
it dares; but it affirms incredible things, to the end it may attain unto
credible. When we say, Let him that has given a benefit forget it; our
meaning is, that he should be as one that had forgotten it: let no man perceive
that he has remembrance thereof, or that his memory is awakened. When we say,
That we ought not to redemand a bene^it again, we do not wholly take away the
means of redemanding it; for oft-times evil men have need of an exacter, and
good men also of an admonisher. Why then, shall I not show an ignorant man the
opportunity of requital? shall I not discover my necessities unto him? why
either should he belie himself, or be sorry that he knew it not? now and
then let some admonition be intermixed; yet such as is modest, which neither
sauoreth of importunity or matter of plea.

CHAP. XXIIII.
SOCRATES in the hearing of his friends; said, I had ^ought me a cloak had I
had money. He required of no man, he admonished all: the contention was, who
should supply him. And why not? For ^ow small a matter was it that Socrates
received? but it was a great matter to be worthy to be such a one, from whom
Socrates would receive. He could not more mildely chastise them. I ^^d (said
he) bought me a cloak had I had money. After this whosoever was the forwardest
he gave too late: for Socrates was already in necessity. For these intemperate
exactors sakes we forbid the redemand of benefits, not that it should never be
put in use, but that it might be done modestly and sparingly.

CHAP. XXV.
ARISTIPPVS having sometimes taken pleasure in good sauors and perfumes, said;
Beshrow these effeminate fellows that have defamed so worthy a thing. The same
must be said, Evil betide these wicked and importunate exactors of their
benefits, who have extinguished so worthy an admonition amongst friends: yet
will I use this love of friendship, and will redemand a benefit from him from
whom I would have requested it if I had need, who will receive it in stead of
another benefit. If he have means to requite that which I have done for him,
I will never say in way of complaint, I took thee up cast up upon this shore
Forlorn and poor, and that which mads me more
I made thee partner of my Princely state.
This is no admonition, but rather a reproach: this is no less then to bring
benefits into hatred: this is the direct means to make it either lawful or
delightful to be thankelesse. It is enough, and too much to refresh the
memory with submisse and familar words; If I have ought demerited from thee,
Or ought well liking has appeard in me.
Let the other likewise say, How can it otherwise be, but that thou have
deserved? Thou have entertained me in thy house, after that by tempest I was
cast on shore, denied of all supplies, shipwrackt and poor.

CHAP. XXVI.
But (says he) we have done no good, he dissembles, he is forgetful, what
should I do? Thou proposest a very necessary question, and in which it
becomes us to conclude this discourse, How ungrateful men are to be borne
withal? Truly with a peaceable, mild, and great mind. Let never so
inhumane, forgetful, and ungrateful man so offend thee, that the delight of
thy bounty be extinguished in thee, never let injury enforce these speeches
from thee: I would I had not done it. Let the infelicitie of thy benefit
content thee likewise. It shall repent him ever, if thou hitherto repent thee
not. Thou must not be grieved as if some new casualtie had befalne thee, thou
ought rather to wonder if it had not happened. One is affrighted with
labor, another with charge, another with danger, and another with unseemly
bashfulnesse, lest in his requital he acknowledge that he has received. Some
forget their duty, another is idle in his affairs, another ouer-busie. Mark
how the immeasurable desires of men do always gape and graspe after money.
Thou will not wonder then to see no man addressed to requite where no man
receives enough, which one of these is of so firm and solid a mind, that thou
may safely trust thy benefits with him. This man is mad with lust, that man
serves his belly, another is wholly addicted to lucre, whose substance thou
hardly may equal: this man is sick with envy, another with such blinded
ambition, that he is ready to run upon the swords point. Add hereunto
dullness of mind and old age, and contrariwise the agitation and perpetual
tumult of an unquiet breast. Annex hereunto the too much esteem, and insolent
pride of a man's self, for which he is to be contemned. What should I speak of
their contumacie, that incline to the worst; or of their inconstancy and
leuitie, that are settled in nothing? Add unto these headlong temerity and
fear, that never gives faithful counsel, and a thousand errors wherewith
we are entangled, the boldness of the most cowards, the discord of most
familiars; and (which is a common mischief) to trust to uncertainties, to
loath things in possession, to wish for those things which we may not any ways
hope to attain.

CHAP. XXVII.
Seek thou for faith, a thing so peaceable amidst the passions of the mind,
that are most restless? If the true image of our life were presented before
thine eyes, thou would suppose that thou saw the pillage of a great City
taken by assault, wherein without respect of shame or any justice, the enemy
in stead of counsel uses force and violence, as if by public proclamation
he were permitted to exercise at his pleasure all kind of outrage. Neither
fire nor sword is spared, murders and mischiefs are not punished: Religion it
self, which has oftentimes amongst the armed enemies saved their lives, who
humbled themselves at her feet, cannot now contain those men that are set
upon pillage: the one forcibly defaceth the goods of a private house, another
of a public: that man steals profane things, and that man sacred; the one
breaks up, the other passes over. This man being discontented with the
straightness of the passage, overthrows that which stops his way, and
makes his profit of this ruin. This man spoyleth without slaughter, that man
bears his booty in a bloody hand: there is no man but catches something
from another. Amidst this greediness of mankind, I fear me thou art too much
forgetful of our common fortune, who seek to find a grateful man amongst
so many robbers. If thou art agrieued that there are ungrateful men, be sorry
that there are some luxurious men, be vexed because there are covetous men, be
displeased because there are impudent men, be angry that there are deformed,
sick and pale old men. This vice I confess is grievous and intolerable,
that breaks the society of men, that deuideth and destroys that concord
whereby our weakness is supported; yet so common is it, that he himself who
complains against it cannot avoid it.

CHAP. XXVIII.
Bethink thy self, whether thou have been thankful to every one of those to
whom thou art obliged, whether any of those pleasures that have been done
thee, are lost; whether thou have always remembered the benefits which thou
have received from others, and thou shall see, that those things which were
given thee when thou were a child, were forgotten by thee ere thou were a
stripling, and that those things which were bestowed on thee in thy youth,
continued not in thy memory until old age. There are some things which we
have lost, some things we have rejected, some things have vanished out of our
sight by little and little, and from some things we our selves have turned our
eyes. But to excuse thy weakness, first of all memory is frail, and cannot
long time apprehend so great a number of a^faires; it must needs lose as much
as it entertaineth, and ouerwhelme the elder with the later. So comes it to
pass^ that the authority of thy nurse pr^uaileth little with thee, because
succeeding years have laid the benefits she has done thee, far from thy
thought. Hence grows it that thou yeeldest no reverence to thy Master: so
comes it to pass, that whilst thou art busied in laboring for a
Consulship, or pretendest a Priesthood, thou forgettest him that once gave thee
his voice to be a Questor. Happily if thou diligently examine thy self, thou
shall find that vice whereof thou complainest in thine own bosom: thou do
amiss to be angry with a public crime, and foolishly to be angry against
thy self; to absolve thy self forgive others. By thy su^ferance thou may
make him better, but worse by thy reproaches: thou must not harden his heart;
let him, if any shame be left in him, retain it still. Oft-times public and
notorious reproaches exile that doubtful mod^stie, which a man would retain.
There is no man fears to be that which he is seen to be: shame once
discovered is lost.

CHAP. XXIX.
I Have lost a benefit. Shall we say we have lost those things which we
consecrate to good uses? A benefit ought to be numbered amongst those things
that are consecrated; provided that a man has well employed the same, although
it be badly requited: if he have not showed himself such as we hoped he would
be, let us be such as we have been, let us be unlike unto him; the wrong was
then done, and now it appears. An unthankful man is not accused by us, but
with our own disgrace, because the complaint of the loss of our benefit, is a
sign it was badly given. As near as we can let us plead his cause with our
selves, and say happily he could not, peradventure he knew not, perhaps he
will do it hereafter. The wise and patient creditor sometimes recouereth his
debt which he reputeth lost, in forbearing his debtor, and giving him time: the
like must we do; let us nourish the languishing faith of those that forget
themselves.

CHAP. XXX.
I Have lost my ben^fite. Thou fool, thou know not the times of thy
detriment. Thou have lost, but when thou gau^st, now the matter is discovered.
Even in these things which se^me to be lost, moderation has profited very
much. As the infirmities of the body, so those of the mind are to be handled
gently; o^t-tim^s that thing which pati^nce and delay has discovered and
unfolded, is broken by his pertinacie and stubbornness that haleth the same.
What ne^d^ these reproaches? What need these plaints? What needs pursuit? Why
do thou acquit him? Why dismissest thou him, if he be ungrateful? Now owes
he thee nothing; what reason is there to provoke and incense him, whom thou
have many ways pleasured, to the end that of a doubtful friend he may become
an assured enemy, and to give him means to defend his cause the better by
procuring thine own shame? There be some will say, I am sure there is some
great matter in it; but what it is I know not, that he could not abide him to
whom he was so much indebted. There is no man that in any sort complained of a
superior but stained, though he could not d^face his greatness and honor,
neither is a man content to fain^ trifles, when he seeks for credit by the
greatness of his lie.

CHAP. XXXI.
HOw far better is that way whereby the hope of friendship is reserved to
him, and the opinion of our friendship likewise, if he be thankful and
entertain a better thought? Incessant goodness^ conquereth evil men; neither
is there any man of so hard and hat^full a mind against those things that are
to be beloved, that loves not those, who even in their greatest wrong^
continue good men, to whom he begins to owe this also, that he sustaineth no
displeasure a^ their hands for not requiting. Reflect thy thoughts therefore
upon these: ^here is no correspondencie h^ld with me: what shall I do? even
that which the gods the best authors of all things do, who begin to bestow
their benefits on those, that know not whence they come, and persevere also to
do good to those that are ungrateful. One charge them with little regard of
us, another that they have iniustly dispensed their graces, another thrusts
them out of his world, and leaves them there alone in sloth and heauiness^,
without light or doing any thing; another says that Sun (to whom we owe this,
that we have distinguished the time between labor and rest, that being
delivered from darken^sse we have escaped the confusion of a perpetual night;
for that by his course he tempereth the year, and nourishes our bodies, and
hasteneth our harvest, and ripeneth our fruit) is some stone or globe of casual
fires, and call him any thing rather then god. All this notwithstanding, the
gods like good parents that smile at the injuries of their little children,
cease not to heap benefits upon those who suspect that they are not the
authors of all benefits, but with an equal hand distribute their blessings
amongst al nations, reserving only to themselves the power to do good. They
water the earth with timely showers, they move the Seas with fitting winds,
they distinguish times by the course of the stars, they weaken both winters
and summers by the gracious intercourse of gentler winds; they pardon and
mildely wink at, and suffer the errors and sins of our sinful souls. Let
us imitate them; let us give although many things have been given in vain,
yet let us give unto others, let us give ^uen unto those by whom we have
sustained the loss, no man forbeareth to build a house ^or fear it should be
ruinated, and when as fire has consumed the place of our abode, we suddenly
lay a new foundation again ere the floor be half colde^ and ofttimes we
build cities in that very place where they were destoyed and sunk: so constant
and confirmed is the mind to good hopes; men's labors would cease both by land
and sea, if they had not a will to re-edifie and re-attempt the ruins that
were past.

CHAP. XXXII.
He is a thankelesse man, he has not injured me but himself, I had the use
of my benefit when I gave it, neither therefore will I give more slowely but
more diligently; what I have lost in him I will recover in others: yea, to this
man also will I give a benefit again, and like a good husbandman, with care and
labor I will conquer the barrenn^sse of the soil; I have lost my benefit, and
that man his credit with all men. It is not the action of a generous mind, to
give and lose; this is the mark of a mighty mind to lose and give.

THE EPISTLES OF LVCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA THE PHILOSOPHER.

Written unto LVCILIVS, Together with the Arguments unto every Epistle of
IVSTVS LIPSIVS.

LONDON Printed by William Stansby. 1613.

LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA HIS EPISTLES TO LVCILIVS: With the Arguments of Iustus
Lipsius.
EPISTLE I.
He commends to LVCILIVS the estimation and use of time, that it ought not to
be deferred nor let slip, neither ill employed.

DO so, my Lucilius, recover thy self to thy self, and that time which
hitherto has been either taken from thee, or stolen from thee, or that
otherwise has escaped thee, recollect and reserve to thy self. Persuade thy
self that it is so as I write: there are some times which are taken away from
us, some other which are stolen from us, and other some which slip away from
us: But the shamefullest loss that may be, is that which proceeds from our
negligence, and if thou will seriou^ly and nearly observe, thou shall perceive
that a great part of life flitteth from those that do evil, a greater from
those that do nothing; and the whole from those that do not that they do.
What man will thou show me that has put any price upon time, that esteems of
a day, and that understands that he daily dies? For herein are we deceived,
because we suppose death to be far off from us, and yet notwithstanding the
greater part thereof is already ouer-passed, and all our years that are behind
death holds in his possession. Do therefore, my Lucilius, that which as thou
writest unto me thou do. Embrace and lay hold on each hour, so will it come
to pass, that thou shall be less in suspense for to morrow, if thou lay hold,
and fasten thy hands on to day. Whilst life is deferred it fleeteth. All other
things, my Lucilius, are foreign to us: time only is our own. Nature has put
us in possession of this frail and fleeting thing, from which we may be
expelled by any man. But so great is the folly of mortal men, that they suffer
all things, yea even the least and vilest, truly recouerable, to be imputed
unto them, when as they have obtained them Let no man think that he owes any
thing, who has received time, when in the mean while this is the thing, which
indeed the grateful man cannot restore. Happily thou will ask me what I do,
who command thee these things? I will ingeniously confess unto thee, I do
that which befalls a luxurious man; but diligent: I take a very strict
account of my expense: I cannot say that I lose nothing, yet know I well what I
lose, and why, and how. I am ready to yield a reason of my poverty. It
befalls me, as to many others, brought to poverty, not by their own fault;
all men pardon them, no man succoureth them. What is it then? I think him not
poor, who supposes that little remainder which he has, to be sufficient: yet
I had rather thou should keep thine own, and begin to use good time while
thou may. For as our Elders were of opinion, the sparing that begins in
the bottom is too late, because not only the least, but also the worst
remains in the lees.

EPIST. II.
He approves the quiet of the body, and of the mind also in some one thing or
study. He condemns the o^er-curious, that run over and read diverse
Authors and writings. He persuades rather to read a ^ew, and those good, and
to dwell upon them. He counsel^eth always to cu^ out some one thing, and
commit it to memory, by his example who then made use of a saying of EPICVRVS
touching poverty.

I Conceive a good hope of thee, by reason of those things which thou writest
unto me, and that which I hear spoken of thee. Thou art no wanderer, neither
disquieted with the desire of transporting thy self from one place unto
another; this is but the tossing of a sick mind. In my judgment, the
chiefest testimony of a well composed mind, is ^o be able to consist and
dwell with her self. But beware lest this desire to read many Authors, and
all sorts of books, contain not giddiness and inconstancy of mind. Thou
must be stayed, and after a manner nourished with certain spirits, if thou will
apprehend any thing that shall cons^antly remain in thy memory. He is no
where, that is every where. Those tha^ pass their life in travel take up many
Innes, but entertain few friendships. It must needs so befall such, who
acquaint not themselves familiarly with one spirit, but lightly trauers, and
slightly overrun many things. That meat never nourishes the body, which is
no sooner taken in, but is delivered out. There is nothing that so much
hinders a man's health, as the often change of remedies. The wound can hardly
be cured, that is covered with diverse sorts of medicines. The tree prospers
not that is transported from one place to another. To be short, there is
nothing so profitable, that profits by passing i^ over. The multitude of
books distracteth and distempereth the understanding. Being therefore unable to
read^ as much as thou have, it suffices to have as much as thou can read.
But now, say thou, will I overrun this book, now that. The stomach is
distempered, that longs after diverse sorts of meats, which being different
and diverse, do rather choke then comfort or nour^sh. Read therefore (if thou will credit me) such books always as are most approved, and though for
varieties sake thou sometimes change, let the others be unto thee as thy
harbor, those as thine ordinary retreat and house. Purchas^ unto thy self
every day some new forces against poverty, and some couns^ls against death,
and fortify thy self with other preseruations against the other plunges of
life, and after thou have tasted diverse things, lay hold on one which that day
thou may digest. This likewise do I of diverse things which I read, I
apprehend somewhat. See here what I have learned to day of Epicur^s (for I am
wont sometime to pass into mine enemies camp, not as a fugitive, but as a
spy) A contented poverty, says he, is an honest thing; but that is no
poverty which is contented: for he that contenteth himself with his poverty,
is a rich man, not he that has little, but he that desires the most, is the
poor man. For what skilleth it how much a man has in his chest, how much
lies in his barns, how much he feeds, how much he profits by usury, if he
still gape after other men's gains, if he make reckoning not of those things he
has gotten, but of that which remains to be gotten? Thou requirest of me
what measure or) proportion there is of riches? The first is to have that which
is necessary, the next that which suffices.

EPIST. III.
That some are oftentimes badly and rashly called friends. If any such there be
that deserves the name of friend, all things are to be reposed and trusted on
his faith, and communicated unto him, as another our selves. Such as are
fearful and base minded are reprehended, as likewise those that are
ouer-credulous, or to open. The mean is the best.

THou have delivered thy letters to be conveyed to my hands, as thou say, by
a friend of thine, by which thou aduertisest me, not to communicate all thy
pertinent affairs with him, because as thou say, thou art not accustomed to
do the like: so that in one and the same letter, thou allowest and disauowest
him to be thy friend: I believe first of all, that thou have given him this
name of friend at adventure, and as a common name in such sort, as we call every
man that passes by us by the name of Sir, if so we be ignorant by what name he
is called. But let me tell thee this, that if thou think to have a friend,
in whom thou will not put as much confidence, as in thy self, thou deceiuest
thy self very much, and understand not sufficiently the force of true
amity: deliberate all things with thy friend, but first of all resolve thy
self, that he is thy friend. After the friendship is contracted, then ought
we to trust; before it be formed we ought to judge. But they preposterously
confound offices, who contrary to the precepts of Theophrastus, love before
they judge, and after they have judged love not at all. Think therefore long
time with thy self, whether any man is to be entertained into thy friendship;
but when thou shall be resolved to accept of his love, discover unto him
readily thy whole heart, and ^s boldly communicate thy secrets with him, as with
thy self; yet so live thou, that thy thoughts and actions may be such, that
thou may commit them to the serious observation of thine enemy. But because
sometimes diverse things fall out, that custom has made secret, impart freely
unto thy friend all thy designs and cogitations, if thou supposest him to be
faithful, thou will do no less. For many have taught how to deceive, by
fearing lest they themselves should be deceived, and have ministered other men a
privilege of offense by their own vain suspicion. What is the cause
therefore, why I should conceal any thing from my friend? Why before him
think I not my self alone? Some there are which commit those things which are
only communicable with their friends to every one they meet, and disburthen
in every ^are whatsoever is distastefull unto them: some again likewise are
distrustful of their faith, whom they esteem most dearest, yea and if they
could, they would scarcely trust themselves, but inwardly oppress themselves
with their own secrets. But neither of these things is to be done, for both of
them savor of infirmity, both not to credit all men, and not to credit any:
but the one in my opinion is the more laudable vice, the other more secure. So
reprehend both of them, both those that are always disquiet, as those that are
always idle. For the manner of living in the first is not industry, but
rather the course and recourse of a tempest that agitateth their souls: and as
touching those that think that all motion is trouble and vexation, it is
rather a dissolution and languor in them than moderation Commit that therefore
to memory which I have read in Possidonius, There are some, says he, that are
in such sort retired and hidden, that they think all things to be in garboile,
which are open to the light. It behooves thee to temper these things together,
and to choose certain intermissions which are proper to action and repast.
Deliberate with nature, and she will tell thee, that she made both the day and
the night.

EPIST. IIII.
He exhorts him to persevere in Philosophy, whereby he may be esteemed a
serious, grave and perfect man. For the rest he concludes them to be children
that fear such things as are not to be feared, as especially death. And this
concludes he to be the end of our evils; and that either by sudden motion or
desperation many have contemned the same: and why not with reason? He
concludes therefore that life is not to be loved, but that we ought daily to
think, upon how di^ers and light causes death approaches us. Finally, he
proposes an Emblem of EPICVRVS of true riches.

COntinue as thou have begun, and endeavor thy self as much as in thee lies,
to the end thou may more plentifully enjoy a reformed and governed mind.
And in reforming and moderating the same thou shall enjoy it, but the
contentment that a man receives by the contemplation of a conformed mind, and
that is replenished with perfect innocence, is far more pleasant and
agreeable. Thou do remember what pleasure thou did feel, when having
left thy childish liuerie, thou tookest upon thee the abilements of a man,
being brought before the Praetor into the marketplace. I expect a far greater,
beyond comparison, when thou shall cast off thy childish mind, and that
Philosophy has inrouled thee amongst the number of men: for childe-hood
ouerslippeth us easily; but that which is most grievous, childishness
remains with us, and the worst that I see, is that we have already the
authority of old men, and nevertheless possess as yet the vices of children;
and not only of children, but of infants. For those are afraid of things of
small value, and these other of such things as are false: we fear both the one
and the other. If thou will well bethink thy self, thou shall understand that
there are certain things, which for the same cause for which they bring us
much fear, ought the less to be feared; No evil is great which comes the
last. We might fear death if it could abide always with us: but it is
necessary that either it befall us not, or that it ouerpasseth incontinently.
And if thou tell me that it is a difficult thing to persuade the mind to
contempt of life, do but consider upon how light occasions some have attempted
the same: one has strangled himself with the halter before his Mistress
doors, another has cast himself from the top of the house to the bottom to
avoid his Masters displeasure, another has stabbed himself into the breast,
rather then he would be brought back to the place from whence he was fled.
Think thou that virtue cannot enforce as much as excessive fear could?
Trust me, no man can enjoy a peaceable and secure life, that labors over
much to prolong it, and that esteems it for a great benefit, to see and
observe the revolution of of many years. Meditate then every day to have the
power to leave thy life freely and willingly, which diverse men entertain in
another manner then they do who embrace briars and thorns, which have been
driven athwart them by the violence of some furious stream. They float betwixt
the fear of death, and the torments of life; they will not live, and they know
not how to die. Fashion therefore unto thy self a pleasant life, by forsaking
solicitude that may befall thee for the love of the same. There is no good
more plausible to the possessor then that, to the loss whereof the mind is
already prepared; and there is nothing, the loss whereof is more easy to be
supported, then of that which being lost cannot be redesired. Take thee courage
and assurance against those things that are subject to the same necessity as
thou art, even those that are most mighty. A King of Egypt.

not overmuch unto this calm. In an instant the Sea is turned, and those ships
are swallowed the same day, where they wantonly played on the water. Think
that either a thief or an enemy may aim his sword at thy throat: and
although a greater power be wanting, not the basest slave that lives, but has
power of thy life and death. I assure thee that whosoever contemns his life
is Lord of thine. Take account of those that are dead, by the complots of their
servants, or by open outrage, or by treason, and thou shall see that there are
no less made away by the indignation of their slaves, then the displeasures of
their Kings. What imports it then how mighty he be whom thou fear, if
every man may do that which thou fear? And if by chance thou fallest into
the hands of thine enemies, the conqueror will command that thou be led and
kept in a place, where he may have thee always at his mercy. Why deceiuest
thou thy self? Why beginnest thou then only to understand that which thou have
suffered from thy birth? I tell thee, that from the hour thou were borne thou
art led to die. These and such like things ought continually to live in our
remembrance and mind, if we will moderately expect this last hour, the fear
whereof replenisheth all others which disquiet. I will here make an end of my
Letter, in making thee partaker of the fruit which this day I have gathered in
another man's garden. Poverty measured according to the rule of nature, is
great riches. But know thou well what limits this rule of nature gives us?
Neither to have hunger nor thirst, nor cold. But to the end to drive away this
hunger and thirst, thou have no need to wait or attend on these proud and
great g^tes, nor to suffer these disdainful and imperious contemners, nor to
expose thy self to the baits of these contumelious courtesies. Thou need
not for the same to attempt the fortune of the Sea and of arms. That which
nature deserves is found every where: we take pains to obtain superfluous
things: these are they that wear our gowns in peace, that make us watch in
our Tents, and that cast us on foreign shoares. That which suffices us is
already at hand.

EPIST. V.
He keeps back his friend from the ostentation of Philosophy, and
counsels him not to make himself noted by his habit or diet: he persuades
him not to contemn all things that are vulgar, but to make moderate use of
them, and without abuse: he detesteth vncleanlinesse, and calls us to the
law of nature: he urges a clause out of HECATON of the conjunction of hope
and fear; auowing him to be free of one that has cast off the other; and
obnoxious to both, whosoever is to one.

WHereas thou trauellest continually, and all other things set apart,
endeuourest to make thy self daily more virtuous; I praise thee, and am glad
to hear it: and not only do I counsel thee to persevere therein, but I
likewise entreat thee. But thereof I am to admonish thee, that according to the
manner of those that seek not so much to profit as to be seen, thou apply not
thy self to do certain things which are ouer-singular, and remarqueable for
their strangeness, either in the manner of thy life, or in thy habit. Fly all
sluttish behauiours, as to wear thy hair ouer-long, knotted and filthy, thy
beard vncombed, to lie on the ground, and to make profession to have a sworn
hatred against gold and silver, and whatsoever follows ambition by a wrong
course. The sole name of Philosophy, how modest soever it be, is of it self
sufficiently subject to envy. What if we separate our selves from the company
of men? Well may we inwardly be in all things unlike unto them; but our looks
and behauiours must be agreeable to the good liking of the people. Let not our
garment either be too gay, or too slouenly: let not our silver be enchased with
gold; and yet let us be assured that it is no token of frugalitie to be
destitute either of gold or of silver: let us so do that we lead a better
life then the common sort are wont, yet not altogether contrary to theirs;
otherwise in stead of correcting them we shall drive and banish them from us,
and we are the cause that in disliking all our actions they will not imitate
one of them. Philosophy promises this first of all, common sense, humanity,
and intercourse and society, from which we shall become separated by this
dissimilitude of profession. Let us rather take heed lest these fashions for
which we would be held in admiration, prove not ridiculous and odious unto
others. Our intent is to live according to the direction of nature: but it is a
thing altogether contrary unto her, to afflict the body and to hate ordinary
cleanliness, and to be loathsome and sordid, to use not only gross meats,
but also harmefull and distastefull. For even as to affect and seek after
delicacie is riot, so also is it a kind of madness to fly from those things
which are usual and may be recovered without great expense. Philosophy
requires frugalitie, and not misery: and since an honest and well seeming
frugalitie may be bad, I think it good for a man to keep this measure. It
behooves us that our life be balanced betwixt good and public manners. I can be
well content that men admire our life, but yet let it be within their
knowledge. What then? shall we do the same that the rest? shall there be no
difference betwixt us and them? yes a great deal: but he only shall
reknowledge the same that observes us nearly. He that shall enter our houses,
let him rather look on us then on our moueables. That man is great and
generous, who uses earthen platters like silver vessel, and no less is he
that uses silver vessel as earthen platters. Not to be able to endure riches
is the part of a weak mind. But to impart unto thee the profit I have made
this day: I have found in Hecaton, that the end of coveting suffices to
remedy fear. Thou will give over, says he, to fear, if thou ceasest to
hope. But thou will say, How can these things being so diverse, be together? So
is it my Lucilius, although that these things seem to be contrary, yet are
they joined and united the one with the other. Even as one and the same chain
binds both the officer and the prisoner, so likewise these things although
they seem different, are conjoined and martch together. Fear flies hope, and
I wonder not thereat; both of them are passions which proc^ed from an
inconstant and moveable mind, and that is in thought and care for that which
is to come. But the greatest cause both of the one and other is, for that we
moderate not our selves, and content not our selves with things that are
present, but send our thoughts out far before us. So providence which is the
greatest benefit that betideth mortal men, becomes hurtful and harmeful
unto us. Brute beasts fly those dangers which they see before their eyes, and
having escaped them, their present security extinguisheth the memory of their
fear^: but we are affrighted not only with our dangers past, but with those
also that are to come. Many of our goods do harm us; for our memory reuiueth
and represents unto us the torment of the fear past, and providence
anticipateth it. There is no man miserable alone by present evils.

EPIST. VI.
He declares that it is an argument that he profits in Philosophie^ because
he acknowledges his vices. He expresses his affection to communicate all
things with him as his true friend, especially such as are profitable. That the
counsel of wisemen seems very effectual and above their precepts, which
he teaches by example of some Philosophers.

I Know, my Lucilius, that I am not only amended, but transfigured and
reformed; not that I either vaunt my self, or suppose that there remains not
any thing in me that may not be amended: I know there are many things, that
both ought to be corrected, extenuated, and wholly lifted up; but even this is
a testimony of a mind that begins to be changed for the better, when it
knows in it self those vices that before times it was ignorant of. There is
some hope in those that are seized with certain sicknesses, when as they feel
themselves to be diseased. I would therefore with to communicate with thee this
sudden change that is made in me; then should I begin to have a more certain
confidence of our friendship, of that true friendship I mean, which neither
hope nor fear, neither any other consideration of particular profit should
distroyne, with which men die, and for which they die. I will reckon up unto
thee diverse men that have not had want of a friend, but want of friendship:
such a thing cannot happen when as two souls are coupled together by a strict
alliance, and uniformity of will in desiring honest things. Why can it not?
for they know that all things are common unto them, and chiefly adversity.
Thou can no^ conjecture in thy mind how much profit I perceive that every
day brings me. Send me, says thou, those things whose efficacy I have so
tried. Truly I could wish that I might in some sort pour them all into thee:
I am glad to learn, to the end I may teach; and there is not any thing, how
rare and commodious soever it be, that can or should yield me content, if I
might only know it for my partcular profit. If wisdom it self were given me
upon condition to conceal it, and not to publish it, I would refuse the same.
The possession of no benefit is contenting without a companion. I will send
thee therefore the books themselves: and lest thou should take too much
pains in following those things which profit publicly, I will put certain
marks to find those things quickly, which I prove and admire; yet our
speaking and living together will profit thee more, then only reading. It
therefore behooves thee to transport thy self hither: first of all, because
men give better credit to their eyes then to their ears. And again, because
the way of precepts is long, where that of example is more short, and far more
fruitful. Cleanthes had never expressed Zeno had he only heard him: but he
always was conversant with him, and had an eye into the secrets of his study,
and warily observed whether he lived according as he taught. Plato, Aristotle,
and all other Sages which afterward spread themselves into diverse families,
have received more instructions by the manners then the words of Socrates.
Metrodorus, Hermacus, and Poliaemus were great men, not because they had
frequented the School of Epicurus, but for that they had conuersed with him.
But I call thee not only unto me, to the intent thou should receive profit,
but to the end thou should profit others: for we will continually assist one
another; mean while to acquit my self of the rent I owe thee, I will tell thee
that which pleased me to day in Hecaton: Ask thou, says he, wherein I have
profited? I have begun to be a friend to my self. He has gotten much: he will
never be alone. Know this, that he that is friend to himself is a friend to
all men.

EPIST. VII.
To him that is proficient too much company is to be anoyded, and that vices
are contracted thereby, Plays and Shows also, chiefly those that are
bloody: neither is it beseeming publicly to recite or dispute amongst
unequals. Let^ says he, one or two a^ditors of judgment be esteemed, or none
at all.

Will thou know that which in my judgment thou ought especially to fly?
The multitude. For as yet thou can not safely commit thy self unto them; and
for mine own part I confess my weakness: I never return back again with
those manners that I carried out with me. Somewhat of that which I had composed
is troubled; somewhat of those things which I had chased away returne^h back
again unawares. That which befalls the sick who are in such sort attainted
with a long debility, that they can never be removed, except they grow worse.
So fares it with us, whose spirits begin to recover from a long sickness. The
conversation of the people is contrary unto us; every one lends us some
stain, or imprinteth it in us, and leaves an impression in us before we can
beware: and the greater the company is wherewith we converse the greater is
the danger. But nothing is so hurtful to good manners as to sit in a Theater,
^or there by the pleasures we conceive, the vices steal on us more easily.
What think thou that I say? I tell thee that I not only return more
covetous, more ambitious, more luxurious, but more cruel and inhumane, because
I have been amongst men. By casualtie I fell upon the Shows at noone,
exspecting some sports and witty jests, and recreation whereby men's eyes might
be reposed awhile, that in the morning had been, fed with the shedding of
men's blood. But I find it contrary; whatsoever was fought before was mercy.
Now letting pass trifles, there is nothing but detested murder: combatants
have not wherewith to cover them, but expose their naked bodies to the stroke,
and never strike without wounding. This spectacle do many prefer before that
of the ordinary couples, or that of the extraordinary, asked for by the
people. And why should they not prefer the same? The weapon is kept off
neither by Helmet nor Target: whereto serve these fencings and Gladiatorie
Arts? All these are but the delays of death. In the morning men are exposed to
Lions and Bears, at noone to the spectators. The killers are commanded to be
set against those that are to kill, and they reserve him that is conqueror for
another slaughter: the end and aim of those that fight is death, by fire and
sword the matter is managed. These are done during the intermission of the
spectacle. But some man has committed a theft: what therefore deserves he? To
be hanged. He slew a man: he that slew him deserned to suffer no less. But
what, have thou deserved to behold this spectacle? Kill, burn, whip, why runs
he so fearfully on the weapon? Why killes he not courageously? Why dies he not
willingly? By strokes are they compelled to wounds, and with naked and exposed
bodies they receive the strokes of one another. Is the spectacle intermitted?
in the mean time men are slain, lest nothing should be done. Go too,
understand you not this, that evil example reflecteth on those that do this?
Give thanks unto the immortal gods, that you teach him to be cruel who
cannot learn. A tender mind and too little apprehensiue of the truth is to be
withdrawn from the common people: it is easy to find out many. The
frequentation of a different multitude might peradventure have shaken the great
minds of Socrates, Cato, and Laelius. So far is any of us (though in height
of our composed judgment) from being able to sustain the force and charge of
vices, coming with so great a troop. One only example of lust or avarice
causes much mischief. The company of a delicate man by little and little
effeminateth those that converse with him. A rich neighbor kindles our
covetousness. A mischievous and corrupt man rubbeth on the rust of his
infirmities, and soileth the most simple and vprightest man. What think thou
then will befall those to whom all the world flocketh and approaches
publicly? These of force must thou either imitate or hate; but both the one
and the other of these ought to be avoided, for fear lest thou be either like
unto the wicked, by reason they are many, or enemy to diverse, because they
are unlike to thee. Retire thy self therefore into thy self: haunt those who
can make thee better, admit those whom thou can better; for these things are
reciprocally done. Men in teaching others learn themselves. Above all things
beware lest thou expose thy self to great assemblies, or affectest to dispute
or teach by way of ostentation, or desire to show thy self. I could well with
that thou should do so, if thou could in any sort be profitable to the
people: but there is not any one amongst them that can understand thee; and if
happ^ly thou find out one or two, yet must thou instruct them how they may
understand thee. Why then will thou ask me, Have I learned these thing? Fear
not that thou have lost thy labor, if thou have learned these things for thy
self. But lest I should reserve unto my self the profit I have gotten this
day, I will communicate with thee three most worthy sentences to one sense; of
which the one shall be to acquit this Epistle of that which it owes thee; the
other two shall be given thee aforehand. Democritus says, I co^nt one only
for a whole multitude, and a whole multitude as one. And he whosoever he was ^
for it is doubted of the author, when it was demanded of him, why he took so
great pains to prefer an art, which should profit but a few, answered very
wisely. A few, says he, suffice me, one is enough, none is enough. And the
third is most excellent. Epicurus writing to one of the consorts of his
studies. These things, says he, write I not to many, but to thy self; for we
our selves are a Theater great enough for one another. Such things as these,
friend Lucilius, are they which thou must commit to memory, to the end to
contemn this pleasure which proceeds from the reputation and consent of
diverse. For to be praised by many, what cause find thou to rejoice at the
more? Then if thou be such as diverse do esteem thee, let them see thy goods
within thee.

EPIST. VIII.
This present depends on the former Epistle, and is as it were an Objection:
what, will thou that I avoid the multitude and the people? But thy Stoics
teach to follow business, and to die in affairs. He answers, that he
persuades not idleness, but a retirement by his example, who dismissing other
offices, intends wisdom, and propagateth the precepts thereof in writing.
This, says he, is of all actions the greatest and most excellent. In
conclusion, he inserteth that of EPICVRVS: that Philosophy gives true
liberty.

THou commaundest me by thy advice to fly the people, to retire my self
apart, and to be contented with my conscience: What shall then become of all
those precepts of thine, that commanded me to end my life in action? What,
seem I then in this interim to intertaine idleness? To this end have I
withdrawn my self, to this intent have I shut up my doors, that I might
profit many men. I spend not a day in idleness; yea, and for the most part of
the nights, I spend them in s^udie, maintayning and forcing mine eyes against
sleep. I retired my self not from me only, but from affairs, and
principally from mine own particular: I wholly traffic for posterity, by
writi^g that which may be profitable unto them: I set before their eyes in
writing many good and wholesome counsels, as it were receipts of profitable
medicines, which I have found fruitful in mine own ulcers; the which although
they be not altogether healed, have desisted to fester. I show others the right
way^ which I have learned too late: and after I have been too long wearied
with wandering and tracing here and there, I cease not to cry out. Fly all
those things which either please the common sort, or casualtie attributes:
run not after casual benefits, but rather suspiciously and fearfully
apprehend, and intertaine all uncertain pleasures. Both wild beast and fish
is bewitched with the bait is laid for them. Think you that these are the
gifts of Fortune? Trust me, they are her lyings in wait; what one soever of
us would live a sweet life, let him fly as much as he may these lim^d
benefits, wherein we most miserably be deceived. We think to enjoy them, and
they enjoy us: this course carries us to a down^fall. The issue of a life so
eminent is to fall; and that which is worse, it is impossible for us to stand,
when as ^elicitie has begun to transport us, and carry us hither and
thither: at least wise either content thy self with such things as are good
and certain, or be thou possessor and lord of thy self. Such as do this,
fortune does not only ouerturne them, but casts headlong and crusheth them.
Remember therefore to observe this wholesome and fruitful form of life, in
affoording thy body no further nourishment, then may suffice to continue thee
in good health: chastise the same severely, lest it rebel against the soul.
Let thy meat appease thy hunger, thy drink assuage thy thirst, thy coat cover
thee from cold, thy house be a defense against those things as may offend thy
body. It skilleth not whether it be builded of Turfe or rich Marble. Know that
a man is as well covered with Thatch as with Gold. Contemn all these things
which superfluous labor prefers either for show or ornament. Think that
there is nothing admi^able in thy self, but thy mind, to which nothing is
great, which even it self is great. If I discourse this with my self, if I
confer this with posterity, think thou not that I profit more, then when
as upon demand I pass my bond for my friend, or set my hand and seal in
testimony to a Testament, or should give my hand and suffrage to a candidate
in the Senate house? Believe me, those that seem to do least^ do the greatest
things; for they entreat both of divine and humane matters. But it is high time
for me now to make an end, and to pay that impost that I owe for this Epistle:
it shall not be at mine own expense, but on Epicurus charges; in whom this day
I read this sentence: Thou must of necessity serve Philosophy, to the end
thou may obtain true liberty. He that submits and subiecteth himself
to her, is on the instant made a freeman; for to serve her is to be at
liberty. Thou will think it strange peradventure why I usurp so often the
Epicures words, rather then those of other men; but wherefore think thou not
that those sayings are common and public? How many things are they which the
Poets have written, which have been or ought to be spoken by the Philosophers?
I mention not the Tragedians nor those Poems of ours, which are called Togatae;
for these have also some severity, and are the mean betwixt Comedies and
Tragedies: how many eloquent verses are there in use even amongst the Cynicks?
How many things of Publius, which not only exceed the Commodies, but are worthy
to be inserted in Tragedies? I will repeat one of his verses, which
appertains to Philosophy, and to this part which now last of all we debated
of, wherein he denies that we ought to account casual things our own; Each
thing is foreign that befalls by wishing.
I remember this Verse likewise of thine, not much better but more succinct; It
is not thine that fortune made thine.
Neither will I let slip that likewise which was far better set down by
thee: The good that might be given, may be bereft.
I require no acquittance for these; for I pay thee with thine own.

EPIST. IX.
A part and explication also of the former: that a wiseman seeks not men,
but is contented with himself. What then? Not a friend also; yea can he
likewise be without him: he can lose him, and having lost him, can repair him
again. In himself is the fruit and pleasure whilst he provides him. What for
his own cause as the Epicures think? No, but rather for another, whom he may
profit, for whom he may undergo danger, for whom he may die: the reward of
virtue is it self. At length more copiously and subtly: how far content
with himself, how far not; and in words some Stoicall distinctions.

THou desire to know, whether upon just ground the Epicure in a certain
Epistle of his, reprehendeth those that say, that he that is perfectly wise is
content with himself, and that for this cause he has no need of a friend:
this is objected by the Epicure to S^^lpho, and those who think that the
impassibilitie of the mind is their chiefest good. We shall fall into
ambiguitie, if we shall strive significantly to express the Greek word (...)
in one word, and call it Impatience. For the contrary of that which we would
express may be understood: for we intend, him that despises all sense of
evil, let him be conceived that can endure no evil: see therefore whether it
be better either to say an inuulnerable mind, or a mind settled beyond all
patience. The difference which is betwixt them and us is this; our wiseman
overcomes each incommoditie whatsoever, but feele^h the same; theirs has not
so much as a sense thereof. In this we accord, we say that a wiseman is
contented with himself, yet notwithstanding that he will have a friend, a
neighbor, a companion, although he himself suffices, and in such sort
suffices, that sometimes he is contented with a part of himself. For if
either a sickness or enemy has taken his hand from him, if any accident
has bereft him of his eye, that which remains with him shall su^fice him,
and as joyful shall he be in his maimed and mangled body, as he could be
were it whole. He had rather that he wanted nothing; nevertheless he desires
not that which he wants. Thus is a wiseman so far content with himself,
not that he will be without a friend, but that he can be; which is as much to
say, as that he bears patiently the loss of a friend, without a friend he
shall never be; it lies in his power to repair him as soon as him lists.
As Phidias having lost one statue, can suddenly fashion another; so this good
Artesan of amity suddenly substituteth another friend in the place of him that
is lost. If thou demandest of me, how he can so suddenly make and repair so
many friendships, I will tell thee, if this first all be agreed between us,
that I remain acquit of the debt of this letter. I will show thee, says
HECATON, a means to increase love without medicine, herb, or enchantment: if
thou will be beloved, love. But there is not only a pleasure in the fruition of
an old and ancient amity, but likewise in the creation of a new: and the same
difference is between him that has a friend already gotten, and him that is ^
getting, as between the laborer when he ^oweth and when he reapeth. Attalus the
Philosopher was wont to say, that it was a far more pleasant thing to make a
friend, then to have a friend; as it is more agreeable to a painter to paint,
then to have finished his picture. This attention which he applies to his
work, has in it self such sweetness, that he cannot be partaker of that
that has set his last hand to his labor: after he has painted, he
possesses the fruit of his art, but he took pleasure in the art it self
when he painted. The youth of our children is more fruitful unto us, but their
infancy more sweet. And to return to our purpose^ the wiseman although he be
content with himself, will notwithstanding have a friend, if to no other end
but to exercise his amity, will not endure that so great a virtue should
remain without use, not (as Epicurus said in the same Epistle) to have some
one to assist him when he is sick, or to succor him if he be in prison and
necessity, but contrariwise to the end he may have some one whom he may assist
and succor being sick, relieve and ransom being in need and captivity: for
he has an evil intention, that only respects himself, when he makes
friendship^ so shall he end his friendship even as he began the same. He that
has purchased himself a friend, to the intent he may be succored by him in
prison, will take his flight as soon as he feels himself delivered from his
bonds. These are those kinds of friendships, which the common sort call
Temporary. He that is made a friend for profit sake, shall please as long as
he may be profitable: so those that are in felicity see themselves environed
with a multitude of friends, and where the distressed make their abode there is
nothing but solitude: ^or such manner of friends fly those places where they
shall be proved: from thence we see so many wicked examples of some forsaking
for fear, of some betraying for fear. It is necessary that the beginning and
the end have correspondence. He that has begun to be a friend because it is
expedient, he that has thought that there is a gain in friendship beside it
self, may well be induced and suborned against the same, by the offer of a
greater gain. For what cause then do I entertain a friend? To the end to
have one for whom I may die, whom I may accompany in banishment, and for whose
life and preservation I may expose my self to danger and death. For the other,
which only regardest profit, and that make account of that which may yield
thee commodity, is rather a traffic then a friendship. Certain it is that
friendship has in some sort a similitude and likeness to the affections of
lovers. And not unfitly may a man call this passion a foolish amity. But the
scope of love is neither gain, nor ambition, neither glory; but despising all
other consideration of himself, he kindles in our souls the desire of the
beloved form, under hope of a mutual and reciprocal amity. And who dare say
that a vicious habitude is produced from a cause more honest. But if thou will
say unto me, that if friendship be so desired a thing in it self, it behooves
not a wiseman who is contented with himself to follow the same for any other
consideration, how honest soever it be, then for the beauty that remains in
the same: and that it is an abatement of the majesty and dignity thereof, to
obtain the same for any other respect. I will answer thee my friend Lucilius,
that where we say that the wiseman is contented with himself, is badly
interpreted by diverse men. They exclude every way the wiseman from every
place, and enclose him within himself. But we must distinguish what and how
far this word extends. The wiseman is contented with himself to live
happily, but not to live. To this diverse things are requsit; to that there
needs no more then an entire and erected mind, and such as despises
fortune. I will show thee how Chrysippus distinguishes them: He says that a
wiseman wants nothing, and yet has need of many things: a fool has need
of nothing^ because he can make use of nothing, but wants all things. The
wiseman has need of hands and eyes, and diverse other parts of him for the
ordinary uses of life, yet nevertheless he wants nothing: for to have need
imports necessity; but to him that is wise nothing is necessary. Thus
although he be content with himself, yet desisteth he not to make use of his
friends, but desires to have more, but not in regard that he has need of them
to live happily, for he can live happily without his friends. The sovereign
good seeks not external instruments, it is wholly accomplished in it self.
It begins to be subject unto fortune, ^f it have need to seek any part of
it self out of it self. But yet what shall a wise-mans life be, if he be left
in prison without friends, or if in some strange country he be abandoned of all
the world, or retained in some long Navigations, or cast on some desert and
unknown shore? Even as Jupiter, when in the dissolution of the world, and the
confused mixture of the gods all into one^ when the nature of things beginning
to cease by little and little, he reposeth himself, and retireth himself into
himself, given over to his own thoughts. The like does the wiseman, he is
hidden in himself, he is only with himself: but whilst it is lawful for him
to order his affairs, he is contented with himself: he marries a wife; he is
contented with himself: he brings up children, he is content in himself;
and yet would he not live, if he should live without mankind. No pro^it but a
natural instinct inciteth him to entertain friendship: for as in other things
we have a certain in bred sweetness, so have we of friendship. Even as
solitude is odious, so is company agreeable: even as nature associateth man
with man, so likewise is there a certain instinct in this, that makes us
desirous of friendships; notwithstanding although he be most affectionate to
his friends; although he equal and oftentimes prefer them before himself,
yet shall all his good be enclosed, and bounded within himself, and he shall
speak as Stilpon did, I mean him against whom Epicurus disputed in his
Epistle: for having, upon the surprisall and taking of the City wherein he
lived, lost his wife and children, and himself left desolate (yet nevertheless
happy and content) delivered from the public ruin and desolation. Demetrius
he that was surnamed Poliorcetes, that is to say the destroyer of Cities,
demanded of him if he had lost nothing. No (said he) I have lost nothing,
because all my goods are with me. Behold how this great and generous personage
is victorious over the victory of his own proper enemy. I have not (says
he) lost any thing. He compelled him to doubt, whether he were a conqueror, or
no. All my goods, says he, are with me, that is to say, justice, virtue,
temperance, prudence, and especially to think nothing good that may be taken
away. We wonder at some creatures that trauerse the fire without any harm; how
much more admirable was this man, that without loss or harm escaped both
fire, sword and ruin? Do thou see how far more easy it is, to conquer a
whole Nation then one man? This voice is common to him with the Stoicke, who in
his own person bears away his goods without hurt, through the midst of
Cities burned down, because he is content in himself: himself is the scope
of his own felicity. Think not that we alone are they that utter these great
and generous words. Epicurus himself that reprehendeth Stilphon, has spoken
to the like effect; which take in good part, although I have paid thee this
days rent already: Whosoever (says he) supposes not his own sufficient to
content him, though he be the Lord of this whole world, yet is he miserable. Or
if thou think it better spoken in this sort (for we must rely on sense, not
on words) He is miserable that thinks not himself most happy, although he
command the whole world. And to the end thou may know, that these senses are
common, which nature infuseth into all in general, thou shall find that in
the Cynique Poet, He is not blessed that thinks himself not so.
For what preuayleth it thee of what reckoning or estate thou art of, if in
thine own judgment it seem but abject? What then may thou say, if he that
is unworthily rich, and he who is lord over diverse other men, but slave unto
far more, calls himself happy; shall he be so? I tell thee that thou
ought not to regard that which he says, but that which he thinks; and not
that only which he thinks one day, but ordinarily. But do not fear lest an
unworthy man should enjoy so great a good: to no one but a wiseman can his
goods yield any pleasure; all folly labors with loathing of it self.

EPIST. X.
That solitude is only good to those that are good, and have profited in
goodness, to others otherwise: for wicked and foolish men commit most sin
therein, being removed from a reformer and left to themselves. By the way some
precepts of vows, and that we ought not to conceive any thing, except that
which we durst make known to every man.

SO it is, I change not mine opinion, but counsel thee to fly the great
assemblies, yea the least; and not the least only, but the frequentation of
one alone. I find not any man with whom I would have thee to converse.
Consider a little the judgment that I have of thee; I dare well trust thy
self to thy self. Cra^es the Auditor of that Stilpon, of whom I made mention
in my former Epistle, when he perceived a young man walking apart by himself,
asked him what he did there all alone? I speak, said the young man, unto my
self. Take heed, I pray thee, replied Crates, that thou speak not with a
wicked man. We are accustomed to observe those that mourn and fear, when they
retire themselves apart, for fear lest they abuse their solitude. There is no
imprudent man that ought to be left alone: for then is the time that they
complot and devise their evil designs, and study how to effect their evil
intents, both to themselves and others: then dispose they their unlawful
desires: at that time the mind discovers and publishes that which before
time their fear or shame enforced them to conceal: then animate they their
boldness, quicken they their lusts, and awaken their choler. To conclude, the
only good that solitude has in it self, which is to commit nothing to any
man, and to fear no reuealer, that is lost to a fool: for he discovers and
betrayeth himself. Consider thou that which I hope, or rather that which I
promise my self of thee (for to hope is a word of uncertain good) I find not
any man with whom I could better find in my heart that thou should be
conversant, then with thy self. When I called to remembrance the high and
generous discourses that I have heard thee utter, I did congratulate with my
self, and said, These are not words only, but these words have their
foundations; this man is not of the vulgar, he tends to safety. Continue
then my friend Lucilius, and speak always after this manner, live continually
thus, that one thing abase thee not, neither master thy courage. Give thanks
unto god for the ancient vows thou have made unto him, and recommend unto him
all the new thou have conceived: ask at his hands a good mind, and first of
all pray unto him for the health of thy spirit, and next for that of thy body.
Why should thou not oftentimes make these vows unto him? boldly beseech
god, since thou intendest to ask nothing of him that is another man's. But to
the end that according to my custom I may accompany this letter of mine with
some present, receive that which I have found to day in Athenodorus: Then know
that thou art disburdened of all evil desires, when thou have attained so
far, that thou demand nothing at gods hands, but that which may be required
of him openly. For how great at this day is the madness of men? They mumble
betwixt their teeth some vileinous prayers, and are suddenly silent if any man
yield an ear unto them, supposing to hide that from men which they are not
ashamed to discover unto God: judge then if this precept should not be
profitable; So live with men as if God saw thee, so speak with God as if men
should hear thee.

EPIST. XI.
That he hoped well of LVCILIVS his friend, in whom appeared much
shamefastness and blushing. That the same is sometimes natural, and cannot be
shaken off by any precepts, and follows a wiseman also. that sometimes it
appears in evil men, and is a sign of evil. Then he cites a wholesome
admonition of EPICVRVS. That we ought always represent unto our selves a good
man, who might restrain us as a Tutor; and that we should do and speak all
things as if he were present.

THat honest natured man thy friend has spoken with me. The first words he
uttered, incontinently testified unto me how great his hurt was, and how good
his spirit, and how much he had profited in the study he had enterprised: he
left me a taste, whereunto I assure my self he will answer; for I have taken
him upon the sudden, and he has spoken unto me without preparation. When he
recollected himself he easily blushed, which is a good sign in a young man,
yea, so blushed as he could not moderate it. I doubt not but when he shall be
best retired, and despoyled of all his vices, that then this complexion will
accompany him, yea, even then when perfect wisdom has possessed him. For
those vices which are connaturall either in mind or body, cannot be wholly
defaced by any industry. That which is borne with us may be sweetened and
corrected by art, but neither mastered or rooted out. It has bin noted that
the most assured men in this world, at such time as they presented themselves
before a great assembly, to discourse of any thing, were no less troubled with
a cold sweat, then they that are weary and pant with travel: to some their
knees tremble, to others their teeth chatter, their tongue varies, their lips
simper. Neither discipline nor use can wholly take from them these
imperfections: for nature exercises his force herein, and admonishes each one
of his defects and weakness, and I know that blushing is to be numbered
amongst these things. For ofttimes we observe that it spreads it self, and
flusheth even in the face of the grauest men, yet is it more apparent in young
men, who have more heat and are of a soft nature, notwithstanding the eldest
are not exempt from the ^ame. Some there are that are never so much to be
feared then when they blush, as if at that instant they had lauished out all
their shamefastness. Then was Sylla most violent when his face was most read.
There was nothing more soft then Pompeis countenance. For he never spoke in
solemn company without blushing. And I remember that Fabianus did as much,
being summoned by the Senate to depose in a certain matter, and herein his
blushing did marueilously become him, This happens not through the feebleness
of the mind, but rather from the novelty of the accident, which although it
shake not, yet moves it these which are not accustomed and exercised, and who
by a na^urall facility and tenderness of their body, are subject to
blushing. For as th^re a^^ some who have their blood both good and well
rempered, so othersome have it moveable, and ready to flush up into the face.
No wisdom, as I have said, can take away this infirmity, otherwise nature it
self should be subject thereunto, if wisdom had power to raze out those vices
which she had imprinted in us. That which attends us through the condition of
our birth, and the temperature of our bodies, when the mind has much and long
time composed it self, will remain continually. We cannot eschew these things
at our pleasures, no more then we can command them to come at our will. The
Commedians who imitate affections, who express fear and trembling, who
represent sorrow, are accustomed to counterfeit shamefastness after this
manner: they cast down their countenance, they speak softly, they fix their
eyes on the ground, but blush they cannot; for blushing may n^yther be
prohibited nor commanded. Wisdom promises nothing against those things;
profits nothing: such things as these receive no law but from themselves;
they come against our wills, and depart without asking leave. Now this Epistle
requires a clausuall; receive then from me this precept, as most necessary
and behouefull for thee, and which I wish thee always to retain in memory: We
ought to choose out some good man, and always fix him before our eyes, that we
may so live as if he always looked on, and do al things as if he continually
beheld us. This, O my friend Lucilius, is one of Epicurus precepts. He
intends to give us a Guardian and a Tutor, and not without cause. The
greatest part of sins is taken away, when a witness is always present with
him that would offend. Let the mind therefore propose unto it self some
personage that she respects, by whose authority she may make her secret
more holy and more religious. O how happy is he that not only reformeth his
actions but his thoughts! Happy is he that can respect one of that sort, that
by the only remembrance of him he can reform his mind: who can respect in
that sort shall suddenly be made worthy to be respected himself. Choose
therefore Cato, or if he seem unto thee ouer-sharp and severe, choose L^lius,
who is more facile and sweet: choose him whose life and words shall be most
agreeable unto thee, and fixing always before thine eyes his mind and
countenance, take him either for thy guide or thine example. It behooves us to
have some one, according to whose manners we may conform our own. Such things
as are depraved, are not corrected but by rule.

EPIST. XII.
He pleasantly discourses of his old age, and shows how he was admonished
thereof in his countrey-house, but so admonished that it was without grief.
That his old age must not be tedious but pleasant, and less subject to vices.
That all life is short, but whatsoever to be made ours by use, and that hand is
to be laid thereon. Let us daily say and think we have lived.

ON which side soever I turn my self I perceive the proofs of mine old age:
I repaired lately to my countrey-farme, which adioyneth the City, and
complained of my daily expense in reparations, and my Bayliffe that had the
keeping thereof answered me, that it was not his fault, alleging that he had
done the best that he could, but that the building was ouer-olde and ruinous;
yet notwithstanding it was I my self that builded it, I leave it to thee to
judge of me, since the stones of mine age decay so much through antiquity.
Being touched herewith I took occasion to be displeased with him upon every
first thing that encountreth me in my walk. It well appears, said I, that
^hese Plane trees are not well labored, they are altogether leauelesse, their
boughs are knottie and withered, and their stocks covered with moss and
filthiness: this would not happen if any man had dug about them, and watered
them as they ought to be. He swears by my Genius, that he does his uttermost
endeavor, and that he has neglected them in no manner, but that the trees were
old. Then remembered I my self that I had planted them with mine own hands,
and seen them bear their first leaf. Turning my self to the door, what
decrepit fellow is that, said I, that for his age is left at the gate as dead
bodies are wont to be, for he looks outward? Whence came he? What pleasure
have thou to carry forth the carcass of a strange man? Know thou me not,
says he? I am Felicio to whom thou were wont to bring childish gifts; I am the
son of Philo^itus thy Bayliffe, thy play-fellow. Undoubtedly, said I, this
man doateth. My darling then is become an infant; undoubtedly it may so be, for
he is almost toothlesse. This owe I to my Farm, that my old age appears
unto me which way soever I turn my self. Let us then embrace and love the
same^ it is wholly replenished with agreeable delights, if a man know how to
make use of it. The Apples are never so good then when they begin to wither and
ripen. Infancy is must agreeable in the end thereof. To those that delight in
carrowsing, the last draught is most pleasant, that which drowneth him in wine,
and consummateth his drunkenness. Whatsoever most contenting, all pleasure
has contained in her self, is deferred till the end. The age that declineth
is also most agreeable, when as yet it is not wholly decr^pit and spent:
neither judge I that age, without his particular pleasure, whose foot is
almost in the grave, or thus succeeds in place of pleasure that he needs
none. O how sweet and pleasant a thing is it to see a man's self discharged of
all covetousness! But thou may say that it is a tedious thing, to have
death always before a man's eyes: first of all this ought as well to be
presented to a young as to an old man's eyes; for we are not called by the
Censor according to our estate, and there is none so old that hops not to
live at least one day longer: and one day is a degree of life; for all our age
consist^th of many parts, and is a sphere that has diu^rs circles, the one
enclosed within the other. And one there is that incloseth and comprehends
all the rest, which is that of the Nativity until death; another that
excludes the years of youth, another that contains all childhood; after
these succeeds the year which incloseth all, the time by the multiplication
whereof life is composed. In the circle of the year is the month, and in that
of the month is the day, which is the least of all: yet notwithstanding he
has his beginning and his end, his rise and his set. And for this cause
Heraclitus that was called Scotinus, by reason of the obscurity of his speech,
said that one day is like to all which another has interpreted after another
manner to wit, that one day is like to all; in number of hours: and he said
true; for if a day be the time of four and twenty hours, it is necessary
that they should be all alike, because the night has that which the day has
lost: another said that one day was like to all, by reason of the conformity
and resemblance; for there is nothing in the space of a very long time, that
thou shall not find in one day the light and the night, the turns and
returns of the heavens. The shortness and length of the nights make these
things more plainly appear. Therefore ought we to dispose of every day, in
such sort as if it did lead up the rereward of our time, and should consummate
our lives. Pa^^uius he that usurped over Syria, being buried in the evening,
being buried in his wine, and those meats which he had caused to be richly
and sumptuously prepared for him, as if he himselefe had solemnized his own
obsequies, caused himself to be transported from his banquet to his bed, in
such manner, that amidst the dances and clapping of hands of his curtezans, it
was sung to the Music, He has lived, he has lived: and no day ouer-passed
his head wherein he buried not himself after this manner. That which he did of
an evil conscience let us perform with a good, and addressing our selves to
our rest, let us joyfully and contentedly say, I have lived, and ended the
course that fortune gave me.
If God vouchsafe us the next morrow, let us receive the same with
thanksgiving. He is thrice-happie, and assuredly possessed of himself that
expects the next day without care. Whosoever has said I have lived, does
daily rise to his profit. But now I must close my letter: What, say thou,
shall it come to me without any present? Do not fear, it shall bring somewhat
with it. Why said I somewhat? It will be a great deal. For what can be more
excellent then this sentence, It brings unto thee? It is an evil thing to
live in necessity, but there is no necessity to live in necessity: for the
way that leads unto liberty is on every side open, short, and easy to
keep. Let us give God thanks for this, that no man can be constrained to live,
and that it is lawful for every one to tread necessity under his feet. Thou will say, that these words are of Epicurus. What have thou to do^ with another
man's? That which is true is mine, I will persevere to urge Epicurus unto thee,
that they who swear and consent to the words, and consider not what is spoken,
but by whom; let them know, that those things are best that are common.

EPIST. XIII.
He excellently informs against casualties, and ^^^^^rageth against them: But
especially he advises us not to be tormented with the ^eare of things to come;
he a^^weth them to be uncertain, and such as may not fall out. He concludes
therefore that ^ll fear is to be tempered by hope. Then adds he this, full
of far more confidency; Do and teach things to come, they are of God, and
for our good.

I Know that thou have much courage; for before I instructed thee with wholesome
precepts, and such as subdue adversity, thou were contented enough to exercise
thy self against fortune, and have assured thy self also far more, since
thou have made trial of thy forces, and grapled with her hand to hand; which
can never give an assured proof of themselves, but where as many difficulties
shall appear on every side, yea, sometimes nearly assault them. In like
manner a true mind, and such as will not subject it self to other men's wills,
approves it self: This is his touch stone. The wrestler cannot enter lists
with an undaunted courage, who has never been sharply encountered and beaten.
He that has oftentimes seen his blood shed, whose teeth have be^ne shattered
by a fist. H^ that having been overthrown has made his enemy lose his
footing, that being cast down has not lost his courage, that as oftentimes as
he has been ^oyled recovered new footing and became more fell and furious, he
that, I say enters the field with the greatest assurance. And to persist in
this similitude; Fortune has oftentimes been above thee, yet have thou never
at any time yielded thy self her prisoner, but have always restored thy
self, and made head against her with more courage and alacrity: and in truth
also a generous mind gets ordinarily some advantage when he is provoked;
notwithstanding if thou think it good, accept some forces from me to
strengthen and defense thy self more and more. Diverse things, my Lucilius, do
more fear th^n hurt us, and oftentimes we are more troubled by opinion then
effect. I reason not with th^e at this time in a Stoicall language, but
somewhat more submisly and vulgarly: for we say that all these things, which
cause in us these fears and gronings, are but light and contemptible. Let us
omit these great words, yet notwithstanding most true. I only admonish thee
not to make thy self miserable before thy time, by fearing that those things
are wholly near unto thee, which happily will never befall thee, or at
leastwise are not yet happened. Somethings therefore do more afflict us then
they ought, some before they ought, othersome torment us when they should not
at all. We either augment our evil, or presuppose the same, or imagine them to
our selves upon no ground at all: that first because the matter is in
controversy, and the pleas are already recorded; let us defer for the
present. That which I term light thou contendest to be most grievous: I know
that some do laugh in their tortures, others groan for a little stroke. We
afterward shall see whether these things are to be valued by their own forces
or our weakness. First grant m^ this, that as oftentimes as thou shall be
amongst men, that shall endeavor to persuade thee that thou art miserable, thou will grow into consideration with thy self, not of that which thou hear,
but of that which thou feel: consult first of al with thy patience, and ask
thou thy self. Who should better know tha^ which touches thee then thy sel^^^
Speak unto thy self thus; Why is it that these men lament my fortune? (...)
tremble they, as if they feared that the ^^^^gion of my misfortune should
attaint and torment them? That which I (...) is it not more infamous then
dan^erous? Enquire of thy self after this manner: Am I not perplexed and
sorrow^^ll without cause? Make I not that an evil which is not? How say
thou, shall I understand whether the things I fear be ^yther v^^ne or true?
Take this rule to discern the same: either present, or future, or both
terrify us: the judgment of the present is facile, if the body be free,
healthful, and without any grief, caused by some injury done unto thee. We
shall see what shall happen hereafter, to day thou have no need to complain.
But it will come. First consider whether there be any certain argum^nts of thy
future misfortune; for, for the most part we are troubled with suspicions, and
affrighted by the illusions of common report, which is accustomed to end whole
wars, but much more particular men. Undoubtedly so it is my friend Lucilius,
we are quickly conceited and ouer-ruled by common opinion: we check not those
things which cause our fears, neither shake them off: but tremble thereat, and
turn our backs like those whom a cloud of dust, raised by the triumphing of a
troop of beasts puts to flight, or those that are dismayed by a report that
runs abroad, that has neither ground nor author. And by mishap, I know not
how it comes to pass that false and fained things do trouble us far more
then true; for the true have a certain measure, the others are delivered us to
a wandering conjecture, and license of the fearful mind, which is already
affrighted: whence it happens that there are no dismayes so pernicious and
irremediable then those that are mad and distracted; for all the rest are
without reason, but this without mind. Let us diligently inquire upon this
business; Is it likely some mischance will happen? It is not straight-wayes
true. How many unexpected things have chanced? How many expected never came to
pass? And put the case it should happen, what helps it to meet with a man's
sorrow? We shall partake the pain too ouertimely when it comes, mean while
let us promise to our selves some better success; at the leastwise it shall be
so much good time gotten. And again, many things may fall out, by means
whereof the danger when it shall be more, yea, almost borne by us, either shall
subsist or wholly pass away, or happily shall be diuerted on another man's
head. Oft-times the flames have broken and given passage through the midst of
their fury, to avoid themselves. Such a one has fallen from the top of a
house that was softly laid when he light on the ground. Sometimes he that was
exposed to his last punishment, has been saved even in the very attempt of
execution, and some have suruiued to bury those who should have been their
hangmen: evil fortune it self is never without her inconstancy and leuitie.
It may be the mischance shall come, it may be it shall not come: and mean
while that it is not come, at least propose unto thy self that better fortune
may befall thee. But contrariwise, that happens sometimes, that even then
when there is no appearance of evil presage, the mind faineth to it self
false imaginations, or interprets some word of a doubtful signification to
the worst, or proposes to it self the indignation and displeasure of some one
greater then it is, and dreameth not how much he is incensed, but how much he
may if so be he be provoked. But there is no more occasion of living, there is
no end of misery, if a man fear as much as he may fear. It behooves
contrariwise to reject and contemn the fear it self which is attended every
way with apparent occasions. Herein it is, where (...) prudence and the force
of ou^ vn^^^^^anding ought principally to serve (...)wise it be sits us to
(...) one vice by another, and to temp^^ (...) hope. For there is not^^^^ ^o
certain of all that which a man may (...) that is not also more cer^^ine, that
the things that are feared may (...) and vanish, and those that are hoped for
deceive. Balance therefore the (...) with thy hope; and if there be doubt on
all sides, believe that which be^^^keth thee, and thou co^ldest desire should
fall out; and although thou s^^lt have more and (...) probable appearances for
to fear, notwithstanding dispose thy self to f^uour the better part, and
cease to afflict thy self. Discourse always in thy understanding, that the
greatest part of mortal men are troubled and perplexed in themselves for a
thing wherein there is no evil, neyth^r can there be any evil, and the reason
hereof is, because no man resists himself when he begins to be shaken and
assaulted. No man pretends to take the pains to verify his fear, no man
thinks with himself that the author is a vain man, that either might have
dreamed the same, or believed it lightly. We yield our selves wholly to him
that first comes and reports any thing unto us: we fear the incertaine as
certain, neither can we keep any measure. A doubt does incontinently become
fear. But I am ashamed to talk after this manner with thee, and to apply
unto thee so slight remedies: when any other man shall say unto thee; be
confident that which thou fear shall not befall thee, say thou quite
contrary, and when it shall happen, what of that? Perhaps it shall be for my
good and advantage if it happen, and this death shall do honor to my life.
Ceuta has made Socrates most famous and renowned. Wrest from Cato the sword
that assured his liberty, and thou shall detract from him the greatest part of
his glory. True it is, that I am too tedious in exhorting thee, who have no
need to be exhorted, but instructed and admonished only. These are not
contrary to thy nature, thou art borne to accomplish all that which we speak
of; and by so much more ought thou to be careful, to augment and beautify
the graces that nature has given thee. But now is it high time to finish my
Epistle, as soon as I have signed it with some high and generous sentence, to
be conuayed unto thee: Amongst other evils folly has likewise this, that it
begins always to live. Consider, worthy Lucilius, what these things
signify, and thou shall understand how loathsome men's leuitie is, who are
always occupied to project new foundations of life, and in their last time
bethink them of new hopes. If thou cast thine eye on every man, thou shall
meet with old men that address themselves to ambition, travel, and
negotiations. And what is there more absurd, then for an old man to begin to
live? I would not allege the author of this sentence, if that it were not one
of the most secret, and not couched amongst the vulgar speeches of Epicurus,
which I have permitted my self both to usurp and adopt as mine own.

EPIST. XIIII.
A most wise Epistle. He admonishes that care must be had of the body and of
life, but not too much: but that three things are feared touching the body;
Poverty, Sickness, and Violence, but especially this last, which proceeds
from powerful men and tyrants: To the end thou may not fear, three things
are to be avoided; Hatred, Envy, and Contempt. But how wisdom shall
instruct, and in short words he.

I Confess that ^^ture has imprinted in every one (...) ^ffection and care of
(...) person. I confess that our body (...) tuteli^ and prote^^^on. I deny
not but that we ought to use (...) indulgence in the behalf thereof, yet ought
it not to hold us in servitude. He shall be slave to ^^ny that will be slave
to his own body, shall too much fear for the same, and refer all things
unto that. So ought we to behave ou^^^lues, not as though it behooved us to live
for our body; but as if we might not live without the same. The too tender
affection we bear unto it, disquieteth us with fears, charge us with diverse
thoughts, and exposes and subiecteth us to disgraces. Honesty is base to him,
that makes too much account of his body. Reason it is that it be kept
carefully, yet so, as when reason, honor, and faith requires it, a man be
ready to cast it into the midst of a fire. Let us fly notwithstanding as
much as in us lies, not only the dangers, but the incommodities. Let us
secure our selves and retire us into a place of security, thinking hourly, by
what means we may separate from us those things which are to be feared; of
which (if I deceive not my self) there are three sorts: we fear poverty, we
fear sickness, we fear those things that may befall us through the violence
of the mighty. Of all these three is no one thing more that shakes us, then
that which hangs over us from another man's greatness, for that comes with
a great noyce and tumult. The natural evils which I have reckoned up, such as
are pouerties and infirmit^es, do silently assault us: they neither affright
our eyes nor our ears, but the other mischief marches forth with greater
pomp. He has about him fire, sword, and bonds, and a troop of greedy wild
beasts to glut themselves on our entrails. So many prisons, so many gallowses,
so many rackes and hooks, and the stakes which men are splitted on, the
tortures of drawing a man with wild horses, and such other types of tyranny,
the variety whereof is so great, and the preparation so terrible. No marvel
though they bring much fear with them: for even as the hangman, the more
instruments of torture he presents to the condemned, the more he afflicts
him; so amongst those things that surcharge and wound our minds, those have the
greatest force that present the most objects to the eye. This is not to infer
that other plagues, I mean famine, thirst, ulcers, and impos^umes of the
inwards, and the feuor which dries and burns our bowels, are not as tedious
and painful, but that they are hidden, having nothing that they may produce,
or cause to martch before them. These as great armies obtain the entry by the
greatness of their show and preparation. But the true remedy against these
dangers, is to abstain to provoke them. Sometimes the people are those whom we
ought to fear; sometimes, if the discipline of the City be such, that diverse
things are concluded by the Senate, some gracious men therein, or some one
particular man that bears the sway of the Commonwealth, and has the
government over the people. To have all these thy friends is too difficult, it
is enough for thee that thou have them not thine enemies. A wiseman therefore
will n^uer provoke the displeasure of the mighty, but rather will decline the
same, in such sort, as in sailing the Marrin^r shunneth a storm. When thou
shippedst for Sicily, thou did cut over the Sea, and the unadvised Master
of thy ship contemned the threatening South^rnly winds, which is that wind
which exasperateth the Sicilian Seas, and drives on the shoales and
whirlpooles; he shapeth not his course by the left shore, but sayleth by that
shore which is nearer Charibdis. But some other more skillful, would have
enquired of those of the country before he had embarked himsel^e, of the
nature of this Sea, and of the signs which the clouds imported, and had held
his course far aloof from these dangerous places and whirlepools. In like
sort does the wiseman, he flies those that may hurt him, having an especial
regard to this, that he seem not to fly them: for the greatest part of
security consists in this, to make no show or appeareance to search the
same; because that those things which a man flies he condemns. We must
therefore look about us, how we may be secure from the common sort, which we
shall bring to pass, if first of all we covet not any of those things, which
set competitors together by the ears; and then, if we have not any thing, that
by appearance of profit may make us subject to treacheries: I also counsel
thee that thou have not any thing in thy body that thou may be spoiled of.
No man thirsts after a man's blood only, or at leastwise very few. The
greater sort rather hunt after the prize then the life. A naked man walks
freely before the thief^ and in a dangerous passage a poor man finds no man
to bid him stand. Afterward it behooves thee, according to the ancient
precept, to endeavor thy self to avoid three things; that is, to be hated,
envied, and despised. Wisdom only can show us how this may be affected,
otherwise it is a hard thing and much to be feared, lest distrust of envy
bring us into contempt, lest whilst we will not be trod upon, we seem able to
be trod on. It has been a cause of much fear to mani^ by having power to be
feared. Let us every way retire our selves: it is no less harmefull to be
contemned then to be admired at. Let us therefore have recourse unto
Philosophy, the instructions whereof shall be as marks of dignity unto us,
not only with good men, but such also as are indifferently evil: for
eloquence and such other professions, which tend to move the common sort, have
their adversary; but it is peaceable and retired, and such as intermixeth it
self with nothing but it self, that neither can be contemned, which is
respected by all other arts, yea by the consent of the most wicked. Never
shall vice obtain so great force, never shall any conspire so much against
virtue, but that the name of Philosophy shall always remain holy and
venerable; yet must Philosophy it self be moderately and peaceably handled.
True it is, that happily thou will object unto me, that Marcus Cato has not
handled the same with that modesty, who persuaded himself, that he might
repress by his only counsels the heat of civil wars, that thrust
himself amidst the armies of two displeased and enraged Princes, that whereas
some displeased Pompey, other some Caesar, he feared not to offend them both at
once. But I will answer thee, that it may be debated, whether during that time
it was wisely done of him to busy himself with public affairs? What
pretendest thou to do Cato? The title of liberty was not then in question;
for long time before it was trodden under foot: the question is only whether of
these two either Caesar or Pompey shall be master of the Commonweal: what
had thou to do with this quarrel? Thou had no part herein; the
question was to choose a Sovereign: what could it avail thee which of them it
were that conquered? The better cannot conquer, and he may be the worst that
shall be subdued; he cannot be the better that gets the masterie. I have
touched the last parts of Catoes life, but neither were his former years ever
such, that it was convenient for a wiseman to intermeddle with the
Commonweal, which was already exposed for a pray. For what other thing did he
but exclaim, and cast out unprofitable speeches, whilst the people taking him
up, playde with him like a football, spit in his face, and drew him perforce
out of his place, and from the Senate House led him unto prison? But we shall
see hereafter, whether a wiseman ought to employ his labor in a place where it
should be utterly lost? Mean while I recall thee to ^hese Stoics, who
excluded from the Commonweal, retired themselves to reform men's lives, and to
make laws for all mankind, without incurring the indignation of the mighty.
Undoubtedly it is more expedient for a wiseman to behave himself thus, then
to go and trouble public customs, and cause himself to be pointed at
through the strangeness of his life. What then? shall he that follows this
course be wholly safe and secured? No more may a man promise this then health
to a temperate man, and yet temperance entertaineth and causes the same. It
has been seen sometimes that ships have been lost in the Haven, but the
danger is greater when they sail in the maine Sea: how much more at hand
should his danger be, that intermedleth with many affairs, and complotteth
more, who cannot assure himself, no not in his solitude? The innocent is
sometimes condemned, but the faulty far more often. His art costeth him
dear, that is harmed by the very ornaments of art. Finally, the wiseman
regards that which is most expedient in every thing, and not the success:
for our deliberations are in our hands; but fortune disposes of the events, to
whose judgment a wise^man never submits himself, yet will it bring some
vexation and adversity. The thief is not condemned but when he kills. But I
perceive thou stretchest out thy hand to receive a rent which this letter
should bring thee, I will pay thee in golden see thou how the use and fruition
of the same may be more grateful unto thee; He most of all possesses riches;
that least needs them. Tell me, thou will say, who is the author? That thou
may know how bountiful I am, I intend to praise another man's; it is either
Epicurus or Metrodorus saying, or some one of that sect: what skilleth it who
spoke it? he spoke to all men. He that wants riches, fears for them: but no
man enuieth a good that breeds fear: whilst he thinks to increase the
same, he forgets the use of them; it behooves him always to have the
counters in his hand, to assist at the bursse time, and visit his books of
account: briefly, of a Master he becomes a Factor.

EPIST. XV.
Exercise tends to the care of the body; but let it not be laborious or
troublesome: easy and short suffices, as running, leaping, carriage of the
body, intention of the voice. A clause from the Epicure, to the end that life
should not be deferred, content thee with the present.

THE ancients had a custom, which has been observed as yet to my time, to
begin their letters with these words; If thou art in health, it is well; for
mine own part I am healthie. Now think I that he should say as well, who
should begin thus: If thou attendest thy Philosophy, I am glad of it, for that
in truth is to be in health. Without it the mind is sick, and the body also
notwithstanding it be strong and able: for it is no otherwise healthie then as
a man might say, the body of one that is mad and troubled with the frenzy.
Have care therefore especially of this first health, afterward of the second,
which will not cost thee much, if thou behave thy self wisely. For it is an
unseemly thing for a man that trauelleth to obtain wisdom, to employ
himself in exercising his arms, to feed himself fat, and to strengthen his
sides. When thou shall make thy self fleshy and brawny to the uttermost thou
can imagine, yet neither in force or weight shall thou equal a fat and
grown Ox. Besides this, the mind being choked up with the great charge of
thy body, is far less agile and quick of conceit. Contain therefore and
restrain thy body the most that thou may, to the end thou may give a
fayrer and more spacious place and harbor unto thy mind. They that are
ouer-carefull of the same, draw after them diverse incommodities: first of all
the travel of exercise spends the spirit, and disableth it to apprehend the
study of the most secret and hidden secrets. And they lead with them a train
of most dangerous reuolts and debauchments, as that foul and vilainous custom
of men, occupied between the wine and the oil, in whose opinion the day is
happily passed, if they have sweat well; and if in stead of that which is
exhaled by sweat, they have anew replenished their empty stomachs with store
of another liquor. To drink and sweat is the life of him that is sick of the
Cardiacque conuersions of the stomach. There are certain kinds of exercise,
which are easy and short, which loose and supple the body, without great loss
of time, to which we ought to have a principal regard, as to run, dance,
leap, and vault. Choose of all these which thou will: the use will make it
easy unto thee: whenever thou do retire suddenly from thy body to thy
mind, exercise the same day and night. She is nourished and entertained with
a little labor: neither cold nor heat hinder not her exercise, no not old age
it self. Travel therefore carefully after this good, which is bettered by
waxing old, yet will I not always that thou hang over thy book, or that thy
hand be continually laboring on thy tables. There must some intermission be
granted to the mind; yet so, that it be not given over altogether, but
remitted only. The carriage of a man in a Litter or otherwise, stirs the
body, but hinders not the study. Thou may read, dictate, speak and
hear also in walking. Contemn not also the elevation of thy voice, which I
forbid thee to raise by certain degrees and manners, and afterward to
depresse. Again, if thou will learn how thou should walk, admit those
whom hunger has taught new cunnings: some there be that will temper thy pace,
and observe thy mouth as thou eatest, and will proceed so far, as by the
leuitie of thy patience thou shall give way to their boldness; what then?
shall thy voice and discourse begin with clamorous accents, and in the entrance
be most violently enforced? Undoubtedly it is a thing so natural to raise the
voice by little and little, that such as plead are ordinarily accustomed to
begin their discourse in an humble and submisse manner, and to prosecute the
same with a more lively and louder accent. No man at the first imploreth ^he
mercy of the Judges. Howsoever therefore the force of thy mind shall persuade
thee sometimes to exclaim on vices vehemently, sometime more moderately,
according as thy voice and force shall enable thee: when thou have humbled the
same, and drawn it to a lower strain and pitch, so let it fall that it fail
not: let it be tempered according to the ability and discretion of the
speaker, and not break out after a ru^^icke and uncivil manner. For it is not
our intention to exercise the voice, but our mind is, that our voice should
exercise us. I have disburthened thee of no small business of requital, now
will I add a grateful office to these benefits. Behold a worthy precept: The
life of a foolish man is ingrate, and full of ^eare, and wholly transported
with expectation of future things. But who, say thou, speaks after this
manner? The same that spoke before. Now what life is that which in thy opinion
may be called foolish, that of Babae and Ixion, the noted fools of our time?
It is not so. It is, and is called our life whom blinded covetousness casts
headlong upon those things which torment us, or at least whiles never content
us, to whom if any thing had been sufficient, already it should be. Who
consider not how pleasant a thing it is to demand nothing, and how magnificent
a thing it is to be full in himself, and not to hold or acknowledge any thing
from fortune. Remember thy self therefore every hour, friend Lucilius, how
great those things are to which thou have attained hitherto, when thou have
beheld those things that march before thee^ behold also those that march after.
If thou will not be ungrateful toward God, and toward thine own life,
c^nsider how many thou leauest behind thee. But why compare I thee with
others? Thou have, if thou obseruest thy self well^ gone b^yond thy self.
Prefix thy self certain bounds which thou will not exceed or break although
thou might. The flattering and deceivable blessings, and such as prove
better to those that hope for them then those that enjoy them, will vanish in
the end. If there were any solid thing in them, they would sometime satisfy
us: or contrariwise they inuit us to taste them only for their appearance;
and the more a man tastes the more is he altered. But that which the
incertaine fate of future time carries with it self, why should I rather
entreat fortune to bestow upon me, or my self not to demand the same? And why
in demanding the same should I forget the frailty of mankind? Shall I hoord
up wealth? To what? Shall I take pains? Behold here the last day, or if it be
not, it is the next neighbor to the last.

EPIST. XVI.
That Philosophy is necessary to life; but that is the true only which is in
action and proficient. Dispose by that thine actions and counsa^les. It
skilleth not whether ^ate or fortune be: for Philosophy teaches to obey God,
and contemn fortune and casualties. There is a clause likewise of EPICVRVS. He
that lives according to nature is rich. Despise opinion.

I Know, friend Lucilius, that thou perfectly understand that no man can
live happily, nay, scarcely tollerably without the study of wisdom, and that
the life is made happy by the perfection of the same, and tolerable by her
only beginning. But it suffices not only that thou know this, it behooves
thee also to imprint it in thy soul, and assure the same by continual
cotemplation. For there is less to do to propose a thing which is honest, then
to conserve the same, when a man has proposed the same to himself. We must
persevere, and by continual diligence add strength, till that which is now
only a good will, may become an habitual good mind. Thou need not
therefore to court me with many affirmative and long discourses: for I know
that thou have profited very much. I know from what mind the things thou
writest do proceed, and that they are neither fained nor disguised: yet will I
tell thee freely mine opinion. I have already some hope of thee, but not as
yet an entire assurance; and if thou will believe, thou shall conceive no
otherwise of thy self. Believe not thy self so suddenly and so easily. Sound
and observe thy self, and above all things se^ whether thou have profited,
either in thy science or in thy life it self. Philosophy no vulgar craft,
neither is it for ostentation: it consists not in words but in deeds. She
must not be made use of to pass the time withal, or extinguish the
tediousness of idleness. She it is that forms and conformeth the mind,
that disposes life, and guides our actions, and shows us what we ought
either to fly or follow. She it is that guides the helm, and directs their
course that sail amidst the shoales and rocks of this life: without her no
man is assured. Daily and hourly there fall out innumerable things which
require counsel, which no man may receive from any other but her self. But some
one may say, whereto serves Philosophy, if there be a destiny or a God that
rules all things, or a fortune that commands over all men? For such things
as are certain cannot be changed, and against those that are uncertain what
provision may be made, if God has preoccupated all the deliberations of men? If
already he has determined that which ought to be done? or if fortune
permits nothing unto my counsel? whatsoever be of all this, or if all this
were so, we must, my Lucilius, intend Philosophy, whether that destiny
detain us captives to her irreuocable laws, or God the governor of the world,
disposes of all things; or fortune confusedly enforces, or alters humane
affairs, Philosophy must be our retreat. She will exhort us to obey God
willingly, and to resist fortune constantly: she will teach us to follow God,
and to bear with casualties. But we ar^ not now to call in question, whether
we have any interest, and whether providence be in our will or power, or
whether fate with inevitable bonds draws us to his subjection, or any sudden
or casual power be our absolute mistress. I return to exhort thee not to
suffer thy self to wax cold, or permit this heat and constancy of thy
mind to be weakened. Entertain the same in such sort, that the viuacitie and
agilitie that at this present is contained therein may grow into a habitude.
From thy very infancy (if I have known thee well) thou have fixed thine eye
on that which this present letter imports. Peruse it well, and thou shall
find it, thou need not marvel at me. I continue still to be liberal of
other men's goods; yet are they not others, because that all that which is well
said, by whomsoever it be spoken, I may term mine own. Epicurus says, If
thou live according to nature, thou shall never be poor; if according to
opinion, thou shall never be rich: nature has need but of a little, opinion
of infinite. Be it thou were Lord of all that wealth which many mighty men do
possess, or that fortune enricheth thee beyond the measure of a private man:
although she cover thee with gold, and cloth thee in purple, and bring thee
to that height of delights and riches, that thou may cover the earth with
marble, and might not only possess riches, but tread on them: add
hereunto moreover pictures and statues, and what else soever any art or engine
has invented; thou shall learn from those to covet always more. Our natural
desires are limited; those that are derived from false opinion have no end: for
there is no limit from a false ground; to him that goes in the right way,
there is an end; error is infinite. Retire thy self therefore from vain
things, and when thou would know, whether that thou ask have a natural
or blind desire, consider whether it may rest any where: if the nearer thou
approachest it, the farther daily it flies from thee, be assured it is not
according to nature.

EPIST. XVII.
That Philosphie is not to be deferred, but, all other things laid aside, to
be embraced. But I shall be poor. What if this were to be wished for? Thou
shall play the Philosopher more freely. Nature desires but a little, and that
shall not be wanting. A clause. To him that accounts poverty grievous,
riches will be likewise burdensome, for the defect is in the mind.

CAst away all these things if thou be wise, or rather to the end thou
may be wise: then address thy self speedily and with all thy power to get
a good mind. If any thing detain thee, either unbind thee also out of the
bond or break it. I am (thou will say) hindered by my home^affaires: I will
take such a course that my revenue may maintain me, without doing any thing; to
the end that poverty may not be a hinderance to me, nor I to any other. Whilst
thou say this, thou seem not to know the power and strength of that thing
whereof thou think. Thou see generally and in sum, how much Philosophy
is profitable to thee; but thou do not subtly examine all her parts,
neither know thou yet how much she helps us, and in what sort she may
succor us in great affairs (that I may use Tullies words) and in what sort
she assisteth us in great things, and applies her self to the less things.
Believe me, take advice of her, she will counsel thee not to busy thy self
about thine accounts. All then that thou searchest is to exempt thy self from
poverty; and what will thou say if it be desirable? Riches have hindered many
men from studying Philosophy: poverty is always free, is always safe, When
the enemies trumpet sounds, the poor man knows well that the al^rum
threatens not him^ in a surprise or yielding up of a town for lost, he takes
no care how to get away, or what to carry with him: if he must needs make a
voyage by Sea, no man attends him at his entrance nor at his launching forth:
he has not so great a troop of servants to attend him, that he must needs
nourish them upon the fertility of a foreign country. For it is easy to
fill a few bellies, and well taught, that desire but to be filled: it costeth
little to appease hunger; but a dainty mouth too much. Poverty is contented
with the satisfaction and supply of her necessity: why then will thou refuse
to make her thy companion, whose manners the richest themselves do imitate? If
thou desire to en^oy the freedom of thy mind, either it behooves thee to
be poor, or like a poor man. A man cannot profit in this study without the
care of frugalitie, which is a voluntary poverty. Lay then apart all these
excuses; Say not that thou have not as yet all that which thou have need of,
and that if thou might compass that sum, thou would retire thy self
from the world, to consecrate thy self wholly unto Philosophy. But
contrariwise, she it is that ought especially to be sough^ after, which thou
deferrest and seek to attain last of all. By her it is by whom thou
ought to begin. I will, say thou, recover whereupon to live: learn then
afterward how thou ought to get; if any thing hinder thee from living well,
nothing hinders thee from dying well. There is no reason that poverty should
recall us from Philosophy, no not necessity it self. We ought in her behalf
endure hunger, which diverse men have voluntarily endured in sieges. As if the
only price of this patience was not to yield it self to the discretion of
the conqueror: how much more great is that by which a perpetual liberty is
promised, and an assurance neither to be affrighted by God nor man? Sometimes
hunger enforces us to this. Whole armies have su^fered extreme necessity,
yea, so great as to feed upon the roots of herbs, and to support an
horrible famine; and all this suffered they (to make the wonder the more) to
get a Kingdom, and that which is more strange, for another man's service: who
then will doubt to endure poverty, and so free the mind from madness? There
needs not any preparation for maintenance before hand. A man may attain unto
Philosophy without provision and supplies. But touching thy self, thou will
attain thereunto after all other things, thou esteemest it for the last
instrument of life, or to speak more aptly, the accession. Contrariwise
whether it be that thou have any thing, apply thy self unto her (for whence
may thou know whether already thou have so much?) or be it thou have
nothing at all, seek after her the rather, and more then any other thing.
Fear not, the want of any necessary supplies; nature is contented with a
little, to which let a wiseman accommodate himself: and if happily extreme
necessity do surcharge him, he shall escape from this life, and shall cease
to be troublesome to himself. And if he have wherewith to wear out and
prolong the same, he will take it in good part, and will no further endeavor
himself, but for those things that are necessary: he will bestow that on his
belly and his back which appertains unto them and being content with
himself, shall laugh at the occupations of the rich, and the goings and
comings of those who sweat to get riches, and shall say, To what end searchest
thou the longer way? Wherefore expectest thou the gain of thy usury or the
succession of some old man, or the profit of merchandise, if thou can become
rich suddenly. It concerns thee no more but to recover wisdom, she will pay
thee before hand, and gives riches to whomsoever she makes them seem to be
superfluous. But this were good payment for another man; for thine own part
thou art rich, discharge thy self therefore, for thou have too much. In every
age shall thou find that which is sufficient. I might in this place end my
Letter, if I had not taught thee an evil custom. A man may not salute the
Kings of Parthia without a present: but to thee a man may not bid adieu gratis.
I will therefore borrow of Epicurus to pay thee^ To many the obtaining of
riches has not been the end, but the change of their misery. Hereat wonder I
not; for vice is not in the things themselves, but in the mind. The same
occasion made riches tedious, that made poverty grievous. Even as it is all
one to put a sick man into a bed of wood, or into a bed of gold, because
that into what place soever he be removed, he bears always his grief with
him. In like manner, there is no difference to thrust a sick mind into riches
or into poverty, because his evil always follows him.

EPIST. XVIII.
That a wiseman temperately ^ehaueth himself in public ryots, and is
tainted little or nothing with their manners. Howsoever, that it is profitable
some days to abstain, spare and resemble the poor, it is a sore exercise to
try poverty if it come so. A clause from EPICVRVS: wrath assisteth madness.

DEcember is a month wherein all the City is much busied; every one in
public gives way to lasciviousness, each ear is filled with the rumor and
report of those preparations which are made to riot with, as if the time were
extraordinary, and that there were some difference betwixt the Saturnals and
other delights. So little di^ference is there, that in my opinion he seems
to have no way erred, that saith^ that in times past December was a month, but
that now it is a year. If I had thee here, I would willingly inquire of thee,
what in thine opinion ought to be done, whether we should change any thing of
our ordinary custom, or if (lest we should seem to distaste the common
fashion) we should fall to, and frame our selves to do that which other men
do: for that which was not wont to be done but in times of tumult, and in the
turbulent estate of the City, for pleasure and the holy days sake we changed
our garment. If I knew thee well, the matter being committed to thy judgment;
neither would thou permit that in all things we should resemble the
round-cap multitude; neither also in every sort to be unlike unto them, except
happily in these days especially, we ought to command our minds to retire
themselves, and to abstain from pleasures, wherein all the world is so
disordered: she receives a most certain proof of her firmitie, if she
neither yield nor su^fer her self to be transported by adulations, and such
things as inuit her to superfluity. But it is a matter far more difficult,
and worthy a noble mind, to be sober alone: at such time as all the people
surfeiteth in drunkenness, this has more temperance and discretion in it
self, not to sequester a man's self wholly from popularitie, neither to
particularize himself ouer-much^ neither intermix himself with them, but to
do the same things that they do, but not after the same manner. For a man may
celebrate a festival day without drunkenness. But so am I pleased to tempt
the constancy of thy mind, that according to the counsels of many great
men, I advise thee to choose out certain days, wherein thou maye^t content
thy self with the least, and cheapest diet, and may cloth thy self in a
hard and course garment: say to thy self, Is this that which the world so much
feared? In the fullness of thy security let thy mind prepare it self unto
adversities, and against fortunes injuries confirm it self even in the height
of her favors. In the midst of peace the Soldier exercises him self in
arms and skirmishes, and wearieth himself with superfluous labor, to the end
he be more able and exercised when time requires. If thou desire a man
should not ^eare upon any occurrence, exercise him before hand to the accident.
They that every month exercise themselves in imitation of poverty, have
profited ^o ^arre as not to fear poverty it self, which they so oftentimes
had both ent^^^ained and apprehended. Think not now that I command thee to go
somtime^ and take an ill supper with a poor man, contenting thy self with his
bre^d an^ I win^, or whatsoever else it is, whereby luxury smootheth over, and
playe^ with the tediousness of riches. I advise thee that both thy bed and
thy apparel be truly poor, and that thy bread be stale and mouldie^ and
that thou entertain this ^ard pittance for three or four days; yea,
sometimes more, to the end it may be unto thee, not as a pastime but as a
proof. Then belee^e ^e, my Lucilius, thou shall leap for joy, when being
satisfied with a little, thou ^ha^t understand that to satisfy our selves we
have no need of fortune, for that which suffices necessity she owes us in
spite of her displeasure, yet have thou no reason in accomplishing all this, to
persuade thy self that thou have done much: for what do thou that many
thousand slaves and beggars do not daily? All the honor thou can give thy
self, is, that thou do it voluntarily^ It shall be as easy for thee to
endure it always, as to attempt it sometimes. Let us therefore prepare our
selves to all casualties, lest fortune surprise us unprovided. Let us make
poverty familiar unto us: we shall be more assuredly rich, if we know that it
is no grievous matter to be poor. That Master of pleasure Epicurus had
certain days wherein he very sparingly and niggardly repressed h^s hunger, to
prove if any thing were wanting of his full and consummate pleasure, o^ how
much wanted, or whether it were a thing of that desert, that a man should
employ much labor in repayring the same. Himself says this in his Epistles,
which he wrote to Poliaenus Charinus, being magistrate, and he glories
therein, that all his victuals for one day cost him not three pence halfepenie,
and that Metrod^rus diet, who had not so far forth profited as himself, cost
him no more. Think thou that in this kind of life there is not a saciety?
Undoubtedly there is pleasure in it, and not such pleasure which is fomie and
fleeting, and oft^ntimes to be repaired, but stable and certain: for neither
is water, nor broth, nor a morsel of barley bread a pleasant diet; but it is
an especial pleasure for a man to be able to take his contentment in these,
and to have established himself so far in himself, that no injury of
fortune can shake his resolution. The ordinary allowance of the prisons is
far more then this, and they that are condemned to die, are not so poorly
entreated by him that is their executioner. How great is the magnitude of his
mind, that makes that habitude voluntary in himself, to admit those things
with willingness which ordinarily are accustomed to be enjoined for a
penalty: this is to preoccupate the weapons of fortune. Begin therefore, my
Lucilius, to follow these men's customs, and take some days to thy self,
wherein thou may retire thy self from thine affairs, and content thy self
with a little. Begin to have some converse and familiarity with poverty. Be
^olde my guest, and set proud wealth at naught,
And make thee worthy God by modest thought.
No other man is worthy God, but he that has contemned riches, of whose
possession I debar thee not; but my desire is, that thou might possess
them without fear, which by one means thou shall obtain, if thou can
persuade thy self that thou may live happily without them, and regard them
no otherwise then as fleeting benefits, thou can well want. But now let us
begin to conclude our Epistle: first, say thou, Pay me that thou owe. I
will send Epicurus to pay thee my debt: Immoderate wrath engenders madness.
How true this is thou must needs know, when thou have had both a slave and an
enemy. This affection kindles it self against al men, it arises as well from
love as from hate, as well amongst serious things as plays and pastimes;
neither skilleth it from how great a cause it grow, but what kind of mind it
meets with: so, it is no matter how great the fire be, but where it falls;
for the greatest and soundest tymbers have sustained a great fire: again, dry
trees and such as are apt to be ^ired, nourish a sparkle so long till it break
into a flame. So is it, my Lucilius, ^urie is the end of immoderate wrath, and
therefore is anger to be avoided, not for moderation, but for healths sake.

EPIST. XIX.
That public affairs are to be omitted and cast off, and priuacie to be
affected: but pri^acie and not solitude, and detestation of conversation. He
counsels to for^ake the Court and the pomp thereof, both which are attended
with tumults and troubles. A clause of the same Masters. See with whom thou
communicatest at the table.

I Am heartily glad as oftentimes as I receive thy letters, for they fill me
with much good hope: for now they promise not, but assure me in thy behalf.
Do therefore in such sort, I pray and beseech thee, as thy letters do import:
for what better thing can I entreat at my friends hand, then that for which I
should implore God in his behalf? Withdraw thy self, if thou mayest^ from
these busy affairs; or if thou can not forcibly deliver thy self, we have
ouer-long been prodigal of time, let us begin now in our age to play the good
husbands. Is this distasteful to thee? We have lived in the stormy Ocean, let
us die in a quiet harbor. Yet would I not advise thee to affect a singularity
and name by thy retirement, which neither thou ought to boast of or to
conceal. For never will I so much condemn the ^urie of mankind, that to the
end thou may a^oyde the same, I would have thee lock thy self up in an
hermitage, and bury the affairs of this world in everlasting forgetfulness.
Behave thy self in such sort, that r^treat of thine be apparent but not
eminent; and then shall they who have liberty to live according to their own
good liking, perceive whether they ought wholly to hide themselves or no. For
thine own part thou may not. The vigor of thy wit, the elegancy of thy
writings, thy many great and famous alliances have brought thee forth into the
face of the world. Thou art already so far engaged in the knowledge of men,
that though ^hou were confined in the furthermost corner of the world, yet
would thy former actions discover themselves. Thou can not be concealed,
there will be always some lus^re of thy former light, which will attend thee,
whithersoeuer thou retirest thy self. Can thou settle thy self in repose
without the hate of any man, without desire or agon^e of mind? For what shall
thou leave which thou may imagine to have forsaken unwillingly? What thy
clients? But of th^se no one affects thee, but gapeth for somewhat from thee^
Shall it be thy friends? In times past men affected friendships now hunt they
after profits^ Art thou afraid that the older sort, being abandoned by thee,
should change their wills? Consider in counterpoize of all this that a thing
so precious as is liberty, cannot be purchased but very deerly. Finally,
bethink thy self, whether thou had rather lose either those things that
belong unto thee, or thy self. Would to God thou had been so happy as to
wax old aft^r the manner of thine a^ncestors; and fortune had not made thee
so eminent as she has done; a sudden felicity, thy province and procreation,
and whatsoever is promised by these have transported thee very far from the
sight of a contented life. And greater things besides these shall sease thee
hereafter, and the one shall b^g^t the other. What shall be the end? Think
thou thy contents and honors shall be so affluent, that nothing shall remain
for thee to desire? That time shall never happen. That which we say to be the
order and uniting of causes which tie destiny, the same likewise say we to be
of coueteousnes; the one takes his beginning from the end of the other. Into
that life art thou demised which shall neither and thy misery nor servitude.
Pull thy neeke therefore out from the yoake^ it is better to cut it in pieces
all at once, then to suffer it perp^tually to be restrained. If thou withdraw
thy self to a private life, all things will be lesser, but they will fill thee
the more; but now diverse things, and heaped one upon another, satisfy thee
not. But whether had thou rather to hau^ ^^curitie in want, or hunger in
abundance? Felicity is both covetous, and expos^d to others greediness. As
long as nothing shall suffi^e thee, thou shall not give contentment to others,
How say thou, shall I escap^ this? By any means whatsoever. Bethink thy
self, how many things thou have rashly attempted for mon^y, how many things
thou have laboriously undertaken for honor^ something also is to be attempted
for thy quiet sake, or in this solicitude of pro^iniation^ and afterward of
civil offices, thou must wax^ old in travel, and be always tossed with new
wa^es, which thou can not avoid by any modesti^ o^ quiet of life. For what
a^ayleth thee to be willing to settle thy quiet, if thy fortune will not? What
also if thou permit the same to increase? the better the success is, the (...)
^he fear increases. I will recount unto thee in this place the saying of
M^^^nas^ who spoke truth amidst the tortures of his dignity, and ^auours in
the Court of AV^VSTVS: For Highness it self thundereth at the highes^. If you
enquire of me in what book he said it: it was in that which was entitled
Prometheus. ^his would he say that fear and amaze possesses the highest. Is
there therefore a^^nie power of that esteem that thy speech should be so
disordred? The man was ingenious, and such as was to give a great example of
Roman eloquence, if felicity had not enfeebled him, nay rather geld^d him.
This and attends if thou restrain not thy self presently, and shorten thy
say^es^ except (which he to lately affected) thou bear for the land. I could
be quit with thee for this sentence of Mecaenas, but I fear me thou will not
recoin^^ it for good payment in this sort, but wilt cavil (if I know thee
well) and ac^^pt of my paym^nt in the coin I hold current. Howsoever the
matter be I will borrow from E^^^CVRVS: Thou art (says he) to take care with
whom thou e^te^^ and drinkest before thy meat, then what thou eatest and
drinkest: for a plentiful and fleshie feast without a friend, is the life of a
Lion or a Wolf. This shall not happen to thee, except thou retire thy self,
and separate thee from the multitude; otherwise thou shall have at thy table,
not thy friends, but such as thy remembrancer has chosen amongst the multitude
of thy saluters. But he deceives himself that searches a friend in the base
court, and approves him in the banquet. A man much occupied and besieged by
his goods, has no one greater mischief, then that he thinks them to be his
friends whom he loves not, that believes that his benefits are powerful
enough to get him friends, whereas some the more they owe a man, the more they
hate him. A little debt makes a man a debtor, a great an enemy? What
therefore, do not benefits beget friendships? They do, if a man might make
choice of those that should receive them, if they were well employed, and not
rashly cast away. Therefore whilst thou beginnest to be thine own man, in the
mean while use this counsel of the wisemen, that thou think it to be more
pertinent to the matter, to regard who receives then what.

EPIST. XX.
That Philosophy is in deeds not in words, and that therefore we ought to
address our selves to them, and that constantly. For wisdom is the
conueniency and uniform tenor of our wills and life. Poverty also is not to be
feared, and riches if they be present not to be loved. Moreover, a warning that
on certain days we act and imitate poor men.

IF thou art in health, and think thy self worthy at some time to be made
thine own I rejoice: for it shall be my glory, if I may draw thee out from
thence, whereas thou floatest without hope of getting out. But this I heartily
beg and earnestly exhort thee too, my Lucilius, that thou shut up Philosophy
in the secret of thy heart, and that thou make an experiment of thy progress,
not by thy speech or writings, but by the firmitie of thy mind, and the
diminution of thy desires. Approve the words by the deeds. One is the scope of
those that declaime and demand applause of an assembly. Another of those that
detain the cares of young and idle men with diverse and voluble disputation.
Philosophy teaches us to do and not to speak, and exacteth this of us, that
every one live according to her law, lest the life should differ from speech,
that the life be in it self of one color, without any discord of actions.
This is both the greatest office, and token of wisdom, that the actions be
correspondent to the words, and that he which follows her be always equal
and like unto himself. Who shall perform this? Few, yet some shall. This thing
is difficult, neither say I that a wiseman should always march one pace, but
one path. Observe therefore whether thy garment and thy house do disagree,
whether thou art liberal toward thy self, and niggardly toward thine,
whether thou suppest frugally and buildest prodigally? Take once unto thee a
certain rule and measure of life, and level the same according to that
square. Some men in their houses restrain themselves, abroad are lavish and
prodigal. This diversity is a vice, and the sign of an unconstant mind, and
not as yet brought in frame. Moreover I will tell thee whence this inconstancy
of affairs and counsels does proceed. No man proposes unto himself an end
whereunto he will tend, neither if he have proposed it, does he persevere in the
same, but ouer-shooteth himself; and not only changes he, but return^th and
re-intangleth himself in those vices, which he himself had forsaken and
condemned. That I may therefore leave the old definitions of wisdom, and
comprehend the whole manner of humane life, I can be content with this. What is
wisdom? To will one thing, and to nill the same: although thou add not the
exception, that it be just which thou willest. One and the same thing cannot
always please any man, except it be right. Men therefore know not what they
will except in that very moment wherein they will. In sum, no man is positive
in his willing or nilling. The judgment is daily varied, and turned into the
contrary, and to many men life passes away like a May Game. Pursue then that
which thou have begun, and thou shall happily attain either to the height, or
at leastwise to that thou alone shall understand that as yet it is not
complete. What shall become, say thou, of this troop of my familiars? All
this troop when thou desistest to feed them will feed themselves, or that
which thou can not know by thy merits, thou shall understand by the means
of poverty. She will retain thy true and certain friends, and whosoever shall
leave, followed not thee but another thing. And is not poverty to be loved for
this one thing, that she discloseth unto thee who are thy unfeigned friends? O
when will that day come that no man will belie thine honor? Let therefore all
thy thoughts tend hither, study and wish this, remitting all other vows unto
God, that thou may be content with thy self and such goods that accrue by
thy self. What felicity may be nearer unto God? Reduce thy self, and content
thee with the least estate, lower then which thou can not fall: and that thou
may the more willingly do it, to this shall belong the tribute of this
Epistle. Although thou envy it, yet shall Epicurus even at this present
voluntarily defray the duty for me. Believe me, this thy discourse shall
have more luster and magnificence in a low bed, and under a ragged coat;
for it shall not only be said but approved. And for mine own part have I
during my life time otherwise heard that which my friend Demetrius said, when
as I saw him naked, couched and lying upon less then straw? For then is he not
a Master of truth, but a witness. What then, ought we to set light by the
riches which are in our possession, and as it were in our bosom? Why may we
not? Great is his courage, which having long time and much admired them about
him, laugheth at them, and rather hears then feel^th that they are his. It is
much, not to be corrupted by the fellowship of riches. Great is he that is
poor in his riches, but more secure is he that wants riches. I know not,
say thou, how this man will bear his poverty, if he fall into the same;
neither know I, says Epicurus, if this poor man will contemn his riches if he
fall on them. Therefore in both of them the mind is to be esteemed and looked
into; whether the one affected his poverty, the other flattered not his
riches. Otherwise the ^trawe bed, and ragged coat would be but a slender
argument of good will, except it were manifest, that any one suffered them not
of necessity but voluntarily. But it is the sign of a great wit, not to run
after the things as if they were the better, but to prepare himself to endure
them with facility. And truly, Lucilius, they are easier: but when as with
mature consideration thou shall entertain them, they will be pleasant also:
for in them there is a security, without which nothing is pleasant. I
therefore judge that necessary, which as I wrote unto thee, great men have
often done, to interpose certain days, wherein by imaginary poverty we may
exercise our selves to entertain the true; which is the rather to be done
because we have been drowned in delights, and all things in our judgments are
hard and difficult: rather ought the mind to be awakened and roused from
sleep, and to be instructed and admonished, that nature has proposed us the
least. No man is borne rich: whosoever enters life, is commanded to be
contented with bread and milk. From these beginnings Kingdoms contain us not.

EPIST. XXI.
That true splendour is in Philosophy, and proceeds not from honors or
titles. That she gives to those that have her, and clea^e unto her, a
perpetual name and fame. An emblem from EPICVRVS. To the intent thou may
increase thy riches diminish thy desires.

Think thou that thou have to do with those thoughts whereof thou had
writ to me? Thou have a mighty business with thy self, and art troublesome
to thy self. Thou know not what thou would: thou do better allow then
follow honest things. Thou see where felicity is planted, but thou dare
not attain thereunto. But what it is that hinders thee, because thou thy
self do little conceive or pry into, I will tell thee. Thou think these
things great matters which thou art to leave, and when as thou have proposed to
thy self that security whereunto thou art to pass the light of this life from
whence thou art to part, retains thee as if thou were to fall into some
loathsome and dark places. Thou abusest thy self Lucilius, we ascend from
this life to the other. The difference which is between splendour and light,
whereas this has a certain original and from it self, that shines by
reason of another: the same difference is there twixt this life and that. This
because it is reflected upon by an external light will presently yield a
thick shadow to whomsoever sets himself before the same; but that other
shines by his own light. Thy studies will make thee famous and noble. I will
relate an example of Epicurus when he wrote to Idomenaeus, and revoked him from
a pompeous life to a faithful and stable glory, who was a minister at that
time of rigorous and regal power and had the handling of many mighty matters.
If (says he) thou art touched with glory, my Epistles shall make thee more
famous then all those things which thou honor, and for which thou art
honored. Whether, I pray you, lied he? Who had known Idomenaeus except
Epicurus had registered and engraued him in his Letters? All those Potentates,
Princes, and the King himself, from whom Idomenaeus had his estate and
dignity, are buried in eternal oblivion. Ciceroes Epistles suffer not the
name of Atticus to be extinguished, neither had Agrippa his son in law, nor
Tiberius his neeces husband, nor Drusus Caesar his nephews son, amongst so
great names he had been obscured, had not Cicero maintained his reputation,
and kept him in memory. After us there shall come a long and hidden tract of
time, some few wits shall lift up their heads, and being likely at length to
sleep in the same silence, shall resist oblivion, and shall keep themselves
long time in reputation. That which Epicurus could promise his friend, that
promise I thee, Lucilius. I shall have favor with posterity, and can bear
away with me the names of such as shall live in memory. One Virgil promised
and performed to two eternal memory: You both are fortunate if ought my
verses can,
No day shall you exempt from memory of man;
Whilst haught AENEAS house shall stand, and lasting bide
Upon the Capitols rocky and lofty side,
And Roman father shall the Roman Empire guide.
All those whom fortune has advanced, al they that have bin the members and
parcels of another man's power, their credit has been inhaunced, their houses
have been frequented during the time that they themselves flourished, after
them their memory was quickly extinguished. The reputation of wits increases
daily, and not only continues for them, but all that is received, which is
adherent unto them. And to the end that Idomenaeus be not gratis enclosed in my
Epistle, he shall redeem the same at his own charge. To him Epicurus wrote
this noble sentence, wherein he exhorts him to make Pithocles rich after no
vulgar or uncertain manner: If thou will (says he) make PITHOCLES rich, thou
must not amplify his possessions, but diminish his desires. This sentence is
so plain that it needs no interpretation, and so express as it needs no
help. I admonish thee this one thing, that thou suppose not this only to be
spoken of riches, howsoever thou apply^st it, it is all one. If thou will make
Pithocles honest thou must not amplify his honors, but diminish his desires.
If thou will that Pithocles be in perpetual pleasure, thou must not amplify
his pleasures but diminish his desires. If thou will make Pithocles old, and
cause him to live a complete life, thou must not amplify his years, but
diminish his desires. Thou have no reason to judge that these are only
Epicurus speeches, for they are publik. That which was wont to be don in the
Senate, that also think I fit to be don in Philosophy. When any one has
delivered his mind, which partly pleases me, I bid him divide his sentence,
and I follow the same so divided. The more willingly recite I these good
sayings of Epicurus, to the end I may show those who build thereupon, being
conducted with a foolish presumption, and that think to have a cloak for
their vices, that they ought to live honestly in what place soever they bide.
When they shall approach these Gardens, and shall see written over the gate of
them, Here well may thou abide my gentle guest,
Here pleasure is esteemed the chiefest best.
The Host of this house courteous unto his guests, full of hospitality and
humanity, will be addressed, and shall entertain thee with a cake, and present
thee with water, as much as will suffice thee, and in the end. ^ll say unto
thee: Have thou not been well entertained? These Gardens, I tell thee, provoke
not but extinguish hunger: neither make they thee thrise-more great by the
drinkings; but assuage them by a natural and gratuitall remedy. In this
pleasure am I waxen old, I speak with thee of these desires which receive no
consolation, to which it is good to release some things, to the end they may
cease. For in regard of the extraordinary which a man may defer, chastise
and oppress, I will advertise thee of one thing, that this is neither a
natural nor necessary voluptuousness. To this thou art in no manner tied,
whatsoever thou bestowest on it, it is voluntary. The belly hears no
precepts, it demands and calls on us; yet is he not a troublesome creditor,
but satisfied with little, provided thou give him that which thou owe, not
that which thou payest.

EPIST. XXII.
We ought manfully to dislodge our selves of businesses, and how the snares are
either to be loosed or broken; yet let opportunity and good occasion be
respected, and not let slip. Furthermore he despises and casts from him
these false splendors. Then cites he a sentence of EPICVRVS. That all men part
out of this life children, that is ignorant o^ the true life.

THou understand now that thou art to acquit thy self of these businesses,
in appearance fair, but evil: but how thou may effect the same, thou
ask my counsel. Many things cannot be taught but in presence. A Physician
cannot choose by his Letters the time of repast and bathing, he must feel the
pulse. It is an old proverb; That the Fencer takes counsel in the field
appointed for combat. The countenance of his adversary makes him think on
somewhat, the motion of his hand, and the inclination of his body advises
somewhat to him that beeholdeth or looks on. A man may in general give
advice either by speech, or writing of that which has been accustomed, or of
that which is needful to be done; and such counsel both to the absent and to
posterity, but that other when it ought to be done, and how, no man will
advise from a far o^f: we must deliberate with the things themselves. It is
the duty of a good man that is not only present but well advised, to take
the occasion when it comes; and therefore be intentive after her, take her by
the forlocke when thou see her, and with all the force of thy mind, and to
the uttermost of thy power labor to disburden thee of all these charges, which
thou have taken on thee. Above all things observe what my counsel is; my
opinion is, that either thou must dismiss this kind of life, or lose thy
life. But I think this also that thou must keep some moderate course, to the
end that what thou have entangled lewdly, thou may rather loose then break
off. And when there should be no other means to discharge thy self, that thou
might boldly break the same. There is no man so faint hearted, that had
rather abide always hanging in the air, then to fall once. Mean while beware
thou principally, that thou engage not thy self ouer-farre, content thy self
with those affairs thou have undertaken, or (since thou will that we believe
so) that have surprised thee. Thou must not entang^e thy self further;
otherwise thou will loose thy excuse, and wilt make it known, that they have
not surprised thee. For these excuses which are wont to be made, are false. I
could not do otherwise; and what if I will not? I was forced to do it. There
is no man that is constrained to follow felicity headlong. It is much if a
man cannot repulse her, at leastwise to make head against her, and to resist^
he swiftness of fortune. Art thou displeased if I come not only to give thee
counsel, but if I call others also to thy assistance? Truly they are more
wise th^n I am, it is of them that I take advice, if I have any thing to
deliberate. I have read an Epistle of Epicurus, that tends to this purpose,
which is written to Idomenaeus, whom he entreats that as much as in him
lies, he ^lie and hasten before any greater force intercept, and cut off his
liberty from retiring: yet adds the same man, that nothing is to be attempted
except when it may be aptly and lively executed. But when the time that a man
has so long expected shall come, he says that we ought to dislodge suddenly.
He forbids him sleep that supposes to fly; he hops also an happy
issue of those things that are most difficult, if we hasten not our selves
before the time, and if we be not negligent when it shall be time to hasten.
But I think thou demaundest the advice of the Stoics; there is no man ought
to accuse them toward thee of temeritie, they are more wary then strong.
Happily thou expectest that these things be spoken to thee. It is a shame to
faint under the burden; thou ought to wrestle against the charge thou have
undertaken. A man that flies travel, is neither valiant nor hardy; he is the
man whose courage redoubleth, the more difficult his affairs grow. All this
shall be said unto thee, if perseverance ought to bring any profit, if it be
necessary if nothing ought to be done or suffered that is unworthy a good
man; otherwise he will not tire himself after a shameful and dishonest
travail, and would not meddle with affairs, lest he should reap pain
thereby, much less would he do that which thou think he would do, that
finding himself entangled in affairs, full of ambition he would always
support that passion: but after that he shall know the dangers wherein he is
plunged, to be full of incertaintie and doubts, he will withdraw his foot, yet
not turn his back, but by little and little will retire in safety. Truly it
is an easy thing, my Lucilius, to escape from business, if thou contemn the
profit of them: they are those that retain and stay us. What shall I do then?
shall I leave so long hopes? Shall I then desist when I am to receive the
profit? Shall I not have any man to attend me, and give me? Shall my litter be
vnattended? and my base Court without suitors? With much hearts-griefe and
unwillingness do men depart from these hopes; they love the profit that
proceeds from these miseries, yet hate they the miseries themselves. So
complain they of their ambitions as of their miseries: and if thou consider
well their true affection, they hate them not, but they are angry with them.
Shake off those men which deplore that which they have desired, and speak of
the forsaking of those things which they cannot want, thou shall see that they
incessantly keep company with that which they report incessantly be most
distastefull and disliking to them. True it is, my Lucilius, that servitude
retains few persons, and few persons retain servitude: but if thou art
resolved in thy mind to dismiss the same, and that in good earnest liberty
best pleases thee; and that to this one intent thou demandest counsel, that
without perpetual felicity thou may have power to do the same. Why should
not the whole company of Stoics allow thereof? All Zenoes Chrysippi will
persuade moderate, honest, and true things. But if for this cause thou
recoilest, that thou may look about thee, how much thou shall carry with
thee, and what great riches thou need to live in repose, thou shall never
find an issue: a man laden with a burden cannot save himself by swimming.
Depart from that to enter with the favor of the gods into a better life,
provided that this favor be not like unto theirs, to whom they have given
evils with a smiling and gracious countenance, excused by this one thing, that
the goods which burn and torment, were given to those that wished for them, I
had already sealed up my letter, but I must open it again, that I may send it
to thee with a solemn present, and bring with it some magnificall sentence;
and behold I know not whether one more true or more eloquent is fallen in my
hand. Whose is it, say thou? Epicurus: for as yet do I fill my packet with
other men's purposes. No man departs otherwise out of this life, but as if he
did but newly enter. Surprise what man thou will, young, of middle age or old;
thou shall find them alike afraid of death, and all of them as ignorant of
life. No man has finished any thing: for we always refer our affairs to the
time to come. There is nothing in this sentence that pleases me so much, then
when it reproacheth old men, that as yet they are infants. No man, says he,
does otherwise depart out of this life, then as he was borne. It is false, we
die worse then we were borne: it is our error and not natures; she must
complain of us, and say, what means this, I have bred you without desires,
without fears, without superstition, without persidiousnesse, and other
plagues, depart out of life such as you entered? That man is seasoned in
wisdom, who dies as securely as he is borne. But now fear we, when danger
approaches our heart, our color fails us, and fruitless tears fall from
our eyes. What is more absurd then to be fearful even in the very entrance of
security? But the cause hereof is this; because we are void of all goodness,
whereas in the end of our life we labor with the desire of them: for no part
thereof remains with us, it is lost, it is vanished, no man cares how well
he lives, but how long, whereas all men might have the hap to live well, as no
men have to live long.

EPIST. XXIII.
He warns to seek out true joy: what is that? That which is severe and bred
of true goodness. ^he rest are ^allacious and ^ugitiue, this solid and firm,
because it is seated in a resolute mind, which is the best part of us: in a
word, it is seated in conscience. At list EPICVRVS his saying. It is a
loathsome and troublesome thing always to begin to live, and such as are
inconstant are condemned.

THou supposest that I will write unto thee how kindly the winter has dealt
with us, which was both remiss and short; how unkindly the spring was, and
preposterous the cold, and such other toys as delight those that love words.
But I will write something which may profit both thee and me. And what else
shall that be but to exhort thee to a good mind? Ask thou me what the
foundation thereof is? Do not joy in vain things. Said I that this is the
foundation, it is the perfection and fullness thereof. He obtains the
fullness of this good, who knows wh^rein his pleasure lies, and has not
builded his felicity on another man's power: he is altogether in care, and ill
assured, who is tickled with any hope, although he holds it in his hand,
although he easily obtain the same, although the things he hoped for have
never deceived him. Do this above all things, my Lucilius, learn to rejoice.
Thou think now that I take many of thy pleasures from thee, who drive from
thee those that are gotten by casualtie, who suppose that these hopes and
sweetest delights are to be avoided, nay, rather it is quite contrary. I will
not that at any time thou be without joy. I will that it be bred unto thee in
thine own house^ and it is bred, if so be that it be within thy self. All
other delights replenish not the soul, but clear the countenance: they are
toys except thou iudgest him to be merry that laugheth. The mind ought to be
resolute and confident, and lifted up above all things. Trust me, true joy is a
severe thing. Think thou that a man with a smooth and smiling countenance,
and, as these wanton fellows speak, with a merry eye, contemns death,
opens his house to poverty, bridleth his delights, and meditateth on
patience? He that thinks on all these things is in great gladness, but
little pleasing: in possession of this gladness I would have thee be, it will
never fail thee, when as thou once find out from whence it proceeds. The
best of the slightest metals is in the upper part, they are the most rich
which have their vain hidden in their center, and will make him most rich who
shall search their mine with diligence. These toys and trifles wherewith the
common sort are delighted, have a pleasure tender and facile to melt, and all
that joy which comes from without us, is without foundation. This whereof I
speak, whereunto I endeavor to draw thee, is solid and far more apparent
inwardly. Endeavor, I beseech thee, my well-beloved Lucilius, to practice that
only which may make thee happy: despise and spurn at those things that
outwardly shine, and which are promised thee from another: fix thie eye upon
the true good, and take thou pleasure in that which is thine own. But what
means this? of thy self, and the better part of thy self: think also of
thy body (although nothing may be done without it) to be a thing rather
necessary then great. It sugge^^eth vain, short and remorsfull pleasures, and
such as, if they be not well tempered with great moderation, will turn into a
contrary effect. I say this, that pleasure is still falling headlong, and
declining unto grief, except it keep a mediocritie; and hard it is to keep a
mean in that which thou ^irmely beleeuest to be good. The desire of true good
is assured. Ask thou me what this true good is, and whence it proceeds? I
will tell thee; from a good conscience, from honest deliberations, from virtuous
and justifiable actions, from contempt of such things as are casual, from a
peaceable, and continual institution of life, which has always traced the
same course. For they who leapt from some purposes to other, or else iumpe not,
but by a certain chance are transported; how can they have any thing certain
or permanent, being themselves inconstant and in suspense? Few there are that
dispose both themselves and their estates by counsel. The rest after the
manner of those sedges that floate on great rivers, go not, but are carried;
whereof some are detayned, and are softly conuayed by a slower stream,
othersom carried away by a more vehement, others a soft tide has slowly
carried to the shore, others a strong current has cast into the Sea. We must
therefore be resolved what we will, and in it must we persevere. Here is the
place to pay my debt: for I can pay thee in the words of thine own Epicurus
and discharge this Epistle: It is a tedious thing always to begin life: or if
in this manner the sense may be the better expressed; Badly live they who
always begin to live. Why say thou? for this word requires an explanation.
Because their life is always imperfect^ but it cannot be that he should be
prepared for death, that does but lately begin to live. We must so do, as if
we had lived long enough. No man has thought it that begins to live, when
he only begins in good earnest: nevertheless think thou not that these
are few in number, for almost all are such. Some do then begin to live, when
they ought to cease: if thou think this and wonder, I will add that which
shall draw thee more into admiration; some have ceased to live before they
have begun.

EPIST. XXIIII.
An Epistle worthy to be ranked amongst the best. He exhorts not to fear
evils to come, although they threaten. But rather to propose them to happen,
and so to form a man's self by examining or extenuating them. For what are all
these fears? The last of them is death, and contemn that by reason. Great men
have done it. Plebeans and Slaves have done it. Why should thou not aspire?
Take the visard from things: that which thou fear is pain; which a tender
woman has suffered in her childbed. Finally, thou art borne to this, to be
tossed, to grieve, to die: acknowledge thy destiny: yet with EPICVRVS precept,
neither wish for death, neither fear it.

THou writest unto me that thou art disquieted in mind about the event of thy
judgment, which the fury of thine enemy does denounce against thee, and thou
think that I will persuade thee; to propose unto thy self in the mean time
good success, and feed thy self with vain hopes. For what needs it us to
call on and anticipate our calamities, which will befall us too soon, and lose
the present good for fear of the evil to come? Undoubtedly it is a great
folly to make a man's self miserable for the present, because that sometimes
hereafter he must be: but I will lead thee to security by another way, if
thou will disburthen thy self of all care; make account, that whatsoever thou
fear shall befall thee, is already happened, and what evil soever it be,
measure it by thy self, and tax thy fear. Thereby shall thou judge
undoubtedly, either that thine evil is not great, or that it is not long;
neither may thou spend much time in gathering examples, to conform thee,
every age is stored with them. In whatsoever part of affairs, either civil or
external, thou fixest thy memory, thou shall meet with wits, either
proficient in wisdom, or of great towardness. Can there then, if so be thou
be condemned, a worse fortune befall thee, then to be banished, to be led to
prison? Is there any thing more to be feared by any man, then that he shall be
burned, then that he shall die? Think very nearly on every one of these
things, and represent unto thy self all those that have despised them, who are
not to be sought for, but chosen out. Rutillius so suffered his condemnation,
as if no other thing more troubled him, then for that he was wrongfully judged.
Metellus took his exile courageously, and Rutillius also willingly; the one
vouchsafeing his return for the good of the Commonweal; the other refusing
Sylla his return, to whom in those days nothing was denied. Socrates disputed
in the prison, and whereas there were some that promised him flight, he refused
to make escape; yea and he remained to the intent to take from men the fear of
two the most dreadfullest things, that is to say, Imprisonment and Death.
Mutius thrust his hand into the flame. A bitter thing it is to be burned, but
how far more intolerable, if thou suffer it by thine own act? Thou see an
unlearned man, never strengthened by my Precepts against death or grief, only
furnished with military fortitude, exacting punishment from himself, of his
frustrated attempt: he stood looking on his right hand dropping away in his
enemies fire, neither removed he his scorched hand burned to the bones, before
the fire was withdrawn from him by the enemy himself. Something might he
have performed in that camp more happily, but nothing more courageously. See
how more eager Virtue is to entertain peril, then cruelty to command it.
More easily did Porsenna pardon Mutius, for that he would have killed him, then
Mutius did himself, because he had not murdered him. These fables, thou will
say are ouerworne, and sung amiddest the Schools. Now will thou (now the cause
is handled of contempt of death) allege me Cato. And why should I not nominate
and represent him reading that last night Platoes boooke with his sword behind
his pillow? These two instruments in extremities had he provided, the one to
have will to die, the other to have power. Having then given order to his
affairs, as far as a broken and desperate estate permitted him; he thought
that only concerned him to act: that no man might either have power to kill,
or opportunity to save Cato. And having his sword drawn, which until that
time he had kept pure and neat from all murder. Thou have not O Fortune, said
he, as yet done any thing against me, in opposing thy self against all my
designs and enterprises. I have not as yet fought for mine own, but my
countries liberty, neither have I endeavored so much to live free, as to live
amongst free men. Now since the affairs of humane kind are desperate, Cato
will well find a means to set himself at liberty. After this he grievously
wounded himself in the body, which being dressed and bound up by his
Physicians. Cato that had already lost much blood, and much strength, but
nothing lost of the greatness and goodness of his mind: now not only angry
with Caesar, but incensed against himself; he forced his naked hands into his
mortal wound, and rendered or rather thrust out that generous soul of his,
that contemned all power. I heap not up together these examples for this
present, to the intent to exercise my wit, but rather to give thee courage
against a thing that seems so dreadful and terrible. And more easily shall I
exhort thee in my opinion, if I show, that not only great and generous persons
have contemned this moment of yielding up the ghost, but that some men of
little value in all other things, have in this equalled the virtue of the most
generous, as that Scipio the father in law to Cncius Pompeius, who being forced
by a contrary wind to be transported into Africa, and perceiving his ship to
be in the possession of his enemies, stabbed himself, answering those, who
demanded where the emperor was, that the Emperor was well. This vow of his
made him equal with his ancestors, and suffered not that the glory which
seems to be fatal to the Scipions in Africa, should be interrupted. It was
much to conquer Carthage, but more to conquer death. The Emperor, says he, is
well: and in what other sort should an Emperor die, namely, such a one that
commanded Cato? I will not refer thee to former Histories, nor gather
together from all ages the many contemners and despisers of death. Look only
into these very times of ours, whose negligence and daintiness we complain
of, thou shall meet with men of all estates, all fortunes, all ages, which have
cut off the course of their misfortunes by their deaths. Believe me Lucillius,
so little ought death to be feared, that nothing is to be preferred before the
benefit thereof. Hear therefore securely and confidently the threats of thine
enemy, and although thy conscience make thee confident, yet because that many
things have credit, beside the cause, hope for that which is just, and prepare
thy self against injustice. But about all things, remember thou to esteem
things simply as they be, and despoile them of the tumult and bruit that is
accustomably given them, and thou shall find in them, that there is nothing
terrible in them, but the only fear. That which thou see befall young
children, befalls us also that are greater boys; they are afraid of those
whom they love, and with whom they frequent and disport every day, if they see
them masked and disguised. Not from men only ought we to take the mask, but
from things themselves, and yield them their true and natural appearance. Why
show thou me swords and fire, and a troop of grinning hang-men about thee?
Take away this pomp, under which thou lie hidden, and wherewith thou
terrifiest fools: thou art Death, which of late my slave or my hand-maiden
has contemned. Again, why show thou me these whippes and torments, under
so mighty a preparation? Why several engines for several joints, fitted to
torture men, and a thousand other instruments to pluck a man in pieces? Lay
aside these things which astonish us, command the groans and exclamations, and
the irksomenesse of the cries extorted in the midst of the torture.
Undoubtedly it is but the pain, which this goutie man contemns, which that
man sick with the pain of the stomach, in his very daintiness endures,
which the tender woman suffers in her childing. Light it is, if I can endure
it, short it is, if I can suffer it. Toss these things in thy mind, which
thou have oftentimes heard, which thou have often said. Approve it by effect,
if thou have truly said it, or truly heard it. For it is a villainous
reproach, which is wont to be objected against us, if we handle the words of
Philosophy, but not the works. What think thou? Supposest thou that this
is the first time that death, banishment, and grief houered over thee? Thou
art borne to those. Let us think that any thing may be done, as if it were
hereafter to be done. That which I advise thee to do, I surely know thou have
done. Now do I admonish thee, that thou drown not thy mind in this
solicitude, for it will be dulled and have less force, when thou have reason
to raise and rouse it. Withdraw the same from a private cause to a public; say
that thou have a mortal and frail body, which foreign injury and tyranny
may not only hurt, but the very pleasures thems^lues may b^ transformed into
torments. The d^licacie of meats causes the cruditie of the stomach;
drunkenness, trembling and astonishment of the sinews; the pleasures of the
flesh and lusts, a general deprauation of hands and feet, and all the joints.
If I become poor, I have many fellows; if I be banished, I shall persuade my
self, that the place wherein I am confined, is the place of my birth; if I be
tied and manackled, what then, now I am free? That nature, as soon as we are
borne, imprisoneth us in this lumpish mass of the body, as in a strong
prison. If I must die, I will comfort my self in this, that I shall cease to
be any more sick; I shall cease to be bound; I shall cease to have power to
die. I am not so fond as in this place to persecute Epicurus song, or to say
that the fear of hell is vain, that Ixion is not tossed on the wheel, nor
Sysiphus tied to roll and return his stone on his shoulder; nor that any man's
bowels could be renewed and devoured daily. There is no man so childish as to
fear Cerberus, and darkness, and the shadows of ghosts walking by night.
Death either consumes us, or delivers us. A better condition exempted from
all charge, attends those who are delivered by death. To those that are
consumed, there remains nothing more, since both the good and the evil are
equally taken from them. Permit m^ in this place to put thee in memory of a
verse thou have made, and think that thou have not written it to others, but
to thy self. It is a shameful and unseemly thing to speak one thing and
think another, but how odious to write one thing and to think another? I
remember that thou deb^ting sometime on this place, did say, that we fall
not suddenly into death, but by little and little walk unto death. We die
daily, and some part of our life is daily scantled: and then also when we
increase, our life does decrease. We have lost our infancy, and then our
youth, then our man's estate; briefly, all that time which is passed until
this present day is death for us. And this very day w^ live, w^ divide with
death. Even as in an hou^e-glasse, the last part of the land that falls is
no^ the only part that discovers the hour, but all that also which is fal^e
before; so the last hour, in which we cease to be, is not the only that
causes death, but it is that consummateth it. At that time we attain thither,
but we come thereto long before. These things when thou had described
according to thy accustomed style, thou were always great, but never more
witty, then when thou fittedst thy words to truth, and saydest, Death has
degrees, that is not first that fast
Attempts to ravish us, but that is last.
I had rather thou should read thy self, then my Epistle: it will appear^
unto thee, that this death which we fear, is the last, but not the only which
we suffer. I perceive thy bent^ Thou expectest to see what thing I should
insert into this my Epistle, what bold speech of any man, what pro^itable
precept. Of this very matter which we have in hand^ I will afford thee
somewhat: Epicurus is displeased as much with those that desire death, as those
that fear it, and says thus; It is a ridiculous thing, that the hatred of
life makes us run unto death, when by ^he course of our life we have
^ccasioned no less, but that needs we must have recourse unto death. Likewise
in another place he says: What is more ridiculous th^n to wish for death, when
through the fear of death, a man has made his life no less then a torment?
Thou may also add this, which is of the same stuff: That the folly or
rather madness of men is so great, that there are diverse who are constrained
to die for fear of death. Which of these sentences thou shall keep in memory,
it will confirm thee in the sufferance either of life or death: for we have
need both to be admonished and confirmed in both of th^s^, to the end we
neither too much love, nor too much loath our life; and at that very time when
reason counsaileth us to finish the same, we ought not to do it rashly,
neither in fetching our race ought we to run upon it. A courageous and wise
man, ought to leave his life but not to sly from it: but above all things
avoid that affection wherewith many men are possessed, that is a desire to die:
for even as in all other things (my Lucilius) so also in death, there is a
disordinate and unbridled in^lination of the minde^ that oftentimes surpriseth
men of high and generous spirits, and oftentimes fearful and faint-hearted
men; the one despise life, the other loath the same. Some other there are that
are weary of living, and glutted with doing one thing always, and hate not so
much their life as they are weary of it. And thereunto Philosophy it self
leads us, whilst we say, How long the same? That is, I shall rise, I shall
sleep, I shall be full, I shall be hungry, I shall be a cold, I shall be hot^;
there is no and of any thing, but all things are shut in a circle, they fly
and follow. The day expels the night, the night secondeth the d^y; Summer
ends in Autumn, Winter succeeds it, and the Spring, Winter: all things
pass that they may return again: I see nothing new, I do nothing new. In
the end we grow in loathing of these things. There are many that acount it not
a bitter thing to live, but superfluous.

EPIST. XXV.
He prescribes of two friends a young and an old in different sort: how they
are to be dealt withal, with the one more roughly, with the other more
remisly, lest he despair. He exhorts LVCILIVS himself to mediocritie or
poverty: at length by EPICVRVS words, to take to himself a Tutor. Do all
things as if a man looked on thee.

AS concerning our two friends, we must proceed after a different manner: for
the vices of the one are to be amended, of the other to be extinguished. I will
use an entire liberty: I love not him except I shall offend him. What then
will thou say? Think thou to contain under thy discipline a pupil of
forty year old? Behold his age already hard and intractable: he cannot be
reformed, things pliable may be wrought upon. I know not whether I shall
prevail or no; I had rather the success then my endeavor should fail me.
Despair not but that a man may heal those that have been afflicted with
inueterate sickenesses; if thou resist their intemperance, and if thou compel
them to do and endure many things against their will. Neither of the other can
I have any great hope, except this, that as yet he blusheth to offend. This
shamefastness is to be nourished, which as long as it continues in the mind,
there will be some place for good hope. With this old Soldier I think we must
deal more sparingly, lest he fall into despe^ation of himself. Neither was
there any more fit time to set upon him then this, whilst he pawseth and
pretends a show of reformation. This int^rmission deceived others: for my
self it abaseth me not; I expect the return of his vic^s with great usury,
which for the present I know are at repose, but not dispossessed. I will bestow
some time upon this matter, and I will make trial whether any thing may be
done or no. Approve thy self a man unto us, as thou art accustomed, and trusse
up the baggage. Nothing of that which we have is necessary. Let us reture to
the law of nature; riches are at hand, either that we want is gratuitall or
vile. Nature desires bread and water, no man is poor to these. Upon those
things wherein a man has confined his desire, he may argue with Jupiter
himself of his felicity, as Epicurus says, some speech, of whom I will
enclose in this Epistle: So do all things (says he) as if another man looked
on. Vndoubt^dly it is very profitable to have a guard over a man's self, and to
have one whom thou may respect, whom thou iudgest to have an insight into
thy thoughts. But it is far better to live as if one were a slave to some one
good man, who should be always at his heels: I likewise hold my self
content^ provided always that that which thou do, thou do it as if a man
had an eye upon thee. Solitude induces us to all evil. When thou have
pro^ited so much that thou art ashamed of thy self, thou may let go thy
Tutor; in the mean time keep thy self under the authority of some one:
either let him be Cato, or Scipio, or Laelius, or such as by whose interuiew
men of least hope would suppress their vices also, whilst thou make thy
self him before whom thou dare not offend. When thou have done this, and
that thou have thy self in good esteem, I will begin to permit thee that
which Epicurus himself persuades. At that time especially retire thy self
into thy self, when thou art compelled to be in company, it behooves thee to
differ from many men^ but in the mean while it is no security for thee to
depart from thy self. Consider the one after the other: there is no man that
had not rather be with any man whats^^uer, th^n with himself: then especially
retire thy self into self, when as thou art compelled to be in company, if
thou be a good, quiet, and temperate man; otherwise forsake thy self, and
seek out company: for in this case thou approchest more near to a man of
evil life.

EPIST. XXVI.
That he is old and yet flourishing in mind. He speaks stoutly of death,
which only (says he) shows if any thing be done. The rest are words. Force
and courage shall appear when thou art dying. A clause from EPICVRVS. Learn
to meditate on death.

I Told thee not long since that I am in view of old age, but now I fear me
I have left old age behind me: undoubtedly my years and body at this time
have need of another word; for old is the name of an age wearied and feeble,
and not of that which is altogether wasted and worn out. Number me amongst the
most decrepit; and that have, as the proverb runs, One foot already in the
grave. Nevertheless I accompany thee in thy joy: in this I feel not the
injury of my years in my mind, although I am sensible of them in my body,
only vices and the ministeries of them are quenched by old age. The mind is
frolic and rejoices, because it has not much to do with the body: he
has discharged himself of the greatest part of his burden, he exsulteth and
quarrelleth with me for old age: This, says he, is his slower. Let us believe
him, and suffer him to enjoy his good. I take pleasure to re-knowledge and
dis^erne in my self, what part of this tranquillity and modesty of manners
which I have, I owe unto Philosophy, and what part unto mine age, and
diligently to discuss what things I cannot do, and what things I would not do,
and whether I can any thing that I will not: for if I cannot any thing, I am
glad I cannot: for what cause of complaint is there, or what discommoditie, if
that which n^edes must not be, has ceased to be? It is a great discommoditie,
say thou, to be diminished and to perish: and to speak more properly, to
melt away. For we are not suddenly forced and cast down, we are weakened, and
every day depriueth us of some part of our forces. And what end is better, then
to steal softly on a man's end by the dissolution of nature? not that there is
any evil in this, to be stricken and suddenly deprived of life, but this way is
sweet and gentle, to be by little and little dispossessed and robbed of a man's
self. For mine own part as if I were on the point of trial, and the day were
come which should pronounce the sentence of all my years, I observe, and after
this manner speak unto my self. All that which we have either spoken or done,
until this hour, is naught else but a simple and light promise of the soul,
covered with much deceit: death shall be the only faithful testimony, whether
I have profited or not. Thus prepare I my self courageously for that day,
wherein I will pronounce of my self and judge, all crafts and subtilties laid
aside, whether I speak or think constantly, whether the contumacious words,
whatsoever which I urged and darted out against fortune, were dissembled or
fained. Remove the estimation of men, it is always doubtful and divided on
both parts. Remove the studies, thou have handled all thy life time, death must
pronounce of thee. I say, this, that the disputes and learned conferences, and
the words gatherd from the precepts of wisemen, neither the well-composed
discourse does make show, and approve the true value of a man's mind: for the
fearfullest and forward, and bold in words. It then will appear what thou
have done when thou departest thy life. I accept this condition: I fear not
the judgment. Thus speak I with my self, but suppose likewise that I speak
this to thee. Thou art younger: what skilleth it? our years are not numbered,
it is uncertain in what place death expects thee, therefore expect thou him
in all places. I would now have made an end, and my hand was prefixing the
period: but all solemnities must be observed, and I must give this Epistle his
safe conduct. Think that I tell thee not whence I mean to borrow; for thou
know whose coffer I use. Tarry a little and thou shall be satisfied out of
mine own stock; in the mean time Epicurus shall lend me somewhat, who says;
Meditate whether it be more commodious that death come unto us, or we unto her.
The end hereof is manifest: it is an excellent thing to learn to die. Happily
thou think it to be a fruitless thing to learn that which thou must use
but once. This is that for which we ought to meditate; we must always learn
which whether we know, we cannot make proof of. Meditate on death, who says
thus, commands to meditate on liberty: he that has learned to die, has
forgotten to serve, it is above all power, undoubtedly beyond all. What cares
he for prisons, holds, or restraints? He has always free passage. There is
but one chain that holds us bound, that is the love of life, which as it is
not to be rejected, so is it to be diminished, to the end that if occasion so
fall out, nothing may detain or hinder us, but that we may be ready to do that
presently, which at some other time hereafter we must needs do.

EPIST. XXVII.
He warns and excuses, but what? Is he already good, already perfect? I am
not, says he, but amongst those that are rich. I debate with thee of the
common end, and the remedy of the same. Pleasures hurt or falsely help. Virtue
alone brings forth a solid joy. But assume thou and possess thou her, by
another thou may not. A short and merry history of CALVISIVS. EPICVRVS
saying: Riches are a natural poverty.

Do thou admonish me, say thou, for already thou have admonished, already
corrected thy self? And therefore employest thou thy self to reform others.
And I am not so impudent to go about to cure others, being sick my self; but
lying, as it were, in the same Hospital with thee, and of the same sickness,
I confer with thee upon our common infirmity, and communicate the remedies.
Lend me therefore thine ear, as if I spoke within my self. I give thee
entrance into my countrey-house, and having entertained thee, I expostulate
with my self: I cry unto my self: number thy years, and thou will blush for
shame, that thou willest the same which thou would being a child, and
professest the like; do thy self this good at the last, that thy vices may
die in thee before the day of thy death befall thee. Forsake these loathsome
pleasures, which thou shall full dearly satisfy for, not only those that are
to come, but those also which are past do hurt thee. Even as the remorse of
sins (although unespied when they were committed) remains after them, so the
repentance of loathsome pleasures lives after them: they are not solid, they
are not faithful. Although they hurt not, they take their flight. Rather look
after some good that remains firm: and no one there is, except that which
the mind of it self finds out for himself. Virtue only gives perpetual
and assured joy, although there be some obstacle. Yet happens it after the
manner of clouds, which always fall downwards, and never surmount the day.
When shall it be our good hap to attain unto this joy? There remains much
labor for him that makes ha^^, what for him that gives over and cease? In
which work it concerns thee to bestow both thy vigilancie and labor, if
thou will see it effected. This thing admits no procuration. If thou will be
assisted, thou shall have need of another form of letters. Caluisius Sabinus
in our time was a rich man, and had both the patrimony and wit of a libertine
and freed man. Never saw I man more indecently happy then he was. This man had
so bad a memory, that now he forgot the name of Ulysses, now of Achilles, and
sometimes of Priam, whom he knew as well, as we at this present remember, our
Masters. No old fellow, keeping the rowles of the people and servants, not to
report their proper names, but to give them surnames, that more impertinently
saluteth the tribes of the people, then he saluted the Trojans and Grecians,
yet would he be esteemed learned. He therefore found out these short means, he
bought him slaves with great sums of money, one that held Homer before him,
another that held Hesiodus, and to the nine Liriques, besides he assigned a
several person. That he bought them so hugely dear, thou need not wonder,
he found them not so, but put them forth to be trained. As soon as he had
gotten him this family, he began to importunate those, whom he invited, to eat
with him. At his foot he had his slaves, of whom, when he demanded a verse, to
recite the same, for the most part he forgot himself in the midst of a word.
Satellius Quadratus a smell-feast, and sharker of foolish rich men, and which
follows, a iester, and that which is adiunct to both these, a scoffer,
persuaded him to get him Grammarians, who should recollect that he let slip,
and new inform him. And when Sabinus had told him, that every one of his
slaves had cost him one hundred thousand Sestercies. Thou might (said he)
have bought so many cabinets for thy Acates, for less price, and better
cheap. Yet was he of that opinion, that he thought he knew all that, that any
may in his house knew. The same Satellius on a time began to persuade him to
wrestle, being both a sick, pale and lean man. After that Sabinus had
answered him. Alas, how can I do it, who have scarcely a handful of life? Say
not so, I pray you, said the other, see thou not how many robust and well-set
slaves thou have? A good mind may not be bor^owed or bought, and think that if
it were to be sold, it should scarcely find a chapman; but the evil and
unlettered mind is daily bought. But now receive thou that which I owe thee,
and farewell. Poverty disposed according to the law of Nature, is a great
riches. This does Epicurus inculcate oftentimes in different manners. But it is
never said to much, that is never learned enough. To some we must show, to
other some forcibly apply remedies.

EPIST. XXVIII.
The change of place changes not the mind, `thou ought to change thy
self. Take from thee thy inward pensiveness, every place will be good and
pleasant; yet will I, if I can, choose the quietest and least subject to
troubles or vices. A clause, know thine own sins, now art thou safe.

THou supposest that this has only befallen thee, and admirest it as a
novelty, that in so long a voyage, and many diversity of places: thou have
not shaken off the sadness and heaviness of spirit, it is thy mind thou must
change, and not the air. Although thou have ouer-sailed the vast seas,
although, as Virgil says, Lands and Cities retire from thee, yet will thy
vices follow thee, and tract thee whithersoeuer thou trauellest. The same
answer made Socrates to a certain man, that made the same complaint: Why
wonderest thou that thy voyages profit thee nothing, since thou thy self do
nothing but roll thy self up and down in thy self? The same cause stays
thee, that expels thee. What can the novelty of Lands profit thee, whereto
serves the knowledge of Cities and places: it is a fruitless and frivolous
labor. Will thou hear why these voyages bring thee no good? Thou fliest with
thy self. Thou must discharge thy self of the burden of the mind, for
before that there is no place will please thee: Imagine thy face that it is as
the Poet Virgil induces and describes Sibils, already wholly troubled,
touched, and full of spirit, other then his own: The Prophet storms and
cries, and does aspire
To thrust that godhead out, that did inspire.
Thou go here and there to shake off the burden that ouer-presseth thee,
which puzleth thee the more by the length of thy journey. As in a ship, the
ladings that are less moveable, are those that are less troublesome, and
those that are unequally trussed, do soonest drown that side on which they
settle. All whatsoever thou do, thou do against thy self, and by thy
motion thou hurtest thy selfe^ for thou do shake a sick man. But when thou
have purged thee of this evil, every change of place cannot but give thee
pleasure. Thou may be driven into the most remotest countries, and be
confined in a little corner of Barbary, yet shall that state be hospitable
unto thee, whatsoever it be. It imports more to know what thou art coming,
then where thou arriuest. And therefore ought we not to fix our mind on any
place. In this opinion you must live. I am not borne for one corner. The whole
world is my country. And if thou knew it well, thou would not think it
strange, that in no sort thou art comforted with the variety of countries
wherein thou have bin, since that the country wherein thou last liuedst was
loathsome to thee. For the first thou enteredst had been agreeable unto thee
if thou had made account that every country had been thrown down. Thou
trauellest not but runnest the country: thou trottest and remouest from place
to place, although that very thing thou seek for (that is to say, to live
well) is found in every place. Can there be any thing more turbulent then the
Palace; yet if need be, a man may live peaceably even there. And yet if it
were lawful for me to make mine own choice, I would retire my self far
enough from the frontispice and view of the Court. For even as melancholy
abodes may hazard the firmest constitution, so are things which are less
healthful to a good understanding, which is not wholely accomplished, but in
the way of recovery. I differ from their opinions that keep the mid stream,
approving a tumultuous life, and that courageously fight daily against all
sorts of extremes and tribulations. A wise man will endure, but not choose
these, and had rather be in peace, then in fight. For it profitteth not a man
very much to reject his vices, if he must contest with others. Thirty
tyrants, say thou, environed Socrates, and yet could not make him falter in
his resolutions. What skilleth it how many Lords there be? It is but one
servitude. He that has contemned this servitude, is free before whatsoever
troop of Commanders. It is time to give over, provided that I first pay my
tollage. The knowledge of a man's fault is the beginning of his health. Epicurus
in my opinion has spoken this very worthily. For he that knows not that he
has offended, will not be corrected. Thou must find out thine own error,
before thou amendest thy self. Some glory in their vices; think thou that
they dream of their remedies, that make no difference between villainies and
virtues? Therefore as much as in thee lies reprove thy self, enquire and
search into thy self, play the part of an accuser at the first, then of a
Judge, and lastly of a suppliant; once in thy life offend thy self.

EPIST. XXIX.
That MARCLLINVS is hard to be corrected: For he scorneth and mocketh, yet will
I not give him over, and happily in this sort I will overcome him. EPICVRVS
Sentence, study not to please the people, that is to say many.

THou inquire some news of our friend Marcellinus, and would know what he
does. He comes very seldom unto us, for no other cause, then for that he
fears to hear the truth. From which peril he is now free, for we are to
speak to none, but such as will give ear unto us. Therefore it is wont to be
doubted, whether Diogenes, or any other Cynicks, who have used a promiscuous
and indiscreet liberty, to exhort all such as they meet withal, whether they
ought to do so or no. For to what intent should a man chide the deaf, or
control such as are mute either by nature or sickness? Why, say thou,
should I spare my words, they cost me nothing? I know not whether I shall
profit him whom I admonish. This I know, that I shall profit some one, if I
admonish many. The hand must be scattered. It cannot be, but he shall effect
once, that attempteth often. But I think not, my Lucilius, that this is to be
done to a great man. The authority of the instructor is diminished, and has
almost no power in regard of those that might be corrected by a meaner power.
It is not always needful that a good Archer hit the wh^te, sometimes he may
miss. It is not an Art that casually comes to the effect. Wisdom is an Art
that must aim at a certain end. Let her therefore seek out those that may
be profited by her, and retire her self from those of whom ^he despaireth,
provided always that she abandon them not too soon, but forcibly and
desperately attempt all remedies, when as there is less hope. I have not yet
lost all my hope of our friend Marcellinus, as yet he may be saved, provided he
be suddenly assisted. It is to be feared lest he should draw him, that should
set hands to help him. The power of wit is mighty in him, but already
depraved, and tending to evil. Notwithstanding I will undergo this peril,
and dare to show him his infirmities. I know well that he will follow his old
custom, he will summon and marshall out all those jests, which can provoke
laughter in the eye of lamentation, and will jest at himself first, then at
us, and always prevent that in all things, which I am to speak. He will
search into our schools, and object to our Philosophers their many gifts,
their wenches, and good cheer. He will show me one in adultery, another in
a Tavern, another in Court. He will represent unto me that merry Greek, the
Philosopher Ariston, which was wont to dispute in his Litter, for he had chosen
this time to publish his works. Of whose sect a question being moved, Scaurus
said undoubtedly he is no Peripatetiques. Of the same man, when a question was
moved to Julius Graecinus, a man of good reckoning, what he thought of him: I
cannot (says he) tell thee, for I know not for what he is proper, ^or he has
not ^ixed a firm soote in any degree of Philosophy; as if he were to answer
from a warlike Chariot. He will cast in my teeth the Monteba^ckes, which might
with more honesty contemn, then sell Philosophy; yet am I resolved to suffer
his vpbraids^ Let him move me to laughter, happily I will provoke him to
tears; or if he persevere in his laughter, I will laugh with him, as in a
complete sickness, because he is fallen into so pleasant a manner of madness.
But observe this, this iollitie is not of long continuance. Thou shall behold
such as th^se for a while laugh very heartily, and in as little while rave most
bitterly. I am resolved to set on him, and to show him how far better he
were, when they should esteem him f^rre less. If I cannot wholly cut off his
vices, at the leastwise I will restrain them, they shall not cease but
intermit; but happily they shall cease also, if they take a custom to
intermit. Neither is this to be disliked, because in those that are gi^uously
sick, a good remission of the sickness is taken for health. Whilst thus I
prepare my self for him, see that thou, who can, and know whence thou art
escaped, and in what state thou stand, and thereby presumest how far thou
ought to attain, gou^rne thy manners, raise thy spirit, make head against
those things that are to be doubted, and number not those that give thee cause
of fear. If a man should be afraid of a multitude of people gathered together
in one place, by which every one of them, one after another, must have his
passage; would thou not think him a fool? Though diverse men threaten thy
life, yet diverse cannot attempt after the same manner. The ordinance of Nature
is such, that one only may as soon rid thee of thy life, as one gave it
thee: if thou had any shame in thee, thou had sent me back the last
quarter of my pension. But lest I behave my self untowardly, in paying the
usury of another man's money, I will pay thee that I owe thee. I would never
please the people. For those things I know, the people allows not, and that
which the people allows, I know not. Whose is this, says thou? As if thou
knew not whom I command. Is it Epicurus. But the very same will all of them
declaime unto thee, from every house of the Peripatetiques, Academickes,
Stoickes, Cynickes. For who pleases Virtue, that can please the common people:
popular favor is purchased by evil Arts; thou must needs make thy self like
unto them. They will not allow thee, except they know thee. But it is far
more expedient that thou take heed to that which thou think thy self, then
either to attend, or intend the opinion of others. The friendship that is borne
to dishonest things, cannot be formed, but by dishonest reason. What then;
shall this Philosophy, so much esteemed and preferred above all arts, and
other things have the upper hand, that is, that rather thou make account to
please thy self, then to please the people; that thou esteemest the opinions
of one judgment according to their weight, and not according to their number,
that thou govern thy life without fear, either of gods, or of men: and as
touching misfortunes, either that thou surmount them, or thou end them. But if
I shall see thee in credit by common voice, and favored amiddest the
multitude, if then when thou come into the Theater, the acclamations, the
applauses, and all the equipage of Players and Mimicks make a brute: if even
to the very women and little children, every one speaks well of thee
throughout the town, why should I not have pity on thee, knowing what way
conducteth thee to this favor?

EPIST. XXX.
That we ought to be prepared for death, and take courage in it by example of
AVFIDIVS BASSVS, who being old both willingly hears of the same, and
speaks and proves it with many reasons, that it is not to be feared. By the
way some other things.

I Saw that good man Bassus A^fidius broken and wrestling with age, but at this
present he is so much surcharged therewith, that it is impossible for him to
raise himself again; age has thrown himself upon him with his whole weight.
Thou know very well, that he has always had a weak, a dry body, which
he has long time continued; or, to speak more properly, repaired and pieced;
but in the end it is all at once defeated. Even as in a leaking Ship a man
stops a leake or two, but when it takes in water on every side, there is no
more means to avoid the same, but that it must needs sink to the bottom: so
in a body which is old and crazed, the weakness may for a time be relieved
and fortified, but when the joints fall asunder as an old building, and as the
one is repaired, the other is loosened, there is no other circumspection to be
had, but to think how a man may get out of it. Yet our Bassus has a good
courage, for this Philosophy yields him^ she makes courageous in all
habitudes of the body, joyful in the presence of death, and not faint, hard
in the defiance of life. A good Pilot saileth although his sails be rent; and
if the tempest has disarmed him, yet makes he use of the rest of his rigging
to finish his voyage. The like does our Bassus, and with that mind and
countenance beholds he his end, that thou would judge him to be
ouer-firme and resolute, who should in the like sort behold another man's end.
This is a great virtue Lucilius, and requires long time to be learned, to
forsake this life with a constant resolution, when that unavoidable hour of
death shall approach us. All other kinds of death are intermixed with hope:
Sicknesses are healed, fire is extinguished, the ruinous house sometimes softly
lays them on the ground, which it should altogether crush to pieces. He that
has been swallowed up with one surge of the Sea, has been cast a shore
whole and sound by an opposite billow: the sword which the soldier had aimed
to strike, has been revoked by his hand from the very neck of the conquered;
but he whom age leads unto death, has nothing more to hope, only it is that
alone which admits no comprimise. Men die not more sweetly then after this
manner, neither also in any sort are they longer a dying. Our friend Bassus
seems so to behave himself, as if he should survive himself; so great
constancy and wisdom shows he in this his decadence: for he speaks much
of death, and does it the more carefully, that if there be either incommoditie
or fear in this business, it is the fault of him that dies, not of death;
and that there is no more evil in the same, then after the same: and as mad is
he, who fears that which he is to suffer, as he that fears that which he is
not to feel. Can any man think that these should come to pass, that a man
should feel death, by which we feel nothing? Therefore, says he, death is
not only out of evil, but out of the fear of all evil. I know very well
that such discourses have been often had, and must oftentimes be made: but it
never profited me so much to read or hear them; when they that saw the same
near themselves, were farr^ from danger of those things, which they said
should not be feared. But this man had very much credit and authority with
me, speaking thus of death, whom I saw in himself addressed to die. I will
freely speak that which I think, that he gives a better testimony of his
virtue and constant mind, that approaches the con^ines of death, then he that
is in death it self, for that it is which gives heart to the most fearful,
and animateth against that which is inevitable. So the fearful and dismayed
Fencer during the combat, willingly presents his throat unto his enemy,
and if the sword slip aside, himself addresseth and guides it with his own
hand. But despise her that gives us leisure to see her approach, and is upon
the point to lay hands on us, there needs more settled and maturely
established constancy, which cannot be but in him that is perfectly wise. I
therefore attentively lent ear unto him, and more willingly heard him how he
sentenced of death, and discoursed on the nature thereof, as one that had eyed
her very nigh. More trust and credit, as I think, should he have with thee
that were newly revived from death, and that being experienced in the same,
should show ^hee that there were no evil in death. What perturbation the
access of death brings, they can best tell thee that have more nearly
observed her, that have both seen her coming, and entertained her being come.
Amongst these thou may number Bassus, who unwilling and loath to have us
deceived, tells us that it is as foolish a thing to fear death, as to fear
old age: for even as age follows youth, so death follows age. He would not
live that will not die: for life is given with an exception of death, to fear
which is as much more foolish, then if a man should fear doubtful things, and
attend certain. Death has a necessity equal and invincible, who can
complain that he is in that estate which no man is not in? for the first part
of equity is equality. But now it is a vain matter to plead natures cause,
which would that our condition should be no other then her own. She resolves
that which she has compounded, and whatsoever she h^th resolved, that
compoundeth she again. Now if it be any man's chance to be gently carried away
by age, and not suddenly pulled out of life, but drawn away by minutes, has
he not cause to praise the gods, for sending him after sacietie, a necessary
repose to humanity, and agreeable unto his weariness. Thou see some men
wishing death, yea with ^arre greater z^^le, then they were accustomed to
demand life. I cannot very well tell which of these gives us more heart, either
they which demand, or else they which attend death without trouble or
^ediousnesse, because rage and sudden indignation may be cause of this first
affection, whereas this last can be no other thing, then a tranquillity which
proceeds from discourse and judgment. Some man may precipitate himself into
death through despite and choler, but no man entertaineth her with contentment
when she comes, but he that is formed by long custom and continuance. I
confess that I have more often visited this good man, and my great friend, to
see if I might always find him the same, and whether the constancy of his
mind decayed not through the feeblen^sse of body: but contrariwise, I have
always found that it increased in him, even as we see the joy more manifest in
those, who after they have been long time tired to gain the prize of a course,
approach the place where the palm is proposed. He said (conforming himself to
the precepts of Epicurus) that first of all he should have no pain in that
last gasp; or if he had, that he comforted himself in this, that it should
not be long, because there is no grief which is long, that is, great: and put
the case upon the same point of the division of soul and body, if there
should fall out any torment; he comforted himself with this assurance, that at
leastwise after this grief, there could never any more succeed, and that he
knew very well, that the soul and life of an old man stuck but a little
within his lips, and with a little breath would be easily severed. The fire
that has sufficient matter to feed upon, is extinguished by water, and
sometimes by rain; that fire that wants fuel, dies of it self. I very
willingly give ^are to these things, my Lucilius, not as novelties, but such as
presently henceforth I must make proof of. What then? have I not seen very
many that have abridged the course of their life? I have seen them, but I
esteem them far more, which come unto death without hatred of life, and
which draw her not on, but entertain her. Furthermore he said, that this
trembling and fear which we have, when we believe that death is near unto
us, is forged by our selves, and we travel to ti^e our selves. For to whom is
she not assistant in all places, and at all times? But let us consider, says
he, when any occasion of death seems to approach us, how many other causes
there be that are more near, which are not feared at all. We should fear
death at the hands of our enemy, and in the mean while cruditie, or a cathar
cutteth us short. If we would distinguish the causes of our fear, we shall
find that they are other then they seem to be. We fear not the stroke of
death, but the thought. For we are not further off her at one time then we are
at another. So if death be to be feared, it is always to be feared, for what
time is exempted from death? But I had need to fear, lest thou hate so long
Epistles worse then death. I will therefore make an end. But think thou
always on death, that thou may never fear her.

EPIST. XXXI.
That both the vows and judgments of the common people are to be despised.
That the true good is to be sought for, and that is the knowledge of things, by
which thou may discern truth from falsehood, perishable from durable. He
does illustrate it by examples.

NOw do I acknowledge my Lucilius, he begins to discover himself to be
such a one, as he always promised he would be. Continue then to keep this
course, and follow this tract and fervor of mind, by which in contemning the
popular goods, thou embracest those things that are of better condition. I
desire not that thou should make thy self either more great or better, then
thou endeuourest to be. Thy foundations have occupied a great place, only do
as much as thou have intended to do, and keep thy self to those things which
thou have already conceived. In sum, thou shall be wise, if thou knew
well how to close up thine ears, which it suffices not to damme up with wax:
thou must close stop them after another manner, then Ulysses did those of his
companions. The voice which he feared was sweet and alluring, yet not public.
But that which is to be feared, comes not from one rock only, it sounds
from all parts of the earth. Pass therefore speedily, not only one suspected
place of this traiterous pleasure, but all Cities. Be thou deaf unto those
that love thee mos^. They with a good intent afford thee evil wishes, and if
thou will be happy, beseech the gods that no one of those things that are
wished thee, may fall upon thee. They are no goods, which they wish thou
should be repleni^^ed wi^h. There is but one good, which is the cause and
foundation of a blessed life, to trust a man's self. But this cannot happen
except labor be contemned, and esteemed in the number of these things, which
are neither good nor evil. For i^ cannot come to pass, that one thing should
be now evil, and s^raight good; now light and to be suffered, now
insupportable, and to be feared. Labor is not good, what then is good? the
contempt of labor. I should blame those that are vainly industrious, and to
no purpose. Again, such as endeavor after honest things, the more they busy
themselves, and the less they permit themselves to be overcome and kept at a
stand, I shall admire and cry, arise by so much better, and respire and get
the top of this cli^fe with one breath, if thou can. Labor nourishes
generous minds. Thou art not therefore, according to that old vow of thy
parents, to make choice, what thou would, should befall ^hee, or what thou
should wish: and in sum, to a man that has ouerpassed already mighti^
things, it is unseemly and loathsome as yet to weary the gods. What need
there any vows? Make thou thy self happy, and happy shall thou make thy
self, if thou understand that those things are good, which are mixed with
ver^ue; evil, which are coupled with malice. Even as nothing is clear without
the mixture of light; nothing black, but that which has darkness in it, or
has drawn some obscurity into it self. Even as without the help of fire
nothing is hot, nothing without the air is cold; so the society of virtue and
vice^ make things honest, or dishonest. What therefore is good? the knowledge
of things: what is evil? the ignorance of things. He is a prudent man, and
his arts master, that according to the time repelleth or chooses every thing.
But neither fears he that which he repelleth, neither admireth he that which
he chooses, if so be his mind be great and invincible. I forbid thee to submit
or su^fer thy self to be deprest. If thou refuse not labor, it is a little
matter, require it. What labor therefore, say thou, is frivolous and void?
that into which base causes have called us, is not evil no more then that
which is employed in worthy actions, because it is only the patience of the
mind, which encourages it self to hard and desperate attempts, and says:
Why feares^ thou? It is not a manly part to fear labor: and hereto let that
be annexed, that thy virtue may be perfect, namely, an equality and t^nour of
life in every thing consonant unto it self, which cannot be except the
knowledge of things happen, and Art, by which both diuin^ and humane things may
be known. This is the chiefest good, which if thou possessest, thou beginnest
to be a companion^ not a suppliant of ^he gods. But how, say thou, may one
attain thereunto? It is not by the Apeninne Al^es, or the mount Graius,
neither by the deserts of Candauia, neither art thou to p^sse the Syrtes or
Scilla, or Charibdis, all which thou have done, for the price of a base petty
government. The way that nature has made and taught thee, is full of security
and pleasure. She has given thee those things, which if thou forsake not,
thou shall be made like unto God; but equal with God thy money will not make
thee. God has nothing: Thy proud ornaments will not make thee. God is naked:
The reputation of men, thy ostentation, and the knowledge of thy name will not
make thee. No man knows God, diverse men have a preposterous opinion of him,
yet are they unpunished. The troop of seruitours and slaves which are about
thy litter^ and that bear thee upon their arms in ^ield and City, cannot
likewise serve thee any thing. That mighty and most powerful God, he it is
that carries all things. Neither thy beauty or strength likewise can make
th^e blessed, none of these but is subject to alteration. Thou art therefore to
seek out that, that is not impaired by any, and that is such a thing, as a man
cannot wish a better. What is this? a mind: but this right, good, and great.
What else will thou call this, but a god, dwelling in humane body? This mind
may fall as well, into a Roman Knight, as a Libertine, or servant. For these
names are forged out of ambition or injury. It is lawful from the least corner
of the world, to leap up into heaven. Raise thy self therefore, and fashion
thy self worthy of God: but this cannot be made either with gold or silver.
Of such matter as this a man cannot make an Image that resembles God. Remember
that they when they were favorable unto us, their Images were made of earth.

EPIST. XXXII.
He praises LVCILIVS his solitude and retyring. Moreover, he exhorts that no
man should steal away the time, being so short, and flitting. That he contemn
also v^lgar vows.

I Diligently enquire of thy behavior, and demand of all those that come from
the place where thou dwell, what thou do, and where, and with whom thou
abidest. Thou can not deceive me, I am with thee. Live thou in that fashion,
as if I heard what thou did, yea as if I saw thine actions. Thou requirest
of me, what delights me most, of those things I hear of thee? Truly it is
that I hear nothing of thee, and that the most part of those whom I question
with about thee, know not what thou do. It is a wholesome advice not to
converse with those which are different from thy nature, and that affect other
things then thou do. I am settled in this hope, that thou can not be
mis^ed, and that thou will ^irmely keep thy deliberation, although a troop of
troublesome men do haunt round about thee. What is it then? I fear not that
they will change thee, but I fear they will hinder thee. But he hurts very
much that delayeth and especially in this life, which is so short, which we
abbreui^t by inconstancy, giving it now one beginning, afterward, and that
instantly another. We divide it, and cut it in pieces. Haste thee then, my
dearest Lucilius, and think with thy self, how much thou should double thy
pace, if behind thee thou were pressed by thine enemy, if thou thoughtest the
horseman pursued thee, and traced after the footsteps of those that fled.
Thou art at that point, thou art chased, haste thee, and escape: bring thy
self into a place of security; and then incontinently after consider, how
worthy a thing it is to consummate a man's life, before death, then to expect
security in the remainder part of his time placed in the possession of a
blessed life, which is not made more blessed if longer. O when shall thou see
that time, wherein thou know that time app^rtaineth not unto thee, wherein
thou shall be peaceable and contented, and neglectfull of to morrow, and in
chiefest sacietie of thy self? Will thou know what it is that makes men
greedy of that which is to come? No man is for himself: thy father and mother
have wished thee diverse things^ but contrariwise, I wish thee the contempt of
all those things, whereof they would have thee enjoy the affluence. Their vows
spoil many to enrich thee: whatsoever they transfer unto thee, is to be
extorted from another. My desire is, that thou should dispose of thy self,
that thy spirit being assailed with incertaine ^antasies should resist them,
and be settled, that it should please it self, and understanding true goods,
which are possessed as soon as they are known, should need no adiection of age.
Finally, he has ouer-gone his necessities, and is discharged and free, who
lives when his life is done.

EPIST. XXXIII.
He denies that sentences or short lessons should be gathered from the
Stoics: first, because all things are replenished and ^ull of such things;
again, because it is unseemly to speak always by authority. Let us make
them ours, and prefer them in our life.

THou desire in these Epistles also, as in the former, that I set down
certain sentences of our Masters. They were not much occupied about the
flowers of discourse: all their manner of speech was subs^antiall and manly:
know thou that inequality is there, where those things that are eminent are
notable. No man admireth one tree, when as all the wood is grown to the same
height. With these and such like sentences, all Poems and Histories are
stuffed. I will not therefore have thee think that they are of Epicurus: they
are vulgar, and especially mine own. But in that are they most noted, because
they seldom occur, because unexpected, because it is a wonder that any thing
should be constantly spoken by a man that professes delicacie: for so do
diverse men judge; but in my opinion ^picurus is valiant, although e^^eminately
dressed. Fortitude and industry, and a mind addressed to war, as well
lodges in a Persian as a high-girt Roman. Thou must not therefore exact at my
hands choice and well digested stuff, that is continual amongst our Masters,
which amongst others is selected. We vent not therefore these eye-pleasing and
odoriferous wares, neither deceive we our Merchant, like to find nothing when
he enters, besides those which are hanged up in the front for a show. We
permit them to take their pattern from whence they please. Think thou that
I will take out of the whole Map the particular sentences of any? To whom shall
I assign them, to Zeno, or Cleanthes, or Chrysippus, or Panaetius, or
Possidonius? We are not under a King; ^uery one maintayneth himself in his
own liberty: with them whatsoever ^ermarchus says, whatsoever Metrodorus, it
is referred to one. All whatsoever any man has spoken in that companie^ is
spoken by authority, and directions of one alone. We cannot, I tell thee,
although we attempt that out of so great abundance of equal things, bring
forth any thing: It is a poor man's part to count his ^locke.
Wheresoever thou fixes^ thine eye, thou shall meet with that which might be
eminent, unless it were read amongst others of equal worthiness: for which
cause lay apart this hope, which flattereth thee with the possibility, that
thou may summarily conceive the choysest things, which the greatest spirits
have conceited. They are entirely to be looked over, and wholly to be discussed.
When a man does any thing he intends the same, and by the project of his
spirit the work is compiled, of which a man can dis^member nothing without the
ruin of the whole. I deny thee not but that thou may consider every member
one after another, provided it be in a man that has them. The woman is not
fair whose leg or arm is praised, but she whose full representation is
cause that a man admireth not her parts; yet if thou exact the same, I will not
deal so niggardly with thee as I make show for, but with a full hand. There is
a huge company of them that li^ scattered here and there: they are to be
taken, but not gathered; for they fall not, but flow perpetually, and are tied
together amongst themselves: neither doubt I but that they will profit those
who are as yet rude, and yield but a superficial attention. For those things
that are circumscribed and molded after the manner of a verse, are more easily
remembered. Therefore give we children certain sentences to commit to memory,
and those which the Grecians call Chries, because a childish wit can comprehend
them, being as yet incapable of a more certain and solid science. A complete
man has no honor to gather nose-gayes, to stay himself and build on certain
usual or few words, and to trust unto his memory, he ought to trust
himself. Let him speak these but not retain them: for it is a base thing for
an old man, or such a one as is stepped in years to be wise in nothing but his
note-booke. This said Zeno, what say thou? This Cleanthes, but what thou?
How long art thou directed by others? both command and say what shall be
committed to memory, and produce somewhat of thine own. I think therefore
that these neuer-authors, but always interpreters, lying hid under the shadow
of other men, have no generous nature in them, which never dared to publish
that which they had learned in long space of time, but have exercised their
memory on other men's labors. It is one thing to remember, another thing to
know: to remember is to keep a thing in memory which is committed; but
contrariwise, to know is to make every thing his own, neither to hang on
examples, and so oftentimes to look back to his Master. This says Zeno, that
Cleanthes: make some difference betwixt thee and thy book; how long will thou
be a learner? At last employ thy self to teach others: what profits it me to
hear that I may read? The living voice, says he, does much; not that which
is recommended by another man's words, and serves but in stead of a Register.
Add hereunto now, that they who are never their own Masters, first in that
thing do follow their ancestors, wherein no man has not revoked from the
former. Again, they follow them in that, which is yet in question: and it will
never be found, if we shall be content with those things that are found.
Moreover, he that follows another man has found nothing, and which is worse,
he seeks nothing. What then? Shall I not follow the steps of mine ancestors?
Truly I will keep the old ways: but if I find out one more short, I will
take it and maintain it. They that before us have managed these things, were
not our Lords, but our guides. Truth is open unto all men: she is not as yet
borne away all; there is much of her left for posterity to find out.

EPIST. XXXIIII.
That he is glad of LVCILIVS proficiencie, because it was from him, and he
formed him. Moreover he exhorts him to go forward even to perfection.

I Grow great, and leap for joy, and shaking off min^ old age, I grow young
again, as often as I understand by those things thou do and writest, how
much thy self exceedest thy self (for long since thou hadd^st forsaken the
troops of common society) If the tree being grown to bear fruit delights
the husbandman: if the Shepherd take pleasure in the fruitfulness of his
flock: if no man beholds his ^oster child otherwise, but that he reputeth
his young y^ares to be his own: what think thou befalls them which have
formed young spirits, when those they have trained up raw, they suddenly see
ripe. I challenge thee for mine, thou art mine own labor. When first I saw
thine inclination, I laid hold on thee, I exhorted thee, I encouraged thee;
neither permitted I thee to pace on sof^ly, but I pricked thee forward, and now
do I the like, and henceforward I am to give thee courage, as long as thou
shall speedily run forward, and thou reciprocally art to exhort me. What
other thing have I desired hitherto, say thou? In this the greater part of
time is spent. For so even as the beginnings of the work are said to occupy
the half, so is this business for the mind. The greater part of good, is to
desire to become good. Know thou whom I call good? I mean a perfect and
absolute man, whom no force or necessity can provoke to do evil. And
already, me thinks, I epsy such a man in thy self, if thou pers^uer and
endeavor, and effect this, that all thy deeds and words may be agreeable and
correspondent in themselves, and stamped after one coin. His mind is
estranged from the right way, whose acts are discordant.

EPIST. XXXV.
He wishes him to be his friend that is a good man, otherwise no man is a
friend, although he loves. Let him therefore do, and especially learn this,
to live conveniently; that is constantly, that is wisely.

WHen as so ^arnes^ly I entreat thee to study, I do mine own business: I
will have a friend; which will not come to pass, except thou persevere to
beauti^ie thy self, as thou have begun. For now thou love me, but thou art
not my friend: what then? is there any difference betwixt these two? what
else? they are unlike. He that is a friend loue^h, and he that loves is not
assuredly a friend. For which cause friendship always profits, and love
sometimes hurts. If thou do no other thing, profit at least wise so well,
that thou may learn to love well. But above all things haste thy self
during the time thou studiest for me, for fear thou learn^st not for another.
Verily I do already participate the fruit^, when I imagine with my self that
we shall be of one mind, and that all that vigor which is eclipsed in mine
age, shall return unto me from thine, although there is little difference
betwixt the one and the other, yet will I really and essentially take my
pleasure. There is a certain contentment that comes unto us from those, we
love although they be absent; but it is but a light and ^raile pleasure. The
sight, the presence, and conversation have some living pleasure in them, and
principally if thou beholdest not only him whom thou desire, but him who is
such a one whom thou desire. Present thy s^lf^ therefore unto me as an
honorable and acceptable gift; and to the end thou may press in the more,
think me to be old, and thy self to be mortal. Hasten thee to me, but first
of all to thy self, profit thy self indeed. And above all things let this be
thy care, that thou be constant to thy self. As often times as thou have a
will to make trial, whether in any sort thou be changed, observe thy self,
whether thou willest the same things to day, that thou did yesterday. The
change of the will betokens that the mind swimmeth in one place, and
appears in another, even as the wind carries it. That which is firm and
has a good foundation varieth not,. This perfectly happens to a wise man,
and in some measure to a proficient, and he that has as yet attained further.
What difference is there then? This is in a manner moved, yet passes not
further, but is shaken from his place, the other is in no sort moved.

EPIST. XXXVI.
He prayseth a certain man that had deposed himself to retirement, and
forsaken the Commonweal. He advises him to contemn the common talk, to
proceed in goodness, or rather to be made good. Let him go ^orward to despise
death, and that with reason.

EXhort thy friend to contemn those with a mighty mind, that blame and
reprove him for seeking out retirement and quiet, forsaking his dignities, and
for preferring his quiet above all things, when as he might have obtained most
honor. Let him make them every day perceive, how profitably he has managed his
affairs. They whose felicity is envied, will not desist from alterations,
some shall be stricken down, othersome shall fall. Felicity is a turbulent
thing, she tormenteth her self, she moves the mind after diverse fashions: she
pusheth some into greatness, other into effeminacie: these she puffs up,
those she mollifieth and wholly dissolueth. But some man bears his felicity
well, yea so as some do their wine. There is no reason therefore, that these
men should persuade thee, that he is happy, who is besieged with many suitors,
they flock to him, as to a lake whom they draw dry, they trouble grievously.
They call this friend, and lover of Philosophy, a trifler and a sluggard. Thou
know that some men speak peruersely in a contrary sense. They called him
happy: what of this? was he so? I make no account of this, that to some man he
seems too severe and sullen minded. Ariston said that he had rather have a
sad young man, then such a one as was pleasing and amiable to the common sort.
The wine is made good which is ^roubl^d and sharp when it is new, and it
becomes flat before maturitie, that pleased in the fat. Let them call him sad
and enemy to his aduancements: this sadness of his will give him good in his
latter days. Let him persevere only to love virtue, and exercise himself in
the good and Liberal Sciences, not those wherewith it suffices to be only
tainted and informed, but those wherewith the mind is to be stained and
confirmed in. This is the true time of learning. What then? Is there any time
wherein we are not to learn? Not so, but even as at all times it is honest for
us to study, so in all ages is it not convenient to begin. It is an absurd
and base thing to see an old man at his Abee. The young man must get, and the
old man enjoy. Thou shall therefore do a thing profitable for thy self, if
thou make him a good man, we ought to seek to give thee presents, where it
is as much expedient to give as to receive. Finally, since he has already
promised very much of himself, it concerns him to continue. For it is less
absurd to play the banquerout with a man's creditour, then with good hope. To
pay this debt of another: he that trafficketh has need of a good and happy
navigations: he that tilleth the field, of a fertile soil and a favorable
climate, he only with a good will may testify that which he owes. Fortune
has no power over manners. Let him dispose these in such sort, that that most
quiet mind of his may come to perfection, which feels nothing taken from him,
neither added to him, but remains in the same state, whatsoever casualties
befall him: who, if common fortunes be heaped on him, is eminent above his
means, or if any of these things, or all by fortune are taken from him, is no
ways lessened by his misery. If he were borne in Parthia, he would presently
bend his bow, being an infant, if in Germany he were a very infant, he would
shake his tender spear. If he had lived in the time of our ancestors, he had
learned to ride, and to combat with the enemy hand to hand. These are the
things which the discipline of the Country teaches and commands every one.
What is it then that this man ought to learn? That which is proof against all
offensive arms, and all sorts of enemies, is the contempt of death. For it is
not to be doubted, but that it has in it self something terrible, that may
offend our minds (which Nature has formed in love of her self) neither also
should it be needful for him to address and accustom himself to that,
whereunto our natural inclination s^fficiently disposes us, as is the desire
to conserve a man's self. No man learneth to have power, if need so required,
to lie sweetly and softly amongst the roses: but to this is he accustomed not
to submit his faith and honor to torments, but to keep watch in the trenches
standing, yea sometimes wounded: neither leaning to the dart, because in the
interim sleep seems to steal on those that lean to any stay. Death has no
incommoditie, for there must be some thing, whereby she would be indamnified.
And if thou have so great a desire of prolonging thy life, consider that none
of these things that fly before our eyes, and hide themselves in the bosom of
Nature, from which once they are parted, and shall again depart, is not
consumed. They cease, but perish not, and the death which we fear and refuse,
only intermitteth life, but rauisheth it not. A day will come that shall
restore us once more to light, which happily diverse would refuse, except it
reduced those that are forgotten. But hereafter I will show more exactly, if
all things which seem to perish are changed: he therefore that must return,
ought not to be grieved to depart. Observe the circle of things that return
into themselves, thou shall see that nothing is extinguished in this world, but
that all things descend and mount again by changes. The Summer departs, but
another year brings it again. The Winter passes, but yet has he his
months to bring him back again, The night concealeth the Sun, and
presently the day drives this away. This course of the Stars returns back
again to the place where first they began, and which they passed over. A part
of the heaven is continually rising and a part setting. To conclude, after I
have annexed this one thing, I will make an end, neither infants nor children
or mad men fear death. It were therefore more then an abject error in us, if
reason should not afford us that security, whereunto folly animateth us.

EPIST. XXXVII.
That we ought to persevere in the way and warfare of wisdom: on her
depends health, felicity, and liberty. That we may obtain, and overcome
the same by the conduct of war.

THat which is the greatest obligation to prepare a man to a good mind, thou
have promised to be a good man, and by oath thou have confirmed it. If any man
tell thee that a soldiers profession is delicate and facile, he deceives
thee; I will not have thee deceived. The form of that honorable oath, and of
that other so dishonorable are in the same terms, that is, To be burnt, bound,
and slain with the sword. To those that gave their hands to hire upon the
sands of the Theater, that eat and drink that which they ought to pay with the
price of their bloods, it is couenanted with them that they suffer these things
against their wills: from thee it is expected, that thou willingly and freely
su^fer the same. To them it is permitted to lay down their weapons, and to
implore the mercy of the people. Thou shall neither submit thy self, nor beg
for thy life, it is thy part to die constantly, and with an invincible mind.
But what profits it to gain a few days or years? We come into this world
without releasement. How then, say thou, may I acquit my self? Thou can
not avoid necessities, but thou may overcome them. Make thy way, and
Philosophy shall give it thee; to her have thy recourse, if thou will be safe,
if secure, if blessed; and ^inally (which is above all) if thou desire to be
free. This cannot otherwise happen. Folly is a base abiect^ ^ordide, and a
servile thing, subject to many, and they most cruel affections. Wisdom which
is the sole liberty, dismisseth those rude masters, which sometimes command by
course, and sometimes are together. There is but one way to attain thereunto,
and certainly it is the righ^ way: thou can not wander out of it, martch
boldly, if thou will make all things subject unto thee, subject thy self to
reason; thou shall govern many; if thou be governed by reason. Thou shall
learn of her, how and to whom thou shall address thy self. Thou shall not be
surprised in affairs. Thou shall not bring me any man that knows how he
began to will that which he wills. He is not invited thereunto by mature
deliberation, but it is an enforcement that drives him thereunto. Fortune
oftentimes does no less haunt us, then we hunt after her. It is a base thing,
not to go, but to be carried perforce, and suddenly (being altogether amazed
amiddest the storm of affairs) to ask; How came I hither.

EPIST. XXXVIII.
That precepts are oftentimes more profitable to wisdom then disputes. That
they do steal upon the mind, and do fructisie and spend themselves after
the manner of seed.

NOt without cause requirest thou, that we frequent this commerce of Epistles
betwixt thee and me. The discourse profits much, that by little and little
steals into the mind. The disputes which a man is addressed to vent in the
cares of the attentive multitude, have brute enough and less priuacie.
Philosophy is good counsel. No man gives counsel with clamor, yet must we
sometimes (as I should say) use these declamations, when he that doubts had
need to be enforced. But where this is not to be effected, to inkindle a will
in man to learn; but that in good earnest he learneth, it is good to use
these more submissiue speeches. They enter more sweetly; but they continue, for
there need not many, but such as are effectual. We ought to spread them as
seed, which although it be little, dilateth his forces, when it falls into a
good soil; and of so little as it is, it extends it self into great and
marvelous great increases. The like does speech, it has no extent, if thou
look into it, it increases in the work. They are few things which are
spoken, but if the mind entertain them well, they fructificand increase in
themselves. The same I tell thee is the condition of precepts, as of seeds,
they effect much, although they be short^ but as I have said; let a mind well
disposed and settled, draw them to it self. Her self will profit very much at
her time, and shall restore more then it has received.

EPIST. XXXIX.
That diverse, and they diversely have written in Philosophy. That we ought to be
stirred up, and enkindled by example. That Nature has this scope to call us to
high things. In which there is no plebeian felicity, neither pleasure, because
they are either frail or hurtful.

THe Commentaries thou demandest at my hands carefully disposed and reduced
into an abridgement, I will truly compose. But see whether an ordinary
Oration be not more profitable, then this which is now commonly called a
Breuiarie, and in times past when we spoke Latin, a Summarie. The one is more
necessary for him that learneth, the other for him that understands; the one
teaches, the other remembers. But of both these I will ^econcile both the one
and the other. It needs not now that thou exact at my hands, either this or
that authority. He is unknown that brings his Proctor with him. I will write
what thou willest; but after mine own manner. In the mean time thou have
many, whose writings I know not whether they be sufficiently digested or no.
Take in hand the list of the Philosophers. This very sight will compel thee to
rouse thy self, and if thou see how many have labored for thee, thou thy
self likewise wilt desire to be one of them. For a generous mind has this
excellent impression in it, that it is inkindled and incited to honest things.
There is no nobly minded man, that is delighted with base and contemptible
things: he only seeks after and extolleth those things, which make show of
greatness and worthiness. Even as the flame directly mounteth upward, neither may
be diuerted nor depressed, or lose his actiuitie: so is our spirit in
continual motion, by so much the more stirring and active, by how much it is
more vehement and mighty. But happy is he that has employed the viuacitie
hereof in matters of better estimate: he shall settle himself in a place
exempted from Fortunes command or jurisdiction: his felicities he shall temper,
his adversities conquer, and contemn those things that draw other men to
admiration. It is the effect of a great mind to contemn great things, and
rather to affect the mean, then be infected with excess. For these are
pro^itable and permanent, the other hurtful, because superfluous. So too great
fertility lays the corn, so boughs ouer-loaden are broken, so too much
fruitfulness never ends in maturitie. The like also be falls those minds
that are broken, and corrupt with immoderate felicity, because ^hey are not
only employed to other men's injury, but also to their own. What enemy so
outrageous against any man, as is some men's voluptuousness against themselves?
whose impotencie and mad lust thou may pardon for this one reason, because
they suffer that which they offended in. Neither undeservedly does this fury
vex them; for it is necessari^, that desire should extend it self above
measure, that has falsi^ied the mediocritie of nature: for natural affection
has his end, but vain things, and such as spring from an excessive lust, are
interminable. Profit measures things necessary; how will thou confine
sup^rfluities? They therefore drown themselves in pleasures, which they cannot
shake off, in that they are brought into a custom: and for this cause are they
most miserable, because they are grown unto those terms, that those things
which were superfluous unto them, are made necessary; they therefore s^rue
their pleasures, and enjoy them not, and love their own mischief, which is
the worst of all mischief. And then is infelicitie consummat^, whereas such
things as are dishonest, not only do delight, but also please: and then is
the remedy hopeless, where such things as were dishonest, are reputed for
common custom.

EPIST. XL.
He exhorts to write, because in it is the Image of the mind. Then of
SERAPIONS prompt and profuse speech, which he alleges to be indecent for a
Philosopher. A grave and slow speech enters and descends farther.

IN that thou writest often unto me, I thank thee; for by that only means
which thou can, thou show thy self unto me. I never r^ceiue thy Epistle,
but that forthwith we are together. If the pictures of our absent friends be
pleasing unto us, which renew their m^morie, and by a false and fained solace
do lighten the grief of their absence; how much more pleasing are letters,
which set before our eyes the true trace and lively picture of our absent
friends? For that which gives us an unspeakable conten^, the hand of a friend
that writes a letter unto us, causes us to feel. Thou writest unto me, that
thou heardest Serapion the Philosopher, when he arrived in those parts, and how
it was his custom in discoursing to huddle up his worde^ with great
volubilitie, which he powers not out together, but smothe^eth and forces: for
more is uttered then one voice can articulate. This allow I not in a
Philosopher, whose pronounciation, as his life, ought to be composed. But
no^^ing is well ordered that is precipitate and hasty. For this caus^ that
running and continuate discourse in Homer that falls incessantly like snow,
is properly attributed to the Orator; where that which is more slow, and
sweeter th^n honey flows from an old man. Resolve therefore on this, that
this violent and abundant vigor of discourse, is more fit for a jester or
Mountebanke, then him that debateth on a grave and serious subject, or such a
one that will teach another man. Neither will I that the discourse be too
headlong, neither too dreaming^ neither such as may suspend attention, or
confound the hearing For that defect and imbecilitie of speech makes the
auditor less attentive, by reason of the disgust of interrupted slownesse: yet
is that more easily imprinted in memory which is expected, then that which
passes away slightly. Furthermore men are said to give precepts to those will
learn: it is not given, that flies. Add hereunto now, that the discourse
which serves to manifest truth, ought to be simple and without flourish. This
popular discourse, has no truth in it, it tends only to move the people,
and is forcible to ravish inconsiderate ^ares, it admits no moderation, but
suffers it self to be carried away. But how can it govern, which cannot be
governed? Finally, what should a man think of that discouse, which serves to
heal the infirmities of the spirit, except it should search and descend into
us? Medicines cure not except they be digested: moreover, it has much
slightness and vanity in it, and has more report then reckoning in it. The
things that terrify me must be lenified, which provoke me must be pacified,
that deceive me must be shaken off: lechery must be restrained, covetousness
reproved; what one of these things can be done suddenly? What Physician cur^th
his Patients by only passing by them? What profits this noyce of headlong and
vnchosen words, which yield not a shadow of any pleasure? But even as it is
sufficient to know diverse things, which thou would not believe they could be
done, so is it sufficient to hear them once, that have exercised themselves in
this manner of discourse. For what can a man learn, or what will he imitate,
or what can he judge of their minds whose speech is confused and hudled, and
cannot be restrained? Even as they that run from a steep hill, stay not
themselves in that place where their intention was, but are borne down swiftly
by the weight of their bodies, and transported further then they would; so this
viuacitie and celerite of speech, cannot command it self, neither is it
sufficiently beseeming Philosophy, which ought to employ words, and not to
cast them away, but by little and little to advance it self. What then? Shall
it not sometimes swell also? Why not, provided that the honesty of manners be
not interessed; which is not deprived by maine force and minicke impetuositie
of words? Let her have great force but moderate. The water must have a
continual course, but not rauishing. I scarcely will permit an Orator to have
such swifnesse in discourse so irreuocable, and boundles: for how can a Judge
follow the list of his discourse, especially if it be impertinent and rude, if
he suffer himself at that time to be borne away by ostentation, or such a
passion as he cannot master? Let him in such sort make have, and infer that his
auditories attention may be able to conceive. Thou shall therefore do well, if
thou visit them not who seek how much, and not what they speak. And if it
happen that thou art to make an Oration, then make thy choice to speak after
the manner of Publius Vinicius, of whom it being on a time demanded, how he
discoursed? As^llius answered continually: for Geminius Varius had said, I know
not how you call this man an eloquent man, he cannot couple three words
together. Why had thou not rather say so as Venicius did? Let some fool
come hither, and when he shall see him dream out his words one after another,
as if he dictated and not discoursed, bid him Speak or never speak. My
opinion is, that the form of hasty speech, which in that time the famous
Orator Harterius used, ought to be rejected by men of understanding: he never
doubted, he never intermitted, he began and ended after the same manner: yet
think I, that some things ar^ more or less convenient for people of different
nations. Amongst the Greeks this license were to be borne withal, and we also
when we write, are wont to point every word. And now Cicero also from whom
Roman eloquence gathered excellency, was temperate in his discou^ses. The
Roman tongue ouer-look^th all, and will be both respected and courted.
Fabianus a worthy man both in life and science (and that is least of these) in
eloquence also, disputed more quickly then veh^mently, so as it might be said,
that it was a facility, and not a celeriti^. This admit I in a wiseman: I
exact not that his speech be delivered without impediment; rather had I it
should be pronounced then lauished. And the more do I deter thee from this
sicken^sse, because this thing cannot otherwise befall thee, then by ceasing to
have modesty. Thou may rub thy brow, and not hear thy selfe^ for this
unadvised course will draw on many things, which thou would not let slip
without reprehension. These things I tell thee cannot happen unto thee without
prejudice of thy modesty: Besides, thou had need of daily exercise, and
thy study is to be transferred from matters to words: and these also, although
they flow with thee, and may run fluent without any labor of thine, yet are
they to be tempered: for even as a modest gate becomes a wiseman, so does a
settled and not extrauagant discourse. The total sum then of this account
shall be this, I enjoin thee to be slow in speech.

EPIST. XLI.
Oh excellent and deep Epistle! That God dwells in us, and that a good man is
nothing without him. Let us honor him, and the mind that descends from him.
In him are our peculiar and proper goods, all other are foreign. But the thing
that is good is perfect reason.

THou do a worthy thing, and profitable to thy self, if, as thou writest,
thou perseuerest to obtain a good mind. How fond is it to wish the same, when
as it depends on thine own will? Thy hands are not to be lifted up to
heaven, neither is the Prelate to be entreated, to admit thee to the ears of
an Image, that thou might be the better heard: God is near unto thee, he
is with thee, he is within thee. Thus tell I thee, Lucilius: A sacred spirit
is resident in us, an obseruer and guardian both of our good and evils: he in
like manner as we entreat him, so handles he us. There is no good man but
has a God within him. May any man insult over fortune, except he be assisted
by him? he it is that gives the noblest and most upright counsels. In every
good man (but what God it is uncertain) God inhabiteth. If happily thou light
into a thick grove, full of ancient trees, and such as exceed the common
height, sh^dowing the sight of heaven from thee, through the thickenesse of
boughs cou^^ing one another; that height of the wood, and secrecy of the
place, and the admiration of the shadow, so thick and continuate in the open
sky, will persuade thee there is some divine presence. And if a Cave
ouer-hangeth a Mountain, eaten out of the Rock, not made by hands, but
hollowed by natur^ll causes into such a concauity, it will strike thy mind with
a certain conceit of Religion. We adore the head-springs of great rivers. A
sudden eruption of a vast river out of the depth has alters. The fountains
of warm waters are honored, and the shadow or huge depth of some standing
poole has sacred it. If thou behold a man that is dreadles of perrils,
untouched with desires, happy in his afflictions, pacified in midst of
tempests, beholding men from a high place, the gods from an equal; will thou
not grow into a certain veneration of him? Will thou not say this is a greater
and more high thing, then that it might be trusted to so little a body as it
inhabiteth? The divine power descends hither. This excellent and moderate
mind, ouerpassing all things as if abject, laughing at whatsoever we either
fear or hope is inkindled by a celestial power. So great a thing cannot
consist without the help of a God. Therefore as touching the greatest part of
him, he is there from whence he descended. Even as the Sun beams do in a
manner touch the earth, but remain there from whence they are sent; so a great
and sacred mind, and to this end humbled, that he may more nearly apprehend
divine things is conversant in us, but cleaves to his original. Thereon it
depends, thereat it aymeth, and thereto it endeavors, to us it
appertains, as the better part. What a one therefore is this? a mind that
depends on no other good but his own. For what is more foolish then to
praise that in a man which is foreign to him? And what more mad then that man,
that admireth those things, which may immediately be transferred unto another
man? The golden raynes make not the horse the better. In one sort does the
golden crested Lion subject himself whilst he is handled, and is compelled
(being ouer-wearied) patiently to receive his ornaments; in another sort such a
one as is generous and untamed. This being sharp in his assault, such as nature
would have him to be, fair in his dreadfulnesse, whose comlines is in this,
not to be beheld without fear, is preferred before that faint and trapped one:
no man ought to glory but in that which is his own. We praise the Vine if she
load her branches with fruit, if she bears down her vnder-props unto the
ground, by reason of the weight of those branches she bears. Will any man
prefer that Vine before this, that has golden grapes and golden leaves
hanging from it? The proper virtue in the Vine is fertility: in a man also
that is to be praised which is his own. He has a fair train, a goodly house,
he sows much, he makes much by usury; none of these things is in him but
about him. Praise that in him, which neither may be taken away, nor given,
which is properly a man's. Ask thou what it is? The mind, and perfect reason
in the mind. For man is a reasonable creature; his good therefore is
consummate, if he has fulfilled that to which he was borne. But what is that
which this reason exacteth at his hands? An easy matter; to live according to
his nature: but common madness makes this thing difficult. We thrust one
another into vices, but how may they be recalled unto health, whom no man
restrains, and the people thrusts on.

EPIST. XLII.
That we are not suddenly to give credit or judgment of a good man, because
it is a matter of much moment. That some make show, others dissemble; not
unlikely to prove evil, if occasion be offered. He teaches this by a
certain man's example. Then, that we are not to labor in external things,
which have incommodities, or false commodities in them.

THis man has already persuaded thee, that he is a good man, and yet a good
man may not so soon either be made or understood: Know thou now whom I
term a good man? Him who is ordinarily so reputed: for that other happily like
another Phoenix is borne once in five hundredth years: neither is it to be
wondered at, that great and rare things are in long continuance and space of
time begotten. Fortune often times produces mean things, such are borne in
troops; but such things as are excellent she commends in their raritie. But
this man as yet is very far from that which he professes; and if he knew
what a good man were, he would not as yet believe himself to be one, and
happily also he would despair that he might be one. But he thinks ill of
the evil, and this do the evil also: neither is there any greater punishment
of wickedness, then that it displeases both himself and his. But he hates
those that impotently use a sudden and great power: the same will he do when
he can the same. Diverse men's vices lie hidden because they are weak, addressed
notwithstanding to attempt, and dare as much as they whom felicity has
discovered, as soon as they may have any assurance of their forces. They want
the instruments to express their malice. So may a venomous serpent likewise be
safely handled whilst he is stiff with cold, not that he wants his venom,
but because they are benumbed. The cruelty, ambition, and intemperance of
diverse men would attempt as bad offices as the basest men, if fortune failed
them not, give them only the power as much as they list, thou shall easily
perceive their will. Do thou not remember, that when thou toldest me, that
thou had such a man in thy power, that I answered thee, that he was
unconstant and variable, and that thou heldest him not by the foot but by the
feather? Told I thee a lie? He was held by a feather, which he shaked off and
fled. Thou know very well what Tragedies he afterward excited, and how
many things he attempted, which in all likelihood at last were to fall on his
own head: he perceived not how by other men's perils he came headlong into his
own, he thought not how burthensom the things were which he asked, although
they were not superfluous. This therefore in those things which we affect, and
for which we travel; for with great labor we ought to observe and look into,
either that there is no commodity in them, or else more incommoditie. Some
things are superfluous, some are not of so much esteem; but these things we
foresee not, and those things that cost us most dearly, seem unto us to be
given for nothing. Herein although our stupiditie be most apparent, that we
only think those things to be bought, for which we pay our money, and those
things we call gratuitall, for which we sell and give our selves; which we
would not buy if it should cost us one of our houses, if we should redeem the
same with some fruitful and pleasant possession: to these are we most ready to
attain with much care, with peril, with hazard of our modesties, liberty,
and time, so is there nothing more abject and contemptible to every man then
himself. Let us therefore in all our counsels and affairs do that which we
are wont to do: as often as we go to the Merchant of any ware to buy, let us
see and examine that which we desire, and know the price thereof. That
oftentimes is highest prized for which no price is given. I can show thee many
things, which being gotten and possessed, have extorted our liberty from us: we
should be our own if these were not ours. Think^ therefore very carefully upon
these things, not only where there shall be question of gain, but also of
loss: is this perishable? for it was casual; thou shall as easily live
without this as thou liuedst before. If thou have had it long, thou lose^^ it
after thou art glutted therewith: if but a little while, thou losest it before
thou had the true taste and use therefore. If thou have less money, thy
trouble shall be the less; if less favor, thou shall have less envy also.
Look into all these things which ^nrage us, and which we lose with many
teares^ and thou shall know that the opinion of the damage, and not the damage
it self is troublesome unto us, no man feels but apprehends that these are
lost. He that has himself has lost nothing; but how many have had the hap to
possess themselves?

EPIST. XLIII.
That he does, lies not hidden, but that rumor publishes all things.
Therefore so live (says he) as if thou liuedst in public. What if thou be
hid also? Thy mind knows and sees.

THou desire to know how these news came to mine ears, who it was that
told me that thy thought was thus, whereas thou had disclosed it to no man
living: he that knows the most, rumor. What then (say thou) am I so great
that I can excite a rumor? Thou art not to measure thy self in regard of this
place where I bide, but respect thou that wherein thou live: whatsoever is
eminent amiddest the places near unto thee, is great in that place where it is
eminent. For greatness has no certain measure; comparison either extinguisheth
or depresseth it. The Ship which is great in the River, is little in the Sea:
the helm that to one ship is great, to another is little. Now in that Province
where thou live thou art great, although thou contemnethy self. It is both
inquired of and known, both how thou suppest and how thou sleep. So much
the more ought thou to be more circumspect in thy carriage. Then judge thy
self happy when thou can live publicly, when as thy roof and walls may
cover and not hide thee; which for the most part we judge to be builded about
us, not to the intent we may live more safely, but to the end we may sin more
secretly. I will tell thee a thing by which thou may estimate our manners,
thou shall scarcely find any man that can live with an open door. Our
conscience, and not our arrogance has set a guard at our gates: so live we
that we esteem a sudden espiall to be an actual surprisall. But what
pro^iteth it a man to hide himself, and to have both the eyes and ears of
men? A good conscience challenges the whole world, an evil is always
doubtful and careful, yea even in the desert. If thine actions be honest, let
all men know them: if dishonest, what skilleth it if no man know them, so thou
know them thy self? O wretch that thou art, if thou contemnest this witness.

EPIST. XLIIII.
An excellent Epistle. Let no man contemn himself for his baseness of birth,
if he comes unto wisdom, that is, to virtue. This only enobleth.

ONce again thou playest the coward with me, and say that nature first; and
after her, fortune have been contrary and unkind toward thee, whereas thou
may exempt thy self from the common sort, and obtain the most high
felicity that may befall men. If ought else be good in Philosophy, this is
it, that it regards not Nobility or descent. If all men be revoked to their
first original they are of the gods. Thou art a Roman Knight, and to this
order thine industry has advanced thee: but undoubtedly there are diverse to
whom the fourteen degrees are closed. The Court admits not all men. The
Camp likewise cannot without trouble, make choice of those whom they
entertain for labor and travel. A good spirit and intention is open to all
men, to this we are all noble, neither does Philosophy reject or elect any
man, but shines unto all. Socrates was no Patritian: Cleanthes drew water and
employed his hands in watering his Garden. Philosophy entertained Plato, not
so thoroughly noble as she made him. And what cause have thou to despair, but
that thou may be like unto these? All these were thine ancestors, if thou
behauest thy self worthy of them and so shall thou behave and carry thy
self, if thou incontinently persuade thy self that no man can outstrip thee
in Nobility. There are before us as many as we are, and the original of all
very far surpasses our memory. Plato says that there is not any King that
is not descended of a slave, and that there is not any slave which is not
descended from Kings. All these things has long variety mingled together, and
fortune has turned topsie-turuie: Who is therefore a Gentleman? He that is
well composed by nature unto virtue. This only is to be expected, otherwise if
thou recallest me to antiquity, no man is not but from thence, before which
nothing is. From the first beginning of this world unto this day, the line of
alteration has derived us from noble to villeinies. It makes not a Nobleman
to have his Court full of smoakie Images: no man lived for our glory, neither
is that which was before us, ours. The mind makes the Nobleman, which from
how base condition soever, enobleth us to rise above fortune. Think thy self
therefore that thou art no Roman Knight, but a libertine. Thou may attain
this, that thou alone may be free amongst libertines. But how say thou,
if thou distinguish not good and evil by the peoples judgments? We must
regard, not whence they come, but whether they go. For if there be any thing
may make the life happy, it is absolutely good, because it may not be depraved
or turned into evil: what is it then wherein we err? In this, that all who
affect a happy life, take the instruments thereof for the thing it self; and
whilst they seek the same, fly the same: for whereas solid security is the
scope of a blessed life, and the unshaken confidence thereof, they gather the
causes of solicitude, and by a dangerous journey they not only bear, but draw
the burdens of life. Thus always recoyle they far from the effect of that
they seek, and the more labor they employ, the more are they entangled, and
carried backward, which happens to those that haste them in a labyrinth,
their very speed intangleth them.

EPIST. XLV.
That not many, but good books are necessary to obtain wisdom. That the
ancient vainly wrote some things superfluous, some subtly. Then against
Cauillers and mistaking of words. The matter, and the difference thereof is to
be sought for. Who is blessed, and what is truly good?

THou complainest thee of the want of books in those parts where thou bidest.
It skilleth not how many, but how good thou have, a certain reading profits,
and that which is full of variety delights. He that will attain to his
predestined scope, let him follow one way, and not wander in many, for this
is not to go, but to err. I had rather, say thou, that thou gave me
books, then counsel, and for mine own part, I am ready to send thee wholly,
if I have, and to void my whole store, and I would transport my self unto
those parts, if it were possible, and had I not a hope, that very shortly I
should accomplish and set an end to thy endeavor, I had undertaken the journey
in these mine old years, neither might Charibdis, Scylla, and this fabulous
sea affright me. I had not only sailed, but swomne over these seas, so as I
might embrace thee, and being present with thee, estimated, how much thou were
increased in thy courage. And whereas thou desire, that my books should be
sent unto thee, I esteem my self no more eloquent, for that then I would
account my self fair, if so be thou should require my picture of me. I
know that this proceeds from thy goodwill toward me, and not from thy
judgment, and that affection has entangled and deceived thee, and not thy
judgment. But whatsoever they be, see thou read them in such sort, as if as
yet thou sought the truth, but knew it not, but peremptorily sought it. For I
have not severely tied my self to any, I bear the name of no man, I ascribe
much to the judgment of great men, and challenge something to my self. For
they also le^t us not things only found by them, but also those which remain
to be found, and peradventure they had found out things necessary, had they
not sought after the superfluous. The cauillation of words, and captious
disputations, which exercise a vain brain, stole much time from them. We
weaue knots, and tie ambiguous signification to words, and then dissolve them.
Have we so much leisure? Know we now how to live, and how to die? Thither with
all our minds are we to address our selves, where provision may be taken,
that the things themselves may deceive us, and not the words. Why
distinguishest thou unto me the similitudes of words, wherewith no man is ever
caught, but when he disputes, the things themselves deceive us, discern them:
we embrace evil things in stead of good, we wish contrary to that we have
wished, our vows impugn our vows, our counsels our counsels. How much does
flattery resemble friendship? It does not only imitate the same, but it
overcomes and outstrippeth it: it is received with open and favorable ears,
and descends into the inward heart, gracious in that wherein it hurts.
Teach me how I may know this similitude. There comes unto me, in stead of a
friend, a flattering enemy. Vices creep upon us under pretext of virtues;
temeritie lies hidden under the name of fortitude: moderation is called sloth,
a wary man is accounted fearful. In those things we err with great danger;
imprint certain notes on these to make them known. But he that is demanded
whether he has horns, is not so foolish to rub his brow; neither again so
foolish and beetle-headed, that he is ignorant that he has none of those
horns, which thou would persuade him to have by a subtle collection of
arguments. But these deceive without damage; in such manner as the boxes and
lots of the Iuglers, in which the very deceit is a delight. Bring to pass that
I may understand how it is done, I have lost the use. The same say I of these
cauellings, for by what more fit name can I call Sophismes? Neither hurt they
the ignorant, neither help they the understanding: verily if thou will take
away all ambiguitie of words, teach us this, that he is not blessed whom the
common people terms so, into whose bands great sums of money are gathered;
but he, whose mind is all his goodness, who is erect, upright, high minded,
and a contemner of those things which other men wonder at, who sees no man
with whom he would exchange himself, which estimateth a man only in that part
wherein he is a man, who uses Nature as his mistress, and is composed
according to her laws, and so lives as she prescribes. From whom no force
can ravish his good, who turns evil into goodness, assured in his
judgment, unshaken, undaunted: whom some power moves, but none perturbeth;
whom Fortune, when with her greatest force, she has darted the most dangerous
dart she has against him, pricketh, but wounds not, and that very seldom.
For all other weapons of hers, wherewith she warreth against mankind, are as the
hail which falls on the houseeues, it strikes on them, without any
incommoditie to the inhabitants of the same, and makes a noice, and is
dissolved. Why detainest thou me in this, that thou call thy self
Pseudomenon, (that is to say, a liar) of whom so many books have been
written. Behold, all my life is but lying, reprove thou it, reduce this to
truth, if thou art so subtle. She judges those things necessary, the greater
part whereof is superfluous, that likewise which is not superfluous, has no
moment in it self, in this that it may make a man fortunate or blessed. For if
any thing be necessary, it is not presently good. And we prostitute goodness
and abuse it, if we attribute that name to bread and cakes, and such like
things, without which life cannot be maintained. That which is truly good is
necessary, but that which is necessary is not presently good, for some things
are necessary which are most abject. There is no man that is so ignorant of
the dignity of goodness, which comparingly will abuse it with those things
that have their lasting but for a day. What then? Will thou not employ thy
study and care to make manifest unto every man, and let them see, that with
great loss of time a man searches for superfluous and unprofitable things;
and that diverse have ouerpassed their life, in only employing themselves in
seeking out the instruments of life. Look into every particular, and consider
the whole, there is no man's life, but is aimed at to morrow. Thou ask me
what evil there is herein? Infinite, for they live not, but are to live, they
defer all things. Although we were circumspect, yet life would outstrip us,
and now when we are stayed, she comes and ouergoeth us, and is ended in the
last day, and every day perishes. But lest I should exceed the measure of an
Epistle, which should not fill a man's left hand in reading. I will defer this
debate with the ouer-subtill Logitians till another time, who only have care
of this, and not of that.

EPIST. XLVI.
He judges of LVCILIVS his Book, and praises it.

I Have received the book which thou promisedst me, and as if I should read
it over at leisure; I opened it, and had only a will to taste it. But
afterward it so flattered and toled me on, that I thought fit to pass
further, which how eloquent it is, thou may conjecture by this, it seemed
short unto me, for that neither of thy time nor of mine, but at first sight it
seemed to be either Titus Liuius, or Epicurus: but with so much sweetness it
detained and allured me, that without all delay I ouer-read it. The Sun
invited me, hunger admonished me, the shower threatened me, yet did I read it
over, not so much delighted as gladded. And I would say unto thee, what a wit
has this man? What a mind? What ability? If he had pawsed, if he had risen
by degrees. Now has it not been vehemency, but a continuate form, and a
composition masculine and holy, notwithstanding there was a mixture of
sweetness and grace. Thou art great and upright, this course I advise thee to;
so proceed thou. The matter also did somewhat, therefore is it to be chosen
fruitful, that may ravish a man's mind and excite him. I will write more of
thy book when I have reexamined it; but as yet my judgment is not settled. I
seem but as one that has heard it, and not ouer-read it. Suffer me likewise
to make inquisition. Thou need not fear, thou shall hear the truth. O
happy man that thou art, that have nothing for which a man should lie unto
thee from so far off: but that (even where the cause is taken away) we lie
for customs sake.

EPIST. XLVII.
That we ought to behave our selves, and live with our servants familiarly.
That the error of his age was, in their pride and contempt: yet that according
to each man's disposition and virtue, that the one and the other are either more
freely or severely to be handled.

I Have willingly understood by those that come from thee, that thou live
familiarly with thy slaves: this becomes thy prudence, this is answerable to
thy wisdom. Are they thy slaves? nay rather thy companions. Are they thy
slaves? nay rather thine humble friends. Are they thy slaves? nay rather thy
fellow servants. If thou know that Fortune has as much power over the one,
as over the other. I therefore laugh at those that think it an abject and base
thing to sup with their servants: and why? But for that their ouerweening
custom has environed the supping Lord with a troop of attending servants.
Far more eats he, then he digesteth, and with an excessive greedines
loadeth ^ee his distended belly, that with greater labor he may vomit up all
those things, when with surfeit he has ingested them; but his unhappy servants
have scarce leave to move their lips, no not to this end, to speak. Each
murmr is stilled by the rod, and scarce casual things escape the whip, a
cough, a sneese, a hicket; a great penalty is threatened, if by any speech a
renewed silence be interrupted: the liuelong night stand they fasting, and
wait they mute. So comes it to pass, that these speak of their Lord, who
in his presence have no liberty to discourse. But they who had not only
liberty to speak before their Masters, but to confer with them, whose mouth
was not sewed up, were ready to hazard their heads for their Masters, and
turn their imminent peril on their own necks. At the banquets they spoke,
but in their torments they were silent. Furthermore, a proverb of no less
arrogancy is published, That as many servants we have, so many enemies. We
have them not our enemies, but we make them. In the mean space, I let pass
many both cruel and inhumane things: that we abuse them not, as men only, but
as beasts. That whereas we are set at supper, one wipeth away our spittings,
and other crouching under the table, gathers the relics of the drunkards:
another cutteth up the dearest foul, and conueying his cunning ^and through
their breasts and hinder parts, in certain conceits of caruing, cut them in
pieces: unhappy he that lives to this one thing, to cut up wild foul
decently. But that he is more miserable, that for voluptuousness sake teaches
this, then he that learneth it for necessity. Another skinking the wine,
attired after woman-like fashion, strives with age: he cannot ^lie childhood,
yet is he drawn back, and now sweet faced, his hairs either shaven or
pulled up by the roots, in his martial habit attends and watches he all
night, which he divides betwixt his Lords drunkenness and lust, and in the
chamber is a man, and at the banquet a boy. Another to whom the censure of the
ghuests is permitted, attends unhappy as he is, and expects those, whom
flattery or the intemperance either of their mouths or tongues reuoaketh the
next day. Ad to these, the Caterers, who have a certain and subtle knowledge
of their Lords best liking; who know the savor of that meat, they hold best
pleasing to their appetite, what most affects their eye, what meat will
quicken their loathing stomachs, when he loatheth in his fullness, what he
longs for that very day. With these he cannot abide to sup, and thinks it a
diminution of his majesty, to sit down^ at the same table with his servant.
God forbid that of those they should find their masters. I saw Callistus master
attend at his door, and him excluded amongst many that entered, who had set
him a servile schedule on his breast to be sold, and had brought him forth to
sail amongst his most ridiculous and abject slaves. That very slave of his did
him favor, who was by him set to sail amongst the most abject first rank,
fruitlessely prostituted by the Crier, basely made vendible by the master, yea
he himself thought him unworthy of his house. The Lord sold Callistus: but how
many things did Callistus sell to his master? Will thou think, that he whom
thou termest thy slave, was borne of the same seed, enjoys the same air,
equally breaths, lives and dies as thou shall? Thou may see him as
noble, as he thee servile. How many men did Fortune depresse in the Marian
slaughter, of noble birth, and such as after being thrice Tribunes were in
election to be Senators? One of those she made a shepherd, the other the
keeper of a Cottage. Contemn not the man of that fortune; into which thou
may be transferred, whilst thou contemnest. I will not intrude my self
into a large field of discourse, and dispute of the use of servants, in respect
of whom we are most cruel, proud, and contumelious: yet is this the sum of
my precept. So live with thine inferior, as thou would thy superior should
live with thee. As often as thou bethinkest thy self what power thou have over
thy servant, b^thinke thy self that so much power thy mast^r has over thee.
But I, say thou, have no master, the better thy fortune, happily thou shall
have. Know thou not in what years Hecuba began to serve, in what time
Cr^sus, in what time Darius mother, in what time Plat^, in what time Diogenes?
Live with thy servant kindly and court^ously, vouchsafe him conference, admit
him to counsel, and conversation with thee. In this place the whole troop of
these nice companions will cry out at me: There is nothing more base, nothing
more abject then this is. These very same men will I find kissing the hand of
other men's slaves. See you not, that likewise how by this means our ancestors
withdrew all envy from the masters, all con^umely from the servants? They
called the master the father of the household, the servants (which as yet
continues amongst the Mimicks) his familiars. They instituted a holy day,
wherein not only the masters feasted with their servants, but wherein beside
that, they permitted them to bear^ honor in their house, and to give sentence
and judgment, their house to be a little commonweal. What then? Shall I set
all my servants at my table? No more then all my children. Thou errest, if thou
think that I will reject some of them as destinated to a more servile
office, as that Muliter, and that Cow keeper, I will not measure them by their
offices, but by their manners. Each one gives himself manners, casualtie
assigns him ministeries. Let some of them sup with thee, because they are
worthy, some that they may be worthy. For if any thing be servile in them by
reason of their sordid conversation, their living and conuersing with those
that are better nurtured will shake it off. Thou art not, my Lucilius, only to
seek thy friend in the Marketplace, and in the Court, if thou diligently
attend, thou shall find him in thy house also. Oftentimes a good matter
cease without the workman; try and make experiment. Even as he is a fool,
who having a horse to buy, looks not on him, but on his furniture and bit; so
is he most fond, that esteems a man, either by his garment, or by his
condition, which is wrapped about us after the manner of a garment. Is he a
servant? But happily a free man in mind. Is he a servant? Shall this hurt him?
Show one that is not. One serves his lust, another his avarice, another
ambition, another fear. I will show you a man that has been Consul, serving
an old woman. I will let you see a rich man serving a poor maid: I will show
you the noblest young men, the very bond-slaues of Players. There is no
servitude more foul, then that which is voluntary. For which cause, thou have
no reason that these disdainful fellows should deter thee from showing thy
self affable to thy servants, and not proudly superior. Let them rather
honor thee, then fear thee. Will any man say that I call servants to
liberty, and cast down masters from their dignity, in that I say they should
rather honor their master then fear him? Is it so, says he, shall they wholly
honor thee as clients and saviors? He that says thus, forgets that that is
very small to masters, which is enough for God, who is worshipped and loved.
Love cannot be mingled with fear. I therefore think, that thou do most
uprightly; if thou will not be feared by thy ^eruants, that thou use the
chastisement of words. Such as are dumb are admonished by stripes: every thing
that offends us, hurts us not. But daintiness compels us to outrage, so
that whatsoever is not answerable to our will, provoke us to wrath. We put
upon us the minds of Kings, for they also forgetful of their own strength,
and other men's imbecilitie are so incensed, so wrathful, as if they had
received an injury, from the peril of which thing, the greatness of their
fortune secureth them most; neither are they ignorant hereof, but they take
occasion of hurting by seeking it; they received an injury, that they might
do wrong. I will not detain thee longer, for thou have no need of
exhortation. Good manners have this amongst other things, they ple^se
themselves and remain. Malice is light, and is often changed, not to the
better, but to another thing.

EPIST. XLVIII.
That the same things are expedient for friends, and that the one is profitable
to the other. Then against captious cauils and difficult follies. What do you?
What play you? The question is of life. Assist and form it. Of fortune.
Against her give defense.

TO that Epistle of thine, which thou sendest to me in my journey, so long as
the very journey it self was, I will make answer. I must recreat my self, and
look about me what I counsel. For thou also who counsellest me, did
bethink thee long, whether thou should counsel; how much more ought I to
do the like, whereas a longer respite is requisite to dissolve and answer thee,
to propound the question: verily one course is expedient for thee, another for
me: once more speak I like Epicurus. But to me the same is expedient that to
thee, else am I not thy friend, except whatsoever is done that concerns thee,
be mine. Friendship makes a mutual interchange of all things between us,
neither has any one of us in particular a felicity or adversity, but they
are communicable to both. Neither can any man live happily who only respects
himself, that conuerteth all things to his own pro^its: thou must live unto
another, if thou will live unto thy self. This society both diligently and
holily is to be obserued^ which mixeth all of us together, and judges that
there is some one common right of humane race. It avails very much also to
perfect that interior society of friendship, of which I spoke. For he shall
have all things in common with his friend, that has many things common with
man. This would I have taught me, O Lucilius, the best of men, by those subtle
Sophisters, what I ought to perform unto my friend, what unto a man: then
after how many manners a friend may be called, and how many this word man
signifies. Behold wisdom, and folly are separated diversely, to which do I
incline? to which part willest thou me to go? To this Stoicke a man is a
friend, to that Epicure a friend is not for a man: he gets a friend for
himself, this other himself for a friend. Thou wrestest my words, and
distinguishest syllables. Verily except I compose idle Interrogations, and by a
false conclusion derived from truth, I unite a lie, I cannot distinguish those
things that are to be desired from such as are to be eschued. I am ashamed. In
so serious a thing as this is, though old, yet we trifle. Mouse is a syllable^
but Mouse gnaweth the Cheese, Ergo, a syllable gnaweth the Cheese. Think now
that I cannot resolve this doubt, what damage should this ignorance of mine do
me? What discommoditie? Doubtless it is to be feared, lest at sometimes I
should catch the syllables in my Mous-trap, or that happily if I should become
negligent, my Book should eat the Cheese: unless happily that collection is
more acute; Mouse is a syllable, but the syllable gnaweth not the Cheese; the
Mouse therefore gnaweth not the Cheese. O childish triflings. For this cause
have we humbled our brows? For this cause have we lengthened our beards? Is
it this we teach both sad and pale? Will thou know what Philosophy promises
to humane kind? It is counsel. One man death calls, another poverty
burns, another man either his own or other men's riches torment; this man is
affraide and terrified at evil fortune, that man would withdraw himself, and
escape his felicity, this man disliketh men, that man the gods: Why
proposest thou unto me these toys? There is no place of jesting; the miserable
cra^e thy assistance. Thou have promised that thou will help such as are
ship-wrackt, captive, poor, such as subject their heads to axe and block:
whether art thou diuerted? what do thou? The very man with whom thou jestest
is affraide. Yield succors, whatsoever thou art more endued with eloquence, to
the pains of such as perish. All of them, on every side lift up their hands
unto thee, and implore some help in their perished and decaying life, in thee is
the hope, in thee the means. They beseech thee to draw them out of so great
turmoyle, that thou would show them that are scattered and wandering the
cl^ere light of truth. Show what nature has made necessary, what superfluous,
what easy laws she has established: how pleasant and expedite the life of
those men is that follow them, how bitter and implicit theirs is, that have
believed opinion more then truth. What extinguisheth these men's desires? What
temperateth them? Would to God they did but only not profit. They hurt. This
will I make manifest unto thee when thou will, that a generous spirit is broken
and weakened, being puzzled with these subtilties. I am ashamed to tell, what
weapons it lends to those, that are to war against fortune, and how they
suborne them. This is the way to the chiefest good, by this Philosophical
exceptions are black, filthy, and infamous, yea even to those that are young
Students: for what else do you, when as wittingly you entangle him whom you
ask, then that he might seem to be nonsuited: but even as the Praetor wholly
restores the one, so does Philosophy these. Why fail you in your great
promises? and having promised mount^ines, that you will bring to pass that the
shining and brightness of gold shall no more dazzle mine eyes, then that of the
sword: that with great constancy I should contemn and spurn at, both that
which all men wish, and that which all men fear, descend you to the elements
of the Grammarian? What say you, is this the way to eternity? For this is it
that Philosophy promises me, to make me like to God. To this I am invited, to
this end I came, perform thy promise. As much as thou may therefore my
Lucilius, reduce thy self from these exceptions and prescriptions of the
Philosophers. Open and simple things become honesty and goodness. Although a
better part of life were yet to be spent, yet must it now be sparingly
dispensed, that it may suffice for necessaries; now what madness is it to
learn such unnecessary things in so great scantling of time?

EPIST. XLIX.
That by the sight of a house called POMPEY the memory of his LVCILIVS was
renewed in him. Of the shortness and swiftness of time, that nothing is long
or old in it. By the way against the Logicians, and that all that sort are
only to be looked on.

He truly my Lucilius, is idle and negligent, who admonished from any Region
is reduced to the memory of his friend; yet sometimes familiar places summon
and call forth the reposed desire in our mind, neither suffer they the memory
to be extinguished, but provoke the same when it is pacified, even as the
grief of those that mourn, although for a time it be mitigated, either the
familier admission of a servant, or a garment, or the house renews the same.
Behold how Campania, and in especial Naples, in the beholding of thy Pompeis it
is incredible how living a memory of thee it bred in me. Thou art wholly
before mine eyes, even then when I am most separated from thee. I see thee
supping up thy tears, and insufficiently resisting thy affections, breaking
forth in their restraint. And now seem I to have lost thee; for what is not
present, if thou remembrest? Not long since I conuersed being a child, with
Sotion the Philosopher; anon after I began to plead causes; not long after I
desisted from being willing to wrangle in them: now give I over to have power
to follow them. Infinite is the swiftness of time, which appears most to
those that look back: for to those that intend the present, it deceives
them, so light is the passage of her h^adlong flight. Do thou demand the
cause hereof? Whatsoever time is past is in the same place, it is beheld at
once, and at once is extinguished, and all things from thence fall into the
depth, and otherwise there cannot be long spaces in that thing which is wholly
shor^. It is but a point that we live, and as yet less then a point; yet
nature has divided this least under a certain kind of longer space. Of this
point he made one part infancy, another childe-hood, an other youth, another a
certain inclination from youth to age, another age it self. In how small a
straight has he placed so many degrees? Even presently doe^ I prosecute thee,
and yet this present is a good portion of our age; whose shortness let us
think on, will at last show it self. The time was not wont to seem so swift
unto me: now does the course thereof appear incredible, either because I
perceive the end at hand, either because I have begun to conceive and sum
up my loss. And the more am I vexed, because I see some lavish the greater
part of this time in vanities, which scarcely can suffice for necessaries,
although it were kept very diligently. Cicero denies that if his age were
doubled, he should have time enough to read the Liriques; and in like sort the
Logicians. They are bitterly foolish. These play the professed wantons: they
think that they do somewhat. Neither deny I but these may be looked into,
but that they are only to be looked into, and slightly ouer-past, to this only
intent, lest we should be deceived, and that we should judge that there is some
great and secret good in them. Why do thou torment and macerate thy self
about that question, which is more policy to contemn then satisfy? It is the
work of a secure man, and such a one as erreth from his profit to make search
after trifles. When the enemy is hard at our heels, and the soldier is
commanded to martch, necessity shakes off all that which idle peace had
recollected. I have no leisure to affect these equiuocating words, and make
trial of my craft in them. Behold what armies martch, what walls,
What war with clo^sed gates.
This noise of war sounding on every side, is to be heard by me with a
mighty courage. I should worthily be accounted mad in all men's eyes^ of when
as both old men and women gathered and brought stones to fortify the Rampire,
when as the young men being armed within the gates, expected or required a
s^mmons to sally, when the enemies arms were at the ports, and the very ground
did shake with mines, if I should sit idle and employ my time in such like
questions. That which thou have not lost thou have; thou have not lost thy
horns, Ergo, thou have horns, and such like, fashioned according to the tenor
of this acute madness. And no less foolish should I seem unto thee, if I
should employ my studies in these, whereas even now I am beleagred^ yet then a
foreign peril should threaten me being besieged, the wall should sever me from
mine enemy. Now death and danger is with me. Now have I time for these toys.
There is a weighty business in hand. What shall I do? Death follows me,
life flies. Teach me somewhat against these, bring to pass that I may not
fly death and that life may not fli^ me. Teach me equanimitie against
disasters, and distress against inevitable harms, give liberty to the
straightness of my time. Teach me that the good of life consist^th not in the
space thereof, but in the use; and that it may be, yea, that it often falls
out, that he who has lived longest has lived a little or nothing. Tell me
when I lie down to rest^ it may be thou shall not wake. Tell me when I am
awake, it may be thou shall not sleep any more. Tell me when I go forth of
doors it may be thou can not return: Tell me when I return, it may b^ thou
can not go out again. Tho^ art deceived, if thou think that in sailing
only, that there is but the least difference and separation twixt life and
death^ in every place there is as little distance. Every where death shows not
himself so nigh, yet every where is he as nigh. Shake off these clouds, and
thou shall more easily discover those things, to which I am prepared. Nature
bred us docible, and gave us imperfect reason, yet such as may be perfected.
Dispute with me of Justice and piety, of frugalitie, of both sorts of
modesty, and of that that can abstain from another body, and this that has
care of his own: if thou will not lead me the indirect way, I shall more
easily attain to that I affect. For as that tragic Poet says, The speech of
truth is simple: and therefore we must not implicate the same: for nothing is
less convenient then is this subtle craft, to those minds that labor after
great mattters.

EPIST. L.
That we are blind in vices, or that we seek a cloak for them. Yet that they
are to be acknowledged, and that the remedies are to be sought for; whence
otherwise is the health of the mind derived, which may likewise happen, even
to the most inueterate vices, because he is easy to be bent, and Nature flies
unto goodness.

I Received the Epistle which thou sentest me after many months. I thought it
therefore an idle thing to enquire of him that brought the same, what thou
did. For it is a sign of a good memory, if he remembers, and yet hope I
that for the present thou live so, that wheresoever thou art, I know what
thou did. For what other thing should thou do, then that daily thou
should better thy self, that thou should lay aside some one of thine
errors, that thou may understand that they are thine own follies, that thou
think to be foreign. Some things ascribe we to places and times, but they,
whither soever we transport our selves, will follow us. Thou know,
Harpaste, my wives fool, thou know that she remained in my house as an
hereditarie burden. For I am much distasted and disgusted with those
prodigi^s, if at any time I will take pleasure in a fool. I need not seek
far off, I find sufficient matter of laughter in my self. This fool
suddenly lost her eyesight. I tell thee an incredible matter, but yet true:
she knows not that she is blind; oftentimes she prays her governor to
give her leave to walk abroad, she says the house is dark. This that
seems ridiculous unto us in her, take thou notice, that it happens unto us
all: no man understands that he is covetous, no man that he is auaritious;
yet do the blind seek a guide, but we err without a guide, and say: I am
not ambitious, but no man can otherwise live in Rome. I am not sumptuous, but
the City it self requires great expense. It is not my fault that I am
wrathful, that as yet I have not settled my self in a certain course of life;
it is youth that causes this: Why deceive we our s^lues? our evil is not
extrinsecall, it is within us, and is settled in our intrailes. And therefore
do we hardly recover health, because we know not that we are sick; if we
have but begun our cure, when shall we shake off so many plagues and
sicknesses? But now scarce seek we for the Physician, who should spend less
time and labor, if he were counseled upon the beginning of the disease.
Tender and rude minds would follow him, directing them aright. No man is hardly
reduced unto Nature, but he that has revolted from her. We are ashamed to
learn a good mind, yet undoubtedly it is a shameful thing to seek a master in
this matter. That is to be dispaired, that so much good may casually befall us:
we must take pains, and (to speak uprightly) the labor is not great: if, as
I said, we begin to conform and recorrect our minds, before they be confirmed
in wickedness. Yet despair I not of those that are indurate. There is nothing
that industrious labor and intent, and diligent care cannot compass and
impugn. Thou may straighten the stiffest oaks, although crooked; heat
straightneth crooked beams, and such as are otherwise fashioned by Nature, are
applied to that which our use exacteth. How far more easily ^oth the mind
receive a form, being flexible and pliant to any humor. For what other thing
is the mind, then after a certain manner a spirit. But you see that a spirit
is by so much more facile then any other matter, by how much he is more thin
and delicate. That, my Lucilius, has no reason to hinder thee from hoping well
of us, because malice already has hold of us, that of long time it has
harbored with us. To no man comes a good mind before an evil. We are all
preoccupated in learning virtues, and forgetting vices: but therefore the more
ardently must we endeavor our amendment, because the possession of a good once
imparted to us, is perpetual; virtue is not forgotten. For the contrary evils
have a foreign dependence, and therefore may be expelled and excluded, they
are surely settled that succeed in their place. Virtue is according to Nature,
vices are our enemies and infectors. But even as received virtues cannot easily
be dispossessed, and their conservation is easy: so is the beginning to
obtain and aim at them very difficult, because this especially is the sign
of a weak and sick mind, to fear things unattempted. Therefore is the mind
to be enforced, that it may begin: moreover the medicine is not bitter, for it
quickly delights, while it heals. Of other remedies, there is a certain
pleasure after health: Philosophy is both wholesome and pleasing.

EPIST. LI.
Somewhat of Etna, and more of Baiae. And upon this occasion he inueyeth
against such as are effeminated, and given over to their pleasure. That this is
to be driven from us, and that we are to warfare: against whom? against
Pleasure, Pain, and others. That he who does so, does good in serious and holy
places, auoideth lascivious things, or such as are too delightful.

EVen as every one can, my Lucilius, thou have there Etna that noble Mountain
of Sicily, the which Messala called the only Mountain, or Valgius (for in both
of them have I read thereof) why I find not, when as many places vomit out
fire, not only such as are high, which oftentimes happens, because that fire
mounteth upwards, but also such as are low. We, howsoever we may, are content
with Baye, which the very next day after I had visited, I forsook; a place for
this cause to be avoided, although that has certain natural endowments,
because superfluity has made choice thereof her self, to celebrate the same.
What then? Is there any place to be hated? No, but even as some garment is more
decent and comely for a wise and good man, then another; neither hates he any
color, but thinks one more fit for him that professes frugalitie: so is
there a region, which a wise man, or one that tends to wisdom, declineth, as
if estranged from good manners. Thinking therefore of his retirement, he will
never make choice of Canopus, although Canopus hinder no man from being
frugall. Neither Baias likewise; they are begun to be the hostrie of vices.
There Luxury permits her self very much, there as if a certain liberty
were due unto the place that has looseness. It behooves us to choose a place,
not only healthful for our bodies, but for our manners. Even as I would not
dwell amongst hangmen and torturers, so would I not live amongst
victualing-houses. What needs it to see drunkards reeling up and down the
shore, and the banquets of such as sail, and the Lakes reeccoing the Consent
of songs, and other things, which lasciviousness (as if freed from all
restraint) not only sins in, but publishes? That ought we to do, that we
fly far from the prouocations of vices. The mind is to be confirmed, and
abstracted far from the allurement of pleasures. One only Winter weakened
Hannibal, and the delicacies of Campania weakened that man, whom neither Snowes
nor Alps could otherwise vanquish: he conquered in arms, he was conquered by
vices. We must likewise play the soldiers, and in such a kind of service as
never affords us rest, or ever gives us leisure. Vices in especial are to
be conquered, which (as you see) have drawn the sternest and cruellest wits
unto them. If a man propose unto him self, what a task he has undergone, he
shall know that nothing is to be done delicately or effeminately. What have I
to do with those hot pooles, with those stoues in which a dry vapor is
included to waste our bodies? Let all swet break forth by labor: if we
should do as Hannibal did, that interrupting the course of affairs, and
neglecting war, we should employ our selves in nourishing our bodies, there
is no man but might justly reprehend our unseasonable sloth, not only
dangerous for the conqueror, but for the conquered also? Less is permitted
us, then those that followed the Carthaginian wars, more danger impendeth
over our heads, if we give way, worse also if we persevere. Fortune wageth
war with me, I will not obey her, I receive not her yoke, nay more, (which
with greater courage I ought to accomplish) I shake it off. The mind is not to
be mollified. If I give place to pleasure, I must be subject to grief, slave
to labor, servant to poverty; both ambition and wrath will have the same
privilege over me: amongst so many vices I shall be distracted, or rather
dismembered. Liberty is proposed: for this reward do we labor. Thou ask me
what liberty is? To serve nothing, no necessity, no fortunes; to keep
Fortune at staffes-end. That day I understand my self, that I can more then
she may; she can nothing. Shall I suffer her when as death is at hand? To him
that intends these thoughts, retirement both serious and sanctified, ought to
be sought for and chosen. Too much pleasantnes effeminateth the mind, and
undoubtedly the contrary may do somewhat to corrupt the vigor. Those cattle
easily travel in any way, whose hoofes are hardened on the craggie ways: such
as breed in the rotten and soggie pastures, are quickly wearied. The soldier
exercised on the mountains, returns more hardy, the citizen and homebred
is recreant. Those hands refuse no labor that are transferred from the plough
to the pike. The anointed and nice soldier endures not the first shock. The
seuerer discipline of the place firmeth the courage, and makes it more apt to
attempts. Scipio was more honestly a banished man at Liternum then at Bayas.
His ruin is not to be planted in so effeminate a place. And they also to whom
at first, and in especial the fortune of the Roman people translated the
public Riches, Caius Marius, Cneius Pompey, and Caesar builded certain
Manor-houses in the region of Bayas, but they planted them on the tops of the
highest mountains. This seemed more warlike, from an eminent place to behold
the low country far and near. Behold what situation they chose, in what
places, and what they builded; and thou shall know that they were in camping
places, and not in houses of pleasure. Think thou Cato would ever dwell in
Vtica, to the end he might number the adulterers that saild by him, and to
behold so many kinds of boats painted with diverse colors, and the roses
s]floating over the whole lake, that he might hear the night-brawles of such
as sing? Had he not rather been within his Trench, which in one nights space
he had dug, and caused to be enclosed, why should it not better please him?
Whosoever is a man had rather be awakened from sleep by the Trumpet, then a
melody or consent of voices. But long enough have we contended about Baias,
but never enough with vices, which I beseech thee my Lucilius, persecute beyond
measure, and without end; for neither have they end or measure. Cast from thee
whatsoever tormenteth thy heart, which if they could not be drawn out
otherwise, thy heart were to be pulled out with them. Especially drive from
thee pleasures, and hold them in greatest hatred, after the manner of those
thieves whom the Egyptians call Philetae; to this end they kiss us, that they
may kill us.

EPIST. LII.
That we are uncertain in the truth, and have need of help and direction.
But that some are more easily guided and formed; then other some according to
their nature. But to the intent that thou may be formed, make thy choice out
of the ancient, and the present. Yet fly pratlers, ambitious, and such as
affect applause.

WHat is this Lucilius, that, when we intend one way, draws us another, and
forces us thither, from whence we desire to fly? What is that which wrastleth
with our mind, and permits us not to will any thing once? We waver twixt
diverse counsels, we will nothing freely, nothing absolutely, nothing always.
It is a folly (say thou) he that is constant in nothing, is not long pleased
with any thing. But how, or when shall we withdraw our selves from these? No
man is able to accomplish it of him self; some man must lend a helping hand,
some one must bring us out. Some, says Epicurus, contend unto truth without
any man's help, of these, that he made himself his own way. These prayseth
he most: that had power of themselves, that advanced themselves: that some
want foreign ^elpe, and are not like to go, except some one conduct them,
yet are willing to follow. Of this sort he accounts Me^rodorus. And this also
is an excellent, but a wit of the second rank. We are not of the first
number, it suffices us if we be received into this secone rank: neither
contemn thou that man that may be saved by another man's means; for it is a
very great matter to have a will to be saved. Besides these, as yet thou shall
find another sort of men, and they not to be contemned, namely, they that may
be enforced and compelled to the right, who have not only need of a guide
but a helper, or to speak more properly, a compeller. This is the third kind.
If thou seek an example hereof; Epicurus says that Hermachus was such a one,
therefore gratulateth he more the one, and admireth the other. For although
both of them obtained one and the same end, yet the praise is greater, to have
performed the same in a more difficult matter. Suppose that a man has builded
two houses, both equal, a like high and magnificent, the one of them planted
on a firm foundation, whereon the work is suddenly raised, the other on an
uncertain and falls ground, where we ought to dig deep, and employ infinite
pains before we light on firm land. In the one all appears in sight, that
has been builded: in the other the better and more dificult part is hidden.
Some wits are facile and expedite, some are (as they say) to be fashioned by
the hand, and to be exercised and occupied in making their own foundation:
therefore account I him more happy, that has had no business with himself,
and him likewise to have deserved best of himself, that has overcome the
malignitie of his nature, and has not led him self, but forcibly drawn
himself to wisdom. Thou must know that this hard and troublesome travel is
forced on us. We travel a way full of dangers: let us therefore combat and
call for assistance. Whom say thou shall I call upon, that or this man? For
thine own part, I counsel thee to return unto the first, that have now no
more to do: for not only they of this time, but those that have been our
predecessors may assist us. And amongst those that live, let us choose, not them
that divide and precipitate many words with great volubilitie, and turn over
common places, and that in private are most courted: but those whose lives are
our instructions, who when they have told us what is to be done, approve the
same by their actions who teach that which is to be eschued, and are never
surprised or found guilty in doing that, which they have forbidden to be done.
Choose him for thine assistant, whom thou admirest more when thou see him,
then when thou hear him: neither therefore forbid I thee to hear them
likewise, whose custom it is to admit the people, and to dispute, if so be they
expose themselves to community to this intent, that they may amend themselves
and make others the better, provided they exercise not this for ambition sake.
For what is more base then Philosophy, that searches the favors and
acclamations of the people? Does the sick man praise the Physician that
launceth him? Be silent, favor and offer your selves to the cure. Although you
yield me acclamations of honor, I will not otherwise hear you, except you sigh
at the touch of your sins. Will you have it testified, that you are attentive,
and are moved with the greatness of things? You have free liberty; why should
I not permit you to judge, and give your voice to that which you think best?
Under Pythagoras, his scholars remained five years without speaking: think
thou that it was lawful for them incontinently to speak and praise? But how
great is his folly, whom the applauses of the ignorant dismiss with
ioyf^lnesse out of the auditorie? Why art thou glad, because thou art praised
by those men, whom thou thy self can not praise? Fabianus declaymed before
the people, but he was heard with modesty. Sometime a great acclamation was
raised of those that praised him; but such as the greatness of the things
provoked, and not the sound of a discourse smoothed and fluent. There is some
difference betwixt the applause of a Theater, and of the Schools. There is
some liberty also in praising. There are always some marks and signs of
those things that are discovered. And a man may likewise gather an argument of
another manners, even in the slightest things. The gate, the carriage of the
hand, and sometimes one only answer, or the finger dallying with the head, or
the bent of the eye discovers the impudency of a man. A man knows a wicked
man by his laughter, and a mad man by his countenance and habit. For th^se
things are outwardly showed by certain signs. Thou shall know what every one
is^ if thou consider how he is praised. On every side the auditor applaudeth
the Philosopher with his clapping, and all this troop that admireth him,
sits above his head; now is not this man praised, if thou understand it,
but whooted at. Let these applauses be reserved to those arts that have a
purpose to please the people, let Philosophy be adored. A man may give
sometimes leave to young men to use this heat of spirit, but they will do
this out of violence, when they cannot command themselves silence. This manner
of praise serves sometimes for some exhortation to the auditors, and animateth
the minds of young men. But better were it they should be moved with matter,
then with painted words. Otherwise eloquence would but endanger them, if it
should rather procure a desire of it self then of matter. I will speak no
more for the present: for it desires a proper and long discourse and
execution, to know how a matter is to be handled before the people, what is
permitted him by them, what them by him. It is not to be doubted, but that
Philosophy has lost much after it is prostituted, but she may be showed in
her most retired abode, if one day she find not a Merchant banckier, but some
honest Prelate.

EPIST. LIII.
He describes his Navigations and tossing on the Seas, by occasion that we are
tossed in our lives, but that very few know and confess their own ^aults.
Philosophy will teach and excite. Let us give our selves unto it, she will
make us equal with God.

WHat cannot I be persuaded unto, who have been persuaded to sail? I set
sail in a calm Sea, yet undoubtedly the sky was ouer-charged with dark
clouds, which for the most part either are resolved into water, or into wind.
But I thought that so few miles betwixt thy Parthenope to Puteoli might easily
and quickly be cut over, although the sky were doubtful and dangerous. To the
end therefore that I might more swiftly finish my iourny, I put out forthwith to
sea, and shaped my course for Nesida, without bearing by the creeks: when I had
passed so far already, that I cared not whether I went forward or returned;
first, that equality of heaven that persuaded me to sail, was ouer-blowne; as
yet it was no tempest, yet begun the Sea to rise, and the surges to swell and
beat one another. Then began I to require the Master to set me on some shore.
But he told me, that the shoars of the sea were dangerous, and unfit to land
at, and that he feared nothing more in a tempest then to bear up for land, yet
was I so tormented that I remembered not my self of any danger: for a certain
languishing desire to vomit, that provoked but prevailed me nothing in emptying
my stomach: it pained me infinitely, which stirred but voyded not choler. I
therefore importuned the Master so, that will he nill he, I compelled him to
bear for the shore; whereto when we somewhat neered, I expect not to do any
thing that Virgil commands, that the Prow of the Ship should be turned
toward the Sea, or that the Anchor should be let slip into the Sea; but
remembering my self of that I was accustomed to do, I cast my self into the
water, covered in a Velvet mantle, as they are wont who wash themselves in
cold water. What think thou I suffered, whilst I strive to escape these
perrils, whilst I seek, whilst I make a way through these dangers? I know well,
not without cause, that Mariners feared the land. They are incredible things
that I suffered, considering that I could not support my self. Learn this of
me, that the Sea was not so incensed at the birth of Ulysses, that it should
cause ship-wracke in all places. He vomited easily. For mine own part I had
rather remain twenty yeare^ upon my way, then pass by Sea to any place. As
soon as I had recovered my stomach (for thou know well that in leaving the
Sea a man loses not his desire to vomit) and for my recreation had anointed
my bodi^, I began to bethink my self, how great forgetfulness of our sins
followed us, not only of vices, which because they are more great, keep
themselves hidden, but also of the vices of the body, which at all times draw
us into remembrance of them. A light alteration may well deceive some one man;
but when it is augmented and grows to be a burning fever, it causes the most
strong and endurate perforce to confess the same. Our feet grieve us, the
joints feel some little shootings; we dissemble as yet, and say that it is
some strain, or that we have freed our selves too much in doing some exercise.
We are much troubled what to call our infirmity, which is not as yet known,
but when it begins to swell up our anckles, we are enforced to say it is the
gout. It falls out far otherwise in regard of those sickenesses which
seize our souls. For the more that any, one is sick, the less sensible is he
of the same. Thou must not wonder dear Lucilius hereat: for he that slumbreth
slightly, and dreameth in some sort during his repose: sometimes in his
sleeping thinks that he sleeps; but a profound sleep extingu^sheth dreams
also, and drowneth the mind more deeply, then that it permits the same to
make use of any her intellectiue faculties. Why does no man confess his
faults? Because he is as yet plunged in the same. It is the part of one that is
a wake to show his dream, and it is a sign of amends for a man to confess
his faults. Let us awake therefore, to the end we may blame and correct our
errors. But only Philosophy must quicken us, she only must shake o^f our
heavy sleep. To her only dedicat^ thy self, thou art worthy of her and she
worthy of thee, embrace and lusten on another, deny thy self constantly and
openly to all other things. Thou can not Philosophy without taking some
pains: if thou were sick thou would give over the care of thy whole
family, and neglect thy foreign business; there is no friend so dear unto
thee, whose cause thou would desire to plead. All thy care and cost should
be to recover thy health speedily. What then, will thou not now do the like?
Lay aside all impedim^nts, and think on nothing, but how to make thy soul
more perfect, no man comes unto her that is occupied or distracted.
Philosophy uses sovereign power as a King, she gives time, and takes it
not: she is no secondarie care, but will be served seriously; she is a
Mistress; she is present and commands. Alexander to whom a City promised to
give a part of their lands, and the half of all their goods: I am come, says
he, into Asia with this resolution, not to take that which you will give me,
but that you should enjoy nothing else, but what I leave you. Philosophy uses
the like authority in all things. I will not, says she, accept that time
that you have to come, or have reserved contrariwise: you shall have none, but
which I will give you. Address thy whole mind unto her, be always near unto
her, give her all the honor thou can; there will be a great difference
betwixt thee and others. Thou shall far exceed all mortal men, and the gods
shall but very little surpass thee. Will thou know what difference there is
betwixt them and thee? They shall continue more long. But truly it is the
honor of a good worke-man to finish his task speedily. A wiseman is as
content with the space of his life, This accord^n^ to ^he proud doctrine o^
Sto^^ks^ (...).
as God is of all the time of his eternity. Some thing there is wherein a
wiseman exceeds God; God is not wise but by the goodness of his nature, and
the wiseman is by his own. It is a marvelous thing to have the frailty of a
man and the security of a God. Incredible is the force of Philosophy, to
repel all the forces of fortune. There are some sorts of arms that can
conquer her. She is covered with thick and massiue armor, she wearieth some
things that combat her, and like light darts, receives them with her open
breast, some she shakes off, and darteth them back on him that cast the same.

EPIST. LIIII.
That he was troubled with often sighing, and thereupon thought on death. That
it is not to be feared, because that we shall be the same after death, that we
were before. Let us be prepared.

MY sickness, that had given me a long truce and intermission, suddenly
invaded me. After what manner, say thou? Truly thou have reason to ask
me, for there is not any one sort, but that I have been sensible of it: yet
am I, as it were, destituted to one sickness, which why I call by the Greek
name I know not, for it may aptly enough be called a sickness. It continues a
very little time in his violence; which is like unto a gust, and passes away
almost in an hour. For who is he that continues long time a dying? All the
dangers and sicknesses that may travel a body, have passed by me, no one of
them seems more troublesome unto me: and why? For in all other evils
whatsoever, a man is but sick, but this is death it self. And therefore the
Physicians call it the meditation of death. The shortness of breath will at
length effect that, which it has often endeavored to do. Think thou that I
write this unto thee with great joy, because I have escaped? If to this end
that I took delight to be in health, I do as ridiculously as ^e, that
thinks himself dismissed of the suite, when he has deferred his putting in
bail to the actio^: yet in the very suffocation intermitted, I cease not to
comfort my self with some pleasing and confident cogitations: What is this
(say I?) Does death come so often to assail me? Let him do it hardly. For
mine own part, it is a long time I have proved it. When was it (say thou?)
Before I was borne, it is a death not to be that it was bebefore. I know
already what thing it is, that shall be after my death, which was before my
birth: if a man feel any torment therein, it must needs follow, that we had
some sense thereof before we came into this world; but then felt I no vexation.
I pray you, should he not be a great fool, that should think that a candle were
more unhappy after it were extinguished, the^ before that it was light? So
faireth it with us, we are lightened, and extinguished; betwixt both these times
we suffer some things. But before and after is a certain and profound
assurance of our evils. For in this, my Lucilius, we err, except I be
deceived, in that we judge death to follow; where is it goes before, and is like
to follow. Whatsoever was before us, is death? For what difference is there
whether thou beginnest not, or whether thou endest; the effect of both these is
not to be. With these and such like silent exhortations (for speak I might
not) I ceased not to talk unto my self, at length by little and little, this
sighing which began already to return to be a breathing, took more long
pauses, and having more liberty, kept his accustomed tune and proportion.
Neither as yet, although the fit be c^ased, has my breath his natural course.
I feel a certain touch and hanging on thereof. Let him do what he will,
provided that I sigh not in my soul; assure thy self thus much of me, that
when I shall find my self at the last gasp, I will not be astonished. I am
already resolved, I care not when the day comes. Praise and imitate him that
is not aggrieued to die, when as he has the greatest occasion to reap the
pleasures of life. For what virtue is it to issue out, then, when thou art cast
out? yet is there a virtue herein. True it is, that I am driven out, but so it
is as if I issued voluntarily. And therefore a wise man is never driven out;
for to be driven out, is to to be cast out of a place in spite of a man's
teeth: but a wise man does never any thing perforce, he flies necessity,
because he wills that which she may constrain.

Of the Manor-house of VATIA, and of VATIA himself. Then of good and evil
Leisure. Likewise that friends may and ought to be present in mind.

WHen I return hence from my carriage and exercise in my chair, I am for the
most part no less weary, then if I had walked so long time, as I was sitting:
for it is a labor to be long time carried, and I know not whether in that it
be more great, because it is against Nature, which gave us fe^te, that we might
walk by our selves, eyes, that we might see by our selves. Daintiness has
caused this infirmity in us, and that which we would not, long time we have
desisted to be able to do: yet had I need to travel my body, and to do
exercise, to the end, that if I had either choler stayed in my throat, I might
discuss the same, or if my breath by any cause were grown short, I might
extenuate the same by this agitation, which I have known to have done me much
good: and therefore caused I my self to be carried more long time, for the
pleasure that I took upon the shore, which shoots out a certain abutment
or bowing land, betwixt the town of Cumae and Seruitius Vatia his Lordship,
enclosed as a strait passage between the sea, which is on the one side, and
the lake which is on the other, because at that time it was more hard and more
thick, by reason of the tempest which had reigned a little before. And as thou
know when the billows of the raging ^louds cover the same very often, the
sands become more full and unite, but a long calmie time causes them to
relent, and divides the sand which was hardened by the water, after the humor
has been wholly dried: yet according to my custom I began to look about me,
if I could find any thing in that place that might breed me any profit, and I
addressed my sight upon a country house which had in times past pertained to
Vatia. There it was, where that rich man, who in times past had been Pretor^
and had never been known by any other means, but for retiring him self
thither, spent his later years, and was for this cause reputed happy. For as
often as Asinius Gallus friendship, as often as Seianus hatred or favor had
drowned some men, (for it was as dangerous to have offended him, as to have
loved him) all men cried out, O Vatia, thou art the only man that know how
to live; and yet he knew but how to hide himself, but not to live. Truly
there is a great difference, whether thy life be idle or slothful. I never
passed by this house of Vatia, but that I said Vatia is enterred here. But
Philosophy, my Lucilius, is a thing so sacred and venerable, that if there be
any thing that resembles it, it pleases in the delusion. For the common sort
suppose, that a man that is retired from the City, to live in repose, is full
of assurance and contentment: and that he lives but to him self, all things,
both the one and the other, cannot but befortune, and attend a wise man. True
it is that the wise man cares not for any thing, and that he knows how to
live unto himself. For (that which is the principal good) he knows how to
live. For he that ^lieth both from men and affairs; he whom the misery of his
ambitions has banished out of the City, that cannot see any more happy then
himself, that like a fearful and slothful creature, has been hid for
fears, he lives not to himself, but that which is more loathsome and
disliking, he lives to his belly, his sleep and his lust. He lives not to
himself, that lives to no man; yet constancy and perseverance in our first
designs, is a thing so valued, that obstinate idleness retains and has
some authority also. Touching the building it self, I can speak or write
thee nothing certain, for I only know it outwardly, and by the show it makes
to all passengers. There are are two caves of marvelous workmanship, alike
with spacious entrance, and builded by hand, the one whereof never admits
the Sun, and the other is filled with his reflections until he set. There is
a place planted with Plane-trees, in the midst whereof there runs a
brook, that falls afterward into the sea, and into the lake of Acherusium,
and it divided is as an Euripus, sufficient to nourish much fish, although a
man take them daily: but it is spared when the sea affords good fishing time,
and when as a tempest restrains the fishermen: each one may catch and fish
them easily. But the greatest commodity that is in this house, is that it has
behind the walls thereof, the Bayas, and that being exempt from all the
incommodities thereof, it pertaketh all the pleasures and delights of the same.
I my self on my knowledge can give it this commendation, that I believe it to
be a place fit to be inhabited all the year long. For it is opposite against
the West-winde, and intercepteth it so conveniently, that it hinders it from
blowing upon Bayas: not inconsiderately, as it seems, did Vatia make choice
of this place, in which he might bestow his idle time, and old age; yet very
little or nothing does place profit to the tranquillity of the spirit, it is
the mind which commends all things, I have seen some live pensive and
melancholy in their houses of pleasure: I have seen othersome live in
solitary places, as if they had much business. Wherefore thou art not to
think, that therefore thou art little at thine ease, because thou art not in
Campania: but why art thou not? send thy thought hither: Thou may confer
with thine absent friends, yea as often, and as long as thou will, then most of
all envy we this pleasure (which is the greatest) when we are absent. For
presence makes us wantons, and because that we confer together, that we
walk together, and that at sometimes we sit together; so soon as we are
departed one from another we remember them no more, whose presence we have lost
of late. And for this cause ought we not to be grieved with the absence of our
friends, for there is not one, that is not far absent from them, even in
their very presence: if thou will first of all recount the nights, wherein thou
art separated from them: the diverse occupations that both one and the other
have; the secret studies, the goings and commings out of the City; and thou
shall see that the time, which long voyages make us loose, is not ouer-great. A
friend is to be possessed in mind: she sees always him whom she will see.
And therefore I pray thee study with me, sup with me, and walk with me: we
should live in a miserable restraint, if any thing were hidden from our
thoughts. I see thee, my Lucilius then with most content, when I hear thee. I
am so truly with thee, that I am' in doubt whether I should begin to write,
not Epistles, but books unto thee.

EPIST. LVI.
That a settled mind enjoys it self, and intends his studies, yea even
amiddest the press of men. This teaches me by his example. That inward
silence and peace is more to be wished for. Furthermore, that sloth is evil,
and the mother of desires.

LEt me die, if silence be as necessary, as it seems to him that is retired
to his study. Behold what different cries sound about me on every side, I am
lodged even over the bathes. Represent unto thy self now all sorts of voices,
that may draw the ears into hatred of them: when the stronger so^t do their
exercises, when they spread their hands laden with lead, when either they
travel, or imitate him that labors, I hear their groan^s. As soon as they
have given liberty to their retain^d breath, I hear their wheesings and
weighty breathings. When a man ^alleth into the hands of an unmannerly sot,
that takes upon him to anoint men, and is content to serve them, as he would
do any one of the inferior people, I hear the stroke of his hand that
strikes them on the shoulders; which according as he lays it on, either
flat or hollow, changes his sound. But if perchance he that casts the
balls, anointed with pitch to nourish the fire under the baynes, comes in,
and that he begins to reckon them, all is lost. Count him likewise that
cleanses the ordures, and the thief taken in the a^t, and he also that takes
pleasure to hear his voice ring in the bath. And likewise to this number those
that with a full leap, and with a great shout, cast themselves into the bayne.
Moreover, put them in this rank, who at the least, if they do no other
thing, have their voices and words ful-mouthed; as him that draws the hair
from the arme-pit, that incessantly breaths forth a small and trembling
voice, to the end he may be the better noted amongst the rest, that never
holds his peace, but at such time when he riddeth the arme-pits of hair, to
some one whom he constrains to cry for him. A man h^areth afterward an
infinite cry of Cake-sellers, of Saudsige-mongers, and crackling Merchants,
and all the Cooks skullions, who sell their meat, every one of them with
their proper tune, to the end they may be the better marked. O how iron a
brains is thine (say thou) O how deaf art thou, if thy spirit be not
troubled, amidst such dim, and diversity of cries, since our Chrysippus fell
down almost dead, to hear the good-morrowes which men gave him in saluting
him. For mine own part, I honestly swear unto thee, that I care as little for
all these cries, as for the floods or fall of a river; although that I have
heard say, that a people was constrained, for this only cause, to go and
rebuild their city in another country, because they could not endure the fall
which the noise of Nilus made. In my opinion, words distract a man more then
noyses. For words distract the mind, and noise does no other thing but fill
and beat the ear. Amongst those that make a noise, but distract not my
spirit, I place those coach-men and smithes that hire my shop, the lock-maker
my neighbor, and he that dwells near to the Temple of peace, when he
tries his Trumpets and Hant-boyes, and who not only sings, but exclaimeth.
The noice likewise more troubles me that is intermitted, then that which is
continued. But I am now in such sort hardened to all this, that I can now hear
a Captain of a Gally, when he teaches his Gally-slaues with a stern voice,
how to manage their oars. For I compel my mind to be intentive to it self,
and not to be distracted by exterior things. Let whatsoever voice be made
exteriorly, provided there be no debate in my soul, provided that desire and
^eare in me are not at odds, provided that avarice and prodigality have not
any quarrel together, and that the one makes not war against the other. For
what avails it us to have silence round about us; if the passions of the
mind storm and be distempered. Night covered all composed to quiet rest.
This is false, there is no peaceable sleep, but when as reason engenders it.
It is the night that represents unto us all our troubles, in stead of drawing
them from us, and does nothing but change our cares. For the dreams of those
that sleep are as troublesome unto them, as is the day. That is true
tranquillity, on which a good and holy soul may repose. Mark me him that
seeks for his sleep in a large and spacious house, and how to provide that
no noise offend his ears: all the troop of his servants keep silence and are
still, and how they that would approach his bed, lift up their feet, and set
them softly on the ground. Truly he does naught else but turn and toss this
way and that way, he takes but a slight rest, intermixed with discontents of
the mind, he complains that he hears that which he hears not. What
think thou is the cause hereof? It is a tumult that is engendered in his
soul, that it is, which he should appease, it is the sedition of the mind
that should be extinguished, which thou must never suppose to have quiet rest,
although thy bones be laid to rest. Repose sometimes as without repose. It
shall be therefore requisite for us to awake our selves by the managing of some
affairs, and to occupy our selves, in the search of good arts and sciences,
when we perceive that the sourge of idleness (which cannot endure it self)
does ouerwhelme us. The greatest Generals of armies, at such time as they
perceive that their soldiers do grow disobedient, they make them martch, to
keep them in obedience, and cause them to undertake some sudden onslaught.
They that have business, have no leisure to wax wanton. It is a thing most
certain, that there is nothing that more confounds those vices, which are
engendered by idleness, then travel and occupation does. We seem very often
to have retired our selves out of the City, by reason of our distaste for the
ever managing of public affairs, and for that we repent our selves, that we
have so long time remained in a place, where we receive nothing but miseries
and displeasures. And yet notwithstanding, in that very cave, into which our
fear and weariness has cast us, our ambition reuiueth and flourishes. For
it is not wholly lost, it is only wearied, it is only repulsed, seeing the
affairs grew not answerable to his expectation. As much say I of prodigality
and lavish expense, which seems sometimes to be retired, and comes
afterward to solicit those anew, who have resolved with themselves to live
soberly and wisely, and in the midst of their thrift she reassumeth those
pleasures (which she had not wholly condemned, but only left for a time) with
a force as much more violent, as she is covertly hidden. For those vices which
appear outwardly are much less dangerous, and infirmities themselves begin to
take remedy, when they appear in sight, and manifest their venom. Make
account therefore, that avarice, ambition, and those other evil passions which
travail our souls, are more pernicious, when we feign our selves to be
healed, and to have lost them. We seem to be idle, and we are not. For if it
were true that we are, if we had sounded retreat to retire our selves from
vices, if we have contemned that which seems to be fair in outward
appearance, as I have said a little before, there is nothing that can recall
us, there is neither song of birds nor music of men that may cross our holy
thoughts, when they shall already be firmed and assured. That wit is slight,
and as yet scarce well retired into it self, that admireth at the brute of
every small accident. He has some care hidden in his soul, and some fear
that makes him pensive; and as our Virgil says, And me whom erst no darted
weapons moved,
Nor Grecian troops for courage once improu'd,
Now every win^e that breathes or beats mine ear,
Awakes my sleeps, and breeds my sudden fear,
Starting I wake, and fear does me surprise,
For him I bear, and for my charge likewise.
The first of these is wise, and is not daunted with the darts that are shot
against him, neither with the threatening arms of a great squadron of the
enemy, nor with the outcries of a City disturbed with sedition. But the
other is an ignorant ^ot, he is afraid to lose his goods, he is affrighted at
the first noise he hears, he thinks that a little voice is a great rumor,
and the least motion abateth his courage. The burden of his riches makes him
thus fearful: make choice of whom thou will, amongst all these rich men, that
gather much, and bear great wealth with them, thou shall see that he is
always in fear, both for those that he bears with him, as for those that
follow him. Know therefore that then thou art well composed, when no fear can
move thee, when no voice can make thee depart out of thy self, not at that
time when it flattereth thee, nor then when it threatens thee, neither then
when with a vain rumor it shall make a noise in thine ear. What then? Is it
not more commodious not to hear their slanders? I confess it. Therefore is it
that I would retire my self from this place, but my intent was to make trial
of, and to exercise my patience. What needs it a man to suffer himself to be
tormented a long time, if Ulysses have found so easy a remedy for his
companions, against the Sirens themselves?

EPIST. LVII.
O^ the Neapolitan Vault and the horror there. Then that our first motions are
not in our power. Somewhat of the tenuitie and celeritie of the mind.

WHen I would depart from Baias to return to Naples, I easily believed that we
should have a tempest, because I would no more travail by sea: but there were
so many slowes all the way long, that a man might justly imagine that I had
iourneyed by water. I was enforced that day to suffer all the fatallitie of the
wrestlers. For after we had been well wet, we were tormented all the day long
with dust in the Vault of Naples. There is nothing more long then that prison,
nothing more obscure then the entrance of that cave, which was the cause that
we saw not through the darkness, but darkness themselves; nevertheless,
although the place had light in it, yet the dust which is likewise as
troublesome and displeasant in open air, would obscure the same. What think
thou then that it should be in this Vault, where after it is raised like a
tempest, enclosed in one place where no air breaths, it falls down on
those that have raised it. We have suffered two great and contrary commodities,
in the same way, and the same day, we have been tormented with dirt and with
dust. Yet this obscurity gave me some fit matter to think upon. I felt, as it
were a great shake and fearelesse change in my mind, which the novelty of a
thing so unaccustomed, and the loathsomenesse of that place had caused. I
speak not now with thee of my self, who am far short of a man entirely
perfect, but yet of a tolerable taught man. I speak of him, over whom Fortune
has no power, for that other would change both color and courage. For there
are certain passions which a man cannot avoid, by any virtue. Nature
admonishes him that he is mortal. And therefore he will, frown at the first
cause of sorrow; he will tremble for fear at a sudden accident, his sight will
be troubled, if being carried to the height of a huge mountaie, he behold the
huge and vaste depth. This is not fear, it is a natural passion, which reason
cannot conquer. Therefore is it, that some valiant men, and most ready to
shead their own blood, that cannot endure to see another man's. Some that
cannot behold a fresh wound, and othersome that swound, with only touching an
old and mattery sore; and others that are afraid to see a naked sword drawn in
jest, and yet fear not to be killed. I felt then, as I told thee, not an
astonishment, but a change. Again, as soon as we came unto the light, a
sudden joy surprised me, without thinking of that. Then began I to say in my
self; how without cause we fear somethings more, somethings less, although
the end of all of them be alike. For what difference make thou, whether the
ruin of a tower, or of a mountain, fall upon a sentinel? Thou shall find
none: notwithstanding there are some that will fear more the fall of the
tower, although both of them be powerful enough to make them die: because
fear apprehends more the effects, then the cause that engenders them. Thou
think (it may be) that I will speak of the Stoics, who are of opinion,
that the soul of a man, which is stifled and crushed under a great ruin,
cannot issue, but that she disperseth her self incontinently, because she
might not escape freely. But I do not; and they that say so are very much
deceived, in my opinion. Even as a flame cannot be choked, because it flies
and retireth it self, with that which drives it: as the air cannot be hurt
with a stroke, nor be divided, or harmed by a whip, but spreads it self
round about the body, to which it makes place: So the soul, which is the
subtillest and purest thing of the world, cannot be either retained or
tormented within the body, but by the means of her subtlety, she glideth
through all that which presses her. And even as the lightning, after it has
beaten and hugely blasted an house, departs through a very little hole: So
that soul which is far more subtle then fire, passes and penitrateth
through all sorts of bodies. Therefore may we enquire thereof, whether it may be
immortal. But hold this for a thing assured, that if it survive the body,
that consequently it cannot perish by any means whatsoever, because it may not
perish. For there is not any immortality, that is subject to exception or
condition: and there is nothing also which may hurt that which is eternal.

EPIST. LVIII.
That certain late words are now out of use. He passes to the Phisiques, and
shows how manifold Ens or Being is out of PLATO. He fitteth it to the
Ethnic, and that nothing here is the same, or perpetual. Then what use can
subtilties have, and that this it to be taken in every thing. He adds of old
age and death, and that neither is to be wished or refused.

Never had I better knowledge of the poverty, or, to speak truly, the
indigence which we have of words, then I have at this day. A thousand things
happened when as casually we spoke of Plato, which wanted or had not their
names, and some which had, and some that through our delicacie had lost that
name which they had by antiquity. But who can allow of that disgust in so
great poverty? That Ox-flie which the Grecians call Oestrum that stingeth and
chafeth beasts, and scatters them in the Forests, our Latins called Asilus.
Thou may well believe Virgil: And those Ox-flies that in great troops do
fly
Near Alburne Mountain, or to Siler wood;
The which in Room Asilus signify,
And by the Greeks for Oestrum understood,
Stinging and buzzing, which make cattle stray
Amidst the Forests scattered with dismay.
I think that he understood that this word was wholly lost. And to the end
that I delay thee no longer, there were some simple words in use, as when they
said amongst themselves Cernere ferro inter se, that is to say, to determine
their quarrels betwixt themselves by arms. The same Virgil shall prove this,
And King LATINVS too amazed stands
To see two men both borne in foreign lands,
In several Angles of this mighty frame,
Could thus assembled meet, and join their bands,
To try their right by sword, and win the same.
Which now we call decernere, which is as much to say as Decide. The use of
this simple word is lost. Our ancestors said Si iusso, that is to say, Si
iusser^, which signifies, If I command. I will not that thou believe me.
Herein Virgil is a faithful witness; Let all the other troops
Which I command come after to the fight.
I labor not now by this diligence, that I may show how much time I have lost
after the Grammarians, but that thou may understand this, how many words a
man reads in Ennius and Attius, which at this day are rustie and out-worne,
since those of Virgil himself, who is daily ouer-looked and handled by us, are
in some sort lost unto us. What means this preparation, say thou? Whereto
tends it? I will not conceal it from thee. My desire is (without offensing
thine ear) to say Essensed; if not, I will nevertheless say it, although I
should displease thee. I have Marcus Tullius Cicero, the Father of all Roman
eloquence, and whom it is no shame to imitate, author and approuer of this
word; whose example and authority I think is sufficient. If thou art desirous
to have one of our late Writers, that has used this word, I have Fabianus, one
of our own profession, a man of great learning and eloquence, of a style full
of sharpness and elegancie, and of an extraordinary purity and neatenesse
of tongue, which although it be excellent in his kind, yet sometimes
disgusteth with too much affectation. What should I do my Lucilius? How should
I call this Greek word (...), that is to say, Essence, or Existence, or Being,
or Substance? A thing so necessary, containing in the understanding thereof,
all the whole frame of that, which by all Philosophers both ancient and
modern is called Nature, and which is the foundation of all things? I pray
thee give me leave to use this word. Yet will I make use of the liberty thou
have given me to use this word, most sparingly; and will not use it but upon
necessity, when no other word will so perfitly explicate the sense: and it may
be that I will not use it all, but content my self with the privilege only.
But whereto shall this facility of thine serve me, considering that I cannot
in any sort express this word in Latin, which is the cause that I have so
much exclaimed against our language? yet more will thou condemn the Roman
penuri^ and poverty, when thou shall find there is a syllable which I cannot
translate. Ask thou me what it is, (...), which is as much to say as That
which is. Thou may suppose me to be gross witted, and imagine it a very
easy matter to be done, and that a man may translate that after this manner,
and say, Quod est, That which is. But there is a great difference between
them. For I am constrained to use a Verb for a Noune; and if I must needs give
one, I will say Quod est, That which is. A friend of mine, and a man of great
knowledge told me this present day, that Plato gave six significations to
this word: I will expound all of them unto thee, so soon as I have explicated
unto thee, that there is a certain Genus and certain Species also: for first
of all we ought to seek out this Gender, on which all the other Species and
kinds do depend, from whom all the difference and divisions proceed, and
under whom all is comprised. But this shall we find out if we begin to read
all things backward: for by this mean we shall ascend and attain unto the
first. A man as Aristotle says, is a kind, a horse is a kind, a dog is a
kind. A common bond is therefore to be found out, which knitteth together all
these things, and comprehends them all in himself; and what shall this be? A
living creature. A living creature then has begun to be the Gender to all
those I named of late; of a man, of a horse, and of a dog. But there are
certain things which have a soul, which are not living creatures: for it is a
thing most certain that seeds and trees have souls; and therefore we say
that they live and die. Living creatures then shall hold the highest place,
because that all things which have life and sense are under this form, yea,
seeds also. Some things want a soul, as stones. Some things therefore shall
be more high and greater then such as are living creatures, that is to say a
body. This will I divide after this manner, that I may say that all bodies are
animated or inaminated: and notwithstanding all this, there is something more
high then a body. For we say that there are somethings corporeate, and other
incorporeate: what then shall that be from whence these are deduced? That it is
too much, we have heretofore assigned a name improper enough. That which is:
for so will it be divided into Species, if we say, That which is, has either a
body or is incorporate. So here then is the first Gender and the highest, and
if I should say so, the general; the rest, to speak truth are Genders, but
they are Speciats, as a man is a Genus. For he contains under him the kinds
of Nations, Greeks, Romans, and Parthians; and of colors, as white, black,
and read. There are also some particulars, as Plato, Cicero, Lucrece. For this
cause when he contains diverse things under him, he takes the name of a
Gender, and when he is contained under any other he is called a Species. But
that Gender which is general has nothing above it self: it is the beginning
of all things. All whatsoever is, is under the same. The Stoics would place
another Gender above this as more principal, whereof I will speak anon, so
soon as first of all I have made manifest this, that the Gender whereof I have
spoken, ought in right to be placed in the first rank, since in it self it
comprehends all things. I divide That which is, into these kinds; that is to
say, into corporeal and incorporeall: for there is no third. But how shall I
make division of the body? I must say, that either they are animated, or
inanimate. Again, how divide I things animated? I will say that some have
understanding, other some have but a soul: or rather thus; some have motion,
walk or pass, some others are tied to the earth, and are nourished and
increase by their roots. Again, into what kinds should I distinguish living
creatures? Either they are mortal, or immortal. Some Stoics suppose the
primum Genus to be Quid; but why they so think I will hereafter set down: In
nature, say they, there are some things which are and are not, and that nature
comprehends those things which are not, and present themselves to our
understanding, as are Centaures, Giants, and all other such things; which being
formed by a false imagination, begins to have some Image, although they have no
substance. Now return I to that which I promised thee, that is to say, how
Plato has divided al things that are in six sorts. That first, Which is, a man
cannot comprehend either by light or touch, or by any other sense. That which
is general is but in imagination. As a man in general is not seen by the
eye, but a particular man is, as Cicero and Cato. A living creature is not
seen, but is only comprehended in the understanding; yet are the kinds
thereof s^ene, as a horse and a dog. Of things which are, Plato puts for
the second Gender, that which is called eminent, and surpasses all other. He
says that this is in way of excellency. As a Poet is a common name, for all
they that make Verses are so called. But now amongst the Greeks this word
signifies but one, and when thou shall hear them say Poet, thou must
understand that it is Homer. What is it then that thou would say? It is God
who is the greatest and the most powerful of all other things. The third kind
is of those things which are proper, and these are innumerable, but they are
also placed out of our sight. Ask thou me what they are? They are Platoes,
proper implements, and moueables, he calls them Ideas, of which all things
which we behold are made, and to which all things are formed. These are
immortal, immutable, and inviolable. Hear I pray you what Idea is, and what
Plato thinks of it. It is a pattern, and eternal moulde of all things,
which are made by nature: yet will I add an interpretation to this definition,
to the end the matter may more plainly appear unto thee, I have a will to make
thy picture. Thou art the pattern of my picture, of which my mind gathers
some habit, which he will delineate in his work. So that face which teaches
and instructs me, and from which I derive my imitation, is Idea. Nature then,
the mother of all things, has an infinity of these patterns, as of men, of
fishes, of trees, on which is drawn and expressed all that which she ought to
do. The fourth place is given to an Image. But it behooves thee to be very
careful in understanding what this Image is, and that thou lay the blame on
Plato and not on me, as touching the difficulty of things. Yet is there
nothing that is subtle, which is not accompanied with difficulty. Not long
since I used the comparison of the Image which a Painter made. He when in
colors he would paint Virgil to the life, beheld him. Virgils face was the
Idea, and the pattern of his intended work; but that which the Painter has
drawn from that visage, and that which he has painted on his table is (...),
that is to say, an Image. Ask thou me what difference there is? The one is
the pattern, the other the figure, drawn from the pattern, and put upon the
work: the one is that which the Painter imitat^th, and the other is that which
he makes. A statue that represents a man, has some face that is (...),
which is as much to say, as an Image. The pattern it self also has some
face, on which the worke-man in beholding it, has formed his. Image, and that
is the Idea. Ask thou as yet another distinction? (...), that is to say, an
Image is the work which is made, and the Idea is out of the work, and is not
only out of the work, but it is before that the work was. The fifth Gender is
of those that are commonly, and they begin to appertain unto us. There it is
where all things are both men, and beasts, and all other things. The sixth
Gender is of those things that seem to be, as void and time, Plato numbreth
not amongst these that which we see and touch, because they feet, and pass,
and have no being, but in a continual diminution and adiection. There is no
one of us that in his old age is that which he was when he was young. No one
man is the same in the morning which he was in the evening, before our bodies
are ravished and rouled after the manner of Rivers. All that which thou ^eest
runs with the course of time, nothing is permanent whatsoever we see. I my
self, whilst I say that these things are changed, am changed my self. This it
is that Heraclitus says, we never descend two times into the same river: the
same name of the River remains, but the water is stolen by. This is more
manifest in a river then in a man; yet does a no less current carry us away.
And therefore marvel I so much at our folly, that we can so heartily love the
body, which is a thing so subject unto flight, and that we have fear to die
some day, since every moment is a death of the first estate, wherein we were.
Will thou fear that, that shall be once done, which is daily don? I have
spoken of a man, which is a matter frail, perrishable, and subject to all
accidents of fortune. But the world also, although it be eternal and
invincible, yet is it subject to changes, and remains not in the same estate.
For although as yet it has all that which it ever had, yet has it the same
otherwise then it had it, and changes his order. What say thou, shall this
subtilty profit me? If thou ask, I will answer thee nothing. But even as the
Grauer, after he has held his eyes so long time fixed on his work, that they
are wearied, favors and recreateth them, or, as we are wont to say, reposeth
them: so likewise ought we sometimes to recreate our spirit, and refect the
same with some delights provided that these recreations be works. Amiddest
which, if thou take good heed, thou shall find something that may be
wholesome. This my Lucilius, am I wont to do. In all things wherein I employ my
self, although they be far estranged from Philosophy, I endeavor to draw some
profit whereof I may make use. But what profit can I take from this Discourse
that I have now entertained, so estranged from reformation of manners? How can
these Ideas of Plato make me better? What shall I draw from these that may
restrain my desires? At leastwise I shall learn that Plato denies, that
nothing of that which serves our sensuality, that heateth and provoke us,
is of the number of those things that are really. These things then are
imaginary, and bear some appearance for a time: there is nothing in them that
is firm and assured; and notwithstanding we desire them as if they should be
always durrable, and continually permanent with us. We are wearied and feeble,
and linger for a time in the way. Let us fix our minds on those things that
are eternal: let us admire the forms of all things that fly on high, and how
God conuersing amongst them, and providing for all conserueth that against
death which he could not make immortal because the matter hindered him, and
how by reason he might surmount the vices of the body. For all things remain,
not because they are eternal, but because they are defended by the care of him
that governs them. Immortal things need no conseruer or tutor, the workman
that made them, maintayneth them, surmounting by his virtue the frailty of the
matter. Let us contemn al these things which are not so precious, that it is to
be doubted whether they be at all. Let us think also by the same means, that
if the divine providence freeth and keeps this world (which is no less
mortal then we are) from all perils and dangers, that we likewise may by our
providence lengthen out a little time, and prolong life in this little body of
ours, if we can bridle and moderate our pleasures, by means whereof the
greater part of men are lost. Plato himself by a discreet government, of
himself has attained to old age. He had a strong and able body, and men
gave him that name by reason of the broadnes of his breast; but his voyages by
Sea, and those dangers he had passed, had very much diminished his forces: yet
his sobriety and the moderation of those things which call on, and provoke
voracitie, and the diligent government of himself; the many others causes
hindered him, continued to his old age. For thou know this as I think,
that this befell Plato by reason of the benefit of his diligence, that he
departed on his birthday, and finished the race of foure-score and one y^^res
without any deduction. And therefore it was that certain Magi, who by f^rtune
were in the City of Athens at that time, sacri^iced unto him after his death,
supposing that his nature was more excellent then that of other men's, because
that he had justly attained the most perfect number of life, which nine times
accomplish. I doubt not but that he was ready to remit some few days of this
sum, and sacrifice. Frugalitie may lengthen old age, which in my opinion, as
it is not to be desired, so is it not to be refused. It is a matter of great
contentment for a man to be with himself as long as he may, and especially
when he has made himself worthy to enjoy the same. Nearly approaches he the
nature of a coward, that slothfully expects the last hour of his life: as he
is beyond all measure addicted to wine, who after he has drunk all the wine
out of the tun, would swallow down the lees likewise. Yet will we
notwithstanding dispute further whether the last part of our age be the lees of
our life, or whether it be the most purest and liquidest part of our age,
provident that the soul be not any ways enfeebled, and that the senses be as
yet entire for the service of the same, and that the body be not destitute of
his forces, and half dead before his time. For it avails much whether a man
prolong his life, or linger his death. But if the body be in such sort
unprofitable, that it cannot any longer perform his functions; why should not
a man draw his soul out of prison, that does but languish? Peradventure it
were the best to do it the soonest that a man might, lest when it should be
done thou can not do it. And whereas there is a greater danger of living
badly, then of dying quickly: he is a fool the which the price of the loss of
a little time will not redeem the hazard of a great inconvenience. Few men
has long age brought to death without injury. And diverse men have ouerpassed
their life time idly, without doing any thing. But why should thou esteem
him more cruel to lose some part of life, which must likewise take an end? Be
not displeased to understand that which I say, as if this sentence should be
pronounced against thee; but judge thou of that which I say. I will not abandon
mine old age, if she reserve me wholly unto my self. I say wholly in respect
of that part which is the best. But if she have begun to trouble mine
understanding, or to ruinate some part, or that she has not left me my life,
but my soul: I will depart out of this ruinous and rott^n house: I will not
fly a sickness by the remedy of death, provided that it may be healed, and
that it breed no damage to my soul: I will not kill my self to make an end of
my pain; for it is as much as to be vanquished, to die after this manner: yet
if I knew that I should endure the same, all the rest of my life, I would
depart from it, not by reason of the grief, but for that it would hinder me
from doing all things for which a man desires to live. A man is a recreant,
and of little courage, that dies to escape from pain. He is a fool likewise
that lives to feel nothing but pain. But I am ouer-long, there is matter
besides which cannot be expressed in a day. But how might he make an end of his
life, that cannot make an end of his letter? Farewell then: for thou will read
these later words more willingly, then the other discourses which entreat of
nothing but death.

EPIST. LIX.
The difference betwixt voluptuousness and joy, and that this is an honest
word. Then praises he LVCILIVS his style, and that a Philosopher likewise is
not to neglect words: and that parables and similitudes are to be loved, yet
that we are seriously, and not slightly to study Philosophy, neither must we
please our selves quickly, since flattery confounds us.

I Have read thy Letter with great pleasure, permit me, I pray the^, to use
these common words; neither revoke them to the Sto^cks signification. We
believe that pleasure is a vice. Put case it be^ yet are we wont to use this
word to express an affection of joy in our soules^ I know well, I tell thee,
that pleasure (if we will that our words be aimed to our own purpose) is an
infamous thing, and that joy cannot happen but to a wiseman. For joy is a
certain lifting up of the mind, that trusts to his proper goods and forces.
Yet commonly we speak thus, and say that we have conceived a great joy of such
a man's Consulate, or of some marriages, or of our wives bringing to bed, which
are not so certain joys, but that oft-times they are the beginnings of future
sadness. But true joy has this benefit to accompany it, that it never has
end, neither is turned to his contrary. Therefore when our Virgil says, And
the evil joys of the mind, he speaks elegantly, but yet not properly. For
there is not any evil that brings joy. He has given this name unto
pleasures, and has very well expressed that which he would say; for he meant
and expressed those men that rejoice in their evil and misfortune: yet have
not I without cause said that I took great pleasure in thy Epistle. For
although an ignorant man rejoice upon a good occasion, yet so it is, that I
call that affection which he cannot moderate, and that presently will cas^ it
self upon other diverse subjects. I call it, I say pleasure, conceived by
opinion of a fained good, conducted without measure and discretion. But to
return to my purpose, hear what delighted me in thy Epistle: Thou have words
at will, thy discourse transporteth thee not, and draws thee not further then
thou have destinated. There are some that are drawn by the beauty of some
word that best likes them, to write more then they had purposed, but the same
befalls not thee. All is well ordered and well applied. Thou speak as much
as thou will, and signifiest more then thou speak. This is a sign of some
greater matter. Moreover, it appears that it has no superfluity in it, and
nothing proud: yet find I sometimes Metaphors, which as they are not
ouer-hardie, so are they not unprovided of beauty, and that have already made
proof of their good grace. I find certain comparisons, whereof if there be
any one that will interdict us the use, and permits them only to Poets, he
seems to me that he has not read any of the ancient authors: amongst whom
as yet a plausible speech was not affected or expected. They that speak
simply, and to make us only understand that they would speak, were full of
Metaphors and similitudes, which in my opinion were necessary, not for the
same cause the Poets had to use them, but to assist the feeblenes of our
spirit, and to represent most lively to the Disciple, and to the auditor that
which they said. As behold when I read amongst other, Sextius a vehement and
subtle man, Philosophying in Greek words and Roman manners, I took great
pleasure to see the similitude and comparison which he used, that an army
which fears to be assailed by an enemy, martcheth in a square battle, to be
more ready for the fight: The wiseman, says he, should do the like; he
ought to stretch out his virtues on all sides, to the end that if there be any
danger that threatens him, his supply may be in a readiness, and that without
any disorder they may obey their governor; which we see to fall out in armies,
which great Captains know how to arrange, where all the troops are so orderly
disposed, that both the one and the other understand at the same time the
commandment of their General, and the watchword is as soon heard amongst the
battle of footmen, as the troops of horsemen. But Sextius says, that this is
more necessary for us, then for men of war. For they have oftentimes had
fear of the enemy without cause, and the highway they feared to be most
dangerous to them, was most assured. Folly has nothing which is exempt from
fear. She fears as much from above, as from beneath; she is afraid both of
the one quarter and of the other. There are dangers that come before her, and
that follow after her. She is afraid of all things; she is never assured, but
fears her own succors and assistants. But a wiseman is armed, and advised
against all fortunes and violences, although poverty, misery, ignominy and
pain assault and charge him, he will never retire^ he will march, without any
fear against his mischiefs, and in the midst of them diverse things hold us
bond, and restrain us, diverse other take from us our forces, we have so long
time lien soyled in these vices, that we can hardly be cleansed from them.
For we are not only soiled, but also wholly poisoned. And to the end, that
from one comparison we pass not to another. I will ask thee (which I have
oftentimes considered in my self) why it is that folly does so opimatiuely tie
us unto her? First, because we repulse her not valiantly, and that we will not
do our uttermost endeavor to seek help. Next, because we give not sufficient
credit to those things which are found out by wise men; neither receive them
with an open breast, and pass over, and that ouer-lightly, a thing of great
importance. But how can any man sufficiently learn what suffices against
vices, who learneth but then, when he has leisure to give over the liberty of
his vices. There is none of us that diueth to the bottom, we have only
gathered the top. It is overmuch to have been employed, and to have given a
very little time to Philosophy. But that which most hinders us, is that we
overmuch please our selves, with our s^lues: If we find any man that will
call us good men, wise and holy men, we bel^eue them. We are not satisfied with
a moderat praise, whatsoever immoderat flattery has heaped on us, we receive
as due unto us, we consent unto those that say we are very wise and very good,
although we know well that they are accustomed to lie. And so far flatter we
our selves, that we will be praised for things wholly contrary to that we do.
Such a one there is that hears, that even they whom he sends to execution,
call him sweet and merciful, liberal in his thefts and robberies, sober and
temperate in his drunkenness and lechery. Whence it comes to pass, that
we will not make any change in our selves, because we judge our selves to be
honest men. Alexander, at such time as he ouer-ranne all India, and pillaged
the same by war, as far as those nations that were scantly known to their
neighbors, riding about the walls of a City, which he beheld besieged, to know
on what side it was most easy to be assaulted, and finding himself wounded
by the shot of an arrow, he remained a long time on horseback, and continued
his enterprise. But after the blood was stanched, and that the pain of the
wound which was already dried, began to increase, and that his leg which
hung on his horse pommell, began to be astonished, he was constrained to retire
himself, and to say, All the world swears that I am IVPITERS son, but this
wound of mine cries out that I am a man: The like let us do, when as by force
of flattery, every one of us are made fools. Let us say, You report that I am
wise, but I see how many unprofitable things I desire, and how many hurtful I
wish for. Neither understand I this which sacietie teaches brute-beasts, what
measure should be allotted for meat, what for drink, as yet I know now how
much I should take. Now will I teach thee how thou may understand, that as
yet thou art not wise. He may be termed, and is wise, who is replenished with
joy, glad and moderate, and that feels no passion, lives equal with the
gods. Now counsel thou thy self, if thou art never sad, if no hope solicit
thy mind, in expectation of that which is to come, if day and night, thy
spirit enjoy an ^quall and assured repose, if it be contented in it self, thou
have attained to the fullness of that felicity a man may desire. But if as yet
thou huntest after all sorts of pleasures, both here and there, make account
that thou art as far estranged from wisdom, as thou shall be from joy and
content. Thou have a will to attain thereunto, but thou deceiuest thy self,
if thou think that thou may atchieue the same by the means of riches.
Searchest thou thy joy amiddest honors, that is to say, amongst cares? These
things which thou thus desire, and think to be any tables to breed thee
pleasure and content, are but occasions of sorrows. All these, I say, think
to find joy and pleasure, but they know not the means to gain a great and
perdurable contentment. One takes that in his banquets and his foolish
expenses: another in his ambition and great troop of vassals, that follow and
flock about him on every side, and others by the favors of his friends,
another by vain ostentation of the study of liberal Arts and Sciences, and
letters which heal nothing. All these are besotted with a flattering pleasure,
which continues not long as drunkenness, which yields some foolish joy for
an honor, and sees it self afterward followed with a tedious repentance. Or
as the honor of an applause, and favorable acclamation of the people, which
has been gotten and ended with much pain. Thou must then think this, that
the effect of wisdom is the equality of joy. The mind of a wise man is such,
as is the state of the world above the Moon, there is the air always
peaceable and fair. See here wherefore thou ought desire to be wise, for
the wise man i^ never without joy. This contentment grows not, but from the
conscience of virtues. No man can rejoice, but he that is constant, just, and
temperate. What then (say thou) do fools and wicked men never rejoice? No,
no more then Lions do, that have found their prey. When they are wearied and
glutted with wine, and all other pleasures, when as the night which they wholly
ouer-passe in drinking is as yet but very short unto them, when in a little
body a man has included greater pleasures then it may contain, and that he
begins to give over, and cast them out, then wretches as they are, begin
they to exclame and cry out this verse of Virgil. For how we lewdly spent this
later night
In fained pleasures thou well understand.
They which are addicted to foolish expense and superfluity, pass all the
night long in foolish pleasures, as if it should be their last. But that
pleasure and joy that follows the gods, and those that live as they do, is
never intermixed or brought to end: it should cease, if it proceeded and were
borrowed from an other. But because it comes not by the means of another, it
depends not also on the power and authority of another. Fortune cannot take
that away which she has not given.

EPIST. LX.
That the vows of the common sort are to be despised, and Nature is to be
heard.

I Complain, I wrangle, and am wrathful. As yet deniest thou that which thy
Nurse, thy Tutor, or mother have wished thee. Thou know not as yet how many
evils they have wished thee. O how harmefull are the wishes of our friends unto
us! Yea even then most hurtful, when they fall out most happily. I do not now
marvel if all the mischiefs of the world befall us, from our first infancy.
We are grown amiddest the execrations of our parents. Let the gods at any time
hear our vows, without asking them any thing. How long shall it be, that we
will always crave some good at the hands of the gods, as if we had not
wherewith to nourish our selves? how long shall we fill the fields with corn,
that might suffice to satisfy great Cities: how long time shall it be that a
whole Province or Nation shall be employed in reaping our corn? How long time
shall it be, that a great number of ships shall be employed, to carry from
diverse seas the corn that should serve but one man's table? The Bull is fatned
in the pasture of a few acres. One only Forest suffices many Elephants. A man
feeds both of the land and sea. What then? Has Nature given us so insatiable
a belly, in regard of that little body she has given us, that it should
surpass the voracitie and hunger of the hugest and most ravenous beasts in
this world? Noe truly. For how little is it that we owe unto Nature? A man
may content himself with a little. It is not the hunger of our bellies that
costeth us so dear, it is our glory and ambition. And for this cause (as
Salust says) they which follow the pleasures of their belly, ought to be
reckoned and ranked amiddest the number of beasts, and not of men; and some of
them beside, not amongst the number of beasts, but of the dead. H^ lives that
uses him self, but they that lie hid in sluggishnesse, so live in their
houses as in a sepulcher. Although in their porches thou register their names
in marble: yet they are buried before they are dead.

EPIST. LXI.
Let us study to be amended and changed. Let us think on death, as if always
imminent, and addressed to lay hold on us.

LEt us desist to will that which we would, for mine own^ part, as old as I am,
I endeavor my self not to will that which I would, when I was a child. In this
one thing employ I all my days and nights, this is my only labor, this my
care, to be able to bring mine old evils to an end. I endeavor that one day
may be to me as much as my whole life. And to speak truth, I take it not us
yet as if it were the last, but I regard it, as if it might be last of all my
days that I am to live. I write unto thee this letter with such an
apprehension, as if death should call me, whilst I am writing of it. I am
addressed and ready to depart; and therefore by security enjoy I life, because
I am not much troubled how long it shall last. Before^age I took care that I
might live in mine old years, that I might die well; and to die well^ is to
die willingly. Labor with thy self that thou do nothing unwillingly,
whatsoever is necessary will come to pass, necessity is but to him that
refuses, and not to him that wills. There is no necessity for him that has
a will. I auerre it, that he who willingly submits himself to another man's
command, has fled the most unseasonable and cruellest part of servitude, that
is to say, to do that which he would not do. Not he that upon any command
does any thing, is a miserable man, but he that does it against his will. In
such sort therefore let us compose our minds, that we will that which
necessity requires to be done: and above all things let us think upon our
end, without any show of heaviness. We must sooner prepare our selves to
death, then to life. Life has but overmuch to entertain the same, but we are
they that long after these instruments, that entertain the same. We think,
and so shall we always suppose, that we want somewhat; neither years nor
days shall bring to pass that we have lived sufficiently, but the mind. I
have lived, my dearest Lucilius, as much as suffices, I expect death, as one
glutted with life.

EPIST. LXII.
That neither men or affairs are hindrances to a good mind. The praise of
DEMETRIUS.

THey that would make men believe, that the multitude of affairs is a
hinderance unto them, in the pursuit and search of liberal studies, do
naught else but lie. They pretend and feign occupations, they augment them, and
busy themselves. I am discharged of affairs, my Lucilius, I am discharged,
and whereso^uer I am, I am wholly to my self. For I subject not, but
accommodate my self to affairs. I run not after the occasions which might
make me lose time, and in what place soever I bide, there is it that I
entertain my thoughts, and ruminate some profitable matter in my mind. If I
give my self unto my friends, for all that, forsake I not myself. I stay not
also long time with them, whose company I have entertained for a time, and for
some cause that in duty commanded me. But I am with virtuous men. I send my
thoughts and mind unto them, in what places, and what times soever they have
been. I lead always with me, my Demetrius, the best of men, and leaving a
part these purpurated fellows. I talk with this man half naked, and admire
him. But how should I choose but admire him? He wants nothing. A man may
contemn^ all things, and no man can have all things. The shortest way to riches
is by contempt of riches. But our Demetrius lives in such sort, that he
seems not to have contemned all things, but only to have permitted that
others should enjoy them.

EPIST. LXIII.
A consolatorie Epistle upon the death of a friend, both wise and excellent.

THou art very impatient, because thy ^riend Flaccus is deceased, yet will I
not that thou subject thy self to disordinate sorrow. I dare not exact this at
thy hands, that thou should not grieve, yet know I this, that it is the
better. But to whom is it, that so firm a constancy of mind may happen, but
to him alone, who has trodden fortune under his feet. Yet him also would this
thing trouble and prick, yet would it but only prick. For our selves we may
be pardoned, if we will, in tears, provided that they be not ouer-lauish, and
that we our selves have repressed them. In the loss of a friend, neither let
our eyes be dry, nor ouerflowing; we must shead tears, but not weep
outright. Supposest thou that I subject thee to a rigorous law? When as the
greatest Poet amongst the Greeks gave leave and limit to tears for one day
only, when he said that Niobe also bethought her of her meat. Will thou know
from whence these plaints and immeasurable tears proceed? By tears we seek
the testimony that we bewail them, and we follow not grief, but we show
it. No man is sad to himself. O unhappy folly, there is also some ambition of
grief. What then, say thou, shall I forget my friend? Undoubtedly thou
promisest him a very short remembrance, if it must continue no longer then thy
grief. The least occasion of fortune, will suddenly change the wrinckles of
thy brow into smiles. I grant thee not a more long time, the length whereof
notwithstanding might calm and allay the greatest sorrows of this world, and
make an end of the most bitter griefs. As soon as thou shall cease to flatter
and nourish thy grief, this opinion of sadness will forsake thee; now keep
thou, and entertainest thy sorrow, but how charily soever thou keep it, it
will escape from thee, and the sooner, the more sharper it is. Above all
things, let us labor that the remembrance of our friends which we loose, be
agreeable and pleasing unto us. No man takes pleasure to remember such a
subject, whereon he cannot think without torment, notwithstanding if it
cannot otherwise be, that the name of our friends, whom we have lost, may be
reduced to our memory, without some touch and attaint of sorrow, that very
touch it self has some pleasure in it. For as our Attalus was wont to say;
The memory of our deceased friends is pleasing unto us, no otherwise then the
sowrenesse of old wine, or as apples eager-sweet are tastefull unto us. But
after a little time is ouer-past, all that which tormented us is extinguished,
and then a pure and true pleasure is conceived in our minds, if we will give
credit unto him, to think that our friends are in health, is to eat honey and
cakes. But the memory of those that are deceased can yield no joy, but that
which is intermixed with some little bitterness. But who is he that would deny
that these sharp things, and such as have in them some acrimonie, are not
hurtful and displeasing to the stomach? Yet am not I for all this, of that
opinion. The remembrance of my friends that are deceased, is agreeable and
pleasing unto me. For I had them, as if I were to lose them, and I have lost
them, as if I had them. Do therefore, my Lucilius, that which thy deiscretion
requires. Forbear to give an evil interpr^tation of the benefits of Fortune,
she took away, but she had given. Let us then enjoy our friends with a greedy
desire, because we know not whether they shall continue with us a long time or not. Let us think that we have oftentimes left them, when as we had made some
long voyages, and how oftentimes abiding with them in the same place, we have
not seen them; and we shall find that we have lost more time when they were
alive. But may a man endure those that make no reckoning and account of their
friends when they have them, but bewail them afterward most miserably, and
never love any, but even then when they have lost him? And therefore do they
then more abundantly weep, because they are afraid, left it should grow in
doubt whether they loved them or no. Thus seek they to take testimonies of
their amity. If we have other friends, we do them injury, and conceive an
evil opinion of them, to think that they cannot comfort us as much, as one
only whom we have lost. And if we have not any, we our selves do our selves
greater wrong, then we have received at Fortunes hands. She has only taken
one from us, and we have not made any. Again, he scarcely loved any one, which
could not love more then one. If a man that were robbed, and had lost the only
one coat that he had, had rather bewail his misfortune, then bethink him by
what means he might escape the cold, and find something to cover his
shoulders, would thou not esteene him for a great fool? Thou have buried
him thou louedst, seek now another whom thou may love. It is better to get
a new friend, then to bewail an old. I know well that the thing which I
pretended now to speak is very vulgar, and known unto every man: yet will I
not pretermit it, though all the world has used it. He that by reason and
counsel, could not find an end of his sorrow, met with it in time, but it is
most contemptible for a wiseman to find no remedy for his sorrow, but by
wearying himself with the same. I had rather thou should relinquish thy
sorrow, then that thou should be left by it. Desist from doing that as soon
as thou can; which although thou would thou can not long do. Our
ancestors limited the term of a year for women to mourn in, not that they
should mourn so long; but that they might not mourn longer. To men they
prefixed no distinct time, because no time is honest; yet which of these women
will thou name me, which could scarcely be drawn from the pile where their
husband was burned, or dragged from his dead carcass, whose moans continued
for a whole month? Nothing grows more soon into hatred then grief; which
being new, finds a comforter, and draws some unto him to solace him, but
being inueterate is derided; and not without cause, for either it is fained, or
it is foolish; yet do I write this unto thee, even I, who have immeasurably
bewailed Annaeus Serenus my dear friend, that (which I write with
hearts-griefe) I might be numbered amongst the examples of those, whom sorrow
has overcome. But at this present time I condemn mine own action, and
thoroughly perceive that the greatest cause of my so mourning, was, because I
never thought that I might have died before him. I thought only that he was
younger, and far more young then I, as if the destinies called us by order of
our birth. Let us therefore continually meditate, as well on our own
mortality, as theirs whom we love. Then should I have said: my Serenus is
younger, what is this to the purpose? he must die after me, but he might also
before me: and having not thought hereupon, fortune surprising me on the
sudden, struck me thus. Now know I that all things are mortal, and that they
are mortal, under an uncertain law. That may be done to day, what ever may
be done. Let us think therefore dear Lucilius, that we shall quickly come
thither where he is lodged, whom we so lament for. And happily (if the opinion
of wisemen savor of truth, and any place receive us, he whom we suppose to
have perished is but sent before us.

EPIST. LXIIII.
The praise of QVINTVS SEXTIVS, and then of wisdom it self. That the true
authors thereof are venerable, and that notwithstanding we may add thereunto.

THou were yesterday with us. It may be demanded whether yesterday only, and
therefore I added, with vs^ for thou art always with me. Certain friends came
suddenly to me, upon whose arrival the Chimney smoaked more then it was
accustomed; not that this smoke was of that kind, as that which was wont to
fume from the Kitchins of those that intertaine feasts, or to terrify those
that watch by night; but a little smoke that signified that some guests were
come to me. We had diverse and different discourses, as it happens to those
that sit at banquet, reducing nothing to a resolution; but passing from one
thing to another. Afterward the book of Quintus Sextius the father (a man of
much knowledge if thou will believe, and a Stoicke, although some would deny
it) was read unto us. O good God, how is this man replenished with constancy
and courage: Thou shall not find the like amongst all the Philosophers. Some
men's writings have only a goodly title, the rest of them are without life, they
make institutio^s, they dispute, and cavil, they add no courage, because they
have none. When thou have read Sextius, thou will say he lives, he is full of
vigor, he is free, he is more then a man. He leaves me always replenished
with great assurance. Howsoever my mind be disposed^ if I read him (I will
confess unto thee) I am addressed to provoke all casualties, and freely to
exclaim. Why ceasest thou Fortune? Come and encounter me, thou shall and do
see me in a readiness. I cloth my self in his courage which serves for a
subject, against which he may approve, and where he may expres^e his virtue. He
wishes freely that he might behold
A foaming Boar amidst his idle fold,
Or some stern Lion from the hills descend,
With golden crest his cattle to offend.
I desire to have somewhat that I may overcome. I will suffer to exercise my
patience^ for Sextius likewise has this admirable quality in him, that he
will show thee the excellency of a happy life, and will not put thee out of hope
to ob^^ine the same. Thou shall know that she is lodged in a place very high,
notwithstanding a man that has will, may mount thereunto. Amongst all other
things, only virtue may give thee the same, that thou may admire thereat,
without losing thy hope to attain the same. Truly the only contemplation of
wisdom, very oftentimes robs me of very much time. I behold the same with
no less astonishment, then I do the heavens and the world, on which I
oftentimes cast mine eyes, as if I had never seen the same: therefore is it
that I reverence and honor the intentions of wisdom, and the inuerters also:
It delights me to go and take possession thereof, as of an heritage common
unto many. These things are gotten, these things are labored for me. But let
us pl^y the part of a good ^ather of a family: let us increase that inheritage
which was left us, and let this possession descend to my posterity, in more
ample manner then I received it from mine ancestors. Much there is that as yet
remains to be done, and much more shall remain: for after the revolution of
a thousand ages, the occasion shall never be left to them that are borne
hereafter, to add somewhat. And although antiquity has invented all things,
yet the use, the science, and disposition thereof, which has been invented,
shall always remain new. Put case we had some medicines left unto us for the
healing of eyes, I need not seek for other; yet are these to be fitted both to
the diseases, and to the times: by one of them the heat of the eyes is
extinguished, by another the thickness of the eyelids is attenuated; by one a
sudden flux of humor and rhum^ is diuerted, by another the sight is quickened.
It behooves thee to grind these remedies, and allay them well, to make choice
of the time, and that thou observe a measure in every one of them. The
remedies of the mind were invented by our ancients, but it behooves us to
seek, how and when they should be applied. They that lived before us have done
much, but they have not finished the same. Yet must we honor them, and
reverence them as Gods. But why should I not have the Images of these virtuous
and great men in my house, to kindle and quicken up my spirit? And why should I
not celebrate their birth-dayes? Why should I not name them always for honors
sake? That veneration that I owe to my Masters, the same owe I to these Masters
of mankind^ from whom the beginnings of so many benefits are flowen. If I see
either a Consul or a Praetor, I will do all that which is usually done in
yielding them honor and reverence, I will light off my horse, I will put off my
hat, and give him the way: why then can I remember both the Catoes, wise
Laelius, Socrates, Plato, Zeno and Cleanthes, without some great
acknowledgement of honor? Truly I reverence them, and hearing the greatness
of these names, I always arise to yield them honor.

EPIST. LXV.
He entreats of the search of natural things, Of cause and matter, and
teaches how much they are profitable, if they be moderately handled, and to a
good end, that is of life: by these lifts he up his mind to God and honesty.

I Divided yesterday into two parts; the one was for my self, the other for my
sickness, which usurped all the fore-noone to it self, and left the afternoon
for me: for which cause I first of all assayed the forces of my spirit in
reading some book. But I saw that he took pleasure herein^ I grew bold to
command him far more, yea, I permitted him. I wrote therefore something with
a greater care then I was accustomed, whilst I contend with a difficult matter,
and will not be overcome, until such time as some of my friends came in unto
me, who withdrew me perforce, and reprehended me for a man intemperate in the
time of my sickness. In stead of writing^ some discourse was set abroach,
whereof I will relate unto thee that part which is in question, wherein thou art
made Vmpeire. Thou have more business in hand then thou thoughtest of.
Certain it is, that there are three causes, and the Stoics, as thou know,
say, that there are two things in nature, whereof all other things are made,
The Cause and the Matter: the matter remains idle; yet prepared to all
things, which will not stir, except it be moved. But the Cause, that is to
say the reason, forms the matter, and turns it which way soever he list,
and produces out of it diverse works. There must be then some thing, whereof a
thing may be made, and after that a means by which it is made. This is the
Cause, that the Matter. All arts are the imitation of Nature; and therefore
all that which I have said of the world, may be transferred to these, which are
to be made by man. A statue had a matter that should receive the workmanship,
and an artizan that should give form unto the matter. Therefore in the statue
the matter was brass, and the cause the workman: all other things are of the
same and alike condition. They take their Essence from that whereof they are
made, and of him which makes them. The Stoics say that there is but only one
cause, namely that which makes. But Aristotle says, that the cause may be
said after three manners. The first cause, says he, is the matter it self,
without which nothing may be made: the second is the workman: the third is the
form, that is annexed to any work whatsoeeuer as upon a statue: for Aristotle
calls it (...), that is to say, an Image. There is yet another (says he)
which is annexed for the fourth, which is the design and intention of the
whole worke^ I will tell thee more plainly what it is: The Brass is the first
cause of the statue; for it had never been made, if that whereof it was
founded and drawn had not been. The second cause is the workman: for this
Brass could not have fashioned it self into the form of a statue, if some
skillful artist had not been employed therein. The third cause is the form;
for neither should this statue be called Doriphoras or Diadumenus, except this
form had been expressed in the same. The other fourth cause is, the purpose
and intention wherefore it was made; for without it^ it had not been made. And
what is this intention? It is the same that invited the work-master, that it is
which he followed: it is then either silver, if he made i^ to sell^ or glory,
if he made it for reputation; or his devotion and pi^tie, if he would give it
for a present to a Temple. This fourth cause then is that for which it is made.
Think thou that amongst the causes of a wo^k which has been made, that we
ought not to count that without which it could not be made? To these does Plato
annex a ^i^t, which he calls Idea^ for this is the example or pattern, on
which the workman casting his eyes, does that which he had destinated and
determined to do; and it skilleth not whether he have his patte^ne abroad
whereunto he refers his eye, or within, in his fancy which he has
conceived and placed in himself. God has the patterns and examples of all
things in himself. He has conceived in his understanding the members and
fashions of all that which should be made by him: he is full of all those
forms and figures, which Plato calls Ideas^ which are immortal, immutable,
and indefatigable. So that although men die, yet humaniti^ upon which man is
made, remains: and although men become sick, and do die, yet that suffers
nothing. There are then five causes according to Plato; That whereof, that by
which, that whereby, that whereto, and that wherefore. In the last place^ in
the work which is made of these things, as in a statue (because of it w^ have
begun to speak) that whereof is the brass, that by which is the workman, that
whereby is the form that is given unto it, that whereto is the pattern which
the workman imitateth, that wherefore is the design and intention of him that
made it, and that which is composed of all these is the statue. All these
things the world has also, as Plato says. The workman is God, that which is
made is the matter, and the form is the fashion, and the order which we see in
this world^ the pattern and example is that whereon God has formed the
greatness of this fair work; the intention is the design for which he made
it. Ask thou me what Gods intention was? His goodness. Truly Plato says
so. What cause had God to make the world? He is good^ he has made good things.
He that is good enuieth not any thing which is good: and therefore he has m^de
the best that he could. Give now thy judgment hereupon, and pronounce who he
is, that in thy opinion has most nearly aimed at the truth, not who has said
the truth, for that is far beyond our apprehension, as the truth it self. But
this great multitude of causes, set down by Aristotle and Plato, either
comprehend over much or too little. For if they think that the cause to make a
thing, be all that without which nothing may be made, they have set down too few
causes; they should nominate time, for nothing can be done without time; they
should set down place, for if there be not a place where a thing should be
done, it cannot be made. They should put down motion^ without which nothing is
made, nothing perishes: moreover, there is not any art or change without
motion. But here seek we the first and general cause. This should be wholly
simple, because the matter is simple. We ask what this cause is? It is the
reason that makes, that is to say God. And by this reason that I told you,
there are not diverse and particular causes; but they depend wholly upon one,
that is on that which makes. Thou say that form likewise is one of the
causes, and that it is it which the workman puts upon his work: it is a
part but not a cause. The pattern also or example is not a cause, it is a
necessary instrument of the cause, so is the pattern necessary to the
workman, as the polishing iron, or the fyle, for without them art can profit
nothing: yet are they not parties, or causers of the art. The intention of the
workman (says he) for which he undertakes to make any thing is a cause; yet
though it were a cause it should not be efficient but accessarie. Now these
causes are innumerable, but we dispute of a general cause: undoubtedly they
have not spoken with their accustomed subt^lty, when they have said that this
whole world and this work so well finished, was the cause: for there is a
great difference betwixt the work and the cause of the work. Pronounce then
thy sentence, or say (as it is more ^asie in matters that are doubtful) that
this question is not yet in state to (...) judged, and so dismiss us. Thou will say unto me, what pleasure do thou conceive in lo^ing thy time after
these things, which cannot disburthen thee of any passion, not master any
covetousness? For mine own part, first of all I discourse of that which may
settle my mind in repose, and I rather enquire after my self then the world
or this Universe Doing this I loose not my time as thou think. For all these
discourses, if they be not cut off, if they be not drawn to unprofitable
subtilties, do an^mate and raise the mind, which feeling it self pressed with
a heavy burden, desires naught else but to deliver her self, and to return
to those places where she has been. For this body is but a burden and
prison of the soul. She is wearied with the burden, she is in bondage, if
Philosophy come not to succor her. But she has commanded her to breathe in
the contemplation of nature, and has permitted her to forsake the earth, and
annex her self to divine things. This is the liberty she has, this is her
refectorie; mean while she issues out of prison where she is d^tained, and
goes to recreate her self in heaven. Even as worke^men, who have long time
held their eyes fixed upon any subtle work, and wearied them thereupon,
especially if they labor in some obscure place, and with little light, go out
into the open air, and seek out some public place, where the people are
accustomed to disport themselves, and recreate their sight in the clear light
of the day^ so the mind, imprisoned in this dark and obscure receptacle, as
often as it may, seeks liberty, and reposeth it self in the contemplation of
the works of nature. A wiseman, and he that follows wisdom, is in some sort
tied to his body, but is absent from the same in his best part, and addresseth
his best thoughts to high and sublime matters, and as if he had taken the oath
of a soldier, he makes account, that the time that his life lasts is his
pay or wages: and in such sort is he reformed and resolved, that he bears
neither love nor hatred to his life, and patiently suffers all transitory
things, although he know that a greater good remains hereafter. Would
thou interdict me the contemplation of all things in nature, and retiring me
wholly, restrain me to one only thing? Shall I not search what the beginnings
of all things are? Who it is that formed them? Who it was that distinguished
all that which was confuse, and mixed in a mass in a matter idle and
immovable? Shall I not seek who it was that made this world? By what wisdom
this incredible greatness of the Universe has received his laws and his
order? Who it is that has gathered together so many things that were
scattered? Who has separated those that were confused? Who has divided the
beauty amongst those things which were hidden under an abject deformity?
Whence comes this so great light? Is it fire, or any thing more resplendent
then fire? Should I not enquire after these things? Shall I not know whence I
descended? or whether I shall see them but once or diverse times? Shall I not
know whither I must return, and what place attends my soul, after it shall
be delivered from this humane servitude? Will thou hinder me from mounting to
heaven, that is to say, Will thou command me to live abiectly? I am more great,
and borne for greater things, then to be a slave to my body, over which I
never fix mine eyes, but as on the chains that hold me prisoner, and
restrain me from my liberty. It is my body which I expose to Fortune, to
withstand her assaults: I permit not any wound to pass thereon, that may
afflict my soul. All that which may subject it self, or suffer injury in me,
is but this prison of mine, abject and slavish; the soul that remains
therein is free. Never can this flesh of mine make me partake any fear, nor
use any cowardice, vnderualuing a good man, nor to lie to do honor to this
miserable body. When it pleases me, I will break the company I have with
him. And now although we are united together, we will not be companions upon
equal terms. The soul will say that all appertains to her. The contempt
of her body is her true liberty. But to return to my purpose. Truly the
contemplation of that we spoke of late, may serve very much to this liberty.
That is to say, that all things are composed of matter and of God. God
governs all these things, which being spread round about him, follow their
Governor and their Chief. And God, who is he that makes, is more powerful
then the matter which suffers the form that God will give unto it. The same
place that God obtains in the world, the same has the soul in the body.
That which the matter is to God, the same is the body to us. The Inferior
therefore ought to enjoy the Superior. Let us be firm and constant against
Fortune, and let us not fear or tremble at injuries, wounds, imprisonment or
poverty. What is death? Either it is the end, or a passage: neither fear I to
cease to be, for it is the same, as if I had never been, nor to pass, because
in no place shall I be lodged more straightly.

EPIST. LXVI.
That CLARANVS is old, but lively, and that in body he was deformed, but in
mind honest. He cares not for the house wherein he dwells. The diffence of
goods among the Stoics, and that all things are equal. What then? Are joy and
patience the same? They are so in regard of virtue, not of matter. And that
external things also give not any augmentation of good. These things handles
he copiously, distinctly and excellently. O let us read it, and apply the same.

I Have seen Claranus my companion in study, whom of long time before I had
not seen. Thou expectest not, in my opinion, that I should tell thee he is
old, but at least as yet has he his spirits lively and vigorous, and such as
strive with his little body. To speak the truth, Nature has done amiss^, to
lodge so fair a mind in so foul an hostrie. Or else, it may be, she had an
intent to teach us, that the strongest and blessedest mind might hide it self
under any skin, whatsoeuer^ Yet has he overcome all impediments, and through
the contempt of himself has he attained ^o far, as to contemn all other
things. In my opinion, he deceived himself, that said, Virtue is far more
gracious, getting place
Under the convert of a comely face.
For she has no need of any foreign ornament, she deriueth her dignity from
her self, and makes the body which she possesses, holy and sacred. Truly I
began to behold my friend Claranus very nearly, and in my judgment he
seems very fair, and as well learned in body, as confirmed in mind. A
great man may issue from a sheepe-coate, and a virtuous and fair soul may be
closed in a deformed and base body. And Nature, in my opinion, expressly
causes some to be borne after this manner, to make us see, that virtue may be
lodged in all places, if possibly she could have brought forth naked souls,
she would have done it. But now does she far more disproportioned in
nature, notwithstanding overcome these impediments. Claranus, as I suppose, was
made to serve for a pattern, and to let us see, that the soul cannot be
defiled by the deformity of the body, and that the body may receive ornam^nt
by the beauty of the soul. But although we have remained very few day^s
together, yet notwithstanding diverse discourses passed between us, which I
will orderly digest, and afterward send unto thee. The first day the question
was, how goods should be equal, since there was a threefold condition of
them. Some of these goods, as our Philosophers say, are placed in the first
rank, namely, joy, peace, and felicity of the Country. The other are in the
second, which never make themselves known, but in a miserable subject, as
patience in the midst of torments, and temperance in a great sickness. We
desire that the first should befall us every day, and the second when need
requires. There is also a third sort, as to walk modestly and gravely, to
carry a modest countenance, and use the gestures and behauiours of a wise man.
How is it then, that these goods may be equal among themselves, since we are
to desire the one, and depart from the other? If we will distinguish, let us
return to the first, and consider what it is. A soul that fixes his eyes
upon the truth, that knows that which she ought to eschew or desire, that
priseth all things, not by opinion, but by the laws of Nature, that
intermixeth it self a midst this great universe, and ^ixeth her contemplation
upon the effects thereof, that is, incessantly occupied in thinking and doing,
that is, as great as she is vehement, that suffers not her self to be
overcome, neither by adverse, or pleasing things, that submits not, neither
to the one nor to the other fortune, that is, eminent above all things that may
happen or befall her, that is, fair with a good grace, that has her strength
accompanied with health and sobriety, that is, never affrighted nor
astonished, whom no violence can shake, whom Fortune cannot raise or depresse.
Such is the virtue of the soul, such is her face, if she might express her
self at once, and might wholly and at once discover her self to our sight:
yet many differences has she in her self, which discover themselves in the
diversity of life, and his actions; and yet becomes she neither more great
nor more small then she is. For the sovereign good may not decrease, neither
has virtue power to go back-ward, yet changes she in diverse qualities, and
conformeth her self according to the habit of those things she will do. She
changes and trans^igureth into her likeness all that which she touches; she
makes the actions, amities, and sometime whole houses where she enters, and
which she has under her government, honorable: all that which she manageth,
she makes amiable, admirable, and resplendent; and therefore her force and
greatness cannot be raised higher, because that which is greatest cannot receive
increase. Thou shall find nothing more just, then that which is just, nothing
more true, then that which is true; nothing more temperate, then that which is
temperate. Constancy finds nothing that may advance it, no more then
Confidence, verity, or Faith. What thing is that, which may be added to a
perfect thing? Nothing nor if any thing might be annexed, it is not perfect:
therefore not to Virtue also, for if any thing might be annexed, it were
deficient. Honesty also cannot receive any augmentation. For honesty is in
the same rank with other things, which I have spoken of But what shall we say
of that which is decent, of that which is just, and of that which is lawful?
Think thou not that they are of the same form, and comprehended under
certain limits. To have power to increase, is a sign of an imperfect thing.
All sorts of good are subject to the same laws, the private and public pro^it
are joined together, and truly inseparable in such sort, that one may not
separate that which is praise-worthie, from that which is to be desired.
Virtues therefore are equal and alike between themselves, as also their
effects are, and all men to whom they befall. But the virtues of vegitables and
living creatures, because they are mortal, frail; fluxible, and uncertain,
arise and fall, and therefore are they not esteemed in the same reckoning. But
humane virtues have but one only measure. For there is but one right and
simple reason. Nothing is more divine then that which is diuined, nor more
celestial then that which is celestial. As touching mortal things, we see
that they are sometimes high, sometimes low, that sometimes they are abased and
increased, exhausted and replenished. And therefore in so uncertain a
condition they are unequal; but things that are divine, are of the same
nature. But reason is no other thing but a part of the divine spirit, infused
and plunged in our humane bodies: if therefore reason be divine, and that there
is not any good without reason, all goods of what kind soever are divine; but
there is no difference betwixt divine things, therefore not between goods. Joy
therefore, and a stout and obstinat sufferance in torments are equal, for in
both there is the same greatness of mind, but in the one more remiss and
relenting, in the other more withstanding and intent. What? think thou not
his virtue is great, that s^outly enters his enemies city, as his that
patiently sustaineth the siege? Scipioes courage is great, which holds
Num^ntia, so closely besieged and beleagred, that constrained that invincible
nation, to make away themselves by their own hands: and great is the mind of
of those besieged, that know that nothing is shut up from him to whom death is
open, and that expireth in the embracing of his liberty. The like equal are
the rest also among themselves, tranquillity, simpliciticy, liberality
constancy, equanimity, sufferance: for in all these, there is but one virtue
that makes the mind upright and immutable. What then? is there no difference
betwixt joy and the inflexible patience of pains: none at all in regard of the
virtues themselves, much in respect of those things, in which both the virtues
are exemplified. For in the one there appearth a recreation and repose of
spirit, in the other a grief contrary to nature. These subjects then are the
means, which receive between them a great difference. But the virtue is
equal both in the one, and in the other. The matter changes not the virtue.
That which is distastefull and difficult cannot make it worse, neither that
which is joyful and agreeable better. It follows then, that both the one and
the other of these goods are equal. For this man cannot bear himself more
virtuously in his joy, nor the other in his torments, and truly two things in
which nothing may be bettered, are equal. For if those things which are placed
out of virtue, either can diminish or increase the same, that cease to be one
good which is honest. If thou grant this, all honesty perishes. Why? I will
tell thee: Because there is nothing honest, that is, done either by an
unwilling man, or by him that is enforced: all honesty is voluntary; if thou
mix with it slothfulness, complaints, refusals, and fear, he has lost all
that is good in it self, to please himself. It cannot be honest, which is not
free, for that which fears is in bondage. But that which is honest is equally
assured, and full of peace and repose. If he refuses any thing, if he weepeth,
if he judges that it is evil, he enters into some perturbation, and
feels a great discord in his soul. For on the one side, the appearance of
good calls him, and on the other the fear of evil retireth him. Thus he
that will do any thing with honor, ought to judge, that nothing of that which
opposes it self against his will, is evil, although it be incommodious. All
that which is honest, ought to be effected, without another man's command or
constraint. It is pure and sincere, and no ways intermedled with any other
evil. I know well what a man may answer me here. Thou endeuourest to
persuade us this, that there is no difference whether any man be in joy, or lie
in torture, and weary his executioner. I might answer that which Epicurus
says, That a wise man would cry out with a loud voice, although he were ^o
asted in Phalaris bull: O how sweet is this torment, and how little
appertains it to me? Why wonderest thou, if I say, that the good of him that
is seated in the midst of a banquet, and of that other, which remains and
stands firm and constant amiddest the torments, are equal, whereas (which
is far more incredible) Epicurus says) that it is a sweet thing to be
tortured. But I answer thereunto, that there is a great difference betwixt joy
and dolor. For if I should be put to my choice, I would demand the one, and
fly the other: the one is amicable to Nature, the other is contrary. As long
as they are esteemed after this rate, they are very different between
themselves: but when we come unto virtue, both the one and the other are
equal, as well that which makes his way by joy, as the other that makes it
by sorrow. Vexation, grief, and whatsoever other incommoditie are of no
moment, for they are surmounted by Virtue. Even as the clearenes of the Sun
extinguisheth the lesser lights: even so pains, afflictions and injuries, are
dissipated and abated by virtue; which, in what place soever she shines,
extinguisheth all that which appears not to be enlightened by her. And those
pains and incommodities that fall upon virtue, have no more power over her,
then a little rain over the sea. But to the end thou may believe that this
is true, a good man will run without any cunctation to every fair thing,
although the hangman be there, the torture be prepared, the fire be enkindled,
he perseuereth, he will not bethink him of that he must suffer, but on that
which he ought to do. He will cast himself upon an honest thing, as betwixt
the arms of a good man, he will make account that it is profitable, assured,
and full of good hap. An honest thing therefore shall have the same place and
credit with him, although it be heavy and troublesome, as a good man should
have, although he were poor, banished and sick. Well then, set me on one side
a good man full of riches, and on the other side, one that has nothing at all,
and yet notwithstanding, has all things in himself; the one shall be as good
a man as the other, although their fortunes be different. The same reckoning
ought a man to make in all things, as he does of men: Virtue is as laudable in
a healthful and free body, as in a sick and imprisoned. Thy virtue then
shall be no less praiseworthie, if Fortune has conserved thy body in health,
and without harm, then if it were maimed in some member. Otherwise it were to
praise the Master by his men's liueries. For all these things on which Fortune
exercises her power are base and servile, as are riches, the body and honors,
they are weak, frail, mortal, and possessed with uncertainty. Contrariwise,
the works of virtue are free and invincible, the which are not to be wished
for more, when they are sauoured by any flattering fortune, nor less also when
they are followed with some disaster. That which we call friendship toward
men, is a desire and covetousness toward good things. I suppose thou would
not rather prise a good rich man for his wealth; then thou would do a poor
man, nor a strong and migh^tie man, then a feeble and weak man. By the same
reason, thou would not rather wish a fair and peaceable thing, then that
thing which is painful and laborious. And if it be so of the two that should
be equally good, thou had rather like of him that should be neat and
perfumed, then him that should be slouenly and vncombed: In fine, thou would
come thus far, that thou would more love a man that were complete in all
his members, that had never been hurt, then a weak and spur-blinde fellow.
Briefly, by little and little thy disdain would increase so far, that of the
two that should be equally sage and just, thou had rather have him that
were fair locked and frisled, then him that is disguised and balde. When the
virtue both of the one and the other is equal, the inequality of other things
appears not. Because all these other things are not parts, they are but
accessaries. For who is he that would make so iniust an esteem amongst his
children, that he would make better reckning of him that were whole, then of
him that were sick: of him that were great and high of stature, more then of
him that were low and little? Wild beas^s distinguish not their young ones,
they couch themselves on the ground to nourish them altogether: birds do
equally distribute their meat to their young Ulysses makes as great have to
see his rocks of Ithaca, as Agamemnon his noble walls of Mecaenae. For no man
loves his country because it is great, but because it is his own. But
whereto tend these things? To the end that thou may know, that virtue
carries an equal eye and regard on all her works, as on her proper children,
that she loves all of them alike, and those far more tha feel any pain,
because the love of fathers extends more toward those, on whom they have
most compassion. In like manner virtue bears not less affection to those her
works, which she sees suffer more affliction and torment, but following the
custom of good parents, she embraces and cherishes them the more. But why is
it that one good cannot be greater then another? Because there is nothing more
apt then that which is apt, nor nothing more full then that which is full. Thou
can not say that this is more like unto a thing then that, consequently there
is nothing more honest then that which is honest. So then, if the nature of
virtue be all alike, all the three sorts of goods are equal. And therefore I
say that it is all one to be moderate in joy, and moderate in pain. Joy
surmounteth not the constancy of the soul, that deuoureth his complaints
under the cruelty of a hangman. The one of these goods are to be desired, the
other to be admired; yet both of them are equal: for all that which is ill is
covered under the cloak of a more great good. He that should be of an opinion
that these two things were not equal, he should show that he would never cast
his eyes upon virtue, and that he only regarded exterior things. True goods
have the same weight and greatness, both the one and the other. But the false
are vain and deceivable. Therefore it is that those goods that seem so fair
and so great to the exterior eye, deceive us when they are brought to their
touch and weight. This is true, my Lucilius, all that which reason and virtue
praises and priseth, it is firm, it is eternal, it makes the soul assured,
and lifts it up to heaven, to remain there everlastingly. But the goods
which we commend without reason, and that have their only being in vulgar
judgment, do but fill them with wind, that revive in them. Contrariwise,
that which a man fears as evil, does but affright our minds, and terrify
the same no otherwise then apprehension of some danger troubles beasts. All
these things then do recomfort the soul, or torment it without reason: for
neither is the one worthy of any joy, nor the other of any fear. There is
naught but only reason, which is immutable and constant in her judgment; for
she obeys not, but commands the senses. Reason is equal with reason, as
right to that which is right. Virtue then is the like; for she is naught else
but right reason. All virtues are rightful reasons, if they be rightful they
are equal. Such as the reason is, such are the actions. Therefore all are
equal: for since they are like unto reason, they are also like between
themselves. And those actions term I equal between themselves, which are
upright and honest. But yet they shall be much different, by reason of the
varying of the matter, which is now more ample, now more sparing, now more
worthy, now more ignoble, now pertaining to many, now unto few. And
notwithstanding in all those things, that which is the best is equal. Even as
amongst good men, all are equal as they are good men, yet have they some
differences in age, the one is elder, the other younger; they have difference
in body, the one is fair, the other deformed; they differ in fortune, this is
rich, that is poor: he is gracious, powerful, known to Cities and Nations,
this unknown to many and obscure. But in that they are good, they are equal.
The sense judges not of good and evil: it knows what is profitable, and is
ignorant of that which is unprofitable: he cannot give his advice, but of that
which is represented before his eyes: he cannot foresee those things that are
to come to pass, neither have remembrance of that which is forepassed; less
knows he that which may ensue: notwithstanding, thereupon depends the order
and success of things, and all the constancy of life, which should be right
and perfect. Reason then is it that judges of good and evil, that makes no
account of foreign matters, which come externally, and that thinks that
those things which are neither good nor evil, to be some small and light
increasing^ all good to him is in the mind. Moreover, there are certain things
which she places in the first rank, to which she purposely comes, as to a
victory, to wise children and well borne, and the health of his country.
There are other goods of the second degree, which are not known but in
adversities, as to suffer a sickness or banishment patiently. And certain
other indifferent, which nevertheless are more friendly then contrary to
nature: as to walk modestly, and to keep a grave countenance when a man
sits. For it is a thing as natural to sit as to stand, or to walk. But the
two first are much different the one from the other; for the first are
according to nature, that is to say, to rejoice at the piety of his children,
and the felicity of his country. The second are against nature; to sustain
torments with a great constancy and endure thirst, when as the infirmity
burns the entrails. What shall it then be? Is there any thing contrary to
nature that may be called good? No truly. But this good is often found in a
thing which is enemy to nature: for to be hurt, to be dried and consumed in
the fire, to be afflicted with a sickness is against nature, but to conserve
a man's soul in such harmony, that she is not wearied to suffer torments, this
is friendly to nature. What is reason then? It is an imitation of nature. What
is man's chiefest good? It is to do all things according to natures will. It is
undoubted (says he) that a peace which has never been interrupted, is better
then that which has been gotten with effusion of blood. There is no doubt
(says he) but that health which never has been shaken, is better and more
happy, then that we have recovered perforce, and by a long patience of a
sickness that threatened us with death: In like manner it is not to be
doubted, but that joy is a greater good, then a soul subject to suffer
torments, wounds, and fire, yet are these things nothing. For those things that
happen casually receive a great difference, because they are esteemed by the
pro^ite of those that receive them. The intention and end of good men is to
consent unto nature. She is equal in all. When as the whole Senate follows
the opinion of one man: a man cannot say, This man is better advised then the
other; for all of them have followed that opinion. I say the same by virtues;
all of them consent unto nature: I say the same by good men; all o^ them
consent unto nature. One is dead young, another old: some one moreover is dead
in infancy, that has enjoyed no other good then to have the only sight of
life: all these were equally subject to die, although death has suffered some
of them to live more long, and that to others she has cut off the thread of
life, even in the flower of their age, and has interrupted the beginnings and
birth of some other. One dies in the midst of his supper, to another his
sleep and death has been but one, and some also have been strangled amiddest
the embraces of their minions. Add also to these, those that are dead by the
sword, or have been slaughtered by the sting of Serpents, or that have been
crushed to death under some ruin, or that are dead through a long conuulsion
of their sinews, that by little and little has tortured them. A man may say
that the end of some is better, and of others is worse. But the death of them
all is equal. The means whereby they come thereunto are diverse; but the point
where they ended is but one. There is not any death more great, the one then
the other: for she has one and the same measure in all persons, that is to put
an end to life. I say the like of goods; one of these goods nourishes it
self, betwixt pleasures and delights, and the other seals nothing but
adversities and disasters. Some one has governed at his pleasure the sweetness
of a good fortune, and another has ever borne the force of a tyranny: yet
both the one and the other goods are wholly equal, although the one has not
martched but by plain and easy paths, and the other by places both tedious
and dangerous. In brief, the end of all is wholly a like. They are goods, they
are praiseworthy, they follow virtue and reason: virtue makes all things
equal amongst themselves, which she acknowledges. It behooves thee not,
amongst those opinions which I hold, to wonder hereat. In Epicurus opinion
there are two sorts of goods, whereof this happy and sovereign good is
composed, which are, that the body be without pain, and the soul without
passion and perturbation. Th^se goods increase not when they are complete: for
which way may that increase which is full? The body is without grief; what
may be added to this indolencie? The soul is peaceable, and in assured repose;
what may be added to this tranquillity? Even as the clear sky and the heaven
appearing in his brightness cannot r^ceiue any more accomplished beauty: so
the estate of a man that has care of his body and of his soul, and will
compound his good by the means, both of the one and the other, is wholly
perfect; it has attained the fullness of his desire, if he feels no tempest
in his soul, nor trouble in his body. If any other foreign contentments
befall us, they augment not any ways this sovereign good, but in a sort
season the same, and make it pleasing. For this entirely perfect good of humane
nature, contenteth it self with the placabilitie of body and soul: I will
allege you from Epicurus himself, a division of goods wholly like unto ours.
For there are some with him that he had rather should happen unto him, that is
to say the repose of the body, free from all pain, and the contentment of the
soul that may rejoice in the contemplation of her goods. There are others
which he praises and approves, although he could not wish, they should befall
him, as that patience which I spoke of late in a great sickness, and extreme
dolours, which Epicurus supposed his last and fortunatest day of his life. For
he said that he suffered torments in his bladder and in his vlcerated belly,
which could not receive a more great increase of dolor. And yet he esteemed
that day the most happy. But nothing can make a man happy, but him that
enjoys the sovereign good. There is then amidst Epicurus goods, such as thou
would not feel: but since fortune wills that it must be so, we must
embrace, prise, and praise the same as the greatest goods. A man cannot say but
that the good which has given a period to a happy life; and for which
Epicurus in his last words, has given thanks, is not even and equal with
the greatest goods. Permit me yet further, my Lucilius, to speak more boldly
to thee: if any goods may be greater then others, I had rather follow those
that were displeasant, then those that are gracious and delicate. For it is
more honor to overcome such things as are difficult, then to moderate those
that are joyful. I know well by the same reason that it may be effected, that
some one may entertain his felicity modestly, and his calamity constantly.
As valiant ought he to be esteemed that has all night stood Sentinel in the
Trenches, although the enemy has not sallied to force the Camp, as he that
after his legs have been cut off, has entertained the combat on his knees,
and has never forsaken his weapons. We say to those that ordinarily return
from the field, conquered with blood, God increase your virtue. Therefore it is
that I would always praise those goods far more continually, which are
become constant by a continual exercise, and that have combated against
fortune. Should I make doubt rather to praise that roasted and maimed hand of
Mutius, then the most healthsomest hand of the most valiant man that is he
stood upright, contemning his enemies and the flames, he beheld his hand that
consumed and dropped through his enemies Torch, until at last Porsena envied
the glory of him, at whose grief in the beginning he took pleasure, and
caused to his great disgust, the sire to be taken from him. Why should I not
account this good amiddest the first and principal? Why should I not esteem
it far more then those, which some enjoy in so much security, without fear
of fortune, since it is a thing more rare to have overcome an enemy with a
dried and wasted hand, then with a whole and well armed? But why, will thou
say, would thou desire this good? Wherefore not? for there is not any one
can do the like^ but he that can wish the same. Should I wish rather to yield
my feet to be softly rubbed by one of mine old varlets, or to some woman, or
to some one that from a man should become a woman, to stretch the joints of my
little toes? Why should I not think Mutius more happy for managing the fire,
in such sort as if he had stretched out his hand to any man^ to rub him
softly? He salued all the offense he had done, he made an end of the war
disarmed and lame, and with that maimed hand he overcame two Kings.

EPIST. LXVII.
After his small Preface, a question whether every good is to be wished for. He
says that it is, yea even that whose matter is in evils. As to be constantly
burned, sick, and whipped. Neither is the burning it self, a sickness, nor
the whipping, but that, says he; is to be wished for, to suffer the same
stoutly and constantly. Again, that Ver^ues are united together, and as one,
so all. These also are worthy and befitting a stout and real Stoic.

TO the end that I make the beginning of my letter, with those things that are
common: the spring began to open it self, but as if it approached already
toward Summer, and at such time as it should be hot, it waxed warm. Neither
as yet is it to be trusted, for oftentimes it returns to Winter. Will thou
know how unassured it is? As yet I dare not adventure to bath my self in cold
water, as yet do I temper the cold thereof. This is, say thou, not to
suffer either heat or cold. So it is, my Lucilius, mine age is contented enough
with his coldness, that scarcely may be thawed in the midst of summer. And
therefore for the most part of the time, I lie couched on my mattresse. I
thank mine age that has tied me to my couch. And why should I not give it
thanks for this? All that which I should not will, I cannot act. My greatest
discourse is with my books: if at any time thy Epistles come between, me
thinks I am with thee, and so am I affected in mind, as if I did not write
back unto thee, but answered thee face to face. And therefore will I entreat
of that which thou demandest of me, as if I spoke with thee. We will both of us
examine what this question is. Thou will have me t^ll thee whether every good
be to be destred. If it be good, say thou to endure torments courageously
and to suffer the fire with a great constancy, and to endure a sickness
peaceably: it follows that all that is to be desired, and yet see I nothing
in it, that is worthy to be wished. Truly, as yet know I not any man, that
has paid any vow he has made for being beaten with whips, or made lame by
the gout, or made longer by the rack. Thou must, my Lucilius, make a
distinction of these things, and then shall thou find that there is some point
which may be wished for. I could well wish that torments should be always
estranged from me: but when of force I must needs feel the same, then would I
wish that I might endure them virtuously, courageously, and honorably. Why
should I not rather wish, that the war^e should never happen? But if it be
proclaimed and begun, then would I wish, that with a generous courage I might
suffer wounds, famine, and all that which the necessity of war brings with
it. I am not so foolish, as that I would desire to be sick, but if it must so
fall out, I would desire also that I might not do any thing intemper^tely, or
effeminately. So the evils and incommodities are not to be desired, but the
virtue whereby incommodities are suffered. Some of our Stoics think, that the
constancy and patience in torments and evils, neither ought to be desired nor
detested. For when a man wishes, he ought to desire a thing wholly peaceable,
pure, and exempt from sorrowes^ But I am not of their opinion. Wherefore?
Because it cannot be that a thing should be good, and should not be desired.
Furthermore, if virtue is to be desired, and if there be not any good without
virtue, it follows that all good is to be desired. Again, if a constant
patience in torments should not be desired. I ask thee again, is not
Fortitude to be wished for? But she contemns and provoke all perils. The
fairest and most admirable part that is in it, is not to fly from any flames,
and to present himself to wounds, and sometimes not to avoid them, but to
open his breast to receive them. If then fortitude is to be desired, and
patience in suffering torments is to be wished for, (for this is a part of
fortitude) but separate these things, as I said, there shall be nothing that
shall deceive thee. For to suffer torments, is not to be wished for, but to
suffer them courageously. That courage wish I for, which is a virtue. Yet who
ever wished this to himself? Some vows are open and professed, when they are
particularly made: some are obscured, when as many things are comprehended in
one vow. As when I desire an honest life, but an honest life consists of
diverse actions. In this is Regulus tomb, Catoes wound rent open by his own
hands. R^tilius banishment, the inuenomed cup that translated Socrates out of
prison into heaven. So when I wished my self an honest life, I wished these
things also, without which sometimes it cannot be honest. O thrice and
foure-times happy men were they,
That under Troy-towne walls dismembered lay,
Before their parents eyes. --
What difference make thou, either that thou wishest it unto any one, or that
thou conf^ssest that it is to be desired? Decius made a vow to die for the
Commonweal, and seeking naught but death, galloped his horse into the swarms
of his enemies. Another after him, that emulated his fathers virtue, after he
had pronounced the solemn words, which were already familiar unto him, thrust
himself mainely into the throng of his enemies, having no other care, but to
bes^^ch the gods to effect the intention of his vow, supposing that a good
death was a thing to be desired. Doubtest thou then, that it is not a great
good to die, to the end, to leave a happy memory of a man, and of some his
virtuous enterprise? When any one endures torments, constantly he employeth
all virtues, although it may be he had but patience only, which might appear
and show it self. But there is Fortitude, whose patience, sufferance and
tollerance are the branches. There is Prudence, without which no counsel is
conceived, which persuades to endure that valiantly, which thou can not
fly. There is Constancy, which cannot be dejected from her place, and gives
not over her resolution by no fear of torture. There is that inseparable
society of all the virtues. All that which is done honorably, one only virtue
does it, but it is by advice of counsel. But that which is allowed by all
vertues^ although it seem to be done by one, is to be desired. Why? Supposest
thou that those things are only to be wished for, which come by pleasure and
idleness? And that which we receive from painted, tapissed, and adorned gates?
There are some sad pleasures, and some vows that are celebrated, not with
rejoice, but with adoration and veneration of the the whole assembly. Think
thou not that in this kind Regulus wished not to return into the hands of the
Carthaginians? Put upon thee the mind of a generous and virtuous man, and
separate thy self a little from the opinions of the common sort. Assume as
fair and magni^icent a form of virtue as thou ought: which is to be
honored by us, not with gauds and garlands, but with sweat and blood. Behold
Marcus Cato, thrus^ing his most pure hands into that his sacred breast, to
enlarge his wound, which as yet was not sufficiently deep, whether at length
would thou say unto him, I would that which thou would, and I am much
grieved at that which thou do. Happy be it unto thee which thou do. In
this place our friend Demetrius comes to my mind, who termed a secure life,
and such a one as was not subject to Fortunes incursions, the dead sea. For to
have nothing to awaken thee, nothing to move thee, nothing by whose
advertisement and assault, thou may make trial of the firmitie of thy
mind, but to live always in a repose which has never been troubled, this is
not a tranquillity, but a calm, and relent of the sea. Attalus the Stoic was
wont to say, I had rather that Fortune should nourish me in the camp, then in
her delights. I suffer torments, but it is with constancy: this is well. I am
massacred, but endure it constantly; this does well. Hear moreover what
Epicurus says: And sweet it is: I will never give a delicate name to a thing
so honest and severe; I am burned, yet remain I invincible: why should it not
be desired^ not that the fire burn me, but that it overcome me not? There is
nothing more worthy then Virtue. All that whatsoever; which is done by her
direction and command, is good and desirable.

EPIST. LXVIII.
He persuades repose, but so as it ^e joined with Philosophy. That we are not
to boast thereof. And in it we are to entreat of our selves, with our selves,
that is, to enquire of our vices, and to amend them. To conclude, that this
repose is above all other affairs, because it serves the great Commonweal.

I Will be of thy mind; go to then, and retire and hide thy self in repose,
or rather hide thou thy repose. If thou can not learn this by the Stoics
precepts, at least thou shall learn it by their example. But by their preceps
also thou shall learn it, which I will approve unto thee when thou will. We
send not over to every Commonweal, neither always, neither without any end.
Moreover, when we have given a wiseman a Commonweal worthy of himself, that
is to say, the world; he is not out of his Commonweal, although he be
retired. But it may be rather that forsaking a little corner, he goes into
places more great and spacious, and lodging himself in heaven, he then
understands, that when he was mounted in his chair, and in his throne, he
was rather descended into a more base place. I will shut this secret in thy
bosom. That a wiseman never profits so much, then when both humane and
divine things become the objects of his eyes. I return now unto that which I
began to persuade thee unto, that is, that no man may know that thou will live
in repose. It behooves thee not to cover this resolution under the cloak of
retirement, whereby thou may intend Philosophy. It were better thou
should obscure thine intent under some other title. Thou must call it
sickness, feeblenes, idleness. It is a foolish ambition to glory in doing
nothing. There are certain beasts, which because they will not be tracted,
confound their steps even about that place where they lurk in. The like must
thou do; otherwise thou shall not want them that will follow the quest of
thee. There are many that pass before the gates of those that are opened,
without entering into them, and peep into the cranies of those those that are
closed. The coffer that is closed, whetteth on the thief to break it open, no
man makes reckoning of that which is unlocked, and these lock-pickers assault
not the door that is open. These are the manners of the common people, and
thus does the most ignorant. They desire to enter forcibly into others men's
secrets. It is therefore most expedient for a man not to boast of his
retirement, and it is a kind of boasting, to ^e hidden too much, and to
sequester a man's self from the sight of the people. This man is locked up in
Tarentum, that man is retired in Naples, and that other man ^or many years
has not ouerstrid his threshold. Undoubtedly he^ summoneth the world to come
and see him, that will suffer a report to pass of him through the city, that
he is retired. After thou have retired thy self, thou must do nothing that
men may talk of thee; speak thou only with thy self. But what shall thou
talk with thy self? That which some men do willingly entert^ine of others.
Have always an ill opinion of thy self. Accustom thy selfe^ to speak the
truth, and to hear it also. Above all things, speak thou often of those
imperfections which thou feel in thy self. There is no man but knows his
own infirmities. Therefore it is that some man disburdeneth his stomach by
vomit, another stuffes it with continual eating, another emptieth and
weakeneth his body by the means of fast. Those that are often tortured with
the pains of the gout, abstain either from bathing themselves, or drinking of
wine. And without observance of any other manner of diet, they ordinarily
overcome the sickness wherewith they are tormented. So likewise there are
certain parts in our soul, which are the causes of our infirmities, which how
we ought to recover, we diligently must bethink our selves. What do I in that
repose I take? I cure mine ulcer. If I should show thee my foot swollen, my
hand wholly mortified, or the dried sinews of my contracted leg, thou would
give me leave to lie in one place, and to take pity and regard my grief. But
that evil which I cannot see is far greater. It is an inflammation and
aposteme which I have in my breast. I will not that thou praise me, neither will
I that thou say, O great man! He has despised all things, and after he has
condemned all the furies of humane life, he is fled. Alas I have condemned
nothing but mine own proper actions. Thou must not desire to come unto me, to
the end to profit thy self. Thou art deceived, if hence thou expectest any
succors. Here dwells not the Physician, but the patient. I had rather when
thou art gone, thou should say. I thought this man to be a happy and learned
man, I gave ear unto him, I am deceived, I heard nothing, I saw nothing that I
might desire, or that might allure me to return again unto him. If this be
thy opinion, if this be thy speech, I know thou have profited somewhat; I had
rather thou should pardon my repose, then envy it. What then Seneca,
commendest thou repose of spirit unto me? Thou growest an Epicure in thy opinon
at length. I recommend unto thee repose, to the end, that by the means thereof,
thou might do things more great and more excellent, th^n those which thou
have left behind thee. To knock at great men's gates, to keep reckoning of
old men that have no children: to have great reputation in Court, is but a
momenta^y power, and full of enuie^ and if thou will speak truth, an abject.
This man far surpasses me in reputation amongst the Lawyers. He in his
allowances and paies for service, and his dignities gotten thereby, he in the
multitude of his clients, I cannot be so well followed as the one, nor recover
so great reputation as the other. But I ought not to make so great account to
be overcome by men, provide always that I may overcome Fortune. Would to God
that had been thy mind heretofore, to have followed this purpose. Would to
God we held not this discourse of happy life, upon that instant, wherein
death presents her self to our sight, yet let us not delay for all this. For
now believe we many things by experience, which we should have believed by the
discourse of reason, to be both super^luous and harmefull. Let us do like those
that set forward on their journey late, and that by diligence would recover the
time which they have lost, let us prick forward on the spur. This age is as
yet very proper to this study: it is already cleansed from his skum: it has
already left those vices which she could not conquer in the heat of her
youth. There wants little, but that she has wholly extinguished them. And
when, say thou, shall this pro^it thee which thou learnest even in the
period of thy years, or to what intent? To this, that I may die the better:
yet ought thou not to think that there is any age more proper unto
wisdom, then that which by long experience, and by a continual and frequent
sufferance of casualties has mortified and ouercom her self; and which after
it has triumphed over her affections, has attained to the knowledge of that
which profits and concerns her self. This is the true time of that good
which remains but a little while^ what man soever, and how old soever he be
that has attained wisdom, it is by his years that he has compassed it.

EPIST. LXXIX.
That places are not to be changed, but that we ought to be more reposed in
body, to the end the mind may be more pacified. That we are to fix the same
on a wholesome study, and to avoid those things which distract us.

I Will not that thou change countries, or transport thy self from one place
to another, first, because so often change is a token of an instable and
unsettled mind. Thou can never make profit of thy retirement, unless thou
give over travel, and wandering from country to country. If thou will settle
thy mind, limit thy body in some place; then will thy continued remedies
profit thee much. Thou must not break the repose or forgetfulness of thy
former life: suffer thine eyes to forget; suffer thine ears to accustom
themselves to wholesome counsels. As oft-times as thou shall walk in the
streets, thou shall ^inde in passing by, something that may renew thy
affections. Even as he that would despoile himself of love, ought to fly the
remembrance of that beauty, which he has loved: so he also that will
discharge himself of the affection of all things, of that desire wherewith he
burned in times past, he must retire both his eyes and ears from that he has
forsaken. Affection reuolteth suddenly: on which side soeeuer she turn her
self, she shall find a ready recompense of her employment. There is no evil
without reward. Avarice promises us money, lust many and diverse pleasures,
ambition the purple and applause, and thereby power and authority, and
whatsoever authority may do. Vices solicit thee with rewards, but here must
thou live without taking any thing. Scarce can it be effected in a whole age,
that those vices which have had their increase by so long liberty, should be
subdued and brought in subiection^ much less may it be done, if we divide the
time which is so short, into little parcels. Hardly can continual watch and
labor bring one only thing to perfection. Truly, if thou will listen to me
meditate hereupon, exercise thy self to receive death, and to seek her out
when any occasion shall counsel thee thereunto. It skils not whether she come
to us, or we to her, persuade thy self that the foolish men's proverb and
usual speech is false; It is a fair thing to die a good death. Thou may
beside this think thus with thy self: No man dies but on his prefixed time:
thou loosest none of thy time; for that which thou leauest behind thee is
another man's.

EPIST. LXX.
That by the sight of the POMPEIES, and the admonishment of time past, he
thought upon the swiftness and slight thereof. That death is at hand, which is
the haven of troubles. That she is neither to be ^eared nor desired, or
entertained but sometimes, and when? When reason not violent passion
persuades. Many and most excellent things to this purpose.

AFter a long space of time I have seen thy Pompeies, and in seeing them me
thought that I had recovered again my former youth: all whatsoever I had done
there whilst I was a young man, me thought I could as yet do it, and that but
a little while since I did it. We sail by our life, my Lucilius, and as in
the Sea, as our Virgil says; The shores and Cities fly.
So likewise in this so swift course of time, we lose the sight, first of our
childehood, and after of our youth, and then whatsoever intercurreth betwixt
youth and old age, which is con^ined both to the one and to the other, anon
after also the better years of our old age. In the last place the common end
of all humane race begins to discover it self. Are we so foolish to think
that it is a rock? It is the Port which we ought one day to desire, and never
to refuse; into which, if any man has been cast and carried in his young
years, he ought not to complain, no more then he would, that with a short cut
has ended his Navigations. For as thou know there are some whom s^acker
winds mock and detain, and weary with gentle tediousness of a peaceable
calm, some are swiftly borne away by a sudden gust. Think that the same
befalls us. Life has brought and ravished some very swiftly thither, whether
although they would have delayed, they must needs come. Othersome has she
pined and burned, which as thou know are not always to be retained; for it
is not good to live, but to live well. And therefore a wiseman lives as much
as he ought, not as much as he can. He will always see in what place he ought
to live, with what persons, in what manner, and what he ought to do. If diverse
troubles and sorrows suddenly surprise him, to the intent to intercept his
peace, he opens the prison himselfe^ neither does he this only in a
desperate extremity, but as soon as he has the least suspicion of fortune,
he takes a diligent heed whether that day should be his last or no. He makes
no great reckoning, whether by his own hand^ or another man's hatred he receive
his death, or whether it be sooner or later. He fears not as if he were
endangered to lose much; no man can have great loss of water by a dropping
Ewer. It skils not whether a man die sooner or later: to die either well or
ill, that imports much; and to die well is to fly the perrill of an evil
life. Therefore think I that Rhodians speech most e^feminate, who by a Tyrant
being cast into a cave, and nourished thereof after the manner of a wild
beast, being persuaded by some to abstain from his meat, answered, A man
ought to hope for all things whilst he lives. But suppose this were true, yet
ought we not buy life an every rate. There are certain things, which although
they are good, although they are certain, yet would I not attain them by a
confession of feebleness and faintness of heart. Shall I believe that fortune
has power in all things over him that lives, rather then suppose, that
fortune can do nothing over him that knows how to die? Yet sometimes,
although assured death be dependent, and that a man know that a punishment is
de^tinated for him, yet must ^e not set hand and further his punishment. It is
a folly to die through the fear of death: Comes he that should kill thee?
Expect him. Why put thou thy self forward? Why undertake thou the charge
of another man's cruelty? Do thou envy thy hangman, the officer to execute
thee, or will thou spare his labor? Socrates could have ended his days by his
absence, and might have rather died for hunger then of venom; yet remained he
full thirty days in prison, attending his death, not with this mind, that
all things might be pacified, or that so long a time might intertaine so many
hopes, but that he might yield himself unto the laws, and suffer his
friends to enjoy Socrates, even until his last. But what more great folly
could have been seen, then to despise death and to fear prison? Scribonia a
woman of great authority, was aunt on the fathers side to Drusus Libo, a young
man, who had as weak brain as his descent was noble, and that hoped for far
more great fortunes, then any other might hope for in that time, or himself
in any other time after; when as he was borne away from the Senate in his
Litter, not with frequent obseruances (for all his nearest friends had forsaken
him shamefully, not as a guilty, but a convicted person and executed) he began
to ask counsel whether he should hasten his death by his own hands, or
expect the same. To whom Scribonia: What pleasure have thou, said she, to
finish that which another ought to execute? But she could no ways persuade
him. He murdered himself with his own hands, and not without cause: for
being assured that within three or four days after, if he had been found
alive, he should die that death whatsoever was best liking to his enemy, he
finished that which another man should have executed. Thou can not then make
a general judgment, when as the violence of a foreign tyrant denounces thee
death; whether thou ought to further or expect the same. For there are
diverse reasons, which draw us both to the one and the other opinion. If the one
death should be accompanied with torments, and the other should be simple and
facile: why should I not allow of that? Even as I would choose a ship to sail
in^ and a house to dwell in; in like manner would I choose the better death to
depart out of this life. Furthermore, even as the longest life is not the best,
so the longest death is the worst. There is nothing wherein we should give
more contentment to our souls, then in the manner of death which they best like
of. Let the soul depart by that issue, her self inforceth, whether it be she
desire the dagger or the halter, or a poisoned cup that may suddenly seize all
the veins, let her proceed and break the bonds of her servitude. Every on^
ought to endeavor to approve his life unto others, and his death unto himself.
That which pleases us most is the best. This is but a folly to think thus.
Some will say that I did it not courageously enough, some that too much rashly,
some that there was a kind of death more generous. Think thou that it lies
in thy power to make choice of a counsel, which shall not be subject to
common report and censure? Think only to dispatch thy self speedily out of
the power and hands of fortune; otherwise there will not want some who will
conceive an evil opinion of thine action: thou shall find some, yea even
those who have made profession of Philosophy, that will deny that any man
ought to violate or shorten his life, and that maintain it for a foul
offense, for a man to murder himself, and that it were better to exspect the
end which Nature has determined. But he that speaks thus, sees not that he
cutteth off the way of liberty. The eternal law has done nothing better,
then to give us one only entrance into life, and diverse issues. Shall I
expulse the cruelty of a sickness, or the tyranny of a man, when as I may
escape even through the midst of torments, and drive all adversities far
from me? This is one thing, wherein we cannot complain of life, she retains
no man. It is a great good for humane affairs, that there is not one that is
miserable, but by his own default. Take thou pleasure in life? Live. Art
thou displeased therewith? Thou may return to the place from whence thou
came. To heal thy headache thou have oft-times let blood, to extenuate thy
body thou have opened thy vein: Thou need not to open thy breast with a
deep and vast wound; a lancet will give way to that great liberty, and in a
prick consists security. What is it then that makes us fearful and
slack to dislodge? There is not one of us that thinks that he must depart
one day out of this house: so does the custom and indulgence of the place
detain the ancient inhabitants, although to their own undoing. Will thou
always keep this liberty against this body? Inhabit it as if thou should
leave it, and make account that one day thou must lose his company. Thou shall
afterward be more constant and resolute, when any necessity shall constrain
thee to depart. But how can they think upon their ends, who covet all things
without end? There is nothing in this world, the remembrance and meditation
whereof is more necessary. For happily it is in vain, where a man thinks on
other things. Have we prepared our minds against poverty? The riches remain
with us. Are we already armed against contempt of pain? The felicity of a
whole and healthful body has had no need, that we should make proof of our
virtues. Have we gotten this authority over our selves, that we can suffer
death and the loss of our friends constantly? Yet fortune has conserved and
made all them survive unto us, whom we most love. But the day that shall have
need of the use and practique of this only thing, ought undoubtedly to come.
Thou must not think that great personages only, have had that courage and
force to break the bonds of their humane servitude. Thou must not think that
Cato only could rent out his soul with his hand, which he could not prick
out with his poynard. Since some men of as bad condition as may be, with great
heat of courage have attained that place of assurance, and being unable
suddenly to find wherewith to make themselves away to their liking, or choose
any instrument which was proper for them thereunto, have laid hand on the
first thing they could encounter, and have made use of that for weapons, which
of their nature were no ways hurtful. Not long since an Alman, one of those
that should combat with the beasts, in the sports and shows in the morning,
retired himself, fayning that he would withdraw himself to discharge his
natural necessities; for they were not suffered to go into any other secret
place without guard, there stopped he the stick or staff (to which a spong
was fastned^ to cleanse and clear the privy parts) wholly into his throat,
and forcibly closing up the passage of his breath, stifled himself: this was
to brave death and contemn it. It was undoubtedly, although scarce cleanly and
honorably. What folly is there greater, then to die effeminately, when we
must die assuredly. O strong, O worthy man, deserving the election of that
death that best liked him! How courageously had he used his sword, had he found
it? with what resolution of mind had he cast himself into the depth of the
Sea, or the cauitie of a cloven Rock? Being dispoyled of all commodities, he
found the means how he might be beholding unto himself only, both for the
means and weapons for his death. To the end that thou may know that there
is nothing that hinders us from dying but want of will. Let each man judge as
he list of this violent man's actions, provided that it be resolved upon as a
thing assured, that we ought to prefer a base and villeynous death, before
the most cleanliest servitude in the world. But because I have begun to use
abject examples, I will contiue them: for every one will enforce himself to
do his best, if he shall perceive that death is contemptible to persons that
are most abject and base. We think that these Catoes and Scipioes, and those
other whose memories we entertain with admiration, are inimitable. But I will
prove you presently that this virtue is accompanied with as many examples,
amiddest the men most miserable, destinated to the sports and spectacles of
beasts, as amiddest the Chiefe-tains of civil wars. When as not long since,
with sure guard, the soldiers carried forth a wretch, sent out for the morning
spectacles, stouping down his head as if he were pressed with sleep, he
suffered it to hang so low, that he put it between the Cartwheels, and held
it so long in that place, that the wheel in turning it self brake his neck.
He avoided the punishment in the same Chariot, on which he was carried forth to
be punished. There is nothing that may hinder a man that has a will to die,
and to be delivered. Nature keeps us in an open place. He to whom his last
necessity is so favorable, as to advise on the issue and end which he shall
esteem most conuenient^ he that has diverse means in his power to set
himself at liberty may choose; he shall do well to think how he may most
easily be delivered. But he that has so hard hap, as not to find any
occasion, let him take hold on the first that shall present it self, as if it
were the best, although it be strange and unheard of: he that wants no
courage, wants no invention how to die. Thou see how those sla^es which are
most miserable, when as their misery touches them to the quick, awaken
themselves, and how they deceive their keepers, though never so diligent: he is
a man of the greatest courage that has not only commanded, but also found out
the means of his death. I have promised thee diverse examples of men of this
condition I have spoken of. In the second combat which was made upon the
water, one of the Barbarians thrust all that Iauelin into his throat, which
was given him to combat his enemies. Why have I not long since, said he, fled
all these torments and all these shames? Why should I attend death, having the
arms in my hands? This spectacle was so much the more magni^icent, as much as
it is more honest for men to learn to die well, as to kill. What then? That
which the most abject and contemptible spirits may have; why should not they
partake, whom long study and reason (the Lady Mistress of all things) has
instructed? It is the same reason that warns us, that there are diverse
manners of death, but that there is but one and the same end, and that it
avails nothing to know whence that begins, that must one day come. The
same reason warns thee, if it lie in thy power to die without grief: but if
it cannot be, do the best that thou can, and lay hold on all that which
presents it self to lay violence on thy life. It is an injurious thing to
live by rapine, but it is a most worthy thing to die violently.

EPIST. LXXI.
That the chiefest good should be continually in our eyes, and that to it all
our counsels and actions should be referred. What therefore is that? Only
honest. They adulterate the fame that mix internal things, because it is
only freed in the mind. Again, that goods are equal, and that contempt
differs not from honor, if both proceed from honesty. He gives CATO for
example, and dilateth the same very worthily. Likewise that an honest death
differs not from such a life. Against the Academikes, which make degrees of
happiness. That neither it^ nor honesty are intended. And therefore the most
blessed may be in torment. Is it so? Will he not wax pale, tremble, or grieve?
Yes, (for these are natural) but all these shall be overcome by the strength
of his mind, yet not presently all. There are differences between wise men
and studious. Read diligently, mark and admire.

THou ask my counsel in all thy affairs, from time to time, not remembering
thy self that we are separated by a large sea. But since the greater part of
counsel depends on the opportunity of time, it must fall out of
necessity, that sometimes in certain things my counsel is then brought unto
thee, when as at that time the contrary were more allowable. For counsels
are fitted to affairs, and our affairs pass away swiftly, or to speak
truth, roll away impetuously. Counsel therefore ought to be given daily, yet
is it sometime over old by a day; it must be bred swiftly, as they say, and
under hand. But how it is found I will show thee. As often as thou will know what
either is to be fled, or what ought to be affected, have regard unto the
chiefest good and scope of thy whole life. For thereto must all that consent
whatsoever we do. He shall not dispose every thing, except he purpose to
himself already a certain strain of his whole life. No man, although his
colors be ground to his hand, can represent the similitude of any thing,
except already he be resolved, what he intends to paint. Therefore err we,
because we all of us deliberate on the parts of our life, and no man debateth
of the whole. He must know whereat he aims, that will shoot his arrow; and
then must he aim and guide his arrow by his hand. Our Counsels therefore
err, because they have not whereunto they should be directed. He that knows
not what harbor he shall make for, has no wind fitting for him. It must need
fall out that casualtie must effect much in our life, because all of us live
casually. And to some it happens, that they wot not that they know certain
things, even as oftentimes we seek for those, with whom we are conversant and
present. So for the most part we know not the end of the sovereign good,
though it be before our eyes, neither by many words nor long circumstance,
shall thou gather what the chiefest good is. You must show it, as the proverb
says, by the finger, without extending it to so many things. For to what
purpose is it to divide the same into parts, when as thou may say, That is
the chiefest good which is honest; and that which thou should most wonder
at, There is but only one good, which is honest; the rest are false and
adulterated goods. If thou persuade thy self this, and perfectly love virtue
(for to love it, is but a small matter) whatsoever she shall touch, that to thee
(howsoever it seem to others) shall be both happy and successful, both to
be tormented, if thou lie more secure then he that tortureth thee; and to be
sick, if so be thou curse not Fortune, and give not way to thy sickness. To
conclude all those things, which to other men seem evil, both shall be sweet
unto thee, and return thee profit, if so be thou can overcome them. Resolve
on this, that nothing is good, but that which is honest, and that all
incommodities may justly be called goods, which are once made honest by virtue.
To many we seem to promise greater things then humane nature is capable of,
and not without reason. For they respect the body, let them return to the
mind, and then shall they measure man with God. Take courage, my Lucilius, the
best of men, and dismiss this study of letters, which the Philosophers
affect, who reduce the most magnificent thing of the world to syllables, that
teach but base and trifling matters, and diminish and waste the understanding.
Thou shall become like unto those that have invented these things; not they
that teach them, and endeavor thus much, that Philosophy might rather seem
difficult then great. Follow them, if I have any authority over thee.
Socrates, who reduced all Philosophy unto manners, and said that the chiefest
wisdom was to distinguish good from evil: To the end that thou may be
happy (says he) permit thy self sometimes to be esteemed a fool. Let
whosoever will outrage thee in words, and offend thee in deeds, yet shall thou
^uffer nothing, if so be virtue be with thee. If thou will, says he, be
blessed: if thou will be an entire honest man, suffer thy self to be
contemned. This will no man perform, but he that has equalled and
proportioned all goods, because that neither is good without honesty, and
honesty is equal in all. What then? Is there no difference betwixt Catoes
Pretorship, and his repulse? It skilleth not whether Cato be overcome in the
Pharsalian field, or whether he overcome. This good of his, wherein he cannot
be overcome, though his confederates were conquered: was it equal with that
good, wherewith he returned a conqueror unto his country, and composed the
peace? Why should it not be equal? For by the selfsame virtue evil fortune
is overcome, and the good is confirmed; yet virtue cannot be made greater or
lesser. She is always in the same measure. Yea but Cneius Pompey shall lose
his army: but this fair luster and pretext of the Commonweal, the
principal citizens, and the chiefest bands of Pompeyes confedera^es, which
being composed of the Senate that bare arms, shall be defaced in one only
battle, and the wreckes and ruins of so great an Empire, shall be noised and
scattered through the whole world: one part thereof shall fall in Egypt,
another in Africa, and some in Spain. And that which is worse, this miserable
Commonweal cannot have this good to be ruinated all at once. Let all happen
whatsoever may. Although Iuba can be no further succored in his own Kingdom
by the knowledge of the passages, and the constant virtues of his people.
Although the fidelity of the inhabitants of Vtica being broken with so many
mishaps, be deficient, and the fortune of Scipioes name abandoneth him in
Africa it self. It has long since been provided, that Cato shall neither
feel loss nor detriment; yet was he conquered. Account thou this amongst
Catoes repulses, he will suffer with as equal constancy, as well that which
has been contrary to his virtue, as to his estate of Praetor. The day that he
refused the same, he sported; and that night he would kill himself, he read.
He cared as little to lose his life, as his Pretorship, he had persuaded
himself, and resolved to endure all that might happen. But why should not he
with a stout and confident mind endure the changes of the Commonweal? For
what may a man see that is exempt from change? The earth, the heavens, and the
structure of all this great world, although it be governed by God, is subject
thereunto. It shall not always retain that fair order it now observes. Some
day shall come, that shall cast it out of this accustomed course. All things
alter by certain stations, they must be borne, increase, and be extinguished,
whatsoever thou see wheel and wind about us, and all that whereon we are
sustained and stayed, as a thing most firm and solid, shall come to nothing,
and be defective. There is nothing but has his age and declination. Nature
causes all those things to descend into one place, by spaces of unequal time.
All that which is, shall be no more, yet shall it not perish but be dissolved.
To us dissolution is to die: for we respect nothing but that which is before
our eyes. The dull mind, and such as has addicted it self to the body,
foreseeth no further, for otherwise she would more constantly and courageously
suffer, both her own and her friends dissolutions and deaths, if she hoped
that all those things should go by turns from death to life, and that those
things which are compounded, shall be dissolved, and such as are dissolved
shall be reassembled, and that God, which governs the whole world, employeth
his eternal Art on this work. Therefore, when as Cato has represented
before his mind, all the eternity of time, he will say: All mankind
whatsoever is or shall be, is condemned to die. All the Cities, in what place
soever they be, that have had dominion over their neighbors, and have been
greatned and honored by foreign Empires, the time shall come when it shall he
enquired where they were builded, and by sundry sorts of dissolution shall
they be extinguished. War shall destroy some: Idleness, and a long peace
converted into slothfulness, and foolish expenses, a fatal adiunct of great
riches shall consume the others. A sudden inundation of the sea, shall hide all
these fertile fields, or an earthquake shall swallow them up in his bottomless
bosom. What cause have I therefore to grudge at, or grieve for, if in a small
moment I outstrip public fate. A constant soul must obey God, and whatsoever
the law of the great Universe commands, let him suffer without cunctation or
delay. For either she shall be translated into a better life, to remain with
more brightness and tranquillity amongst divine things, or certainly she shall
remix her self with her nature, and return into her whole, neuermore to
suffer any incommoditie or pain. The sovereign good then of Marcus Cato,
shall not consist any more in an honest life, but in an honest death; for
virtue is not intended. Socrates said, that verity and virtue were the same.
For as she increases not, no more does virtue also, she has her perfection,
she is full. Thou must not wonder then to hear that goods are equal, as well
they which we are to take by a certain resolution, as those which a sudden
current of Fortune brings to us. For if thou admittest any inequality, that
thou will reckon it amongst the lesser goods, to be constant in torments, thou
shall reckon it also amongst the evils. Thou shall term Socrates unhappy in
his prison, and Cato unfortunate, renting open his wounds more courageously
then he inflicted them. Thou shall judge Regulus the unhappiest man in the
world, for paying the penalty of his observed faith unto his mortal enemies^
and yet there is not one, how delicate soever, and effeminate he be, that has
dared to say thus, for they deny him to be blessed, and yet they deny him to be
miserable. The ancient Academickes confess, that amiddest these torments and
pains he was happy, but not perfectly and fully, which can in no manner be
allowed of. For if he be happy, he has attained the sovereign good, and the
sovereign good cannot have any degree above the same, if so be it be
accompanied with any virtue, provided that adversities overcome it not,
provided that it remain entire and safe, although the body be crushed in
sunder; but certain it is that she remains entire. For I speak of a virtue
most excellent and courageous, which is animated and incited against all that
which offends it. That mind which oftentimes young men of generous hope and
dispositions put upon them, whom the beauty of some honest thing has
provoked, so that they contemn all casualties, undoubtedly wisdom will infuse
and teach, and persuade us that the only good is that which is honest. And
that this can neither be remitted or intended, no more then a rule by which a
man measures that which he would make straight, which if thou bear whatsoever
thou changest from it, it is the injury of the right. The same therefore will we
say by Virtue, that she also is straight, and admits no crookedness, it can
be no more intended. She it is that judges of all things, and nothing judges
of her, if she cannot be made straighter, no more are those things which are
done by her straighter, the one then the other, for they must needs be
answerable to the same; so are they equal. What then say thou? Are these
things alike to sit at a table banqueting, and to be tortured? Does this seem
strange unto thee? Thou have more occasion to wonder at this. It is an evil
thing to sit at a banquet; it is a good thing to be tortured: if that be done
lewdly, this honestly. The matter is not the cause that this is either good or
evil; it is the virtue. This wheresoever it appears, all things are of the
same measure and price. He that judges another man's understanding by his own,
presently lifts up his nails to scratch out mine eyes, when I say that his
good that suffers adversities constantly, and his that makes an honest
judgment of prosperity are equal: when I say that the goods of him that
triumphs, and of him that with an invincible courage is led before the
triumphant Chariot are alike. For they think that nothing is done which they
cannot do, and by their own infirmity, they censure virtue. Why wonderest
thou, why some rejoice when they see themselves burned, wounded, harmed, slain
and fettered? Sometimes they suffer it for their pleasure. Sobriety suffices
for a penalty, to a prodigal and dissolute man. Travel is no less then
torture to an idle man. The effeminate takes pity of him that is industrious,
and study is a hell to him that is slothful. In like sort, those things (for
which our forces seem over feeble) are in our opinion hard and intolerable,
whereas in our forgetfulness, we find many that think it a torment to want
wine, and trouble to rise early. These by nature are not difficult, but we are
recreants, we are effeminate. We ought to judge of great things with a great
courage; otherwise it will seem to be their error, which is ours. So certain
things that are most straight, when as they are let down into the water, seem
crooked and bowed to them, that behold them. It skilleth not what thou see,
but how. Our mind is dimmed in beholding those things, and examining them
which are true. Give me a young man well borne and of good spirit: he will say
that he supposes him more fortunate, that has borne all the burdens of
adverse fortune, with a constant mind, on his shoulders, then him that has
wholly trodden Fortune under foot. It is no wonder to be temperate in
tranquillity, admire him that is high minded, where all men are dejected, that
stands there where all men are suppressed. What evil is there in torments,
or what in those things which we call adverse? The evil is, as I think, when
the soul is astonished, when it is weakened, when it is smothered under the
burden. But none of these may befall a wise man. He remains always upright,
how ouer-charged soever he be. There is nothing that lesseneth his courage,
nothing that is tedious unto him, which he must suffer. For he never
complains that such a fortune has bafallen him, which in any sort may befall
any man whatsoever, she knows her own forces, and her ability in suffering
so great a burden. I will not put a wise man out of the rank of men, I will
not exempt him from dolours, no more then I would do a rock which has no
sense. I remember my self that he is compounded of two parts: The one is
irrational, and that it is which may feel bitings, burnings, and pains. The
other is reasonable, that is it which is never shaken in opinion, that is
exempt from all fear, and that is invincible. In this part it is that a man's
chiefest good lodges; before the accomplishment whereof, the mind wandereth
as uncertain and doubtful, but after she has attained to her perfection, it
is in assurance and in immutable firmitie. So he that has but begun, and that
nevertheless will ascend unto the highest, and follow virtue, although he
approaches the good which is wholly perfect, yet unable as yet to accomplish
the same: he will sometimes stay himself in the way, and temperate, in some
sort, the vehemency and strength of his mind, for as yet has he not
ouerpassed those things which are incertaine, and remains as yet in danger of
disaster. But he that is blessed, and in whom virtues are accomplished, then
loves himself most, when he has made proof of his constancy, and if there
be any thing which other men fear, provided that he may receive some honest
reward of his deuoyre and service, he endures not only, but he embraces the
same, and had rather hear it spoken, he is more honest; then to hear it
said, he is more happy. I have now retired my self thither, whither thy
expectation draws me: lest thou should suppose, that the virtue whereof I
speak, should seem to extend it self above all natural things. A wiseman
shall tremble, he shall feel pains, he shall be pale, for all these senses
appertain unto the body. Where is then the original of his calamities? Where
then appears his evil most approved? Then it is when his passions astonish
his soul. Then it is, when they make her confess that she is a slave, and
that they engender some repentance in her. The wiseman undoubtedly surmounteth
Fortune by his virtue. But there are diverse men who have made profession of
wisdom, and notwithstanding have been terrified by very light threatenings. In
this place it is our error, who exact that from a proficient, which is spoken
of a wiseman. I strive as much as in me lies, to believe all this which I
praise, yet persuade I not them as yet, and although I had persuaded my self I
should not have them so ready at hand, or so exercised, that they should be
addressed against all casualtie. Even as wool takes some stain of colors at
the first, and drinks not up othersome, without often maceration and boiling:
so some wits, when as they have conceited certain disciplines, forthwith make
use of them. But this Science, except it be deeply imprinted in the soul, and
has taken deep root and long residence therein, has not deep died, but
superficially colored the soul, and performs nothing of that she has
promised. This may be quickly learned, and in few words; namely, that there is
but one only good, which is virtue, and that undoubtedly there is not any
without virtue. And that virtue is lodged in our better part, which is that,
which is reasonable. What shall this virtue be? A true and immovable judgment
from whence shall proceed the heat of the soul, whereby the appearance of
things which may move this heat, shall become clear and certain. It behooves
that this judgment esteem all those things good and equal in themselves,
which shall be achieved by the counsel of virtue. In regard of corporal
goods, they are goods for the body, yet are they not entirely perfect goods.
Well may they be esteemed at some rate, but it shall be without any
supereminencie. There is a great difference betwixt them: the one shall be
greater, the other lesser. In like sort ought men to confess that there is a
great difference between those that follow Philosophy. Some one has so far
profited therein, that he dare lift up his ^ies against fortune: yet not
perseuerantly; for they are oftentimes obscured by the beams of her too clear
light. Some other has profited so much, that h^ dare encounter her face to
face, if he have attained to perfection, and be full of assurance. But it must
needs so fall out that things which are imperfect grow to ruin, and now
frustrate themselves, and anon after come to decay or dissolution, and they
shall come unto decay if they persevere not to grow forward, and enforce
themselves, and if they remit any thing of their study, and faithful
intention, they shall grow backward. No man finds advancement and profit
there where he left it: let us therefore be diligent and persevere; there
remains yet more then we have overcome: but the greatest part of profit, is
to desire to profit. Herein my conscience shall bear me witness: I will, and
with my whole mind I will: I see well also that thou have this inspiration,
and that thou prosecutest with great feruencie those things that are more
fair. Let us then make have, and so doing, our life shall be the cause of our
great good, otherwise it is but a delay, and truly a very loathsome one, if we
converse in base matters: let us endeavor, so that all the time may be ours,
but it will not be, except we begin to be our own. When shall it come to pass
that we will contemn both fortunes? When shall it come to pass, that
suppressing all our affections, and bringing them under our obedience we may
say thus: I have overcome. Ask thou me whom I have overcome? Not the
Persians, not the far distant Medes, or that warlike nation of the Dacae; but
avarice, but ambition, but fear of death, which have vanquished the
Conquerours and Vanquishers of the whole world.

EPIST. LXXII.
He delayeth to answer LVCILIVS petition, and that upon just occasion. He
shows that the study of goodness is deferred by us, but badly. That we
ought to intend to this only, pretermitting all other things. That nothing
happens that may hinder him, especially that is wise, and proficient in some
sort. The difference betwixt them both. That external things neither add nor
detract from a wiseman, that is always contented with himself.

I Know well what thou demaundest at my hands, if I had recollected and
meditated thereupon, but it is long time since I made trial of my memory. And
therefore it is that it follows me not so easily. I know well, and feel it
in my self, that the like has befalne me which happens in books that are
mouldie, and whose leaves cleave together. I must dilate my mind, and
whatsoever things have been heard therein, they ought to be refreshed and
brought in use, that they may always be in a readiness as often as we have
need to use them. But let us defer this for the present; for it requires
much labor and much diligence. As Soon as I may make more longer residence in
a place, I will take this task in hand; for there are some things which thou
may compose in thy Coach, and some other that deserve the bed, the repose,
and solitary places. Yet those very days wherein a man is occupied, we must
do somewhat, yea, all the whole days: for now occasions and occupations will
be never scantie; we see this our selves, and from one springs mani^; and that
which is worst, we give our selves delays. But as soon as I have made an end
of this (say we) I will wholly dedicate my self, and if I can end this
troublesome matter, I will addict my self unto study. Thou must not expect
till thou have leisure to follow Philosophy. Thou must contemn all other
things, to be always with her. A man cannot find time that may be
sufficiently long for her, although it continue with us from the years of our
infancy, until the most longest life of man. It skilleth not much whether
thou omittest Philosophy, or intermittest it. For it remains not there where
it was interrupted; but even as those things that are bent, as soon as they
are let slip do forcibly retire themselves, so that which departs from his
continuation, retireth it self, and returns wholly unto his beginnings. We
must reject all affairs and occupations, we must not study how to dispose
them, we must wholly dispossess and drive them from us. There is no time
unfitting for a wholesome study. But there are many that study not those
things which they ought to study. Shall there be any occasion that may let
them? Truly not him whose mind in all affairs is watchful and joyful. To
these persons only true joy is interrupted, which have not as yet attained
perfection. But in regard of the wise, their joy is continual, it keeps the
same tract, there is not any fortune or occasion that can countermand the same.
It is always peaceable and reposed; for it has no dependence of another: she
expects no favor at fortunes hands, nor men's applause: it is a felicity
that is bred in her own house: she would leave the soul if she entered: she is
engendered therein. There might some occasion fall out to make him remember that
he is mortal, but it very slight, and surpassed not the upper skin. He
feels, I say, some incommoditie, but that good which is the greatest he has,
is never shaken: well wot I that outwardly there are some incommodities, even
as upon a strong and able body there appears some itch, and pimples, and
ulcers, but inwardly there is no evil. The difference, I say, that is between
a man that has already acquired a perfect wisdom, and him that is as yet to
attain the same, is such as there is betwixt a man that is healthful, and him
that begins to recover himself from a long and tedious sickness, who
thinks himself to be then in good health, when the fit of his fever is the
shortest. This man, except he be very careful of his health, he feels by
times certain shakings, and easily falls relapse into his former infirmity.
But a wiseman cannot fall again, nay more, he never more can be attainted
therewith: for as touching the body, it has health but for a time, and that
Physician that has recured him, cannot promise him perpetuity: he is
oftentimes recalled by him, whom almost before time he had resusitated: But the
soul is healed for ever at one time. I will teach thee how to know when a man
is in health, if he be content with himself, if he may trust himself, if he
knows that all mortal men's vows, that all the benefits which are given and
demanded have no moment in a blessed life. For that thing whereunto a man may
annex somewhat, is not perfect. But that from whence nothing may be taken
continues eternally. He whose joy is perpetual may rejoice of that which is
his own. But all these goods whereunto the common sort aspire inconstantly
flow hither and thither: fortune gives nothing with warrantize; and yet the
benefits of fortune are pleasing unto us when they are tempered by reason, and
she directs them. She it is that makes us allow of exterior things. The use
whereof displeases if they be desired ouer-ardently. Attalus was wont to use
this comparison: Have thou seen a dog snatching at a piece of bread with
open throat, or a morsel of ^lesh which his master casts him? He deuoureth
incontinently all that which is given him, and still opens his mouth, in hope
that some one will cast him more. So falls it out with us, whatsoever fortune
casts upon us during our expectation, that swallow we without any pleasure^
still expecting and affecting some second pray. So fares not a wiseman; he is
full, and if any thing befall him, he securely receives and lays it up; his
joy is great, continual, and his own. Is there any one that has a good will,
and that profits somewhat, but has not as yet attained to perfection? Such a
one shall be sometimes dejected, sometimes encouraged, sometime is he raised as
high as heaven, otherwise ravished as low as earth. The ignorant, and such as
have little experience, never make an end of their precipitation, but fall into
confusion, and into Epicurus his Chaos, void and infinite. There is another
third kind of those that wanton it about wisdom, which as yet they cannot
attain, yet are they in sight thereof; and if I might say so, they may clap
her on the hand. These are neither shaken, neither do they fall, they are not
as yet on the continent, but they are already in the harbor^ Since then there
is so great a distance betwixt those that are on high, and those that are most
low, since that they which are in the midst, feel as yet some storm, and
that they are followed with more danger to return unto a more wicked life, we
must not addict our selves to any occupations, we must reject them. If they
were once entered, they would set some other in their places. Let us hinder
their beginnings, and the less labor will there be to keep them from
beginning, then to see them take end.

EPIST. LXXIII.
That Philosophers are not disobedient but more obedient, and faithful to
Princes, then these ambitions and Palatines: for these ^ffect envy, and are
always unquiet, often displeased, but they love them, because they li^e
quietly under them, and are such that is full of good merchandise. They impute
this benefit^ also, although it happen unto many. At length he counsels him
to aspire unto virtue, that is, to God; for that (such is the Stoics pride)
they make a wiseman equal with him.

THey deceive themselves, in my judgment, that suppose that they who have
wholly addicted themselves to Philosophy, are disobedient and rebellous to
their Magistrates and Kings, or that they contemn those by whose authority
public affairs are administered: for contrariwise there is not any one that
reuerenceth and respects them more then they. And not without cause; for that
Kings cannot do^ greater good unto any man in this world, then to those that
may enjoy a peaceable repose. It must then necessarily ^all out, that they to
whom public assurance opens the way to the intention they have to live
well^ should reverence the author of the same good as their Lord and Father. And
truly far more then those light witted and irresolute men, who being
infinitely bound unto their Princes, will notwithstanding have men think that
they owe them more, on whom a man cannot employ any liberality how great
soever it be, that may satisfy their ^mbitious desires, which increase always
the more, the more they are glutted. But he that thinks to receive new
benefits, has already forgotten the old, and cou^tousnesse has not any vice
more great then ingratitude. Add hereunto now, that there are none of those
that are employed, and conversant in public affairs, that respects those
at any time, whom he has ouer-stripped, but looks into those that outstrip
him, and it is not so pleasant a matter unto them, to see many men come after
them: as it is grievous unto them, that any one should ouer-passe them in
dignity. All sort of ambition has this vice, that it never respects that
which is past. And ambition is not only inconstant and wandering, but all
covetousness likewise; because it begins always from the end. But that
sincere and poor man, who has forsaken the Court and the Palace, and all
preheminencie in commonweal to retire himself for more noble intents and
ends, loves those by whose authority it is lawful for him to do these
things with security; he alone pays them with gratuitall testimony of
acknowledgement, and confesses himself to be indebted unto them for a great
good, although they know not his good will. Even as he honors and
reuerenceth his Masters, by whose instructions he is despoyled of those vices,
in like sort respects he those, under whose protection and government he may
exercise honest disciplines. But the King protecteth others also by his power.
Who denies it? But even as amongst others that have traveled by Sea, and have
been partakers of one and the same calm, he thinks himself more bound
unto Neptune, that has brought home more great quantity of precious
merchandise; and as the Merchant pays his vow with greater courage then a
Passenger does: And as he also amongst the Merchants that brings perfunes,
purples, and other precious things which are sold for their weight in gold,
reknowledgeth this favor more liberally, then does he that has but laid down
poor Merchandise, and other things which should serve but to ballist and load
the ship: So the benefit of thi^ peace, appertayning to all, does more deeply
content them that use the same well: For there are many of these Magistrates
and mighty men, to whom peace is more troublesome then war. Art thou of that
opinion, that they which make no other use of peace, but to employ it in
drunkenness, in riot and other sorts of vices; for the extermination of which,
it were necessary to enterprise a war, shall be so much obliged for the
same? Except happily thou were of that opinion, that a wiseman were so iniust,
that he thought that he were no ways obliged to his governor, for public
and common benefits. I owe much unto the Sun and Moon, and yet they shine
not for me alone. I am particularly bound unto the year, and to God that
tempereth and governs the same, although they have not been ordained for my
particular honor. It is the foolish avarice of mortal men, that makes a
division of these goods, and assigns the property unto them, and that
believes nothing to be his that is for public profit. But this wiseman
judges nothing to be more aptly his, then that which is common between him
and all other men. For goods cannot be common, if the portions of them
appertained not to particulars. A man is made partaker how little part soever
he enjoy in a common thing. Add hereunto also this other reason, that the
greatest and truest goods are not so divided, that a little should light upon
every private man. They come wholly into every man's possession. Of those
presents which Princes make unto the people, the particulars take as much by
powle, as has been promised to every one. At a common banquet, and at the
common dole of flesh, and in all that which is received by hand, the alms is
distributed in prises. But these indivisible goods, such as peace and liberty
are, these also are entire to all, as they are particular unto every one: and
therefore a wiseman considers what he is, by whose means the public
necessity constrains him no more to bear arms, nor to intend the Watch,
nor to stand Sentinel on the walls, and not to pay an infinity of taxes any
more which war brings with it, and gives thanks unto his Prince. This does
Philosophy teach vs^ especially to be dutifully thankful for benefits, and
faithfully to requite them; and the only acknowledgement sometimes serves for
payment. He will therefore confess that he is very much bound unto him, by
whose wise government and providence this great and happy repose is befalne
him, to be able to pass the term of his life in such tranquillity and quiet,
which is not interrupted by any public occupations. 'T is God O MELIBE that
gave this peace,
Him as my God I Will honor without cease.
If then these calmes and contentments are so principally to be ascribed to him
that has procured them for us, the greatest good whereof is He (as thou see)
my yoaked teame permits
To plow the earth, by him in pleasant fits,
Mine Oaten pipe I tune as best befits.
How much ought we to esteem that repose which we partake with the gods, that
makes us become gods. Thus say I Lucilius, thus call I thee to heaven by a
short way. Sextius was wont to say, That IVPITER could not do more then a good
man. IVPITER has more means to be liberal toward men. But among two good
men, he is not the better that is the richer, no more then between two that
have equal knowledge in governing a ship, thou will not call him better that
governs a Carricke or great vessel, and full of rich lading. What advantage
has Jupiter over a good man? It is but only this, that he is more long time
good. A wiseman reckons himself nothing the less, because his virtues are
determined in a shorter time. Even as of two wisemen, he which is dead in
fulness^ of his age, is not more happy then he, whose virtue has taken end in
lesser years. So God likewise surmounteth not a wiseman in felicity, although
he exceed him in age. That virtue is not greater which is longer. Jupiter has
all th^se things, but he has given the use and possession thereof unto others^
This only use appertains unto him, that he is the cause that others may use
the same. The wiseman likewise is glad to see the possession of all goods in
an other man's hands, and makes as small account also of that as Jupiter does,
and further supposes himself to have this advantage above him, that Jupiter
cannot have use of them, and a wiseman will not. Let us therefore believe
Sextius, who shows us a fair way, and cries out, This is the way to heaven,
by sobriety, by temperance, and by patience in adversity. The Gods disdain
no man, envy no man, they entertain and stretch forth their hand to those that
ascend. Wonderest thou to hear that men go unto the Gods? God comes unto
men, nay (which is more near) he comes into men. There is not any soul that
is good without God. There are certain divine seeds dispersed in the bodies of
men, which grow answerable to their original, and grow alike unto that
grain from whence they took their beginning, if they be entertained in the
bosom of a good husbandman. But if he be evil, he choaketh them as a barren
and faggie ground; and finally, in stead of corn bears chafe and straw.

EPIST. LXXIIII.
O fair, O honest Epistle, and of honesty it self, and that indeed it is the
only good, the rest but in opinion. He that will safely and securely live, let
him so think. What likeness? Let him have a ready buckler against all
casualties, which is to follow God. At length he answers certain objections.
Lastly he shows that a blessed life is as a circle, perfect both in small and
great. That nothing is added, nothing taken therefrom by external things. It
must be reiterated. O fair, O honest, enjoy thou this, who have such a mind.

THy letter has delighted me, and awakened me when I was wearied, and
quickened my memory also, which is now slow and heavy. Why should thou
not, my Lucilius, think this persuasion to be the greatest instrument of
blessed life, that there is only one good, that is to say, that which is
honest? He that has circumscribed all sorts of good under honesty, is happy
in himself. For he that judges that other things are goods, subiecteth
himself to the power of Fortune, and depends on another man's will. This man
is sorrowful for the loss of his children, another careful of them that are
sick, and that other, if they be dishonest and noted of infamy. Thou shall
see one man tormented with the love of another man's wife, and another
transported with the love he bears his own. There wants not some one
likewise, that is distracted with the repulse he receives in his affected
dignity, and another that is disgusted with the honor which he possesses. But
the greatest number of all those men which are thus miserable, is of them whom
the assault and touch of impendent death, which they fear on every side,
presses and tormenteth incessantly, for there is nothing from whence they
think not, that she should not assail them. Therefore as if they lived in an
enemies country, they ought to look about them on every side, and on every
voice they hear, to turn their necks thitherward: for except this fear be
driven out of their breasts, they live in continual heart-breake and
suspicion. Some will be found out that have been sent into exile, and deprived
of their goods, and some also will occur (which kind of poverty is the most
irksome) poor in their riches. Thou shall meet with some that are
shipwracked, or such as have suffered some such like thing unto shipwreck,
whom either the wrath or envy of the common sort (which is a dangerous weapon
to wound the better sort) has overthrown unawares, and when they were most
secure, after the manner of a gust, which is wont to break forth in the most
seeming s^curite of a calm, or a sudden lightning, at whose crack the
neighboring countries have trembled. For even as he that is nearest to this
^ire, remains as much amazed, as if he had been stricken: in like sort, in
these accidents that come by violence, the calamity oppresses one, but
fears the rest, and makes the ability to suffer equal with the heaviness of
those that do suffer. Other men's misfortunes, which surprise them at unawares,
astonish the minds of all those that see them. And even as the only noise of
a sling^ although it be not charged, frighteth the birds. In like manner, we
not only tremble at the stroke, but at the least crack we hear. No man
therefore can be blessed, that has credited himself to this opinion. For
nothing is blessed, but that which is without fear: the life is miserable that
is incombe^ed with suspicion. Whosoever has addicted himself very much unto
casualties, has made himself a great and inexplicable matter of perturbation.
There is but one way for him to tract, that will search out a life full of
assurance, which is to contemn the goods of Fortune, and to content himself
with that which is honest. For if any man thinks that there is any other
thing better then virtue, or that there is any other good besides the same: he
opens his bosom to that which Fortune spreads, and with extreme care
expects those goods whereof she makes larges. Suppose, and imagine in thy
mind, that Fortune makes public plays, and that she casts amiddest this
great assembly of men, honors, riches, and favors, whereof the one part is
broken and torn in pieces, between the hands of those that ravish them;
another part is unequally divided by a disloyal society; and another has
wrought their inestimable damage, that have engrossed them; and finally also
some others, have fallen into the hands of some they thought not any wise of,
and others have been lost by running after the same ouer-greedily, and they
have bin torn out of our hands by reason of the ouer-greedy desire which we
had to attain them. To conclude, there is not any, how happy soever his
rauishment be, whose joy, in respect of that he has ravished, can endure long
time. For which cause, the wiser sort, as soon as they see the pr^sents
brought in, fly out of the theater, as knowing well, that a little thing would
cost them dear. No man fights with him that retireth, no man strikes him
that flies, it is upon the prey the contention grows. The same succ^s^e is
there in those things that Fortune casts down from on high. We burn in
miserable desire after these goods, we are in great travel, we desire to have
many hands; now regard we this man, presently that man, we think that they are
too slowly sent unto us which stir up our desires, and that it can fall but
into few men's hands, although it be expected and desired by all men. We desire
to encounter those that fall^ we laugh if we may surprise any thing, and some
other envy, whom vain hope has deceived. We redeem a lamentable damage
with a little prey, or thereby were deceived. Let us therefore depart from
these plays, and let us give place to these rauishers. Let these men fix
their intention as much as they will on those goods which hang in the air, and
let themselves likewise be more in suspense. Whosoever is resolved to be
blessed, let him resolve there is but one good, which is honestly. For if he
supposes that there is any other good; first of all he judges evil of Gods
providence, because many mishaps befall good men: and because all that which
she has given us, is but of a very small continuance, if thou compare it with
the age of the whole world. From this complaint it grows, that we are
ungrateful interpreters of divine things. We complain, because goods befall
us not every day, that they are little, that they are incertaine, and that they
must suddenly depart from us. Hence comes it to passe^ that we will not
live, neither have desire to die; we hate life, and we fear death. All our
counsels are uncertain, and ther^ is no felicity that can satisfy us. The
cause hereof is nothing else, but that we have not as yet attained that
sovereign good, which cannot be surmounted by any other thing, and on which we
ought to stay our desires, for above the place that is most highest, there is
no other place. Ask thou me why virtue has need of nothing? Because she is
pleased with things present, and desires not the absent. There is nothing but
seems great unto her, because that every thing suffices her. And if thou
should separate thy self from this opinion, neither piety nor faith should
have any place. He that would follow both the one and the other, shall be
constrained to suffer very much of that which we call evil, and to spend much
of that which we esteem and reckon of for good. Furthermore, constancy that
must make trial of her self is lost, magnanimity is lost also, because she
cannot approve her self, except she contemn al things as over base, which the
common sort desires as the most greatest. In brief, the grace and requital
of all good turns is lost, it is but pain and travel, if we think that
there is any other thing more precious then faith, and if we fix not our eyes
on that which is the best. But to let these things pass, either those that are
called goods, or none at all; or a man is happier then God. For God makes no
use of those goods which are prepared for us, disordinate pleasures, foolish
expenses in banquets, riches, nor any of that which may allure a man, or draw
him to loathsome pleasures, appertain not to him. We must then say (that which
is incredible) either that God has want of these goods: or we must conclude
upon this argument, that whatsoever God wants is not good. Furthermore, there
are many things that would be thought to be goods, which are more amply
employed on beasts then on men. They eat with more greater appetite, they are
not so soon wearied in the act of generation, their forces are more great and
lasting, whereby it follows that they are more happy then man: for they live
without wickedness or deceit, they enjoy their pleasures, which they enjoy
more fully, and more easily, without any fear of shame or repentance. Consider
thou therefore, whether that is to be called good, wherein God is overcome by
man. Let us lodge the sovereign good in our mindes^ He loses all his grace
and dignity, if from the better part, which is in us, it should be translated
to the worse, and should be transferred to the senses, which are more active in
brute beasts. Our chiefest felicity is not to be planted in the flesh. Those
are true goods which reason gives, they are solid and everlasting; which
cannot fall, neither be decreased nor diminished. The rest are goods in
opinion, they have only a common name with the true, but they have no
property or effects of virtue in them. Let them then be called commodities, or
according to our phrase, profits and revenues. But let us know that they are
but as our slaves, and not any part of us, let them be in such sort with us;
that we remember our selves that they are without us, and if they be with us,
we must put them in the number of those things which are most base and abject,
and for which no man ought to wax proud. For what is more foolish, then for a
man to please himself, in that which himself has not done? Let all these
things approach us, but not cleave unto us, and if they must be drawn from
us, let them be so severed, that we be not distracted and torn thereby. Let us
use them, and not glory in them, and let us use them sparingly, as such things
as are lent us, and are not to remain with us. Whosoever uses them contrary
to reason, he has not long time enjoyed them. For felicity it self hu^teth
us, excep^ it be well tempered and governed: is ouer-pressed, if she trust her
self to transitory goods, she is quickly forsaken, and le^t she should be
forsaken, she tormenteth her self infinitely. There are few men who ^aue had
the fortune to lay by their felicity contentedly. The rest of men, with those
goods that made them esteemed above others, are dejected, and that which for a
time exalted them, ^inally humbles them. Much wisdom therefore must be made
use of, which may dispose them with measure and parsimony. For a disordinate
liberty over bears and destroys his proper riches in such sort, that
immeasurable expense has never continued long, if reason by her moderation had
not restrained the same. The miserable end of diverse cities will make thee know
this, whose luxurious empires in their first flower and pride have decayed, and
will teach thee, that all that which has bin gotten by virtue, is ruinated by
superfluity and lavish expense. Against these casualties are we to arm our
selves. There is not any wall that can r^sis^ the batteries of ^ortune: and it
is within us, that we ought to arm our selves. If that noble fortress be
assured, a man may be assailed, but he cannot be surprised. Will thou know what
fortification it is? That he trouble not himself with any thing that may
happen, that he believe that whatsoever, yea even that which seems to offend
him, depends on the conservation of the whole world, and that it is a part of
that which finisheth the course and office of the heavens. A man ought to take
pleasure in all that which God takes pleasure in, he ought to admire
himself, and all that which is in him, for this only consideration, that he
cannot be vanquished, that he holds his evil under his feet, and that with
reason, then which nothing is more powerful, he surmounteth Fortune, grief
and injury. Love reason then, for the love thereof will arm thee against all
the greatest misfortunes that may be. The love of their young ones causes wild
beasts, to fall into snares, who otherwise by their fierceness and violence
were untameable. Sometimes the desire of glory has drawn some young and
generous minds into contemp^, both of sword and fire^ the opinion and shadow
of virtue has egged some on to seek out a voluntary death. But the stronger
and constanter reason is against all this, the more vehement and violent
becomes she against all fear and danger. You do nothing, will some man
say, because you deny that there is any other good but honesty. This defense
of yours shall not make you strong and impregnable against Fortune. For you say
that amongst these goods, a man ought to include obedient children, cities well
governed, and parents that are honest. And yet if these be in any danger, you
cannot see it without astonishment. For a siege of thy city, the death of thy
children, and the bondage of thy parents will trouble thee. But I will set thee
down what it is, that is accustomably answered for us in this case^ and then
again will I add what besides that may be answered in my judgment. There is
another condition in those things which being taken from us, substitute some
other incommoditie in their place, as health being impaired, changes it self
into sickness, the sight of the eye extinguished, affects us with blindness,
and when the ^ammes are cut, not only sinews perish, but debilitie
follows in stead thereof. And yet danger is not in those things, which we
have spoken of a little before: Why? Because that if I have lost a good friend,
I must not therefore be perfidious for him, neither if I have buried good
children; there is no reason that impiety should supply their place, to
endanger and hurt me. Moreover, by this death, friends and children are not
lost, it is but the body. But good cannot be lost, but by one only mean, that
is, if it should change it self into evil, which Nature permits not, for
all v^rtu^s and all their actions remain incorruptible. Again, although that
friends, although that well approved children, and have in nothing contradicted
their fathers commands, be dead, yet notwithstanding, ^here is something that
may supply their place. Ask thou me what it may be? It is that virtue that
has made them good men. She suffers not at any tim^, that there should be
any place void. She entirely takes seizure of our souls, she exterminat^th
the sorrow of all things, and contenteth her self to be alone. For the power
and original of all goods is in her. What skilleth it if the water that flows
be stolen, or ^^ee^e away, if the fountain from whence it issues be living
and replenished. Thou will not say, that a man is more just, because his
children are yet alive, or for that they ar^ dead^ no more moderate, more
honest, more wise, more better, consequently a great number of friends make not
a man more wise, neither the diminution, or want of them, makes him not more
foolish, and consequently also, neither more happy, nor more miserable. As long
as thy virtue shall remain entire, thou shall never feel any loss that thou
have made. What then? Is not he who is environed with a goodly troop of
friends and children more happy? Why should he not be? Because the sovereign
good cannot be^ diminished or augmented. He always remains after the same
fashion. Howsoever Fortune carry her self, although the years be old, or
that he die before he be aged, it is one and the same measure of the sovereign
good, although it be different in age. Whether thou make a circle greater or
lesser; it is but in respect of the space, but not of the figure: and although
the one has remained a long time painted, and that thou have incontinently
defaced the other, and covered it with dust in the place where thou have cast
it; yet both the one and the other were the same figure. That which is right
and just is not esteemed by the greatness, nor by the number, nor by the time;
it can neither be lengthened nor strengthened. Take as much as thou will, an
honest life that endured an hundred years, and reduce and determine it in one
only day, the one is as honest as the other. Virtue extends it self more at
large: she governs Kingdoms, Cities, and whole Provinces, she makes laws,
she priseth and honoreth friendships, she distributeth offices and duties
between the nearest parents and their children; and presently she
circumscribeth her self in a straiter scope of poverty, banishment, and loss
of children. Yet is she not lessened, although that from a great and high
estate she is fallen, into a private and particular, and from a royal throne,
to an abject and base place. And if from a public and ample power, she
restrain her self in a homely cottage, or in some corner she is always as
great, if after she has been driven from all places, she solely retire her
self into her self. For this notwithstanding, she has a courage great and
invincible, a prudence tha^ is perfect, a justice immutable, and consequently
she is always happy. For this blessedness and this good is lodged in one only
place, that is to say, in the mind. It is everlasting, and full of
tranquillity, which cannot be without the knowledge of divine and humane
things. It follows now, that which I said I would answer. A wiseman
tormenteth not himself for the loss of his children, nor his friends, for he
endures their death with as equal constancy and courage, as he expects his
own. He fears the one as little as he grieueth for the other, because virtue
consists in conueniencie, all her works are agreeable with he^ self, and
answer one another. This concord would be last, if the mind which should be
assured and constant, should suffer it self to be ouercom with sorrow and
sadness. All sorts of astonishment, all fear, all idleness and slackenesse
in any act whatsoever, is dishonest. For all that which is honest is full of
assurance; and diligence; it is never astonished, but always prepared. What
then, shall he not feel some passion like unto trouble? Shall he not change
his color? Shall not his countenance discover some perturbation, shall not his
members wax chill? and all other things which a man does not by the command of
the mind, but by a sudden and inconsiderate heat of nature? I confess he
shall. But he shall always be thus persuaded, that none of all this is evil,
nor worthy that a good understanding should be astonished at. All that which he
ought to do, he will do boldly and readily: for who is he that will not say
that it is the proper nature of folly, to perform that cowardly and against
his heart which he does, and to drive the body into one place, and the mind
into another; and to suffer himself to be drawn by so many contrary motions.
That every thing for which she esteems her self so much, and for which she
enters into admiration of her self, makes her contemptible^ and besides,
that which is worse, she performs not that with a good will, from whence she
takes her glory. But if she fears that any evil should befall her, she
perplexeth her self in exspectation thereof: she tormenteth her self as if
the evil had already attainted her; and all that which she fears she may
suffer hereafter, she presently suffers by the means of her fear. Even as
there are certain signs that appear in the body before the fever comes
(for a man feelet^ a dullness in the sinews, a lassitude, a gaping or yawning,
and a horror which passes through all the members) In like sort a sick mind
feels some shakings and assaults, which enfeeble him before the evil touch
him: he enters into sorrows, and loses his heart before the time. But what
more greater folly may a man see, then for a man to dismay his mind for such
things as are yet to com? and not to be able to reserve himself to suffer the
torment when it shall come, but to summon miseries a far off, and to approach
them, before they press him; which he were better to delay if he might not
avoid. Will thou know that no man ought to be tormented for that which is to
come? Whosoever shall hear it said, that some fifty years hence he must be
led to execution, he will not torment himself, because he has past the half
of this time, and that he is not plunged in this disquiet of mind, which should
not com but in an age after. The like befalls those spirits that are
voluntarily sick, and do nothing but seek occasion of sorrow, who are sad for
things long since forepassed and forgotten. All that which is past and which is
to come, is absent. We neither perceive the one nor the other. But there is no
grief but of that which thou feel.

EPIST. LXXV.
That Philosophy affects not words, and yet neither renounceth wit nor good
discourse. The chiefest, matter is, that the life be correspondent to the
words. Furthermore let us endeavor to proceed, because we are to ascend by
degrees, and they are three. The degrees of those that are proficient.

THou complainest that the Letters which I send thee, are not written
ouer-curiously^ but who is he that writes in so an affected style, but he that
would write to insinuate? Such as my speech should be if we were sitting
together, or if men walked out together, easy and without Art: such will I
that my Epistles be, that they neither be extrauagant nor affected. If it were
possible that a man might understand that which I think, I had rather
expressed it by signs, then by words. And if I should dispute likewise, I
would not stamp upon the ground, nor cast my hands abroad, nor lift up my
voice: I would leave that to Orators, and content my self to have made thee
understand my conceit, without enriching my speech, or neglecting it also. I
would plainly persuade thee this one point, that I firmly believe that which
I say, and that I not only believe the same, but love it also. Men kiss their
Mistress in one sort, and their children in another; and notwithstanding in
this embracement, so holy and so chaste affection sufficiently discovers it
self. Truly I would not that my discourses which men hold of so great
matters, should be dull and dry: for Philosophy renounceth not a happy and
gentle spirit, yet will she not likewise that we employ overmuch affectation
in our discourse. In brief, see here what is the sum of our intention. Let
us speak what we think, and think what we speak; let our speech be
answerable to our life: he has fulfilled his promise who is the same when thou
see him, and when thou hear him: we shall see what he is, and how great he
is; but he must always be one. It is not necessary that our words be
pleasing, but that they profit. But if eloquence may befall any man, without
much labor and affectation, if it be already acquired, or has cost him
little, let him bouldly make use thereof, and employ it in worthy subjects.
Let it be such that it rather express the matter, then it self. All other
Arts appertain only to the wit, but nothing is entreated of here but the
affairs of the mind. The sicke-man seeks not out an eloquent Physician, but
such a one as knows how to cure well: yet if so be it so fall out, that he
who knows how to heal well, discourses eloquently of that which he ought to
perform, he ought not to be displeased thereat. Neither also ought he to
rejoice, because he is fallen into the hands of a Physician that can speak
well: for it is as much as if a skillful Master of a Ship were a goodly man
also. Why scratchest thou mine ears? Why delightest thou me? Thou must; there
is another thing now in hand, thou must minister me an actual ca^ter^e, I must
be lanced, I must have a Diet prescribed me: for this cause art thou called.
Thy duty is to heal an old sickness that is dangerous and public. Thou
have as much to do as the Physician in the plague time. Will thou spend the
time about words? If thou finish the cure then may thou rejoice. When shall
it be that thou will lodge that which thou have learned so inwardly in thy
self, that it may never more depart from thee? When will thou make trial
thereof? for it suffices not to commit them to memory, as thou do other
sciences: Thou must assay to put them in execution. He that knows all this is
not happy, but he that does it. What then, are there no degrees under him? May
a man upon the sudden attain unto wisdom? I cannot believe it: for he that
profits is counted amongst the number of fools, yet is he estranged from them
by a great distance, and amongst those that are proficient also there are great
differences: they are divided, as some say, into three ranks; The first are
they that have not as yet attained wisdom, but are already settled near unto
it, although that which is near is as yet without. Thou will ask me who these
are? They are those who have already laid aside all their affections and
vices, and that have learned that which they ought to embrace, but their
assurance is not as yet experimented. They have not as yet the use of their
good; yet can they not fall again any more on that which they have already
fled. They are so far forward that they cannot r^tire back, but they know it
not as yet. And as I remember I have written in a certain Epistle, they know
not that they do know it. They can already make use of their good but their
confidence is yet unassured. Some there are that speak thus of this sort of
men, who profit and whom I speak heretofore and say that they have already
escaped the sicknesses of the mind, but not the passions; and that they are as
yet affraide to fall, because no man is out of the danger of vice, but he that
has wholly driven it from him; but no one drives it away but he that has
assumed wisdom in his place. I have oftentimes told what differences there
are betwixt the sicknesses of the soul, and the passions of the mind. Yet
will I refresh the memory thereof unto thee. The sicknesses are inueterate and
obdurate vices, such as are avarice, and over great ambition, at such time as
they have entangled the mind, and have begun to be a perpetual sickness.
And to be short, the sickness is an obstinate judgment in wicked things, as
if a man should greatly desire that which he ought not to desire but slightly;
or if thou like it better, we may define it thus. To desire that
ouer-vehemently which we ought to wish for slightly, or which a man should not
any ways wish or desire; or else to prise that overmuch which a man should
prise very little or nothing at all. Affections are improbable, sudden and
violent motions of the mind, which being frequent an^ neglected, have caused a
sickness, as a descent and distillation of rhume does; which being as yet
unformed, engenders a cough: but if it continue and waxes old, it becomes
Phthisis. Even so they who have already profited much, are out of sickness,
yet feel they as yet some passions, yet are they near unto perfection. The
second sort is of those who have escaped the greatest passions and sickenesses
of the soul, but it is in such a sort that they are not certain in the
possession of their security; for they may fall again into their infirmities.
This other third sort is exempt from a number of the greater vices, but not out
o^ all: he has fled from avarice, but is as yet sensible of wrath: he is no
more subject to pleasures and voluptuousness, but he is full of ambition: he
is not covetous, but he is as yet fearful and timorous; but in this fear^ he
is sufficiently assured in some things, and shows himself remiss in some
other things: he contemns death, but he fears dolor. Let us think a
little upon this third place: it will be well with us, if we be admitted unto
this third number. It is with a great felicity of nature, and with a study
accompanied with a great and industrious diligence, that a man enters into the
second rank: yet must we not despise those of the third order. Think with thy
self how many evils thou seeest about thee; behold how there is not any
offense how detestable soever it be, of which we cannot show some examples. See
how wickedness increases daily, and what faults are committed both in
public and private; and thou shall understand that we have profited enough,
if we be not ranked amongst the worst. But I hope, say thou, that I may be
made one of the honorable order. I should rather wish us this good fortune,
then promise it. We are already seized and arrested: we run after virtue,
but we are entangled and sna^ed in vices. I am ashamed to speak it; we follow
not honest things, but then when we can do nothing else. But how great a
reward attends us, if we would wholly break off our occupations, and shake
off those evils which hold us captive. Neither desire, neither fear should
compel us, but being freed from all terrors, entire and incorrupted against
all pleasures, we should no more be affraide of death, or of the Gods: We
should understand that neither death is evil, and that the Gods are good: as
infirm and feeble is that which may hurt, as that to whom it hurts. The best
things, and such as never hurt, do expect us when we shall depart one day out
of this order, to mount those high and sublime places with a placabilitie of
mind, and after the errors shall be driven away, with an entire and perfect
liberty. Ask thou what it is? Not to fear men or Gods, neither to will
that which is dishonest nor desire overmuch, and to have the greatest power
over himself. It is an inestimable good for a man to be able to become his
own.

EPIST. LXXVI.
That he hears Philosophy, and goes to the Schools. He complains of the
negligence and sloth of men, which learn other things, and neglect
Philosophy. Do not thou so, my LVCILIVS, make have and learn goodness. What
good? That which is only honest. And again he approves by arguments that it
is so, and that other things are not. A laudable and wise Epistle.

THou threatnest me that thou will be mine enemy, if so be I conceal ought
from thee of those things which I daily do. Behold how freely and simply I
live with thee: for this also will I impart unto thee, I hear a Philosopher,
and for these five days past already have I haunted the school, and have
heard him dispute from eight of the clock. I am old enough, will thou say, to
go thither: and why should not this age be good? What greater folly may there
be, then because of long time thou have not learned, not to learn at all? What
then, shall I do nothing else but that which those yongfull and refreshed
wantons do, I should think my self happy, if there were nothing ill
beseeming mine age but that. This School admits men of all ages. Let us
wax old in this School, we must follow it, as if as yet we were young. Shall
I go unto the Theater as old as I am? shall I cause my self to be carried to
the sports and public spectacles? shall not one couple of combatants be
singled out to fight, except I be a looker on? and shall I be ashamed to go
and see a Philosopher? So long art thou to learn as long as thou art ignorant;
and if we give credit to the Proverb, so long as thou live: neither can
this more fitly be applied to any thing then to this, so long art thou to
learn in what manner thou should live, as long as thou live. Yet teach I
also something in this School. Ask thou me what I teach? Forsooth this,
that how old soever a man be, he ought alwaye^ to learn. Undoubtedly I am
ashamed to see how men live. As often as I enter into the School, I must of
necessity, as thou well know, pass by the Neapolitane Theater: it is their
way that go to Metronactes house. This Theater before I come is replenished
with people, although the greatest study that they use, is but to judge who it
is that plays best upon the Flute. A great number of men flock thither to
hear the Fifes and the Grecians Trumpets sound; but in that place where a man
learneth to be a good man, few men stay there. And these also in diverse men's
judgment seem to have no good business in hand, they call them men of little
spirit and loyterers. I should be glad to see my self mocked in this kind. A
man ought to endure patiently the injuries of the ignorant. It becomes him
that follows honest things to contemn this contempt. Courage, my Lucilius,
go forward, and make have, lest that befall thee which is fallen upon me, that
is to learn in thine old age: but haste thy self, since for the present thou
have undertaken that which thou can hardly compleately learn, although thou
should attain the fullness of thine age: how much, say thou, shall I
profit? As much as thou would assay. What expectest thou then? No man has
ever been wise by casu^ltie. Riches will come of it self, honor shall be
offered, grace and dignity happily shall be thrust upon thee: but virtue will
not befall thee, when thou little think of it, neither also with slight
travel, and little pain. He must not be weary of the travel which he
takes, who should at one time gain all the goods of this world. For there is
but one only good, that is to say, that which is honest. In those things that
are plausible to fame, thou shall find nothing true, nothing certain. I will
tell thee why that is only good which is hone^t, because thou supposest, that
in my former Epistle I have not sufficiently expressed unto thee the reason,
and for that thou think then, I have better praised, then proved this
proposition, and I will succinctly, and in few words, signify and abridge all
that which I have spoken. All things have their proper good. The Vine is
commended for his fruitfulnes, the wine for his taste, and the Heart for his
swift footing. Why ask thou, wherefore horses have strong backs? because he
only serves to bear burdens. The first thing that is required in a dog,
that is, to be employed in searching out and hunting wild beasts, is his
quick sent; if to overtake them, is his swiftnesse^ if to bite and invade
them, his fierceness. In all things that whereunto a man is borne, and for
which he is prized and esteemed, is always the best. What is the best thing
in a man? It is his reason. By it he surpasses beasts, and follows the gods
very near. So then perfect reason is a man's proper good, all other things are
such, as brute beasts partake them in common as well as he. If he be mighty,
so are Lions; if he be fair, so is the Peacocke; if he be swift, so is the
horse: I will not say that he is overcome and surpassed in all these things. I
d^spute not what that is, which is most excellent in him, but what it is that
is most proper unto him. He has a body, so have the trees; he has
vehemency and voluntary motion, both beasts and worms have no less. He has
a voice; but how far more clear^r have dogs? More shriller have E^gles,
more strong have Bulls, more sweet and delicate have Nightingales? What then
is it which is proper and best in a man? Reason. This it is that being complete
and perfect, accomplisheth a man's felicity. If therefore every thing that has
perfected his own good is praiseworthie, and has attained the end of his
nature^ and man's particular good is reason; if he has perfected the same, he
is worthy of praise, and has attained the end whereunto his nature directed
him. This perfect reason is called Virtue, and is no other thing then that
which is honest. That therefore is the only good in a man, which is the only
mark of a man. For now we enquire not what God is, but what man's good is; but
man has no other good but reason: this therefore is his only good, which is
the most precious and priseable of all others. If any man be a wicked man, he
in my opinion will be misliked of. If a good man, he will as I suppose, be
allowed of. That therefore is proper and particularly a man's, whereby he is
praised or improued. Thou doubtest not whether this be good, but whether it be
his only good. If any man should enjoy all other things; health, riches, many
images of his predecessors, adorning his fore-court, a multitude of attendants
at his Pallace-doore, and yet in all the worlds judgment he were wicked, thou
would disallow him. If likewise there were a man that has none of all these
things, which I have related, neither money, nor attendants of courtiers,
neither nobility, nor any images of his grandfathers, and great grandfathers
are arranged by order: but that were an honest man, in all men's opinion, thou
would praise him. There is then one only good in a man, whereof if any man
finds himself possessed, although he be destitue of all others, yet is he to
be praised; and if he has it not, although he have all other things in
abundance, yet is he despised and rejected. Such as the condition of all things
is, such is the condition of men. That ship is called good, not that which is
painted with p^ecious colors, or that has a silver or golden beak, nor whose
tutelar sign is enriched with Iuorie, or that is laden with goods and royal
riches, but that which is strong and firm, that is so well timbered and calked
on every side, that it admits no leake, that can sustain the breaking of
the sea, that is light of steerage, and is good of sail, howsoever the wind
drive it. Thou will say, a sword is good, not for that it has a golden belt,
or a sheath covered with precious stones, but that which has an excellent
edge, and a strong point, able to pierce an armo^r of steel. We enquire not
how fair the rule be, but how straight. Every thing ought to be praised, when
it is sorted and purueyed of that which is proper unto it. Therefore in a man
also it is nothing to the purpose, how many acres of land he plow up, how much
money he lend to use, by how many he be saluted; how rich and precious the bed
be whereon he rests, how goodly a cup he drink in, but how good a man he
is, and a good man is he, if his reason be perfect and upright, and
accommodated to the will of Nature. This is called Virtue, this is honest, and
the only good of a man. For since that only reason makes a man perfect, only
perfect reason makes him likewise happy. But that only good of a man, is that
which may only make him happy. We say likewise, that those things which
proceed and are engendered by virtue, that is to say, all her actions, are
goods; but virtue is the sole and only good, because there is not any good
without her. If all good remain in the soul, all that which makes the same
^irme and constant, all that which raises and enobleth it is good. But it is
virtue that makes the soul more strong, more excellent, and more courageous.
for all other passions that animate and incite our pleasures, do deiect and
ruinate the soul likewise, and when they seem to raise the same, they do but
pu^fe her up with pride, and deceive her with their vanities. There is then but
one only good, whereby the mind is bettered. All the actions of the whole life
are measured, either in that they are honest, or in that they are villanous^
Thereby it is that reason is governed, either to do, or not to do any things
I will tell thee what this means. A good man will do that which in his
thought may be honestly done, although it be accompanied with much travel, and
attended with loss and danger. Contrariwise he will do nothing th^^ is
dishonest, although thereby he reaped riches, pleasures, and authorities.
Nothing shall withdraw him from doing a good thing, nothing shall inuit him to
do that which is villainous. Undoubtedly then, if he must follow that which is
virtuous, he will likewise fly all that which is villainous; and in all the
actions of his life he will regard these two things, that there is no other
good, but that which is honest, nor any other evil, but that which is
villainous. Now if there be but one only virtue that remains uncorrupted, if
she only remain always in her entire virtue, it is the only good, to which
nothing may happen that may hinder her from being good. For wisdom is out of
the danger of all change, wisdom cannot be ravished, she cannot fall into
folly. I have ^old thee, if happily thou remember the same, that diverse have
contemned and trod^n under feet that which is vulgar, by an inconsiderate
heat, either desired of feared. Some have there been, that have thrust their
hands into the flame, whose smiles the tormentour could not interrupt, that in
the burial of their children have not shed one tear, and that have presented
themselves to death without any fear. Love, wrath, covetousness, has
oftentimes made them seek out perrills. If therefore a short resolution of the
soul pricked forward by some pregnant occasion, may do this, with what more
greater resolution shall virtue do it, that gathers her forces, not from
rashness or any sudden motion, but a constancy and perpetual power? It
follows then, that those things which are often contemned by the
inconsiderate, and by wise men always, that they are neither good nor evil.
Virtue then is the only good, that marches proudly between both the one and
the other Fortune, and despises them both^ And if thou enter into this
opinion, that there is any other good, but that which is honest, all virtues
shall be in trouble. For no man might attain any of them, if she desired any
thing that were out of her self; and if this were, it should be contrary to
reason, from whence virtues proceed; and to truth, which is always accompanied
with reason. But all opinion which is contrary to truth, is false. Thou must
needs confess, that a good man carries great piety and reverence toward
the gods, and for this cause he will patiently endure all that which may befall
him. For he well knows that all this is befalne him by the will of the gods,
by which all things are conducted. And if it be thus, he will think that to be
the only good, which is honest. For in honesty consists the obedience to
the gods, the patient sufferance of those accidents, which may follow the
constant entertainment of fortunes, and the willing acceptance of that the gods
will, and the performance of their commandments. If there were any other good,
but that which is honest, we should be attended with an insatiable desire of
life, and an affection to all that which entertaineth life: a thing
intolerable, infinite, and that which extends it self over far. The only
good then is that which is honest, that has a certain measure. We have said
that the life of man should be more happy then that of the gods, if that
whereof the gods make no use were goods, of which kind are riches and estates.
Furthermore, if the souls survive the bodies after they are departed from
them, a more happy estate attends them, then that which they then possessed,
when they were imprisoned in the body. And yet if those things which we use by
the means of the body were goods, they should be more unfortunate after they
were departed from the same, but no man can any ways believe, that being
enclosed and imprisoned, they should be more happy, then when they are
released and set at liberty through the whole world. I have moreover said
this, that if it be a good that equally befalls both man and brute beasts,
that beasts likewise should enjoy a happy life, which cannot be true in any
manner. We must suffer all things for honesty sake, which we should not do,
if there were any other good but that which is honest. All this, although I
have more amply debated upon in my former Epistle, I have thought good to
abbreuiate in these few words. Yet never will this opinion seem true unto
thee, except thou rowse thy mind, and question with thy self, whether, if
need required, thou would die for thy country, and to save the life of all
other thy fellow citizens, thou would lose thine own, and yield thy neck,
not only with patience, but with a free will? If thou can do this, there is
no other good. Thou leauest all things, that thou may have this. See how
great the force of honesty is. And although thou should not do it
presently, yet should it be at least, as soon as thou ought to do it.
Sometimes in a very short space of time a man receives a great joy of a very
fair thing. And although some fruit of a work already performed, can do
little profit to the dead, when he shall be out of this world, yet the only
thought of that which he would do, rejoices and comfort him; and a just
and constant man, when he sets before his eyes the price of his death, which
is the liberty of his country, and the life of all those, for whom he employeth
his life, he feels a great pleasure, and already pertaketh the fruit of his
peril. But he also who is deprived of this pleasure, which the exe^ution of
this work would yield him, as the greatest and last pleasure of his life,
without any more delay will encounter his death, and content himself that he
has done justly and piously. Contrariwise, set thou now before his eyes diverse
reasons that may dissuade him. Tell him, that this worthy act which thou have
done, shall be suddenly forgotten, the Citizens will not be so thankful as
thou deseruest; he will answer thee. All this is out of the action I have
done, I contemplate and consider it in it self, I know it is honest. Therefore
it is that, into what place soever I am led, into what place soever I am
called, I am there. It is then the only good which a perfect soul, not only
feels, but a generous man, and such a one as is of a good nature. All other
things are of little esteem, and subject to change. And therefore it is that a
man cannot possess them without much care and trouble of mind, although the
favor of Fortune had assembled them all together into one man's possession, yet
are they for no other use, but a burden to their master; they pr^sse him
always, and sometimes ouerwhelme him. There is not any one of those, whom thou
have clothed in purple, that is happy, no more then are they that bear a
royal Scepter in their hands, and a Mantle on their backs upon a stage in
acting a play. For after they have marched in their proud array and buskins
before the people, as soon as they depart from them they are disapparelled,
and return to their former estate. There is not one of those, whom riches and
honors have raised to the highest places, that is great. Why then seems he to
be great? Thou measurest him by his show. A dwarf will be always little,
although he be set upon a mountain; and huge statue will retain his
greatness, though it stand in a ditch. We are blinded with this error, and
thus are we deceived, because we esteem no man by that which is in him, but we
add unto him his ornaments. But when thou will have a true estimate of a man,
and know what a one he is, behold him naked: let him lay aside his patrimony,
his honors, and those other flattering and false goods of Fortune. Let him
dispossess himself of his body, behold his mind, what and how great it is,
whether of his own good, or by another: if he dare look on a drawn sword
with a manly eye, if he know that there is no great matter whither his soul
depart, by his mouth, or by his throat; call him happy. That at such time when
he shall hear that he must endure bodily torments, or such evils as happen by
casualtie, or by the plot of great men, that if he must suffer bonds and exile,
and the vain fears of humane minds, securely hears them, and says. Not
any new suspicion of mishap,
O Virgin, shall my settled mind entrap:
All these have I forethought long time ago,
My dangers are sorecast in weal and woe.
Thou tellest me all this to day, I have always denounced it to my self. I
have disposed man unto all humane things. The stroke of mischief which a man
foreseeth, is less troublesome and more light. But to fools, and such as
credit Fortune, the face and appearance of things seems new and unexpected,
and novelty for the most part is the greatest cause of evil to the ignorant.
That thou may know this, they suffer patiently those things that they
thought difficult, when they are accustomed thereunto. Therefore it is, that a
wiseman inureth himself to evils that may befall him, and that which others
by a long patience make light and easy, the wiseman does it after he has
long time thought: we hear oft-times the discourses of these ignorants, which
say, I had not thought that this would as yet befall me; but the wiseman
knows that all things are incident to him, and confesses, that he knows
very well all that which may happen.

EPIST. LXXVII.
And this by the way, is to be numbered amongst those that are good and
profitable. He entreats by the way of the Alexandrian Fleet, how whilst
other ran out to see them, he neglected them. For what avail these? or how
long? I am old, I am going hence, and at length I must willingly depart as
MARCELLINVS did. Then against the fear of death, and that the reasons thereof
are to be contemned.

THis day upon the sudden that Alexandrian Ships appeared unto us, which are
usually sent before the Fleet, to give tidings of the fortunate approach of
the Navy, which men call Friggats or Ships of message. The view of these was
grateful and welcome to all Campania. All the people of Pozzolo climed up upon
the Piles to behold them, and by the manner of their sails knew them from the
rest, notwithstanding that they were intermingled with a great bulk of other
shipping: for they only have liberty to spread their top-saile, which in
their top all ships have. For there is nothing that helps their course so
much as that upper part of the sail: for by it the Ships course is most of all
furthered; and therefore as often as the wind increases, and is more violent
then it ought to be, the top-yard is stricken for the wind, has less force
over the body of the ship. But when they have entered Capreas and the
Promontorie, from whence, PALLAS from high of stormy Mountain spies.
All other ships are commanded to content themselves with their maine sail;
the top-sayle is the mark to know the Alexandrian ships. Amidst the course of
all these people that ran thus hastily to the Sea shore, I felt a very great
pleasure in my sloth, because that thinking to receive Letters from mine
agents, I made no have to know in what estate my affairs stood, or what they
had brought me. For long ago nothing has been gotten or lost by me. This
opinion should I maintain, although I were not old: but now the rather,
because how little soever I had, I have more to make use of them, I have time
to live, especially since we are entered into that way, which we need not to
accomplish. The journey will be imperfect, if thou stay either in the midway
or stand on this side the prefixed place: the life is not imperfect, if it be
honest. Wheresoever thou endest, if the end be good it is entire: we ought
likewise often and courageously to end, and not for great causes, for these are
not the mightiest that hold us. Tullius Marcellinus (whom thou know very
familiarly) who was temperate in his youth, and quickly an old man, being
surprised by a sickness which was not incurable yet long and tedious, and such
as commanded him to suffer much, began to deliberate and conclude upon his
death. To this intent he called together diverse of his friends. Every one of
these being naturally timorous, gave him that counsel they would have
entertained themselves, or if there were a slatterer, or any one that studied
to please him, he gave him that advice, that he thought would be best pleasing
to him that demanded the question. Our friend Asticho, a worthy man, and that I
may dignifie him with those titles, wherein he worthily deserves praise, a man
courageous and valiant, counseled him in my opinion very nobly: for he began
thus; Torment not thy self, friend MARCELLINE, as if thou deliberatedst on any
important affair. It is no great matter to live all thy slaves live, and all
other beasts also. It is a great matter to die honestly, prudently and
valiantly. Bethink thy self ^or how long time together thou have done the
same thing. Meat, sleep, lust, by this circle all the world comes. Not
only a valiant man, a strong man, a miserable man can have a will to die, but
he also that disdaineth life. He needed no man to counsel him hereunto, but
some assistant; for his slaves would not obey him. First of all he took from
them all fear, and taught them that slaves were in great danger, when as it
was incertaine whether the death of the Lord were voluntary or no. For
otherwise it should be as dangerous an example to hinder a Master to die, as to
kill him. Afterward he admonished Marcellinus himself, that even as when
supper is ended, the remainder is divided on those that attend; so when life is
ended, somewhat is bequeathed to those who had been attendants during the
whole life time. Marcellinus was a man of a gentle and facile disposition, and
liberal even in those things which were his proper goods: he therefore
distributed some small sums amongst his weeping servants, and comforted them
himself: he needed not either sword or shedding of blood, for three days he
abstained, and in his very chamber he caused his Pauillion to be raised;
afterward his bath was brought thither, in which he lay long time, and caused
water to be oftentimes cast upon him, so by little and little fainted and
failed he, not without a certain pleasure, as he said (which a slight fainting
is wont to bring) not vnapproued unto us, who are sometimes subject to
soundings. I have made relation of this story unto thee, which I know will not
be distastefull to thee, because thereby thou shall understand the manner of
thy friends death, which was neither difficult nor miserable: for although he
procured his own death, yet departed he and escaped most sweetly out of life.
Neither will this story be unprofitable to thee; for necessity oftentimes
exacteth such examples. We oft-times must die, yet we will not: we die, and
yet we will not. There is no man so ignorant, but that he knows that one day
he must die, but when the time approaches near he plays the coward,
trembles and weepeth. Would thou not esteem him the foolishest of all men,
that should weep because he lived not a thousand years ago? As foolish is he
that weepeth because he shall not live a thousand year after. Those are equal
thou shall not be, neither wast thou: both these two times are not our own.
Thou art cast upon this point, which although thou might prolong, how long
would thou prolong it? Why weepest thou? What wishest thou? Thou losest thy
labor; Cease thou to hope that prayers so powerful be,
That they can change the des^inies decree.
They are firm and fixed^ they are led by an eternal and powerful
necessity. Thou shall go thither whither all things go. Why think thou
this a new matter? Thou art borne under this condition, thy father has had the
like hap, this has thy mother met withal, this have thy predecessors known,
this shall befall all men after thee. It is an invincible success and order
that no force can change, and that tyeth and traineth all things with it. O how
great number of people shall follow thee when thou ar^ dead? How many are that
shall accompany thee? Thou would in my opinion be more constant, if diverse
thousands of m^n should die with thee. And yet many thousands of men and beasts
shall los^ their lives by diverse sorts of death, at that very in^tant when
thou make it a difficulty to die. But did thou not think that one day
thou should attain thither whither thy journey was always intended? There
is no journey without end. Think thou that I will recount unto thee at this
present examples of diverse great personages? No, I will but tell thee some of
young lads: The memory of that young Lacedemonian will never be lost, who
having scarcely a hair upon his chin, and being taken prisoner, cried out in
that his Dorique tongue, I will not serve, and confirmed his words by effect;
for as soon as he was commanded to do some servile and base office (for some
commanded him to empty the close stool) he did beat out his brains against
the wall. Our liberty being so near, is there any man will serve? Had d^st
thou not rather thy son should die thus, then wax old in idleness? What is
there therefore why thou should be perplexed, if to die courageously be but
a fchildes play? Think thou that thou will not follow, thou shall be
enforced. Make that to be in thy power which is in another man's. Will thou not
take upon thee this young man's courage, and say, I will not serve? O miserable
wretch! thou art slave unto men, thou art slave unto things, thou art slave to
thy life: for life if it want the courage to die, is a true servitude. Have
thou any thing for which thou should expect? Thou have spent those pleasures
that attended and retained thee. There is not any that is new unto thee, not
any but is now odious unto thee, because thou have surfeited therewith. Thou
know what the taste of wine is, and what is the taste of Methegling: it
skils not whether a hundredth or a thousand vessels of wine pass by thy
bladder: thou art a sack: thou have often learned what the Oyster is, what the
Mullet favors thou know well, thy foolish expense has reserved nothing
for time to com, which thou have not already devoured. Now these are they from
which thou art drawn so unwillingly. What other thing besides this is there
which should yield thee discontent, if it were taken from thee? Are they thy
friends and thy country? Have thou so much ever honored the sun, that for her
thou would have deferred thy supper? Thou would sooner choke up the
brightness of the sun if thou could. For what has been ever done by
thee that is worthy the light? Confess, I pray thee, that there is not any
amity that thou bear to the Senate or Palace, or to the nature of things
which withdraws thee from dying. It is in spite of thy teeth that thou
leauest the shambles, in which thou have left nothing. Thou fear death: but
how would thou contemn it in the midst of thy pleasures? Thou desire
but to live; for thou know well what it is, and have fear of death: but
what is this life, is it not death? Caligula passing through the Latin way,
when as one of those that were led prisoners, that had a long beard and
hoarie hairs, besought him to give him leave to die. What said he, live thou
yet? The same answer must be made unto those to whom death might bring any
comfort. Have thou fear to die, and why live thou yet? But I, says he, will
live; for I employ my self in many honest affairs. I leave those offices and
functions of life unwillingly, which I discharge both faithfully and
industriously. What, know thou not that it is one of the offices of life to
die? Thou leauest no office, for the number of the duties which thou art to
accomplish being uncertain, it is determined. There is no life is not short:
for if thou have respect to the nature of things. Both Nestors and Statilias
life is short, who ordained that this should be engraven on her tomb, that she
had lived ninety nine years. See thou how this poor woman vaunteth her
self of her long life? but who could have supported her glory, if it had
been her fortune to have lived out full one hundred years? It fares with our
life as with a Stage Play, it skilleth not how long, but how well it has been
acted. It imports nothing in what place thou make an end of life: die where
thou will, think only to make a good conclusion.

EPIST. LXXVIII.
Of his sickenesses, yea, even in his young years, and what relief he found
for them. Honest studies (says he) and friends also, but the remedy of
remedies contempt of death. Thither calls he LVCILIVS, and disputed many
things deep, manly, and true against grief.

THe more impatiently suffered I to see thee vexed often with rhumes and
fevers, which follow long defluxions, and such as are already brought into
custom, because I my self have had experience of this sickness, whereof at
the beginning I made little reckoning. My youth could as yet support this
violence, and defend it self confidently against infirmities, but at length I
sunk under the burden, and was brought to that estate, that I my self fell
into a mortal distillation. Afterward I became by little and little so
extenuate and lean, that a sudden desire surprised me to procure mine own
death; yet my fathers old years which I dearly tendered, restrained me
therein. For I imagined not how constantly I might die, but how patiently he
might endure my loss; for which cause I commanded my self to live as yet: for
sometimes to live is a manly design. I will tell thee what recomforted me most
at that time, but so as thou be before hand advertised, that those things
wherein I took most repose, served me for a medicine. Honest pleasures are to
us in stead of remedy, and all that which may rejoice the spirit, profits
the body in like sort. My studies gave me my health. I must confess that I am
indebted to Philosophy for my recovery and health, to her I owe my life, and
less then that I cannot owe her. I have been furthered in recovery of my
health by the means of my friends, by their exhortations and watchings, and by
those discourses they entertained me with, I was very much comforted. There is
nothing (my Lucilius the best of men) that more recrea^eth and comfort a
sick man, then the a^fection of his friends. There is nothing that so much
steals away the thought and fear of death: I thought not on death when I saw
them survive me: me thought, I say, that I should live yet, not with them but
by their means: me seemed that I lost not my spirit, but that I rendered it
into their hands. All these encouraged me to assist my self, and to suffer
all sorts of torments: otherwise it is a miserable matter, when as thou have
lost thy desire to die, not to have an affection to live. Retire thy self
therefore unto these remedies. The Physician will show thee how long thou
should walk, and how much thou should exercise: he will teach thee not to
follow a repose whereunto an idle health is addicted, to read aloude, to
exercise and strengthen thy breath, when the passages of the same, and the
passages of the lungs are stopped, to sail, and make thy stomach to desist by
gentle motion and exercise, what meats thou should use when thou shall call
for wine to strengthen and comfort thee, and when thou should intermit the
same, l^st it should provoke and exasperate thy cough. But I teach thee that
which is not only a remedy for this infirmity, but of the whole life: Contemn
death. There is nothing distast^full when we fly the fear hereof. These three
things in every sickness are very tedious; the fear of death, the pain of the
body, and the intermission of pleasures. Of death there is enough spoken, I
will only say this, that this fear proceeds not from infirmities, but from
nature. Sicknesses have delayed the death of many men, and to them it has
proved security to seem to perish. Thou shall die, not because thou ar^
sick, but because thou live. This death will attend thee when thou art
recovered: when thou art freed from sickness thou shall escape, not thy death,
but thy infirmity. Le^ us now return to that incommodity that is proper to
sickness: it is accompanied with great and intolerable torments, but the
intermissions make them tolerable; for when the grief is most intended, it
suddenly grows to an end. No man can suffer an excessive pain a long time;
for Nature that loves us as much as is possible, has so prouidently provided,
that she makes our pains either tolerable or very short. The greatest
pains are felt most in those parts that are most lea^e; the nerves, the
joints, and all other parts that are thinnest are cruelly tormented, when as
corrupted humors are enclosed in th^se narrow passages, but these parts are
quickly nummed, and lose the sense of pain, by reason of the pain it self,
either because the spirits being hindered, to perform their natural course,
and changed to the worst, lose the force which makes them vigorous, and
inciteth us; or because the corrupt humor, when it wants force to flow
thither, whither it should pass, choaketh them, and depriueth those parts of
sense which are over much choked. So the gout in feet and hands, and the
pains that are felt in our joints, and nerves, are appeased when they have
stopped and stupefied the parts they have tormented. It is the first assault,
sharpnes and pricking that tormenteth, but this violence is extinguished in
time, and the end of the pain is to be wholly stupefied. The pain of the
teeth, eyes, and ears, is the most violent, because it is bred in the
narrowest and straitest parts of the body, and no less, undoubtedly, is that
of the head. But the more violent that is, the sooner is it changed into
madness or stupiditie. This therefore is the comfort in intended grief, that
thou must of necessity cease to feel the same, if thou feel it over much.
But that which most of all afflicts ignorant men, during the torment which
they feel in their bodies, proce^deth hence, because they are not accustomed
to content themselves with the goods of the mind, and for that they entertain
too much friendship with their bodies. And therefore a great and prudent man
retireth his mind from his body, and is for the most part conversant with the
better and diuiner part, and but only for necessity sake with the other,
which is frail and still plaining. But thou will say it is a tedious thing for
a man to want his accustomed pleasures, to abstain from meats, to suffer
thirst and hunger. I confess that upon the first abstinence it is a tedious
thing, but by little and little this desire is diminished, when as the things
which we desire are governed, and restrain themselves of themselves. Thence
comes it to pass, that the stomach is more tempered, and they that fed with
most ravenous appetite grown in hatred thereof. Desires and appetites die of
themselves. It is no grievous thing to want that, that thou have desisted to
long after. Moreover, there is not any grief, but has some intermission and
remission. Furthermore, a man can warrantize himself from evils that are to
come, and prevent those by remedies, which threaten and menace him. For there
is not any sickness, but has some precedent sign, yea even that which
returns by custom. Thou may bear an infirmity patiently, if thou
contemnest the extremity wherewith it threatens thee. Make not thine evils
greater then they be, and charge not thy self with complaints, the pain is
light, if opinion aggrauateth it not; contrawise, if thou begin to exhort thy
self, and to say, It is nothing, or in effect very little, let us endure the
same, and it will suddenly have an end. Thou shall make it light whilst thou
think it so. All things depend upon opinion; not only ambition, but expense
and avarice are measured by it; our pain is but opinion. A man is no more
miserable, the^ he supposes himself to be. I think that the complaints of
forepassed pains ought to be forgotten, and such words as these: There was
never any man more miserable. What torments, what evils have I suffered? No man
thought that I should ever rise again. How often have my friends bewailed me?
How often have I been given over by my Physicians? Such as have been tortured
on the rack, are not so much stretched. Although all this be true, yet is it
already passed. What pleasure take thou in the remembrance of fore-passed
pains, and to refresh thy misery that is already past: considering likewise,
that there is not any one that will add to his evil, and that lies not to
himself? Again, it is a thing very agreeable to recount the evil that is
past. It is also a thing natural to rejoice upon the end of his misery. We
must therefore drive out of us two things, the one is the fear of future
evil, and the other the remembrance of that which is past: this for the
present appertains not unto me, that not as yet, when he shall find
himself in these difficulties, he may say, And these perhaps heareafter called
to mind
Will move us to rejoice. --
Let him sight against the same with all his forces, if he yield, he shall be
overcome, if he enforce himself against his grief, he shall overcome. There
are many in these days that do this, they draw upon themselves the ruin
which they should resist. If thou retirest thy helfe from under that which
presses and oppresses thee, that hangs over thy head and menaceth thee, it
follows thee, and falls upon thee with a great weight; but if thou make
head against it, if thou will resist it, thou shall repulse it. How many
strokes and wounds do the wrestlers receive upon their faces, and their whole
bodies? yet suffer they all these torments for the ambition of glory; and
endure the same, not only because they fight, but to the end they may know how
to fight well; the exercise it self is a very torment. Let us then likewise
endeavor to surmount all travels, the price and reward whereof, is not a simple
crown, a palm, or a trumpet, which commands silence, to the end that the
praise of our name might be published, but the virtue and constancy of the
mind, and a tranquillity of the spirit which we obtain for ever, if in any
comba^e we could surmount Fortune. I feel a cruel pain, but how should
thou otherwise do but feel it, if thou endure it in no other sort, then women
do. Even as the enemy charge those most strongly, who fly most speedily:
in like sort, all the evils that Fortune sends us, charge him most violently
that loses his courage and plays the coward. But this grief is ever
violent. And why? Are we not constant but to suffer light things? Whether
had thou rather, either that thy sickness should be long, or that it should
be violent and short? If it be long, it has intermissions, and gives place to
refection, it gives much time, it must in the end forsake thee and depart. A
short and violent sickness will either do the one or the other, it will
either suddenly end, or suddenly mend thee. But what skilleth it, whether it be
not, or I be not? Since both in the one and the other, the pain has an end?
It may also profit thee much, to divert thy thoughts to some other thing, and
not to dream at all of thy pain. Set before thine eyes that which thou hast^
sometimes virtuously and honorably done: discourse with thy self on the noblest
stratagems: cast thy remembrance upon that which thou have greatly admired, and
what at that time the most constant, and they that have overcome grief,
present themselves unto thy thought, how he that stretched out his leg to
suffer his Varices to be cut, perseuered in reading his book. He likewise that
never ceased to laugh, whilst his wrathful torturers wondering thereat,
wrought upon him with all the tools and instruments of cruelty. Shall not
that pain be overcome by reason, which has been overcome by laughter? Tell
me now whatsoever thou will, both of the descent of Rhumes, and of the virtue
of a continual cough, that makes a man yield up a part of his bowels, and of
a feuor that scorcheth the intrailes, and of thirst, and of the joints of feet
and hands, which grief and pain has contracted, and dislocated. The flame,
the rack, the burning and glowing places, and that which is laid upon the
swollen wounds, to renew their pain, and to make it pierce more deep, is yet
more cruel. And yet there have been some, that have suffered all this without
complaining. It is a small matter. And has not once besought them to give
over. It is a toy. And that has never answered. It is a trifle. That has
laughed outright with all his heart. After all this, will thou laugh at pain?
But sickness, thou will say, suffers me to do nothing. It hinders me in all
my functions. Sickness attainteth the body, but not the mind. Therefore it
is that she stays the feet of him that runs, and tieth the shoomakers
hands, and hinders the smithes hammer. But thou have well learned to make use
of thy soul, thou shall admonish, thou shall teach, thou shall hear, thou
shall learn, thou shall demand, thou shall remember thy self. What then?
beleeuest thou that thou do nothing, if thou be temperate in thy sickness?
Thou shall show that the sickness may be overcome, at leastwise that it may be
endured. Trust me, virtue finds place even in the bed it self. Arms, and
following the war, do not only testify a valiant heart, and such a one as
may not be daunted with fear. A man may approve his valor and courage even in
his couerlets and sleeping clothes. Thou have enough to employ thy self in.
Fight valiantly against thy sickness, if it constrain thee to do nothing;
if it get no mastery over thee, thou shall serve for a worthy example. O how
great were the matter of our glory, if a man should come and see us when we
were sick? But cast thou thine eyes upon thy self, and praise thy self.
Beside, there are two sorts of pleasures, sickness hinders the corporal, yet
takes them not away wholly; but rather if thou will judge according to the
truth, it inciteth them. There is more pleasure in drinking when a man has
thirst, and the meat is most tastefull to him that is most an hungered. All
that which a man finds after a long abstinence, he eats with a greater
appetite. But as touching those other pleasures of the mind, which are both
greater and more assured: there is not any Physician forbids them his
patients; those whosoever follows and understands them well, contemns all
the blandishments of the senses. O unfortunate sick man. And why? Because he
mixeth not his wine with snow, because he renueth not the cold that he drinks
mixed in a great cup, by these mo^sels of ice which he breaks there into,
because those Oysters which are fished in the lake Lucern, are not opened for
him at his table, because he hears not round about his hall the rumor of his
Cooks, that bring and serve in his meat, together with the fire to keep them
warm. For prodigality and foolish expense has already ^ound out this
invention, to the intent that no meat should be cooled, and that lest the
pallet of the mouth, already hardened, should find nothing that were not very
hot; the Cook attends the supper. O unhappy sick man? he shall eat but
what he can digest: he shall not have a whole boar messed into his service,
to be sent away as course commons. He shall not be served with the pulpes of
sowles (for men now adays disdain to see them entire) assembled in dishes
apart. What wrong have thou received hereby? Thou shall sup like a sick man;
yea hereafter like a whole man. But all those things shall we easily suffer,
both brothes, warm water, and other things whatsoever seems intolerable to
delicate and voluptuous men, and such as are more sick in mind then in body.
Let us only forget the horror and fear of death. But that shall we not
forget, if we cannot distinguish the ends of evil and good. And by this means
finally we shall not feel any disgust of our life, nor any fear of death: for
a man can never be weary, or disliking of life, when it is occupied after
things so diverse, so high, and so divine. There is nothing but idle and lasie
repose that causes us to hate the same. Truth will never be tedious unto him
that trauelleth in the secrets of Nature; there is nothing but falsehood that
glutteth us. Again, if death come and call us, although it be before our time,
although it abridge us of the moitie of our lives, yet long before that time
the fruit has been gathered. All nature for the most part is known unto him,
he knows that honest things increase not by their durance or continuance.
They of necessity must suppose their lives short, who measure the same by
vain, and therefore infinite pleasures. Recreate thy self with these
thoughts, and in the interim casting thine eyes upon our Epistles, a time will
come that shall reunite us, and reassemble us, how little soever it be, the
knowledge how to use it well, will make it long enough. For, as Possidoniu^
says, One day amongst learned men dureth longer, then the longest age of an
ignorant and unlearned man. In the mean time hold this opinion constantly,
that thou must not suffer thy self to be overcome by adversities; nor trust
too much in prosperity, to have the power of Fortune always before our eyes,
as if she should do all whatsoever she can do. Whatsoever is long looked for,
is less tedious when it happens.

EPIST. LXXIX.
Somewhat of Charibdis, Scilla, and AEtna. Then that wisemen are equal
amongst themselves: and he exhorts unto wisdom, although glory accompany it
not. But it will accompany the same, though after death. Good.

I Expect thy letters, by which thou should certify me what novelty has
encountered thee in all that voyage thou have made about Sicely, and what thou
have learned of certainty, as touching Charibdis. For I know that Scilla is a
rock which is not dreadful to those that sail by it. But I have a great
desire to understand, if all those fables which have been reported by
Charibdis be true, and if happily thou have observed any thing, for it is a
thing worthy to be marked. Resolve me whether it be one wind that causes so
many Whirle-pooles, or whether every tempest alike does exasperate that Sea,
and whether it be true likewise, that all that which is devoured in this
tempest and storm of Sea by the waves, is carried away secretly under the
waves of the Sea for many miles, and afterward cast on shore on the banks of
the gulf of Tauromenitan. When thou have wholly satisfied me herein, then dare
I command thee also to do me that honor, to ascend the mount AEtna, which some
men suppose and conclude to be consumed and decayed by little and little,
because in times past men were wont to show it more farther off to Passengers.
This may happen, not for that the height of the mountain is diminished, but
because the fire is weakened, and blaseth out with less vehemency and
abundantly; and by the same reason that the smoke by day time is more little.
But neither the one or the other is incredible: neither that the mountain
which the fire deuoureth continually, is not diminished; neither that the fire
continues always in one and the same greatness. For it is not of it self,
but engendered in some gulf under earth: it is stirred, and is kindled and
nourished by a foreign means, having but one only passage and issue by this
mountain, and not his nourishment thereby. There is in Licia a Territory of
land, very well known unto all men, the inhabitants thereabouts call it
Ephestion, or the land which is pierced in diverse places. This country is
environed with a fire, that no ways hurts whatsoever plant it is that
grows thereupon: the Region therefore is fruitful and full of grass, which
the flames do never burn, but make shine with a faint and forcelesse
brightness. But let us reserve these to question upon, then when thou have
written me how far distance the snowes are from the mouth of the mountain,
which the summer thaweth not, so secure are they from the fire. Thou must not
say that I am the cause to make thee undertake this labor: for thou would
satisfy this Poetical fancy of thine, though no man urged thee thereunto,
until thou describest AEtna in thy verse, and described this place, so
renowned by all the Poets: for although Virgil had fully described it, yet was
not Ovid deterred from handling the same subject, and that which these two had
plentifully written did not deter Cornelius Seuerus. Besides, this place has
proved to all, and they which wrote before, seem not in my judgment to have
prevented those things which might be spoken, but to have explained them. But
there is a great difference, whether thou address thy self to a matter
thoroughly wrought upon, or such a one as is well prepared. This grows daily,
and those things that are already found and invented, cannot hurt those that
should invent hereafter. Moreover, the condition of the last commer is the
best: he finds words already prepared, which addressed after another
manner, have a new appearance; neither lays he hold on them, although
appertayning to others, for they are public. The lawyers deny that any thing
which is public may be held by prescription: either I know thee not, or thy
teeth water at AEtna. Thou have a mind to write upon some great subject, like
to those of the ancients; for more thy modesty permits thee not to hope,
which is so great in thee, that I suppose thou would restrain the forces of
thy spirit, if there were any likelihood thou should conquer: so greatly
reuerencest thou antiquity. Amongst the rest wisdom has this goodness in
it, no man can be overcome by another, if it be not in mounting when they shall
come to the height, all is equal, there is no place for increase, she is
settled. Does the Sun add any thing to his greatness, does the Moon become
more great then she was wont? The Seas increase not, the world observes the
same habit and manner. Those things which have attained to their just
greatness, cannot augment themselves more: whosoever shall be wise, they shall
be even and equal. But each of them shall be endowed with his proper virtue,
the one shall be more mild and affable, the other more ready; the one more
prompt in declayming, the other more eloquent; that whereof we speak, which
makes a man blessed shall be equal to all. I know not whether thine AEtna may
sink and be ruinated in it self, whether the continual force of fire impair
and consume this high and conspicuous topped hill, which is seen so far at
Sea. Neither fire nor rain can bring virtue under. This majesty only cannot
be depressed, it cannot be extended further, nor withdrawn backward, her
greatness is settled as that of the celestial bodies. Let us endeavor to
present our selves unto her, already have we performed much, and yet not very
much if I should speak the truth: for it is not goodness to be better then
the baddest. Who would glorify himself, or boast that he had eyes that could
behold the day, when as the Sun shines on them through mistie clouds,
although he be contented in the mean space to have fled the darkness, yet as
yet he enjoys not the good of the light? Then shall our mind have
wherewithal to gratulate him self, when as discharged of this darkness in
which he is plunged, he shall see those clear things, not with a feeble sight,
but after he has seen the light of the clear day, and restored to his
heaven, he recover again the place which he enjoyed by the condition of his
birth. His first original summoneth him upward. And in that place shall he be,
yea, even before he be delivered out of this prison, where he has shaken of
his vices, and become pure and light he shall be raised into contemplation of
divine things. This must we do, my dear Lucilius, hither must we bend all our
forces, although few men know it, although no man see it. Glory is the shadow
of virtue, and will accompany us against our wills: but even as the shadow
sometime goes before, and sometimes follows; so glory is sometimes before
us, and offers her self to be seen, sometimes she is behind us, and
becomes more great, because she comes somewhat later, when as envy is
wholly retired. How long time seemed Democritus to be mad? Socrates had
scarcely any reputation? How long was it ere Rome knew what Cato was? How long
contemned she him, and never thoroughly knew him, till she had wholly lost him?
Rutillius innocence and virtue had lien hid, except he had received injury,
whilst he is wronged his worthiness appeared. Did he not thank his fortune,
and embrace his exile? I speak of those whom fortune made glorious, when she
grieved them; how many men's deserts and worth grew to light after them? How
many has fame neglected in life, and eternized in the grave? Thou see how
much Epicurus is not only admired amongst the learned, but also among the
ignorant; and this man was unknown to the Athenians themselves, where he lived
always obscured. Outliuing therefore Metrodorus by many years, when in a
certain Epistle of his with grateful commemoration he had notified the
friendship betwixt Metrodorus and him, in the conclusion he added this; That
amidst so many goods which METRODORVS and he had partaken in their life, it
little harmed them, that so renowned Greece was not only ignorant of them, but
scarcely had heard of them. Was he not therefore found when as he ceased to be?
Did not his opinion grow famous? The like also does Metrodorus confess in a
certain Epistle, That he and EPICVRVS were not in sufficient reputation, but
that afterward both he and EPICVRVS should have a great and addressed fame at
their hands who would follow the way that they had held. No virtue is
obscured, neither is it any indignity or damage to it, to have been hidden:
the day will come which will bring it to light, though hidden and restrained
through the worlds wickedness. He is borne for the profit of few men, that
thinks only on the people of his age. Many thousands of years and nations
shall succeed us; look thou on them, although envy has enjoined silence to
all those that live with thee, ^here shall others succeed, who shall judge
without hatred or favor: and if virtue ought to receive any recompense by
glory, she shall not lose it. We shall not understand what words posterity
speaks of us; yet shall they honor us, and frequent us, though we perceive
it not. There is not any whom virtue has not dignified both in life and after
death: if so be he has followed his wholly, and with a good faith, if he have
not decked and disguised himself, if he continued on, whether it seemed upon
warning, or unprepared and suddenly. Dissembling profits nothing; a fained
countenance, and slightly forged externally, deceives but very few; virtue
which way soever you turn her is all one. Things deceivable are of no
stabilitie. A lie is thin, thou shall easily see through it, if thou diligently
look upon it.

EPIST. LXXX.
That the common sort went to the ^howes and games, he to his study and
contemplation. That the mind is to be beautified and not the body, and how
easy a thing it is if you desire good things. That we are to search out
liberty, which is performed by despising and spurning at desires. That true
felicity is therein, and not in external splendour. Good.

THis day I am wholly mine own, not only by mine own means, but for that the
foote-ball play has withdrawn all those that were troublesome unto me, and
came to importunate me. There is not one that thrusts in upon me, no man
distracteth my thoughts, my door creaked not so often as it was accustomed, my
hanging was not lifted up, I have freedom to be solitary, which is most
necessary for him that walks alone, and follows his own way. Do I not
therefore follow the ancient? I do. Yet suffer I my self to invent somewhat,
and to leave. I seruilely tie me not to their opinions, but assent unto them;
yet have I spoken a great word, who promised my self silence and secrecy if I
were not interrupted. Behold a huge cry is raised in the Theater, where men
exercise their running, which cannot draw my self from my self, but rather
transporteth me to contemplate on the combats that are in hand. I think with
my self, how many exercise their bodies, how few their minds; how many men
throng to a vain and trifling spectacle, and what desolation there is about
good arts, how weakly minded they are, whose arms and shoulders we wonder at?
But above all I meditate upon this. If a man may by exercise bring his body to
this patience, whereby he may sustain not only the strokes and spurns of
many men, whereby soiled with his own blood, he may endure the scorching
Sun, and hottest sand all the day long: how much more easily may the mind be
strengthened, inuincibly to entertain the shocke of fortune, to the end that
being cast to ground, and trod under foot, he may yet raise himself? For the
body has need of many things to strengthen the same, but the mind
increases by it self, is nourished by it self, exercises it self. The
bodi^ has need of much meat, of much drink, and much oil, and much
exercise; but virtue will come unto thee without any furnishing, without any
expense. Whatsoever may make thee good is with thee; what need thou to make
thee good? thy will. But what better may thou will, then to deliver thy
self out of this servitude, which tyrannizeth over the world, and from which
the slaves themselves, of how servile condition whatsoever, and borne even in
the ordures thereof, strive by all means to cast off? That stock of cattle
they have bought by pinching their own bellies, they pay for their liberty;
wilt not thou endeavor at what charge soever, to obtain this liberty, who
think thy self a free borne man? Why castest thou thine eye upon thy
coffers? I cannot be bought. It is a vain thing therefore to cast the name of
liberty into the Tables of Manumission, which neither they that bought, nor
those that sell the same may have. It is thou that must give thy self this
good, thou must demand it of thy self: first of all discharge thy self of the
fear of death; for that is it which first of all brings us in subjection,
and afterward from the f^are of poverty. If thou will know how little evil
there is therein, make a comparison betwixt the looks of such as are poor, and
those that are rich: the poor man laugheth more often, and more heartily: no
pensiuenes deeply groundeth it self in his breast, although some trifling
affliction befall him, it passes away like a light cloud. The joy of those
who are called rich is fained, or their sorrow is grievous and rotten; and so
much the more grievous, because they dare not discover their miseries, but
amidst the sorrows that gnaw their very hearts, they are enforced to set a
face of felicity upon their discontent. I must oftentimes make use of this
example, for by no other may this minick of man's life (which assigns us these
parts which we act very aukwardly) be expressed. He that in the Scene stalketh
proudely up and down, and looking upward, utters these words; Behold I
govern Greece, PELOPS my sire
Has left me Kingdoms, and the lands which lie
From Helispont unto the Seas that tire
Th'Ionian shores --
Is but a slave, he gains five bushels of corn and five pence. That proud
fellow, who full of ostentation and puffed up with confidence of his own
strength says, Except proud MENELAVS thou be still,
And shun debate, this right hand shall thee kill.
Has but his days allowances, and sleeps in a poor ordinary chamber. Thou
may say as much of all these wanton minions, who are hanged in the air, in
a Litter, carried more high then the heads of men, and above the troop of
common people. The felicity of all these is but masked. Thou will contemn
them if thou despoile them. When thou would buy a horse, thou causest his
saddle to be taken off of his back. Thou causest the slave thou would buy,
to be turned naked, for fear least any infirmities of his body should be
hidden. Will thou estimate a man when he is wrapped up? These Regrators shadow
and cover by some slight that which might hinder the Merchandise of their
slaves. And therefore it is that a fair garment and ornament makes them
oftentimes suspicious that intend to buy. If thou should see an arm or a
knee bound up, thou would command to have it vnswathed and laid open, and
all the body to be discovered. See thou that King of Scithia or Sarmatia
adorned with a rich attire upon his head: if thou will estimate him, and know
him wholly what he is, take from him his royal ornament; much mischief lies
hidden thereunder. Why speak I of others? If thou will estimate thy self, lay
apart thy money, thy house, and thy dignity, and consider well with thy self
what thou art inwardly. For now thou trustest other men to show thee what thou
art.

EPIST. LXXXI.
The beginning concerns an ungrateful man: and then follows a question,
whether we ought to be thankful unto him who formerly helped us, and
afterward hurt us. He disputes this matter, both subtly, and diffusedly,
and distinguishes diversely.

THou complainest that thou art fallen into an ungrateful man's hands: if this
be the first time, either thank thy fortune, or thy diligence. Although
diligence in this place can make thee nothing, except it make thee wicked. For
if thou would avoid this peril, thou shall never do any man a courtesy:
thus left thy benefits should perish in another man's hands, they shall perish
in thine own. It were better they were never recompensed, then never given:
yea even after a bad harvest we return to tillage. Oftentimes whatsoever has
been lost by the usual sterilitie of a barren ground, has been redeemed by
the plenty of one good year. It is so great a matter to find one grateful
man, to make trial of many ungrateful: no man has so certain a hand in
giving benefits, but that he is oftentimes deceived, let them fail som^times
once to be assured. The seas are sailed on when the shipwreck is past. The
Usurer forbeareth not to lend because he has met with a banckrupt. Our mind
will quickly be benumbed with fruitless idleness, if it should incontinently
forsake whatsoever is distastefull unto it. But let this very thing make th^e
more bountiful. For if thou will that a thing (whose event is uncertain)
should have a happy issue, it behooves thee to assay it oftentimes. But hereof
have we sufficiently spoken in our Books which we have written of Benefits.
Better it were to dispute of another point, (which, in my judgment, is not
sufficiently expressed and decided) whether he that befriendeth us, and
afterward hurt^th us, has equally his benefit, and whether we are acquit from
him. Add if thou will hereunto this also, that afterward he had hurt us more,
then before time he profited us. If thou expect a severe sentence of a Judge,
that would follow the rigor of law, he will release them respectively, and will
say. Although the injury be more great, yet let that which remains of the
injury be given to the benefits. He has hurt more. But first of all he has
profited, and therefore we must have some regard of time. Now those things are
more manifest, then that they need an admonition, that it is necessary to know
how willingly he has profited, how unwillingly harmed. Because both benefits
and injuries are measured by the mind. I would not give a benefit, but I was
overcome with shame, or by the pertinacie of his instant suite, or by hope.
Whatsoever is owing, is examined by the same mind wherewith it is given,
neither is it weighed by the greatness thereof, but by the will from whence it
proceeds. Let all conjecture be now taken away. Both that was a benefit, and
this that exceeded the measure of the former benefit, is an injury. A good man
will in such sort make his account, that he himself will deceive himself. He
will add unto the benefit, and take from the injury. But another that would
judge more graciously, as I would do, will forget the offense, and remember
the favor. Assuredly it is the act of justice (says he) to give each man that
which appertains thereunto, to the benefit acknowledgement, to the injury
revenge, or at leastwise an evil acceptance. This shall be true, when as one
does an injury, another gives a benefit. For if it be the same, the force of
the injury is extinguished by the benefit. For to him whom we ought to pardon,
although no deserts of his were precedent, to him is more then pardon due, if
he hurt us after he has done us kindness; yet take I not them both alike,
more prise I the benefit then the injury. Every one knows not how to owe a
benefit gratefully. An imprudent, rude, and base conditioned fellow may restore
a benefit, and recompense the same anon after he has received it, but he
knows not how much he is obliged. The wiseman only knows at what rate
each thing is to be taxed. For that fool, of whom I spoke of late, although he
have a good will, either restores less then he owes, or does it not in time
and convenient place, and lauisheth and casts that away, which he should
recompense and satisfy. There is a wonderful propriety of words in some
things, and the custom of ancient language designeth some things unto us in
effectual meats, and duty teaching lessons. Thus truly are we wont to say.
This man has referred or requited that man's favor: to requite, is willingly
to return that which thou owe. We say not, he has returned thanks; for
both they who are demanded, and are unwilling, and that in every place, and
those that return by another man's hand give satisfaction. We say not, he has
remitted the benefit, or he has paid it, for those words which are proper to
acquit a man of money lent, are no ways pleasing to me in this subject.
Refer, is as much to say, as to go and acknowledge, that is, bear back,
unto him whom thou have received. This word signifies voluntary relation or
reknowledgement. He that has referred, that is to say, reknowledged, has
appealed and sommoned himself. The wiseman will examine all things with
himself, how much he has received, from whom, when, where, and how. Therefore
is it, that we deny that any man knows how to reknowledge a benefit, but a
wiseman, no more then any other man, knows how to give a benefit, except he
be a wiseman, and such a one, who is more glad to give, then another to
receive. This some man numbreth amongst those things which we seem to name
extrauagant and strange unto all men, the Greeks call them Paradoxes, and
says: Is there no man therefore that knows how to requite a good turn but a
wiseman? Therefore no other man but he knows how to pay his creditor that
which he owes him, nor when he buyeth any thing, to pay the price thereof to
him that sells the same? But lest this blame should fall upon me, know this,
that Epicurus says as much. Metrodorus assuredly says, That the wiseman
only knows how to reknowledge a favor. Again, the same man admireth, when
we say, The wiseman only knows how to love, the wiseman only is a friend:
but to requite a favor, is both the part of love and friendship; nay rather
this is more vulgar and more casual amongst many, then true friendship.
Again, the same man wondereth, because we say, that there is no faith, but in
a wiseman, as if he himself had not said the same. Supposest thou this, that
he has any faith, that knows not how to acknowledge a benefit? Let them
therefore cease to defame us, as if we preferred or maintained incredible
things, and let them know that true honesty is lodged only in a wise-mans
breast, and the only images and appearance of honest things with the common
sort. No man knows how to requite a courtesy, but a wiseman. A fool in
some sort also acknowledges as he conceiueth the means, and how he may, and
let his knowledge rather fail him then his will. The will is not learned. A
wiseman will compare all things to their worth: his work although it be the
same, is made either greater or lesser, by time, place, and cause. Oft-times
riches powered into a house, could not do that that a thousand pence could,
being given in season. For there is a great difference whether thou gave, or
succourest. Whether thy liberality has saved him, or engreatned him.
Oft-times that which is given is small, that which follows thereby is great:
but what difference is there, whether any man has taken back again that
which he had given, or received a benefit, to the end he might give? But least
we should return into the examination of those things which he has
sufficiently debated of; in this comparison of benefit and injury, a good man
will judge that which is most rightful, yet will he favor the benefit, and
be most addicted to that side. But the consideration of the person is of
greatest moment in these affairs. Thou have given me a benefit in the person
of my slave, but thou have done me injury in my father. Thou have saved me my
son, but taken my father from me; consequently he will pursue and examine all
the circumstances by which all comparison has his proceeding: and if it be but
a small matter that causes the difference, he will dissemble that. But if it be
great, and that he has the power to pardon it, without iniurying piety or
faith, he will remit it, that is, if the whole injury appertain unto
himself. The sum of the matter is this, he shall be facile and gracious in
this compensation, he shall suffer himself to be more charged in the account,
and will never pay a benefit with an injury, except it be by great constraint,
he will incline always to this side, he will maintain this part in desiring
to acknowledge a benefit, and affecting to requite it. For he is deceived
whatsoever he be, that more willingly receives a benefit then he restores
it. By how much the more joyful he is that pays then he that borrows, by
so much ought he to be more content that discharges himself of a great debt
by restoring the benefit which be has received, then the other which obliges
himself by receiving. For in this also ungrateful men are deceived, in that
they satisfy their creditor with an ouer-plus besides the principal, and
suppose that the use of benefits is gratuitall: yet these increase by delay,
and so much more is to be satisfied, by how much it is slackly satisfied.
Ungrateful is he that restores a benefit without usury; and therefore we
ought to have a respect to this length, when we compare the receipts and layings
out. We must labor as much as in us lies, to be most grateful; for this good
is truly ours, even as it is not justice as it is commonly believed that
appertains to others, the greatest part thereof returns into it self.
There is no man that has profited another, that has not profited himself. I
speak it not with the intent wherewith he that has been succored would
succor, and he that has been defended would defend, because a good example
returns to him that gives it, as also evil examples do finally fall upon
their author; neither find they any pity who suffer injuries, and by acting
the same have taught others that they may be done, but because the reward of
all virtue lies in them: for they are not put in execution, under hope of
reward. The reward of a good action is to have acted the same. I am grateful,
not that another should more willingly lend me, being egged thereunto by the
former example, but that I might perform a thing both most pleasing and
agreeable. I am grateful, not because that shall yield me profit, but because
it contenteth my mind. And to the end thou may know that which I speak is
so truly: if I have not the means to express my gratuitie, except in showing
my self to be ungrateful, if I cannot yield satisfaction, except it be under
a pretext of doing injury, I ought most willingly to follow this counsel,
although I be in danger to be noted of infamy. There is no man in my judgment
that ^stimates virtue more, no man more devoted thereunto then he that lost the
reputation of a good man, because he would not make shipwreck of his
conscience. Therefore, as I said, thou art grat^full more for thine own good
then another man's: for to him there happens but an ordinary and common thing
to recover that which he had given, but to thee a great contentment, and such
as proceeds from the estate of a happy soul, to have acknowledged a
benefit. For if wickedness makes men miserable, and virtue makes them
bl^ssed, and to be grateful is a virtue, thou have restored but an usual
thing, but attained an in^stimable matter, that is to say, the conscience to
have been grateful, which seizes not on a mind but such as is divine and
fortunate. But the contrary of this affection is urged with great infelicitie.
There is no man that is not miserable if he be ungrateful. I dally not with
him, he is presently miserable. Let us therefore fly ingratitude; if for no
other cause, yet for our owns. The least part of wickedness, and that which is
least to be feared, redoundeth unto others; but that which is the worst, and
(if I may so speak it) that which is the thickest remains with him, and
tormenteth his possessor. As our Attalus was accustomed to say, Malice and
mischief drinks the greatest part of his own poison. That venom which the
Serp^nts cast out of them to destroy others, and keep within themselves
without their own prejudice, is not like unto this. For this poison is
pernicious to those that nourish the same. The ungrateful man tormenteth
himself, he becomes lean, he hates that which has been given him,
because he must restore the same, and extenuateth it: contrariwise, he dilat^th
the injuries and augmenteth them. But what man is there that is more miserable,
then he that forgets the benefits he has received, and remembers him of
the injuries? Contrariwise, wisdom speaks honorably of all sorts of
benefits, and commends them to her self, and delights her self with the
continual remembrance thereof. The evil sort have but one pleasure, and that
very short, and that is whilst they receive benefits, whereof the wiseman
feels a long and perdurable joy: for he delights not in receiving, but in
this, that he has received, whereof he feels a continual and immortal
pleasure. He contemns those thing whereby he is harmed, neither forgets he
negligently but willingly. He turns not all things to the worst, neither
seeks he to whom he may impart the fault, and rather lays the blame of men's
errors on fortune then on themselves. He takes exceptions neither to men's
words nor looks; whatsoever falls out he excuses it with a gracious
interpretation, and remembers not an injury rather then a benefit: He setleth
his remembrance on that which was both the first, and the best: he changes not
his mind toward those that have well deserved, except their injuries surpass
very much, and the difference be manifest, even though he should shut his eyes,
and then also in this only, that he continues the same man after the greatest
injury, as he was before the benefit. For whereas the benefit is equal with
the injury, there remains some spark of benevolence in the mind. Even as a
guilty man is acquit when the opinions of the Judges are equally divided, and
always in whatsoever thing is doubtful, humanity inclines to the better: so
a wise-mans mind, whereas the merits equal the misdeedes, will forbear to
owe, but will not desist to be willing to be beholding, and does this which
they are wont to do, who after a general acquittance of all debts, will
notwithstanding satisfy. But no man can be grateful, except he contemn these
things, that maddeth and besotteth the common sort. If thou will be thankful
for a benefit, thou must make account to suffer banishment, to shed thy
blood, to fall into poverty, and see thine own innocence oft-times stained,
and subject to base and scandlous rumors. It costeth a man no small matter to
approve himself grateful. We esteem nothing more deerer then a benefit as
long as we ask it, nothing more basely when we have received it. Ask thou
me what is that makes us forget the courtesies received? It is the desire and
covetousness of those things we would receive hereafter. We think not of that
which we have already obtained, but on that only which we would obtain
hereafter. Riches, honor, power, and all such other things which in our
opinion we repute of great esteem, but base and abject in their own value,
retire us from virtue. We know not how to estimate things, whereof we ought to
make our election; not according to the common report, but by the counsel of
nature, the mother of all things. These have no magnificence in them, whereby
they should draw our minds unto them, except this, that we are accustomed to
admire them. For therefore are they praised, not because they are to be
coueted, but therefore are they to be coueted, for because they are praised;
and when as every particular man's error has made them public, the public
shall make it to be the error of every one. But even as we have believed
those things, let us also believe the common sort in this, that there is
nothing more honest then a grateful mind. All Cities, all Nations, yea,
those of the barbarous and savage Regions will subscribe hereunto, the good and
evil will agree in this point. There will be some that will praise pleasures,
there will be some that had rather labor. There will be some that will say that
pain is the greatest evil that may be, some that will scarcely call it evil:
Some one shall repute riches for the chiefest good, another shall say that they
were found out for the ruin and mishap of humane life, and that there is no
one man more rich, then he to whom fortune has not found out any thing to give
him. In this so great diversity of opinions, all the world will maintain (as
it is said) with one voice that we ought to be thankful unto those who have
deserved well at our hands. All Nations, though different in many other
things, consent and agree herein, and yet notwithstanding, in the interim we
repay benefits with injuries: and the chiefest cause that every one has to
become ungrateful, is this, because he could not be sufficiently grateful.
The fury is grown to that head, that it is a very dangerous thing to give
great benefits to any one: for in that he thinks it a dishonest part not to
requite, he desires he should not live, to whom he should make restitution.
Reserve that to thy self which thou have received, I redemand, I exact it not,
it contenteth me that I have pleasured thee. There is no hatred more pernicious
then his, who is ashamed because he has violated a benefit.

EPIST. LXXXII.
Against delicacie and effeminate life, and sluggish idleness also, and that
we ought to dedicate the same to study, and in especial to Philosophy, which
should defense us against fear and all external evils, yea against death it
self. That we are armed all in vain, with subtilties and sophimes against the
same, and by the way, against such as use it, that death in it self is
indifferent, but such or such honest or dishonest. Again, against Cauillers.
Good.

NOw have I given over the care I have had of thee. What one say thou of the
gods, have thou accepted for my surety: truly even him that deceueth no man,
a mind that is a lover of right and honesty. The better part of thee is in
safety. Fortune may do thee an injury, but that which is most pertinent to
the matter, I fear not that thou should injury thy self. Keep on the
course thou have begun, and compose thy self in this habit of life
temperately, not effeminately. I had rather thou should live ill, then
effeminatly. Now so interpret thou ill as it is usually spoken amongst the
common sort, hardly, sharply, and laboriously. So are we wont to hear the
lives of diverse men praised, who are envied. He lives effeminately. This they
say, he is evil. For by little and little the mind is made effeminate, and
grows remiss and negligent, and undertakes the similitude of that idleness
and sloth wherein he is buried. What then? is it not more befitting a man to
be more stern and rigid. Again, such as are delicate fear death, whereunto
they have made their life alike. There is a great difference betwixt idleness
and the grave. What therefore say thou, were it not better for a man to
repose himself thus, then to toss and tumble himself in these gulfes of
affairs? Both these two things are mortal, the convulsion of the nerves and
debilitation of the mind. I think him as much dead that lies buried in his
perfumes, as him that is drawn with the hook. Retirement without study is a
death, and the sepulcher of a living man. Finally, what profits it us to be
retired, as if the causes of cares and troubles followed us not beyond the
seas? What hidden place is there, whereinto the fear of death enters not?
What so defenced and high raised repose of life, which sorrow terrifieth not?
Wheresoever thou shall hide thy self, humane miseries will make a noise about
thee. There are diverse external things, which wheel about us, whereby they
either may deceive or urge us. Many things internal which incense and inflame
us also, even in the midst of solitude. We must arm our selves with
Philosophy, which will serve us as an impregnable wall, which Fortune with all
her engines cannot pierce. The mind that has disclaimed external things, is
resident in an impregnable place, and defends himself in his fortress, each
weapon aimed at him, falls under him. Fortune has not long hands, as we
imagine, she is Mistress over none, but such a one as cleaves unto her. Let
us therefore, as much as in us lies, retire our selves from her, which the
only knowledge of her self and of Nature will effect. Let him know whither he
is to go, whence he came, what is his good, what is his evil, what he should
desire, and what he should eschew, what that reason is, which discerns, what
things are to be desired and esteemed, whereby the fury of desires is meekened,
and the cruelties of fears abated. Some there are that think that they have
overcome all this without the assistance of Philosophy, but when as any
misfortune lights upon any of these, that pretend security; too late are
they enforced to confess the truth. These great words are forgotten, when the
hangman commands them to give him their hand, when death approaches more
nigh them. Thou may justly say unto him: Thou prouok^^t absent evils: now
see here grief, which thou said was easy to support: see here death,
against which thou spakest so much, and so audaciously: the whips yerke, the
sword shines; Now have thou need, AENEAS, of a mind
Armed with constancy. --
But that will continual meditation make strong in thee, if thou exercise not
thy words, but thy mind: if thou preparest thy self against death, against
which he cannot exhort thee, nor encourage thee, who shall attempt by some
cauils to persuade thee that death is not e^ill. For I will, my Lucilius, (the
best of men) laugh at the follies of the Greeks, which as yet I have not well
examined, though I wonder at them. Our Zeno uses this collection. There is no
evil which is glorious, but death is glorious, Ergo, death is no evil. Thou
have profited me much, thou have put me out of fear, hereafter I will not
doubt to stretch out and offer my head. Will thou not speak more severely, nor
make a man laugh that is ready to die? Vndoubt^dly, I can hardly tell thee
whether he were more foolish, who supposed by this question to extinguish the
fear of death, or he that endeavored to answer the same, as if it were a
thing pertinent to the matter. For he himself opposed a contrary argument,
taken from that, because we place death amongst things Indifferent, which the
Grecians call Adiaphora. Nothing, says he, that is indifferent, is glorious;
but death is glorious death therefore is not indifferent. Thou see plainly
whereto this argument tends. Death is not glorious; but to die constantly is
glorious. And when, he says, nothing Indifferent is glorious, I grant it thee;
yet say I this, that there is nothing glorious, but in things Indifferent.
These things term I indifferent, which are neither good nor evil, as
sickness, pain, poverty, exile, death; none of these in it self is
glorious, yet nothing without these. For poverty is not praised. But he that
is neither humbled, nor dejected by her. Banishment is not praised, but he that
sorrowed not for it: grief is not praised, but he whom grief has enforced
nothing. No man praises death, but him whom death sooner separated from life,
then astonished. All these things are not honest nor glorious in themselves,
but if Virtue intermixeth her self amongst them, if she manage them, she
makes them honorable and full of glory. For of themselves they are placed
between both, and are indifferent, it only concerns us to know whether
malice or virtue has past the same through their hands. For that death which is
glorious in Cato, is presently base and shameful in Brutus, and to be blushed
at. For this is that Brutus, who when he should be slain, sought to delay
death, who went aside to do his easement, and being called upon to die, and
commanded to lay down his neck; I will lay it down, says he, so that I may
live. What madness is it to fly away, since that thou art unable to go back?
I will lay it down, so that I may live: almost he added there^nto, even under
Antonius. O worthy man, to be yielded unto life! But as I began to say^ Thou
see that death it self is neither a bad, nor a good thing, Cato most
honestly used it; Brutus most dishonestly. Every thing that has not honor,
virtue being added thereunto, it assumeth it. We say that a chamber is full of
light: yet this same is most dark by night. The day infuseth light into it,
the night takes it away. So to these things which be by us called indifferent
and middle things, namely, to riches, strength, beauty, honors, rule; and
contrarily to death, banishment, bad health, sorrows, and what other things
we have feared, either less or more; either n^ughtinesse or virtue gives the
name of good or bad. Paste of it self is neither hot nor cold, but being put
into the Oven, it waxes hot; again, it being put into the water waxes
cold. Death is honest, through that which is an honest thing: that is virtue
and a mind contemning outward things. There is also, O Lucilius, a great
difference of these that we call honest things. For death is not so
indifferent, as that whether thou do wear thine hair even or not. Death is
amongst those things that be not bad indeed, but yet have a show of that which
is bad. There is a love of ownes self, and an engrafted will of abiding and of
preserving ownes self, and a shunning of dissolution, because it seems to
take away many good things, and to lead us out of the abundance of this,
whereunto we have accustomed our selves. That thing also alienateth us from
death, because we have already known these things: those things whereunto we
are about to go; we know not of what sort they may be, and we fear things
that be unknown. Furthermore, there is a natural fear of darkenes^e, into
which it is supposed that death will conduct us. Therefore, although death be
an indifferent thing, yet for all that it is not amongst those things, which
easily may be neglected. With great exercise the mind is to be hardened, that
it may endure the sight and the coming thereof. Death ought to be contemned,
more then it is accustomed to be; for we believe many things concerning it. It
has been the strife of many wits to increase the infamy of it. An infernal
prison is described, and a region oppressed with continual night, wherein is
the great porter of hell. Lying upon bare bones hal^e eaten up
In bloody den, where he does dine and sup,
^ternally with barking does affright
Each pale and bloudlesse ghost and shade-like spright.
But also when thou shall persuade thy self that these things be fables,
neither that any other thing remains to the dead, which any one ought to
fear, another fear comes in the place of it. For they are alike afraid of
being in hell, as of being no where. These things contradicting which long
persuasion has infused unto us, the valiant enduring of death, what else may
it be but a glorious thing, and amongst the greatest works of a manly mind?
which will never rise up unto virtue, if it believe death to be an evil thing;
it will rise up unto it, if it suppose it to be a thing indifferent. The nature
of things is incapable of this, that one may come unto that which he supposes
to be an indifferent thing, slowly and lingringly will he come. And that is not
glorious, which is done by an unwilling and backward man. Virtue does nothing
because it is needful to be done. Add now that nothing is honestly done,
except the whole mind has endeavored and has been present thereat, and with
no part of it self has resisted it. But when approach is made unto that which
is bad^ it either comes to pass by fear of worser things; or by hope of
those things that be good, to come unto the which it is of so great worth, that
the enduring of one evil is swallowed up. The judgments of the doer do
disagree. Hence it is, that he commands to accomplish things purposed: thence
that he draws back and flies from a suspected and perilous thing. Therefore
is he distracted into diverse parts. If this be, glory perishes. For virtue
accomplisheth decrees with an agreeing mind: it fears not that which it
does. See this, that thou to evils give no place,
But against them go with a bolder face
Though thy fortune will permit thee.
Thou shall not the more boldly go, if thou shall suppose that they be evil
things. This is to be taken out of the breast: otherwise suspicion being about
to stay the force, will stick hereat. It shall be thrust upon that, which it
was to set upon. Some would have the interrogation of our Zeno to be supposed
to be true, but that other to be deceitful and false, which is opposed unto
it. I reduce not these things to a Logical law, and to those knots of most
sluggish workmanship: I judge that all that kind is to be thrust away, whereby
he who is asked, supposes himself to be circumuented, and whereby he being
brought to confess, answers one thing, but thinks another. We must deal
more plainly for the truth, and more strongly against fear. These things
which are tossed up and down by them, I had rather to loosen, and to ponder
upon, to the end that I may persuade, and not deceive. He that will lead an
army into the field ready to die for their wives and children, how will he
exhort? I show to thee the Fabij, translating the whole war of the
Commonwealth into one house. I demonstrate the Lacedaemonians placed in the
very straites of Thermopylae, hoping neither for victory, nor for return.
That place was to be a grave unto them. How exhortest thou them to receive the
ruin of a whole nation with offering their bodies unto it? and rather to
depart from their life, then from their place? Thou will say, that which is
evil, is not glorious: death is glorious, therefore death is not an evil
thing. O effectual speech! who after this doubts to offer himself to the
deadly weapons points, and standing for to die? But that Leonidas how valiantly
did he speak unto them? So dine O fellow soldiers says he, as if ye should
sup amongst the dead. The meat increased not in their mouths, it did not
stick in their chaps, it did not fall out of their hands. They went
cherefully to dinner and to supper both. What that Roman Captain, who spoke
thus unto soldiers, which were sent to take a place, and were to go through a
great army of the enemies: It is needful, O fellow soldiers, to go thither,
but it is not needful to return back. Thou see how plain, and how
imperious virtue is. What man can our beguilings make more valiant? Whom can
they make more courageous? They break the mind, which is never less to be
contracted, and to be compelled with petty and thornie things, then when some
great matter is framed. The fear of death ought not to be taken from three
hundred alone, but from all mortal men. How will thou teach them, that it is
not an evil thing? How will thou overcome the opinions of all ages, wherewith
presently infancy is seasoned? What help will thou find? What will thou say
to the weakness of man? What will thou say wherewith they being inflamed may
rush into the midst of danger? With what speech will thou turn away this
consent of fearing; with what speech will thou auert the obnoxious persuasion
of mankind, which is against thee? Thou compo^est captious words, and knittest
petty questions for me. Great monsters are stricken with great weapons. In
vain with arrows and slings did they shoot at that great cruel Serpent in
Africa, and more terrible to the Legions of Rome then war it self. Not
Python indeed was to be wounded, since huge greatness according to the solid
vastness of his body, cast back again weapons, and whatsoever the hands of
men had darted against him; at length was he broken with milstones; and against
death do thou dart so petty things? With a bodkin encountrest thou a Lion?
These things are sharp which thou speak of. Nothing is more sharp then the
beard of the ear of Corn. Smalenesse it self makes somethings unprofitable
and without effect.

EPIST. LXXXIII.
We mu^t live as before God our beholder and Judge. Then he adioyneth
concerning his own life, temperance and watchfulness. Again (as in the
former Epistle) against base talkers, who abase wisdom with their mean speech
and cauils. He teaches against ZENO himself, discoursing against
drunkenness. But we must do more valiantly and famously: and giving an
example thereof, he condemns that vice.

THou command my several days, and all of them indeed to be showed unto
thee. Well iudgest thou of me, if thou supposest nothing to be in them which I
will hide. If certainly we must live, let us live as being in sight: so let us
think, as if one were able, and could look into our innermost breast. For what
pro^itteth it, that any thing should be secret from man? Nothing is closed from
God. He is within our souls, and he comes into the midst of our thoughts.
So, I say, he comes amongst them, as one to depart at length. Therefore I
will do that which thou command, and what I do, and in what order, I will
willingly write unto thee. I will forthwith observe my self: and that which is
a most profitable thing, with my self will I recall the day to mind. This
makes us to be very bad, because no man looks back upon his life. What
things we are about to do, we think upon, and but seldom that: what we have
done, we do not think upon. But from that which is past, comes counsel for
that which is to come. This day is solid. No man has taken any of it from me:
it is all of it divided betwixt the book and the bed. The least part is given
unto exercise of the body; and for this cause I give thanks to old age. It
costeth me not much. When I have stirred, I am wearied. But this is the end of
exercise, even to those that are most strong. Seek thou with whom I exercise
my self? One suffices me, Earinus (as thou know) a lovely boy: but he
shall be changed. Now I seek for one that is more tender. He indeed says,
that we have the same estate of bodie^ because that the teeth of us both ^all
out: but now I scarce overtake him when he does run, and within a very few
days I shall be unable to do it. See what continual exercise can pro^it.
Speedily there is made a great distance betwixt two that go in a contrary
journey: at the same time he ascends, I descend: and thou know, how much
the one of these is the more speedily done. I lied: for now our age descends
not, but falls. Notwithstanding do thou seek how this days strife
succeeded unto us? As seldom it falls forth to runners: neither of us both
did overcome. From this weariness, rather then exercise, I descended into cold
water. This is called by me water scarce warm. I that so great wa^her in cold
water, who in the Calends of January leaped into a pond, who in the new year,
as I began to read, to write, to speak somewhat, so began I to leap down
into clear water, first translating my tent to Tyber, then to this bathing
tub, which because I am most strong, and all things are done in good earnest,
the Sun moderateth for me. Not much time after do I tarry at the Bath.
Then I eat dry bread, and a dinner without a board: after which I am not to
wash mine hands. I sleep very little. Thou have known my custom: and I use a
most short sleep, and as it were by several naps. It is sufficient that I
have ceased to watch. Sometimes I know, sometimes I suspect that I have slept.
Behold the cry of the Circens^ans makes a noise in mine ears: mine ears are
stricken with some sudden and universal voice. Neither do they put forth,
neither indeed do they interrupt my thought: most patiently I bear their
clamorous noyses, many voices and confused in one, are to me in stead of a
wave, or of a wind beating upon a wood, and of other things sounding without
sense. O what therefore is it? I will tell thee, whereon now I have set my
mind. A thought abides with me still since yesterday, namely, what most wise
men have meant, who have made most light and perplexed proofs for greatest
things, which although they be true, are notwithstanding like to a lie. Zeno
would deter us from drunkenness, an exceeding great man, the founder of this
most valiant and most holy sect. Hear now how he gathers, that a good man
will not be drunk. None commits secret speech to a drunken man: but he
commits it to a good man; therefore a good man will not be drunk. Mark how
he may be derided with the like opposite interrogatio^. It suffices of many to
set down one. No man commits secret speech to one that is a sleep, but he
commits it to a good man; therefore a good man does not sleep. By what one
way he can, Posidonius pleads the cause of our Zeno: but so can it not be
pleaded indeed, as I suppose. For he says that a drunken man is so said to be
two manner of ways: the one, when one is laden with wine, and not master of
himself; the other, if he be accustomed to be made drunk, and be subject unto
this vice. He is spoken of by Zeno, who is accustomed to be made drunk, not
he that may be drunk. But no man will commit secrets to him, which through
wine he may publish abroad; which is false. For that first interrogation
comprehends him that is drunk, not him who will so be. For thou will grant
that there is great difference betwixt him that is drunk, and a drunkard. He
that is drunk, may so then be at the first time, and not have this vice: and
he that is given to drink, is oftentimes without drunkenness. Therefore I
understand that, which is wont to be signified in this word: especially since it
is put by a man professing diligence, and examining words. Add now, that if
Zeno understood, and would have us to understand this, by doubtfulnesse of the
word, he has sought place for deceit: which thing is not to be done, when
verity is sought for. But certes although he has thought thus: yet that which
follows is false; namely, that to him who is accustomed to be made drunk, a
secret speech is not to be committed. For think to how many soldiers not
always sober, both the Emperor, and Tribune, and Centurion has committed
silent things. Concerning that slaughter of C. Caesar, of him do I speak, who
having overcome Pompeius, possessed the Commonwealth: it was as well committed
to Tillius Cimber, as to C. Cassius. Cassius drank water all his life long.
Tillius Cimber was both too much given to wine, and was lavish of his tongue:
he ie^ted at this thing himself. Can I bear any one, says he, who cannot
bear wine? Let every one now name those unto himself, to whom he knows that
wine is badly, and that speech is well committed. Notwithstanding I will relate
one example that comes to my mind; le^t it be forgot. For life is to be
instructed by famous examples. Let us not always fly to those that be old.
Lucius Piso the warden of the City, after that he was once made drunk, spent
the greater part of the night in the feast: and did for the most part sleep
almost until noone; this was his morning time. Notwithstanding, most
diligently he administered his office, wherein the safety of the City was
contained. To him both Augustus gave secret commands, when he gave him the
government of Thracia, which he did subdue; and Tiberius going into Campania,
when he left many things in the City both suspected and hateful, I think,
because the drunkenness of Piso had well fallen forth unto him, afterward
made Cossus governor of the City, a grave and moderate man, but drowned and
floating in wine, so that sometimes being oppressed with a sound sleep, he was
carried out of the Senate, into which he had come from a feast. To him
notwithstanding Tiberius wrote many things with his own hand, which he judged
ought not to be committed to his own servants. No private nor public secret
escaped from Cossus. Therefore let us remove from amongst us these
declamations: The mind has not power over it self, being bound about with
drunkenness. As barrels themselves are broken with new wine: and as all that
is in the bottom, the force of heat casts up into the upper part: so wine
foming forth, whatsoever lies hid in the bottom is brought ^orth and comes
abroad. As they who are loaded with wine, keep not me^t through abundance of
wine, so indeed do they keep no secret thing; that which is their own and
other men's, alike do they spread abroad. But although this is wont to fall
forth, so also is that, that with these whom we know somewhat freely to drink,
we deliberate of necessary things. Therefore this is false, which is put in
the place of patronage, that a secret is not to be committed to him, who is
accustomed to be made drunk. How much better were it openly to accuse
drunkenness, and to lay open the vices thereof? which even a tolerable man
has avoided, much more a perfect and a wise man: to whom it is sufficient to
quench thirst: who also if at any time mirth does arise, and is continued
somewhat long upon some other cause, yet notwithstanding resists without
being drunk. For we will see concerning that, whether the mind of a wise man
may be troubled with too much wine, and may do that which is accustomable to
drunken men. In the mean space, if thou will conclude this, that a good man
ought not to be drunk, why dealest thou with syllogismes? Say how dishonest a
thing it is, to power in more then one can contain, and not to know the
measure of ones stomach: how many things drunken men do, which sober men be
ashamed of: that drunkenness is nothing else, then a voluntary madness.
Prolong that drunken habit into more days, doubtest thou but it will be
madness? Now also it is not lesser, but shorter. Relate the example of
Alexander, the Macedonian, who in the midst of a banquet stabbed Clytus, one
most dear and most faithful unto him, and understanding that heinous deed, he
would have died; certainly he deserved to die. Drunkenness augmenteth and
discovers every vice; it remoueth modesty, which hinders from bad
enterprises. For more abstain from forbidden things, through shame to offend,
then through good will. When too much wine possesses the mind, what evil
soever did lie hid, comes forth. Drunkenness causes not vices, but
betrayeth them; then the leacherous person tarrieth not indeed for a chamber,
but without delay permits to his desires, so much as they shall require:
then the shameless man professes and publishes his disease: then the wanton
contains not his tongue nor hand. Pride increases to the haughty, rage to
the cruel, malice to the envious; every vice is discovered, and comes forth.
Add, that not knowing of himself, doubtful and scarce plain words, wandering
eyes, staggering gate, turning about in the head, the house it self seeming to
turn about: the torment of the stomach, when the wine waxes warm, and
stretches out the bowels. Then notwithstanding, howsoever it is tolerable,
whilst it is yet in his own power. What when it is corrupted with sleep, and
that which was drunkenness is made cruditie? Think what slaughters public
drunkenness has committed. This has delivered most fierce and warlike
Nations to their enemies: this has laid open walls defended against the
resolute war of many years: this has enforced the most resolved, and the
refusers of subjection, to the command of other men: this has conquered those
who have been unconquered in war. So many iournies, so many battles, so
many Winters, through which Alexander had passed, the difficulty of times and
places being overcome, so many floods unexpectedly falling forth, so many
Seas dismissed him safe; but the distemper of drinking, and that Herculean and
fatal cup buried him. What glory is it to contain much? When the victory
shall be achieved by thee, when men lying scattered asleep, and casting shall
refuse thy drunken carrowses, when thou alone shall remain of the whole
banquet, when thou shall overcome all men in magnificall valor, and no man
shall be so capable of wine as thy self, yet art thou overcome by a Tun:
what other thing save drunkenness, and the love of Cleopatra no less then
wine destroyed M. Antonius, a great man and of a noble wit, and transferred him
into external fashions, and into vices which were not Roman-like? This thing
made him an enemy to the Commonwealth, this made him unequal to his enemies,
this made him cruel, when the heads of the Princes of the City were set
before him as he did suppe, when amongst most exquisite feasts and kingly riot,
he looked upon to know the heads and hands of the proscribed, when being loaded
with wine, he notwithstanding thirsted for blood. It was intolerable which he
did when he was drunk, although he did thus being sober: how much more
intolerable was it, that he did these things in drunkenness it self? For the
more part cruelty follows drunkenness; for the health of the mind is
violated and exasperated. Even as long diseases cause tender eyes, yea at the
least lighting upon of a beam of the Sun: so continual drunkenness
enrageth the mind. For when oftentimes they are not their own men, vices bred
with wine, and obdurated with custom of madness, be also of force without it.
Tell therefore why a wiseman ought not to be made drunk. Show the deformity
and the importunity of the thing with deeds, not with words, which will be
most easy to do. Prove these pleasures, as they are called, when they have
passed a mean to be punishments. For if thou shall argue upon that, that a
wiseman can be drunk with much wine, and retain a right tenor, although he be
ouerturned: thou may as well conclude, that he may drink poison and not die,
that he may take juice of black Poppie and not sleep, that he may take
Ellebore, and not cast upward or scour downward, whatsoever sticks in the
bowels. But if his feet be assaulted, if his tongue be not his own, why
think thou him to be partly sober, and partly drunk?

EPIST. LXXXIIII.
Writing and reading are to be changed. Things read are to be turned into one
nourishing substance, and are to be made ours. Lastly, there is an exhortation
to wisdom. Good and profitable admonitions.

I Judge these iourneyes which shake off slothfulness from me, to profit my
studies and health. Thou see why they help mine health: since the love of
learning makes me slow and negligent of my body, I am exercised by others
help. I will show thee why they profit my studies. I have not departed from
reading. But it is necessary, as I suppose, first, that I may not be content
with my self alone; then, that when I shall know things sought forth by other
men, and then that I may judge of things already found out, and that I may
think of those that be to be found out. Reading nourishes the wit; and it
being wearied with study, notwithstanding not without study refreshes it.
Neither only ought we to write, or only to read; the one of the things will
make sad, and will consume the strength; I speak of writing: the other will
dissolve and dissipate it. Interchangeablie this is to be exchanged with that,
and the one is to be moderated with the other; so that whatsoever is gathered
together by reading, the pen may reduce into a body. We ought, as they say, to
imitate Bees, which wander up and down, and pick fit flowers to make honey:
then whatsoever they have brought they dispose and place through their combs,
and as our Virgil says; Moist honey to make thick they much do strive,
Spreading the same with sweet dew through their Hiue.
Concerning them it is not apparent enough, whether they draw a moist substance
from the flowers, which is presently honey; or whether that they change those
things which they have gathered with a certain mixture and propriety of their
breath, into this taste. For it pleases some, that not the knowledge of making
honey, but of gathering it is unto them. They say that amongst the Indians
honey is found upon the leaves of Reeds, which either the dew of that sky or
the pleasant and more fat moisture of the very Reed may beget. Upon our
herbs also the same force, but less manifest and notable is found, which a
creature born for this end may follow after, and gather together. Some think
that those things which they have picked from the tender of that which is
green and flourishing, are not without a certain leaven, as I may so call it,
whereby diverse things do knit together into one. But that I be not lead a way
to any other thing, then to that which is in hand, we also ought to imitate
Bees, and to separate what things soever we have heaped together from diverse
reading; for distinct things are the better kept. Then using the ability and
care of our wit, to mingle diverse liquors into one taste: that although it
shall appear whence it is taken, yet that it may appear to be some other
things then that whence it was taken: which thing we see nature does in our
body, without any help of us. Nourishment which we have taken, so long as it
abides in quality, and swimmeth solid in the stomach is a burden; but when
it is changed from that which it was, then at length it passes into strength
and into blood. The same let us do in these things wherewith wits a^e
nourished: that whatsoever we have gotten, we suffer not to be whole, nor to
be other men's. Let us concoct them, otherwise they will go into the memory, not
into the wit. Let us faithfully agree unto them, and make them ours, that one
certain may be made of many things: as one number is made of several ones,
when one computation comprehends lesser and disagreeing sums. This let our
mind do: all things whereby it is helped, let it hide: only let it show that
which it has done. Although in thee the likeness of some one shall appear,
whom admiration has more deeply fastened in thee: I would that thou should
be like to him, not as an Image, but as a son. An Image is a thing that is
dead. What therefore? is it not understood whose speech thou do^st imitate?
whose reasoning? whose sentences? I think at length it can not be understood
indeed, if they be of a great man, for not in all things, which he has
drawn as examples from every one, has he so imprinted his shape, that they
may agree into that one thing alone. See thou not of the voices of how many,
a Quire does consist? Notwithstanding one sound is made of them all. Some one
voice is acute, some base, some in a mean. Women's voices are joined with men's,
recorders and flutes are added unto them: there the voices of every one in
several li^ ^id, of all appear. I speak of the Quire which the old lovers
of music did know of. In our feasts there are more Singers, then once were of
spectators upon the Theaters. When the row of those that sing has filled all
ways, and the Stage is compassed with Trumpeters, and all kind of Pipes and
Organs sound from a gallerie above, a consonance is made of discords. Such
would I have our mind to be, that there be many arts therein, many precepts,
examples of many ages, but conspiring in one. How say thou, may this be done?
By continual taking of heed; if we shall do nothing but by the persuasion of
reason: this if thou will hear, it will say unto thee; Leave these things even
already now, whereunto men do run; leave riches either the danger or burden
of those that possess them; leave the pleasures of the body and of the mind,
they mollify and make weak; leave suing for offices, it is a swelling, vain,
and windy thing, it has no bound: as well careful is it, not to see any body
before it self, as not not to see it self after another man: it labors
with envy, and indeed with two sorts thereof. But thou see how wretched he
is, who is envied at, if he himself envy also. Beholdest thou those houses of
mighty men, those tumultuous doors with the brawling of them that do salute?
Much reproach is there that thou may enter in, more when thou have entered
in. Pass by these stairs of the rich, and entries hanged with heaps of
ancient spoils. Not only in a craggie, but also in a ^lipperie place shall
thou here stand. Hither rather unto wisdom direct thy course, and seek to
attain the most quiet, and therewithal the most ample things. What things
soever seem to excel in humane affairs, although they be small, and stand
above in comparison of the basest things, are notwithstanding by difficult and
^ard ways gone unto. Unto the height of dignity there is a broken way. But if
thou will climb unto this top, whereunto fortune submits it self, thou
shall behold indeed all things under thee, which are accounted exceeding high;
but notwithstanding thou shall come unto highest things by that which is plain.

EPIST. LXXXV.
He disalloweth Sophismes, and drives them from serious studies. He gives
certain examples, but leads to profitable things; against the Aristotelians,
that a wise man ought to want affections. Then, that blessed life suffices of
it self; it is one and equal, whether it be long or short. Also it is not
lessened by outward things, although evils an^ losses fall forth, yet a wise
man uses all well. A good and wise Epistle.

I Had spared thee, and had now passed by whatsoever had remained as yet,
contented to give, as it were, a taste unto thee, of those things which are
spoken by our men, that it may be proved, that virtue alone is sufficiently
effectual to fulfill a blessed life. Thou command me to comprehend all the
questions, that be either of our own, or de^ised for the teaching of us: which
thing, if I will do, it shall not be a letter, but a book. That thing so
often do I protest, that in this kind of argument there is no delight unto me.
It shameth me (being armed with a bodkin) to descend into a war undertaken by
gods and men. He that is wise, is also a temperate man. He that is temperate is
a constant man. He that is constant, is a true tempered man. He that is without
grief, is a bles^ed man. Therefore he that is prudent is a blessed man, and
prudence is sufficient for a blessed life. To this collection, some of the
Aristotelians answer after this sort, that thus they may interpret a man of
true temper, and constant, and without grief; that a man of true temper may be
said to be, who rarely and smally is disturbed, not he who never is. Also
without sadness do they say him to be, who is not subject to sadness, nor is
too frequent, nor too much in this fault. For that were to deny the nature of
man, that the mind of some man should be free from grief: a wise man is not
overcome with sorrow, but is touched therewith: so other things, after this
sort, correspond to their own sect. They do not with these things take away
the affections, but moderate them. But how little do we gi^e to a wise man, if
he be stronger then the weakest, and merrier then the saddest, and more
moderate, then the most unbridled, and greater then the basest be? What if
Ladas admire his own swiftness, looking back unto those that be lame and
weak? On tops of grass, not pressing them, she ran,
Nor tops of standing corn, her course hurt can;
In midst of sea on waters highest tip,
Her running feet in water do not dip.
This is that swiftness esteemed of by it self, not which is praised in
comparison of those that be most slow. What if thou call him, who is slightly
sick of an a^ue, a sound man? The smalenesse of a disease is not good health.
Thus, says he, a wise man is said to be of true temper, as sweet kernel-lesse
Pomgranats, are called so, not in which there is no hardness of the kernels,
but in which less hardness is. It is false: for I do not understand a
lessening, but a wanting of evils in a good man: there ought to be none, not
those that are small. For if there be any, they will increase, and sometimes
will hinder us. As a greater and a perfect web in the eye makes blind, so a
small one troubles the eye. If thou give any affections to a wise man,
reason shall be unable to master them, and shall be carried away, as it were,
with a stream: especially when thou leauest not one, but a whole troop of
affections wherewithal it may strive. A troop, although it be of those that
be mean, can do more, then the violence of one that is great. He has
covetousness, but it is mean; he has ambition, but it is not eager; he has
anger, but it is to be appeased; he has inconstancy, but not very wandering;
and subject to motion: he has lust, but not madness. Better is it with him
who has one whole vice, then with him who has lighter vices indeed, but yet
has all vice. Then there is no difference, how maine the affection be, and how
great soever it is; it knows not to obey, it receives not counsel. As no
living creature obeys reason, not the wild, not the tame and gentle^ for the
nature of them is deaf to him that does persuade: so affections do not
follow, they do not hear, how small soever they be. Tigers and Lions never
put off fierceness, sometimes they submit it; and when thou shall least
expect, their mitigated frowardness is exasperated. Vices never in good
earnest do wax tame. But if reason profits, the affections will not begin:
if they shall begin against reasons will, they will persevere against the will
of it. For it is more easy to forbid the beginnings of them, then to rule
their force. Certainly this mediocritie is false, and without gain, and is to
be esteemed of in the same place, as if one should say, we might be
indifferently mad, or indiff^rently sick. Virtue alone has it; the evils of
the mind do not receive moderation, more easily shall thou take them away,
then govern them. Is there any doubt, but that the inueterate and hard vices
of humane mind, which we call diseases, be without moderation; as
covetousness, as cruelty, as vn^ulinesse, as impiety? Therefore also the
affections are without moderation^ for we pass from these unto those.
Furthermore, if thou give any power to sadness, to fear, to covetousness,
and to other bad motions, they will not be ruled by us. Why? because those
things be out of our power, whereby they be stirred up. Therefore they
increase, as they have greater or lesser causes, whereby they be provoked.
Greater shall the fear be, if there be more wherewithal it may be affrighted,
or if one shall look nearer thereunto; covetousness shall be more cruel, when
hope of a larger estate shall call it forth. If it be not in our power, whether
affections may be or not, that indeed is not, how great they may be: if thou
have permitted them to begin, with their causes they will increase, and they
shall be as great, as they are made by thee. Add now, that these, although
they be but little things, grow to be greater. Never do hurtful things keep
a mean. Beginnings of diseases creep forward, although they be light; and
sometimes the least accession drowneth a body that is already sick. But who
is so mad, as to believe that, that the beginnings of those things which are
placed without our will, the limits of them are according to our will? How am I
sufficiently able to put an end unto that, which I am scarce able to hinder?
Since it is more easy to exclude, then to suppress things admitted in. Some
have distinguished so that they said: A temperate and a prudent man in the
frame and habit of the mind is calm, but not in the event thereof: for in
regard of the habit of the mind he is not troubled, neither fears, nor is
sad: but many causes do outwardly fall forth, which may bring perturbation
unto him. This is it that they would say, that he is not indeed a choleric
man, yet that he is angry at sometime. And that he is not a fearful man,
yet that he fears at sometime: that is to say, he wants the vice, but not
the affection of fear. But if we allow of this fear, with frequent use it
becomes a vice: and anger being admitted into the mind, discovers that
habit of the mind that wanted anger. Furthermore, if it contemns not those
causes which outwardly come, and fears any thing, when that valiantly we are
to go against weapons, and fires, for our Country, Laws and liberty, it will
lingringly go forth, and with a mind returning back. But this diversity of
mind falls not upon a wise man. That furthermore do I judge to be observed,
lest we confound two things which are severally to be proved. For by it self
it is gathered, that there is one only good, namely, that which is honest: that
by it self again virtue is su^ficient for a happy life. If there be but one
good, namely, that which is honest; all then grant that virtue is sufficient to
live well: contrarily it shall not be rejected, if virtue alone do make a
blessed man, that there is one good, that is, that which is honest. Xenocrates
and Speusippus do suppose, that a blessed man can be made by virtue alone: yet
that is not the one only good, which is honest. Epicurus also judges, that
when one has virtue, that he is blessed, yet that virtue it self is not
sufficient to a blessed life: because pleasure may make a man blessed, which is
from virtue, and is not virtue it self. A foolish distinction. For the same
man denies, that virtue is at any time without pleasure: thus if it always be
joined unto it, and be inseparable, it also is sufficient alone. But that is
absurd, because it is said, that one shall become happy even by virtue alone:
but shall not become perfectly happy thereby: which thing how it may be done,
I do not find. For a blessed life has in it a perfect good, such as cannot
be overcome: which thing if it be thus, it is perfectly a blessed life. If the
life of the gods has in it no more nor better thing; and a blessed life is a
divine life; it has nothing wher^unto it can more lift up it self.
Furthermore, if a blessed life needs not any things every blessed life is
perfect, and a blessed, and a most blessed life is the same. What doubtest
thou, but that a blessed life is the chiefest good? Therefore if it be the
chiefest good, it is chiefly a blessed life. As the chiefest receives not
augmentation (for what is above that which shall be the chief?) so is not a
blessed life indeed, which is not without the chiefest good. But if thou shall
bring in one who is more blessed, then shall thou make a great many more
innumerable differences of the chiefest good: when I understand the chiefest
good, I speak of that which has not a degree above it self. If any be less
blessed then another: it follows, that he will more desire the life of that
other more blessed, rather then his own life: but the bl^ssed man prefers
nothing before his own life. Which of these you will it is incredible; either
that any thing remains to a blessed, which he had rather have to be, then
that which is: or that rather he should not desire that, which is better then
that other thing. For certainly, by how much he is more wise, by so much he
will extend himself to that thing which is best of all, and every manner of
way he will desire to obtain it. But how is he blessed, who can still, yea who
ought to desire? I will say what it is, whence this error does come. They know
not that blessed life is one. The quality thereof, not the greatness places it
in the best estate. Therefore alike is it long and short, broad and narrow,
distributed into many places and parts, and gathered into one. He that
esteems it by number, and measure, and parts, takes that therefrom, which is
the most excellent therein. But what is that which is excellent in a blessed
life? That it is full; namely, as the end of eating and drinking is sacietie:
he eats more, that man eats less. What difference? Either of them is full.
This man drinks more, he less: what difference? neither of them i^ a thirst.
He has lived more, he fewer years. There is no difference: if many years
have made him as well a blessed man, as a few years this man. He whom thou
call less blessed, is not blessed: the name cannot be lessened. He that is
valiant, is without fear: he that is without fear, is without sadness: he
that is without sadness is blessed. This is our interrogation. Against this
they endeavor to answer thus; that we bring in a false and a controuerted, for
a true thing, namely, that he who is valiant is without fear. What therefore?
shall not a valiant man, says he, fear evils hanging over him? This were the
part of a mad man, and of one out of his wits, and not of a valiant man. He
indeed, says he, fears most moderately, but is not altogether without fear.
They who speak th^se things are again returned unto the same thing, that
smaller vices be unto them in the place of virtues. For he who fears indeed,
but more seldom and less, wants not badnes, but is vexed with that which is
lighter. But yet I think him mad, who fears not evils hanging over him. True
it is which he says, if they be evils; but if he know that they be not ^uils,
and judges dishonesty alone to be that which is ill, he ought securely to
look upon dangers, and to contemn those things that are feared by other men:
or if it be the part of a fool or of a mad man, not to contemn evil things;
by how much any one is the more wise, by so much shall he fear the more. As it
seems to you, says he, a valiant man shall thrust himself into dangers. No;
he shall not fear, but shall avoid them. Wariness, not fear becomes him.
What therefore? Do thou say, that he shall not fear death, bands, fire, and
other weapons of fortune? No; for he knows that those things be not ill, but
seem so to be: he thinks that all these things be the ^eares of humane life.
Describe captivity, beating, chains, poverty, tearing asunder of the
members, either by sickness or by injury: and whatsoever thou shall bring
hereunto, number them amongst imaginary fears. These things are to be ^eared
by those that be fear^ull. Supposest thou that to be bad, whereunto some times
of our own accord we must come. Seek what is evil? To give place to ^hese
things which are called evil, and to yield our own liberty unto them, for
which we are to endure all things. Liberty perishes, except we contemn those
things, which lay a yoke upon us. They would not doubt what would become a
valiant man, if they knew what valor were. For it is not unadvised rashness,
nor love of dangers, nor a desire of fearful things. It is a knowledge of
distinguishing, what is evil, and what is not^ fortitude is most diligent in
defending of it self, and the same is most patient of those things, wherein is
a false show of bad things. What therefore if a sword be thrust into the throat
of a valiant man, if first one part and then another be hewed forth, if he see
his own bowels in his own arms, if after a space, to the end that he may
feel torments the more, he be set upon again, and fresh blood trickleth down
by his dried bowels? will thou not say, that this man does not fear, that he
does not feel grief? Certainly he feels pain, for no virtue puts off
the sense of a man: but he fears not: being unconquered, from on high he
looks upon his dolours. Thou demaundest, what mind then there is unto him?
The same that is unto them who exhort their sick friend. That which is evil
hurts, that which hurts makes worse. Dolor and poverty make not worse,
therefore they are not bad. False is it, says he, which is propounded; for if
any thing hurt, it does not also make worse. A tempest and storm hurt a Pilot,
but notwithstanding they make him not worse. Certain Stoics do thus answer
against this, That a Pilot is made worse by a tempest and by a storm, because
that thing which he had purposed he cannot effect, nor keep on his course.
Worse is he made, not in his skill, but in his work. To whom the Arist^telian:
therefore, says he, poverty and dolor, and whatsoever such like thing there
shall be, shall not take virtue from him, but shall hinder his working thereof.
This were rightly said, except the condition of a Pilot, and of a wiseman were
unlike. For the purpose of him is in leading his life, not without fail to
effect that which he assayeth to do, but to do all things aright. It is the
purpose of the Pilot, without fail to bring a ship into an haven. They be
servile arts, they ought to perform that which they promise. Wisdom is a
mistress and goue^nesse. The arts do serve to, wis^dome commands over life.
I judge that we must answer after another sort, namely, that neither the skill
of the governor is made worse by any tempest, nor yet the very administration
of art. The governor has not promised prosperous success unto thee, but his
profitable endeavor, and skill to govern the ship. This appears the more, by
how much the more some force of fortune has hindered him. He that has been
able to say this, O Neptune, this ship was never but right, has satisfied
skill. A tempest hinders not the work of a Pilot, but the success. What
therefore say thou? Does not that thing hurt a Pilot, which hinders him
from entering the Port? which causes his endeavors to be vain? which either
bears him back, or detaineth and disarmeth him? It hurts him not as Pilot,
but as one that does sail. Otherwise it does not so much hinder, as show the
Pilots skill. For every one can, as they say, be a pilot in the calm. These
things hinder the ship; not a pilot, as he is a pilot. Two persons a pilot
has; the one common with all who have gone aboard the same ship, wherein he
himself also is a passenger; the other proper, as he is a governor. The
tempest hurts him as he is a passenger, not as a Pilot. Furthermore the art
of a Pilot is another good, it appertains to those whom he carries: as the
art of a Physician appertains to those whom he does cure. Wisdom is a
common good, and is proper to ownes self, for those with whom he does live.
Therefore peradventure a Pilot is hurt, whose promised service to others is let
by a tempest. A wiseman is not hurt by poverty, nor by dolor, nor by other
tempests of life. For not all works of him be hindered, but only those that
pertain to other men: always is he himself indeed; then greatest of all,
when fortune has opposed her self unto him, then manageth he the business of
wisdom it self: which wisdom we have said to be both another and his own
good. Furthermore not then indeed is he hindered to profit other men, when some
necessities do press him. Through poverty he is hindered to teach, how a
Commonwealth may be managed: but he teaches that thing, how poverty is to be
managed. His work is extended all his life long. Thus no fortune, no thing
excludes the acts of a wiseman. For he does not that very thing, whereby he
is fobidden to do other things. He is fit for both chances: a governor of the
bad, an ouercomm^r of the good. So I say has he exercised himself, that he
shows virtue as well in prosperous as in adverse affairs, neither looks he
upon the matter thereof, but upon it self. Therefore neither poverty, nor
dolor, nor any other thing, which turns back the unskillful, and drives
them headlong, hinders them. Have thou rather he should be pressed? He makes
use of it. Not only of Iuorie did Phidias know how to make Images: he made them
of brass. If marble were unto him, if thou had offered baser matter, he
would have made such an one thereof, as could be mad^ of that which was the
best. So a wiseman will show virtue, if he may, in wealth; if not, in
poverty: if he shall be able, in his country; if not, in banishment^ if he
can, being a commander; if not, being a soldier: if he can, being sound; if
not, being weak: what fortune soever he shall entertain, he will perform
some memorable thing thereby. Certain tamers there be of wild beasts, who
teach the fiercest creatures, and which terrify a man when they meet him, to
suffer the yoke: and not contented to have shaken fierceness off, do tame
them, even to keep them company. The master uses often to thrust out his
hand to Lions; they kiss it. The Keeper commands his Tiger; the Ethiopian
Player commands his Elephant to fall upon their knees, and to walk upon a
rope: so a wiseman is skillful to subdue evil things. Dolor, poverty,
ignominy, prison, banishment, when they come unto him, are made tame.

EPIST. LXXXVI.
Of the Countri-house of AFRICANVS, of his building and Bath, which was neither
garnished nor neat. Against the riot of his time. Last of all, of setting
Olives, through occasion of a Countrey-house.

LYing in the very town of Scipio Africanus, I write these things unto thee,
having adored the spirit of him, and the Altar, which I suppose to be the
sepulcher of so great a man: the soul of him indeed I persuade my self that
it has returned into heaven, whence it was: not because he lead great armies
(for this also furious Cambyses did, and prosperously used fury) but for great
moderation and piety, more admirable in him when he left his country, then
when he defended it. Either Scipio must be deprived of Rome, or Rome of
liberty. Nothing, says he, will I derogate from laws, nothing from decrees.
Amongst all Citizens let there be an equal right. O my country, use the
benefit of me without me. I have been the cause, I will also be an argument of
liberty unto thee: I depart if I have increased more, then is expedient for
me. How can I choose but admire this greatness of mind? He departed into
voluntary banishment, and disburthened the City. The matter was brought unto
that pass, that either liberty should do injury to Scipio, or Scipio to
liberty. Neither was lawful to be done. Therefore he gave place to the laws,
and betook himself to Liternum, as willing to impute the banishment of
himself, as of Hannibal to the Commonwealth. I saw that town builded of
four square stone, a wall compassing about a wood, towers also set under both
sides of the town for a defense: A Cisterne laid under the buildings and
green places, which was able to serve even an army of men: A little narrow
Bath, somewhat dark, as the old fashion was. It seemed none was warmed for
our ancestors, except it were obscure. Great pleasure entered into me, beholding
the manners of Scipio and of us. In this corner that horror of Carthage, to
whom Rome is in debt, that it was taken but once, washed his body, wearied
with the labors of the country: for he exercised himself in work, and he
himself tilled the earth, as the fashion of the ancients was. He stood under
this so base a root, this so mean a floor sustained him. But now who is he
that can sustain to be bathed thus? Poor and base seems he to himself,
except the walls have shined with great and precious rounds, except Alexandrian
marbles be distinguished with Numidian roofe-cast; except all about upon them,
a curious varied plastering be laid like a picture that is drawn, except the
chamber be covered over with glass, except stone of the I Will Thassus, once a
rare gazing s^ocke in some Church, have compassed about our ponds, into which
we let down our bodies emptied of much sweat; except silver cocks have
powered out water unto us. And as yet I speak of the conduits of the common
sort: what when I shall come to the Bathes of freed men? how great pictures,
how great pillars holding nothing up, but placed for ornament sake to the
causing of cost, how great waters sliding down upon stairs with a great
noice? To that delicacie are we come, that we will not tread but upon
precious stones. In this Bathe of Scipio, there be very small chinckes, rather
then windows, cut out in the stone-wall, that without hurt of the fense, they
should let the light in. But now are they called the bathes of Gnats, if any be
not framed so, as to receive with most large windows the Sun all the day
long, except they be bathed and colored both at one time, except from a throne
they look upon both land and sea. Those therefore which had concourse and
admiration when they were dedicated, these are rejected into the number of the
old, when riot has devised some new thing, wherewithal it self might
overcome it self. But in old time there were few bathes, neither were they
adorned with any trimming up. For why should a thing of a farthing worth be
adorned, and which is found forth for use, and not for delight? Water was not
still powered in, neither always as from a warm fountain did it run fresh:
neither did they suppose that any matter it was, into what shining vessel they
put their washed-off filth. But, O the good gods, how delighted it to enter
into bathes somewhat dark, and covered with seeling of the common sort, which
thou did know, that Cato, when he was ouerseer of the buildings, or else
Fabius Maximus, or some of the Cornelij had tempered with their own hand? For
also the most noble overseers of houses, performed this duty also of going
into those places which received the people, and of exacting neatness, and a
profitable and an healthie temperature, not this which is lately found forth,
like unto a setting on fire, so that it is meet indeed to be washed alive, as a
servant convicted of some wickedness is. No difference now seems unto me,
whether the bathe be scalding hot; or be but warm. How great rudenes may some
condemn Scipio of, because into his warm bathe with large windows he did not
let in the day, because with a great deal of daylight he was not sod, and did
not see, how he might sees within a bathe? O miserable man! he knows not how
to live; he was not washed in fair, but oftentimes in troubled water, and
almost muddy, when more vehemently it did rain. Neither much cared he, whether
he were washed so, for he came to wash away sweat, and not to wash away
ointment therewith. What speeches beleeuest thou there will be of some? I envy
not Scipio, he lived in banishment indeed, who was washed thus; yea if thou will know it, he was not washed every day. For as they say, who delivered the
manners of the City as they were of old, they washed every day arms and legs,
as which had with work gathered filth, but all over were they washed every
nine days. In this place some one will say, it is apparent that they were most
unclean. What think thou they smelled of? Of war, of labor, of playing
the men. After that neat bathes are found forth, more filthy men be. Horatius
Flaccus being to describe an infamous man, and one notorious for too many
delights, what says he? Of Pomander does RVFILLVS smell --
Thou art to grant Rufillus now, that it were all one, as if he smelled of a
Goat, and were in Gorgonius his place, whom Horatius has opposed to Rufillus.
It is too little to take ointment upon thee, except it be renewed twice or
thrice in the day, lest it vanish from the body. What, that they boast of a
smell, as if it were their own? If these things seem too sad unto thee, thou
shall impute it to the village; wherein I learned from AEgialus a most diligent
husband (for he now is the possessor of this ground) that a shrub, although it
be old, may be translated into another place. This is necessary for us to
learn, who be old men, of whom there is none but planteth an Orchard of
Olives for another man. That which I have seen, this I speak; namely, that an
Orchard of three or four years old, will with a plentiful fall of the leaf
yield forth fruit; yea also that tree will cover thee: which Has been slow to
make a shade before,
To young nephews and those that were vnbore:
As our Virgil says, who beheld, not what might be spoken most truly, but
most seemly: neither desired he to teach husbandmen, but to delight those that
read. For (to pass by other things) I will add hereunto that, which is
needful to reprehend at this day. In Spring be Beans, and dunged Limons set,
And Millet does a new years care beget.
Are these to be set at one time, and whether that the Springtime be for the
sowing of them both; thou may judge from hence. The month of June, wherein
I write these things unto thee, is near unto July. In the same day I saw some
gathering Beans, and sowing Millet. I return to the Orchard of Olives, which I
saw disposed after two sorts. He removed the trunkes of great trees, the
boughs being cut off all about, and being brought to one foot length, with the
body of the tree, the roots being cut off, that the very head being only
left, whence those did hang. This being besmeared with dung, he put into an
hole: afterward he did not heap in the earth, but troad and pressed it down.
There is nothing (as h^ says) more effectual then stamping it hard, namely,
for that it excludes the cold and wind; less also it is shaken: and for this
it suffers the springing roots to go forth, and to lay hold upon the ground;
which is needful to be tender as yet, and lightly to stick thereunto, light
tossing also up and down, plucketh it up again: but it is scarce a tree,
until the root do plentifully hide it self in the ground, for from every
matter which is made naked, as he says, new roots do come out. But the stock
of the tree ought not to stand out above upon the earth, no more then three or
four feet; for presently it will be garnished from below: neither shall a
great part thereof, as in old Oliue-gardens be withered, and scorchingly dry.
This also has been another manner of planting them. In the same kind I have
set in the ground strong boughs, not of an hard bark, such as are ^ccustomed
of the tender trees: but when they come, as it were, from a plant, they have no
rough nor ill-fauoured thing in them. That also have I now seen, an old Vine
to be translated from her shrub: The small strings also of this (if it may be)
are to be gathered, there the Vine more largely is to be spread abroad, that
also it may take root from the body thereof. And I have seen^ them set, not
only in the Month of February; but also in the Month of March, which laid
hold upon, and embraced Elmes about, which were none of their own. All these
trees which (as I so speak) are in great plenty, are, as he says, to be
helped with Cisterne water: which if it profit, we have rain in the power of
our selves. I think it not meet to teach thee any more, lest even as our
AEgialus has made me to be an adversary unto him, so also I procure thee to
be unto me.

EPIST. LXXXVII.
The frugalitie of SANECA and contempt of external things: an admonition unto
others, that their wills and deeds might be such. Then follow small
disputations, wherein he approoueth, that casual things are not amongst those
that be good: only that they may be called Commodities.

I Have suffered shipwreck, before I have gone aboard: how it has come to
pass, I set not down, least amongst the Stoicall paradoxes thou suppose, that
this also is to be put: of which things, I will approve when thou will, yea
if thou will not, that none is false, nor so wonderful, as appears to be at
the first sight. In the mean space this journey has instructed me, how many
things we need not to have, and how easily with judgment we might contemn
them, which if at any time necessity has taken away, we feel them not to be
taken away. With a very few servants, whom one Coach could contain, without any
stuff, save that which was carried upon our backs, I and my Maximus have now
led these two days a happy life. A matteresse lies upon the ground, I upon
the matteresse. Of two cloakes, the one is a blanket to lie upon, the other is
made a couerlid. Concerning my dinner, nothing is superfluous therein, it has
been made ready in no more then in an hours time; never without dry figs,
never without an handful of herbs: those if I have bread, be made like
watergruell: if not, they be for bread: always are they served in upon
New-yeares day, which I make prosperous and ble^sed by thoughts that be good,
and by greatness of the mind: which never is greater then when it has
separated foreign things: and by fearing of nothing has got peace unto it
self; and by coveting of nothing has got wealth unto it self. The Coach
wherein I ride, is a country one. The Mules testify that they live by going
only. The Muleter is unshod, but not for heat: I scarce obtain of my self,
that I would have this Coach to be supposed mine. A perverse shamefastness of
that which is right abides as yet: so often as we do fall into some brauer
company, I blush against my will; which is an argument, that these things which
I approve, which I praise, have not as yet a certain and immovable seat. He
that blusheth at a base Coach, glories at a precious one. Little have I
profited as yet, I dare not publish frugalitie, yea now do I care for the
opinions of those that pass by. A voice was to be sent out against the
opinions of all mankind: ye be mad, you err, you be amassed at superfluous
things, you esteem no man according to his worth. When ye come to patrimony
ye are most diligent reckoners; thus ye set down an account of every o^e, to
whom ye will commit either money or benefits. For these also do ye account
amongst your expenses. He possesses a great deal, but he owes much: he has
a fair house, but it is gotten with the money of other men: no man on the
sudden can show a more gallant family, but he pays not his debts. If he
shall pay his creditors nothing shall remain unto him. The same ye ought also
to do in other things, to examine how much proper goods every man has. Thou
supposest him to be a rich man, because golden household stuff follows him
upon the way, because he tilleth grounds in all Provinces, because a great
book of his accounts is roulled up, because he possesses so much ground in
the Suburbs, as with envy he should possess in the deserts of Apulia: and
when thou have said all, he is a poor man; wherefore? because he is in debt.
How much, say thou? All that he has, exc^pt peradventure thou think that
there is a differenc^, whether that one has borrowed of a man, or of fortune.
What to the purpose do appertain fatted Mules, all of one color? What these
carved Coaches? Tapestry, Scarlet, foot clothes horses bore,
And long gold poitrels on their breasts before.
Covered with gold, they champ a yellow bit,
And with their teeth the gold they chaw of it.
These things can make neither a better Master nor Mule. Marcus Cato the Censor
(whose birth truly profited the people of Rome, as much as Scipi^es did; for
the one made war with our enemies, the other with manners of the time) was
carried on a gelding, and had a cloake-bagge behind him, wherein he carried
his necessary stu^fe. O how do I wish that some of these delicate horsemen
might meet with him, having footmen and Numidians, and a great deal of dust
before him. He without doubt would seem richer and better attended then Cato
was: he amongst that delicate preparation, yea, when he doubts exceeding
much, whether to bestow himself on the sword, or on the knife. O how great a
dignity was it to that age, that an Emperor, who had triumphed, who had been
Censor, and which is above all, that Cato should be contented with one horse,
nay certainly not with a whole horse; for his fardell hanging down on both
sides, posses^ed part of him. Thus would thou not prefer before all the
well-fed ambling nags, before great and easy going horses, that one only
horse rubbed by Cato himself? I do not see that any end will be unto this
matter, except that which I shall cause to my self. Here therefor will I
hold my peace as concerning these things: which without doubt he foresaw they
would be such, as now they be; who first called them impediments. Now further
will I relate a very few interrogations of our men pertaining to virtue, which
we strive to be sufficient for a blessed li^e. That which is good, makes men
to be good. For also in musicke-skill, that which is good makes a Musician.
Casual goods make not a man good, therefore they be not good. The
Aristotelians do thus answer against this, that they say that to be false,
which we do first of all propound: from that say they which is good, men are
not also made good. In music there is some thing that is good, as a Pipe, an
Harpe-string, or some instrument fitted for the use of singing: notwithstanding
not any of these things makes a Musician. Here will we answer; you understand
not how we have placed that which is good to a Musician: for we do not speak
of that which instructs, but of that which makes a Musician: thou come to
the furniture of skill, and not unto skill. But if there be any thing which is
good in Music skill, that certainly will make a Musician so to be: yea,
furthermore I will make that to be more plain. That which is good in music
skill, is said so to be two manner of ways; the one whereby musical effects,
the other whereby Art is helped. The instruments of the Pipe, and Organs, and
Harpe-strings do appertain to the effect, but they do not appertain to the
Art it self; for he is a workman without these, but cannot peradventure
without them use his skill. This is not alike double in a man: for there is the
same good both of a man, and of his life. That is not good which can befall
every most base and dishonest man: but riches befall both to the Bawd and
Fencer, and therefore they are not good. That which is propounded, say they, is
false; for in Grammar skill, and in the Art of Physic and of governing, we
see that goods do befall to every one of the basest sort. But these Arts
profess not a greatness of the mind, they rise not aloft, neither disdain
they such things as come by chance. Virtue extolleth a man, and places him
above those which are dear to mortal wights: neither does he too much desire
or fear those things that are called good or bad. Chelidon one of those
effeminate ones which Cleopatra had, possessed a great Pattimonie: lately
Natalis, both of a wicked and of an vnpure tongue, into the mouth of whom women
were purged, both was the heir of much, and left many heirs. What therefore?
did money make him pure, or did not he himself pollute money? which so falls
upon certain men, as a piece of money falls into the vault. Virtue stands
above the^e things, it is deemed by the worth of it self: it judges none of
these things to be good, howsoever they fall unto us. Physic and government
forbid not to themselves and to theirs, the admiration of such things. He that
is not a good man, may nevertheless be a Physician, may be a Governor, may be
a Grammarian forsooth as well as a Cook. To whom it befalls not to have
every thing, him may thou not call an universal man. What things every one
has, such a manner of man he is. The Exchequer is worth so much as it has;
yea, into the reuenew thereof comes that which it has. Who sets any price
upon a full bag, except the sum of the money put therein has caused him?
The same befalls to a Master of great patrimonies, they are the revenues and
the appendices unto them. Why therefore is a wiseman great? Because he has a
great mind. True therefore it is, that that is not good, which befalls unto
every most base man. Therefore will I never say, that the want of sorrow is a
good thing, a Grasshopper has that, a Gnat has that. Nor indeed will I say,
that quietness, and to want trouble is a good thing. What is more idle then a
Worm? Seek thou what makes a man wise, what makes a God? It is meet that
thou give some divine, some heavenly, some magnificent thing. Good falls not
upon all, neither endures it every possessor. See thou, What every land will
bear, or will not have;
This corn, that grapes, more happily does crave.
Some-where young trees do sprout, and grass amain:
Of Saffron smells, hill Tmolus is the vain.
Does not the Indian clime send Iu'ry out;
Of Sabaeis soft is not their incense bought?
From naked Chalybes is Iron brought.
These things are assigned to their own place, that commerce might be
necessary unto men amongst themselves, if interchangeably one should demand
somewhat of another man. That chiefest good it self has also his seat: it
springs not where Iuorie or Iron does. Seek thou what is the place of the
chiefest good? The mind: this except it be pure and holy, entertaineth not
God. God is not made of that which is bad; but riches are caused by
couetuousnes; therefore they be not good. It is not good, says he, that good
springs o^ that which is bad. From sacrilege and from theft does money come:
ther^ore bad indeed is sacrilege and theft: but because, it causes more bad,
then good things. For it gives gain, but with fear, with care, with torments
both of body and of mind. Whosoever speaks this, it is needful that he
admit, that as sacrilege is bad^ because it does many bad things, so also that
it is good in some sort, because it does some good: then which thing what is
more monstrous? Although we be altogether persuaded, that sacrilege, theft,
and adultery are among^t those things that be good. How many blush not at
theft; how many boast of adultery? for small sacriledges are punished, great
ones are carried in triumph. Add now that sacrilege, if altogether it be good
in any sort, shall also be honest, and shall be said to be well done: for the
action is ours, which thing the thought of no man receives, therefore good
things cannot come of those that be bad. For if, as ye say, for this one thing
sacrilege is bad, because it brings much evil: if thou shall remit
punishments to it, if thou shall promise security, altogether it shall be good.
But the greatest punishment of heinous deeds is in themselves. Thou errest, I
say, if thou put them off to the Hangman, and to the Iayle: presently are they
punished, when they are done, yea whilst they are in doing them. Therefore good
is not borne from that which is bad, no more then a Fig from an Olive tree.
They answer that they be borne for seed: good things cannot wax worse. As that
which is honest, is not borne from a dishonest thing, so from a bad thing is
not that which is good: for the same is an honest and a good thing. Some of
ours do thus answer against this: let us suppose that money is a good thing,
whence soever it be taken, notwithstanding money is not therefore from
sacrilege, although it be taken from sacrilege. Thus understand this. In the
same pitcher there is both gold and a viper. If thou shall take the gold out o^
the pitcher, because there also a viper is, not therefore does the pitcher give
gold unto me, because it contains a viper, but it gives gold, although it
have a viper. After the same sort gain is made from sacrilege, not as
sacrilege is dishonest and wicked, but as it has gain; even as i^ that
pitcher a viper is bad, not the gold which lies with the viper: so in
sacrilege the heinous deed is bad, but not the gain. Again, it is argued:
the condition of both the things is most unlike: there can I take away gold
without the viper: here I cannot make gain without sacrilege: this gain is
not added to, but is mingled with wickedness. Which whilst we will obtain,
we fall into many evil things: that is not good, whilst we will obtain
riches, that we fall into many bad things; therefore riches are not good. Your
proposition, says he, has two significations; the one whilst we will obtain
riches, that we fall into many bad things: but into many bad things do we
fall, whilst also we would obtain virtue. Some one whilst he has sailed
to study, has suffered shipwreck; another has been taken. Another
signification is thus, that whereby we fall into evils, that is not good. The
consequent to this proposition will not be: by riches or by pleasures we fall
into evils: or if by riches we fall into many evils, riches are not only not
good, but be bad. But ye only say, that they be not that which is good.
Furthermore, says he, ye grant that riches have some use, and amongst
commodities do ye number them. But by the same reason they shall not be a
profit indeed: for by them many discommodities come to us. Some men answer
thus unto these things: ye err, who impute discommodities unto riches. They
hurt no man, either does folly hurt every man, or the wickedness of other men:
so, even as a sword which kills no man, yet is the weapon of him that does
kill. Riches therefore do not hurt thee, if for riches there be hurt unto
thee. Posidonius speaks better, as I suppose, who says, that riches are the
cause of evil things, not because themselves can do any thing, but because
they provoke those that will do. For there is one efficient cause, which of
necessity forthwith must hurt: another is a precedent cause, riches have in
them this precedent cause. They pu^fe up the mind, bring forth pride, procure
envy, and so far forth estrange the mind, that the fame of money, yea that
which will hurt delights us. But good things ought to want all manner of
blame: they be pure, they do not corrupt, nor solicit the mind: they lift up
indeed and dilate, but without swelling. Those things that be good, cause
confidence, riches cause boldness. Those things that are good cause
magnanimity, riches insolency. But insolency is nothing else, then a false
show of greatness. After this sort say thou, riches are not only not that
which is good, but also that which is bad. They were a bad thing, if by
themselves they should hurt; if (as I have said) they should have an efficient
cause: now they have a precedent cause, and indeed not only one provoking, but
drawing minds thereunto. For they show forth a very likely shape of that which
is good, and credible to most men. Virtue also has a precedent cause unto
envy, for many through wisdom, many through justice are envied at: but
neither from it self has it this cause, nor any like unto it. For contrarily
that more likely shape is by ver^ue set before the minds of men, which may
call them unto love and admiration thereof. Posidonius says, that we must
reason thus: What things give neither greatness, nor confidence, nor security
to the mind, are not good: but riches, and good health, and things like unto
these, cause none of these things; therefore they are not good: yea also he
enforces this reason after this sort. Those things be bad which give neither
greatness, nor confidence, nor security to the mind; but contrarily beget
insolency, pride, arrogancy: but by casual things we are enforced into
these; therefore they are not good. By this reason, says he, they shall not be
commodities indeed. There is one condition of commodities, another of good
things. A commodity is which has more use, then trouble: a good thing ought
to be sincere and without hurt on ^uery part. That is not good which profits
more, but that which brings pro^it alone. Wherefore, commodity pertains
both to living creatures, and to imperfect men, and to fools. Therefore
discommoditie may be mixed therewithal: but it is called commodity, being
esteemed by the greater part thereof. That which is good, appertains to a
wiseman alone, it is meet that it should be without hurt. Be of good courage:
one, but an Herculean knot remains unto thee. From bad things good is not
made; from many pouerties riches do not come; therefore riches are not good.
Our men acknowledge not this reason. The Aristotelians both feign and loosen
it. But Posidonius says, that this Sophisme is tossed through all the
Logicians Schools, and by Antipater is refelled thus. Poverty is not called
according to a putting to, but according to a taking from, or (as the Ancients
have said by privation: the Grecians say, (...): not because it has, is it
called, but because it has not. Therefore by many void things nothing can be
filled: many things, and not much want, are the cause of riches. Thou
understand poverty, otherwise then thou ought to do. Poverty is, not
which possesses a few, but which possesses not many things. Therefore it is
called not from that which it has, but from that which is wanting unto. More
easily would I express that which I mean, if there were a Latin word,
whereby (...) is signified. Antipater assigns this to poverty. I see not
what other thing poverty may be, then possession of a small thing. Concerning
this we will see, if there shall be great leisure at any time, what the
substance of riches, what the substance of poverty may be: but then also will
we consider, whether it were better to assuage poverty, to take lofty looks
from riches, then to strive concerning words, as though already we had judged
of the things. Let us suppose that we are called to a Parliament. A law is
propounded for the abolishing of riches: by these reasons shall we persuade or
dissuade? By these shall we cause the people of Rome to require, and to praise
poverty, the foundation and cause of their Empire? and to fear their wealth?
to think how they have found these amongst the conquered? that hence ambition,
and bribery, and tumults have broken into a most holy and a most temperate
City? That too luxuriously the spoils of the Nations are showed out? That one
people has taken from all, more easily that from one it might be taken by
all. It is better to persuade these things, and to fight against the
affections, not to beguile them. If we can, let us speak more valiantly; if
not, more openly.

EPIST. LXXXVIII.
Liberal studies are not amongst good things, neither do they of themselves
lead to virtue. Severally teaches he this in Grammar, in Music, in
Geometry, in Astronomy. But although they do not lead, yet they help: that
is, they fu^ther and prepare. Then there is another division of Arts, into
Vulgar, Sporting, Childish, Liberal: and amongst these he makes Philosophy
to be only that, which truly makes free. Yea it alone searches forth
concerning Good and Bad things, it alone knows them; it therefore alone, or
chiefly is to be embraced: and shows how unprofitable and superfluous things
Great Readers ^ollow after, yea some Philosophers too. O good, O golden things
be here! Read ye both young and old.

THou desire to know what I think concerning liberal studies. I admire
none, I number none amongst those things that be good, whose end is for gain.
Hired workmanships they be, so far profitable, as they prepare, and not
detain the wit. For so long must we abide in them, as the mind can perform
no greater thing; they be our rudiments, not our works. Wherefore, thou see
they be called liberal studies, because they be worthy of a free man. But one
study is liberal indeed, which makes a free man; this is of wisdom, high,
valiant, magnanimous; other be petty and childish things. Beleeuest thou that
there is any good in these things? the professors whereof thou see to be the
most dishonest, and the most wicked of all men? We ought not to learn, but to
have learned these. Some have judged that that question is to be propounded
concerning liberal studies, whether they could make a man good. They promise
it not indeed, neither do they affect the knowledge of this thing. A
Grammarian is conversant about the care of speech, and if he will wander any
further, about Histories yea that he may extend his limits the farthest of all,
about verses. What of these makes the way to virtue? Does the unfolding of
Syllables, and diligence of words, and memory of fables, and the law and
scanning of verses? Which of these takes away fear, takes out covetousness,
refraineth lust? Let us pass to Geometry, and to music: nothing shall thou
find with them, which forbids to fear, forbids to covet: which
whosoever is ignorant of, in vain he knows other things. Let us see whether
these teach virtue, or not, if they do not teach, they deliver it not indeed:
if they do teach^ they be Philosophers. Will thou know, how that they have not
sit down to teach virtue? behold how unlike the studies of all be amongst
themselves: but likeness had bin if they had taught the same things. Except
peradventure they persuade thee, that Homer was a Philosopher, with these very
things whereby they conclude, they may deny it. For sometimes they make him a
Stoic, allowing of virtue alone, and flying back from pleasures, and not
retiring back from that which is honest, for the price of immortality it
self: sometime an Epicurean praising the state of a quiet City, and amongst
bankets and songs spending his life: sometime an Aristotelian bringing in three
kinds of good things: sometime an Academick, teaching all things to be
uncertain. It appears that none of these things be in him, because that all
be: for these things disagree amongst themselves. Let us grant unto them, that
Homer was a Philosopher: certainly he was made wise before he knew any verse:
therefore let us learn those things, which have made Homer to be a wiseman.
For me to seek after this thing indeed, whether Homer or Hesiod were elder by
birth, no more appertains to the business, then to know, whether Hecuba was
younger then Helen^ and why so badly she did bear her age. What, I say,
supposest thou that it appertains to the purpose, to enquire for the years
of Patroclus and Achilles? Seek thou where Vlixes did wander, rather then
that thou cause, that we do not always go astray? There is not idle time to
hear, whether that Vlixes were tossed betwixt Italy and Sicily, or was without
the world that is known unto us: for so long a wandering could not be in so
narrow a place. Tempests of the mind do daily toss us, and wickedness
drives us upon all the evils, which Vlixes ^ad. Beauty is not wan^ing which
may solicit the eyes, not an enemy: hence are very cruel monsters and
delighting in humane blood: hence are deceitful allurements of the ears:
hence are shipwrackes and so many varieties of evil things. Teach me this
thing how I may love my Country, how my wife, how my father, how even
su^fering shipwreck, I may s^ile unto these so honest things. What inquire
thou, whether Penelope was vnchast^ whether she deceived her age, whether she
suspected him to be Vlixes whom she saw, before that she knew it to be true?
Teach me what chastity is, and how great a good there is in it^ whether it
be placed in the body or in the mind. I pass to a Musician. Thou teach
me how acute and grave sounds may agree amongst themselves, how a concord may
be of strings making an unlike sound. Make rather that my mind may agree with
itself, and that my counsels may not disagree. Thou show unto me which be
the mourning tunes: show rather how in adversity I may not utter a mourning
voice. The Geometrician teaches me to measure large pieces of grounds: rather
let him teach, how I may measure, how much may be sufficient to a man.
Arithmeticke teaches me to number, and to lend my fingers to covetousness:
rather let it teach^ that these computations do nothing appertain to mine
estate. He is not an happier man, whose patrimony wearieth the casters up of
his accounts: yea very super^luous things may he possess, who shall become
most unhappy, if he be constrained to reckon up, how much he has. What
profits it me to know, how to divide a small field into parts, if I know not
with my brother how to divide it? What profits it subtly to know how many
feet are in an acre of ground, and also to comprehend if any thing has
escaped the perch; if a mighty neighbor makes me sad and encroacheth on
somewhat of that which is mine? Teach thou me, how I may lose nothing of my
bounds? but I am willing to learn how I may lose them all with mirth. I am
expelled, says he, from my fathers and from my grandfathers land. What? before
thy grandfather who possessed this ground? Tell if thou can; not what man's,
but what peoples it was? Thereon have thou entered, not as a Lord, but as a
Tenant. Whose Tenant art thou? Thine heirs, if thou have good luck. Lawyers
deny, that any thing can be prescribed upon, which i^ publike^ this is public
which thou possessest, and belongs indeed unto mankind. O remarkable Art!
thou know to measure round things, thou bring into a quadrate what shape
soever thou shall receive: thou tellest of the distances of the stars:
nothing is there but falls within the measure. If thou be a workman, measure
the mind of man: tell how great, tell how little it is. Thou know which is
a straight line; what profits it to thee, if thou be ignorant what is
straight in life? Now I come to him who boasts in the knowledge of heavenly
things. Whether cold SATVRNE does it self betake,
And what circles CYLLENIVS star does make.
What shall it profit to know this? that I may be careful when Saturn and
Mars shall be in opposition, or when Mercury shall make his evening fall
Saturn looking? Rather I will learn this, that wheresoever these things be,
that they be prosperous, that they cannot be changed. A continual order and an
inevitable course of destinies moves these: by set courses they do retire.
They either move or note forth the effects of all things. But whether they be
the cause, why every thing falls forth, what shall the knowledge of an
unchangeable thing profit thee? or whether they signify, what skilleth it to
provide for that which thou can not avoid? Whether thou do know or not know
these things, they shall come to pass. On the swift Sun, and stars that
follow it,
If that thou look in order as they sit,
The ensuing day will never thee deceive,
Nor clear nights slights of foresight will bereave.
Sufficiently and abundantly it is provided, that I should be safe from
ambushes. Does not the time that is to morrow deceive me? for it deceives him
that is ignorant hereof. I know not what shall be; I know what may come to
pass. I despair nothing of this, I expect the whole. If any thing be
remitted, I take it in good part. Time deceives, if it spares mee^ but
neither so indeed deceives it. For as I know that all things may fall forth,
so also I know that for certain they will not fall forth. For certain I
expect prosperous things: I am prepared for those that be bad. In that it is
needful that thou suffer me not going by that which is put in writing. For I
am not persuaded to receive Painters into the number of the liberal arts, no
more then makers of statues, or workers in marble^ or other servants of
riotousnes. Alike do I expel wrastlers from these liberal studies, and all
the skill consisting in oil and clay; or may I receive those that make sweet
oiles, and Cooks and others, that do apply their wits for the pleasures of us?
For liberal things, I pray thee have these ^asting vomitors, whose bodies be
fat, but minds be lean and asleep? Do we believe that this is a liberal
study for our youth, which our ancestors have exercised to be right, to cast
Darts, to toss a Spear, to ride an horse, to handle weapons. Nothing did they
teach their children, that was to be learned by those that lie still. But
neither these nor those do teach or nourish virtue. For what profits it to
govern a horse, and with a bridle to moderate his course, and with most
unbridled affections to be led away? What profits it with wrestling, or with
buffets to overcome many men, and to be overcome by anger? What therefore? Do
liberal studies bestow nothing upon us? For other things much, for virtue
nothing. For these base professed Arts, which consist of the hand, confer very
much to the instruments of life, notwithstanding to virtue they do not belong.
Why therefore do we instruct our children in liberal studies? Not because
they can give virtue, but because they prepare the mind to the receiving of
it. For as that first literature, as the ancients called it, whereby the first
principles are delivered to children, teaches not the liberal Arts, but
prepares a place for the first receiving of them: so liberal Arts lead not
the mind to virtue, but make it fit. Posidonius says that there be ^oure
kinds of Arts; the vulgar and base, sporting, childish, and the liberal Arts.
Vulgar be of crafts-men, which consist of the hand, and be busied for the
furnishing of life; wherein there is no counterfeiting of comeliness, nor of
any honest thing. Sporting Arts be those which tend to the pleasure of the eyes
and of the ears. To these you may number the Inginers, who devise frames
rising up of themselves, and boards secretly increasing to a great height, and
other varieties scarce thought upon; either those things seperating which did
cleave together, or these things which s^ood asunder, coming together of their
own accord, or these things which stood up by little and little, settling down
again upon themselves. The eyes of the unskillful are stricken with these
things, wondering (because they have not known the causes) at all sudden
things. Childish they be, and have some similitude with the Liberal Arts,
namely, these which the Grecians call (...), and our men call Liberal Arts.
But they alone are Liberal Arts (and as I may more truly speak) be free,
which have a care of virtue. Even as, says he, some part of the mind is for
natural, some for moral, some for reasoning Philosophy; so also this troop
of Liberal Arts, does in Philosophy challenge a place unto it self. When we
come to Natural questions, we stand to the testimony of Geom^trie. Therefore
is it a part of that which it does help? Many things help us, yet for that
they are no parts of us: yea if they were parts, they would not help. Meat is
an help of the body, yet is it not a part. The service of Geometry performs
somewhat unto us: so is it needful to Philosophy, as a Carpenter is unto it:
but neither is he a part of Geometry, nor that of Philosophy. Furthermore,
both have their ends: for a wiseman both seek^th and knows the causes of
natural things, the numbers and measures of which, a Geometrician follows
after and counts. A wise man knows after what manner heavenly things
consist, what forc^, or what nature is unto them: a Mathematician collecteth
the courses, and returnings back, and the observations, by which they descend
and be ^ifted up, and sometimes make a show as though they stood still,
although that heavenly things cannot stand. A wiseman knows what the cause
is that expresses images in a glass: a Geometrician can tell that unto thee,
how much a body ought to be absent from the image, and what form is of the
glass that may represent images. A Philosopher will prove the Sun to be
great: the Mathematician will show how great it is, who proceeds by a
certain exercise and use; but that he may proceed, certain principles are to
be obtained by him. But that Art stands not upon her own right, whose
foundation is by request. Philosophy desires nothing from another thing, it
raises up the whole work from the ground. The Mathematics (as I may so
speak) is a superficial Art, it receives principles from others, by the
benefit of which it may come to farther things: if by it self it could come to
that which is true, if it could comprehend the nature of the whole world, I
should say that it would bestow much upon our minds, which increase by the
handling of heavenly things, and draw somewhat from it. The mind is made
perfect by one thing, namely, by the unchangeable knowledge of good and bad
things; which agrees unto Philosophy only. But none other Art enquireth
about good and bad things: let us consider all Virtues in particular. Fortitude
is a contemner of things to be feared: it despises, provoke and breaks
terrible things, and such as send our liberty under the yoke: what therefore
do liberal studies strengthen this? Fidelity is the most holy good thing of
a humane breast, by no necessity is it constrained to deceive, it is corrupted
by no reward. Burn, says he, beat, kill, I will not betray; but by how much
the more pain shall seek to discover secret things, by so much will I the
more deeply hide them: what are liberal studies able to cause these minds?
Temperance rules over pleasures; it hates and drives away some, it
dispenses with other some, and reduces them to a sound mean, neither at any
time does it for themselves come unto them. It knows that the best mean of
desired things is, not to take how much thou will, but how much thou ought.
Humanity forbids to be proud over thy fellows, to be covetous: in words,
in deeds, in affections it shows it self gentle and easy unto all; it
supposes none ^uill to be estranged from him, but especially it loves that
good of it self which shall be for another good; what do liberal studies
command these manners? No more then simplicity, modesty, frugalitie, and
parsimonie; no more then cl^mencie, which spares the blood of another as it
were his own, and knows that a man must not prodigally use a man. When ye
say (says he) that without liberal studies virtue cannot be attained unto:
how deny ye that those things confer nothing to virtue? Because neither
without meat can vert^e be attained unto, yet notwithstanding meat
appertains not to virtue. Wood conferreth nothing upon a ship, although that
a ship cannot be made without wood. There is no cause, says he, that thou
may think any thing to be made with the help of that thing, without which
it could not be made. That also may be spoken indeed, that without liberal
studies wisdom may be comne by: for although that virtue be to be learned,
notwithstanding it is not learned by these things. But why is it, wherefore I
should esteem that he shall not become wise, who is ignorant of learning,
seeing wisdom is not in learning? It delivers deeds, not words; and I
cannot tell whether the memory may be more sure, which has no help out of it
self. Wisdom is a great and spacious thing; it has need of an empty place:
we must learn divine and humane things, things past, things to come, things
fading an eternal, and time it self: concerning which one thing, see how many
things may be sought for; first, whether any thing may be by it self, then,
whether any thing may be before time: if time has begun with the world,
whether also before the world; because somewhat has been, time has also
been. Innumerable questions be only concerning the mind; whence it may be, and
what, when it begins to be, how long it may be: whether it may pass from
one place to another, and may change her house, and may be cast from one form
of living creatures into another: or that it may serve no more then once, and
being sent forth may wander in the whole world: whether it be a body, or no:
what it will do, when it has ceased to do any thing by us: how she will use
her liberty when she shall flee out of this den: whether it may forget
former things, and there begin to know it self, after that it being led out of
the body, has departed on high. Whatsoever part of divine and humane affairs
thou shall comprehend, thou shall be wearied with huge abundance of things to
be sought for, and to be learned. That these so many, and so great things may
have ^ree place of remaining, super^luous things are to be taken out of the
mind. Virtue will not put it self into these straits: a great matter desires
a large space: let all things be expelled; let the whole br^st be empty for
it. But the knowledge of many Arts delights. Let us therefore retain so much
of them, as is necessary. Supposest thou that it is a thing to be reprehended
in him, who gets sup^rfluous things for his use, and lays abroad the pomp
of precious things in his house: and think thou him not to be blameworthy,
who is occupied in the superfluous implements of learning? To be willing to
know more, then may be sufficient, is a kind of intemperancie. What, that this
following after Liberal Arts makes men troublesome, full of words,
unseasonable, pleasures of themselves, and therefore not learning necessary
things, because they have learned superfluous things. Dydimus the Grammarian
wrote four thousand books: wretched, if he had read so many superfluous
things. In these book it is sought of the Country of Homer; in these of the
true mother of AEnaeas: in these whether Anacreon led a more lustful or a more
drunken life: whether Sappho was a whore; and other which were to be unlearned,
if thou should know them. Go now, and deny life to be long. But also when
thou shall come to our own men, I will show that many things with axes are to
be cut off. This praising, O learned man! costeth great expense of time, great
trouble of the ^are of other men. Let us be content with this more rusticke
title: O good man. Is it even so? Shall I toss over the Chronicles of all
Nations, and shall I search who first has written verses: how much time may be
betwixt Orpheus and Homer; when I have not records of time, shall I reckon it:
and shall I reuiew the note of Aris^archus, wherewith he noted the verses of
other men: and in Syllables shall I spend my time? What shall I so s^icke in
the Geometrical dust? Has that wholesome precept, Spare time, so fallen out
of mind? Shall I know these things, and be ignorant of my self? Appion the
Grammarian, who under Caius Caesar was carried about in all Greece, and by all
Cities was adopted into Homers name, said, that Homer having finish^d the
matter both of the Odysses and Iliads, added a beginning to his work, wherein
he comprehended the Trojan war. He brought an argument of this thing, because
of purpose he had placed two letters in the first verse, containing the number
of his books. It is meet that he know these things, who will know many things.
Will thou not think how much time bad health may take from thee, how much
public and private business, how much business by day, how much sleep,
measure thine age, it is not capable of so many things. I speak of Liberal
s^udies: how much superfluity Philosophers have, how much retiring from use.
They also have descended to the distinction of Syllables, and to the
proprieties of conjunctions and prepositions, and to envy Grammarians, to envy
Geometricians. Whatsoever was superfluous in the Arts of them, they translated
into their own Art. Thus it is come to pass, that through more diligence they
know rather to speak, then to live. Hear how great evil too great subtlety
can cause, and how great an enemy it is to truth. Protagoras says, that
alike, concerning every thing it may be disputed on upon both parts: and
concerning this very thing, whether that every thing may be disputed on upon
both parts. Nausiphanes says, that of these things that seem to be, that
nothing rather is, then is not. Parmenides says, that of these things that are
seen, there is nothing at all. Z^no El^ates has cast all business out of
business; he says, that nothing is. The Pyrrhonians are for the most part
conversant about the same things, so are the Meg^ricans, and Eretricans, and
the Academicks, who have brought in a new knowledge, of knowing nothing. Cast
all these things into that superfluous flock of Liberal studies. Those
deliver a knowledge that will not profit; these take away the hope of all
knowledge: it is better to know superfluous things, then nothing at all. These
do not carry a light before, whereby the eye may be directed to that which is
true: these put out mine eyes. If I believe Protagoras, there is nothing but
doubts in the nature of things: if Nausiphanes, this one thing is certain,
that nothing is certain: if Parmenides, there is nothing but one thing: if
Zen^, there is not one thing indeed. What therefore be we? What these things
which stand about, nourish, and sustain us? The whole nature of things is a
shade, or vain, or deceitful. I cannot easily tell, whether I may be more
angry at them, who would have us to know nothing: or at them, who have not
indeed left this thing unto us, to know nothing.

EPIST. LXXXIX.
The difference betwixt Philosophy and wisdom: and a diverse division
thereof, and again a division and description of the parts. Then an
admonition, that these and such like are to be referred to manners and to the
mind: and by the way he inueigheth against those that be badly rich, and
therewithal he chastises riotousnesse and covetousness.

THou desire a profitable thing, and which is for certain necessary unto
wisdom, namely, that Philosophy be divided, and that the huge body thereof
be disposed into members. For more easily by parts are we brought to the
knowledge of the whole. I would that as the face of the whole world comes
into sight, so that whole Philosophy might come unto us, a sight most like to
the world. For truly it would speedily draw all mortal men into admiration of
it self, these things being left, which now with great admiration of the great
ones, we do believe. But because this cannot fall forth, so shall it be looked
upon by us, as the secrets of the world are seen. The mind of a wiseman
indeed comprehends the whole frame thereof, neither less swiftly goes about
it, then our eye goes about the sky: but to us, to whom darkness is to be
broken through, and whose sight fails in that which is hard by, several
things can more easily be showed, we being as yet not capable of the whole. I
will therefore do that which thou requirest, and I will divide Philosophy
into parts, not into pieces. For it is profitable to be divided, and not to be
hacked small. For as to comprehend the greatest, so hard it is, to comprehend
the smallest things The people are described into Tribes, an army into
hundreths. Whatsoever has increased to be very great, is more easily taken
notice of, if it has departed into parts^ which (as I have said) it is no^
meet, they should be innumerable and small. For too great a division has the
same fault, that no division has: it is like to that which is confused,
whatsoever is ^ut even unto dust. First therefore as it seems I will tell,
what difference there may be between wisdom and Philosophy. Wisdom is a
perfect good thing of the mind of man: Philosophy is a love, an affectation
of wisdom. This shows that which it has attained unto. It appears, whence
Philosophy may be named: for it confesses with the name it self. Some have
defined wisdom thus; that they called it a knowledge of divine and of humane
things. Some thus; Wisdom is to have known divine and humane things, and the
causes of these. This addition seems superfluous unto me, because causes be
parts of divine and of humane things. Also there have been who have defined
Philosophy, some one way, and some another way: some have said, that it is a
study of virtue; some a study of correcting the mind. By some it is called a
desire of true reason. As though it were manifest, that there were some
difference betwixt Philosophy and Wisdom. For it cannot come to pass, that
that which is affec^ed, and that which affects is the same thing. As there is
much difference betwixt money and covetousness, seeing the one desires, the
other is desired: so is there betwixt Philosophy and Wisdom. For this is the
reward and effect of that^ that comes, this is come unto. Wisdom is that
which the Grecians call (...). This word did the Romans also use, as also they
now use Philosophy; thing which the ancient Comedies acted in gowns will
prove, and the title written upon the monument of Dossennus: Stranger stand
still, to go do not proceed,
But slay, the wisdom of DOSSENNVS read.
Some of our men, although Philosophy were the study of virtue, and this were
sought for, and that did seek, have notwithstanding thought, that those might
not be severed. For neither Philosophy is without virtue, nor virtue without
Philosophy. Philosophy is a study of virtue, but by virtue it self: but
neither can virtue be without the study of it self, nor the study of virtue
be without it self. For not as in these who endeavor to strike any thing from
a far off, in one place is he that strikes, in another that which is
stricken: nor as journies which lead unto Cities, be without them. By virtue
we come unto it. Therefore Philosophy and virtue do cleave together betwixt
themselves. Both the greatest and most authors have said, that there be three
parts of Philosophy; namely, Moral, Natural, and Reasonable. The first
composeth the mind, the second searches the nature of things, the third
exacteth the proprieties of words, and their frame, and manner of reasoning,
that false things may not creep in for that which is true. But there be found,
who likewise would divide Philosophy into fewer things, and who would diu^de
it into more. Some of the Aristotelians have added a fourth part, namely, Civil
skill, because it desires a certain proper exercise, and is occupied about
another matter. Certain have added a part unto these, which the Grecians call
(...), the knowledge of governing a family. Some also have separated a place
for the kinds of life. But is not any part of these, which is not found in
that Moral part. The Epicur^ans have supposed, that there be two parts of
Philosophy, Natural and Moral. The reasoning part they have removed away.
Then when they were constrained with the things themselves to separate
doubtful things, to reprove false things lying hid under the show of that
which is true, themselves also brought in a place, which they call Concerning
judgment and rule, it being called Reasonable after another name: but they
suppose that place to be an augmentation of a Natural part. The Cyrenians
took natural things away together with the reasonable, and were content with
Moral: but these also, who remove them away, do bring them in another way.
For they divide Moral things into five parts: that one part is of things to
be desired and to be fled from, another of the affections, a third of the
actions, a fourth of the causes, a fifth of the arguments. Causes of things are
from the natural part, arguments from the reasonable, actions from the Moral.
Aristo Chius not only said, that the natural and reasonable were superfluous,
but also contrary, he also clipped Moral Philosophy round about, which he
had left alone. For he took away that place, which contains admonitions,
and said, it appertained to a Tutor, and not to a Philosopher or a lover of
Wisdom: as though that a wiseman is any thing else, then a Tutor of
mankind. Therefore since Philosophy or the love of Wisdom is three-folde,
let us first begin to dispose the Moral part thereof, or that which orders
the manners of men. Which it pleases again to be divided into three: that the
first might be a contemplation distributing his own to every man, and
esteeming how much every thing is worthy of; this part is most profitable; for
what is so necessary as to set prices upon things? The second part is of
endeavor, the third of actions. For the first is, that thou judge of how great
worth every thing may be: the second, that thou take an ordered and temperate
affection to these things: the third, that there may be an agreement betwixt
thine endeavor and action, that in all these things thou may agree with thy
self. Whatsoever of these three shall be wanting, it also troubles the rest.
For what profits it, to have all things judged of within, if thou be too much
in eagerness? What profits it to have repressed eagerness, and to have
desires in thine own power, if in the very action of things thou be ignorant
of times, and know not when, and where, and how every thing ought to be
done? For it is one thing to have known the worth and prices of things;
another, the oportunities; another to refrain eagerness, and to go, not to
rush to the doing of things. Therefore then is life agreeable to it self, when
action has not forsaken eagerness. Eagerness is conceived from the worth of
every thing, therefore it is remiss or more fierce, according as that thing is
worthy to be sought for. The part of Philosophy which teaches concerning the
nature of things is cut into two; things that have bodies, or into those that
be without bodies. Both are divided (as I may so speak) into their own
degrees. The place of bodies into these first, namely into those things which
make, and those things which are begotten of these: but the elements are
begotten. The very place of an element (as some suppose) is simple, or without
any mixture at all; as othersome think, it is divided into a matter, and into
a cause moving all things, and into the elements. It remains that we divide
the reasonable part of Philosophy. Every speech is either continued or
divided betwixt him that answ^reth and asks. It has pleased that the one
should be called Dialecticke, or the Art of Logic, the other Rhetoric,
This cares for words, and sense, and order. Dialecticke is divided into two
parts; into words and significations: that is, i^to things which are spoken of,
and into words, wherewith they are spoken. Then there follows an huge
division of them both: therefore I will make an end in this place. I only will
relate
Of things their chiefest s^ate.
Otherwise, if I would make parts of parts, there will be made a book of
questions. I scarre thee not, O Lucilius, the best amongst men, from reading
these things, so that whatsoever thou shall read, thou do presently refer
it unto manners. Bridle thou those, stir up that which languisheth in th^e,
bind that which is loose, tame that which is stubborn, and vex thy public
desires as much as thou canst^ and these saying, How long the same things?
Answer, I ought to say, How long will ye the same offend? Ye will have the
remedies to cease before the vices. But I so much the rather will speak, and
because ye refuse, I will go on. Then begins Physic to profit, when
touching causes grief in a troubled body. I will also speak those things
which shall profit the unwilling. Sometime not some flattering voice shall
come unto you: and because each of you will not hear the truth, hear it in
public. How far will ye propagate the limits of your possessions? The
ground is narrow for one Master, which received a people. How far will ye
stretch out your tillage, not being contented indeed with sowing of Provinces,
to limit a measure of your Farms. The runnings of famous ^louds thorough the
ground of private men, and great Rivers, and the bounds of great Nations, from
the Fountain unto the mouth, be yours. This also is too little, except ye
have compassed Seas with your large possessions: except your Bayliffe reign
beyond the Hadrian, and Ionian, and AEgaean Sea, except Islands, the houses of
great Captains, be numbered amongst the basest things. Possess ye so largely
as ye will; let that be private ground, which sometimes was an Empire: make
yours whatsoever ye can, so that more belongs to another man. Now I talk
with you, whose riotousnesse is alike spaciously spread abroad, as the
covetousness of those is. I will tell you; How long shall be no water-lake,
over which the height of your Villages may not hang? No stream, whose banks
your buildings may not cover about? Wheresoever veins of warm water shall
spring up, there new lodgings of riot shall be builded. Wheresoever the shore
shall bend crookedly into some creek, ye presently will lay foundations; not
being contented with ground, except ye force with hand, to drive the Sea
farther in. Although your houses gli^^er in all places, somewhere being set
upon Mountains, for the vast prospect both of Land and Sea: somewhere being
reared up from the plain ground to the height of Mountains; when ye have
builded many, when ye have builded huge things, ye are notwithstanding but
several and small bodies. What do many chambers pro^ite, ye lie but in one.
It is not yours, wheresoever ye are not. Then I pass to you, whose deep and
insatiable throa^e, on the one side searches Seas, on the other side searches
Lands. Through great labor he follows after some creatures with hooks,
some with snares, some with diverse kinds of Nets: no living creatu^es have
peace, except it be by loathing and detesting them. For how little of these
bankets, which ye prepare through so many hands, do ye taste of with a mouth
wearied with pleasures? How little of this wild beast, taken with danger, does
the master with a raw and loathing stomach taste of? How little of so many
shel-fish brought from so far, slideth down by this insatiable stomach?
Unhappy also ye are, because ye understand not, that ye have a greater
hunger^ then a belly. Tell these things to other men, so that whilst thou
tellest them, thou may hear them thy self. Write, so that when thou have
written, thou read, and refer all to the manners, and to the asswaging of the
outrage of affections. Study, not to know any thing more, but better to know
things.

EPIST. XC.
The praise of Philosophy, it has formed life, it has framed societies and
Empires, it has given laws and equity. Also whether Arts be profitable to
life, as working with the hammer, working in Marble, in metals, on clothes,
and such like? Himself denies it, against POSIDONIVS, and says, that these
things are inferior to the majesty thereof, and that many of these be
super^luous. It manageth, and has managed the affairs, not of the body, but
of the mind. Also whether wisemen were in the rude age? No, but those that
were like to wisemen, by the benefit not of learning, but of nature. There are
many good things amongst these, and fruitful for knowledge, and for life.

WHo can doubt, my Lucilius, but that it is the gift of the immortal gods,
that we liue^ but of Philosophy, that we live well? Therefore by so much that
we owe more to it, then to the gods, by how much more a good life is a greater
benefit, then life? For certain it should be due, except the gods had given
Philosophy it self: the knowledge whereof they have given to none, but the
ability to all. For if they also had made this a common good, we likewise
should be borne wise: wisdom had lost that which is the best therein, that it
is not amongst casual things. For now this is precious and magnificent in
that, that it comes not by chance, that every man owes that unto himself,
that it is not sought for from another man. What should thou have, to admire
in Philosophy, if it had been a thing coming by gift? One work of this is,
to find forth the truth concerning divine and humane things: Justice,
Godliness, Religion, and all the other train of virtues united and agreeing
amongst themselves, never do depart from this. This has taught to honor divine
things, to love humane things, and that government is in power of the gods, and
that society is to be amongst men: which sometime remained inviolable, before
covetousness distracted society, and was a cause of poverty even unto them
whom it has made rich. For they have ceased to possess all things, whilst
they would have them to be their own. But the first men, and who were begotten
of these without corruption, followed nature, and had the same, both for a
Captain and law, according to the judgment of him that was better. For it is
the part of Nature to submit worser things to the better. For either the
greatest or the most vigorous bodies do indeed rule over the dumb flocks. A
base Bull goes not before, but he who has overcome other males in greatness,
and in strength of limbs: the highest of Elephants leads the flock: amongst
men for chiefest is he accounted who is the best. Therefore a Governor was
chosen by the mind: and so it was the chiefest happiness of the Nations;
amongst whom one could not be more mighty, except he were better. For he is
able to do so much as he will, who thinks that he cannot do, save that
which he ought. Posidonius therefore does judge, that rule was in the power of
wisemen, in that which is called the golden age. These contained their hands,
and defended the weaker from those that were more strong: they persuaded and
dissuaded, and showed both profitable and unprofitable things. The wisdom of
these men provided that nothing might be wanting unto theirs, their fortitude
kept dangers back, their bounty increased, and adorned those that were
subject unto them. It was not a Kingdom to rule over other men, but an office.
No man tried how much he was able to do against them, through whom he had
begun to be able to do. Neither was there either mind or cause to injury any
one, when there was good obedience to him who governed well, and a King could
threaten nothing besides, to those who did badly obey, then that they should
depart out of his Kingdom. But after that, vices creeping up, Kingdoms were
turned into tyranny: there began to be need of laws, the which were made by
wise men at their beginning. Solon who founded Athens with equal right:
amongst the seven noted for wisdom in his age. If the same age had brought
forth Lycorgus, he had been in that holy number accounted the eight. The laws
of Zaleucus and of Charondas are praised; these learned not right at the Bar,
nor at Counselors doors, but in that secret and holy solitary place of
Pythagaras, which they gave to Sicily, which flourished then, and to Greece in
Italy. Hitherto I agree to Posidonius: that Arts were invented by Philosophy,
which Arts life uses in continual practice: I will not grant; neither that
glory which is adjoined to building. That, says he, taught those who were
scattered up and down, and covered with a cottage, or with some rock, under
which they dug, or with the trunk of an hollow tree, to devise houses for
them. But I judge Philosophy, no more to have invented these frames of one
house arising upon another, and pressing down Cities, then the ponds of fishes
shut herein, to the end that the throat might not undergo perils of tempests,
and although that the sea were exc^^dingly rough, yet that riot might have her
havens, wherein she might fatten several sorts of fish. What say thou? has
Philosophy taught men to have a lock and key? and what else was it, then to
give a sign to covetousness? Has Philosophy with so great peril of the
inhabitants, hung up these tops of houses that hang over us? For it was too
little to be covered by those things which by hap did befall unto us, and
without difficulty and art to find out some receptacle for our selves.
Believe that age was happy, which was before builders of houses were. These
things were borne when riot began to be, to h^w wood into a four square, and
with an instrument of iron cutting it, as it is marked out, and to polish a
beam with a certain hand. Our forefathers with wedges claue
Such wood as they then cut would have.
For houses were not prepared for a supper, which could encertaine the people:
neither for this use were Pine or Fir-trees carried upon a long row of carts,
the streets trembling thereat, whilst from that tree, roofes being loaded with
gold did hang. Forkes vnder-propped a cottage hanging down upon both sides:
thick dead boughs and leaves being heaped together, and set a side-long,
caused rain although it were great to run of. They being secure, dwelled
under these houses. Thatch covered freemen, bondage enhabiteth under marble
and gold. In that also I disagree from Posidonius, because he judges that
working-tooles were devised by wisemen. For after this manner he might say,
that they were wise, by whom Devised it was the wild with net and gin
To take; with dogs great fields to compass in.
For the craft of men, not wisdom has devised all these things. In this thing
also I disagree, that they were wisemen, who invented the metals of iron and
brass: when the burned ground through the firing of woods had powered forth the
veins that did lie above. Such men invent these things, as honor them. This
indeed seems not so subtle a question to me, as it seems to Posidonius:
whether the hammer or the pinsers began to be used first. One of an exercised,
sharp, of no great, nor high wit found them both forth, and every thing
besides which is to be sought for with a bended body, and with a mind looking
toward the earth. A wiseman has been easy to feed. What else? since even
also in this age, he desires to be most soon provided. How I pray thee
agrees it, that thou admire both Diogenes and Daedalus? Whether of these
seems unto thee to be wise, he that invented the saw: or he who seeing a boy
drinking water in his hollow hand, presently brake a cup taken out of his
bag, thus reproving himself: How long have I, foolish man, had superfluous
burdens? Who foulded himself double in a Tub, and did lie therein? At this
day whether think thou him the wiser man, who has found forth, how out of
secret pipes he may cast forth Saffron up to a great height; who with a sudden
force of water fills and dries little seas; who so coucheth together the
changeable roofes of supping Parlors, that one fashion after another may
presently succeed, and so often the roof may be changed as the dishes
themselves: or him, who shows this both to himself, and to other men, that
Nature has commanded no hard or difficult thing unto us? That we may dwell
without a cutter of marble, that we may be clothed without traffic with the
Serians, that we may have necessary things for our uses, if we shall be
content with these things, which the earth has laid in the highest part
thereof? Whom if mankind would hear, they should know that a Cook were as
super^^uous as a Soldier. They were wisemen, or for certain, like unto
wisemen, to the bodies of whom there was a speedy fence. Necessary things
cost but a simple care: men labor for delights. Thou will not desire
worke-men, if thou follow nature. It would not have us to be entangled, it
has furnished us, unto whatsoever things it has constrained us. Cold is
intolerable for a naked body. What therefore? What, cannot the skins of wild
beasts, and of other creatures, enough and abundantly defend us from cold? Do
not many Nations cover their bodies with barks of trees? Are not the feathers
of birds sewed together for the use of apparel? And are not at this day a
great part of the Scythians covered with the skins of Foxes and of Mise, which
be so^t, and not to be pierced through by the winds? Notwithstanding there is
need of a thicker shade, to drive back the heat of the Summer Sun. What
therefore, has not Antiquity hidden many places, which either by injury of
time, or by some other chance being made hollow, have retired into the form of
a den? What therefore? have they not with their hands wo^en an hurdle of twigs,
and plastered it with base clay, then have they not covered the top thereof
with stubble, and with other things fetched out of the wood, and whilst rain
has slidden down by the caves thereof, have they not in security spent the
Winter? What therefore? do not the Syrtick Nations lie in a place dug out
of the ground? who because of the too great heat of the Sun, have no
covering sufficient enough for the repelling of the heat, but the very dry
ground it self? Nature was not so much an enemy, that seeing she gave an
easy passage of life to all other creatures besides, man alone should not live
without so many Arts. None of these things is by it commanded unto us, nothing
is to be sought for with labor to prolong our life. We be borne to prepared
things: we have made all things difficult unto us by disdain of easy things.
Houses and clothes and nourishments of bodies and meats, and those things
which be now made a great business were easy to come by, and freely gotten,
and prepared with a light labor: for the measure of all things was as
necessity required; we have made these things precious, we have made them
marvelous, we have made them to be sought for with great and with many Arts.
Nature suffices to that, which it requires. Riot has revolted from nature,
which continually inciteth it self, and increases in so many ages, and
helps vices with wit. First it began to desire superfluous, then contrary
things, last of all it sold the mind to the body, and commanded it to serve
the lust thereof. All these Arts, wherewith the City is continually set on
work, or makes such a stir, do^ manage the affairs of the body: to which
all things were once performed as to a servant, but now are provided as for a
Lord. Therefore hence be the shops of weauers, hence of hammer-men, hence of
those that sees perfumes, hence of those that teach effeminate motions of the
body, and effeminate and wanton songs. For that natural mean has retired
back, which finished desires with necessary help: now is it clownishnesse
and misery to be willing to have so much as does suffice. It is incredible^ my
Lucilius, how easily sweetness of speech can draw from the truth, even those
that be great men. Behold Posidonius, as mine opinion is, one of those who have
added much to Philosophy, whilst first of all he will describe how some
threeds may be ^ard spunne, and how some may be drawn from the soft and
loosened tow: then how a web of cloth extends the yarne with weights hung
thereon, how the woofe is wouen in to mollify the hardness of the cloth^
pressing it together on both sides, and how the broad places may be constrained
to come, and to be joined together: he also said, that the Weauers Art was
invented by wisemen, forgetting this most subtle kind, which was afterward
found out, wherein The web is joined to beam, a small s^icke does divide
They yarne, the middle woo^es with shittle slide,
Which teeth in stay of Weauers loome fast put,
With their broad comb the wouen yarne do cut.
But if it had happened unto him to see the webs of our time, of which apparel
is made that will not cover, wherein I will not say, that there is no help to
the bodie^ but that there is no help for shame? Then he passes to husbandmen,
and no less eloquently describes how the ground is plowed up, and tilled
again, to the end that the earth may more easily lie open to the roots, then
he describes the seed that is sown, and weeds picked out by the hand, lest
some casual and wild thing may increase under it, to kill the corn. This
also, says he, that it is the work of wisemen; as though that now also
tillers of ground did not find out very many new things, whereby fertility
might be increased. Then not contented with these Arts, sends a wiseman
down into the handmill; for he declares how imitating the nature of things,
men began to make bread. The hardness of the teeth meeting together, one
with another, breaks, says he, the corn that is received into the mouth,
and whatsoever falls from them, is brought again by the tongue unto the same
teeth: then is it mingled with spittle, that more easily it might pass through
the slipperie jaws; but when it comes into the belly, it is concocted with
the heat of the stomach, then at length comes it to the body. Some
following this example, laid one rough stone upon another, in likeness of the
teeth, of which the immovable part expects the motion of the other: then the
grains are broken by the grinding of them both, and more are they turned back
again, until being ground they be brought unto meal: then sprinkled he
flower with water, and mixed it with continual kneading, and made bread
thereof; which first of all warm ashes and an hot stone did bake: afterward
by little and little were Ouens found forth, and other means, whose heat
might serve, according to the pleasure of men. There wanted not much, but that
he said, the Shoomakers craft to be, also found forth by wisemen. Reason
indeed, but not right reason has invented all these things. These are
inventions of a man, not of a wiseman: so verily indeed as ships, by which we
pass over Rivers, and by which we pass over Seas, sails being fitted for the
receiving of the force of winds, and a stern being added to the end of the
poope, which hither and thither might enforce the course of the ship: and an
example is drawn from fishes, who be stered by the tail, and with the small
force thereof do bend their swiftness into either side. All these things
indeed, says he, did a wiseman find forth, but being lesser then that
himself might handle them, he gave them to more base servants; yet they were
invented by none other, then by such as at this day take charge of them. We
know that certain things have at length comne forth in our memory; as the use
of windows made of stone, sending clear light through them, by reason of a
slate that the light shines thorow^ as the hanging up of bathes, and pipes
pressed into the walls, by which heat might be dispersed all about, which
should alike cherish at one time, both those things that be below, and those
that be above. What shall I speak of Marbles, wherewith Temples, wherewith
houses do shine? What of heaps of stone, fashioned to be round and smooth,
whereof we make galleries and houses capable to receive whole peoples? What of
the notes of words, whereby speedy speech is taken, and the hand follows the
swiftness of the tongue? These are the devices of the most vile slaves:
wisdom sits more deep, neither teaches it the hands, it is a mistress
of minds. Will thou know what thing that has found forth, or what it has
made? Not unseemly motions of the body, nor variable singings by the Trumpet
and Flute, by which breath being received, either in the going forth, or in the
passing through, is formed into voice: nor weapons, nor walls, nor warr^s; it
endeavors profitable things, it favors peace, and calls all mankind to
an agreement. It is not, I say, an artificer of instruments for necessary
uses. Why assignest thou so small things unto it? Thou see a framer of thy
life. It has other Arts indeed under rule: for he that has life, the
ornaments of life do also serve unto him. But he tends to a blessed estate,
to that he leads, to that he opens the way. He shows what be, and what
seem to be evil things. He puts vanity out of the mind. He gives solid
greatness: but he represseth that which is puffed up, and beautiful to be
seen, through that which is vain: neither suffers he to be unknown, what
difference there is betwixt great and swelling things; he delivers the
knowledge of all nature, and of his own. He declares what the gods, and of
what manner they be; what be the infernal, what the household and the genies
be: what be those everlasting souls, having the second nature of deities,
where they abide, what they do, what they can, what they will. This is the
initiation of him, whereby not a private hallowed place, but the huge Temple of
all the gods, even this world is laid open: whose true images, and true
representations he has brought forth to be seen in the souls of men: for the
sight is dull unto so great sights. Then it returns to the beginning of
things, and to eternal reason infused into the whole, and to the force of all
seeds properly figuring every thing. Then he begins to enquire of the
mind, whence it was, where, how long, and in how many parts it is divided.
Then from corporal he has translated himself to incorporall things, and
has examined the truth, and the arguments of them: after these, how the doubts
of life and of death should be discerned. A wiseman withdraws not himself,
I say, as it seems to Posidonius, from these Arts, but not at all comes he
unto them. For he had judged nothing worthy of invention, which he would not
judge worthy of perpetual use. He would not take up things to be laid down.
Anacharsis, says he, found out the Potters-wheele by the turning whereof
vessels be fashioned. Then because that the Potters wheel is found in Homer,
he had rather that the verses should seem to be false, then a fable. I do not
contend, that Anacharsis was the author of this thing: and if he was, a
wiseman indeed invented it, but not as being a wiseman: as wisemen do many
things, as they be men, not as they be wisemen. Suppose that a wiseman is
exceeding swift, he will excel all in running, as he is swift, not as he is
wise. I would desire to show some glasse-maker to Posidonius, who with breath
fashioneth glass into many forms, which would scarce be framed by a diligent
hand. These things are found out, since we have ceased to find out a
wiseman. Democritus himself is said to have found out the Arch of stone, that
the bending of stones by little and little declining on one side, might be
fastened to a stone in the midst. I say, that this is false. For it is
needful that before Democritus, both bridges and gates were, whose tops for
the most part are crooked. Furthermore, ye have forgotten, how the same
Democritus found out, how Iuory should be polished, how a well purged stone
should be turned into Emrold, by which purging even at this day, stones
profitable in this kind being found out, are colored. Although that a wiseman
has found out these things, yet found he not them out, as he is a wiseman:
for he does many things, which we see as well to be done, even by those that
are most unwise, but either more skilfully or more practically. Seek thou
what a wiseman has found out^ what he has brought forth into light? First
the nature of things, which he has looked upon, as other living creatures have
done, with eyes slow to divine things. Then the law of life, which he has
directed according to all things: neither only has he taught to know, but to
follow the gods, and to receive accidents no otherwise then commands. He has
forbidden to obey false opinions, and he has weighed with true estimation, of
how great worth every thing was: he has condemned pleasures mixed with
repentance. And has praised good things which will always please, and has
made apparent, that he is the happiest man, who has no need of happiness:
that he is the most mighty man who has power over himself. I speak not of
that Philosophy, which has placed a Citizen out of his country, gods out of
the world, which has given ver^ue to pleasure: but concerning that, which
supposes that there is no good thing, save that which is honest, which cannot
be molli^ied neither by the gifts of man, nor of Fourtune; the price of whom is
this, not to be able to be taken with any price. I do not suppose that this
Philosophy was in that rude age, wherein as yet workmanship was wanting, and
they learned profitable things by use it self: as before those fortunate
times, when benefits of Nature did lie to be used in common, before
covetousness and riot had severed mortal men, and that by consort they ran
out to spoil, they were not wisemen, although they did things to be done by
those that are wise. Certainly not any one shall more admire any other estate;
neither if God permitted him to fashion earthly things, and to give manners to
the Nations, shall allow any other thing, then that which is remembered to have
been amongst them, with whom The ground then none did plow, none might divide
Land that to him alone might then betide.
The earth it self in common all did lie;
No toiling was, but things to grow did hie.
What was more happy then that kind of men? They enjoyed the nature of things
in common: that sufficed to be a parent for the defense of all: this was the
secure possession of public wealth. Why have I not said that, that kind of
mortal men was the richest of all, wherein thou could not find one that
was poor? Couetousnes^e brake into things that were settled exceeding well: and
whilst it desired to take somewhat apart, and to turn it to the use of it
self, it has made all things other men's, and from being unmeasurable, has
brought them into a strait, and has brought in poverty, and by coveting many
things, has lost all things. Therefore although it should now convert and
repair that which it has lost; although it should add fields unto fields,
and drive out neighbors from their lands, either by price, or wrong; although
it should enlarge grounds to be as big as provinces; and call a long
wandering through their own, a possession: yet no enlarging of limits shall
bring us thither, whence we have departed. When we have done all, we shall have
much; whereas we had all. The earth it self was more fertile without labor,
and was large for the use of the people who robbed it not. Whatsoever Nature
had brought forth, it was a pleasure no less to have found it out, then to
show the invention to another: neither could there be either too much or too
little to any one: it was divided amongst those that did agree. As yet the
stronger had not laid hand upon the weaker, as yet a covetous man did not by
hiding that which did lie up for him, also exclude another from necessary
things. There was the like care of another, and of a man's own self. Weapons
did cease, and hands were not tainted with humane blood; they turned all their
hatred upon beasts. They whom some thick wood had covered from the Sun, who
lived safe under leaves in a base cottage, against the rigor of Winter or of
rain, passed over pleasant nights, without sighing. Carfulness, tosseth us
in our purple and stirs us up with most sharp pricks; the hard ground gave
soft sleep unto them. Carved roofes did not hang over them, but they lying in
the open air, the stars did slide over them, and the notable spectacle of
the nights, the world was driven on apace, leading so great a work with
silence: as well by day, as by night, the prospect of this most beautiful
house did lie open: one might behold the signs, declining from the middle part
of heaven, and again some arising from their hidden place. How could it not
but delight to wander amongst miracles that be so largely spread abroad? But
ye be afraid of every sound of the houses, and if any thing make a noise
amongst your pictures, ye flee away astonished. They had not houses like
Cities. The air and wind was free in open places, and the light shade of a
rock or of a tree, and very clear fountains, and rivers not made stale by
any work, nor by a conduit, nor by any constrained course, but running of
their own accord, and meadows beautiful without art, amongst these things
there is country little houses, reared up by a rusticall hand. This house was
according to Nature, wherein one might be lawful to dwell, neither fearing it,
nor for it; now houses be a great part of our fear. But although a notable,
and a life wanting deceit was unto them, yet were they not wisemen, since now
this is a name in greatest work. Notwithstanding I deny not that they were men
of an high spirit, and freshly sprung from the gods: for the world being not as
yet wasted in strength sent forth better things. But as wit was more valiant in
all, and more prepared for labors; so wits were not consummated in all things.
For Nature gives not virtue; it is a skill to be made good. They indeed did
not seek for gold, nor silver, nor glistering stones shining amongst the
lowest dregs of the earth, yea as yet they even spared dumb creatures: so
far was it off, that a man not angry should kill a man not fearing; only
coming to see him, should kill any one. Not as yet any one had garnished
apparel, as yet gold was not wouen in; as yet it was not delued out. What
therefore? they were innocent in ignorance of things: but there is much
difference, whether one will not, or know not to sin. Justice was wanting to
them, wisdom was wanting, temperance and fortitude was wanting. A rude life
had certain things like unto all these virtues: virtue befalls not but to a
mind instructed and taught, and brought to the highest by continual exercise.
Furthermore, indeed we are borne to this, but without this: and also in the
best, before thou instruct, there is matter of virtue, not virtue it self.

The doleful and sudden burning of the Colony at Lions: by casting in of that,
we are to think of sudden things, and which may fall forth to a man. He
sets before our eyes the uncertainty and variableness of things: the
greatest and most firm things may be diminished, changed, withdrawn, by
earthquake, waters and fire. All mortal things are condemned to perish.
Therefore neither death nor infamy is to be feared by a man.

OUR Liberalis is now sad, the fire, wherewith the Colony at Lions was burned
up, being related unto him. This accident might move any man, much more one who
loves his country exceeding much. Which thing causes to seek out the
resolution of ones mind, namely, which he has exercised, for those things
which he supposed might be feared: but I wonder not, if this so unthought of
mischief, and almost unheard of has not been without fear, since it was
without example. For fire has vexed many Cities, it has destroyed none. For
also where fire is set upon houses by the enemies hand, it fails in many
places: and although forthwith it be raised up again, notwithstanding seldom
does it so devour all, that nothing be left to the sword. Scarce also at any
time has there been so grievous and so pernicious an earthquake, as to
overthrow whole Towns. Lastly, never has there any where been so terrible a
fire, that nothing remained to another burning. One night has laid along so
many most fair works, every one of which might have made several Cities to
have been famous; and it falls forth in so great peace, as could not indeed
be feared in war. Who can believe this? that arms being quiet every where,
when security is spread abroad throughout the whole earth, Lions that was
pointed at in Gaul, is sought for. Fortune has permitted all, whom publicly
it has afflicted, to fear that which they were to suffer: no great thing but
has had some space of the ruin thereof. In this there was only one night
between a great City and none at all. To conclude, I am longer in telling
thee that it has perished, then it was in perishing. O Liberalis, all these
things incline our affection to be firm and undaunted against the evils
thereof. Neither is it stricken without a cause. Unexpected things do aggrauate
the more: novelty adds weight to miseries: neither any man but has the more
grieved at that thing which he has admired. Therefore nothing ought to be
unprovided for by us: the mind is to be sent before unto all things: and we
must think, not whatsoever is accustomed, but whatsoever may be done. For what
is it, that fortune cannot when she will, take away even from the most
flourishing? which he cannot by so much the more assault and shake, by how much
it shines the more beautifully, What is hard, or what is difficult unto her?
Not always one way, nor all of her runs upon us. Sometimes she calls for
our own hands upon us, sometimes contented with her own strength, she
finds forth dangers without an author. No time is expected, in pleasures
themselves causes of dolor do arise. War arises in the midst of peace,
and the helps of security pass over into fear. He is an enemy from a
friend, a foe from a fellow. The calmes of summer is driven into sudden
tempests and those which be greater the winter storms. Without an enemy we
suffer hostile things; and too great felicity has found forth causes of
slaughter unto it self, if other things fail. Diseases set upon the most
temperate, the consumption upon the strongest, punishment upon the most
innocent, tumult upon the most secret. Chance chooses some new thing, by which
as it were forgetting, she renews her own strength. Whatsoever long
continuance of many labors, and much favor of God has builded up, one day
scatters and dissipateth it. He gave long delay to evils hasting on, who has
said that a day, an hour and a moment of time suffices for the overthrowing
of Empires. There were some comfort to our weakness, and to our affairs, if
all things were repaired with so great speed as they be finished by. Now
increasings go softly, but they make have to loss: nothing in private,
nothing in public is firm: as well the destinies of men as of Cities are
turned about. Fear nearly attends the choysest pleasure; and although there
are no occasions of troubles outwardly, mischiefs break forth from such
places where they were least expected. These Kingdoms which stood both in
civil and foreign wars, are ruined without any opposition. What
Commonwealth could support her felicity? Al things therefore are to be thought
upon, and the mind is to be confirmed against those things that may happen.
Think upon exiles, torments, wars, sickenesses and shipwrackes. Fortune may
bereave thee of thy country, and thy country of thee: she can cast thee into
a desert, she can make that place desolate, wherein the people is almost
stifled with thronging. Let the whole condition of man's life be set before our
eyes, and let us consider in our minds (if we would not be oppressed, neither
stupefied with any unusual miseries, as if they were new) not how much
happens oftentimes, but how much may for the most part fall out. We must
wholly apprehend the inconstancy of the affairs of this world. How often have
the Cities of Asia and Achaia bin ruinated by one earthquake? How many Cities
in Syria, and how much has the earth devoured in Macedon? How often has this
misery afflicted Cyprus? how often has Paphos been buried in her own
ruins? Oftentimes have we heard news of the destructions of whole Cities,
and we amongst whom these rumors are ordinarily spread; how small a part are
we of all things? Let us therefore erect our selves against adversities, and
whatsoever thing may happen, let us know that it is not so great as is
reported. A rich City, the ornament of all those Provinces, into the which it
was inserted and received by them, being built upon a hill, and that not
ouer-high is burned. And time also shall consume the very foundations of all
these Cities, which now thou hear praised for their magnficence and riches.
See thou not how in Achaia the foundations of famous Cities are consumed? and
that nothing is extant whereby it may be known that in times past they have
been. Not only those things which are framed by hand do perish. Not only
such things as man's Art and industry has planted does time ouerturne, but the
mountain tops moulder, and whole regions are come to naught. Those places are
covered with the sea that stood far off from the sight of the same. The fire
has consumed the Mountains from the hollow whereof it flamed out. And in times
past has eaten away the highest Promontories which were a sollace to Sailers,
and brought the proudest hills to humble shoars. The very works of nature are
vexed, and therefore ought we to suffer patiently the destruction of Cities.
All things that stand must fall, and an end remains to all things: whether
the winds shut in by an internal force and blast have shaken of the weight
under which they be held; or the force of floods in secret, has thrown down
those things that stand against them; or the violence of flames has broken the
joining together of the ground; or oldnesse, from which nothing is safe, has
by little and little overcome them: or the vnwholesomnesse of the sky has
cast out people, and situation has corrupted deserts. It is a long thing to
reckon up all the ways of the destinies. This one thing I know, that all the
works of mortal men are condemned by mortality. We live amongst those things
that perish. These and such like comforts I apply to our Liberalis, he being
set on fire with a certain burning love to his country; which peradventure is
consumed, that it might be the better builded up. Oftentimes injury has made
place to greater fortune. Many things have fallen that they might rise higher
and greater. Timagines an enemy to the prosperity of the City, did say, that
he grieved at the firing of Rome for this one things because he knew that
better would rise again, then had been burned. In this City also it is very
like, that all will strive, that greater and more certain things may be
restored then they have lost. I wish that they may be more longlasting and
builded with better signs of luck for a longer age to come. For the hundredth
year is scarce to this Colonie from the beginning thereof, an age scarce long
enough for a man. It being lead forth into this frequencie, waxed well again
with the opportunity of the place: which notwithstanding has suffered most
grievous chances within the space of the old age of a man. Therefore let the
mind be framed to understanding, and to patience of her lot, and let her know,
that there is nothing which fortune dare not do. That she has the same right
against Empires, which she has against those that do rule: that she can do
the same against Cities, that she does against men. None of these things is to
be fretted at. We have entered into that world, wherein men live by these laws.
Pleases it? Obey. Pleases it not? Depart which way thou will. Be angry, if any
thing be foolishly, unjustly resolved upon by thy self. But if this necessity
tyeth the highest and lowest, therefore return into favor with de^tiny, by
which all things are dissolved. There is no cause that thou measure us with
Tombs, and with these Monuments, which being of unequal bigness, do
compass the way about. The dust makes all equal. We are borne unlike, we die
alike. The same I say of Cities, that of the inhabitants of Cities. As well
was Ardea taken, as Rome. That maker of mankind has not distinguished us by
birth, nor by famousnesse of names, no longer then we be. But when we come to
the end of mortal things: O ambition, says he, depart thou; let there be the
same law to all things which press the earth. We be alike to the suffering of
all things. No man is more frail then another, no man is more certain of his
own until next day. Alexander the King of the Macedonians, began like a
wretch to learn Geometry, that he might know how little the earth was, whereof
he had possessed very little. Thus, I say, like a wretch for this, because he
was to understand that he did bear a false surname. For who can be great in
so small a thing? Those things that were delivered were subtle, and to be
learned by diligent attention: not which that mad man could perceive, who sent
his thoughts beyond the Ocean Sea. Teach me, says he, easy things. To whom
his Master said; These things be the same, and alike difficult unto all. Think
thou that the nature of things says this. These things whereof thou
complainest, they are the same unto all: more easy things can be given unto
none; but whosoever will, shall make those things more easy unto himself.
How? With uprightness of minde^ It is meet both that thou grieve, and thirst,
and be hungry, and wax old, and if longer stay amongst men befall unto thee,
that thou be sick, and lose somewhat and do perish. Notwithstanding there is
no cause that thou may believe these things which make a noise about thee.
None of these things is bad, nothing intolerable or hard. Fear is from
consent unto these things. Thus thou fear death as report. But what is more
foolish then a man fearing words? Our Demetrius is accustomed elegantly to say,
that the speeches of the unskillful are as much esteemed by him, as is the
breaking of wind. For what difference, says he, is there unto me, whether
that these do make a noise from above or from below. How great madness is it
to be affraide, lest thou be discredited by those that have no credit? As ye
have feared fame without cause, so also those things, which ye should never
fear, except fame had commanded it. What shall a good man suffer loss, being
bespotted with unjust reports? Neither indeed let this hurt death in the
judgment of us: for this also endeavors that which is bad. None of them who
accuse it, have tried it. In the mean space it is rashn^sse to condemn that
which thou know not. But thou know that, how profitable to many it is,
how many it freeth from torments, from poverty, from complaints, from
punishments, from tediousness. We are not in the power of any thing, since
death is in our own power.

That reason rules in man, and that all things are to be referred to this, and
that blessed life is in that being perfect. That external things have light or
no weight. Also that pleasure is of no moment, it is the good of unreasonable
creatures. And yet that external things may be assumed, which are according to
nature; but with judgment: and that this then is good in them, to be well
chosen. Nevertheless also without them, that one is blessed, yea most blessed
by virtue alone. These things may befall: yet being added, they do not
increase, nor being taken away do decrease blessedness: against which no time
can do any thing. That we are to be made like to God, and that we go to him.

I Think that thou and I agree of this, that external things are gotten for
the body, and that the body is reverenced for the honor of the mind, that
there be servile parts in the mind, whereby we be moved and nourished,
given unto us for that principal thing. In this principal there is somewhat
that is unreasonable and reasonable. That serves to this. This is one thing,
that is not referred unto any besides: but it carries all things unto it
self. For also that divine reason is set over all things, it self is under
none. And also this of ours is the same, because it is from it. If we agree
amongst our selves concerning this, it follows also that we agree concerning
that, that blessed life is placed in this one thing, that reason may be perfect
in us. For this alone submits not the mind, it stands against Fortune. In
every habit of things, it being preserved, preserves. But that is the only
good, which is never broken off. He, I say, is blessed, whom nothing makes
lesser; he holds the chief, and leans not indeed upon any thing, save upon
himself, For he may fall, who is sustained by the help of another. If it be
otherwise, those things that be not ours shall begin to prevail much in us.
But who shall stand by Fortune, or what wiseman admireth himself for those
things that be others? What is blessed life? security and perpetual
tranquillity. The greatness of the mind will give this, and a firm
constancy of a thing well judged of. But how come we to this? If all verity
be thoroughly looked upon; if an order, manner, comeliness, and an hurtlesse
will, or that which is bountiful, and bent to reason, and never departing from
it, being both lovely, and to be admired, be preserved in the doing of things.
Lastly, that I may briefly write the form unto thee, such ought the mind of
a wiseman to be, as may become a god. What can he desire, to whom all honest
things do befall? For if things that be not honest, can confer any thing to
the best estate, blessed life shall be in those things, without which it is
not. And what is more foolish or more dishonest, then to tie the good of a
reasonable soul unto unreasonable things? Notwithstanding, some judge the
chiefest good to be increased, because it is scarcefull, casual things
resisting it. Antipater also amongst the great Authors of this sect, says,
that himself gives somewhat to external things, but very little. But thou
see what manner of thing it is, not to be contented with daylight, except
some petty fire shined unto us. What moment in this clearenesse of the Sun
can a spark of fire have? If thou art not contented with honesty alone^ it is
needful that thou will have quiet to be added thereunto, which the Grecians
call hesychian, or pleasure. The one of these things howsoever may be received.
For the mind is void of trouble, being free to the beholding of the universe,
and nothing calls it away from the contemplation of Nature. That other thing,
namely, pleasure is the good of a beast. We add an unreasonable thing to that
which is reasonable, a dishonest thing to that which is honest. Does the
tickling of the body cause a happy life? Why therefore doubt ye to say, that a
man is well, if his taste be well? And numbrest thou him, I do not say,
amongst men, but amongst mankind, whose chiefest good consists of tastes,
and colors, and sounds? Let that creature which is borne to eat, only depart
from that most beautiful number of living creatures, and next unto the gods,
and let him be numbered with brute beasts. The unreasonable part of the mind
has two parts: the one courageous, ambitious, unbridled, placed in the
affections: the other base, languishing, given unto pleasures. They have left
that unbridled, but better, certainly more valiant and more worthy a man: and
have thought this feeble and abject to be necessary to a blessed life. They
have commanded reason to serve this, and have made that which is demisse and
ignoble, to be the good of a most generous creature. Furthermore, it is mixed,
and monstrous, and framed of the diverse agreeing members of living creatures.
For as our Virgil says of Sylla: A woman's face and virgins breasts most fair
Until her middle-part: after she bare
Fish-like, a body vast with Dolphines tails,
And many a woluish paunch with her she trailes.
But although that fierce, horrible, and swift living creatures are joined to
this Sylla, yet of what monsters have these men compounded wisdom? The first
part of a man is virtue it self; the brittle and fading flesh, and apt only
to receive meats, as Posidonius says, is committed unto this. That divine
virtue ends in a mutable thing; and a sluggish and decaying living creature
is adjoined to the higher, venerable, and heavenly parts thereof. That rest how
quiet soever gave of it self nothing indeed to the mind, but removed
impediments. Pleasure of it own accord dissolueth and mollifieth all strength.
What so disagreeing conjunction of bodies amongst themselves shall be found? A
most sluggish thing is adjoined to that which is most valiant; scarce serious
things to that which is most severe, even a distemperate and confused thing to
that which is most holy. What therefore, says he, if good health, and quiet,
and a wanting of griefs shall no ways hinder virtue, will thou not seek for
those things? What else but that I should seek? Not because they be good, but
because they be according to nature, and because with good judgment they be
taken by me. What good then shall there be in them? this one, to be chosen
well. For when I take such a garment as is meet, when I walk as is requisite;
when I sup as I ought: not the supper, or walking, or apparel are good things,
but my purpose in these of keeping a mean agreeable unto reason in every
thing. Yea now I will add, the choice of neat apparel is to be desired by a
man. For man is by nature a neat and an elegant living creature. Therefore neat
apparel is not a good thing by it self, but the choice of neat apparel;
because it is not good in the thing, but in the choice: because our actions be
honest, not those things that are acted. That which I have spoken of apparel,
suppose that I have spoken the same concerning the body. For Nature has also
compassed the mind with this, as a certain apparel, it is the clothing
thereof. But who at any time has esteemed his apparel by a chest? A sheath
makes the sword to be neither good nor bad. I also do answer thee the same
concerning the body: I would take indeed, if choice be given, both health and
strength. But my judgment concerning them, and not they themselves, shall be
that which is good. A wiseman is blessed indeed, says he; notwithstanding,
he obtains not that chiefest good, except also that natural instruments be
correspondent unto him. Thus wretched indeed he cannot be, who has virtue: but
he is not most blessed, who is forsaken of natural good things, as of health,
and of soundness of members. Thou grantest that which seems more incredible,
that one is not miserable in the greatest and in continual dolors, yea also
that he is blessed: thou deniest that which is more light, that he is most
blessed. But if virtue can cause that a man be not miserable, it will more
easily cause that he be most blessed. For less distance remains from blessed
to most blessed, then from miserable to blessed. Or what thing prevails so
much, that it may place him amongst the blessed, who is taken from calamities:
can it not add that which remains, to make him most blessed? Fails it in
the highest top? Commodities and discommodities are in life; both are without
us. If a good man be not miserable, although he be pressed with all
discommodities; how is he not most blessed, although he be destitute of some
commodities? For ^u^n as he is not depressed with a burden of discommodities,
to be even a miserable man; so is he not led with want of commodities, from
being a most blessed man. But as well he is most blessed without commodities,
as he is not miserable by discommodities. Cannot his good be taken from him, if
it can be diminished? A little before I said, that a small fire helps not the
light of the Sun. For whatsoever shines without it, is hid with the
clearness thereof. But certain things, says he, do also hinder the Sun.
But the force and the light of the Sun is whole, even amongst opposite
things: and although somewhat may lie between, which may hinder us from the
sight of it, yet is it in work, and is carried in his own course. So often as
it has shined amongst the clouds, it is no less, nor slow indeed, then when
it shines bright, because there is great difference, whether that somewhat do
only stand against or hinder. After the same sort opposite things detract
nothing from virtue. It is not less, but shines less: peradventure it so
appears not, nor shines unto us: it is the same unto it self, and after the
fashion of the obscured Sun, does in secret exercise her force. Therefore
calamities, and losses, and injuries, can do this against virtue, that a small
cloud can do against the Sun. There is found, who says, that a wiseman
having scarce good health, is neither miserable nor blessed. He also is
deceived; for he matcheth casual things with virtues, and gives so much to
honest things, as to things wanting honesty. But what is more filthy, what is
more unworthy, then to compare venerable things with those that are base? For
faith, justice, piety, fortitude, prudence, are venerable things: on the
contrarie^ those be vile, which do befall more full to the most base, namely,
a sound thigh, and arm, and teeth, and the health and strength of these.
Again, if a wise man who has a diseased body, shall be accounted neither
miserable nor blessed, but shall be left in the midst: his life also shall
neither be to be desired nor to be fled from. But what is so absurd, as that
a wise man's life should not be desired? and what is so without credit, as that
there is a life which is not to be desired, or to be fled from? Then if the
losses of the body do not make miserable, they suffer to be blessed. For
they which have not power of translating into a worser estate, have not power
indeed of hindering the best estate. We know, says he, that somewhat is hot,
and somewhat cold: and that lukewarm is betwixt them both. So one is blessed,
and another miserable; another neither miserable nor blessed. I will diligently
search this Image that is set against us. If I shall put more cold into that
lukewarm, it will be made cold: if I shall power on more warm, it shall at
last be made warm. But how much soever I shall add to the miseries of this
man, who is neither miserable nor blessed, he shall not be miserable, as ye
say, therefore this similitude is unlike. Then I deliver to thee a man neither
miserable nor blessed: I add blindness to him, he is not made miserable: I
add weakness, he is not made miserable: I add continual and grievous
dolours, he is not made miserable. Whom so many evils translate not into a
miserable life, they do not indeed lead him from a blessed life. If a
wiseman, as ye say, cannot fall from being blessed, to be miserable, he
cannot fall into not blessed. For why should he, who has begun to slide,
s^ay any where? That thing which suffered him not to be rolled to the bottom,
keeps him in the top. But why cannot a blessed life be undone? indeed it
cannot be lessened; and therefore virtue it self, by it self, is sufficient
unto it. What therefore, says he, is not a wiseman more blessed, who has
lived longer, whom no dolor has called away: then he who oftentimes has
wrastled with bad success? Answer me: Is he not both better and honester?
If these things be not, he is not more blessed indeed. It is meet that he
live more rightly, that he may live more blessedly: if he cannot live more
rightly, he cannot live more blessedly indeed. Virtue is not augmented:
therefore not a blessed life indeed which is from virtue. For virtue is so
great a good thing, that it feels not these small additions, namely,
shortness of life, and dolor, and diverse discommodities of the body. For
pleasure is not worthy, to which it may have respect. What is the chiefest in
virtue? Not to need a future thing, nor to reckon his days. In whatsoever
time ye will, eternal good makes absolutely perfect. These things seem
incredible unto us, and running out above humane nature. For we measure the
majesty thereof by our weakness, and we put the name of virtue upon our
vices. What furthermore, seems it not alike incredible, that one being placed
in greatest torments, should say, I am blessed? But this voice is heard in the
very shop of pleasure: I live, says EPICVRVS, this most blessed and last
day: when on the one side difficulty of making water tormented him, and on the
other side an incurable dolor of an exulcerated belly tormented him. Why
therefore are these things incredible with them, who embrace virtue: since also
they are found amongst them, over whom pleasure rules? These degenerate also
and of a most base mind say, that a wiseman shall not be miserable, nor
blessed, in greatest dolours, in greatest calamities. But this also is
incredible, yea more incredible. For I see not, how virtue being cast from her
own height, how it may not be driven into the lowest. It either ought to make
blessed; or if it be driven from this, it shall not forbid to be made wretched.
He that stands cannot be overcome: it is requisite that either he be
ouercomne, or overcome. Both virtue and blessed life befalls to the immortal
gods alone: a certain shadow and similitude of those good things be unto us. We
come to those things, we attain them not. But reason is common to gods and
men: this is consummated in them, it is consummable in us. But our vices draw
us to despair. For that other second man, as one scarce constant to keep the
best things, whose judgment as yet slideth and is uncertain, desires the
sense of the eyes and of the ears, good health, and no ill-fauoured aspect of
the body, and abiding in his fashion, and furthermore, a longer space of life.
By this he may be busied in things not to be repented of, according as an
imperfect man may. There is a certain force in this badnesse, whereby it
makes the mind prone to bad things: he works wanting badnesse, and that
working is different from that which is good. As yet he is not good, but is
fashioned for good: but whosoever wants any good thing, is bad. If present
virtue and a mind
In any man thou shall forth find;
He matcheth the gods, he strives thither being mindful of his original. No
man does wickedly endeavor to ascend thither, whence he had descended. But what
is it, why thou esteemest not, that there is some divine thing in him, who is a
part of God? All this wherein we are contained, both is one thing, and is God:
and we are the fellows and the members of him. Our mind is capable; it is
carried thither, if vices press it not down. As the shape of our bodies is
lifted up, and looks toward heaven: so the soul, to which so much as it
will, it is lawful to be stretched forth, is fashioned for this by nature, to
will things equal to the gods, and so to use her strength, and to extend her
self into her own space. For if it endeavored to the highest by force of
another, it were great labor, to go into heaven: it returns, when it has
gone this journey, it goes boldly, and is a contemner of all things, neither
has it respect to money: gold and silver are most worthy of that darkness
wherein they have lien, it esteems not this glittering, wherewith they strike
the eyes of the unskillful: it knows that they be dug out of the mud, from
the which our covetousness has separated and dug them up. It knows, I
say, that riches are seated some where else, then where they are heaped up; the
mind, not the chest ought to be filled. One may set this over the rule of all
things, one may bring this into the possession of nature, as being his own.
Let the East and Went be his limit, and let him possess all things after the
manner of the gods; let him from above despise rich men with their riches: of
whom none is so joyful in his own, as sorrowful at another man's. When he
has lifted up himself into this loftiness, he is also not a lover, but a
manager of the body, as of a necessary burden: neither subiecteth he
himself to that, over which he is set. No man is free who serves the body:
for to pass by other masters, whom too great care for it has found forth, the
command of it is austere and delicate. Sometime it departs from this with an
upright mind, sometime it breaks from it with a great mind; neither seeks
it what end there shall be afterward to the remainders thereof. But as we
neglect the hairs tha^ be shaven from the beard; so that divine mind being to
depart out of a man, judges that it no more pertains to himself, how his
receptacle be bestowed, whether the fire burn it up, or the beasts pluck it
asunder, or the earth cover it, no more then the secondines pertain to an
infant newborn. Whether when it is cast out, the birds carry it asunder, or
it be consumed. When cast it is away
To Sea-dogges for a pray,
What is it to him? Who then also whilst he is amongst men, fears no
threats: shall he after death fear any threats of them, whom we scarce ought
to fear until death? The hook, says he, shall not tear me, nor the rending
of my dead carcass cast out to reproach, although loathsome to them that shall
look on. I request no man for a last duty: I commend my relics to no man.
Nature it self has provided that no man should be unburied. Whom cruelty
has cast forth, the day shall bury. Mecaenas says eloquently: I care not for
a Tomb or any Grave,
To bury my remains Nature will crave.
Thou would have thought that one girded like a man had spoken it: for he
had both a great and a manly wit, except he himself effeminately had managed
it.

EPIST. XCIII.
Concerning the death of the Philosopher METRONACTES, who died a young man.
That is of small regard: also life is to be measured, not by space, but by act.
Every good life is that which is long: lastly, nothing here is long.

IN the Epistle wherein thou bewailedst the death of Metronactes the
Philosopher, as though he might and ought to have lived longer, I have desired
thy equity, which is abundant in thee to every person and in every business,
but fails in one thing, wherein it fails all men. I have found many upright
toward men, but none toward the gods. We daily chide destiny: why was he
taken away in the midst of his course? Why is not he snatched away? Why
extends it old age grievous both to himself and to others? Whether I pray
thee, iudgest thou it to be more fit, that thou obey nature, or that nature
obey thee? But what difference is there how speedily thou depart, whence
likewise thou must depart. We must not care to live long, but to live enough.
For there is need of destiny, that thou may live long; that thou may^st
live enough, there is need only of the mind. Life is long if it be full: but
it is filled, when the soul has restored his own good unto himself, and
has translated the power of it self to it self. What do fourscore years
spent in sloth help him? This man lived not, but made an abode in life;
neither lately, but long ago did he die. He lived fourscore years. The
difference is from what day thou accountest his death. But he died young; yet
he performed the duties of a good citizen, of a good friend, of a good son:
he failed in no part: although his age were imperfect, his life was perfect. He
lived fourscore years: yea, rather he was fourscore years; except
p^raduenture thou say him to have lived so, as trees are said to live. I
desire thee my Lucilius, that we endeavor this, that even as precious things,
so our life may not lie much open, but may be worth much. Let us measure it by
the actions, not by time. Will thou know what difference there is between
this courageous man, and contemner of fortune^ who has gone through all the
degrees of humane life, and is promoted unto the highest good, and him over
whom many years have passed? The one is also after death the other perished
before death. Therefore let us praise and place him in the number of the happy,
to whom how little time soever has happened, it is bestowed well. For he has
seen true light, he has not been one of the ordinary sort; he lives, and
has lived, and has flourished. Sometime he has used prosperous success:
sometime, as it comes to pass, the brightness of a strong Planet has
shined through the clouds. Why seek thou, how long he has lived? He lived
even until posterity: he passed away, and gave himself to the memory of ages
to come. Neither therefore have I refused that many years should befall unto
me. But yet will I not say, that any thing has been wanting to a blessed
life, if the space thereof be cut off. For I have not fitted my self unto that
day, which greedy hope has promised to be the last unto me: but I have looked
upon every one as being my last. Why ask thou me, when I was borne? Am I as
yet reckoned amongst those that be more young? I have that which is mine own.
Even as in a lesser habit of body, one may be a perfect man: so in a lesser
measure of time, there may be a perfect life. Age is amongst external things.
So long as I am, it is another time: so long as I am a good man, it is mine
own time. Exact this of me, lest as it were in darkness I measure out an
unnoble age; that I may lead a life, not that I may be carried through it.
Seek thou what is the largest space of life? To live even unto wisdom: He
that comes unto that, has touched, not the longest but the greatest end. But
let him glory, and give thanks unto the gods; and amongst them, let him
impute it to himself, and to the nature of things, that he has been.
Deservedly shall he ascribe it: for he has returned a better life then he
received. He has set down the pattern of a good man: he has showed what an
one and how great he was: if he had added any thing, it had been like unto
that which was past. And notwithstanding how long do we live? We enjoy the
knowledge of all things. We know from what things the principal Nature lifts
up it self on high, how it orders the world, by what courses it recalleth
the year, how it has shut up al things which were at any time, and has made
it self the end of it self. We know that the stars go by their own force:
that nothing but the earth stands still: that other things with a continual
swiftness run on. We know how the Moon passes by the Sun: wherefore
being more slow, she leaves the swifter behind her: how it receives or
loses light: what cause brings on the night, what brings back the day.
Thither must we go, where thou may behold these things nearer unto thee:
neither, says that wiseman, do I the more valiantly depart, because I judge a
way to lie open for me unto the gods. I have deserved indeed to be admitted,
and now have I been amongst them: and I have sent my mind unto that place,
and they have sent theirs unto me. But suppose that I be taken away, and that
nothing of a man remains after death: I have alike as great a mind, although
I depart to pass into no place. He lived not so many years as he might have
done. Also it is a book of a few verses, but to be praised and profitable
indeed: thou know the Chronicle of Tamusius, that it is not fashionable, and
what it is called: alike is the long life of certain men, and that which
follows the Chronicle of Tamusius. What iudgest thou him to be more happy,
who is slain in the last day of the show of Gladiators, then he who is slain
in the midst of the days? What think thou that any one is so desirous of
life, that he had rather have his throat cut in the vntiring house, then on
the Theater? No greater space do we one go before another. Death goes
through all; he that kills, follows him close who is killed. That is the
small^st thing, concerning which men do most carefully deal. But what
pertains it to the purpose how long thou auoydest, that which thou can not
auo^de?

EPIST. XCIIII.
A discourse, whether the Teaching or Exhorting part of Philosophy be more
profitable? and whether the one can suffice without the other? ARISTO
prefers the former, and admits it alone: and his arguments be here. And
other adioyne the other part, and show the great uses thereof; and SENECA
distinguishes finely, wittily, and fruitfully. Read and delight.

SOme have received that part of Philosophy alone, which gives proper
precepts to every person, but frames not the whole man, persuading the husband
how to carry himself toward his wife; the father how to bring up children;
the master how to govern servants: and have left the other as wandering without
our profit: as though any one could in part persuade, except first he had
comprehended the sum of universal life. But Aristo a Stoicke, on the
contrary esteems this to be a light part, and which descends not even unto
the breast: but that which has not precepts, he says, that it profits very
much; and that the decrees themselves of Philosophy, are the constitution of
the chiefest good, which he that has understood and learned well, himself
commands himself, what is to be done on either part. Even as he who learneth
to cast a Dart, takes a fit place, and frames his hand for the direction of
those things which he delivers; when he has gotten this force by instruction
and exercise, he uses it at whatsoever he will; for he has learned not to hit
this or that, but whatsoever he will: so he who has instructed himself for
his whole life, desires not particularly to be admonished, he being taught
for the whole; not how to live with a wife or with a son, but how he may live
well: in this also it is how he may live with his wife and children. Cleanthes
judges this part also to be profitable indeed, but weak except it flowed
from the whole, except one knew the very decrees and heads of Philosophy.
Therefore this place is divided into two questions; Whether it be profitable or
unprofitable, and whether it alone can make a good man, that is, whether it be
superfluous, or can make all things else superfluous. They who would have this
part to be thought superfluous, say thus: If any thing set against the eyes
hinders the sight, it is to be removed; but that not being cast away he has
lost his labor, who has given instructions: thus thou shall walk, thither
shall thou stretch out thine hand; after the same manner, when any thing
blinds the mind, and hinders it from discerning the order of duties, he
dot^ nothing who delivers precepts: thus shall thou live with thy father,
thus with thy wife. For precepts will profit nothing, so long as error is
spread before the mind: if that be driven away, it will appear^ what is due to
every duty. Otherwise thou teach him what a sound man must do, thou
make him not sound. Thou show to him that is poor, how to play the rich
man: but how can this be done, if so be that poverty remain? Thou show to
him that is hungry, what he may do as a man being full: rather take away
hunger, which is fastened to the inward parts. The same will I say unto thee
concerning all vices; the things themselves are to be removed away; we are not
to command that which cannot be done, whilst they do remain. Except thou shall
expel false opinions, that we be troubled withal; neither will a covetous man
hear how he must use money, nor a fearful man how he may contemn dangers.
It is requisite that thou make him know that money is neither good nor bad:
that thou show unto him most miserable rich men: that thou cause, that
whatsoever we have feared in public, he may know that it is not so to be
feared, as fame relates it is: no not dolor nor death: that it is a great
comfort often in death, which the law constrains us to suffer, because it
returns to no man: obstinacy of mind shall be for a remedy in grief: he
that suffered any thing resolutely, makes it to be lighter unto himself: that
the nature of grief is the best, because neither that which is extended can be
great; nor that which is great can be extended: that al things are to be
valiantly received, which the necessity of the world commands us. When thou
have brought him by these decrees unto the sight of his own condition, and he
shall know that a blessed life is, not which is according to pleasure, but
according to nature: when he shall altogether love virtue, the only good of a
man, and shall fly from dishonestie as that which is only bad, he shall know
that all other things, namely, riches, honors, good health, strength, empire
be in the middle part, and are neither to be numbered amongst the good, nor
reckoned amongst the evil. He shall need no instructor to say unto him, walk
thus, sup after this manner; this becomes a man, that a woman; this a married
man, that a bachelor. For these things which they so diligently prescribe,
they themselves cannot do. These things does the Schoolmaster teach his
scholar, the grandmother her nephew; and the choleric master argues that a
man must not be angry. If thou enter into the schools, thou shall find that
children are taught all that for their lesson, which Philosophers boast of with
such lofty looks. Finally, whether will thou propose such things as are
manifest, or such as are doubtful? Those things that are evident need not to
be taught, and he that teaches such things as are doubtful, is hardly
believed. It is therefore a superfluous thing to teach. This learn thus: If
thou proposest things that are obscure and ambiguous, thou must confirm them
by proofs. If thou will prove them, those things by which thou prouest are
more available, and are sufficient enough of themselves. Thus use thy friend,
thus thy fellow Citizen, thus thy companion. Why? Because it is just. All
these things the common place as touching justice, will furnish me with. There
find I that equity is a thing to be desired of it self, that fear cannot
compel us thereunto, and that for gain we will not respect it: briefly, that
he is not just and upright who approves any thing in this virtue, but the
virtue it self. When as I have persuaded my self of these things, and learned
it perfectly, what do these precepts profit me, which instruct the learned
man? To give precepts to a wiseman is a superfluous travail, to an ignorant
man it suffices not. For he must hear not only what is taught him, but why
it is taught him: that is to say, whether they be necessary to him that has
true opinions as touching goods and evils, or to him that has not: he that
has them not, will be no ways profited by thee, for a common report contrary
to thy admonitions has filled and possessed his ears. He that has an exact
judgment of that he ought to fly and follow, knows that which he ought to
do, although thou be silent. All this part of Philosophy therefore may be cut
off. There are in us two evils, which make us commit others. Either in our
minds is there a malice contracted by evil opinions; or although it be not
occupied with falsities, yet is it inclined unto error, and is quickly
corrupted by some vain appearance, which draws him thither whether he should
not pretend. It behooves us therefore either to cure the sick mind, and to
deliver it from vices, or that it be not as yet infected, but inclined unto
evil, to prevent it. The decrees of Philosophy do both the one and the
other. Therefore such a kind of teaching does nothing. Furthermore, if we give
instructions to all in particular: we should never make an end. For we must
in^truct the Usurer one way, the Husbandman another way, the Merchant thus, him
that affected the friendship of Princes, otherwise: thu^, those that should
love their equals: that way, such as affect their inferiors. In matrimony they
must teach how a man must live with a wife, whom he married a maid; how with her
that had a husband before, how with a rich, how with a poor one. Think thou
there is no difference betwixt a barren and a fruitful woman, between an old,
and a young maiden, betwixt a mother, and a stepdame? we cannot comprehend all
kinds; and yet every one of them requires several lessons and
aduertisements. But the laws of Philosophy are short, and contain and write
all things. Add hereunto that a wise-mans precepts ought to be limited and
certain; if they are found to be infinite, they are out of the limits of
Philosophy, wisdom knows what the bounds of all things should be. This
part therefore which proposes things in particular ought to be removed,
because that what she promises to perform to a few, she cannot perform to
all. Contrariwise wisdom embraces and contains all men. There is little
difference between public madness, and that which the Physicians describe,
but that the particular is possessed with a certain sickness, the public is
besotted with false opinions: the one has drawn the causes of his fury from
the indisposition of the body, the other from the infirmities of the mind. If
a man should give precepts to a furious man, and teach him how to speak, how
to walk out, how to behave himself in public, how in private, he should be
more mad, then the mad man he teaches. He must purge the melancholy humor, and
the cause of fury must be removed. The like must be done in this other fury
of the mind; it must be discussed and driven away, otherwise all advertisement
will be to no end. These things are spoken by Ariston. To whom we will answer
in particular. First to that where he says, that if any thing hinders the
eye and lets the sight, it ought to be removed. I confess that he has no
need of precepts to make him see, but of medicines to purge his sight, and
means to drive away that which blemisheth the same. For by nature we see, and
he that takes away the obstacles, he returns the eye to his sight. But
Nature teaches not a particular duty to every one. Secondly, he that is cured
of his suffusion, cannot as soon as he has recovered his sight, give sight to
other men likewise. He that is rid of an infirmity recureth also. The eye
needs neither exhortation nor counsel to understand the proprieties of
colors, it will distinguish white from black without any teacher.
Contrariwise, the mind needs many precepts to discern what is to be done in
life. Albeit the Physician not only cures the infirm eye, but counsels
also. Thou must not (says he) expose thy weak eyesight suddenly to the open
air and brighter light, first from an obscure place seek out a shadie, then
be more bold, and by little and little accustom thy self to endure the
clear light. Thou must not study after meat, keep thy self quiet where thine
eyes are great and swollen. Avoid the wind and force of cold, lest it beat
upon thy face, and such like, which were no less profitable then the medicines
were. In brief, Physic annexeth counsels to remedies. Error, says he, is
the cause of sin, which sin counsel acquitteth us not of, neither
conuinceth false opinions of good and evil things I grant that precepts
suffice not of themselves to drive a perverse opinion out of the vnderstanding^
but it follows not, that being aunexed to others, they should be
unprofitable. First of all, they refresh the memory. Secondly, by their
means, those things which in general seemed confused, being divided into
pa^ts, are more diligently considered. Happily thou after this manner supposest
consolations and exhortations superfluous, but they are not; consequently not
admonitions. It is a folly (says Ariston) to command a sick man such a thing
as he should do in his health, whereas his health is to be restored unto him,
without which all his precepts are vain. But have not both the sick and whole
certain things common to them both, whereof they ought to be admonished, as
not to eat ouer-greedily, nor travel excessiuely? Both poor and rich have
certain common precepts. Cure avarice (says he) and thou shall have nothing
wherein thou shall admonish either the poor or rich: if the covetousness both
of the one and the other be abated. Is it a different thing not to desire
money, and to know well to use it? The covetous have no measure in their
desires, they that are not covetous, know not how to make use of money as they
ought. Take away the errors (says he) the precepts are superfluous. It is
false: for suppose that avarice be mod^rated, dissolution restrained, rashness
bridled, idleness awakened: although the vices are driven away, yet ought we
learn that which we ought to do and how. The admonitions se^ue to no use,
being applied to enormous vices. I answer that Physic heals not incurable
diseases, yet is it ministered to some for remedy, to othersome for
mitigation: not all the whole power of Philosophy, although she intend all her
forces to this end, can root out an indurate and inueterate plague out of our
minds: and yet she remedieth some evils, though she cures not all. What
profits it, says he, to show that which is discovered? Greatly, for
sometimes although we know a thing, yet we regard it not. Admonition teaches
not, but it awakeneth and setleth the memorie^ and preuenteth forgetfulness.
We take little heed of many things, which pass before our eyes. To admonish is
a kind of exhortation. Oftentimes our mind pretends not to comprehend that
which is apparent: we ought therefore to refresh the memory with the knowledge
of things best known. In this place it shall not be amiss to repeat the
notable saying of CALVVS against VATINIVS, You know there has been bribing,
and all men know that you know it. Thou know that we ought to entertain
friendship religiously, but thou do it not. Thou know him to be a wicked
man, that requires his wife should be honest, and himself hunteth after
other men's wives. Thou know that as she ought not to acquaint her self with
an adulterer, so thou should not have to do with a strumpet, and yet thou
use to prostitute. For this cause oftentimes ought thou to call thy duty
to memory, for thy memory must not be distracted, but at hand and before
thine eyes. All wholesome things ought to be oftentimes remembered, and renewed,
to the end that besides the knowledge thereof, we may have them ready to
assist us. Besides that which is already well comprehended, is understood and
remembered far better. If those things (says h^e) be doubtful which thou
teach. Thou ought to add proof unto them, they therefore be not the
precepts will pro^it. I answer, that the authority of him that admonishes,
suffices without any proof of his saying. As the answers of the Lawyers are
of force although they yield no reason of their counsel. Moreover, precepts
have a great weight in themselves, especially if we intermix them with poesy,
or that in prose they be shut up together in a few, but grave words. As those
of CATOES, Buy not that which thou need, but that which is necessary. That
which thou have no need of is dear of a farthing. And these other sentences
proceeding from Oracles or other excellent men. Spare time. Know thy self.
Would thou ask the cause thereof, if a man should repeat thee these
sentences. Forgetfulness is the remedy of injuries. Fortune favors the
audacious. The idle man hinders himself. These sentences seek no advocate,
they touch the affections and profit, because Nature vnfouldeth virtue in them.
Our minds contain all the seeds of virtue, and these seeds fructify by
means of admonitions, no otherwise then a sparkle being assisted with a light
blast, becomes a great flame: virtue is awakened, when she is either touched
or shaken. Furthermore, there are certain things, which buried in our
understanding, begin to show their worth, when they are quickened by
admonitions. There are other sorts of things which lie here and there, which a
dull understanding and unexercised cannot recollect. It behooves therefore to
gather them into one, and to join them together, to the end they may be more
forcible, and raise the mind the more. Or if precepts have no power, we must
exterminate all institution, and be contented with Nature her self. They that
see this, consider not that there are some that have a stirring and noble
spirit; the other of a dull and heavy. In brief, that all are not equally,
are not of one ingenuitie. The power of the mind is nourished, and increases
by precepts, and annexeth new persuasions to those that are innate, and
corrects those that are depraved. If any man (says he) has not the true
decrees, what shall admonitions profit him, that is plagued and drowned in
vices? Truly this, that he may be delivered of them. For the natural
disposition is not extinguished in him, but obscured and oppressed. In pursuit
whereof she endeavors to raise her self, and to resist evil. As soon as
she is succored and assisted by precepts, she receives her forces, provided
that this contagion of sin, which has so long time infected her, has not
wholly mortified her. For then the whole disciplines of Philosophy uniting all
her forces, cannot restore her. For what difference is there between the
decrees and precepts of Philosophy, but that the one are general, the other
particular. Both of them command; the decrees are general, the precepts
particular. If any one (says he) has just and honest decrees, such a one is
admonished in vain; not so. For this man, although he know that which he
ought to do, yet sees he not exactly all the parts of his duty. For we are
not only hindered by our affections, from executing that which is good, but for
want of a knowledge how to find out that which is requisite in every thing.
Sometimes we have a mind well composed, but heavy and vnaddressed to find
out the tract of the offices of our life, which is discovered unto us by
admonitions. Drive away (says he) the false opinions, as touching goods and
evils, settle the true in stead of the false, and then will admonition be
profitable. Assuredly the mind is governed by such means, but not by this
means only. For although it be by arguments gathered, what are good, and what
are evil, notwithstanding precepts have their parts, and both Prudence and
Justice consist in offices, and offices are disposed by precepts. Furthermore,
the judgment that we have of goods and evils, is con^irmed by the execution of
o^fices, whereunto we are guided by precepts. For they agree together, neither
may those go before, but these will follow after, and keep their rank;
whence it appears that the General march before. Precepts, says he, are
infinite. It is false. For they are not infinite in things that are great and
necessary, but their differences according to time, place, and persons are
small. But to these likewise are general precepts given. There is no man
(says he) that cures madness by precepts, and consequently not malice. There
is a difference. For in curing a mad man of his madness, he is restored to his
health. If we have excluded false opinions, we presently apprehend not that
which we ought to do, and were it so, yet our admonition would confirm the
right apprehension and judgment we have of goods and evils. This likewise is
^alse, that precepts no ways profit mad men. For as they profit not always,
so further they the cure. Both threatenings and chastisements have restrained
mad men: I speak now of those mad men whose wits are altered, but not taken
from them. The laws, replieth he, cause us not to do that which we ought. And
what other thing are they, but precepts intermixed with threatenings? First of
all they persuade not, because they menace; but precepts constrain not, but
persuade. Secondly, laws deter us from doing evil: precepts exhort every
one to do his duty. Add hereunto, that laws are profitable to good
manners, provided, that precepts be united to their commandments. In this
thing differ I from Posidonius: I allow not the principles that are set in the
beginning of Platoes laws. For a law should be short, to the end that the
ignorant might apprehend it more easily, as if it were an Oracle. Let it
command, not dispute. Nothing seems more impertinent and foolish to me, then
a law garnished with a Preface. Admonish, tell me what thou would have me do;
I listen not to thee to learn, but to obey. The laws are profitable, so see
we that Commonweals, which have had evil ordinances, have had worse
manners. But laws pro^ite not all men; no more does Philosophy, and yet it
cease not to be pro^itable and powerful in forming men's minds. And what
other thing is Philosophy but the law of our life? But let us presuppose that
the laws are unprofitable, it follows not therefore that admonitions are
unnecessary: otherwise we should say that consolations, exhortations,
disswasions, reprehensions and praises, served to no purpose. These are sorts
of admonitions, and by their means the spirit attayneth his perfection. There
is nothing that more reuesteth our understandings with virtue, nor that
retireth them more from an evil custom, and confirms them in goodness,
then good men's conversation. For by little and little it descends and
distilleth into the heart, and to be often seen and heard, stands in stead
of precepts, undoubtedly the only meeting with wisemen does great good; and
thou may learn somewhat of a virtuous man, even then when he is silent. I
cannot so well tell thee how it profits, as I have found that it profited me.
Some small creatures (as Phaedon says) when they sting are not felt, so small
and ready is their stinge to give the prick, but the swelling is discovered
although there appear no wound in the same. The like will befall thee in thy
conversation with wisemen, thou shall not perceive when or how he profits
thee, but thou shall find the profit. Whereto (says he) tends all this?
Good precepts and admonitions, oft-times reiterated, will profit thee as much
as good examples. Pythagoras says, that they who entered into a Temple, or that
saw near unto them any image of the gods, or heard the voice of some Oracle,
changed their minds and thoughts. Who dare deny, but that the most Idiots of
the world are powerfully stricken with some precepts? As for example, by these
which ensue, which are short, but sententious, and of great weight, namely,
Nothing too much. The greedy mind is never satisfi^^ with gain. Such measure
as thou metest, the same shall be mete to thee. These things hear we with
strong apprehension, neither may any man doubt or dispute upon them: Why?
Because truth persuades without any assistan^e of reason: if the respect we
bear unto any man bridleth our ^pirits, and represseth our vices, why should
not admonition do the like? If correction makes men ashamed, what should
hinder the same effect in good admonition although it were accompanied but with
simple precepts? But what admonition is more powerful, and pierces deeper,
which fortifieth his commandments with good reasons, that alleges why a man
should do this or that, and what good may befall a man by his obedience? If
commandment and authority serve, so does admonition; but authority is of
great use, and consequently admonition. Virtue is divided into two parts, into
contemplation of truth, and into action. Institution teaches contemplation,
admonition action. A just action both exercises and shows virtue. But if he
that persuades profits him that is to act, he likewise will profit that
admonishes. If therefore upright action be necessary to virtue, and admonition
shows what just actions be, it follows that admonition is necessary. There
are two things which greatly fortify the mind, assurance of the truth, and
confidence. Admonition produces both these. For there is credit given to the
same, and when she is believed, the mind conceiueth high hopes, and is filled
with confidence: admonition therefore is not superfluous. Marcus Agrippa, a man
of great understanding, and only happy to the public good, amongst all those
that were raised by civil wars, was wont to auow, that he was very much
indebted to this sentence; For by concord small things increase, by discord the
greatest are ruined. This, says he, made me become a good brother, and a sure
friend. If such sentences familiarly entertained in the mind do form the
same, why should not this part of Philosophy which consists of such like
sentences, do the like? A part of virtue consists in discipline, another in
action. Thou must learn, and that which thou have learned thou must confirm
by action: which if it be so, not only decrees of wisemen are profitable, but
also the precepts, which restrain and oblige our affections as it were with an
Edict. Philosophy, says he, is divided into these, into science and the
habit of the mind. For he that has comprehended any thing and knows that
which he ought to do and avoid, is not yet wise, except his spirit be
transformed into those things which he has learned. The third part, consisting
in precepts, is composed of the two precedent, both of decrees and of habit,
and consequently superfluous to make virtue complete, whereas they two are
sufficient. By this reckoning then consolation is unnecessary, for this also
consists of both; neither exhortation, persuasion, neither argumentation. For
she takes her original from the habit of a composed and strong mind, But
although these parts proceed from that habitude of the mind, the best habit
of the mind is both of the one, and of the other. Furthermore, all that which
thou say respects a perfect man, and such a one as has attained the sum
of humane felicity. But to this a man attaineth very slowly; mean while we
must show an imperfect man, yet such a one as is toward the way which he ought
to hold in his actions. It may be that wisdom may address her self without
admonition, considering she has already led the spirit so outward that he
cannot be moved but on the right way. But as touching those that are more
feeble, they had need of a conductor that may say unto them, Thou shall shun
this, thou shall do this. Besides, if he expect the time, wherein of himself
he may know that which is best to be done, he shall in the mean space err,
and erring shall be hindered from attayning to that whereby he may be contented
with himself. He must therefore be governed till he begin to be able to
govern himself. Children are taught to form their letters, their fingers are
held, and their hand directed, and led to teach them to fashion and counterfeit
letters, then are they commanded to follow such and such examples, and by them
to reform their writing. So is our mind strengthened if it be instructed by
proposing some example unto it which she may follow. These are the things
whereby it is approved that this part of Philosophy is not superfluous.
Furthermore it is demanded whether she alone suffices to make a wiseman. We
will answer this question at another time: for the present, omitting those
arguments, does it not appear unto us that we had need of some advocate, who
may give us instructions contrary to the precepts of the people? A man cannot
speak any thing that touches us not. They that wish us good hurt us, and they
also that curse us: for the imprecation of those impresseth in us false fears,
and the love of others spoyleth us, in desiring our prosperity, because it
drives us to goods that are foreign, wandering, and uncertain, whereas we
might draw felicity from our selves. I say that we are not permitted to follow
the right way. Our parents and servants draw us unto evil. No man erreth to
himself only, but spreads his folly amongst his neighbors, and learneth
of theirs likewise. And therefore the vices of the common sort are in every
private man, because the people amongst whom he conuerseth has given them him,
and in making others badde he becomes badde himself, he has learned the
worse, and afterward teaches the same; and when that which each one knew to
be most wicked was gathered and put together, that great heap of iniquity was
made and discovered. Let there be therefore some guide that may pull thee by
the ear, drive thee from the brute of Cities, and reclaim thee from the
flatteries of the common sort. For thou abusest thy self if thou think that
vices are borne with us; they steal upon us, and were ingested into us. Let us
therefore repress those opinions which buzze about our ears by frequent
admonitions. Nature neither tyeth nor obliges us to any vice: she has
ingendered us entire and free: nothing that might incite our avarice has she
placed in open sight, but has put both gold and silver under our feet to be
kicked and trod upon, or whatsoever it be for which we are kicked and trod
upon. She has addressed our faces toward heaven, and would that we should
behold whatsoever she has made, either magnificent or wonderful in the
world, the rising and settings of the stars, the sudden course and motion of
the heavens, which by day make us see the goods of the earth, and by night those
of the heavens. The slow motion of the stars, if they be compared with the
whole, the swift, if thou imagine how great way they make without ever staying;
then the eclipses of the Sun and Moon, opposed the one against the other:
moreover, diverse other things worthy admiration, whether they succeed by order,
or break forth being moved by their causes; as the pillars of fire in the
night, the flashes streaming from the opening heaven without thunder and
lightning, the pillars, beams, and other diverse inflamed impressions in the
air: nature disposes al these things above us. As touching gold, silver and
iron, which by reason of both these has deprived us of peace, she has hid
them, as if they had bin badly committed unto us. But we have brought them to
light, to the end we might fight for them: we casting the weighty earth from
off them, have dug them up, the only causes and instruments of our dangers.
We have trusted our miseries unto fortune, neither are we ashamed that they are
in the greatest estimation with us, which were most deeply buried in the bosom
of the earth. Will thou see how fallatious the brightness is that blemisheth and
bewitcheth thine eyes? There is nothing more abject, nor more obscure then
these as long as they are buried in their mould. Why not? when as they are
drawn out of the darkness of the largest and longest mines, there is nothing
more deformed then they are, whilst they are separated from their excrements,
and drawn from their veins. Briefly, regard a while those that travel in the
mine, by whose hands this ^terrill and informed kind of earth is purged, and
you shall see how they are besmeared with smoke. But these do more defile the
minds then the bodies, and there is more soil in those that possess them,
then in those that refine them. It is necessary therefore to be admonished, and
to have some Counselor of good understanding, that in so great confusion and
tumult of falsities, may truly speak unto us: what shall he speak? Those
words and wholesome counsails, which may open our ears, being deafned by so
many ambitious cries, and say, Thou have no cause to e^uy these whom the people
terms great and happy men. There is no cause that a vain applause should
ravish from thee the settled habitude and health of thy soul. There is no
reason that this great Lord, so gaily attended and clad in purple, should drive
thee from the heig^t of thy peace. Thou have no more cause to judge him more
happy, to whom every man gives place, then him whom the Sergeant enforces to
give way. If thou will exercise a power that may be profitable unto thee, and
hurt no man, drive vice from thee. Many there are that set fire on Cities,
that level huge Fortresses with the ground, which so many hundredth years were
held impregnable, that raise Plat-formes as high as Castles, who by Engines of
battery ouerturne marvelous high walls, who cause armies to march before them,
that nearly pursue their flying enemies, who covered with the blood of
conquered Nations, have gotten countries as far as the bounds of the Ocean;
but these having defeated their enemies, have themselves bin overcome by their
own desires. No man might make head against their armies, no more then they
knew how to resist their ambition and cruelties. Even then when they seemed to
pursue others, they were pursued themselves. The cursed desire of spoiling
other men's countries afflicted unhappy Alexander, and sent him to countries
unknown. Do thou think him a man of understanding, or in his right w^ts, who
began to ruinate Greece, where first he was brought up and instructed, did
afterward pillage all that which every one possessed and esteemed best? He
imposed a yoke on Sparta, and silence to Athens. And not content with the
spoil of many Cities, either subdued or bought by Philip his father, he
scattered them from one place to another, made war upon all the world without
remitting ought of his wonted cruelty, imitating herein the savage beasts, who
bite more then hunger enforces them to. Furthermore, he joined diverse
kingdoms in one, he made himself dreadful to the Greeks and Persians, he
subdued the free Nations that were under Darius his Dominion; yet would he
beyond the Ocean, and the Sun being displeased that Hercules and Bacchus
pillars should confine his victories. He addresseth himself to enforce Nature;
he will not march, neither will he stay in a place resembling those fardel^
which are cast from the top to the ground, which cease not to tumble down
until they fall to the bottom. Neither did virtue nor reason counsel Pompey
to enterprise his foreign and civil wars, but a disordinate love of
flattering greatness drove him now into Spain against Sertorius, then to make
war against the Pirates, and to assure the Seas. Th^se were his pretexts to
maintain his authority, who drue him into Africa, into the North, into
Armenia, and through all the corners of Asia against Mithridates. It was an
immeasurrable desire of greatness, being in his own opinion not great enough.
What thing thrust Caesar upon his own and his Countries ruin? Glory and
ambition, and no measure of eminency above others: for he could not endure
that one should be before him, when as his Commonwealth endured two Masters.
Think thou that Marius who was once Consul (for one Con^ulate he received,
the other six he bribed or enforced) was egged on by virtue to hew the
Cimbrians and Theutons in pieces, to follow Iugurth thorough the deserts of
Africa, and to expose himself to so many perils? Marius conducted the Army,
but ambition conducted Marius. These men, whilst they shook all others, were
shaken themselves after the manner of whirle-windes, which before they wind in
those things they force up, are themselves tossed; and therefore turn they with
greater fury, because they have no hold of themselves: by which means these
men, after they have cruelly tormented others, do feel in themselves this
pernicious fury, wherewith they have offended other men. Think not that any
man may become happy by another man's misfortune. All these examples proposed
both to our eyes and ears, ought to be remembered, and our hearts full filled
with evil opinions, ought to be cleansed. Where the place is void there must
we lodge virtue, which rooteth out pleasing lies which seperateth us from the
people (to whom we give overmuch credit) and confirms us in sincere and good
opinions. For this is wisdom, to be converted into nature, and to be restored
thither whence public error has expelled us. It is a great part of health,
to have forsaken the counsailors of folly, and to have far-fled from this
company of people which corrupt one another. To know that this is true,
consider how every man lives after one sort in public, after another in
private. Solitude of it self, neither teaches us simplicity or innocence; the
country makes us not more frugall or temperate, but when there is no body that
may behold and give testimony, vices retire themselves. For their good lies
in this to be beheld and seen. Who would put on a purple robe if no man should
see him? Who being couched under the shadow of some rusticke tree, has mustred
all the people of his dissoluteness to himself alone? No man is brave in
secret, no not in the presence of two or three of his familiars, but according
to the number and quality of those that behold him, makes he show of his
vanities. So then if any one, either know or admire us, that is the spur that
pricketh on to discover all these things, on which we are mad and besotted.
Take away the show, thou shall abolish covetousness. Ambition, dissoluteness
and pride will have themselves seen. Will thou recover them? Hide them. If
therefore we are lodged in the midst of Cities, let us keep some good
counsailor about us: who opposing himself against those that praise great
possessions, priseth a rich man very little, and that measures his goods by
their use: against those who make reckoning of nothing but credit and humane
greatness, let him approve and commend that ^onest repose which the study of
good letters gives; and let him esteem nothing so much as a conscience that
has forsaken al transitory things, to ground himself upon the real good? Let
him show that all they who are commonly called happy tremble, and are dismayed
in that high degree so much envied, and have a far other opinion of
themselves then the people has. For those things that are raised, and highly
prised in other men's eyes, in their judgments are slippery, steepy, and
uncertain. For this cause they are heartlesse and fearful as often as they
look into this steep mountain of mightines, whereupon they are mounted. Then
suspect they those things they desired, and their felicity which has been so
odious unto others, is more hateful to themselves: Then praise they a
peaceable and retired life: authority is distastefull unto them, they seek to
be discharged of their prosperity; then shall thou see them play the
Philosophers for fear, and take good counsel from their adversity. For as
if prosperity and a good mind were appointed contraries, we are most wise in
our miseries, contrariwise prosperity bereaueth us of our judgment.

EPIST. XCV.
It adherethor depends of the former, and the question is, whether the
Exhortatorie part of Philosophy may alone suffice? When as especially he has
showed so many and so clear uses thereof. He denies, sets down, and
refelleth the arguments which are urged. Therefore he praises the doctrinall
part, and shows that precepts flow from that fountain, and that life is
contained therein. He intermixeth worthy things, and by the way makes an
excursion against riot, lust, and unlawful affection of honors. The whole
Epistle is excellent and fruitful.

THou requirest me to represent that which I had remitted, till another time,
and that I should write unto thee, if that part of Philosophy which consists
in precepts, which the Greeks call (...), we preceptiue be sufficient to
make a man perfectly wise. I know thou will take it in good part, if I deny the
same, and for that cause the rather do I renew my promise, and will not suffer
that my word so expressly and solemnly engaged should be broken. Hereafter ask
me nothing which thou will not obtain, for sometimes we instantly require
that, which we would refuse if it were offered unto us. This, whether it be
lightness or familiarity, is to be punished with a facility of promising:
we seem to will many things which we would not. A certain Reciter brought a
great history written in a small hand, and straightly foulded, and having red
over a great part thereof: I will give over (says he) if you will. To this it
is answered with a loud voice. Read on, Read on, by those who would willingly
that he should presently hold his peace. Oftentimes we will owe things, and
wish another, and to the gods themselves we speak not truth; but the gods
either hear us not, or have mercy upon us. But I setting apart all favor
will redeem my self, and will cloy thee with a long Epistle, which if thou
read unwillingly, say that thou thy self art the cause, and number thy self
amongst those whom a wife continually tormenteth to get her self some new
gown daily: amongst those that have no joy of the goods they have gotten with
great labor: amongst those whom honor torments, being gotten by all industry
and labor, and the rest who are partakers of their own evils. But leaving
this Preface, I come to the point. A blessed life (say they) consists of just
actions, whereunto we are led by precepts, consequently precepts are
suf^ficient to make the life happy. Yet precepts do not always lead a man to
just actions, but when as the mind is capable and conformable to instructions.
Sometimes they are proposed in vain, to wit, when the understanding is
besieged with false opinions. Again, although they do right, yet know they
not that they do right. For no man can perform that which he ought every
way, nor understand when he ought to do a thing, nor how much, nor with whom,
nor how, if from the beginning he has not been addressed and fashioned
exactly in all reason. By means whereof he cannot with his whole mind
constantly and willingly endeavor unto virtue, but shall be doubtful and look
back. If an honest action (say they) proceeds from precepts precepts shall
sufficiently suffice to make the life happy, but the one is true,
consequently, therefore so is the other. To these we answer, that honest
actions proceed not only from precepts and particular instructions, but also
from maxims and general rules. If other arts (says he) are content with
precepts, wisdom also will be contented, which is the art of life, but he
makes a master of a ship that instructs him thus. Steer after this manner,
strike sail after this fashion, take the benefit of a good wind thus, resist
a contrary that way, and make use of such a means to warrantise thee from a
cross wind. Precepts likewise confirm other sorts of Artists. Cannot
therefore Philosophers teach others to live; cannot they do the like? All
these arts are employed about the instruments of life, not about the whole
life, and therefore many things hinder and let them externally, such as are
hope, covetousness, and fear. But Wisdom the mistress of life cannot be
hindered by any thing from continuing her exercise, for she preuenteth
impediments, and temperateth obstacles. Will thou know wherein they differ in
condition? In mechanique arts it is more excusable to sin for want of advice,
then casually, and in wisdom it is a great fault to sin willingly. That
which I say is so. The Grammarian is not ashamed of a Solecisme, if he make it
willingly, but he blusheth if he do it without taking he^d. If the Physician
foreseeth not that his patient begins to wear away, he commits more error
in his art, then if he perceived the defect, and pretended not to know it. But
in the art of good life, more shameful is their fault, who offend willingly.
Add hereunto that the most kind of arts, yea of them all the most liberal
have not only their precepts, but decrees, as Physic has. There is therefore
one sect of Hippocrates, another of As^lepiades, another of Themison. Besides
no contemplative art is without her decrees, which the Greeks call (...), we
precepts: propositions and foundations, which you shall find in Geometry and
Astronomy. But Philosophy is both contemplative and active, she speculateth
and sets hand to the work. For thou errest, if thou think that she only
promises terrestrial actions, she aspireth more high. I s^arch (says she)
the whole world, neither contain I my self enclosed in the company of mortal
men, to the only end to persuade or dissuade. Great matters, such as are above
your reach call and inuit me. For first I will disclose and let thee know
The secrets of the heavens and higher powers,
Whence Nature forms, and whence she makes things grow,
Whence they increase, and spread their seeds and flowers,
I Will count thee all their of-springs and their ends,
And what in each thing Nature most intends.
As Lucretius says. (...). 1. de Natu^a ^^rum.
It follows therefore that being contemplatine, she has her decrees. In
effect no man shall ever perform that which he ought, but he that has
comprehended the reason whereby in every thing he may perform his decrees in
all offices; which he shall not observe who has received but mere precepts.
Those things that are distributed by parcels are feeble in themselves, and if I
may so say, without root. Those are decrees which defend us, which maintain
our security and tranquillity, which comprehend at once all life and all
nature. The same difference is there between the decrees and precepts of
Philosophy, as there is between letters and whole clauses. The one depend
upon the other, decrees also are the cause of precepts and of all things. The
ancient wisdom, says he, only taught naught else, but what was to be done,
and to be esteemed. And then were men far better, after learned men began to
flourish, good men were scant. For that simple and open truth is changed into
an obscure and subtle science, and we are taught how to dispute, not how to
live. Without doubt, that ancient wisdom, as you say, was rude and simple in
the beginning, no less then other arts which have been polished by succession
of time. But at that time also the present remedies were not necessary,
wickedness was not grown to that height, neither had she spread her self so
largely every where; simple remedies were sufficient for simple vices. But now
the more strange the mischifes are which assault us, the more solid should our
resist and defenses be. Physic in times past was but the knowledge of a few
Simples, whereby a flux of blood might be stayed, and wounds by little and
little might be healed. Afterward she attained to this raritie of medicines:
neither is it to be wondered at, that in those days she had so little to do;
sure then men had more strong bodies, and were contented with easy and simple
diet, and not corrupted by art and pleasure. Which diet, after it began to be
sought, not to take away, but provoke hunger; and a thousand sorts of sauces
were invented, whereby the appetite might be awakened. Those meats which
sustained such men as were hungry, are become as many burdens to full
bellies. From thence proceeded palenesse, and the trembling of the nerves,
being drowned in wine, and a more miserable leanenesse caused rather by
crudities, then by hunger. From this excess has proceeded the weakness and
slumbling of the feet, and such a kind of gate as drunken men use. Thence
grew the water betwixt the filme and flesh, thence was the belly descended,
whilst it was accustomed to receive more then it could contain. Thence came
the black Ianders, the discolored face, and the consumption of such as rotted
inwardly. Thence crooked fingers, by reason of the stifnes of the joints, hence
the Apoplexy, hence the Palsy: why should I reckon up the swimming and
turning of the head, the torments both of eyes and ears, and the vermination
of the inflamed brain; and all the passages of our bodies, whereby we are
purged, affected with inward ulcers. Besides an innumerable sort of Feuours,
the one violent and sudden, the other lent and lingering, the other beginning
with much horror and shaking of the members? why should I rip up other
innumerable diseases, the just plagues of intemperance? Free were they from
those evils, who as yet were not weakened by these delicates, who governed and
ministered unto themselves. They hardened their bodies with industry and true
labor, either wearied with running, or hunting, or plowing of their lands; and
their meat was such as could not please any but such as were hungry. There was
therefore no need of so great a multitude of Physicians, neither of so many
instruments and subnotaries. There health being entertained by a simple cause,
was simple also: many dishes have bred many sicknesses. Behold how many things
gormundize the ruin both of land and sea, intermixeth together to the end they
might afterward be swallowed by one greedy gullet. It cannot be, but that
things so diverse should strive one with another, and after they are swallowed
down, should hardly be disgested, by reason that the one is a hinderance to
the other. It is no marvel, if of meats so different, such confused and
violent sicknesses are engendered, nor that the humors being driven by contrary
passages, should redound as they do. See here the cause why we have so many
different sorts of sicknesses, as of meats. The greatest of the Physicians, and
the Founder of the Science, says, that women are neither bauld nor sick of
the gout, yet they at this day are both destitute of hair and lame in their
feet. The nature of women is not changed, but the life. For whereas they have
equalled men in their licentiousnes, they have likewise had an equal part in
their maladies. They watch no less, they drink no less, and challenge their
husbands in bathing and drunkenness. Both the one and the other having, as it
were, by force filled their panches, yield it up again by their mouths, and in
vomitting return back again all the wine they have swallowed. The women as
well as the men gnaw upon the Ice to cool their ouer-hot stnomacks. But in lust
they surpass the males, being borne to suffer. The gods and goddesses confound
them, who have perverted the order of habitation both with male and female.
Wonder not therefore, though the greatest amongst Physicians, and Naturalists
was deceived in this, that at this time there are so many bauld and gowtie
women. By excess have they lost the benefit of their sex, and because they
have shaken off the habit of women, they are condemned to endure the sicknesses
of men. The ancient Physicians knew not what it was to prescribe their patients
to feed often, and to replenish their veins that were emptied with wine: they
knew neither how to cup nor to scarifie, nor to bath and sweat those that had
been long time sick, they knew not how by binding the legs and arms, to
revoke the hidden heat to the outward parts, which was stayed in the center.
There was no need to look about for many kinds of remedies, when as there were
but few sorts of sicknesses. But now to what number and height are infirmities
grown? This is the usury which we pay for so much pleasure as we have
wrongfully and inordinately desired. Maruellest thou to see so many sicknesses?
Number me the Cooks. All study is given over. The professors of liberal
sciences are without auditors, their sieges void, and their scholars gone.
Solitude dwells in the Schools of Rhetoricians and Philosophers.
Contrariwise, how many famous Kitchins are there: how many young men fill up the
fires of such as are prodigal and dissolute. I speak not of the troops of
poor young children, who at the shutting up of a feast attend to suffer other
villainy in the chambers. I ouerslip the troops of those that have been
abused contrary to Nature, distinguished by nations and colors, so as on the
one side, all they of the same height are raunged, and they whose beards begin
to bud, and such as are haired alike, to the end that he who has the straight
and long hair, should not be mixed amongst those that are curled. I ouerpasse
the troops of Pastlers, and attendants who serve in supper when the sign is
given them. Good God, how many men are busied about one belly. Think thou
that these mushromes, a sort of pleasant poison, although they hurt not upon
the present, do they not secretly work and wrong at last? Think thou that
this snow, which they use to refresh and cool themselves with in Summer,
hardens not their livers, and that unsavory meat of Oysters, that are
fattened with mud, engender they not viscous and clammie humors? Beleeuest thou
not that the sauce which is composed of Mackerels and other sort of ^ish that
costs so dear, does it not with his drying saltness burn the entrails?
Iudgest thou that these rotten ioyces which are swallowed down hot, can they
without harm be extinguished in the stomach? How ^ilthie and pestilent
belches? What loathing of themselves? Whilst they disgorge their old surfets?
Know thou, that whatsoever they take rotteth, but disgesteth not. I remember
that in times past AEsopes dish was much spoken of, wherein this sweet-lipped
fellow running unto his own ruin, gathered all that was either rare or
dainty from the tables of great men: there were diverse sorts of shel-fish
handsomely chewed and ready to swallow, ath wart whereof were enterlaced
Creuisses, and above them dressed Barbels, cut in pieces and severed from their
^innes and bones. It loatheth them to fe^de on every dish apart, all sauces
are mixed in one, and at supper-time that is done, that should be done after
collation time. Now must I expect to have the minsed meats served in so small,
as if they had been chewed. What difference is there between taking away the
s^ales and bones, or to have a Cook to execute the office of our teeth? It is
too tedious a thing to disgui^e all sorts of meats; for once we must make a
hochpot, why should I put any hand into a dish that had but one kind of
dainty? Let me have many come together. Let the ornaments of many dishes be
united and joined together. Let them forth with know, who say that this
prodigality at men's Tables is done to make them to be talked of and esteemed,
that these are not public, but excesses done in secret. Let those things that
were wont to be s^uerally dressed, be served in in one broth. It is all one as
if Oysters and Sea-crabs, Muskels and Mullets be mixed together. The meat of
those that vomit should not be more confused. But as these meats and sauces
are confounded the one with the other; so likewise of such confused excess,
diverse compounded inexplicable, different, and manifold sickenesses do arise,
against which Physique has begun to arm her self with many remedies and
observations. The same say I of Philosophy; it was in times past more simple,
amongst those whose sins were not so enormous, but more easy and slight to
be cured. Against so great corruption of manners all things are to be
attempted. And would to God this plague at last might be so overcome: we play
the madmen, not only in private but in public; Do we repress private
murders? What shall I say of wars and the glorious sin of destroyed
countries? Neither avarice nor cruelty knew any measure; and these things as
long as they are done by stealth, and by private men are least hurtful and
monstrous. By the ordinances of the Senate, and Edicts of the people, those
heinous offenses which are cond^mned in private men, are permitted unto all,
and committed in sight of every man. We praise a public crime, which we would
punish with death had it been committed secretly. Are not men ashamed, that by
nature are the mildest, to take pleasure in shedding their neighbors blood, to
make war, and leave this exercise to their children? whereas even the dumb
and savage beasts have peace amongst themselves. Against so potent and general
a fury Philosophy was made more effectual, and assumed so much power unto her
self, as they had gathered against whom she is addressed. It was an easy
matter to chide and reprove those that were given over to wine, and besotted
with delicacy and dainties; for there needed no great force to reduce the mind
to frugality, from whence by little and little she had revolted. Now need we
work by force and violence,
And then by Art and great experience.
Pleasure is sought for on every side. No vice conteyneth it self in it self.
Dissolution runs headlong into avarice, honesty is forgotten: there is nothing
filthy if it be prised or pleasing. A man, a sacred thing; a man is now
murdered in jest. And whereas it was impiety to teach a man to give and
receive wounds, now expose we him in public both naked and disarmed,
supposing that his death would be a pleasing spectacle to content an assembly.
So then in this peruersitie and corruption of manners there needs some
medicine more eager then was accustomed to dissipate these inueterate evils. We
must propose Maxims and rules, that the persuasion of falsities too greatly
entertained, may be wholly extinguished. To these if we annex precepts,
consolations, exhortations, they may prevail, being scarce powerful enough of
themselves. If we will set them free that are bound, and draw them from those
evils wherewith they are now entangled, let them learn what evil is, and what
good is. Let them know that all things change their name but only virtue, and
now become evil, and now good. As the first bond of warfare is Religion, and
the love of our Ensign, and the loathing and heinousness to forsake it, and
after this all the rest are easily commanded and obtained at his hands who
has solemnly obliged his faith: so also must thou lay the first foundations in
those whom thou pretendest to conduct unto happy life, and to plant virtue in
their hearts. Let them be seized with a zealous superstition thereof, let them
love her, let them desire to live with her, not to live without her. What then?
Are there not some that without any subtle institution, have become honest,
and have attained to great perfection, whilst they only submitted themselves
to bare precepts? I confess no less. But they had a happy and apprehending
spirit, which in a moment apprehended that which is proper for his instruction.
For even as the immortal gods have learned no virtue, whereas by being and
nature they are all good, so some of noble nature comprehend those things which
are taught them, and as soon as virtue is showed unto them, they embrace it.
Whence grew these minds so greedily catching after virtue, and so fruitful of
themselves? But to those that are dull and hard of understanding, or long time
besieged with evil customs, the rust of their minds must be rubbed off. Even
as we easily draw those unto perfection who are inclined to good; so on the
other side the means to redress the feeble, and to dispossess them of their
evil opinions, is to propose unto them the rules and Maxims of Philosophy,
which are marvelous necessary, as thou shall perceive by that which ensues.
We have certain inclinations which make us heavy in some affairs, and light
and rash in others: neither may this rashness be repressed, nor that slownesse
awakened, except their causes be cut off, such as are false admiration and
fained fear. As long as these have us in their possession, thou may say,
This must thou do for thy father, this for thy children, this for thy friends,
this for thy guests; but avarice will restrain him that would attempt so good
a course. He shall know that he ought to fight for his country, but fear
shall dissuade him. He shall know that he must labor for his friends to the
uttermost, but pleasures shall withdraw him. He shall know that it is a most
heinous kind of injury toward a wife to entertain a harlot, yet shall lust
compel him to the contrary. It will therefore profit nothing to give precepts,
except thou first of all take away all things that are contrary to them: no
more then it will profit to have laid weapons in sight, and to have set them
nearer, except his hands be unbound that uses them. To give a means unto the
mind to apprehend the precepts which we give, we must give it liberty. Let us
suppose that a man does that which he ought not; he will not do it
continually, he will not do it equally, for he knows not wherefore he does
it. By adventure or by custom some things will go well, but a man shall not
have a rule in hand, to know the same whereunto he may trust that they are
rightly done, which he has done. He will not promise to continue good that is
casually good. Again, pecepts may happily instruct thee to do that which thou
ought, but not in that sort as thou ought; and if they perform not this,
they bring thee not to virtue. He shall do that which he is advised to do: I
grant ^t. But that is little, because the praise consists not in the deed,
but in the manner how it is done. What is more odious then a sumptuous supper,
whereupon a man spends a Knights living? What is more worthy of censure then
if a man (as these gluttons say) bestow this upon himself and his Genius? and
yet have there been some persons, both very sober and temperate, that in such
extraordinary banquets have spent the sum of seventy five thousand crowns.
If for gormandize sake a man lauisheth in this expense, it is hateful; if it
be to honor any great and noble assembly, it may be borne withal, for it is
no excess but a solemn expense. The Emperor Tiberius having received a
Barbell of a wonderful greatness: (shall I set down the weight to awake
gourmands? for it is said that it weighed more then four pounds and a half)
commanded it to be carried to the market and sold, saying to those that kept
him company at that time; My friends, I am much deceived, but either APICIVS or
P. OCTAVIUS will buy this Barbell. But there fell out far more then he
expected; for they set the Barbell to be cried, and it was sold to him that
offered most. Octauius bare it away, and was highly prised amongst his
adherents, because he had bought a Barbell which the Emperor had sold, and
Apicius could not buy it for two hundredth crowns, or thereabouts. It was a
shame for Octauius to disburse so much money, not for him that bought it to
send it to Tiberius, although I would not excuse him. He admired the thing
which he thought Caesar worthy of. A man sits by his friend that is sick: I
allow it; but if he do it in hope to be his heir, he is a Vulture, he
expects carrion. The same things are both honest and dishonest: but it
imports to know wherefore, or how. But all things will be done honestly, if
we addic^ ou^ selves thereunto, and judge it with the dependances thereof, to
be the only good of humane life, the rest are good but for a short time. We
must therefore imprint in our hearts a lesson that extends it self to the
whole life: this is that which I call a decree. Such as this persuasion is,
such shall those things be which shall be either done or thought. And such as
these shall be, such shall be the life. It is but a small matter for him that
would rule the whole, to give counsel that it should be distributed into
parts. M. Brutus in his book he entitled (...), gives many precepts both to
father and mother, children and brothers, which no man shall perform as he
ought, except he have some rule whereunto he may have relation. Let us propose
unto our selves a scope or sovereign good, at which we aim, and to which we
addr^sse al our thoughts and life, as the Mariners ought to shape their course
under the aspect of some certain star. Life without a limit is extrauagant:
if this limit must be proposed, the rules that show us the same, begin to be
necessary. Thou will confess this, as I suppose, that there is nothing more
shameful, then to see a man that is doubtful, irresolute, fearful, that now
sets forward, and then slides backward. This will befall us in all things, if
we do not rent away that imprisoneth and restrains our understandings, and
that hinders them from stirring at their pleasure. It is a usual thing to
teach the manner how to serve the gods. We forbid men to light lamps on the
Sabbath days, because the gods have no want of light, and men take no pleasure
in smoke. We forbid men from doing their reuerences and salutations in the
morning, and permit no man to sit at the Temple gates; for humane ambition is
baited and caught by these offices. He that knows God, serves and hononreth
him. We forbid men to bring sheets and bathing-combs to Jupiter, or to hold a
glass before Juno. God seeks no Ministers. Why not? He ministereth to
mankind. Each where is he ready and addressed to help all men. Although he
hear, how he ought to behave himself in sacrifices, and estrange himself
from curious and troublesome superstitions; yet would all this be nothing to
his perfection, except he have conceived in his understanding a god, such as
he ought to apprehend him, namely, such a one as has all things, that gives
all things, and bestows his benefits gratice. But who inciteth the gods to
do all these goods for men? Their nature. He erreth, whosoever thinks that
they will do hurt. They cannot, neither can they receive or do injury. For
to hurt, and to be hurt, are things conioynt and have relation the one unto the
other. That sovereign and fair nature above all has exempted those men from
dangers, which are not dangerous. Moreover, the first service due unto the
gods, is to believe that they are next to acknowledge their majesty and
bounty, without which their majesty were nothing. To know that they are those
that govern the world, who temper all things as their own, who have all men
under their protection, and are sometimes curious of private men. These neither
give, nor have evil, although they chastise, repress, and afflict, and punish
likewise some men at sometime, under appearance of evil. Will thou have the
gods favorable unto thee? Be a good man. He gives them sufficiently that
imitateth them. Here follows another question, how we ought to use and serve
men. What do we? What precepts give we? To shed no humane blood? How small a
matter is it not to hurt him, whom thou ought to profit? Truly it is
worthy much praise for one man to be kind unto another. Shall we command him
to succor the shipwracked, to bring the wanderer into his way, to divide his
bread with the hungry? What need I to specify all that which it behooves him
to do or fly, when as in three words I will propose a form of humane
offices? All this world, in which all divine and humane things are enclosed, is
but one: we are the members and parcels of this great body. Nature has
created us akin, in forming us of the same elements, and in the same enclosure.
She has planted mutual love in our hearts, and made us sociable. She it is
that has composed justice and equity, and by her ordinance it is a more
miserable thing to do, then to suffer injury. By her command are his hands
addressed, that helps and comfort another. Let us have this verse in our
hearts, and in our mouths. I am a man, and think this true to be,
That nothing humane is estranged from me.
Let us possess this common good, that we are borne. Man's society resembles a
vault of stone, which would fall except the stones resisted one another; so
that by this means it is sustained. After gods and men, let us behold how we
ought to use these things: unprofitable should our precepts be, if first of all
we knew not what opinion we ought to have of every thing, as of poverty,
riches, glory, ignominy, our country and banishment. Let us esteem every one
of them without respect of common apprehension, and let us examine what they
be, not what they are called. Let us pass over to virtues. Some one would
require that we should prise prudence, that we should respect valor, that we
should love temperance, and that (if it might be) we should join our selves
unto justice more strictly, then unto the rest. But this would be to no
purpose, if we be ignorant what virtue is, if there be one or many, if they be
separated or united, if he that possesses one of them has all, and how the
one differs from the other. It is not needful now for a Smith to enquire
what the beginning and use of his art is, nor for a Iester to examine what the
art of dancing is. All these occupations know themselves, they want nothing,
because they appertain not to the whole life. But Virtue is the science both
of others and of her self, we must learn of her, to the end we may understand
what we ought to will. If the will be not good, the action which proceeds
from the same shall never be. Furthermore, the will shall be perverse, if the
habitude of the spirit be not upright, because that from that the will has his
being; and this hab^te of mind shall not be in the best state, if it
comprehends not all the rules of life (considering the judgment which a man
ought to have of every thing) and shut them all within the circle of truth. The
contentment of the spirit is a good that befalls no man, except those that
are endowed with a certain and immovable indgement. The rest of men slip,
fall, and sometimes or other rise again, and do but float betwixt that which
they have omitted, and that which they desired. The cause of this tossing and
shaking is, because having builded upon common report, which is a wondrous and
uncertain manner of living, they are assured and confident in nothing. If thou will always have the same will, thou must will those things that are true.
There is no way to attain truth without Maxims, for they contain life, good
and evil, honest and dishonest things, just and unjust, pious and impious,
virtue and the uses of virtue, the possession of things commodious,
existimation and dignity, health, force, form, and sagacitie of the senses;
all these require such a one as can judge of them, and knows at what price
they ought to be taxed. For thou abusest thy self, and think that some
things are of greater value then they be, and the more art thou deceived, in
prising riches, credit, and power (as many other of thy rank do) which are
not to be accounted worth any thing. Thou shall not know this, if thou
respectest not rule, whereby these things are estimated amongst themselves.
Even as leaves cannot flourish by themselves, but require a bough whereunto
they may cleave, and from whence they may draw juice and nourishment: so these
precepts decay and vanish, if they be alone, they will be affixed and grounded
upon Maxims. Besides, they understand not who take away decrees, that they are
confirmed by that very means, whereby they are extinguished? For what say
they? that life is sufficiently addressed by precepts: and that the decrees and
principal rules of wisdom are superfluous. But this which they say is a
decree as true, as if I should now say that we ought to give over precepts, and
only rely upon Maxims, in denying the use of precepts, I should recommend the
same by this precept of mine. Some things there are that content themselves
with a simple admonition of Philosophy, othersome that would be proved: and
some there are, that are so confused, that hardly and without great search a
man cannot understand their true sense: if proofs be necessary, so are
decrees likewise, which gather the truth by arguments. Some matters are easy,
other some are obscure. Those are easy and open, which are comprehended by
sense and memory, and those obscure which are not subject thereunto. But
Reason contenteth not her self with things that are manifest. The greatest and
most beautiful part thereof, is grounded on that which is hidden. Those things
that are hidden require proof, proof is not without decrees; decrees
therefore are necessary. The persuasion and apprehension of certain things,
without which all our thoughts are uncertain and without stay, is that which
perfecteth the common sense, and makes it accomplished. Whence it follows
that decrees are necessary, which give unto the mind an inflexible judgment.
In brief, when we exhort any man to esteem his friend as much as himself,
let him think that his enemy may be made his friend, that he increase more
and more the friendship he bears unto the one, and moderate his hatred
toward the other; we add thereunto that it is just and honest. But this
honesty and equity is comprised, in the reason of our decrees or rules. It is
therefore necessary, without the which the other cannot be. But let us join
the general rules and precepts together, for both without the root the boughs
are unprofitable, and the roots themselves are aided by those branches they
have produced. No man can be ignorant what profit the hands have in them, for
they manifestly help. That heart whereby the hands live, from whence they take
their forces, by which they are moved, lies hidden. The same can I say of
precepts; they are open, but the decrees of wisdom are hidden. As there are
none but such as profess, that know the mysteries of sacred things: so
likewise in Philosophy, the secrets of the same are not discovered, but to
such persons as are admitted and received into her sanctuary: but precepts and
such other things, even those that are profane know the^ Posidonius judges,
that not only preception (for nothing prohibiteth us to use this word) but also
persuasion, consolation, and exhortation are necessary. To these he adds the
inquisition of causes, which why should we not be bold to call the character,
as well as the Grammarians, who in their own right term themselves the
maintainers and keepers of the Latin tongue I see no cause. He says that the
description of every virtue will be necessary. This does Posidonius call
AEnologia, the Grecians (...), which expresses the signs and notes of every
virtue and vice, whereby those things that are alike may be discerned the one
from the other. This has the same force as the proposition of precepts. For he
that gives precepts, says, Thou shall do thus, if thou will be temperate. He
who describes, says, The temperate man is he that does these things, and
abstaineth from those. Ask thou me what the difference is? The one gives
precepts of virtue, the other example. I confess that these descriptions, and
to use the words of the Publicans, (...), that is to say, marks proceed from
use. Let us propose laudable things, and we shall find such as will follow
them. Think thou that it is profitable to have instructions given thee how
to know a generous Horse, left thou be deceived, and thou buy a sluggard and a
Jade. How much more profitable is this, to know the marks of an excellent
mind, whereby thou may be able to apply them to thy self. Vir^^l 3^
Georg^^^^^m.
The goodly coult bred from a noble race
Begins to grow amiddest the spacious fields,
And proudly over hill and dale does pace,
His force unto no threatening torrent yields,
The seas unknown he swimmes and never fears,
The threatening brooks; his force and courage proud,
To further kinds increase is daily bent,
No sooner tempts his ear the trumpet loud,
Or clattering arms some future war present:
But straight he startles beating of the ground
With horny hoof, his ears are pricked upright,
He shakes his joints, he does coruet and bound,
He snortes and puffes, with foam his bit is white.
Our Virgil, under the similitude of a horse, describes a man of great mind.
For mine own part, I would not give any other portraiture of a great
personage. If I should represent Cato dreadlesse, and assured amongst the
noices of civil wars, being the first that charged and skirmished with the
companies already approaching the Alps, and running before the ruin of the
Commonweal, I would assign him no other countenance, no other habit. Truly
no man could engage himself further then he, who at one time made head against
Caesar and Pompey, and defied them both, and showed that the Commonweal had
some partakers. For it is a small matter to say of Cato, Nor fears rumors
false.
Why? because he cared not for evident and true conspiracies. Did he not in
despite of ten Legions entertained and mustered from France, and from other
foreign troops, intermixed with the Romans, speak freely, and exhort his
Citizens to maintain their liberty, and to try all means, yea to hazard
death it self, rather then to lose their liberty; it being more honest for
them to fall into servitude by constraint, then by their own wills to go unto
it. How great vigor and spirit was there in him, what confidence when the rest
of the Commonweal was confused? He knows that the question is not of his
estate; that it concerns not him, that the question is not whether Cato be
free, but whether he be amongst freemen. Thence grows it that he disdaineth
dangers and drawn swords. In admiration of the invincible constancy of this
person, confirmed in his constancy amiddest the ruins of his Country, I will
say in imitation of Virgil, that Cato had A mighty mind, high, stout, and
generous.
It shall do well, not only to express who they are, that have been
accustomed to be good men, and to represent some counterfeit of them, but also
to recount and particularly set down that last and valourous wound of Catoes,
through the which liberty it self lost her life. Likewise the wisdom of
Laelius, and the good accord betwixt him and his friend Scipio, The brave
actions both public and particular of Marcus Cato, surnamed Censor, the
Couches of Tubero made of plain wood, set in open view, covered with Goats
skins, and the vessels of earth wherein they were served at the table, who
banquetted before the Chapel of Jupiter: what other thing was this, but to
consecrat^ poverty before the Capitol? Had I no other action of Tuberos, but
this, to rank him in the number of the Catoes. Think you this to be a small
matter? This was no banquet, but a Censure, O how little knew these ambitious
men what this censure is, and how it ought to be desired! In that day the Roman
people beheld many rich and sumptuous moueables, but admired none but the
vtensiles of this one man. All their gold and silver has been broken and
melted a thousand times, but Tuberoes vessels of earth shall endure for ever.

EPIST. XCVI.
Against complainers, and that all things should come from Fate and God. Why
therefore are we displeased? Let us obey them, or rather assent unto them.

WHence proceed these despights and plaints? Know thou not that in all the
evils of this life, there is but one evil, which is when thou art displeased,
and complainest? If thou ask mine advice, I think there is not any misery in
a man, except he think that there is something miserable in the nature of
things. I endure not my self that day wherein I can suffer nothing. Am I
sick? it is a part of my destiny. Is my family afflicted with infirmities?
Does usury offend me, my house crack over me? Am I assaulted by dangers,
wounds, travails, and fears? This happens ordinarily, this is a small
matter, this should be done, these are not casual, they are decreed. If thou
think me to be a true man, when I discover freely unto thee what I think,
know that in all accidents which seem adverse and hard, I am so formed. I obey
not God forcibly but freely, I follow him with a free heart, and not enforced.
Nothing shall ever befall me, that I will entertain sorrowful or with sad
countenance, I will pay no tribute unwillingly. All those things which we
grieve at, for which we fear, are the tributes of life: neither hope thou (my
Lucillius) neither demand thou an exemption from the fury. A pain of the
bladder has tormented thee. This banquet has little pleasure in it; these are
continual passions. I will ^ome more nearer, thou have been put in fear of
thy life. But know thou not that in desiring to be old, thou desire such
incommodities as are ordinary in a long life; as in a long way we find dust,
dirt, and rain? But I would live and feel no discommoditie, whatsoever. So
effeminate a speech becomes not a man. Consider how thou will entertain this
vow of mine, which I protest with a great and generous mind, never let the
gods and goddesses permit, that prosperity make thee a wanton. Ask thy self,
if (by permission of any god) thou might have thy choice which of these two
thou would acc^pt, either to live in a Shambles, or in an Army. But our
life (my Lucillius) is but a warfare. They therefore who are tossed, that mount
and descend from rocks and high places, that execute dangerous commissions,
ought to be reputed valiant men, and chiefest in the Army. But they, who
whilst their companions travail, repose themselves at their pleasures in all
delights, are effeminate and nothing worth, who live at pleasure to do wrong
unto other men, and to meet with it themselves one day.

EPIST. XCVII.
That both now and in times past were evil men^ he deduceth example from the
judgment of CLODIVS, which he corrupted by bribes and adulteries. After this
of the force of conscience, and that by her offenses are condemned, and also
punished by an internal whip and gnawe.

THou abusest thy self, my Lucilius, if thou think that dissoluteness, and
neglect of good manners, and other vices which every man reproves in the age
wherein he lives, are the imperfections of our age. It is not the time but the
men that are to be blamed for this. No age has been free from vice; and if
thou beginnest to estimate the liberty and looseness of every time I am
ashamed to say it. Never did the world offend more openly then before Cato. Can
any man believe, that money was stirring in that judgment, wherein Clodius was
accused for that adultery which he had secretly committed with Caesar's wife,
violating the ceremonies of that sacrifice, which was said to be made for the
people, from the sight whereof all men are so much exempted (for only women
are admitted to attend the same) that the very pictures of male beasts were
covered likewise. But money was given to the Judges, and (that which is more
villainous then all the rest) there were some that exacted in way of salarie,
the license to violate Matrons and young Noblemen. More sin was there
committed in absoluing then acting the crime. He that was guilty of adultery,
divided adulteries; neither was he secured of his life, before such time, as he
had made his Judges like unto himself. These things were done in that
judgment, wherein Cato (if naught else) gave in testimony in the cause: I
will set down Ciceroes very words, because the thing exceeds all belief;
He sent for those persons that were required at his hands, he promised, he
entreated, he gave. But now O good Gods, what wickedness? Some of the Judges
in overplus of their pains, lay with and passed the night with certain^ women,
and young Noblemen that were brought unto them. I have no mind to enquire how
much money they received. There was more in that which succeeded. Will thou
have the wife of that severe fellow Cato? or of such a one who is rich, that is
to say Crassus? thou shall lie with her. When thou have committed the adultery
condemn the crime. That fair less which thou desire shall come unto thee^
I promise thee that she shall accompany thee this night, neither will I delay
thee; I will perform my word within four and twenty hours. It is more to
distribute adulteries, then to commit them. That is to give summons to all the
Matrons, that to delude them. These Judges of Clodius required a guard at the
Senates hands, whereof they had no need except in condemning the faulty, yet
was it granted unto them. By means whereof, after they had absolved Clodius
they were wittily scoffed at by CATVLVS; To what intent, said he, required you
a guarde at our hands? Was it for fear lest your money should be taken from
you? Yet amidst all these jests, and before the sentence was given, the
adulterer remained unpunished: during the process this ba^de maintained
himself, committing (to the end he might warrantize himself from punishment)
a more greater wickedness then the former, for which he should have been
condemned. Beleeuest thou that any age was more corrupted then that wherein
lust could neither be repressed by piety nor by justice? under which in the
extraordinary inquiry made by decree of the Senate, there was more great
villainy committed, then that which was then in question. The inquiry was,
whether after an adultery any man might live securely in Rome? And it appeared
that he could not be secure without adultery. This was done between Pompey and
Caesar, Cicero and Cato; that Cato, I mean, who sitting by to behold the
games, the common people durst not demand that the common sports called
Florales should be given them, wherein common and naked strumpets were
publicly presented. Think thou that men have been more severe to behold,
then to give sentence? Such excesses have and will be committed, and the
liberty and licentiousness of Cities (never by it self) but by good laws
and sharp punishments shall be extinguished. Thou art not therefore to believe
that in these days only, the laws have little credit, and licentiousness
much. The younger sort in this time are not so disordered as in times past, when
he that was guilty denied the adultery before the Judges, and the Judges
confess the same before him that was faulty, when as in regard of the cause
that was to be adjudged, whoredoms and villainies were committed, when Clodius
being well befriended for those Palliardises that made him guilty for all
allegations furnished with harlots to justify for him. Can any man believe
this? He that was condemned in one adultery was absolved by many. Every Judge
will a^foord us such as Clodius, but not such as Cato. All of us are pliable to
the worst, because therein we shall neither want a guide or companion; and were
it we should fail them, the matter of it self goes ouer-forward without
companion: the way unto vices is not only ready but headlong. But the greatest
evil that I see, and that makes men incurable is, that Artsmen and such as
are learned are ashamed if they happen to err in the exercise of their Arts
and professions, where contrariwise a wicked man takes pleasure in his sins.
The Pilot rejoices not if his Ship be ouerturned, the Physician is sad if his
Patient die, the Orator is pensive if for want of good pleading his clyent
loose the cause; but contrariwise, all men take pleasure in their sins. This
man rejoices in his adultery, especially when he has compassed the same with
great labor: another takes pleasure in his deceit and theft, it is not the
sin that displeases him, but the punishment he has had for committing it. See
here the fruit of evil custom: Otherwise to let thee know, that in
consciences (yea, even those that are most corrupted) there remains some
sense of goodness, and that shame consists not in the concealing, but the
neglect of those that do evil, there is not one that dissembleth and covers
it not: and if he chance to obtain that which he pretends, yet would he not
be called a whoremonger or thief, although he had both committed adultery and
theft. But a good conscience will appear and be seen. Wickedness is afraid
of darkness it self. In my mind therefore Epic^rus has spoken very fitly:
A man that is guilty may hide himself, but he cannot believe that he is
hidden. Or if thou think that this sense may be better explicated by these
means; It therefore profits not those that sin to lie hidden: for although
they have the means to hide themselves, yet have they no assurance. So it is,
iniquities may be concealed, but not assured. I suppose that this is not
repugnant to our sect if it be thus explicated. Why? Because the first and
gre^test punishment of wicked men, is that they have committed wickedness;
neither is there any heinous crime, though never so much boulstred out by
humane prosperity, or countenanced and defenced by fortune that remains
unpunished, because the punishment of wickedness is in the wickedness it
self. Mean while, she and her punishment are seconded and attended by another
chasticement, that is to say, with affright and continual fear, accompanied
with a distrust of his own ^ecuritie. Why should I deliver impiety from this
punishment? Why should I not leave her always in suspense. Let us dissent from
Epicurus in this where he says nothing is just by nature, and that crimes are
to be avoided, because the fear may not be eschued. Herein let us agree with
him, that an evil conscience scourges these heinous faults, and that she is a
terrible torture, being pressed and beaten continually with perpetual care,
because she cannot put trust in those that would make her believe that she is
in repose. For this is the argument of Epicurus, that by nature we abhor from
wickedness, because there is no man how much soever he be secured that fears
not. Fortune delivers many men from punishment, no man from fear. Why?
because there is a certain hatred infixed in our hearts against that thing
which nature condemns. And therefore it is why those who hide themselves are
never assured in their lurking places, because their conscience reproves them,
and discloseth themselves to themselves. But the property of such as are
guilty, is to tremble. It would be ill for us, because that diverse enormities
escape the law and maiestrate and the written punishments, if these natural
and grievous punishments did not instantly pay the wicked, and if fear had not
taken place and succeeded repentance.

EPIST. XCVIII.
That we ought only to trust internal goods, and that the rest com and go.
That this is to be meditated upon, and that all things ought to be considered
and esteemed as transitory, The mind therefore is to be prepared to the loss
of such things, and to be confirmed in patience. Why not? Other men have
suffered the like. Follow thou their example, nay more, be thou the example thy
self. Assuredly this is one amongst his good and profitable Epistles.

Never believe thou that any man is happy, whose felicity is in suspense. He
builds upon uncertainties, that rejoices in casualties; for the joy that
has entered will quickly fleet away. But that which proceeds from it self
is both faithful and firm, and increases, and prosecuteth even unto the end.
The rest, which the common sort admire, are good for a time. What then? May not
they serve and give pleasure? Who denies it? But so as they depend on us, not
we on them. All whatsoever fortune beholds became fruitful and pleasant in
this sort, if he that possesses them be Master of himself likewise, and is
not subject to that which he has. For they are deceived, my Lucilius, that
think that fortune gives us either any thing that is good or evil. He gives
us the matter of goods and evils, and the beginnings of things, which shall
either have a happy or unhappy issue with us. For the mind is stronger then
any fortune, he conducteth his affairs, either right or wrong, he is himself
the cause of his contented or miserable life. An evil man conuerteth all
things to the worst, yea, even those things which happened with appearance of
great good. An upright and good conscience corrects the infirmities of
fortune, and mollifieth those things which are hard and untoward by his
knowledge how to suffer, and the same man most gratefully and modestly
entertaineth prosperity, and constantly and courageously adversity, who
although he be prudent, although he does all things with an exact judgment,
although he attempt nothing above his strength, yet that entire good which is
settled and exempted from the threats of fortune does not befall him, except he
be assured against whatsoever is uncertain. Whether it be thou will observe
others (for the judgment is most free in other men's affairs) or whether
leaving partiality a part, thou will behold thy self, thou shall both think
and confess this, that no one of these goods which are desired and prised is
profitable, except thou arm thy self against lightness, and those things
that depend on casualtie, except that often and without complaint thou speak
thus in every one of thy losses. It is the pleasure of the gods that it should
go otherwise. Or rather that I may report a speech more strong and just,
whereby thy mind may be more enabled, say thus when as any thing has fallen
out otherwise then thou thoughtest: The gods send better. Being thus composed,
nothing shall be casual: and so shall he be composed, if they shall but
imagine what the variety of humane affairs may, before he feel it, if he so
possess his children, his wife and patrimony, as if he should not always have
them, and as if he should not be more miserable for this cause, if he should be
forced to lose them. Wretched is that mind that is tormented with that which
is to succeed, and before miseries is he miserable who is careful, that those
things wherein he takes delight should continue with him to his end: for he
shall never be in quiet, and in expectation of the future, he shall lose the
present which he might enjoy. But the grief of the thing that is lost, and the
fear of that which is to be lost, are both ^quall. Neither therefore do I
command thee to be negligent. But decline thou from those things that are to be
feared, and foresee all that which prudence may foresee: consider and prevent
that thing which may offend thee long time before it happen. To this ef^ect thy
confidence will serve thee greatly, and thy certain resolution to support all
accidents. He can beware of fortune that can suffer fortune: undoubtedly he
never stormeth in his tranquillity. It is a misery and extreme folly to be
always in fear; what folly is this to go before a man's evil? In brief, to
let thee know that in a word, which I think I will describe unto thee, these
busybodies, and tormenters of themselves: they are as intemperate in their
miseries as they were before them. He grieueth more then he needs, that
grieueth before he needs; for by the same infirmity he estimateth not his
grief, whe^eby he expects it not; with the same intemperance he faineth to
himself pe^petuall felicity, he imagines that all these things that have
be^alne him, should not only endure but increase and forgetting that all
humane things are both tossed and changed, which is while he promises himself
only an assured estate in his casualties. I find then that Metrodorus spoke
very fitly, when in a letter he sent unto his sister to comfort her in the
death of her son, which was a child of great hope, he said that all the
goods of mortal men are mortal. Of these goods speaks he which men so much
affect and ^locke after; for the true good perishes not, wisdom and virtue
are certain and eternal, these only are the immortal goods that have
befalne mortal men. But men are so unhappy, and so far forgetful whether
they go, whether every day draws them unto, that they wonder if they lose
any thing, being assu^ed one day to lose all. Whatsoever it be that thou art
called Master of, know that it is not thine, although thou possess it. Thou
art infirm and mortal, there is nothing then in this world that is firm and
immortal for thee. It is as necessary our goods should perish as be lost, and
if we take heed it is a great comfort to lose those goods with a settled and
resolute mind, which must perish. What remedy then shall we find out against
these losses? This, that we may keep in memory such things as are lost,
neither suffer the fruit of them, which we have gotten by them, to perish with
them. To have may be taken from us; to have had, never. Most ungrateful is he,
who when he has lost, owes nothing for that he has received. Casualty takes
our substance from us, but leaves the use and fruit thereof with us, which we
lose by the iniquity of our desire. Say unto thy self; Of these things that
seem so terrible, nothing is invincible. Many there are that have overcome
each one o^ them, M^tius the ^ire, Regulus the cross, Socrates poison,
Rutillius banishment. Cato death enforced by his own sword. Let us likewise
get some victory: moreover, those things which allow and entice the common
sort, under appearance of beauty and happiness, have by many and oftentimes bin
contemned. Fabricius being chief of the army^ rejected riches, and being
Censor condemned them. Tubero judged poverty to be worthy both of himself and
the Capitol, when as using earthen pots in his public supper, he showed that
man ought to content himself with that, wh^rwith the gods disdained not to be
sometimes served. Sextius the Father, a man fit to govern the affairs of a
Commonweal, refused all honorable Offices, and would not accept the dignity
of a Senator, which Julius Caesar had presented him, knowing well that
whatsoever may be given, may be taken away. Let us likewise do some of these
things valiantly. Let us rank our selves as exemplar men among the rest. Why
are we faint-hearted? Why despair we? Whatsoever might be done, can be done.
Let us now purge our minds, and follow Nature, for he that erreth and strayeth
from her must of force, desire, and fear, and be a slave to casualties. We may
return into the way, we have liberty to recover our constancy. Let us be
restored, that we may endure grief^s, in what manner soever they assail our
bodies; and say unto Fortune, Thou have to deal with a man, search out some
other, a man whom thou may overcome. By these sayings and such like, the
force of that ulcer is appeased, whereof I desire either ease or recure, or
strength to support and wax old with the same. But I am secure of him; the
question is of our loss, whereby a worthy old man is taken from us. For he is
full of life, who desires that nothing should be added unto him for his own
cause, but for theirs to whom he is profitable. He does liberally, because he
lives. Another ere this had finished all these troubles: this man thinks it
as foul a thing to shun death, as to seek after death. What then, shall he
not forsake it, if he be persuaded thereunto? Why should he not forsake it? If
no man now has any further use of him, if he have no business but to wait
upon pain. This (my Lucillius) is to learn Philosophy in art and to be
exercised in the truth, to see what mind a prudent man has against death,
against dolor, when the one approaches, the other presses him. That which is
to be done, is to be learned of him that does it. Hitherto we have debated by
arguments, whether any man may resist pain, or death likewise may humble great
minds, when it assaileth them. What need many words? The thing discovers it
self, let us travel thereunto: neither does death make him more stronger
against pain, neither pain confirm him against death, he armeth himself
against both; neither patiently greeueth he in hope of death, neither dies he
willingly through the tediousness of pain; he endures the one, he respects
the other.

EPIST. XCIX.
A consolatorie Epistle upon the death of his son, undoubtedly both wise and
eloquent.

I Have sent thee that Epistle which I wrote unto Marulus, when as he had lost
his little son, and was said to be ouerpassionate and grieved for his loss:
wherein I have not observed my usual custom, neither thought I it fit to
handle him gently, when as he was more worthy of reproof then consolation. For
to him that is afflicted and unable to support a great wound, some little way
must be given. Let him satisfy himself, or at leastwise upon the first brunt
power out tears abundantly. They that give liberty to themselves to sorrow
and lament, let them forthwith be chastised, and taught, that there are some
follies even in tears. Do thou expect consolations, receive reproves. Do
thou endure thy sons death so effeminately? What would thou do had
thou lost thy friend. Thy young infant of uncertain hope, and very little, is
departed: a handful of time is lost. We seek out occasions to lament, we
exclaim, although unjustly against Fortune, as though she would not afford us
just causes of complaint. Truly in esteem that thou were already as animated
sufficiently against solid and great evils, and consequently against shadows
and appearances of miseries, for which men mourn for custom sake. Had thou
lost thy friend, which is the greatest loss of all others, thou should
endeavor to rejoice more because thou had him, then to mourn for that thou
have lost him. But many there are that reckon not what courtesies they have
received and comfort they have conceived by their friends. Amongst other
miseries sorrow has this, that it is not only superfluous, but ungrateful
also. Having therefore enioied so good a friend, have thou lost thy time? So
many years, so great a unity, such familiar society in study: are all these
vanished without effect: Do thou bury thy friendship with thy friend?
Wherefore mournest thou if his presence has been so profitable unto thee?
Believe, the greater part of those whom we have loved remains with us,
although casualtie has taken them from us. The time already passed is ours,
neither is there any thing more securely lodged, then that which has been. We
are ungrateful in regard of those things we have received under hope of that
to come; as if that which is to come (if so be it prove successful unto us)
should not quickly pass into that which is past. To straightly limitteth he
the fruits of humane life, who only rejoices in those things that are
present. Both those things that are to come, and those things that are past,
do delight the one with expectation, the other in memory, but that which is
to come is in suspense, and may not be done, as touching that which is past, it
is impossible but that it has been. What madness is it then, to leave that
which is most certain? Let us content our selves with that we have, provided
that we have not drawn with a hollow understanding, which lets that pass
which he has already apprehended. There are infinite examples of those, who
without tears have interred their young children, who upon their return from
the funerals, have entered the Senate house, or entertained some public
office, and suddenly occupied themselves about some other business, and that
upon good occasion. For first of all it is lost time to grieve, if sorrow
profit nothing. Secondly, it is an unjust thing to complain of that which has
befallen one, and must befall all those that are to follow after. Moreover, it
is a folly to wish, or to lament, when there is so little difference between
death and him that lamenteth the same^ For the which cause we ought to have the
more repose in our hearts, because we shall follow them whom we have lost.
Behold with what swiftne^^e time posteth away: think upon this short race
whither we run so swiftly. Consider this great company of mankind, which
tends to the same end, conuersing and living together, distinguished by small
spaces, even then when they seem most greatest. He whom thou think dead, is
but gone before. But what madness is it to bewail him that went before thee,
when as thou thy self must travel the same journey after him? Does a man
bewail that thing which he knew should happen? Or if he thought that man
should not die, he deceived himself. Some man bewaileth a thing which he said
could not choose but be done? Whosoever bewaileth the death of any man,
bewaileth that he was a man. All men are tied to one condition, he that
happened to be borne, must die. By spaces we are distinguished, by death
equalled. That which happens between our first and last day, is diverse and
uncertain. If thou estimate the troubles, it is ouer-long for a child: if the
swiftnes, it is too short for an old man. There is nothing that is not
incertaine and deceiuable, and more light then the wind. All things are
tossed, and are transferred into their contrary by the power of Fortune, and in
so great inconstancy of humane affairs, there is nothing certain to any man
but his death. Yet all men complain of that, wherein no man is deceived. But
he died a child. I say not yet, that he is better dealt withal that is dead.
Let us pas^e over to him that is old, how short is the time wherein he has
out-stripped an infant? Propose unto thy self this great extent of years, and
comprehend all the ages that are past, then make comparison with that which we
call man's life, with that infinity of years, and then shall thou see how
little a thing all that is which we desire, and extend. Consider how much
tears, cares, death so oftentimes wished for, before it comes, sicknesses,
fears, foolish infancy, wanton youth, and unprofitable years do possess,
and de^our the portions of our life, we lose the half in sleeping. Let us add
hereunto travels, sorrows, and perils, and thou shall see that in the most
longest life which a man can observe, that which is called living, is the
smallest portion of the same. But who will not grant thee this, that he is in
better state that may quickly turn to dust; whose journey is at an end before
he be weary? Life is neither good nor evil, it is the place of good and
evil. So has he lost nothing but the eye which is more certain to our harms
then good. He might have become both modest and prudent, he might have been
formed by thy care and instruction to be more virtuous, but (that which may
most justly be feared) he might have been made like to the most part of men.
Mark me those young Gentlemen of great houses, who by their intemperance are
brought to that misery that they are become fencers. Consider those others,
who lewdly defile both their own and others bodies, which ouerslip not a day
wherein they are not drunk, or defamed for some other notable infamy. Then
shall thou see that there was more to be feared then hoped for. For which cause
thou ought not summon to thy self these causes of sorrow, nor in vexing thy
self heap up incommodities, and of light and slight ones, as they be, to make
them insufferable. I counsel thee to resist thy sorrow, and to urge it,
neither have I so bad an opinion of thee, that thou would call to aid all
thy virtue against those difficulties which present themselves. This is no true
grief, but a slight touching, thou make it true grief, undoubtedly
Philosophy has done thee great service, if thou bewaylest with a resolute
heart a child better known unto his nourse then to his father. Well then, will
I have thee seized of a heart of iron? and is it my mind that thou should
look up cheerely in the funerals of thy son? and will I not suffer thee to
let thy mind relent a little? By no means. For this were inhumanity, not
virtue, to behold the dead with the same eye that we do the living, and not
to be moved when as the one is thus separated from the other. Behold what it
is which I forbid. There are things which in a manner are out of our power.
Tears fall from the eyes of certain men that would feign contain them, and
these tears thus shed do lighten the heart: what is there to be done in such
a case? Let us suffer them to fall, but let us not command them. Let them
drop as long as a^fection commands them to flow, but not as much as
custom and other men's example does require. But let us add nothing unto
sorrow, neither let us augment it by other men's examples. This ostentation of
sorrow exacteth more then the sorrow it self. How few are sorrowful to
themselves? If they suppose that men hear them, they cry out more earnestly;
but being by themselves, they are quiet, and as soon as any other saluteth
them, then recommence they their sorrow, then beat they their head with their
hands, which they might have done more freely when no man forbad them; then
wish they themselves dead, then toss they upon their pallets: when the
beholder is gone, the sorrow cease. In this affair as in others, we are won
by an evil custom, we follow the example of our neighbors, and compose our
selves by their example, and not by that which best becomes us. We neglect
nature, and addict our selves to the fashions of the common people, which are
both ignorant and corrupt, and who in this as in all other things, is
inconstant of inconstantest. If they see any man confident in his calamity,
they call him impious and brutish: if they see another dismayde, that
respects nothing but his body, they term him a weak and an effeminate man.
All things therefore are to be reduced within the list of reason. But there is
no one more greater folly then to get fame by affected sadness, and to approve
it by tears, which I consider in two kinds in regard of a wiseman, the one
issuing of themselves, the others permitted to flow. I will show thee what
difference there is: As Soon as we hear the news of our deceased friend, when
as we behold his body, ready to be transported to the fire from our embraces,
natural necessity extorteth tears, and the spirit being impelled by the
stroke of sorrow, even as it shakes the whole ^ody, so sucketh it, and
expels from the eyes the tear^s that are at hand. These tears are extorted
as they fall, and flow against our wills. Some other there are which we give
way to, when as any man makes mention of those whom they have lost. In this
heaviness there is found some sweetness, when we remember our selves of their
pleasant discourse, of their agreeable conversation, of their charitable piety,
then do our eyes open and pour forth tears, as it were in joy. To these we
give allowance, by these we are overcome. Restrain not therefore, neither give
liberty to thy tears, by reason of those that assist thee, or attend upon
thee, be it that either they are dried up, or drop down, there is no shame in
them, provided that they be not fained. Let them flow of thems^lues, and they
may flow in men temperate and well composed. Oft-times they have flowed without
any prejudice to a wise-mans authority, with so much temperance, that there
neither wanted humanity, or were disallowed in dignity. It is lawful, say I,
to obey nature without the blemish of gravity. I have seen men that were
venerable in the funerals of their children, in whose looks their love was
testified toward their dead children, without any vain ostentation of
grieuing. There was not any thing which testified not a simple and natural
affection. There is a certain decorum, even in sorrow which ought to be
observed by a wiseman. And as in other things, so likewise in tears there is
somewhat that is sufficient: unwise men, as in their joys, so keep they no
measure in their sorrows. Accommodate thy self peaceably unto necessity.
What incredible matter or nouelty has fallen out? How many men are there, whose
funerals have been celebrated, whose bodies have been embalmed and
embowelled, and who weepeth for them? As oftentimes as thou shall remember that
thy dead child was an infant, think also that he was a mortal creature, to
whom nothing certain was promised, whom fortune was not obliged to bring up to
old age, but to forsake then when it best liked her. But speak of him
oftentimes, and celebrate his memory as much as thou can, which oftentimes
will be refreshed in thee, if it may salute thee without bitterness. For no
man willingly conuerseth with a sorrowful man, much less with sorrow. If thou
remember any speeches of his, if thou have during his infancy, heard any jests
of his to thy contentment, repeat them often, and constantly a^firme that he
might have fulfilled those hopes which thy fatherly mind had conceived of him.
It is the act of an unnatural mind to forget a man's friends, and to bury
their memories with their bodies, and to weep for them abundantly, and to
remember them slenderly. So birds and beasts love their young ones with a
violent and enraged affection, but with the loss of them it is wholly
extinguished. This becomes not a wiseman: let him continue his remembrance,
forbear his mourning. This do I no ways allow of, which Metr^dorus says
that there is a certain joy that is allied to sorrow, and that this should be
affected at this time. I have set down Metrodorus own words, of which I doubt
not what censure thou will yield; for what is more absurd then in sorrow to
a^fect pleasure, nay more, by sorrow and tears to seek that which may
comfort? These are they that object against us our too much rigor, and defame
our precepts for their hardness, because we say that sorrow is either not to
be admitted into the mind, or quickly to be expelled out of it. But whether of
these two is more incredible and inhumane, either not to feel any sorrow for
the loss of our friend, or to search pleasure in sorrow? But that which we
teach is honest, when as our affection has powered forth any tears, and (if I
may so speak it) has skummed them that we ought not abandon our selves
wholly unto sorrow. What say thou? That we mix pleasure and sorrow
together. So still we our children by giving them bread, so pacify we our
infants by pouring in milk. Touching thy self at such time as thy son
burns, or thy friend expireth thou can not permit thy leisure to cease, but
wilt tickle and flatter sorrow it self: whether of both is more fitting,
either to heal the soul of all grief, or to mix grief and joy together, I
say not only to mix, but to take occasion of pleasure out of his sorrow. So
far is it that sorrow is accompanied with any pleasure, as Metrodorus
thinks. This is lawful for us to say, but unlawful for you: you acknowledge
but one good, which is pleasure, and one evil, which is pain. What alliance
may there be between good and evil? But suppose there be; now especially must
we find the same, and now it is that we must see whether pain be environed
with any joy or pleasure. Certain remedies there are which applied to some
parts of the body are wholesome, but by reason of their loathsomeness and
indecency cannot be applied to others, and that in one place may profit
without touch of modesty, is dishonest in another part, where the wound most
appears. Art thou not ashamed to heal sorrow with pleasure? This wound must
be handled with more severity, rather prove that the dead can feel no evil;
for if so it were, he should not be dead. Nothing, say I, hurts him that is
nothing. He lives if he be hurt. Whether think thou him to be in bad case
who is no man, or him that as yet is some body? But in as much as he is not any
more, there is not any torment that may o^fend him; for who can feel it that
is not? neither in as much as he is, can he be endamaged; for he is delivered
from the greatest danger, which is death, by being no more. This likewise let
us say to him that bewayleth and wants his child, ravished from him in his
young years. If thou make a comparison of the shortness of all men's lives,
with the length of time which is pa^^ since the beginning of the world, both
young and old shall find themselves equal. For both the one and the other of
us possess as little as nothing of that length and extent of time. A little is
yet something, but our life and nothing are almost al one, notwithstanding we
stretch it out as much as we may, such is our follies. I have written these
things to thee, not because thou should attend from me a remedy, which
comes too late; for I suppose that thou have told thy self all that which is
contained in my letters. But that I might chastise that little delay, wherein
thou have departed from thy self, and in conclusion might exhort thee to arm
thy self hereafter against adversities, and to foresee all fortunes assaults,
not as they might, but as they ought suddenly to af^lict thee.

EPIST. C.
His judgment of PAPIRIVS FABIANVS the Philosopher, and of his writings.

THou writest to me that thou have very diligently read over those books of
Fabianus Papirius, entitled of things Civil, but that they answered not thine
expectation. And afterward, forgetting thy self that the question was of a
Philosopher, thou accusest his composition. But put case it be so as thou
say^st, that in stead of well couching his words, he says all that comes to
memory: first of all, this discourse has his grace, and it the proper
ornament of a style, little faulty: for I think there is a great difference
whether it escapes or flows. Now in this also which I am to speak, there is
a great difference: Fabianus seems not to me to speak much, but to speak to
the purpose. To speak truth his style is fluent, but not enforced, although it
be current enough. He confesses openly, and lets us see that it is not an
affected and labored style, but such a one as a man may know it was Fabianus
writing. He pretended not to confront his discourse, but to reform manners: he
labored not to tickle the ear, but to teach and instruct the mind.
Furthermore, at such time as he discoursed thou should not have leisure to
consider the parts of his discourse, so much would the summary of the whole
ravish and detain thee. And ordinarily that which is pleasing to us, being
pronounced Viua voce readily and presently, is not so pleasing unto us, being
couched in writing. But this also is a great matter, to settle and occupy the
sight upon a book, although a diligent contemplation might find out matter
worthy reprehension. If thou ask my opinion, more great is he that rauisheth
our judgment then he that deserves it. Such a one is more assured, and if I
err not, may more boldly promise his writings perpetuity. A labored
discourse becomes not a Philosopher. What shall become of a generous and
resolute heart? when shall he make proof of himself, if he be afraid of
words? Fabianu^ was not n^gligent in his discourse, but secure. Thou shall
find nothing in him that is base and impertinent. The words are chosen but
not affect^d, neither couched according to the custom of this time, or
disordered. They are words that have their weight, that have an honest and
magnificent sense, although they be ordinary and vulgar, they are neither
constrained nor doubtful in a sentence, but grave and profound. We shall
neither s^e any thing that is curtalled and shortened, nor any structure unfit,
nothing that is not polished, as the eloquence of this time requires. Examine
this discourse every way, and when thou have beheld it on every side, thou
shall ^inde no straights empty. Although it have no Marbles of diverse colors,
nor dividing or currents of waters running through chambers, nor little clossets
of sparing and abstinence, nor whatsoever else dissolutenes, not contenting
himself with a simple and convenient decency, has invented and mixed
together, yet is the house well builded. Let us now speak of stru^ture and
composition, for all men are not of accord herein. Some of harsh will have it
smooth, some are so much affected to rashness and austerity, that if a clause
do happily end in a pleasing cadence, they purposely dissipate the same, and
interrupt the clauses expressly, lest they should be answerable to expectation.
Read Cicero, his composition is one, he observes his foot, his speech is
polished, smooth and not effeminate. Contrariwise, Asinius Pollio's discourse
is uneven and skipping, and such as will leau^ thee when thou least expectest
it. To conclude, in Cicero all things end, in Pollio they fall, except a few
which are tied to one certain kind of custom and example. Besides, in thine
opinion thou say, that all things in his discourse are humble and scarce
upright, of which vice in my judgment he is freed: for they are not humble but
pleasing, and are formed in an equal and composed manner, not tied together
but united, they want this rhetorical vigor nor those points, and sudden
darted sentences. But examine the whole body, although it be not farded it is
honest and well ^ashioned. His speech has no grace: bring me one whom thou
may prefer before Fabianus. If thou producest Cicero, who has almost
written as many books in Philophy as Fabianus, I will give place; yet is not
that presently little that is less then the greatest. Say that it is Asinius
Pollio, I will yield; but to return^ thee an answer: To be after these two^
is too very high when the qu^stion is of eloquence. Name me Liuie beside these,
for he also has written Dialogus, which a man may as well call Philosophical as
Historical: other books likewise, wherein he treats expressly o^ Philosophy;
to him likewise will I give place, yet consider how many he exceeds, who is
overcome by three, and they the three most eloquent. But he performs not al,
his speech is not strong, although alate; it is not violent nor headlong,
although abundant in words; it is not perspicuous but pure. Thou desire a
sharp declamation against vices, a confident discourse against dangers, a
bold speech against adversity, an inuectiue against ambition. I will have
wickedness^ chidden, lust traduced, impatience bridled. Let the terms of an
Orator be stinging, of a tragique Poet stately, of a Comicke familar and
plain. Will thou have him countenance a small matter with words? He has
addicted himself to the gentleness o^ things he draws our eloquence, and
makes it follow after him, as the shadow does the body. Undoubtedly all his
words shall not be well placed and exactly couched together; neither in every
clause shall there be a part that may quick^n and awaken men. I dare promise
that diverse periods shall escape him to no purpose, and that sometimes his
discourse shall slip away without moving, but in all places his words shall be
agreeable, neither shall there be any pause that will be displeasant. In a
word, he will make thee know that he believed whatsoever he wrote. Thou shall
see that his intention was to make thee know what he approved, and not to
flatter thee: he demands nothing but thy good, and searches for naught else
but to see thee endowed with a good conscience. It is not applause which he
desires. I doubt not but his writings are such, and though I remember not
their intents in general, yet hau^ I before mine eyes some passages of the
same, not in that I have read them over lately, but for that I have s^ene them
in times past, and long since. At such time as I heard him, his words in my
judgment were such, not solid but full and natural, which might allure a young
and well dispos^d man to virtue, and give him hope to attain the true end;
which manner of teaching in my opinion, is more effectual then any other, for
that of another kind makes the auditors to lose their hearts, and takes away
their hope, which impresseth no other desire in them, but to imitate and follow
the same. In brief, Fabianus abounded in words without the commendation of
every several part; but all his discourse in general was exquisit and
magnificent.

EPIST. CI.
Of the sudden death of one of his acquaintance, and by occasion that we are to
trust or promise nothing to our selves. That all things are uncertain, and
therefore good life is not to be deferred, neither long life to be desired: in
conclusion, he controlleth MECAENAS his absurd vow.

EVery day, every hour shows us how vain and naught worth we be, and by
some new argument admonishes us that are forgetful of our frailty, when as it
compels us (who meditate upon eternity) to look back unto death. Ask
thou me what this induction means? Thou knew Cornelius Senecio a Roman
Knight, a man both rich, liberal, and courteous, who from a slender estate
beginning, had raised his fortunes, and had attained the speedy means already
to compass the rest. For dignity does more easily increase then begin. Money
also makes the longest stay about poverty, whilst she creeps out of it. This
Senecio aspired unto riches, whereunto there were two very effectual means
that conducted him, that is to say, the knowledge of getti^g, and the means of
keeping, whereof the one is sufficient to make a man rich. This man being
wonderfully frugall, no less careful of his patrimony then of his body, when
as according to his custom he had s^ene me in the morning, when as from
morning to night he had sitten by his friend that was grievously sick, and lay
desperate without hope, after he had supped merrily, was seized with a sudden
sickness, that is to say, with the Squinancy, which s^rangled him, and set
his soul at liberty. He departed therefore within a few hours after he had
performed all the offices of an able and healthful man. He that traded with
his money both by Sea and Land, that had public profit^ also, and left no
kind of profit unsought after, in the very height of his succesfull fortunes,
when as money rained on every side into his coffers, was taken out of this
life. Now MAELIBEVS graft thy pears again,
And plant thy vines upon the pleasant plain.
How fond a thing it is to promise our selves long life, whereas we are
scarcely Lords and Masters of to morrow. O how mad are they that feed on
fained hopes, and long enterprises? I will buy, I will build, I will lend, I
will recover my debts, I will have such and such estates, and then when I am
fully satisfied, I will pass my full and weary age in repose and quiet. But
trust me, all things are uncertain, yea even unto those that think themselves
most assured. No man ought to promise himself any thing of that which is to
come. That also which we have surest hold-fast of, slippeth through our fingers,
and casualtie cuts that very cord in sunder whereon we have greatest hold-fast.
There is a prefixed ordinance in the reuolutions of the world, although they
are marueilously obscured. But what concerns it me, whether that be certain
to nature, which is uncertain to me? We purpose and intend great voyages by
Sea, wherein we shall see many foreign parts, and resolve not to return again
into our country of a long time: we must to the wars, and be richly
recompensed after we have passed through all the degrees of arms, and have had
commissions and honorable charges, more and more, the one after the other, when
as in the mean while death stands by our sides, and because we never cast
our eyes on that which is ours, but only upon that which is another, from time
to time the examples of our frailty appear unto us, whereon we never think,
but at such time as they stay before our eyes. But what is more foolish then to
wonder to see that done in any day, which may be done in every day. It is a
thing most assured, that the scope of our life is limited by the inexorable
necessity of destiny, but no man knows how near it is. Let us therefore so
dispose our minds, as if this present time were our last hour. Let us defer
nothing. Let us daily make even with life. It is the greatest error in life,
that it is always imperfect, and that some part thereof likewise is deferred.
He that has every day laid the last hand on his life, needs not time. But
from this indigence proceeds fear, and a desire of the future devouring and
eating our minds. There is nothing more miserable then the doubt to things to
come, why they happen. The soul that debateth what it is that remains, or of
what kind is agitated with an inexplicable fear. How shall we avoid this
perplexity? By this one, if we prolong not our life in vain discourse, but
gather it into it self. For he to whom the present time is unprofitable,
cannot have any repose, in regard of the future^ But whereas whatsoever is due
by me unto my self, is restored to my self, whereas the confirmed mind
knows that there is no difference between a day and an age: she beholds,
as it were, from an high tower, all the days and affairs that hereafter are
to come, and with much laughter thinks on the sequel of times. For what
should the variety and mutabilitie of fortunes trouble thee, if thou be
assured against incertainties? Make have therefore (my Lucillius) to live, and
think every several day, a several life. Whosoever orders himself thus,
he that makes every day his whole life, is secure. They that live in hope,
have never any time of rest, they are always desiring and coveting: and the
apprehension of death a thing most miserable, and which makes all things most
miserable never forsakes them. From thence proceeded that dishonest wish of
Moecenas, who contented himself to be weak, deformed, and tormented with
grievous and sharp sickness, provided he might prolong his life amiddest the
mass of these miseries. Make me weak in thigh and hand,
Make my feet infirm to stand,
Shake my teeth, and make them crack,
Stoop my shoulders, bend my back;
So my life remain, I care not,
Threaten torture, come and spare not.
This is to wish an extreme misery, if it should have happened, and the length
of the punishment is desired, as if it were some life. I should repute him a
contemptible fellow, if he would live until such time as he were tied to the
gallows. Yet this man says, weaken me, provided that my soul may remain in
my crased and unprofitable body: dis^igure me, if this counterfeit and
monstrous body of mine may lengthen my life some days. Torture and crucify
me, if so be by that means I may live. It is a strange matter in him to hide
his wounds thus, and to be content to remain hanged and stretched upon a
gibbet, upon condition that death, which is the end of all punishment, and the
sovereign remedy against all evils, should be d^ferred in his behalf. See
here a wondrou^ thing, I would hau^ a soul to die without dying. What
would thou wish for, O Maecenas, but that the gods should have pity on
thee? Whereto tends the villainy of this verse, proceeding from an effeminate
mind? What means this covenant invented by senseless and mad fear? And to
what purpose is this shameful begging of loathsome life. Think you that
Virgil ever recited this verse unto him, To leave this life, is it a thing so
wretched?
He wishes the worst of evils, and those things that are most grievous to be
suffered, he desires to be grievously tortured and hanged up: and why, or for
what recompense, for sooth, for a longer life. But what is this man's life? to
die long. Is th^re any man found, who had rather parch himself up amiddest
tortures, and to lose one member after another, and to die so oftentimes
amiddest defluxions, as to die at one time? Was there ever any man that had
rather wish to lie cou^hed all at his length upon a miserable bed languishing,
deformed, crook^d both before and behind, that besides his violent sicknesses,
had other more mortal, that desires to retain a soul being tortured and
rent in pieces by so many torments? Say now that the necessity of death is not
a great gift of Nature. Many as yet are ready to vow far worse, yea even to
betray their friends that they may live longer, and to deliver their children
to be deflowred with their own hands, that they might prolong their life,
being guilty of so much wickedness. We must shake off this desire of life,
and learn this, that it skils not when thou suffer any thing, which thou
must suffer sometimes: that all in all is to live well, without taking care how
long, and that oftentimes also this well living consists in a life which is
not long.

EPIST. CII.
He speaks somewhat of the immortality of the soul, and then annexeth a
question, Whether renown does us any good after death. First he disputes
slenderly and Scholastically, then about the end more effectually, and leads
our minds to God and celestial things. He approves that this our body is
our burden and cover, that it ought to be despised and shaken off, when God
and time summon us thereunto.

EVen as he is troublesome that awakeneth another man, that is seized with some
pleasant dreams, although it be fained, for he takes away the pleasure, yea
such notwithstanding as has the effect of truth. So thy Epistle has done me
injury, for it has recalled me from a thought and meditation, into which I
was suffiently entered to the purpose, and had engaged my self further, had I
not by this means been disturbed. I took pleasure to debate upon the
eternity of souls, nay more, I was fully resolved therein. For I easily
believed the opinions of great men, rather promising then approving so
grateful a matter. I gave my self over to this so great hope, and now grow
hateful unto my self, and now contemned the relics of my broken years,
being ready to be transferred into that immeasurable time, and possession of
that in^inite eternity, when as suddenly I was awakened by thy letter, which
made me dismiss so sweet a dream, which hereafter I will revive and redeem
again, as soon as I have satisfied thy expectation. Thou say that in my
former letter I did not sufficiently answer that question, wherein I labored
to prove that which they of our sect do approve, that the praise which a man
obtains after death is a great good. That I have not answered that question
which is opposed against us. Of goods that are distant (say they) there is none
good; but this is a thing distant and far off. That which thou proposest (my
Lucillius) is a part of the question, yet such a part a ough^ to be debated
upon in another place: and therefore I neither would touch that, neither other
things that were dependent thereupon. For some Moral questions as thou know
are intermixed with the Natural. And therefore I entreated only of that part
which wholly concerns manners. That is to say, whether it be a foolish and
superfluous thing to transport our thoughts beyond the latter end of this life;
whether our goods perish with us, and nothing remains of his, who is nothing;
whether we shall feel any fruit of that which shall be (what soever it may be)
before we may enjoy it. But all these questions pertain unto manners, and
therefore are they ranked in their proper place. But those things which are
spoken by the Logicians against this opinion, are to be severed, and therefore
are they set apart. But now, since thou requirest at this time a reason of all,
I will examine that which they say, and afterward answer their objections. If
I propose not something first, a man cannot understand the refutations. What is
it that I would foretell? That there are some continued bodies, as a man: some
compound, as a ship, a house, and all other things whose diverse parts are
united together in one. Some likewise that consist of distant parts, whose
members are as yet separate, as an Army, a People, a Senate. For they of whom
this body is composed, are united together either by law or duty, but by
nature they are distinct, and each one several. What is it likewise that now I
will foretell? That we suppose that nothing is good, which is compos^d of
things distant. For one good mu^t be maintained and governed by one spirit, and
that there is but one principal of one good. This is approved by it self, if
thou requir^st it to be proved, and in the mean while it was to be set down^,
to the end it might be the ground of our discourse. Thou will say, you other
Stoics maintain that no good is composed of things distant. But this glory
whereof we entreat, is a favorable opinion of good men. For as a good fame
is not one man's words, neither infamy one man's mis-report: so is it not praise
to please one good man, many famous and worthy men must consent herein to make
it glory. But this consists in diverse men's judgments, and namely those that
are distant, therefore it is not good, glory (says he) is a commendation given
by good men to a good man: commendation is a speech, a speech is a voice that
signifies something. But the voice, although it be a good man's voice, is not
goodness. For whatsoever a good man does, is not always good. For he clappeth
his hands and hisseth. But neither will any man say that his clapping or
hissing is good, although he applaud and admire all whatsoever is his, no more
then he will do his snee^ing or coughing. Therefore glory is not good. In a
word, tell us whether this good concerns the praiser, or him that is praised?
If the praiser, it is as much as if thou should say, that another man's good
health is mine, but to praise those that are worthy is an honest action,
therefore this good concerns the praiser, from whom this action commeth^ not
from us that are praised. But this is that which is in question. I answer
briefly to these objections. First the question is at this day, whether any
good may be composed of those things that are distant; and both parties have
their reasons. Secondly, praise desires not many suffrages: for it may be
contented with one good man's judgment, who only is a competent Judge, to say
that all they who resemble him are good. What then (says he) shall fame depend
upon the estimate of one man, and infamy tied to the mis-report of another
man? Glory also (says he) as I understand, is spread more largely. For it
requires the consent of many men. The condition of these, and of this are
different. Why? Because if a good man have a good opinion of me, I am in the
same estate that I should be, when as all good men should have like thought of
me. For if all of them knew me, they would iump^ in the opinion of this one
man. They have but one and the same judgment, and they that cannot differ, do
necessarily agree in their opinions. Therefore, that which one thinks
imports as much, as if all of them had spoken because they cannot be of any
other opinion. The opinion of one man (says he) suffices not to give glory
and renown unto another. To this I answer, that herein the opinion of one
avails as much as of all, for if every one of them be demanded, they will
answer alike. In this place the judgments of those tha^ disagree are diverse,
the affections different. Thou shall find all things in this world doubtful,
light, and suspected. Think thou that all men's minds are alike? Undoubtedly
the same man is not of the same opinion always. Truth is pleasing to the good,
and this truth neither changes his vigor or color. Amongst the wicked there
are falsities wherein they accord, but there is nothing but inconstancy,
repugnancie and discord in a lie. But praise (says he) is but a voice spread
in the air, and that a word meriteth not the name of good^ when as they say
that praise is the commendation of good men, delivered by good men; now refer
it not to the words but to the sentence^ For although a good man hold his
peace, and yet judges any man worthy of commendation, by this is he
commended. Besides, there is a difference betwixt these two words, Praise, and
Praising, which requires explication. Delivering a funeral Oration, we use
not this word praise but praising, which consists in words. But saying that
some one is worthy of praise, we understand by this word the just judgments of
men, rather then their speeches. So then praise shall be the right opinion of
him who without speaking, priseth in himself any good man. Furthermore as I
have said, praise has relation to the thought, not unto the words, which
express the praise which is conceived inwardly, and uttered to the knowledge
of many men. He praises who judges that he ought to praise, when as the
Tragique Poet says, That it is a magnificent thing to be praised by a
praiseworthy man: he means that this praiseworthy man is worthy of praise.
And when another Poet of the same time says that praise nourishes arts, he
speaks not of a flattery which corrupts arts. For there is nothing that
has so much soiled eloquence, and all other studies addicted to the ear, as
the applause of the people. Fame would be published and bruited, praise would
not, for she respects not words, but contenteth her self with judgment;
she is accomplished, not only amongst those that are silent, but likewise
amongst those that oppose themselves against her. Now will I declare what
difference there is between praise and glory; Glory consists on many men's
judgments, Praise on good men's. To whom returns the good of praise (says he)
either to him that is praised, or to the praiser? Both to the one and to the
other. It is a great good for me to be praised, for nature has created me a
lover of all men: I rejoice that I have done well, and one of my contentments
is to have met with men which take pleasure in those virtuous acts which I
might have done. That many are thus disposed is a good which they enjoy, but I
have my part in it also, being of that mind that I think other men's good be
mine, especially those men to whom I am the cause of this good which proceeds
from virtue. But every occasion of virtue is good, which they could not enjoy
if I were not virtuous. So then a true praise is a common good, both to him
that praises, and him that is praised, as certainly as a just sentence is the
good and honor both of the Judge and the party who obtains profit by the
cause. Doubtest thou that justice is not a good both to the debtor and
creditor? It is justice and equity to praise a man that meriteth praise, and
consequently is a common good, both to him that praises, and him that is
praised: we have sufficiently answered these cauillers. But this should not be
our purpose to sow subtilties, and to draw Philosophy from her majesty into
these straights: how far better is it to go the open and direct way, then to
find out by paths and loose our selves therein, and be constrained to return
back, to our great trouble and prejudice? For these disputations are naught
else but the pastimes of men that would cunningly beguile one another. Rather
tell me how natural a thing it is to extend the mind to infinity. A great
and generous thing is man's mind, it endures not to be circumscribed by any
limits, but those which are common to him with God. First of all, he
acknowledges nor himself to be natuturally bred in any region or land
whatsoever, as in Ephesus or Alexandria, or in any other country of the
greatest extent, or most peopled. All whatsoever is environed by the continent
of heaven is his country, that is to say, his round, composed of Seas and
Lands mixed together, within which the extent of the air seperateth and
unites things celestial and terrestrial, in which so many gods disposed in
due order are intentive to execute their commissions: secondly, she endures
not to be circumscribed by years: all years (says he) are mine, no age is
locked up to great wits, there is no time through which humane thought has not
pierced. When that day which must make a separation betwixt the body and soul
thus united, as you see I will leave this body, where I found it, and will
restore my self unto the gods; neither am I now without them, but in such
sort, as I feel my self detained in this heavy and earthly prison. By these
delays of mortal life we make an entrance to that better and longer life.
Even as our mothers womb contains us nine months, and prepares us not to
remain therein always, but for another place for which it soemeth we strive
both hand and foot, as soon as we are ready to breathe and live in the aire^
so by the means of this space of time, which is betwixt our infancy and age,
we aspire unto another birth of nature. Another original, another estate of
things attends us. We cannot as yet suffer the heaven, but by means of this
great extent which is between them and us: for which cause behold thou with a
settled eye that determined hour which is not the last unto the soul, but
only to the body. Whatsoever goods of this world thou beholdest about thee,
look on them as if they were the baggage and moueables of an Inn. We must
pass further; nature leaves us as naked at the issue of this world, as we
were upon the entry: thou have brought nothing with thee, neither shall thou
carry away any thing with thee; nay more, thou must leave in the world a great
part of that which thou have brought with thee. Thou shall be spoiled of that
skin that enclosed thee, and the last cloth that covered thee; thou shall leave
thy flesh and blood, which is dispersed through thy whole body; thy bones and
nerves shall be taken from thee, which were the supporters of so many frail
and fleeting things. This day which thou fear so much, and which thou
call thy last, is the birth day of an eternity. Lay aside thy burden. Why
delayest thou? Is it so long since that thou forsookest a body, that is to say
thy mothers womb where thou were hidden, to enter into this world? Why striuest
thou, and dalliest thou? Thy mother when thou were borne labored hardly to be
delivered of thee. Thou sighest, thou weepest, and this is that which the
infant does as soon as he is borne. But then were thou to be pardoned, because
as then thou were but new born, and without the knowledge of any thing. Being
issued from this hot and soft couch of thy mothers entrails, thou have
breathed a more freer air; then feeling thy self touched with a hand somewhat
more hard, thou that were soft and tender, could not endure it without
crying: and it is not to be wondered at that thou remainedst astonished and
daunted amongst so many things, which were unseen before, considering that
thou neither had knowledge nor apprehension of any thing. Let it not be a
new thing now unto thee to be separated from that, whereof before time thou have
been some portion: acquit thy self willingly of these members which are now
superfectlesse, and lay aside this body, wherein thou have inhabited so long
time. It shall be cut in pieces, devoured and brought to nothing. Why art thou
agrieued? So goes the world. The cau^es which infolde the infants in their
mothers womb shall be broken and rotten. Why love thou earthly goods, as if
they were thine? These are but the foulds that wrap thee in. A day will come
that will unfold them, and will draw thee out of the company of this villenous
and stinking womb. Fly now out of this world with a forward courage, estrange
thy self from all things, yea, of those things that be necessary. That done,
meditate on somewhat more high and sublime. One day the secrets of nature shall
be discovered unto thee, this obscurity shall be cleared, and a shining light
shall reflect upon thee on every side. Think with thy self how great this
brightness is of so many celestial bodies, which mix their lights together.
So fair a clear shall never be obscured by any darkness: the heaven shall
be as glorious in one part as in another. Day and night are the reuolutions of
the regions of the air. Thou will confess that thou have lived in darkness,
when as thou shall freely see the whole light, which now thou beholdest
obscurely through th^se narrow circles of thine eyes, and from a far, yet not
without astonishment. What will thou say of the divine light, when thou shall
see it in his place? Such a thought as this will not suffer our souls to
gather rust or dirt, it hinders us either from humbling our hearts too low,
or raising them too high. She maintains that the gods are witnesses of all
things, and will that we be approved by them, that we depend on their will,
that we have the day of eternity always before our eyes. Whosoever has any
apprehension hereof in his soul, he has no fear of Armies, the Trumpet
amazeth him nothing, there is no threat that may make him fear. He that
expects death, can he be without fear? whereas the other (who esteems that
the soul remains and subsisteth during his abode in the prison of the body,
in departing from which she is dissipated) cease not to demean himself in
such sort, that after his death he pretends to serve those that survive in
some other sort: for although he be taken from our sight, yet The man's great
virtue, and his countries glory,
And wondrous value come to memory.
Think how much good examples profit us, and thou shall find that the
memory of worthy personages is no less profitable for us then their presence.

EPIST. CIII.
The malice and treasons of men amongst themselves, yet do not thou so, but
lay them apart; and be thou courteous and willing to do good unto all men.

WHy regardest thou on every side those things that may befall thee, and
happily may not chance unto thee? I mean fire or ruin, and other
inconveniences which happen unto us, but lay not in wait for us. Rather
consider and avoid thou the dangers which attend and surprise us. These
casualties are rare, although they be grievous, to suffer shipwreck, to be
ouerturned out of a Coach. But from a man daily a man expects the most
danger, prepare thy self against this evil, and contemplate it with open
eyes. For there is no evil more frequent, more obstinate, neither any one more
flattering. The tempest threatens before it rises: the houses crack before
they fall: the smoke foretells that the fire is a kindling. But the
mischief that a man does is sudden, and the nearer the evil is, the more
secretly is it hidden. Thou art deceived if thou trust their looks that meet
thee: they have the faces of men, but the hearts of savage beasts, but that the
first assault of beasts is most violent, which they cannot avoid: for nothing
but necessity moves them to hurt; either by hunger or fear they are enforced
to fight, but a man takes pleasure to destroy a man. But think thou so that
the danger is by a man, to the end thou may think what the office of a man
is. Consider the one, to the end thou be not offended, and the other, to the
end thou offend not. Rejoice at every man's profit, and be sorry for their
harms, and bethink thy self what thou ought to perform, and what to
avoid. By living thus, what gettest thou? Thou may always avoid that men
do thee no outrage, but thou can not choose but be deceived by them.
Especially endeavor thy self to take thy retreat to Philosophy, she will
defend thee in her bosom. In her Sanctuary either shall thou be safe, or
safer. Men iostle not one another, except they walk in the same way. But of al
things beware to boast of thy Philosophy. Many men by too proudly boasting,
and vainly vaunting thereof, have perished. Let it suffice thee that she
spoileth thee of thy vices, that she reprocheth not other men of theirs, that
she abhor not from public manners, that she behave her self modestly,
without causing men think of her, that she condemns all that which she does
not her self. A man may be wise without making show thereof, and without
envying any man.

EPIST. CIIII.
Of his sickness and the cure, and the charity his wife had of him. That he
had changed his abode for recreation sake, and hereupon an excellent discourse
upon travail. That it is not profitable of it self, except it be made so by
the mind. Let that be amended, and the affections cut off, and that then every
station and estate will be pleasing. That there is likewise another kind of
travail, to have recourse unto ancient and great men, to behold them in our
thoughts, and to imitate them. This rooteth out vices, that planteth virtues,
and to this inuiteth he LVCILLIVS.

I Fled into my Grange at Momentanum: but why think thou? to shun the City?
No, the feuor which began to seize upon me. And now already she had laid hold
on me. Forthwith therefore I commanded my Coach to be made ready, although my
wife Paulina were against it: My Physician having touched my pulse, and finding
the artery beating incertainly and contrary to nature, said that it was the
beginning of a feuor. Yet notwithstanding I resolved my self to set forward;
remembering me of a speech of Gallio, my Lord and Master, who being in Achaia,
and feeling himself surprised with a feuor, forthwith embarked himself,
crying out that this sickness of his proceeded from the air of the Country,
and not from his body. This told I to my Paulina, who recommended my health
unto me. For whereas I know that her soul is translated and lives in mine,
for her content sake I begin to have a care of my health. But although that old
age has fortified me against diverse difficulties, yet at this present begin I
to lose this benefit of age. I thought that in this old man there was a young
man, that was over much tendered. So then, because I cannot require that my
wife should love me more entirely then she does, she has begged so much at my
hands, that now I cherish my self more tenderly then I otherwise did. For we
must give way unto honest affections, and sometimes also, if urgent causes
require it, our soul in honor of our friends is to be recalled, though it be
to our torment, and retained betwixt our teeth, because a virtuous man is bound
to live, not as long as he likes, but as long as he must. He that without
respect of his wife and friends, labors for naught else but to end his life,
but demands death is over delicate. Let the soul have this commandment
over her self, (when the profit of those, to whom she is obliged, requires
the same) to shun death, not only for her own cause, but likewise when she
is upon the point to dislodge and leave the body, to reenter again, to the
end she may be enabled to do her friends service. It is the argument of a
great mind to return unto life for another man's good, as diverse great
personages have many times done. And this also esteem I to be a great
humanity, to maintain old age more intentiuely, (the fairest fruit whereof
consists in maintenance of her health, and in living more orderly then he was
accustomed) if thou knew that to be a thing either pleasant, profitable, or
wished for of any of thy friends. Moreover, there is a great joy and profit
therein. For what greater contentment may there be, then to be so dearly
beloved by a man's wife, that for that cause thou should become more loving
to thy self? My Paulina therefore cannot only impute her fear unto me, but
mine also. Demandest thou therefore what success my determination had in going
into the country? As soon as I had gotten out of the foggie air of Rome, and
from the stinck of the smookie chimneyes thereof, which being stirred, power
forth whatsoever pestilent vapors they held enclosed in them, I felt an
alteration of my disposition. How much, think thou, was my strength
increased when I came unto my Grange? No sooner entered I the meads, but I
began to rush upon my meat with a strong appetite. Thus therefore for the
present have I recovered my self, this leanness of body which has no
security of health, and which begins to decline, is vanished from me, and I
begin to study diligently. The place yields little furtherance thereunto, if
the mind be not assistant to it self, for if he list amidst all affairs and
troubles he may have a place of retirement. But he that makes choice of the
place, and idleth it vainly, shall every where find a nooke wherein to
restrain himself. For it is reported that Socrates (hearing a certain man
complain that he had lost his time in traveling here and there) returned
this answer: not without cause has this befallen thee, for thou trauelledst
with thy self. O how happy would diverse men be, if they could wander from
themselves. But they are the first that solicit, corrupt, and terrify them
selves. What avails it to pass the seas, and to change Cities? If thou will
fly these things wherewith thou art urged, thou need not be in another
place, but become another man. Put case thou were come to Athens, or to Rhodes;
choose what City thou please. What skilleth it what manners they have? Thou
shall carry thither thine own. Think thou that riches make men happy?
Poverty (yea the appearance and presumption thereof, which is a lamentable
opinion) shall incessantly torture thee. For although thou possessest much, yet
because another man has more, thou shall seem unto thy self by so much the
poorer, by how much the other is more rich. Supposest thou that honors are
good? It shall grieve thee that such a man is made Consul, and that such a one
has twice enjoyed the Office, it shall vex thee when thou shall find in the
public registers any man's name oftener then thine own. So great shall the
fury of thy ambition be, that if any one shall outstrip thee, thou will not
think that any marches behind thee. Will thou suppose death to be an extreme
evil? When as there is nothing evil in it, but the fear which is before it,
not only the dangers, but the suspicions will terrify thee. Thou shall
incessantly be tormented with dreams and shadows. For what shall it profit
thee that thou have escaped so many Cities of Greece, and made thy way by
flight through the midst of thine enemies? Peace it self shall affright thee.
Thou shall no ways trust those things that are most a^sured, as soon as thy
mind shall be shaken. For as soon as she has gotten a custom to entertain
improuident fear, thou art no more disposed to entertain any repose or
contentment in thy self. For she shunneth not, but flies from the stroke,
but if we turn our backs to afflictions, they have greater holdfast on us.
Thou will judge it a grievous evil to lose any of those friends thou have
loved, whereas mean while it is as great folly to bewail them, as to weep,
because the leaves of thy fair shadowing trees, which adorn thy house, are
fallen and shaken to the ground. As much flourishes the one, as the other
which delights thee. Death will shake down the one to day, the other to
morrow. But as we suffer patiently the fall and loss of the leaves of our
trees, because they will spring again: so ought thou to endure the loss of
thy friends, whom thou conceitest to be the joys of thy life, because they
shall be restored, although they be not now borne. But they shall not be such
as they were whilst they remained in this world. Neither shall thou thy self
be the same. Every day, every hour changes thee, but in others the
nourishment appears more easily, here it lies hidden, because it is not
done openly. Some are carried away; but we our selves are secretly stolen
away. Will thou think of none of these things. Will thou apply no remedies to
these wounds, but send unto thy self the causes of thy cares, by hoping
something and despairing other? If thou be wise, mix the one with the
other, neither hope thou without desperation, neither despair without hope.
What can travel profit any man of it self? It tempereth not pleasures, it
bridleth not desires, it pacifieth not displeasures, it breaks not the
untamed assaults of love. To conclude, it disburtheneth the mind of no evil,
neither gi^eth judgment, nor shakes off error, but detaineth the mind for a
short time, and entertaineth it with novelty of things, as we see children
stand at gaze, when they behold any thing which they have not seen. To
conclude, this going and coming does no more but make the inconstant thought
more light and stirring, which in the height of his evil, provoke and
alters it self in such sort, that they who most earnestly traveled into any
countrey^ depart from thence more hastily, and after the manner of skipping
birds, fly thence more swiftly, then they came thither. Travel will give thee
knowledge of Nations, will show thee the new forms of Mountains, the spacious
and unaccustomed plains, the Valleys watered with running Rivers, some flood
that has a certain notable property, as Nilus, which increases in Summer,
or Tygris, which loos^^^ it self, then having made a long circuit under the
earth reentereth h^s channel, and renews his swift and spacious course as
before, or how Meander (the exercise and play of all Poets) makes an infinite
vvindlas of turns and retures, that oftentimes discharging her self from her
own channel streameth along the bed of her neighbor floods, and so
returns. But such voyages will neither make thee more healthie, or more
wise. We must converse amongst studies, and amongst the authors of wisdom,
that we may learn that which we desire to know, and seek out that which is
as yet unfound. By this means must the mind be redeemed from miserable
servitude, and set at liberty. As long as thou shall be ignorant of that
which thou should fly or follovv, of that which is necessary and
superfluous, of that which is just and honest, this may not be said a
travail, but an error. Thi^ turmoyle will comfort thee nothing, for thou
wanderest accompanied by thy affections, and thy evils follow thee. Would to
God they might follow thee, and were further off from thee: now thou bear
them on thy back, thou leadest them not. For which cause they every way weigh
thee down, and fear thee with equal incommodities. The sick man must seek
out for a good medicine, not for a new country. Has any one broken his leg, or
put a member out of joint? He gets not to his coach, he embarkes not in his
ship, but calls for a Physician, to the end he may unite that which was
broken, and set the joint in his place that was dislocated. To what end then
think thou, that by changing thy country, thou may heal thy bruised and
broken mind in so many places? This evil is more great then to be cured by
being carried hither and thither. Travel neither makes a Physician no^ an
Orator. There is neither art nor science that is learned by changing place in
this sort. What then, is not wisdom which is the greatest treasure of all
others learned in travels? Trust me, there is no iourn^y that may retire thee
apart from thy desires, thy displeasures, and thy fears, or if there were any,
all m^nkind by troops would travel and flock thither. So long will these
evils press thee and macerate thee whilst thou wanderest by land and sea; as
long as thou bear the causes of thine evils in thee. Wonderest thou at this,
that thy flight profit^th thee nothing. Why man, the things thou fliest are
with the^. Mend thy self therefore, shake off thy burdens, and at leastwise
contain thy desires within compass. Root all wickedness out of thy mind,
if thou will have thy travels delightful, heal thy companion. Avarice will
cling unto thee as long as thou live with a covetous and base companion.
Pride will clea^^ unto thee, as long as thou conuersest with a proud man. Thou will never lay aside thy cruelty in a Hang-mans company. The fellowship of
adulterors will enkindle thy lusts. If thou will be discharged of vices, thou
must retire thy self a far off from all evil examples. Avarice,
dissolution, cruelty, fraud (such enemies that approaching thee, will wound
thee grievously) are within thee. Acquaint thy self with the better sort, live
with such as Cato, Laelius, and T^bero were: and if thou take a liking to live
among the Grecians, converse with Socrates and with Zeno: The one will teach
thee how to die, if it be needful, the other how to die before it be needful.
Live with Chrysippus and P^sidonius: These will teach thee the knowledge of
divine and humane things. These will command thee to put in practice that which
thou have learned, and not to content thy self with a polished tongue, which
tickleth the ears of the hearers, but to fortify thy heart, and to confirm
it to confront casualtie. For the only port of this troubled and turbulent life
is to contemn those things that may happen, to remain resolute to oppose a
naked bosom against all the darts of adversity, without playing the coward,
or seeking starting holes. Nature has created us valiant, and as to some
creatures she has given a feirce, to some a subtle, to othersome a fearful:
so has she given us a glorious and high spirit, that seeks where he may live
most honestly, not most securely; resembling the world, which in as much as
humane ability will give him leave, he follows and counterfeiteth. He
seeks nothing but praise, and desires to be seen. He is the love of all
things, and above all things. He therefore submits himself to nothing,
nothing seems heavy unto him, nothing that may make a man stoop. Travail
and death are ugly to behold.
Nothing so, if a man might behold them clearly, and break through the
darkness. Many things that have been esteemed dreadful by night, have proved
trifles and jesting sports by day. Travail and death are ugly to behold.
Worthily wrote our Virgil, he says that they were not terrible indeed, but in
semblance, that is, they seem so to be, but are not. What is there, say I, in
these so dreadful as fame has reported them? What is there I pray thee (my
Lucillius) that a man should fear either labor or death? Yet meet I with
those men, that think all that impossible which they cannot do, and say that
we speak greater matters then humane nature may sustain or effect. But how
far better opinion have I of them? They also can do these things, but they
will not. To conclude, whom have ever these precepts failed that have dained to
make use of them, who found them not more easy in action then in instruction?
It is not because they are difficult, that we dare not; but because we dare
not, they are difficult. Yet if you require an example, behold Socrates, that
most patient man, tossed in so many dangers; invincible in poverty, which his
domestique burdens made more grievous and cumbersome, invincible in those
labors he suffered in war, and wherewith at home he was daily exercised:
whether you respect his wife fierce in manners, and froward in tongues or his
rebellious and disobedient children, more like their mother then their father.
So for the most part he either was in war, or in tyranny, or in liberty,
more cruel then wars or tyrannies. Seven and twenty years he bare arms,
and having laid them aside, he saw his City enthralled under thirty Tyrants,
of which the most part of them were his enemies. The last of these is his
condemnation urged against him for most heinous crimes. The violating of
Religion is objected against him, and the corruption of youth, which ^e was
said to enforce against the gods, against parents, and his Commonweal. After
all this, his prison and poison. So far were these things from moving
Socrates mind, that they never moved his countenance. He maintained that his
wonderful and singular praise until his dying day. No man saw Socrates either
more merry or more sad, he continued equal in so great inequality of
fortune. Will thou have another example? Take me that Cato of Vtica, with whom
Fortune dealt more cruelly, and more obstinately. Against which, whilst in all
places he had made head; and last of all in his death: yet approved he that a
confident and valiant man may live and die in spite of Fortune. All his
lifetime was spent in civil war. And although thou say that this man, no
less th^n Socrates, spent his life in servitude: except a man may happily
think that Cneus Pompey, and Caesar, and Crassus, were confederates to
maintain liberty. There was no man that ever saw Cato changed in a
Commonweal so oftentimes changed, in all occurrences he showed himself one.
In his Pretorship, in his repulse, in his accusation, in his province, in his
speeches in the Army, in his death; finally, in that garboyle of the
Commonweal, when as on the one side Caesar had trusted his fortunes to ten
valiant legions, on that side to the forces of so many foreign Nations, and
Pompey to his own forces; when some inclined unto Caesar, other some unto
Pompey^ Cato only maintained levied arms for common liberty. If thou
would imagine in thy mind the Image of that time, thou shall see on the one
side the people with listening ear, harkening after nothing but novelty; on
the otherside the Senators and Knights and whatsoever was either holy and
chosen in the City: two only left in the midst, the Commonweal and Cato.
Thou will wonder, say I, if thou shall observe. ATRIDES grave, and PRIAMVS the
old,
And Trojans greatest fear, ACHILLES bold.
For he condemns both, and disarmeth both; and this is his opinion of both:
he says, that if Caesar prevail, he will die: if Pompey, he will be banished;
what had he to fear which had decreed that against himself, either if he
happened to be either conqueror or conquered, which might have been decreed by
his most bitter enemies; he died therefore by his own decree. See thou that
men can suffer labors? He led his army on foot through the midst of the
deserts of Africa. See thou that they may endure thirst? Leading the
remainder of his conquered Army along the desert hills, without any baggage,
he suffered the want of drink, being soultered in his armor, and as often as
occasion offered him water he was the last that drunk. See thou that honor
and authority may be contemned? The same day he was repulsed from the office he
stood for, the same day played he at the ball in the marketplace. See thou
that great men's power may not be feared? He opposed himsel^^ against Pompey and
Caesar at one time; the one of which no man durst offend, except it were to win
the favor of the other. See thou that death may be as well contemned as
banishment? He both pronounced exile and death against himself, and in the
Interim war. We may then have the same resolution against all accidents,
provided, that we take a pleasure to discharge our necks of the yoke. First of
all therefore pleasures are to be despised, for they weaken, disable, and
demand much, and much is to be required at fortunes hands. After these riches
are to be despised, which are the recompenses of servitude. Let gold and
silver, and what else soever loadeth happy houses be left: liberty is not
bought for nothing, if thou highly prise her, thou must misprise and neglect
all the rest.

Short and profitable precepts, tending to security. Read them, and make use
of them.

THou shall know of me what those things are which thou art to observe, to the
end thou may live more secure: yet so hear these precepts I advise thee, as
if I should counsel thee how to maintain thy good health in the bad air of
Adiatinum. Consider what things they be that provoke one man to seek another
man's ruin, and thou shall find that they are hope, envy, hatred, fear, and
contempt; of all these contempt is the lightest, insomuch as many have lien
hidden therein for the safeguard of their lives. Whomsoever a man contemns,
he kicketh at him, but passes by him. No man purposely hurts a contemned
person, no man diligently. Even he that is prostrate on the earth in a
conflict, is ouerslipped where he that stands is assaulted. Thou shall
frustrate the hope of the wicked if thou have nothing that may provoke another
man's wicked desire, if thou possess nothing that is worthy the having. For
those things that are of the greatest price, are most desired although they be
least known. So therefore shall thou fly envy if thou make no show, if thou
boast not of thy fortunes, if thou know how to enjoy them to thy self. But
as touching the hatred which proceeds from offense, thou shall avoid it thus
by provoking no man without cause, from whence common sense will defend thee,
for this has been dangerous to many. Some men have had hatred, but not an
enemy. The means not to be feared shall be to live in a mean and humble
condition, when as men shall know that thou art such a one, whom they may
offend without perrill. Let thy reconcilement be both easy and certain. But
to be feared is as dangerous at home as abroad, by thy servants as by thy
children. There is no man that has not power enough to hurt. Add hereunto,
that he who is feared, fears. No man could be terrible securely. Contempt
remains, the means whereof is in his power that is contemned, who is
contemned because he would, not because he ought. The incommoditie hereof both
good Arts do dis^usse, and the friendships of those who are powerful with any
mighty man, to whom it shall be expedient for thee to apply thy self, not to
entangle thy self with them, for fear lest the remedy cost thee more then
the danger would. Yet nothing shall more profit thee, then to be quiet, and to
confer the least with many, the most with thy self. There is a certain
charming discourse, which creeps into a man's bosom and flattereth, and no
otherwise then drunkenness or love betrayeth secrets. Let no man conceal that
which he has heard, neither let any man speak as much as he has heard: he
that will not conceal the matter, will reveal the author. Every one has a
friend to whom he trusts as much as is trusted to himself. To content
himself with one man's ears, and to set a watch before his lips, he shall
address himself to the people; so that which now was a secret becomes to be
a rumor. It is a great part of s^curitie to do nothing wickedly. Choleric
and reuengefull men lead a confused and troublesome life: they fear as much
as they hurt; neither at ^hy time are they in quiet, for they fear and are
doubtful when they have done it. Their conscience suffers them to do naught
else, and compels them oft-times to look back unto themselves. Whosoever
expects the stroke is chastised enough, and whosoever has deserved
punishment expects it. There is something in an evil conscience that may
settle it awhile, but nothing that may secure it. For he thinks that although
he be not discovered, he may be discovered, and midst his dreams he is moved;
and when as any other man's wickedness speaks, he thinks of his own, he
thinks it never sufficiently defaced or fully covered. A wicked man has
sometimes had the fortune to hide himself, but never had he assurance in his
hiding.

EPIST. CVI.
An idle question, taken out of CHRYSIPPVS, Whether good be a body. In the
conclusion somewhat against subtilties.

A Little too late I answer thy Letters, not because I am troubled with much
business, for beware thou except not this excuse; I am at leisure, and all
they that will are at leisure. Affairs follow no man, but men embrace them,
and think business to be an argument of felicity. What therefore was the
cause that I did not presently write back unto thee, and answer thy question?
It was a matter incident to my discourse; for thou know that I am determined
to entreat of moral Philosophy, and to decide all those questions that depend
thereupon. I therefore doubted whether I should defer thee, or give thee an
extraordinary satisfaction before I come unto the place where this question
should be handled. But I thought it a point of more humani^^^ to delay him no
longer, who sent from so far: by means whereof, I will extract this out of
the sequel of those things that depend one upon anoth^^^ and if any shall
occur of this nature, I will willingly send them thee, although thou
requirest them not. Ask thou me what these be? Such things as the science
thereof is more pleasing then profitable, as that is which thou bring in
question, Whether we call that good which is a body? I answer, that it is a
body, for it acts. That which acts is a body; good agitateth the mind^, and
in a manner forms and contains it: so then the goods of the body are a
body, and the goods of the soul are a body, and therefore the soul is a body.
It must needs be that the good of a man is a body, considering that a man is
corporal. I am abused if those things which nourish the body and keep it, and
restore it to health be not bodies. It follows then that the good of a man is
a body. I think thou will make no question of this, that affections are
bodies, such as is cholor, love, and sadness, (lest in this place I should be
enforced to intermixe those things, whereof thou make no question) if thou
doubtest, consider if they change not the countenance, if they bend not the
brow, if they smooth not the face, or provoke not blushing, or enforce not
palenesse: what then? Think thou that so manifest notes are imprinted in the
body without a body? If affections be bodies, and the sickenesses of the mind,
such as are avarice and cruelty, such as are obstinate and incurable evils,
malice and all the kinds thereof, as malignitie, envy, pride, shall be
bodies likewise, and consequently good, first, because they are contrary unto
these; again, because they produce in thee the same offects. See thou not
what vigor fortitude gives to the eyes, how great intention prudence? how
much modesty and quiet reverence? what contentment joy? what rigor severity?
what remission mirth? They are therefore bodies which change the habit and
color of bodies, which exercise their dominion in them. Was it ever doubted
but that means, whereby a body is touched is a body? F^r nothing can touch
and be touched, except it be a body, as the Poet Lucretius says. But all
these things whereof I have spoken would not change a body, except they
touched the same, therefore they are bodies. I likewise say that that part of
us which is so powerful that it pusheth, constrains, stays and commands
is a body: what therefore? does not fear restrain us? does not boldness
enforce us? does not fortitude harden and give force? does not moderation
bridle and restrain? does not joy extol? does not sadness dismay? To
conclude, whatsoever we do, we do it either by the command of malice or
virtue. That which commands the body is a body, that which adds force unto
the body is a body; the good of the body is a bodily good; the good of a man
is the good of the body, and therefore is it corporal. Because as thou
willedst me I have satisfied thy desire, now will I say that unto my self
which I see thou will say unto me: we play at Tables, our subtilty is spent on
trifles. These make not men good but learned. There is more plainness and
simplicity in true science. We need little learning to have a good conscience.
But as we in all other things are lavish in superfluities, so are we in
Philosophy, and abuse it with babill. Even as we are travailed with
intemperance in all things, so are we in good letters, we learn not to live
but to dispute.

He comfort LVCILIVS, and animateth him upon the flight of his servants.
That these and such like are incident unto life, and therefore not to be
reputed as sudden. Suffer that therefore which thou do not ^^nd. A good and
wise Epistle.

WHat is become of thy wisdom? Where is thy subtlety in conceiving things?
Where is thy magnanimity? Art thou traveled with such trifles? Thy servants
thought that thy occupation^ were the occasions of thy flight. If thy friends
should deceive thee (for let them have that name which Epicurus gave unto them
and be so called, what damage should thou receive? Thou want them who both
interrupted thy good actions, and made thee troublesome unto others. There is
no novelty or unexpected event herein. It is as ridiculous a thing to be
offended hereat, as to complain that thou art either wet with water, or
sprinkled with dirt as thou walk in the streets. The same is our condition
in this life, as if we were in a bath, amongst a multitude of people, or in a
great highway, some things will be intermitted, some things will befall. It is
no delicate thing to live. Thou art entered into a long way, wherein perforce
thou must slip, thou must iustle, thou must fall, thou must be wearied, and
thou must ^xclaime, O death! that is, thou lie. In one place thou shall leave
thy companion, in another thou shall bury him, in another thou shall fear
him; with such like inconveniences we must perform and tread this troublesome
journey. Will he have me die? Let our minds be prepared against all accidents,
let them know that they are come hither, Where sorrows and reuengefull cares
do sleep,
Where sickness pale and weary age do keep.
In the company of these must life be led; thou can not escape these, thou
may^st contemn them. And thou shall contemn them, if thou oftentimes bethink
thee on that which is to come, and suppose it present. Whosoever has of a long
time prepared himself unto any thing, he performs the same with greater
courage; and if he has premeditated any adversities, he makes head against
them afterward. Contrariwise, the man which is unprepared starteth back for
fear upon the least danger that presents it self. Let us take order that
nothing may befall us, which may move us to say, I had not thought it. And
because that novelties are most distasteful, such continual thought will bring
to pass, that thou shall not be apprentice to any adversity. Have thy
servants forsaken thee? They have robbed one, accused another, killed this man,
betrayed that, trampled under their feet and poisoned that man, and borne
false witness against another. All those mischiefs which thou can call to
memory have befalne diverse, and will hereafter happen. The arrows that are
shot against us are diverse and great in number. Some are sticking in us,
othersome are darted at us, and approach us nearly, and othersome there are
which are shot at our neighbors, which do no less grieve us then if they
were leuelled against our selves. Let us not wonder at any accident whatsoever,
we are borne thereunto, there is no man that has occasion to complain
himself, because that all men have their parts, yea their equal portion, for
if any man has escaped from an inconvenience, he might have felt it. But an
ordinance is equal unto all those to whom it is proposed, although all men
make not use thereof. Let us command our soul to continue in her entire, and
let us pay those tributes which we owe unto Nature without murmr. The Winter
brings on frosts, we be cold, the Summer brings heats with her, we shall
sweat for heat, the intemperature of the air tries our bodies; we shall be
sick. We shall meet in one place with a savage beast, or a roarer worse then
all beasts whatsoever. The one shall be drowned, the other brought to ashes.
We cannot alter this condition of things. That which we may is to have a
resolute heart, and worthy of a good man, by means whereof we endure all
accidents constantly, and content our selves with the order of Nature, which in
this present government causes those reuolutions which thou now obseruest.
After rain comes fair weather, after storms and tempests succeed calmes and
fair seasons. The winds blow the one after the other. We see one part of the
heavens, and the other is hidden from us. The world is composed of contrary
elements. Let us apply our souls unto this law, let her follow and obey the
same: let him think that all that which happens must happen, let her beware
in any sort to task Nature: it is good for thee to endure that which thou
can not amend, and to follow that great God without murmr or complaint, by
whose providence all things come to pass. The Soldier is not good that
unwillingly follows his Captain. And therefore let us obey her readily and
willingly, without intercepting the course of so fair a life, as man's life is,
in which is interlaced, all the evil which we suffer: and in conclusion, let
us speak unto God, by whose ordinance and direction all this round orb is
governed in the same terms, as our Cleanthes does in elegant verse, which I
will presume to translate into our tongue in imitation of Cicero, that thrice
eloquent Orator. If they please thee, it shall content me; if they distaste
thee, know that herein I am conformable unto Cicero. Hear then that which
Cleanthes says; O sovereign Father, and eternal Lord
Of highest heavens, conduct me at thy pleasure,
Unto thy powerful will I straight accord,
Make me not will, yet mourning without measure,
I Will wait upon thee, and in being bad
Suffer all that, which if my mind were just,
I might endure with all the strength I had,
Whither thou will, O God, I will and must:
I fly delays, both heart and feet are willing,
The Fates conduct, the forward draw the willing.
Let us live thus, let us speak thus, let the destinies find us always
addressed and willing. This courage that is thus bounded within the hands of
God, is the greatest in all kinds. Contrariwise, that man is both faint and
recreant that starteth back, that complains him of the government of the
world, and that had rather censure the gods then himself.

EPIST. CVIII.
How are the Philosophers either to be read or heard with judgment, and those
things in especial are to be chosen out of them, and put to memory, which
animate us to good life. They that seek delights study in vain; study thou
thy amendment. Neither is this hard to be done, for Nature her self inciteth
us unto honesty, for the seeds and incitements thereof are in our minds,
they grow and increase, when a learned teacher and animater does aid. This
proves he by his own example, when he was ATTALVS his scholar. Afterward he
shows that we come with diverse ends and minds to read Authors, and that we
Philosophers should do the like. Let us obey him: both read and hear you
that are lovers of learning.

THat whereof thou inquire, is of the number of those things which it
behooves thee only to know, to the end that a man may say that thou know it;
yet notwithstanding, since it is pertinent for thee to know it, and thou
pressest me so instantly, and wilt not attend those books which I will shortly
finish, that contain in good order all the part of Moral Philosophy, I will
presently resolve thee, yet first of all will I write unto thee how this desire
of learning, wherewith I see thee thus transported, should be governed, for
fear lest it hinder it self. Thou must neither overrun, nor greedily
invade all Sciences; by parts we attain the whole. The burden must be fitted
to the strength, neither ought we to embrace more then we are able to contain.
Draw not as much as thou will, but as much thou may hold. Only have thou a
good courage, and thou shall comprehend as much as thou please. The more the
mind receives, the more it is enlarged and greatned. These things, as I
remember, our Master Attalus taught us, when as we besieged his School, and
came first, and departed last, and provoked him, whilst he walked, to some
disputes; not only addressed to inform those that learned of him, but to meet
with them unprovoked. He that teaches (says he) and he that learneth should
have one and the same intention, the one to instruct, the other to profit. He
that comes unto the Philosophers Schools, must daily carry away some good
thing with him; either return more wise unto his home, or better disposed to
wisdom. But he shall return: for such is the power of Philosophy, that she
not only helps those that study the same, but those also which frequent
her. He that comes into the Sun, shall be Sunne-burnt, although he came not
to that end. They that sit down in a perfumers shop, and have stayed a while
therein, bear away with them the odor of such a place: and they that have
conuersed with a Philosopher, must needs draw somewhat, that might profit even
those that are negligent: mark what I say, negligent, but not repugnant. What
then? Know we not some men that for many years have conuersed and frequented
with a Philosopher, without receiving any tincture thereof? Why should I not
know them? yea and such as were most industrious and diligent, whom I rather
call the hosts, then the disciples of Philosophers. Some come to hear, not to
learn, as we are drawn into the Theater for our pleasures sake, to delight
our ears with Orations, Music, or Comedies. Thou shall see a great part of
the auditors that make the Philosophers School the Inn of their idleness.
Their intention is not in that place to dispossess themselves of some vices,
or to r^ceiue some instruction, or rule of life, whereby they might reform
their manners, but to enjoy some delight that tickleth their ears. Some other
there are that come to their ^ables, not to coat down matter, but words,
which they learn as well without other men's profit, as they heard them without
their own. Some rowse themselves when they hear any magnificent speeches, and
are affectioned no less then the speakers themselves, cheerful both in
looks and mind: neither are they otherwise moved, then those effeminate
French are wont to be, that hand and foot it according to the Phrygian
strain; these men are ravished and provoked by the beauty of things, not by
the sound of vain words. If any thing be spoken bitterly against death, if
ought be urged proudly against Fortune, thou art forthwith addressed to do
that which thou hear. They are affected, and let them be such as they are
commanded, if that form remain in the mind, and if the people, which
disswadeth all honest things, do not forthwith extinguish this worthy
forwardness. Few are they that could bring home with them that mind they had
conceived. It is an easy matter to stir up a hearer to the desire of that
which is right. For Nature has given unto all men the foundations and seeds of
virtue, all of us are borne unto all these things, when as a prouoker inciteth
our minds, then are those goods of the mind, which were in a manner laid
asleep, awakened and revived. See thou not how the Theaters ring as often as
some things are repeated, which we publicly acknowledge, and testify to be
true by consent. Poverty wants many things, auarite all things,
The covetous man is good to no man, and worst to himself.
The basest Broaker will applaud these vices, and is glad to hear his own
vices blamed. How much greater weight should these things have, being spoken by
a Philosopher, when as verses are interlaced with wholesome counsels: think
thou not that they will more effectually work in the minds of the unlettered.
For (as Cleanthes said) even as our breath yields a more clear sound, when
as the trumpet, after it has driven the same through the straits of a long
pipe, does at last give him a larger vent at the end thereof, so the strict
necessity of a vice makes our senses more clear. Those things are heard more
negligently, and persuade less powerfully, as long as they are delivered in
prose and ordinary discourse, but when as they are shut up in numbers and good
sense, be enclosed in certain feet and cadences, that very sentence is darted
and delivered as it were an arrow from a strong arm. Many things are spoken in
contempt of money, and in long orations we are taught this, that men should
think that their riches are in their minds, and not in their patrimonies, and
that he is rich who fitteth himself to his poverty, and makes himself rich
of a little. Yet are our minds more moued^ when such like things are spoken in
verse. He that coueteth little, has not need of much,
He has that which he would, who can wish as much as he would.
When we hear these or such like things, we are constrained to acknowledge the
truth. For they to whom nothing is enough admire, applaud, and publish their
hatred to many. When as thou see this affection of theirs urge the same,
press and prosecute this laying aside all ambiguit^e, syllogismes, cauil^, and
other vain subtilties of a fruitless brain, speak against avarice, inueigh
against dissoluteness, and when thou perceiuest that thou have profited, and
moved the hearts of thine auditorie, prosecute it with vehemency. It is
impossible that such a discourse, tending unto remedy, and entirely intended
for the good of the assembly, should be other then profitable. For those minds
that are not as yet obdurate may be easily induced to love right and virtue. If
truth find a fit and convenient advocate, she easily seizes on those that are
willing to learn, and less perverted. For mine own part, when as I heard
Attalus declaime against vices, errors, and the mischiefs of this life, I
oftentimes deplored the miseries of mankind, and have believed that he was
exalted and raised above all other men. He said likewise that he was a King,
but I thought him somewhat more, by reason that it was lawful for him to
censure Kings. But when he began to praise poverty, and to show that all that
which exceeds necessary use is a superfluous burden, and grievous to him
that bears the same, I oftentimes wished to depart poor out of his school.
When he began to traduce our pleasures, to praise a chaste body, a sober
table, a pure mind, not only exempted from unlawful pleasures, but also
superfluous, I required no more but to temper my appetite, and govern my
belly. From thence I gathered some good instructions my Lucillius: for with
earnest affection I attempted all things, and being afterward drawn unto a
Citizens life, I have conserved some few of those fair and good beginnings.
From thence it came that for all my life time I renounced eie-sores and
mushromes: for these are no meats, but entertain the appetite, and constrain
those that are full to eat more, which is very pleasing to those that are
gluttons, who desire no more but to fill their panches with such things which
easily enter, and are as easily uttered. I have abstained also ever since from
ointments and perfumes, because the best odor in our body is none at all.
Thereupon have I refrained wine, and during all my life time fled from bathing,
supposing it to be an unprofitable and nice custom to seethe the body and
consume it with sweating. These other customs in life, which I had given over,
are brought in request, yet so, that I keep a measure in these from which I
had abstained, and use them very little and with difficulty, because there are
certain things more easy to cut off wholly, then to govern well. Because I
have begun to declare unto thee with how much more greater courage I came to
Philosophy being a young man, then now when I am old, I will not be ashamed to
confess unto thee what love S^tion ingrafted in me in regard of Pithagoras; he
taught me why he and Sextius after him abstained from eating flesh. Each one of
these had a different cause, but both of them were magnificent. The one
supposed that man had sufficiency to feed upon without blood, and that a
custom of cruelty began, when tearing of flesh was drawn to be a pleasure.
Hereunto he added, that the matter of dissolution should be contracted and
gathered^ that multiplicity of meats were contrary to man's health, and nothing
healthful to our bodies. But Pithagoras held that there was a communion and
consanguinitie of all things, with the one and the other, and that the one is
changed into the other, in such sort that (if a man will believe him) no soul
perishes neither cease but for a small time whilst it is infused into
another body. We shall see by what reuolutions of seasons, and after how many
aboades in diverse bodies, the soul shall reenter into a man, mean while this
opinion has made men fearful, for they have been afraid to become murderers
and paricides because that in eating of a beast they might as well seize on
their fathers soul, and with knife or tooth offend a thing wherein the soul
of any one of their kindred might be lodged. Sotion having proposed and
confirmed this by his arguments, added hereunto, Do thou not believe, says
he, that souls are distributed from one body to another, and that which we
call death is no other thing but a passage from one body into another? Do
thou not believe that in these tame or savage beasts either killed or drowned,
there suru^ueth sometimes the soul of a man? will thou deny that nothing
perishes in the world, but does but only chang^ air and country, and that
not only the heavens turn, but that living creatures and souls likewise have
their reuolutions? Diverse great personages have believed these things, and
therefore hold thou thine opinion in suspense, yet keep thou all things
entire unto thy self. If these things be true it is innocence to abstain from
living creatures: if they be false it is frugalitie; what damag^ receiu^th thy
cru^ltie h^reby? I take from thee the meat of Lions and Vultures. Persuaded
thus by these arguments, I began to abstain from flesh, and ere a year was
finished, the custom was not only easy unto me but pleasing. I thought my
spirit more free then it was before; neither can I at this time justify unto
thee whether it were so or no. Do thou ask me how I have discontinued this
manner of lif^? It was in my younger days, at such time as Tiberius was
Emperor, when as the Religions of strangers were banished out of Rome, and to
prove the superstitions of the same, they alleged that they abstained from
touching the flesh of some creatures. So then upon my fathers request who
feared not reproach, but hated Philosophy I returned to my former custom:
neither was it a hard matter for him to persuade me to begin to sup better.
Attalus was wont to praise a hard bed, and such as resists the body: such a
one use I now in mine old days, wherein you cannot discover any print where I
have lien. Th^se things have I related unto thee, to let thee know how vehement
the first apprehensions of young children be, and how inclined unto all good
things, if any man exhort them or egg them forward. But in some kind the
teachers are deficient, who teach us to dispute, and not to live: in some sort
the learners who bring unto their Masters a purpos^ not to rectify their
judgments, but polish their tongues; so that which was Philosophy is mad^
Philologie. But it is very pertinent to the matter to examine with what purpose
thou addressest thy self to any thing. He that examineth Virgil to that intent
he may become a Grammarian: he reads not with this intent that worthy verse
of his, Time flies and never is to be recald again.
You must watch: except we make have we are forsaken. The day that swiftly
fleeteth from us, drives us forward and is driven away. We are ravished before
we know it. We dispose of all things as if we were to live long time, and midst
so many dange^s we are sluggards. But to observe that as often as Virgil
writes of the swiftness of time, he uses this word flies, The better days
of wretched mortal life,
First fly then sickness reigns, and irksome age,
And tedious labor rules and waxes rise,
And lastly death sweepes all with mortal rage.
He that truly addicteth himself unto Philosophy, applies such sentences as
befitteth him: never, says he, that the days go, but that they fly, which
is the most swiftest kind of running, and that the better times are ravished
from us first. Why therefore cease we to spur on our idleness, to the end we
might outstrip the time which fleeteth away so swiftly. The better days fly
away, the worse succeed. Even as out of a vessel the purest flows out first,
and that which is most heavy and troubled setleth in the bottom, so that which
is first in our life is the best. We rather suffer others to draw out the
purest, to the intent to reserve the dregs unto our selves. Let this sentence
be imprinted in our minds, and pleas^ us as much as if it were an Oracle sent
from heaven, The best days of wretched mortal life,
Fly first --
Why the best? Because that which remains is uncertain. Why the best?
Because being young we may learn, and convert, and addict our tender minds,
and pliable to the better, unto the best: because this time is fit for labor,
fit to exercise our wits in study, and our bodies with labor. That which
remains is more slow and faulty, and nearer to the end. Let us therefore
wholly apply our selves th^reunto, and laying aside all these speculations,
whereby we have been seduced, let us apply our selves to one only thing, for
fear left at last we learn over late to our confusion, that it is impossible
to stay and recover the time that fleeteth away so fast, without hope of
return. Let every first day please us as if it were the best, and let us
reckon it properly ours, and let us prevent that which ensues. This does not
he think that reade^ this verse with a Grammarians eye; that therefore every
first day is the best, because sickenesses succeed, old age presses and
pearcheth over the head of those, who as yet think themselves young; but
says, that Virgil always united sicknesses and old age together, and in
truth not without cause, for old age is an incurable dis^ase. Besides, says
he, the Poet surnamed old age, irksome: Then sickness reigns, and irksome
age.
Wonder not that from the same matter every man gathered that which is
agreeable to his conceit. In the same field the Ox seeks his grass, the Dog
his Hare, and the Storke his Lizard: when those books which Cicero wrote of a
Commonweal, fall into the hands of him that would know all things, and of a
Grammarian, and of a Philosopher, every one of these three has his proper and
peculiar election and thought. The Philosopher wondereth that so many things
may b^ spoken against justice. When this loue-prattle comes to the same
reading, he notes this, that there are Roman Kings, whereof the one had no
father, and the other no mother: for each man doubts which was Seruius
mother, and Ancus father, who was reputed Numaes Nephew, is not to be found.
Besides, he observes that he whom we call Dictator, and is so entitled in
Histories, was by those in former times called the Master of the people, as it
manifestly appears at this day in the books of the Augurs, and that he whom
we call the master of the knights, has taken his name from thence. He notes
likewise that Romulus died during the Eclips of the Sun, that there was an
appeal from the Kings unto the people, as also Fenestella holds that it is
contained in the Registers of the Bishops. When a Grammarian explicateth the
same books, he first of all notes in his Commentary that Cicero used this
word Reapse for Reipsa, that is to say, indeed, and Sepse likewise for Seipse,
that is to say, himself. Then passes he over to those things which the custom
of the age has changed, such are those which Cicero used, Because we are
recalled by his importunity from the calce hereof, that is, from the end of the
course: for that which now we call limits, those in times past called Calcem,
that is to say, the heel or end of the foot. Aft^r this he gathers Ennius
verses, and ^specially those which were written by Scipio the African, To whom
no friend or enemy in field,
Could lend that help which he to them did yield.
Hereby he says that he means that this word opera, that is to say labor in
times past signified Auxilium, that is to say, aid and succor: for he says
that there was not one either Citizen or enemy could render Scipio the reward
of his labor. Furthermore, he esteems himself happy to have found out this
why it pleased Virgil to say, Ore whom the mighty gate of heaven did thunder.
He says that Ennius stole this from Homer, and Virgil from Ennius. We read
in the same books of Cicero this Epigram of Ennius, If it be free for any one
to ascend the heavenly throne,
The greatest gate of highest heaven is open to me alone.
But for fear least I my self in thinking on other matters should my self
become a humanist or Pedant, I say unto thee that we ought to refer that
which we hear spoken by the Philosophers, and that which we read in their
books to this end, that we become virtuous, and not to affect old and fained
words, nor to affect extrauagant and unaccustomed manners of speaking, but let
us search out those precepts, which may profit us, and such magnificent and
manly sentences, which may be suddenly effected. So let us apply th^se things,
that those things which were words may be works. But I think that no men do
worse deserve of mortal men, then they who have learned Philosophy as it were
some mercinarie occupation, who live otherwise then they instruct other men to
live: for they themselves carry about themselves, as examples of unprofitable
doctrine, being otherwise slaves to every sort of vice which possesses them.
Such a Master can as little profit me as a Pilot that is Sea-sicke in the
midst of a tempest: when the billows are increased the helm must be steered;
we must strive with the Sea, and strike and hale in sail: what can a Master of
a Ship help me that is astonished and vomiteth? With how more greater tempest
think thou is humane life tossed more then any ship? We are not to speak,
but to govern. All that which they say, all that which they boast of before
the common sort is to no purpose. Plato, Zeno, Chrysippus, Posidonius, and an
army of such Philosophers have said and resaid it often. I will show thee how
they may approve these things to be their own; let them act that which they
said. Because I have spoken those things which I would have carried unto thee,
I will now satisfi^ thy desire, and I will r^ferre the whole of that which thou
requirest at my hands to another Epistle, lest having thy head wearied, thou
bend thy attentive and curious ear to hear a difficult matter.

EPIST. CIX.
A short question: Whether a wiseman may profit a wiseman, and how? The
cause of doubt is, because that all things are high in a wiseman; neither may
any thing be added to him: yet answers he that he does profit, and
distinctly approves it. In the end he detesteth unprofitable subtilties.

THou desire to know whether a wiseman may be profitable to a wiseman: we
say that a wiseman is replenished with all goodness, and has attained to the
fullness of perfection. The question is how a man may profit him that has
attained the chiefest good. Good men profit one another; for they exercise
virtue and contain wisdom in her estate, both of these require some man with
whom he may confer, with whom he may debate; use execiseth those who are
cunning in wrestling, and warns the Musician who has learned unisons. A
wiseman like wise has need to have his virtues stirred, so that even as he
moves himself, so is he moved by another wiseman. What can a wiseman
pro^ite a wiseman? He will animate him, and show him occasions of honest
actions. Besides these, he will discover some of his own thoughts, and will
teach those things which he has invented. For there will be always somewhat
remaining for a wiseman to ^inde out, and whereon his mind may be employed
and occupied. An evil man hurts an evil man, he makes him worse by inciting
wrath or fear, by assenting to sadness, by praising pleasures; and even then
are evil men most trauail^d and troubled, when they have made a mixture of
many vices, and wickedness becomes complete. Therefore on the contrary side,
a good man may profit a good man. But how say thou? He will bring him joy,
he will confirm his confidence, and both of their joys shall encreas^ by
beholding their mutual tranquillity. Besides, he shall deliver him the notice
of some things: for a wiseman knows not all things; and although he knew
them, yet may some man invent more compendious ways in things, and teach the
same by which more easily the whole work is compassed. A wiseman shall be
pro^itable to a wiseman, not only in regard of his own forces, but in
respect of his also whom h^ helps. And he himself likewise b^ing left unto
himself can express his own parts. Let him make use of his own swiftnesse^
yet notwithstanding he helps him also that encourages him that runs. A
wiseman is not only profitable to a wiseman but to himself. To this thou will object, Take from him his proper forces, and he does nothing. In this sort
thou may say that there is no sweetness in honey: for he that eats the
same must be apt both in tongue and pallat to ^ntertain this taste, that he may
be delighted and not offended with the savor thereof: for some there are to
whom honey seems bitter in regard of their sickness. Both of them must be
such, that both the one may teach, and the other be disposed to receive
instructions. It were in vain, says he, to warm him more that has been
hot to the extremity, and as vain is it to better him that has attained the
fullness o^ goodness. Does a husbandman that is his crafts-master in tillage,
seek^ instructions from another? Does a soldier that is sufficiently armed to
enter the ^ield desire any further defense? Therefore not a wiseman^ for he is
sufficiently instructed and armed for life. He that is in the height of heat,
had no need of heat to warm him: ^urther, heat it self, says he, contains
it self; To this I answer, first of all, there is a great difference betwixt
these things which thou comparest. For heat is one, but to profit is diverse.
Again, heat is not increased in heat by the adiection of heat. A wiseman
cannot stand in the habit of his mind, except he admit some friends like
himself, with whom he may communicate his virtues. Furthermore, add hereunto
that there is a certain friendship between all virtues. He therefore
profits that loves any man's virtues that are equal with his, and gives
order also that his may be beloved: Those things that are alike do delight,
especially if they be honest, and know how to approve and to be approved. It is
true, no other man but a wise man can cunningly move a wise-mans mind, even as
no man may reasonably move a man, except he be a man. Even as therefore there
needs reason to help reason, so to move perfect reason, there needs
perfect reason. They are said to profit us that give us means, as money,
grace, health, and other things which are necessary and dear to the use of
humane life, in these even a fool shall be said to profit a wiseman. But to
profit and aid another is to move his thought by his virtue, and according to
Nature, or by the virtue of him that shall be moved. And this also cannot be
done without his good that profits; for in exercising another man's virtue,
he must needs exercise his own. But that thou may remove these things,
which either are the chiefest goods, or the efficients of the chiefest: yet
notwithstanding wisemen may profit amongst themselves. For it is a thing that
of it self meriteth to be desired by a wiseman, to meet with another wise
man, because that naturally a good thing is desired of his like, and a virtuous
man acquainteth himself with another virtuous man, as willingly as with
himself. I must needs for argument sake pass over from this question to
another. For it is demanded whether a wiseman will deliberate, or demand
counsel of another man, which is necessary for him to do, when he will
entreat of ciull or domestical matters, or to speak more rightly, of mortal
things. In this case he has need of another counsel, as of a Physician, a
master of a ship, an advocate and proctor. A wiseman sometimes may be
profitable to a wiseman, for he will persuade him. But in those great and
divine things also, as we have said, he shall be profitable by ordinarily
entreating of honest things, and by intermixing both their minds and thoughts.
Besides, it is according to Nature, both to embrace friends, and to conceive as
much joy of a friends good action, as of his own. For if we do not thus,
virtue shall not remain in us, which in exercising her self takes luster by
use. But virtue persuades us to dispose well of the present, to bethink on
that which is to come, to deliberate and intend the mind, and more easily
shall he intend and explicate the same, who takes and entertaineth another
unto him. He seeks therefore either a perfect man, or one that profits, or
is near unto perfection. But that perfect man will profit, if by common
prudence the one helps the others counsel. They say that men see more in
other men's business then in their own, and this befalls those men whom
self-love blinds, and to those also, whom fear of danger drives from all
consideration of profit. The man that is assured and delivered from fear, will
recover his courage and become wise. Yet notwithstanding there are some things,
which even they who are the wisest do more diligently discover in others then
in themselves. Moreover, that which is most sweetest and honestest, a wiseman
will procure a wiseman to will and nill the same which he does. They shall
bear together a worthy charge; I have performed that which thou requiredst at
my hands^ although it were couched in the order of those things, which we have
comprised in our books of moral Philosophy. Bethink thee of that which I
have told thee often, that we do but exercise and whet our wits upon these
questions: for oft-times return I thither. What does this thing profit me?
will it make me stronger, iuster, or more temperate? I have yet no leisure to
exercise my self, I stand in need of a Physician. Why teach thou me an
unprofitable Science? Thou have promised me great matter, but I see little.
Thou said I should be dreadlesse, yea although swords glistered about me,
although the point were ready to pierce my throat: thou said I should be
secure, although I saw fires flaming about me, although a sudden whirle-winde
should ravish and bear away my Bark through the whole Ocean. Do thou thus
much for me, that I may contemn pleasure and glory, then shall thou
afterward teach me how to resolve difficulties, distinguish ambiguities, and
pry into those things that are obscure, now teach me those things that are
necessary.

EPIST. CX.
That each one of us have our GENII, which he has favorable unto him,
whosoever has a good mind. That the vows and judgments of those men are
wicked, who estimate not things according to their value. That vain things are
wished for, and vain things feared, and that the remedy of both is from
Philosophy, whereunto he summoneth us, having shaken off superfluities. In
conclusion, he discovers excess, and reproves it by ATTALVS worthy speech.

I Salute thee from my house at Nomentanum, and will thee to have a good mind,
that is, all the gods propitious unto thee, who are favorable and well
affected toward him, whosoever is reconciled unto himself. Lay apart for this
present, the opinions of some men, that every one of us has given him a
Pedagogue or God, not of the ordinary, but those of the inferior note, and of
the number of those whom Ovid names popular gods. Yet so would I have thee lay
these things apart, that thou remember thy self that our predecessors, who
have believed these things, were Stoickes, for they attributed unto every one
his Genius, and goddess Juno. Hereafter we will examine whether the gods have
so much leisure to procure and provide for particular men's affairs. In the
mean while know thou this, that whether we are resigned to a several Genius,
or else neglected and given over unto Fortune, that thou can wish no man a
greater mischief, then if thou should desire that he may be his own
enemy. Neither need thou wish any man, whom thou think worthy
punishment, to have the gods displeased with him; for I tell thee they are
auerse, although his life seems to prosper and flourish under their care and
favor. Consider and examine thou diligently what humane affairs be, not what
they are called, and thou shall know that more evils befall us by our selves,
then through the hand of casualtie. For how oft-times has that which is called
calamity been the cause and beginning of our felicity. How oftentimes has a
thing entertained with great applause, builded it self a degree from whence it
may fall headlong, and has raised some one high, that was already eminent,
as if he should as yet continue in this place, from whence he might safely
fall? yet that falling, if thou consider the end, beyond which Nature directs
no man, has not any evil in it self. The end of all things is at hand, it is
at hand I say, as well that from whence a happy man is driven by violence, as
that from whence a miserable man is happily delivered. Both these enlarge we,
and make them long by fear and hope. But if thou be wise, measure all
things by humane condition, and restrain the occasions that may make thee joy,
or make thee fear. It were better have no joy that endures long, and not to
have a fear likewise that endures long. But why do I thus restrain this
evil? Think not that there is any thing that thou should fear. These are
but vain things which move and astonish us, none of us has as yet examined
the truth thereof, but each one has taught the other to fear. No man has
dared to approach that which procured his fear, or know the nature and good of
his own affright. And therefore it is, that a thing so fallacious and vain is
yet r^doubled, because no man disproueth or discovers the same. Let us only
bethink our selves to open our eyes, and it shall presently appear how short,
incertaine, and secure things are feared. Such is the confusion of our minds,
as Lucretius describes it. For even as in the blind and darkest night,
Young children quake for fear, and shake with fright,
So fear we likewise in the clearest light.
What then? are not we more foolish then children that fear at no one days?
But this is false, Lucretius, we fear not in the light, we have made all
things darkness to our selves: we see nothing, neither that which hurts us,
nor that which helps us; all our lifetime we run, and wander here and
there, yet for all this we never make stop, nor consider at any time where we
fix our feet. And yet thou see how furious a thing it is to run headlong in
the dark, yet undoubtedly we do thus, to the end we may be recalled from a
further off, and whereas we are ignorant whither we are carried, yet persevere
we to run swiftly thither, whither we intended. But if we will that the day may
break, yet but after one manner, that is, if a man receive the knowledge of
these humane and divine things, if instead of merely sprinkling himself
therewith, he takes the tincture thereof, if although he know the same, he
often debateth thereupon; and relates it oftentimes to himself. If he have
sought what things are good and evil, and what things do unworthily challenge
this title, if he enquire what things are honest or dishonest, and what is
providence: neither within these bounds is the quickness of humane
understanding circumscribed. She takes pleasure to cast her eye beyond the
world, to examine whither it is carried, whence it came, to what period so
great a swiftnes of things hasteneth. From this so high contemplation have we
drawn our minds into the consideration of sordide and base things, for to be
slaves to avarice, so as ouer-slipping the earth and the bounds thereof, and
the gods which govern and dispose all things, we have employed the same in
consideration of embowelling the earth, and not content with the goods which
were offered, to search out what evil might be diggen out of it. Whatsoever is
for our good, our good God and Father has laid by us. He expected not our
inquisition, he gave it freely, and buried those things that were hurtful for
us in the bosom of the earth. We have cause to complain of none other but
our selves. We in spite of Nature, and when she had closely hidden them, have
brought those things to light, which are the instruments of our ruin. We have
dedicated our minds unto pleasures, the entertainment and allowance whereof is
the beginning of all our mischiefs. We have given it over to ambition and
fame, and other things as vain and fruitless as these. What therefore now do
I exhort thee to do? No new thing, for we seek no remedies for new evils, but
this, especially to consider in thy self, what thing is necessary, and what
superfluous. That which is necessary, thou shall find every where before
thee, but as touching those that are superfluous, thou must always run after
them, and thou shall hardly find them. Neither have thou cause to praise thy
self too much, if thou contemnest golden beds, and household stuff garnished
with precious stones. For what virtue is it to contemn superfluities? Then
admire thou thy self, when thou contemnest necessary things. Thou do no
great thing, when as thou can live without Kingly entertainment, when thou
desire not wild boares of a thousand pounds weight, nor the tongues of
Phenicopteres, nor such other monsters of gluttony, which this day takes no
delight in whole beasts, but desires and longs after the leg of one, and the
wing of another, and such and such members of another. Then shall I admire thee
when thou contemnest not the brownest bread: if thou persuade thy self that
herbs when necessity requires, do not only grow for the use of beasts, but
for the nourishment of man. If thou know that the buds of trees are
sufficient to fill the belly, into which we gather so many precious things, as
if it were a storehouse to conserve them in, we must fill the same without
loathing. For what skilleth it what it receives, since it must lose whatsoever
it has received. Thou take pleasure to see a rank of platters charged with
foul and fish. There are meats which please thine appetite, because they are
young and tender: contrariwise there are others less sauourie unto thee, if
they be not so thick and fa^ as they melt in their grease. The very
artificial smell of these delights thee. But undoubtedly these meats so
carefully sought out, and so cunningly sauced, being swallowed down into the
belly, convert themselves into ordure of the same color, and stincke. Will thou contemn the voluptuousness of meats, look upon them in thy
closestoole. I remember that ATTALVS, not without the admiration of all men,
was wont to say this: Riches, said he, have oftentimes deceived me, when I saw
any piece of them shine here or there, I stood in admiration to behold them. I
thought that those which were hidden, were like those which were showen. But in
a certain Circensian show I saw all the riches of the City embolished with
gold and silver, and those things which exceeded either gold or silver in
price, exquisite colors, and garments that were brought not only from over
uttermost territories, but beyond the furthest confines of our enemies. On this
side the troops of children, seemly both in their habit and form: on that
side of women, and other things, which the fortune of the greatest Empire
having sought out her greatest riches, had brought forth. What other thing is
this (said he) then to irritate the lusts and desires of men that are too
forward of themselves? What means this pomp of money? We are assembled
together to learn avarice. But undoubtedly I carry hence less covetousness
then I brought with me. I contemned riches, not by reason they were
superfluous, but because they were things of a small value. See thou not in
how small a time this so mighty show passed over, although they marched but
slowly, and were rancked orderly? Shall this which could not fill the space of
an hour, occupy our whole life? He likewise added this. They seemed unto me
as superfluous to those that had them, as those that beheld them. I therefore
say thus to my self, as oftentimes as any such thing encountreth mine eyes, as
often as I see a rich and sumptuous house, a rich guard of servants, a Litter
carried by goodly Lackeyes. Why wonderest thou? why art thou amassed? it is but
pomp. These things are shown, not possessed; and whilst they please they
pass by. Rather convert thy self unto true riches, learn to ^e content with
a little, and with a great and manly mind exclaim thus; Let us have water,
let us have barley steeped in water, and let us contend with IVPITER himself
for felicity. Let us, I pray thee, do thus although these things be wanting.
It i^ a base thing to build a blessed life, either on gold or silver, and as
base to found it on water and steeped barley^ what shall I therefore do if
these things be missing? Do thou ask me what remedy there is against need?
hunger ends hunger, otherwise what imports it if the things that make thee
a slave be great or little? What matters it how much it be that fortune may
deny thee? This very water and steeped barley is at another man's command, but
he is the free man, not over whom fortune has the least power, but he over
whom she has no power at all. It is so. Thou must desire nothing if thou will
provoke Jupiter that desires nothing. These things spoke Attalus unto us, but
nature cries it in all men's ears, which if thou will oftentimes think upon,
thou shall make thy self really, not seemingly happy, and in effect seem
such unto thy self, and not unto others.

EPIST. CXI.
He proves that cauils are but a vain and base kind of Philosophy, and that
that part which concerns manners is true, firm, and sublimed. Counsailing us
to retire to that study.

THou have enquired of me what those things are called in Latin, which the
Grecians call Sophismat^^ many men have endeavored to express the same, but no
man has performed it; and the reason is, because the thing it self was not
received by vs^ neither had in use, and therefore likewise was the name of no
account^ yet that in my judgment was the most fittest which Cicero used, who
called them Cauillationes, that is to say Cauils; to which whosoever addicteth
himself, he forgeth subtle questions, yet do they profit him nothing unto
life, neither is he made the stronger, more temperate, or more lifted up. But
he that has exercised Philosophy for his own remedy sake is made mighty in
mind, full of confidence invincible, and more great the nearer he approaches the
same. That which falls out in the greatest mountains, whose height appears
l^ast to those that behold them from a far, and the nearer you approach them,
the more manifestly appears it what their immeasurable height is: such, my
Lucilius, is a true and no count^rfeit Philosopher; he stands in a high
place, admirable, upright, and truly great. He raises not himself on his
feet, neither walks on his tiptoes, after the manner of those that help
their height by shift, and would seem ^onger then they be, he contenteth
himself with his greatness. Why should he not content himself, since he is
grown so far, as fortune reaches not her hand unto him^ and therefore is he
above all humane things. He is always like himself in all things that may
happen, whether the Navigations of his life floateth under a prosperous winde^
or be tossed by storms and adverse dangers. This constancy these cauils (of
which I have spoken a little before) cannot affect. The mind dallieth with
these, but profits not he cas^eth Philosophy from her throne, and brings
her unto the plain; neither would I forbid thee to practice these things
sometimes, yet let it be then when thou would do nothing, yet have they
this one cursed quality in them, they leave a certain touch of delight
behind them, and possess and arrest the mind that is induced by the
appearance of subtlety; mean while, infinite and important affairs remain
behind, and scarcely may our whole life suffice to learn this one thing,
which is how to contemn life. What to govern it say thou? This is the
second work: for no man ever well ruled it except he contemned it.

EPIST. CXII.
He despaireth the reformation of his friend, old in years and vices.

Undoubtedly I desire that thy friend according to thy wish should be both
formed and instructed; but he is held ouer-hard, or rather (which is more
troublesome) he is held over tender, and broken by evil and daily customs. I
will yield thee an example out of the husbandry I profess: It is not every
Vine that is fit for grafting; if it be old and worme-eaten, if it be weak
and slender, either it receives not the young plant, or nourishes it not, or
it will not join with it, neither will communicate his quality and nature to
the same. We therefore are accustomed to cut it above the ground, to the end
that if it fail, a man may assay another experiment, and set him once more
into the earth. This man of whom thou writest, and whom thou recommendest, has
no forces. He has been in such sort addicted unto vices, that he is both
dried and indurate. He cannot receive or nourish reason, yet is he desirous.
Believe him not: I say not that he lies unto thee, he thinks he desires. He
is angry with the excess he has made, yet will he shortly fall in league with
it again. But he says that he is offended with his life: I will not deny it;
for who is not offended? men both love and hate their lives. Then therefore
will we give our judgment of him, when he has approved unto us that his
excess is hateful unto him; but now they are greatly at odds.

EPIST. CXIII.
He questioneth whether virtues be living creatures. He stoically affirms
that the vices and affections are no less. Then preferred he a dispute, that
were ridiculous in th^se days. He disswadeth us from such like, and summoneth
us to th^se things that are profitable to life.

THou desire me to write unto thee what I think of this question so much
canuassed amongst Stoics, whether justice, fortitude, prudence, and the rest
of the virtues are living creatures. By this subtilty, my dearest Lucilius, we
give occasion to some to think that we whet our wits about unprofitable
things, and that we lose our time in such disputes as serve to no purpose. Yet
will I do that which thou desire, and express unto thee what the opinion of
our Stoics is; yet protest I that I am of anoth^r opinion. I think there are
some things that be^ome those that wear the ^at and cloak amongst the
Grecians. I will therefore tell thee what the reasons were which moved
antiquity. It appears that the soul is a living creature, considering she
is the efficient cause whereby we are animated: and for that living creatures
have der^ued this name from her. But virtue is naught else then a soul
possessing her self in some so^t, it is therefore an animal. Againe^ virtue
does something, but nothing can be done without motion; if she hau^ motion,
which none has except it be a living creature, she is a living creature: and
if she be a living creature, then virtue contains virtue in her self, why
not? she has her self. Even as a wiseman does all things by the assistance
of virtue, so does virtue by her self: and th^rfore s^ith he, all Arts, and
all those things which we think, and whatsoever we comprehend in our minds
are animals. It follows therefore that in those narrow breasts of ours there
inhabiteth diverse thousands of animals, and that every one of us are many
animals, or contain many animals in our selves. Ask thou me what is
answered hereunto? Each one of these things shall be an animal, and no^
diverse. The reason? I will tell it thee, if thou will hear me patiently and
attentiuely^ all animals ought to have each of them a proper substance: all
animals have one soule^ they cannot therefore subsist every one, neither can
they be diverse. I am an animal, and a man, thou will not therefore say that I
am two. Why? To make them two, they ought to be severed the one from the other.
Every one of diverse sorts has but one nature, and therefore is but one. My
soul is an animal, and I my self am one also; yet for all this are we not
two. Why? By reason that my soul is a part of me. Then shall any thing be
numbered by it self, when it consists by it self, but when it is a part and
member of another, it cannot seem to be another thing. And why? I will tell
thee. Because that which is another must be his own, and properly his own, and
wholly his own, and absolute within it self. I have declared that I was of
another opinion: for not only shall virtues be animals if this be admitted, but
those vices and affections which are opposite unto them likewise, such as are
wrath, fear, sorrow and suspicion. And yet this thing shall proceed further,
all sentences, all thoughts shall be animals, which must in no sort be
admitted. For every thing that a man does is not a man; what is justice, says
he? A soul that possesses her self in some sort: if therefore the soul be
an animal, justice is an animal. Nothing so: for this is a habit and certain
power of the soul. The same soul is converted into diverse figures, and yet is
not the soul an animal, so oftentimes as it changes thus; neither is that
which the soul does an animal. If justice, magnanimity and those other
virtues be animals, I demand of thee if sometimes they cease to be, or if they
begin again, or if they be always? Virtues cannot cease to be virtues,
therefore many living creatures are animals, nay, more innumerable animals are
in this soul. There are not many (says he) but this is but one soul
assembled of diverse, which are the members and parts of one. By this reckoning
we represent unto our selves such a form as the Hydra^ which has diverse
heads, each one of which fights and hurts by it self. But none of those
heads is an animal but the head of an animal, yet is she but one animal. No
man said that in Chimera the Lion was an animal, or the Dragon; these are the
parts of him, but the parts are not animals. Where do thou gather that
justice is an animal? It acts, says he, somewhat and profits. But that
which does somewhat and pro^iteth, and has force and motion^ Ergo, that which
has force and motion is an animal. True it is, if it have his own force and
motion, but it has not his own force and motion, but that of the soul. Every
Animal until it die is that which it began to be. A man until he die is a
man, so likewise a horse and a dog, for they cannot pass into another form
and substance. Justice that is the soul which possesses it self in any sort,
is an Animal. Let us believe it. Moreover, Magnanimity, that is to say, the
soul in any sort mistress of her self, is an Animal. What soul is that? That
which even now was Justice, is enclosed in the first Animal, and cannot pass
into another Animal, but must remain in him where she began to be.
Furthermore, one soul cannot be in two living creatures together, much less
in many. If Justice, Magnanimity, Temperance, and those other virtues be
Animals. How can they have but one soul, it must needs fall out that every one
has his own^ else cannot they be Animals. One body cannot be the body of
diverse Animals. What is, says he, the body of Justice, the soul, and of
magnanimity also; but one body cannot be the body of two Animals. But some
one will say, that one and the same soul has taken the habitude of Justice,
magnanimity and temperance, This might be, if at such time as Justice was in
vigor, magnanimity was not, and when value was, temperance was not. But all
virtues are together. How should these be different Animals, since there is but
one soul, which can make but one Animal. Furthermore, no Animal is a part of
another Animal. But Justice is a part of the soul, it is not therefore an
Animal. Truly in my judgment, it is but lost time to contest upon a matter
that is granted, we should rather be angry thereat, then dispute thereupon. No
Animal is a part of another. Consider all men's bodies, and there is not one of
them but has his particular color, form, and proportion. Amidst other
miracles, which make the wisdom of God the Creator admirable, I esteem this
to be one, that amidst so many things that are created, the one resembles not
the other, and as touching those that are like one another, yet will there be
some difference found, if thou curiously observe the same. He has made
infinite sorts of leaves distinguished the one from the other by some special
mark. Infinite and different Animals, yea even those which are of the same
kind, do not in every part resemble one another. The Creator has required
and obtained this of himself, that these Animals of different kinds should
not resemble one another, either in form or proportion. Thou say that all
the Virtues are like one another, and therefore they are not Animals. There is
not any Animal but does something of it self. But Virtue does nothing by her
self, but with a man. All living creatures are either endowed with reason, as
men and gods, or deprived of reason as beasts are. Virtues are endowed with
reason, and yet for all that, they are neither gods nor men, and consequently
they are not Animals. Every reasonable living creature does nothing, except it
be first incited and pushed forward in regard and consideration of something:
this stirs the ^am^^ and then consent stirs this motion. As touching
Consent, see here (...) it is. I must walk out, I set forward, after I am
commanded so to do, and ^^uing found it good. I must sit down, and then I sit.
This Consent is not in Virtue. Presuppose that Prudence is a living creature,
how should she consent? I must of necessity set forward, Nature opposes her
self against this point, for Prudence provides not for her self, but for him
that is endowed with her, which cannot go nor sit down, and therefore has no
consent. That which is deprived of judgment and consent, is not a living
creature endowed with reason. If Virtue be a living creature, she is a
reasonable living creature. But she is a reasonable living creature: Ergo, no
living creature. If Virtue be a living creature, and virtue be a good thing,
every good thing is a living creature. The Stoickes auow this. It is a good
thing for a man to save his fathers life, to speak materially and to the
purpose, his opinion in public assembly, to give a sentence according to the
laws, by this reckoning to save a man's father, shall be a living creature, and
to think and debate well, another. In brief, this Paradox will seem^ so great
in the end, that a man cannot contain himself from laughter. To know how to
hold a man's peace in time and place, to sup well is a good thing, and therefore
to hold a man's peace, and to sup well, are living creatures. I will not cease
to tickle my self, and make me pleasure by these follies. Truly if Justice and
Magnanimity be living creatures, they are terrestrial, every terrestrial
living creature suffers cold, hunger and thirst. So Justice has a cold,
Magnanimity is hungry, and Clemency dry. Moreover, I would willingly ask of
these Doctors, if these living creatures have the figure of a man, of a horse,
or of a savage beast. If they attribute unto them a round form, as they do
unto God, I would ask of them, whether covetousness, riot, and folly are
round? For these likewise are Animals, if they be round. I would desire them
further to let me know, if to walk discreetly be a living creature or no? They
must of necessity confess that it is a living creature of a round form. But
to the end thou may know that I speak by my book, and that it is not my
private opinion which I here do publish. Cleanthes and his scholar
Chrysippus are not one in opinion, as touching this walking. Cleanthes says
that it is an agitation dis^persed from the head unto the feet. Chrysippus is
of another opinion: why then according to Chrysippus example cannot any man
maintain that which he shall judge to be the best, and laugh at the number of
these Animals, so great, as the world would be too little to contain them. The
Stoics say that Virtues are not diverse Animals, and yet notwithstanding that
they are Animals, even as one man is an Orator and Poet, so are Virtues
Animals, and not diverse living creatures, but one only. The soul that is
just, prudent, and courageous, is one and the same, being in some sort in
possession of her self, in every one of the virtues. The dispute cease, we
are agreed, for I confess that the soul is a living creature, referring it to
another place to speak my opinion as touching the same. I deny that the
actions of the soul are living creatures, otherwise all the words, and every
Poets verses should be living creatures. For if a word well spoken be a good
thing, and every good thing be a living creature, the word shall be a living
creature. A verse that is well made is good, that which is good is called an
Animal, and consequently a verse shall be an Animal: and so Arma virumque cano,
Is an Animal, which cannot for all that be round, because it is a verse of six
feet. All this is but mere Sophistry, which being well examined makes me
ready to swound with laughing, when I remember that a Solecisme, a Barbarism,
and a Syllogism is an Animal, and I depaint every one of them such a form as
best likes me. These things dispute we with lofty looks and bended brows. I
cannot in this place refrain to exclaim in this sort with Lucilius, O
hateful follies. They are ridiculous. But why manage we not rather some
matters that may make us better! Why search we not out the means to attain
unto virtue, and the way that may lead us thereunto? Break not my brains in
teaching me whether Magnanimity be a living creature, but learn me that in
this world there is not any living creature found that is happy, except he
be magnanimous, except he be resolute against all accidents, if in his thought
he has not overcome all adversities before he felt them. Magnanimity is the
impregnable fortress of humane infirmity, whosoever is enclosed therein, he
remains assured in this beleagring of life. For he uses his own strength
and his own weapons. In this place I will set down unto thee the notable
saying of the Stoic POSIDONIVS, Never think thy self assured with the arms
of Fortune, combat against her with thine own. Casualties do not arm us.
They therefore that are armed against their enemies, are disarmed against
adversity. Alexander spoiled and put to flight the Persians, the Hircanians,
the Indians, and all those Nations that inhabit the extent of the East
Countries unto the sea. Notwithstanding he himself having slain one friend
and lost another, lay groueling in a dark chamber detesting his wickedness,
deploring his loss, and this conqueror of so many Kings and Nations, was
overcome by choler and sorrow. For all his endeavors were aimed to this end, to
master all other things except himself. O how blind are men, who desire to
make their Scepters pass beyond the seas, who think themselves happy if they
conquer diverse countries and Provinces by their soldiers, and join new to the
old, not knowing that the greatest Empire, and that which is wholly conquered,
is to command a man's self. Let them teach me how sacred a thing Ius^ice is,
that it is a virtue that is careful of another man's good; that seeks not
commodities or advantages to her self. That she has no alliance with ambition
and vainglory, but pleases her self. Before all things let every one
persuade himself this. It behooves me to be a good man, without hope or desire
of recompense. This is a small matter, let him add more: I am commanded to
employ my self wholly and freely in the study of virtue, in such sort as all
my thought is as much as in me lies, to be driven from the consideration of my
private profit. Study thou not whether the reward of virtue, is more great
then virtue it self. Fix thou that likewise in thy mind, which I have touched
heretofore, it skilleth not whether thy virtue be known to few men, or to
many. He that will have his virtue published, labors not for virtue, but for
glory. Will thou not be just without glory? But undoubtedly thou must be just
with infamy, and then, if thou art wise, an evil opinion well gotten does
delight.

EPIST. CXIIII.
He teaches that eloquence is otherwise different, and pleasing, even as
public manners are severe, dissolute and broken. He proves that they take
that color from the mind, and that by MAECENAS example, and therefore that
that is to be cured and formed, from whence proceeds sense, and consequently
direct words. By the way he argues against dissolutenesse^.

THou ask me why and whence it comes to pass, that the speech is
corrupted in some times, and why men's minds are inclined to certain vices, so
as sometimes a swelling discourse was applauded, some other times sounding and
delivered after the manner of a song. Why other whiles men took pleasure in
long and continued periods, other whiles in abrupt sentences and suspicious, in
which more is to be understood then heard. Why then was some age that
immodestly used a figurative discourse. The reason is this which thou have
commonly heard, and the Greeks have made their proverb, of such is men's speech
as is their life. But as every man's actio^ is answerable to his speech, so
sometimes the kind of discourse imitateth public manners. If the discipline of
the Commonwealth has been depraved, the effeminate manner of language is an
argument of the dissolution of all estates: I speak of that language which is
usual amongst all men, and not of that, which some one or two use. The soul
and understanding cannot be of two colors. If the soul be whole, composed,
grave, and well tempered, the understanding also is sober and moderate. If the
one be corrupted, the other is affected. See thou not, that if the mind
languish, the members are weakened, and the feet hardly moved? And if it be
effeminate, how the infirmity thereof appears even in the walking? How if it
be watchful and forward, the body doubleth his pace, and if it be furious, or
(that which is next to fury) be angry, how all the body trembles, and how
they go not, but are transported? How much more befalls the understanding
think thou, which is wholly intermixed with the soul, which forms the
same, brings it in action, and gives it a law? In what sort Maecenas lived,
it is better known, then that it needed to be expressed at this time, how he
walked, how dainti^ he was, how desirous to be seen, how unwilling that his
vices should be undiscovered. What then, was not his discourse as dissolute as
his life? Had he not as much affectation and vanity in his speech, as in his
equipage, then in his train, then in his house, then in his wife? He was a man
of great understanding, ^ad ^e not tracted a worser way, had he not affected
obscurity, had he not ouerflowed in his discourse. Thou shall therefore see
the eloquence of a drunken man enfolded, extrauagant and full of liberty.
Behold Maecenas in his manner of speech. Quid turpius amne siluisque ripa
comantibus? Vide vt alueum lintribus arent, versoque vad^ remittant hortos.
Quid si quis faeminae cirro crispatae and labris columbatur? Incipitque
suspirans vt ceruice laxa feriatur. Nemo tira^ni irremediabilis factio
rimantur, epulis lagaenaeque tentant domos and saepe mortem exigunt. Genium
festo vix suo testem tenuis ^erei fila and crepacem molam^ Iocum matter and vxor
inuestiunt. Will thou not suddenly remember, as soon as thou read this,
that this is the sp^ech of such a man, who always trauersed Rome streets in
his loose-gowne. For even then when in Caesar's absence he executed his office,
he delivered the watchword in this habit. Think that it is the same man,
that in the Palace, in the Tribunal during the time of Orations, in all
assemblies of these people always presented himself, having his face muffeled
in his cloak, without discovering any thing but his ears, as they are
accustomed to do, who fly and will not be known, according as they are
represented in Comedies. He it is that in the greatest height of civil
wars, at such time as Rome was in arms and in fear, marched through the
streets, attended by two Eunuchs, yet more men then himself. He it is that
has had but one wife, and notwithstanding has been married a thousand times.
These words above written so badly builded, so negligently disposed, so
repugnant to the manner of all men's writings, show that his manners were no
less new, then particular and depraved. He has been highly prised for the
sweetness of his nature, in that he never bare arms, or ever took pleasure
in shedding blood, or did any thing, except that which the liberty of the time
or his credit might permit him. But all this good reputation of his has been
soyled by the affectations of this his monstrous manner of language: for in
this it manifestly appears that he was rather a milke-soppe then merciful.
These obscurities in ^is composition, these ouerth wart words, these conceits
oftentimes: lofty, but without pith, discover unto him that will observe the
same, that too much felicity had troubled his head, a vice which is sometimes
found in the man, sometimes in the time. When as repose and felicity produces
and sows dissolution on every side. First of all, a man begins more
carefully to dress and adorn his body. Afterward his study is to have rich
moueables, consequently he bethinketh himself of stately buildings, to make
them more large, to enrich the walls with Marbles fetched from beyond seas, to
embolish the roofes with gold, that the beauty of the pauement be answerable
to the richness of many beams. Then transferreth he his daintiness to the
magnificence of his table, and there searches he glory in novelty, and
changing the accustomed fashions amongst our predecessors, so that those things
which were wont to be served in last at supper, are brought in first, and
those things that were presented to those that entered to the feast, are given
to those that depart from it. After that man's mind was accustomed to loath
that which was in use, and things that are ordinary were accounted
contemptible: he goes and seeks out a new language, reviving and renewing
unusual and forgotten words, then forgeth he new, and regrateth the unknown:
that which is but newly found out is reputed elegant, and figurative
translations are audacious and frequent. Some think to credit themselves by
speaking to the halfes, and abbreuiating their speech in such sort, as he that
hears knows not what to think. Other there are that delate and draw them
out, some there are that draw not unto the vice (for he must needs, that
undertakes any great thing to do the same) yet such as love the same.
Wheresoever therefore thou see that men take delight in an obscure and
corrupt speech, hold thy self assured that their manners are depraved. Even as
excessive banquets and superfluous rayments are witnesses that the Commonweal
is sick, so this liberty in coining new terms and words (if so be the
custom be continued) shows that the spirits of those that speak thus, are
entangled and lost. Wonder thou not in any sort, that this corruption is as
pleasing to the mightiest, as to the meaner sort, for the greatest and the
poorest differ not in judgments, but in their pomp and estate. Rather wonder
thou that men praise the effects of vices, and the vices themselves. For this
has been always done: there was no pleasing wit that had not his pardon.
Give me whatsoever man thou will of greatest name, and I will tell thee wherein
the age wherein he lived pardoned him, and what they willingly dissembled in
him. I will reckon thee up many, whose vices harmed them not, and some, whose
errors profited them. I will, I say, let thee see some of great renown, and
reputed most excellent men, whom if a man will censure, he confounds them.
For so are their virtues intermixed with their vices, that the one do
necessarily draw the other after them. Add hereunto that language has no
certain rule. The public custom which changes it incessantly, alters it
from year to year. Some men borrow words from another age. They use the style
of the Laws written in the twelve tables. Gracchus, Crassus, and Curio are
over new for them, they return as far as Appius and Coruncanus. Some other
contrariwise, that will have nothing which is not vulgar and triuiall, speak
very barelie. Both of them are corrupted in a diverse manner so much certainly,
as if they would use pompous wel-sounding and poetical words, and fly those
that are necessary and in use: I will say that as well the one as the other
does amiss. The one esteems themselves more then is necessary, the other
mispriseth themselves over much; the one pull the hair from their legs, the
other not from their arm pits. Let us pass over to composition, how many
defaults may I discover to thee? The one allow of a crabbed and harsh
discourse, they disturb a smooth and pleasing style: no period is pleasing to
them, if it be not harsh and rough: they repute that manly and strong which
affects the ^are with inequality. The other in stead of speaking, seem to
sing, so fl^ttering and so fluent is the structure of their words. What will
you say of that where the words are deferred, and after we have attended them
long time^ hardly return they unto their clauses? What shall I say of that
which in the issue is moderate (as is that of Ciceroes and falling and ending
afterward sweetly, and answerable to the fashion; and has his ending
answerable to the manner and foot. There is not only an error in the kind of
sentences, if either they are too weak and childish, and more proud and bold
then modesty will permit, but they are too flourishing and sweet, if they be
delivered in vain and without any effect, they do no more but sound. These
vices some one man brings in, whose eloquence in that time is applauded, the
rest do imitate him, and the one delivers it to the other. So when Salust
was in request, the sentences were curt^lled, and words had their unexpected
cadence, and obscure brevity with the rest was reputed elegancie, Aruncius a
man of rare frugalitie, who wrote the History of the Carthaginian wars, was
a Salus^ian, and an excellent man in that kind. There is an SALVST, Exercitum
argento fe^it: that is to say, he made an army with silver; that is, he
assembled an army with money. This did Aruncius, he planted it in every page:
he says in a certain place, Fugam nostri fecere, that is to say, our men made
a flight: and in another place Hiero King of Syracusa, Bellum facit, makes
war: and likewise in another place, Quae a^dita Panormitanos dedere Romany
fecere, that is to say, which things being heard, they made that the
Inhabitants of Panormus rendered themselves to the Romanes^ I thought good to
give thee a little taste. All this whole book is composed of words. Those
words that were rare in Salust are usual in him, and almost continued: and
not without cause; for the one lighted on them by chance, the other sought for
them. But thou see what follows him that takes an error for an example:
Salust said, Aquis hiemantibus, whilst the waters wintered. Ar^ncius in his
first book of the Carthaginian war, says, Repent hiemauit tempestas, that
is to say, the tempest suddenly wintered. And in another place, when he would
say that the year was cold, he says, Totus hiemauit annus, that is^ the
whole year wintered. And in another place, Inde sexaginta onerarias leaves
pr^ter militem, and necessarios nautarum hiemante aquilone misit, that is,
whilst the Aquilon wintered, he sent from that place sixty ships of small
burden, besides the Soldiers and necessary Mariners. He never gives over
in all places to foist in this word. In a certain place Salust says, Inter
arma ciuilia aequiboni famas petit, that is, amidst civil arms he sought the
renown of a man good and just. Aruntius tempered not himself, but presently
in his first book he inserted this, Ingentes esse famas de RE^VLO, that is,
that the renownes of Regulus were great. This therefore and such like vices,
which imitation has impressed into any tokens of dissolution, or a corrupt
mind. For they must be proper and conceived by the understanding, by which
thou ought to estimate any man's effects. The speech of a choleric man is
hasty, and violent of a man that is moved to much stirring, of a delicate and
civil man smooth and pleasant, which thou see those men follow that either
pull and trim their beards, that cause their mustachios to be cut short, that
shave their upper lips very near, and suffer the rest to be as long as is
possible, that wear their cloakes of an evil color, and gowns of pure
stuff, who will do nothing but that which is seen publicly, although they
offend and displease the whole world. But they care not to be reproved,
provided, that they be beheld. Such is Mecaenas discourse and all others else,
which err not casually but willingly. This error proc^edeth from an evil
conscience. Even as in drunkenness the tongue faltereth not, except reason be
obscured or betrayed: so this manner of speech (which is a mere drunkenesse of
the spirit) is tedious to no man, except the understanding of him that speaks
be shaken. Therefore we ought to heal the same, for from it the discourse, the
words, the countenance, the regard, the marching is derived; if it be whole and
strong. The language is robust, strong and manly: contrariwise, if it be
dejected all the rest grow to wrack, The King in health then all men's minds
are one,
The King once lost then all men's faith is gon^.
Our mind is our King if it be safe, the rest continue in their duty, they
obey and are governed, if he be never so little shaken, they droope with him.
But when he gives place to pleasure, his Arts and his actions also do decay,
and all his forces are feeble and frail. Because I have used this similitude I
will persevere. Our mind is now a King, now a Tyrant: a King when he beholds
and aims at honesty, maintains the health of the body committed to his
charge, and commands no filthy or sordid thing: but when he is choleric,
covetous and delicate, he assumeth a detes^able and direful name, and is
called Tyrant. Then do impotent affections lay hold of him, and solicit him
incessantly, and in the beginning of those that most press him seem to yield
him pleasure; such as the people is accustomed to rejoice at when a tyrant
makes them any larges to entrap them: but this abundance is vain unto the
understanding, which manageth that which he cannot dis-jest, when the
sickness has consumed his vigor more and more, and delights have stolen into
his nerves and marrow, the understanding being joyful to behold these things
(the use whereof is unprofitable to him, because he has ouer-earnestly desired
them) for the satisfaction of his delights, he enjoys the sight of this or
that, he is witness and under servant of other men's lusts, being deprived of
all delights of the same, because he is ouer-plunged therein: in brief, the
abundance of worldly pleasures in stead of conceiting him consumes him, when
he sees himself deprived of the means to let down by his throat into his
belly all the pleasant morsels he beholds, and to tumble himself basely
amidst the troop of ba^des and harlots, he wonderfully grieueth because he is
fallen from the greatest part of his felicity, having so straight receipt in a
body so little. Is not this a true fury, my Lucilius, that none of us
thinks that he is mortal? That we are insensible every way of our infirmity?
yea, that each one supposes himself to be more then one. Behold our Kitchins,
and our Cooks traversing from one fire to another; would thou think that
for the refection of one only belly so much stir should be made? Behold our
Caves and Cellers replenished with the vintages of many ages; think thou
that it is for one belly that the wines of so many Consuls and Countries are
stored up? Behold in how many places the earth is turned up, how many thousands
of husbandmen plough and dig the same; think thou that it may seem to be
for one belly that Sicily and Africa are sowed? We shall be healthful and
desire little, if every one of us numbreth himself, and measure his body
likewise, and know that it neither can receive much, nor contain it long; yet
is there nothing that will teach thee better to keep a measure in all things,
then an ordinary meditation of the shortness and uncertainty of this life,
whenever thou do look back unto death.

EPIST. CXV.
He argues against those that are too curious in their discourse and style,
and says it is a token of a weak mind; alleging that we ought to speak and
write confidently without affectation of ornament, and rather express in our
mind. O what a one is he when virtues have adorned him? He will draw all men
into admiration of him, if he might be seen. But this external beauty is
either false or nothing worth: as likewise gold and money are, which we so
much admire. These make not men happy or secure, nay, rather miserable and to
be pitied.

I Will not have thee too curious, either in thy words or composition, my
Lucilius, I have greater matters for thee to care for, and think upon. Seek
what thou should write, and not how; and in stead of busying thy self about
words, cause thy self to have a feeling of the substance thereof in thy
heart, to the end thou may apply the same more and more, and as it were
seal it in thy self. Whomsoever thou see that uses an affected and
labored kind of speech, think that he has his spirit occupied about vain
things. A virtuous man speaks more remissely, but more securely: whatsoever
he says, has more confidence in it then curiosity. Thou know diverse young
men well barbed and frizeled, who seem as if they newly came out of a box;
expect thou nothing either firm or generous from such kind of men. The speech
is the Image of the mind: if a man mince it, disguise and polish it over
curiously, it is a sign that he which speaks it, is an hypocrite, and little
worth. It is no manly ornament to speak affectedly. If it were lawful for us
to pry into the soul of a good man, O the fair, O the holy, O the
magnificent, gracious, and shining face which we should behold! their justice,
their fortitude, their temperance, their prudence give luster on every side.
Furthermore, frugalitie, continence, patience, liberty and courtesy, and that
rare, and as it were incredible ornament in a man, that is to say humanity,
would reflect their light upon them. Furthermore, how much grace, gravity,
authority, discretion and magnanimity (which is the highest of all other
virtues) would annex themselves unto the rest. No man would count him amiable
that would not term him venerable, if any one had seen this face more
heavenly and resplendent then mortal eyes are accustomed to behold, would he
not step back, being stricken with astonishment, as if he had met with some
God? Would he not pray in his heart that he might contemplate the same? Then
approaching more near, allured by the sweetness of his eyes, would he not
humbly kneel down before her. And having advisedly considered it, how far
more excellent it were and incomparable above ours, with a gracious regard, yet
sparkling and filled with living light, wholly ravished with zeal and amase,
would he not cry out with Virgil, O by what style fair Virgin shall I strive
To set thee forth? for thine vnequal'd eyes
Are mere then mortal, and thy words revive
Far more then humane eloquence implies,
Live happy, and vouchsafe us of thy grace,
And end those toils which have our life in chase.
She will assist and comfort us, if we will honor her, but she is not
honored or served by the offerings of fat slaughtered and sacrificed Bulls,
nor by gold, or silver hung up in the Temple, or by presents cast into her
treasure; but by a right and holy affection. There is not any man, as I have
said, that would not be inflamed with her love, if we could attain to see her.
For now there are many things that hinder and dim our eyes, and dull them by
their brightness, or detain them in obscurity. But even as certain
medicines do cleanse and sharpen the sight; so likewise if we will take away
those impediments that darken the eyes of our souls, we may behold virtue,
although covered with a body, although poverty, base condition, and infamy be
as many couerts to conceal her from us; although this beauty be clouded by an
obscure thing, yet shall we epsy it. Contrariwise, we shall discover from a
far the malice and stupiditie of a miserable soul, although that riches do
abundantly shine and muster about her, and that in regarding her we have our
eyes dazeled with the false light of power and honors, Then may we learn
that which we admire is contemptible in all sorts, and that we resemble little
children, that think every trifle of great value; for they prefer their
little bracelets, scarce worth a penny, before their fathers, mothers, or
brothers. What difference then is there betwixt us and them, says Ariston, but
that we are madding after pictures and statues more costly foolish? They are
delighted with little party colored stones, that have some variety in them,
which are found upon the Sea shore, and we with pillars of Iaspe and Porphirie,
brought from the sands of Egypt, or the deserts of Africa, to sustain some
porch or some dyning chamber to feast the Commons in. We wonder at the walls
that are covered with thin marble, and yet we know what that is which is
hidden, and we cosen our own eyes. And when we guild all the roofs of our
houses, what other thing rejoice we in but in counterfeit? For we know that
worme-eaten wood lies hidden under that gold: neither is it only on our
walls and house-beames that we bestow this light ornament, but remember thy
self also that the felicity of all these great men whom thou see march so
proudly, is but a felicity gilded on the outside, and a simple leaf.
Observe and thou shall see, that under this thin skin of humane greatness,
there is abundance of misery and filthiness. Those riches which at this day
raise men to greatest magistracy and place of justice, have bewitched the
hearts and senses of the same men; and since money has grown in request, the
true honor of things is made no reckoning of: and being become buyers and
sellers both at once, we ask no more what this is, but of what worth this is?
In this traffic we are sometimes good, and sometimes evil. As long as there
is any hope of profit about virtue we follow her: if vice promise us better
advantage we run after it, and are for those will give us most. Our fathers
and mothers have made us admire gold and silver; this covetousness being
sowed in our tender souls, has taken deep root, and is grown with us.
Again, all men that in all other things are of different opinions, accord in
this point of avarice, every one embraces the same, desires that his may have
a part, and pretending to show himself grateful to the gods, he presents
them with silver and gold, as the most excellent thing in the world. Finally,
man's life is brought to that pass, that poverty is held for a hateful thing,
and full of contempt, neglected by the rich, hateful to the poor. Then have
the Poets annexed their inventions, which are as it were matches to kindle our
affections in praising riches as the only honor and ornament of this life,
and that the immortal gods seem to have nothing better, neither can give any
thing more exquisite. One of them speaking of the Palace of the Sun, says
The Palace of the Sun, most seemly to behold,
Was raised on pillars of the purest gold.
Behold how he describes his Chariot. The axeltree, the beam, the outward
bends,
That arm the wheel, were all of burnisht gold,
The spoakes of silver. --
To conclude, they call that the golden age, which they would have reputed for
the best. Amongst the Tragique Poets, there are some that prefer profit
before innocence, health, and good opinion. Let me have wealth and riches to be
giving,
Account thou me the wretchedst miser living;
All men enquire, if he be rich or no,
But no man learnes what goodness he does owe.
They ask not why, or whence, but what thou have,
And only that, so each man is reputed
As he is landed, monied, and suited.
Ask'st thou me what is loathsome to possess,
Nothing; for getting does disgrace redress.
I either wish to live in rich estate,
Or die in poverty, contempt, and hate:
Full well dies he, that dying gets gain,
Money the greatest good of humane strain:
The mothers comfort, and the infants pleasure,
The sacred parents are but toys to pleasures,
In VENUS face nothing so sweetly shines
As money does, nothing her power confines;
The gods themselves are by her presents moved,
And mortal men her sight have ever loved.
When these last verses of Euripides Tragedy were pronounced, all the people
arose with great tumult, to fling out both the Actor and the Author, till
Euripides himself stepped forth into the midst of them, beseeching them to
have patience, and they should see what end he had that so much admired gold.
In this Tragedy Beler^phon received the chastisement, which every one
receives in himself. For no avarice is without punishment, although she her
self be punishment enough of her self. O how many tears and toils exacteth
she at their hands that serve her, how miserable she is both to those that
gape after her, and to those that have got her. Add hereunto the continual
cares which torment every man, according to the measure of that he has: money
is possessed with greater torment then sought. What bitter sighs are vented from
the hearts of covetous men, if they have any losses, which sometimes are great,
and seem also to be greater. Finally, although Fortune take nothing from them
yet all that which escapes their fingers, is as much as lost unto them. But
men say such a one is happy and rich, and desire to have as much goods as he.
I confess it. What then? Think thou that any are in worse case then those
which have both misery and envy. I could wish that they who desire riches,
should consult and take counsel of rich men. I could wish that they who affect
honors, should confer with ambitious men, and such as have gotten the height of
dignity, they should undoubtedly change their vows, which they do also
making new wishes, and consequently condemning their former wishes. For there
is no one man that contenteth himself with his felicity, although she posted
forward to find him. They complain themselves of their designs and success,
and had rather have that which they left behind. But Philosophy will give
thee content, which is the most great good thou can imagine, thou shall never
repent thy self. To this so solid felicity which no tempest may shake, apt
and chosen words, neither a sweet and flowing style will bring thee. Let words
pass as they may, provided that thy soul be in his entire, that it be great,
and delivered from errors, pleasing unto it self, by reason of those things
that are displeasing unto others. Who estimateth his advancement by his action,
and judges that he knows so much, as he neither desires nor fears.

EPIST. CXVI.
Against the Peripatetickes, that affections are to be cut off, not tempered,
neither that they are induced by Nature. That the adverse opinion proceeds
from effeminatenesse.

IT has oftentimes been demanded^ whether it be better to have moderate
affections, or none at all. The Stoics expel them which are tempered and
moderated by Peripateticks. For mine own part I see now how a sickness may be
moderate, healthful or profitable. Fear thou not, for I will have none of
those things taken from thee, which thou will not have denied thy self. I will
make my self facile and indulgent to those things which thou pretendest, and
that either thou esteemest necessary, profitable, or pleasing to thy self. I
will only take from thee the vice. For when I forbid thee to desire, I permit
thee to will, to the end that resolutely and advisedly thou may do what
thou please, and that thou may taste the sweetness thereof the more. Why
not? For they will come the more unto thee, if thou command them, then if thou
serve them. But thou will say that it is natural for a man to lament the death
of his friend, that we ought to give time to a sorrow so just. That it is
natural to be touched with the opinions of men, and to be sorry in
adversities, that it is not reasonable to extinguish the honest apprehension of
a danger. I answer, that there is no vice which finds not an advocate, and
whose beginning is not fitting and excusable^ but that it is which gives him
the means to extend it self every ways. If thou suffer it to begin, thou
shall never be able to make it end. In the beginning each affection is feeble,
but afterward he inciteth himself, and gets forces in his progress, he is
more easily excluded then expelled. Who denies, but that affections flow, as
it were, from a certain natural beginning. Nature has committed the care of
our selves to our selves, but when thou art too indulgent thereof, it is a
vice, Nature has intermixed pleasure with necessary things, not that we
should affect the same^ but that the access thereof, should make those things
more pleasing to us, without which we cannot live, if of it self it come not,
it is dissoluteness. Let us therefore make head against affections which
enter: because, as I said, they are not entertained so easily as they depart.
Permit me in such a measure to be sorrowful, in such a measure to fear: but
that measure becomes without mean, and ends not there where thou will. It
is safety for a wiseman not to keep himself over careful, and let him when
he lists arrest his tears and his pleasures. And because it is not easy for
us to retire, it is the better that we set not forward at all. Me thinks that
Panaetius answered very fitly to a young man that asked him, Whether a wiseman
might love. As touching the wiseman (says he) we will think upon it, but in
regard of thy self and me, we are yet far distant from the perfection of a
wiseman. Let us keep our selves carefully, lest we become slaves of a thing
turbulent, impotent, under the power of another, contemptible to it self. For
if she eye us, his humanity incited us, and if she despise, we burn in
despite. The love that is gracious is as hurtful as that which is rigorous: by
his facility we are entangled, and with the rigor we strive. Since then we know
our own weakness, let us be quiet; neither let us trust our infirm minds to
wine, to beauty, or flattery, nor to any other attraction and flattering
things. That which Panaetius answered of love to this young man, that say I of
all other affections. Let us reclaim our selves, as much as in us lies, from
slipperie places, and let us securely stand assured in the dry. Thou will
propose unto me in this place, that reproach which all the world urges against
the Stoics: you promise over great matters, you command that which is as it
were impossible. We are poor and infirm men, who cannot in this sort cut off
all things, we will weep but a little. We will covet but temperately, if we
enter into choler, it shall be pacified. Will thou know why we cannot command
our affections? It is in this respect, because we believe that it is impossible
for us. Yea, but undoubtedly there is another matter in it, we defend our vices
because we love them, and we had rather excuse them, then discuss them. Nature
has given us force enough, if we will make use thereof, if we will gather our
forces, and employ them wholly for our selves, and not against our selves. We
pretend that we cannot, but the cause is that we will not.

EPIST. CXVII.
A question, whether since wisdom is good, it be good to be wise. The Stoics
commonly deny the same: some affirm; and he is more inclined to their opinion.
In conclusion, he impugneth these unnecessary matters^ and seriously exhorts
us to reform our manners.

Thou will trouble me much, and thy self likewise, and ere thou art aware
thrust me into great strife and trouble, who proposest me such short
questions, in which, without offense, I dare not differ from the Stoics,
neither can I consent with a safe conscience. Thou inquire of me whether it
be true which the Stoickes maintain, that wisdom is good, but to be wise is
not. First of all will I expound what the Stoics think, then dare I boldly
discover my opinion. It is the opinion of our sect, that that which is good is
a body, because that which is good acts. But each thing that has action is
a body. That which is good profits, but he must do somewhat, to the end he
may profit, and if it does, it is a body. They say that wisdom is good, it
follows then of necessity that it is corporal. But they think that to be
wise is not of the same condition. It is a thing incorporall and accidental
unto wisdom, and therefore it cannot produce any action, neither profit any
ways. But say we not it is good to be wise? We say so in relation to that
whereon it depends, that is to say, to wisdom it self. Before I begin to
retire my self, and to unite my self with the contrary parties, hear that
which some Stoics answer unto the rest. After this manner say they it is no
good thing to live happily: will they, nill they, they must answer that a
blessed life is good, and that to live blessedly is a good thing. Moreover, it
is opposed against those of our sect, Will you be wise? Therefore it is a thing
to be desired to be wise: if it be a thing to be desired it is good. The
Stoics are constrained to wrest words, and to require the interposition of
one syllable, which our speech permits not to be inserted, I will if thou will suffer me annex the same: That, say they, is to be desired which is good
to be desired, which is contingent unto good, which good when we have attained
it, is not required as good, but is an accession to the good that is required.
I am not of this opinion, and I judge that the S^oickes agree with me herein,
because the first point bridleth them, and they cannot lawfully change the
manner of speech: we are wont to attribute much to the common and universal
opinion of men. Amongst us it is a testimony of truth, if it be alleged that
all men believe that which is in question. As for proof that there are gods,
we allege that the belief that there are gods is ingraffed and planted in
all men's minds; neither is there any Nation how brutish soever, that believes
not that there are gods? When we dispute of the eternity of souls, the concent
of men either fearing hell, or reuerencing the same, has no small moment and
authority. I use this public persuasion, thou shall ^inde no man who thinks
not that both wisdom and to be wise is good. I will not do as they are
accustomed that are overcome, who seeing themselves in danger to lose their
lives, appeal unto the people, we will begin to fight with our own weapons,
whether is that which happens unto any man without or within him to whom it
happens? If it be in him to whom it happens, it is as well a body as that
to which it happens: for nothing can happen without touch, and that which
touches is a body. If it be without after it has happened it departs: that
which retireth his self has motion, and whatsoever has motion is a body.
Thou hopest that I will say, that the course is not one thing, and running
another; neither heat one thing, and to be hot another; neither light one
thing, and to shine another. I grant that there is a diversity in these
things, but I say that the one are not of a different condition from the other.
If health be a thing indifferent, to be in health is a thing indifferent:
likewise, if beauty be indifferent, to be beautiful is indifferent: if
justice be good, to be just is good: if villainy be evil, to be a villain is
evil. As much assuredly as if lippitude be evil, to have purblinde eyes is
evil. That thou may know this, can the one be without the other? To be wise
is wisdom, and it is wisdom to be wise. So far is it from breeding doubt,
that the one resembles the other, that some men suppose that they are one and
the same thing. But I would willingly ask this question; Since all things are
either good, or evil, or indifferent, in what rank To be wise, shall be
placed? They deny that it is good, and evil it is not; it follows then that
it is indifferent: but that repute we to be mean and indifferent that may as
well befall an evil as a good man, as money, beauty, and ability. But to be
wise cannot befall any but a wiseman, and therefore it is not indifferent. An
evil it is not that cannot betide an evil man, and therefore it is good^ it
is, says he, the accident of wisdom. This therefore which thou termest To be
wise, whether makes it wisdom or suffers it? Whether it does make it or
suffer it, in both kinds it is a body; for both that which is made and that
which makes is a body: if it be a body it is good. For this one thing was
deficient in it, and detained it from being good, which was, because it had no
body. The Peripatetiques hold that there is no difference betwixt wisdom and
to be wise, when as the one is comprehended in the other. For think thou
that any man is wise except he that has wisdom? And think thou that
wisdom accompanies him that is wise? The ancient Logicians distinguished
these things, and from them this division came unto the Stoickes. What this is
I will tell thee: The field is one thing, and to have possession of the same
another. Why not, when as to have the possession of the field appertains to
him that has the field, and not unto the field? So wisdom is one thing, and
to be wise another. I think thou will grant me this, that these are two; that
which is had, and he that has the same: wisdom is had, he that is wise has
it. Wisdom is a perfect mind, or that which attaineth the fullness of
perfection; for she is the act of life. What is to be wise? I cannot say a
perfect mind, but that which befalls him that has a perfect mind. So the
one is a good mind, the other as it were to have a good mind. There are,
says he, diverse natures of the body: as for example; this is a man, that a
horse: these natures likewise are followed by the motions of the mind, which
make show of the body. These motions have something proper and considered apart
from the bodies, as I see Cato walking; this does the sense show, the mind
believe. It is a body that I see, on which I have fixed both mine eye and my
mind. I say afterward Cato walks, I speak not now of his body, but of
something denounced of the body, that is to say, of his motion, which some call
pronounced, some signified, other some denounced. So when we say wisdom we
understand some thing that is bodilesse: when we say he is wise, we speak of
the body. But there is a great difference whether thou speak this or of
that: for the present, let us put the case that wisdom and to be wise are two
things; for as yet I publish not my opinion, what hinders both the one and
the other to be good? Thou said a little before that the field was one thing,
and to possess the field was another. Why not? for he that possesses the same
is in one nature, and that which is possessed is another, the one is a man, the
other is a field. But in this whereof we now make question, wisdom and to be
wise are things of the same nature. Furthermore, the field that is possessed is
one thing, and the man that possesses the same another; but wisdom and to be
wise are found in one and the same man. The possession of the field comes by
right, that of wisdom comes by nature. A man may alien the field, and give it
unto another man, wisdom never departs from him that possesses the same:
we must not therefore compare things that are unlike. I began to say that both
these may be two, and yet both of them good. Wisdom and a wiseman are two,
and by thy confession both of them are good. But even as nothing hinders but
that wisdom is a good thing, and he he that has wisdom is good, so nothing
hinders but that wisdom is good, and to have wisdom, this is to be wise
and good. I will be a wiseman to this end that I may be wise. What therefore?
Is not that good without the which the other is not good? Undoubtedly, you say
that wisdom if it be without use is to be esteemed as nothing. And what is the
use of wisdom? To be wise. This is that which is most precious in her, which
being taken from her she is but mere illusion: if torments be evil, it is
evil to be tortured, yea in such sort that if a man were never tormented, he
should never consequently have any torments. Wisdom is a habitude of a
perfect understanding; to be wise the use of a perfect mind: how can the use
thereof be good, which without use is not good? I ask thee whether wisdom is
to be desired? Thou confessest it. I ask thee whether the use of wisdom is to
be desired? Thou confessest it, protesting likewise not to receive the same if
a man will bar thee of the use thereof: that which is to be desired is good,
to be wise is the use of wisdom, as the use of eloquence is to speak, the use
of the eye to see; but the use of wisdom is to be desired, Ergo, to be wise is
a thing to be desired, and if it be to be desired it is good. I condemn my
self for times past, for following those whom I accuse, and for implying
arguments in a thing that is manifest. For who can doubt but that extreme heat
is evil, and to be extremely hot is evil; and that if cold be evil it is
an evil thing to be cold? If life be good, that to live is good? All these
things that are about wisdom are not in the same, but we are to stay our
selves upon her, and if we will discourse she has ample and spacious retreats
to converse in. Let us enquire of the nature of the gods, of the nourishments
and diverse motion of the Planets, whether our bodies be desposed according to
their reuolutions, or whether their influences have a hand in all men's bodies
and minds: whether those things which are called casual are tied together in
a certain order, and if nothing be done in this world without some special
providence. But these things have no relation to the present reformation of
manners, yet mount they the mind, and raise the same to the greatness of
those things they entreat of. But those disputes whereof I spoke a little
before, do diminish and depresse the same, neither as thou think do they
whet but dull the same. But why, I beseech you, employ we so necessary a care
reserved for greater and better things, in a thing if not merely false, yet
truly unprofitable? What shall it profit me whether wisdom be one thing,
and to be wise be another? What shall it avail me to know whether this be
good, or that be badde? At all adventures see what I desire; I wish thee
wisdom, and my self that I may be wise, so shall we be both equal. Rather
do this that thou may show me the way how I may attain unto these. Tell
me what I must eschew, and what I should desire, by what studies I may
confirm my infirm mind; how I may drive far from me those vices that
carry and transport me from the right; how I may surmount so many evils; how
I may remove th^se calamities that have broken in upon me, and how I may
thwart those, in which I have engaged my self. Teach me how I may endure
afflictions without grieuing, felicity without other men's envy or distaste,
how I may not expect the last and necessary term of life, but of my self
when I shall so think good, speedily seek it out and fly unto it. Nothing in
my judgment is more absurd and dishonest then to wish for death. For if thou will live, why wishest thou to die? If thou will not, to what intent
importunest thou the gods for that which they gave thee when thou were borne?
For even as it is decreed that thou must die one day whether thou will or no,
so when thou will is in thine own power: the one is of necessity, the other
of will. Some few days past I have read a shameful Preface of a certain man,
otherwise learned and eloquent, where these words are: So I may die (says
he) incontinently. O fond man, thou desire that which is thine own; So may
I die incon^inently. It may be that in speaking these words thou art become
old. Otherwise what stays thee? No man holds thee, escape when thou will,
choose such a part of the instruments of nature, as seems good unto thee, and
command the same to give thee issue: for these are the elements whereby this
inferior world is maintained, water, earth and air; all these are both the
causes of life, and the highways to death. So may I die incontinently: but
when will thou die? What day will thou assign to thine incontinent? It may
come sooner then thou wishest. These are the words of a weak mind, and of
such a one who by this protestation would obtain mercy and lengthning of his
life: he will not die that wishes for death. Beseech the gods to give thee
life and health: if thou have a mind to die, this is the fruit of death, to
give over wishing. Let us speak of these things my Lucilius, and by them form
our understandings wisdom, and to be wi^e consists in this, not to debate
in impertinent questions of unprofitable disputes. So many questions has
fortune proposed unto thee, yet have thou not satisfied her in them: now thou
cauillest. How fond a thing is it to stand flourishing thy sword in the air,
when the signal is given thee to begin the skirmish? Give over these arms of
disport, thou art to fight at sharp. ^ell me by what means no sadness or fear
may trouble the mind? by what means I may disburden my self of this
troublesome weight of secret desires? Let somewhat be don. Wisdom is good, to be
wise is not good: be it so. Let us deny that to be wise is a good thing, to
the end we may draw all that study into contempt, which is employed in
superfluous matters. What if thou knew likewise that this is in question,
whether future wisdom be good? For what doubt is there, I pray you, whether
the barnes do already feel the harvest that is at hand, neither childehood
understand his future youth, being destitute of force and vigor? The health
that is to com is nothing profitable to him that is sick, no more then rest
does which ought to follow the course and wrestling, comfort not a man as
long as he is running or wrestling. Who knows not that that which is to come
is not good for this only cause, because it is yet to come? For that which is
good profits and serves without delay. No things can be profitable but such
as are present: if a thing profit not, truly it is not good; if it profit it
is presently good. I shall be wise, this shall be good when I shall be so; but
in the mean while it is not. First must a thing be, and afterward it must be
such or such. But tell me, I pray thee, how may that which as yet is nothing,
be perfectly good? For how will thou have me better prove it unto thee that a
thing is not, then if I shall say it is to come: for it is manifest that it is
not yet come that is coming. The Spring must follow. I know now that it is
Winter, the Summer shall succeed: I know that it is not Sommer-time. The
greatest argument I have that a thing is not as yet present, is that it is to
come. I hope I shall be wise, yet in the mean space I am not wise. If I had
that good, I should presently want this evil. It may be hereafter that I
shall be wise, although by this thou understand that I am not yet wise, I
cannot at one time be in that good and this evil. These two things do not
agree but are disioynted; neither are at once in the same, good and evil. Let
us pass over speedily these ingenious trifles, and hasten our selves to
attain those things which may give us any help. There is no man that carefully
seeks for a midwife to come unto his daughter that is in labor, that
reads unto her the ordinance and disposition of the public Plays. There is
no man that hastily runs to quench the fire that has seized his house, has
not the leisure to study how to save his man, that in a game at Chests is
hemmed in on every side. But thou know that from all parts, there comes
news unto thee both of the burning of thy house and the death of thy children,
of the siege of thy City, of the pillage of thy goods. Add hereunto,
shipwracks, earthquakes, and all other dreadful accidents. Being in the midst
of so many troubles, have thou no other business but to give thy self to
pleasure? Thou inquirest what dif^erence there is betwixt wisdom and to be
wise. Thou knittest and loosest knots, having so great a mountain of miseries
hanging over thy head. Nature has not given us so favorable and liberal
benefit of time, that we should have leisure to lose any part thereof; consider
also how much they lose who are most diligent. The sickness of our selves and
of our friends carries away one part of us, and necessary and public
a^faires another. Sleep robs from us the half of our life. Of this time so
short, so swift, and that carries us away, to what purpose is it to consume
the greater part thereof in vain? Add hereunto now that the mind is
accustomed rather to delight then heal it self, and that Philosophy which
should be the remedy of evils, serves nothing but for pastime. I know not
what difference there is betwixt wisdom and being wise, yet know I well that
it profits me nothing, whether I know these things or know them not. Tell me
when I have learned the difference betwixt wisdom and being wise, if I shall
be wise? Why rather detainest thou me amongst the words then the works of
wisdom? Make me stronger, make me securer, make me equal with fortune, make
me superior: but I may be superior if I do all that which I learn.

EPIST. CXVIII.
That he will write no vain Epistles, but rather such as are full of
profitable lessons. He persuades to handle our private not foreign
businesses, to require nothing of fortune, neither to depend upon her. That the
true good is to be sought, and the definition what it is: and likewise what it
differs from honesty. That every good is according to nature, neither yet is
every thing good which is according to nature.

THou requirest me to write unto thee oftentimes, if we enter into account thou
can not sufficiently satisfy me. It was agreed between us that thou
should write first, and that I should answer thee, I will not be behind
hand with thee, I know that there is nothing lost that is lent thee. I will pay
thee therefore before thy day: neither will I do that which eloquent Cicero was
wont to counsel Atticus to do, that is, to write whatsoever came into his
mind, although he had no matter whereupon to write. I can never want matter to
write unto thee, although I omit all that discourse wherewith Cicero stuffeth
his Epistles, to wit, who it is that laboreth for offices, who fights with
his own or foreign forces, who labors for the Consulat, either under
Caesar's or Pompeis favor, or of himself. How hard a usurer Cicilius is, from
whom his neighbors cannot wrest a penny, but a hundredth upon a hundredth. It
were better for a man to speak of his own miseries then of another man's, to
examine himself, and to consider how many things a man labors for, and
obtains not one. This my Lucilius, is a worthy thing, this a secure and free
thing, to demand and purchase nothing, and to let fortune possess her
estates, without ^ribing after any of the^. How pleasant a thing is it,
think thou, when the people are assembl^d, when such as pretend offices give
court to their wel-wishers, and the one publicly protests the money he will
give, the other solliciteth by his sureties and private friends, when one man
wears and wastes another man's hands with kisses. Where had he attained what
he desires, he would loath they should touch his, when all men are astonished,
and expect the voice of the Crier, to stand idle and ^xpect those faires,
neither buying nor selling any thing? How great joy enjoys this man, who
beholds these assemblies, where choice is made of Pretors and Consuls, but
those great estates, where the one demands yearly honors, others
perpetual power: the one happy success in battles and triumphs, the other
riches: the one marriages and children, the other long and happy life for
themselves and their parents. O how great a mind is it to demand nothing, to
make supplication to no man, and that says unto Fortune, I have nothing to do
with thee, I am not at thy commandment. I know that with thee Catoes are
repelled, and Vatinians advanced. I demand nothing at thy hands. This is to
reduce Fortune into order. Fot this cause therefore ought we to entertain one
another, and to entreat continually on this subject in our letters, beholding
on every side of us so many thousands of men in trouble, who to cast themselves
headlong into some mortal ruin, trauerse one mischief to find out another,
and seek those things, which they incontinently fly as soon as they have
found them, or wherewith they should be likewise disgusted. For who is he that
has contented himself with that which was given him, or that supposed any
thing over great, when he wished the same? Felicity is not insatiable, as men
believe, but it is weak and small, and therefore satisfies no man. Thou
beleeuest that these things are great, because thou art estranged from them,
but to him that has gotten them they are but base: I lie if such a one seek
not to mount higher. That which thou accountest highest, is but a degree. But
the ignorance of truth is the cause that men err thus, and they run unto
that which has but the appearance of good, being deceived by common opinion.
Afterward having by much travel obtained that which they pretended, they see
that those things are evil, vain, and less then they expected, and the most
part of them admireth at one time or another, these false luster of such
vanities. In brief, the common sort esteem those things for good, which are
greatest. But lest we fall into this error, let us enquire that which is good.
The interpretation thereof has been diverse: some have defined the same in one
sort, othersome in another. Some define it thus. Good is that which inuiteth
our minds, and that calls us unto him. H^reunto some pl^asantly object: But
what if such a good inuit a man unto his ruin^? Thou know how many euil^
there are that are attractiue. Truth, and that which seems true differ thus.
That which is good is annexed unto truth, for it is not good except it be true.
But that which inciteth to it s^lf^, and attracteth by his appearance, has a
resemblance of truth: it insinuat^th, it solliciteth, it draws. Some have
defined it thus. Good is that which moves a desire of it self, or that
inciteth the motion of the mind, that tends thereunto. And to this it is
opposed in the same sort. For many things incite the motions of the mind^,
which are desired to their confusion that desire them. Better have they done
who have defined it thus. That is good which draws unto it self according to
nature, that motion of the soul, so that we ought to desire it then, when it
is worthy to be desired. Let us add hereunto that this good is honest and
virtuous, for we ought not to purchase an imperfect good. This place
admonishes me to teach thee the difference that there is betwixt that which is
good, and that which is honest. Somethings they have mixed, and inseparable
between them: neither can that be good which has not some hones^ie in it;
neither that honest which is not good. What difference therefore is betwixt
them both. Hon^stie is a perfect good, wherein a bl^ssed life is accomplished,
by whose attouchment other things are made good also. That which I say is thus.
There are some things which are neither good nor evil; as Warrefare,
Embassage, and Jurisdiction. These things when they are honestly administered,
begin to be good, and become so, whereas before time they were indifferent.
Good by the society of honesty is made good, and honesty by it self is
good. Good flows from honesty, honesty is of it self. That which is good
might have been evil; that which is honest, could not be but good. Some have
proposed this definition. That is good, which is according to nature. Mark
what I say. That which is good is according to nature, yet is not that
forthwith good, that is according to nature. Many things consent unto nature,
yet so small are they, that they deserve not to be called good. For they are
small and contemptible: no good, no not the least is to be contemned, for as
long as it is little, it is not good; when it begins to be good, it is not
little. Whence is any thin^ ^now^ to be good, if it be perfectly according to
nature. Thou do confe^^e, say thou, that this is good which is according
to nature, this is his property. Thou confessest likewise that there are some
things which are according to Nature, and yet not good. How therefore is that
good, when these are not? How attaineth it another property, when as both of
them have this property, to be according to nature? That is to say, in as much
as they are great. Neither is this a new thing, that some things are changed by
increasing. He was an infant; now become a young man: he has had at that time
some other propriety. For the young man is endowed with reason, the infant is
deprived of it. Somethings become not only more great in their increase, but
other things likewise. That, says he, is not made another thing, which is made
greater. It skilleth not whether thou fill a bottle with wine, or a tonn^, the
property of wine remain^th in both the vessels. A little weight of honey and a
great differ not in savor. Thou set down different examples: for in these
the same quality remains, and though they be increased, they are always honey
and wine. Some things amplified in their kind, continue in their property:
some things after many encreasings are changed by the last, which imprinteth in
them a new quality, other the^ that which they had before. One stone will make
an arch, that is to say, that binds in, and fastneth in the d^clining sides,
and that tieth them together. Why has this last stone, although it be little,
so great a use, because it makes the work complete, although it give it not
any great increase. There are some things, which in advancing themselves,
despoile themselves of their former form, and inuest a new. After that our
understanding has long time traveled upon any subject, and that it is wearied
in following the greatness thereof, he begins to esteem it infinite,
because it is become far different from that it was before, when it seemed
great, but not infinite. In like case we have imagined that a thing may not be
cut, which is hardly cut: afterward the difficulty growing to be greater, we
find that the thing can no more be cut. In like sort of a thing which is
hardly moved, we come unto a thing which is immovable. According to the same
reason, some thing has been according to nature, and afterward the
greatness of the same has transported it into another property, and has
made it good.

EPIST. CXIX.
That we may desire riches, and enjoy them without requiring them as
unnecessary. That the end of all things which exceed not nature, is to be
considered. She seeks not superfluity, but sufficient. At last he shows
that all they who commonly are reputed rich, are poor. Good God, they are both
excellent and true.

AS oftentimes as I have found any thing, I expect not till thou say I cry
halfes. I say this unto my self. Thou ask me what it is that I have found
out. Open thy lap, it is mere gain that I give thee. I will teach thee how
thou may become rich suddenly, which thou art very desirous to hear of. And
not without cause I will lead thee the shortest way to great riches. Yet have
thou need of a creditor, and to negotiate, thou must needs borrow, yet will I
not suffer thee to have any Soliciter to borrow for thee, nor Broaker to
publish thy name. I will bestow a creditor on thee, that shall be at thy
commandment. That is to say, that sentence of CATO, Whatsoever it be, it will
suffice, provided that we require that of our selves, whatsoever we want. For
these things (my Lucilius) are alike not to desire and to have. The effect of
the matter in both is alike, thou shall not be vexed. Neither do I command
thee this, to deny Nature any thing, she is obstinat^, she cannot be overcome,
she requires her own. But so that thou may know, that whatsoeu^r exceeds
Nature, is but borrowed, and not necessary. I am an hungry, I must eat:
whether this bread be brown or white, it appertains nothing to Nature. She
will have the belly not delighted but filled. I am a dry, whether this water
be fetched from the next lake, or that which I have closed up in much snow,
that it might be cooled by foreign cold, it concerns Nature no ways. She
commands this one thing, that the thirst should be quenched: whether the pot
be gold or Crystal, or Cassidony, or a pot of Tiuoli, or the hollow of the
hand, it skilleth not. Fix thine eye upon the end of all things, and thou shall
forsake superfluities. Hunger presses me. Let thy hand lay hold on whatsoever
is next thee, the appetite shall make that loathsome, whatsoever I lay hold of.
An hungry stomach is glad of any thing. Thou demandest therefore what thing
it is that delights me? M^ think^s it is worthily spoken. A wiseman is a
diligent searcher of natural riches. Thou payest me, say thou, with an
empty platter. What is that empty? I had already prepared my coasts, and
looked about me upon what sea I should embarke my self to follow traffic,
what public estate I might rent, what merchandise I should send for. It is a
deceit in thee to teach me poverty, when thou have promised me riches. Do
thou then esteem him poor that wants nothing? Thou answerest that it is by
his own means, and by the benefit of his patience, not of Fortune. Do thou
therefore judge him not to b^ rich, because his riches cannot cease? Whether
had thou rather have much, or sufficient? he that has much, desires more,
which is an argument that as yet he has not sufficient: he that has enough,
has attained the end which never befalls a rich man. Do thou therefore
think that these are not riches, because for them no man i^ banished, because
for them no son has given his father poison, nor wife her husband? Because
in wars they are secure, in peace at rest? Because it is neither dangerous to
enjoy them, nor troubl^some to dispose them? Has h^ but a little, that has
neither cold, nor hunger, nor thirst? Jupiter himself has no more. Never is
that little which is sufficient; never is that much, which is not sufficient.
Alexander of Macedon after he had conquered Asia, and the Indians, is poor, he
seeks what he may make his own, he searches out unknown seas, he sends
out new nauies upon the Ocean; and if I may say so, passes and presses beyond
the bounds and limits of the world. That which suffices Nature contenteth not
a man. And some there have been found, that having all things, have
notwithstanding coueted somewhat. So great is the blindness of our minds, and
so great the forgetfulness of men, that they remember not themselves of their
beginnings, when they see themselves advanced. This Prince that was Lord of a
little angle of Greece, and that not without some opposition, is sorry that
after he has discovered and conquered so many Nations, to hear say that he
must return unto his own. Money never made any man rich: contrariwise there is
not any man that has gathered store of it together, that is not become more
covetous. Would thou know the reason hereof? He that has much begins to
have a will to have more. In sum, although thou set before me whom thou will,
of those who are reputed as rich as either Crassus or Licinius. Let him set
down his revenues, and account whatsoever he has, and whatsoever he hops
together^ yet this man, if thou beleeuest me^ is poor, or if thou trust thy
self, may be poor. But he that has composed himself to that which Nature
requires at his hands; is not only without the sense, but also without the
fear of poverty. But to the end thou may know how hard a thing it is to
restrain a man's affairs according to the measure of Nature: this man whom we
suppose to be molded and fashioned according to his will, and whom thou call
poor, has something which is superfluous. But riches attract and blind the
common sort, when great sums of money are carried out of any man's house, when
his roofes are enriched and garnished with gold, when his family are either
comely in body, or courtly in apparel. All these men's felicity is in public
ostentation: but he whom we have exempted both from the eye of the people, and
the hand of Fortune, is blessed inwardly. For as touching those, with whom
poverty has taken place^ and is seized of them under the supposed name of
riches, they have their goods in such sort, as we are said to have the Ague,
when the Ague has us. Contrariwise we must say, the Ague has hold of him: and
in like manner we ought to say, Riches hold and possess him. There is nothing
therefore that I would have thee r^member more then this, that no man is
sufficiently admonished, to the end thou may measure all things by natural
desires which content themselves with nothing or with little. Only beware thou
to mix vices with desires. Ask thou me upon what table, in what silver
vessel, by what services and servants Nature presents thee thy meat. Know
that she requires nothing but meat. When parching thirst does burn thy jaws
throughout,
Seek'st thou for gold therein to quench thy drought?
When hunger tempts thee, do thou loath each meat,
Except thou Peacocks flesh or Turbot eat?
Hunger is not ambitious, she is contented to cease, she cares not much by
what mean^s. These are the torments of unhappy excess, he seeks how after
he is glutt^d, he may get an appetite: how he may not fill, but force and
stuff his body: how he may revoke his thirst again, which is pacified by the
former potion. Horace therefore wittily denies that it appertains to thirst,
in what pot or in how clean a hand water be ministered. For if thou think
that concerns thee, how well frizeled the page is, and how clean and neat
the pot is which he presents thee with, thou art not a dry. Amongst other
things nature has especially favored us herein, that he has taken all
disdain from necessity: superfluities take pleasure in variety. This is
scarce seemly, that not well dressed, this offends mine eyes. The Creator of
all things, who has set down unto us the laws of our life, has given order
to maintain us in health, and not to entertain us in delight. All things are
ready and at hand for the conservation of our healths: if the question be of
delights, all that which concerns them is not recovered, but with much
misery and difficulty. Let us therefore make use of this benefit of nature,
which is, to be numbered amongst the greatest, and let us think that the
greatest matter wherein we are most obliged unto her, is, that she has
effected this in us, that whatsoever is desired in necessity is entertained
and embraced without loathing.

EPIST. CXX.
How the knowledge of goodness came unto us by observation and conference, as
also by the assistance of nature. And it comes likewise by the contrary, that
is, by the de^estation of vice. He describes a wiseman, who not only
spurneth against those things which are commonly to be required or feared, but
death: also in conclusion such a one as is always one, and constant to
himself.

THy Epistle has wandered about many petty questions, yet has stayed it self
upon one, and desires to have my resolution herein: how the first notice of
good and honest things come unto us. These two things in some men's opinion are
diverse, but with us that are Stoics, they are only divided. I will tell thee
what this is; Some men think that that is good which is profitable, and
therefore they impose this name unto riches, to a horse, to wine, to a shoe; so
abject is the name of good amongst them, and so unduly applied unto servile
uses. They suppose that honest which consists in the discharge of a
well-gouerned duty, as to have a charitable care of a man's father in his age,
to comfort and relieve the poverty of a man's friend, to behave himself
valiantly in a warlike expedition, to deliver a man's opinion wisely and
moderately. These make we two, but out of one. Nothing is good except it be
that which is honest, that which is honest is good also. I suppose it a
superfluous matter to annex what difference there is betwixt them, when as I
have oftentimes expressed the same. I will only say this, That nothing seems
good unto us, which a man may use badly. But thou see how many there be that
use their riches, nobility and strength badly. I now therefore return unto
that which thou desire me to resolve thee in, how the knowledge of that which
is good and honest came first unto us. This nature could not teach us, for she
gave us but the seeds of sciences, and not science it self. Some say that we
casually come to the knowledge thereof, which is incredible, that the image of
virtue should casually appear unto any man. But we suppose that by diligence,
observation, and frequent conference of things, estimated by that which is good
and honest, we have attained to this knowledge. And since the Latin
Grammarians have made this word a Citizen of Rome, I will not condemn it, nor
return it to the City from whence it came. I will therefore use the same, not
only as a received but as a usual word: I will set down what the Analogy is;
We have known that there is a health of the body, and thereby have we
gathered that there is some health and vigor of the mind. We have known the
strength of the body, and by these infer we that there is a strength of the
mind likewise. Some benign actions some humane, some strong have amazed us;
these began we to admire as if perfect. These were trauersed by diverse
defaults, which the appearance and brightness of some notable deed did cover,
by means whereof we have made a show that we saw them not. Nature commands
us to amplify those things which are praiseworthy, whereupon every one has
raised glory above the truth. From these things therefore we have drawn the
appeareance of an excellent good. Fabricius refused King Pyrrhus gold, and
judged it a greater matter then a Kingdom, to be able to contemn Kingly
riches. The same man when a Physician promised to poison Pyrrhus, gave him
notice thereof, and wished him to beware of treason. It was the same virtue in
Fabricius, neither to be overcome with gold, nor to overcome with poison. We
have admired this great personage, who neither suffered himself to be won by
the Kings presents, nor by the Physicians promises against the King; constant
in his virtuous resolution, innocent in war, which is a rare thing in a
soldier, who though that a man might be wicked even against an enemy; who in
his greatest poverty whereby he had gotten himself the most honor, no
otherwise fled from riches then from poison. Live, said he, by my means O
Pyrrhus, and rejoice, although thou were displeased therewith that Fabricius
could not be corrupted. Horatius Cocles himself alone closed up, and defended
the strait passage of a bridge, and commanded a Trench to be made behind him,
to the end that his enemies might be hindered from entrance. And so long
resisted he those that assailed him, until such time as he heard the noise of
the prop and timber that fell under him. And after he had looked behind him,
and perceived that by his danger his country was freed from danger: Let him
come, says he, whosoever will follow me thither whither I go. And having said
thus, he cast himself desperately into the water; and having no less care in
this violent channel of the river to save his conquering arms as his life,
and having maintained the honor of his victory, he returned into the City as
secure as if he had entered by the bridge. These and such like acts have
expressed unto us the Image of his virtue. I will add that which happily may
seem admirable: Evil things somet^^es have presented themselves in the shape
of honesty, and that which was the best has been manifested by his contrary.
Some vices, as thou know, have some resemblance of virtues, and those men
that are most vicious and dishonest, have some appearance of goodness. So does
the prodigal man counterfeit the liberal, although there be a great
difference betwixt knowing how to give, and how to keep. Many there are, my
Lucilius, who give not but cast away their money; for I call him not liberal
that is angry with his money. Negligence imitateth facility, and rashness
fortitude. This similitude has constrained us to consider things, and to
distinguish those things which are near in appearance, but far different and
contrary in effect, whilst we observe these, whom some noble exployt has made
famous, we have begun to note what he might be that at one time only had
resolutly, and nobly executed some enterprise. We have seen this man valiant
in war, fearful in the judgment seat, enduring his poverty constantly,
his infamy abiectly: we have praised the act, but contemned the man. We have
seen another courteous toward his friends, temperate toward his enemies,
managing both public and private affairs, both piously and religiously, not
wanting patience in those things which he was to suffer, nor prudence in those
things he was to perform: we have seen such a one that gave bountifully where
necessity required, that was diligent and industrious where he was to labor,
and that relieved the weariness of his body with the constancy of his mind.
Besides, he was always one, and like himself in every action, not only good
in words and counsel, but by custom brought to this pass, that besides
that that he could not do^ ill, he could not also do but that which was good.
Then understanding that virtue was perfected in such a one, we have
distinguished it into some parts. Desires ought to be restrained, f^^re
repressed, actions foreseen, duties distributed: we comprehended temperance,
fortitude, prudence, justice, and gave every one of them their particular
office. Whereby therefore came we to the knowledge of virtue? It was the order
thereof, the seemelinesse, and constancy, and the uniformity of all actions,
within themselves, and the greatness thereof, that exalted it self above all
things that showed the same. Hereby was that blessed life understood that has
a prosperous course, and depends wholly of it self. How therefore appeared
this thing unto us? I will tell thee: never did that perfect man who was
possessed of virtue curse fortune, never entertained he any accidents with
discontent. Believing himself to be a Citizen and Soldier of the world, he
underwent labors, as if they had been enjoined him. Whatsoever happened he
refused it not as evil, or that casually fell upon him, but as some charge
committed unto him. This, says he, whatsoever it be is mine, be it either
difficult or dangerous let us travail therein^ of necessity therefore he
appeared great, who never groaned under the burden of afflictions, never
complained of his destiny, gave unto many a taste of himself, and no
otherwise then a light shined in darkness, and drew all men's minds unto him,
by reason he was courteous and gentle, entertaining in good part all affairs
both divine and humane. He had a perfect mind, drawn to the height of his
perfection; above which there is nothing but the mind of God, a parcel
whereof is derived into this mortal body, which is never more diuin^ then
when it thinks on his mortality, and knows that man is borne to this end,
to forsake this life; neither that this body is a house but an hostrie, yea
and a short hostrie which must be forsaken, when thou perceiuest that thou art
displeasing to thine host. I tell thee, my Lucilius, it is a great argument of
a mind that is derived from a higher place, if it repute those things humble
and abject wherein he conuerseth, and if he fears to forsake them: for he
knows whether he shall depart that remembers himself from whence he came.
See we not how many incommodities do torment us, how badly this mortal body
does agree with us. Sometimes we complain of our bellies, afterward of our
heads, then of our breast and throat: sometimes we are tormented in our nerves,
sometimes vexed in our feet: to day the flux, to morrow the rhume: sometimes
too much blood, sometimes too little, every way are we troubled and driven from
one place to another. This befalls them who are lodged in another man's house;
but we that possess so rotten a body, yet notwithstanding propose unto our
selves an eternity, and as far as humane age may extend it self, so far are
we seized with hope^ contenting our selves with no money or power. What can be
more impudently or more foolishly done then this? There is nothing that
contenteth us that are to die, nay that die every day: for we daily approach
our last hour, and there is not a day or hour that drives and drives us
into the grave where we must rest. See into what blindness our minds are
driven: a greater part of that which I have said must come, is already come,
and threatens us every minute, for the time we have lived is in the same
state where it was before we were living. But it is a great folly for us to
fear the last days of the same, because the first contribute as much unto
death as the last. The degree in which we breath our last, is not that which
leaves us, but only it shows us our lassitude. The last day makes us touch
death, all the rest to approach. She rauisheth us not at once, but snatcheth us
away by little and little. A greater mind therefore that knows that he must
be par^aker of a better life, endeavors it self in this statim wherein he is
placed, to demean himself honestly and industriously. Moreover, he judges
nothing of these things that are about him to be his own, but like a stranger,
and such a one as must suddenly forsake them, uses them as lent him. When we
should see a man of this constancy, why should we not conceive in him the
image of an unusual vnderstanding^ if, as I say, he should make show of so
true a greatness? True qualities continue in their entire, false are flitting.
Some men at sometimes are Vatinians, at other times ^atoes, and some whiles
Curious, in their opinions is a little too severe. Fabricius not sufficiently
poor, Tubero scarce frugall enough, and content with a little, they provoke
Licinius in riches, Apicius in suppers, Mace^as in delights. Inconstancy and a
continual agitation betwixt the dissembling of virtues, and the love of vices,
is a great token of an evil mind. Oft-times two hundred men did him attend,
Oft-times bu^^en^ sometimes his speech did tend
To Kings, to Tetrarches, and to great estates,
Sometimes his Fortunes he more basely rates:
I will, says he, have a three-footed table,
A homely salt, a gown that shall be able,
Though homely, to withst and the winter cold:
Had thou committed to this niggards hold,
That is contented with so little pelf,
Ten thousand crowns to seed and cloth himself
Within few days, nor he, nor all his meny
Could pay thee one, or bless thee with a penny.
All these are such as Horace describes this man, who was never himself, or
ever like himself; so diversely changed he. Said I diverse, scarcely is there
one but is such. There is no man that does not daily change both his counsel
and his vow: now will he have a wife, then a Lemman: now will he govern,
presently he labors for this, that no man may be a more officious servant.
Sometimes he exalts himself so much, as he contracteth envy: sometimes he
abuses himself under every one, and becomes more miserable then those that
are truly wretched: now scatters he his money abroad, presently after he
engrosseth all other men's. Hereby especially is an imprudent mind discovered,
every one betrayeth him, and that which in my opinion is most base, he is
unlike himself. Repute thou it to be a great virtue for a man to be one. But
no man but a wise man does one thing, all the rest of us have many shapes. To
day we will seem to be modest and grave, to morrow prodigal and vain: we
of-times change our mask, and oftentimes take a contrary to that we have put
off. Exact thou therefore this of thy self, that to thy last breath thou
maintain thy self such, as thou have resolved to show thy self. Do this,
that thou may be praised, or approved at the least. A man may justly say of
him whom thou saw yesterday, what is this man? So much is a man changed in a
little time.

EPIST. CXXI.
He pretends somewhat for the wittier sort, and then propounds the same.
Whether every living creature has a sense of his constitution, that is,
whether they willingly and by nature intend thither, whither they ought, and
were made. He says that it is so, and by diverse reasons and examples teaches
the same.

Thou will chide with me, I see, when I shall resolve thee of that question,
wherein this day I spent no little time. For once more will thou exclaim what
concerns these manners? But exclaim at thy pleasure, whilst I first of all
oppose those against thee, with whom thou may contend, I mean Posidonius
and Archidamus, for these shall debate the matter with thee, and afterward I
will say, that whatsoever is moral reformeth not good manners. There is one
thing that appertains to a man to nourish him, another thing to exercise him,
another thing to cloth him, another thing to teach him, another thing to
delight him: yet all these things do appertain unto a man, although not all of
them make him better. Certain instructions concern manners in some sort,
certain in another. Some correct and govern them, some search out their
nature and beginning: when it is demanded why Nature brought forth man, why
she preferred him before all other living creatures. Think thou that I have
left manners a far off? Thou art deceived. For how shall thou know what
manners are to be sought after, except thou find out what is the best for
man, except thou examine his nature? Then at length thou shall understand what
thou art to do, and what to avoid, when as thou have learned what thou owe
to thy nature. I, sav^st thou, will learn how I may desire less, how I may
fear less. Shake o^f from me this superstition: teach me that this which is
called felicity, is but a slight and vain thing, and that the accession of
one syllabble will make it infelicitie. I will satisfy thy desire, and exhort
thee unto virtues, and will whip vices: and although some men repute me too
immoderate in this kind, yet will I not desist to persecute wickedness, to
restrain unbridled affections to temperate desires and pleasures that should
terminate in sorrow; and to oppose my self against wishes. Why not? When as we
have desired the extremest of evils, and that from the joy which we have, our
sorrow has proceeded. In the mean while suffer me to unfold those things
which seem somewhat too much removed from us. The question was, whether in all
creatures there were a sense of their constitution. But that they have a sense,
it hereby most manifestly appears, because they fitly and readily move their
members, as if they had bin fashioned thereunto. Every one of them has an
agilitie in his parts. A workman handles his tools readily. The master of a
ship knows how to s^eere his helm of his ship fitly. A Painter does quickly
discern those diversities of colors which are laid before him, to the end he
may apply them in his work, and with a ready hand and eye he passes betwixt
the wax, and the similitude or resemblance which he would draw: so living
creatures move themselves in every sort, according as it becomes them. We are
wont to wonder at these cunning actors, who have their hands so nimble, that
they are able to represent all things, and effect readily by their gesture,
whose fingers are as nimble as their tongues. That which Art vouchsafed them,
Nature allows these. There is no man but stirs his members without pain,
there is no one restrained, when he has need to move himself, being borne
unto this motion: they perform it readily; they come into this world with this
science, and are borne so instructed. Therefore, says he, shall living
creatures most fitly move their parts, because if they moved them otherwise,
they should feel pain. So as you say, they are compelled, and fear and not
will makes them move aright, which is false. For they are slow which are
enforced by necessity, agilitie is a voluntary motion. But so far o^f is it
that fear of pain drives them hereunto, that they endue themselves in their
natural motion, although pain do prohibit them. So the infant that
meditateth how to stand, and is accustomed to keep himself on his feet, as
soon as he begins to try his forces, he falls, and crying rises again,
so often until by means of grief he has exercised himself in that which
Nature requires at his hands. There are some living creatures of a harder
back, which turned upon the same, so long time tumble themselves, and stretch
out their feet and bow them in, till such time as they have recovered their
ordinary custom and place. The Tortuise being cast upon her back feels no
torment, notwithstanding she cease not to struggle and stir her self,
until such time as she feels her self in her natural estate, and that she
has recovered her feet. Each of them therefore has a sense of his
constitution, and thereby a ready use of their members: neither have we any
more greater token that they came to live with this knowledge, then for that
there is no living creature that is ignorant how to use his body.
Constitution, says he, as you define it, is the principal and fairest part of
the soul, that in some sort has some power over the body. This definition so
perplexed and subtle, and such as you your selves can scarcely discover. How
does an infant understand it? All living creatures should have been borne
Logicians, to the end that they might understand this definition, which might
seem obscure to the chiefest and wisest part of the Citizens. True it were
which thou opposest, if I said that the definition of constitution were
understood by brute beasts. For constitution it self is more easily
understood, then taught by Nature. Therefore that infant knows not what
constitution is, yet knows he his own constitution^ and what an Animal is,
he knows not, yet feels he himself to be an Animal. Besides that, he
understands his Nature grossly, summarily, and obscurely. We also know well
that we have a soul, but what the soul is, where it is, of what quality it
is, and whence it is we know not. Such sense of our mind as we have attained
unto, although we are ignorant of the nature and seat thereof, such sense have
all living creatures of their constitution. For they must needs feel, that by
means whereof, they have sense of other things, and they must of necessity
have a sense of that thing which governs them, and which they obey. There is
not any one of us but knows that there is a cer^aine thing which stirs his
affections, but no man knows what it is, and each man knows that he has an
endeavor, but what it is, or whence it is he knows not. Even as infants, so
other living creatures have a sense of their principal part, but this
resentiment is obscure and not manifest. You say (says he) that a living
creature is above all things accommodated to his nature and constitution, but
that man's constitution is to be a reasonable soul, and therefore that man is
accomodated to himself, not as to a living creature only, but as to a
reasonable living creature, for he is dear and precious unto himself, as he
is a man. But how therefore may an infant be accomodated to his reasonable
constitution, when as yet he is not reasonable? Every age has his
constitution, an infant has one, a stripling another, an old man another, for
all of them are accomodated to the constitution wherein they remain. The
infant is without teeth, this is a constitution that agrees with him^ his
teeth grow out, and this is agreeable to his age. For even that herb that must
grow to a stalk and ear^, has one constitution when it is tender, and scarce
appears above the furrow; another when it waxes stronger, and has a tender
stalk, yet sufficiently able to bear his burden: another when it waxes
yellow and is ready for harvest, and the ear thereof is hardened into
whatsoever constitution it comes, it maintains the same, and accomodateth
it self thereunto. The age of an infant is one, of a little lad another, of a
young man another, of an old man another; yet am I the same, who both was an
infant, a young lad, and a young man. So although each ones constitution be
different, yet the accord thereof is always one. For Nature commends unto me
not a boy, not a young man, or an old man, but my self. And therefore an infant
is accomodated to that constitution which he has in being an infant, not which
he shall have when he is a young man: because not only the estate wherein he
is, but that estate which remains as yet more great, whereunto he ought to
attain, depends upon his nature. First of all, the living creature has care
of himself, for there must be somewhat whereunto the rest are referred. I
seek pleasure: for whom? for my self: therefore have I a care of my self, I
fly from pain; for whom? for my self: therefore have I a care of my self.
If I do all things for the care I have of my self, I have a care of my self
above all things. This is in all living creatures, it is not inferred, but
innate: Nature brings out her fruit, but casts them not out, and because
the most assured guard is that which is nearest; each one is committed to the
charge and consideration of himself. Therefore, as I have said before, the
most tenderest creatures, which either from their dam, or otherwise have been
brought to light, do presently know what that is, which is hurtful unto them,
and fly from those things that threaten them with death; and chickens and small
foul, which are exposed for a prey to the grater foul that live by rapine,
fear the shadow of all those which pass and houer over them. There is no
creature that enters life, but has a fear of death. How (says he) can a
living creature that is newborn know that which is healthful or harmefull to
him? First, the question is, whether he understand, not how he understands.
And that they have understanding, hereby it appears, that they will do nothing
more then they understand: why is it that the Heron flies not from the Pecock,
or a Goose when she is much lesser, and yet unknown to both, and yet hides
her self when she espieth a hawk? Why do chickens fear the cat, and not the
dog? It appears that they have a cetain knowledge of that which is hurtful
unto the^, not gathered by experience for they take heed before they can make
trial of the danger. Furthermore, lest thou should suppose that this
happens by chance, they fear none but those whom they ought, neither forget
they that such and such are their enemies, and are to be avoided. Besides, they
are not made more fearful by living, whereby it appears that they attain
the same, not by use, but by a natural love of their safety. That which use
teaches is diverse, and increases by little and little. But all that which
Nature proposes is equally and readily communicated to all: Notwithstanding,
if thou will, I will show thee how each living creature enforces her self to
know that which is harmeful unto her. She feels that she consists of flesh,
and consequently knows, that by means whereof her flesh may be cut, burnt,
or b^uised. She reputeth those beasts her contraries and enemies that are armed
to hurt. Th^se things are united together. For every living creature has a
present care to conserve her self, she searches that which may solace her,
and fears that which may offend her. If she repulse those things which are
contrary unto her, Nature teaches her the same, and that which she teaches,
she knows without discourse, and without resolution of will. See thou not
what subtlety Bees have in building their hiues, how marvelous accord they
have in distributing and doing their business? See thou not how no mortal
creature can imitate the Spiders web? what cunning she has in disposing her
threeds, the one are wouen outright, in stead of the foundation, the other are
twisted round and small, to the end she may surprise and catch, as it were in a
net, those flies, for whom she lays her snares, and on whom she makes her
prey? This art is borne with the Spider, and not learned. Therefore no
creature is more learned then another. Thou shall see that the Spiders webs are
all alike; that the hiues wherein the Bees rest have enterances alike. That
which Art teaches is uncertain and unequal, but that which nature teaches
is always uniform: She has not trained living creatures in other sort, but
to keep themselves, to know and follow their nature, by means whereof, also
their sci^nce and their life begin both together. Neither is it to be wondered
at, that these living creatures are borne with their natural science,
considering, that without the same, they should take their life in vain. Nature
has furnished them with this first instrument, to arrest them in the communion
and love of themselves. They could not maintain themselves except they would,
neither could this of it self profit, but without this nothing had profited.
But in no c^eature shall thou find the contempt of her self, or the neglect.
In those likewise which are silent and brutish, although in respect of the rest
they be dull, yet in regard of life they are cunning. Thou shall see that those
things which are unprofitable for others, forget not the care that they ought
to have of themselves.

EPIST. CXXII.
That the nature of excess is contrary to manner. He pleasantly describes
the nature of supping, drinking, sleeping, rising, and such like indirect
delights.

THe days already has felt some detriments, they are somewhat diminished;
yet so, as there is time enough as yet, if so be a man (if I may so speak it)
will rise more officious and better with the day it self, then if he should
expect the same to go and court others upon the day light. Base is that man
that lies slumbering long time after Sun rise, that awakeneth at noone, and
this time to some is early day. There are many that pervert the offices both
of day and night, and that never open their eyes (being ouer-burthened by
ouer-nights drunkenness) before the evening discovers it self. Such as
their condition is said to be, when Nature (as Virgil says) has placed
subject, and opposite to our feet. And when to us the dayspring does appear,
And bl^shing mor^e shows PHOE^VS steedes are near,
To them the ruddie even with weaker light,
Kindels the lightsome Tapers of the night.
Such is not the Region, but their life, so that contrary and opposite to that
of ours. There are certain Antipodes in the same City, who, as Cato says,
Never saw either the rising or setting Sun. Think thou that these men know
how to live, that know not when they live? And these are they that fear death,
in which they have buried themselves alive; as fatal are these as
night-runners. Although they pass their nights in wine and perfumes, although
they employ the time of their intemperate vp-^itting in feasts and variety of
many dishes, yet those which they solemnize are not feasts but funerals.
Vndou^tedly by day time men are wont to celebrate the obsequies of the dead;
but assuredly there is no day too long to him that trauaileth. Let us extend
our life; the office and argument hereof is action, and let somewhat thereof be
reserved to the day. Those birds which are bought to celebrate a feast are kept
dark, to the end that by sitting still they may more easily become fat; so such
as he without any exercise, a sluggish swelling in^adeth their bodies, and a
soft fat grows about their members; so deformed do their bodies seem that
hane dedicated themselves to darkness. For their color is no less pleasing
then theirs that are wearied and made pale with sickness, they languish,
look bleach^ and are discolored, and in their li^e their flesh is corrupted.
Yet will I say that this is the least of evils in them, how far greater
darkness is there in their mind? The one is stupid, the other is almost
blind, and seems to envy those that see not a whit. Who ever had eyes to
use them in darkness? Ask thou me how this depriuednesse of the mind
grows, by loathing the day and transferring the whole life into night? All
vices fight against nature, all of them leave their own order. This is the
purpose of excess, to rejoice in perverse things, and not only to depart from
the right, but to fly a far off from it, and to be at length opposite unto
it. Do not these men in thy judgment live contrary to nature that drink
fasting, that pour in wine into their empty veins, and sit down drunk to
their dinners? But this is an ordinary error in young men, who exercise their
strength, who almost in the very entrance of the Bath, do not only drink but
gull down wine amongst those that are naked, to the end they might restrain
the sweat which they have moved by their hot and often quaffings. It is an
ordinary matter to drink after Dinner or Supper; our country house keepers
do the like, who are ignorant of true pleasure. That wine delights which
swimmeth not upon our meats, which freely pierces unto the nerves. That
drunkenness delights that comes upon an empty stomach. Seem they not in
thy judgment to live contrary to nature who are as effeminate in their
garments as women? Live they not against nature, who study to have childish
beauty upon a wrinckled forehead? What thing can be more miserable or more
horrible? He will neu^r be a man because he may long time suffer a man^ and
when as his sex should repriue him from con^umely, his age it self cannot
discharge him. Live they not against nature that in winter long for a Rose, and
by the nourishment of warm waters, and the fit change of heat i^ winter time
cause a Lilly and such flowers as are destinated to the spring to flourish?
Live they not against nature that plant Orchards on their highest Towers, that
have whole Forests shaking upon the tops and Turrets of their houses,
spreading their roots in such places, where it should suffice them that the
tops of their branches should touch? Live they not against nature that lay the
foundations of their bathes in the sea? Neither suppose that they swim
delicately enough, except their warm bathes be environed with tempestuous
billows? When as they have resolved to intend all things against the custom
of nature, at last they wholly revolt from her. Is it day? It is time to go to
bed: it is night, now let us exercise our selves, now let us be coached, now
let us dine: does the morning approach? It is time to go to supper. We must
not live according to common custom, it is a base, ordinary and vulgar course
of life. Let the common day be relinquished, let the morning be proper and
peculiar unto us; for mine own part I rank these men amongst the dead: for
how little are they distant from their funerals, and they most fatal that live
by Torch and wax light? I remember that at one time diverse men led this life.
Amongst others Attilius Buta a Praetorian, who after he had spent all his goods
in gluttony, which were very great when he complained him of his poverty to
TIBERIUS; Too late (said the Emperiour) art thou awakened. MONTANVS JULIUS an
indifferent Poet, well known through the favor and repulse he had at Caesar's
hands, took pleasure to enterlace in his verses these words Ortus and Occasus,
which signify the rising and setting of the Sun, One day a certain friend of
his being displeased because Montanus had not given over for the space of a
whole day to recite some of his compositions, said that a man should not give
^are to a man, so importunate Natta Prinarius taking fit opportunity, said,
Can I use him more courteously? I am ready to hear him from the Sun rise to
the Sun set; when he had recited these Verses, PHOE^VS begins to show his
burnisht light,
And blushing day to spread his shining face,
And now begins the Swallow with delight
To feed her young, within her neast a space,
And to her wings, breed by one and one
Yield from her neb their food to feed upon.
Varus a Roman Knight, a companion of Lucius Vinicius an ordinary smel-feast,
who was the better welcome by reason he wittily and bitterly jested at those
whom he thought fit, cried out aloude, BVTA begin to sleep: again, when after
that he had recited, Now have the shepherds cloasd their fruitful Kie
Within their stalls, now dull and darksome night
Begins to spread her sad and silent eye,
Upon the dulsome earth deprived of light.
The same Varus said, What says he? It is now night, I will go and salute
BVTA. There was nothing more notorious then this preposterous life of Buta,
whereunto diverse applied themselves in that time, as I have said. The cause of
this disorder is not in that they think that the night has any thing more
pleasing in it, because nothing hinders them, and for that the day is
displeasant to an evil conscience; and because the light costeth nothing, it
contenteth not him that coueteth or disdaineth all things, according as they
cost more or less. Besides, these unbridled persons will have their immoderate
life spoken of whilst they live; for if it be obscured, they think they loose
their labor. They are displeased therefore as often as they do not that which
may make them be spoken of: many of these devour their goods, many of them
have their harlots; and if thou will have credit amongst these men, thou must
needs commit some lascivious or notable folly. In a City so possessed with
sin a common and ordinary error is not looked after nor talked upon. I have
heard Pedo Albinouanus report (which was a man of a very pleasant discourse)
that he dwelt a little above Sparius Papinius house, who was one of the company
of the night-Owles and light-shunners: About the third hour of the night,
says he, I hear the lashing of the whips, and I ask what he does? They
answer me that he calls his servants to account. About the sixth hour of the
night, I hear a shrill voice, and I ask what it is? and they answer me that
he exercises his voice. I ask about the eight hour of the night what that
rattling of wheels means? they answer, that he will take the air. About
day light I hear running up and down the Pages are called for, the Butlers
and Cooks make a stir; I ask what that means? they answer me that he was
come out of his Bath and required broth and drink. What did his supper, said
he, exceed the day? No; for he lived very frugally, and spent nothing but the
night. And therefore he oftentimes answered those that called him covetous and
a slouen; You would likewise call him, Lichnobius, that is to say, such a one
as lives by the Lamp. Thou must not wonder, although thou find so many
proprieties of vices; they are diverse, and have innumerable faces, their kinds
cannot be comprehended. The managing of that which is good is simple, and that
which is evil manifold, and is disposed in all sorts as a man list. The same
befalls manners, such as follow Nature are facile and free, and have small
differences; the rest are extrauagant and never accord amongst themselves: but
the especial cause of this sickness in my opinion, is the hatred of common
life. As they distinguish themselves from other men in their garments, as in
their great and costly suppers, and in the richnes of their coaches, so will
they be separated from other in the disposition of times they will not sin
ordinarily, whose reward in sinning is infamy. This do all they seek after,
who (if I may say so) live sinisterly. Therefore my Lucilius, we are to follow
that way, which nature has prescribed us; neither must we wander out of the
same. They that do this, find all things facile and expedit, but they that
strive against the same, their life is no otherwise then theirs who strive
against the stream.

EPIST. CXXIII.
That a thin and simple diet by the decree of the mind and hunger are made
desirable. That rich men are to use the same likewise; for who knows whether
he shall have need thereof? Let neither custom or foreign manners seduce us.
Despise all contrary judgments or opinions.

BEing spent by my journey more incommodious then long, I came to my Albanum
very late in the night, I find nothing ready but my self. For this cause I
laid me down in my bed to ease my weariness, and take in good part this
negligence of my Cook and Baker: for thus debate I upon this matter with my
self; There is nothing so grievous that can distaste thee if thou endure it
patiently, neither any thing that may displease thee except thou thy self
cause it by thy fretting. My Baker has no bread, but my Farmer has, my Porter
has, my Plowman has. But thou will say it is course bread: stay a while it
will be made good; hunger I tell thee, will make it more pleasing unto thee
then thy white bread. Therefore ought we not to eat any thing before hunger
command us. I will therefore stay and refrain eating till such time as either
I begin to have good, or forbear to loath bad. It is a necessary thing to
accustom our selves to frugalie: many difficulties of time and place do
sometimes hinder the most richest and greatest Lords from their long desired
dinners. No man can have whatsoever he will, yet may he not will that which he
has not, and use those things that are presented him thankefully. A great part
of liberty is a well-gouerned belly, and patient in all wants. Thou can not
imagine what pleasure I take in this, that my weariness is appeased of it
self. I seek neither unction nor Bath, nor any other remedy, but only time:
for that which labor has bred rest takes away. This will be more pleasing
then a supper prepared for the gods: for sometimes I have made a sudden
experiment of the forces of my mind, and I find it to be the most simple and
assured; for whereas the mind has prepared it self, and enjoined himself
patience, a man cannot see how much firmitie it has: for they are the most
certain arguments which she instantly gave, if not only with an equal but a
temperate eye he has beheld them, if she has not been displeased nor has
contested, if that which should be given, himself ministers to himself by
not desiring, and thinks that there is somewhat wanting to his custom and
not unto himself. We never understood that many things were superfluous, but
when they began to be missing: for we used them not because we ought, but
because we had them. But how many things do we prepare, because other men have
prepared them? because they are usual amongst many? Amongst the causes of our
evils, this is one, that we live by example; neither are we governed by reason,
but led away by custom, which if few men did, we would not imitate: when as
many have begun to do the same we follow it as if it were more honest, because
it is more frequent, and error with us supplieth the place of that which is
right, when it is made public. All men now-a-dayes travail in such sort,
that a troop of Numidian horsemen leads them the way, and a company of
footmen attends upon their stirrup. It should be an indignity unto them if
they had not some attendants to thrust those out of the way that met them, and
that should show in raising much dust, that an honest man came after them. In
these days all men have Moiles that bear their vessels of crystal, and such
as are made of Cassonie, and enameled by the hands of great Artists: it is a
shame for thee if thou seem to have those carriages as might not be broken.
All the Litters wherein they carry their Minions are covered, and they
themselves have their faces anointed, lest either the Sun or cold should
harm their tender skins; it is shame that there is no one in the company of
their Minions, that has a face so fair that it needs not to be farded. All
these men's conference is to be avoided, these are they that teach vices, and
convey them from one place to another. They were reputed the worst sort of men
that were tale-carriers, but some there are that bear vices. These men's speech
does much mischief; for although it instantly hurts not, yet leaves it some
seeds in the mind, and it follows us even then when we have left them,
likely hereafter to enkindle a new evil in us. Even as they who have heard
some excellent Music bear away with them in their ears that harmony and
sweetness of song, which hinders the thoughts, and suff^reth them not to be
intended to serious matters: so the speech of flatterers, and such as praise
vice, sticks longer time in our mem^ries, then it is ^eard: neither i^ it an
easy matter to extinguish so sweet a sound in the mind, it followeth^ and
continues, and returns again somewhiles after into our remembrance. It
becomes us therefore in the beginning to stop ^p our ears against evil
voices, for when they have gotten entrance, and are admitted, they are more
audac^ous. From thence men grow to this language, Virtue, Philosophy, and
Justice, is but the brute of vain words. The only felicity is to make good
cheer, to live at pleasure, and to have an ample patrimony. This it is that
is called life, this is to remember that a man is mortal. The daye^ fleet
from us, and our life so posteth away as we may never recover it. Why are we
doubtful to frame our selves according to our fantasy, and to satisfy our
flesh her desires, whilst she demands them, whilst she will and can take
them? Why take we care to spare for the time after our death, and to forbid our
selves that for the present, which she will carry away? Thou have no she
friend, no boy, that may move jealousy in thy mistress. Each day walk thou
out of thy house sober, so suppest thou, as if thou were accountable to thy
father for the expense thou make every day. This is not to live, it is to
assist and keep company with the living. What folly is it to heap up riches
for thine heir, and to deny thy self all things, that the great goods thou
possessest might make thy friend thine enemy; for the more he enjoys by
thee, the more he rejoices at thy death. Set not a farthing by these severe
and bold causers of another man's life, enemies to their own, such men as would
regent the whole world: neither doubt thou to make choice of a merry life
before a good fame. These speeches are no otherwise to be fled, then the songs
of the Sirens, which Ulysses would not sail by, ^^fore he had tied himself to
the mast of his ship. They have the same power, they take from those that give
ear unto them, their country, their parents, their friends, their virtues,
and drag th^se miserable creatures through the ordures of a shameful and
infamous life. How far better is it to follow the direct way, and to aim at
this end that those things at length may only seem pleasing unto thee which
are honest? Which we may attain, if we shall conceive two kinds of things, the
one whereof draw us, the other drive us away. Those that inuit us, are riches,
pleasures, beauty, ambition: in brief, all that which flattereth us, and is
agreeable unto us. They that drive us away are travail, death, dolor,
ignominy, and want. We must therefore exercise our selves, lest we fear the
one or desire the other. Let us make head against that which is contrary, and
let us depart from those things which inuit us, and make war against those
that importune us. See thou not how diverse the habit is of those, that ascend
and descend? Those that descend from a steep place, bend their bodies
backward, they that ascend an high place^ lie upon their bellies. For if in
descending thou swayest thy self forward, or in ascending thou leanest
backward: this (my Lucilius) is to consent with vice. We d^scend into
pleasures, we must mount in the incommodities and adversities of this life. Let
us press forward in these, and restrain our selves in the other. Think
thou now, that I say this, that they only are preiudicious to our ears, who
praise voluptuousnes, who increase the apprehension of pain, a thing that of
it self is dreadful enough. Those men likewise, in my opinion, are hurtful
unto us, who under pretext of being Stoics, exhort us unto vices: that a
wiseman only is both learned, and a lover, that only he is practiced in this
Art. The wiseman is as skillful in drinking, as in banqueting. Let us
enquire until what years young men are to be beloved. Let these things be
allowed to Grecian custom. Let us rather address our ears to those things
that follow. No man is casually good; virtue is to be learned, voluptuousnes is
a vile and base thing, and of mean price^ common to man, with brute beasts,
and whereunto the least, and most contemptible do fly. Glory is vain, and
swiftly flies, and is more inconstant then the wind. Poverty is displeasing
to no man, except to him that hears it impatiently. Death is no evil. Why
complainest thou? She it is alone that deals justly, and carries her self
equally toward all humane kind. Superstition is a mad error, it fears those
whom she should love, and violateth her masters. For what difference is there,
whether thou deniest the gods, or defraudest them? These things are to be
learned, yea they are to be kept continually in remembrance. Philosophy must
not suggest excuses unto vice. That sick man has no hope of his health, who
is counseled by his Physicians to intemperance.

EPIST. CXXIIII.
Against the Epicures, that good consists in reason, not in sense. And
therefore that infants are not as yet capable thereof: neither is it complete,
except it be where reason is complete. How shall I understand that it is in
me, if I seek nothing without my self?

I Can recount, if so thou list to hear,
Full many precepts of the ancient wise,
Except thou loath to lend thy listening ear,
To know from whence the lesser cares arise.
But thou loathest not, neither does any subtlety disgust thee. Thy gentle
spirit disdaineth not the smallest things, although it comprehend the greatest.
I likewise approve this in thee also, because thou reducest all things to some
use, and ar^ only offended then, when with much subtlety nothing is effected,
which I will not now endeavor to do. The question is, whether good be
comprehended by sense or understanding. Hereunto it is annexed, that it is
neither in brute beasts, nor in infants: they that hold voluptuousness for the
chiefest good, do judge good to be sensible. We contrariwise considering it in
the soul, maintain that it is intelligible. If they did judge of the good of
sense, we should reject no voluptuousness, because all of them are both
attractiue and pleasing, And contrariwise, we should willingly undergo no
pain, because there is none but offends the sense. Besides, they should not
be worthy of reprehension, who are too much affected to voluptuousnes, and are
too exceedingly afraid of pain. But we mislike those that are addicted to
their belly and lust, and contemn those, who for fear of pain dare attempt
nothing courageously. But wherein do they offend, if they obey their senses,
that are the judges of good and evil. For to these Masters have you given the
power to desire and fly. But reason has charge of this, and must order as
well good and evil, as virtue and honesty. For by these the pre-eminence is
given to the baser part, to judge of the better, and their meaning is, that the
sense which is a dim and dull thing, and more slow in men then in other
living creatures, should censure what the true good is. What if a man would
discern the smallest things by sight, and not by touch, to discern evil from
good, a man cannot find a more sharp and better intended sight then that of
the eye. Thou see in what ignorance of truth he remains, and with what
ignorance he has trod^n those things under foot which are divine, who will
make the touch to be the judge of good and euill^ Even as, says he, every
Science and Art ought to have something in it, which is manifest, and
comprehended under sense, from whence it may be derived and increase: even so a
blessed life has for his foundation and beginning, something which is both
apparent and sensible. But you say that a blessed life takes her beginning
from manifest things. We say that those things are blessed, which are
according to nature, but what is according to nature appears clearly and at
the first sight, as that also which is entire. What is that which is according
to nature? It is that which befalls him who is newly borne, I say not good,
but the beginning of good. Thou attributest pleasure unto infancy, as if it
were their chiefest good, that at his birthday he should begin there, whither
he attaineth when he is become a man. Thus put thou the top of the tree
into the place of the root. If a man should say, that an infant lying in his
mothers womb, and scarce begun, tender, imperfect, and without form, is
already in possession of any good, should he not seem to err manifestly? But
what difference is there betwixt an infant, that does begin to be, and one
which is as yet but a hidden burden in his mothers womb? Both these, in
respect of the understanding of good and evil, have equal maturitie: and no
more is an infant capable of good as yet, then a tree, or any dumb beast? But
why is not good in a tree or dumb beast? Because reason is not in them, and
therefore is it not in an infant, by reason that he wants reason, whereunto
when he has attained, he shall approach more goodness. There is some creature
which is not reasonable^ and some other which is not as yet endued with reason,
if it be it is imperfectly. Goodness is neither in the one, nor in the other.
Reason brings that good with himself. What difference then is there betwixt
the things above mentioned? Never shall good be in a living creature which is
deprived of reason, neither can it be in him that is not as yet endued with
reason, as long as he remains in that estate, she may be, but she is not ^s
yet. So then I say (my Lucilius) that good is not found in every body, or in
all ages, and is as far estranged from the infant, as that which is last, is
distant from that which is first, and the beginning of a thing, from the
accomplishing and perfection of the same, and consequently, good is not in a
body which does but newly receive form in his mothers womb: no more is there
in the seed whence the body has form: as if thou make mention of the good
of any tree or plant, it is not in the first leaf that buddeth forth. The
corn has some good which is not in the tender blade, nor in the straw, but in
the grain which is ready to be reaped. Even as all nature, except it be
consummate, brings not forth his good, so the good of a man, is not in a man,
except he be possessed of perfect reason. But what this good is, I will tell
thee: It is a free and upright mind, that subiecteth all other things under
him, and is himself subject to nothing. Too far is infancy from pertaking
this good, that the childish age hops it not, and youth does weakly hope the
same. Happy is old age if it attain thereunto by long and diligent study,
when this is both good and able to be understood. Thou did say, say
thou, that there is a certain good of a tree, another of an herb; therefore
may an infant have some good. The true good neither is in trees^ nor in dumb
creatures; that good which is in these is called but a borrowed good: and what
is that, say thou? That which is according to the nature of every thing.
There is not one brute beast that may in any sort participate good, which
belongs to a better and more happy nature: there is no good but there where
reason has place. These four natures are distinct; that of a Tree, that of a
Beast, that of a Man, and that of a God. These two which are without reason are
of the same nature, the other two are diverse, the one immortal, the other
mortal. Of these the one makes his own god accomplished, and that is God,
and a man's diligence addresseth the other. The rest are perfect in their
nature, but not truly perfect if reason be absent from them. For that is
finally perfect which is perfect according to common nature, but common nature
is reasonable, the rest may be perfect in their kind. That wherein happy life
cannot be, cannot have that thing which causes happy life, but a blessed life
is made by good things, and in a dumb beast that is not that whereby blessed
life is effected, and therefore good cannot be in a dumb beast. A dumb beast
comprehends things that are present, by sense he remembers those things that
are past at such time as that which awakeneth the sense, awakeneth it self, as
a horse remembers himself of his way when he is set into the beginning of it:
whilst he stands in the Stable he has no remembrance thereof, although he
has trod it over many times. But the third time, that is to say, that which
is to come appertains not to dumb beasts: how then can their nature seem to
be perfect who have no use of perfect time? For time consists of three parts,
of that which is past, of that which is present, of that which is to come. That
which is only present and shortest, and passes soonest is given to beasts: as
touching that which is past, they have either none or little remembrance
thereof neither, but casually think they on things that are present; thus the
good of a perfect nature cannot be in an imperfect nature. Or if by nature she
has it, she has it as herbs have; neither do I deny but that brute beasts
have their motions very rude and violent toward those things which seem to be
according to nature, but such motions are confused and disordered, but there
cannot be any confusion or disorder in good. Why then say thou do brute
beasts move themselves confusedly and disorderly? I would say that they moved.
^^mselues confusedly and disorderly, if their nature were capable of order: but
they have a motion according to nature. For we call that thing confused, which
sometimes may not be confused, and that careful which may be assured; vice is
in nothing wherein virtue may not be; dumb beasts have by nature that motion
which they have. But ^est I detain thee ouer-long, there shall be some good in
a dumb beast, some virtue, some perfection; but what shall it be, but what
good? Neither absolutely good, neither virtue, neither perfect; for these
privileges do only appertain unto those that are endowed with reason, who
have the knowledge given them why, how far, and how. Thus good is not in any
thing, except it be ended with reason. Do thou ask me whereunto this
disputation tends, and what profit it shall yield unto thy mind? I will
tell thee, it exercises it, it whetteth it, and detaineth the same in some
honest meditation, since he must employ and occupy himself. But that which
restrains the mind that runs after vice, is profitable. But this I say,
that the greatest good I can do thee, is to teach thee thy good, to separate
thee from brute beasts, and to lodge thee with God. Why do thou entertain
and nourish the forces of thy body? Nature has granted brute and savage
beasts greater th^n these? Why do thou so carefully maintain thy beauty,
when as thou have done thy uttermost thou shall be overcome by many brute
beasts in comeliness? Why do thou trim thy hair with so great diligence,
when thou have either scattered it after^ the Parthian manner, or tied it up in
knots after the Germane fashion, or let it grow long as the Scithians are wont;
in every horse thou shall find a thicker crest, in every Lion a goodlier. When
thou shall address thy self to run, the Hare will outstrip thee, will thou
leave these foreign advantages in pursuit, whereof thou have always the
worst, and return unto thy good? And what is this? undoubtedly it is a
reformed mind, pure and imitating good, extolling himself above humane
things, placing nothing of himself without himself. Thou art a reasonable
creature: what good is there therefore in thy self? Perfect reason. Summon
thou that to his chiefest perfection, and let it increase as much as it may.
Then suppose thy self to be blessed when all thy joy shall proceed from thy
self, when in th^se things which men long after, wish and desire thou find
nothing I say, not that thou would rather have, but that thou would have.
I will give thee a short lesson, whereby thou may measure thy self, whereby
thou may perceive that thou art perfect. Thou shall possess thy true good,
when thou shall know that those are most unhappy who are happy.

The end of SENECAES Epistles.
THE MEMORABLE AND FAMOVS TRACTS, BOTH MORAL AND NATVRALL, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS
ANNAEVS SENECA.

LONDON, Printed by William Stansby. 1613.

LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA His Discourse of PROVIDENCE: OR Why good men are
afflicted, since there is a divine PROVIDENCE.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THis little book is a golden book, and was written, as I conceive, after
CALI^VLAS time, and I judge it by his fourth Chapter: I heard a Fencer, in
CAIUS CAESAR'S time, complaining of the scantnesse of rewards. He speaks of
the time past, and of the man and the time which was. I think therefore that
he wrote it under CLAUDIUS, and presently upon his return. Yea but what if he
wrote some of these Philosophical Discourses in his exile? For he continued
there a long time, about some eight years, and upon just cause made choice
hereof to comfort himself. For the argument is, that there is a Providence,
and yet notwithstanding, that some evils, but they external, do befall good
men. He first of all in generality auoweth the same, by the motion, order, and
constancy of the world, all which do testify that there is a Governor.
Afterward he more particularly examineth the question. Why therefore do
misfortunes happen to good men? First of all he says, that God loves good
men, and that therefore he sends them not afflictions. That like a father
he corrects and checketh them. Again, that these seem no afflictions unto
good men, neither that they are overcome, but exercised by them, and made
constant by their tribulations. That God is, as it were, a Judge of the game,
and takes delight in these his strong and confident wrastlers. This handles
he generally, and as it were in way of induction to the third Chapter. From
that forward he more distinctly goes forward, to set down five reasons why
they happen. First, that it is for their good, for whom they happen. Secondly,
for all men's. Thirdly, for such as would have them happen. Fourthly, that they
happen by fate and an eternal Law. He handles the first reason in the third
and fourth Chapter, and teaches that it is for their good, to whom they
chance, as a medicine is to those that are sick. They are likewise confirmed
by God by this means, who brings those forth to the battle, who are worthy
of him: that he suffers the rest of baser metal to live in idleness and
obscurity. He handles the second in the fifth Chapter, that it is for all men's
good, that good men, and such as are so reputed, might cry out unto others,
and show them they are not good or evil, which the common sort esteems such.
He counsels them therefore to have an eye to those that are true, and to
affect them, and fly the other. In that place he entreats of the other, of
such as are willing to entertain the same, for they give themselves to God and
Fate. The fourth concludes that there is Fate, and that it is constituted from
eternity, what thou should rejoice and grieve at. Again, he repeateth
this, that these things are not evil, and brings in God most excellently
exhorting and exciting them to constancy. He concludes Stoically, if thou
dislike it, and can not abide it, who holds thee? the door is open, get
thee out.

CHAP. I.
Having approved that there is a Providence, he sh^weth in general, by
consideration of all creatures both high and low, that it is impossible that
they should be without a most wise moving cause, since the effects they have
are so admirable.
THOU have demanded of me, my friend Lucilius, how it should come to pass (if
so be the world were governed by any Providence) that so many evils befall good
men? I might more readily and fitly give thee an answer hereunto in a place of
this Discourse, where I intend to prove that Providence has a power over all
things, and that God is always present with us. But since it is thy pleasure
that I divide this part from the whole, and that I satisfy thee in this one
contradiction, permitting the rest of the question to remain untouched. I will
perform it, since I know it is no hard matter to plead the cause of the gods.
It should be labor lost at this present, to make proof, that this great frame
of the world could not be sustained without some governor and superintendent.
That those so certain motions, and courses of the Planets and Stars, have
not this violent vehemency, by casualtie or accident, that that which is
pushed on by Fortune, and peradventure is oftentimes troubled, and hinders it
self. That this swiftness which is never interrupted by any obstacle, is
governed by the commandment of an eternal law. That this goodly order and
government, that bears and sustaineth all things in the earth, and in the
sea, so many clear lights which shine in the heavens, wherein they were
disposed, is not by the order of a wandering and inconstant matter. That that
which sho^^d be a^^embled rashly and casually, could not remain suspended,
with so wonderful workmanship. To show also how the weight of the earth
remains immovable, beholding the swift motion of the heavens, which whirleth
about her incessantly. How the seas being spread through the deep valleys,
mollify the earth, and receive no increase by the entry of all other rivers.
How from a very little seed, there grows out a body of wonderful greatness,
and how even those things which seem most uncertain and confused, I speak of
clouds and raines, of the claps of thunder and lightning, of fires and flames
that enforce their passage through the tops of the highest mountains, of the
earthquakes which sink and open the ground, and other accidents, which that
part of nature which is most stormy and tempest^ous, may move about the
earth, how sudden and unexpected soever they be, are never raised without
reason. They have their causes as well as they, which, as we see do suddenly
and miraculously break forth in some strange and unaccustomed places, such as
are the sources of hot waters in the midst of some rivers, and new Isles that
raise themselves out of the depth of a large sea. Furthermore, if a man will
observe it, how the sea-shores upon the ebb of the waters, become naked and
discovered; and how anon after, upon the flood, the waters return and cover
them again, he will believe that by a certain blind volutation, that the
waves are contracted and buried one within another, sometimes enlarged, and
with swift streams return into their bed. Although, in truth, they increase
by little and little, and at a certain day and hour become more great and
small, according to the estate and disposition of the Moon, which causes the
flux and reflux of the sea. But leave we this discourse until another time,
and the rather because thou doubtest not, but complainest of Providence. I will
reconcile thee to the gods, who are favorable to those that are good men: for
Nature suffers not, that those things which are good, should be hurtful to
the good. A Stoicall Paradox, which cannot be vnde^^^ood, nor well expressed in
the Schools of humanity, but in that of the holy Ghost. Examine it iudicially.
Virtue has contracted an amiable friendship betwixt good men and God. Say I
friendship? Nay rather a kindred, and likewise, because a good man only
differs from God but in time, he is his scholar, his follower and his true
child, whom that magnificent parent, a severe exactor of virtues, brings up
to hardness, as austere fathers do their children. When as therefore thou
shall see good men, and such as are acceptable to the gods, travail, sweat,
and ascend high places: and contrariwise, the evil play the wantons, and flow
in pleasures: think with thy self, that we are delighted with the modesty of
our children, and the liberty of our gibing slaves: that the one are
restrained under a severe discipline, whilst the other are supported and
maintained in their impudence. Know thou that God does the like. He makes not
a good man a wanton: he proves him, he hardens him against afflictions, he
polisheth and fashioneth him to the end he may serve him.

CHAP. II.
But why do many adversities befall good men? Upon the entrance of the matter,
^e proves by most strong arguments, enrich^d with excellent similitudes, and
notable examples, that afflictions are honorable, pleasant, profitable and
^ecessarie to virtuous men; and that they are no ways to be e^^eemed
pernicious.
No evil may happen unto a good man: contraries cannot be mixed together. Even
as so many rivers, so many showers pouring from the heavens, so many springs of
medicinable fountains, change not the savor of the sea, much less alter it:
so the shocke of adversity peruerteth not the courage of a virtuous man. He
continues on, and whatsoever happens, he turns it to his good. For he is
more powerful then all external things; nay more then this, he apprehends
them not, but surmounteth them, and continuing peaceable in himself, he
resists all contrary encumbrances. He accounts his adversities, his
exercises. What man is he that has his mind intended and settled upon
honesty, that is not desirous of convenient labor, and is ready voluntarily
to expose himself to dangers? What industrious man reputeth not idleness to be
a punishment? We see that wrastlers, who have a care of their strength, do
contend with the strongest whatsoever, and importue them, who fashion
themselves to those exercises, to use their uttermost forces against them: they
suffer themselves to be beaten and bruised, and if they find no single man
that may equal them, they offer themselves to encounter with many at once.
Virtue has no virtue, if it be not impugned, then appears it how great it
is, of what value and power it is, when by patience it approves what it may.
Thou ar^ to conceive that good men ought to do the like, that the greatest and
sharpest adversities must not astonish them, and that they ought not to
complain of Fa^e. Whatsoever befalls them, let them take it in good part,
and turn it to their good. It imports not what burden thou bear, but
with what courage thou endurest it. See thou not what difference there is
between the fathers love, and the mothers cockering. They command them to rise
early to follow their studies diligently, and on holy days likewise they
suffer them not to be idle, sometimes they enforce sweat from their brows,
and tears from their eyes. But their mothers nestle them in their bosoms, and
keep them out of the Sun; they never suffer them to cry, to be sad, or to
labor. God has a fatherly mind toward good men, and he loves them
strongly. And let them, says he, have labors, losses, and pains, to the end
they may recover a true strength. The bodies that are ouer-fattened do
languish in idleness, and not only too much ^ase, but also their own grease
and weight makes them sink under it. Untainted felicity can suffer no
affliction, but if a man strives continually against his own calamities: he
accustometh and inureth himself to adversities, neither gives he place to any
dolor, but although he be cast down, yet fights he on his knee. Do thou
wonder that God, who loves good men so entirely, who would that they should be
the best and most excellent above all others, does assign them fortune to
fight withal? I for mine own part wonder not, that the gods sometimes take
pleasure to behold worthy men wrestling against some adversity. Sometimes it
delights us, if we behold a young man of a constant resolution, that
encountreth a wild beast with his hunting-staffe, that dreadlesse withstandeth
the incursion of a Lion, and the more pleasing is the spectacle unto us, the
more valiantly he behaueth himself. These are not those things that may
convert the face of the gods toward us, but childish pastimes of humane
leuitie. But will thou see a spectacle that meriteth, that God should
intentiuely behold the work, fix thine eye upon it, behold a couple of
combatants worthy the presence of God? That is to say, a generous man planted
before adverse Fortune, challenging her hand to hand. I see not, say I, what
thing Jupiter has more admirable upon the earth, if he would fix his mind
upon the same, then to behold Cato remaining firm and resolute, after his
confederates had been more then once defeated and invincible amiddest his
countries ruins. Although, says he, that on^ only man be Lord of the whole
world, although he have legions and garrisons in every Province, though the
seas be covered with his ships, and Caesar's troops stop up all the passages.
Cato has a means to work his liberty, with one hand he shall make a broad
way to his liberty. This But this which Seneca pr^^seth so highly in a man
that sl^w himself, is but a Pa^ado^ of the Stoics, ^esu^ed ex^ress^ly b^
Na^^^^, by the l^w of Nation^, and condemned by the express word of God: for
it is unlawful ^or a living man to ^or^ake this prison of his body, at his
own indirect ple^sure.
sword, which during the civil wars, has remained just and innocent, shall
finally perform some good and noble actions, and give Cato liberty, who could
not give his country freedom: my soul execute thou that act which thou have
long time meditated upon; deliver thy self from these worldly businesses.
Petreius and Iuba have already encountered, and each are slain by one another
hands. A stout and worthy conuention of destiny, but such as becomes not
our greatness. It is as shameful a thing for Cato to require death, as to beg
life at any man's hands. I assure my self, that the gods with great joy beheld,
when this great and worthy personage, a powerful protector of himself,
traveled to save others, and gave them means to escape: who likewise in that
last night of his life he followed his study, whilst he thrust his The
sovereign Captain and Lord of our lines, is to assign us the day, the hou^e,
and the means. Neither i^ it the all of a generous man to lose courage, and to
think that his a^^^ires s^ands so des^^^ate, that he ^^ll so discharge
himself of busin^sse, as th^reby he pr^iudice ^is own soul, and his
ne^ghbors estate.
sword into his belly, whilst he scattered abroad his bowels, and with his
hands drew out of his body that so blessed soul of his unworthy to be
contaminated by the sword. Whereupon I am driven to believe, that the wound was
not large and deep enough. It sufficed not the immortal gods to behold Cato
once, virtue was retained, and revoked, to the end that in a greater
difficulty he might approve himself. For there is more greater resolution in
dying the second or third time, then in dying at the first. And why should they
not willingly behold their darling escaping by so noble and memorable a death,
death consecrateth those whos^ and they praise, who fear to undergo the like.

CHAP. III.
But now in the process of my discourse I will show how far they are from
miseries that are reputed so to be: Secondly, ^e proves that evil, that is to
say, affliction turns to their good who are ver^uous. The first reason is,
That as to heal the body we sometimes torment and maim the same, so does good
in regard of the rig^teous Secondly, that those that are always in
prosperity, are in worst account with God, in that they have not the courage
to encounter fortune.
for the present I tell thee that those which thou call difficulties,
adversities, and abominable are first of all for the good of those to whom
they happen, and afterward for other men's good of whom the gods have more care
then of every one in particular. Secondly, that nothing befalls good men but
that which they would, and they should discern that evil should light upon
them if they would not. Hereunto will I annex, that these things are done by
Fate, and in as much as virtuous men are good, all that which befortuneth them
is good: consequently I will teach thee, and make thee confess that thou
ought never to say, I have pity of such a good man, for a man may term
him miserable, but indeed he is not nor cannot be. That which I spoke first
seems to be the most harshest of all that which I have propounded, that those
evils which we quake and tremble at, turn to their good, to whom they happen.
Is it for their good, say thou, to be banished, to be brought to poverty,
to be deprived of their wives and children, and to be enforced to bury them,
to be defamed, and weakened? If thou be astonished heereat, thou will wonder
more if I approve it to be for their good, that some are cured by Iron and
Fire, and by hunger and thirst likewise; but if thou bethink thy self that
for remidie sake, some have their bones scaled and scarified, their veins
tataken out, and some of their members cut off, which without the hazard of the
whole body could not be left on, thou will suffer this likewise to be proved,
that some incommodities are for their good to whom they happen, as much in truth
as there are some things which being praised and desired are hurtful to those
that long after them, as ouer-eating and drinking, and such like pleasures,
which engender crudities, trouble the brain, and kill the body. Amongst
diverse notable sayings of Demetrius the Stoicke, I remember me of one, which as
yet sounds and tingleth in mine ears; There is nothing, says he, more
unhappy then that man that has never been touched with adversity: for he
has not had the means to know himself. Although all things he could desire
had befalne him, yea, before he could desire; yet have the gods thought evil
of him. He seemed to be unworthy that fortune should at any time be overcome
by him which disdaineth to attempt any recreant or coward: as if she said, Why
should I admit of such an adversary? he will presently lay down his weapons,
what need I employ all my power against him? A slight threat will make him
fly; he cannot abide to look upon me. Let another man be sought for, with
whom I may enter combat. I am ashamed to encounter with a man that is ready to
be conquered. The Fencer thinks it a disgrace for him to be matched with his
inferior, and knows that he is overcome without glory that is conquered
without danger. The like does fortune, she seeks for the strongest to match
her, some passes she over with a scorn, she attempteth the most confident and
courageous sort of men, against these employeth she her forces: she tries her
fire upon See Liuie and Plutarch in the life of Publicola.
Mucius, poverty in See Plutarch in Pyr^hus life, and Titus Liuius.
Fabricius, banishment in See the Epitome of Titus Liuius. lib. 70. and
Valerius Maximus. lib. 2 cap. 10.
Rutilius, torments in Regulus, poison in Socrates, death in Cato. Evil
fortune seeks out no man except he be a great one. Is Mu^ius unhappy because
with his right hand he grasped his enemies ^ire, and chastised^ the error he
committed by burning of his hand, for putting that enemy to flight by his
scorched fist, whom with his armed hand he could not vanquish? What then should
he have been more happy, had he warmed his hand in his Misteresse bosom? Is
Fabricius unhappy for digging up his Garden, at such time as he had no
public charge? for waging war as well against riches as against Pyrrhus?
for supping by the fire upon those roots and herbs which he himself being
an old man, who had triumphantly entered Rome, had gathered in clensing and
weeding his garden? What then, should he have been more happy if he had
filled his belly with fishes, fetched from a far and foreign shore, and of
fowls fetched from a strange country? If he had whetted the dullness of his
loathing ^tomacke with shellfish, fetched from the higher and lower Seas? If
he had environed with a great heap of apples the most hugest savage beast,
which cost many men their lives before she was killed. Is Rutilius unhappy,
because they that have condemned him shall be condemned in all ages, who more
willingly suffered himself to be ravished from his country, then to be
remitted of his exile? because he alone opposed himself against the Dictator
Scilla, and when he was recalled, not only kept back but sled farther off?
Let they, says he to Scilla, whom thy great fortune entangleth in Rome, think
this, that they behold a river of blood in the Marketplace, and above the
Lake of Seruilius (for that was the place where they dispoyled those whom
Scilla by public Proclamations had condemned to die) the heads of Senators,
and the troops of Murderers, running through the streets of the City, and
diverse thousands of Roman Citizens, murdered in that place after thou have
shopt them up, with promise to save their lives, and notwithstanding
traitorously causing them to be slain; let those that cannot endure to be
banished feed their eyes with such spectacles. What then, is Lucius Scilla
happy, because that in coming down to the Marketplace his guard made him way
with their weapons? because he suffered the heads of Consuls to be hanged up,
Titus Liuius, Publius, Valeriu^, Max^mus, and Cicero do all of them make
h^norable mention of this man, to whose magna^imitie Seneca opposed M^^aenas
delicacie.
and makes the Quaestor pay him the price of every head which is taxed in his
Proclamations; and all these things does he that made the Law Cornelia. Let us
come to Regulus; what harm did fortune to him in making him the pattern of
fidelity and patience? The nails fasten and pierce his skin, and on what side
soever he turns his wearied body, he lies upon his wounds; neither can he
close his eyes, but watches incessantly. The more torment he has, the more
glory shall be his. Will thou know how far off he is from repenting
himself for estimating virtue at so high a rate? Cheer him up, and send him
back again to the Senate, he will be still of the same opinion. Think thou
therefore that Mecaenas is more happy, who could not sleep but by the
harmony of pleasing music that sounded a far off by reason of his
jealousy, and because he was strangely tormented with the crosses of his
fantastique wife, which upon every slight occasion threatened him with divorce.
Although he drown himself in wine to make him drowsy, and by the noise of
water, poured out of one basin into another entice his eyes to sleep: be it
that he charm his sorrows with a thousand pastimes, he shall sleep as little
on his feather-bed as Regulus on the gibbet. But the one comforted himself,
because he suffered for honesty that affliction he endured, and his patience
regarded the cause of those torments. The other spent in delights, and broken
with too much ease, is more tormented with the occasion then the evil it
self, which he endures; vices have not gotten so strong a possession of
mortal men, that it is to be doubted, if so be the destiny would give them
their choice whether diverse had not rather resemble Regulus, then be borne
Mecaenas. Or if there were any that durst say that he would be borne Mecaenas
and not Regulus; the same man, although he hold his peace, had rather be borne
This was Mecaenas fantas^icall and troublesome wise.
Terentia. Think thou that Socrates was badly handled because he drunk that
potion which was publicly mixed, no otherwise then if it had been a medicine
of immortality, and disputed of death till death seized him? Think thou
that he was ill dealt withal, because his blood was congealed, and that by
little and little the force of his veins failed him? whilst cold in the
extremity stole up to his heart by little and little: how much more rather
ought we to envy his felicity, then those who are served in precious stones,
wherein an old and decayed Minion of his trimmed up to endure all things,
pours up from above the melted Snow into his golden cup. These men whatsoever
they drink they vomit and cast it up again, with a certain loathing, and are
constrained to retast their bitter spittle. But Socrates swalloweth the poison
voluntarily and joyfully. As touching Cato, there is sufficiently spoken, and
the whole consent of men will confess that he attained the greatest felicity
whom God made choice of, to rush and conquer those things that were to be
feared. Are the displeasures of great men grievous? Oppose him alone to Pompey,
Caesar and Crassus. It is a grievous thing to be outstripped by men of no worth
in dignity and honor, but Cato disdaineth not to come after Vatinius. It is a
grievous thing to be an actor in civil wars; but Cato in a just quarrel
will fight in every corner of the world, although the issue be both strange and
miserable. It is a grievous matter for a man to murder himself, yet will he
do it. What shall I, says nature, get hereby? This; that all men may know that
these are not evils, which I thought Cato worthy of.

and betideth those of weakest spirit: but to yoke and master calamities and
mortal terrors is the property of a great man. But to be always happy, and
to pass away life without any pressure of the mind, is to be ignorant that
affliction is one part of man's life. Thou art a great man; but how shall I know
it, if fortune give thee not leave and means to make proof of thy virtue.
Thou wentest to the Olympian games, but no man but thy selfe^ thou have the
crown, but not the victory. I applaude not thy fortune as if thou were a
great and valiant man, but as if thou had gotten some Consulate or
Praetorship. Thou art increased in honor. The like can I say to a good man; if
some misfortune has not given him any occasion, whereby to make show of the
lively forces of his mind. I repute thee wretched because thou were never
wretched, thou have past thy life without an adversary. No man, no not thy
self shall be able to know thy value: for to the end a man may well know
himself, he ought to make proof of himself. No man knows his own ability
except he make trial thereof. And therefore some men have wilfully and
unprovoked exposed themselves to miseries, and sought an occasion to make their
virtue already declining and growing to obscurity, more glorious and esteemed.
Great men, say I, do rejoice as much in adversities as valiant soldiers do
in war. I heard a Fencer in C^ius Caesar's time, complain of the rareness of
rewards: How fair an age, says he, is past; virtue gapeth after danger, and
thinks on that which she intends, not that which she is to suffer, because
that which she is to suffer is a part of her glory. Valiant soldiers glory
in their wounds, and joyfully show the blood that runs from them, i^ it be
spent in a good cause. Although they do the like who return in safety from
the battle, yet is he more respected that returns wounded. God, say I, has a
care of those men whom he desires to make the most honest, as often as he
gives them an occasion to do any thing stoutly and manfully, to the
performance whereof there needs some difficulty and danger. Thou shall know
a Master of a Ship in a tempest, and a Soldier in the battle: how can I know
how thou art addressed against poverty, if thou aboundest in riches? How can I
know what constancy thou have against ignominy, infamy, and popular hate, if
thou grow old amidst the applauses of every man; if an inexpugnable favor
seconded by a certain inclination of men's minds toward thee, attends thee
perpetually? Whence know I that thou will patiently endure the loss of thy
children, if I see thee laugh when they come into the world? I have heard thee
comfort others, but then would I willingly have seen thee, if thou have
comforted thy self, if thou have commanded thy self to grieve no more. Fear
not these things, I beseech you, which the immortal gods use as spurs to
quicken and awaken our minds. Calamity is an occasion of virtue. Justly may a
man term them miserable, that are surfetted with too much felicity, who are
detained in an idle tranquillity, as a ship in a calm sea, whatsoever shall
befall them will be new unto them. Calamities press them most shrewdly, that
have never had experience of them. A tender neck hardly brooketh the yoke. A
young soldier waxes pale upon the fear of a wound. An old beaten soldier
does boldly see himself bleed, who knows that oft-times in losing his blood
he has conquered his enemy. God therefore animateth, reknowledgeth, and
exercises those whom he approves and loves: but those whom he seems to
favor and spare, he reserueth them by reason of their weakness, for the evils
to come, for it is a folly to think that any one is exempt. He whom thou
think so assured in his happiness, shall have his turn, and taste the same
cup; whosoever seems dismissed, is but deferred. Why does God afflict the
best men with sickness, The reason why God a^^l^cteth good m^n.
and other incommodities? Why in the Camp are the soldiers of greatest value,
commanded to execute the exploits of greatest danger? The General sends out
the most chosen troops to charge the enemy with an onslaught by night, either
to skout the way, or to drive some forces from their trenches. None of those
who sally out says, The General has done me wrong, but he has honored me.
Let them say the like, whosoever are commanded to suffer, for which fearful
men and cowards weep. We have been thought worthy by God to be esteemed such,
in whom he might make trial, how much humane nature may suffer. Fly
delights, fly from effeminate felicity, whereby our minds are mollified,
except something happen that may admonish them of their humane condition, who
are, as it were benumbed with perpetual drunkenness. A perpetual felicity,
(...) a^^^nded by a ^^daine misfortune.
He that has been always defended from the wind by his glasse-windowes,
whose feet are kept warm by much wrapping, who suppeth not, except it be in
his stoue, is not without danger of catching cold upon the smallest breath of
wind. Since all excess is hurtful, an unmeasurable prosperity is most
dangerous: It moves the brain, distracteth the mind with vain resemblances,
and spreads many mists betwixt truth and falsehood. Why should it not be
better to endure perpetual infelicitie, which animateth unto virtue, then to
be broken with infinite and immoderate prosperity? Death is not so tedious as
too long fasting, and with too much cruditie they crack their bodies. The gods
therefore behave themselves toward good men, as the masters do t^wards their
scholars, who require more labor at their hands, of whom they have the
greatest hope. Belieuest thou that the Lacedaemonians hated their children, who
make trial of their disposition and nature, by whipping them publicly?
Contrariwise, those fathers exhort their children to suffer the iercks of their
whips confidently, and entreat them, being torn and half dead with their
scourgings, to persevere, and to endure wounds upon wounds. Wonder we that God
makes trial of the most generous spirits by adversity? Virtuous instructions
are never delicate. Does Fortune beat and rent us? Let us suffer it. This is
no cruelty, it is but a conflict. The more we adventure it, the stronger shall
we be. The hardest part of our body is that which trauaileth most: we must
offer our selves to the hands of Fortune, to the end she may make us more
confident to encounter her. By little and little she will make us as strong as
her self. To be continually in danger, makes a man set light by danger. So
are Sailers bodies inured to brook the sea; so are husbandmens hands hardened;
so are sould^ers arms strengthened to dart their weapons, so are their members
made nimble that run races. Exercise makes dangers slight,
That in every thing is most strongest, which is most exercised. By contemning
the power of evils, the mind attaineth patience, which thou shall know what it
can effect in us, if thou consider how much labor effects in naked bodies,
and such as are strengthened by necessitie^ Consider all Nations which are
beyond the confines of the Roman Empire. I mean the Germans, and all those
that dwell about Ister, and those wandering Nations of the Scythians, and other
perpetual winter, and a thick air continually presses them; a barren soil
sustaineth them: they defend themselves from showers, with leaves and sheddes
of thatch, they travel over rivers hardened with ice, and take the repast upon
the flesh of wild beasts. Seem they wretched unto thee? Nothing is miserable
that Nature has brought into a custom, for by little and little those things
become pleasant unto them, which began upon necessity. They have no houses,
they have no biding place, but that which weariness has allotted them for a
season. Their meat is homely and gotten by their own hands: the air is
extremely cold, and their bodies are naked; this which seems calamity unto
thee, is the life of so many Nations. Why wondrest thou that good men are
shaken, to the end they may be confirmed? The last proof enriched with an
excellent similitude.
There is no solid or s^rong tree, that has not been often shaken by the
wind, for by the often shaking thereof it is strengthened, and fateneth his
root more assuredly. They that grow in the low valleys are the weakest. It is
therefore profitable for good men, to make them more assured to be always
conversant amongst dangers, and to endure those accidents with a constant
mind, which are not evils, except to him that bears them euilly.

CHAP. V.
For the ^ourth prin^ipall consideration, h^e shows that the virtuous are
afflicted, f^r the good and instruction of all men.
LEt us add now, how for the good of all men, every one of the better sort (if
I may so speak it) bear arms and perform actions. This is the purpose of
God to make it known unto a wise man, that those things which the common
people long after, and which they are afraid of, are neither good nor evil.
And they shall appear to be good: if he bestow them on none but good men, and
to be ^uill, if he has reserved them only for evil men. Blindness were
detestable, if no man should lose his eyes except they were pulled out. Let
therefore The one of these by ^irname was called blind, and ^h^ other lost his
eyes by ^ire.
Appius and Metellus want their sight, and be miserable herein. Riches are not
the true good, and therefore let Ellius the baud enjoy them in such sort, as
they who have given him money in the Temples, may see it in the Brothel-house.
God can by no better means traduce those things, which we so much covet, then
in bestowing them on men most infamous, and detayning them from men most
virtuous. But it is an iniust thing, that a good man should be weakened, hanged
up, or imprisoned, and that evil men should walk, with whole, healthful, and
effeminate bodies. What then? Is it not an unreasonable matter, that valiant
men should take arms, should watch in the trenches, and having their wounds
but newly bound up, should maintain the breach, whilst lascivious men, and
such as profess wanton lust, sleep securely in the City? What then? Is it
not a most shameful matter, that the most noblest Virgins should be awakened
at midnight to celebrate the sacred ceremonies, and that harlets should enjoy
their quiet sleeps? Labor summoneth the best. The Senate oft-times is all day
long in counsel, when at that time the basest companions whatsoever, either
take their pastimes in the fields, or lie hidden in an Alehouse, or lose their
time in chatting amongst their companions. The like is done in this great
Commonweal of the world, good men must labor, they employ their time, and
are e^ployed by others, and are not enforcedly drawn by Fortune, but they
follow her, and walk by her, step by step, and had they known it, they had
out^^ript her. And I remember likewise, that I have heard this manly speech of
Demetrius that worthy fellow: In this one thing, O immortal gods, I can
complain of you, that you have not made known unto me what your will was. For
of my self I had first of all come unto these things, to which being now
called, I present my self. Will you take my children from me? I have brought
them up to that end. Will you have a part of my body? Take it to you. I
promise no great matter, I will suddenly leave all. Will you have my spirit?
Why not? I will not defer to restore that unto you, which you have bestowed
upon me. I will willingly satisfy whatsoever you request. A (...) of (...)
St^^k^s ^ou^^^ng (...) Reader (...) to S Augustine in (...) De C^^^tate (...),
and fifth Chapter, and other^ that (...) written after (...).
What is it then? I had rather present it you then deliver it unto you. What
need had you to take away the same, you might have commanded it, neither now
shall you take it away, because nothing is taken away, but that which is taken
from him that detaineth the same. I am not compelled, I suffer nothing
unwillingly; neither do I serve God but assent unto him, and so much the
rather, because I know that all things h^ppen by an eternal and unchangeable
ordinance of God. Destiny leads us, and the first honor of every man's birth
has governed all the rest of his life. One cause depends upon another, and
the long order of things draws with it all that which is done in public or
in private. Therefore is each thing to be endured constantly, because all
things fall not out as we That is, things happen not by chance, but are made
and ^ome by an immutable decree.
imagine, but come. Long since it was decreed, whereat thou should joy or
sorrow, and although every man's life seems to be distinguished in different
and great variety, yet notwithstanding all comes to one point, we have
received those things which will decay, and we our selves must die. Why are we
so displeased? Whence grows our complaint? We are ordained hereunto. Let
Nature use our bodies how she list. Let us merrily and constantly think thus,
that we lose nothing of our own. To answer this object on, be relieth on the
Paradox of the Stoickes, who tie the first cause which is God, to secondarie
causes, whereas Christian Philosophy teaches us the contrary, and himself
hereafter^ has sufficiently answered hereunto.
What is that which is proper and bes^eming in a good man? to commit himself
to the hands of Destiny. It is a great solace to be carried away with the
whole world. Whatsoever it be that has commanded us to live thus, and to die
thus, by the same necessity tieth the gods. An irreuocable course carries
away together both humane and divine things. The same Creator and Governor of
all things has written the Fates, and he himself follows that which he has
written, he has once commanded, and always obeys. Why therefore was God so
unjust in distributing Fate, that to good men he ascribed poverty, wounds, and
cruel death? The work-master cannot change his matter, it is subject to suffer
this Some things there are that cannot be separated from other things, they
cleave one unto another, and are indivisible. The spirits that are weak, or
like to grow dull, or to fall into a watch fullness like unto sleep, are
framed of slow elements. To frame a man that should make himself spoken of
there needs a stronger Fate. His journey must be no ordinar^e way. He must
travel high and low, he must have storms, and must govern his ship in a
swollen sea; he must shape his course against Fortune. He shall have many hard
and dangerous accidents to confront him, but such as he himself may smooth and
make plain. Fire tries gold, and adversity valiant men. Behold how high
virtue should ascend, and thou shall know that she must not go in security.
The first which with unwearied steeds I clime,
Is such a journey, that their ceaselesse toil
Can scarcely reach before the morrowes prime,
The next is highest heaven, from whence the soil
And spacious seas, I see with dreadful eye
And fearful heart, the next whereto I hie,
Is steep, and pro^e, and craves a cunning guide,
An^ then does THETIS shake her self for dread,
Lest headlong I should fall and downward glide,
And bury in her waves my golden head.
When the generous young man had heard these things, I like, says he, the way,
and will attempt it. Is it such a matter to shape so fair a course, and to
fall afterward? The father notwithstanding desisted not to terrify his too
forward mind thus: And that thou may continue in the way,
Be carefullest thy posting Steeds do stray,
Yet shall thou pass by Taurus who will bend
His horns to cross thee, whither thou do tend,
The AEnomian Archer, and the Lion sell
Shall stay thy course, and fright thee where they dwell.
After this he says, Coople thy granted team^. I am animated by these things,
wherewith thou think to affright me. I am resolved to stand there, where the
Sun it self shall tremble. It is the part of a base and recreant mind to
travel in securitie^ Virtue always climeth hard and difficult paths.

CHAP. VI.
The fist and principal point, wherein he sh^weth that there is no evil but
in vice^ Whence it felloweth that the vi^tuous endure no evil, and that this
name ought not be given to afflictions.
But why does God permit that good men should suffer wrong? Undoubtedly he
permits it not. He remoueth all evils from them, heinous sins and
offenses, cursed cogitations, greedy cousels, blind lusts, and avarice that
coueteth another man's fortunes, he defends and restrains them. Does any man
require this at Gods hands, that he should take pain also to keep good men's
budgets. They acquit God of this care, they contemn external things.
Democrates cast away riches, supposing them to be the burden of a good mind.
Why wonderest thou therefore, if God suffer that to happen to a wiseman, that
a good man sometimes would wish, that he might sometimes light upon. Good men
lose their children. Why not? When as the time will come that they themselves
must die. They are banished: Why not? When as sometime they forsake their
Country, with this resolution never to see it again. They are slain: Why
not? when as sometimes they themselves will lay hands on themselves. Why suffer
they some adversities? to the end they may teach others to suffer the like.
They are borne to be a pattern. Think therefore that God says: What cause
have you, who have taken pleasure in virtue, to complain of me. I have
environed some with deceivable goods, and have mocked their vain minds with
a long and deceitful dream. I have decked them with gold, silver and Iuorie,
but inwardly there is nothing good in them. These whom you admire for their
happiness, if you look into them, not according to their exterior
greatness, but their interior weakness, they are miserable, base, silthie,
and like their walls, only painted on the outside. This is no solid and
sincere felicity, it is but a crust, and that a thin one. Therefore as long
as they may stand upright, and not show themselves but where they list: they
shine and abuse the common eye. But if any thing happens, that troubles and
discovers them, then shall thou see a sea of villainy and filth hidden under
their borrowed brightness. I have given you true and permanent goods. The more
you examine and look into them every ways, the better and the more greater
will they appear to be. I have permitted you to contemn those things which
are to be feared, to loath those things that are to be desired, you shall not
shine outwardly, Again, he returns to his Paradox, tying God unto secondarie
causes.
your goods are turned inward. So the world contemns his exterior parts, and
contenteth himself with the contemplation of himself. I have placed all good
inwardly. It is your felicity, not to want felicity. But diverse pitiful,
dreadful, and intolerable things fall out. Because I could not deliver you
from these evils, I have armed your minds against all things. Suffer manfully,
this is the way whereby you may walk before God, he is without the patience of
evil you above the patience. Contemn poverty, no man lives so poor as he
was borne. Contemn pain, it will either b^ ended, or end us. Contemn
Fortune, I have given her no weapon to wound the mind. Contemn death, which
either ends you or transferreth you^ Another Paradox, placing death in the
po^er and will of a man, whereas man ought to attend the same from the
ordinance of God: Esteem this as an Eth^ique error, gather the flowers, let
the weeds pass.
Above all things I have given you, warning that no man should keep you living
against your will. If you will not fight you may fly; therefore of all things
which I would have necessary for yo^^ I made nothing more cas^e then death^ I
have planted the soul in a bale place, whence a man may deliver it: consider
now and you shall see how short the way is unto liberty, and how ready it is.
I have not prefixed you so long a way in your departure as I have given you at
your entrance, otherwise fortune had held a great dominion over you, if a man
should die as slowly as he is born. Let every time and place teach you how
easy a thing it is to renounce nature, and to return her that favor she has
bestowed upon you: learn you death amidst the Altars, and the solemn rites of
those that sacrifice whilst life is wished for. The bodies of the fattest Bulls
are slain with a small wound, and the stroke of a man's hand murthereth the
beasts of the greatest strength. The joint that joins the ne^ke to the head
is divided with a thin Knife, and when the nerves that tie them both together
are cu^, that great mass of the body ^^lleth down. Death is easy indeed,
but ad^isedly add hereunto, if it happen in such sort, and at such time as
pleases God.
The spirit is not hidden ouer^deepe, neither need we to draw it out with
hooks: we need not inflict deep wounds in our entrails, death is at hand. I
have destinated no certain place for these strokes: life may find (...) by
any place whatsoever. Even that which is called death, whereby the soul
departs from the body, is shorter then that so great swiftness thereof may
be sensible. Whether a man strangleth himself, or stop his breath by drowning
himself, whether by falling on the ground^ a man's head being forward, we beat
out our brains, whether by swallowing down quick coals of fire, you
intercept the course of the departing soul, whatsoever it be it hasteneth.
What do you blush, why fear you that so long which is done so soon?

The end of the Book of Providence.
A TREATISE OF ANGER, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO HIS FRIEND NOVA^VS.
THE FIRST BOOK.
The Argument of IVS^VS LIPSIVS.
THe Books of Anger seem to be written amongst the first Books of Philosophy
undoubtedly amongst those which we have: we gather the same out of SENECAES
own words in his third Book and eighteenth chapter. At this time CAIUS CAESAR
caused SEXTVS PAPINIVS whose father was Consul, and BELENIVS BASSVS who was
Thresurer, to be whipped. He says at this time, even now but newly done, nay
more, whilst CALIGVLA himself was living, out of the Chapter following. That
which thou s^ much admirest was usual and ordinary with this beast, he lives
for this, he watches for this, he studieth for this; undoubtedly all these
thing were spoken by a man that is, not that was. He wrote at that time
therefore, but he published it not, the more his wisdom, although as I
suppose he did it shortly after his death.

The Argument is as the title testifies; How to know Anger, and afterward to
eschew it. The first Book therefore has the description thereof, and the
loathsome habit and face of such as are angry: then certain definitions:
then questions whether man only be subject thereunto? He maintains it:
Whether it be according to nature? He ^enieth it with the Stoics. Whether it
be profitable, especially if it be tempered? This likewise denies he, and
diversely disput^th against the Peripatetiques: that neither the mind nor the
strength is whetted thereby. That we ought not to be angry, no not with those
that are evil; neither at the death of our father, nor at the rauishing of our
mother, yet that they are to be defended and revenged. To conclude, that this
is a sign, not of a great but of a weak mind. The Books art in part very
excellent and eminent in the whole, scarce distinct but confused in repetitions
and digestions.

CHAP. I.
THOU have exacted of me, No^atus was (...) ^^allus (...) ^on.
Nouatus, to write unto thee how wrath might be pacified, neither without
cause seem thou unto me to have feared this affection especially, which is
the most cruel and enraged of all others: for in the rest there is somewhat
that is pliant and pleasing, but this is always violent and full of immoderate
sorrow, of arms, of blood, of punishments, incensed with more then humane
desire, neglecting her self so she may hurt another, rushing in upon the
sharpest weapons, and greedy of revenge, and complotting murders. Some
therefore of the wiser sort have said that He (...) in th^^ (...) ^^^ly (...)
to Th^^ist^us.
Anger is a short madness, for she is as little Mistress of her self as the
other: she forgets all respect, neglects friendships, intent and obstinate
in that she has undertaken, and neglectfull of reason, and incapable of
counsel: she is transported by vain pretexts, stupid in the presence of
equity and verity, properly resembling the ruins of houses, which break
themselves upon that ruin which they themselves have beaten down. And to the
end thou may know that they who are surprised with Anger are truly mad,
consider a little their countenance, and the manner of their behavior. For
even as these are certain signs of confirmed madness, to have a bold and
threatening countenance, a heavy brow, and dreadful face, a swift and
disordered gate, unquiet hands, changed color, and frequent and deep sighs:
so those that are angry have the same signs. Their eyes sparkle and shine,
their face is on fire through a re^^uxe of blood that boileth up from the bottom
of their breasts, their lips quiver, their teeth grate, their hair startleth
and stands upright, their breath is enforced and wheeseth, they wrest and
crack their fingers, their speech is interrupted with plaints and groans and
muttering, which a man may hardly understand. They often clap their hands, and
stamp the ground with their feet; their whole body startleth, and is shaken,
their actions are full of furious menaces. In brief, they have a dreadful and
horrible countenance, resembling such men that disfigure and puff themselves
up after a strange fashion. Thou can not say whether it be a more detestable
or deformed vice: the rest we may hide and nourish in secret; Anger discovers
it self and appears in the countenance, and the greater it is, the more
manifestly discovers she her impatience. See thou not in brute beasts
whatsoever, that as soon as they are addressed to hurt, there are certain
signs as forerunners of their intention; how all their bodies give over their
peaceable and accustomed habit, and how they exasperate their natural
fiercenes? The Boares some and gnash their teeth: the horns of Bulls are
tossed in the air, and by the trampling of their feet the sand is scattered:
the Lions roar, the incensed Serpents have swelling necks, mad Dogs have a
dreafull look. There is no living creature so cruel and pernicious whatsoever,
that discovers not some new fury, as soon as displeasure has seized him;
neither am I ignorant that other affections also are scarcely hidden, and that
lust^ fear, and boldness make show of themselves, and may be foreknowne. For
there is none so vehement and inward thought, that bewrays not it self in
the countenance. What difference then is there, that other affections do
appear, and this is eminent?

CHAP. II.
But now if thou will consider the effects and damages thereof there is no
plague that has ruined and cost the world more then this. That Ch^l^r and
Anger is ^urthful lo^s, be approves by example, and by the e^^^cts and
discommodities thereof, se^^ing Syllac^ cruel^es, and the Triliui^ates tyranie
for an example of hatred thereof ^o all men.
Thou shall see murders, imprisonments, shameful and mutual reproaches of
guilty men, sacking of Cities, ruins of whole nations, heads of Princes and
great Lords taxed and sold to him that offers most, houses burned, and fire
not restrained within the walls of a City, but whole spaces of Regions
shining with hostile flame. Behold the foundations of the noblest Cities, now
scarcely known, these has wrath ouerturned. Behold the desert and uninhabited,
extended to many thousand paces, these has wrath dispoyled. Behold so many
great Chieftaines, whose memory remains as yet serving for examples of
humane misery. One of these has wrath murdered in his bed, another has
wrath slain at the table, without any respect of the sacred rites of the same,
another has she stabbed in the midst of the lanes, and in the marketplace in
the sight of all men: she has commanded another to offer his throat to the
murtherous hands of his son; another to have his Kingly throat cut by the
sword of his slave, another to have his members di^^ended upon the gibbet. And
as yet have I but reckoned up some particular men's punishments. But if thou
please (pretermitting those whom Anger has thus massacred man by man) to
behold whole Armies put to the sword, the people of a City murdered by
soldiers, expressly sent to that purpose, and whole Nations exterminated
without sparing great or small, as if the gods cared not for us, or they
contemned their authority. But as touching the Fencers, why is it that the
people are so iniustly incensed against them, that they repute it to be an
injury done unto them, if the sword-players kill not one another speedily,
showing by their countenances, gestures, and heat, that they suppose
themselves to be neglected, making themselves by this means of spectators
merciless enemies. Whatsoever it be this is not wrath, but a passion
resembling wrath, such as is that of children, who if they have fallen will have
the earth beaten, and oft-times they know not with whom they are angry, yet
are they only angry without cause and without injury, and yet not without
some appeareance of injury, nor without some desire of revenge. They are
deluded therefore with counterfeit beatings of the earth, and are pacified by
the feined tears of those that would still them, and by a counterfeit form of
revenge their feined sorrow is extinguished.

CHAP. III.
We are oftentimes displeased (says he) not with those that have hurt us, but
with those who hereafter are like to hurt vs^ to the end thou may know that
Anger proceeds not only from an injury already done. True it is, that we
are angry with those that should hurt us, but those that harm us in their very
thought, and he that is to do us an injury, has already done it. To the end
thou may know (says he) that wrath is not a desire of revenge, oft-times the
weakest are displeased with the strongest. Neither wish they for revenge, which
they hope not to see. We have formerly said that wrath was a desire, and not a
power to revenge; but men desire such things as they cannot effect.
Furthermore, no man is so humble and base, who cannot hope to see justice done
upon his greatest adversary: 1^ de Anima. cap. 1.
we have power enough to hurt: Aristotle's definition differs not very much
from ours; for he says, That wrath is a desire to displease those that have
displeased us. It were a long matter to discourse what difference there is
betwixt this definition and ours: against both it is said that beasts are
incensed, yet are they not provoked by any injury, neither desire they the
punishment or pain of any other beast: for although they revenge themselves,
yet is it not with a desire of vengeance. But we must answer, that wild
beasts, and all other creatures, except man only, do want Anger. For whereas
it is opposite to reason, yet does it never grow in any one, but such in whom
reason has place. Brute beasts have their assaults, their rage, their
fierceness and incursion, yet have they Anger no more then lechery, and in
some pleasures they are more intemperate then man is. Thou must not give credit
to him that says: The Boar remembers not his wrathful ire,
The Hind does scarcely trust her swift retire.
Nor Bears to pray upon the mighty h^ardes.
By this word anger, he intends emotion, or incitation. They know no more to
be angry, then how to pardon. Dumb beasts want humane affections, but they
have certain impulsions which resemble the same. Otherwise if love were in
them, hatred should be in them also: if friendship, enmity: if discention,
concord: whereof some marks do appear in them. But good and evil are only
proper to the hearts of men. Wisdom, diligence, and cogitation, are only
granted to a man, and brute beast^s are not only not partakers of humane
virtues but are also exempted from their vices. All them, form both exterium
and interium is unlike unto man's. Their understanding is gross and imperfect,
their voice strange, confused, and without any signification, their tongue is
tied, and has no diversities of sounds, neither can it distinctly speak and
pronounce. The beast then receives the object of that which she sees, and
the kinds of all things that incite her unto fury, but she receives them
troubled and confused. Thence comes their springings and vehement assaults,
which may not be called either fears, or cares, or sadness, or displeasures,
but some things like unto these. Therefore is it that they are quickly appeased
and are changed into a contrary estate, and after they have most inragedly
executed there cru^ltie, they return unto their pasture and fodder, and after
a neighing and furious course, they seek out to their rest and sleep.

CHAP. IIII.
WE have sufficiently declared what anger is, and wherein it differs from an
inclination to be carried in such sort, as a drunkard differs from
drunkenness, and a man that is afraid from a coward. A man may be angry;
although he be not ordinarily inclined and subject to be angry, he that is
subject to displeasure, cannot choose but sometimes he must be subject to
choler. As touching the other kinds of choler, which the Graecians express
by diverse other names, I let them pass because we have no proper words to
express them, although that we say that that which is sour is bitter, that
he that is excessiuely bent to indignation is mad, that he that is cl^morous
is hard to be reconciled and fierce, all which are differences of wrath,
Differences of Anger.
amongst th^se may we put froward, which is a delicate kind of choler. For
there are some displeasures which are appeased with crying, some that are
ordinary and no less obstinate, some sparing in words and violent in
execution, some that discover their bitterness in the multitude of words and
curses, some pass not further, then plaints and reproaches, some others are
profound and weighty, and are fixed deeply in the thought. There are a
thousand sorts of evils in this evil, which are so diverse, and spread into so
many branches.

CHAP. V.
Whether Anger be a thing na^urall, profitable, and to be rec^iued.
WE have examined what wrath is, and whether it might seize any other Creature
then a man, wherein it differed from displeasure and of the kinds of the same.
Let us now enquire whether wrath be according to nature, whether it be
profitable, and whether in any sort we ought to restrain the same. It will
manifestly appear whether it be according to nature if we consider a man,
for there is nothing so peaceable, and governed as he is, as long as his mind
is governed and paci^ied: but what is more cruel then anger? what Creature, is
more loving toward his like then man is? what is more hateful then wrath? A It
is not natural.
man is borne to h^lpe other, wrath for the general ruin of all. A man
desir^th nothing more then company, wrath s^archeth solitude, the one will
assist, the other will hurt, this desires to show himself kind, though it be
but to strangers, the other to endang^r her familiars. A man is ready to
hazard his own life to secure another. Wrath is ready to hazard danger,
provided, she may hazard some other with her self. Who therefore is more
ignorant, of the nature of things, then he that to her best and commendablest
works assigns this so savage and pernicious a vice? Wrath as we said is
greedy of vengeance, and that desire of revenge should be in the most
peaceable heart of a man, is a thing which is not consonant to his nature. For
humane life consists upon benefits and concord, it is not then by threat^s
but by mutual amity that men are allied and ti^d to assist one an other. What
then? Is not Chastisement sometimes necessary? Why not? but this must be
sincere and with reason. For it hurts not but heals under a resemblance of
hurting. Even as to straighten the steals of our Iavelings, which are wax^n
crooked, we burn them and plie them in a vice of Iron or Wood, not to the
intent to break them, but make them more even and straight: so correct we our
wits being depraved with vice, with the pain both of body and mind. An
excellent Similitude.
And in like sort, as the Physician, having some light infirmities in cure
assaieth: First, to change some little of the ordinary custom of the sick to
prescribe his diet, his drink, his exercises, and to confirm his health by
the only changes of the order of his life. Secondly, he indeuoureth to bring
this to pass that this means may profit, and if it happen other ways he
diminishes and cutteth of some things; and if this be not enough he
forbids the sick-man all meats, and rectifieth his body by enioyning him
abstinence: and if these gentle remedies have effected nothing, he opens a
vain and if any members be harmeful one unto an other that cleave unto the
same, and spread their evil through the body he deuideth them, and there is no
cure that the sick-man supposes gri^uous, if the effect of the same bring him
health: In like sort it behooves the Magistrate, The cure of the Ma^estrate,
prop^^ly applied to ^h^t of the Phisi^ion.
who is the conseruer and maintainer of the Law to heal men's minds, by
gentle words and persuasions as much as in him lies, persuading his subjects
to do that which is commanded them, and imprinting in their thoughts the love
of justice and honesty; in brief proposing for the reward of virtue he hatred
of vice: afterward he ought to use sharper words contenting himself as yet
to advertise and threaten. Finally, he must have reourse to punishments, and
yet such as are light and revocable. The uttermost punishments shall be
inflicted for the greatest faults: to the and that no man may perish except it
be he that is put to death, and for whom it is expedient to die.

CHAP. VI.
THere is this difference betwixt the Maiestrate and the Physician, The
difference be^wixt a Magistrate and a Physician.
that the one suffer those to die whose life they could not save; the other
contrariwise condemns the malefactor disgracefully, and forcibly drives him
out of the world, not because he t^keth pleasure to put any man to death. (for
far off is a wisem^n from such barbarous cruelti^) but to the end that those
who ar^ condemn^d ^o death, should serve for an example to all men, and that
the Commonwe^lth might make use of their death, who during their life, would
be pro^itable to no man. The nature of man therefore is not punishment, and
therefore is not wrath according to the nature of a man, because it is desirous
of reu^nge. I will propose in this place an Argument of Platoes, For who
forbids us to make use of other men's reasons? In as much as they mak^ for
us. A good man (says he) does not hurt, it is the punishment that hurts,
punishment therefore does not become a good man. And consequently, neither
choler, because punishment is agreeable to the same: If a good man take no
pleasure in punishing, neither shall he take pleasure in that affect, to which
punishment is a pleasure. Therefore wrath is not natural.

CHAP. VII.
IS not wrath therefore to be admitted, He proves no^ that anger is not
pro^itable.
although it be unnatural, because that oft-times it has been pro^itable. It
raises and inciteth m^ns minds, neither does fortitude perform any worthy
action in war, except by this means men's hearts be inflamed, and this
ins^igation has whetted and animated bondmen to attempt dangers. Some
therefore think it requisite to temper wrath, and not to extinguish it, and
that being taken away which is exuberant, to reduce it into a laudable form;
and to retain that without which the action would languish, and the force and
vigor of the spirit be resolved. First, it is more easy to exclude such
things as are pernicious, then to govern the same, and not to admit them
rather then to moderate them when they are admitted. For when they have put
them selves into possession, they are more powerful then their guide, and
suffer not themselves either to be deminished or cut off. Again, reason it
self to whom the ruins are delivered, is so long powerful, as long as she
is separated from passions; But if she intermixeth her self, and be defiled
with them, she cannot restrain those whom she might have removed. For the
mind being once moved and shaken, is addicted to that whereby it is driven.
The beginning of some things are in our power, but if they be increased, they
carry us away perforce, and suffer us not to return back: even as the bodies
that fall headlong downward, have no power to stay themselves. A fit
similitude to confirm hi^ second proo^e.
And can those that are cast down, retain or stay themselue^ in their fall,
but an irreuocable precipitation has cut off all counsel, and all means of
remedy, neither is it possible to keep themselves from attaining thither,
whether had they their choice they would not arrive. So the mind if it has
plunged it self in wrath, love, and such like affections, is not suffered to
restrain the full, it must needs be, that the weight and nature of vices,
inclined unto their full; carry it away and precipitate it to the bottom.

CHAP. VIII.
The remedy of the precedent di^^i^ultie.

A reason that ought to be carefully observed and marked.


IT is best therefore forthwith to despise the first assault, and resist the
beginnings. And to endeavor that we fall not into wrath, for if she
begins to transport us, it is a hard matter to recover the right way.
Because reason has no place, as soon as passion has gotten the upper hand,
and Will has given him any interrest, then will she afterward do, not what
thou permittest, but what she pleases. First of all say I, the enemy is to
be driven from our borders, for when he is entered and has gotten the gates,
he takes no condition with his Captives. For at that time the mind is not
retired, neither exteriourly examineth she affections, to the intent she
suffers them not to have further progress then they should, but is changed
her self into passion, and therefore can she not revoke that profitable and
wholesome force, which is already betrayed and weakened. For as I said, these
have not their distinct and several seats, I mean passion (which is a change
in the Soul from good to evil) and reason (which is a change from evil to
goodness.) How therefore shall reason which has given place unto anger, and
is seized and oppressed with vices, rise again? Or how shall she deliver her
self from confusion, wherein the mixture of the worst has prevailed? But some
(says he) contain themselves in anger, Is it in such sort that they
accomplish nothing which choler commands, or do they obey the same
somewayes? If they do nothing, it appears that wrath is not necessary in
human actions whom you preferred, as if she had somewhat more greater
efficacy then reason. In conclusion, I ask this question, whether she be
stronger or weaker then reason? If stronger, how may reason give her a Law and
restrain her, considering that they are but feeble things which obey her. If
weak, reason of her self is sufficient without her to effect things, neither
desires she the help of so powerless a passion. But some that are angry
are their own men, and contain themselves. How? Then when anger is already
pacified, and remitteth of her own accord. Not when she is in height of her
fervor, for then is she stronger. What then? Do not some men in the height
of their displeasure, suffer those to depart safe and secure, whom they hate
and abstain from hurting them? But how? After that a second passion has
repulsed the former, or fear or pleasure has commanded this or that, wrath
staieth it self, not for the reverence she owes unto reason, but by reason of
a feeble and evil accord which the passions have amongst themselves.

CHAP. IX.
A continuation of the objection and answer.
TO conclude it has nothing profitable in it self, neither does it when the
courage in warlike exploits. For Virtue which is contented with her self, must
never be assisted by vice. As oftentimes as she is to attempt any thing, she
is not angry but raises her self so far forth as she thinks it
necessary, ^he is both intended and remitted no otherwise then those arrows
which are shot out of Engines, are in the power of him that shoots, how far
they shall be shot: Anger says Aristotle is necessary, neith^r c^n any thing
be achieved without her, except she encourage the mind, and enkindle the
spirit. But we are to use her not as a Captain but as a Soldier: Learn here
the use of anger.
which is false. For if she give ear to reason, and follow the way she is
directed, then is it not anger whose property is contumacie: but if she resist
and is not quieted when she is commanded, but passes further with pride and
fury, she is as improfitable a Minister of the minde^ as a Soldier that
retireth not to his colors when the retreat is sounded. If therefore she
suffer her self to be kept in measure, she must be called by another name,
she cease to be wrath, which I understand to be unbridled and untamed. If
she suffer it not she is pernicious, neither is she to be reckoned amongst the
number of helps: So that either she is not Anger or else she is unprofitable:
For if any man exacteth punishment, not being greedy of the punishment it
self but because he must, he is not to be numbered amongst those that are
Angry. That man shall be reputed a profitable Soldier, who knows how to
obey Counsel, as for affections, they are as evil Ministers as they are
Captains. Reason therefore will never take to her assistants, improvident and
violent passions over whom she has no authority, and whom she never may
restrain except she oppress their equals, and likes unto them as fear to
Anger, Anger to cowardice, desire to fear.

CHAP. X.
Far be it from virtue to be reduced to this extremity, An answer to
Aristotle's opinion, who in his Ethikes says that choler is necessari^.
that reason should be constrained to have his recourse to vices. Here cannot
the mind remain in any certain quiet; he must needs be in perpetual
agitation and trouble, who is secure in his evils, who cannot be strong except
he be wrathful, nor modestuous except he desire, nor quiet except he fear, he
must live in a Tyranny that becomes a slave to any passion. Are you not
ashamed to thrust Virtues under the protection of vices? Moreover, reason
loses her power if she can do nothing without passion, but begins to be
equal, and like unto her. For what imports it, whether passion be an
inconsiderate a thing without reason, or that reason be feeble: and of no force
without passion? All comes to one, the one cannot be without the other. But who
will endure that passion, should be equalled with reason? Choler (says he) is
a profitable passion, if it be small and little. I if she be profitable by
nature: but if she be incapable both of government and reason, she shall
attain this only thing, by her moderation: that the lesser she is, the less
hurtful she shall be. Therefore a light passion is nothing else but a small
evil.

CHAP. XI.
BUT against our enemies (says he) Wrath is necessary. The continuati^^ of
the confutation of Aristotle's opinion.
Never less. Wherein our passions should not be intemperate but obedient and
moderate. For what other thing was it, that crushed and confounded the
Barbarians so strong in their bodies, so patient in their labors, but Wrath
which is most pernicious to her self? Art likewise defenceth the
sword-players, Wrath lays them open to danger. Furthermore what need we
wrath, wh^re reason may do the same. Think thou that Hunter is angri^ with
wild beasts, either when he chaseth them as they ^lie, See Marius life in
Plutarch.
or assaileth them when they draw near him? Reason does all these things
without Wrath. What has so confounded so many thousand Cimbrians and Teutons,
that were spread upon the Alps, that the notice of so great an overthrow was
not related, to their friends by a messenger but by Fortune, but that Wrath in
them had the place of Virtue? Which as some times she has defeated and
overthrown, those that met her, so oftentimes is she the cause of her own
confusion. May a man find out a Nation more courageous, more forward and
ready to incursions and charges, more desirous of war, then the Almaines,
who are borne and brought up to Arms: who are only diligent herein, and
negligent in the rest? Is there a people more hardened unto labor, and that
indureth travail better? For the most part they care not, to make provision of
garments for their bodies to keep them warm: neither strive they to retire
themselves from the perpetual fury of the frost, which is in that Country;
yet are they defeated and put to flight upon the first charge, and before the
Legions were seen by Spaniards, French, Asians, and Syrians, who are but cold
Soldiers in the War: being subject by no other means to this disaster, but
by reason of their wrath. So then, to these bodies, to these minds that are
ignorant of delights, S^^ Liuie of the (...) Wa^^^s, and Pluta^ch i^ the (...)
o^ Fabiu^ Maximus and Haniball.
excess, and riches, give reason and discipline to guide them. But without
farther debating in this kind, I must call to remembrance in this place the
Ancient custom of the old Romans. By what other means did Fabius reserve
the decayed forces of the declining Empire, but that he knew how to delay, how
to lengthen out matters, and dally with the time, all which angry men cannot
do. The Commonweal had been utterly overthrown, that then stood in great
extremity, if Fabius had dared so much as wrath persuaded him unto; but having
for counsel the consideration of the estate of Rome, and the forces he had,
under his government, which had they been defeated either in the whole or in
part, all the rest was utterly ruinated, he laid wrath aside, and the desire
of vengeance, and having his mind fixed upon the good of the Commonweal and
upon the present occasion: he first of all surmounted Choler, and after that
Hanibal. What did Scipio? Having forsaken Hanibal, and the Carthaginian A^mie,
and all these with whom he should be angry, did he not translate the War
into Africa in so slow a manner that they who envied his Virtue, reputed him
for an idle and dissolute man. What did the other Scipio? did he not bele^ger
Numantium for a long time, and patiently disiested both this his private
grief, and the discontent of the whole State, by reason that Numantium kept
out longer then Carthage. Which while he trencheth about and shuts up his
Enemy, he drew them to this extremity; that they murdered o^e an other.

CHAP. XII.
WRath then is neither profitable in skirmishes or in War, for it is too
prone to temeritie, and whilst she endeavors to harm others she hazardeth
her self. That Virtue is most assured, that has long time examined and
governed her self, and has been guided by good and wise counsel. The
conclus^on of the refutation which is precedent, and ^n an^wer to an other
objection.
What then (says he) shall not a good man be angry, if he see his Father
stricken, his Mother ravished? He shall not be angry, but revenge and defend
them. What fear thou that his pie^ie toward his parents is not an occasion
more pregnant to incite him thereunto then wrath is? We say after the same
sort. What therefore? shall not a good man when he sees his Father, or his
son, cut in pieces, weep or fall in a sound? as we see it falls out in
women, as often as any slight suspicion of danger does awake them. A good man
executes his offices without confusion or fear, and in such sort will
perform those things that are worthy a good man, that he will do nothing
that is unworthy a man. Shall my Father be murdered? I will defend him. A
pretty re^utation of Theophrastus.
Is he slain? I will bury him, not because I am sorry therefore, but for
that I am bound thereunto. When thou say thus, Theophrastus thou seek to
draw more stronger precepts into hatred, and forsaking the Judge have recourse
unto the people; because in such accidents every one is accustomed to be
angry: thou think that men will judge that that ought to be done which they
do. For the most part, every one judges that affection to be just which they
allow of. Are good men angry at their injuries? but they do the same, if
warm water be not fitly mixed, if their glass be broken, if their shoe be
sprinkled with dirt. It is not piety, but their infirmity that moves that
wrath. We resemble those to children who will weep no less for the loss of
their Ants, then for the death of their parents. It is the part of no pious but
an infirm and weak mind to he angry for a man's friends. But this is a
worthy matter, and well beseeming a man to show himself a protector of his
parents, his children, his friends, and his Country: not by violence, or
passion; but voluntarily with judgment, and discretion, with providence, and
moderation. For there is no affection so desirous of revenge, as wrath is, by
reason whereof she is wholly improper to that effect, being hindered by her
violence and fury; even as ^uerie passion is opposite and contrary to it
self, in all that whereunto she is inclined, and whereto she runs hastily.
And therefore, neither in peace, or war, was it ever good. For she makes
peace like unto war; and in Arms forgets her self, that war is common,
and comes into an other man's power, whilst she is not in her own.
Furthermore, vices therefore are not to be entertained and used because at
sometime they have done some good: for feuours also do cure some kinds of
sicknesses^ neither therefore is it better not to have wanted them wholly. It is
an abominable kind of remedy to recover health by the asistance of a
^icknesse. In like manner, wrath although sometimes it has beyond expectation
profited as venomne precipitation and shipwreck have done, yet it is not
therefore to be reputed a thing entirely profitable, for oftimes poisons have
preserved the life of diverse person^.

CHAP. XIIII.
Moreover those things which we ought to esteem good, are the better, and
more to be desired, the greater they be. If justice be good, no man will say,
that it is like to be better, if any thing should be taken from it; if
Fortitude be good^ no man will desire that it should be diminished in any part,
and wrath the greater it is the better that is, The increase of wrath is
unprofitable, and therefor wrath it self.
for who refuses the increase of any good thing? but the increase of wrath is
unprofitable, and consequently the bearing of the same is unprofitable. It is
no good thing that by increase becomes evil. Wrath (says he) is profitable:
because it makes men more hardy to fight. In this manner Drunkenness is
profitable, for it makes men more insolent and audacious, and many that have
drunken over freely, are more ready at their weapons, In this manner say, that
both ^renzie, and Madness, are necessary for valiant men: because oftentimes
Fury makes men more strong and able. What? has not fear sometimes made a
Coward valiant, and the fear of death likewise enkindled, the weakest hearted
men to the battle? But Wrath, Drunkenness, Fear, and such like, are but
filthy and frail prouocations, neither confirm V^rtue which has no need of
vice, but do sometimes a little quicken a slow and idle mind. No man is
strengthened by his anger, except he have been strong before his anger. To
them anger assisteth not, but supplieth the place of Virtue. In brief, if this
passion were recommendable, it would follow every one that were most perfect;
but they that are the most tetchie, are infants, old-men, and sick-men, and
every Creature that is by nature weak and feeble, is ordinarily froward.

CHAP. XIIII.
A new objection of Theophrastus, touching the hearts good, men conceive
against evil men.
IT cannot be (says Theophrastus) but that a good man should be displeased
with the wicked. In this sense the better men should be the most choleric.
But contrariwise they should be more peaceable, exempt from passions, and
without hatered of any man. What reason might move them, to hate sins,
considering that it is error which drives them into these faults: But it is
not the part of a Wise man to have those that err, otherwise he should hate
himself. Let him bethink himself, how many faults he commits against good
manners, how many things he has done which require pardon? Then shall he be
angry with himself. For a just Judge pronounces not one sentence in his own
behalf, another in another. A man (says he) is not to be found, that can
absolve himself, truth it is, that every man (says he) is innocent but it is
in regard of witnesses not of his conscience. How far more humane were it for
a man to show himself gentle, and pacified to those that offend, and rather to
recon^^le them then to persecute them. It were better to lead them, into the
direct way who for want of knowledge have straied out of it; as to thrust them
out of the way. An answer gro^ded upon diverse reas^^s.
A man ought to correct him that offends by admonitions^ forcible
reprehensions, friendly but effectual speech: to the end to make him better
for himself and for others. In brief, he ought to chastise him without
passion of Choler. For what Physician is he, that will be angry and
displeased with his Patient, whom he would recover?

CHAP. XV.
But they cannot be corrected, neither is there any thing in them that is
capable of good hope; That a man may chastise, nay may ex^^ute ^^^enders
without being transported by Choler.
Let those be exterminated out of the company of men, who are like to infect
those who converse with them, and since it is the only means, let them cease
to be evil, but let this be done without hatred. For what cause have I to
hate him whom I then pro^it most, when I take him self from him self. Does a
man then hate his limbs when he cutteth them off, this is not Wrath but a
miserable cure. We chase away mad Dogs, we kill a res^ie and intractable Ox.
We arde our scabbe Sheep, for fear least they infect the flock; we strangle
monstrous birthes; we drown our own children likewise if they be borne
deformed and monsters. It is not an act of wrath but of reason, to separate
those things that are unprofitable from those that are helthfull and
profitable. There is nothing^ which he that chastises an other should more
refrain then from wrath, because that chastisement profits when it is done
with judgment. Thenc^ it is that Socrates said unto his slave, I had beaten
thee, had I not been angry. He deferred the admonition of his servant till a
more convenient time, and at that time he admonished himself. Whose affection
shall be temperate, when as Socrates da^e not trust him self to his wrath?
There needs therefore no angry corrector to chastise those that are wicked
and do amiss. For whereas wrath is an offense of the mind, he that is faulty
himself, must not punish offenders.

CHAP. XVI.
WHat then shall I not be angry with a thief? An answer to an other objection.
Shall I not be displeased with a Witch. No; For neither am I angry with my
self when I let my self blood. For I apply all sorts of punishment in stead
of remedy. Thou that as yet have made but an entrance into error, neither
offendest grievously but frequently, shall first of all be secretly, then
publicly reproved. If thou engage thy self further in sin, so as words may
not correct thee, thou shall be fined for thy folly; but if thy fault
requires some more forcible and feeling punishment, thou shall be banished
and sent to unknown places. Of the orde^ that ought to be ^bse^^ed in
punishing malefac^ors.
But if thy malice increases, and waxes obdurate, that thou have need to use
more sharper remedies then the precedent; thou shall be thrust into shackles
and locked up in prison. If thou be come incurable, and thou growest to heap
sin upon sin, if thou not only layest hold on the occasions to do evil
(which never fail those that seek them) but that which is worst, if to do
evil, thou have no other occasion, but the wicked custom thou have taken,
thou have drunk iniquity, and ^rt in such sort tainted and so deeply
tinctured with wickedn^ss^ inwardly, that it cannot find issue out, except
thou burst and die presently. Thou have long time sought for death, poor man
that thou art, w^ will gratify thee^ we will heal thee of this fury of thy
spirit wherewith thou art torm^nted, and having made thee pass by the
punishment of other men and thine own, I will let thee see and feel the only
good which remains for thee that is to say, death. Why should I be
displeased with him whom I assist and greatly help at that time. To take a
man's life from him, An amplification of that example above written and an
answer to the pr^cedent objection.
is sometimes to show him favor and to do him a good turn. If I were a well
experienced Physician, and should enter into an Hospital or some rich man's
house, I would not ordain one and the same medicine for diverse sick men. I see
diverse vices in so different minds, and am appointed to have the government of
a City, I must search out a medicine for every one of their sicknesses. Shame
must cure this man, travel that man; the whip one man, necessity the other,
and the sword the last. Therefore, although in being a Maiestrate, I ought to
change my Garment, and cause the people to be assembled upon the sound of a
Trumpet, yet will I ascend the Tribunal, not moved or displeased, but with
the countenance of an upright Judge, armed with the authority of the Laws,
and will pronounce the sentence with a voice rather pleasing and grave, then
furious: and peaceably yet severely will command the hangman to execute his
office. And when I shall command any malefactors head to be strooken off; and
when I cause the parricide to be sown into a sack, and afterward to be cast
into the water; and when I judge the offending Soldier to pass the pikes; and
when I command the Traitor and public enemy to be cast down from the
Tarpeian rock, I will be so far from wrath, and so temperate in my mind,
as when I kill Serpents or other venomous beas^es. But wrath is necessary for
him that will punish. What think thou that the Law is angry with those she
knows not? Whom she sees not? Whom she hops not to be? We ought
therefore to inuest his affection, which is not displeased but only defines.
For if it be convenient for a good man to be angry for evil deeds, it shall
be as lawful for him to envy the prosperity of evil men. For what is more
unworthy then that some men flourish, yea and such who abuse the indulgence of
fortune, for whom no fortune may be found out evil enough. But as well shall
he see their commodities without envy, as their heinous offenses without
wrath. A good Judge condemns that which is evil, and yet hates it not: What
then? Shall not a wise man when he has such a lik^ thing in his hands be
touched in mind, and more troubled then ordinary? I confeffe it, he shall
feel some light motion. For as Zeno says, when the wound in a wise man's Soul
is healed, yet remains there some scarre. So then he shall feel certain
touches of suspicion and shadows of passion, yet without any passion.
Aristotle says, that some affections, if a man use them well, serve insteede
of arms; which should be true, If the wiseman ought to be moved and ^ow.
if they might be used and laid aside as warlicke instruments, at the pleasure
of him that puts them on. These Arms which Aristotle gives nature, fight
of themselves, and expect not that a man should make use of them, That which

they govern and know not what it is to obey: virtue has no need of
instruments. We are sufficiently furnished by reason, wherewith nature has
fitted us. She it is that has given us a weapon, firm, perpetual,
obsequious, and certain, and such as cannot be reinforced against the Master.
Reason of it self is sufficient enough, not only to foresee, but to execute
any action. For what is more fond then that reason should seek assistance from
wrath: a stable thing from an uncertain: a faithful from a perfidious, a whole
from the sick? Moreover as touching the actions themselves, wherein the help
of anger seems to be most requisite, reason it self is more stronger. For
having marked out that which she ought to do, she remains always settled in
her resolution and being unable to find out any thing better then her self to
change her, she departs never from her place. Contrariwise pity has
oftentimes driven wrath out of doors, for this passion has no solid strength,
but only a tumor, and uses violent beginnings, no otherwise then the winds
which arise from the earth and being entertained by the floods and marshes are
vehement^ but not permanent. It begins with a great violence, and
a^terwardes faints being wearied before her time, and when she has inuen^^d
naught else but cruelty, and new kinds of punishment, when execution is to be
done, she is pacified and becomes gentle. Affection qua^leth quickly, reason
is equal. Moreover also where wrath perseuereth sometimes, if there are many
that have deserved death, after the blood of two or three, she begins to be
calmed. The first assaults of her are sharp, even as the venomnesse of
Serpents are hurtful: that creep from their d^nnes^ her teeth are harmless,
when as often biting has spent them. They therefore suffer not equally, who
have offended equally, and often times he that has offended the least,
suffers the most because he is the object of the latest anger and is wholly
vnequall^ sometimes it extends it self farther then it should, sometimes it
resists more then it ought. For she flattereth her self and judges as she
list, and will not hear, and leaves no place for excuse, and retains that
which she has apprehended; and suffers not her judgment to be taken from
her, although it be evil. Reason gives place to either part, and time
likewise, Afterward she demands a term for her self, to the end she may
have time to discuss the truth; wrath is hasty: The designs of Reason and
wrath.
Reason will have that judged which is rightful, wrath will have that seem
rightful which she judges. Reason respects nothing but that which is in
question, wrath is moved with vain things, and such as are nothing to the
purpose. An assured countenance, a firm voice, a free speech, an exquisite
garment, a delay without delay, a ^auour of the people, exaspereth wrath.
Oftimes in despite of the advocate ^he condemns him for whom he pleads.
And although the truth be laid before her eyes, she loves and maintains
error, she will not be reproved and in evil enterprises she esteems it
more honest to be obstinate, then to repent herself. Caius Piso was in our
memory a man exempt from many vices, A notable example, confirming that which
^e says, that Anger ought not to be endued with Reason, because sh^^
extingu^sheth it.
yet extremely choleric, and such a one as took pleasure in his austeritie.
He being displeased, when he had commanded a Soldier to be brought before
him, who had returned from his pillage without his companion as if he had
murdered him, whom he could not bring in person, when he was requested time to
find him out, denied it him, and condemned him to die. This Soldier, thus
sentenced being brought without the trenches, already tendered his neck unto
the Hangman, when suddenly his fellow Soldier appeared, whom men suppo^ed to
be slain: whereupon the Centurion who had the charge to see the execution
done, commanded the Hangman to put up his sword, and after brought him to Piso,
who was condemned to the end he might make proof of his innocence, since
Fortune had afforded him the means. The other Soldiers flocked about these
two, who embraced one another to the content of all their companions. But Piso
incensed with choler, ascended the Tribunal seat and commanded both the
Soldiers to be led to death: both that Soldier that had not slain his
fellow, and him that was not slain. What indignity is this? Because the
innocence of him that was condemned was manifest, both perished. Piso added
the third. For he commanded that Centurion who had brought back him that was
condemned; to be led to execution. Here three were appointed to die in one
place for one man's innocence. Oh how cunning is wrath to feign causes of
fury; I command thee, says he, to be led to death, because thou art
condemned; thee, because thou were the occasion of thy fellow Soldiers death;
thee, because being commanded to see him executed, thou did not ^bay thy
Commander. He devised how to find three crimes because he found none. Wrath,
say I, has this evil in it, it will not be governed. She is angry with
truth it selfe^ ^f she seem in any sort opposite against her will. With cry,
tumult, and iactation of the whole body, she persecuteth these whom she has
resolved to injury with reproaches and curses. This does not reason, but if it
must needs be so, silently and quietly, she ruineth whole houses from their
foundations, and destroieth whole families that are enemies to their Country.
With their wifes and children, she raceth down their houses, and leueleth
them with the earth, and obscureth their names that are enemies to liberty,
This does she not with foaming at the mouth, Note this you that are
Magigis^rates.
nor shaking of the head, neither doing any thing that is indecent for a Judge,
whose looks, at that time especially, ought to be most pleasing, and stayed
when he pronounces matters of consequence. What need thou, says Ierosme,
when thou art intended to strike any man, to bite thy lip first? What if he had
seen, the Proconsull leaping from the Tribunal, and taking away the Sergeants
rods, and renting his garments, because the garments of such, as were
condemned, were not rent off soon enough? What needs it to ouer-torne the
table, to break and fling away the pots, to beat ones head against the
pillars, to tear his hair, and to thumpe his thigh and breast? How great is
that anger think thou, which because it is not so suddenly vented against
another, as a man would, reflecteth upon her self? He is therefore held by his
Neighbors, and entreated to pacify himself, none of which things does he,
who is void of anger, but inioyneth every one his deserved punishment.
Oft-times dismisseth he him whose guiltiness and forfeit he has apprehended,
if by confessing the act he promise great hope of amends, if he understand that
the offense grew not from the malice of his heart, but as they say, was
committed and not complotted with sinister intent. He will give such a pardon
as neither shall be hurtful to those that receive the same, nor to those that
give it. Sometimes will he repress the greatest offenses committed by
infirmity, and not by cruelty, more gently then other less, if in them be
some hidden, covered, and inueterate craft. He will punish the same fault in
different men, after a different manner: if the one have committed it through
negligence, the other studied to do hurt. He will observe this always in
every judgment, and execution to ordain one sort of punishment, to correct
the evil, an other to cut them off. And in both these shall he consider, not
those things that are past, but those things that are to come. For, as Plato
says, No wise man punishes for evil doing, but lea^t we should fall to
evil doing. For those things that are past cannot be recalled, those things
that are to come may be prevented, and those whom he would make examples of.
For some cursed crime, he executes them publicly, not only to the end they
may die, but that others might be deterred from doing evil, by beholding the
execution. An advertisement for Magistrates to beware of anger which cannot
make a man more magnanimous.
Each one ought to weigh and consider these reasons. Thou se^st how much a
Magistrat^ should be exempt from all passion, when he undertakes a thing of so
great consequence, as the life and death of men, that are under his hands. The
sword is indiscreetly committed to a furious man's hands. Neither ought we to
think this that wrath adds any thing to the greatness of the mind. For
that is no greatness but a swelling, neither to bodies that are intended by
abundance of bad humors, is the sickness and increase, but a pestilent
plenty. As they whom anger, which is a passion vile and base, puffs up and
raises above the thoughts of other men, make themselves believe that their
thoughts are sublime and high, whereas there is nothing firm in all that which
they do, but as they have builded in the air, so sinketh it and falls of it
self. Wrath has no assistant or sustainer, she proceeds not from any thing
that is permament and durable, but is windy and vain, and differs so far
from greatness of mind as audaciousnesse from fortitude, insolence from
confidence, sadness from austeritie, and cruelty from severity. There is a
great difference betwixt a constant and a proud mind. Wrath enterpriseth
nothing that is great or worthy. Contrariwise, in my judgment, it is a token
of a dull and unhappy man, and guilty of his own weakness, to be sorrowful
oftentimes. Even as those bodies that are exulcerated and sick, complain i^
they be touched never so little, so is it a womanish and childish fault: yet is
it incident to men, for men likewise have childish and womanish wits. What
then? are not some words uttered by angry men, who have not the true
knowledge of magnanimity, which seem notwithstanding to proceed from a great
and generous mind? As that most dire and abominable speech, Let them hate me,
so they fear me. Know that this was written in Syllaes time, I know not
whether wish were worse for him, either to be hated, or to be feared: Let them
hate me. He forethinketh that which will happen, that his subjects will curse,
betray, and oppress him. What adds he hereunto, The gods confound him, so
worthy a remedy has he found out for hatred. Let them hate: What? whilst
they obey? No: whilst they approve? no. What then? so they fear, so would not
I have him be beloved. Think thou that this is spoken with a great spirit?
Thou art deceived; for this is not greatness but cruelty. Thou art not to
give credit to wrathful men's words, whose boasts are great and threating, but
inwardly there hearts are crauen and coward. Thou must not repute that to be
true which is spoken by Liuie that eloquent man. Of him, A man that had a mind
rather great then good. These cannot be separated, ^ither it shall be great and
good, or it shall not be great; because I mean the greatness of a man that is
unshaken, and inwardly solid, and even and equal from one end unto another,
which cannot be in evil minds. For they may be terrible, tumultuous and
dangerous to death, but they shall not have greatness whose foundation is
strength and goodness: yet in speech, in action, and all outward appearance
they will make show of great courage. They will let slip some words, which
thou will suppose to be worthy and witty, as Caius Caesar did, who being
angry with the heavens, because it thundered whilst his plaiers acted, whom he
imitated more diligently then he beheld them, and because his banquet was
interrupted by lightning, that was scarce rightly aimed, he challenged Jupiter
to fight with him without delay, pronouncing this Verse in Homer: Either kill
me, or I thee.
What madness was it? he thought that either Jupiter could not hurt him or
that he could hurt Jupiter. I cannot imagine but that this speech of his was
of some great moment to incense their hearts of those that had conspired
against him for they supposed it to be an insufferable matter to suffer him
who could, not endure Jupiter. Then there is nothing great or noble in wrath,
no not when it seems to be most v^hement and despises both men and gods: or
if any man supposes that wrath produces a great mind, let him say as much of
dissoluteness. She will be carved in Iuorie, clothed with purple, covered
with gold, transfer one Country to an other, shut up Seas, precipitate
Rivers, hang Forests in the air. Let Avarice also be esteemed generous: she
lies upon heaps of gold and silver, his pastures and lands are tilled under
the name of whole Provinces. And under every one of his Farmers he enjoys a
greater quantity of land, then the Provinces that were allotted to those that
were Consuls. Let lust likewise be reputed to be a worthy thing. It swimmeth
over Seas, geldeth troops of young children, makes the wise without
apprehension of death to be murdered with her husbands own hands. The same
may we say of Ambition, that she is magnanimous, and contenteth not her self
with yearly honors, but will, if it may be, fill all the months and days of
the year with one name, and plant her arms through all the world. It skils
not how far all these proceed and extend themselves, they are trifles, they
are miserable and depressed. Only virtue is great and excellent, for there is
nothing great except it be pleasing and peaceable likewise.

The end of the first Book of Anger.
A TREATISE OF ANGER, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO HIS FRIEND NOVATVS.
The second Book.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
IT has two parts, the first contains certain questions of Anger, the other
remedies against the same. The first question is, whether Anger proceed from
passion only. He denies it, and proves that both the mind and judgment
are accessarie thereunto. She therefore gives ^are unto reason, and may be
restrained, which could not be if she were from that only, and not from
nature. By the way he sets down a Stoicall difference, betwixt motions and
affections, this he prosecuteth to the fourth Chapter. Then adds he an other
question, whether cruelty and fierceness proc^ede from Anger, he denies it,
and says that it is a different affection, yet that it oftentimes has his
beginning or nourishment from often displeasure. After this in the sixth
Chapter, whether a good man be displeased with the offense or the offender? He
d^nieth and discharges a wise man from all this affection until the eleaueth
Chapter. From thence he enquireth whether wrath be profitable, because it
delivers a man from contempt, and terrifieth the evil? He does not admit it,
and confesses that it is feared which is not good, or to be desired by a good
man. For both wild beasts and sicknesses are feared. This until the
thirteenth Chapter, and in it he confesses that Anger may be ^ained, and yet
not used by a wise man. Neither that she resideth in a simple and generous
mind, because the free and unconquered nations have the same, yea such as are
savage and incapable both of le^rning or reason. At length in the eighteenth
Chapter, he profitably passes over to the remedies of Anger, he dilateth
these two things. That we should not b^e angry, and that we should not sin
in our Anger, least we fall into the same. Such and such an education is
requisite, at last he wills us to impugn the first causes of wrath, and
always to use counsel and time. Then that suspicions are to be driven away,
and excess avoided. Not to be angry with things that are insensible, with
men of weak judgment, with those things which are done by nature, or for our
good. He advises us to see and acknowledge our faults, whereby we may b^come
more equal and just to others. Not to believe rashly, and to examine those
things that are believed by the mind of the doer. Especially that pride is to
be laid aside, and good opinion of a man's self which makes men wrathful and
reuengefull. To suffer rather or to dissemble and to abstain from so filthy an
affection, whose deformity is expressed in the mind and countenance. These
are profitable lessons, let them be read and remembered.

CHAP. I.
He enters into a more particular discourse and disputes first, upon the
source of Anger.
THE first Book Nouatus has comprehended matters more tractable, because it is
an easy matter to run headlong in to vices, considering our inclination and
disposition thereunto. But now we must unfold the smaller parcels of this
discourse. For the question is, whether Anger beginn^th upon judgment, or by
impulsion, that is to say, whether she be moved of her self, or whither she
resemble the most of these passions, which take root in us before we are
aware. But we must subject this dispute to these questions, to the end that
she may be likewise raised to more high considerations. For in our bodies, our
bones, ne^ues, and joints, which are the foundation of the whole, and other
instruments of life scarce, seemly to behold are first formed and ordained,
and afterward those, when the grace and our countenance, and face does
proceed. And in fury, after all this the choler which above all things
rauisheth the eyes, is the last thing which spreads it self thorow-out our
perfect bodies. It is not to be doubted but that a certain appearance of
injury offered, moves anger: but the question is whether wrath presently
follows after this appearance, without consent of the mind, or whether it be
moved by his assent. But our opinion is that she dare do nothing of her
self, but by the approbation of the mind. For to conceive an opinion of
injury, and to desire to be revenged, and to unite both these things together,
that is to say, that they ought not to have been angry, or that he ought to
take revenge; this is no motion that may incite it self without our will. The
above named motion is simple, that whereof we speak is compound, and
contains diverse heads. He has understood somewhat, he is displeased, he
condemns the same, he reuengeth himself, this cannot be done, except his
mind which was touched therewith, yield some consent.

CHAP. II.
Chol^r is the o^sp^ing of our cons^nt.
WHereto say thou appertains this question? To understand what wrath is. For
if she be bred in us against our wills, she will never submit unto reason. For
all those motions which are done against our will, are invincible and
inevitable, as shiuering when we are sprinkled with cold water, a starting
back upon tickling: when we have heard some heavy message, our hair stands
upright; when immodest words, shame colors our countenance; and a swimming
of the head follows those that look down from some high places. Because
none of all these are in our power, there is no reason that counsaileth us to
expose our selves there-against. Wrath is driven away by good precepts. For it
is a voluntary vice of the mind, not of those which happen by a certain
condition of humane kind, and therefore they befall the most wisest. Amongst
which that first motion of the mind is to be placed, which moves us after the
opinion of injury. This motion attends us ever amongst the idle acts of a
play, and upon the reading of Ancient Histories. We seem oftentimes to be
angry, for banishing Cicero, and with Anthony for killing him. Who is not
angry at Marius Arms, and Syllaes proscriptions? Who is not displeased with
Theodotus and Achillas, and that boy Ptolomey, for doing a heinous murder
unfitting for his young year^s? A song some times and a sudden strain of
Music animateth us, and that warlike sound of the Trumpet moves our minds,
and a dreadf^ll picture, and the doleful sight of just men's punishment amazeth
us. There it is that we laugh with those that laugh, and in the company of
these that mourn, we are heavy and are inkindled by beholding other men's
fight, which are not wrathes no more, then sadness is, which contracteth our
brows upon the sight of an enemy, that has suffered shipwreck; no more then
then fear astonisheth the Readers mind, when he over looks of the Story,
how after the battle of Cannas Hanibal approached thee walls Rome. But all
these are the motions of such minds, as are willing to be moved, neither are
thy affections but beginnings and essaies of those affections. For so does the
Trumpet refresh the Soldiers ear, who has a long time lived in rest, and
walked in his long Roabe, during the time of peace, and Warlike horses prick
up their ears upon the clattering of Arms. They say that Alexander the great
whilst Xenophantes sung; laid hand on his weapons.

CHAP. III.
NOne of these things, A subtle distinction of passion.
which casually impell the mind may be called affections. These if I may so
speak it, the mind rather suffers then does; That therefore is affection,
not to be moved with the resemblances of things that are offered; but to suffer
him self to be led by them, and to run after this casual motion. For if any
man suppose that palenesse, and trickling down of tears, and filthy
pollution, or a deep f^t sigh, or eyes suddenly incensed, or any such like
thing, is a token of the affection, and a sign of the mind^, he is deceived,
neither understands he, that these are the agitations of the body. And
therefore the stoutest man sometime waxes pale, whilst he is armed, and the
fiercest Soldier has trembled and shaken his knees a little when the charge
was first sounded, and the greatest Emperor, has had a trembling heart before
the two Armies had shocked and encountered together, and the eloquentest
Orator, whilst he composeth him self to deliver his oration, has felt a
shiuering in the extremities of his body. Wrath must not only be moved, she
must have her outlopes abroad: for it is a passion; but never is a passion,
without the assent of the mind^ for it cannot be, that without the knowledge
of the mind, a man should deliberate upon revenge and punishment. Some man
has supposed himself injuried, and would revenge himself, but upon the
disswasion of some cause, he presently changes his counsel. I call not this
Wrath, but a motion of the mind obedient unto reason. That is Wrath, which
treads down reason, and draws her after her. So then this first agitation
of the mind, which is provoked by the appearance of some injury, is no more
wrath then is the appearance of injury, but that succeeding emotion, which not
only assumeth the resemblance of injury, but has approved the same. Wrath is
a concitation of the mind, tending voluntarily and with judgment to revenge.
Is it to be doubted but that fear is attended by flight, Wrath by
impetuositie? Take heed therefore, if thou persevere in this opinion, that a man
may embrace or avoid any thing without the consent of the mind.

CHAP. IIII.
The explication o^ this d^finition ^i^st of the three mo^ions which are the
b^g^nning, the inc^^a^^, and advanc^m^nt of Ang^r.
AND to the end thou may know, how these passions begin, increase, and
extend them selves. Consider that there are three motions. The first is not
voluntary, but as it were a preparation of the affection, and a conjunction.
The second is annexed, to a will which is not rebellious as that I ought to
revenge my self when I am wronged, or that such a one that has committed some
heinous crime should be punished. The third motion is so violent that it will
not revenge when it ought to do it, but has wholly disclaimed reason. This
first motion of the mind we cannot avoid, although reason assist us, no more
then we can avoid those motions, which as I said happen to the body. We cannot
choose but yawne, if we see an other man yawne. Neither can we choose but
wink if a man suddenly steppeth behind us and blindfoldeth us. These things
cannot reason overcome, happily custom and daily observation may lessen them.
That other motion, which is bred by judgment, is overcome by judgment.

CHAP. V.
THis question likewise is to be examined whether those men that ordinarily
are incensed, and delight in man's blood be angry with such men, whom they put
to death, from whom they never have received, nor suppose themselves to have
received injury, such as were Apolidorus and Phalari. This is not Wrath, but
Cruelty; For she hurts not because she has received an injury, but is
ready to receive injuries, provided that she may do hurt. It is not to
revenge him self that he whippeth and teareth men in pieces, but for pleasure
sake. What then? The beginning of this evil is from Wrath, the which by
frequent exercises having satified her appetite with murders and blood, and
forgotten all Clemency; and driven Humanity from his heart, finally addicteth
himself to all Cruelty. They therefore laugh and are glad, and enjoy much
pleasure, and have their looks far different from those that are angry,
they are cruel, yet quiet in their minds. They say, that Hanibal said when he
saw a trench filled with man's blood. Oh fair spectacle. How far more worthy
a thing had it seemed to him, had he seen a River or Lake filled therewith?
What wonder if thou take so special a delight in this spectacle when as thou
were borne to blood, and from thine infancy have been trained up in murders.
The prosperous fortune of thy Cruelty shall follow thee for twenty years
space, and shall every where yield thine eyes a grateful spectacle, thou shall
see this both about Trasimenum, and about Cannas, and lastly about thy
Carthage. Volesus of late time Proconsull in Asia under the government of
Augustus, after that in one day he had beheaded three hundredth walking amongst
the carcasses, with a proud countenance as if he had done some magnificent
action worthy the beholding cried out in Greek. Oh Kingly exploit. What had
this Volesius done had he been a King? This was not wrath but a greater and
more incurable evil.

CHAP. VI.
Virtue (says he) as it is favorable to honest things, That the wiseman is
not subject to this motion of heart whence proceeds choler.
so is she displeased with dishonest. What if it be said that Virtue ought
both to be humble and to be great? But he that says thus will have her
extolled and repressed. Because joy in performing any notable action, is
apparent and magnificent, anger and despite conceived by reason of another
man's sin, is the sign of a sordid and base mind. Neither will virtue ever
so far forget her self as after she has suppressed vices, she should
imitate them. It is his duty to chastise wrath, which is in no sort better but
often times worse, then those offenses, wherewith she is displeased. It is
proper and natural for virtue to rejoice and be glad, to be angry is not for
her dignity, no more then to mourn. But sadness is the companion of wrath,
and anger after the repentance, and after the repulse conuerteth it self
always into sadness. And if it be the act of a wise man to be displeased
against sins, his displeasures shall increase if they be more great, and it
will follow that the wise man shall not be simply angry, but wrathful. But if
we neither believe that great or frequent anger has place in a wise-mans
mind. What is the cause why we wholly discharge him, not from this affection,
there say I, can be no measure, if he must be angry according to the weight of
every man's offense. For either he shall be unjust, if he equally be displeased
with unequal sin, or most wrathful if he has been incensed so often as
offenses have deserved displeasure. And what is more unworthy then that a
wise-mans affections should depend on another man's wickedness. Even Socrates
himself will forbear to be able to bring back the same countenance home with
him, which he carried out of doors.

CHAP. VII.
But if a wiseman ought to be displeased against dissolute behavior, He
concludes by that which passed before, that a wiseman cannot be angry with
those disorders which he sees.
and incensed and agrieued at wickedness, there is no man more miserable then
he: he must needs spend the whole course of his life in anger and sadness.
For what moment shall there be wherein he shall not see some matters that are
to be disallowed: as often as he shall go out of doors he must pass by
wicked, covetous, prodigal and impudent men, and such as have been made
happy thereby, his eyes shall be turned toward no place, wherein they find
not occasions of dislike? He cannot live if he be displeased so often as the
cause requires. These so many thousand men that trot to the Palace early in
the morning, how bad causes, nay how far worse Lawyers have they? One of
these complains against his Fathers will, where he has occasion to content
himself therewith. Another pleads against his mother: Another accuses his
Neighbor of some crime, wherein he himself is more manifestly faulty, and he
is chosen to be Judge in those causes wherein he himself has most offended,
the baddest cause is favored by all men, and that Counsailer that pleads
uprightly is disgraced, why prosecute I every particular? when thou see the
Courts of pleas stuffed with people, and the bars taken up with all sorts of
people, and that great place wherein the most part of the people show
themselves, know this that in that place there are as many vices as there are
men. Amongst these men that walk in long gowns there is no peace, each of
these will sell one another for a little gain.

CHAP. VIII.
A d^scription of the disorders of his time, represented to the end to express
that a wiseman should be truly miserable, if he would torment himself to see
so many miseries.
NO man takes profit, but by another man's loss, they hate the happy man, they
contemn the miserable; they are agrieued at their Superiors, and are grievous
to their inferiors; they are provoked by diverse desires, and for some light
profit or pleasure they would see all things in confusion. Their life is
nothing different from that of the sword players, who live and fight with one
another. There is an assembly of bruit beasts, except we say that they are
peaceable amongst themselves, and bite not one another: where contrariwise men
have no content, but when they tear and spoil one another. In this one thing
differ they from dumb creatures, that the one are tame to those that nourish
them, but those are enraged against them most, by whom they have been relieved
best. A wiseman shall never cease if he once begin to be angry: all the
world is so full of vices and wickedness. There is more evil committed, then
may by reproof and punishment be healed. Impiety and injustice are upon
their rests, and forcibly just against virtue; day by day the desire of evil
increases, and modesty decreaseth. The carriage of this age.
Dissolution having driven from her all respect of equity and right, has
usurped upon all things at her pleasure; neither are heinous crimes now a-daies
committed in secret; they are perpetrated in the view and eye of all men. And
such pre-eminence and power has wickedness gotten in every place, so deeply
is she possessed of all men's hearts, that innocence, which in times past, was
rare, at this day is wholly extinguished. Have all or a few men broken the law.
All the world is armed, as it were upon the sound of a trompet, to confound and
mix right and justice with wickedness. Ovid. Metamor.
Nor from his Host the guest may be securd,
Nor he whom law and marriage has allotted
To be a Father can remain assurd,
But by his Son his death will be complotted.
Friendship twixt brothers may be hardly found,
The husband seeks occasion to deprive
His wife of life, and she would him confound:
The Enraged Stepdames daily do contriue
To mingle poisons, and the son again
To get his Fathers wealth would see him slain.
(...)mall a part of wickedness is this? he has not described the camps of a
factious commonweal, armed one against another, the fathers following one
part, The miseries of civil warre^.
and the children another, all the Country fired by their hands that should
defend it, the troops of horsemen scouting out on every side to discover the
places, whether the condemned men were retired, the fountains poisoned, the
plague spread abroad by artificial means, the trenches dug by the children
against their own fathers, that were besieged, the prisons full of captives,
the tyrannies, the secret counsels, whence has followed the ruin of
Kingdoms and other public estates, the whoordomes, deflourings, rauishings,
infamous and execrable uncleanness, all which things reputed for glorious and
notable exploits are called wicked, when a man may hinder and extinguish them.

CHAP. IX.
Add now unto these the public periuries of the people, A continuation of
the former discourse, to prove that a wise man cannot possibly entangle
himsel^e with so many miseries.
the breach of alliances, the pillage carried away to him, that has the
greatest power, the deceipts, the thefts, the cauils, tricks of so evil trust
in so great a number, that we had need of three times as large places of
justice as we have, to decide them in: if thou will have a wiseman displeased
so much as the indignity of their wickedness requires, instead of being
angry h^ will be constrained to be mad. Rather think thou this that he
ought not to be angry at errors. For what if a man should be angry with
those that stumble in the dark, or against the deaf, because they do not
that which they are commanded, because they understand it not? or against
children, who in stead of thinking on their duties, busy themselves in play
and sporting with their equals, what if thou would be angry with those
that are sick, with such as are old and weari^d? Amidst the rest of the
incommodities of man's life, this is one; the darkness of our minds, and not
only the necessity of erring, but the love of errors. If thou will not be
displeased with any man, pardon all men; and excuse the infirmity of mankind.
But if thou be angry, both with young and old, because they offend; be
displeased also with little infants, because hereafter they will be vicious.
Is there any man angry with children, who by reason of their tender years know
not how to discern things? It is a more great and iuster excuse to be a man
then a child: we are borne to this condition to be creatures subject as well to
the infirmities of the mind as of the body, not blockish nor stupide, but such
as abuse our understanding. The one of us serve for example of vices unto the
other. Every one follow those that go before, although it be in the way of
error. Why should they not be excused if all of them go astray in the public
way?

CHAP. X.
THe severity of a General is intended against private offenders, but then is
pardon necessary, where his whole Army has forsaken him. What takes away a
wise man's wrath? the multitude of offenders. He understands how unjust and
dangerous a thing it is to be displeased with a guilty multitude: Heracli^us
as often as he went forth a doors, and saw about him such a multitude of evil
livers, nay rather men dying wickedly, he wept; having compassion of all those
that met him with a joyful and contented countenance, being himself mild in
mind, and feeble in heart, and such a one as deserved to be deplored
himself. Contrariwise it is said that Democritus never looked abroad without
laughing, so trifling reputed he all those things which were seriously done and
^ought after. Where in this world is there any place for Anger? All things are
either to be laughed at, or to be lamented. A wiseman will not be angry with
those that offend. Why? Because he knows that no man is borne wise, but is
made wise: he knows that in every age there are few that become wise, because
he understands the condition of human life, but no wiseman will be angry
with nature; for what if he would wonder because that apples grow not on wild
brambles? what if he wonder why thorns and bushes bear not exquisite fruit?
no man is angry with nature when she excuses the imperfection. A wiseman
therefore is peaceable, and remitteth faults, not an enemy but an admonisher
of those that do amiss with this mind daily walks he out. Many will meet
me in the way that are addicted to wine, many lechers, many that are
ungrateful, many covetous men, and many that are possessed with the fury of
ambition. All these men will he entertain as courteously as the Physician does
his sick patients. Is he displeased either with his Sailers or his Ship whose
Bark having her timbers loose has a great leake, and sinketh in much water?
He rather helps them, he calketh the vessel to keep out the waves, he
drives out the rest and shuts up the holes that appear, and resists by his
continual labor and pumping, those that are yet undiscovered, neither
therefore intermitteth he because so much was gotten out, as was entered in. We
had need of succors of long continuance against so continual and fruitful
evils, not that they may cease, but least they overcome.

CHAP. XI.
He prosecuteth the explication of the definition of Anger, which he terms
an emotion of the heart, t^nding voluntarily and with judgment unto vengeance,
showing that t^is passion as being unprofitable, ought not to be found amongst
wise men, who condemn the emotion and the vengea^^e^ and rather n^glect then
^^^re it.
WRath, says he, is profitable because she escapes contempt, and terrifieth
evil men. First of all wrath, if it be as much worth as it threatens, for
this very cause, because it is terrible, it is therefore hateful. But it is
more dangerous to be feared then to be despised: but if it be without fear, it
is more exposed to contempt, and subject to derision. For what thing is more
vain and ridiculous then for Anger to be in tempest and tumult for nothing?
Moreover, those things that are terrible are not therefore more great; and I
would not have that said by a wiseman which might be said by a savage beast:
that the weapon of a wild beast is to be feared. What, is not the ague, the
gowt, an ulcer evil? Is there therefore any goodness in these, or
contrariwise are not all things more disdained, filthy and contemptible, in
that they are feared? Anger is of her self deformed, and not to be feared, yet
is it feared by diverse men as a deformed vizard by infants. But why does not
fear always fall upon the head of him that is the author thereof? Neither is
there any man feared that is himself secure. Remember thee in this place of
Laberianus verses, which being spoken in the Theater, in the midst of the
civil wars, no otherwise made all the people attentive unto it, then if a
speech had been uttered that testified the public affection. He needs must
fear many whom many men fe^^^.
So has nature ordained, that he who thinks himself great, because he is
feared, is not himself exempt from fear. How much tremble Lions upon the
least noise? An unacquainted shadow, voice, and oder troubles those beasts
which are the fiercest. All those which affright others are a^fraid themselves.
There is no cause therefore why any wiseman should desire to be feared.

CHAP. XII.
Neither therefore let any man think that wrath is great, That ^here is no
great thing in Anger although it moves ^^are.
because she causes her self to be feared, because there are certain things
which are the most contemptible and yet are feared, as venomes, and some
impoisoned meats, and a bite or sting of beasts. Neither is it to be wondered
at, when as a line distinguished with feathers, contains the greatest herds
of wild beasts, and drives them into the Toils, and by their effects they
are called fear; for vain things are afraid of nothing. The shaking of a
Chariot, and the rattling of the wheels drives a Lion into his den; the cry
of a Hog terrifieth an Elephant. So therefore is Anger feared as a shadow is
by infants, as a red feather is by wild beasts. This passion has nothing
firm and powerful in her self, but she is only the Bug-Beare of vain
minds. Wickedness, says he, must be banished out of the world if thou will
exterminate wrath, and as the one of these things is impossible so is the
other. First of all a man may be warm, although that naturally it be Winter,
and he may be temperate although the hottest months do reign. But by the
benefit of the place he is exempted from the intemperature of the year, or by
the patience of his body he overcomes the sense of them both. But take this
to the contrary, thou must needs take virtue first out of thy mind, before
thou entertain wrath, because virtues have no correspondence with vices; and
no more at the same time can an angry man be a good man, then he that is sick
be a whole man. All wrath, says he, cannot be taken away out of the mind,
neither does the nature of man permit him this. But there is nothing so
difficult and dangerous, which a man's mind cannot overcome, and that
continual meditation brings not in use, and no affections are so fierce and
obstinate which are not tamed by discipline. Whatsoever the mind has enjoined
himself he has obtained. Some have gotten that government over themselves
that they will never laugh, some have given over wine, some lechery, and some
have framed their bodies to forbear all w^ter, another by accustoming himself
to sleep little, has gotten so much privilege that he is never weary of
waking, some have learned to run upon small and slender ropes, and to bear
great and mighty burdens, far exceeding the strength of any man, and to
diue into the greatest dep^hes, and without any breathing to remain long time
in the bottom of the Seas.

CHAP. XIII.
THere are a thousand other things wherein an obstinate resolution surmounteth
all other impediments, How profitable a fi^me resolution is against vices.
and shows that there is nothing difficult to him that has resolved himself
to be patient. All these of whom I have spoken before, have had no recompense
of their travail, or if they have received any, it was no great matter. For
what honor has that Tumbler gotten, who has learned to dance upon a rope?
that is exercised to bear a weighty burden upon his neck, that has learned
to restrain his eyes from sleeping? that is taught to diue into the bottom of
the Sea? He awakeneth the s^up^ditie of the m^^t part of men ^p^cially of ^h^se
that are given over to A^ger.
These larbors get but little reward. Shall not we entertain patience, who are
to expect so great a reward as the tranquillity of a happy mind? How great a
thing is it to fly from wrath, which is the greatest evil, and with her to
avoid the other passions, which accompany her, as rage, inhumanitie^
cruelty, and fury? We are not to seek our protection from any, neither ought
we to excuse and dissemble our liberty, by saying, that either this is
profitable or that inevitable; for what error has wanted a Patron? Thou art
not to say that it cannot be cut off, we are sick of curable diseases; and
nature her self that created us for the best, will assist us if we will be
amended. Neither as some men have said, A Stoicall Paradox, as possible as for
a dead man to sly.
is the way to virtues dangerous and difficult, they are easily come by. I will
instruct you in no vain matter. The way unto blessed life is easy, follow the
same in a good hour, and under the favor of the gods. There is more
difficulty in doing those things which you do. For what is more contenting
then the tranquillity of the mind? What more laborsome then wrath? What more
remiss then clemency? What more turbulent then cruelty? Chastity is always
at leisure, dissolution full of business; to conclude, the custody of all
virtue is easy, contrariwise, vices cost very much in entertayning them. Must
wrath be removed? This in part confess they likewise who say, that it is to be
moderated and diminished. Let it be wholly given over: because it will profit
nothing: without her a man may more easily and readily root out wickedness,
the evil shall be punished and brought to a better pass.

CHAP. XIIII.
That a wiseman h^t^ no need of wrath to pe^fo^me his due^^e.
A Wiseman effects al those things which he ought to do, without the
assistance of any evil thing; neither will he intermixe any thing which may
trouble him in the government thereof. Anger therefore is never to be admitted,
yet is it sometimes to be dissembled, if the slow minds of the auditorie are
to be stirred up. Even as we prick forth our sturdie horses by stick and
spur, to perform their race. Sometimes they are to be put in fear, when
reason cannot persuade. It is no less profitable to be angry then to mourn,
then to fear. What then? Do not some causes fall out which provoke Anger? But
even then most especially are we to get the start of her. Neither is it a hard
matter to ouercom the mind, when as the wrastlers also being exercised in their
basest part, yet suffer they strains and strokes that they may spend his forces
with whom they contend; neither strike they when wrath persuades them, but
when occasion commands them. It is reported that Pyrrhus an excellent Master
in wrestling and other exercises, was wont to command those that were his
Scholars to refrain from Anger. For it is Anger that troubles Art, and
considers which way she may hurt, not how she may prevent. Reason therefore
oftentimes persuades patience, wrath revenge, and we that might escape the
first evils, are thrust into greater. Some has the contumely of one word not
dis-jested with discretion, cast into exile, and they that would not bury and
bear a trifling injury in silence, have been overwhelmed with most grievous
calamities; in brief, being not able to endure, that a jot of their great
liberty should be diminished, they have drawn themselves under a serui^e yoke.

CHAP. XV.
TO make thee know (says he) that wrath has somewhat generous in it, That
Choler ha^h nothing generous in it.
thou shall find that the Germans and Scithians (which are free Nations) are
much inclined unto wrath; which comes to pass because their spirits (which
by nature are strong and solid) are easily moved and prone unto Anger,
especially before they be tempered and mollified by discipline. There are
certain passions which never take holde-fast but on the strongest spirits: even
as the most strongest and fruitfullest Coppise grow on the land which is least
manured, and a Forest florisheth in a fruitful soil. Therefore the minds
that by nature are most strongest endure Anger, and being fiery and ho^e,
suffer nothing that is little and feeble; but that vigor is imperfect, as in
all things without Art, which grow only by the benefit^ of nature, which except
they be quickly tamed, that which was disposed to become valor is converted
into audaciousnes and rashness. What, are not those spirits which are gentle and
tractable less vicious? and are they not accompanied with m^rcie, love, and
honest shame? I will therefore show thee a good disposition even in those
things that are evil; but therefore are they not vices, although they are
signs of a better nature. Moreover, all these Nations free in their
fierceness, according to the custom of Lions and Wolves, as they cannot
serve, so they cannot command: for they have not the force of a humane
understanding, but such as is beastly and intractable; but no man can govern,
except he that can be governed.

CHAP. XVI.
FOr the most part therefore the Empire remained amongst those Nations which
live under a milder clime: There i^ no Nation of pliable inclination that are
no^ capable o^ gou^rnment, and ^it to be governed by the most exc^ll^nt amongst
them.
they that are bred toward the Northward and in cold countries, have their
minds most intractable, as the Poet says, And like unto their heaven.
They (says he) are reputed to be the most generous beasts that are most
wrathful. He is deceived that induces them for an example to men, who for
reason use violence: man in stead of violence has reason. Neither is that
passion profitable in them: all fierceness helps Lions, fear Hearts,
violence the Hawke, flight the Dove: neither is that true, that the most
excellentest creatures are the most subject to Anger. Shall I think those
wild beasts better which live by rapine, because they are most fell? I had
rather commend the patience of the Ox and those Horses that are governed by
the bridle. But what is the cause thou should revoke man to such unhappy
examples, when thou have the world and God, who amongst all other living
cr^atures, he only imitateth and only understands? They are account^d the
most simplest men of all other that are most angry. For they are compared to
fraudulent and cunning fellows, and seem to be simple, because they are
discovered, whom I would not call simple but improuident. For we ^^signe this
nam^ to fools, to letchers and prodigal spenders, and such as are not cunning
enough in their follies.

CHAP. XVII.
Whether it be a thing fitting for him that is publicly to declaime to be
moved, and ^ow.
AN Orator (says he) that is moved and angry is sometimes the better, why not
if he counterfeit his Anger? For Players in pronouncing their speeches,
although they be not ang^^^, yet move the people; but in acting the wrath^ull
man cunningly. And before the Judges likewis^, and before the people, and
wheresoever we ar^ to confirm other men's minds in our opinion, sometimes we
our selves will feign to be displeased, sometimes counterfeit fear, sometim^s
compassion to confirm the same in other men. And oft-times that which true
affection could not have effected, imitation of affection has perform^d. It is
a faint mind^, says he, that is without Anger. It is true, if he have nothing
more powerful then Anger in him; neither must he be a thief, neither such a
one as is robbed, neither merciful, nor cruel, the heart of the one is too
tender, the other too obdurate. Let the wiseman be temperate, and in
executing that which he has to do resolutely, let him entertain courage and
not Anger.

CHAP. XVIII.
The second part of th^^ B^oke s^tt^th down the r^medi^^ against Anger.
BEcause we have examined those questions which concern Anger, let us now
descend unto the remedies thereof. They are two in my judgment: the one, that
we fall not into Anger, the other, not to sin when we are angry. As in the
cure of our bodies, there are some precepts to maintain health, othersome how
to restore it when it is decayed, so to surmount displeasure there is one
means to repulse it, another to repress it. Some shall be taught which are
pertinent, and necessary for the whole life, and they shall be divided into
education, and the years that follow. Education requires great diligence, and
is greatly profitable and necessary: for it is an easy matter to fashion and
order tender minds, and those vices are hardly rooted out in us, which have
grown with us. A fiery nature is a proper subject of wrath; for whereas there
are four elements, fire, water, air, and earth, so have they their equal
qualities, cold, hot, dry and moist. So then the mixture of the elements is
the cause of the variety of places, creatures, bodies, and manners; thence
comes it that men's minds are more inclined to this or that, The complexions
of our bodi^s ^ro^ee^ from the ^^^^l^ties that are predominant in them.
according as the vigor of the element abounds more or less in them; thence
it is that we say and call some Regions moist, some dry, some hot^, and some
cold. The same differences are there betwixt men and beasts.

CHAP. XIX.
IT imports very much to understand how much humiditie or heat every one
has in him, The source whence ^ra^h springe^h and his seat.
and according to the element that is most predominant in a man, such are his
manners. The mixture of heat will make wrathful men; for fire is active and
p^rmanent. The mixture of cold^ makes men cold; for cold is of a slow and
heau^^ nature. Some therefore of our sect are of the opinion, that wrath is
enkindled in the breast, by reason of the blood that boyleth about the heart.
The cause why this place is especially assigned unto Anger, is no other, then
that of all the whole body the breast is the hotest. They that have more
moisture in them, their Anger increases by little and little, Because the Sun
of the lesser world inhabiteth in it.
because their heat is not prepared, but is gotten by motion. The displeasures
therefore of children and women are more sharp then they are continuing, and
more feeble in the beginning. In drier ages wrath is vehement and strong, but
without increase, not adding much unto it self, because cold follows the
declining heat. Old^ men are testie and always complaining as sick men do,
and such as begin to recover their health, or that by lassitude or blood
letting have lost a part of their heat. In the same estate are they that are
extremely transported with thirst and hunger, and who have no blood in their
bodies, neither thrive by that they eat, but consume daily. Wine enkindleth
wrath, because it increases heat according to every man's nature.

CHAP. XX.
MVch moved are some when they are drunk, some when they are feasting: Diverse
appeareances o^ wrath accord^^g to the habi^ude o^ persons, and that we ought
to know our own^ nati^e, and ^o ^^e the custom.
neither is there any other cause, why they are most wrathful that have yellow
hair and read faces, who have such a color by nature, as other men are wont
to have, when they are displeased; for their blood is swift and much troubled.
But even as nature disposes some men unto choler, so happen there many causes
which may do the like that nature does. Some has sickness and the injury of
the body drawn into this, othersome labor and continual watching^ nights
spent in great thought, and desires, and loves; and whatsoever else that were
hurtful to the body or mind, or prepares the sicke-mans heart to
complaints. But all these are but beginnings and causes, and custom can do very
much, which if it be depraved nourishes the vice. It is a hard thing to change
nat^re, never is it possible to disseuer the elements, whereof things are
composed, after they are on^e mixed. But it will be profitable to know this, to
the end we may forbid them wine that are of hot natures, 11 d^ legibus. How
child^^n are ^o b^ ordered.
which Plato supposes to be hurtful to children, and therefore forbids us
to add fire to fire. Neither are they to be crammed with meats, for their
bodies are easily distended, and their minds like their bodies suddenly are
puffed up. Let labor exercis^ them without lassitude, that their heat may be
diminished and not consumed, and that the over great fever in them skimmed and
setled^ Metaphora a vino sump^a.
Pa^time likewise will profit them, because a moderate pleasure quickneth the
mind, and temperateth it also. Those that are of a moist, dry, and cold
complexion, there is no danger in their displeasures, yet are greater vices to
be feared in them, as fear, difficulty, desperation and suspicions.

CHAP. XXI.
The continuaion of h^s discourse, and of the remedies against childrens anger.
The first is a good instruction.
SVch minds therefore are to be tempered and nourished, and to be animated
with delights. And because we are to use some remedies against Anger, some
other against sadness, and that these are not only to be cured by different,
but contrary means. We will always have a care of that, which is increasing.
It shall profit very much say I, to have our children well instructed in the
beginning. But the manner of governing is difficult, because we must endeavor
that we nourish not Anger in them, or dull and dampe their spirits. The matter
had need of diligent observation. The second is to keep measure and neither to
ani^ate or discourage them too much, and how we ought to proceed.
For both that which is to be extolled and that which is to be depressed is
nourished with the like, and such things as resemble do oftentimes deceive
him, that is most diligent. The mind increases by liberty, and is embased by
servitude. Praise the same, and it rowseth it self, and fills us with great
expectation, yet both these two expedients engender insolence and wrath. So
therefore is he to be governed between both, that sometimes we use a bridle,
sometimes a spur, that his mind may suffer nothing that is base and servile.
Let him never have need to entreat any thing humbly, neither let it profit him
though he has so submissiuely entreated. If we grant him any thing, let it
be rather by alleging unto him, that he has just cause to demand the same,
and that we have regard unto his former behavior, and hope that he will do
better hereafter, as he promises. In his exercises amongst his companions,
let us neither suffer him to be overcome, nor to be angry. Let us endeavor
that he may be always familiar with those with whom he is wont to contend,
and that in his exercises he accustom himself not to have a will to hurt,
The third that the^ be not en^^^^ained either too idl^ly or too daintily.
but to overcome. As often as he has gotten the upper hand, or has done any
thing that is praise worthy, let us not suffer him to be proud or to boast
thereof, for boasting follows joy, and pride and to much esteem of himself,
boasting. We will give him some recreation, yet will we neither suffer him to be
slothful or idle, and above all things will detain him from the touch of
pleasures. For nothing more inkindleth wrath, then an over delicate and dainty
education: and therefore the only child, to whom we give liberty, and these
Pupils that are left to their own pleasures, are ordinarily the most
corrupted. The child that has had his will in every thing, whose mother has
ordinarily dried the tears from his eyes, who has had a master assigned him
according to his own^ fancy, will never suffer an injury patiently. See
thou how every greater Fortune is attended with a greater anger? This
appears in Rich men, in Noble men, in Magistrates esp^cially when as
whatsoever vainenesse and leuitie was in their brains, finds a fit Wind to
carry it away. Felicity nourishes wrath, as soon as the troops of
flatterers are encamped about proud men. The fourth to beware of flatte^e^^.
They will say unto thee. What shall he answer thee, thou respectest not thy
self according to the greatness of thy Estate, thou abasest thy self
overmuch And other such like sufficient to entangle the wisest hearts, and
such as have b^^ne prudently brought up from there infancy. Let childhood
therefore be far remou^d from flattery. Let him h^are nothing but truth, let
him learn f^ar^, modesty, obedience to his elders, and duty, and reverence.
Let him extort nothing from thee by frowardness. That which was denied him
when he wept, let it be given him when he is quiet. Let him see his Parents
riches, but not use them: Let him be reproved for his evil deeds.

CHAP. XXII.
IT shall be to the purpose to give children ^uch Masters and attendants, What
masters we ought to provide for our children.
who are peaceable and gentle. That which is tender lays hold on that which
is nearest unto it, and grows with it, and becomes like unto it. Diverse
children that have grown in years, have represented the manners of their
Nurses and masters. A young child brought up with Plato, returned home to his
Parents house, and hearing his Father exclaim and chide grievously said, I
have never seen the like with PLATO. How children should be fed and clothed.
I doubt not but that he imitated his father sooner then Plato. Let his diet be
always slender. Let his attire be modest and answerable to that of his equals.
He shall never be angry that any is compared with him, whom from the
beginning thou have made equal with many. But these things appertain unto our
children. For in regard of our selves the fortune of our birth, and of our
bringing up cannot give any place unto correction, nor for the precepts to
instruction. We must only provide for the time to come, and resist the first
occasions. But the cause of anger is the opinion of injury, whereunto we must
not easily give credit nor entertain the first reports and proofs how evident
and manifest soever they be. A remedy of Anger is not to give credit to
tale-bearers.
For some things that are fallen have an appearance of truth, we must always
give time: for time discovers truth. Let not our ears be open unto
Tale-bearers. Let this vice of humane nature be suspected by us, and made
known unto us, that is to say, that what we unwillingly hear, we unwillingly
believe, and before we judge, we are angry.

CHAP. XXIII.
WHat? The second to fly suspicions.
are we not only moved and enforced by accusations, but also travailed with
suspicions? and interpreting we not the worst of other men's looks and smiles;
are we not displeased with those that are innocent? We must therefore plead
with our selves, the cause of him that is absent, and hold our anger in
suspense. For a man may exact the punishment which is delaied, but he cannot
remedy it after it is executed. See Laertius lib. 9. of the laws of the
Philosophers and Plutarch his lives.
The Tyrant killer is well known, who being apprehended before his attempt was
performed and tortured by Hippias to the end he should discover his
confederates: he reckoned up the names of all the Tyrants friends that stood
about him, who in his knowledge were most careful of his prosperity and life,
and when he had commanded every one of them to be slain, whom he had
nominated, he asked him: Is there any more, yet remaining? Thy self (said he)
only for I have left none else alive that is dear unto thee: Wrath was the
means that made the Tyrant to lend his assistance to the Tyrant killer, and to
murder his own Guard, with his own sword^ How more courageously dealt
Alexander? who when he had read his mothers Epistle; wherein he was admonished
that he should beware to be impoysoned by his Physician Philip, drunk of his
presented potion without any affright. He had more confidence in his friend,
and worthy was he to enjoy so upright a Physician, and worthy to make such a
one. This praise I in Alexander the more, because no man was more subject unto
anger, and the rarer government is in Kings, the more is it to be commended.
The like did Caius Caesar who in the Civil wars demeaned himself so
mercifully. For having intercepted a packet of diverse letters that were written
to Pompey, from those that seemed to have held the contrary part, or remained
neuters, he burned them all, and al^hough he were accustomed to keep a
measure in his wrath, yet liked he better to admit no means. He held it to be
a most grateful means of pardon to be ignorant of that wherein every man had
offended. Credulity does much mischief and often times we ought not to give
^are thereunto because in somethings it is better to be deceived then to
distrust.

CHAP. XXIIII.
Evils occasioned by opin^on and suspicion.
SVspition and conjecture which are two betrayers of the mind, are to be
banished. He has not saluted me kindly enough; He has not kissed me
heartily; He has abruptly cut of our discourse; he invited me not to supper;
That man's countenance was more strange then it was accustomed. Suspicion wants
no argument: we have need of simplicity, and the friendly interpretation of
things. Let us believe nothing, but that which is subject to the eye, and
manifest, and as long as our suspicion appears to be vain, let us chide our
credulity. For this Chastisement will accustom us to believe nothing easily.

CHAP. XXV.
The third remedy against dager is not to be agr^^^ed for ^^le and ab^^ct
things.
FRom thence, does this follow, that we be not exasperated by the smallest and
most ^ordid things. The Page is scarce serviceable that either ministers
water to warm for our wine, or a bed to sit upon unmade, or a table
negligently furnished. To be angry hereat, is but madnsse, he is sick, and
of an evil constitution whom a little breath of wind causes to quiver. Those
eyes are very weak, which are dimmed by beholding a white vesture: he is over
delicate that sweateth to see another man labor. It is reported that there was
a certain man of Sibaris who was called Mindyrides who beholding one that
dug the Earth, and lifted his mattocke too high, began too commplaine
himself as if he himself had traveled much, and forbad the other to work
any more in his presence. The same man likewise complained oftentimes, because
he lay upon a bed of rose leaves. Whereas pleasures have inthraled both the
mind and the body there is nothing that seems tolerable, not because they
are hard, but in that effeminate men suffer them. For what is the cause, why
any man's cough, or sneesing, or a Fly not curiously enough driven away, should
incense us, or a cup ouerturned, or a key lost by the carelessenesse of a
negligent servant should trouble us? Will such a man peaceably endure a public
slander, and reproaches urged against him, in declamations and open Court, that
cannot abide to bear the scraping of a stool that is drawn by him? will he
suffer hunger and extreme thirst in a winters voyage, who is angry with his
Page, because he has not mixed his snow with his wine cunningly.

CHAP. XXVI.
THere is nothing therefore, The fourth to re^rain impa^ience in regard of
these things that are without life and in regard of men and beasts.
that more nourishes Anger then intemperate and impatient dissoluteness, the
mind is to be hanled hardly that he may not feel the stroke: except it be
grievous. We are angry with these from whom we neither could receive injury,
or those from whom we might receive it. Some of the first are without sense, as
we have been wont often times to cast by a book that is written in small
letters, and have torn a faulty, or as we cut our garments by reason they are
not pleasing unto us in their fashion. How fond a thing is it to be angry with
these which have not deserved our displeasure, neither feel the same? But we
are angry with those that made them. First, we are angry almost ordinarily
before we bethink our selves of this distinction, again happily the very
workmen themselves will give us sufficient satisfaction. One of them could not
do better then he did, neither was he negligent in his occupation, upon
purpose to displease thee. Another did it not to offend thee. In conclusion,
what is more braine-sick then to discharge and vent the choler, we have
gathered upon things that have no sense? And as it is a folly to be angry with
these that are inanimated creatures, so is it as foolish to be displeased with
dumb beasts, because there is no injury except it proceed from discourse and
deliberation. They can therefore hurt us as iron or a stone, but they cannot
do us injury. But some there are that think themselves to be contemned,
whereas some horses that are easily backed by another horseman, are sturdie to
another man's riding, as if by judgment, not by custom, and the art of
handling them, some beasts are intractable to some men.

CHAP. XXVII.
But as it is a foolish thing to be angry with these; To refrain impatience
and not to be angry with infants.
so ought not a man to be displeased with little children, or against those
that have as little spirit as infants. For all these faults in the eye of an
equal Judge are reputed for innocence of imprudent men. Some things there are
which cannot hurt, and have no power, but that which is beneficial and
wholesome, as the immortal gods which neither will, neither can hurt. For their
nature is mild and peaceable, and so far remote from doing other men injury
as themselves. Mad are they therefore, and ignorant of truth, Much less
against the gods.
that impute unto them the raging of the Seas, in measurable showers, a
rigorous winter, when as in the mean space there are none of these which
either hurt or profit us, that are properly intended against us. For we are not
the cause in this world of the revolution of Winter and Summer, these seasons
are governed and have their order disposed by the gods; we estimate our selves
too highly, if we suppose our selves worthy that so great things should be
moved for us. There are none of these things therefore is done to our
prejudice, nay rather there is nothing done which is not for our good: we have
said that there are some things which cannot hurt, some things which will not^
In this rank shall be good Princes, Nor against our superiors in this World.
Parents and Masters, Judges and Magistrat^s, whose chasticement ought to be
considered, as the razor of a Surgeon, the diet of a Physician, and other
remedies, which neither do us good nor evil. Are we chastised, let us think
not only on that which we suffer, but also on that which we have done, and let
us enter into the examination of our life. If we will confess a truth unto
our selves, we have a greater matter to charge our selves with. If we will be
equal Judges of all things, let us first of all persuade our selves that there
is none of us without a fault. For hence grows the greatest indignation; I
have sinned no ways, I have done nothing; nay, thou confessest nothing. If any
man admonish or chastise us we are angry, when at that very time we sin.
When as to our rebellious deeds we add arrogancy and contumacie. Who is he
that dare maintain that he is innocent, in respect of all laws? That this may
be thus, how defective is our innocence, in regard of good laws? how more
infinitely is the rule of our duties extended then that of right? how much do
piety, humanity, liberality, misery, and faith, exact all which are not
enclosed in the ordinances and constitutions of men.

CHAP. XXVIII.
The fi^th is t^ th^^ke (...) how many sorts men a^e guilty before God and M^n.
NEither as yet can we attain to that strict innocence of the laws. We have
done some things, and thought other things. We have desired some things and
have followed others. We are innocent in some affairs, because we could not
effect them. Thinking hereupon, let us be more favorable to those that offend.
More attentive to those that reprove us, and let us not be displeased with our
selves (for with whom will we not be angry, if we be displeased against our
selves?) above all things let us beware to be angry with the gods. For it is
not by their ordinance, but by the law whereunto all mortal men are subject,
that we suffer all these incommodities which befall us. But sicknesses and
sorrows do assault us. They that dwell in a rotten house must seek to fly
out of it by some ways. When it shall be told thee that any one has spoken
evil of thee, bethink thy self whether thou have not begone it first, examine
thy self by how many thou have spoken. Let us think, say I, that other men
do us no injury, but that they requite us with the like, and that some do it
of malice, some by constraint, and others through ignorance, and that they
likewise who willingly and wittingly do wrong; take not an occasion by the
injury we have done, to do us another. Either is he fallen through the
sweetness of his vrbanitie, or has done somewhat, not with an intent to hurt
us, but because he could not have attained his desire except he had repulsed
us. Oft-times flattery offends us whilst she flattereth; whosoever shall
remember himself how often times men have had an evil opinion of him, and
interpreted the many good services and offices he has done for injuries, how
many men he has loved whom he hated before time, he will not be displeased
upon the first, especially if upon every injury that is done unto him, he say
unto himself. These faults likewise have I my self committed. But where will thou find a Judge that is so upright? He that coueteth every man's wife, and
thinks it a sufficient cause for him to love her, because she is a stranger
will not admit another man to court his. He that will have another man keep
promise upon a prefixed day, is no master of his word, the perfidious man
persecuteth him that is a lier, and the informer cannot abide that another man
should bring him in question. He will not have his servants credit touched who
is negligent of his own reputation. Other men's sins are before our eyes, our
own behind our backs. Thence comes it that the Father more riotous then his
Son, yet reproves him bitterly for his lavish expense, he severely taxes
another man's excess, who is himself prodigal and has no hold of his money:
the Tyrant is displeased against the murderer, and he that is sacrilegious
punishes theft. The greater part of men are angry with sinners, The sixth is
to take time and be^hinke our selves before we be angry.
but not with the sin. We shall be more moderate if we examine our selves, if
we take couns^ile of our selves, and examine whether we our selves have not
committed the like, whether we have erred in the same manner? Is it fit for us
to condemn the same? Delay is a sovereign remedy against displeasure,
neither require thou her in the beginning to pardon thee, but to judge thee. If
she delay and admits any intermission, the fury thereof is abated. Strive
not to attempt her all at once, her first assaults are most sharp, but thou
shall get the day of her, if thou dismember her by little and little.

CHAP. XXIX.
TOuching those things which offend us, Reasons why we should d^lay.
some are told us, and some we hear, or see: we must not easily believe those
things that are told us, many men lie to the end they may deceive, many because
they are deceived. This man curries favor by accusing others, and faineth an
injury to the intent he may seem sorrowful for that which is done. There are
some so wicked that they seek nothing more but to sow contention amongst
friends. Another is suspicious and desirous in security, and from a-farre to
behold a single combat, performed betwixt two, whom he has set together by the
^ares. A notable comparison to this purpose.
If thou were made a Judge in a trifeling matter, thou would not allow the
cause, except it were approved by witnesses, and the witnesses thou would not
respect except they were sworn. Thou would call both parties before thee,
and give them time to answer, and yield them audience upon several days. For
truth will the more manifestly appear the more often it is debated upon. Will thou condemn thy friend instantly before thou have heard him, and before thou
have asked him the ques^ion? art thou angry with him before he either know his
accuser or his crime? For at this instant, yea now presently, have thou heard
what was spoken on both sides. That very man, who first informed thee, will not
justify his words, if he be driven to prove them. Thou have no cause, says
he, to drive me to justify it, if I b^ brought in question I will deny the
same, or otherwise hereafter I will never tell thee any thing. At the same time
he inciteth thee and draws himself out of the trouble and danger. He that
will not speak unto thee, except it be in secret scarcely tells thee any thing
that is worthy thy belief. What is more unreasonable then to believe a secret
report, and afterward to be openly angry?

CHAP. XXX.
THere are somethings whereof we our selves are witnesses. The seventh is to
consid^r the persons, to endure that which is pos^ible.
In these we will consider the nature and will of those that do them. Is he a
child? we bear with his age, he knows not whether he offends. Is he a
father? either before times he has done us so much good, that upon just ground
we ought to forgive him the wrong he might do us, or peradventure we are
offended without cause, and he himself has an occasion to complain against
us. Is she a woman? She is deceived. Is he commanded? who except he will be
injurious will be angry with necessity. Is he hurt? It is no injury to
suffer that which thou thy self proferedst first. Aduertisements wo^thy to be
consid^r^d o^ all men, especially of those who are subject ^o displeasure.
Is he a Judge? Rather trust thou his opinion then thine own. Is he a King? if
he punish thee being guilty acknowledge his justice, if being innocent, give
place to thy fortune. Is it a dumb beast, or a stone, or such like? thou art
like unto it if thou be angry at it. Is it sickness or calamity? It will
pass more lightly if we suffer it patiently. Is it God? Thou loosest as much
time in murmuring at him, as when thou prayest him to be angry against thy
neighbor. Is he a good man that does thee injury? Believe it not. Is it an
evil? Wonder not. Another man shall punish that wrong which he offers thee,
and he himself in doing evil is punished by himself. There are two things as
I have said, that provoke Anger: Of the second sort o^ r^m^di^s against Anger.
the first is, if we seem to have received injury. Of this there is
sufficiently spoken. It remains that we speak of the second, that is to say,
whether we have been wrongfully injured. Some men judge those things to be
injurious, which they ought not to have suffered, some because they hoped it
not. We repute those things injurious which are sudden. Those things therefore
most greatly move us, which happen unto us, contrary to our hope and
expectation; neither is there any other cause why the least matters offend us
amongst our Domestiques, and why in our friends we call negligence an injury.

CHAP. XXXI.
HOw therefore, says he, do our enemies injuries move us? Because we expected
them not, The first remedy i^ to r^noun^e ^he love of our s^lues, to know and
cond^mne ou^ ^gno^^nce (...).
or rather because we imagined not that they should be so dangerous. The too
much love we bear our selves is the cause hereof, and that it is which makes
us judge that our enemies should not touch us any ways. Every man has the
heart of a King in him, so that he will have authority over all men, and yet
himself will be under no man's subjection. Against our ignorance.
So therefore it is either our ignorance in things, or our insolence that
makes us Angry. As touching ignorance, are we to wonder if wicked men do
wicked acts? Is it a new thing if our enemy do us the worst injury he may? If
our friend forget himself sometimes? if our son or servant commit some fault?
That great Captain Fabius said that this ordinary excuse, I had not thought
it, was a base one: but I think it a most abject thing in a man. Bethink thy
self of all things and expect, even in good manners there will be some^hing
harsh; man's nature bears with trayt^rous friends, she endures ungrateful
men, she suffers the covetous, she winketh at the impious. When thou will
censure the manners of one man, think upon the public; where thou will most
of all rejoice, there most of all will thou fear; where all things seem unto
thee peaceable, there shall not want such things as shall hurt thee, yet lie
they covered; think that will be somewhat hereafter that may offend thee. A
Pilot has never so cunningly discharged himself of all straights and
perrilous passages, but that he has always an eye to his Anchor and tackle,
to have all things in a readiness when need requires. Against insol^n^e.
Before all things remember thy self of this, that the power to do evil is
villeinous, execrable, and wholly unfitting for a man by whose benefits the
wildest beasts are tamed. Behold the Elephants kept under yoke, children and
women riding boldly upon the backs of Bulls, Serpents that slide upon the
tables, and slip into the bosoms of men without doing them any harm, and
Bears and Lions within doors, that suffer their mouths to be handled, and
fawn upon their Masters. Thou would be ashamed to change thy manners with
brute beasts. It is a heinous crime to hurt a man's country, and therefore a
Citizen likewise, for he is a part of his country. The parts are holy if the
whole be venerable, therefore man to man, for h^ is a Citizen in this great
City, which we call the world. What if the hands would harm the feet, and
the eyes would not help the hands? Even as all the members are accorded
together, A worthy induction of sweetness and good carrage toward our neighbors.
because that it imports the whole body, that the parts whereof it is
composed should be entire; so ought we to support one another, because we are
made to live in society. But this society cannot continue, if the parts of
the same assist not and maintain not one another. We would not fli^ from
Vipers, and Serpents that haunt the water, and other creatures that are
hurtful, either in their biting or stinging, if we could tame them, or keep
them either from hurting our selves or other men. We will not therefore strike
a man because he has offended, but to the end he offend no more, neither is
punishment ever reserved to the time past, but that which is to come, because
it is not ordained to entertain Anger, but to prevent it: for if every one
should be punished that has a depraved and offensive mind, no man should be
exempt from punishment.

CHAP. XXXII.
But wrath has some pleasure in it, and it is a contenting thing to be
revenged. The refutation of their false opinion, that think it a great good to
work other men's evil.
It is far otherwise. For even as it is an honest thing in regard of
benefits, to return a good turn for a good turn; so is it not in requiting
injuries with injuries: in the one it is a dishonest thing to suffer our selves
to be overcome, and in the other to overcome. This word revenge is full of
inhumanitie, and yet is entertained for a wise thing, and differs from
contumely in nothing but in order. He that requiteth one injury with another,
offends more excusably. A certain inconsiderate fellow struck Cato in the
Bath, for who is he that had known him that would do him injury? and yielding
him afterward some satisfaction, Cato said unto him, I remember not that thou
did strike me. He thought it a wiser part not to acknowledge the wrong then
to revenge it. Think thou that he was not iniuried in receiving this
outrage? In no sort. He did himself much good, for he began to know what Cato
was. It is the part of a great mind to despise injuries: it is a contumelious
kind of revenge, that he thought him unworthy to revenge himself on. What
magnanimity is.
Many whilst they revenge themselves for every slight offense, have made their
injury the greater. That man is great and noble, that after the manner of a
mighty wild beast, listneth securely the barking of lesser Dogs: but, says
he, we shall be contemned less, if we revenge the injuries we receive. If we
come thereunto as to a remedy, let us come without Anger; not as if it were a
pleasing thing to be revenged, but because it is profitable: but oftentimes it
has bin more wisdom to dissemble then to revenge.

CHAP. XXXIII.
An answer to the r^ply that to revenge a man's self is to make himself feared
by all men.
BUT those injuries that are done us by mighty men are not only to be suffered
joyfully, but patiently. They will do it again, if they believe they have done
it. Those minds whom Fortune has made insolent have this detestable quality
in them that they hate those whom they have harmed. Famous and memorable is his
speech who was become old in the service of Kings, when a certain man asked
him: The misery of old Courtiers.
How he had attained so rare a thing, as old age in his service in Court? By
suffering injuries (says he) and by giving thanks. Often times it is so
profitable not to revenge injury, that it beseems us not to confess the
same. Caius Caesar having imprisoned the son of one Pastor a famous Knight of
Rome, being offended with the niceness of his attire and the curious frizling
of his hair. when his Father required him to grant him his sons life, as if
he had been admonished to punish his misdeeds, commanded him forthwith to be
put to death, yet least he should seem to behave himself too cruelly toward
the Father, he invited him to supper the same day. Pastor came thither with a
merry countenance, Caesar carowsed to him nine ounces of wine, and set an
attendant expressly to see whether he did him reason. The poor man drunk up
all, as if he had drunk the blood of his son. After this, he sent him
perfumes and a crown; commanding the messenger to observe whether he took
them he received them the same day, wherein he had buried his son. The poor
guest of a hundredth years of age, and such a one as was troubled with the
gout, lay almost soused in wine, yet drunk he up such large potions, that
might seem intolerable, had he banquetted at his childrens birthday, yet shed
he no tears, neither suffered he any sign of grief to slip from him. He
supped as if he had gotten his sons pardon. Do thou ask me why? He had
an other: what did Priamus? A notable example of Achilles.
dissembled he not his displeasure? embraced he not the Kings knees? he
applied those fatal hands to his reverend lips that were imbrewed with the
blood of his son; he supt, and yet without perfumes, without crowns; and
him did his cruel enemy exhort with many comfortable speeches to eat his
meat, not to the end he might empty hugh cups, setting a watch over his
head to observe him. He had contemned Pastor had he feared, but now piety
pacified his wrath. He was worthy to have liberty, to depart from the banquet
to gather up his sons bones: yet suffered he not this. Mean while that
courtous and gentle young man invited the good old Father, provoked the Father
in merry cups to bury and pacify his cares. Contrariwise, Pastor fained
himself merry, and forgetful of that which had happened the same day. His
other son had died likewise, had not the Father and guest pleased the tyrant
Caligula, that invited him.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
With whom soever we are to deal withal, Choler is unnecessary. And this
consideration is the second remedy.
SO then we ought to avoid wrath whether it be with our equal, with our
superiors or inferiors. To strive against our equals is a matter doubtful,
against our superiors is fury, against our inferiors is baseness. It is the
part of a silly and miserable man to bite him that biteth him. Gnats and Ants
turn there heads back to bite if a man layholde of them. Weak Creatures
suppose themselves hurt if they be touched. It will make us more united, if we
bethink our s^lues, how much he may profit us hereafter with whom we are
angrie^ and the offenses will be redeemed with mercies. Here is some abrupt
breaking of.
Let us also think on this what comm^ndation the fame of Clemency will yield
unto us, and how many has pardon made profitable friends. Neither let us be
angry with the children of our adversaries and enemies. Amongst the examples of
Syllaes cruelty this is not on of the least, that he deprived all their
children who were proscribed from all public office and authority. It is an
extreme injustice for a man, to make any one the heir of that hatred which he
has borne to his Father? As oftentimes as we shall be slow in pardoning, let
us bethink us whether it should be good for us, that all the men of the World
should be so affectioned against us. How often times does he require pardon,
who would not pardon? and how often has a man humbled himself at such another
man's feet, whom he before time has driven out of his presence. What is more
glorious then to change enmity into amity. The third remedy to give them the
upper hand, whom we have the advantage of.
What more faithful confederates have the people of Rome, then these who were
their most mortal enemies. What should the Empire be at this day, except
wholesome providence had mixed the conquered with the conque^ors. Shall any man
be angry with thee? reconcile thou him by thy benefits. The displeasure
suddenly qualeth when as the one part forbeareth to contend. No man fights
except he be re^isted. The fourth to give place to such as are quarrelsome.
If both parts are contentious he has the better hand, that first retireth him
self, and he is conquered that overcomes. Has he stricken thee? fly back,
for in striking him again thou shall give him both occasion to strike often
and an excuse for striking: thou can not be parted from him when thou will.
Would any man strike his enemy so grievously, that he should leave his hand
in the wound, and could not recall himself from the stroke? but wrath is such
a weapon as it cannot scarcely be recalled.

CHAP. XXXV.
WE furnish our selves with convenient arms with a sword not long or over
short, The fi^t to discharge our sel^es of that which hinders us so much as
Anger does.
shall we not avoid the impulsions of the mind more grievous, more furious,
and irrevocable then these? we take pleasure in that Gelding that staieth as
soon as he is rayned in, that keeps him in his ordinary pace, that knows
when to turn, and which may easily be brought back to the place where he
began his first carier. We know that our nerves are out of frame, when as they
are moved against our wills. He is either aged or of a weak constitution who
when he would walk, runs: we suppose those motions of the mind to be the
healthfullest and strongest, which are disposed at our pleasure and not as they
list. But nothing has profited us so much as first, The sixth consideration,
the deformity of Anger.
to behold the deformity of a thing, and afterward the danger. There is no
passion more deformed then this which spoyleth the fairest faces of the World
and makes those eyes dreadful which before time were peaceable. All
seemelines abandoneth those that are angry, and if he be as decently arrayed
as any man can desire, he will draw his gown aside, The description of wrath
both i^ b^die and mind.
and will cast of all care of himself. If the hair of his head be naturally
or artificially well trimmed, a man shall see it stare and stand upright. If
the spirit be moved, the veins swell, the breast is shaken with violent
breathing, the voice in issuing forth puffs up the neck with fury. The
joints tremble, the hands shake, all the body is tossed like a Pinnace in a
tempest. In what estate think thou is the mind inwardly, when such
deformity shows it self outwardly? How more terrible is the inward
countenance? how more violent the breath? how more intended the passion, which
would burst it self, A living description of anger.
unless she enforced her passage? Such is their countenance, as the enemy
has, or wild beasts imbrued with slaughter, or of such as are addressed to
spoil and slaughter. So deformed furies as the infernal monsters are imagined
by the Poets; begirt with Serpents and breathing fire. Such as the most
dreadful monsters of Hell assume unto themselves, when they issue forth to
inkindle wars, to sow discord amongst Nations and to dismember peace. In such
manner should we picture out anger, that has fiery fury in her eyes, a cry
compounded of puffing, lowing, mourning, and other such confused and dreadful
noyces, shaking in both her hands her dierfull weapons without care of
covering her body, frowning, covered with blood and wounds: yea mortified with
strokes which she has given her self, her gate ridiculous and furious, all
her behavior confused and confounded, running here and there to overthrow all
that which she meets with all, hated of all, and above all things wishing her
own death. And if she cannot do worse, desirous to tear Heavens, Seas and
Earth, from their places, in brefe no less hurtful then hateful. Or if a man
will behold her in such sort as our Poets describe her: She in her hand shakes
a bloody whip.
or, Having her cote or in many pieces rent,
And with the blood of guiltlsse men bespre^t.
Or if any man may imagine any more horrible face of a horrible passion.

CHAP. XXXVI.
The use of a glass good to re^raine Choler.
SOme (says Sextius) that were angry have profited themselves by looking into
a looking glass, for they were troubled in beholding so great a change in
themselves, in that they knew not themselves at that time. But how little was
that which this image reflected from the glass to represent and express their
true filthiness and deformity? if the mind might have been seen, and might
shine, and show it self in any matter, she would confound us in beholding her
so sordid, so enraged, so deformed, and puffed up. And now as yet her
lothsomenesse is so great, that she passes through bones, and flesh, and
whatsoever other impediments. But what if she were seen naked. For I believe
that no man is terrified from wrath by beholding a glass: what then? he that
came unto a looking glass to reform himself, had already conformed
himself. They that are angry have no seemly countenance, their looks are
dreadful and cruel, and such would they seem to be as they desire to be.
Rather ought we to consider this how many men wrath has armed to wound
themselves. The seventh remed^e, is to c^^side^ how many men he has rained.
Some through to much rage have burst there veins, and by force of crying have
vomited blood, and abundance of humor being thrust into their eyes has dulled
and dimmed the sight and the cleernesse thereof, and such as were sick have
relapsed into diseases. There is no more swifter way unto madness then this.
Many therefore have continued the fury of their wrath, neither could recover
again that understanding that they themselves exiled. Fury provoked A^^x to
death, and wrath put him in fury. They wish death to their children, poverty
to themselves, ruin to their houses^ and deny themselves to be Angry,
resembling those that are furious, who being enraged say they are not mad. Most
friendly to their enemies, most dangerous to their dearest friends, forgetful
of Laws except they may hurt thereby, incensed upon the least occasion:
neither affable in speech nor company or intertainment. They do all things
forcibly, they are addressed to fight with their swords and to die on their
swords. For a mighty evil has surprised them, and such as exceeds all
other vices. Other sins enter by little and little, the force hereof is
sudden and universal. To conclud she keeps all other affections in
subjection, and conquereth the most vehementest love. The conclusion is that
choler is an extreme evil and the rather because it spares no other vices.
They have therefore murdered the bodies whom they have loved, and even
enfolded in there arms: whom they have fitted to their graves. Wrath has
spurned at avarice, the most indurate and least flexible evil, enforcing her to
scatter her riches, and to set fire on his house and goods, when they were all
gathered together. What has not the ambitious man cast away his so long
affected tokens and titles of majestracie, and repulsed that honor which was
offered unto him? There is no affection over which wrath has no power.

The end of the second Book of Anger.
A TREATISE OF ANGER, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO HIS FRIEND NOVATVS.
The third Book.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
HE prosecuteth the other part of the remedy against Anger, which he placed
in the midst of his former Book, but differred the same. That we sin not in
Anger, that is that we refrain the same and repress it; which is performed
in diverse sorts. But it must be done always and presently in a headlong, and
unbridled affection which ARISTOTLE excuset^h: But he accuses him, and once
more discovers the loathsomenes of Anger. These things performs he until
the fourth Chapter. Then grows he to division alleging that he will speak
of three things. First, how we may not be angry. Secondly, how we may be
freed from Anger. Thirdly, how we may pacify and please such a one as is
Angry. These although in other places he performs with repetition of the
former, yet performs he it worth^ly, and profitably till the end of the
Book: and thou shall have golden and divine admonitions and sayings.

CHAP. I.
To refrain wrath in such manner as we o^^ht, we must lea^ne the natures of
men that are attainted th^rewith.
NOW, my Nouatus, will we attempt to do that which thou thy self have most
instantly desired, namely, how we may root out Anger out of our minds, or at
leastwise bridle it and inhibite the assaults thereof. This must be done
sometimes openly and in all men's sight, when as yet the force of the evil is as
yet so small as it cannot endure it: sometimes secretly when as it is to much
inflamed and is exasperated and increases upon every impediment. We must
consider what forces she has, and how entire they be. Whether she is to be
chastised and driven back, or whether we ought to give pl^ce unto her, whilst
the first tempest be pacified for fear least she carry away those remedies
with her, that should reclaim her: and consideration is to be had, according
to every ones manners. For some are overcome by prayers, some insult, and are
exasperated by submission: Some are overcome with terrors^ some has reproof,
other some confession, the third has shame revoked from their purpose, and
some by delay, which is the true though slowest remedy of these so headlong
passions, whereunto at the last we must descend. For other affections admit
delay, and may be healed by little and little, but the sudden and headlong
violence of Anger proceeds not leasurely, but is wholly entire in the
beginning. Neither does she solicit men's minds after the manner of other
vices, but she transporteth them, but vexes them being no Masters of
themselves, and that are as desirous of their own evil as of an others. She
shows her self not only furious against that she undertakes, but against
all that which casually encountereth her in the way. All other vices incite the
mind, wrath casts i^ down headlong. The rest although they cannot resist
their affections, at least the passions themselves maintain themselves, this
no otherwise then lightning and tempest and other impressions of the air
(which are sudden and fall in an instant) reinforceth it self and increases
more and more. These other vices are estranged from reason, this is wholly
destitute, and is a fury. The rest have light accessions and decieueable
increases; in wrath the minds of men are prostituted and dejected. There is no
passion more astonished, that urges more, nothing that imployeth his forces
more desperately, and swiftly, or whether it be that she get the upper hand
(which makes her more proud) or whether she has been repulsed (which
inflameth her with fury) she gives not over, neither retireth although she
have been repulsed; and when Fortune presents her not with any adversary
she strikes and biteth her self, provided that she may maintain her self:
For her beginings are small, but she becomes maruellously great.

she excepteth no kind of men. Some Nations through the benefit of poverty a^e
exempted from dissolution, neither know they what it is: some others have fled
Idleness, because they are still in travel and wander from one Country to an
other. They that live rudely and rustikely have never used trumperies, nor
fraud, nor any of those mischeefes which are bred in places more frequented.
There is no Nation under Heaven, whether they be Greeks or Barbarians, how
puissant soever they be, that can say that they are exempted from the assaults
and instigations of anger, no less pernicious to those, who are subject to
certain Laws, as to those whose Law is force and amongst whom the strongest
is the greatest. To conclude those other passions invade men in particular^ but
wrath is the only passion that lays hold upon all men. Never was it seen,
that one only Nation was supprised with the love of one only woman. Neither
has a whole City fixed their hopes upon money and lucre. Ambiton seazeth this
or that man only. Tyranny has not dominion in all places. But oftentimes
anger has possessed whole troops, men, women, old young, Princes and their
people have gathered together to satisfy Anger. And a multitude being incensed

public fury.
were moved to mutiny. Forthwith have they addressed themselves to ^ire, and
he that for his eloquence wa^ accounted gracious in all men's eyes, in the
midst of honor and the height of his Discourse, has purchased the
displeasure of the whole Assembly. The Legions have darted their Iauelins
against their general. The people have bandied against the Senate, and without
expecting the elections or the nomination of Chieftaine of the Army, have
suddenly of themselves chosen out Captains to execute their furious designs,
and rushing into the houses of men of honor, and the best Citizens, have
executed and put them to death. They have broken the laws of Nations by
outraging Ambassadors, and unspeakable fury has possessed the whole City,
they have not allowed time, to the end the public insurrection might be
pacified, but incontinently have armed their Navy, and manned it with the
first Soldiers they could get. Without order, without respect of ancient
ceremonies the people have issued forth, being guided and governed by their own
fury, laying hold on whatsoever weapons came casually to their hands, armed
themselves therewith, and ^inally by a great and miserable overthrow, have
received a ^ust punishment for their rashness and audacious ^ollie.

CHAP. III.
THis is the end of those Barbarians, who run thus inconsiderately to war,
as soon as any appearance of injury has seized their light brains: they are
suddenly moved, and whether despi^e drives, they rush in desperation into
those Regions which they intend to spoil, without apprehension of danger, or
observation of discipline; contrariwise, they seek out misfortunes, they take
pleasure to receive wounds, and to run in furiously upon the points of the
sword, and to make them way by the wounds which they received. It is not to be
doubted, say thou but that the effect of choler is very great and dangerous,
show us therefore some remedies and means how it may be healed. But as I said in
my former Books, Aristotle stands forth, and pleades for Anger, and wills us
not to extinguish it wholly in us. He ^^geth against Aristotle who maintains
Ang^r, and shows the baseness and villeiny thereof.
He alleges that it is the spur of virtue, and that if a man be deprived
thereof, his heart is disarmed, and he becomes recreant, idle, and unable to
execute any great attempts. It is very needful therefore to reprove the
villeiny and beastlines of this vice, and to set before men's eyes how monstrous
a thing it is for a man to be so hat^fully and violently bent against another,
and what fury is in him who ruinateth himself in running another, and
pretending to plunge and drown certain things in the Sea, he cannot effect
his purpose but by plunging and drowning himself. What then? Will any man call
him sensible or discreet, who being surprised as it were with a tempest goes
not but is driven, and serves a furious passion? Neither commanded other to
execute his vengeance, but he himself will be agent to perform it, having his
heart and hand stretched out to satisfy his cruelty, and without sparing
(fierce hangman that he is) his own and only friends, yea, and those whom
after he has massacred, he will presently mourn for. Is it possible that any
man should admit this p^ssion for an abbeter and companion, and virtue who
shuts out all counsels, without which virtue can execute nothing. Frail
and sinister are those ^orces, and powerful to their own prejudice, into
which the sickness and the violence of the fit have driven the sick patient.
Think not therefore that I employ my self unprofitably in defaming Anger, as
if men already doubted thereof. I do it because there are some found amongst
the Philosophers of greatest note and reputation, See Aristotle in the fourth
book of his morals^ chap. ^1.
who has pleaded for her and said that she is profitable, and animateth the
mind unto battle, and that in humane actions and all other affairs, we ought
to manage them with some vigor. But least any man should be deceived, or
should imagine, that either in a certain time and place it was a thing that
were profitable, it behooves me to discover the violent and unbridled rage
thereof, and set her do (...) withal her equipage, such as are her racks, her
nerves and strings, her Iailes her gibbets and s^akes to be burned at, and
books to dragge dead bodies, diverse sorts of shackles, diverse sorts of
tortures, the tearing of the s^esh and members, the branding in the forehead,
the dens of savage beasts. Let Anger be placed amongst all these instruments
where she may gnash her teeth, and whistle out some direful and horrible
noise, being of her self more hideous then all that whereof she makes use to
execute her fury.

CHAP. IIII.
CErtainly although we call the rest in question; The continuation of this
description, and a lively representation of Anger.
yet is there no passion more deformed then this, as in our former Books we
have presented her fierce and fur^ous, sometimes pale, having suddenly repulsed
all her blood to the heart, then inflamed again, as if her whole heat and
spirit were mounted again into her countenance, having her color bloody, her
veins swollen, her eyes sometimes quiuering an sparkling, sometimes fixed and
se^led upon something. Moreover, she has teeth that grind, crack one against
another, desiring to devour some one, and making such a noise as wild Boares
are accustomed to do when they rub and sharpen their fangs. Add hereunto the
beating of her hands and breast, her often sighs, her groans, drawn from
the depth of her heart, the agi^ation of her whole body, her speech
intercepted with sudden exclamations, her trembling lips sometime closed and
mumbling diverse menaces. I believe that the wild beasts being pressed by
famine, or that bear an arrow fixed in their entrails, yea, and then likewise
when they are at their last bay, are not so hideous as a man inflamed with
choler. But if you will spare a time to hear her speeches and menaces, which
the heart utters with tormented rage, would not every man incontinently
retire himself from such a danger, when he shall perceive that Anger begins
by his own misery? Will thou not therefore have me admonish those, who do all
that they can, to make it known, that they are choleric, and think it to be
a proof of their value, that a man transported with choler cannot be called
courageous and free, but feeble and slave unto all others? Will thou not suffer
me to advertise those that are more circumspect to look about themselves, that
some other passions of the mind do invade the wicked, but Anger steals into
the hearts of the most learned Clerks, and that otherwise behave themselves
like good men, so that some men think Anger to be a token of simplicity, and
ordinarily we suppose that he that is most honest, has his part of this
infirmity.

CHAP. V.
How hur^full wrath is, and the th^^^ principal remedies thereof.
WHereto then tends this Discourse^ To the end that no man should suppose
himself to be warranted from this passion, because she induces those men that
are modest and peaceable by nature, to become rude and violent. Even as a good
disposition of body, and the care to maintain our selves in health,
preuayleth nothing against the plague, which indifferently la^eth hold both on
w^ake and strong; so in Anger there is a danger as well for them that are
disordered, as for those men that are sober and peaceable, and have care of
themselves, the more the trouble, which Anger causes in them is great. But for
as much as the first remedy is not to be angry, the second to refrain Anger
the third to remedy another man's Anger, I will first of all show the means
how to avoid Anger, secondly, how we may discharge our selves of Anger, if it
begins to be enkindled in us; thirdly, in what sort we may pacify a man
that is displeased, and temper and reduce him to reason. We shall subdue Anger,
if from time to time we represent unto our selves all those vices that are
hatched under this passion, and if we consider the same as we ought, with all
her dependances and appurtenances; we must accuse her before our selves,
condemn her, examine her infirmities, and lay her open to view; then compare
her with the most detestable vices, to the end that as yet we may be better
instructed what she is. Avarice gathers and locketh up for a honest man that
is not covetous: wrath consumes all, and gratifieth very few, and is welcome
to none. An angry Master has driven some of his servants to run away, some
has he put to death^ when as he lost more by being angry, then that was for
which he was angry: wrath has made the father mourn, the husband to be
divorced, the magistrate to be hated, and the Candidate to be repulsed. It is
worser likewise then riot, because she takes pleasure in her own delights,
this in another man's sorrow. She surpasses malignitie and hatred; for they are
contented to see any man become unhappy, this will make them unhappy; the
other two rejoice at those evils which come casually, she cannot expect
fortune, she will hurt him whom she hates, and will not be hurt. There is
nothing so grievous as secret hatred, but wrath concealeth it. What is more
lamentable then war? therein is it that men discover their displeasures.
Moreover, that public and private Anger is a weak and forcelesse war.
Furthermore without recounting those damages which we will add hereafter, nor
of ambushes, nor of perpetual care^ which engender so many quarrels, wrath
intending to revenge her self punishes her self, she is the canker of humane
nature. For Nature inuiteth us to amity, Anger to hatred; Nature commands
us to assist one another, Anger to hate one another, the one commands us to
profit, the other to hurt. Add hereunto, that whereas indignation proceeds
from an over great suspicion of himself, and seems to be courageous, yet is
she weak and infirm; for no man is less then he by whom he suspecteth
himself to be contemned. But a man that is truly valiant, and that knows
his own worth, reuengeth not an injury, because he feels it not. Even as
arrows recoile back if they be shot at some stony and hard mark and such
solid things as are stricken, procure his grief that strikes them; so is
there no injury that may pierce a great heart, it is far weaker then that she
attempteth. How far more worthy a thing is it to despise all injuries and
contumelies, as if the mind^ were impregnable. Revenge is a confession of
pain. The mind is not great which is animated by injury. Either a stronger
then thy self, or a weaker ^ath wronged thee; if he be weaker then thy self,
spare him, if mightier support thy self.

CHAP. VI.
THere ^s no one more certain argument of true magnanimity, then if thou
resolve thy self, The effec^s of true magnanimity, approved by a fit
comparison.
that nothing may befall thee that may move thee. The highest and (...)
governed part of the world, and nearest to the stars, is not troubled with
clouds, not subject to tempests, nor afflicted with storms: there is no tumult
in the same, the inferior heavens push forth lightnings. In like sort a
sublimed and high spirit is always quiet, and placed in a peaceable station,
restrayning in himself that, whence Anger borrows an occasion of contention:
it is moderate, venerable and settled. But thou shall find none of these in an
angry man: for who is he that is betrayed to sorrow and fury, that has not
rejected his former modesty? Who is he that is turbulent in passion, and
incensed against another man, that has not dispossessed himself of all shame
fastness? What man is he that is displeased, that keeps any measure, or
remembr^th him of his due^y, or contains his tongue, who has been Master of
any on^ part of his body; who could govern himself? That notable lesson of
Democritus to find out the true repose will profit us infinitely, If we do
nothing either privately or publicly that exceeds our forces. Never do
things succeed so happily unto any man who intermedleth with many affairs,
but that sometimes by some one man, or from the affairs themselves, there
arises some fault which disposes the heart unto Anger. Even as he that
trauelleth hastily through the frequented streets of a City, must meet with
many men, and in one place ^^^p, in another be stopped, and in a third be
besprinckled with dir^; so in the travail and walks of this life, so
confouded and confused, there happen many impediments and many quarrels: the
one has deceived our hope, another has deferred it, another has intercepted
it, the events have not been answerable to our expectation. Fortune is not so
addicted to any man that she yields him every way correspondence in his
manifold attempts. It follows therefore that he knows not what it is to
endure men, nor the estate of humane affairs, who thinks that any thing
befalls him otherwise then he made reckoning of. To the end therefore that
the mind may be quiet, it is not to be ^ossed, neither as I said; troubled with
the managing of many affairs, nor to be charged with mighty affairs, and such
as exceed her strength. It is an easy matter to carry light burdens, and to
cast them from one shoulder to another, without letting them fall. But if any
one has loaded us, and the burden be heavy, we carry it with much labor, and
finally we discharge it upon those that are nearest us, or if we pant under the
burden by reason we are over laden, it is hard for us to go forwards or
backewards without staggering.

CHAP. VII.
How requisite mediocritie and temperance are in managing the affairs of this
^i^e, and intemperating and quieting the mind.
KNow thou that the same falls out in civil and domestique matters. Those
affairs that are ^as^y and light, accompany him that does them, those that
are ouer-great and exceed his might, that acts them, are uneasy to
compass, and after a man has laid hold of them, they puzzle and oppress him
that carries them: finally when he thinks that he has best hold of them,
he stumbleth, falls, and his burden rowleth down upon him, and troubles
him. Thence falls it out often times, that he who undertakes difficult
matters, and would make them easy, is frustrated of the most part of his
thoughts. In all thine enterprises, measure thy self together with those
things which thou will manage, and whereunto thou addressest thy self,
otherwise the displeasure thou shall conceive in leaving thy work imperfect,
will make thee maruellously pensive. In this place we ought to observe whether
a man be of a violent spirit, or settled, or fearful: In a generous mind,
repulse will inkindle wrath, in a faint and abject mind, sadness: Let
therefore our action be neither too small nor too audacious, nor too wicked;
let us follow those things that are answerable to our hope, let us attempt
nothing, that when we have attained the same, will make us wonder at the
success thereof.

CHAP. VIII.
Noble observations for all men.
LEt us take order that we receive not such an injury which we cannot
disgeast. Let us lead our lives with temperate and familiar men, not with those
that are troublesome and foolish: men invest their manners with whom they are
conversant. And as some infirmities of the body are derived and transported by
attouchment, so the soul communicates her infirmities and passions, to those
that approach her. A Drunkard has drawn his companion into love with wine, and
the company of dissolute fellows has effeminated a man who should be as hard
as the rock. Avarice empoysoneth those that dwell near unto her;
contrariwise, there is the same reason as is touching virtues, which moderate
all things that are with them: neither was any profitable country or wholesome
air more healthful for man's body, then for good minds that are scarce settled
to converse with good men, which thing how available it is thou shall
understand, if thou consider how wild beasts are tamed by men's handling, and
how the fiercest beast lays by his fury, if he has long time bin under the
discipline of a man. That whch is furious in her is lenified and tempered by
little and little. Moreover he that conuerseth with peaceable and good men, not
only becomes better by reason of their example, but in as much likewise as he
finds no occasions to be displeased; he is not in practice of the passion. He
ought therefore to fly from all these, who in his knowledge are disposed and
easily provoked unto Anger. And who are they, say thou? many such as upon
diverse causes will do the same. The proud man will offend thee with contempt,
the rich man with contumely, the lascivious man with injury, the hateful man
with malignitie, the quarrelsome by contention, the boaster and liar by
vanity. Thou will not endure to be feared by a suspicious man, to be overcome
by an obstinate, to be scorned by an effeminate man. Make choice of simple
facile and moderate men, who will neither provoke thee to wrath, nor be mou^d
though thou offend them. But as yet more profit shall thou reap from submisse,
courteous, and affable men, yet not so pliant as they may prove flatterers, for
too much flattery offends angry men. I had a friend and he an honest man,
but yet otherways too ready to be moved, who was as little pleased with
flattery as he was with reproof. It is well known that Caelius the Orator
was extremly choleric with whom, as it is reported, there supped a client of
his within his chamber, who was endowed with singular patience, but hard was it
for him being met with such a companion, to avoid his displeasure, with whom he
supped. He therefore thought it to be the best to smooth him up in whatsoever he
said, and to give way to him. Caelius could not endure this smoothing, but
exclaimed. Speak somewhat against me that we may be two. But he also because
being angry, he saw the other pacified and silent gave over his displeasure,
because he had no adversary. Let us therefore at leastwise make choice of
these (if we by privy to our own imperfections) that will apply themselves to
our manners and discourse, undoubtedly they will make us delicate and bring us
into an evil custom, not to give ^are to any thing that is displeasing unto
us, yet shall this profit us, that they allow us some intermission and quiet in
our error. A hard and untamed nature likewise will endure a flattering and
affable entertainment. Nothing is harsh and displeasing when we smooth and
handle it gently. As often as the disputation shall be longer or more eager, let
us resist at first before it be enforced. Contention nourishes it self and
lays hold on those that fly her. It is easier for a man to abstain from a
debate, then to retire himself.

CHAP. IX.
Moreover such as are angry ought to forbear all serious studies, The fourth
expedient against Anger is neither to charge that mind or body to much.
or at least wise they are to exercise them without lassitude, and the mind
ought not to be busied in many things, but to be entertained with more pleasing
studies. Let the reading of Poets pacifi^ him, and the ouerloking of Histories
content him with varieties, let him be handled more tenderly and delicately.
Pithagoras pacified the perturbations of the mind by his Harp. But who knows
not that Clarions and Trumpets do wonderfully move? and that there are some
strains of voice and music which make the mind tractable? Great things are
profitable for confused eyes, and there are other coulors that content the
feeble sight, and the brightness of some other does blemish them, so the study
of pleasant stories does comfort languishing spirits. We must fly the places,
the pleas, and courts where audience is given, all which do exulcerate the
mind, and beware likewise to weri^ our bodies. For lassitude consumes all
that which is sweet and plausible in us, and awakeneth that which is sharp
and stirring. For this cause they that have no good stomach intending to employ
themselves in some matters of importance, are accustomed to repress the
choleric humor which travel stirs over much, by eating some little thing,
and the rather because hunger extinguisheth natural heat, hurts the blood,
and staieth the course thereof, by reason that the veins are traveled, or
because the body being attenuated and faint incountereth the soul. Undoubtedly
for the same cause and consideration sickmen and old men are subject unto
anger. And therefore for the same causes are hunger and thirst to be avoided
because they exasperate and inflame men's minds.

CHAP. X.
The fifth expedient is, the knowledge that we ought to have of our selves and
the infirmities of our minds.
IT is an old saying, That it is easy to drive a wearied man into the frets. As
much may be said of him that is a hungry, of him that is dry, and by every
man that is displeased at any thing. For as ulcers upon every light touch, and
afterward upon a show of touching, seem painful, so the mind that is
affected, is offended with the least things, in so much as a salutation, an
Epistle, an Oration, and Interrogation provoke them to displeasure. Such as are
pained, are never touched without complaining. And therefore it is the best to
take medicine upon the first sense or appearance of the sickness, in like sort
to give no liberty to our discourses, but to refrain them carefully. But when
the passions begin to take head, and burst forth it is an easy matter to
restrain them. There are certain signs which go before a sickness. Even as
tempests and showers have certain signs before they fall, so Anger, love, and
all these storms which vex the mind; have certain tokens to presage them.
Such as are subject to the falling sickness understand that their fit is at
hand, when as the tops of their fingers and toes are cold, when their sight is
darkened, when their memory fails them, when their head turns, and their
nerves are contracted; Then have they recourse to their accustomed remedies to
prevent their fall^ that is at hand: by potions or perfumes they drive away
that sickness which in this sort alieneth their senses, with fomentations they
resist the conflict of their cold, and the rigor of their infirmity. If these
remedies relieve them not, they retire themselves apart and fall where no man
sees them. It shall profit a man much if he know his disease, and if he be
experienced to cut of the violence thereof, before it has gotten power to
exspaciate. Let us consider what it is that offends us most. One man is moved
by bitter words, another by some outrages that are offered him. This man will
have his nobility supported, that man his beauty. Such a one desires to be
reputed a gallant fellow, that other to be most learned; this man is impatient
of pride, that other of contumacie. He thinks his servants unworthy to draw
him to displeasure. The other is a Tyrant within doors, and gentle without.
Such a one thinks himself mocked, if he be entreated. That other a
contumely if he be not requested. All men are not strooken in one place.

CHAP. XI.
The sixth means to bridle Anger. Be not too curious.
THou must therefore know what is weak in thee, to the intent that most of al
thou may prevent the same: it is not expedient for us to see al things, nor
to hear all things. Let many injuries pass by us, and he that indeuoreth
himself not to know them, is for the most part waranted from the^. Will thou
not be angry? be not curious. Who inquireth what is spoken against himself?
Who will ^ound and search out what evil speeches are spoken by him secretly,
does himself disquiet himself. An evil interpretation makes us suppose that
a word which is spoken by us is a great outrage. Some things therefore are to be
differed, some things to be deludred, and somethings to be pardoned. Wrath in
diverse sorts must be circumscribed, and diverse things are to be turned to jest
and sport. They say that Socrates having received a box on the care, said
nothing else but: That it was a great fault, A notable example.
that men knew not when they should come abroad with a helmet upon their heads.
It skils not how the injury be done, but how it is suffered. Neither see I why
moderation should be a hard matter, when as I knew that the minds of certain
Tyrants being puffed up by fortune and liberty, have repressed that cruelty
which was familiar unto them. It is reported that Pisistratus a Tyrant in
Athens, when as a certain Drunken man, that sat at banquet with him, had
spoken many things against his cruelty (and there wanted not some^ who would
have executed whatsoever he should have commanded, and one man on this side,
and another on the other, labored to inkindle his displeasure) that he took
all things patiently, and answered those, that provoked him after this manner:
That he was no more angry with him; then if a blindfolde fellow having his
eyes tied up should run upon him. The greater part of men have bred quarrel
to themselves; either by suspecting false things, or by aggravating small
things.

CHAP. XII.
OFtimes Anger seeks us out, The seventh means not to seek out evil
occasions, and if they profer them selves to repulse them.
more oftentimes search we her, which is never to be called for, but even
then when we light upon her, then ought we to reject her. No man says unto
himself; This for which I am displeased, either I have done my self, or else
I might have done it. No man estimateth the mind of him, that commits the
fault, but the fact it self. Yet this is to be looked into, whether he did it
wittingly or casually; whether he were compelled or deceived; whether he did it
for hatred or reward; whether of his own accord or by another man's
instigation. Furthermore, the age and fortune of him that does this is to be
respected much, to the end we may support the one with sweetness, the other with
respect. Let us put our selves in his place against whom we are displeased; now
does the wrong estimation of our selves make us angry, and those things which
we would do we will not suffer. Each man is not patient; but the greatest
remedy against wrath is delay, that the first fury thereof may be repressed,
and that mist which dulleth our minds either may be dispersed, or be less
thick. There are some of those things which carry thee away headlong, which I
say, not a day but an hour may rectify, some of these will wholly vanish. If
in this case we demand delay, it then appears that it is not Anger but reason
that commands. What soever it be thou would know what it is, deliver it
into the hands of time. A man cannot diligently observe that which passes away
swiftly. Plato could not obtain any delay from himself when he was angry with
his servant, but commanded him presently to lay by his coat, and to yield his
shoulders to the strokes of the whip, which he himself would l^y on. After he
knew that he was angry, he withdrew his hand that was ready to strike, and
struck like unto him that was like to be stricken. Being afterward demanded
by his friend, who came thither by chance, what he did? I (says he) chastise a
man that is angry. This wiseman, astonished at this his deformed countenance
and iesture, took no more heed to his slave, because he had found another,
whom he ought rather to have chastised; he therefore deprived himself of that
authority over his servants; and notwithstanding because his servant had
committed some fault that was worthy punishment, he said unto SPEVSIPPVS, I
pray thee chastise my servant with strokes, because I am angry. He beats
him not for that which another had beaten him: I am angry, said he, I shall
do more then I should. I will do it more willingly. Let not this servant be
in his power that is not Master of himself. Will any man commit revenge to a
wrathful man, since Plato has taken his authority from himself? Let nothing
be lawful for thee as long as thou art angry: why? because thou will have all
things lawful for thee. Fight thou with thy self, if thou can not overcome
thine Anger, she begins to overcome thee; if she be hidden, if we cannot
give her issue, let us bury the signs thereof, and let us as much as in us
lies keep it hidden and secret.

CHAP. XIII.
The eighth means. Contain thine Anger inwardly, and show it not outwardly.
THis cannot be done but with great labor; for she desires to leap out to
inflame the eyes, and to change the face: but if she may once show her self
without us, she is above us. Let us hide her in the lowest retreat of our
breasts, and let her there be concealed, but so, as she transport us not; and
which is more, let us change all her signs, and all her marks to the contrary,
let our countenance be more peaceable, our voice more tempered, or pace more
settled; let us by little conform both the interior and exterior parts. It was
a sign of Anger in Socrates when he humbled his voice and spoke sparingly; for
at that time it appeared that he resisted himself. He was therefore both
perceived and reproved by his familiars; neither took he in ill part to hear
the reproof of his concealed Anger. Why should he not rejoice because many
understood his Anger, no man felt it, but it had been perceived, except he had
given his friends power to chide him, as he himself had assumed the authority
to reprove them. How much more ought we to do this? Let us entreat every one
of our dearest friends at that time, especially to use his most liberty
against us, when we are least able to endure him, neither let him flatter with
our Anger. Against so powerful an evil, and so gracious in our eyes, let us
call for our friends help whilst our eyes are opened^ and we are Masters of
our selves.

CHAP. XIIII.
Now by example expr^ss^th he the e^^ects of choler.
THey that can hardly bear Wine, and that fear the folly and insolence of
drunkenness, command their servants to carry them from the place where they
solemnize their festiuals. They that have the experience, that their
intemperance has been the cause of their sickness, forbad their servants to
give them their wills during the time of their infirmity. It is the best for
it to provide some impediments against known vices, and above all things so to
compose our minds, that although it be shaken by the most grievous and sudden
accidents that may be, it either feel not wrath, or to restrain and embase
the weight of the injury, that has been unadvisedly offered him, without
discovering his grief. That this may be done, it shall appear manifestly, if
out of a great many examples, I shall produce some few, out of which a man may
learn both how great evil anger has in it, when she uses the power of the
most mightiest men, and how much she may command, as soon as she is curbed by
a greater fear. Cambyses the King, Herodot. lib. 3.
a Prince too much subject to wine, was admonished by Prexaspes, who was one of
his Minions, to drink less, saying, That drunkenness was a loathsome thing
in a King, who was followed by all men's ears and eyes. To this he answered, To
the end thou may know (said he) that I am never out of temper, I will
presently approve that after wine both mine hands and eyes can do their
office. Hereupon he began to drink more freely then otherwise he was
accustomed, and in greater cups, and being thus laden and drunk with wine,
he commanded his son who had reproved, to get without the door of the
Palace, and laying his left hand on his head, to stand there uprightly; then
bent he his Bow, and with the Arrow he shot, divided he the young man's heart,
as he had protested to do, and opening his breast he showed him the head of the
Arrow sticking in his heart, and looking back upon the father, he said, Now
Sir, is not my hand steady? who denied that Apollo could have shot with better
level. The gods confound him, more slavish in mind then in condition; for
praising such an action whereunto it was overmuch for him to be an assistant. He
thought he had gotten a good occasion to flatter, when his sons breast was
divided into two parts, and the heart as yet panted under the wound: he should
have contested for glory against Cambyses, and challenged him to a second
proof, whether he could as rightly hit the heart of the father, as he had done
of his son. O cruel King, worthy that all his subjects bows should be bent
against him. When we have cursed him that ended his banquet^ with punishments
and funerals, we cannot but detest Praxaspes for his unnatural commendation of
the shot^ as well as Cambyses for shooting it. We see how the father should
have demeaned himself, being upon the dead body of his son, and witness of
the murder whereof he was the cause. That which is now in question appears
that choler may be suppressed. He cursed not the King, neither uttered he one
word of compassion, although his heart were as much wounded as that of his
sons. It may be said, that he deservedly devoured his words, for had he
spoken any thing as if he had been displeased, he could have done nothing that
became a father. It may seem, says he, that he behaved himself more
considerately in that case, then when he reproved Cambyses for his immoderate
drinking; and it had been better for him to have suffered him to drink wine
then blood, who having the cup in his hand, and being occupied in drinking,
suffered others to live in peace: he was therefore to be numbered for one of
those, who to their great miseries have made it manifest, how dear good
counsels cost them who are Kings favorites.

I Doubt not but that Harpagus had spoken some such like thing to his Master
Astiages King of Persia, The second example of Astiages and Harpagus.
by reason whereof he was so much incensed, that he feasted the old man with
the flesh of his children, and afterward asked him how ^ee liked the dressing.
Afterward, as soon as he saw that he was glutted with his own miseries, he
commanded their ^eads to be brought forth, and asked him, How he liked them?
The wretched man wanted no words, he faltred not in his speech, but said, With
a King every supper is pleasant. What profited he by this flattery? This, that
he^ was not invited to the relics of the banquet. I forbid not the father to
condemn the Kings action, I forbid him not to seek a condign revenge for so
horrible an injury; but this in the interim will I say, that wrath which
arises from extreme evils may be hidden, and be constrained to speak wholly
contrary to his mind. This restraint of sorrow is necessary for those
especially who haunt the Court, and are invited to Princes Tables. Thus must
they eat with them, thus must they drink, thus must they answer, thus must
they smile at their childrens funerals. Let us consider whether life be a
thing that should be so much set by, although it concern not this matter.
Shall we take pleasure to remain in so loathsome a prison? Shall we counsel
our selves to continue under the yoke of murderers? Contrariwise, we will
make it known, that in all oppressions the way of liberty is laid open to us.
If the mind be infirm and miserable through his own fault, he may end his
miseries in himself. I will say both to him that attended the King, who shot
his arrows against the hearts of his frinds, and to him whose Master glutted
the fathers stomach with his childrens bowels. Why mournest thou mad man?
Expectest thou that some enemy destroying thy nation, or that some puissant
King marching out from a far, Two ^toicall and profane resolutions, touch not
too near these rocks, left they^ sink thee.
shall revenge that injury which is done unto thee? On what side soever thou
turnest thy self, there is the end of these miseries. See thou yonder
steepie place? from thence may thou descend to thy liberty. See thou that
Sea? See thou that River or that Pit? Liberty sits in the bottom thereof.
See thou that short, withered, and fatal tree? Liberty depends thereon.
See thou thou thy throat, thy we sand-pipe, thy heart? These are the means
to escape servitude. Thou show me too dangerous and busy means to escape,
and such as require a great mind and courage. Inquire thou which is the way
to liberty? Every vein in thy body.

CHAP. XVI.
AS long therefore as there is nothing in our opinion so intolerable that it
should expel us out of life, Of the patience which is req^isit in adversities.
let us remove Anger from us in whatsoever estate we shall be. Pernicious is
she to those that serve; for indignation serves not but to increase her
torment, and the commandments that are given her seem to be more grievous and
troublesome, the more obstinately she suffers them: so the wild beast, the
more he struggles in the net, the more is he entangled: so birds, whilst
fearfully they shake off the bird-lime, entangle and snare all their feathers.
There is none so hard a yoke that so much hurts him that bears it
willingly, as him that repineth against it. The only remedy of the greatest
miseries is to suffer them willingly, and to apply himself to those
necessities which present themselves. But whereas this continency is
profitable for those that serve, so the bridling of affections, and of this
especially which is so furious and unbridled, a passion is most necessary for
Kings. All things go to wrack when fortune permits as much as Anger
persuades; neither can that power continue long which is exercised to many
men's miseries: for great men put themselves into maruailous danger, when common
fear joins those together who lament in their particular. Diverse therefore
of them have been slain by several persons, and sometimes by the whole
multitude, when sorrow has constrained them to join their displeasures in
one. But diverse have so exercised their Anger, as if it had been a Kingly
matter. Amongst these was Darius, he (after he had extinguished the Empire of
the Magies) overcame the Persians, and a greater part of the East. For having
denounced war against the Scythians that dwelt about the country, a Noble
and ancient Gentleman called Oebasus, besought him that ^e would leave one of
his children behind him, to be a comfort to his father, and content himself
with the service of two of them, he promised more then he required at his
hands, and that he would dismiss them all; hereupon he caused them to be
slain, and cast their bodies down before their fathers eyes, to the end he
might not be esteemed cruel, if he had carried them away all three.

CHAP. XVII.
But how much more facile was Zerxes, The fourth example of Zerxes and Pithius,
Herod and Plutarch.
who when Pithius the father of five sons, required the dismision of one of
them, which soever he pleased, gave him leave to choose him whom he best liked,
and afterward when he had made his choice, dividing that son into two
pieces, he cast them on either side of the way, and by this sacrifice purified
his army? But this Prince was chastised according to his demerites: for after
he had been overcome and discomforted on every side, and beheld the heaps of
dead soldiers on every side, he marched through the midst of their murdered
carcasses. Such was the natural fury of barbarous Kings, ignorant and enemies
of good letters^ whence ensued Anger. But I will bring thee forth Alexander out
of Aristotle's school, who in midst of his festiuals, and with his own hands
murdered his own friend Clitus, who had bin brought up with him, because he
could not flatter, and from a Macedonian and free man would not become a
servile Persian. He likewise exposed Lysimachus (who was as familiar with him
as the other) to the fury of a Lion. But did this Lysimachus (who had so
happy fortune to escape the teeth of a Lion) for this cause become more mild,
when he obtained a kingdom? no. For he cut of the nose and ears of
Telesphorus the Rhodian, who was his dear friend and afterward (as if he had
been some strange beast) kept him closed in a cage, wherein he fed him, being
unable to observe any thing of a man in him, by reason of the deformity of his
face, of hunger and filth, and his ordure, wherein this poor Creature lay
buried; having his knees and hands hardened, because the cage was over low for
him; and would not suffer him to stand, upright. Besides by reason of often
rubbing himself his sides were all flead so that he seemed lothsom and
dread^ull to all those that beheld him, and being made a Monster by this
punishment, he lost also all compassion. Yet when he was most unlike unto a
man, who suffered these things, yet was he more unlike, who did the same.

CHAP. XVIII.
I Could have wished that this cruel passion had remained amongst the
Barbarians, Other examples taken out of the Roman histories.
and had not taken possession of the hearts of us that are Romans, with other
vices drawn from ^orraine Countries, and with the fury of diverse new
punishments, and means of revenge. Marcus Marius, in whose honor the people
had raised Statues in every street, to whom with franckinsence and wine the
Romans sacrificed as to a god. By Lucius Sylla^s command had his leg broken,
his eyes pulled out, and his hands cut off; and as if he had killed him so often
as he wounded him, by little and little, he peece-meale drew every part of him
in peec^^. Who executed this commandment? Who could it be but Cataline? Who at
this time exercised his hands in all heinous stratagems. He cut this poor
body in pieces before the Tomb of Quintus Catulus, troubling with extreme
insolence, the reverend Ashes of the mildest man of his time, on which Marius a
man culpable in many kinds (yet agreeable to the people and not without
cause, although it may be that it was more then reason) shed his blood drop by
drop. Worthy was Marius to endure those things; Sylla to command it, and
Cataline to execute it. But unworthy was the commonweal to receive into her
body at once, the swords both of her enemies and Citizens. Why seek I out so
farre-^et examples? Not long since Caius Caesar caused Sextus Papinius, whose
father had been a Consul, and Bollenius Bassus who had been Thresurer, and
the son of his procurer, and other Senators and Roman Knights, to be whipped
and tormented in one day, not because they had offended, but for his mind
sake. Again, so impatient was he to differ his content, which his immeasurable
cruelty incited him to take without delay, that walking in an Allie of his
mothers garden, which seperateth the porch from the river bank, he beheaded
some, with diverse Ladies and Senators by torch-light; what is that which
provoked him? what danger either public or private threatened him to execute
those persons by night? Was it so great a matter to stay till day light? But he
would not have his Pantofles on, when he caused Romans and Senators to be
murdered.

CHAP. XIX.
Here continues he the monsterous description of Caligula^^ cruelties.
HOw proud his cruelty was, it shall be material to examine: although some
may esteem that we wander from the purpose, and contain not our selves in
the right path, but this shall be a prancke of worth enraged above ordinary.
He had caused Senators to be whipped: yea, so great was his insolence that it
might be said, that it was an ordinary matter. He had subjected them to those
torments and so cruel; that might be possibly invented, as to train them and
brake them by ropes, to torment them by pressing, by rack, by fire, and by his
furious countenance. And in this place, some may answer and say, what a
trifling matter is this, if three Senators were like base slaves whipped and
burned, by such a man who daily meditated on the death of the whole Senate, who
wished that the Roman people had but one head; to the end that there so many
offenses committed in so many places and times, might be punished in one
struck, and at one time? What has been less heard of then night punishment?
Whereas thefts are wont to be hidden by night: and punishments, the more
public they be, the more profit they for other men's example and amendment. In
this place some will answer me; That which thou so much admirest at, is this
beasts daily exercise. He lives for this, he watches for this, he studieth
for this; Truly there shall no other man be found that had government, ou^r
these whom ^e commanded to be punished, that stopped their mouths with a
sponge, for fear least they should have liberty to speak. What every dying
man had not this benefit to bemoan^ himself? But he was afraid, least some
extreme pain should make any man utter his mind boldly; and he feared
likewise le^t ^^ should hear^ those things which he would not. He knew also
that there were many other infinite things, which no man durst object against
him, except it were such a one that was ready to suffer death. When as spunges
were not in readiness, he caused the wretches garments to be cut in pieces,
and to be thrust into their mouthes^ what cruelty is this? Let it be lawful
for a man to draw his la^t breath; give place to the Soul that she may freely
depart; Let her be suffered to have passage by some other way, then by the
wound which the body has received.

CHAP. XX.
IT were too long a matter to add unto these, The cause why he made mention of
Caligula^s cruel^ies.
how many of their fathers whom he had put to death, were murdered the sam^
night by the hands of Centurions, by the command of this pitiful Prince, who
thought good by these means, to deliver the fathers from bewailing their
childrens deaths? For my intention is not to discover Caius cruelty, but the
misery of Anger, which not only executes her fury against one man or other,
but also spoyleth whole Cities and Nations, and beats rivers also which are
free from all sense of pain. As Cambyses King of Persia, Cambyses br^tish rage.
who cut off the noses of all the people in Syria, by means whereof the place
was afterward called Rhinocolura. Think thou that he spared them, because
he cut not off their heads? He took delight in a new kind of punishment. Such
like should the AEthiopians have suffered, who by reason of their long life,
are called Macrobij. For against these, because they entertained not willingly
the subjection that was offered them, but gave free answers to those
Ambassadors that were sent unto them which Kings call contumelious. Cambyses
was mad at them, and without provision of prouant and victuals, without
discovery of the Country, by unhaunted and sandy ways, heled all his
troops that were ^it for the war, which after the first days march wanted
victuals, neither did the barraine and unmanured Country, vntracted by any
foot, minister them any thing. First satisfied they their hunger with the
tender leaves and tops of trees, then by leather molified by ^ire, and
whatsoever necessity had made meat. But when as amidst the sands both roots
and herbs failed them, and the desert was found void of all living creatures,
they killed every tenth man, and thereby had sustenance more dreadful then
famine; yet notwithstanding, all this Anger carried the King on headlong. Having
lost one part of his Army, and eaten another, until such time as he feared
least amongst others that were called, the lot should fall on himself, then at
length sounded he a retreat. In the mean space, the best foul was kept for
his use, and the instruments of his banquets were carried upon Cammels, whilst
his Soldiers cast lots which of them should die miserable, and which of them
should live worse.

CHAP. XXI.
THis man was angry with a Nation unknown unto him, and innocent of
themselves, yet such as had he prospered should have tasted of his fury. But
Cyrus was angry with a River: For marching on diligently to the war, the
greatest moment whereof consists in taking oportunities and intending to
surprise Babylon, he attempted to pass over the huge River of Gynde, which
was scarcely passable in the height of Summer, and when the water is at the
lowest. There one of those white horses which were wont to draw his Kingly
Chariot, was carried away violently by the stream, whereat the King was
mightily moved; and swore that he would bring that River which had carried
away his Princely baggage to that pass that even very women should be able
to get oner it without wetting their shoes. Which said, he employed all his
forces herein, and continued so long that having dug nine score channels to
turn the River, he afterward reduced it into three hundredth and sixty arms
or brooks, so that that great channel became dry, the waters being dreined by
so many other ways. Thus spent ^e the time which is an irreuocable loss in
a^faires of consequence, thus abated he his Soldiers courage, who were broken
by unprofitable labors, and had lost their occasion and preparation for the
assault, whilst he having proclaimed war against his enemies, grew at ods with
a River.

He returns to Caligula by his example to make Anger odious, and to inkindle
others t^ mercy, he shows the mide behavior of Antigenus.
CHAP. XXII.
THis fury (for what else can thou name it?) seized the Romans likewise. For
Caius Caesar overthrew a fair house of pleasure which was builded for pleasure
near to Ponzol, because sometimes his mother had been kept prisoner in it,
and made the fortu^e thereof notable hereby. For when it stood: the passengers
that ^a^led by, enquired what it was, and now they dema^nd why it is ruined.
And as well ought thou to think on these examples, to the end to avoid
them, as on those on the contrary part which thou art to follow, which are
both moderate and gentle; who neither wanted cause to be angry, nor power to
revenge themselves. For what was more easy and facile for Antigonus? then to
command two of his Soldiers to be put to death, who lea^ing upon the Royal
tent, did that which men do most dangerously and willingly that think evil
of their Prince. Antigonus heard all that they speak, because betwixt them
that talked, and him that heard there was but a Tapestrie, which he softly
pulled aside, and said Get somewhat farther of for feare^ least the King hear
you. The same Prince upon a certain night, when he had heard certain of his
Soldiers detesting and cursing him diverse ways, who had led them into that
journie and durtie march, came unto them that were most displeased, and whereas
they knew not by whom they were helped, he satisfied them, and said: Now curse
ANTIGONVS by whose fault you were drawn into these miseries, but wish him
well, notwithstanding who brough^ you out of this bog. The same as patiently
endured the reproaches of his enemies, as of his Citizens. When as therefore the
Graecians were besieged in a small Castle, and contemning the enemy by reason
of the place jested upon Antigonus deformity, and sometimes derided his low
stature, otherwhiles his hooked nose. I am glad said he, and, conceive some
good hope if I have SILENVS in my Camp. This was Bacchus companion and the
eldest amongst the Satires.
After he had overcome these brabl^rs by famine, he used the captives in such
sort, that he placed those that were fit for war amongst his own companies
and the rest he sold by the Crier, and this he said, he would not have done
unless it had been exped^ent for them to have a Governor who had so bad
tongues. His Nephew was Alexander, who darted his Iauelin against his
table-guests, who of these two friends which he had, as I told you a little
before, made the one a pray to a Lion, the other to himself. But of both these,
he that was delivered to the Lion lived.

CHAP. XXIII.
He had not this vice either from his grandfather or his father: The second
example of great mildness and mercy.
for if there were any other virtue in Philip it was this, that he was patient
in all reproaches, which is a mighty instrument for the safety of a Kingdom.
Demochares, who for the liberty and petulancy of his tongue was called
Parrhesiastes, came unto him amongst other Athenian Ambassadors, and having
courteously given audience to their Embassage, Philip said, Tell me if I may
do any thing that shall be grateful to the Athenians. DEMOCHARES undertook
the answer, and said, G^e and hang thy self. They that stood about him were
displeased at so unhuman an answer, whom Philip commanded to be silent,
willing them to dismiss that Thersites safe and sound. But you (says he) the
rest of the Ambassadors, tell the Athenians that they are more proud that
speak thus, then they that hear them spoken without revenge. AUGUSTUS CAESAR
spoke, and did many things that were worthy memory, whereby it appears that
he was Master of his own Anger. Timogines the writer of Histories had spoken
somewhat against himself, somewhat against his whole family; neither lost he
that which he had spoken, for an audacious kind of jesting is the soonest
entertained and divulged by every man. Caesar oft-times gave him warning
hereof, and wished him to use his tongue more moderately, and seeing that he
perseuered, he forbad him his house. After that Timagines lived till he was
very old, in Asinius Pollio's house, beloved of the whole City,
notwithstanding Caesar's repulse, every man's doors was open to him. Afterward
he recited and burned those Histories which he had written, and cast those
books into the fire which contained the acts of Augustus Caesar: and thus
waged he war with Caesar. No man for all this refused his friendship, no man
fled from him, as though he were blasted: there was always that gave him
entertainment in the height of his disgraces. All these, as I said, Caesar
endured patiently, neither was he moved therewith, notwithstanding that
Timagines had violated both his praises and actions. He never was displeased
with him that entertained his enemy, this only said he to POLLIO, Thou
nourishest a beast; and when he addressed himself to give him an answer, the
Emperor prevented him, and said, He is at thy command POLLIO, much good do it
thee with him. And when as Pollio said, If thou command me CAESAR, I will
presently forbid him my house. What said he, think thou? I will do this,
who have reconciled both of you and made you friends? For Pollio in times past
had been angry with Timagines; neither had he any other cause of dislike
toward him, but because Caesar had entertained him.

CHAP. XXIIII.
What profit a man should take of the precedent examples, and what
considerations besides the we ought to annex, the better to refrain Anger
LEt every man therefore say unto himself as often as he is provoked, Am I more
powerful then Philip? yet he patiently suffered disgraces without revenging
them. Can I do more in my private house then Diuus Caesar through the whole
world? yet was he content to lock up his gates against him that had slandered
him. Or why should I for a bold and jesting answer, a proud look, or the
grumbling and untowardness of my slave, expiate his fault with whips and
fetters? Who am I that no man dare offend mine ears? Many have pardoned their
enemies, shall not I pardon such as are sluggish, negligent, and branglers? Let
age excuse a child, her sex a woman, liberty a stranger, familiarity a
domestic. He offended me but even now. Let us bethink our selves how often he
has contented us; But oft-times has he offended otherwise? Let us endure that
which we have suffered long. He was my friend: he did that which he pretended
not. Is he an enemy? He did that which he ought to do. Shall we endure a
wiseman? let us pardon a fool. Whatsoever befalls us, let us say unto our
selves, that the wisest commit many errors, and that no man is so circumspect
whom Anger does not sometimes take tardie: none so mature and stayed, either in
his words or actions, whose gravity may by fortune be drawn into some
inconsiderate action: no man so fearful to offend, that whilst he flies from
offenses, falls not into them.

CHAP. XXV.
A continuation of the profits we gather by the precedent consideration.
EVen as a poor man takes comfort in his misery, when he sees other great
men's fortune stagger, and with a more temperate mind has bewailed his sons
death in a corner of his chamber, who sees the woeful funerals of the heir of
a Kingdom solemnized and borne forth; so with a more peaceable and contented
mind shall he endure to be harmed and contemned by another man, whosoever
bethinketh himself that there is no Potentate so great, who is not, or may not
be attempted with injury. And if the most wisest do offend, let us thin^e
with our selves that there is no fault which is not excusable. Let us consider
how oftentimes our young years have been scarce diligent in performing
duties, immoderate in speech, scarce temperate in wine: if he be angry, let us
give him tim^ wherein he may consider what he has done, and he himself will
reprove himself; in conclusion, he will punish himself, yet for all this
must not we be angry. This is undoubtedly true, that he has exempted himself
from common men, and raised himself to a higher degree, that despises such as
provoke him. For it is the property of true magnitude, not to feel that he is
strooken. So has a furious beast, stalking a long with a settled pace looked
back on those Dogs that barked at him. So do the enraged billows of the Sea
insult in vain against an immovable rock. He that is not angry has never
been shaken by injury, he that is angry is moved: but he whom for the
present I have mounted above all incommoditie, with a certain embrace
entertaineth the chiefest good, being equal not only to himself, but also to
fortune. Whatsoever thou do, thou art not great enough to obscure the
brightness that enlightneth me. Reason to whom I have assigned the conduct of
my life, defends the same. The Anger will hurt me more then the offense; and
why? Because there is a certain measure in the offense, but I know not how
far mine Anger will transport me.

CHAP. XXVI.
But, A pertinent answer to those that allege that they can endure n^thing,
for by this means they deprive themselves of that excellent happiness which
courtesy produces.
say thou, I can endure nothing, it is a grievous matter to me to sustain
an injury. Thou lie: for who cannot endure injury that can suffer Anger?
Furthermore, thou pretendest to charge thy self with injury and Anger both at
once. Why suffer thou the cries of a sick man, the strange speeches of a
lunatic, and the strokes of thy little children? Forsooth because they seem
to be ignorant of what they do. What skilleth it by what error any man
becomes imprudent, since imprudence is an equal excuse for all those that
are attainted therewith? What then, say thou, shall he remain unpunished?
Think that thou would, yet it shall not be so: for the greatest
chastisement that a man may receive who has outraged another, is, to have done
the outrage, and there is no man that is so rudely punished, as he that is
subject to the whip of his own repentance. Moreover, it behooves us to regard
and consider the condition of humane affairs, to the end we may be upright
Judges of all accidents. But he is unjust who vpbraideth a private man with
that imperfection which is common to all. If a man be black amongst the
Moors, or has a red head, and curled after the manner of the Almaines; this
is no dishonor to him, but becomes him well. That which is common to a whole
nation, defameth not a particular: but those things that I have set down
before, depend but on the custom of one country, which is but a little corner
of the earth. Consider therefore whether it be not an easier matter to excuse
it, which is the practice of the whole world. We are all of us inconsiderate
and improuident, all of us uncertain, irresolute, and ambitious. But why hide
I a public ulcer under milder words? We are all of us noughts. Whatsoever
therefore is reprehended in another, that shall every man find within his own
bosom. Why obseruest thou his bleakenesse of color, his leanenesse of body?
It is a common plague. Let us therefore be more temperate one toward another,
we live evil men amongst evil men: there is one thing only that can make us
quiet; a mutual facility in conversation. This man has now injured me, but
as yet I have not harmed him; yet now perhaps have thou hurt some body, or at
leastwise thou will hurt.

CHAP. XXVII.
EStimate not this hour or this day, How much the consideration of our
weakness heartneth against Anger, which is the ninth means to refrain it.
look into the whole habit of thy mind, if as yet thou have done no evil,
yet can thou do it. How far better is it that an injury should be salued
then revenged? Revenge consumes much time, exposes her self to many injuries
whilst she is stung with one. We are all of us more long time angry then we
are hurt; how far better is it to take another course, and not in this sort
to sort vices together? Should a man be thought well in his wits if he should
kick at a Moyle with his heels that had strooken him, or tear a Dog with
his teeth that had bitten him? These, say thou, know not that they offend.
First of all, how unjust is he who is displeased when men come unto him to
reconcile themselves? Again, if it restrain thee from being angry with
beasts, because they are destitute of reason; in the same rank number him that
does something without judgment: for what skilleth it if he resemble not
beasts in any other thing, in the fault which excuses beasts, he shows
himself as brutish as they be? He has offended; for this is the first and
this is the last. Thou have no cause to believe him, although he says, I will
not do it again. Thou shall see that he will once more offend thee, and
another him, and the whole course of life shall be travailed with errors: we
must handle savage things courteously. That which is wont to be said in sorrow,
may effectually be spoken likewise in Anger. Whether will thou give over once
or never? If once, it is better to leave off Anger, then to be left by Anger:
but if this fault shall always continue, thou see how unquiet a life thou
denouncest to thy self, as it befalls him who is always swollen up, and
incensed by wrath.

CHAP. XXVIII.
The tenth means, not to seek any occasi^^ of displeasure.
FVrthermore, if thou thy self seek not the occasions and means to provoke
thine Anger, and if thou enkindlest not thy displeasure, thou shall see it
depart from thee of her own motion, and time will weaken it daily. How far
better is it for thee that thou should surmount her, then that she should be
Mistress of thee? Thou art angry now with this man, now with that man, now
with thy slaves, anon after with thy francklins, now with thy father or mother,
now with thy children, with those of thine acquaintance, then with such as thou
have but newly met withal: for the occasions present themselves in every
place, except a peaceable mind contain and govern us. Fury will drive thee
hither and thither, and as new prouocations shall arise, thy rage shall be
continued. Go to unhappy man and when is it that thou will love? O how good
time loosest thou in so bad a thing? How far better were it now to get thee
friends, and to mittigate thine enemies, to govern the Common weal, to
transfer thy endeavors to the government of thy family, then to look about
thee what injury thou may do another man. What wound thou may inflict
either on his dignity, or his patrimony, or his body? When as this cannot
befall thee without contention and danger, although thou encounter with thine
inferior. Although thou see him tied hand and foot, and that he be in thy
power to do with him whatsoever thou please, oftentimes it has been seen
that a man in striking another with all his force, has put his shoulder out of
joint, or his arm, or hand, or else in biting has broken his teeth, and
spoiled his gummes. Anger has made many men lame, and has weakened many; yea,
even then when she has gotten matter of patience. Add hereunto, that there is
not any thing so feeble in this world, The eleventh consideration, is, that we
hurt our ^^^ues more th^n ^^ do our enemies.
that perishes without putting him in danger that would crush or break it.
Sometimes grief, and sometimes casualty has matched the strongest with the
weakest. And which is more, the most part of those things which move us, do
harm us more then we hurt other men. But there is a great difference whether a
man oppose himself against my pleasure, or whether he hinder it not, whether
he take it from me, or give it me not. But we account it all one whether a man
take from us any thing or deny us; whether he cut of our hopes, or differ
them: whether he be against us, or for him self; whether for the love of
another man, or the hatred he bears us: But some have not only just, but also
honest causes to stand against us. The one defends his ^ather, the other his
brother, another his uncle, the third his friend. Yet pardon we not those that
do these things, which should they not do; we would condemn them: nay more
which is incredible, oftimes we allow of the deed, but condemn the doer.

CHAP. XXIX

assistance.
that most valiantly and aduenturously behaueth himself, for the liberty and
conservation of his Country, and wishes himself such a Citizen and such a
Camerado as that is in his dangers. It is a shameful thing to hate him whom
thou praysest^ but how far more shameful to hate any man, for that for which
he is worthy of mercy: if any one being taken prisosoner, retains as yet
some remanders of his liberty, and shows not himself so ready in base and
troublesome businesses, if having through idleness gathered so much fat, that
he cannot come so swiftly as his Masters horse or coach: if wearied with all
days travail he sleep; if he refuses to labor in the fields or does not
bestow himself so, as a stout pesant should do; by reason he had lived in a
City, where he had much ease, and that now he is tied to a business that is
tedious and continual, let us consider whether he cannot do that which we
would require at his hands, or if he will not do it: we shall bear with
diverse men; if we endeavor our selves to judge before we be displeased. But
now we believe that which the first assault of our passion buzzeth in our
^ares; afterward although we b^e moved upon no ground: yet pers^uer we
least we should seem to have begun without any cause, and that which is
most damnable, the iniquity of wrath makes us more obstinate. For we nourish
and increase the same as if it were an argument of just Anger, to be
grievously angry. How far better is it to examine the beginnings, and to
consider how harmless? That which thou see fall out in bruit beasts, the
same shall thou discover in man, we are troubled with frivolous and vain
things.

the Aspe is inkindled in the shadow, a white Cloth provoke Bears and
Lions. All things that nature has made fierce and dreadful are astonished at
a little matter. The same befalls disquiet and foolish minds. They are
strooken with suspicion of things, and in such sort as some times they call
moderate benefits injuries, in which the most frequent, but the most, yet truly
the most urgent causes of choler consist. For we are angry with our dearest
friends, because they have done us less courtesy then we expected, then other
men have done us; when as there is a present and ready remedy for them both.
Has he favored another man more? let us delight our selves with ours without
comparison: he shall never be happy, that tormenteth himself at an other man's
felicity. I have less then I hoped for? But happily I have hoped more then I
ought. This part is most of all to be feared. Hence arise most dangerous
displeasures, and such as invade the most holiest and blessedest things of the
World. Julius Caesar was killed by a greater number of his friends, then of his
enemies: whose immeasurable hopes he had not satisfied. Such was his intention,
neither ever was there any man that carried himself more better, or more
liberally, when he became Master of his enemies, for he challenged nothing to
himself, but the power to distribute; but here could he satisfy so many
importunate desires, when as all men desired so much as one man could? He saw
therefore with naked daggers, those followers of his about his throne; and
amongst the rest Tullius Cimber, who before time had been an affectionate
partaker of his, and those other, who after the death of Pompey were become
Pompeians.

CHAP. XXXI.
The fourtenth Have m^re respect to another m^ns good then to th^ne own and
never think that tho^ have obtained to little.
THis very passion has raised the subjects against their Prince, and urged the
most faithful to conspire the death of those, for whom and in whose presence,
they had desired in times past to loose their lives. He that has respect to
another man's good, neglects his own. And thereupon we are angry with the
gods likewise, because some one man out-strippeth us, forgetting our selves how
much and how important envy follows them at their backs, yet so great is
the importunity of men, that although they have received much, yet suppose
themselves to be indignified, because in their iudgement^^ they are capable of
more. Gave he me a Praetor-ship? but I looked for a Consul-ship. Gau^ they me
twelve Maces? yet they made me not an ordinary Consul. Would he have me to
undertake the charge of numbering the year? but he failed me in the election,
when I sought for the Pontificiall dignity. Have I been brought into the
College of Bishops and Augures? but why in company? Has he consumated my
dignity? but he has allowed nothing toward my charge and patrimony: He
gave me that which he ought to have given to an other, he added nothing of his
own. Rather give thanks for those things which thou have received, exspect
the rest, and rejoice, because that as yet thou art not full. Amongst all other
pleasures, it is no small one, to see that there is somewhat remaining, for
which thou may hope. Have thou sped better then any other? rejoice, because
thou art the first amongst others that has thy friends heart. Do many
exceed thee? consider that the number of those that march after thee,
surpasses those whom thou followest.

CHAP. XXXII.
Ask thou me what is the greatest vice in thee? The fi^thteenth, to disg^st
t^y wra^h a li^^le and take leas^ue to consider what command^ment the passion
has over ^h^e, and whereupon it is founded.
thou forgest false considerations, thou highly prizest thine own gi^tes, and
neglectest others. Let one thing deter us in an other. Let us be afraid to be
angry with some for reverence sake, let us forbear other, and for pity sake
endure other some. Undoubtedly we shall perform a goodly piece of work, if we
shut our unhappy slave in prison. Why are we so ha^tie to beat him: and so
sudden to break his legs? this power will not be lost, if it be deferred.
Let that time come wherein we may be Masters of our selves. Now speak we out
of passion: when she is quailed, then shall we see how weighty this debate
is. For in this especially are we deceived. We come to knifes, to capital
punishments: and by bonds, imprisonment, and famine, we revenge the crime which
should be chastised by whipping and slighter punishments. How (say thou)
command thou us to consider, how all those things, whereby we seem to be
harmed, are trifling, miserable, and childish? But I for mine own part would
persuade nothing more then to take upon us a great mind, and to examie and see
how these things for which we quarrel run and sweat, after how humble and
abject they be, and such as are not to be respected and thought upon by any
man, that thinks on any high or magnificent matter. There is much brabling
about money, she wearieth the Courts of Pleas, she sets the fathers and
children together by the ears, she mixeth venomes, she delivers swords as
well into the hands of the executioner, as of the soldier, she it is that is
embrewed with our blood. For her are the marriage beds of man and wife filled
with brawles, for her the Tribunals of Majestrates are ouer-pressed with
throng^ Kings are enraged and ransack countries, and overthrow Cities, which
were builded by the labor of ma^y ^ges, to the end that Gold and Silver might
be sought out in the ashes of the City.

CHAP. XXXIII.
IT pleases me to behold those caskets of money that lie heaped in a corner.
The sixteenth, That all our goods are not worth half the labor we employ upon
them and the busy care to enjoy them is a wretchles misery.
These are they for which men weep out their eyes, for which the iudgement^
Hals are confused with muttering, for which Judges being nominated out of
remote Countries sit in judgment to sentence whether of both parties a^arice is
most just. What if it be not for a bag or casket of moni^, but for a handful
of silver, or for a penny borrowed or lent to a man's slave, an old man without
hei^es and ready to die, is ready to burst with Anger^ what if for less then
the thousand part of a man's interest, a sickly Usurer with crooked limbs and
lame hands only left him to number his money, cries out and in the very
violence of his accessions, cries out for money to his suerties^ If thou bring
me forth whatsoever money that is curran^ and usual in all kind of metals, if
thou cast before me whatsoever treasure, which avarice would bury againe^
after she had dug it up, I think that all this heap is not worthy to
furrow up the brow of a good man. How much are they to be laughed at, for which
we spend so many tears?

CHAP. XXXIIII.
PRosecute the rest somewhat further I pray thee, and consider the eating and
drinking, and all that proud equipage that depends there upon, so many
labors to keep the house clean, so many strokes given, so many outrageous
speeches, and so many unseemly countenances, suspicions restie Iades, Idle
slaves, wicked reporters of other men's words: for from all these it comes
that in the end some think that nature has done men wrong, in giving them the
faculty of speaking. Believe me we are bitterly angry for such slight
things, and for which children are wont to be froward, and to scrath one
another. There is nothing serious or great in all that which we do with so
much care and thought. Thence grows your Choler and Fury because you esteem
these things great which are nothing. Such a one would have taken away my
goods, that man having long time had a good opinion of me, has finally
defamed me, this man would have corupted my minion. That which should be the
link of lou^ which is to will one thing, is the cause of hatred and sedition.

CHAP. XXXV.
A more exact description of this n^ti^ of w^ath which is tormented at trifles
and things of no moment.
THE way that is straight moves quarrel amongst those that pass through it.
That which is open and large is over narrow for Armies that encounter together.
These things which you desire because they are small, neither can be
transferred to one except they be taken from an other do incite quarrels and
troubles amongst those that affect the same things. Thou art angry if thy
frackling or thy wife or thy retainer answer thee, and afterward thou
co^plainest that the commonwealth has lost all liberty, which thou thy self
have exterminated out of thine own house. Again if thou speak unto thy servant,
and he answer thee not thou termest it disdain and rebell^on. Thou will have
him speak, thou will have him hold his peace, thou will have him laugh, what
before his Master say thou I before the Father of the family. Why criest
thou? why chidest thou? what moves thee in the midst of thy supper to call for
scourges; because thy servants talk or because thy attendants are not
seruiceble, or because no man answers thee? Have thou no ears but to hear
Music, and pleasing songs and words well fitted and pleasing? yet must thou
hear men laugh, cry, flatter, pl^^d, tell joyful and tragical news, and
men's tongues and the cries of diverse Cre^tures. Poor man why art thou
affrighted at thy seruant^ cry, at the ^inging of a Basin, at the noice of a
door that is opened and locked? although thou be so delicate, yet must thou
hear the crack of thunder. That which is spoken of the ^ares, may be
transferred to the eyes, which are no le^^e troubled with objects when they are
badly addressed: for they are offended at a ^pot, or soil, or silver plate
badly cleansed and their tin platters; if they shine not at the sun. For
these eyes that are delighted with nothing but Marble and Jasper finely
polished, that like no table except it be of costly wood, and well carved,
which will not fix themselves in the house, except on these things that are
g^ilded and embossed; without doors with content enough, behold the rugged and
durtie ways and the most part of those that meet with them badly clothed, and
the walls of Cities half ^aten away, ruined and unequal.

CHAP. XXXVI.
WHat is the cause then why that which offends them not abroad, The
eighteenth, Give over to corrupt thy senc^s and call thy mind every day to a

chafeth and troubles them thus in their houses, but an equitable and patient
opinion in public, but a crabbish and quarrelsome disposition at home? All
our senses are to be brought to a conformity. By nature we are patient, if
our mind cease to corrupt them, which is daily to be drawn unto an account.
This did Sextius, that when the day was spent and he retired himself to rest,
was wont to examine his mind after this manner. What in^irmitie in thee have
thou healed this day. What vice have thou resisted? In what part art thou
bettered? Anger will cease and become more moderate, if she knows that every
day she must appear before a Judge. What therefore is more laudable then this
custom, to examine our daily actions? What sleep follows after this
scrutenie? how quiet, pleasing, and free is it, when either the mind is
praised or admonished, and being a watchman and secret censor of himself,
examineth his defects? I use this power, and daily plead before my self, when
the candle is taken from me, and my wife holds her tongue, being privy to my
custom. I examine the whole day that is past, and ruminate upon actions and
words. I hide nothing from my self, I let slip nothing: For why should I
^eare any of mine errors, when as I may say: See thou do this no more: for
this time, I pardon thee. In that dispute, thou speak more rashly, see that
hereafter thou contend not with such as are ignorant, they will never learn,
that never learned. Thou have more freely admonished such a one then thou
ought, and therefore thou have not amended him but offended him. In regard
of the rest, see not only whether it were true which thou spakest, or whether
he to whom it was spoken can endure to hear truth.

CHAP. XXXVII.
A Good man rejoices when he is admonished, The nineteenth, That it is
vnposble to continue in life except thou re^raine ^holer.
a wicked man cannot brook a reproouer. At a banquet some men's bitter jests
and intemperate words have touched thee to the quick? Remember to avoid the
vulgar company: after Wine men's words are too lavish, and they that are most
sober in their discourses are scarce modest. Thou saw thy friends displeased
with the Porter of a Counsailers chamber, or some rich man because he would
not suffer him to enter, and thou thy self being angry for this cause growest
in Choler with the cullion. Will thou therefore be angry with a chained dog,
who when he has barked much will be pacified with a piece of bread? get
farther off him^ and laugh. He that keeps his Masters door, and sees the
threshold besieged by a troop of soliciters, thinks himself no small bug,
and he that is the Client thinks himself happy in his own opinion, and
believes that so hard an access into the chamber is an evident testimonie^
that the Master of the same is a man of great quality and a favorite of
Fortune. But he remembers not himself that the entry of a Prison is as
difficult likewise. Presume with thy self, that thou art to endure much. If a
man be cold in Winter; if he vomit at Sea, if he be shaken in a Coach,
shall he marvel hereat? The mind^ is strong and may endure all that whereunto
he is repared. If thou have been seated in a place scarce answerable to thine
honor, thou have been angry with him that stood next thee, or with him that
invited thee, or with him that was preferred before thee, Fool as thou art,
what matter is it, in what place thou art set at the table, a cushion cannot
make thee more or less honest. Thou were displeased to see such a one, because
he spoke evil of thy behavior. Art thou at that point? by this reckoning
then En^ius in whose poetry thou art no ways delighted, should hate thee, and
Hortensius should denounce war against thee, and Cicero if thou should
mock his verses, should be at ods with thee.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
The twentieth and last to take profit by the examples of patience and
m^^knesse.
WHen thou suest for an office do thou not peaceably entertain those that
give their voices to the election, although they nominate not thy self? Some
man has disgraced thee? what more then Diogenes the Stoicke was, who
discoursing one day very effectually upon the subject of Anger, was scornfully
spit upon by a froward yongman; this injury entertained he both mildly and
wisely. Truly (says he) I am not Angry, yet doubt I whether, I ought to be
angry. But our friend Cato demeaned himself better, whom as he pleaded a
cause; Lentulus that factious and seditious fellow in the time of our
forefathers, hawking up from the depth of his stomach a thick and filthy
spittle, blew it right into the midst of his for-head. For in wiping his face
he said no other thing but this. Truly LENTVLVS I will now maintain it
against all men that, they are deceived, who say thou have no mouth.

CHAP. XXXIX.
NOW my Nouatus we are already instructed how to govern our minds, if either
they feel not wrath, or be superiors over it. Let us now see how we may
temper other men's Ire, for not only desire we to be healthful our selves, but
to heal others. We dare not attempt to moderate and pacify the first anger by
persuasion: ^or ^he is deaf and mad: We will give her some time; remedies are
best in the declination of favors, neither will we attempt her when she is
inflamed, and in fury, for fear least in striving to quench, we inkindle the
same; the like will we do in respect of other passions. Repose heals the
beginning of sicknesses. How much (say thou) does thy remedy profit, if it
pacify, Anger when of her self, she begins to be pleased? First it is the
cause that it cease the sooner, then will it keep her least she fall again,
and shall receive the passion it self which he dare not pacify it. It shall
remove all instruments of revenge, it shall feign displeasure, to the end that
as a helper and companion in her sorrow, it may have more authority to
counsel her, it shall coin delays, and whilst she seeks greater
punishments, defer the present. It shall by all means give rest and remission
to fury, if she be more vehement it shall either induce shame or fear in her,
against which she shall not be able to resist; if she be weak it shall invent
discourses, either grateful or new, and wind her away with a desire of
knowledge. It is reported that a Physician when he had a Kings daughter in
cure, and could not perform the same without the means of a launcet, that
whilst he gently handled her Pap that was greatly swollen, he conuayed his
launcet into a sponge, and so opened it. The maiden had repined should he have
ministered the remedy openly, and she because she suspected it not, suffered
the pain.

CHAP. XL.
SOme things are not healed except they be deceived. To one of these thou shall
say, How by words well applied, or by authority we may have over men, wrath may
be pacified.
Beware lest thy wrath be pleasing to thine enemy. To another, Take heed lest
the greatness of thy mind, and thy reputed courage in all men's judgment he
brought in question. Truly I am displeased with him, and that beyond measure,
yet must we stay our time, and we will be revenged. Conceal thy displeasure a
while whilst thon may, and we will pay him home double. But to check him
that is angry, and to oppose thy self against him, is to cast oil on the
fire. Thou shall attempt him diverse ways, and after a friendly manner, except
happily it be so great a person, that thou may diminish his wrath, as
Augustus Caesar did when he supped with Vedius Pollio; one of the servants had
broken a crystal glass, whom Vedius commanded to be carried away, and to be
p^nished by no ordinary death: for he commanded him to be thrown amongst his
Lampries, which were in kept a great Fish Pond. Who could otherwise think but
that he did it to entertain his excessive pleasures? The boy escaped out of
their hands, and fled to Caesar's feet, desiring nothing else but that he might
die otherwise, and not be made meat for Fishes. Caesar was moved with the
novelty of the cruelty, and commanded him to be carried away, yet willed that
all the crystal vessels should be broken in his presence, and that the
Fish Pond should be filled up. So thought Caesar good to chastise his friend,
and well did he use his power. Command thou me to be dragged from the
banquet, and to be tortured by new kinds of pnnishment? If thy cup be broken
shall men's bowels be rent in pieces? Will thou please thy self so much as to
command any man to death where Caesar is present?

CHAP. XLI.
THus ought we to oppose our selves against a powerful person, to the end that
from a more eminent place a man may assail a wrath that is intractable, Now
addresseth he himself to exhortation, persuading us ^o avoid ^urie.
and such a one as this whereof I lately told you, fierce, cruel, bloody,
which could not now receive any cure, but by the fear of a thing more greater
then it self. Let us give repose unto our minds, which we shall do if we
dilate continually upon the precepts of wisdom, and the acts of virtue, and
likewise whilst our thoughts desire nothing but that which is honest. Let us
satisfy our conscience, let us do nothing for vain glory sake, let thy
fortune be evil, so thine actions be good. But the world admireth those that
attempt mighty matters, and audacious men, are reputed honorable, and
peaceable are esteemed sluggards. It may be upon the first sight, but as soon
as a well-gouerned life shows that it proceeds not from the weakness, but
the moderation of the mind, the people regard and reverence them. So then this
cruel and bloody passion is not profitable in any sort; but contrariwise, all
evils, fire, and blood feed her, she treads all modesty under foot,
embrueth her hands with infinite murders; she it is that teareth children in
sunder, and scatters their limbs here and there; she has left no place
void of heinous villeynies, neither respecting glory nor fearing infamy;
incurable, when of wrath she is hardened and converted into hatred.

CHAP. XLII.
The continuatio^ of those pe^swations which are easi^ to be practiced,
especially if we consider the sh^rt^es and inc^rtainty of our lives.
LEt us abstain wholly from this vice, let us purge our mind and pull up those
passions that are rooted in it, whose hold-fast be it never so little, will
spring again wheresoever it is fastened; and let us not only moderate our
Anger, but wholly root it out, and drive it from us. For what temper is there
in an evil thing? But we may, if so be we will endeavor; neither will any
thing profit us more then the thought of mortality. Let every one say unto
himself, as if it were unto another, What helps it us, as if we were borne
to live ever, to proclaim our hatreds, and mispend so short a life? What
profits us to transfer those days which we might spend in honest pleasure,
in plotting another man's misery and torment? These things of so short
continuance would not be hazarded, neither have we any leisure to loose time.
Why rush we forward to fight? Why beget we quarrels against our selves? Why
being forgetful of our weakness, embrace we excessive ^atreds? And being
ready to break, our selves rise up to break others. It will not be long but
either a feauor, or some other infirmity of the body will prevent these
hatreds which we hatch in our implacable minds. Behold death at hand, that
will part these two mortal enemies. Why tempest we? why so seditiously trouble
we our life? Death hangs over our heads, and daily more and more lays hold
on him that is dying. That very time which thou destinatest to another man's
death, shall be the nearest to thine own.

CHAP. XLIII.
^he con^lu^ion, wherein he d^sc^uereth summarily the goods that proc^^d from a
pe^ceab^e life, and ^he c^^ls that are c^us^d by Anger.
WHy rather make thou not use of this short time of thy life, by making it
peaceable both to thy self and others? Why rather endeerest thou not thy self
in all men's love whilst thou live, to the end that when thou die thy loss
may be lamented? And why desire thou to put him lower, whose authority is
too great for thee to contend against. Why seeekest thou to crush and terrify
that base and contemptible fellow that barketh at thee, and who is so bitter
and troublesome to his superiors? Why frettest thou at thy servant? thy Lord?
thy King? Why art thou angry with thy clyent? Bear with him a little, behold
death is at hand which shall make us equals. We were wont to laugh (in
beholding the combats which are performed on the sands in the morning) to mark
the conflict of the Bull and Bear when they are tied one to another, which
after they have tired one another, the Butcher attends for them both to drive
them to the slaughterhouse. The like do we; we challenge him that is coupled
with us, we charge him on every side, mean while both the conquered and the
conqueror are nee^e unto their ruin. Rather let us finish that little
remainder of our life in quiet and peace, and let not our death be a pleasure
to any man. Oft-times they that were together by the ^ares have forsaken their
strife, because that during their debate, some one has cried fire that was
kindled in a neighbors house, and the enteruiew of a wild beast has divided
the thief and the merchant. We have no leisure to wrestle with lesser evils,
when greater fear appears. What have we to do with fighting and ambushes?
Do thou wish him with whom thou art displeased, any more then death?
Although thou say nothing to him he shall die; thou loosest thy labor, thou will do that which will be done. I will not, say thou, forthwith kill him,
but banish, disgrace, or punish him. I pardon him rather that desires his
enemy should be wounded, then scabbed; for this man is not only badly but
basely minded, whether it be that thou think of death or any one more slight
evil, there is but a very little di^ference betwixt the day of thy desire,
until the punishment which such a one shall endure, or till the time thou
shall rejoice with an evil conscience at the miseries of another man: for even
now, while we draw our breath we drive our spirit from us. Whilst we are
amongst men, let us embrace humanity, let us be dreadful or dangerous to no
man; let us contemn detriments, injuries, slanders, and garboyles, and with
great minds suffer short incommodities, whilst we look behind us, as they
say, and turn our selves, behold death does presently attend us.

The end of SENECAES three Books of Anger.
A DISCOVRSE OF CLEMENCY, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA To NERO CAESAR. The
first Book.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THese Books were written in the beginning of NEROES reign, which he himself
manifestly proves in his first Book and ninth chapter, whereas he writes that
he was entered into the nineteenth year of his age. And undoubtedly both the
words and matter are worthy of a Prince; and I would to God they would read
the same, and from thence gather the fruits of mercy and magnitude. He
begins with NEROES praise, and that deservedly; for his beginnings were
moderate. Afterward in his third Chapter he deuideth his writings into three
parts: the one of Manuduction, the other which explicateth the nature of
Clemency, which leads men thereunto and firmeth them. In the first, the first
whole Book entreats thereof, and in the forefront he sets down the
profit of Clemency, and how greatly it beseems Kings. That Clemency well
becomes them, because they are the heads of the Commonweal, and we as the
body and members. But who is he that spares not and nourishes not his body?
And that she is necessary also where there are many offenders, whom if thou
punishest always, thou make the Commonweal a solitude. By the example of
the gods, who spare us. Likewise in regard of fame, because Kings actions are
the objects of all men's eyes, and the least cruelty is too long. By their
security; for they that govern thu^; are more secure, and he annexeth some
notable actions of AUGUSTUS. Contrariwise, in tyrants who work their own
destructions by cruelty, hatreds, and perrils. But a Prince does therefore
punish seldom, mildely and temperately, with the mind, and after the example
of Parents, and that moderation is fruitfully used in Schools, Camps, amongst
beasts and servants: yea, it is used by nature, by the example of Bees, whose
King has no sting. But now a Prince when he punishes, either punishes for
his own or another man's cause: in his own cause he ought not to be rigorous,
because he lives in so high a fortune that he needs not the solace of
revenge: not in another man's cause, but according to the law, to amend them, or
make other better or more secure. And all these things the seldomnesse of
punishment will effect, they that are often, are set light by, and are
despised. In the shutting up he sets down the detestation of cruelty, and
the mischifes and overthrows that grow by her.

CHAP. I.
NERO CAESAR, I have determined to write of Clemency, How requisite it is for
the great men of this world to study how to moderate their minds, which they
may do the better if they meditate what pre-eminence they have above other m^.
to the end that in some sort I may serve thee for a mirror, and show thee to
^hy self, in such sort, as thou may receive a perfect contentment thereby^
for although the true fruit of virtuous actions be to have done them, and that
without virtues themselves there is no recompense whatsoever, that is worthy of
themselves, yet there is a certain pleasure ^o examine and visit a good
conscience every ways, and then to fix a man's eyes upon this infinite
multitude, turbulent, seditious, passionate, that bathe them selves willingly
in other men's bloods, yea, in their own, if they have broken the yoke that
restrains them, and to speak thus in himself to himself. I am he amongst
all other mortal men, who have been agreeable to the gods, and whom they have
chosen for their liefetenant upon the earth. I have the power of life and death
over all nations. It lies in my hands to dispose the estate and condition of
every man; fortune pronounces by my mouth that which she intends, that every
man shall have and possess in this life: whole Nations and Cities conceive
occasion of rejoice by my commandments. There is no Nation whatsoever that
flourishes not by my good will and favor; upon the least inkling I shall
give, so many thousands of swords, which have been sheathed by my peace, shall
be drawn again. It is in my power to ordain what Nations shall be
exterminated, which shall be transported from one country to another, which in
franchised, or made subject; what Kings shall be conquered, and whose heads
shall be adorned with the royal wreath; what Cities shall be ruinated and
what builded. Being thus possessed of so great power, neither has wrath, nor
youthly heat, neither folly or insolence of men, who have often made the most
temperate to loose their patience, neither the proud design to make show of
my power, in causing other men to fear, a glory too frequent amongst such as
are Monarchs, have never enforced me to chastise or put any man to death
wrongfully. My sword is hidden, nay more, kept in the sheath. The blood of my
meanest subjects is carefully spared by me. Although a man have many
imperfections, yet in regard he is a man, he is gracious in mine eyes: my
severity is hidden and my Clemency apparent. Such a watch have I over my
self, as if I were to yield an account to the laws (which from obscurity I
have brought to light) of all mine actions. I have pardoned one by reason of
his youth, another because he was old, that man because of his magistracy,
that other for his obscurity: and when in those that were faulty I found not
any occasion of mercy, I bare with them for the love of my self. If the
immortal gods summon me this day to yield up my reckoning, I am ready to
account for the whole world. Caesar thou may boldly speak this, that of all
those things which thou have embraced under thy protection and safeguard, tho^
have taken nothing from the Commonwealth, either by violence or cunning. Thou
have wished and purchased innocence^ which is a praise very rare, and such as
yet has not bin granted to any Prince. Thou loosest not thy pains, and this
thy singular bounty has not met with ungrateful or misconceiuing subjects.
Each one acknowledges the good thou have done them. Never was man so beloved
by another as thou art by the Roman people, whose great and continual
felicity thou art. But thou have laid a weighty burden on thy shoulders. No
man speaks more now of the former years, either of the Empire of Augustus or
Tiberius. Neither seek they any pattern besides thy self, whereby they may
govern their life. One year of thy government shows that which we hope for
in the years that follow, which would hardly be imagined, if this thy bounty
were borrowed for a time, but is natural. For no man can long time conceal
his imperfections, and the actions suddenly discover what the hidden nature is.
Those things that contain verity, and which grow from that which has some
firmitie in it increase, and from time to time wax better and better. The
Roman people were very much perplexed whilst they stood in expectation,
whereunto thy generous nature would apply it self at the first. Now are all
men's desires accomplished and assured; for it is not to be feared that thou will forget thy self suddenly. Too much felicity makes men ouer-greedie;
neither are desires at any time so tempered, that they stay themselves upon
that good which is befalne them. Every one ascends from great unto greater,
and they that have attained such things as they hoped not for, embrace strange
designs: yet all thy Citizens do now confess that they are happy, and that
nothing can be added to their felicity, except it should be perpetual. Many
things cause them to confess thus much, namely, their great and assured
repose, with all the commodities of life, which is a good which befalls a man
very hardly, and upon the end of his years. Furthermore, a justice placed
above all injury. They represent unto themselves, and see an excellent form
of public government, which contains all that which is requisite to
establish a perfect liberty, provided, that it be seconded by a continual
diligence. But principally both great and little are ravished, in considering
thine affability, so equal and answerable to all men's expectations. For as
touching thine other virtues, every one partaketh them according to the
proportion of his fortune, and expects more or less of thy larges; but all
of them in general depend upon thy Clemency: neither is there any one so
assured in his innocence, that had not rather prostrate himself before thy
Clemency, which is so ready to excuse and wink at every man's faults.

CHAP. II.
Altho^gh the m^^cie and be^ignity o^ P^inces serves for such as ^re guilty in
especial, yet both the innocent and virtuous reap a profit thereby.
But I know there are some that think that Clemency emboldneth those men that
are most wicked, because it stands in no stead, except it be after that the
fault is committed, and this virtue only cease amongst those that are
innocent. But first of all, even as the use of Physique is as honorable
amongst the sick, as it is amongst the whole; so although the nocent cry upon
Clemency, yet the innocent forbear not to reverence it. Moreover, Clemency
has place in the person of those that are innocent, because the quality of
the persons puts them in danger; and Clemency not only assisteth the
innocent, but oftentimes virtue likewise by reason, that the tim^s may become
such, that such things may be oppressed and punished, which should be praised.
Moreover, a great part of men may grow to an amendment in their lives; yet must
we not always pardon the greater number that offend. For where the difference
betwixt good and bad men is taken away, there follows a confusion and a
breaking forth of errors. There must therefore be some moderation practiced
that know^th how to distinguish good minds from reprobate; neither ought a
Prince to have a confused and vulgar, neither too restrained Clemency: for it
is as great cruelty to pardon all, as to pardon none. We must hold a mean;
but because moderation is hard to be observed, whatsoever is like to be more
then equity requires, must incline more to humanity then rigor.

CHAP. II.
But these things shall more fitly be decided in another place: Division of the
Book.
for the present I will divide this matter into three parts. The first shall
serve for a Preface or Induction. The second shall express the nature and
habitude of Clemency: for whereas there are vices that counterfeit virtues,
they cannot be diistnguished except thou set down some marks whereby they may
be known. Thirdly, we will enquire how the mind attaineth to this virtue, how
he fortifieth himself thereby, and by use makes her his own. But it must
needs appear that of all other virtues there is none more convenient for man,
because there is none more humane then it: and not only amongst us Stoics,
who maintain that a man is a sociable creature, and is made for the common
good of others; but also amongst those that give m^n over to pleasure, all
whose speeches and actions tend to their particular profit. For if a man seek
for repose and idleness, he has found in Clemency a virtue agreeable to his
nature which loves peace and restrain^th the hand. But of all others Clemenci^
becomes no man more then it does a Prince: for so is great power honorable
and full of glory in great Potentates, if they use it for the comfort of many;
as contrariwise force is pernicious that serves to no other end but to offend
others. A man cannot sufficiently express how firm and well grounded his
greatness is, whom all men ^now ^o b^ as much for them, a^ he is more highly
raised above them, whom they observe to k^^pe continual watch; for the safety
of them all in common, and of every one in particular^ upon whose approach they
run not away^ as if any evil ne^red them, or that some cruel beast broke
out from his den, but they flooke and ^^n unto him, as to a gracious and
shining sun, ready and addressed to adu^^ture upon their weapons who have
plotted treasons against him, and to make a bridge of their bodies for him, if
for the conservation of hi^ life it w^r^ n^edfull for him to march upon the
bodies of men that were m^ngled and ^ut in p^ec^s. They which about him during
the time that he sleeps, by day th^^ they in^l^ (...) this^ person on every
side, and lest any one should hurt him they expose themselves to all dangers
for him, whatsoever they be that present themselves. This consent of Nations
and Cities, in loving and maintayning their Kings, and employing their body
and goods in defense of a Princes life, is grounded upon good reason. Neither
is this baseness and madness in them for one man, yea, and he sometimes old
and decrepit, in so many thousands to attempt upon the points of their enemies
weapons, and to redeem one soul by the death of many, and that one an old
and weak man sometimes. An excellent comparison.
Even as the whole body serves the soul, and by means thereof seems more
great and of fairer appeareance, whereas the soul contrariwise, lies hid and
invisible, without any certain knowledge in what place it remains; and yet
notwithstanding the hands, the feet, the eyes do serve the same, the skin as
her Bulwark defends her, and she it is that stays or makes us run
hither or thither at her pleasure; so that if she be covetous we travel whole
Seas to become rich; if ambitious, we presently o^fer our right hands to be
burned, or we voluntarily leap into the fire: so this infinite multitude which
inuiron one only soul, is governed by the same, and guided by reason it
self, which would otherwise depresse and oppress her own forces, except she
were sustained by his counsel.

CHAP. IIII.
THey therefore love their own safety, when as for one man they lead ten
legions to the battle, The love be^weene Prince and subject is the maintenance
of an estate.
when they run resolutely to the charge, and present their breasts to be
wounded, to the end their Emperors coulors should not be taken. For he it is
that is the bond, whereby the Commonwealth is fastened together; he is that
vital spirit by which so many thousands live: of her self she should be
nothing but a burden and pray, if so be that soul of the Empire were taken
from her. The King in safety, all men live in peace,
The King once lost, the^ faith and troth does cease.
Such an accident shall extinguish the peace of Rome, To govern well and to
obey well are the two sinewe^ of an estate.
this shall bring the fortune of so great a people unto ruin. So long shall
this people be freed from this danger, as long as she knows how to endure
government, which government if at any time she shall shake off, or having
cast it off by any casualtie, shall refuse to undergo again this unity and
contexture of so great an Empire, shall be divided into many parts, and even
then shall Rome cease to command when she refuses and neglects to obey It
is not therefore to be wondered at that we love Princes, Kings, and Tutors of
public States (by what name soever they be called) more then our private
familiars. For if men of the best judgment do think that that which
concerns the Commonwealth is of greater importance then that which touches
their own particular, it follows that he, upon whose safety the whole
Commonwealth has an eye should be more dearly lo^ed th^n any other. In time
past Caesar so united and enbosomed himself in the Commonwealth of Rome, that
the one might not be separated from the other without the ruin of them both;
for as he had need of forces, so had they of a head.

CHAP. V.
IT seems that this my Discourse is estranged too far from mine intended
purpose, By the similitude of the head and members, that Clemency is wholly
necessary to Princes, since their subjects expose themselves to all dangers
for them.
but to speak the truth, it nearly concerns the matter. For if it be so as
we may truly conclude, that thon art the soul of the Commonwealth, and she
the body; Thou see, as I think, how necessary Clemency is: for thou
seem to spare thy self when thou sparest others. Thou ought therefore to
bear with evil subjects, no otherwise then thou would do with languishing
members^ and if sometimes there be need of bloodletting, take heed lest the
vein be opened more largely then the sickness requires. Clemency therefore,
as I said, is agreeable unto all men's nature, but especially it best befitteth
Princes, because in them she finds more people to preserve, and a greater
matter wherein to show herself. For how little hurts a private cruelty? but
Princes displeasure is a war. But whereas amongst all virtues there is a
certain concord and agreement, neither is the one more better or more honest
then the other, yet are there some virtues that are more fit for some persons.
Magnanimity becomes every mortal man, yea, even he that is the most basest
and abiectest man of the world. For what is greater and more manly then to
repulse adverse fortune? Yet this magnanimity shows it self more amply in
greater fortune, and appears more powerful in the Tribunal then near the
earth. Into whatsoever house Clemency comes, she makes the same more
peaceable; but in the Palace the rarer it is, the more wonderful it is: for
what is more wonderful then he against whose wrath nothing can make head, to
whose severe sentence even they that are condemned give consent; whom no man
will question with, why he did this, nay if he be extraordinarily angry, dare
entreat for any thing; to lay hold on himself, and to use his power more
mercifully and mildely, and to think this in his ^eart no man can kill
contrary to law, no man can pardon but my self? A great mind becomes a
great fortune, and if he mounteth not himself as high as she is, and if he
raise not himself above her, he embraces her likewise, and brings her to
the ground. But it is the property of a great mind to be pleasing, peaceable,
settled, despising all injuries and offenses, as being raised to a higher
estate. It is a womanish quality to be enraged with wrath, and after the
manner of wild beasts (and they not the most generous) to bite and trample
down those that are under their feet. Elephants and Lions pass by those whom
they have murdered and cast down. Those beasts that have no noble heart are
the most obstinate. Inexorable and cruel Anger b^commeth not a King; for he is
not very much eminent above him, with whom by reason of displeasure, he makes
himself equal; but if he give pardon, but if he give dignity to those that
have endangered and deserved to loose their estates; he does that which no man
else can do, except he that has power and principallity: for life is often
taken from him that is a superior, but never given to him that is an
inferior. To save is the property of an excellent fortune, which may never
more be wondered at, then when he has gotten the opportunity to do that which
the gods do, by whose benefit both good and evil men are borne into this
world. That Prince therefore that takes upon him the mind of the gods, let
him willingly entertain some of his subjects because they are good and
profitable, leave the rest as men to make up the number, let him rejoice that
some are, and other some let him suffer.

CHAP. VI.
Cruelty dispe^pleth Cities and Countries, merci^ makes them fortunate.
Think what solitude and desolation there would be in this City (in which a
World of people going and coming incessantly by the spacious streets cease
not to justle one another as oftentimes as something hinders their walk
which is as a violent torrent which a man would stay, in which three streets
are requisite at one time, for three Theaters and in which as much corn is
consumed as is gathered in many Countries) if a man should leave none but such,
as a severe Judge would absolve. Who is he amongst the receivers and
treasurers that shall get his Quietus est, if he be as strictly examined: as he
does others? Is there ever an accuser without a fault? And I know not whether
there be any man more difficult to give pardon then he that has often deserved
to beg the same. We are all faulty, the one more, the other less, the one
of deliberate purpose, the other being driven there unto by adventure, or
drawn by other men's wickedness. Sometimes we have not constantly perseuered
in one good resolution, and have lost our innocence with grief, and in spite
of our selves; neither only ^or the present do we amiss, but until the last
hour of our life, we shall be still full of sin. Although a man has so well
purged his mind that nothing can trouble or deceive him any more yet by
sinning he attainted his innocence.

CHAP. VII.
A most strong reason to persuade Princes to be merciful to their subjects.
BEcause I have made mention of the gods behold hear an excellent pattern
which I present unto a Prince, to conform himself thereunto (that is to say)
that he deal with his subjects in such sort as he would have the gods to
deal with him: were it expedient for us that the gods should never excuse our
pardon or faults, but that they should persecute us with all rigor? Should
there be any great Prince in this World be found who should live in assurance
and whose members the Aruspices should not gather up? But if the merciful and
just gods punish not the faults of mighty men by confounding them by
lightning, how much more just is it, that a man who has the charge over men
should exercise his Empire with merciful mind, and think whether the state
of the World be more gracious or fairer to the eye, in a fair and bright day,
or when as all things are shaken with thunder-crackes and lightnings flash on
every side. But one and the same is the estate of a quiet and moderate Empire,
of a fair and shining Heaven. A Kingdom where cruelty reigns may be
compared to a troublesome and obscure time, under which every one trembles and
waxes pale, by reason of the sudden crackes of thunder, and where he that
troubles others is as wonderfully troubled for his own part. We pardon those
private men more easily, who revenge themselves obstinately, for they may be
hurt, and their sorrow comes from injury. Besides they fear contempt, and
not to revenge an injury, seems rather to be an infirmity then Clemency.
But he that may easily revenge, and yet forbeareth the same, obtains a
certain commendation of mercy. Men of bare quality may more freely exercise
their hands, contest, strive, and give liberty to their passion. The strokes
betwixt equals are light, but exclamation and too much intemperance in words,
ill beseems Majesty.

CHAP. VIII.
Think thou it a grievous matter, that the liberty of speech should be
taken from Kings and permitted to inferiors? This say thou, is a servitude
and not an Emperie. But their condition is different, who lie hidden in
community which they exceed not, whose ver^ue appear not but struggle long
time, and whose vices lie hidden in obscurity. But common report awakeneth
your actions and words, and therefore there are no men that should be more
careful of their reputations, of whom men speak much, and in diverse places,
whether they do well or ^uill, How many things are there which are unlawful
for thee, but permitted us by thy benefit. I may walk alone in any part of the
City without fear, although I be accompanied by no man, and no man attend me
from home, and without any sword by my side, but in the fullness of thy peace
thou must live armed. Thou can not wander from thy Fortune, she will besiege
thee, and whether soever thou go a great train will follow thee. Behold
whereunto sovereignty is subject, she cannot become less, but this necessity
is common to thee with the gods. For they are tied unto Heaven, it is not
permitted them to descend from thence, neither is it secure for thee to descend
from the throne of thy greatness. Thou art nailed to thy greatness. Few men
know our dessignes and business, we may go forth and return and change our
fashion without any public note taken of us. Thou can no more be hidden
then the Sun. A great brightness inuironeth thee round about, toward which
all men bend their eyes. Think thou that thou come forth? no thou risest
like the Sun. Thou can not speak but all the people of the World
understand and mark what thou say. Thou can not be angry but all men
tremble. Thou can not afflict any man, but all that are about thee shake for
fear. Even as the lightnings fall to few men's peril but to all men's fear, so
the chastisements of mighty Potentates are more full of fear then of evil,
and not without cause. For in him that can do, all men consider not what he
does, but what he may do. Moreover, patience makes those private men, disposed
to endure those injuries that are offered them easily enough; But Clemency is
a more assured safeguard to great men. Because a frequent revenge represseth the
hatred of a few men, but provoke infinity others. The will to revenge ought
sooner to fail then the cause. Otherwise as the trees that are pruned, spread
forth in many more branches, and many kinds of seeds, are cut to the end they
may grow more thicker, so the cruelty of a King increases the number of his
enemies in extinguishing them. For the Parents and Children, the Allies and
Friends succeed in their place, who are slain.

CHAP. IX.
HOW true this is I will admonish thee by a domestique example. Caesar Augustus
was a merciful Prince, if any man shall estimate him, from that time he
undertook the Empire (although in the common calamity of the Commonweal,
his sword was unsheathed.) When as he had grown to those years of age
whereunto thou have now attained, and had gotten ninet^ene years on his back;
and had hidden his dagger in the bosom of his friends, laid ambushes to defeat
Mark Anthony the Consul, being one of the Confederates in the Triumuirate;
about the fortieth year of his age, and being resident in France, there was
tidings brought unto him, that Lucius Cynna a man of weak judgment had
conspired and plotted treason against him. It was told him where, when, and how
he should be attempted by one of those, who was a party in the confederacy.
Whereupon he resolved to revenge himself upon him, and caused a counsel of
his friends to be assembled. He took no rest that night, where as he thought
with him self, how he should put a young Gentleman to death of Noble
parentage, and who but for this one fault was upright enough: and besides was
Cneius Pompeius Nephew. Now could he not execute one man alone, because at
supper time he had discovered to one that was called Anthony the whole edict
of the proscription: G^i^uing therefore and disquiet in mind, he uttered
diverse speeches, and each of them contrary the one unto the other, what then
(says he) Shall I suffer him that would murder me to walk at his pleasure,
and shall I live perplexed. Shall he remain unpunished, who not only has
resolved to kill me, but to sacrifice me (for their intent was to assail him
at a a sacrifice) who have bin assailed in vain by so many civil wars, and
attempted by so many battles both by Sea and Land? After some pause and silence
he exclaimed again more violently against him self, then against Cynna, and
said why live thou, if thy death be profitable and pleasing to so many? When
shall I see the end of so many punishments? is there not blood enough shed yet?
my head is the mark whereat so many young Roman gentlemen's swords are aimed. Is
my life so dear unto me that for the conservation thereof, so many souls
should perish? At last Liuia his wife interrupting his discourse, The great
wisdom of Liuia.
said unto him: Will you vouchsafe a woman's counsel? Do that which
Physicians are accustomed to do. Who when as usual remedies take no effect,
do attempt the contrary. Hitherto thou have profited nothing by severity.
After Saluidienus thou have ruinated Lepidus, after Lepidus Murena, after
Muraena Caepio, after Caepio Ignatius, without reckoning up the rest, whose
impious and impudent attempts make me ashamed. Now make thou trial what thy
mercy will profit thee. Pardon Lucius Cynna, his treason cannot be d^nied;
he cannot hurt thee now^ but may increase thy renown Caesar being glad, that
he had met with such an advocate, gave his wife thanks, and presently
discharging those friends he had called to counsel, he caused Cynna alone to
be called unto him, and commanding all the rest out of the Chamber, after he
had commanded them to set Cynna a chair fast by him, he begun thus. This
first of all do I require at the hands, that thou interrupt me not, neither
that thou exclaim in the midst of my discourse, hereafter thou shall have
liberty to speak. Thou know Cynna that having found thee in mine enemies
Camp; and known thee not only to be a sugg^sted, but a born enemy unto me,
how I saved thy life, and restored thee to all thy patrimony. At this day thou
art so happy, and so rich that the Conquerours bear envy against thee that
were conquered, when thou wast a suitor for the Pontifice, I gave it thee
neglecting diverse others whose parents had attended me in my wars. Having
thus and so well deserved at thy hand^, thou have resolved to murder me. When
as Cynna began to cry out, that such madness was far from him Augustus
staid him and said. Thou keep not thy promise with me Cynna? for it was
agreed between us that thou should not interrupt me. I tell thee thou
preparest to kill me, he told him the place, the confederates, the day, and the
order of the ambush, and who was the man should strike the stroke. And when he
perceived him troubled, and not only silent because he had promised to be so,
but because he was guilty. With what mind said he do thou this? To the end
that thou thy self may be Emperor? Truly the Common^weale should be
hardly incombred, if none but I were the let of thine authority and dignity.
Thou can not govern thine own house. Of late a franckling of thine has had
the credit to condemn thee in justice for particular affairs. Is this the
easiest business thou can undertake to contest and contend with Caesar? Take
it to thee, if I be the only man that hinder thy hopes, I surrender it;
Paulus, Fabius Maximus, the Cossi and Seruilians and so many Gentlemen of
value, and Children of such worthy persons, that do honor to their Statues,
think thou they will indur^ thee? But least in repeating his Oration, I
should fill up the greater part of this volume, who was well known to have
debated with him for the space of two whole hours, after he had long time
discoursed upon that punishment wherewith he would content himself, he add^d.
Well Cynna once more I give thee thy life, before times as to mine enemy, now
as to a Traitor and a Paracide. From this day forward let friendship be
continued between us, and let us strive to the uttermost to make it known,
whether I have given thee thy life with a better heart, The effect and fruits
of mercy.
or thou accepted the same with a more assured thankfulness. After all this of
his own accord, and unasked h^ gave him the Consul-ship, complaining of him
that he durst demand nothing, so that ever after Cynna was a most affectionate
and faithful servant of his, and made him his heir, and never after this did
any man conspire against Augustus.

CHAP. X.
THY great grandfather gave them life, Other testimonies of Augustus his mercy.
whom he overcame, for had he not pardoned them over whom should he have had
government? Salust, the Coccians, the Duillians and all the Soldiers of the
first company of his Guard had borne Arms against him, notwithstanding he
inrowled them, and chose them to be the nearest about his person. The
Domitians, Messalaes, Asiuians, and Ciceroes, and all the most famous
personages in Rome were indebted to his Clemency. How long time bare he with
Lepidus? he suffered him for many years to walk with that Equipage that
became a Prince, and would not suffer the Office of high Bishop to be
transferred unto him, except it were after his death, for he had rather that
it should be called an honor then a spoil. This Clemency of his brought him
to that security and felicity which he inioyed, this made him grateful and
gracious in all men's eyes, although he had laid hold on the Commonweal, who
as yet knew not what it was to endure the yoke of subjection, such a name at
this day does this mercy of his give him, that other Princes will hardly
obtain during their lives. We believe him to be a God, not by any decree or
ordinance: we confess that Augustus was a good Prince, we acknowledge him well
worthy of the name of the father of his country, for no other cause then for
this, that he revenged not those contumelies that were offered him (and which
in Princes ears are wont to sound most harshly) no more then he did his
actual injuries, for that he smiled at reproachful speeches that were offered
him, for that he seemed to punish himself when he persecuted others, for that
whomsoever he had condemned for the adulteries of his daughter, he was so far
from executing them, that in their dismission, and for their better security
he gave them pasports and safe conducts. This is truly called pardoning, that
when thou know that there are diverse that are addressed to be angry for
thee, and gratify thee if thou have caused any to be put to death, thou not
only contentest thy self to give life, but also procurest that he to whom
thou have given it be maintained and conserved.

CHAP. XI.
To persuade Nero to continue his Cl^mencie, he compares him with Augustus
Caesar, and shows that Ne^o had the advantage in this respect, because his
predecessor had that praise also after his cruelty committed, he in the
entrance and infancy of his government.
THus Augustu^ behaved himself when he was old, or at leastwise when old age
began to seize upon him: In his youth he was hot, wrathful, and did many
things which he never looked back unto without remorse. No man dare compare
Augustus courtesy to thy Clemency, although he equal thy young years with
his more then mature age. Suppose that he were moderate and merciful after he
had dyed the Actian Seas with blood of Romans, sunk in the Scicilian both his
own and foreign ships, sacrificed a great number of men upon the altars of
Perusa, and caused many multitudes of men to be put to death in the time of the
Triumuirate. But I call not this Clemency, but wearied cruelty. The true
Clemency and mercy, O Caesar, is that which thou show, which has not
begun with the repentance of cruelty, thine is not soyled, thou have never shed
the blood of Roman Citizens. This in a Prince is the true temperance of a
mind, and an incomprehensible love toward mankind, not to be enkindled with
any desire or rashness, not to be corrupted by the example of former Princes,
not to weigh how far his authority may extend over his subjects, but to dull
the edge of the Imperial sword and dignity. Thou have exempted thy Citti^, O
Caesar from all bloody massacres, and performed this, which with a great mind
thou may glory in, That through the whole world thou have not shed one drop
of man's blood: and the more great and wonderful it is, because the sword was
never committed to the hands of any one more younger then thy self. Clemency
therefore does not only make men more honest, but more secure; What care
Princes should have to make (...) ^nd^ngs answerabl^ t^ his beginnings.
and is not only the ornament but the assured safety of Kingdoms, who through
Princes have attained long life, and left their governments to their children
and nephews, but the power of tyrants is execrable and short. What difference
is there betwixt a Tyrant and a King? In appeareance they have one and the same
dignity, the difference is, that Tyrants take pleasure in their tyranny,
Kings do justice but upon cause and necessity.

CHAP. XII.
WHat then, are not Kings sometimes accustomed to put men to death? The
difference betwixt good Princes and Tyrants.
It is true; but so often as they are assured that it is for public profit.
The Tyrants heart is set upon murder. But a Tyrant differs from a King in
fact, not in name. For Dionysius the elder may justly be preferred before
diverse Kings. And what lets us to call Lucius Sylla a tyrant, who gave over
killing when he found no more enemies? Although he forsook his Dictature, and
took upon him the robe of a private Citizen: yet what Tyrant has there ever
been that so greedily drunk up humane blood, then he was who commanded seven
thousand Roman Citizens to be slain? And when as being in counsel in the
Temple of Bellon^, near unto the place where the execution was done, he had
heard the cries of so many thousands that groned under the sword; and
perceiving that the Senate was affrighted thereat. Let us intend our business
(says he) Fathers Conscript, these are but a few seditious persons, whom I
have commanded to be slain. He lied not herein; for these seemed but a few in
Syllaes eyes. But hereafter we will learn by Sylla how we ought to be angry
with our enemies, especially if being separated from the body of Citizens,
they have taken upon them the name of enemies. Mean while, as I said,
Clemency effects this, that there is a great difference betwixt a King and a
Tyrant, although both of them are environed with guard^. But the one makes use
of these forces to maintain peace, the other that by great fears he may
pacify great hatreds. Neither securely does he behold that very guard, to
whose custody he has committed himself, but one contrary thrust^th him into
another; for he is both hated because he is feared, and will be feared because
he is hated, and uses that execrable verse which has overthrown many; And
let them hate me so they fear.
Not knowing what fury is engendered in the hearts of subjects when their
hatreds are increased above measure. For a moderate fear restrains men's
minds, but a continual violence, and such as is raised even unto the brimme,
awakeneth and emboldneth those that are deepest asleep^ and gives them courage
to hazard all. If thou keep sau^ge be^sts soulded up in gins and nets, a
horseman may assault them with his weapons at their backs, yet will they
attempt their flight by those places they were wont to fly, and will spurn
fear underfoot. That courage that grows from extreme necessity is
marvelous forcible. Fear must leave us some gap to escape out at, and show us
less danger then hope, otherwise he that was not determined to de^end
himself, seeing himself in equal danger, will adventure upon dangers, and
hazard tha^ life which he esteems not his own. The forces which a peaceable
Prince shall gather for the good of his subjects are faithful and assured; and
the brave soldier who seems to adventure for public security, endures all
travail willingly, as being one of the guards of the father of his country.
But as touching the violent and bloody Tyrant, his guard must needs be
aggrieued at him.

CHAP. XIII.
A description of the misery of Tyrants and cruel Princes, all intending to
this point, to recommend Clemency more and more.
NO man can have ministers of a good and faithful will whom he uses in
tormenting, in racking, and butchering men to death, to whom he exposes men no
otherwise then he would to beasts. Such a one lives in no less pain and
torment then those whom he holds in prison, because he fears both men and
gods as witnesses and reuengers of his crimes, and who is already come to that
pass, that he dare not change his manner of living. For amongst all other
things cruelty has this cursed evil in her, that she is incorrigible, she
perseuereth and is not able to recover any other better course. One wickedness
must be sustained by another. But what is more unhappy then he is, who cannot
choose but be evil? O how wretched is that man, but truly to himself? For as
touching others, it were very ill done by them to have pity of him who has
exercised his power with slaughters and rapines, who has fear of all things
as well domestique as foreign, that fearing arms has recourse unto his
weapons, neither trusting to his friends faith nor his childrens piety: that
having regarded in all sorts that which he has done, and that which he
pretends to do, and coming to open his conscience replenished with
mischiefs and torments, oftentimes fears death and desires it again as
often; more odious to himself then to those that serve him. Contrariwise, he
that has the care and charge of a Commonwealth, although he have a more
intent eye to the conservation of some things more then other things, yet
entertaineth all the members of the State as carefully as those of his body,
enclining always unto sweetness: and if it be expedient for him to do
justice, he shows that having no enmity or beastliness in his heart, it is
to his hearts-griefe that he lays his hand on his weapon. Such a one,
desiring to approve his government to his subject, exercises his power
peaceably and to all men's profit, reputing himself in his own judgment
sufficiently happy, if he shall make his fortune and condition known, affable
in speech, facile in access, amiable in countenance, which most of al wins
the peoples hearts, favorable to honest enterprises, enemy to evil designes^
he is loved, defended, and reverenced by all the world. The same speak men in
secret of him as they do in public. They desire he should have issue, and
that sterillity caused by wars and other public evils should be abolished:
no man doubts but that he shall deserve well at his childrens hands, to whom
he shall show a world so happy. This Prince living in security, by his own
means, has no need of guard or garrisons, he uses his arms as the means of
his ornament.

CHAP. XIIII.
Another instruc^o^ for a ^rince, to teach ^im to keep a measure in his mercy.
WHat therefore is his duty? That which belongs to good Parents, who are wont
sometime to admonish their children gently, sometimes to chastise them with
threats, and sometimes with stripes. Does any man of a settled judgment
disinherite his son upon the first offense, except many and mighty injuries
overcome his patience? except there be somewhat more that he fears then that
which he condemns, he will not blot him out of his Testament. He assayeth
diverse remedies before hand to reclaim him from his dissolute and inconstant
disposition, but when he has no more hope then assaieth he his last remedies.
No man comes to practice his extremest chastisements, except he has
consumed all his remedies. That which the Parent does, the same ought a Prince
to do: whom we have called the Father of the Country not led thereunto by
vain adulation. For those other names are given for honor sake. We have
called them Great, Happy and Augusti, and have heaped up whatsoever titles we
could invent for ambitious Majesty: attributing them unto these. We have
called him the Father of the Country, to the end he might know, that he had a
fatherly power given him over his Country, and consequently very moderate,
careful of his children, and providing for their good, rather then his own
particular. If the father must cut of some one of his members it shall be as
late as he can, and after he has cut it of, he will desire to revive it again,
and in cutting it of, he will tigh and differ long time, and in diverse sorts.
For he that condemns too soon condemns willingly also, He that chastises
over severely, ordinarily chastises unjustly. In our memory the people of
Rome stabbed to death a Roman Knight called Erixo, with their bodkins, for
whipping his son to death. Scarce could the authority of Augustus Caesar
redeem the same from the hands of displeased Fathers and children.

CHAP. XV.
ARIVS having discovered, that his own son had attempted and conspired his
death, Having compared a good Prince to a Father, he makes mention about the
end of the precedent section of an evil Father and here of a good, to the end
to express by the same that a good Prince ought to assay all means in respect
of his subjects before he descends to extreme rigor.
after he knew of the fact banished him, for which act of his all the people
commended him, especially for this that having banished the parracide to
Marsillies, he furnished him, with as great an anuall pention, as he had
allowed him before he had trespassed in this sort. This liberality was the
cause, this liberality of his was the cause, that in that City, where the
baddest causes want no advocates, that no man doubted but that he that was
guilty, was deservedly condemned, since the Father who could not hate him, had
the courage to condemn him. By this very example I will give you the means to
make a comparison betwixt a good Prince, and a good Father. When Titus Arius
would draw his son into question, he called Augustus Caesar to counsel, who
came from his own palace to this private man's house, sat down^ as a party of
the counsel; and he said not why came he not to my house? which had it happened;
the censure of the fault had been Caesar's, and not the fathers. The fact being
understood, all circumstances examined, the young man having been heard in his
defense, and his answers and accusations considered. Caesar required every one
of the Counsailers to set down their opinions in writing, to the end that no
man should subscribe to his opinion, or if he spoake that other men should
follow him: and before that the billets were opened, he swore that he would not
be Titus Arius heir, who was reputed a rich man. Some base fellow will say,
that Caesar was afraid, lest he should seem to give entrance to his hope by
the condemnation of the young man. But I think otherwise, that every one of us
to defense our selves against the false opinions, that men might conceive
against us, ought to fix our selves upon the assured confidence of good
conscience. Princes ought to do many things, to get them a good report. He
swore that he would not be his heir. That same day Arius lost another son
but Caesar redeemed the liberty of his sentence, and after he had approved
that his severity was without respect of recompense; of which thing a Prince
should have an especial care always, he sentenced him to be banished to that
place where his father should think fit. He judged him not to be sowed up in a
sack, to be made a pray for Serpents, or to die in prison, remembering himself
that he sat not there as a Judge, but as a Counsailer to the father. He said
that the father ought to content himself with the mildest kind of punishment,
in regard of his son; who was as yet young and drawn unto this wicked act, in
pursuit of the execution whereof, he had showed himself to be fearful, which
excused him in some sort, and that it sufficed therefore to banish him from
Rome, and from his fathers presence.

CHAP. XVI.
By comparison of fathers and Masters and others in authority, and by the
example of their government be teaches a Prince how vnseem^ly a thing cruelty
and too much severity is.
O Prince, worthy always to be called by fathers into their Counsel, worthy
to be made coheire with their innocent children. This Clemency becomes a
Prince, that whether so ever he comes, should make all things more mild. Let
no man be so abject in a Princes eye, that he has no feeling of his death or
danger, whatsoever he be, he is a part of the Empire. Let us make a
comparison, betwixt the smallest Kingdoms and the greatest Empires; There is
but one kind of Government. The Prince commands his Subjects, the father his
children, the master his scholars, the Captain or Lieutenant his Soldiers.
Shall he not be reputed a wicked father, who with continual whipping upon the
sleightest occasion, seeks to still his children? Whether should that Master
be more worthy the liberal studies, who fleaeth his Scholars, if they have
not exactly remembered their lessons; or by reason of their weak sight have
faulted in their reading; or he that had rather mend them, and teach them by
admonitions and modesty? Give me a Captain or Lieutenant that is cruel, he
will make his Soldiers forsake him, and yet these are to be pardoned. Were it
a reasonable matter, to handle a man worse then we do bruit beasts? But he
that is a good breaker of horses, terrifieth them not with often strookes, for
by that means he will become more fearful and stubberne, except thou handle
and stroke him with a gentle hand. The same does the Huntsman, who teaches
his hound to draw dry foot, and who uses those whom he has already trained
to the game to rowse or hunt it. Neither does he often threaten them, for
therefore their courage is directed, and whatsoever forwardness is in them, is
daunted by degenerate fear; neither does he give them liberty to wander and
stray here and there. To these may thou add those that have the driving of
slower Cattle, which being bred unto reproach and misery through too much
cruelty, are enforced to refuse their yoke.

CHAP. XVII.
Since a man is ^he (...) untamed creature of the World, we ^^ght to handle him
gently.
THere is no living Creature more untoward, none more intractable by heart then
a man is, yet no one is to be spared more then he; For what folly is it for a
man to be ashamed to spend his spleen upon Dogs, and Horses, or Asses, and
to entreat a man more rudely? We cure sicknesses and yet are not angry with
them, but this disease of the mind requires a gentle medicine and th^^ he
who cures the same should not be angry with the sick. It is the part of an
evil Physician to despair that he shall not cure. The same ought he^ to do
to whom the security and protection of all men is committed, in those whose
minds are affected, he must not suddenly cast by his hopes, neither
incontinently pronounce what deadly signs there are in the infirmity. Let him
strive with vices and resist them, let him vpbraid some with their infirmity,
deceive other some by a gentle cure, because he i^ likeliest more soon and
better to heal them by deceivable medecines. Let a Prince endeavor carefully
not only to cure but also to give a smooth cicatrix to the wound of offense. A
King obtains no glory by cruel punishment for who doubts but he may^ But
contrariwise his glory is most excellent, if he contains his power, if he
deliver many from the fury of their Enemies, and ruinat^th no man by his
displeasure.

CHAP. XVIII.
IT is an honor to know how to command a man's servants modestly, Another
reason taken by comparison betwixt the greater and the less^r if all things ar^
not lawful in a Master over his servants, they are no less lawful for a
Prince over his subjects that are men.
and in our slave we are to think not how much punishment he may endure and
we inflict upon him without reproof, but what the nature of right and justice
will permit thee: which commands us to spare our Captives and such whom we
have bought to be our bond-slaues. How much more just is it for thee not to
abuse men free, ingenious, and honest, as thy bond men, but to entertain them,
for such as are under thy gouernment^ to defend them as thy subjects, and not
afflict them as thy slaves. It is lawful for bondmen to fly to Caesar's
statue. Although we have authority to do what we list with our slaves,
there is somewhat which the common right of living Creatures permits us not
to execute upon a man, because he is of the same nature that thou art. Who
hated not Vedius Pollio more worse then his own slaves did, because he fatted
his Lamproies with man's blood? and commanded those that offended him to be
cast into the fish-poole to what other end then to feed Serpents? O wretched
man worthy a thousand deaths, whether he presented his slaves to be devoured
by those Lamproies he would feed upon, or whether to this only end he
nourished them, that in that sort he might nourish them. Even as cruel Masters
are pointed at through the whole City, and are reputed both hateful and
detestable: so the cruel demencie of Princes, who have contracted infamy and
hatred against them selves, are inregistred in Histories to be a hatred to
posterity, Had it not been better never to have been borne then to be
numbered amongst those that are borne for a public misery?

CHAP. XIX.
THere is no man that can bethink him of any thing that is more seemly for
him that is in authority then Clemency in what manner soever, Now ^oncludes
^e as in a g^n^ral sentence that which he said in the beginning that mercy is
the most noted virtue in Princes.
and by what right soever he has the pre-eminence over others. And the more
higher his dignity is that is endued with this virtue, the more noble shall
we confess his ornament, to be which should not be hurtful but composed
according to the law of nature. For nature has invented Kings, which we may
know by other living Creatures and in particular by Bees, whose King has the
largest room in the Honey Comb, and is lodged in the middle and most securest
place. Besides he labors not but examineth the labor of the rest, and when
their King is lost the whole swarm is dispersed, also they suffer but one,
making choice of him that is the boldest in fight. Moreover the King is noted
for his seemelinesse, in that he differs from the rest both in greatness and
goodlinesse: yet herein is he most distinguished from them; Bees are the most
angry and fellest Creatures that be, according to the capacity of their
bodies, and leave their stings in the wound, but their King has no sting.
Nature would not have him cruel nor to seek revenge that might hazard his
life, and therefore took away his weapon, and disarmed his wrath. All Kings
and Princes ought to consider this excellent example. It is the custom of
nature to discover her self in little things, and the least Creatures
minister unto us the most noblest examples. Let us not be ashamed to learn
some good thing of the smallest Creatures, since the mind of man ought to be
more settled then evil which he does is hurtful and dangerous. By my consent I
would have man reduced to this condition that his wrath should be broken with
his own weapon, and that he might have no more means to hurt then once in his
life, nor exercise his hatreds by an other man's hands: for easily would fury
be wearied; if of necessity she should act that which she her self
commands, and if she should express her power by the harzard of her life:
neither as yet is she secured in her match. For she must needs be surprised
with as much fear, as she would have other have fear of her, her eyes be
fixed on every man's hands, and at such times as a man intends not to touch
her, she believes that he will assault her, and has not one only minute of
repose. Is it possible that any one would live so unhappily, when the means is
offered him to pass his days without the hurt of any man, and consequently
execute the affairs of his charge in all security, and with great
contentment? He abuses himself that supposes that a King is secure in that
place, where there is not any one but is afraid of him. One security must be
assured by an other mutual security. We need not build strong Citadels, on
high hills, nor fortify inaccessible places, nor cut down the sides of
Mountains, nor ensconce our selves with many walls and towers. Clemency will
secure a King in the open field. His only inpregnable fortress, is the love of
his Citizens. What more worthy thing can a Prince wish for, then to live in
all men's good opinion, and in such love of his subjects, that their vows and
prayers should incessantly and secretly be powered forth for his security:
that if his health be crased, they listen not after his death, but are
wonderfully afraid, least they should loose him? that there is nothing so
precious in any one of their eyes, that they would not exchange for his health,
and security; that thinks that whatsoever has befallen the Prince, is
fatal to themselves? Hereby the Prince has approved by continual arguments
of his goodness, that the Commonweal is not his, but that he is the
Commonweals. Who dare contriue any danger toward him? who would not if he
could, prevent any disaster that is toward him, under whom justice, peace,
modesty, security and dignity do flourish, under whom the wealthy Cities
abound in the plenty of all good things? neither with other minds reverence
they, or behold they their governor, then if the immortal gods should
vouchsafe them the liberty to behold themselves. And why does not he that
follloweth the nature of the gods, which is to be gracious, liberal, and
powerful, to do good, become a second to them? This is it that becomes a
Prince to affect, this ought he to imitate: and as they desire to be the
greatest, so let them endeavor to be the best.

CHAP. XX.
THe Prince is accustomed to do justice for two causes, Having generally
discoursed of Clemency and Mercy at this present: in way of partition, he
digesteth and gathers together that which has been said in diverse Chapters,
and shows that whether a man regard the person of a Prince, or of a private
man, there ought no cruelty to be used.
either punishes he the faults that are committed against himself, or against
another. I will will first of all speak of that which concerns him. For it
is a harder matter for a man to temper himself, when he chastises others, to
satisfy his private disgust, then to propose it for an example. It were in
vain in this place to admonish a Prince, not to believe lightly, to examine
the truth, to favor innocence, that it may appear, that he is no less
careful to examine that which concerns him that has offended, as that which
touches the Judge. But this appertains to justice, and not unto Clemency.
For the present we exhort him, that being manifestly wronged, he remain Master
of his own heart, and give over punishment, if so be he may safely do it; or
at leastwise differ it, and be more inclined to pardon those faults which are
committed against himself, as against others. For even as he is not liberal,
that cutteth a large thong out of another man's leather, but he that takes
that from himself which he gives to another: So will I call him merciful,
not that weepeth, and is agrieued at another man's affliction, but him who
having just and urgent occasion, passionateth not himself, and knows that it
is the act of a great mind in the height of his authority to suffer injuries,
and that nothing is more glorious in a Prince, then to pardon those who have
offended him.

CHAP. XXI.
Revenge is ordinarily wont to produce two effects, A subdiuision of his
matter, tending to that which he has spoken of, and showing that sinner that
by revenge, neither increases nor maintains his estate, he ought not to
suffer him self to be mastered by such a passion.
for either it brings him comfort that has received the injury, or puts
him in security for the time to come. A Princes Fortune is so great, as it
needs not such like solace, and his power is more manifest, then that he
need to seek the opinion of his greatness from the ruin of another. This,
say I, when he is assaulted or violated by any of his inferiors, for if he
sees those who sometimes were his equals, become his underlings, he is
sufficiently revenged. A Servant, a Serpent, an Arrow have slain a King. No
man has saved a King, except he that saved him were greater then himself. He
therefore that has attained the power over life and death, ought to use so
great an authority bestowed upon him by the gods courageously, especially
toward those, who in his knowledge have sometime opposed themselves against
his greatness: having attained this dignity, he is sufficiently revenged, and
has done that which was requuisite for an entire punishment. For he that
should die, has lost his life, but whosoever from a high degree, has been
prostitute at his enemies feet, where he attends the definitive sentence of
his Crown and life, lives to his great glory, that preserves him: and
adds more to his renown by his life, then if he had sentenced him to death.
For he is the continual spectacle of another man's virtue. In a triumph he had
quickly past by. But if his Kingdom likewise may safely be r^deliuered into
his hands, and he might be restored to that pre-eminence from whence he was
fallen, his praise rises above all measure, that was contented from a
conquered King to take away nothing but his glory. This it is to triumph truly
in a man's victory: and to testify that he found nothing worthy in the
Conquerours hands, that was answerable to his worthiness and value. As
touching our Citizens and men that are unknown to us, and such as are of base
condition, the more moderately must we deal with them, the less honor we
shall get by afflicting them. Pardon some men willingly, disdain to revenge
thy self on other some, and retire thy hand from them, as if they were some
little silly creatures that would soil thy fingers, if thou should touch
them; but as touching those that are either to be pardoned or punished in the
eye of the State, make use of the occasion of thy accustomed Clemency.

CHAP. XXII.
He prosecuteth his partition, and sh^weth that a gentle chastisement profits
more, both to him that is chasticed, and to the Prince himself then cruel
vigor.
LET us pass over to those injuries that are done unto another, in punishing
which the Law has observed three things, which a Prince likewise ought to
follow, either to amend him whom he punishes, or to the intent that his
punishment may make the rest better; or that by cutting of the evil, the rest
may live more securely. Those, shall thou more safly amend with less
punishment, for he lives more diligently, that has some days of his life
pardoned him to live in. No man cares for his decayed dignity. It is a kind
of impunitie not to be able to be punished any more. But the fewness of
executions reformeth the Cities manners the more. For the multitude of
offenders breeds a custom of offense, and the note of infamy is the less,
the greater the number of delinquents there be: and severity by being over
usual loses her authority, which is the greatest honor she has. That
Prince setleth good manners in his City, and more happily extinguisheth the
vices thereof, if he wink at them, not as though he allowed them; but as if he
were agreiued at them, and with great hearts-griefe, was enforced to punish
them. The Clemency of him that gouer^eth makes them ashamed that offend. The
punishment seems the more gr^^uous, when the sentence is given by a merciful
man.

CHAP. XXIII.
That continnall and cruel punishments, do not so much repress offenses, as
the prudent Clemency of Princ^s.
BEsides, thou shall s^e those things oftentimes committed which are often
times punished. Thy Father within the space of five years sowed up more
paracides, then were condemned to that death in all the ages before, as far
as we can gather. As long as there was no law established against this heinous
crime, no children durst attempt or imagine this so unnatural a wickednesse^
For those Lawmakers and notable persons most wise and well experienced,
thought it better to make no mention of this crime in their Laws, as a most
incredible matter^ and such as man should not be so cursed, as to imagine, then
to publish by the establishment of severe laws against the same, that so
horrible an offense might be committed. Parricides therefore began with their
law, and their punishment taught them their offense: Piety was in a desperate
estate after we saw these sackes more often then gallowses. In those Cities
where men are punished very seldom, every one agrees to live innocently, and
they entertain innocence as a public good. Let the City think her self
innocent and she shall be: if she see the number of such as are dissolute is but
small, she is vexed the more. Believe me, it is a dangerous matter to let a
City see that there are more wicked then good.

CHAP. XXIIII.
THere was a decree set down in times past by the Senate, He proves for the
third point both by similitudes and examples, that punishments assure not good
men.
that our slaves and freemen should be distinguished by their attire, but
afterward it appeared what danger was imminent if our servants should have
begun to have numbered us. Know this, that if no man be pardoned, this is
likewise to be feared, that it will quickly appear what advantage the worser
part has over the better: no less dishonorable are many punishments to a
Prince, then many funerals to a Physician. He that governs more mildely, is
obeyed more willingly. Man's mind is naturally rebellious, overthwart and
proud, he follows more willingly then he is led. And as generous and noble
horses are better guided by an easy bit, so voluntary innocence follows
Clemency of her own motion: in the City this sweetness is a good that
deserves to be maintained. So then there is more gotten by following this
way. Cruelty is humane evil, it is unworthy so mild a mind: this is a
beast-like rage to rejoice in blood and wounds, and laying by the habit of a
man, to translate himself to a wild beast.

CHAP. XXV.
FOr tell me Alexander, I beseech thee, whether of these two is more strange,
either that thou command Lysimach^^ to be cast unto the Lions, or that thou
thy self tear him in pieces with thy eager teeth. The throat and cruelty of
the Lion is thine own. O how gladly would thou have had these claws, and
that great throat, capable to devour and swallow men? We request thee not that
this hand of thine, which has put to death three of thy dearest friends,
should do good to any man, nor that thy felon heart, the insatiable ruin of
Nations should glut it self otherwise then in blood and murders: we will take
it for thy Clemency, and so call it, if in murdering thy friend thou make
choice of an executioner amongst the number of men. This is the cause why
cruelty is most of all to be abhorred, because she passes the bonds, not
only of custom but of humanity. She searches out new punishments, and
applies her mind thereunto, she inuenteth instruments to multiply and prolong
pain, and to content her self in those torments which other men suffer. Then
does that dire sickness of the mind grow into most desperate rage, when
cruelty is turned into pleasure, and to murder men is reputed a May^game. For
such a man is attended by confusion, hatred^, venoms, swords, by as many
dangers is he assaulted as he is the danger of many men, and sometimes by
private counsels and sometimes by public calamities he is surprised and
circumuented. For the slight and private overthrow of some particulars,
incenseth not whole Cities: that which begins to rage on every side, and
indifferently attempteth all men, armeth every man against it. The smaller
Serpents slip by us; neither are they much sought after, but if any one waxes
above ordinary measure and bigness, and becomes a monster, when he has
infected the fountains by drinking in them, and scortched with his breath, and
rent with his tallants whatsoever he treads upon, we shoot at him with
Bali^tils and Crosbowes. The smaller evils may speak fair and so escape, but
we make head against the great ones. If there be but one sick in a house, it
makes no great matter, but when it appears by the death of many that the
plague is there, the City cries out and every man flies, and each man lifts
up his hands to heaven. If some private house be set on fire, the neighbors
bring in water and quench it; but when the fire is scattered abroad, and lays
hold on many houses, it cannot be quenched but by the ruin of a part of the
City.

CHAP. XXVI.
He shows what danger it is for a man to take pleasure in cruelty, and how
much good Princes get by amiable and courteous entertainment. He concludes
that Clemency is the fairest flower in their Garland.
Servile hands likewise have revenged the cruelty of particulars, although
they saw their death before them. The cruelty of Tyrants, the Nations, people
and those that were oppressed, and such as were most nearly threatened thereby,
have attempted to confound. Sometime their own guards have conspired against
them, and exercised upon them that perfidiousnesse, impiety, and cruelty which
they themselves had learned of them. For what can any man hope from him whom he
has trained up to be evil? wickedness appears not long time, neither
sins she as much as she is commanded. But put case that cruelty be assured;
what a Kingdom has she? No other then the form of sacked Cities, and the
terrible faces of public fear. All things are sad, troublesome and confused,
even the pleasures themselves are feared: they banquet not securely, and in
their feasts though they be drunk they must have a watch over their tongu^^:
they cannot trust their Theaters where men seek occasions to accuse and put to
death now this man, now that man^ when their banquets be prepared with greater
charge, and Kingly riches, and by the excellent invention of cunning Artists,
who is he, I pray you, that would take pleasure to depart from his sports to a
prison? Good gods what a mischief is this, to kill, to rage, to delight in the
noise of shackles, to cut off Citizens heads, to shed blood in every place,
wheresoever he comes, to terrify men and make them fly from his terrible
looks? What other life would there be if Lions and Bears did reign? if
Serpents and every other noisome creature should have power over us? They being
void of reason, and being condemned by us for the crime of immanitie, abstain
from those of their own kind, yea, and similitude is a protection amongst the
savage beasts; but amongst men only rage forbareth not his dearest friends, but
makes one account of strangers as of homebred, whereby he may more busily
creep into private men's slaughters, and afterward into the ruin of Nations.
He reputeth it to be for his royalty to cast fire upon houses, and to plough
up old Cities: he believes it to be scarce Kingly to command one or two to
be slain, except at one time a troop of miserable men stand subject to his
sword, he accounts his cruelty to be enforced (...) not the Chariot^ of
barbarous Nations be sprinkled with blood, no^ spoyl^s g^tten i^ warre^ T^is i^
a diu^ne power t^ save men by companies, and publicly: but to murder many,
and they unheard is the act of a Tyrant and Murderer.

The end of the first Book of Clemency.
A DISCOVRSE OF CLEMENCY, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA To NERO CAESAR. The
second Book.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
ONce more he praises NERO and his excellent voice. Then passes he over to
the second part and shows the Nature of Clemency, and defines the same. He
explaineth it the more by the contrary vice, and brings forth Cruelty and
describes it. Afterward he limiteth Clemency, and will have it removed from
Compassion, for this is a vice amongst (...) give pardon, but to spare and to
provide for, and (...) is the end of the Book, (...) things are wanting, (...)
to be sorrowed for in so worthy a Tract: which had it not been in my
judgment this second Book had, equalled the first.

CHAP. I.
He animateth Nero to continue in his well begun government, with that
plac^bilitie he has thetherto used, he secondeth his Counsels with praises
which serve as spurs to a good mind.
THat which most chiefly moved me Nero Caesar to address and dedicate this
discourse of Clemen^i^ unto thee, was a speech of thine which not only rauishe^
me with admiration, at such ^ime as I hard it, but as when afterward I
recited it to others. A generous speech, the argument of a great mind and
greater lenitie^ which was not studied for o^ fitted to flatter other men's
ears, but suddenly brake forth; and brought thy beauty that co^tended with
thy Fortune into the public eye and censure of all men. Burrus a Captain of
thy Guard, a man of honor and known by us for such a one, having charge to
carry two theefs to execution, labored, that thou would sign the sentence
that was given against them both: which being deferred diverse times, he
insisted at last that it might be dispatched. But after that, to thy own
hearts-griefe and thy dist^st h^ had drawn the writing out of his bosom, and
delivered it into thy hands thou cryedst out^ I would I could neither read nor
write. O speech worthy to be heard by all those Nations that inhabit the
Roman Empire, and by those neighbor Countries, that are scarcely assured of
their liberty, and by those likewise who both in mind and might arm
themselves against their prosperity. O very worthy to be revived in the open
assembly of all living men, and whereof Kings and Princes might make use when
they should tak^ their oath unto their Subjects. O speech worthy the ancient
innocence of Mankind, in ^auour whereof the former ag^s should wax young
again. Truly this is the body wherein all of us ought to accord in equity
and Clemency, driving far from v^ this coueteousnesse to enjoy other men's
fortunes, whence all the infirmities of the mind do aris^. Now it is that
piety, integrity, loyalty, and mod^stie, should lift ^p their heads^ and
that vices which have so ty^^nnously dominered over v^ long time, should
finally quit their place, and resign it to an ag^ more happy and pure.

CHAP. II.
I Dare well hope and promise Caesar that the greater part hereof shall come to
pass^. He presageth the continuance of Neroes Clemency, to the comfort of his
Subjects and the amase of his enemies.
This Clemency of thin^ shall by little and little be published, and spread
through all the body of thine Empire, and all things shall conform themselves
according to the example which thou give them. Good health proceeds from
the head, and afterward causes that all the members are nimble and strong,
as contrariwise they languish, if the spirit that quickneth them, be amated.
And both thy Citizens and associates shall be worthy of this bounty, and
good manners shall be re-established through out the whole World, and shall be
extended in every place. Suffer me to insist a little longer one this point,
not to the intent to (...) flatter thine cares, for it is not my custom. I had
rather offend thee in speaking truth, then please thee by flattery. What is
the cause then, why I desire thou should be so familiarly exercised in the
knowledge of thy good words and actions? Truly no other but that one day thou
may say and do that with judgment, which now thou say and do by a
natural aptitude of thy mind. This consider I with my self that many great,
but they detestable speeches of Princes are entered into men's hearts, and are
ordinary in their mouths as this. With deadly hate let them pursue me,
Provided always that they fear me.
Whereunto resembles that Greek verse who wills that when he is dead, The
solid Earth should with the fire be mixed.
And others of this kind: But I know not how such spirits, so prodigious and
so hateful, have expressed their violent and furious conceits in a more
plentiful manner. I have never as yet heard a proud word uttered by a good and
merciful Prince. What is it then that thou art to do? Forsooth this, that as
slackly as thou may and with some remorse; and with some delays also until
such time as thou art enforced thereunto, thou write that which draws thee in
hatred of good letters, yet so as thou do in temporizing and delaying diverse
times.

CHAP. III.
What Clemency is, and the definitions thereof.
BUT least some time this goodly and pleasing name of Clemency should happily
deceive us, let us see what Clemency is, what a one she is, and to what end
she tends Clemency then is a moderation of the mind, that restrains the
power which ^ man has to revenge himself, or it is a gracious moderation of
the superior toward his inferior, in establishing of punishment. The surest
way shall be to set down diverse definitions, for fear least one suffice not
to express the same, and that the form thereof (if we may so speak) escape
us not. One may therefore say, that it is an inclination of the mind, tending
to show himself merciful when he ought to chastise. This definition will have
some opposition, although it be such a one as draws nearest the truth. If
we say that Clemency is a moderation remitting somewhat of the punishment
which is deserved and due, some one will reply that there is not any virtue
that does less then she ought. But all men know that Clemency is that virtue
which reb^teth some what of that which she might exact. They of weakest
judgment suppose that severity is opposed against it, but never was one virtue
contrary to another.

CHAP. IIII.
Of Cruelty opposed against Clemency, and the definitions and kinds thereof
laid open by examples.
WHat therefore is opposed to Clemency? Cruelty which is no other thing then a
cruelty of mind in exacting punishments. But there are some that are cruel
although, they do not punish any: such as they are who kill men whom they
never saw, but met with in the way, not to the intent to lessen the number, but
killing them because they took pleasure in killing. Moreover not content to
murder, they tortured more bodies as Busir is Procrustes did, and those
Pirates who first of all beat their prisoners and afterward burn them to
death and dust. Truly this is cruelty, but because it follows not revenge
(for she was not injured) neither is displeased at any man's offense (for no
crime has ouerslipped before) it is not comprised in our definition, which
definition contained an intemperance of the mind in exacting punishment. We
may well say that this is not cruelty, but beastly fury which takes pleasure
to torment the body, and we may likewise call it madness, for their be
diverse kinds thereof, and none more certain then that which extends it
self to murder and massacre men. I will therefore call them cruel, who have
no occasion to punish, yet such as keep no measure, such as Phalaris was, who
not contenting himself with putting innocents to death^ exceeded in his
executions all humane and probable measure. We may to avoid all ^^^ill, say
this cruelty is an inclination of the mind unto most grievous punishments.
Clemency drives this cruelty far of from her, because she has better
correspondence with severity. It is very pertinent to the matter to enquire
in this place what mercy is, for diverse men praise her for a virtue: A
paradoxe of the Stoickes, which Aristotle answers in the fourth of his
Ethickes and Mor^als.
and call a good man merciful. But this is an imperfection of the mind,
Cruelty and Mercy are the two extremes of Severity and Clemency, we must
fly both, the one and the other, for fear least under appearance of Severity
we become cruel, and under color of Clemency show our selves merciful.
There is not so great danger herein, but they that fall into one extremity are
as much out of the way, as they that fall into the other.

CHAP. V.
EVen as therefore Religion reuerenceth the gods, In this Chapter, he
maintains the Doctrine of the Stoickes, Against affection, approouing that
those Philosophers were not so unnatural as they were reported to be.
so Superstition violateth them, so all good men should show Clemency and
Meekness, but avoid mercy. For it is naught else but a baseness of the heart
which melts in beholding an other man's miseries. It is therefore most
familiar to those of the basest metals and minds. Such as are old women and
tender hearted females, who weep to see them weep, that are condemned, who
would willingly break up prisons, if so be they were permitted to do it.
Mercy regards not the cause but the condition, but Clemency is conjoined
with reason; I know that amongst ignorant men, the sect of the Stoickes is
condemned, for being over severe and such a one as could not give good
counsels to Kings and Princes. For it is objected against them that they will
not suffer the wise man to use mercy, and to pardon. These objections
considered a part, and by themselves are odious. For this were to cast all
those headlong into despair that have offended, and to subject all offenses to
punishment. If this be so, who are more severe then this sect, which
forbids us to remember that we are men; and exclude mutual help which is
the assuredest Haven against the tempest of Fortune. But I say that there is no
sect more benign and gentle then this is, nor that loves men better, nor that
is more intent to the good of all men, in such sort as all the scope thereof,
is to serve, succor and procure the good, not only of his Scholars, but also
of all other men as well in general as in particular. Mercy is an infirmity
of the mind, by reason of the appearance of other men's mise^ies, or a sadness
conceived for the evils an other man suffers, and supposes that he suffers
them wrongfully. For a wise man neither troubles nor tormenteth himself, his
understanding is always clear, neither can any thing happen that may obscure
the light thereof. Nothing becomes a man more then greatness of courage; But
he cannot have a noble heart, that fear and sorrow may animate it, or any of
these passions obscure or contract it. This shall not befall a wiseman; no, not
in his calamities, but he shall dart back again all these arrows that
Fortune has shot against him, and shall break them before her face. He shall
retain one and the same countenance, always both peaceable and constant,
which he might not do if sorrow were lodged in his heart. Ad hereunto that a
wiseman is provident, and has his counsel in a readiness; But that which is
clear and pure, never proceeds from sadness, which is a trouble of the
Soul, and is not proper to examine any action; nor to invent profitable
things, neither oportunely to avoid dangers. So then a wiseman is not moved
with sadness for an others misery, because he is exempt from misery; but
otherwise, he will willingly and with a joyful heart, do all that which the
merciful would do against their wills.

CHAP. VI.
The description of a wise man according to the doctrine of the Stoick^s.
HE will assist his neighbor that weepeth, without weeping himself; he will
lend him his hand that is in danger to be drowned; he will lodge him that is
famished, feed him that is poor, not with outrage, as for the most part they
do, who would be esteemed merciful, who disdain and repulse the poor when
they aid them, and fearing least they should touch them, but as a man to a man
he will give, as out of the common purse. He shall pardon the Son for his
Mothers tears, command his greiues to be loosed; he shall preserve him from
the fury of wild beasts, to whose rage he should have been exposed, to the
content and pleasure of the people, he will bury the carkies of him that was
condemned; But he will do all this with a peaceable mind, and without change
of countenance. He will not therefore be moved, but will help, will profit,
as being borne for the common good and the service of the Commonweal, whereof
he will give every one his apart. Yea, he will extend his bounty to the
miserable by proportion, and will reform such as are wicked and to be amended.
But to those that are afflicted and oppressed, he will yield his assistance
more willingly. As often as he may, he will not suffer adversities to touch
them. For how might he better employ his forces and riches, then in relieuing
those whom the inconstancy of worldly affairs has overthrown. He will
neither be abashed nor dismaide, to behold the disfigured face of a sick man,
or a beggar, or of an old man leaning on his staff, but he will assist all
those likewise that deserve, and after the manner of the gods, behold with a
bountiful eye the poor that are oppressed. Mercy is a near neighbor to
misery, for she has, and draws somewhat from her. Know that those eyes are
weak which are bloudshot themselves, in beholding another man's suffusion: even
as assuredly we ought not to call them joyful but sick, who cough upon every
occasion, and that yawne as soon as they perceive an other man open his mouth.
Mercy is an imperfection of the mind, that is too much affectioned unto
misery, which if a man seek for in a wise man, it were as much as if he
should require him to cry out at the Funerals of those whom he never heard
of. It remains to declare why a wise man pardons not.

CHAP. VII.
A qu^stion depending on the ^orme^ discourse, wheth^r a wise man pardons? He
answers by distinction to maintain that which he said of Mercy.
LEt us now set down likewise what pardon is, to the end we may know that a
wise man ought not to give it. Pardon is a remission of deserved punishments.
But why a wise man ought not to pardon, is fully debated by those who decide
this matter to the full. For mine own part to speak shortly, as in a matter
reserved to an other man's judgment, I say that he is pardoned that should be
punished. But a wise man does nothing but that he ought, neither pretermitteth
any thing of his duty, and therefore he quitteth not the punishment which he
ought to exact, but that which thou would obtain by the means of pardon,
he gives thee by a more honest expedient. For he supporteth, counsaileth,
corrects, and does as much as if he pardoned, although he pardon not, because
he that pardons, confesses that he has omitted something which ought to be
done. He will be contented to admonish some without chastising them,
considering that they are old enough to amend. He will dismiss an other in
safety, although he be apparently guilty, because he has been deceived, and
fell into the offense being drowned in wine. He will dismiss his enemies in
safety, and sometimes with commendations, if they have undertaken War upon
honest grounds, as for their faith, confederate^ or liberty. These are not the
works of Pardon but of Clemenci^^ Clemency has ^ree will, she judges not
according to use and custom, but according to equity and r^ght, and she may
absolve and tax the charges at what rate she lists. He does none of these
things, as if he had done any thing less then iust^ but as if that which he
had co^stituted were most just; ^ut to ^ardon is ^^is, ^ot to ^^nish those
things which thou iudgest worthy of punishment. Pardon is the remission of a
deserved punishment. Clemency effec^eth this principally, that she declares
those whom she dismisseth to be exempted from the punishment they should
suffer. She is therefore more accomplished and honest then pardon. In my
judgment, the controversy is upon the word not upon the matter. A wise man
will forgive many things, and save many that are scarcely wi^e, yet such as may
become capabl^. He will imitate good husbandmen, who not only cherish
straight and tall trees, but applies vnder-props likewise to uphold those
which are made crooked by some accident. They loppe some lest the
ouer-thicknesse of their bows do hinder their grouth, they nourish some that
are infirm by reason of the sterrilitie of the soil, and to those that spring
under the thickness of a covert, they give them open air. According to these,
a wise man shall see how he ought to entertain every nature, and by what
means those that are depraved, may be strengthened and straightned. Many
things are here wanting.

The end of the second Book of Clemency.
A TRACT OF BLESSED LIFE, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO JUNIUS GALLO HIS
BROTHER.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
He wrote this Book when he was old, and set it down for an Apology
against those that calumniated his wealth and behavior. He approoueth that
Blessed life consists in virtue, yet that she despises not these external
things if they befall her. It is a lofty writing, and excellent in the parts
thereof, and because it contains golden sentences and excellent sayings.
There are two parts thereof; First, what Blessed life is, and how a man may
attain thereunto. As touching the former, he denies that it is to be sought,
either in Opinion or Manners; if we keep the ordinary way, we stray the
farther from her. Reason only is to be given care unto, (...) says that
B^essed life is agr^^^ble to (...), that is placed in virtue, not in pleasure
a^ EPICVRVS ^^^ld have it, No^ and diff^^edly he refelleth this with the slaves
thereof; so far as h^^ will neither have pleasur^ joined with virtue, but
abolisheth this name utterly; This till the sixteenth Chapter. Thence follows
the other part to the attainement therof^ therefore ^s o^^ly Virtue to be
embraced. And are the rest to be despised? He denies it; He says that
external things may be admitted, but not as the end. Yea, ^ee maint^^^eth,
that the^ wh^ as yet are but in the way, and amongst the number of those that
are pr^^^^ient, have need of some indulgence of fortune. Here cunningly and
^anfully enough defends he his own cause, and induces an adversary to say:
Why have thou (...) of Vert^^? have thou not other helps. Why have thou
servants, Mo^ey, F^r^^s, and H^^shold-stuffe? He answers diversely? And first
of all that he is (...) wise man, but that he endeavors to be wise.
Afterward for these worthy men, PLATO, ZE^LO, ARISTOTLE, against whom in times
past these were objected. Virtue is a ^^igh matter; They are to be honored
who labor to ascend, although du^ing their (...), they fall^r are hindered.
Then purposely speaks he of Riches, whether a wise (...) ought to have them;
From the one and twenty Chapter. And he auerreth that they are had but not
beloved, yet gotten honestly that they are, and must be spent b^^^tifully^ He
whetteth his Style against th^se l^ng-tongued bablers, and under the person of
SOCRATES, armeth the edge of ^is Style against them But the end is wanting,
and those things that are usually added, are of an other man's writing, and of a
different Argument^

CHAP. I.
ALL men brother Gallio are desirous to live happily, It suffices not to
desire happiness, we ought to know what true happiness is, and afterward by
what m^^^^^^ we attai^e thereunto.
yet blind are they in ^ore-seeing that which makes the life blessed and
happy: and so difficult a matter is it to attain this blessed life, that the
swifter every man is carried with adesire to compass her, the farther off
departs he from her, if he have failed in the way: which when it leads us
to the contrary, the very swiftness thereof is the cause of our greater
distance from her. First of all therefore we ought to consider what that is
which we require: then to look about us by what way we may more speedily
attain thereunto, being assured that in our journie (so the way be true and
straight) to vndrstand how much we have daily profited, and how nearer we
are unto that whereunto our natural desire impelleth us. As long as we wander
hither and thther and follow not our guide, but the dissonant brute and
clamor of of those that call on us to undertake different ways, our short
life is wearied and worn away amongst errours^ although we labor day and
night to get us a good mind. Let us therefore advise both, whether we tend,
and by which way we pretend; and walk forward under the conduct of some wise
man who is exactly instructed and practiced in those paths which we are to
tract. For the condition of this voyage is far different from other
peregrinations: for in them if any certain^ place be limited, and we do but
inquire and question with the inhabitants of that place, they will not suffer
us to wander; for here the worst way, and that which seems the most shortest
and usual does most of all deceive us. There is nothing, therefore that is
more to be prevented by us, then that we follow not like innocent sheep, the
troop of those that walk before us, walking forward not whether we should
address themselves, but whether we are led by other men. But there is nothing
that entangleth us in greater miseries, then that we couple and apply our
selves to every rumor, supposing those things to be the best which is most
approved and received by the conceit of all men, and whereof there are most
examples, and live not according to reason, but only according to other men's
fashion. From thence proceeds this so great heap of men tumbling one upon an
other. That which falls out in a great press of men, when the people
themselves, throng themselves, where no man so falls, but that he draws
down an other after him, and the foremost are the cause of the ruin of those
that follow: this may thou observe, and see it fall out in every estate of
life. There is no man that erreth to himself, but is either the cause or
Author of other men's error. For much are we hurt because we apply our selves
to those that go before us, and whilst every man had rather believe, then
judge, we never judge of our lives but content our selves always to believe:
thus error delivered unto us from hand to hand, vexes and ouerturneth us, and
we perish by other men's examples. But we shall be healed, provided only that
we separate our selves from the vulgar, but now the people stand out against
reason in defense of their own error. This therefore comes to pass that is
usual in Common Assemblies, wherein, those men whose voices made the Praetor,
admire to hear him named; when the inconstant favor of such a multitude has
whirled it self about. We approve and condemn one and the same thing. This
is the end of all judgments in decision whereof diverse men give their opinions.

CHAP. II.
He taxes those who think themselves well go^erned if they ^ollow the multitude.
WHen the question is of happy life, thou must not answer me according to the
custom of those debates which are censured by voices. This part seems the
greater; for therefore is it the worst: Humane affairs are not disposed so
happily that the best things please the most men. It is an argument of the
worst cause when the common sort applaudeth it. Let us enquire what is best
done, not what is most usually done; and what planteth us in the possession of
eternal felicity, not what is ordinarily allowed of by the multitude, which
is the worst interpreter of truth. I call the multitude, as well those that are
attired in white, as those that are clothed other ways, for I examine not the
colors of the garments wherewith the bodies are clothed, I trust not mine
eyes, to inform me what a man is, I have a more better and truer light,
whereby I shall distinguish truth from falsehood. Let the soul find out the good
of the soul. If once she may have breathing time to retire her self into her
self, O how will she confess unto her self, after she has been examined
by her self and say: Whatso^uer I have done, yet I had rather it should be
undone; Whatsoever I have said when I recollect it, I am ashamed of it in
others; Whatsoever I wished I repute it to be the execration of mine enemies;
Whatsoever I feared, good gods, how better was it then that which I desired? I
have quarrelled with many men, and (if any society be amongst evil men) I
have altered their hatreds and drawn my self into favor with them; and yet
as yet I am not friends with my self. I have endeavored to the uttermost to
get in favor with the multitude, and make my self known unto every man by
some noble action: what other thing did I but oppose my self against weapons,
and show hatred a place wherein he might bite me? See thou these who praise
eloquence, that follow riches, that ^latter authority, that extol power? all
these are enemies or can be enemies, for in effect they are all one. How great
soever the number be of those that admire, as great is there number who do
envy.

CHAP. III.
Since we seek for that good which is truly and not apparanth good, let us not
derive our example, either from the ^xterior ap^ear^ce or the public applause.
WHY rather seek I not some thing out, which is good in use that I may find in
my mind, not show in outward appearance? These things where at we gaze, these
things whereat we ^taie, and with admiration one man shows unto another, do
outwardly shine, but are inwardly miserable. Let us seek our somewhat that is
good not in appearance, but solid and united, and fairest in that which
appears the least. Let us discover this, neither is it far from us, we
shall find it. Yet had thou need to know whether thou should stretch thy
hand. But ^ow as if we were in darkness we pass by these things that are
nearest us, and stumble upon those things which we desire. But least I draw
thee through a Labyrinth I will let slip other men's opinions, for it were too
long a matter to reckon them up and confute them, and let thee know our own.
And when I tell thee ours, I will not tie my self to any one of our principal
Stoickes: I have authority enough to speak what I think, I will therefore
follow some one, I will command another to give a reason of his, and happily
being cited after all others, I will disalow none of those things which the
former have decreed, and I will say: This think I over and beside, and in the
mean while following the common consent of the Stoickes; I will consent to
Nature which is the mother of all things. For it is wisdom not to wander
from her, but to form our selves according to her Law and Example. The life
then is happy which is according to her nature, which can no otherwise happen
the^ if the mind be first of all sound, and in perpetual possession of her
health. Again, if she be strong, and vehement, and fierce, and patiently
likewise apt for the times, curious of the body, and those things that
appertain thereunto, yet not over careful or diligent in those things which
maintain life, disposed to use the presents of Fortune, without admiration of
any thing: without wondering at any of them, no ways inclined to servitude.
Thou understand although I aim it not, that from thence there follows a
perpetual tranquillity and liberty, driving away far from us all those
things that either provoke or terrify us much. For instead of the frail
pleasures, (and for those things that are small and frivolous, and that hurt
us at that time, when we make use of them to satisfy our passions) there
succeeds an excellent joy assured, and a continnall peace and repose of the
soul, and a greatness of the mind accompanied with mildness. For all fury
proceeds from infirmity.

CHAP. IIII.
A Man may likewise define our good after an other sort that is to say express
the same thing in other terms. The diverse d^finitions of a happy life.
Even as one and the same Army sometimes spreddeth it self out at large,
sometimes restrains and locketh up her self in a little place, either
bends her self like a Crescent with horns on either side and hollow in the
midst; or marches in a Batalion having wings to warrant them, and howsoever
she is disposed, yet has she always the same force and resolution to
maintain the party for which she is levied, so our definition of the
Sovereign good may sometimes be extended out a far, sometimes comprised in
few words and gathered as it were into it self. It will all come to one if I
say: The Sovereign good is a mind despising casualties, and content with
virtue: or an invincible force of the mind well experienced in the affairs of
this. World, peaceable in his actions, full of humanity and regard of those
with whom she conuerseth. It pleases us likewise to define it thus, that we
call him a blessed man, who esteems nothing either good or evil, except a mind
either good or evil, a respecter of honesty, content with virtue, whom
neither casualties extol nor depresse, who knows no other greater good then
that which he can give himself, who reputeth it for a true pleasure to
contemn pleasures. Thou may if thou will expatiate, turn this definition
into one or two other sorts provided that the principal remain. For what
forbids us to esteem him happy that has his spirit free, raised, assured,
and firm, estranged from all fear and desire, that esteems nothing but
virtue and disdaineth nothing but vice? All other the base multitude of things,
neither detracting any thing nor adding ought to blessed life, come and go
without increase or detained of the chiefest good. He that has laid so good a
foundation, shall be always followed whether he will or no, with a continual
joy, with a profound content that proceeds from excellent thoughts, because
he contenteth himself which he possesses, neither desires any more then
that he has at home why should he make a scruple to change willingly the
light frivolous and assu^ed, motions and pleasures of the body with goods, so
certain as these other are? that day he shall recence no pleasure that very
day shall he conceive no grief.

CHAP. V.
He confuteth those that set their felicity on pleasures of the body, and
defines what a happy man is.
THou may then see into what dangerous and miserable servitude he falls who
suffers pleasures and sorrows (two unfaithful and cruel commanders) to
posses^^ him successively. We must therefore issue out and find liberty and
this does no other thing give us then the neglect of Fortune. Then shall that
inestimable good arise, namely the repose of the mind retired into an assured
place, and mounted so high that she sees all the mists of errors
incontinently, scatter themselves in such sort that from the knowledge of the
truth, there proceeds a great and constant joy a sweetness and freedom of
conscience wherein the virtuous man shall take pleasure not as they are goods,
but as the fruits which proceed from the ground of that good which is in him.
Because I have begun to discourse liberally, I say that he may be called
blessed, who by the benefit of his reason, neither fears nor desires any
thing. I make mention of reason because stones, and beasts are both of them
destitute of fear and sadness, and yet no man will say that they are happy
Creatures, because they have no sense or understanding of felicity, put into
this rank, those men whose dullness of nature, and ignorance of themselves
has drawn them into the number of sheep and beasts. There is no difference
betwixt these and them, because the one have no reason and the other their
reason depraved, and if she discourses it is only to weaken and ruinate her
self. For no man can be called blessed, who is exiled from the truth. That
therefore is a blessed life which is grounded upon an upright, certain, and
immutable judgment. For then is the mind pure, and ex^mpt from all evils; when
it has no feeling of any rentings or prickings. Whatsoever resolved to persist
there, wheresoever she is settled, and resolute to maintain her abode, in
spite of wrathful and r^pyning Fortune. For in regard of pleasure, although it
be dispersed in every place, although she come from every part, and try and
attempt by all means whereby she may entangle us, ^yther in whole or in part:
what man is he amongst men that has any impre^ssion of manhood in him, that
will suffer himself to be flattered and tickled therewith day and night, and
forsaking the soul, will have a care of the body?

CHAP. VI.
BUT the soul likewise (says he) shall have her pleasures. An answer unto
these that would confound the pleasures of the body and the soul together.
Let her enjoy them, and let her sit as Judge over dissolution and pleasures.
Let her glut herself withal those things that are wont to delight the
senses. Furthermore, let her look back to those things that are past, and
remembering her self of her decayed pleasures let her enjoy those that are
nee^est her, extend her hand to the ^uture, ruling her hopes, and lifting up
her thoughts to that which is to come whilst the body tumbleth in delights
and surfets. This in my judgment is a mere misery, because it is a madness
to embrace the evil in stead of the good. Neither is any man blessed without
health, neither any man healthie, that longs for hurtful, and let
healthful things pass. He therefore is blessed, who has a right judgment.
Blessed is he that is contented with the present whatsoever they be, that is a
friend to his own affairs, blessed is he who in the government of his whole
life gives ^are unto reason. As for those that have said that the Sovereign
good consists in pleasure it behooves them to consider how sordid and abject
a place it is wherein they have lodged a thing so precious. For their excuse
they allege that a man cannot separate pleasure from Virtue, and they say
likewise that no man can live honestly except he be pleasant and jouiall: and
that to be joyful and honest, is one and the same thing. Yet see I not how
these two things may be coupled together. And why I pray you may not pleasure
be divided from virtue? Forsooth, because every beginning of good proceeds
from Virtue. From the roots hereof even these things spring which you love,
and desire so much. But if these were inseparable, we should not see that
somethinges are pleasing, but yet not honest, and some things most honest but
difficult and such as may not be recovered but by dolor and pain.

CHAP. VII.
Add hereunto likewise that pleasure intermixeth it self with a most vicious
life, A continuation of the former refutation where he shows that pleasure is
incompatible with Virtue, and consequently i^, which is estranged from the
chiefest good.
but virtue admits it not: It is with pleasure yea for pleasures sake that
some are unhappy. Which would not come to pass, if pleasure had intermixed it
self with virtue, which virtue often misseth never needs. Why unite you
things different, nay more, contrary. Virtue is a thing high, kingly,
invincible, infatigable; pleasure humble, servile, weak, frail, whose actions
and bounds are Tauernes and Brothell houses. You shall find Virtue in the
Temple, in the market place, in the Court, in the Court of Guard smoutered in
dust, ^^d with heat, having hard hands: pleasure of times lying hidden and
affecting darkness about bathes and Hot-houses, and such places as fear the
Constable, dainty, eff^minate, souzed in Wine, and P^rfumes, pale, painted,
and ^e ^^abor^d with medicine. The chiefest good is immortal, it cannot
perish, neither has it satietie, neither repentance, for the just mind is
never al^ered^ he is never hateful to himself, neither being her self the
best, has (...) ch^nged any thing. But pleasure at that time when she most
delighteth^ is extinguished^ Neither takes she up great room, and therefore
she quickly fills and loatheth, and after the first assault pineth away, and
as their is nothing c^^taine, whose nature is in motion so can there not be
any substance of that thing that comes and passes quickly, and such as is
like to perish in the very use thereof. For he has attained thither where he
should end, and in beginning he already regards the end.

CHAP. VIII.
In continuing his refutation, he declares what this manner of speech means,
that to live happily, and according to Nature, is one and the same thing.
FVrthermore the evil have their pleasures, as well as the good. And the basest
take no less contentment in their absurdities, then great men do in things
that are excellent. And therefore the Ancients have commanded, that we should
follow the better and not the most pleasing life. For Nature must govern us,
she it is that rules and counsaileth reason. To live then happily and
according to Nature is one and the same thing. I will now tell you what this
is. If we carefully and confidently conserve the goods of the body, according
as we ought, and as they are agreeable unto Nature, as gifts that have no
continuance, but communicable, from day to day: If we inthrall our selves not
to their servitude, and if those that have been distributed to our neighbors
possess us not^ if that which is agreeable unto us, and given us as an
overplus to the body serves us only in that Nature, as spies and forlorn
hopes in an Army: in brief, if they serve us and command us not, then may we
say that they are profitable and necessary for the soul. A man that is entire
ought not to be surmounted with exterior things, he must admire nothing but
himself, he ought to be confident, disposed against all casualties, a composer
of his own life, and see that his resolution be accompanied with science and
constancy, that that which he once has conceived, remain unaltered, and that
no exception accompany his resolution. It is understood likewise although I
add it not, that such a man be addressed and ordered as he ought, gracious
and magnificent in all his entertainments the true reason shall be ingrafted in
his senses, and take from thence his principles. For from thence it is and from
no other place, that she extends her self, to apprehend the truth, and
afterward returns into her self. The World likewise that imbraceth and
comprehends all things, and God who is the Governor of this World, extends
himself truly to exterior things, and yet he returns in every part
entirely into himself. Let our mind do the like, that after she has served
the senses, and by the means thereof, has extended it self to external
things, she may possess her self, in brief that she may l^e and stay her
self upon the chiefest good. By this means she shall become a faculty and
power according with her self; and that certain reason shall arise which is
neither shaken nor extrauagant in her opinion^, apprehensions or persuasions,
but being well ordered and well agreed with her parts with which she says,
(if we may so say) in the same time, she has attained the fulness of her
felicity. For she has no way that is rugged or slipperie to pass through,
neither any wherein she may stumble or fall. She shall do all that which she
lists, and nothing shall befall her that is unexpected, but all that which
she shall do shall turn to her good, easily, addressedly, and without delay.
For idleness and want of resolution discover contradiction and inconstancy;
thou may therefore boldly maintain that the peace of conscience is the
Sovereign good, because it must needs follow, that the virtues remain there
where consent and union have their abode, vices at are odds amongst themselves.

CHAP. IX.
BUT thou likewise (says he) honor Virtue for no other cause but for that
thou expectest some pleasure thereby. The peace of Consc^ence is the chiefest
good, but Seneca place^h this peace in the siedge of humane reas^n, which we
must bear with all in a S^oicke and a Pagan, who knew not what the gift of
regeneration was
First Virtue is not therefore sought after, because she brings with her
some pleasure, for she produces it not, and yet is not without it. Neither
labo^reth she for this, but her labor is, although she has an other aim to
attain this likewise. Even as in a field that is ploughed up for Corn, some
flowers spring up amongst the good grains, and yet no labor is bestowed on
this herb, although it delight ^he eye. The purpose of him that sowed the
Corn was far otherwise, this came by chance: so pleasure is not the reward
or cause of Virtue but an accession unto Virtue. Neither is it pleasing because
it delights; but because it is pleasing it delights. The chiefest good
consists and is grounded on judgment and the habit of a good mind, which
having fulfilled his habitude, and confined himself within his limits, the
chiefest good is consummate, neither desires any other thing more. For without
all them is nothing, no more then beyond the end. Thou art therefore deceived
when thou ask me, what that is for which I require Virtue: for thou seek
for somewhat that is above the chiefest. Thou ask me what I pretend from
Virtue? her self: for nothing is better, she is the reward of her self. Is
this a small thing, when I say unto thee, that the Sovereign good is an
inflexible vigor, a providence, a firm disposition, a liberty, a concord,
and beauty of the soul? do thou look for any thing more, whereunto these
may be referred? why namest thou pleasure unto me? I seek for the good of a
man, not of the belly, which is more disordered then any bruit beast.

CHAP. X.
THou pretendest to be ignorant (says he) of that which I say: That there is
neither content nor joy in the pleasures of this world, when they are never so
little separated from Virtue, which makes use of those pleasures with moderation
For I deny that any man may live pleasingly, except he live honestly
likewise: which cannot befall bruit beasts, which measure their good by their
bellies. I protest I tell thee both painely and publicly, that this life
which I call pleasant, cannot consist without the adjection of Virtue. But who
knows not that even the very foolishest amongst you are the fullest of
pleasure, and that iniquity abounds in delight, and that the mind it self
not only suggesteth some kinds of pleasure, but also many? First insolence and
over great esteem of a man's self, a pride surpassing all other, a blind and
improuident love of that which a man has, affluent delights, a joy proceeding
from trifling and childish occasions, detraction, and arrogancy, rejoicing in
contumelies, sloth and dissolution of the sluggish mind; that is benumbed in it
self. But these does Virtue discuss, she pulls us by the ear, and estimateth
pleasures before she admi^ them, neither cares she much for those, she has
entertained, (although she admit them) neither is delighted in the use of them,
but temperance is joyful: but when as temperance diminishes pleasures, she
injurieth the chiefest good in meddling with the same. Thou imbracest pleasure,
I moderate it. Thou enjoyest pleas^r^ I use it: Thou think it to be the
chiefest good I scarcely de^me it good. Thou do all things for pleasures
sake and I nothing when I say that I do nothing for pleasures sake I speak of
that Wise man to whom alone thou grantest pleasure.

CHAP. XI.
That the voluptuous person is not wise, and consequently is depriu^d of virtue
and has no part in Blessed Life.
BUT I call not him a wise man that is subject to any passion above all things,
if he be a vassal to pleasure. For being subject unto her how shall he resist
labor, danger, poverty, and so many tempests as storm about this life? how
shall he endure the sight of death and sorrow, how shall he sustain the
assaults of this World and of so many other dreadful adversaries, if he be
conquered by such an effeminate enemy? He will do all that which pleasure
persuades him unto. Go to: see thou not how many follies she will persuade
him to. She cannot say thou persuade any thing indecently, because she is
accompanied with Virtue. See thou not again what the chiefest good should be
if he had need of such a Guard to make him good. But how can Virtue govern
pleasure, when she follows her when as it is the part of a servant to attend,
and of a Master to command. You make her the servant that should command. But
you prefer Virtue unto a goodly office, you make her a taster to pleasures.
But we will see whether Virtue be lodged amongst those who have done her so
many outrages since she can no more be called Virtue, if she has given over
her place. In the mean while (for it is that whereof we intr^at) I will show
that there are diverse voluptuous men on whom Fortune has powered all her goods
whom thou must need, confess to be evil. Look upon Nomentanus and Apicius
two careful ingrossers (as these men call them) of whatsoever delicate either
Land or Sea affords, and who present upon their tables all the choice
Creatures, that are fit for meat in every Country. Behold these very men who
from there beds, behold their Kitchins, who fill their ears with Music,
their eyes with pleasing shows, and delight their pallats with sundry sauces,
with soft and gentle fomentations, all their body is suppled, and least in the
mean while their nostrils should be idle, that very place is filled with
diverse odours, wherein the funeral banquet of dissolution is celebrated. Thou will say that these men have their pleasures, yet are they not at their ease,
because they rejoice not in goodness.

CHAP. XII.
That the pleasures of wicked men are not truly pleasures but follies, and
^uries, contrariwise those of the wise are modest.
Evil will befall them (say thou) because diverse things happen in the
interim which trouble the mind, and contrary opinions shall disquiet the
spirits, which I grant that it is so. Yet notwithstanding those very fools.
Those inconstant fellows whom repentance attends at the heels receiving
great pleasure that we must needs confess that they are so far from al trouble
as from a good mind and (that which befalls many) they are pleasant fools,
and merry mad men. But on the contrary part, the pleasures of wise men are
remiss and modest, feeble enough secret and less observed, because they are
not sought after; and if they come without calling, they are less made account
of or entertained. For they intermix^ the pleasures of this life, as men are
wont to mingle their serious matters with sports and pleasant di^courses. Let
them desist therefore to join inconveniences, and to implicate Virtue with
Pleasure, for by such fals^ opinions they seduce those who are already to much
corrupted with vice. The one of the^e abandoned unto his pleasures always
drunk and tumbling on the Earth, knowing well that he lives voluptuously:
belieueth also that he follows the Tract of Virtue: because he believes
that pleasure cannot be separated from Virtue, and afterward intitleth his
vice^ with the name of wisdom, and publishes those things which should be
hidden. So these kind of men who have not learned it of the Epicure, surfeit in
their delights, and being drowned in vices, hide their voluptuous^esse in the
bosom of Philosophy: and have their recourse thither where they hear that
pleasure is praised. Neither estimate they rightly (for such undoubtedly is my
opinion) how sober and moderate his pleas^e is: but fly unto the name seeking
out a patronage and excuse for their lusts. They therefore loose that one good
which they had in evils which is the shame of offending. For they praise these
things whereof they were ashamed and glory in their vice and therefore youth
cannot rowse and recover it self, when they ascribe so fair a title to so
foul an error.

CHAP. XIII.
THis is the cause why this praise of pleasure is so p^rnicious because honest
precepts remain buried hereby, Why the praise of pleasure is pernicious.
and that which most corrupts is most apparent. But my opinion is (although I
speak it to the disgust of those of my Sect) that the precepts of the Epicure
are holy, right, and if thou examine them more nearly severe enough. For he
scantleth the wing of pleasure very much, neither gives her any liberty, but
imposes the same Law upon voluptuousness that we do upon Virtue. He
commands her to obey Nature, but that which suffices Nature is too little
for dissolution. What is it therefore? he that calls slothful idleness,
and the variety of gourmandize and dissolution, felicity; he seeks a fair
pretext for an evil thing, and whilst he comes thither being shrouded under
a name of respect he follows pleasure not that which he has learned; but
that which he had in her self, and thinking his vices had been taught him in
some School, he pleases himself in them, not fearfully, not obscurely, yea
he surfetteth on them in the sight and presence of all men, I will not
therefore say as diverse of our Stoickes do, that the Epicures Sect teaches
nothing but wickedness, but this I say that it has an evil report and is
undeservedly defamed. No man can know this thing except he be ^dmitted to know
the secrets of this School. The front and that which appears outwardly is
the cause why men detract the same, and speak so sini^terly of it. It is as it
were a valiant man clothed in an effeminate robe. As long as thou maintainest
modesty, Virtue is in security. Thou will say that thy body is not addicted
to any uncleanness, but thou hold as (some say) the Drum in thy hand, and
awakenest others to do evil. Make choice therefore of an honest title; and
let the inscription be such as may incite the mind to repel those vices which
weaken, as presently as they are entertained, whosoever approaches Virtue, he
gives hope of some generous thing. He that follows pleasure seems to be
weak, broken, effeminate, disposed to do wickedly. Except some man decipher
unto him what pleasures are, to the end he may know which of them are limited
within a natural desire: which are carried away headlong and are infinite,
and the more they are fulfilled the less are they satisfied. Well then let
Virtue lead the way, and our steps shall be assured. Ouer-great pleasure is
hurtful, in Virtue it is not to be feared that there should be any thing
excessive, for she her self only is the mean. That which is tired with his
own greatness (...) not good.

CHAP. XIIII.
How a man will agree pleasure with Virtue.
BUT to those that have a reasonable Nature, what better thing then reason may
be proposed? If this union be agreeable, and if a man will travel in such
company toward happy life, let Virtue go before and pleasure follow after,
as the shadow does the body. It is a small matter for a great mind to give
pleasure for a Handmaid to attend on Virtue, which is the most honourablest
Mistress that a man may meet with all. Let Virtue march before and carry the
Ensign, yet notwithstanding, we shall have pleasure, although we be Masters
and governors of the same. She will press us to grant her something, but
she cannot constrain us thereunto. But they that have given the superiority
to pleasure, have wanted both, For they loose Vertue^ Moreover they have not
pleasure; but pleasure is Lord over them, with whose want they are either
tormented, or else in abundance strangled. Wretched if they be forsaken by
her, and more wretched if they be ouerpressed. Like these who are entangled in
the Sy^tes: Now are they left on dry Land, presently hurred away with the
violence of the stream. But this falls out through too much intemperance, and
the blind love we bear unto the same. He that requires evil for good,
casts himself into great danger if he obtain the same. Even as we hunt
wild beasts with labor and hazard, and when we have caught them it is a hard
matter to keep them: for oftentimes they tear their Masters in pieces; so
fares it with those who have great pleasures, for they turn to their great
miseries; and surprise them when they imagine they have the mastrie over them.
Which the more and greater they be, so the less is he, and more subject and
slave unto many whom the common sort call happy. To continue and prosecute the
similitude which I have proposed: Even as he that searches the haunts of
wild beasts and accounts it a great matter to catch such dumb Creatures in
his nets, and enuiron some great Forest with a kennell of hounds, to the end
to follow their Tract, forsakes his better affairs, and renounceth many other
offices: so he that follows pleasure, neglects all other things,
respects not his former liberty, but depends on his belly, neither buyeth
he pleasures for himself; but sells himself to pleasures.

CHAP. XV.
BUT what (says h^) lets Virtue and vol^pt^ousnesse to be con^ounded in
one, Against those that will (...) Ve^tu^ with pleasure, (...) with (...)
together.
to the end that from them both the Sovereign good might be derived, so that
it might be one t^in^ to be honest^ and to be pleasant. Because ther^ cannot
be a part of honesty which is not honest, neither shall the chiefest good
have her sincerity, if she discover ought in her self that is unlike the
better. Neither is that joy which proceeds from Virtue, although it be good,
a part of the chiefest and absolute good. No more then mirth and tranquillity,
although they are derived from most excellent causes. For these are goods: yet
such as attend the Sou^raigne good, but perfect it no^. But whosoever will
associate Virtue, and pleasure, and not equal them; by the frailty of the one
he mortifieth all^that which is active in the other. Finally he inthralleth
that invincible liberty that knows nothing more precious then her self. For
he begins to have need of Fortune which is the greatest servitude of all
others. And he is attended by a doubtful, fearful, and susptious life,
fearful of casualties, and suspended upon the moments of time. Thou give
not Virtue a settled and immovable foundation, but commanndest her to stand in
a sl^pperie place. But what is so uncertain as the expectation of casualties,
and the variety of the body, and such things as affect the body? How can he
obey God, and entertain every thing that happens to him with a good mind, and
cease to complain of Fate, and be a faithful interpreter of his own
casualties, if he be shaken with the smallest assaults of pleasures or
sorrows? neither can he be a good tutor or defender of his Country, nor a
maintaner of his friends, if he be inclined to pleasures. Thither therefore
does the chiefest good ascend from whence she may not be drawn by any force.
Whereby there is neither entrance given to sorrow, hope, or fear, nor to any
other thing which may indamnifie or lessen the greatness of the chiefest good.
And only Virtue may ascend thereunto, by her steps this steepie rock must be
broken, she will stand stiffly, and whatsoever shall happen will endure it^ not
only patien^ but also willing, knowing that every difficulty of time is but
the Law of Nature. And as a good Soldier will endure wounds, number his
scarres^ and though thrust throw with many weapons, will dying love that
Captain for whose sake h^ breaths his last: so will Virtue have this Ancient
precept in mind, March after God. But whosoever complains, weepeth, and
mourns, is compelled to do that which he is commanded; and notwithstanding
is violently enforced to do that which is enjoined him? But what madness is
it rather to be drawn then to follow? As great in truth^ as if through
sortishnesse and ignorance of thy condition, thou should lament, because
some misfortune is befalne thee, or should be amazed and diffident, that
thou could not endure that^ which happens as well to the good as to the
euill^ that is to say sickness, death of parents and friends^ weakness, and
such other encumbrances of mortal life. Let us courageously endure all that
which the common condition of all things that are created submits us unto.
We are obliged unto this, to endure all the accidents of our life without
troubling our selves with those casualties, which we know how to avoid. We are
borne under a Royal domination. It is liberty to obey God.

CHAP. XVI.
He concludes, that a happy life consists in Virtue, and shew^th what
counsels this Virtue gives, and what good she brings.
TRue felicity therefore is placed in Virtue. What will she counsel thee to?
That thou think that neither good or evil that happens unto thee, neither by
Virtue nor by malice. Afterward that by the means of God thou remain
always ^irme and confident against euill^ and that as far^^ as breath in thy
power thou follow God. What then is that which is promised thee, if thou
behauest thy self after this manner? Great things and such as are answerable
to those that are divine. Thou shall be enforced in nothing^ Thou shall want
nothing, thou shall be free, assured and exempt from all dammage^ thou shall
undertake nothing in vain: thou shall do that which thou please without
trouble or disturbance. All things shall fall out as thou wishest: Adversity
shall not touch thee. What then? shall Virtue only which i^ thus perfect and
divine suffice to live happily? And why should it not suffice? I say this, it
is more then sufficient. For what can he want that is contented with every
thing and desires nothing whatsoever? he that has gathered all things that
are his into himself; has no need of any external thing. But he that tends
unto Virtue although he has gotten the greater part of his way, yet has he
need of some indulgence and favor of Fortune, who as yet is entangled amidst
the cares of this life, and has not as yet acquit himself of those bonds
which tie him captive to this World. What difference then is there, some are
tied, some are locked up, and some are fettered. But he that has gotten more
high, and is as it were lifted up from the Earth draws his chain, being as
yet not at full liberty, and reputed for a man that is wholly free.

CHAP. XVII.
Having so highly spoken of the sovereign good and of a happy life, He taxes
those that flatter vices.
IF therefore any one of these that bark at Philosophy allege that which they
are accustomed, why then speak thou better then thou live? whence comes
it that thou flatterest a man more greater then thy self? that thou esteemest
money to be a necessary aid, that thou art moved if thou loosest the same,
that thou we^pest if thou hear news of the death of thy wife or of thy
friend, that thou art glad if thou be praised and spoken well of in all
places, and that detractions torment thee? Why are thy Country grounds better
trimmed then the natural use requires? why kee^est thou no ordinary rule in
taking thy repast? what means thy house be^ter furnished then other men's?
What moves thee to drink Wine more older then thy selfe^ why is every thing
so well ordered in thy house? whence comes it that thou plantest trees, which
serve for no other use but for shade? whence is it that thy wife wears the
reuenew of a rich family hanging at her cares? And what is the cause that thy
Pages are so richly apparelled? why have thou an art in thy house to know how
to serve the table, and that thy plate is not set upon thy board rashly, and at
every man's pleasure, but is served in by courses, and that thou have a caruer
to cut up thy dainties? Add hereunto if thou wilt^ Why have thou goods beyond
S^as? And why art thou Master of so many goods that thou know not how to
number them? Art thou so dishonest and negligent that thou know not three or
four of thy servants? or so dissolu^^ that thou have them in so great number
that thy memory suffices not to contain^ their names? Hereafter I will assist
thee in speaking evil of me, and besides this will propose against my self,
more then thou thinkest^ For the present, behold what answer I will make thee. I
am not wise (and to satisfy thy displeasure the b^tter) I shall not be wise. I
require not therefore of my self to be equal with the ^est, but to be better
then the worst. It suffices me ^o cut of day by day some part of my vices, and
to check my imperfection^; my health neither is, nor shall be entire. I
prepare vngu^nts but no exact remedies for my pain of the gou^e, contenting my
self if it trouble me not often, and that it be loss furious and burning then
it is^ I^ I be compared with thee, for swiftness of pa^e I am but a weak
runner.

CHAP. XVIII.
I Speak not this for my self (for I am drown^d in vices) but for him that
already has gott^n ground. That this reproach is not new, That a wiseman in
condemning other men's vices begins with his own, and has a desire to mend
himselfe^ That we ought patie^tly to endure scoffs because the best men have
not escaped them.
Thou spe^kest, say thou in one kind but beleeuest in another. This has
been reproched by some lewd companions, enemies of all good men to Plato, to
the Epicure and to Zeno. For all these showed how we ought to live, and not
how they themselves lived, I speak of Virtue not of my self. When I blame
vices I first of all reprove mine own, and when I may possibly I will live as
I ough^. This malignitie infected with diverse poisons shall not drive me from
my laudable dessignes. This venom which you vomit out against others, and
where with you poison your selves shall not hinder me from praising that life,
according to which I know that I ought to govern my self, although I govern
not my self in that sort as I ought therein. Your malignitie (I tell you)
shall not restrain me from adorning that Virtue, which I follow not, although
it be estranged and far off from me^ Shall I expect that reproach, shall I in
any sort restrain her hands which neither respected Rutilius, nor forbear
Cato? Why should not any man in these men's opinion, ^ee over rich to whom
Demetrius the Cynicke seemed not poor enough? O exact person and adversary to
all the desires of Nature, so far as he forbad himself to demand those
things from the use whereof he had resolved to abstain. For he maintains
that the wiseman wants nothing. Markest thou this? he professed not the
science of Virtue but of poverty.

CHAP. XIX.
THey deny that Diodorus the Philosopher and the Epicure who not long since
hastened his own death, A paradox of the Stoickies, who praise those that
murder themselves. The iniquity of those men that accuse others and yet amend
not themselves.
by cutting his throat with his own hands, followed not in this act the
Doctrine of the Epicures. Some impute this unto fury, some unto ^olly, and
vain glory. He contrariwise content and ^urnished with a good conscience has
given testimony to himself in departing out of this life, and has prased the
repose of his days and arrived at the port, pronouncing that which you have
heard, in dispight of your teeth and that which you your selves also must say
when your turn comes. Long have I lived and fully h^^^ I ended,
That race of life that Fortune first commanded.
You dispute of an other man's life, of an other ma^s death, and bark like
little Dogs, against the names of great and laudable men, as if you met with
men that were unknown. For it is expedient for you, that no man should seem
good, because an other man's virtue should not reproach your iniquities. To your
great hearts grief you compare famous things with your absurdities, neither
perceive you that this boldness of yours wounds you wounderfully^ For if the
Scholars of Virtue ^ee covetous, voluptuous and ambitious, what name shall we
allot you, who have the very name of Vert^^? You obi^^^ that no man does that
which he t^^^heth and that he does other wise then he speaks. Is this to be
wondered at? Considering that they propose great and valorous things, which are
above all the tempests of the world, and strive to nail themselves to the
Cross, wherein every one of you has planted some nail: yea, before they are
at the place of punishment, they are content to be tied to any wood that they
meet withal. They that do not chastise and reproou^ themselves by
themselves, are so many times tied unto the Gibbet, as there are passions that
draw them hither and thither, and are so ready to outrage an other; I would
believe them, were their not some of them that from the gallows cursed and
spit on those that beheld them.

CHAP. XX.
That a man has purchased much that he h^th gotten himsel^e good thoughts,
altho^h the ef^ects follow not always.
THe Philosophers perform not what they speak, yet perform they very much,
because they speak that which they have conceived with an honest mind. For if
their words and deeds were one, what were more blessed then they? In the mean
space, thou have no cause to despise good words, neither those hearts that are
full of good thoughts. You ought to praise the fair and honest occupations of
the mind, and the study of good Sciences, although there follow no effect
thereupon. What wonder is it if they that have attempted high matters, attain
not to honor? Reverence thou the hardy and difficult enterprises of Virtue,
admire the men, although attempting great matters, they fail of their purpose.
It is a generous thing, for a man that considers not his own, but natures
forces; to attempt and undertake high matters, and to con^^iue that in his
thought which the most ablest men in the world cannot effect; who has purposed
and said this unto himself; I will keep the same countenance in beholding
death, as I kept when I heard that she approached me. How great weight so
ever shall be imposed on me, I will yield my shoulder, and my mind shall
sustain my body. I will make as small reckoning of those goods that I have, as
of those that I have not, if they lie on the ground in another man's house, it
shall not trouble me^ neither if they shine about me will I be proud. I will
neither respect the pr^sent prosperity or future adversity; I will look upon
every man's land as if it were mi^^ own, and on mine as if it were all men's; I
will so live, as if I knew that I was borne for others, and for that will I
give thanks to nature that has appropriated me to that use. What could she
do more for me? She has given me only unto all men, and all men unto me
alone, what so ever I have, I will neither keep it too niggardly, not spend it
too prodigally. I will believe that I possess nothing more, then that which is
well given me. I will not esteem any benefits by the number or weight, nor
estemate them any other ways, but in respect of him that receives them. That
shall never seem too much to me, which a worthy man receives at my hands; I
will do all things, not for opinion but for conscience sake. I will believe it
is done in the sight of all men, whatsoever I do unwittingly. The end of my
eating and drinking shall be to satisfy the desires of nature, not to fill and
empty my belly. I will be pleasing to my friends, gentle and facile to mine
enemies. I will grant before I be ^^ked, and will prevent all honest demandes.
I will remember that the World is my Countrie^ that the gods who govern the
World are above me, and stand about me as censors of my deeds and words. And
as often as nature shall redemaund my Soul, or reason dismiss it I will
depart this life with this testimony, that I have loved and labored to have a
good conscience, and to be exercised in laudable actions; that no man's
liberty has been diminished by me, nor mine by any man.

CHAP. XXI.
Whosoever resolves with himself to do this, That good thoughts are the
beginnings, and the high ways to good works.
he will assay he will walk toward the gods, and aspire unto great things,
although he always attain them not. But you that hate Virtue and such as are
virtuous do nothing new. For sick eyes are afraid of the Sun, and those
creatures which see not clearly but by night, are astonished as soon as the
bright some day appears, and retire themselves to their lurking holes; In
bri^fe, those creatures that fear the light, lock them up in their retreates.
Grieve and spend your wretched tongs in detracting good men; bark and bite at
them, sooner shall you break your teeth then lay hold or hurt them. But why
lives such a one, who says he is a friend of Wisdom so deliciously?
Wherefore says he should a man despise riches and yet he has them? He does
naught else but speak against the love of this life, and yet he lives. Why
commends he sickness, and yet so diligently maintains and longs for
health? Banishment with him is but a word of no use, and he says that the
change of a man's Country is no evil thing: Notwithstanding, if he may make
choice, he ends his days in the place where he was borne. He judges that
there is little difference betwixt a short and long life, yet if nothing let
him he extends his age, and flourishes in quietness for many years. He
says that these things should be contemned, not in regard of the propriety
and possession, but in respect we should not have them with labor, he will
not drive them from him, but will follow them securely when they flit away. In
what storehouse may Fortune better lock her riches then there, from whence
she may fetch them, without complaint of him that keeps them. Marcus Cato
when he praised Curious and Corancatus and that Age, wherein it was an offense
worthy of censure, to have some few plates of Silver, was himself master of a
million of Gold, far less in respect of the treasure which Crassus had, yet
far more then Cato the Censor was Lord of. By far more had he surpassed his
great Grandfather, had they been compared together, then he was surpassed by
Crassus; And if greater fortunes had befallen him, he had not refused them. For
a wiseman thinks himself worthy of all those presents of fortune. He loves
not riches, and yet he prefers them before poverty, he receives them into
his house but not in his mind, neither treads them under foot in possessing
them, but contains them, and will have an excellent subject to exercise his
virtue upon.

CHAP. XXII.
Why a virtuous and good man despises not riche^, and to what use they serve
him.
But who doubts, but that a wise man has a greater means to express the
worthiness of his mind, when he has riches, then when he has poverty, when
as in poverty there is but one virtue not to be dejected, not to be depressed.
In riches a man may say that temperance, libertie^ diligence, disposition, and
magnificence, have a spacious field to show themselves in. In this place there
is a noble discou^se of the use of riches.
A wise man will not contemn himself, although he be of a low statu^e, yet
could he wish that he were higher. Though he be slender in body, and have lost
an eye, yet will he be content, yet had he rather that his body were strong
enough. He will love it so, when he shall know that there is some thing in him
more strong and more vigorous; he shall endure sickness and wish for health.
For some things although they be small in appearance, and such as may be taken
from us, without the ruin of the principal good, yet add they something to
perpetual joy which springs from virtue. So do riches affect and comfort
him, as a fair and merry wind does a Sailer, as a fair day, or as a covert
in cold weather and rain. But who is he say I, amongst our wise men, who
account virtue for the only good, that denies likewise that these which we
call indifferent, have some worth in them, and that some are to be preferred
before others. To some of these some honor is given, to some great. Do not
therefore deceive thy self, riches are amongst those things that are to be
desired. Why then say thou, do thou mock me, when as they are as highly
esteemed by thee as they are by me? Will thou know how differently they are
affected? If riches slip out of my ^ands, they shall carry nothing away with
them but themselves; Thou will be astonished, and seem unto thy self to be
left without thy self, if they depart from thee. Riches with me are in some
request, with thee in high esteem. In brief, my riches serve me, Thou art a
slave to thine.

CHAP. XXIII.
That riches a^ honest, both in regard of the getting of them, as in respect of
the possession and use of them.
Give over therefore to forbid Philosophers to have money. No man has condemned
Wisdom to perpetual poverty. A wise man may have great wealth, but taken
from no man, nor bought with the effusion of other men's blood, gotten without
any man's prejudice, without unlawful gain, whose departure shall be as honest
as their entry, whereat no man shall grieve except he be enuio^s. Urge against
them as much as thou please, they are honest; in which, where as there are
many things which every man would have called his, yet is their nothing that
any man may say it is his. But the wise man will not estrange the bounty of
Fortune from him self, neither will he glory or be^ ashamed of that
patrimony that he has gotten with honesty; yet shall he have wherein to
glory, if his doors being open, and the City admitted to enter to examine
his substance, he might say; Let every man take that hence which he knows to
be his! O great man, happily rich, if his actions be answerable to these
speeches of his, if after this speech he have so much; this I say, if sa^e and
secure he has submitted himself to the Cities search, if no man has found
ought in his house, that an other man may challenge, boldly and openly, he
shall be rich. Even as a wise man admits no money into his house that is
badly got, so will he not refuse nor exclude great riches, which are the gifts
of fortune and the fruits of virtue. For what cause is there, why he should
envy them a good place? Let them come and dwell with him; he will neither boast
of them, nor hide them, the one is the sign of an insolent mind, the other of
a fearful and weak mind; as if containing a great good within his bosom.
Neither as I said, will he cast them out of his house. For what will he say?
Whether this, you are unprofitable; or this, I know not how to use riches? Even
as although he can walk his journey on foot, yet he had rather get up into
his Coach, so if he may be rich he will, and he will entertain riches yet as
slight and transitory things, neither will he suffer them to be burden some
to any other, nor to himself. He will give then, what hearken you now? Why
open you your bosoms? he will give, but either to good men, or to those whom
he may make good. He will give, but with great deliberation, making choice of
the worthiest as remembering himself, that he is to give an account both of
his expenses and receipts. He will give upon a just and reasonable cause, for
to give ^uilly, is a shameful loss. He will have his bosom open, but not
rent, out of which much money shall pass, but nothing shall be lost.

CHAP. XXIIII.
HE deceives himself, Of the vs^ of Goods in regard of the diverse relief of
our neighbors, and how we ought to give.
whosoever thinks that it is an easy matter to give; This thing has great
difficulty in it, if so be it be given with judgment, not scattered by
adventure or rashly. I gain the heart of such a man, I restore unto an other,
I succor this man, I take pity on that man; I furnish such a one, because
he deserves to be warranted from poverty, and to be no more busi^d in
seeking his fortune. To some I will not give although he want; because,
although I should give yet will he still be needy. To some will I offer, and
other some will I press to take, I cannot be negligent in this thing, I never
oblige so many unto my profit as when I give. What say thou, do thou give
to receive again? Yea, to the end I may not loose; yet must the gift that is
given be in such hands whence it may not be redemaunded, it may be restored.
Let a benefit be bestowed like a treasure that is deeply hidden, which thou will not dig up, except thou have need of it. What? has not a rich man's
house abundant matter to do good? For who would tie liberality only to
Citizens and men of account? Nature commands us to do good unto men, whether
they be slaves or freemen, whether they be naturally bred, or by manumission
freed of in just liberty or given amongst friends. What is that to the matter?
Wheresoever a man is, there is a place of benefit. The wise man likewise may
spread his money in his own house, and exercise liberality, which is not so
called, because it is given to freemen, but because it proceeds from a free
mind. This liberality of a wise man, is never employed upon filthy and
unworthy persons, neither is it ever so wearied^ but that as often as he
finds out a worthy receiver, it flows abundantly, you are not therefore to
give a sinister interpretation, to those things that are spoken honestly,
manfully, and stoutly, by those that are lovers of Wisdom. But consider this
first of all^ that there is a difference betwixt him that is studious of
wisdom, and him that is wise and has gotten wisdom. He that has wisdom will
say unto thee, I speak justly, yet am I entangled with many vices. You are not
to require of me a life that is every way correspondent to my words, whereas I
endeavor as much as I may to make and form my self, and address my self
according to an excellent pattern. If I proceed as well a^ I have intended,
require this of me, that my deeds may be answerable to my words. But he that
has attained the fullness of wisdom, will deal otherwise with thee, and will
say. First of all thou art not to permit thy self to give sentence of thy
be^ters; for now already (which is the argument that I am in the right way) I
have gotten thus far as to displease evil men. But to let thee know, that I
envy no mortal man, hear what I promise thee, and how much I estimate every
thing. I deny that riches are good, for if they were, they should make good
men: but now since that which is found amongst evil men, cannot be called
good, I deny them this name, yet confess I that they are to be had, that they
are profitable, and bring great commodities.

CHAP. XXV.
Although a wise man possesses ^iches, he accou^teth them not for true goods,
and why he had rather have them, then have them not.
Hear therefore what the cause is, why I number them not amongst goods, and
what thing I consider in them, more then you, since it is agreed between us
both that they are to be had. Put me into a rich house; put me there where I
shall be ordinarily served in silver and gold; I will not be proud for all
this, which, although I have by me, yet are they without me. Transfer me to
a wooden bridge, and drive me amongst the beggars, I will not therefore
despise my self, because I sit amongst them, who thrust out their ^and to have
an alms given them; for what is this to the matter, whether a crust of bread
be wanting to him, who wants not the power to die? what then is it? I had
rather have that fair house then a bridge. Lodge me in a rich bed with
delicate hangings, and goodly furniture, I will not suppose my self more
happy, because I have soft and silken covering upon me, and because purple
carpets are spread for my guests to sit upon. I shall be no whit more
miserable, if my weary head rest it self upon a lock of hay, or if I lie
upon a Circensian and broken pad, whence the straw breaks forth, through the
rotten and ragged linen. What therefore is it? I had rather show what my
manner were in cleanly and decent apparel, then with half covered or naked
shoulders. Though all the days of my life should be pleasant, and that one
honor should draw on others that are new, I would not be a whit prouder for
all this. Change to the contrary this indulgence of time; let my mind be
wounded every ways with losses, sorrows, and diverse incursions: Let not an
hour slip without some complaint, yet will I not say, that I am wretched
amongst the wretchedest; I will not therefore curse my day, for I have already
resolved with my self, that no day should seem fatal unto me. What therefore
is it? I had rather temperate my joys, then still my sorrows. This will
Socrates say unto thee: Make me the conqueror of all nations; let that
delicate and triumphant Chariot of Bacchus carry me as far as Thebes from the
sunne-rise; Let the Persian Kings require laws at my hands, then will I think
my self most of all to be a man when all the world shall salute me for a God.
Join to this sudden greatness, a contrary change; Let them cast me upon a
hurdle, to be led in show in the triumph of some proud and insolent enemy by
reason of his victory, I will march with such a countenance behind his Chariot,
as I did when I was mounted in mine. What therefore is it? I had rather
overcome then be taken. I will despise the whole Kingdom of Fortune, out of
that if I may take my choice, I will choose the best and most pleasing. What so
ever befalls me, I will repute it good, but I desire they should be easy and
pleasant, and such as should least trouble me in the handling of them. For,
thou must not think that there is any virtue without labor, but some virtues
need spurs, other some raines: Even as the body that ascends a hie place
ought to be kept back, and he that ascends upon should bear forward: so
some virtues are as it were descending, some that are troublesome to mount. Is
it to be doubted, but that patience, valor, and perseverance, and other
virtues opposed to afflictions, and tread fortune under foot, are such virtues
as mount and advance themselves with travel, and outstrip many difficulties?
What therefore? Is it not as apparent, that liberty, temperance and clemency
march downwards? In these we contain our mind, lest it slip. In these we
encourage and incite: So then when there shall be question of poverty, we
will arm our selves with the strongest, best disposed, and such as know best
how to fight: in the use of riches, we will call the other which will march
leasurely, and sustain the weight.

CHAP. XXVI.
THis being thus distinguished, I had rather have the use of those virtues,
What difference there is betwixt a fool and a wise man, When as both would be
rich.
the exercise whereof is peaceable, then to assay those other that make a man
sweat blood and water. I therefore says the Wiseman, live not otherwise then I
speak, but you hear otherwise then you should: only the sound of words is
come to your ears, but what they signify you enquire not, what difference
then is there betwixt me a fool, and thee a wise man, if both of us will have
wealth? Great: for riches are to the wise man as his slaves, to the fool as
his commanders. The wise man gives not any authority to riches, but they
master you wholly: you, as though some one had promised you an eternal
possession of them, accustom your selves to them, and cleave unto them. The
wiseman does then most of all meditate upon poverty, when as he is in the
midst of his poverty. Never does an Emperor so trust to peace, that he
prepares not for war, which he reputeth to be already proclaimed, although
as yet they are not come to handy strokes. A fair house, as though it could
never burn nor fall down, makes you insolent. Riches do amase you, as if
they were out of all danger, and were greater then that fortune had power
enough to consume them. Idleing you envy your riches, neither foresee you the
danger of them. Wherein you behave your selves like Barbarians besieged in a
place, who set their arms a cross, beholding those that besiege them
traveling after certain engines, and know not what they be, neither
understand whereto men will make use of these engines of battery, which are
addressed far off from the Wall. The same befalls you, you rot in your
goods, neither think you what casualties hang over your heads every ways, and
that suddenly shall pluck from you the fairest and the richest spoils.
Whosoever shall take away a wise man's riches, shall leave him that which is his,
for he lives being contented with those things that were present, and secure
of the future. I have never so much persuaded my self says Socrates, or any
other that has the same right and power over humane affairs, as to apply my
manner of living to your opinions. Use your accustomed habit every way. I will
not think them to be the injuries of men, but the cries of little children.
Thus will he speak that has gotten and attained wisdom, whose mind being
freede from all vice, will loath him to reprehend others, not because he
hates them, but because he would amend them. To these will he add: Your
reputation moves me, not in mine own respect, but for your cause: When I see
you hate and harrow virtue, it is a forswearing of good hope. You do me no
more injury, then they do the Gods, who ouerturn their altars; but your evil
intent, and evil counsel appears even there where it could not hurt. Thus
bear I with your impertinencies even as almighty Jupiter does the follies of
the Poets; Whereof one of them gives him wings, an other horns, an other
brought him forth as an adulterer; an other, as a night-watcher; an other, as
cruel toward the Gods; an other, as unjust toward men; an other, as a
rauisher, and corrupter of children of free condition and of good parentage; an
other, for a parracide, and such a one as has invaded other men's dominions,
yea, the kingdom of his own father: all which was to no other end, but to
take from men (who believed that the Gods were such) all shame of doing evil.
But although these things hurt me nothing, yet do I warn you for your own
sakes, and counsel you to embrace virtue. Believe those that having long time
followed her, cry out that they follow some great thing, and that one day or
other, will show it self more excellent, and honor her as the Gods, and
reverence those that serve her, as you would do the professors and priests of
the Gods: and as often as there is any mention made of the sacred letters,
keep your silence: for this word is not derived from favor, Fauete linguis
non ^ fauore.
as diverse men suppose, but silence is commanded, that the sacrifice might be
duly performed without any interruption.

CHAP. XXVII.
By reason of silence whereof he entreats, he shows by an ^xpr^sse
c^mparison, that th^re are not any people in the world more carefully to be
listened unto then wisem^n, and they that are v^^tuous, and thereu^on he
in^roduceth Socrates as the most exc^ll^nt who magni^ieth virtue, and shows
that happy life consis^eth in the same.
WHich so much the rather ought to be enjoined you, that as often as any thing
is uttered by that Oracle, with an intent and humble voice, you may hear the
same. When some Apostatate Priest makes a man believe, that the sister of
Apollo has sounded, when any one well learned to carue the flesh from his
muskles, wounds himself both in arms and shoulders with a sparing hand,
when some woman creeping upon her knees along the ways howleth, and an old man
apparrelled in linen, carrying in his hands a lantern and a candle at midday,
cries out that some one of the Gods are displeased; you flock about him, and
listen, and entertaining one another mutual amase; you affirm, that he is
some Prophet. Behold Socrates cries out from that prison, into which when he
entered it, be cleansed it, and made it more honest then any Court of plea. What
madness is this? What nature is this so opposite against Gods and men? to
defame virtues, and to violate holy things with malignant speeches? If you can,
praise good men, if not pass by them. But if you take pleasure to exercise
this unbridled liberty, assail one another: for when you are mad against
heaven (I say not that you commit sacrilege) but you loose your labors.
Sometimes I ministered matter to Aristophanes to break his jests upon me, and
all that band of comicke Poets powered out their enuenomed scoffs against me:
my virtue grew more famous by these very means, whereby they assailed her; for
it behooves her to be produced and attempted; neither do any men more
understand what she is, then they, who by provoking her, have tired her forces.
The hardness of the flint stone is known to no men more then to those who
strike upon it: I present my self unto you in such sort, as a rock in midst
of a tempestuous sea, the which is on every side, and incessantly beaten with
the waves and yet notwithstanding continues in his place, and neither by length
of time, nor by the assaults of the same, is any ways consumed. Enforce your
selves against me, and leave me at your pleasure, I will overcome you with
patience, whatsoever he be that attempteth those things that are firm and
impregnable, imployeth his forces to the ruin of himself. And therefore seek
out some more soft and yielding matter, wherein you may fix your weapons. But
have you so much leisure as to examine other men's faults, and to give your
censures of any man: Why this Philosopher has so fair a house? why the other
suppeth more daintily? you observe pustules and little spots in other men,
being your selves besieged with ulcers. It is as much as if you should carpe at
some men's freckles and warts which should appear in their fairest bodies, and
you your selves were ouergrowne with a loathsome scab. Object against Plato,
that he desired money; against Aristotle, that he received the same; against
Democritus, that he neglected it; against the Epicure, that he spent it; object
against me Alcibiades and Phaedrus. O how happy should you be, when you could
but counterfeit our vices? but why rather examine you not your own vices which
wound you on every side; the one assayling you outwardly, the other burning in
your bowels. The affairs of the world are not brought to that pass, although
you are wholly ignorant of your estates, that you may have so much leisure as
to employ the rest of your time, and your tongues in detraction of good men.

CHAP. XXVIII.
THis understand you not, The continuation of a wise ma^s discourse in the
person of Socrates.
and you carry an other countenance then becomes your fortune, even as many
men do, who sitting in the Circus or Theater, and some one dead in their
houses, and are wholly ignorant of that which has happened. But I beholding
from a hie place, see what tempests either hang over your heads, that will
somewhat later break from out their cloud, to such as are near at hand, that
shall ravish both you and yours away, as soon as they shall meet you. And
why? see you not already likewise, although you have little sense thereof, a
certain tempest that transporteth your minds, and hurleth you up, flying and
pursuing the same things, and rauisheth you now lifted up on high, now
battereth you against the ground.

The end of the Discourse touching a blessed life.
THE TRANQVILITIE AND PEACE OF THE MIND. WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, AND
DEDICATED TO SERENVS.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
AND this Book is to be numbered amongst those that are profitable and
worthy both for their matter and handling. It was written in the beginning of
his return from his banishment when he was admitted to the Court and preferred
to be NEROES Schoolmaster. This appears by these words, in his first
Chapter. This dissolution abashed me, and this abundance of delight spreading
it self, and sounding round about me, ravished me, coming from a place where
I had long time settled my self to live in obscurity. He touches and taxes
the dissolution of the Court, which before times was unknown and hateful unto
him. The order in the handling hereof is confused, yea scarcely is there any,
and an over sight or defect unless I be deceived, appears in many things.
But this is the sum hereof. The occasion of his writing, he draws from his
inconstancy and irresolution, his mind being neither settled or quiet in any
sort. This says he is their custom who are in the way to wisdom but have
not as yet attained the same, nor tasted the fruit thereof, which is
tranquillity. O great good, and what is it? he describes the same. How shall I
attain thereunto? by flying inconstancy, what then is she? her he punctually
describes she is driven away by diverse remedies first by occupation and that
either public, if the times or thy understanding admit it, or private to the
end, thou may converse amongst the best studies and meditations. Yet must
not we suddenly fly from the Commonweal, that there are many parts thereof,
and that we have liberty to embrace any one of them. This until the fourth
Chapter. Then added he if we intend business, three things are to be
considered our selves, the business, or men for whose cause, or with whom we
act. In our selves our forces are to be examined, what and how far they may
neither let us attempt further. In our affairs? what are we able to overcome
them, whether likewise there be a chain of them and whether they lead us
farther that our returns ought to be always free. In men: whether they be
worthy of our labor or expense of time. But they are not vain, ambitious,
neither occupied in any serious matter. Afterward in the seventh Chapter, he
adds but scarce to the purpose. That an especial and perfect friend is an
entert^inment of tranq^iliti^^ and delight, but such a one as is not of an
e^ill disposition, and such ^s ^cc^seth all things^ Again, there is (...)
perfect text, and in the eight Chapter of the means of Patrimony, that it be
^ot great nor small to nourish Tranquillity, but mean and (...), and that may
be m^int^ined by Parsimonie. But excess is to be avoided, yea in the very
instruments of life, as in o^r Liberaries or Books. After this he over
slippeth in the tenth Chapter, and proves that tro^bles befall in every
estate of lif^, but that ^hey ^re m^llif^^d by custom, by b^holding another
man's Fortune, which of times is the worst. Likewis^ that desires ^^e not to be
banished far from us, but best near unto ^s, and eas^^ t^ be l^id hold on.
And thus instruct^th ^ee a proficient and young Scholar, for (...) ^eed to
fight, for he overcomes all Fortune, which he ^ore-thinketh to ^e this or
that, and by foresight thereof m^llifieth and breaks it. This ^^till the
twelfth Chapter. After that another Tract that we are not to tra^ell in
vnnecess^rie m^tters, neither as much as in us lies, in foreign. He urges
DEMO^^^TVS heavenly precept. That many things are not done, either privately or
publicly Presently^ after (...) the fourteenth Chapter, he drives us from
Leuitie and Pertinacie. That is neither busily to change in life, neither if
thou have chosen evil, obstinatly to clean unto that, but to behold all things
with an equal and almost a pleasing countenance. For what is life, b^t ^ jest?
L^stly in the sixteenth Chapter that simulation is to be fled, and too
careful composition of ^ man's self. Let simplicity be entertained and
sometimes mirth, yea and sometimes banquet and freer drinking. This drowneth
cares, and freeth and extolleth the mind. In the end he concludes, that he
has set down what they are that may maintain tranquillity, and may restore
it, by which you may see what the partition was, but truly it is not existant
at this present. Therefore as many things of SENECAES, are the words to be
praised in part, the order of the whole is defective, and that either by the
injuries of time or at least wise by the negligence of transcriptors.

CHAP. I.
DEbating with my self Serenu^, Seneca introduces Serenus or some other in
his beginning^ to whom he discouer^th the infirmity, of his mind, and
demands remedy at his hana's to settle them.
and examining my present life, there were some vices of mine that appeared
openly^ and subject to every eye, and such as I might touch with the hand, some
more obscure and closely hidden, some other that were not continual, but such
as returned at certain times and spaces; and these of all the rest were most
troublesome, because (if I may so speak it) they resembled such enemies, as
charge and assault at vnaw^res, which keep me either from being always ready,
as in time of war; or to live in security, as I ought to do, in time of
peace: yet principally observe I this habitude in my self, (for why should I
not disclose the truth, since thou art my Physician?) that neither I am truly
and entirely delivered from these which I feared and hated, neither again
subject unto them. I am in your estate, that is not altogether so evil; yet
do I nothing but complain my self, neither find I any thing that may
content me^ I am not sick, and yet I am not well. Thou must not here tell me,
that all the beginnings of virtues are feeble, and that in time their
continuance and strength is increased: I know well that these things which are
of consequence, as honor and reputation, to be eloquent, and all that
whereupon our neighbors ground their judgment, are fortified by time, and
those that require some provision of true force, and they that are farded to
please the eyes, respect some years, until such time as by little and little
they get some time that may give them tincture. But I fear lest custom which
brings constancy to things, fix this imperfection more deeply in me. A long
conversation either with good or evil men induces love. But I cannot show
thee so well at once, as in part, what this infirmity of the mind is, which is
houered now this way, now that way, without staying it self resolutely on that
which is good, and without declining also unto the evil. I will tell thee what
befalls me, give my infirmity afterward what name thou please. Great is
my love to parsimony, I confess it, I like not a bed ambitiously furnished, I
like not a garment newly drawn from the coffer, nor brought from the press
where to make it shine; it has endured a thousand weights and torments; but a
homely, rai^ent, proper for the time, that has not been horded up, nor is to
be worn with too much care; that meat pleases me that few men may dress,
and less pages attend, that's readily prepared, and that passes through a few
men's hands, that is ^asily gotten, and easily dressed, that is neither scanty nor
dear, that may be found in all places, that neither spends the patrimony,
nor hurts the body, nor is like to be returned by the way it entered. I like
a homely and a homebred servant, old and rusticke, plain, such as my father
used, without these new fashions, and the workmans mark, a table not checkered
nor renowned amongst the people^ because that diverse men had been masters of
it, who loved to make good cheer, but fit for my use, which for the beauty
thereof shall not bewitch the eyes of my guests with pleasure, nor inkindle
them with envy. After I had taken pleasure to see these things above said, a
great troop of young Pages nourished apart, more diligently and costly
apparrelled then they should be in a private house; and vassels and slaves
garnished with gold, and a troop of servants that shined (so neatelie they
were attired) suddenly dazeled mine eyes. Furthermore, a house wherein
nothing was trod upon but that which was prec^ous, where riches were scattered
in every corner of the house, where the roofes shined with gold, and where the
flattering people haunted which follow and attend those patrimonies that fall
to ruin. Why should I reckon up the waters so clear that a man might see the
bottom, which incessantly run about those places where the feasts are
solemnized? What shall I speak of the banquet, answerable to the rest of the
magnificence? the things amazed me, and this delicious abundance coming to
spread it self, and to ^ound about me, who came from a place where I have
lived a long time, settled in a solitary life, ravished me wholly, my sight is
dulled somewhat, I more easily lift up my mind then mine eyes against such
pomp, I depart therefore not worse but discontent; neither walk I so joyful
and merry amidst my brittle household stuff, and a silent disgust and doubt
assaileth me, whether that train were not better then mine, none of these
change me, yet every one of them shake me. Sometimes I am ready to follow that
which my Masters have commanded me, and to thrust my self into the affairs
of estate. I am content to accept of honors and maiestracy, not persuaded to
undertake the same, either for purple ornaments or golden rods, but that
being thus advanced I might be more propper and better disposed to do pleasures
to my friends, my kinsfolk, my Citizens, yea, and all mortal men^ I follow
Zeno, Cleanthes, Crysippus, no one of all which intermedled with the
commonweal, though every one of them counseled others thereunto. But when I
had induced my mind thereunto, which is not accustomed to such debates. If any
unworthy matter present it self (as in all humane life there are too many) or
if it go not forward easily, or that things slight and frivolous require much
time to be employed in them; I return back again to my solitude, and do as
beasts that are tired and wearied, that run more swiftly then they have done
all the day before when they draw near unto their Stable: then is my mind
conceited to contain it self within mine own walls. Let no man hence
forward take one day from me, which cannot restore me a sufficient recompense
for so great a loss, let my mind cleave unto himself, let him seem himself:
let him not intend no foreign bu^inesses, nor any thing that is subject to
every man's censure, let Tranquillity be loved which is void of private and
public cares. But when as reading has roused and lifted up my mind to more
confidence, and noble examples have pricked me forward^ I take a pleasure to
haunt the judgment court, to lend one man my voice, another man my labor,
which although it profit him not, yet was it aimed for his profit, to restrain
another man's pride in the judgment court, too badly puffed up by his too great
fortunes. In studies me thinks undoubtedly that it is better to contemplate
the things themselves and to discourse upon them, and to fit them with
convenient words, so as without search they may be subject to the thing that
is in question. What need we to compose works that shall continue for many
ages. Will thou beat thy brain to the end that men may speak of thee when
thou art out of the world! Thou art borne to dye, the secret funeral has the
least troubles. If therefore thou will wright any thing to pass the time
withal, write it in a simple style for thine own use, not to affect praise.
They that study for a day need no great labor. Again, when my soul is
lifted up with the greatness of thoughts, she is ambitio^s in coying words,
and as her conceptions are great, so endeavors she to be eloquent; and
according to the dignity of the subject is the carriage of the style. Then
forgetting this law, and this restrained judgment, I am carried alo^t, and
speak now by another man's mouth. And not to prosecute the rest more at large,
in all things this infirmity of a good mind alters me, and I am afraid least
it should escape me by little and little, or (which is yet more tedious) that
I am not always in suspense and doubt as he that fears to fall, and has as
yet no more evil then I could foresee. For we judge of our private affairs
and behold them familiarly, and fauo^r is always a hinderance unto judgment.
I think that many men might have attained wisdom except they had thought
that they had attained the same; except they had dissembled something in
themselves, and ouerpassed some things with open eyes. For thou must not thin^e
that other men's flattery makes us so evil as our own does. What man is he
that dare speak truth unto himself? Who is he that being placed amidst the
troops of his commenders and flatterers, that flattereth not himself more
then all the rest? I pray thee therefore if thou have any remedy to stay this
debate of my soul, that thou will honor me with this good, that I may say
that thou art he that have set me at quiet. I know well that the motions of my
soul are not dangerous, provided that they be not over violent. To express
unto thee in an apt similitude the matter whereof I complain, I am not
tormented with the storm but I have a provocation to vomit. Take from me then
this pain whatsoever it be, and help him that is sick in the sight of the
land.

CHAP. II.
He shows first o^ all the difference that is betwixt those that ^eele
troubles of their mind^, and others that have no appr^hension thereof, or that
take pleasure to be in trouble. Then declares he how the first sh^^ld be
handled.
Truly my Serenus I have long ago sought for such a one without speaking a word
of it, that had such and the like thought in his mind. There is nothing that
admonishes me more nearly then their example, who being delivered from a long
and grievous sickness feel as yet by times some shiuering and slight motions,
and when as they have been freed from the relics of their infirmity, yet
are they disquieted by some suspicions of a relaps, and being al^eady whole
offer their hand to the Physician to feel their pulse, and suspect every heat
and motion of their bodies. Such men's bodies Serenus are healthful enough, yet
are they not as yet well accustomed thereto, but have a certain trembling
agitation, resembling that of the calm sea or some l^ke when a tempest is
ceased on it. They have therefore need not of those harder remedies which we
likewise ouer-passe, as in some place to oppose thy self against thy passions,
in some place to be displeased, in some other place to be more grievously
angry: but we have most need of that which comes last, that thou trust thy
self, and belieuest that thou art in a good way, being no ways distracted by
the by-walkes of many men wandering here and there, and of some that err about
the way. But that which thou desire which is not to be shaken, is a great
and perfect thing, and approaches the felicity of God. This stable seat of
the mind the Grecians call (...) whereof Democritus has written an excellent
volume. I call it Tranquillity, nether is it necessary to imitate or to mould
new words according to their form. It suffices that the thing which is in
question has a name which expresses the force of the Greek word without
representing the letters. So then we demand how the spirit may remain always
like unto himself, march with an equal train, be favorable to himself, and
behold hi^ attempts with a good eye, to be joyful and content, neither raising
nor depressing himself overmuch. This is called Tranquillity, but let us
enquire in general how we may attain hereunto: thou shall take as much of
the p^blique remedy as thou will; mean while I will discover the whole vice
whereby every man may know his part, and thou likewise may understand how
less^ trouble tho^ have with the loathing of thy self, then they who tying
themselves to a fair show, and laboring under a great title would willingly
discover themselves, but I know not what shame entertaineth them. All are in
the same cause, both they which are vexed with leuity and anxiety, and a
continual change of their p^rpose, who are always better pleased with that
which they have left, and thos^ that watch and gape after vain hopes. Add
unto those men likewise who are not tra^sported in their life by the means of
inconstancy but through their sloth. They live not as they would but as they
began, moreover there are innumerable other properties, but only one effect
of the vice which is to displease themselves. This springs from the
intemperature of the mind and from fearful and scarce prosperous desires,
whereas they dare not as much as they desire, or attain not the same, and are
wholly bent upon hope always instable and mutable, which must needs befall
those that live in suspen^^. Their whole life is in expectation, and they teach
and enforce themselves to dishonest and difficult things, and whereas their
labor is in vain they are vexed with their fruitless disgrace: neither are
they sorry because they have done evil, but that they willed the same in
vain. Then repent they themselves that they had begun and fear to begin it
again, and afterward they are surprised with a confusion of the mind which
cannot find issue, because they neither can command nor obey their desirres,
so that they lead a life which cannot be exempt from confusion, and have their
minds tied and languishing amidst fruitless vows and desires: and all these
are more grievous unto them, when as in despite of that misfortune that
trauaileth them, they would have recourse unto repose, and to secret s^udies
which the mind cannot endure, that is fixed on the affairs of the world,
desirous to be in action, by nature vnqui^t, and having little solace in
himself. And therefore their delights being drawn from them, which their
occupations minis^red unto them, b^ing busied in certainty therein, the mind
endures neither house nor solitud^, the walls are displeasant to him, and
being thus abandoned by himself, he unwillingly beholds himself. From
thence proceeds this tediousness^, this contempt of himself, this perpetual
agitation of the mind, this sad and feeble patience in repose, especially when
he is ashamed to confess the cause, when shame tormenteth him inwardly, when
covetous desires close up his heart, when none of these finding issue strangle
one anther. Thence comes that sadness and consumption, and a thousand floods
and assaults of the uncertain mind, held in suspense by the enterprises he
has begun, abated by the remembrance of the remediless estate of his
present affairs. Th^nce grows that thought which makes them detest the
repose they enjoy, complain themselves that they have nothing to do^, and to
bear endless hatred and envy at other men's prosperity; For unhappy
idleness is the nurse of envy, and all of them desire to be dead because they
could not outstrippe others. This envy concieued against other men's fortunes,
and his own disgraces causes the mind to fret and murmr against fortune, to
accuse the malice of the time, to retire himself into some corner apart, and
to stoop under his torment in fretting and consuming himself. For man's mind
is swift and ready to be moved, and rejoices very much when any occasion is
offered to exercise himself. But above all others this pleases those men that
are malignant, whose minds are sharpened and ordinarily whetted in mannaging
affairs. Even as there are certain ulcers that are glad to be rubbed, and
desire to be handled, and the itch is not content except a man scratch it; So
these spirits which are seized with desires, as with malignant ulcers, take no
pleasure but in travail and affliction; For there are certain infirmities
which delight our bodies with a kind of pain, witness those that turn
themselves on this side, now on that, and refresh themselves in changing their
bed. Such was Achilles in Homer, sometimes he lay upon his belly, then upon his
back, and could never remain in one ^state. It is the true act of a sick man
not to be able to suffer any thing long time, but to think that his health
consists in his toss^ng and turning. Hence are diverse travels vndert^ken, and
shoares sought out, and lenity which is always an enemy to those things
which are present, now by sea, and then by land, aduentureth daily. Let us go
now into Campania, now that delicate soil delights us, let us visit the
wood countries, let us visit the forest of Calabria, and let us seek some
pleasure amidst the deserts, in such sort as these wandering eyes of ours may be
relieved in beholding at our pleasure the strange solitude of these savage
places. We must go see Tarentum and that haven so much esteemed, and the air
so sweet in Winter, and the stately houses of these ancient people. Let us
return to Rome back again, our ears have too long time been estra^ged from
the applause of the Theater and the Circensian sports, now would I take
pleasure to see men's blood spilt. Behold here how one voyage begets another,
and how after we have seen one thing we long for an other. After this manner
each man flies himself.
But what pro^iteth him to fly if he cannot escape, he runs after
himself, and has a very dangerous company that attends him. Let us
therefore know that the evil that presses us, comes not from the place but
from our selves. There is no affliction how light soever it be that is not
ouer-waighty for us, we are neither patient of labor or pleasure, we cannot
bear our own affairs, nor any thing else. Some by reason hereof have
procured their own d^aths, because that oftentimes having changed their
deliberation, they fell back again always into the same, and met with
nothing that is new, by means whereof both their life and this world began
to displease them, and the words which are the signs of foolish and enraged
pleasures come into their heads. How long shall we always see the same?

CHAP. III.
For a first remedy ^e r^qui^eth that the mi^d sh^u^d b^ o^cupi^d ^n ^^m^
^ocation w^^ch mi^^t ^e pro^itable to others.
THou ask me what remedy I think necessary against this perplexity. It
shall be good (as Athenodoras counsaileth us) to detain our selves in affairs
of estate, and to serve the commonweal. For as some spend the day in taking
the sun, and in exercises^ and care of their bodies, and as it is profitable
^or wrastlers to employ the most part of their time in exercising their arms
and strength whereunto they have only dedicated themselves; so is it requisite
for us who prepare our minds to the managing of public affairs to be
always in action. For he that has resolved himself to become profitable to
his Citizens, yea, unto all men at one time does two things, handling
(according to that endeavor that is given him) both the p^blique and his
particular affairs. But because (says he) in this so mad ambition of men,
where so many detractors wrest all things to the worst; simplicity is scarce
secure, and there will be always more lets then succesfull events, w^ ought
to retire our selves from the managing of public affairs; considering this
that a well se^led heart has the means to show it self in his private house.
It fares not so with men who for the most part have their actions secret and
hidden, as with Lions and other bruit beasts, who are locked up in their grates
to restrain their fury; yet in such sort ought a man to seek out solitude,
that wheresoever he remains in quiet, he may desire that the vigor of his
mind, his speech and action may serve every one in particular and all in
general. For not only he alone serves the Commonweal that produces the
Candidates to sue for offices, that defends the accused, who gives his
advise as touching the affairs of peace and war, but also that other that
instruct youth, that in so great want of good manners informs men's minds with
virtue that lays hold on, and restrains those who are addicted to avarice
and dissolution, or at least wise that hinders them from passing further, and
who in his private house procures the public good. Who does more, either the
Judge in a City that with his assistant pronounces a brief sentence in a
process that strangers and Citizens have before him: or he that teaches what
justice is, that shows what piety, wisdom, pureness, contempt of death
are, and how excellent a goad a good conscience is? If then thou employest thy
time in study, thou have not lost, these honors that are due to the execution
of thy charge concerning the public, neither shall thou be exempted from the
same. Neither is he a soldier that stands in the front of the battle and
defends both the right and left wings: but he also that gardeth the gates,
and stands sentinel in a place though not so dangerous, yet necessary, and
keeps his watch that has the government of the Ammunition house; which
charges though they be not bloody, yet have they (that execute them) their pay
as well as the rest. If thou shall retire thy self to thy studies, thou shall
avoid all care that tortureth man's life, thou shall not be troublesome to thy
self nor unprofitable to others; thou shall get thee many friends, and the
better sort of men will accept thee. For virtue, although she be poor and
abject, yet is she never obscured, but she shows the beams of her brightness
a far off, and whosoever is capable will acknowledge, and follow her steps.
For if we renounce all conversation and fly from humane society, and live
only to our private respect, this solitude deprived of all honest occupation
will find nothing at last whereto to addict her self; we shall begin to
build some houses, and to ouer-turne others; we shall t^rne the sea out of his
place; we shall cause the rivers to alter their courses, and dispense the time
very euilly, which nature gave us to bestow well. Sometimes we are too sparing,
sometimes ouer-prodigall, some of us employ the same in such sort that we can
yield no account thereof, others have none left them. And therefore there is
nothing more shameful to see an old man (that to approve that he has lived
long time in this world) can produce no other witness but the number of his
years. For mine own part (my dearest Serenus) me thinks that Athenodoras
submitted himself too much to times, and fled from them ouerhastilie. I
confess well that we ought sometimes to retire our selves but leasurely, and
with a secure retreat, our ensigns displaied, and without empeachment of our
worldly dignity. They are more valiant and more assured then their Conquerours
that make a fair and honest retreat. So in my opinion ought virtue to behave
her self, and if the inconstancy of worldly affairs disturb all, and takes
away from a virtuous man the means to do good; yet for all this ought he not
to turn his back, nor to cast away his weapons to save himself by flight, and
to thrust himself in a secret place, as if there could be any corner where
fortune could not find him out: but he ought to be less busy in affairs, and
find out some expedient with judgment to make himself profitable to his
Country. Is it not lawful for him to bear arms? let him aspire to some
public charge: must he not live privately? let him plead. Is he put to
silence? let him help his Citizens by his private counsel. Is it dangerous
for him to enter the judgment place? let him show himself a faithful friend,
a gracious companion, a temperate guest in houses, in Theaters, at feasts. If
he have lost the office of a Citizen? let him use that of a man. And therefore
with a great mind have we not shut our selves within the walls of one City,
but have thrust our selves into the conversation of the whole world, and have
professed that the world is our Country, that we might give virtue a more
spacious field to show herself in. Is the Tribunal shut against thee, art
thou not admitted to plead, or to assist the common Counsels of the City?
look back and see what great Nations and peoples are behind thee, never shall
so great a part be kept from thee, that a greater be not left thee. But beware
that all this proceed not from thine own error: for thou will not undertake a
public charge except thou be a Consul, a Pritanes, an Ambassador, a supreme
Dictator. What if thou will not be a Soldier except thou be a Commander or a
Tritane? although that others have the vaunt-gard, and fortune has put thee in
the rere-ward, do thy deuoire in that place, fight with thy voice, thy
exhortation, and thy courage. He also that has his hands cut off in fight,
finds some means to animate his companions, who stands only and
encourages them with crying. So must thou do if fortune has drawn thee from
the first rank of public charge, yet stand thou and help with thy crying.
If thy mouth be stopped, yet stand; and help with thy silence. The industry
of a good Citizen is never unprofitable, for by his hearing, by his sight, by
his contenance, by his beck, by his obstinate silence, and by his very gate,
he may profit. Even as certain wholesome drugs by their only smell (without
either touch or taste) do comfort greatly; so virtue, whether it be sowed or
locked in it self, whether it be by authority, or by accident, whether she
be constrained to scantle her sails, or to be idle or mute, confined in a
straight, or lodged at large, spreads a far and unperceived, performs
some great and profitable good. In brief, she serves in whatsoever estate and
countenance she be considered. What? think thou that the example of a man
that lives retired and to purpose, is of little use? I say, that it is an act
of a singular virtue to know how to forsake affairs, and to repose himself,
when as the active live being hindered by diverse accidents, or by the condition
of estate cannot effect his designs. For never see we affairs brought to that
extremity but that a virtuous man has the means to do somewhat that is good.
Can thou find a City more wretched then that of the Athenians was, at such
time as thirty Tyrants rent it in pieces. They had put to death Thirteen
hundred of the most nobles and most virtuous in the City, and for all that
cruelty ceased not thus but incensed it self, and augmented daily. In that
City which was adorned with the most venerable Counsel of the Arcopagites,
where there was a Senate and an assembly of people worthy of so worthy an
assembly of Senators; there were gathered daily a miserable troop of
murderers, and a wretched court of tyrants, too small to contain them. Could
this City be in repose wherein there were so many tyrants as there were
Soldiers? There was not any hope for these poor Citizens to recover their
liberty, nor any remedy whatsoever against such a multitude of mischiefs.
For where is it that this poor City might find so many Harmodians?
Notwithstanding (all these miseries) Socrates was in the midst of them, who
comforted the mournful Fathers, and exhorted those that despaired of the
Commonweal, and reproved the rich (who feared their goods) for the ouerlate
repentance of their dangerous avarice, and to those that would follow him,
bear about a worthy example, whilst amongst the thirty tyrants he walked
confident and free. Yet this man did the Athenians murder in prison, and he
that safely insulted over the troops of tyrants, his liberty could not a free
City endure and hearken to, to the end thou may know, that a wise man has
an occasion to show himself in an afflicted Commonweal; and how in a
flourishing and blessed state many envy, and a thousand other disarmed Cities
do reign. Howsoever therefore the Commonwealth is disposed, howsoever
fortune permits, so either may we enlarge or contract our selves, provided
always that we be stirring, and suffer not our selves being chained with fear
to be dulled and astonished. Nay he shall be truly a man who (when as dangers
are eminent every ways, and when as swords and chains thunder in his ears)
neither breaks his fortune, nor hides it. Curious Dentatus was wont to say,
That he had rather be dead then live. It is the last of all evils to depart
from the number of the living before thou die. But thou art to endeavor,
that if thou light on such a time wherein thou can not intermeddle with the
Commonweal without danger, to usurp more time for thy repose and study, and
no otherways then in a dangerous navigations make sail toward the haven,
neither exspect thou, until such time as affairs leave thee, but dis-ioyne
thou thy self from them.

CHAP. IIII.
FIrst, The means to effectuate this remedy is to fly vain ^lorie, foolish
bashfulnes, pride, wrath, and folly.
therefore we ought to examine our selves; next, what business we undertake;
lastly, what they are for whose cause we undertake them, or with whom we
deal. Above all things a man ought to estimate himself, for, for the most
part in our own judgments, we seem to be able to do more then we can. There
is one that loses himself in ouer-trusting his own eloquence; another has
spent more then his revenue mounteth to; another has oppressed his weak body
with laborious offices. There are some that are to bashful to entermeddle with
civil affairs, which require a confident countenance and resolution: some
men's contumacy is unfit for Court; some there are who have no government over
their wrath, and every slight occasion drives them to intemperate language;
some cannot refrain from jesting, neither can they abstain from dangerous
gybing. To all these, repose is more profitable then business: a fierce and
impatient man by nature will avoid the prouocations of harmefull liberty.

CHAP. V.
NExt of all these things which we undertake are to be estimated, That we
charge not and occupy not ourselves above measure.
and our forces are to be compared with those things which we will attempt. For
there must alwais be a greater force in him that bears, then in the burden.
These waights must needs bear him down, that are greater then he is that
carries them. Besides there are ^ome affairs that are not so great as they
are fruitful, and breed many other business, and these are to be avoided,
from whence a new and diverse occasion of trouble arises: neither must thou
adventure thither, whence thou can not freely return again. Set thy hand to
these things, whose end thou may either effect or at leastwise hope. These
things are to be left that extend themselves farther then the act, and end not
there where thou intendedst they should.

CHAP. VI.
WE must likewise make some choice of men, He advises us to shun the secrets
of ungrateful persons, and such as are proud who think that all the world is
bound unto the^, and feed on nothing but vain glory.
and to consider whether they are worthy on whom we should employ a part of
our life, and whethe^ the loss of our time may be redeemed to our profit.
There are some that think that we are bound to do them pleasure before we
be desired. Athenodorus says, that he would not go to supper with him who
would not think it a courtesy in him to accept the same. I believe thou
conceiuest, that much less would he be invited by them, who requite their
friends courtesies with feasts, and account their many dishes for a debt, as if
they were intemperate to do an other man honor, take from them their witnesses
and spectators, they will conceive no delight in their secret banquets. Thou
art to consider whether thy nature be more apt for public business, or for
idle study and contemplation; and thither art thou to incline, whether the
vigor of thy mind carries thee. Isocrates being laid hold on by the
Ephone, withdrew himself from public pleas, supposing himself to be more
fit and profitable to write histories; for enforced wits never satisfy
expectation, and the labor is in vain where nature repineth against it.

CHAP. VII.
A remedy against a troub^^d mind, is to ^aue a ^rusty friend.
YEt nothing will so much delight the mind as a faithful and pleasing
friendship: how great a good is it when the hearts are prepared, wherein a man
may safely bury all his secrets, whose conscience thou fear le^se then
thine own, whose words may terrify thy discontents, whose counsels can
resolve thy doubts, whose mirth may dissipate thy sorrow, and whose countenance
may comfort thee? Such friends as these let us make choice of as far as is
possible for us: for vices creep into us, Marks to show and know what friend^
we ought to choose.
and invade every one that is nearest them, and hurt by touching. Therefore as
in the plunge we ought to take heed, lest we sit by these who are already
attainted, and infected with the burning sickness, because thereby we shall
incur danger, and be poisoned with their very breath; so must we endeavor
in the choice of our friends, that we admit such as are least polluted. It is
a beginning of sickness to accompany those that are infected: neither will I
enjoin thee this to follow and contract friendship with none, except he be a
wise man; for where will thou find out such a one, whom for so many ages we
have sought after? but we are to take him for the best who is the least evil.
Scarce could thou make a happier choice, had thou leave to se^ke for good
men amongst Platoes and Zenoph^ns, or amidst the the troop of Socrates
Scholars, or if it were granted thee to reuiew the time wherein Cato lived,
which as well brought forth many that were worthy to be borne in Catoes age,
as many worse then ever were, who were the plotters of many heinous crimes. For
their vices need of both sorts, to the end that Cato might be the better
known. Of good, by whom he might approve himself; of bad, Who they are that
are not to be enterta^ned into frien^ship.
in whom he might make trial of his forces; yet especially let such be
avoided, who are melancholy and deplore all things, who, upon every occasion
are ready to complain, although his faith and benevolence be unfeigned, yet so
distempered a companion, that grieueth and grudgeth at all things, is an enemy
to tranquillity.

CHAP. VIII.
LEt us pass over to riches which are the causes of all men's miseries: for,
The third remedy is now to fear poverty, because the poor have many
adua^tages above the rich.
if you compare all things whereat we are agrieued, as deaths, sicknesses,
fears, de^ires, patience of sorrows, and labors, with those evils which our
money ministers unto us, this part will weigh heauiest: we ought therefore to
bethink us, how far lighter the sorrow is not to have them, then to lose
them, and we shall understand that poverty has by so much the less torments,
by how much she has the less matter of loss: for thou art deceived, if thou
think that rich men do with greater courage endure their losses. The pain of
a wound is equal both in the greatest and smallest sadness; Bion speaks very
elegantly, That it is no less troublesome for those that are balde, to have
their hairs pulled of, then to those that have but hie locks. Know thou this
both in rich and poor, that they have equal torments; for both of them told
their money, neither without grief and sense thereof could they endure to lose
it. But as I said, it is more tolerable and easy not to get riches, then to
lose them, and therefore shall you see them more merry, whom fortune never looked
upon, then those whom she has forsaken. Diogenes saw this, who was a man of a
great mind, and endeavored himself that nothing might be taken from him. Call
thou this poverty necessity, or want, and impose whatsoever ignominious name
thou list upon security, I will not think this man happy if thou find me out
an other that can lose nothing. But I am deceived, if it be not a Kingdom
among the covetous, the deceivers, the thief, and lewd persons, that there is
one that may not be hurt. If any man doubt of Diogenes felicity, he may
likewise doubt of the estate of the immortal gods, whether they live blessedly
enough, because they have no fields, nor gardens, nor lands for a husbandman
to plow up, not a great bank of money in the market place. Art thou not
ashamed whosoever thou art that admirest riches? Behold I pray thee the heavens
throne, shall thou see the gods naked, giving all things, having nothing.
Think thou him poor, or like unto the immortal gods, that has dispoiled
himself of all transitory things. Call thou Demetrius more happy who was
Pompies Libertine, because he was not ashamed to be more richer then his
Master? Every day was the number of his servants brought unto him, as the
master of an Army to a General, who for all his riches should have long since
contented himself with two servants, and a lesser seller. But Diogenes only
servant ran away from him, neither thought he him so much worthy as to recall
him when he was showed unto him. It were a shame (says he) that Manes could
live without Diogenes, and Diogenes could not live without Manes. A continent
speech of Diogenes.
Me think he said, meddle with thine own business Fortune, thou have no
more power Diogenes. Is my servant run away? no, he is departed free. A family
requires maintenance, men must take charge of the feeding of so many greedy
beasts, raiment must be bought, thiefes hand-sell prevented, and such as weep
and detest, must be admitted to service. Hence, far more, happy is he that
owes nothing but to himself, whom he may easily deny: but because we have
not so much strength, our patrimonies be to be husbanded that we may be less
exposed to the injuries of ^ortune, An excellent example to show the advantages
of the poor.
The bodies of meanest proportion and who may lock themselves in their arms,
are more addressed then those great and vnweeldy bodies, which by reason of
their length and thickness are exposed to strokes. The best measure in riches
is that which neither falls into poverty, neither is far estranged from
poverty.

CHAP. IX.
The fourth remedy is to keep a measure in desire, gathering, possessing and
using worldly goods.
ANd this measure will be well pleasing unto us, if first of all parcimony
content us, without which neither any riches will suffice us, neither any prove
great enough, especially whereas the remedy is at hand, and poverty it self by
the assistance of frugality may convert it self into riches. Let us accustom
our selves to remove pomp from us, and to measure the ornaments of our honor
by the necessary use of things. Let our meat appease famine, or drink thirst;
let our desires be appeased by things that are necessary. Let us learn to
walk upon our own feet, not to cloth and feed our selves according to every
new fashion, but as the custom of our Ancestors persuades us unto. Let us
learn to increase contine^cy, to decrease lasciuiousnes, to temper our
excess, to pacify our wrath, to behold poverty with equal eyes, to respect
frugality, although we will be ashamed to yield such remedies to our natural
desires as cost very little, to have unbridled hopes, and our mind that
depends on future things, kept as it were under bonds, to behave our selves
so that we require not our riches at fortunes hand, but rather from our selves.
So great variety and iniquity of casualties cannot (I say) be so repulsed,
that many storms press not upon those that rigge forth much Shipping. Our
affairs must be drawn into a straight, to the end that adversities may
attempt us in vain. And therefore banishments and calamities have sometimes
become remedies, and those incommodities that are most grievous have been
healed by lighter, where the mind is disobedient to precepts, and will not be
cured by gentle means. But why may not this be profitable? If both poverty and
ignominy, and the overthrow of a man's fortunes accompany these: one evil is
opposed against another. Let us therefore accustom our selves to be able to
sup without any guests, to be served with less attendants, to be apparelled
according to our necessities, and to dwell more retiredly. It is not only in
the course of the Circean sports; but also in the Cariers of this life that we
ought to retire and contract our selves. And in studies likewise (wherein the
charge is most commended) so long will I have a reason as I have a measure. To
what end serve so many infinite Books and Libraries when as their Master in
all his life time can scarcely ouer-read their Tables? A multitude of books
burtheneth and instructs him not that learneth, and it is better for thee to
addict thy self to few Auth^rs, then to wander amongst many. Forty Thousand
books were burned at Alexandr^a, a worthy monument of kingly riches. Some men
may praise this as Titus Liuius did, who says, That it was a work that showed
the magnifice^ce and wondrous care of Kings. But this was not magnifice^ce or
any other laudable act, but a studious excess. Nay more, it was not studious,
because they had gathered them, not to profit studies, but to show their pomp,
as it falls out with diverse ignorants, who scarce knowing the letters wherein
their slaves are exercised, heap up book^ not as instruments of study, but
ornaments of their suppers. Let us therefore gather so many books as may
suffice, and collect nothing for ostentation sake. It shall be more honest
(say thou) to employ my money herein, then in vessels of Corinth and painted
Tables. That is every ways vicious where there is ouermnch. Why would thou
less pardon him that would get reputation by means of his Marble and Iuorie,
then another that searches thorough all Countries to buy unknown Authors,
and happily such as are reproved and censured, and does naught else but breath
upon his books, If a great company of books be not accom^anied with a seri^us
s^udy, and w^ll ^ouerned, that is but a ^e^k^rie.
and takes no pleasure but in their couers, or in their titles? Thou shall
ordinarily see amongst the most idle, whatsoever Orators or Histories there
are, and their studies filled up from the top to the bottom: And at this day
amongst the bathes and stoues are Libraries builded, as if they were a
necessary ornament in the house. But all these works of learned men excellently
written, bound up, and enriched with their pictures, are bought to no other end
but for show and beautifying of wal^.

CHAP. X.
But it may be thou art fallen into some troublesome and difficult course of
life, The fifth remedy is to endure quietly the di^^iculties of a man's
vocation, and to accustom himself because he sees that pleasures are
intermix^d with perplexities.
and ere thou knewst it; some fortune either public or private has entangled
thee^ in such sort, as thou neither can loose or break the bonds. Think with
thy self, that such as are fettered at the first can hardly bear their
shackles or the irons on their legs, but afterward being better resolved do
suffer the same, and conclude to endure them patienly, necessity teaches them
to sustain them constantly, and custom easily. Thou shall find in whatsoe^^^
kind of (...) be, delights, remissions, and pleasures, except thou had not
rather think (...) evil, then make it hateful. The greatest good that we have
r^cieued by nature is, that she foreseeing how many troubles we are to endure

arrested by ^^o^^ charges that are co^^itted unto them. All our whole life is a
serui^^de^ we ought herefore to accustom our selves to our condition^ and no
ways to complain of the same, (...) to apprehend all those commodi^ies which
are about us. Th^re is nothing so di^^astfull wherein an equal mind cannot
find some solace. Ostimes a^ ingenious man may write infinite things in the

the ha^des^ things may be in (...) the straightest laid open, and those things
that are most grieu^^^s press them least that discreetly can endure them.
Besides^ desires are not to be^ sent ^arre off from us, but let us suffer them
to houer near abo^t us, because they endure not to be restrained whol^e.
Leaving those things which either cannot be done or hardly can be a^chieued;
let us follow those things that ar^ near^ ^s, and are ^nswerable to our hopes.
Yet let us know, that all that which outwardly ^at^ diverse appearances is
equally light, and inwa^dly (...) le^ us (...) those that are more highly
preferred, those things that see^e most highest are in most danger. They
likewise whom adversity holds in suspense shall b^e more assured by
withdrawing pride from those things which of thems^l^^s are proud, and reducing
their fortune (as much as in them lies) to an humble place and out of danger.
There are many that are enforced to remain in their high degree, from whence
they cannot descend but by falling, but yet it behooves them to bear witness,
that the greatest weight they bear upon their backs is to know, that they are
constrained to be grievous and troublesome unto others. That they are not
relieved but tied unto their charge, and that by justice, clemency, and humane
laws, and by a gracious manner of demeanor they prepare themselves diverse
succors and defenses against the assaults of fortune that may happen, by the
hope whereof they may be more assured in their fevers. There is nothing that
can so much exempt these men from these agitations of the minds, then always
to prefixe a certain limit to their increase, and not to attend till fortune
retire them from the same, but to take counsel of themselves, not to attend
the extremities. So some desires, but they finite, shall acuate their minds,
and shall not be infinite nor uncertain.

CHAP. XI.
He maintain^th always the doctrine of the Stoickes, and distinguishes the
s^u^^^ous from the wise, whom he raises above al humane fortunes, and
describes him here with his contentments.
THis Discourse of mine appertains to ignorant persons, and such as have
little knowledge, and are of depraved judgment, not unto a wise man. For he
must not walk fearfully or slowly. For so great a confidence has he in him
self, that he doubts not to en^ounter Fortune, neither will he ever give
place unto her; neither has he cause at any time to fear her, because not
only he numbreth his stars, his possessions, and dignities, but his own
body likewise, his eyes and hands, and whatsoever it be that makes his life
dear unto him, yea, himself, as things that are hired, and lives as though
he were but lent unto himself, ready to restore the whole willingly to those
that redemand the same; neither therefore mispraiseth he himself, because he
knows that he is not his own, but so diligently and circumspectly shall he
do all things, as a religious and holy man is wont to do with those things
that are committed to his trust. And whenever he shall be commanded to make
restitution, he will not question with fortune, but will say, I give thanks
for that I have possessed, and had: It has cost me much to entertain those
things which thou have given me, but because thou command me, I gratefully
and willingly restore them again, and if thou will have ought continue in my
hands, even now will I keep it, if thou be other ways minded, I restore unto
thee, and redeliuer into thy hands, my money and plate, my house and family
whatsoever. If nature summon us which first gave us credit, to her will we
answer. Receive a mind better then thou gave me, The seventh remedy is not
to prise this life, nor that which ^ee possess more then we need, but to
dispose our selves courageously unto death, and to whatsoever casually.
I neither delay nor hide my self, I willingly and readily deliver thee it
which thou gave me when I knew it not. Take it to thee; what evil is it to
return to that place from whence thou came? He shall live badly that knows
not how to die well. We must therefore above all things set light by this
life, and account our souls amongst the number of those things that are not
ours: We hate (says Cicero) those skirmishers, if in any sort they desire to
beg their lives, we ^auour them if they pretend to contemn the same: Know
that the like befalls us; for oftimes the cause of dying, is to die
fearfully: that fortune that makes sport for her self, whereto says she
shall I reserve thee wretched and fearful Creature as thou art? thou shall
receive more wounds and skarres, because thou know not how to yield thy
throat: but thou shall both live longer, and die sooner, that manfully
entertainest thy death, not in plucking back thy neck, or opposing thy hands.
He that shall fear death, will never do any thing worthy a living man: but
he that knows that this ordinance of life and death was decreed and presently
ordered in him, at such time as he was conceived, he will live according to
the rule and ordinance was prefixed him, and this likewise with no less
constancy of mind will he per^orme, that none of those things that befall him,
may seem sudden to him: for to foresee that which is to come, as though it were
already past, is the mean to repulse the assaults of all necessities, which
shake not these who attend them constantly, and know that there is nothing new
in them: but they oppress those men that make themselves believe that no
misfortune shall ever surprise them, and who think on nothing but pleasure and
content; for there is no sodainenesse either in sickness, or in captivity, or
in ruin or in fire: For I know well into what tumultuous retreat of dangers
nature had locked ^e: so oftimes have men cried fire and water amongst my
neighbors, so oftimes have the torches and tapers which were carried before
the dead bodies of this or that man's children past by my doors? Often have I
heard the noice of high buildings that suddenly fell down to the ground. one
night has carried away diverse friends that I had made in the Palace, in the
market place, in company, and has as it were cut off the hands of those which
had promised and sworn fidelity unto me. Shall I wonder then that those
dangers that have houered so long about me, are finally faln^ upon me? The most
part of those that are ready to set sail, The eighth remedy is to rem^mber
that all evils that be^all us, and all other men cannot happen, and
consequently to detain our selves in good time.
think not upon a storm; for mine own part in doing well I will never be
ashamed of the danger that may befall me. Publius that had a more vehement
spirit then either the Tragic or Comicke Poets had, as often as he had given
over his Mimicke foperies, and such as ordinarily he used to delight the
common people: amongst many other words, not only beseeming the Comicke but
the Tragic Theme, he uses these: That which happened to one man may chance to
every man.
Whosoever bears these words in his heart, and considers how many miseries
his neighbor suffers from day to day, and thinks that they are intended
against him, will arm himself long time before he be assailed. Too late is
the mind instructed to endure danger when their assault is given: I would not
have thought that this should have been I would not have believed that this
should come to pass. And why not? what riches are there that are not readily
attended at their heels with misery, famine and beggary? what dignity is
there, what scarlet robe, what Augures purple garment, what noble man's slipper?
that is not accompanied with disgrace, banishment, dishonor, imputation, and
extreme contempt? what Kingdom is there, for which ruin, desolation, tyranny
and tormenters are not prepared: neither as these divided by great spaces of
time, but there is but a moment of an hour betwixt royalty and captivity. Know
thou therefore that every condition is subject to alteration, and whatsoever
assaulteth one man, may assail thee in like sort. Art thou rich? what richer
than Pompey? who after that Caius his ancient cosen and new guest had opened
Caesar's house to lock up his own doors, wanted both bread and water, in such
sort, that he who possessed so many rivers, that had their courses and falls
within the precinct of his lands, begde for drop^ of water, and died for hunger
and thirst in his kinsmans Palace, whilst his heir prepared a public
funeral for the starueling. Have thou had great honors? what so great or so
unexpected, or so general as Seianus? that very day wherein the Senate
conducted him with honor, the people tare him in pieces with fury, and he whom
Gods and men had laden with so many honors as could be heaped upon him, had
not a mammocke left of him for the hangman to fasten his hook in. Art thou a
King? I will not send thee to Croesus, who was commanded to mount the pile
where he should be burned, and whence he descended, having recovered both
his life and kingdom; neither will I send thee to Iugurth, whom the Roman
people saw led in triumph that very year wherein he was so much feared. We
have seen Ptol^my King of Africa, and Mithridates King of Armenia, amongst the
number of those Soldiers that were of the Emperor Caligulaes guard; the one of
these was sent into banishment, the other wished for it but under more
faithful conditions. For he was slain by the way.
In so great in^ertainety and mutability of affairs, thou reputest not that
already done which may be done; thou give adversity power over thy self
which he has broken whosoever espied them first. The next after these is,
that we labor not in superfluous and unnecessary things, The ninth remedy is
so sly vnn^cess^ry occupations.
that is, that we neither desire those things which we cannot attain, or that
having attained the same, we feel not ouerlate, and to our great shame the
vanity of our covetousness, in fine that our travel be not unprofitable and
of no effect, or the effect unworthy our travel: for for the most part sorrow
and sadness succeeds by these, if either that we expected fail (...), or we
be ashamed of the success.

CHAP. XII.
WE must cut off these encounters practiced by the most part of men, who do
naught else but run from house to house from the market place to the Theater.
The tenth, to sly vain curiosity.
They entangle themselves with other men's affairs, resembling those who seem
to be always busy about somewhat. If thou ask any of these that goes out of
his doors: Whether go thou? what think thou? He will answer, verily I
know not, but I will visit some friend, I will do somewhat. They loyter about
to no purpose, seeking out business, neither finish they those that they
intended, but those they meet by chance. Inconsiderate and vain is their
course, resembling that of the Antes, which creep along the shrubbes, and now
get up to the top, and straight run down to the bottom, without ought
else doing but running. Such a life do many men lead, and a man may well say
that they are idle without repose. Thou will have compassion of some of those
who run as it were to a fire, and who ouerturne all those that they meet
with, and fall upon them, for they run to salute some man that will scarce
look upon them, or go to attend some stranger to his funeral, or to
accompany some Lawyer: or to honor a Bridal, or to follow some Litter, or
sometimes to bear it themselves: then returning home very weary and toiled
into their houses, thou shall hear them swear, that they knew not why they
went out, neither why they left the house, and notwithstanding the next day
they will idle it after the same manner. Let therefore all our labor tend to
some end, and have some scope. It is not industry but the false appearance of
things that tormenteth, and disquiet mad men: for they busy themselves not
without some hope, the exterior beauty of this or that inflameth them in stead
of taxing their vanity, by reason that the sense is occupied. In like case are
all they, who go already to the intent to multiply the number of the people
that walk about the streets, are carried away by vain and light occasions;
and he that has nothing to employ himself in, gets him out of doors upon the
dayspring, and after he has knocked at diverse men's doors, whence he has been
honestly dismissed by the Porter, and by others, who have hindered him from
entrance; there is no man with whom he acquainteth himself more unwillingly
then with himself. On this evil there depends a most pernicious vice, which
is curiosity; search into affairs and secret knowledge of many things that
are dangerous, both to be spoken and heard. Democritus having had proof
hereof, said; That he that will live peaceably, ought not to intermeddle with
many affairs, either private or public. Having a reference to those things
that are unnecessary: for if they are necessary, there are not many but
innumerable things to be done, both private and public: but whereas no solemn
office inuiteth us, our actions are to be restrained.

CHAP. XIII.
FOr he that does many things yields himself subject to fortunes power, To

but the surest way is to make trial of her very little, but to think always
of her, and never to put confidence in her. I will sail except somewhat hinder
me; I will be Praetor ex^ept some one let me, and my business shall come well
to pass except some accident cross it. This is the cause why we say, that
nothing befalls a wise man contrary to his opinion; we say not that he is
exempt from the chances of this life, but from the errors; neither do all
things fall out unto him as he wishes, but as he thought: and first of all he
thought that somewhat might resist his purposes. The sorrow a man conceiueth,
for that he could not attain to that which he pretended, is light, and
scarsly touches the heart when he promises himself not that things shall
succeed as he desired.

CHAP. XIIII.
WE ought likewise to acco^modate our selves to affairs, without presuming
over much of our conceptions. Let us dispose our selves thither whether Fortune
leads us, neither let us fear the charges of our counsels or condition,
provided that leuity transporteth us not, which is a mortal enemy to
tranquillity: for it must needs be, that obstinacy is both doubtful and
miserable from which fortune always extorteth somewhat, and leuity much more
grievous, that no ways contains it self: both of these are enemies to
tranquillity, both too unable to change any thing, and unapt to suffer any
thing. In all casualties a man ought to retain his mind far from all
external things, and to reflect upon himself, to pro^ure that he t^ust in
himself, to rejoice in himself, to content himself with his thoughts, to
estrange himself, as much as he may, from other men's affairs, to apply
himself to himself, not to have any sense of his losses, and take in good
part his adversities. When Zeno the Stoicke understood that his ship was cast
away, and all his goods drowned, Fortune (says he) wills me to follow the
study of wisdom more freely. A tyrant threatened the Philosopher Theodorus
with death, and that his body should not be buried. Thou have (says he) an
occasion wherein to delight thy self; thou have a pint of blood in thy power:
For as touching my burial thou should be a great fool, if thou think
that I care whether I rotte above or underground. Cannius Julius an excellent
man, whose glory is no ways diminished, although he was borne in our age,
contested long time with the Emperor Caius; who as Caius was departing from
him said unto him, Least happily thou ^latter thy self with foolish hope, I
have commanded thee to be put to death. I thank thee (said he) worthy Prince.
I know not well what he m^ant or thought by these words, for diverse
considerations present themselves unto me. Thought he best to upbraid him, and
to show how great his cruelty was, wherein death was a benefit? Or did he
reproach him for his ordinary fury? for they gave him thanks likewise whose
children were slain, and whose goods were taken from them. Or did he willingly
entertain his death as a liberty? whatsoever he thought he answered worthily.
But some man may say that Caius after this might have granted him life. Cannius
was not afraid of this: Caius faith was too well known in such like commands.
Think thou that he passed those ten days without fear, betwixt the day of
his sentence and that of his execution? It is incredible to be spoken what
words he spoke, what he did, and how peaceably he lived during this delay. He
was playing at Chesse at such time as the Centurion who led a troop of
condemned men to death commanded him likewise to be cited. Having scarce
finished his game he counted his men, and said to him with-whom he played,
Beware (says he) when I am dead that thou belyest me not, and say thou have
won the game. Then nodding his head to the Centurion he added, Bear me
witness (says he) that I have the vantage of one. Think thou that Cannius
cared for the man? no he mocked. His friends were dismayed because they were to
loose such a man. Why (says he) are you sad? enquire you whether souls be
immortal? I shall know it presently. Neither ceased he to search out the truth
even until his latter breath, and according to his custom to propose always
some question. There followed him a Philosopher of his own train, and when he
approached near the place where the toombe stood whereupon daily sacrifice was
made to Diuus Caesar. Cannius (quoth he) what think thou now, and whereon
fixest thou thy mind? I am resolved (said Cannius) to mark in this most swift
moment of time, if the soul shall feel that she is passing forth. And he
promised that if he found out any thing, he would return to every one of his
friends, and tell them what the estate of souls were. Behold Tranquillity in
the midst of a tempest; behold a mind worthy of eternity, which summoneth
his destiny for an argument of the truth, who seeing himself ready to
deliver his last breath, questioned with his departing soul, and that will not
only learn until death, but learneth something likewise out of death it
self. No man philosophied longer: But this so great a man shall not be
obscured so slightly, his praise shall be carefully eternized, we will
commend thee to everlasting memory. O worthy Cannius, the greater part of
Caius cruel murders.

CHAP. XV.
But it profits nothing to have cast away the cause of private sadness. The
twelft remedy is that we ought to despise all humane things, bear the^
contentedly that are imposed on us, and laugh with Democritus.
For sometimes the hatred of mankind possesses thee, and a troop of so many
fearful sins present themselves, when thou bethinkest thy self how rare
simplicity is, how unknown innocence, how sieldome faith, except when it
ministers profit, how the disaduantages of dissolution are as hateful as the
advantages, and ambition is so excessive and proud, that she cannot contain
her self within her limits, and boasts not but in her villainies. The mind is
blinded and obscured, and as if all virtues were ouer-turned, which neither we
may hope for, neither is it profitable for us to have, darkness ouer-cloudeth
all things; we must therefore dispose our selves, that the vices of the common
sort be not displeasing unto us, A comparison betwixt Democritus and Heraclitus.
but rather may s^^me ridiculous, and rather let us imitate Democritus then
Heraclitus. For this man as often as he went abroad wept, and the other laughed.
To this man, all those things which we do seemed miseries; to that man,
follies: All things therefore are to be set light by, and to be endured with a
patient mind; for it is more fitting to laugh at life, then to bewail it. Add
hereunto also, that he deserves better of mankind who laugheth thereat, then
he that bewaileth it: for he leaves some good hope, the other so foolishly
bewaileth it, that he dispaireth of the recovery thereof, and he that cannot
abstain from laughter, in beholding all that which the world does, is of a
greater mind then the other that spends himself in tears, when as he
means the lightest passion of the mind, and thinks that there is nothing
great, nothing severe, nor any thing serious in this so great preparation and
show of men. Let every one present unto himself the occasions which may
either dismay or rejoice us, and he shall know that that which Bion said is
true, That all the affairs of men are answerable to their beginnings, and that
their life is neither more holy nor more severe then their designs, conceived
only in their souls: But is better peaceably to behold men's public manners
and imperfection, then torment himself thus for other men's afflictions, and
inhumane is that pleasure that delights in other men's evils; even as it is
an unprofitable humanity to weep and counterfeit sadness, because some man
carries forth his child to be buried. In thine own misfortunes likewise it
behooves thee to carry thy self so that thou yield so much unto thy sorrow as
it requires, not as custom demands. For many men power forth tears for a
show, and so often have they their eyes dry as they want witnesses of their
sorrow, judging it an absurd thing not to weep when all men are discomforted.
So deep an impression has this evil fixed in our minds, to depend on other
men's opinions, that sorrow (which of it self is the simplest thing) is
converted into dissimulation. The thirteenth remedy is to think, that good men
are neither miserable in their li^e nor in their death, and that ^or the same
cause we ought to resemble them.
There follows another point which is accustomed to dismay and make men
pensive, and not without cause, that is, because good men die miserably. As
S^crates is compelled to dye in prison, Rutillius to live in exile, Pompey and
Cicero to yield their necks to be stricken off by those whom formerly they had
defended, and that Cat^ (the living image of virtues) leaning on his sword
should at once loose his life and his Countries liberty. It must needs torment
us to see fortune recompense good deserts so unjustly, and what now may any man
hope for himself, when as he sees the best men suffer the worst afflictions?
What shall be done hereupon? Consider how every one of them behaved himself
constantly, and if they were valiant desire their minds, if they perished
^ffeminately and basely, there is nothing lost. Either they are worthy that
their virtue should please thee, or unworthy that a man should bewail their
cowardice. For what is more hateful then to see great men dying valiantly, to
cause other men to be catifes and cowards? Let us praise him that was so often
worthy to be praised, and say; The more constant, the more happy art thou: thou
have fled humane casualties, hatred and sickness, thou have left thy prison,
thou were not worthy in thy Gods opinion of an evil fortune, but unworthy
against whom fortune might now do any thing: but those that would retire
themselves, and in the instant of death look back unto life, must have hands
laid on them. I will neither weep for any one that laugheth, or any one that
weepeth. The one has himself wiped away my tears; the other has by his
tears effected this, that he is unworthy of any tears. Shall I weep for
Hercules because he was burned alive, or Regulus, because his ^l^sh was
pierced with so many nails, or Cato, because he courageously endured the
wounds he gave himself. All these men by a light expense of time found out
the means to make themselves eterned, and by dying attained to immortality.
There is yet another great subject of careful thoughts that thou disguise and
counterfeit cunningly, The foureteenth remedy is to s^^e hypocrisy.
neither ever show thy self to be such outwardly, as thou art inwardly,
res^mbling the lives of many, which ar^ fained and fashioned only for
ostentation: for it is a death to stand thus always on our guard, and to fear
to be surprised in an other estate then we are accustomed. We are never void
of care, as long as this opinion governs us, and that men estimate our
persons as oftentimes as they see us: for many things fall out which discover
us in spite of our hearts, and although so retired an observation of a man's
self succeeds well, yet so it is, that to live always, thus disguised, does
but afflict and affright the life which would enjoy a thousand pleasures if
she were beautified with an open and simple manner of action, and set not a
veil before her manners. True it is that this life is an hazard of contempt,
if all things were discovered unto all men; for some there are that disdain
all that which they approach somewhat near unto, and observe, and better were
it to be contemned by reason of simplicity, then to be tormented with a
perpetual dissimulation. The ^i^teenth, to keep^ a measure in solitude and
conue^sation.
Yet ought thou to keep a measure, and it imports thee as very much to be
advised, whether thou live simply or negligently; we ought to retire our
selves very inwardly within our selues^ for the conversation of those men that
are of different humor from us, disturbeth those things that are well composed,
and renueth affections, and exulcerateth whatsoever is either weak or uncured
in the mind, yet notwithstanding it is need^ull to intermixe solitude and
freedom together, in such sort as the one may be practiced near unto the
other. Conversation will make us love our selves, The sixeteenth to give some
re^ose unto the m^nd, acc^^ding to Socrates, Cato, and Sci^ione^ ^xamples.
solitude inciteth us to go and find out others, the one will comfort the
other, solitude will heal the discontent we have conceived against the press
of so many people that we have met withal, and to frequent with diverse men
remedi^th that discontent which solitude breeds. Neither is the mind to be
entertained equally in the same intention, but to be revoked unto some
pastimes. Socrates was not ashamed to play with children, and Cato made him
merry with wine when public affairs had tired him, and Scipio exercised his
warlike and triumphant body in dancing (not foolishly as men are wont to do
at this day with res^uences and tricks that are more then effeminate) but as
the ancients were wont to dance in their sports and festival days, with a
decent and comely behavior, whilst no dishhonour or reproach might ensue,
though he had been observed by hi^ very enemies. There must some remission
be gi^en to our minds; for after a little repose they will become more better
and active in all things. Even as we ought not to ouerlay our fruitful lands,
lest by continual fecundity their heart and force^ be spent and consumed; so
continual labor ruinateth men's minds, if you suffer them to expatiate and
delight themselves a while, they will recover new forces. Continual travel
dulleth and blunteth the edge of understanding; neither to this vicissitude
would the desire of man bend so much, except that sport and pastime had some
pleasure and natural content, the frequent use whereof takes away all that
which presses and afflicts our spirits. For sleep is necessary for
disgestion, and if a man continue the same both day and night, it will be
death. There is a great difference betwixt giving some liberty to a thing, and
leaving it wholly at random. The Lawmakers have ordained f^stiuall days, to
the end that men should assemble together to entertain public sport,
enterposing the same as a necessary temperament and refreshing of trauelles.
And as I have said, great personages allowed themselves certain play-dayes in
every month, and some other never passed day which was not as it were divided
b^twixt travel and repose, such (except I forget my self) was that great
Orator Asinius Pollio, who gave over all occupations after ten of the clock;
nay more, he would not read ordinary letters, for fear lest some new ^affaire
might fall out, but he enclosed all the travel of the day time, from the
morning until that hour. Some took their pleasure about twelve of the clock,
and referred over those affairs that were of smallest importance till after
dinner time. The order of the ancient Romans in the manner of their lives.
Our Ancestors have forbidden to make any new report unto the Senate after ten
of the Clock. The Soldier disposes his Sentinels by hours, and they that
return from some voyage of war, are exempted from night-watch. It is a
necessary thing to give liberty to the mind, and to grant him intermission,
which may serve to nourish, and reinforce the same; Furthermore, to walk here
and there amidst the fields, to the end that having free and open air, he may
be the more comforted and lightened. Sometimes to go in Coach, to travel and
change Countries, augmenteth the forces, likewise to make good cheer, and to
drink somewhat freely more then custom, and so far as we drown not our
selves in wine, but to drown our cares in it: for wine drives away cares,
searches the secrets of the mind, drives away all sickness, and is the
remedy of sadness; and therefore B^cchus the inuentor of wine was not therefore
called Liber, because of the liberty of his tongue; but because he deliuereh
men's minds from the servitude of cares, and makes them more disposed and
forward to attempt any thing. Of the liberty which is sometimes allowed good
minds.
But as a moderation in using liberty, so a temperance in wine is commendable
and wholesome. It is supposed that Solon and Arcesilaus were good drinkers: and
Cato was taxed for drunkenness: but whosoever reprocheth him in this sort, shall
rather prove that this crime of drunkenness is an honest thing, then that Cato
behaved himself dishonestlie. But neither is it to be done often, le^t the
mind should contract some evil custom, although at sometimes a man ought to
give him liberty, and present some means of delight, and lay asid^ for a while
the over severe and sober manner of life. For if we give ^redite to the Greek
Poet. Its sometimes pleasure to be mad and foolish.
Or Plato, He that is in his right wits, loses his labor to go and knock
at the gate of the Muses, or Aristotle. There was never any great wit that had
not some spice of folly; if the mind be not stirred, and as it were mounted
above it self, he can speak nothing highly, nor above others. After he has
contemned vulgar and ordinary things, and that a holy heat has raised him
above ordinary, then begins he to sing with a mortal mouth, I know not what
that is more then humane. As long as he is in himself, he can attain to
nothing that is hie and difficult. He must desist from his usual custom, and
rowse himself, and bite the bridle betwixt his teeth, and bear away him that
governs him, The means how ^o make all these remedie^ effectual.
and carry him thither whether of himself he was affraide to ascend. Thou
have my Serenus these instructions that may conserve and restore the
tranquillity of the mind, and make head against those vices that daily steal
upon us, yet know thou that none of these are forcible enough for those that
slight them over, but it behooves the mind which is inclined to fall and err,
to be retained by an intentive and continual care.

The End of the Book of Tranquillity and repose of the Mind.
OF THE CONSTANCY OF A WISE MAN: OR, THAT A WISE MAN CANNOT FEEL ANY INIVRIE.
WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THis Book betokens a great mind, as great a wit, and much eloquence: in one
word it is one of his best. It was published (as I suppose) about the time of
the former Book which he wrote of Tranquillity, whereunto they annex this,
but improperly. The Argument is different, and thus handled. He begins with
the praise of the Stoickes, whose Paradox he debateth upon, That a wise man is
not affected with injury. What then? (said Serenus) Was not Cato touched with
contumelious strokes and spittings upon him? From this objection he enters
into the matter, and yet (says he) he was not affected with injuries. For he
was a wise man, and injury has no power over a wise man: which
notwithstanding (says he) is spoken in that sense, not that injuries are not
offered him, but that he admits them not. This worthily handles he until
the fourth Chapter. Then divides he that whereupon he is to debate into two
parts, by setting down the difference betwixt Injury and Contumely. Touching
the former, he denies that it is incident to a wise man; and as for the last
he admits it not. Of Injury these are his arguments. A wise man suffers
no evil, but injury is an evil thing: Secondly, Injury detracteth and
diminishes: but nothing is taken from a wise man, for he has all things
reposed in himself and that strongly, as Stilpo. The third. The stronger is
not harmed by the weaker: and therefore not virtue by malice. Hear it is
obected. But was not Socrates unjustly condemned? He was so, but without his
injuries. They proffered it him, he rejected them by wisdom. As for example,
thou give me venom, and I repress the force thereof by an A^idote: Thou
committest the crime, and I suffer. The fourth argument. Injury is mixed with
injustice, but this befalls not a wise man; Ergo, not the other. The fifth
argument. No man profits a wise man; Ergo, no man hurts him. The sixth.
Injury is either through hope or fear: but a wise man is touched with neither
of them. The seventh and last. No man receaueth injury that is not moved: A
wise man is not moved. And in this place is the conclusion of the first part,
and an exhortation to imprint this lesson in our minds. The other was of
Contumeli^, which he explicateth in the tenth Chapter what properly it is, and
then drives he it from a wise man. First, because a wise man knows his own
greatness, and therefoe Contumely appertains not unto him, which has both her
name and being from Contempt. Secondly, Proud and insolent men infer
Contumely; The wise man contemns such men, and therefore this vice is
condemned by them. Thirdly, No man contemns his superior or his better: but
such is the wise man. Therefore smileth he at those things that are spoken
against him as in banquets at childrens toys. But what? does a wise man endure
all these things? does he not correct and moderate them? yes he does it
sometimes, as men are wont to check their children, not because he has
received any injury, but because they have done it. And hitherto until the 14.
Chapter he argues against Contumely or injury only, now refuteth he them both
together. By this argument Security is proper to a wise man. It is not if
either he entertain or can admit any of them. The like the Epicures maintain,
though not so confidently. In conclusion, he advises us to reject diverse
flight and frivolous things, whereat the common sort are offended, and to laugh
at them least we be derided. His conclusion is how injuries are to be borne
either by him that seeks after wisdom, or him that has attained the same.
The one suffers it with some touch of mind, and with some resist also. The
other with both, and like a conqueror chaseth them before him, and triumphs
over them. I repeat it again; This Book was written by a man of great mind,
let us confirm our selves thereby in this so great malice both of times and
men.

CHAP. I.
He iusti^ieth the doctrine of the Stoickes, and discovers their ^^ri^htnesse
in an^mating men to virtue.
I May well say (my Serenus) there is as much difference betwixt the Stoickes
and other Philosophers, as between Females and Males, whereas both the one and
the other are equally assistant to the good of humane society; but the sects of
the Stoics is borne to command, and the other are made to obey. For other
Philosophers handle men's infirmities tenderly and flatteringly, as for the most
part domestical and familiar Physicians are wont to do their sick patients,
not healing them by the best and speediest means, but by feeding their humors.
The Stoickes entertaining a more constant course, they care not whether their
followers find the way pleasant or no, but labor to pull us presently out of
danger, and to conduct us to so high a place, which is so far raised above
any humane misery, that it ouer-looketh ^ortune. But the ways whereunto we
are called are high and rugged, for who ascends to an high place that keeps
the plain? yet is not the way so difficult as some men suppose. True it is,
the first entry over is stony, steepy, and seems inaccessible, as they that
behold from a far suppose, that the Country through which they travel, is
wholly of one level, and has neither path nor way, which proceeds from the
great distance that deceaueth their sight, but in drawing nearer and nearer,
these diverse ways which the error of our eye had confounded, seem by little
and little to be distinct, and that which happened a far off to be a steep,
proved afterward an ordinary path easy end to be mounted. The occasion of
the qu^stion.
When as of late we happened to discourse of Cato thou wast mightily displeased
(as thou art always impatient of iniquity) because so great a person as he
was was not so well known in his time, because (although he were far more
worthy then either Pompeys or Caesar's) they rancked him lower then the
Vatinians, and it seemed an unworthy matter in thy judgment, because that
dissuading the law they took from him his gown in the Market place, and drew
him from the place where the laws were published, as far as the Arc of
Fabius, by the hands of the seditious faction, and for that he endured the
cruel reproaches, shameful spittings, and other contumelies of the unbridled
multitude. To this I answer thee at that time, that thou had more occasion
to be moved in the behalf of the Commonweal, which Clodius on one side, and
Vatinius, and other wicked men on the other side set to sale, and being blinded
with covetousness saw not, that in selling their Country they likewise sold
themselves.

CHAP. II.
AS touching Cato I besought thee not to trouble thy self about him, The
resolution of the same in a word, the subject whereof which is Cato is compared
with Ulysses, and Hercules, wh^reat we are not to marvel, because the Stoickes
have taken Cato as the exemplary image of a wise man.
for I told thee that a wise man could neither be injured by words or deeds:
but that the immortal Gods had given us in Cato a more living example of a
wise man, then either Ulysses or Hercules in former ages. For these have our
Stoickes pronounced to be wise men invincible in labors, contemners of
pleasure, and conquerours in all Countries. Cato contended not with savage
beasts, which Huntsmen and Pesants are to prosecute and hunt; neither by fire
and sword subdued he^ monsters; neither lived he in those times wherein it was
thought that one man could carry the whole heaven on his shoulders, for these^
old fables are out of credit, and men in these days are better advised. But
he waging war against ambition, a monster of diverse forms, and with the
immesurable desire of rule (which the whole world being divided into three
parts could not satisfy) against the vices of a degenerate City, that sun^ke
under the weight of her own burden, stood alone and vph^ld the decaying
Commonweal, as much as one hand could then sustain, until such time as
being either ravished or torn from his Country, he accompained long time the
ruin that he had sustained, until such time that such things (which without
heinous crimes could not be separated) were extinguished together^ For neither
did Cato live after liberty was lost, neither liberty after Catoes death.
Think thou the people could in any sort injury this man, because they either
took from him the Praetorshippe or his Gown, or soyled his most sacred head
with the excrements of their mouths. A wise man is secure, neither can he be
touched with any injury or contumely.

CHAP. III.
ME thinks I see thy mind incensed, A reply to this resolution, grounded on the
Paradox of the Stoickes.
and boiling with anger, and thou art addressed to cry out; These are they
that lessen the authority of your precepts: you promise great things, and such
as neither may be wished, nor can be believed. Afterward, after so many
great words, and when you have denied that a Wiseman is poor, you confess
that oftentimes he has want of a servant, of clothing, of a house, and of
meat. Having denied that a Wiseman is a fool, you auow that he is sometimes
transported, and that he speaks some things improperly; in brief, that he
suffers himself to be distracted thither, whether the violence of his
passion carries him. You deny that a Wiseman is a slave, and yet confess that
he may be sold, that he will do that which is commanded him, and will
subject himself as a slave to all that service which his Master shall require
at his hands. Thus after you have braued a long time, you fall into the
condition of other men; and there is no difference between you but in change
of names. I suspect that there is I know not what like in that which you
propose, that a wiseman cannot be outraged either in deed or word. But if
these be different things; that i^, if you say, that a Wiseman cannot be
angry, or cannot be iniuried. For if you say that he endures the i^iurie
patiently, he has no privilege. He pertaketh only a common good, that is to
say, patience, which is learned by a custom of hearing, and bearing injuries.
If thou saeist that he cannot be outraged, that is to say, that no man will
attempt to do him injury: An answer to this reply.
I will give over all other affairs, and become a Stoicke. But my intent is
not to dignifie a Wise wan with an imaginary honor of words, but to lodge him
in such a place where no injury may attain unto him. What then? shall there
be no man that will attempt or provoke him? There is nothing so sacred in this
world, that meets not with some sacrilege. But the gods cease not to be
raised aloft, although there be some so wicked men that will assail a
greatness and majesty, so high placed that they cannot hurt or attain unto.
That thing is exempt from harm, not because it is not stricken, but because it
is not interessed. By this mark I will make thee know a Wise man. Doubtest
thou that an invincible force, although it be assailed, is no more assured,
then that force which is not provoked, considering that there is not any force
in those forces that are vnapproued, and that contrariwise the constancy which
despises all assaults, is justly held for the most certain? So know thou
that a Wiseman is more to be esteemed, because no injury can do him harm,
then if no man provoked him any ways. I will call him a valiant man that is
invincible in war, that is not astonished upon the enemies charge, who takes
no pleasure in fatting idleness, nor in the conversation of such as do
nothing. I say then that a Wiseman is not subject or exposed to any injury
whatsoever, neither cares he how many darts are shot against him, since he
knows that he cannot be pierced. Even as there are certain hard stones
which Iron cannot enter, and the Adamant will neither be cut, filed or bet to
powder, Diverse comparisons to fortify his answer.
but abateth the edge of these tools that are applied unto it: as there are
certain things which cannot be consumed by fire, but continue their hardness
and habitude amidst the flames; and even as the rocks that are fixed in the
heart of the sea break the waves, and although they have been assaulted, and
bet upon many infinite times, retain no impression of the storms that have
assailed them. even so the heart of a Wiseman is solid, and has gathered such
force that he is as secure from injury, as those I made mention of.

CHAP. IIII.
WHat then is there no man that will attempt to do injury to a Wise man? He
particularly describes the privileges of a Wiseman, and first that the
outrages th^^ are done vn^^ him, touch him not.
yes, he will attempt, but he shall not attain unto him; for he is so highly
raised above all the attaint^ of worldly things, that there is no violence
whatsoever, that can aim his attempts so hi^, be it your Princes and Monarkes,
who have so many engines and servants at their command, should enforce
themsel^es to hurt him. All their endeauours shall be frustrate before a Wise
man be offended, even as Arrows and Bullets that are shot into the air, mount
more hie then our sight, but they fall back again without touching heaven:
what do thou think that that foolish King when he had darkened the day
with the multitude of his arrows, could hit the sun with any one of them?
that c^sting his chains into the bottom of the sea, he could have touched or
enthralled Neptune. Even as celestial things are not subject to humane hands,
and they that ouerturne temples, and melt down Images, do no ways hurt the
Deity: The second, that although he is touched, yet endures he the evil.
so whatsoever is attempted either crabbedly, immodestly, or proudly against a
Wiseman, is done in vain. But it were the better if th^re were no man that
would attempt the same. Thou wishest the world a thing hard to come by, that is
to say, innocence. As touching those that do the evil, it were better for
them that they did it not, but in regard of him that endures the same; it is
no evil for him. I will say further, that I think tha^ wisdom discovers
the forces of his content, more where he is barked at and assailed, as
security is in an enemies Country, a great argument, of a worthy G^nerall, and
exercised Captain. But if thou pleas^st my S^r^nus^ l^^ us divide injury from
contumely. The former of these by nature is more tedious, the other more light
and distasteful, only to those that are delicate, whereby they are not hurt
but offended. Yet so great is the dissolution and vanity of men's minds, that
some men think there is nothing more displeasing and tart. So shall you find
a servant that had rather be scourged with whippes, then buffeted with
strokes, and that supposes that death and stripes are more tolerable then
contumelious words. The world is grown to that folly, that we are not only
vexed with sotrow, but with the opinion of sorrow also, as children are wont to
do who are affrighted with their shadows, with deformity of men, counterfeit
faces, and are provoked to tears, when they hear some name that they like
not, and start at the motion of our fingers and other things, which the
weakness of their judgment makes them redily condemn.

CHAP. V.
Injury has this intent to harm some man. But wisdom leaves no place for
evil: The third, ^e can neither suffer detriment in body or mind, or goods^,
and theref^re that ^e can no ways be injured.
for there is no evil for her but vice which cannot enter, there where virtue
and honesty dwell; and therefore injury does not affect a Wiseman: for if
injury be the sufferance of some evil; and a Wiseman cannot suffer evil;
there is no evil that appertains to a Wiseman. Every injury is a diminution
of him to whom it is offered, and no man may receive any injury without some
detriment either in honor, body or in goods, but a wise man can loose nothing:
he has all his good enclosed in himself; he no ways puts confidence in
fortune; he entirely possesses his riches, contenting himself with virtue,
which has no need of accidental things, and therefore may neither increase
nor decre^se: for having attained to the height, there is no place for
increase. Fortune takes away nothing but that which she has given; she
gives not virtue, and therefore cannot take it away; virtue is free
inviolable, immutable, assured, and so h^rdned against casualties, that she
neither may be shaken or overcome. She holds her eyes fixed against the
most dreadful objects in this world, she never changes her countenance,
whether they present her with prosperities, or tempt her with adversities. So
then a Wiseman loses nothing of that which he perceives is subject to
losse^ for he is in possession of virtue only, from whence he may never be
driven, and uses other goods as things that are borrowed. But what man is he
that is moved at the loss of that which is not his? but if injury can attempt
nothing which is proper to a Wise man, The image of virtue confirmed by a
succeeding and notable example.
because they are conserved by his virtue, therefore injury cannot be done
unto a Wis^man. Demetrius named Poliorcetes, that is a taker of Cities, having
brought in subjection the City of Megara, asked Stilpon the Philosopher if he
had lost any thing? No (says he) for I carry all my goods with me, and yet his
house had been ransackt, his daughters ravished, and his Country ruined: But
Stilpo got the victory over Demetrius, and although his City were taken, he
showed himself invincible, yea exempt from all damage, for he kept with him
the true goods which may well be laid hold on. But as touching those goods
that were pillage and taken from him, he judged them not his, but reputed them
to be casual, and such as followed the beck of fortune, and therefore settled
he not his heart upon them, as if they had been his own. For the possession
of all those things that abound externally, is slippery and unassured. Bethink
thy self now, whether either a thief, a backbitet, a dangerous neighbor, and
envious rich man, or some King broken with old age could do him injury, from
whom war, and that enemy, who professed a goodly Art, to subvert and shake
Cities, could take away nothing. Amidst so many naked weapons, amidst the
tumult of so many outraging soldiers; betwixt fire and blood, and the sack of
a City, surprised by assault, amidst the ruin of Temples falling upon the
Gods; one only man remained quiet and constant. Thou art not therefore to
think that I promised thee more then I can perform, for if thou will not
credit me, I will give thee sureties, for thou scarcely beleeuest that there
is so much constancy in a man, or that his mind may be so great, except he
press forth and tell thee,

CHAP. VI.
TO the end thou may know (says he) that a mortal man may raise himself
above all the accidents of this life, What pro^it^ we may reap by Stilpons
constancy and example.

The descr^ption of a ve^tuous man.


may regard with an assured eye the pains, losses, wounds and strokes, and
the hurliburly of infinite calamities that enuiron him, that he may endure
adversity, con^ent himself moderately in prosperity, without relying on this,
or grudging himself on that, but remaining always like himself in good and
evil fortune, not to esteem any thing his except it be himself, or in regard
of that part of himself which makes him virtuous: I am ready to prove this
unto thee, and to show thee that under this ouerturner of so many Cities, the
walls are beaten down by the violence of his Rams, the high Towers fall to
the ground by the means of his Mines, and if he rayseth his platformes as
high as the tallest towers, yet notwithstanding he cannot find out any engines
that may shake a heart that is well assured. I have crept out from under the
ruins of mine own house, I have past through fire, flame and sword, wherewith
I was environed on every side, I know not whether my daughters are more
courteously used then the rest of the City, I am old, and alone, The misery of
those that seek content in corruptible things.
seeing nothing but acts of hostility; on what side so ever I turn my self,
yet I maintain that all my goods remain in security, I auerre, that I have
all that whatsoever was mine before. Thou must not think Demetrius, that I am
overcome, or thou art victorious. Thy fortune has overcome mine: I know not
what is become of these my goods which are subject to loss, and change their
master. As touching my true goods, they are and shall be mine, and with me. The
rich have lost their riches, the voluptuous their lives and minions which they
had entertained with the hazard of their ho^our, the ambition^ neither haunt
the palace nor the marketplace as before, nor those retreats wherein they
made show of their vanities, the usurers have lost their bonds and books of
account, wherein avarice made drunk with the love of her self, imagines
commodities of all sorts. For mine own part I have all my goods in such sort,
as no man has either touched or spoiled them in any sort: Speak unto those
that weep, that lament, who to save their money, present their disarmed
bosoms to naked weapons, that fly with a heavy burden upon their backs
before the enemy. Resolve thy self therefore Serenus, that this perfect man,
full of virtues both divine and humane, loses nothing: his goods are
environed with solid and impregnable ramparts, whereunto thou would in some
sort compare the walls of Babylon, upon which Alexander mounted, nor the
fortresses of Carthage or Numantium, enforced by one only hand, nor the
Capitol or any place whatsoever, how strong and defenced so ever it may be.
The enemies either have or might set foot therein: but the fortresses that
defense the Wise man, cannot be surprised, neither fear they fire, they cannot
be entered or scaled, or vndermi^ed, they are impregnable like the nature of the
gods.

CHAP. VII.
SAy not therefore as thou art accustomed to do, that this our Wiseman is
found in no place, An excuse of that which he has proposed of a wise man's
virtue.
we paint not vain glory in a man's understanding, neither conceive we a
Colossus of counterfeit virtue, but such as we have confirmed and approved:
we both have and will present thee: happily such a one is rarely found, no not
in many ages; for these things that are great and exceed custom and vulgar
measure, are seldom engendered and brought to effect: but I believe that Cato,
for whose cause we entered into this dispu^e, exceeds by far the Wiseman
which is now in question. The ^ourth privilege, the virtuous cannot be injured
by the vicious, but virtue is more po^erfull then vice, and easily subdueth the
same.
To return to my purpose, that which offends ought to have more force then
that which is offended. But wickedness has not more force then virtue,
whereupon it follows that a Wiseman cannot be offended, good men cannot be
injured but by evil men, peace and friendship is entertained by good men:
Wicked men hurt virtuous men as much as they do one another, if no man can be
harmed, except he be more weak then he that harmeth him, and the evil men
be more weak then the good, and the good cannot be offended, but by those
that resemble them not, the wise man cannot be offended. For I am not now to
remember these, that no man is good but a wiseman. But (say thou) Socrates
was condemned unjustly, and received injury. In this place we ought to
observe, that it may so fall out, that some man may outrage me, and yet I
shall not be injured; as if a thief had stolen something out of my grange in
the Country, and locked it up in my house: he has robbed me, but I have lost
nothing^ A man may be guilty although he has committed no offense; if he live
with his own wife, imagining that he lay with an other man's, he shall be an
adulterer, although his wife shall not be an adulteress. Some one has given
me poyso^, but having intermixed it with my meat, it lost his force; in giving
me this he is guilty, although no evil ensue thereupon. He cease not to be
a murtherer^ who has thrust his sword at me, although I have put by the blow
by the benefit of my cloak. All wickednesses are accomplished in regard of
the offense before the mischief be acted. There ar^ certain things of that
condition, and so united, that the one cannot be without the other: that which
I say, I will endeavor to lay open; I can move my feet, and yet run not, I
cannot run except I move my feet: although I am in the water, I can chose
whether I will swim, and if I swim I cannot choose but be in the water: so is
it in this case that is in question, if I have been injured, it must needs be
that the injury has been done: but although the injury has been done, it
follows not consequently that I have received it: for many things may fall
out that may prevent the injury, even as the hand that is lifted up to strike,
may be prevented by some accidents: and arrows that are shot, may be avoided
in some sort, so may some things repulse and stay all injuries whatsoever, in
such sort as they shall neither be done nor received.

CHAP. VIII.
The fi^th, since a Wise man wa^teth nothing, he can receive (...) iniury^ for
his felicity is complete, a mere Stoicall Paradox^; ^he Christ^an expected a
greater complement.
FVrthermore, Justice cannot endure any injustice, for contrary things cannot
be united together: but an injury cannot be done but unjustly. It follows
therefore, that a man cannot do injury to a wise man; neither ought thou to
wonder that no man can do him injury, since there is not any man that can
bring him any profit: for a wise man wants nothing which he can receive in
way of gift, and an evil man can bestow, nothing on a wise man: for he must
have it before he give it; but he has nothing which a wiseman would be glad
he should bestow upon him. Therefore no man can either hurt or profit a wise
man. As the immortal gods neither desire to be aided, neither can be hurt; no
more also can a wise man, who is neighbor to the Gods, and like unto God, exept
in this that he is subject to death. Tending and walking toward those things
that are high, governed, assured, permanent, peaceable, impregnable, gracious,
and created for the good of all men; assisting himself and others, he will
covet no base things he bewaileth nothing because that in all accidents he
depends on reason, and marches with a divine thought. He cannot receive
injury by any means I say, not only in that respect, that he is a man no not
from fortune her self, which as often as she encountreth with virtue, never
retireth but to her disadvantage; if we entertain that great evil with a
willing and constant heart, in respect whereof the most rigorous laws of the
world can do nothing, and the most cruel tyrants can do nothing, wherein
fortune sees all her Empiry consumed. In brief, if we know that death is not
an evil thing, less cruel shall we deem an injury to be, more
courageously shall we endure all other evils, such as are less displeasures,
ignominies, banishments, the death of our parents and quarrels; for although
all these incommodities inuirona wise man, yer stifle they him not, nay more,
he grieueth not at any of their assaults. And if he patiently endure the
injuries of Fortune, how far more easily suffers he these of the rich and
mighty sort, who are but the instruments of fortune.

CHAP. IX.
HE therefore endures all these misfortunes as he would abide the rigor of
the winter, All injuries to a wise man are but as cold and heat, rain^ and
sickness.
raines, heates, and other accidents, neither judges he of any man so well,
that he imagines that he did any thing by counsel which is only incident to
a wise man. The rest do nothing with prudence. All their actions consist in
frauds, ambushes, and disordered motions, which the Wiseman ranketh amongst
casual things. But all that which is casual assaileth and enuironeth us
externally. Remember thy self likewise, that these things, by means whereof
men endeavor to hurt us, produce many occasions of offenses. As if a man should
wrongfully accuse us, or suborne some witness against us, or if they should
disgrace us in the presence of great men, or attempt such other accustomed
practices amongst men that have either leisure or credit. It is likewise an
other ordinary injury, if a man take that profit which an other man thought to
make, The seventh, (...) brideling in his pas^ions, judges of evil otherways
then passionate men do; and conuerteth all to good.
out of his hands, or a reward long deserved, or an inheritance recovered with
much travel, or the credit of a house wherein he had done faithful office^.
The wiseman neither lives in hope nor in fear, but disburtheneth himself of
these difficulties. Furthermore, no man is injured except he be moved, and he
is moved and troubled, as soon as he is touched: but an upright man is never
vexed, he brideleth in his extrauagant discourses, he enjoys a deep and
peaceable repose, and although an injury touch him, and move, and hinder him,
yet is he not attainted with choler, which grows from a pretended injury,
and the reason why he is not displeased, is, because he knows that a man
cannot wrong him. Thence proceeds it, that he walks always with an
upright countenance, a merry cheer, possessed with a continual joy, which in
such sort strengthens it self, that in stead of being abashed at those
injuries which men may offer him, and for those disa^ters that may happen in
life, he makes use of these difficulties, as means to know and make proof
of his virtue. Let us make profit I beseech you of this discourse, and let us
listen attentively both with heart and ear, how a Wise man behaueth himself
when he is outraged, although that for all this we are not so well advised, as
to cut off any thing of our wantonness, of our violent covetousness, nor of
our pride and arrogance. The Wiseman seeks this liberty without meddling with
your vices, neither is it a question here, whether it be lawful for you or no
to do injury; but how a Wiseman bears all injury, and continues firm,
patient, and confident in courage. In this sort have diverse borne away the
palm in combats and exercises, when by their invincible patience they had
wearied the hands of those that stroke at them. Suppose our Wiseman to be one
of those men, who by long and constant exercise have recovered the force to
endure and weary the force and assaults of their enemies.

CHAP. X.
SInce we have discoursed upon the first part, now let us descend unto the
second; The eighth, that all complaints of those that suppose themselves
injured, are so vild and unworthy, that it were a disgrace for a Wiseman to
think that he should be moved at such things.
in which, by some particular reasons, and by diverse common, we will confute
that opinion men have of contempt and contumely. Contumely is an injury so
small, as no man either complains or reuengeth himself, therefore neither do
the laws themselves prefixe any penalty thereunto. This passion is moved by a
certain baseness of the heart that is displeased, for some either dishonorable
deed or word. As for example. This Lord has not given me audience to day, yet
has admitted an other. He has carelessly turned his head aside when I spoke
unto him, or has mocked me before all men: In stead of placing me at the upper
end of the table, he has set me below. What shall I call these complaints (or
such like) but vomitings of a sick soul whereunto they are subject, who are
over delicate, and such as live too much at their ease; for I have no leisure
to note these in particulars, when as worse do follow. Our minds weakened and
made effeminate by too much repose, and become insolent for want of knowing
what true injury is, are moved at such things which (for the most part)
proceed from this, because he that either says or does them understands
not himself. By means whereof, the other that is moved and passionate,
pretending to be injured, shows himself to be a man both heartlesse and
witless. For undoubtedly he supposes himself to be contemned, and this
misprision of his proceeds from naught else but his base, vilde, and abject
courage. But a wise man is contemned by no man, he knows his own greatness,
he is resolved that no man (except himself) can attempt any thing to his
advantage or disadvantage. And as touching all these miseries (or rather
distractions of the mind) so far is he from not ouercomming them, that he
feels them not. There are other crosses likewise, although they overthrow him
not, as pains and weakness of body, loss of friends, and children, ruin of
Countries afflicted by war. I deny not but a wise man has some sense of
these evils, for we say not that he is hard and stupide, like a flint or as a
bar of Iron. There is no virtue that has not a sense of that which she
suffers.

The ninth. Although he feel the strokes he has a remedy at hand, whence
follows his cure which deserves not this name; considering that the hurt is
rather an imagination then any other thing, if we consider those who pretend to
do thee wrong.
CHAP. XI.
WHat is it then? I confess that a wiseman receives some stroks, but he
rebateth them, he heals them, and makes them without effect: as for these
that are less he feels them not, neither uses he his accustomed virtue,
constancy and patience, in respect of these, but either he marketh them not, or
thinks them worthy of derision. Besides, whereas the greater part of
contumelies are offered by proud and insolent men, and such as know not how to
carry their good fortune: the wise man has a means to despise that swollen
affection, which is the constancy and greatness of his mind, which is the
greatest of all virtues, the which passes swiftly above all these vanities, as
vain appearances of dreame^ and nightly visions, which have nothing solid or
true in them. He thinks likewise that all other men are so base, that they
have not sufficient courage to contemn that which is so highly raised above
them. Contumely is so called of contempt, because he that outrageth another
does it but in contempt. But no man contemns his better or him that is more
excellent then himself, although he say, or do some thing which contemners
are accustomed to do. For young children, strike their parents on the face, and
an infant has towsed and torn his mothers locks, and spit upon her, and
discovered such things in the sight of the servants which should have been
hidden, and has not abstained from dishonest and disorderly speeches, and yet
none of these do we call contumelies. And why? because they do it not in
contempt. The same is the cause why we bear with the vrbanity of our slaves,
and take delight to hear them jest at their masters, and after they have gibed
at them first, they have liberty to taunt others that are at the table, the
more contemptible and ridiculous a man is, the more liberty has he of his
tongne. There are some men that buy wanton children, and animate them in
impudency, and give them masters to teach them to scoff and bite at every man,
as if they had but recorded their lesson, neither call we these contumelies
but merry jests.

CHAP. XII.
But what folly is it now to be delighted, The tenth, He esteems the
injuries that are offered to him by the vicious a^ ^lightly as he would the
words of children, which know not what they say. A comparison betwixt young and
old fools of the world.
and straight again offended with the same things? and to call that a reproach
which is spoken by a friend; and a better jest that is uttered by a servant?
The same mind that we have toward children, the same has a wiseman toward
all men, who after their youth are become childishly old. Can a man term those
old men otherwise then infants, whose minds are depraved, and errors
increased, and who differ in nothing from children, but in the bulk of their
bodies, and outward forms, but are no less inconstant and uncertain, and
desirous of pleasure, without choice, fearful and quiet, not in mind, but for
fear? neither therefore will any man say, that there is a diffetence betwixt
them and children, because the one is covetous of checkestones, nuts and small
money, the other, of gold, silver and Cities. Children make Princes and Judges,
amongst themselves, counterfeit Senators, and with staves and pieces of wood
represent ridiculously the ensigns and marks of justice. These play the like
sports in good earnest in the field of Mars in the Market place, and in the
Senate. Children sitting by the rivers side, make them houses of sand. These a^
if busied about some great matter, are occupied in stones, in walls, and
building houses, and have made those things dangerous which were invented for
the conservation of our bodies. So then both the young and old are infants,
but the one are more advanced in beastliness, and more fools then the other.
And therefore upon good ground the wise man takes pleasure and pastime in the
outrages of th^se great Infants, and sometimes he chasticeth them as children,
not because he has received injury, but because they have done it, Why a wise
man sometimes chasticeth those that offend in deeds or words.
and to the end they should do it no more, for so are wild beasts tamed by
strokes, neither are we angry with them, because they cast their rider, but
we stroke them and che^ke them with the bit, to the end that by managing them
we may make them tame. Know therefore that this is answ^red which was opposed
against us, why a Wise man if he has neither received injury or contumely
punishes those that did the same: for he reuengeth not himself, but punishes
them.

CHAP. XIII.
But why is it that thou think not that the same infirmity of of mind
attends a Wiseman, In this place he answers some questious, and the first
is why the Wiseman suffers the insolency both of young and old.
when thou may observe the same in others, though not upon the same cause:
for what physician is angry with a lunatike person, who will interpret a sick
man's reproaches to the worst, that is vexed with a fever, and is forbidden to
drink cold water? The same affection has a Wiseman toward all men, as the
Physician has toward his sick Patients, who disdaineth not to handle their
priuities, if they have need of remedy, nor to see their vrines and
excrements, nor to hear the outrages which fear makes them to utter. The
wise man knows that all these which iet in their gowns, or are ap^arrelled
in purple, who, although they are well colored and fair, are sick and
diseased: whom in no other sort he looks upon but as intemperate sick men.
Therefore is he not angry with them, if during their sickness they have been
so bold as to speak injuriously against him who would heal them; and as he
sets light by all their honors, so tormenteth he himself as little with
their despite and insolences. Even as he takes little pleasure, if a beggar
do him honor, no more will he judge it a contumely, if the basest companion
return him not the like when he has saluted him; so will he neither wax
prouder, if many rich men do him honor; for he knows that they differ
nothing from beggars, nay that they are more wretched then the other, for the
one need little, the other much. And again, the wiseman will not be moved,
if saluting the King of Medes, or Attalus of Asia, he pass by him without
speaking, and with a disdainefull countenance, for he knows well that he
has as little cause to envy such a Princes state, as the condition of him that
in a great famine, has the charge to keep and ouersee the sick and mad men.
Shall I be angry if one of those who negociate in the market place near to
the Temple of Castor, or that make it their traffic to buy slaves, and who
have their shoppes filled with a troop of base slaves, saluteth me not by my
name, not as I think, for what goodness is there in him, under whom there are
none but evil men. Therefore as he will neglect this man's humanity, or
inhumanity; so will he do a Kings. Thou have under thy gouernements, both
Parthians, Medes and Bactrians, but such as thou containest by fear; neither
dare thou lay by thy bow, by reason of them who do nothing in regard of
thee, whom thou must handle as slaves, but such as desire likewise to be rid
of thee, and seek for a new Lord. So then a wise man is not offended at any
man's injury, and although that one is not of the same reckoning as others, yet
he esteems them alike, because they are no less fools the one as the
other: now if but once he embase himself, so far as either he be moved
with injury or contumely, he can never be secure, but security is the proper
good of a wise man; neither will he endure that by revenging the contumely
that is offered him, he honor him that did the same: for it must needs be,
that he whosoever is displeased for an injury that is done him, will likewise
be glad to be honored at his hands.

CHAP. XIIII.
THere are some men that are possessed with so great madness, The second,
whence it comes that he confesses readily the faults both of the one and
the other.
that they think that a woman can offer them outrage, what matters it how rich
she be, how many vassals she have to carry her letters; what though her ears
are laden with pendants, and her chains be large and spacious; yet all of them
alike are impudent creatures, and except she be endowed with much science and
learning, she will be cruel and incontinent in her desires. There are some
are much vexed, because they have been repressed by some Ladies Groom, that
helps to make her ready, and call it contumely, if a Porter be ou^r currish,
at the pride of the Clerk of Check, and the loftiness of a groom of the
Chamber. O how much are we to laugh at these toys? with how great pleasure is
the mind to be filled, when a man beholds his own quiet amidst the tumult
of other men's errors? what therefore? shall not a wise man be bold to approach
the gate where there is a crabbed and froward Porter? if any affairs of
importance shall command him, he shall attempt and appease the Porter
whatsoever he be, in giving him some present, as we are wont to give bread or
meat to a dog that barketh; in brief, he will not disdain to disburse some
thing to enter, remembering himself that there are certain bridges which a man
cannot pass over without paying towle; and therefore he gives some money to
this Towle-man or that Porter, for he knows how to buy that which is to
sell, contrariwise that man has a base mind that boasts that he has spoken
freely to a Groom of the Chamber, that he has broken his staff, that he
has gotten access to his Master, and caused the Varlet to be beaten. He that
contendeth makes himself an adverse party, and vaunting that he has
overcome, makes himself equal: but what shall a wise man do if he be
buffeted? that which Cato did at such time as an enemy of his gave him a box
on the ear, he entered not into choler, neither revenged he that insolency.
True it is that he pardoned not the injury, but he denied that he had
received it: he showed himself more courageous in protesting that he was not
moved, then if he had pardoned him that struck him. We will stay no longer on
this point: for who knows not that in matter of these things which a man
supposes either good or evil, a Wise man's opinion is different from all other
men, he respects not what they repute either villainous or miserable, he
follows not the common tract, but as the stars are retrograde in their
courses, so carries he himself in a fashion which is contrary to all others.

CHAP. XV.
CEase therefore to demand whether a wise man shall be outraged, if he be
stricken, The fourth, what is the reason why a wise man is so patient,
if his eye be pulled out, if base fellows exclaim against him in the open
street; if at a Princes banquet he be placed at the lower end, and set to eat
amongst the grooms, if he be constrained to endure all the indignities and
despightes that may be done to a man of honor. These insolences either great
or little, shall appear unto him of one nature: if the smaller touch him not,
no more shall the greater, if a little move him not, a great deal shall not
stir him. But you measure a great mind according to the extent of your own
weakness, and considering only how far your patience does extend; you
think you do very much, if you allow a wiseman some further term and limit
of patience then you allow your own. But his wisdom has placed him in other
confines of the world, that have nothing common with you. Therefore if crosses,
incommodities, and adversities, which both the eye and ear abhor, present
themselves on every side, and in great number: he shall not be dismayed thereat,
and as he crosses every one of them, so shall he make head against all
together: he deceives himself, that a Wise man may support one thing and not
another, and who will cloase his magnanimity in certain bounds, except we
manacle and tie fortunes feet and hands, she will tread us under foot;
neither think thou that this is only a Stoicall austeritie; for the Epicure
whom you have made choice of for a pattern of your idleness, and whom you
suppose to be the Master of delights, idleness, and mere pastime, says that
fortune seldom times visits a Wise man. How nearly uttered he a manly speech;
Will thou speak more bravely, and wholly drive away fortune? Consider that a
Wisemans house is narrow, without pomp, without noice, without decking without
Porters who give or refuse entry to goers out or in; but although the gate be
not kept by any man, yet fortune sets no foot therein; knowing well that
she shall not be entertained there where she has no credit at all, but if
the Epicure himself who has given his body all the pleasures that he can
imagine, disgesteth injuries: is there any occasion to think it incredible,
extraordinary, and above nature, which the Stoickes pretend. The Epicure says,
that a Wise man ought to endure injuries, but we say that a Wise man cannot be
injured.

CHAP. XVI.
To manifest that which is past, ^hee shows what he in^^ndeth by the word
injury.
NEither have thou cause to conclude that this repugneth against Nature. We do
not deny but that it is an incommodious thing to be beaten, to be enforced and
to be maimed in some member; but we deny that these are iniurie^. We take not
from them the sense of pain, but the name of injury which cannot be admitted
without empeachment of virtues reputation. Let us consider which of these two
opinions are to be admitted. Both of them concent in the contempt of injury.
Ask thou me wherein they differ? Such there is as between two stout sword
players whereof the one dissembleth his wound and stands on his guard; the
other, looking back at the people that cry out makes show that it is
nothing, and will not endure to have them parted. You must not therefore think
that the difference is over great. But there is an other point that properly
concerns us. These two examples teach us to contemn injuries and outrages,
the which I call shadows and suspicions of injury to contemn which we ought
not, to seek out a wise man, we need but a well advised man that may speak
thus unto himself; whether do those things befall me deservedly or
undeservedly; if deservedly, it is no contumely, it is but a correction; if
undeservedly, How a man ought to interpret^ those things that are spoken by an
other.
let him be ashamed, that deals unjustly; and what is that which is called
contumely? He iesteth at me, because I shake my head, because I have weak
eyes, because I have little legs, and am of a low stature. Is this an
outrage, if a man tell me tha^ which every man sees? we laugh at any thing
that is spoken in the presence of one; we are angry, if it be before many;
and we leave not then men liberty to speak that which we our selves will say
our selves: we are d^lighted with temporate jests, and are displeased at those
that are immoderate.

CHAP. XVII.
CHrysippus says, How vainly we fly from the precepts o^ the wise^ and are
besotted on trifles, and ^aine injuries in our own imaginations.
that a certain man was much displeased because an other man called him
sheepes-head. We saw Fidus Cornelius Na^oes son in law stand weeping in the
Senate house, because Corbul^ had called him pilde Austrich. Against other
reproaches wounding both his manners and life, he carried always a ^etl^d
countenance; but upon this so impertinent a jest, he could not abstain from
teare^; so great is the infirmity of our minds when reason is absent: for
example, we are offended, if any man counterfeit our speech, our gate, or any
imperfection either in our body, or in our tongue: as if they should wax more
notorious by an other man's imitation, then our own action. There are some that
cannot endure to be called old, gray head, or other such names, whereunto
many are desirous to attain. Othersome have been displeased, if they have
been called poor; but he truly calls himself poor that concealeth his
poverty. The true means to cut off all those scoffers and i^sters is, if thou
thy self prevent them, and object against thy self, all that which they
could speak against thee. Whosoever laugheth at himself, first cutteth off
other men's ocations to laugh at him. It is said that Vatinius who was a man
borne to be laughed at, and hated was of himself a pleasant and talkatiue
Companion. This man iested much at his own gouty feet, and his swollen chaps;
so escaped he the derision of his enemies, and especially the bitter jests of
Cicero, who were in number far more then the sickenesses that had seized him:
if Vatinius a shameless fellow could do this, by means of his bitter
speeches, who had learned impudence by his continual jesting, why cannot he
do it, who by honest occupations of the mind, and exercises of wisdom, has
attained to virtue? Add hereunto, that it is a kind of pleasure to pull from
an outrageous man the pleasures which he takes in speaking or doing evil.
These men are accustomed to say; Wretch that I am, I think he understood not?
so is the fruit of contumely in the sense and indignation of him that
suffers. Moreover, he will one day be met withal, and some one will light
upon him that shall revenge thine injury.

CHAP. XVIII.
AMongst all other vices, The end of inconsiderate mockers, they see a mote in
their neighbour^ eye^ but will not spy a beam in their own.
wherewith Caius Caligula was replenished, it is reported of him that he was a
great mocker, who daily had a fling at other men's faults, where himself was a
bountiful subject of laughter: For his countenance was pale and de^ormed,
betokening his melancholy fury, his eyes sunk and buried under his old and
beetle brows, his head bare in diverse places, a tuft of curlde and thick
hair about his neck, his legs small, his feet plat and vnmeasurably broad:
but I should never make an end, if I should specify every particular, wherein
he reproached his fathers and grandfathers, and in general all sorts of men. I
will only relate those which were the cause of his destruction. Amongst his
especial friends, was Valerius Asiaticus, a man of a fierce mind, who could
scarsly digest those contumelies that were offered to a stranger. To this man
did he object at a banquet, and afterward with a loud voice in an open
assembly, the motions and fashions of his wife, at such time as he accompanied
and lay with her. Good gods that the husband should hear this, and the Prince
should know it, and that liberty of speech was so unbridled, that he should
discover, (I say not to one that had been Consul, I say not to his friend,
but) to her own husband the adulteries of his wife, and how his lusts were
satisfied. Chaereas the Tribune of his Soldiers had no ready speech, See
Suetonius and Liuie; in the life of Caligula.
and had^t thou not known him by his deeds, thou would have suspected him
to be an effeminate fellow. To this man when he came to fetch the watch word
at Caius hands, he sometimes gave him the name of Venus, sometimes of Priapus,
reproaching in one or other sort this warlike man, who made profession of
arms, that he was effeminate, and that it was he to whom the name appertained
to be painted, socked and decked with bracelets: he therefore enforced him to
use his weapon, lest he should be often enforced to fetch his Watchword from
him: he was the first amongst the conspirators that lifted up his hand; he it
was that cut his neck half off at one stroke; and afterward he received
diverse other stabs and strokes at their hands, who revenged their public or
private injuries: but he whom Caligula least suspected, was the first that
showed himself a man, and yet the same Caius who took all thinge^ for
injuries and outrages, could himself endure nothing, though here most desirous
to offer all: he was angry with Herenius Macro, because he had saluted him by
the name of Caius; and he caused a Centurion of the first Legion to be
severely punished, because he named him Caligula; yet was he usually so
called, because he was borne in the Camp, and was wont to be called the
infant of the Legions: in brief, the Soldiers knew him not by any name so
well, as by that: notwithstanding in the end he took this word for a reproach
and outrage: Imply that the true revenge belonge^h to God, and patience by his
example to a wise man.
let this therefore be for our comfort, that although our frailety omitteth
revenge, yet will there be some one who will revenge us on an audacious, proud
and injurious enemy; which vices are never consumated in one man, or in one
contumely: Let us consider their examples, whose patience we praise, as that
of Socrates, who took in good part the taunts and reproves which the Poets
and Players published against him, and laughed no less then when his wife
Zantippe powered foul water on his head: but Iphicr^tes being reproved because
his mother was a Barbarian, and a Thracian, answered, that the mother of the
gods was borne on the mount of Ida.

CHAP. XIX.
To avoid strife, is a remedy against trouble, and there is no better wisdom
then to be prepared and constant against all incumbrance^.
We are not to f^ll to brawles or debates hereupon, let us return our selves
far from these, and neglect those errors which the imprudenter sort commit:
for none but imprudent men will commit the same: both honors and public
injuries are to be esteemed alike, neither let us grieve at the one, or rejoice
at the other: otherwise we shall omit many necessary things through the
apprehension or distaste of contumelies; neither shall we execute either
public or private offices, no not these that are most necessary, whilst
effeminate ear troubles us, for fear we should hear something against our
minds, and sometimes being displeased with mighty men by our int^mperate
liberty, we should discover this affection: but it is no liberty to suffer
nothing; we are deceived: this is liberty, when we oppose a resolute mind
against injuries; when a man ge^teth a habitude that breadeth all pleasure,
estranging from himself those things which are without us, for fear, lest
being afraid of the laughters and disgraces of the world, we drown not our
life in a continual disquiet: for what man is he that cannot injury an other,
if every man may: but a Wiseman and he that is a follower of wisdom will use
an other remedy: for to those that are imperfect, and who as yet conform
themselves to the judgment of the people, we ought to propose that they are
to live amongst injuries and outrages: All things are light unto those that
exspect them: the more greater a man is, the more generous, renowned and rich,
the more ought he to show himself confident and courageous, not forgetting
this, that the brauest Soldiers are set in the foremost ranks; let him endure
opprobrious words, ignominies and other disgraces as the cries of his enemies,
as arrows shot from a far, and stones that rattle about the Helmet, without
wounding; and let him sustain injuries, neither dejected nor moved from this
place, as strokes inflicted on his armor, or infixed in his breast: although
thou be oppressed, and the enemy press thee nearly. It is a base thing to
give place, maintain that place which nature has assigned thee: Ask thou
me what this place is? that of a man's. The Wiseman has an expedient contrary
thereunto: for you are in the conflict, he has gotten the victory: resist not
your own good, and till such time as you have attained the truth, nourish this
hope in your hearts; assure your selves boldly of some better thing, press
forward to attain it with hope and honest desire; it is for the profit and
advantage of the whole world, that there is some one invincible, that there is
some one, over whom fortune has no power.

The End of the Book of the Constancy of a wise man.
OF THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO PAVLINVS.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THe time wherein this Book was written is uncertain (except it were after
CAIUS government;) but for the goodness thereof it is not to be doubted. O
subject of an excellent and profitable Argument. The Argument is, that our Life
is not short, but that we make it short, either by not using it, or by abusing
it, or vainly using it: this deduceth he thus: First, we are bond^laues to
vices, wherein we consume and loose our years: Secondly, we are unprofitably
busied in triuiall matters, and such as we call offices: Thirdly, we sin
either in opinion or presumption, and this makes that life short which we
think to be long; we despise things present, we dispose the future, as though
we had them in great and assured abundance: and for the most part we are
entangled with vain or foreign pleasures, and loose our lives as it were in
sport: such as this until the tenth Chapter; thence divides he time into
three parts, into that which is past, into the present, and into the future,
and teaches us how euilly and foolishly we behave our selves in every one of
them: he inueigheth against fruitless occupations, against delights, against
excess, against idle retirements, and superfluous study of knowledge. Hence he
discourses pertinently; and would to God he might either allure or change the
learning lovers of this time. That only that time is well spent, which is
employed in the study of wisdom, whereby our life is truly lengthned: the
common sort think otherwise, for they estimate the same by fortune, and
according to her smiles, so think they that our life is shortened or lengthned:
In prosperity they wish for death, in adversity they fear it. In the end he
exhorts PAVLINVS, and what he says to him, let every man apply to himself,
and grow maturely wise, and retire himself into the haven of life, which is an
honest repose. This vow I, thus will I endeavor.

CHAP. I.
THe greater part of men (good friend Paulinus) complains of the hard dealing
of nature with us, who has brought us forth to live so short a while, and yet
of the time allotted us, that the moments should so suddenly and swiftly run
away, as we see they do: insomuch as besides some few amongst us, the rest
are then most commonly bereft of life, when indeed they begin but newly even
then to live; nor does the populous or foolish people only lament this evil
(so general as it is counted) but even many famous men have likewise thought
and lamented in like manner this our misfortune; whence springs that
especial complaint of the greatest amongst Physicians, that our life is short,
and their art very long: where hence also Aristotle takes occasion to quarrel;
(although it scarce beseem so wise a man as he so to do) with dame Nature,
who (says he) has allotted some beasts, some five, some ten hundred years,
and man who is created to so many weighty purposes, has a term of life
prefixed him so much shorter as we see: whereas indeed we have no scantnesse
or scarsity of life, but we rather loose much of our life; for long enough and
large enough is life allowed us, were it spent in greatest matters, or were it
all spent in good matters; but when we have by riot and negligence once lost
it, when it is once spent and gone, and we cannot show any good we spent it
in, at length need driving us to make an end thereof; we see that now it is
spent, which we did not feel to spend, before in deed it was very well nigh
wholly spent: so that we had not given us so short a life, as we will make it,
but such we made it as it is; nor had we given us so little life, but so
prodigal and lavish we are. Even as a Princes ample Patrimony, if it come in
Hucksters hands, goes away in a moment, which if it were the hundredth part
thereof, and were well husbanded, would yet by good usage, increase rather then
prove but scarce, even so our age if it be well employed, will prove very
fair and long enough.

CHAP. II.
WHy then complain we of nature, she has dealt well with us, and thy life,
if thou know how in good things well to spend it, shall appear long enough.
One is wholly possessed with ^^satiable avarice, another is as busy as a Be
in labors, every ^^^ n^^^lesse and superfluous: a third drinks out his days,
a fourth is idle, a fifth lives gaping after preferments, which yet are in the
will of another to bestow; a sixth, is led even round about the world, by a
desire to buy and sell, with hope to gain; and some there are that continually
have their minds on warrefarre, never minding either the perils of other men,
or regarding their own, as some there are also that wilfully enthrall
themselves to such Potentates, as scarsly ever give them any thanks for so
doing, but delight yet in their folly, many likewise spend their days in
affecting others fortune, and detesting of their own; and diverse men do
nothing but delight themselves with changeable, unconstant, never pleasing
fantasies, still attempting new devices, as also some like nothing, wherein to
spend their time, but consuming in their idleness, do nothing but still
accuse their fate and fortune: so that true I find the best saying which the
Poet ever writ by him as an Oracle: A little part of our life it is we live;
for indeed the whole course of man's age, is not life but time rather, in which
almost howerly new vices so assail us, as we neither can recover our selves,
nor so much as lift our eyes to see what is decent and truth in things we
think of, but if once we begin to take footing, new desires anew assail
us, and keep us down: no, they cannot so much as recall themselves to mind,
but if happily they be quiet, yet as in the sea after a storm is fully passed,
yet remains there a wallowing, and continual rolling, so beat they still up
and down, nor have they perfect rest from their desires. And here perhaps ye
think I speak of such men only, whose fancies all men gaze at, and talk of
too, but look on them, whose felicity all men most marvel at, and you shall
see, that even these men are cloyed with their good fortune: of which sort many
account wealth a burden, many having also a goodly gift of eloquence and
utterance, spend themselves in delight to hear themselves speak: and many
wear away, even surfeiting with self pleasing delights and pleasures: and how
many I pray you know you that have scarce any time almost to breath for
continual suitors to them? go but over them all from the lowest to the
highest, he sues, he helps, he is in danger, he defends him, and another
judges him; every one, to be short, spendes himself upon others: and enquire
of these men's living, whose names and persons all the world talks of and
knows, and you shall see them distinguished by these particulars: he is
wholly at the devotion of such a one, another altogether depends of him: and
none of them all is his own man, or intends his own business. And here I
find a fond complaint made by some men, they mislike forsooth the coins of
their superiors, who are not often at leisure, when they would sue or do their
duties to them; and dares any man complain of the pride of another, who
himself is never at leisure to be sued of himself? The great man be he never
so proud, yet sometimes at the length he gives the access; he gives the
audience at some time, he calls thee at last, and thou can vouchsafe to look
into, nor give hearing to thy self.

CHAP. III.
NOr think thou any man any whit beholding to thee for these thy courtesies,
for in doing them thou did not mean so much to save another, as thou wast
not willing, or at leisure rather to save thy self: and if all the wits that
ever were renowned for any thing would intend this one point; yet can they not
all of them sufficiently wonder at the blindness of man's mind in this one false
joy folly: We suffer not our lands to be usurped of another, and be the
controversy about never so little a quantity, or circumstance of our
possessions, we take up stones, and betake us straightwayes to armor, and yet
we suffer other to usurp of our life, yea we put such in possession, as are
like to be Lords and Rulers of it: ye see no man willing to part with his
money, but with good conditions to another; and yet with how many I pray you
do we all part stakes, and make diuidents of our life, even many times for
nothing? every one is a niggard to part with his Patrimony, and yet most lavish
be we when we come to loss of time, wherein only a may honestly show
himself a nipcrust. And therefore let us here a while talk with any one of
all these Elders^ we see you are as old, as a man almost may be, you are
onwards on a hundred years, or rather more then so, do but call your years to
a reckoning, and say in sadness, how much time your creditors, your she
friends, the City matters and other suitors to you have spent thereof? your
suites about wiuing, breaking your head to frame your servant; your desire to
pleasure friends in every corner of the town: how much pain have these things
put you to? then add what sickness your self have been procurer of, as also
what time hasty and unadvised anger has possessed you, even in things frivolous;
yea what time has past you to no fruit nor purpose, and you shall see you have
not lived so many years as you make reckoning of: call to mind when you were
resolute what to do in any thing, and how many days you ever passed as you
determined, then what fruit you reaped of days so spent? what have you now to
show as the fruit thereof? nay, how many have stolen pieces of your life,
whilst your self did not consider or perceive the want thereof, how much of it
have false joys, needless griefs, greedy, covetous, pleasant company misspent
I pray you? and then count how little of your own life is left to your self,
and you shall find you die before you are ready to depart the world.

CHAP. IIII.
WHat is then the reason forsooth you live, as if you had a warrant to live for
ever? you recke not how little time you live to your self? you count not how
much time you spend, while you spend as it were of a full and over running
reckoning; when as happily that same day spent in another man's pleasure, or to
his use, may chance be to your last; you fear all things as men mortal, yet
you long for all things as immortal. You shall hear some men say, were I
fifty, I would betake me to my beads, were I threescore, I would meddle no
more with worldly matters? yet they have at all no warrant of longer life then
the present moment: for who can give the assurance that thou shall do, eue^
just as thou determinest? shamest thou not to make reckoning how to lead thy
life to come, and to point such time for amendment, which almost can serve for
nothing? how late is it to begin to live then when thou must leave to live?
or how fond forgetfulness of mortality is it to delay amendment to thy
fiftieth year of age, and to make account that then thou will begin to live,
when few men use to aspire to such an age. Ye shall often hear great mighty
men give out speeches in praise of rest, of leisure, and quietness, they wished
it, they prefer it before all their wealth; yea they wish they might with
safety come down from that high tipe of their authority, and intend the same;
for be all things never in such quiet from abroad, yet fortune falls even in
it self, and decays as all other things in this mortality.

CHAP. V.
GReat Augustus whom the Gods did more for then ever else for any man, ceased
not to pray for rest and exemption out of common causes; all his speech still
came to this end, if he once might come to quietness, yea all his labors he
did sauce with this false but pleasant comfort, he would one day surely live
to himself, and in one Epistle which he wrote unto the Senate, (wherein he
protested that his rest and quiet private life should do him more good and
credit also, then his life already led in renown and glory) I find these
words inserted. But I know it were more credit for me so to do, then to say
so; howbeit such desire I have thereto, as because I cannot in deed perform
it, some pleasure yet I thought to reap, by talking only of so pleasant a
matter. So great a thing was rest in his conceit, as the same because he could
not indeed attain unto; yet in word he thought to joy in it, and he that saw
even all things depend of him, being able indeed to make happy or in^ortunate
whomsoever, or whenever he pleased, took great pleasure to remember the day
and time, when he should do of his own greatness, and become his own man:
he had tried what sweat and swincke his estate (which all men deemed to be so
good and glittering, did cost him to maintain it: and how much privy
hartburning, and heart aching to it, daily harbored, being forced to make war
first with the Citizens of Rome, then with his fellow officers, lastly with his
kindred, shedding blood by sea and land in Macedonia, Sicilia, Egypt, Siria
and Asia, coursed almost throughout all Countries, yea and when he had thus
glutted himself in a manner with Roman slaughter, he was forced to turn
himself against foreign nations: And being likely to quiet some troubles in
the Alps, having vanquished other enemies that disturbed this his peaceable
and settled Empire, while he set forward to enlarge the same beyond Rhenus,
Euphrates and Danubius, at home even in the City, Murena, Cepio, Lepidus, and
the Egn^tij^ prepared arms against him: yea, and having sca^sly fully escaped
these their attempts, his daughter Iulia, and many noble young gentlemen (knit
in league by reason of their too much familiarity with that loose lewd Lady)
began to be terrible unto the Father, who in their opinion lived somewhat
too long: after whom also ^uluia caused her husband Anthony to take weapon
against him, no history shows why. All which sores when he had cut away,
with the parties also in which they were, yet s^ill there rose new, not unlike
a body too full of humors, whereof always some one part or other breaks out
continually into a sickness: wherefore he wished to live in rest, the only
hope and thought whereof, was the only ease of all his labors, and this one
thing was the daily prayer and desire of him, who was able otherwise to make
every man master of his desires beside himself. Marcus Cicero long time tossed
up and down between Catiline and Clodius, betwixt Pompey and Crassus, who
were his open enemies, the rest his doubtful and uncertain friends, whilst
he wrestled with the common wealth, and labored to hold it up, that now was
running more and more to ruin, was at length ouerborne and forced to yield to
the burden of it, being neither quiet in prosperity, nor patient in the
contrary: this M. Cicero, how often not without cause also does he detest that
his office borne as Consul, which till then at first, he never ceased to
commend without end, which in truth he did not without cause extol, when he
spoke most of it. What doleful speeches f^l^e^ he into in one Epistle to
Atticus, upon the news that Pompey the father was vanq^ished, when his son
the younger Pompey ren^ed his fathers quailed quarrel in the parts of Spain?
Ask you, quoth he, what I make here, I keep my self to my Tuscul^ne, now at
length half become mine own man: adding also other things in the foresaid
letter, wherein both he bewaileth his time forespent, he complains of the
present, and despaireth of any good in the time to come: he calls himself
now half his own, where in truth no Wise man ever could use so base and
slavish a term, who will never be so little as half his own, but always
will be whole his own, his own entire, fr^e from others beck and boorde, his
own to use with little reckoning, what others account thereof; for what needs
he regard what others say, who treads fortune under foot, as every wise man
either does or should do.

CHAP. VI.
LIuius Dr^sus, one of the ancestors of Liuia, Augustus his Empress, a hot
spirited, and a very vehement fiery humord man, having put new common wealths
in the peoples head, and stirde a new the old tumults of the two brethren, the
Gracchi being manned almost with all the power that Italy could make, having
not yet well weighed the end of things, which now he could not accomplish to
his desire; nor had he yet the liberty to leave in the midst, he fell in
detestation of his own unquiet state from the day of his birth till then, and
is said to have uttered these very words: I am only he I think that never yet
had leave to play, no not when I was a boy: for indeed being under age, and
coming but as children did into the Senate with his father, he presumed to
speak to judge in the behalf of diverse men, and laid his credit on the
matter in so vehement a sort, that it was said, many judgments were given
wholly as it pleased him. Whether would not so young an aspiring humor, if it
had continued, for well a man may conjecture, so soon ripe a stirring head
must needs grow in time to the great hurt, public or private, some where or
other, and therefore too too late he made complaint, he had never yet leave to
play, who was of a child so troublous, and importunate to the State where he
lived, as he was. Some make question if he did not kill himself or no: for a
wound he had in his groine, which was his death: what time though some men
doubted, whether he had slain himself or no, yet all men thought it high time
for him so to be dispatched. It were needelesse here to reckon more of this
same humor, who being in the eye of other men most fortunate and h^ppy,
notwithstanding gave true testimony against themselves, in great hatred and
mislike of all that ever they had done; but with these complaints of theirs,
they did neither alter others, nor amend themselves: for the words sometime
brake from them, to the sense I have said: yet their desires kept on the old
unconstant course, and were no changelings, which sort of life assuredly might
it possibly continue a thousand year or more, yet will it seem in the end to
have been but very small, and of no continuance, and all these seu^rall
conceits, what age or great account of time wll they not consume? Surely these
few years allotted us, albeit nature think them long, and reason amplify the
course of them, yet must it needs seem quickly gone, for we take no hold of
them, we stay them not, nor lay we hands on them, being things more quick in
riddance then any thing else in all the world: yea, we suffer them to pass, as
if they were scarce worth the ^ooking after, or else were easy to be
recovered; so that in conclusion, all men do confess, the busied man can
never do any thing well: he cannot learn to live to himself, nor to be freed
from the unprofitable cares of this world; for his mind being in a manner, as
we see it is, possessed with such unprofitable labors, it is not apt for any
good thing, but despises it, as the stomach does mislike with meat that is
already ouerladen. And yet better can he learn any other thing almost in all
the world, then intend to learn to li^e; which is almost the hardest knowledge
that you can devise.

CHAP. VII.
OTher Arts have their professors enough in every corner; which arts some
boys have learned so perfectly and well, as they could teach them for a need.
To live a man must learn even all his life long: and that which happily you
will rather wonder at, all our life we may learn in the end how to die. And of
so many great men as despised all lets and stops, despising riches, Offices and
all voluptuousnes, doing nothing all their life long, but learning still to
live; yet diverse were there amongst them, that departed this mortality,
confessing they had not then as yet come to the knowledge: so far off are
these our busy brains from attayning thereunto. So that trust me, very wise is
he, and a man above the common case and capacity of men he must needs be
assuredly, that spends amiss no jot of all his days; and therefore longest is
his life, who spends all his life, be it much or be it little, in his own
affairs, and has neither misspent with folly, nor lost by idleness any
hour thereof, and much less has intended any other men or matters, then
himself and his, deeming nothing in this world worth exchanging of his leisure
for it; which his leisure he did spare as a thing most precious. And to this
man I say his life was long enough, whereas on the contrary part, those men may
well complain of scarcity, who spend much time in matters popular, to their
fruit none at all, or very little, and yet they understand not their own loss.
Oftentimes you shall hear great men (whom good fortune is a burden to) midsert
their route of suitors, causes, actions and other miseries (which great port
makes notwithstanding to seem felicities) cry o^t, I cannot be suffered to
live to my self? All these men that seek thy help to do them pleasure, draw
thee from thy self. That defendant, how many days did he bereave thee off?
and how many days that other standing to be Consul; as also that old
Gentlewoman, who has troubled thee with the proouing so many of her husbands
Wills? As also that old Gentleman, whom thou visitest in his sickness, which
he does yet but counterfeit, to set greedy minds on edge, to long for that he
leaves: and that great friends of thine, who yet reckes not otherwise of such
friends as thou art, then only to be credited by thy courting and attending
him. And having cast thy days in this manner of account, see how few days and
how foolish a remainder of them comes to thy share. He that now has got the
Office he was long a suitor for, is by and by contented to be rid of it, and
says, Oh when will this geere come to an end? Another sues to the Senate, that
he may be at cost to provide Plays for the people, and was wondrous joyful
then when leave was given him, then so to spend his money; and yet shortly
after he cries, Oh when shall I be rid of them? A third, whom every Clyent
seeks to retain in counsel, who fills the bar when he comes, and leaves
every Court empty at his return, says, Oh when will this term be at an end?
Thus every man sets life at naught, whiles he desires things future, and is
glutted with the present; but he that turns every moment to some good
purpose, that disposes of eueryday, as he would of all his life, this man does
neither fear nor wish for to morrow: for what is there wherein any hour can
breed him new delight? He knows that all is vanity: he has had his wishes
his belly full; for the rest let fortune do as her self shall please; his
rest, his stock is safe. This man may have his days enlarged I confess, but
less they shall not be, nor indeed enlarged otherwise, then more meat may be
set before him who is now already filled and can eat no more.

CHAP. VIII.
ANd therefore never say, This man has lived long: his white head, his
wrinckled face imports the same; for whether he lived long or no thou know
not: but long indeed I confess, thou s^est that he has been. For how can
thou say that he has sailed much, whom a cruel tempest takes immediately, as
soon as he is out of the havens mouth, and after much hurly-burly, much
traversing his way, and beating up and down, it brings him even the selfsame
way back to the haven that even now he went out of? This man has not much
sailed, but much has he been beaten. And here I often marvel much, when I
see some men so earnestly desire rest and respite, the men that they desire it
of being both so easy to be entreated, and so unable to hinder it or keep
them from it: the thing in whose respect they wish for rest and leisure so
greatly as they do, does much concern them, I mean both the requester and
the granter: the thing it self is Time, and yet they wish f^r it so coldly, or
rather so indifferently, as if it were a thing of no value at all; so little
do they weigh the thing which yet indeed is most precious. And indeed this
one thing greatly d^ceiueth them, because time is not subject to their senses,
nor is it easy by eye to judge thereof; and therefore no man accounts more of
it then of a very base matter, or rather a thing worthy no man's money. Every
new-yeares tide our Romans use to receive gifts and presents of mighty men,
in respect whereof they bind themselves to dance attendance on the giuers, to
bestow their labor, their pain and diligence at another devotion all the
year after; no man valuing the time he must bestow: for the same they use and
abuse many times so lauishly, as if indeed it cost them nothing. But if the
meanest man amongst them should ch^nce to be sick, if death come nearer then
they were aware of, see what suit straight they make to the Physician: or if
they fear the punishment of death by law, see if they do not offer gladly all
the wealth they are worth, to redeem their life, so diverse and so different be
their desires^ And if it were as easy to say what years each man has in
future time to live, as it is easy to tell you how many he has lived already:
how would some men tremble that should see so few years remaining; and how
chary would they be in bestowing them? And yet notwithstanding contrariwise, it
is an easy matter to order that we see is certain and more cause have we to
be charie of that, which we know not how soon it will be plenty. Nor are we
yet to think they know not what a jewel this time is which we speak of: for
their common words of courtesy to their best friends, are these; I would go,
I would ride, I would spend a month to pleasure thee: and indeed so they do
for other men, though they perceive it not, or rather they loose so much of
their own, without either turning it to their friends behoof, or perceiving
the loss thereof in them^elues; which makes them take the loss in better
part, because they do not feel it. Howbeit no man will restore thee thy time
again. Thy days shall s^ill go on as they have done hitherto, nor can thou
ever either recall time spent, or cause it for time present to cease to spend:
no, thy days shall make no more noise then yet they have done; nor shall they
give more warning of their swiftnes now then ever. Time shall slide and still
say nothing as it has done always. It is not like the prorogation of our
days, and of an Office, neither Prince nor people can give it thee the second
time, but even as it begun from the first moment, so shall it still continue.
Ye shall take up Inn at no place, how then? forsooth thou art occupied and thy
life hasts away, and death shall come even then when thou least dreamest of it;
and will thou, or have thou no will to it, thou must yet needs intend it.

CHAP. IX.
CAn any mortal man, be he never so wise and politic, tell us how we may
more thoroughly intend our selves then yet we do? or prescribe us how to live
hereafter more our own then yet we are? Nay, themselves with loss of life
are long occupied in telling how themselves will live, and (God wot) long they
be about their own conceits; and indeed the greatest loss of our life is
delay, which wears away the first day, bereauing us of present time whilst it
promises us things future. Nor is there any greater impediment why we live
not out of hand then expectation, which hangs always on to morrow: so thou
loosest this day and determinest what shall become of that which fortune is
wholly Lady of, while it passes and slippeth from thee that thou art Lord of.
What hopest thou, what gapest thou for? All that is to come is uncertain, and
therefore live out of hand: for the greatest Poet that ever was^ as it were by
inspiration, gives thee wholesome council, Our happiest days do pass from us
poor mortal men
First, and before the rest.
And therefore why delayest thou? Why stayest thou? Life flies if thou lay not
hands upon it; and if thou do lay hands upon it, yet nevertheless it
flies; and therefore strive thou always with the swiftness of time, and be
as swift in usage and turning it to profit, as thou would be quick to draw
water out of a River that thou knew would not continue in his running. And
in this, well says the Poet, he calls them not happy years, but happy
days, thereby hitting us in the teeth with our inf^nite conceit of time to
come. Why do thou in security and in such dispatch of time so leisurely
dream of months and years, yea, and draw thy years also (to please thy
fancy withal) so long in such a number? He talks with thee of days, and of
days also now fleeting. Nor is it doubt, but as he says, each most happy day
leaves us first mortal men, who are daily more and more busied each day then
other, whom age breaks in upon, not having yet put off our childish
affections, to the which we come unready and unarmed for it, for we have
naught ready for it, but it lights upon us unawares, before we dreamt of it,
nor did we feel it coming day by day as we should, but it fares with us like
those men whom a tale or some pleasant matter read, or other meditation
deceives in their journey, so that they know and see they are come to their
iorneyes end, before they thought that half their way was spent thitherward,
even so this daily quick race of our life, which as well we pass on sleep,
as we do awake, it shows not it self to us, whiles we be occupied, but in
the end when it is gone.

CHAP. X.
ANd that I said, if I would follow by peecemeale as I might; I could find
great reason why to prove the busied man's life shortest as I say. Fabianus was
wont to say (who was none of these great formal talkatiue Philosophers, but
one of those formed former aged, true and plain Philosophers) We should fight
against affections, not by slight but by might, not by easy and gentle venues,
but with all the ^orce we can make. We should strive to beat down their
senseles Army, for touching would not help the matter, they must be strongly
set on: yet to show these men their error, I will not only inueigh at them in
bitter manner, but I will strive plainly and sensibly to teach them this
their folly. All our life is divided into three parts, that is, that was, and
that is to come, that we do God knows is short, that we shall do is
doubtful, that we have done is out of doubt: for in this la^t indeed, dame
fortune has lost her force, nor ca^ it now be pur in the power of any thing to
make undone; and yet this time the busied man has wholly lost; for he has no
leave to look back, or if once he have leisure, yet small pleasure takes he to
record a thing past, which he has such reason to repent him of: for little
lust he needs must have to call to mind time mispe^t, which he dares not now
unfold again, for fear the faults, which at the time under color of delight
he was content to commit, by new handling become more manifest, and show
themselves in their kind; and indeed no man does willingly strain himself to
look backward but such an one as does all things under guard, and in awe of
his own conscience, which is never deceived. He that has in many things
desired with ambition, despised with disdain, conquered with insolency,
cousined with subtlety, scraped to him with covetousness, misspent by
prodigality, this man must needs be much afraid to recall himself to memory.
And yet this recapitulation of time past and spent, is the time already
shriued, already past all chance, and fear of change, free from fortunes
counterbu^^es, out of danger either of penury, of fear or sickness; this
cannot be distempered, nor taken from us, but remains our perpetual and
impregnable possession: days are present never more then one and one, and they
by moments also: but of time past many months, many years at your
commandment, are ready pressed at a beck; they are content you look on them,
you handle them, and hold them, which the busied man is never well at leisure
to perform: none but the quiet careless man can fetch a vagary leasurely
throughout all parts of his life; the busied mind is (in a manner) ringde and
yokte for rowting; he cannot bow nor bend, nor intend to look back, and such
men's lives sink into a bottomless pit or gulf: but even as it does not
profit thee to have powered to thy behoof never so much in quantity of any
thing whatsoever, never so good in quality, if thou have not wherein to hold
it and preserve it: so little booteth it thee, how long time thou have to live,
if thou have not wherein to hold it, or bestow it; but let time flit away
through thy fancy shaken, chinked and tottered desires. Now the present time is
short, and so short, that some men think it in a manner nothing, for it is
ever flitting: it runs, it huddles forward, and it cease (in a manner)
before it come, nor does it otherwise make stay, then the world or the stars,
whose never resting rolling, never stands in one place long: and yet this only
present time belongs to the busied man, which it self is yet so short as it
cannot have hands laid on it, and yet it amongst so many matters slippes away
ere we are aware of it.

CHAP. XI.
AT a word, will thou see how little while they live: no more but see how
desirous they be still to live yet longer? old laid up, aged Syers, yet
cease not still to beg one year, yet more and more: yea their conceit still
runs, they are younger then they seem for; they feed themselves with
leasing, and such a pleasure they take to belie their age, as if their destiny
and death would come so much the later for their false belying it; and let any
weakness give them but never so little a warning of their mortalities; how
fearfully they die, not as if they did depart, but as if will they, nill they,
they were pulled out by the ears, then they cry; what fools were we that
took no pleasure in life, then they vow, they will live at hearts ease, then
they see how in vain they sought for that they could not enjoy: then they
acknowledge all their labor was to small effect: but they that live to
themselves in several, tending to no man's business besides, what lets us to
account their lives large enough? none of it is lost or misspent, here and
there in other matters none of it is hazarded at fortunes command: naught is
lost by negligence, naught is given away by largess to other men's uses, naught
is lost as superfluous, but every jot or moment of it is counted good revenue:
and therefore life thus spent, be it never so little, is enough, nor will a
wise man fear at any time without fear to die. But here you ask me whom I
call the busied man? think not I mean only such as either are attended on by
great troops of suitors, with great pomp and countenance, or with some show
of base and servile nature, wait all day upon others, who for duties sake are
called abroad to attend at others doors, or such as do wait all the week
long upon the owtred, to gain a penny at that unseemly sale. No, some men's
best leisure even at home in their gardens of sport and pleasure, even a bed,
or where else a man may be said to be at rest and leisure; yet is it all
consumed (as I said) with business, yea themselves are a trouble unto
themselves, whose life I call not leasureable, or full of leisure, but an idle
kind of business rather.

CHAP. XII.
Call thou him at quiet, who with great care seeks in all corners for the
metal that was made at the burning of Corinth? and spends the more part of
his time in searching out amongst rustie copper, to see if he can light on any
of it? or annoints his servants whom he keeps to get prizes at wrestling? or
is suruaying either his sheep or his land, or other revenues? or say thou,
he is at leisure, that every day spends an hour or two in the Barbers shop,
cutting every day down again that grew the night before? devising upon every
hair he has, whether it be better to cut it, or let it grow? chasing like a
young Emperor, if the Barber were but never so little negligent, or less
curious, because he thought he had a man of discretion in hand to cut, who are
straight ways in great rage, if never so little of their loue-locks be nipped
away? or if every knot thereof fall not round in a ring? of which sort of
curious fools, some had rather see disorder in the common wealth they live in,
then in their hair? and had rather see their locks kept fair, then regard
their own health? and care more to be accounted a neat nice fellow, then to
have the voice for honesty? do thou say that this man is at rest and
leisure? so wholly busied and occupied between the comb and the glass? or
that he is so, that spends his time in making, hearing, and learning songs,
forcing his voice, (which of nature is best and easiest so to be kept when it
is full and plain) into a kind of warbling or relishing against nature? whose
singers are ever going, as if they still were tinning, or striking time in a
song: who be they used in a matter of never so great importance, yea,
sometimes sad and sorrowful, yet are ever and anon resounding some piece of a
song or other? these men (say I) have not leisure, but are busied with a
needles and thriftles labor, whose time of feasting, I count not time of
pleasure or vacation; I see them still so careful how their Plate and their
services, and their servants may in decent manner become the feast, where hence
they seek the name of fine neat fellows, and so curiously they regard this
fond humor of their own, as they neither eat nor drink in quiet for it. Nor
account I them their own men, who all day long iog up and down from this
friend to that in their coaches and wagons, and will not miss an hour of
their daily gaddings in them, but have their servants to advertise them, it is
now time to bath, to swim, to sup; yea so much they give themselves over unto
this idle vain, that of themselves they know not, or will seem to be ignorant
when themselves are an hungered?

CHAP. XIII.
IT were long to run over these fellows one by one, whose lives have bin spent
either at Tables, or at Ball, or in basting themselves against the sun; I
cannot call them leasurable, whose pleasures put them to such pain and
business. As for them that spend their days in unprofitable studies, no man
doubts, but that with much a do, they do nothing, of which sort there are
many now amongst us Romans. It was the Grecians old disease to beat their
brains in finding out how many Rowers Ulysses ship had? whether Ilias or
Odyssea were foremost written? or whether one man writ them both? and many such
like questions, which whether you keep the knowledge of the^ to your self or
no, they neither greatly benefit your conscience to keep them, nor seem you
betterscholler to know them, but rather somewhat busier or more curious then
others. And even this vain desire to learn things needles possesses now the
Romans also. When I was last in Rome, I heard a learned man reckon up, what
things each Roman Captain had first been author of; Duilius first did win in
fight by sea: Curious Dentatus first did lead Elephants in triumph; and these
things though they tend not to true glory in deed, yet they belong in some sort
to matters politic. Such knowledge will not profit much; yet does it lead us
forward in a sort with a petty pleasant discoursing vanity. Grant we also them
leave to search what man first persuaded the Romans to go to sea. One Claudius
forsooth it was, whom they therefore called Caudex, because any building much of
boords, was then called in Latin Caudex, and books of Record, are also at
this day called Codices, and boats or ^rayers that carry any thing up and down
the Tiber, are and have been ever since named Caudicariae. Be it also not
amiss to know, that Valerius Coruinus was the first that wan Messana, and
thereupon had the name of Messana, added in reward of his prowess, which by
little alteration of a letter or two is now called Messala; the original
whereof every man is not acquainted with. Bear we also with him, that searches
how L. Sulla first let Lions loose to fight in our Roman Circ^s or Parrish
Garden, what time K. Bocchus sent him dart-flingers to kill them loose, or as
our Forresters now speak to hunt them of force, where before time they were
always presented tied. Let us not likewise enquire, if it were to the purpose,
that Pompey caused those (who were condemned) to fight in the same Park with
eighteen Elephants. This principal person in Rome (who amongst the ancient
Chiefetaines of war is renowned by reason of his bounty, and singular
mildness in manners) has supposed it would be a memorable sp^ctacle to cause
me to die after some new fashion. It is a little matter to make them fight,
and to be wounded in diverse places, he must have them crushed under the
insupportable weight of these great and huge creatures: it had been better to
have buried such a history, for fear lest afterward some other great Lord
hearing the recital thereof, should conceive a liking to practice the like
inhumane and barbarous action. O how much does great ptosperity ouerspread our
understanding with darkness! Pompey reputed himself equal with the gods, at
such time as he exposed so many troops of poor men to savage beasts, that were
brought from foreign countries, and when he caused a mortal fight to be
performed between creaturs so different, shedding much blood in the presence of
the Roman people; when as he him self an on after was to be reduced to that
necessity to shed others: but he himself also (deceived by the disloialty of
the council of Egypt) was stabbed by one that had served under him and then
understood that at last how vain that surname of Great was, which was
attributed unto him by others.

CHAP. XIIII.
But to return unto my purpose, and to show in other recitals the superfluous
diligence of others, the same discourse above mentioned, reports that
Metellus having conquered the Carthaginians in their quarrels for Sicilia, was
the only man that ever led 120. Elephants captives before his chariot: he told
also, how Sylla was the last Roman that enlarged the common or void ground
without the walls of Rome (which was not suffered to be done amongst our
ancestors for any conquest or land gotten in any Country, but only in Italy,
though Syllas conquests, were all of them out of Italy we know, which point was
yet more worth the knowledge, then how the hill Auentinus was without the
compass of this ground, I speak of without the walls; for one of these two
reasons, either for that the people severed themselves from the Senate into
this hill, when the Senators would have made a law, that no Patritius or
Senators child should mar^ic with him or her that was not so, or for that the
vultures, (whose flight Romulus observed, when he built this City) did not
compass in this hill with the other six. Many more curious points did this man
declare, which if he did not invent, yet did he little better; for grant all
these nice points to be written in good sooth, yet I pray you what amisses do
any of them mend? whose desires do they minish? or who by them is made either
more courageous, or iuster, or more liberal? mine old friend Fabianus was wont
to doubt, whether it were better be ignorant, or to know such vanities. But I
take them to be leasurable, that study divine wisdom, which no time present
can consume, nor no time to come diminish, and wholly exercise themselves in
celestial contemplation; for such men do not only use their own time well,
but they also add thereto the ages spent before they were borne, and enjoy
them also as their own, yea all the famou^ Recorders of most sacred opinions,
were after a sort, as it seems even borne for them, and in a manner prepared
the way for them how to live the better. Which worthy writers bring us with
much ^ase and little labor to most worthy matters brought by them out of
darkness into light, yea they keep us not from things done or said in any
age ere we were borne, they admit us unto all things, yea if we lust by the
greatness of an heroical mind to pass the narrow bounds of man's weak
reach, we have time enough to do so if we list our selves. Why then leave we
not this brittle transitory time of life, and why betake we us not wholly (at
least in mind and cogitation to these infinite and everlasting matters, which
we have in common with better natures. These men that run continually courting
and waiting always upon great men, troubling others and themselves in their so
doing, when they have gone a madding, and dan^d attendance at al men's doors,
not leaving any great man vnwaited on, when they have done their days labor
in saluting them, how many I pray you can they have visited of so infinite and
busy a number of great men in Rome? Among which great mighty ones, how many
are there, whom for because, that either they were a sleep, or otherwise
occupied, or not at leisure to intend them, they could not therefore be
admitted to speak with all? how many are there, who after that they have long
been waited for, come out, and suddenly look upon them, and are gone again?
nay; how many are there that shun to take their way through such troops, as
come to wait upon them to the hall or Senate? and rather take some backe-wayes
through some secret by-corner, and leave them all, as if it were not much more
unseemly, and worse manners of the twain in this sort, rather to cosen them
by avoiding them when they were once admitted then absolutely to keep them out
before they came; and yet how many are there that having scarsly slept out
their yesterdayes surfeit; yet break their sleep poor souls themselves to
wait till it please another to rise, like forsooth for their pains to be
saluted in some rechlesse or proud sort, by their names of the great men, aft^^
he has had the same a thousand times put into his head by some prompter or
other: but indeed if we will needs dance attendance with fruit, I tell you
they wait wisely that daily court Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, and the rest
the pillars of good learning; that endeavor to make Aristotle, and Theophrastus
well known unto them. None of these but will be always at leisure to intend
thee: none but will dismiss thee a man happier for thy self, and more in love
with him for his company, then thou wast at thy first coming. They will not
let thee go^ empty, whenever thou will go, come at midnight or at midday,
any man may speak with them. None of these will force thee to die before thy
time, as great Princes do of their most faithful servants, but every one will
instruct thee how to die; none of these will spend or take away any ^ot of thy
days, but are all rather ready to bestow their time on thee; thou need not
fear what thou say in their company; yea no enemy of thine ^an suspect th^^
for being often with them.

CHAP. XV.
OF these thou may obtain whatsoever thou will; nor will they be in the
fault if thou take not of them as much as thou art able: Oh how happy is that
old man that has spent all his days in the service of them! he is sure of
secret friends with whom he may consult in great things or small, whose
counsel he may ask every hour at his pleasure, from whom truth he shall
hear without vpbrayding, praise without flattery, and whom well he may
imitate without note of apishnesse. We say commonly we could not choose of whom
we would be borne; but of such we came as our fortune was we should come: but
in this case yet we may choose of whom we will be borne. These worthy wits and
write^s have their stock and families; choose of which thou will be, and thou
shall be not only of his name, but his successor also for his wealth and
liuelyhood, which is also commonly the more ample, among the more it is
divided: these will lead thee to eternity, and will lift thee up so high, as
whence no man living shall be able to remove thee. And this is only the way
to stretch out thy mortality, yea, to change it into immortality if any there
be. Honors and other monuments, what ever either ambition has by Law
established, or cost has built, do quickly perish. Time wears out all things,
yea, and soonest wears those things which it has made hallowed; only wisdom
cannot be hurt nor impaired any way. No time present can consume it, nor time
to com diminish it, the longer it lasts the more it is still regarded; for
envy touches only things near in memory^ and more absolutely do we reverence
things farther off. And so we see the wise-mans life is large enough, he is not
enclosed as others are, but is only freed from the laws, that otherwise
mankind is straightened withal: yea, all time does yield unto him, as it
yields we conf^sse to the gods themselves. Time is past: this consideration
does him good. Time is come: this he uses. Time will come: he preuenteth it;
and thus comparing time with time, makes his life very long, whereas their life
is very short, who forget the time past^ neglect that is p^esent, and ^eare the
time to come: which when it once is come, too late poor^ ^^en they find, they
were all very busy in doing nothing.

CHAP. XVI.
Neither art thou to think that by this argument it is approved that they
lead a long life, because sometimes they call upon death. Imprudencie vexes
them with uncertain affections, and such as assault and encounter thos^ which
they fear: they therefore oftentimes wish for death, because they fear it;
neither is that an argument likewise whereby thou should be persuaded that
they should live long^ because the day seems oftentimes long unto them,
because whilst the appointed hour of supper time comes they complain that
the hours steal on slowly. For if at any time occupations fail them, they
storm because they are left without business and idle: neither know they how
they may dispose or enlarge the same. They therefore intend some occupation,
and all the time that is between, is grievous unto them, in such sort
undoubtedly as when a day is proclaimed wherein the sword-players are to
skirmish, or when as any appointed time of any other, either spectacle or
pleasure is expected, they long and labor to outstrip the hours. The delay of
all that which they hope for is long unto them. But that time which they love
is short and headlong, and becomes likewise more short by their fault, for
they fly from one delight to another, and cannot settle themselves upon one
sort of pleasure. The days are not long unto them, but displeasant and
tedious. Contrariwise, how short think they the nights to be, which they lose
in embracing their harlots and drunkenness? From thence grew the fury of
those Poets, who fed and flattered men's errors with fables, who fained that
Jupiter being bewitched with the pleasure of his adulterous embraces, redoubled
the night: What other thing is it then to animate wickedness to make the gods
the authors of them, and to give an excusable license to an infirmity by the
example of divinity? But can these men find the nights other then very short,
that they buy at so high a price? They lose the day in expectation of the
night, and the night through the fear of the day. Their pleasures are
accompanied with fears, burried with diverse disquiet perturbations; their
greatest joy is drowned in careful thought. How long shall this continue?
Because of this passion Kings have bewailed their power; neither did the
greatness of their fortune delight them, but the end that was to ensue
terrified them. When that most insolent Persian King spread his army along the
fields, whose number he could not tell, and scarcely could he tell what
quantity of ground would well contain it; it is said he wept, considering
that within one hundred years there should not one of all that number be left
alive: but he himself that wept was even the man that hastened all their
deaths, as indeed afterward proved, when as what by Land, what by Sea, what in
sight, and what in flight, every mothers son almost, very shortly after
miscarried, whom he feared should not live an hundred years.

CHAP. XVII.
Moreover, their joys are full of fears, they build them not on sure ground,
but by the same vanity they rise, by the same they fall. And what will you
think of those their times, which in their own confession are unhappy, if
these whereof they vaunt themselves, and in which they take themselves to be
more then men, be scarcely perfect? Every highest tipe of happiness is full of
fear; nor may we well in truth less build on any fortune then that which is
happiest. One free City needs another to maintain it, and having once that
we desired, we are forced straight ways to desire anew, to have wherewith to
maintain the former state: for every thing that fortune gives is uncertain;
and the higher always that felicity is, the nearer ever is it to a downfall
and ruin. And no man can take pleasure in the state he knows assuredly shall
shortly fall; and therefore most unhappy, not only short is their life who with
much ado procure that which with much more labor they must possess, with
much trouble compassing the thing they desire, but with much more care
continuing the thing once gotten; all which while no care is had of time, of
preciou^ time, that neither shall nor can be recovered again. Old business
breeds new business, one hope brings forth another, this high desire makes way
for an higher then it to follow it, and so no end is sought of the miseries we
are in, though every day we change the matter which procures miseries. Our
own preferments prove even burdens to us; others honors have cost us time to
procure them for them: nor have we so soon left to sue for our selves, but
immediately we are suitors in the same case for others. We will plead no more
as Counselors as it were to day; to morrow we are admitted to the Bench as
Judges; the third day happily called to the Councel-table. Marius is no sooner
dismissed out of war, but at home he is in suite for the Consulship. Quintius
is dismissed of his Dictatorship to day, not long after he is called from the
Ploughes thereto again. Young Scipio scarce fit for such a charge, is sent
against the Carthaginians as it were to day; he conquereth Hanniball and
Antiochus, is made Consul and gets his brother to be made next after him,
and so from dignity to dignity: and if himself be not the hinderance, in
time he shall be dignified no less then Jupiter, yea, and after that by his
industry Rome was delivered from the fear of Haniball, and he returned home to
his wife and children, he was straightwayes occupied in civil factions and
suits for offices: and rather then he would satisfy himself with ordinary
preferments, he chose wilfully to go into exile and was proud thereof; as if
forsooth when happy and fortunate business began to fail him, he would rather
busy himself in unfortunate proceedings then it should be said he wanted
business; so far we are from enjoying the leisure and pleasure which yet we
every day desire and wish for.

CHAP. XVIII.
WHy then, good friend Paulinus, exempt thy self from this common error that
possesses the world; and now thou have been busied more then any of thine
equals in age or honor, betake thy self at length into a haven of quiet, call
to mind what storms thou have endured, what tempests, partly for private
matters, and oftentimes for public affairs thou have entangled thy self
withal: thy virtue has been tried sufficiently in troublesome unquiet
matters: try what it can do in peace, at home in quiet. Thou have spent the
greater, or at least the better of thine age in public business, in causes
common to thy wife and children, turn some part thereof to thine own use, to
thine own behoof. I wish thee not to betake thee to an idle, or unlearned, or
unprofitable a vacation, nor would I have thee to spend the residue of thy
worthy nature, in sleep or other unseemly common peoples pastime, this I
count not rest or quietness. Thou shall find many greater matters then those
that yet thou have been conversant in, to bestow thy repose and leisure in.
Thou have kept the accounts of the Roman Storehouses, which is as much almost
as the accounts in a manner of all the world; the same I say thou have kept
with such abstinence as if they had not belonged to thee, with such diligence
as if they had been thine own revenues, and yet with such integrity as if
thou knew well it were the wealth of the City and State of Rome, and thou
to answer for every halfe^peny: and in this thine office thou have won the
love of all men, wherein other men could hardly avoid much hatred; and yet
trust me, it is a wiser part to be able to give a good account of thine own
life and living, then of all the corn in the country. Recall therefore this
worthy mind of thine, fit I know for greatest matters; recall it yet from this
honorable, yet scarce a happy service to show thy self at home a while, and
remember this was the final and most principal end of thy creation and first
being, that in the end thou should be Surueyor of the Cities corn, thou
must propose a more private, but yet a higher and better calling: nor will
there want any frugall and painful men to supply thine office; so far
fitter are slow and unwieldy jades, or young and untamed Colts to bear great
burdens, then the trampling and stirring Steed, whose life and actiuitie no
man durst ever charge with a lumpish burden. Besides this, bethink thy self
how much care attends thee whilst thou vndergoest so great a charge. Thou
have to deal with the bellies of men. A people that endures hunger is not
subject unto reason, neither is mitigated by equity, nor pacified by any
prayers. It is not long time since that under the Emperor Caligula, although
now displeased (if dead men have any sense) to be dead in a few days, and to
have left the Roman people alive, that there was not found sufficient victuals
in the City for seven or eight days: and whilst this Prince made bridges of
boats, and sported himself with the means and forces of the Empire, the most
dreadful of all other evils, that is to say, famine besieged Rome. His
imitation of a furious and foreign King, and unhappily puffed up with pride
well may cost the overthrow and famine of his country, and that which
follows famine the ruin of all things. What mind then had they and care,
who had the charge to provide corn for the common store. They prepared
themselves to receive the strokes of swords, to be stoned, burned, and to
meet with Caligula; yet dissembled they very carefully the cure of this evil,
that was hidden in the intrailes of the City; for there are some infirmities
whereunto we ought to apply remedies, without discovery of the sickness, as
contrariwise diverse men are dead, because they knew they were sick.

CHAP. XIX.
REtire thy self into these havens more calm, more assured, and more great:
think thou that to give order, that the corn be more closed up in the
storehouses good and clean without being spoiled by the malice and negligence
of the Porters, in such sort that wet neither seize or ouerheat it, and
consequently, that it return to his measure and weight, is a thing of as great
importance, as when thou approachest the celestial mysteries, and when thou
come to enquire what the nature of the Gods is, there will their condition,
their form, the estate of thy soul, and the places where nature shall lodge
us after our decease, what it is that sustaineth the most weightiest of all the
works of nature in the center of the world, and suspendeth the lighter things
above, and carries fire up on high, and exciteth the stars in their courses?
In brief, all the rest full of great miracles: will thou forsaking the earth,
rowse thy mind and consideration to these things, now, and so long as thy blood
is warm, and vigor strong? thou must aspire to that which is the best. An
ardent love of prayse-worthy sciences, the practice of virtue, the
forgetfulness of passions, the science to live and die well, a deep repast
discharged from all worldly affairs, attend thee in such a manner of life.
True it is, that the condition of all those that are entangled with worldly
affairs is miserable: but yet more miserable is the estate of those men who
are not busied in their affairs, but sleep, walk and eat according to other
men's appetites, and are constrained to love and hate those things that are most
free of all others: if such men would know how short these men's lives are, let
them consider how much they rebate of their own: you envy not those whom you
see attain unto charges, and grow in reputation amongst the people. Such
aduancements are got with the expense of life, and to obtain the credit that
a man may count the year of his name, they use all the years of their life.
Some other there are that being desirous to attain the highest degree of
honor, after they have traveled long therein, are dead in the midst of
their way: and others, which having attained the same by infinite and evil
practices, have been seized with this distasteful apprehension, that they have
traveled much to build them a tomb, and make themselves spoken of after their
death: some also conceiving new hopes in their old years, as if they had been
in their prime, have lost their hearts, and perished in the midst of their
unquiet and unjust attemps and endeauours.

CHAP. XX.
BAse is the man, who being already old, has sought to grow in credit
amongst the foolish common people, and is dead in spending himself to plead
for mere strangers that would set him on work: as abject is he, that being
rather weary of life, then of travel, is fallen amidst the affairs which he
has embraced, and because he that having death at his door, tosseth his
papers and affairs to the great contentment of his heir, who long time
expected for such a prey, I cannot bury in silence one example that comes to
my memory: T^ranius was an old man of exact diligence, who alter the ninetieth
year of his age, being discharged of his office of commissary of victuals by
the Emperor Claudius, got him into his bed, commanded all his servants to
muster about him, and to bewail him as if he were dead: the family lamented
the repose of their old master, and continued this sorrow until such time as
he was restored to his office. Is there so great a pleasure then to die bnsied?
there are many that resemble this Turanius, they desire to travel even at that
time when they can no more, they combat against the feebleness of their
bodies, and think not their age troublesome, except it be because it
commands them to live in repose. When a Soldier is fifty years old, ^he law
constrains him not any more to bear Arms: a Senator having attained to
threescore years, is no more bound to attend the Senate; (...) more hardly
obtain leave to repose themselves at their own hands (...) from ^he Law. In
the mean while whilst they assail others, and are assai^^ themselves,
whilst one breaks an others rest, whilst every one tormenteth himself,
life slippeth away without profit, with our pleasure, or any content of the
mind, there is no man that represent^th death unto himself, there is no man
that extends not his hopes far o^f. Some likewise there are that dispose of
these things which are after life, as of their proud Sepulchers, of
inscriptions; and dedicacy of their buildings, of sports, combats, and other
solemnities of their ambitious funerals: but undoubtedly these men's obsequies
should be solemnized with torches and Tapers, as if they had lived very little.

The End of the Book of the shortness of Life.
OF COMFORT, ADDRESSED BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENE^A TO POLYBIVS.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THis book was written during the time of his exile at such time as he was
dejected both in mind and body (we must confess it, and the writing
testifies it) about the third year of his banishment: for he openly makes
mention of the first entrance into Britany, which was about that time: As
touching POLYBIVS he was one of the most powerful free men that belonged to
CLAUDIUS, and received that title by reason of his studies, for he was learned
in the Greek and Latin tongues, and may we gather honest appar^ntly by the
praises which SENECA loadeth him with; he comfort him in the death of his
brother, and the whole disposition of the Book is hidden, because both the
beginning and diverse things else are missing: In that which is extant, this is
his order: he denies that we should grieve at the death of one man, because
the world it self and whatsoever is in it is condemned by that law: likewise
because the grief is vain, and without fruit. Thirdly, that we are borne to
afflictions, and that we ought to fashion our selves thereunto. Fourthly, he
calls to witness, the will of the dead, and shows his desire not to live.
Fifthly, that in constancy and example he ought to exceed his other brothers,
because he was a worthy person, and all men's eyes were fixed on him. Sixthly,
he wishes him to take comfort from his studies which he always loved. This
and such like until the 31. Chapter. From thence forward he intermixeth the
example of those who have endured the like courageously; amongst these (not
without vilde flattery) he produces CAESAR'S example, whom he wonderfully
praises, and in conclusion once again sends POLYBIV^ to his book and
studies, as a remedy of his grief: we cannot deny but this was SENECAES
writing: I think not to the intent he meant it should be published, but
according to his present fortune abiectly, and too humbly written to a slave
(alas) adorned with how many praises? I am ashamed, I am ashamed, whosoever
published this, was an enemy to SENECA, and his glory.

OVT OF THE (...) CHAP.
IF thou compare our bodies with them, they are strong, if thou reduce them to
the condition of nature that destroys all things, and recalleth them thither
from whence she made them, they are frail; for what can mortal hands make
immo^^all? Those seven miracles, and whatsoever else more wonderful then
these, the ambition of succeeding years have builded, shall be seen leueled
with the ground; the end of things are varied, and whatsoever has had a
beginning shall have an end: Some maintain that the wicked shall perish, and if
thou think it lawful to believe, so much then shall a day come that shall
dissipate the same, and drown the whole universe (which contains all
whatsoever is divine and humane) into their ^ormer confusion and darkness:
now then let him lament that list, by reason of the death of so many persous
that have been, let him deplore the destruction of Carthage, Numantium and
Corinth, or whatsoeu^r places were notorious, either in their flourishing or
fall, when as this likewise as evidently appears unto him, that even that
which has nothing whereupon to fall, must perish; let him go and complain
himself, that the Destinies (which must one day attempt and execute so great a
mischief) have not spared him likewise.

CHAP. XXI.
Secon^^y ^here is nothing that be^alleth us, that has not be^allen others.
WHat man is he of so proud and insolent arrogance, that in this necessity of
nature that reuoketh all things to the same end, will have himself and his
exempted out of the rank of all others, and discharge some house from that
ruin which shall devour the whole world. It is therefore a great comfort for
a man to bethink himself that the same has happened unto him, which all others
have suffered before him, Neither do our sorrows pro^ite those whom we
bewail nor our se^ues.
and all that follow him must endure, and therefore in my judgment nature has
made that most common which is most grievous, to the end that the equality
thereof might in some sort leni^ie the cruelty of the fate. This likewise will
yield thee no little comfort, if thou think that thy sorrow will neither
profit him whom thou bewailest, nor thy self; for thou would not have that
long that is unprofitable: For if sorrow would profit us any thing; I refuse
not to intermixe the remainder of those tears that my adverse ^ortune has
left me with thine; yea more likewise will I find out some remnant of remorse,
that may flow from mine eyes that are dried up by so many tears which I have
spent by reason of the misfortunes of my house: if that may return thee any
profit, why ceasest thou? let us complain: I will take the cause in hand, and
make it mine own. O fortune that in all men's judgment art most unjust, until
this present it was supposed that thou sparedst this worthy man, who by thy
favor had attained such credit, that his felicity (which is a thing both rare
and less heard of) was not enuyed by any man; behold thou have impressed a
sorrow in him more greater then he could receive, but in the loss of the
Emperor, and when thou had attempted and sought into him every ways, thou
could not find any fit means to assail him but this: A probable (...)
Senacaes (...) we (...) the ^^gh^st minds.
for what other injury could thou have done him? what; take away his money?
never was he a slave unto it, and now also as far as in him lies, he
casts it from him; and in this his so great felicity and means of enriching
himself, he seeks no greater fruit thereby then the contempt thereof. What
take away his friends? Thou knew he was so well beloved, that he might
easily substitute others in their places that were lost; for of all those great
Lords whom I have known in the Emperors house, this man alone in my
judgment was such a one that although it were expedient for all men to
entertain his friendship, yet their affection and desire to be in his favor,
was far more great then the assistance they pretended to reap by his
countenance. What deprive him of his honor? but that is so settled in him, that
thou have no power to shake it. What, rob him of his health? thou know that
his mind was so well grounded in liberal sciences (wherein he is not only
bred up but borne) that all infirmities of the body whatsoever cannot abash
him. What, take away his life? how little had thou hurt him? the excellency
of his mind had promised him a life of longer continuance^ he has carefully
endeavored himself to eternize the better part of him, and to warrantize
himself from death, by the excellent and learned works that he has composed.
As long as learning shall be any ways honored, as long as the vigor of the
latin tongue, and the grace of the Greek shall have credit amongst great
men: so long shall this man live amongst the men of most reputation, whose
sufficiency and worth he has either equalled, or (if his modesty refuse this
testimony) has very nearly imitated.

CHAP. XXII.
THou have therefore bethought thee of this one means, whereby thou might
harm him most; Some complaints against our estate, seem in some sort to be
able to lessen our grie^e.
for the better a man is, the more oftener is he accustomed to thy assaults, who
art displeased without election, and dr^^dfull amidst thy greatest benefits.
Was it so great a matter for thee to warrantize this man from affliction, whom
thy favor in some sort seemed to have sufficiently defenced, and not according
to thy usual custom to have light upon him rashly? but if thou will let us
add to these complaints the gentle nature of thy brother, ravished out of this
world in the prime of his youth; he deseured to have thee to his brother, and
thou undoubtedly art most worthy to lament such a brother as he was: all men
give an equal testimony of him, he is bewailed to thy honor, and praised for
his own desert, there was nothing in him which thou would not willingly
acknowledge. For thine own part thou would have showed thy self good to an
other brother, who might have been less good, but thy piety having found an
answerable subject in this man, has expressed it self more freely. Although
his means were great, yet never offended he any man, neither threatened he any
man with thee who were his brother: he was formed according to the example of
thy modesty, considering what honor it was unto him to be so nearly allied
unto thee, and of what importance that was, so likewise knew he how to manage
such a charge. O cruel destinies, enemies to all virtue; thy brother was taken
out of this world before he knew his own felicity; I am not displeased or
angry more then I should be, for there is nothing so difficult when a man is
extremely vexed, as to find out words that are answerable to his sorrow: yet
again, if this will yield us any remedy we will lament? Where one thoughts
thou unjust and injurious fortune? why have thou so suddenly repented thy self
of thy favorable dealing? what cruelty was this to break in amidst brothers,
and by so bloody a rapine to lesson such a company as lived in the greatest
peace of the world? why would thou trouble and diminish without cause a
house so well furnished with virtuous young men? amongst whom, there was no one
that degenerated. By this reckoning perfect innocence prevails nothing,
ancient temperance is unprofitable, a sovereign honor (accompanied with
unspeakable modesty, and entire, and pure love toward good letters, and an
upright conscience) shall be unfruitful. Polybius mo^rneth, and being
admonished in one brother, what he is to fear of the rest, is even afraid of
those very comforts which should lenifle his sorrow. Polybius mourns and is
sorrowful, although he be in great favor with the Emperor: undoubtedly
therefore, O malignant fortune, thou have made choice of this means, to show
that no man, no not Caesar himself can warrantize a man from thy fury.

CHAP. XXIII.
W^e ought not to grieve and to^ment our se^ues for that which is firm
unavoidable, and immutable.
We may accuse the Destinies longer, but we cannot change them, they continue
obstinate and in^xorable; no man can move them either with vpbraides, or
tears, or persuasions: they acquit no man of any thing, they pardon nothing:
let us therefore spare our tears, because they are unprofitable: for sooner
will sorrow lodge us with him then return him unto us; since she tormenteth
us, and comfort us not, let us shake her off in good time, and let us retire
our minds from vain solaces, and from a bitter desire of sorrow: for except
reason restrain our tears, fortune will not. Go to, turn thy self on every
side, and consider all men in this world: there is in every place an ample and
continual cause of tears; one man is called to his daily labor, by a
laborious poverty, an other tormented with insatiable ambition, an other
fears those riches he has wished for, and is sick of his own desires, this
man is afflicted with care, that man with labor, this man is tired with a
troop of suitors that besiege his doors, this man is sorry that he has
children, that man because he has lost them: we shall sooner want tears then
cause of sorrow. Considerest thou not what life it is that nature has
presented us with, since she would that tears should be the first presages of
our coudition in this world? This is our beginning whereunto all the course of
our years have relation: thus live we, and therefore we ought to keep a
measure in this thing, which we ought to do so often: and then considering
how many fatal accidents attend us, if wholly we cannot give over our tears;
at leastwise we ought to reserve some part of them for time to come. They that
we lament for sorrow not themselves, nor are sorry for us; neither take
pleasure in our lamentatio^s.
There is nothing wherein we ought to be more sparing then this whereof we
have so frequent use. Moreover thou shall be very much comforted, if thou
think that thy brother, for whom thou afflictest thy self in this sort,
takes less pleasure in that thou do then any man thou can name: he will
not, or he knows not that thou art thus tormented: It is therefore an
unprofitable labor to grieve for him, for if he feels nothing, it is
superfluous, and if he feels, he takes no pleasure therein.

CHAP. XXIIII.
BOldly dare I say, that there is no man in the whole world that is delighted
in thy tears. What then? think thou that thy brother is worse affectioned
toward thee then any other man? They cond^mn not our affection, but they would
not have us torm^^t our s^lues.
that he should desire thy affliction, that he should withdraw thee from thy
businesses, that is, from thy studies, and from Caesar? this is far unlikely;
for he has loved thee as his brother^ honored thee as his parent, and
respected thee as his superior; he would thou should remember him, but not
torment thy self for him; what avails it thee therefore to consume thy self
with sorrow, which if the dead have any sense, thy brother desires it should
be finished: for an other brother whose inclination might seem uncertain, I
should put all these things in doubt, and I should say, thy brother desires
that thou should be tortured with incessant tears; he is unworthy of this
affection, and if he would not, then give over thy unprofitable grief.
Neither should an impious brother be so bewailed, neither would a pious be so
lamented. But in this whose piety is so well approved, thou art to resolve thy
self that nothing can be more grievous unto him, then if this his death be
distasteful unto thee: if it vex thee any ways, if it troubles and spends
thine eyes unworthy of so great misery, with causlesse shewers of complaint.
But nothing shall withdraw thy piety so much from unprofitable tears as if
thou think that thou ought to be an example to thy brethren, The eighth.
We ought to be much advised of confidence and patience to those that survive.
whereby they may be instructed to sustain these injuries of fortune with
constancy. That now art thou to do which great Captains do in desperate
dangers or uncertain, who purposely feign a merry demeasure, and cloak their
discontents with a pleasant countenance, for fear lest their Soldiers should
be discouraged by discovering their governors discontent. Show thou a
countenance that is contrary to thy thought, and if thou can purge thy self
of all sorrow, at leastwise hide and contain it inwardly, lest it appear, and
endeavor thy self that thy brothers may imitate thee, who will think that
honest whatsoener they see thee do, and will assume their courage according to
the temper of thy conntenance. Thou must both solace and comfort them; but thou
can notwithstand their sorrow, if thou make a wanton of thine own.

CHAP. XXV.
THis thing likewise may restrain thee from sorrowing extremely, if so be
thou inform thy self, The nin^h, The more eminent our vocation is, the less
occasion have we to make our neighbors believe that we ^aue lost our courage,
and that we are unworthy to act that which is committed to our charge.
that none of those things which thou do can remain hidden. The common
consent of all men has made thee great, maintain that. Thou art environed
with a troup of men that come to comfort thee, who carefully consider thy
thought, and diligently observe whether it be fortified against grief
besides, not only if thou know how to use prosperity discreetely; or if thou
can endure adversity manfully: they observe thine eyes. All things are more
free unto those whose passions may be covered. As touching thy self thou can
not hide thy self; fortune has placed thee in all men's ^ies. Every man shall
know how thou have carried thy self in this conflict; whether upon the first
assault thou gave over thy weapons, or if thou have stood confidently in the
battle. Heretofore the favor of the Emperor, and thine own valor have made
thee rise to great estate, and therefore all bare and vulgar infirmity ill
befitteth thee. But there is nothing so vilde and so base, then for a man to
suffer himself to be devoured in sorrow. In the same grief it is not lawful
for thee to behave thy self so as thy other brothers. The opinion which is
conceived of thy studies and manners, permits thee not many things^ men
require many things at thy hands, and expect much, if thou would have had
all things lawful for thee, thou sholdest not have drawn al men's eyes upon
thee. But now so much art thou to perform as thou have promised all men, who
praise and applaude the endeavors of thy wit, who, whereas they have no need
of thy fortune, yet have need of thy wit. These are the watchmen of thy
mind. Thou can therefore do nothing that is unworthy the profession of a
perfect and learned man, but if diverse men will repent themselves, because they
have admired thee. Thou must not weep immoderately, and although thou art not
to loose a part of the day in sleep, nor in seeking thy repose, forsake the
bulk of affairs, and go and trifle it in the Country, not undertake with a
sprightly conceit a long voyage to recreat thy body, being wearied with
continual travel of thy weighty charge, nor to loose thy self in diverse
pastimes in the Theaters, neither to spend the hours of the day according as
it best likes thee.

CHAP. XXVI.
(...) He that is in authority must not soil himself with abiection of mind
for a great man's example does much harm on a sudden then he can remedy all his
life time.
THere are many things which are unlawful for thee, which are permissible in
men of base condition, and such as live in obscurity. A great dignity and
prosperity is a great servitude. It is not lawful for thee to do any thing
according to thine own mind. Thou must give audience to a thousand persons,
read an infinite of petitions; thou must be acco^ted by a num^erlesse number
of suitors, posting from every part of the world. Thou had need of a governed
mind to dispatch readily and suddenly the affairs of the greatest Prince in
all the word. I say it is not lawful for thee to weep, because thou art to
hear diverse men that weep; and to the end that their tears may be profitable
unto them that are in danger to obtain the mercy of most mild Caesar; thine
are to be dried up. Yet behold what will comfort thee greatly, and prove a
singular remedy for thee: Eloquence spent in vain and palpable flattery.
cast thine eyes upon Caesar, when thou would disburthen thy self of
sorrows. Consider what a charge his favor has imposed upon thee, how much
industry thou owe him, and then shall thou understand, that thou art no more
to be humbled by these crosses, then he (if a man may give any credit to
fables) who bears the whole world on his shoulders. For this cause diverse
things are not lawful for the Emperor, who may do all that which he
pleases. His vigilance conserueth the houses of all men in particular: his
travel gives them repose, his industry makes them live at ease, and in
delight. His occupation furnishes them with time to disport themselves in.
Since that time that Caesar dedicated himself to the world, and ravished
himself from himself, and as the Planets which incessantly run their
courses, he cannot rep^se, neither dispatch any thing of his own affairs. So
in the like sort, the same necessity is enjoined thee, thou art neither to
respect thine own profit, nor affect thy studies. The eleventh, We must
consider as well those goods that remain with us, as those at leas^wise which
we have least.
As long as Caesar is Lord of the world, thou can not addict thy self to
pleasure, or grief, nor to any thing else, thou art wholly Caesar's, Add
hereunto that having always made the world believe that thou love Caesar
better then thine own soul, it is not lawful for thee as long as he lives
to complain of thy fortune. He being in safety, all they that appertain unto
thee are in security; thou have lost nothing, thine eyes must not only be
dried but be joyful. In him thou have all things, and he to thee is as much
as all. I will tell thee without impeachment of thy prudence and piety, that
thou have little respect of his greatness, that as long as thy body is in good
health, thou give way to any thy sorrow whatsoever. But I will show thee
another remedy which is not so strong as the precedent, yet is it more
familiar, if at any time thou retire thy self into thy house, then will thou
have some cause to suspect thy sorrow, for as long as thou shall behold Caesar's
Godhead, sorrow will find no access unto thee, Caesar will possess
whatsoever is in thee, when thou departest from him, then as if occasion were
given, sorrow will find out thy solitude, and will creep by little and little
into thy soul that desires repose. Thou art not therefore to intermit any
time of study, The twelfth, Study lenifieth sorrow.
then will sciences and good letters which thou have so long and faithfully
loved, requite thy endeavor, and auowing thee for their patron and
affectionate servant, will take thee into their safeguard. Then Homer and
Virgil (who have so much obliged all men unto them, as thou have made them
obliged, having given order to make the^ known to more men, then they
themselves have written verses) shall long time make abode with thee. All the
time thou shall commit and give them to keep, shall be assured. Employ thy
self then in couching, in writing the deeds of the Emperor thy Master, to the
end that in all ages the Roman people may cele^^ate his memory, for he it is
that will furnish thee with matter, and give thee example to digest and set
down his actions.

CHAP. XXVII.
I Dare not induce and persuade thee so far according to thy accustomed
elegancy to set down the fables of AEsope, The thirteenth, If we ha^^ the
means to exercise our minds in high and worthy thoughts, it will be sure and
expedient to pacify our griefs.
a work as yet unattempted by our Roman wits: for it is a hard matter for a
mind so vehemently dejected as thine is, so quickly to undertake this more
pleasing and pleasant studies, yet shall thou know that thy mind will be
fortified, and recover himself, if he may give over these grauer studies, and
employ himself in those that are more delightful and free: for in the grauer,
the austerity of things which he shall entreat upon, will draw the same,
although it be sick and at debate in it self, but in those that shall breed
delight, thy spirit shall take no pleasure, but at such time as it shall be
settled and quieted in it self. Thou onghtest therefore to exercise thy self
in matters of importance, and then to temper thy mind with more pleasing
studies. This likewise will comfort thee very much, if oftentimes thou debate
in this sort with thy self. The foureteenth, We ought not to lament those
that are dead in regard of our selves, for this were to love our selves, nor
for their sakes, for as touching their bodies they have no sense, and as^
touching their souls, if they have been virtuous, they are in repose.
Whether am I sorrowful in respect of my self, or in regard of him that is
deceased? if for the love of my self, it is in vain that I persuade my self,
that I am a good brother, and the grief which begins is excusable, because
it is honest, and estranged from piety in this, because it has regard to
profit. But there is nothing that worse beseems a good man then to have a
will to consider, how much he has either won or lost by the death of his
brother. If I complain me for the love of him, I must needs approve it by one
of these two succeeding considerations, that is to say, that either the dead
have a feeling or no feeling. If they have no sense, my brother has escaped
all the incommodities of life, and is restored unto that place wherein he was
before he was borne, and being void of all evil, he neither fears nor
desires, nor suffers any thing. What madness is this in me, that I never give
over grieuing for him who shall never be aggrieued? if the dead have any
sense, the soul of my brother being as it were discharged out of a long
prison, is now in freedom and full liberty, she searches and beholds with
content the works of Nature, she discovers them from a high place wherein
she sees all humane things, and nearly approaches the divine: in search whereof
she was so long time vainly tormented. Why therefore afflict I my self with
the loss of him who either is blessed, or is no body. To bewail him that is
blessed, it is envy to lament him that is no more; is madness.

CHAP. XXVIII.
OR art thou displeased hereat, because in thy judgment thy brother is
deprived of great goods which followed and attended him? The fifteenth, They
are delivered from the miseries and misfortunes of this life.
When thou shall bethink thy self that there are many things which he has
left, consider that there are more things which he fears not. Anger shall
not vex him, sickness shall not aflict him, suspicion shall not provoke him,
gnawing and hateful envy that is always an enemy to other men's proceedings,
shall not attend him, fe^^e shall not press him, inconstant fortune that now
takes from one to give it to another, shall torment him no more: If thou
calculate well, thy brother has gotten more then he has lost. But he shall
no more enjoy his riches, neither his own honor, or the countenance he has
had by thee; he neither shall receive or do pleasures any more. Think thou
him miserable, because he has left these things, or happy because he
desires them no more? Believe me he is more blessed that has no need of
fortune, then he that is much troubled in entertaining her. The vanity of
riches.
All these goods which delight us by reason of their fair but fallacious
appearance, as money, estates, credit, and other such like which corrupt
covetous and ambitious men's minds, are possessed with pain, and beheld with
envy; they oppress those that are adorned with them, and threaten more then
they profit. They are slippery and uncertain, they are never firmly
possessed, for although a man were not in doubt of that which is to come, Great
fortune, great care.
yet so it is that the maintenance of a great prosperity is accompanied with
many cares, if thou will give credit to those who more inwardly examine the
truth, all our life is but a punishment. Being cast into this so deep and
troubled a sea, tormented with continual ebbes and floates, that now rayseth
us up with sudden increases, and straight forsakes us with greater losses,
and continually tossing us, we never remain in a settled place, we live in
suspense and incertainety, who are beaten one against another, and sometimes we
are shipwrackt, but always fearful. Sailing in this so stormy sea, and
exposed to all tempests, we find no haven but in death. Envy not thy brother
therefore, he is at rest, now at length he is free, now at length he is
secure, now at length he is eternal. The sixteenth, They that we call dead
are living, and the living are dead.
He has left the Emperor and all his race, thy self and all his brothers
behind him. Before that fortune turned her favorable face from him, he
forsook her even then when she stood unto him, and heaped favors upon him
with a plentiful hand. But now he enjoys an open and freer heaven from an
humble low Tabernacle, he has attained so conspicuous a place, whatsoever it
be that received those blessed souls that are delivered out of these earthly
bonds into his blessed bosom, that now he freely wandreth and beholds all
the goods of nature with exceeding pleasure. Thou art deceived, thy brother
has not lost the light, but has attained a more securer. It is a way that we
must all walk. Why complain we of desteny? he has not left us, but gone
before us.

CHAP. XXIX.
Believe it, there is a great happiness in dying happy, The seventeenth, He
that dies in prosperity has no doubt advantage.
nothing is assured, no not for the length of one day, only humane affairs
being so obscure and confused, as they be who will undertake to resolve
whether thy brothers death had wrought him envy, The eighteenth, We have long
time envied those whom death redemandeth at our hands.
or whether it has procured him good? Besides this, there is an other
consideration, which is to comfort thee, for thou ought to think that in
loosing such a brother, thou have received no injury, but that thou have been
greatly favored, because that so long time it has been in thy power, to envy
and make use of his piety. Unreasonable is that man that has not given his
benefactor that credit to dispose of that he gives according to his best
liking. and that man is covetous, that in stead of calling that gain which a
man gives him, complains that he has lost that which he has restored.
Ungrateful is he that says, that injury is the end of pleasure. And foolish
is he that thinks there is no fruit but in things present, that contenteth
not himself with those things that are past, esteeming those things for
certain goods which appear not any more, because he ought not to be afraid
that they are lost. Too much scantleth he his ways, who thinks that he
enjoys nothing but those things that he has and sees, and esteems them
as much as nothing which he has had, and has no more, ^or all pleasures
abandon others very suddenly, it is a thing that slippeth away, that passes,
and is taken from us almost before it comes; we must therefore beflect our
thoughts upon the time that is past, and recall to memory, and oftentimes
ruminate on all that which has ever given us pleasure. The remembrance of
delights and contentments is more assured and endures longer time, then the
presence of them: remember this therefore amongst thy greate^^ goods, that thou
have had a good brother: think not how long time he might as yet have lived
with thee, but how long time he has remained with thee. Nature gave him both
to thy self, The nineteenth, We ought not to be grieved to repay that to God
which he has lent us, and appertain to him, it suffices he craves his own
without interest.
and the rest of thy brothers, not as a thing proper unto you, but she has
lent him you, and when she thought good she has redemanded him, not
satisfying thy will herein, but her own arrest. If a man should be angry for
paying a debt for which he allowed no interest, should he not be thought a
most wicked fellow? Nature has given thy brother life, and thy self likewise,
and afterward using her own right, she has redemanded her debt from him,
she thought fit to challenge. She is not in fault (whose condition was very
well known; but we ought to accuse the covetousness of mortal men, who
sometimes either forget what nature is, and never remember themselves of their
condition, except it be then, when they are brought in memory thereof. Rejoice
therefore that thou have had so good a brother, The twentieth, It is a thing
decreed that all men must die, and therefore our friend cannot be exempted no
more then others.
and take in good part the use thou have had of him, although it were shorter
then thou could have wished it. Think that it was most pleasing to thee
that thou had, and humane that which thou have lost. It is an unreasonable
matter to be sorrowful, because thou have so small a time enjoyed thy
brother, and not to be glad that thou have once enjoyed his presence. But he
died say thou at such time as I leaft thought of it. Every one suffers
himself to be deceived by his slight belief, and when we love a thing, we
will not forget that it is subject unto death. But nature has protested that
she will exempt no man from this necessity, which is imposed upon all men. We
see daily both our acquaintance and strangers carried to their graves, yet
think we upon an other matter, and call it a sudden accident, which during
our whole life time has been told us that it should come to pass. This is
not therefore the iniquity of the Fates, but the deprauednesse of man's mind,
who is displeased because he must depart from that abroad, which was only lent
him for a time.

CHAP. XXX.
An example what we ought to do.
HOw far more iuster was he, who receiving tidings of ^he death of his son,
uttered a worthy speech correspondent and answerable to his worthy mind^ I knew
when I begat him that h^e should die. Wonder thou not that such a man begat
such a son that could die courageously. The death of his son was no nouelty
to him: The twenty one, We ought not to fear that which must necessarily
happen, although it be in diverse sor^^.
For what wonder is this for a man to die, whose whole life is naught else but
a journey unto death. I knew when I begat him that he should die: and
afterward he annexed a thing of a greater note, prudence and constancy; I
brought him up to this end. So are we all whosoever enters into life, is
destinated to death. Let all of us therefore content our selves with that which
is given us, and restore it again when we are required. Let our minds be
always addressed, and never fear that which must needs fall out; nor expect
that always which is uncertain. Shall I call to remembrance in this place,
the great Chiefetaines in war, their children, and diverse persons honored by
diverse Consulates and triumphs, who are dead by the hands of inexorable
Destiny? whole Kingdoms with their Kings, whole peoples and nations have ended
their course. All men, nay more, all things tend unto their end. Although that
in regard of the particular they are different. One is taken away, and dies in
the midst of his rece, another in the entry, another in his extreme old age,
being now wearied and desirous to depart, is scarsely permitted to die. The
times of death are different, yet all of us tend to the same place. I know not
whether it be more foolish to be ignorant of the law of mortality, or more
impudency to refuse the same. The twenty two, The good books that are written
either by our selves or others, may comfort us greatly, as also gravity in^
years or reputations, and occupationr, which we ought carefully to observe.
But I pray thee take some time to ouerlooke these things, which with great
travel of thy mind thou have worthily celebrated; namely the Poems of Homer and
Virgil, which thou have so readily and cunningly continued in proof, that
although the quantity and composition of the virtue, appear no more, yet the
grace of the same remains. For thou have in such sort turned them from Greek
into Latin, and from Latin into Greek, that thou have attained all those
perfections that are requisite in him, that translateth from one tongue into an
other. There is no one book in all those writings that furnishes thee not
with a great number of examples of the inconstancy of man's life, of uncertain
accidents and casualties, that succeed and flow from diverse courses. Consider
with what Majesty of speech thou have presented these things, at such time as
thou art ashamed to loose thy courage so seen, and to descend so low after thou
have spoken so high. Demeasure not thy self like him that of late admired thy
writings, and asked how it was possible that so feeble a spirit as thine was
could conceive so great and so solid things; but rather cast thine eyes aside
from these afflictions that torment thee, and turn them toward so many
excellent consolations, in regarding thy brothers so virtuous, thy wife and thy
son. Fortune has parted stakes with thee, in taking away thy brother, and
leaving thee all the rest in security and safety.

CHAP. XXXI.
Dishonor not thy self so much, The twenty three Aten ^^ght to con^id^r the

as to give the whole world occasion to believe that one sorrow has more power
over thee, then these so many solaces. Behold thy brothers, thy wife, and thy
son wounded with the same sorrow that thou art, without having any means to
help thee, nay contrary thou s^^st, that they expect thou should succor
them. And therefore the less spiri^^ and knowledge they have, the more
needful is it, that thou resist this evil that concerns you all. And it is
in some sort a kind of comfort to demand a man's sorrow amongst many, and
because many partake with thee in thine, there should be very little remainder
for thy self. I will not cease to represent unto thee the Emperor Cl^^dius,
as long as he shall govern the world, and make it known that the Empire is
far better maintained by benefits then by arms, thou need not fear that
thou should feel any cross: thou have sufficient security, and a
consolation in him alone. Raise and rowse thy self, and as often as tears
begin to dry thine eyes, fix them so often upon Caesar, and by beholding so
great and ^o excellent a power, thine eyes shall be dried; his brightness
will so ravish them that they cannot admire any other thing but himself, and
will keep them fixed upon himself. He it is whom thou beholdest day and
night, and from whom thy heart is never estranged, and whose admiration must
devour thee? This is he that can assist thee against fortune^ and I doubt not
^ince he is a Prince so courteous, and so well affected toward all his
servants, but that he has already applied diverse remedies to thy wounds, and
ministered diverse medicines to thy pains, for fear they should increase. And
what? although he had done none of all these, does not the only presence and
remembrance of him comfort and animate thee greatly? Vouchsafe all you gods and
goddesses to give him a long and happy life: let him exceed Augustus both in
actions and years, and so long as he shall live in this world, let him be
exempted from beholding the death of any of his. Let his dominion of long
continuance be adotned with all justice. Let the Emperor leave his son for
their Lord, and receive him as an associate to his Father, before they accept
him as a successor. Let the time run slowly, and only during the life of our
childrens children, wherein his subjects shall rank him amongst the number of
the gods.

CHAP. XXXII.
TOuch him nor O Fortune, Seneca^^ (...) and secret insinuatio^s.
neither employ thy forces against him, but in as much as thou art profitable,
suffer him to heal mankind too long traveled with sickness and misery,
permit him to restore and reestablish all that which the fury of his
Predecessor has shaken. Let this star ever shine that has enlightened the
world that was plunged in obscurity, and devoured in darkness. Let him
pacify Almany, give entry unto England, triumph both for his own, and his
Fathers victories. His clemency the chief of all his virtues, promises me
that I shall be one of the beholders; for he has not so humbled me, but he
may exalt me, what say I humbled? he has not only relieved, but he has
sustained me at such time as fortune had dejected me, and when as I was
headlong cast down to the ground, he has courteously and mercifully raised me
by his divine hand. He interceded to the Senate in my behalf, and has not
only given me life, but required it likewise; let him determine in what sort
he would have my cause estimated, either his iusti^e shall find it good, or
his clemency shall make it whatsoever befall me, be it that he knows, or
that he would that I should be innocent, it shall be^ always a bene^ite of
his toward me; Meanewhile the greatest comfort that I have in my miseries, is
to see his mercy spread over all the world, which when it has dug out many
after the ruin of so many years, and out of that very angle wherein I am
buried, and brought them to light, I fear not, nay more I trust, that he will
not leave me alone desolate. But he best knows the time wherein he ought to
comfort and relieve every man, for mine own part, I will endeavor to the
uttermost, that he may not be ashamed to succor me. How happy is thy
clemency O Caesar which has caused those that are banished to live in greater
assurance under thy government, then Princes did under Caligula? The banished
fear not, they expect not howerly for a Hangman to come and dispatch them,
neither are they abashed when they see the ships approach, as by thy favor
there is some measure in their adversity, so hope they for a more prosperous
condition, and they content themselves in some sort in the exile, because it so
pleases thee. Thou must know that the flushings of thy lightning are not to
be feared, but darted of set purpose, when those that are attainted therewith
reverence it.

CHAP. XXXIII.
To comfort with more effect he induce^h Caesar to persuade Polybius.
THis price therefore, who is the public solace of all men, has or else I am
deceived already recreated thy mind, and has applied greater remedies to this
thy so great wound: He has already confirmed thee every ways, and with an
exquisite memory has related unto thee all the examples which are proper to
enduce thee to moderate thy grief, and hy his ordinary ^loquence has
discovered unto thee all the precepts of Philosophy. A man therefore cannot
find out any who is more fitting to speak unto thee then he is. His words
will be of greater weight then mine, and shall be so much reuer^nced as so many
Oracles, which hy thy divine authority shall crush all the forces of thy
sorrows. The twenty four. The examples of greater men that have been af^^icted
should confirm our resolution.
Suppose therefore thar he speaks unto thee after this manner. Fortune has
not only made choice of thee to examplifie her cr^elty upon. There neither is
nor was any house in this whole world without some lament. I will ouerslip
common examples^ which although they are less, yet are they wonderful. I will
reduce thee to our Annals and publik^ Chronicles. See thou al these images,
which have filled Caesar's imperial hate^ there is not one of them that is not
touched with some calamity of his parents or friends, every one of these men
who by their virtue shall astonish the ages to come^ have been aggrieued at the
death of those that touched them near, or have been wi^h great sorrow lamented
by their friends after their death. What need I recount unto thee Scipio of
Africa, who during the time of his banishment was resolved of his brothers
death. This brother that had delivered his brother out of prison, could not
warrant him from death. All men saw how impatiently Scipio suffered the injury
that was done unto his brother whom he loved so much: for the same day that he
delivered his brother from the hands of the Sergeant: he presented himself as
a private man before the Tribune of the people, to obtain favor. Meanewhile
he endured the death of his brother, with no less courage then he had showed
in preserving his life. Shall I reckon up unto thee AEmitianus Scipio; who
almost at one time saw his fathers triumph, and the obsequies of his two
brethren? yet notwithstanding although he were very young, and but as yet an
Infaut, he endured this sudden ruin of his family as constantly falling under
the triumph of his father; as such a personage as he should do, who was borne
to that end, that Rome should not be without a Scipio, nor Carthage without
ruin.

^HAP. XXXIIII.
SHall I tell thee of the amity of the two Luculli that was dissolved by death?
Other examples^
Shall I reckon unto thee the Pompeis whom cruel fortune permitted not to
perish under one ruin? Sextus Pompey ouerliued his sister, by whose decease
the firm bonds of the Roman Empire, and the peace thereof were broken. He
ouerliued his brother likewise, whom fortune had raised to this end, that his
overthrow might not be less then the ruin of his father; yet after this fall
of his, he proved both sufficient to digest this sorrow, and to maintain a
war. Infinite are the examples on every side of brethren that have died one
after another, and I say on the contrary part, that scarsely shall thou find
two brothers that have lived so long as them both. But I will content my self
with the example of those of our house: supposing that no man will be so
deuoid of reason and judgment, who understanding that fortune has taken
pleasure to make Emperors weep, will complain that she has driven others to
sorrow. Augustus lost his dearest sister Octauia, neither did Nature take from
him the necessity of mourning, to whom she had destinated heauen^
contrariwise, this Prince afflicted with all sorts of death of those that
touched him nearest lost besides her his sisters son, who should have been
his heir. And left I should enter into a particular account of his sorrows,
he lost his son in laws, his children, his Nephews, and no man amongst all
mor^all men, had more feeling that he was a man then he did, whilst he
lived amongst men; yet notwithstanding his heart, the most peaceable that a man
might imagine, disgested so many bitter griefs, and so made himself
victorious not only over foreign nations, but also of his passions. Caius
Caesar the Nephew of mine uncle by the mothers side, even upon the entrance of
his youthly years, lost his brother Lucius most dear unto him, a Prince as
young as himself, during the preparation of the Parthian war, and received a
greater wound in mind then that was which afterward offenced his body, yet
endured he both the one and the other, both piously and stoutely. The Emperor
mine uncle by the fathers side, saw his younger brother, and my father die in
his arms, at such time as he was ready to enter the heart of Almayne, and he
subdued the most savage nations of the world, and made them subject to the
Roman Empire; yet kept he a measure in his sorrow, and gave order that others
should contain themselves, reducing the Army not only aggrieued but desolate,
and astonished, and who generally demanded the body of their general Drusus to
the Roman custom and manner in mourning, judging this that he was obliged
not only to observe the rules of military profession, but a measure in
bewailing the dead. He could not repress other men's tears, except first of
all he had restrained his own.

CHAP. XXXV.
See Plutarch in this man's life and behold a true pattern of inconstant
fortune.
Mark Anthony my Grandfather inferior to none but him, by whom he was
overcome, establishing the Roman Estate, and being one of the Triumuirate,
raised above all men, and (except his two companions) seeing all things under
his feet, heard news that his brother was slain. O insolent Fortune, what
pleasure take thou in procuring men's miseries. At that time when Mark
Anthony had the power of life and death amongst the Roman Citizens, his own
brother was commanded to death; yet endured he this so hateful a wound with
the same magnanimity of mind, wherewith he had endured all other adversities,
and his mourning was of this nature, that he solemnized his brothers funerals,
with the bloody massacre of twenty Legions. But to lay apart all other
examples, and to the end that I may suppress in my self other men's losses,
Fortune has assailed me twice in the death of my brothers, and I have twice
found this in my self, that I might be hurt but not confounded: I lost my
brother Germanicus, whom how entirely I loved, he may perfectly understand,
who thinks how much pious brothers love their brothers; yet so governed I my
affection, that I neither omitted any thing that might be required at a good
brothers hand, neither did ought that might be reprehended in a Prince. Think
therefore that the parent of the commonweal relates these examples unto
thee, and shows thee how nothing is sacred or unattained by Fortune, who out
of these houses durst lead our funerals from whence she was to receive her
goods. The twenty five, If death spares not the greater, why should she spare
the small.
Let no man therefore wonder, if Fortune behaueth her self cruelly or
unjustly: for can she acknowledge any equity toward private houses, or any
modesty, whose implacable cruelty has usurped upon the gods? Let us exclaim
against her not only in private but in public, yet will she not be changed,
her ears are deafened against all prayers and complaints. This was Fortune in
humane affairs, and this will she be; there is nothing that she dare not
attempt, nothing that she leaves untouched: she will forcibly enter thorough
all things, and according to her accustomed manner, without making any
difficulty to bear the dead into those houses, whereinto men enter by Temples,
and to hang those doors with black, which before times were adorned with
laurel.

CHAP. XXXVI.
The twenty sixth If the great ones of this world bear their losses patiently,
the lesser should follow their example.
THis one thing ler us obtain at her hands by vows and public prayers, except
as yet she has not resolved to confound all humane race.) That if with a
favorable aspect she continue as yet, behold the Roman name, that she will
be pleased to reserve unto herself and to all men, this Prince who was raised
to reestablish the decaying world: let her learn clemency of him, and by the
miledest Prince of all others be instructed what mercy is. So then thou
ought to considet all those of whom before time I have made mention, either
already received into heaven, or very nearly approach the same, and patiently
endure fortune, who stretches her hand to thee also, wherewith she attempteth
those likewise by name, by whom we are accustomed to swear. It behooves thee
to follow their constancy, and to sustain and surmount misfortunes, and as much
as may be lawful for a man to follow the steps of the gods. Although that
in other things there is a great difference betwixt men, by reason, that some
are more highly raised then others; yet is virtue planted in the midst o^ all
men and disdaineth not any man, provided that he think himself worthy of her.
Be careful to follow those who having any occasion to be displeased, because
they are cloased in, and visited so nearly, notwithstanding have thought that
fortune offered them no outrage in equalling them with other men, but that it
was the law of mortality, and thus were they neither vexed nor grieved, neither
have they showed any faint and effeminate hearts in such like accidents: for
not to feel a man's evils is the part of a beast, and not to endure them, is
not the part of a man, yet can I not (after I have ouerrunne all the Caesar's
from whom Fortune has taken their brothers and sisters) ouerslippe this man
whom we ate to draw out of the number of the rest) whom Nature has produced
and brought to light, to the general disgrace and destruction of all mankind,
by whom the Common weal was utterly overthrown, and reduced again by the
clemency of our merciful Prince. This Caligula that neither knew to grieve or
rejoice accordiug as it beseemed his dignity, when his sister Drusilla was
dead, Twenty seventh, The inconstant fury of Caligula in the death of his
sister, ought to teach wise men how to temper and govern their sorrows,
except they would have their minds rep^^ted unbridled.
retired himself out of the sight and conversation of all his Citizens,
neither was he present at his sisters obsequies, neither honored he her
according to her dignity, but retired himself into his Albarium? yet relieved
he the sorrow of these so hapless funerals, by hearing pleas, and other such
like occupations. What shame was this for the Roman Empire? The sport of a
Roman Prince that bewailed his sister, was to solace himself at dice. The
same Caius with furious inconstancy, sometimes suffering his beard and hair to
grow long, sometimes coursing along all the coasts of Italy and Sicily, not
following the ordinary ways, and never certainly assured whether he would
have his sister bewailed or deified: for at the same time when he reared
Temples and honors to her, he punished them by most cruel torments, who
sufficiently bewailed not her death: for no less intemperate showed he
himself in sustaining the shocke of these afflictions. as he was immeasurably
proud in his prosperities, for he swelled above humane measure. Far be this
example from every Roman Citizen, either to attenuate his sorrow by untimely
sports, or provoke them in soyling himself with odious and base uncleanness,
or to delight in other men's evils, and not in humane solace. Yet see thou that
thou change nothing of thy accustomed carriage, because thou have resolved to
love those studies, which most fitly extol a man to felicity, and most easily
lessen his calamity, and they are those that are the greatest ornaments and
solaces of mankind.

CHAP. XXXVII.
Twenty eighth. A special consolation to Polybius, declaring that v^rtuous
studi^s n^^des the grea^est sorrow^s.
NOw therefore drown thy self more deeply in thy studies: now enuiron them
about thee as the fortresses and bulwarks of thy mind, neither let sorrow find
any entrance in any part of thee: Publish likewise thy brothers memory in some
one monument of thy writings, for this is the only work amidst all humane
offices, which no tempests may hurt, no age consume: the rest that consist in
gathering and laying stones in marble monuments, or earthly tombs that are
raised to a great height, will not continue long, for they them selves will be
consumed. The monuments of the mind are immortal; bestow these on thy brother,
enshrine him in these. Thou shall always eternize him better by thy lasting
wit, then by bewailing him with fruitless sorrow. As touching that which
concerns fortune, altho^gh that for the present a man may not plead her cause
before thee (for all that which she has given us are hate^ull unto us for this
very cause, that she has taken somewhat from us) yet then will we speak of it
when time has made thee a more equal judge in her hehalfe, for then may
thou reenter into favor with her: for she has provided many things whereby
she may amend this injury, for many things will she now give, whereby she
may redeem the same: to conclude thou receiuedst that at her hands which she
has taken from thee, Use not thy wit therefore against thy self, Against
those that condemn sorrow, and what m^asure we ought to observe th^^ein,
neither accompany thou thy sorrow. Well I wot that thine eloquence can approve
those things to be great, which are but small. Again, it can lessen great
things, and bury them in obscurity, but let her reserve her forces to some
other purpose, and now let her employ them wholly in comforting thee. But
beware that this thing likewis^ be not unprofitable for thee; for nature
exacteth somewhat at our hands, an^ vanity strives to shorten it: yet never
will I entreat thee to give over sorrow wholly. I know there are some men more
obstinate and inflexible then prudent and courageous, who maintain that a
Wiseman should not b^e touched with sorrow. But these men seem to have never
tasted of such like disasters, otherwise Fortune had driven their proud wisdom
from them, and had compelled them though against their wills to confess the
truth. Reason has don enough, if she restrain the excess of sorrow, but to
have it wholly rooted out, no man ought either to hope or desire it. Let him
rather observe this measure, it neither falls into impiety or folly, and
contain us in that habit which becomes a quiet and no disturbed mind. Let
our tears flow, let them be stayed: let our sighs be drawn from the bottom
of our hearts; yet let them have an end. So govern thy mind that thou may
approve thy self to Wisemen, and to thy brothers. Labor to deserve that thou
may often times remember thy brother, to the end thou may magnify him in
thy words, and that by a continual thought and remembrance thou may
represent him unto thee. Whereunto thou may finally attain, if thou make
his memory pleasant unto thee, and not lamentable. For it is natural for the
mind to fly always from that whereto she returns with sorrow. Think upon
his modesty, think thou of his readiness in his business, his diligence in
executing them, his faithfulness in his promises. Let other men know, and do
thou thy self remember all his deeds and words. Consider what he has been
and what can be hoped that he shall be: For what cannot a man promise for
such a brother. This Discourse have I addressed unto thee in the bent sort I
may, having my spirit almost spent and dulled with sorrow, which if it be
scarce answerable to thy expectation, or seem to be too weak to medicine thy
sorrow, bethink thy self how hardly Latin words flow from him, whose ears
are tired with the rude and unpolished language of the Barbarians.

The End of the Book of Comfort.
OF CONSOLATION, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO MARCIA.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
MARCIA agracious and rich Matron, as it appears the daughter of AVLVS
CREMVTIVS CORDVS, a man famous both for his studies and writings, had a son
who died in his full years, for he was a husband, a father, and a Priest, and
already three years were past as appears in the end of the first Chapter,
since he died. I therefore gather that this book was published about the
beginning of CLAVDIANVS time, and not before. For it is scarce probable that
this METELLVS (for such was his name) was raised to honor in TIBERIUS time.
Under ^ATVS t^erefore, who out of some other acts of TIBERIUS, and namely
permitted (...) CRE^VTIVS writings to be read: which likewise is touched in the
first Chapter and therefore this c^nsolation could not be published before,
especially the grief being (...), and after three years space. Nay to him

CLAUDIUS, and after his exile^ It matters not much. Touching the Book, it is
one of his best, although it be not void of feminine flattery. There are two
parts thereof. In the former he prayseth her, and both by his own and other
men's examples comfort her until the (...) Chapter; in the latter he
descends to reasons, and first he alleges the common ^^ason that sorrow
profits nothing. Then that is unnatural, and rather is grounded on
tenderness, and inconsideration, because we foresee not that th^se things
which may be done, are futurely to succeed. And again, he produces the
examples of men and women. Then passes he over to the estate and condition of
those that are borne, to whom death is annexed, until the nineteenth Chapter.
Then offers he this Dilemma: That neither the mother nor he are (...) Of
the mother, in short, she is gracious, and only vexed by opinion. Of the
son diversely, he is in quiet: and delivery both from casualties and vices.
What if he had been inclined to those in so corrupt a City? that he was
therefore taken away in good time, and at last the Father CREMATIVS is in
person provided, comforting and animating his daughter, and inciting her with a
constant speech to regard and behold celestial and divine things.

CHAP. I.
EXcept I knew Marcia that thou were so far estranged from womannish
infirmity of mind, Seneca in this place intending to comfort Marcia in the
death of her son, proposes two things in this Preface. The one the
greatness of her courage in the death of her father. The other the good sh^e
did unto the Romans by producing his ^^stories, which testify that she
patiently endured such a loss.
as from other vices, and that every man observes thy manners, as it were some
ancient pattern of virtue. I durst not undertake to encounter with thy sorrow,
whereunto men are too willingly inclined and subject: neither had I conceived
any hope in a time so unreasonable, before a Judge so partial, in a crime so
hateful, that I could effect this, that thou should complain of thy
fortune: but the approved constancy of thy mind and thy virtue confirmed by
many trials, have animated me, and made me confident. It is not unknown in
what sort thou did behave thy self in the person of thy Father, whom thou
louedst no less then thou did thy children, except in this that thou
did not desire that he should not ouerliue thee, yet know I not whether
thou did wish it me or no. For a great piety permits it self some
thing, which are not answerable to good and laudable manners of life. Thou
hinderest as many as lay in thy power the death of Aulus Crenutius Cordus thy
father. But when he had discovered unto thee, that he had but one means to
escape from servitude, wherein he was detained by the vassals of Seianus, thou
fauouredst not his counsels, but sufferedst thy self to be overcome, and
secretly powredst forth tears, thou deuouredst thy sorrow, yet could not
conceal it with a merry countenance: and this in the age wherein it was great
piety to do nothing impiously. But as soon as the revolution of time
presented thee any occasion, thou broughtest him to light for the general good
of all men) the testimonies of thy fathers wisdom, who was put to death, and
exemptedst him from the grave by publishing and communicating those his books
unto the world, which that worthy man had written with his own blood. Worthily
have thou deserved of the Roman studies, for the greater part of them was
consumed by fire; worthily of posterity, to whom the incorrupted truth of
former occurrents shall be testified to the glory of that great man thy father,
who wrote them; worthily at his hands, whose memory shall flourish and live as
long as men are desirous to know the Roman affairs, as long as there shall be
any who will reflect and read the acts of antiquity, as long as there is any
that would know what a brave Roman, who seeing the yoke of Seianus upon his
neck, and his feet treading on the heads of every man, has bravely
discharged himself of that servitude, and showed that both in understanding,
soul, and hand he was a free man. Truly the common weal had suffered a
great loss, if thou had not brought this worthy person to light, who was
buried in oblivion, to let us see two worthy parts in him, to wit, his
^loquence and liberty: he is read, he flourishes, he is entertained in men's
hands and hearts, he fears no injury of time. But the heinous crimes of those
bloody butchers, who deserve memory for nothing but their murders, He
excuses the vehemency, he is resolved to use considering the vigor of
Mar^^as mind, the time past since her afflictions, and the contempt of those
cons^lations that have been ministered unto her.
shall be obscured. This greatness of thy mind, for bad me to look back
unto thy Sex, for bad me to behold thy countenance, which the continual
sorrows of so many years as it once clouded, it so now covers it: But
consider that I intend not to surprise thee, neither think thou that I will
s^eale away thy passions. I have refreshed the memory of thine ancient evils:
And will thou know that this wound also is cureable? I have showed thee the
cicatrice of as great a wound. Let other men therefore dally and flatter with
thy sorrows, I am resolved to combat with thy grief, and if thou will hear a
truth, I will dry up the current of those tears that have wearied and wasted
thine eyes, which rather now flow by custom then any desire or cause, which
may be done if thou favor those remedies which I present thee: if not, I will
do it against thy will, although thou retainest and entertainest thy grief,
which thou have reserved to continue in thy Sons place. But what end shall
there be? All things are attempted in vain. Thy friends are wearied with
talking with thee, thy Allies and other great personages know no more what to
speak unto thee, thy deaff-eares entertain no solace, although a man relate
unto thee that which thou have learned, and the goodly means and demeasnesse
that thy father left thee. These are words that stand thee in no use, but for
the time they are a speaking. The natural remedy of time likewise, which
appeaseth the greatest sorrows, has lost his power in thee alone. Three
years are already past, and yet the vehemence of this thy passion is no ways
moderated, thy sorrow renews and fortifieth it self daily by course of time
it has gotten possession; yea, and is grown to that height, that thou
reputest it a shameful thing to dismiss it and give it over. Even as all
vices get possession and pre-eminence in the heart, except they be oppressed,
even then when they appear. So likewise these perplexities and miseries,
enraged against them selves, do feed them selves at last by their own
acerbitie^ and sorrow becomes a depraved pleasure of the unhappy mind. I
could have wished therefore that I could have ministered a medicine to this
sorrow in the beginning, a slight remedy had been sufficient to extinguish
the fury of this passion upon the first approach. Where now since the griefs
are inueterate, the remedies ought to be more vehement. For those wounds are
easily cured which are but newly inflicted; then are they ^eared, s^arched, and
endure the touching; yea, they are hardly healed when they are putrified, and
that time has brought them to an inue^erate ulcer. I can not now to please
thee, handle thy rebellious wound gently, I must press out the poison, and
cleanse it with sharp medicines.

CHAP. II.
Entering into the matter, he ^^ginneth to ^o^fort her by (...) Fi^^l of Octauia
which made her s^lf^ (...), (...).
I Know that all those men, who will admonish any man, begin with precepts and
end in examples; yet must I alter this course. For some are to be handled in
one sort, some other in an other. Some there are that will be persuaded by
reason, to some we must oppose the names and authority of great persons to
stay their minds, that are astonished at the luster of things. I will set
before thine eyes two famous examples of thy Sex and of our time; Of one woman
that gave her self over to grief, of an other that having had no less loss
but far greater damage, yet suffered not her sorrow to reign long time over
her, but sudainely settled and pacified her mind. Octauia and ^iuia, the one
the sister, the other the wife of Augustus. Lost each of them a Son, having
both of them hope that one day they should have been Emperors. Octauias Son
was called Marcellus, on whom his Uncle and his wives father began to build
them selves, in committing to his hands the affairs of the Empire, a young man
of sharp understanding, of a great mind, modest and meruailously continent,
and considering his years and fortunes, very laborious, enemy of delights,
and ready to undergo all that which his uncle would lay upon him, or (if I
may so speak it) build on his back: Neither failed he in his choice, for
this young man was sufficiently enabled to undertake all sorts of burdens. His
mother seeing him dead, ceased not all her life time to mourn and weep,
neither would she admit any consolation, nor likewise suffer any by any means
to dissuade her from her pensive thoughts. But intending this one thing, and
wholly fixing her mind thereupon, such was she all her life time as she was
at his funeral. I say not that she durst not rise, but that she refused to
be raised, judging it no less then a second orbitie to surcease her weeping.
She would have no Image of her dearest Son, neither would she listen to any
that made mention of him, she hated all mothers, and was most mad against
Liuia, because that felicity that was promised her Son, seemed to be
translated to hers. All her pleasure was to live in darkness and solitude,
she no ways thought on her brother, rejecting those Verses that were
composed, and those honors which famous men had invented, in memory of
Marcellus. In brief, she shut up her ears from all comfort, she retired her
self from all solemn Offices, and hating that too much resplendent fortune of
her brothers greatness, she hid her self, and if I may so speak it, buried
her self alive. Although her own children, and their childrens children came
flocking about her, yet would she not give over her mourning robe, offering
outrage in this respect to all those that were her Allies, because she
thought her self alone when they remained in safety.

CHAP. III.
LIVIA had lost her son Drusus, who should have been Emperor, and was at
that time a great Captain. ^. Liuia contrariwise disgesteth the death of her
son wisely and patiently whereby she was esteemed
He had already entered very far into Germany, and fixed his Ensigns
there, where it was scarcely known that there were any Romans. In this
expedition he died a Conqueror, and during his sickness his very enemies
gave him great honor, not daring to promise themselves that good which was
expedient for them: To this death which he endured for the Commonweal, there
was joined a multitude of Roman Citizens, of peoples that were Allies, and of
all Italy (who had conducted his body through the Cities, and Provinces which
were peopled by the Romans, who had made great moan for him) as far as Rome,
as if Drusus had entered the same in triumph. His mother, that for a long way
had followed his body, and being extremely grieved, by reason that as many
Piles as she saw flaming through out all Italy, so many times seemed she to
behold her dead Son, had not the means to enjoy his last kisses, nor hear
his sweet and latest words, yet incontinently when the obsequies were
performed, and that she had closed him in his Tomb; she buried her sorrow
with him, without aggrieuing her self more then either her gravity, or
Augustus greatness, or the equity of the cause required. Mean while she
ceased not to publish her sons praises in every place, to represent him unto
her self both privately and publikly; to speak most willingly of him, and
take pleasure in those that recounted his praises, when as no man could make
mention of any other, but incontinently the remembrance of Drusus made her
perceive: Choose therefore which of these examples thou think most probable;
if thou will follow the first, thou cuttest thy self off from the number of
the living, thou will teach both thine own and other men's children, and
wanting him, thou will make all mothers afraid that meet with thee. Thou shall
disclaim thine honest and lawful pleasures, as ill beseeming thy condition,
and shall require naught else but to be sequestered from company: in brief,
thou shall loath thine own life, because it ends not as quickly as thou
desire. Besides, which is a thing estran^ed, and unworthy thy mind, which
has a far contrary reputation, thou will make it known that thou will not
live, and that thou can not die. But if thou fashion thy self according to
the example of this great woman, which is more mild and moderate, thou shall
not veil bonnet under thy sorrow, neither macerate thy self in afflicting thy
self so much: for what folly is this (poor woman as thou art) to drown thy
self in sorrow, and to increase thy miseries? maintain in this accident the
virtue, and moderation which thou have approved in all the rest of thy former
life; for if there be any conueniency in sorrow, when thou have always the
name of this young man (most worthy of rest) in thy heart and in thy mouth,
thou thy self shall place him in a happy abode; if he appear before thee
merry and joyful as he did during his li^e.

CHAP. IIII.
The th^^d, So^^ow should not be ^xt^eame, or perpetual.
NEither will I persuade thee by more forcible pr^cepts, command thee to endure
humane accidents with a mind more then humane, that upon the very day of the
funeral thou should dry up the tears of a mother. I will do thee justice.
The question is between us, whether thy grief ought to be great or
perpetual: I assure my selfe^ that the example of Liuia, whom thou have
inwardly both known and honored will please thee more then the other. She
calls thee to counsel her. She in the first favor (whom as miseries are
most impatient and furious) gave an ear to the counsels and comforts of the
Philosopher, Areus that attended her husband; and confessed that it yields
her much more comfort then the Roman people, whom she would not digest by
her sorrow, more then Augustus who was troubled, who had lost one of the stays
of his Empire (nor was to be d^iected by the sorrow of any of his) more then
Tiberius his son, who effected this then, that in that biter and displeasing
funerals to all nations, A pro^fe h^re^f by a (...) which Areus (...) to

found nothing missing but the number of one. This as I think, was the
induction of that discourse which he used in regard of this woman, that was
so settled in her opinions. Hitherto lived, and as nearly as I could con^eiue,
in as much as I was an inward Counselor to Augustus thy husband, (who not
only knew thy public sayings and actions, but also the secret motions of thy
mind, thou have carefully endured that no man should find any thing that might
give him cause of exception: Neither have thou observed this only in affairs
of importance, but in the smallest things thou have taken care, lest thou
should do any thing that might be afraid of report, which freely
consumes the actions of the greatest in this world. Neither think I that
there is any thing that is more worthy those that are in high place, then to
pardon many things, and to require pardon of nothing. Thou are therefore to
observe in this thing thine accustomed manner, not to limit any thing
whatsoever, that thou would have done less or otherwise.

AFter this, I desire and entreat thee, that thou show not thy self froward
and intractable to thy friends. The ^ourth. We must accustom our selu^s in
time to yield a w^ll^^g care, to those that speak of them whose decease we
have bewa^^ed in bitte^ ^eares.
For thou art not to be ignorant, that all these know not how to behave
themselves, whether they shall speak any thing before thee of Drusus, or
nothing, lest either the oblivion of so noble a young man should do him
injury, or his memory and mention wrong thee, when we are drawn apart, and
are assembled together; we magnify his deeds and speeches as much as in us
lies, and he deserves, but in thy presence we make no mention whatsoever:
you are therefore deprived of a great pleasure, which is the praises of thy
son. When I assure my self thou would eternize, if thou had the means,
although it cost thee thy life. Suffer therefore, nay more, command men to
speak of him, and yield thine care to the name and memory of thy son,
think it no irksome thing (as other men do) who in such cases interpret all
things to the worst that is spoken to them; if a man propose thee some
consolations; thou inclinest now to the other side, and forgetting all the
goods thou have received, thou regardest the worser face of fortune, wherewith
she most affrighted thee. In stead of casting thine eyes on the conversation
of thy son, upon his pleasant and gracious entertainment, upon his childish
and wanton flatteries, upon the advancement of his studies, thou securest to
be enchaned to this last appearance of life, and as if it were not monstrous
enough of it self, thou heapest up together whatsoever may be possible. Long
not I beseech thee after so unmeasurable a glory, which may make thee being
miserable, amongst miserable.

when as life exhausteth her course with a full fail. For a peaceable sea and
a favorable wind approve not the sufficiency of a Pilot. There must some
storm encounter us that may approve the mind. And therefore discourage not thy
self, but contrariwise stand firm in thy place, and endure every burden that
is laid upon thee, being only affrighted with the first assault: there is
nothing that so much confounds fortune, as a resolute mind. After this he
showed her her son in safety, he showed her her Nephews, to recompense the
loss of her son. At that time Marcia thy affairs were in ^and, Areus sat
by thee, and comforted thee under another name. But think Marcia that death
has taken from thee more then ever was taken from any mother (I will not
flatter thee, or lessen thy loss) if tears may conquer the destiny, let us
vni^e our tears, let us spend every day in sorrow, let the sleeples night
consume it self in sadness, let our hands violate our torn breasts, and let
our nails imprint our sorrow in our faces, The sixth, Since that sorrow is
unprofitable, because death is not moved thereby, we ought to refrain sorrow.
let discontent exercise and extend it self in all sorts of cruelty. But if
the dead are recalled by no tears, if Fate be immovable, and everlastingly
fixed, no misery is changed, and death possesses whatsoever he has taken
away; let sorrows cease because it is vnprofi^able. For which cause let us
govern our selves, neither permit this passion to transport us beyond measure.
It is a shame for a Master of a ship to suffer his helm to be beaten out of
his hands by the billow, to neglect his Sails that are shattered in the wind,
and leave his ship to the mercy of a tempe^t, but he even in shipwreck is
to be commended, who holds his helm in his hand, though the seas swallow
and sink him.

CHAP. VII.
The seventh, We must keep a measure in sorrow.
But yet there is a natural inclination in us to bewail those whom we love,
who denies it as long as it is moderate? for there is a necessity that presses
us, and retireth, and astonisheth the most constant hearts, not only at such
time as our friends die, but also when in this life by diverse occasions they
are separated from us. But that which opinion adds, is more then Nature
commands. Consider how unbridled the desires of bruit beasts are, Nature
teaches it not.
and yet they are short. Cowes for a day or two low after the Bull, neither
does the wanton and wandering course of Mares last long. Wild beasts after
they have sented the foot of their young ones, and have searched them
sometimes amidst the forest, when they return back again to their empty
dens, in a few days surcease their rage. Birds with great chattering fly
about their empty ne^ts, but in an instant they are appeased, and keep their
accustomed flight. There is no creature that so long time bewaileth the want of
his young ones as man, who accompanies his own grief, and is not only
touched with the sense thereof, but also with the conclusion; he has taken
with himself to torment himself thus and so long time. The eighth, I^ is the
proper^y of ^^w^rdes and d^generate p^^s^ns to torment themselves much.
And to the end thou may know, that it is an unnatural thing to be broken
with sorrows; first one and the same loss is more hurtful to women then men,
to barbarians then civil men, to the ignorant then the learned. But those that
have received their forces from nature keep the same tenure in all things.
That which is diverse, is not natural: Fire at all times will burn the
Inhabitants of all Cities, as well men as women. Iron will show it self in
every body that it has power to cut upon. Why? by reason that nature which
does nothing in vain has given them this property. One man feels poverty,
pain, loss of children in one kind, and that man in another kind as custom
teaches him, and as a feeble opinion of fearing of those things that are
terrible, makes him either impatient or constant.

CHAP. VIII.
Again that which is natural decreaseth not by delay, but time consumes

be she never so obstinate against remedies, yet time which is the most
effectual means to mitigate fury, will weaken it. True it is Marcia, that as
yet thou art very much afflicted, and it seems that thy ^orrow (not so
v^hement a^ at first, but settled and obstinate) has contracted a callosity,
and is wholly heardned. Yet will time draw this from thee by little and little,
as oftentimes as thou sh^lt exercise thy self in other things, thy mind shall
find some relief. Now thou have a guard over thy self: b^t there is a great
difference whether thou permittest or command thy self to mourn. How far
more beseeming is it for thine honest and venerable manner of life to give an
end to thy sorrow, then to expect that it should end of it self? neither
ought thou to attend the day wherein sorrow should abandon thee against thy
will. But begin thou first to give him pasport.

WHence grow we therefore so obstinate in our complaints, if this that is

be not by the commandment of nature. It is because we think that evil
shall never encounter us, except then when we feel the same: but as if we
had a letter of exemption, and that we were entered into a way more plain then
other men; the sinister accidents of our neighbors cannot teach us that our
danger is as great as theirs. We see so many dead bodies pass before our
doors, and so many mourners that attend them with bitter tears, but in stead
of thinking our death, we shape out in our thought a man's garment for our
young children, we run to the wars, and already husband the inheritance
and succession of our fathers. We see so many rich men suddenly become poor;
yet never sinketh it into our hearts, that our riches may as easily slip out of
our hands, as these did from them. Our fall therefore must be the greater,
because we feel not that we are subject to slip, but then when we are
fallen and brought unto the lowest. Those things that are long time foreseen,
assault us more leasurly. Will thou know how thou art exposed to all strokes,
and that those weapons that have wounded thee, have be^ne enforced against
thee? Suppose that being disarmed, thou mountest upon some wall, or some place
well defenced by the enemy, hard to be s^aled, and that thou expectest to be
rescued, The ele^enth, A^flictions that a^e for seen are sl^ght.
suddenly wounded, that tho^ make a certain account that those arrow^s,
those stones, those darts that fly in the air ar^ aimed at thee, when thou
shall see that they fall on one side, or behind thy back, then may thou
cry; O fortune thou shall not deceive me, neither shall thou surprise me,
either secure or negligent. I know thy designs, thou would have stricken
me, but have wounded another. But what man is he that ever considered his goods
as if they should perish? who is he amongst us that durst be so bold, as to
think on his exile, his poverty or sorrow? who is he, that if he be
admonished to think upon his parents security, refuses it not as a direful
and ominous presage, and that prays not that this mishappe may sooner fall
upon the head of his enemy, The tw^lfth, That which may befall any man may also
be fortune us.

When it is come, let us endure it.


or of that his untimely Counselor and admonisher? I thought not that this
should come to pass, Think thou that which thou know is incident unto

foresee that we could succor. He takes away the power of present evils, who
foreseeth the future.

a worthy, noble and fair wife, and other such goods as depend on the
inconstancy of mutable fortune, are but foreign and hired ornaments, which are
not given but lent us to deck the Theater wherein the Scene of our life is
acted, and which ought to be returned to those to whom they appertain. Some
of these must be brought home the first day, others the next day; few shall
persevere, and continue to the end. We are not therefore to esteem them, as if
they were our own, they are but lent us. The use of them is ours, according as
it pleases him to whom they appertain. We ought to have in a readiness
those things which were given us for a certain time, that when they be called
for, they may be restored without grudging. Wicked is that debtor that
slandereth and iniureth his creditor; so then we ought to love those in such
sort, who are issued from us, and whom according to the law of nature we
desire to leave in this world after us, and do not amiss to wish that we may
die before them, as if we had no promise that they should survive us or
continue with us. Oftimes the manner is to be admonished to love them as
transitory things, yea as such as are already parting from us, and let us
possess all that which fortune has given us, as a thing that must vanish in
an instant: take your pleasure of your children, and let them have the fruition
of yonr selves, and without delay enjoy all that pleasure you affect. Let no
man build upon to morrowes content, I have given you too long, delay nothing
of that hour in which we are. We are to make have, death attends at our
backs, and all this number that attends us shall be scattered in a moment.
In less then a watchword, The fourteenth, It is Gods ordinance that has
limited our life which we ^^ll depart witha^l, when it pleases him.
all these secreties shall be dispersed. All things are vanished from us
miserable men; you have not the spirit to live in following life; if thou
complaynest the death of thy son, the fault is in the time wherein he was
borne, for at that time was he destinated to die. He was given thee upon that
condition, and as soon as he came out of thy womb, he ran after this
arrest. We are under the rigorous and unconquered power of fortune, and endure
our good or evil according to her pleasure: she afflicts, outrageth and
tormenteth our bodies; some burns she with fire, either to ruin them, or to
heal them: some shall she cast into the sea, where after they have strugled
with the waves in stead of casting them on the shore of the sand, she shall
cast them into the belly of some great fish. Othersome there are that she
shall detain long time betwixt life and death, having tired them by diverse
sorts of sicknesses; and likewise tied them to an unconstant and lascivious
mistress, that makes no account of her slaves, but sometimes tormenteth and
strikes them, sometimes flattereth and rewards them. What need we
complain of the parts of our life. The whole is lamentable; new incommodities
shall urge thee before thou have satisfied the old: you ought therefore to
moderate your selves in those things, especially, which you impatiently suffer,
applying one part of your thoughts to the apprehension of evils, an other to
the sense of them.

t^^^h of the ^ar^ will drive her from him, and always his nourishment
corrupt^^h and humbles him. Do we remember that death which is necessary to
all m^n, strikes at one man? was not this building raised to the and to be
ruined? His odors, sauors, lassitudes, watchings, humors, meats and other
things, without which he could not live, are the occasion of his death. On
what side soever he turns himself, he incontinently espieth the marks of
his infi^mity. Every air is not good for him, the change of waters, an
vn^^customed breath of wind, and other light and hurtful causes make him
(...) that he is sickly, rotten, broken, and that he began his life with
tears: Mean while^ what troubles does this catife creature cause? how many
thoughts ham^ereth he in his head being forgetful of his own condition? His
thoughts wander upon immortalities and eternities, he disposes of the
affairs of his third and fourth generation, and whilst he thus swelteth after
these long apprehensions, death lays hold on him, and that which we call age
is but a small revolution of years.

CHAP. XII.
TEll me O Marcia, if thy sorrow have any ground or reason in it, whether it
respects thine incommodities or these of thy son? Whether art thou moved in
the loss of thy Son, Sixteenth. Whether it be that those that are deceased,
have been in joy little or long time, with us their condition i^ such that we
have no occasion to bewail them.
because thou have received no pleasures by him, or for that thou might have
enjoyed greater if he had lived longer? If thou say that thou have received
none, thou will make thy loss more tolerable. For men less complain, the
miss of those things that have given them neither joy not pleasure. And if
thou confess that thy Son has highly contented thee, thou art not to
complain, because he is taken from thee, but to give thanks for that thou
have enjoyed. Thou have likewise reaped great fruit of thy labors in his very
education, except happily they, who carefully nourish young whelps and birds,
and such like frivolous delights of the mind, conceive some pleasure in the
sought touch and wanton fawning of mute beasts, and that education it self is
not the fruit of education, to those that nourish their children. Although
therefore his industry has profited thee nothing, neither his diligence has
preserved thee, that his prudence has not employed it self to do thee good,
yet that which thou have had and loved is the fruit of thy labor. But it might
either have been longer or greater? Yet art thou dealt better with all, then if
it had not happened at all; for if choice may be given, whether it be better to
be happy for a small time or never, it were better for us to enjoy those goods
which must quietly pass from us, then to have none at all. Had thou rather
have had an unthrift, who had nothing good in him, but the title and name of a
Son, or this thy Son who was of so good a nature? The young man was quickly
prudent, quickly pious, quickly a husband, sudainely a father, quickly a
magistrate or officer, The Seventeenth, The more excellent the goods we have
are, the more willing should we be to restore them because the divine
providence is not accustomed to allow us a long possessio of that, which from
the beginning he has perfected.
and sudainely a Priest; In brief, all good things appeared sudainely in him.
Scarcely does long and great goods befall any man. There is no felicity that
endures long, and attaineth his period, but that which increased by little and
little. The immortal gods intending to give thee a Son for a little time,
did presently give thee him, such as he might have proved by continuance.
Neither can thou say this, that thou only art chosen by the gods to enjoy
thy Son a little while. Cast thine eyes every way amongst thy acquaintance
and strangers, thou shall every where meet with greater. Great Captains and
Princes have tasted hereof. The Poets have not exempted the gods themselves,
and I think they have thus made men belieue^ that the gods were dejected, that
they might pacify and lesson the sorrow we conceive in the loss of our
nearest friends. Pry I say into every place and thou shall name me: no house
so miserable that shall not find solace considering another that is far more
afflicted and miserable. Assuredly I have not so ill an opinion of thy manners
that I would think that thou will more easily endure thy cross, if I should
reckon up unto thee a great number of mourners. A troop of miserable men, is
an envious kind of solace, yet some will I reckon up unto thee, not to the end
thou should know, that this is wont to happen unto men, for it is a
ridiculous thing to collect the examples of mortality: The eighteenth Other
men's afflictions should teach us to digest our enemy.
but to the end that thou may know that there were many who have lessened
their adversities by bearing them patiently. I will begin with a most happy
man, Lucius Scilla lost his son, neither did this casualty weaken his malice
or his extreme rigor both toward enemies and his citizens, neither was it
the cause why he might not seem to usurp that surname securlie which he
took upon him after the loss of his son, neither affraide of the hatred of
men on whose miseries his over fruitful felicities consisted^ neither of the
gods displeasure, whose crime it was that Scilla was so happy. But what Scilla
was, let us leave amongst those things that are uncertain, yet will his
enemies confess that he took upon him arms happily and gave them over
discreetly. And in regard of that whereof we now speak, it appears that it
is no great evil which attainteth and attaineth those that ar^ most happy.
And no less let Greece admire that father, who during the time of his
sacrifice receiving tidings of his sons death, only commanded the musition
to hold his peace, and took the crown from his head, and afterward duly
finished the rest of the sacrifice.

CHAP. XIII.
THis did Puluillus the chief bishop, Other examples of Zenopho^ and Puluillus.
who at that time as he held the post, and dedicated the Capitol, received
tidings of his sons death, and yet without making show of that was told unto
him, he pronounced the solemn hymme of the pontifical consecration, without
interrupting the same with any sighs, and hearing the name of his son, he
caused Jupiter to be propitious and favorable to the city and common weal.
Would thou think that this sorrow which upon the first day, and the chiefest
assault could not draw the father from the public altars and solemn
dedication, should ever have ceased? undoubtedly Puluillus was worthy of a
memorable dedication, worthy of a high priesthood, who desisted not from
worshipping the gods; no not when they were displeased: yet the same man as
soon as he came home, and had satisfied his grief with tears, and powered
forth some lamentations, and having fulfilled those offices which were
accustomably due unto the dead, returned to the Capitol with a merry
countenance. Paulus AEmilius about that time of his so renowned, triumph,
wherein he led before his chariot the king Perseus as his prisoner, and given
two of his sons to be adopted into another famelie, saw the two others
buried, whom he had reserved to himself? what were these two think thou,
when as Scipio was one of these that was given to be adopted? yet the Roman
people beheld Paulus chariot void and yet he unmoved, yet declaimed he, and
gave thanks unto the Gods, because they had granted him his wish. For he had
besought them often times, that if for so great a victory some greater
incomoditie might befall him, it might rather redowne to his private, then the
public damage. See thou with how great a mind he bare it? he gave them
thanks for the death of his children. Could such a change move any man more? he
had lost in one instant his solaces and his stays, and yet Perseus had not
that credit to see Paulus AEmilius sad or distressed.

CHAP. XIIII.
The four^teenth, Examples of Lucius ^ibulus.
WHy should I lead thee through so innumerable examples of great men, and
complain their wretchedness? as if it be not a harder matter to find out
happy men? what house is it that has continually stood at one stay in all
respects? wherein there has not happened some disaster and perturbation?
Consider the years one after another, and mark those that have been Consuls,
and if thou will Lucius Bibulus, and C^ius Caesar, and thou shall see betwixt
these two companions that were mortal enemies, one and the same fortune.
Lucius Bibulus a man more honest then stout, had two of his sons slain at
one time. They were both of them a scorn to an Egyptian soldier; so that the
Father had more occasion to bewail the indignity they had received at his
hands, then the loss of his children; yet Bibulus that during the whole time
of his Consulate, had kept house by reason of the evil carriages of his fellow
Consul, receiving tidings of this accident, came abroad and performed his
wonted and public offices. What could he do less then bestow one day on his
two sons? so quickly ended he his sorrow for his children, who had bewailed
the Consulate a whole year. Caius Caesar when he had ouerrunne the whole
Country of England, and could not contain his felicity within the Ocean, had
tidinges that his daughter was dead, that by her loss drew the public peace
into danger: he had represented before his eyes his son in law, Cnaius
Pompey, who could not endure that any other should be reputed or held more
great in Rome then himself, and who would have opposed himself against all
those which pretended to be advanced, although it were not to his
disaduantage^ yet notwithstanding all this, Caesar which three days executed
that charge which was committed unto him in being General, and overcame his
sorrow so soon as he was wont to overcome all other things.

CHAP. XV.
WHy should I relate unto thee the funerals of the other Caesar's, I will only
tell thee this, The sixth example of Augustus.
that in my judgment fortune having so rudely assailed them, has given by
this meane^ a profitable instruction to the whole world; for she makes them
see that the children of the gods, and such as should engender gods, have not
their own fortune in their hands as they have other men's. Di^^s Augus^us
having lost his children and nephews; in brief the whole Progeny of the
Caesar's supported his desolate house by adoption; yet endured he these losses
as temperately as if he had been already de^fied, and as if some one had done
him injury, if he should have come and complained of the Deities. Tiberius
Caesar both had lost him whom he begat, and him whom he had adopted, yet
notwithstanding^ he himself pronounced the funeral Oration, in praise of his
son in the public place of declamations, and constantly stood in the sight
of the dead body, and had but a veil between them to conceal the body from
the sight of the high Bishop. Although the Roman people wept, he changed
not his countenance, and made S^ianus know who stood fast by him, that he was
armed with patience to endure the loss of his children. See thou not this
great number of men of note, enriched with so many gifts of the mind, and so
many honors both public and particular, whom death (that deuoureth all
things) spares not? nay further, this tempest extends it self over the
whole world; and without election destroys all things, and makes them as her
own. Command every man to give a reason, and thou shall find that no man has
entered into this world but to forsake it.

CHAP. XVI.
I Know what thou will say. Thou have forgotten that thou comfortest a woman,

and only tellest us of the examples of men: but who dare maintain that
nature has showed her self partial in women's be half, and has restrained
their virtues. Believe me they have the same vigor and free faculty of mind,
as men have to apprehend that which is honest, and if they accustom
themselves, they endure both labor and sorrow as equally as they do. Good
gods in what City speak we this? In that where Lucretia and Brutus delivered
the Romans from the captivity of Kings: we must acknowledge our liberty to
proceed from Brutus; and we are indebted to Lucretia for Brutus. In that
wh^re we have eternized Caelia the virgin in the number of the most valiant of
her time, by reason of her undaunted boldness, when in despite of the enemy she
swam over Tiber. Her statue on horseback, planted in the midst of that famous
and sacred street, reproacheth our young men that are mounted in their Coaches,
and enter in that sort into that City, wherein we have made presents of horses
unto women: but if thou will have me set thee down an example of women that
have endured the death of their friends constantly, I will not beg it from
door to door, I will produce out of our family the two Corneliaes. The first
was Scipioes daughter, and mother to the Gracchi. She had twelve children that
all of them died before her. As touching ten of them, whom Rome neither
apperceiued living or dead, if I may so speak it, the loss might in some sort
be borne. But in respect of those her two sons Tiberius Gracchus and Gnaius,
(whom though men admit not for peaceable men, yet must they acknowledge them
for honorable Personages) she saw them slain and unburied. And when as some
one in comforting her called her poor and desolate mother: Never (says she)
will I call my self unhappy who have bred the Grac^hi. The other Cornelia lost
Liuius Drusus her son a young. Gentleman, The nineteenth, He answers a new
complaint of Ma^^ as, and shows her what occasion she has ^o comfort her
self, considering these comfo^ts that are le^t behind, and this is it that we

helps, when he might take away all.
well borne of great hope, and one that followed the example of the Gracchi,
who having le^t some suites of great importance imperfect, which concerned the
commonweal, was slain in his own house, and no man knew who did the deed^
yet Cornelia endured the bloody and unrevenged death of her son, that she
her self presumed to be so bold, as to publish certain Edicts in way of
consolation to the people. Now Martia shall thou become friends with fortune
again, if thou consider that she has darted the like arrows against thee,
as she did against the Scipios their mothers three children, and Caesar's
themselves. Life is replenished and broken with diverse accidents, which have no
long repose, and almost no truce. Thou have had four children Marcia: but they
say that there is no arrow that falls in vain that is shot against a troop
of the enemy. Is it so great a wonder that so great a company could not be
ouerpassed without envy or loss? But in this was Fortune more unjust, because
she not only took away thy children, but made choice of them, yet say thou
not that he is wronged that has his equal part and portion with his Lord.
Fortune has left thee two daughters and their children, and of all these she
has only borne away thy son, whom thou so much bewaylest, having forgotten
the other that was dead before him. Thou have by this son two daughrers who
resemble their father, if thou bring them up and nourish them against thy
heart, they are two mighty burdens; contrariwise if thou take pleasure in
them, they will be great comforts unto thee. To this end brought he them
thee, that seeing these daughters they should refresh the memory of thy son,
and not of thy sorrow. The husbandman when he sees his trees ouerturned, which
either the wind has rent up by the root, or the violent tempest has broken
by a violent wherry, nourishes the rest of their siens, and presently sets
the seeds of those plants he has lost, and in a moment (for time is as
violent and headlong in increases, as she is in losses) they spring more
flourishing then those that were lost. Substitute now these daughters of
Metillius in his stead, and fill up the void place. Relieve thou our sorrow
with a double solace. Truly this is the nature of mortal men, that nothing is
more pleasing then that which is lost, we are more partial to those that are
left, and more desirous of those that are taken from us. But if thou will
estimate how much fortune spared then, euee then when she was angry with thee,
thou shall know that thou have more then comforts, witness so many Nephews
and two daughters.

but now I see without any difference, and after the same manner, that both
good and bad are indifferently distressed: yet is it a grievous matter to lose
a young man whom thou have brought up, and that now would be both an help and
ornament to his father and mother. Who denies that it is a grievous matter? yet
is it humane. To this were thou borne, that thou should lose, that thou
should die, that thou should hope, that thou should fear, that thou
should disquiet both thy self and others, that thou should fear and
wish death, and that which is worst of all, that thou should never know in
what estate thou were. If a man should say to him that would embarke and sail
to Siracusa: Before thou set sail, consider all the commodities and
incommodities of thy voyage, then enter thou the ship. These are the things
that thou may wonder at. First of all thou shall see Sicily divided from
Italy by a little arm of the sea, whereas in times past they were of one
continent. The sea in that place makes sudden insults; Under an excellent
description of a voyage by sea in ^ Sicily he shows to what goods and evils
our lives are allotted, to the end in prosperity to prepare us to adversity.
Dividing Italy frem Sicily.
Then shall thou see (for thou must ouerpasse swiftly that dangerous ingate of
the sea) that gulf of Charibdis so renowned amongst the Poets, which as long
as it is free from the southern winds is peaceable and calm; but if any wind
breath from that place, she swalloweth ships in her deep and devouring
billows. Thou shall likewise see the fountain of Arethusa, so celebrated
amongst the Poets, wonderfully clear and pure in the bottom and bubling up
water that is very cold, whether thou drawest it from the spring, or where
she steals from under the earth, when she loses her self, and passes
under the sea without intermixing it self loosing her sweetness amiddest the
salt water. Afterward thou shall arrive in the securest haven that Nature
ever made, or that humane industry has accommodated for the security of
ships, so assured and calm that the fury of most greatest tempests cannot
any ways afflict or increase the same. Thou shall see the place where the
Athenian Navy was discomfited, when so many thousand men were lost, and locked
up in that renowned prison, so immeasurably high and builded of hewn stone.
After this the great City of Syracusa, and her towred walls of greater extent
then are the Confines of diverse Cities, and no day without Sunshine. But
after you have seen all these commodities^ on the other side, there presents
it self a most hot and unwholesome Summer time, which corrupts the benefits
that the Winter had caused. There shall thou find the Tyrant Dionisius sworn
enemy of liberty, Justice, and laws; desirous of government, and domination,
and of life also. After his banishment; some he will burn, othersome he will
beat, these upon a fleight occasion he will command to be beheaded, to
satisfy his lusts; he shall make use both of male and female^ and amongst the
loathsome troops and attendants of kingly intemperance, it shall be a small
matter at one time to commit pollution both ways. Thou have heard what may
inuit thee, and what may withdraw thee; therefore either sail onward or stay
behind. If after this relation any man should say that he would enter
Siracusa: can he justly complain against any man but himself, who should not
have fallen unto these miseries, except willingly and wittingly he had sought
them out? Thus speaks Nature to us all. I deceive no man, thou if thou
bear children may have them fair, may have them deformed, and if
happily thou bring forth many, one of them may as well be a Protector of his
Country, as an other a Traitor. Think not that they shall mount to that high
dignity, that no man dare speak evil of thee for fear of them. But propose
this to thy self, that they may be so dissolute and licentious ^that every
one will curse them. Nothing hinders them to acquit themselves of that
devotion which they owe unto thee^ neither are they forbidden to praise thee,
Act dispose thy self, as if thou would lay them on the Beer, either
children, young men or old men; for years concern this matter nothing at
all: because there is no funeral, that is not accompanied with sorrow, and
attended by the parents. If after these conditions, which have been proposed,
thou buriest thy children, thou can in no sort complain against the gods who
have promised thee nothing.

CHAP. XVIII.
An application of that he has spoken of the voyage to Syracusa^
NOw therefore let us apply and compare all the course of our life according to
this example; I have told thee since thou art determined to visit Siracusa,
what thing may please thee, and what offend thee, and suppose that now when
thou art to enter life I come and give thee this counsel. Thou art to enter a
City, that is common both to gods and men, comprehending all things, obliged to
certain eternal and irreuocable laws; where the caelestiall bodies perform
their course without repose or lassitude. There shall thou see innumerable
stars, and wonder to see one Planet that enlightneth all things; the sun that
by his daily course divides the spaces of day and night, equally
distinguishing the year into Winter and Summer. There shall thou see the
nocturnall succession of the Moon borrow her milder and remisser heat from
her brothers beams; sometimes hidden, and straight again ouerlooking the
whole earth with a full face, admirable in her increases and decreases, being
no one day the same, but altered continually. Thou shall see the fiery Planets
observing different courses, and shining oppositely the one against the other
in their Spheres: on their so sudden courses depend the destinies of nations,
great and lesser effects do follow, according to the benignity or malignity of
their aspects. Thou will admire to behold the clouds that are gathered, the
rains that fall, the oblique flashes of lightning, and the thunder in the air;
when tho^ shall cast thine eyes upon the earth that are already glutted with
the sight of celestial wonders; thou shall be entertained with an other form
of things and wonderful in an other kind. On this side the extent of spacious
Planets that the eye cannot apprehend them, on that side the tops of
mountains envying the clouds, charged with snow the downfall of rivers, the
floudes issuing from one and the same sowrce, running from east to west, the
forests nodding their bows upon the tops of the highest mountains, so many
woods with the beasts that inhabit them, and such variety of melodious birds.
After these the diverse situation of Cities, the nations separated the one from
the other by the difficulty of passages, the one retiring themselves to the
mountains, the other spared themselves along the rivers sides, lakes, valleys,
and marshes: the harvest forwarded by the husbandmans hand: the trees fruitful
without assistance of man, the gentle fleating of breaks and of the lawndes,
the pleasant gulfes, the commodious havens, so many Isles dispersed in the
Ocean, which by their situation distinguish the seas. I speak not of pearls
or precious stones, nor of gold that runs amidst the sands of the most
violent rivers, nor of those fires that are enkindled both in the earth and in
the seas, nor of the Ocean, which is the bond of Nations which separateth them
with a triple straight, having otherwise her perpetual flux and reflux. When
his billows are laid, and steal along without any agitation of the winds,
thou shall see terrible ^ishes, and of incredible greatness: others more
heavy which swim along under the conduct of others, some very ^wift, and
more sudden in their turninges then a vessel with many Oars, others
breathing out water to the great dangers of those that are Passengers. Thou
shall observe on these Seas certain Vessels that go to seek out new found
Lands, thou shall see that humane boldness would know and discover all
things and thou thy self be a looker and the greatest Aduenturer in the
voyage thou shall learn and teach with some tending to the commodity, other
some to the ornament and others to the government of this life. But on the
otherside in this city there shall be a thousand plagues of body and soul,
wars, thefts, imprisonings, shipwrackes, heat, could, terrible changes of the
air, and cruel punishment of our bodies and of those whom we love most; but
finally death which thou know whether it shall be sweet and easy or
accompanied with tortures and grievous punishments. Deliberate with thy self,
and balance carefully which of these two thou will entertain, if thou have
part of those goods that are mentioned before, thou must issue likewise through
the midst of those miseries. Thou will answer that thou will live and why not?
nay rather I think that thou pretendest not to approc^ such a thing whereof
thou can not endure that any one should pull any portion from thee! Live
therefore as it becomes thee, no man say thou has demanded our advice.
Our parents have consulted about us, who whereas they knew the condition of
life very well, have brought us up unto that end.

CHAP. XIX.
But to return to consolations, we must first of all see what the infirmity
is whereunto we ought to apply a remedy. Secondly in what manner. The One and
twentieth, They that are deceased are not absent, neither have abandoned us,
but have gone before us, and we shall suddenly follow after them.
He that mourns is moved with the loss of him whom he loved, and this
appears tolerable in it self. For we bewail not those who during their
life time are and ought to be absent from us, although we be deprived of
their presence and the aid they might yield us. It is therefore opinion that
tormenteth us, and all affliction is as much to be prised as we have rated it
at. The remedy is in our own hands. We judge that our friends, parents, and
near kinsfolk are absent, and we deceive our selves? we have dismissed the^;
nay more we have sent the^ before with a purpose to follow them. The two and^
twentieth, Often times it is better for us to be alon^ then in company.
This likewise moves him that mourns; I shall want one to defend me, and
protect me from contempt. To use a scarce probable but yet a true comfort. In
our city want of children gets us more grace then it takes from us. And
so much has solitude enabled old age that was wont to destroy it; that some
feign hatred of their children, some forswear them, and willingly make
themselves desolate, I know what thou will say, my detriments move me not, The
three and twentieth, Since those that are dead were created to die, we should
not weep for them.
for he is unworthy of solace that takes it heavily that his son is departed
from him, as if he had lost a slave, and that considers in his son any
other thing then his own person. What therefore moves thee Marcia? whether
art thou agreeued because thy son is dead? or for that he lived not long? If
because he is dead, thou should have been always in grief, for thou
know always that he should die. The four and twenteth, Death is the end of
miseries, But this must be so understood that it is intended only in respect
of the body and till the time assigned wherein the world shall have an end.
Think this that the dead are afflicted with no evils, those things that make
hell terrible unto us, are but fables, we know that the dead are not enfoulded
in darkness, that they are not in prison. We believe not those floods
flaming with fire, neither the lake of forgetfulness, nor the judgment seat,
neither that there are any guilty in that so large liberty, neither likewise
that there are tirants. These are poetical, and thus have they tormented us
with vain terrors. Death is both the solution and end of all sorrow, beyond
which our evils pass not that reposeth us in that tranquillity wherein we lay
before we were borne. If a man will be sorrowful for those that are dead, let
him have compassion likewise on those that are unborn. Death is neither good
nor evil. For that may be either good or evil which is any thing, but that
which of it self is nothing, and reduces all things to nothing, betrayeth us
to no fortune. For those things that are good and evil have relation to some
matter. Fortune cannot detain that, which nature has dismissed, neither can
he be a miserable man that is no man. Thy son is exempted from those bands
wherein he was in bondage. He is entertained by a great and eternal peace, he
is not afflicted with the fear of poverty, the care of riches, the
prouocations of lust attainting the mind by p^easures, he is not touched with
the envy of another man's felicity, neither are his modest ears beaten with any
slanders, he beehouldeth neither public nor private slaughters, he takes
not care for that which is to come, neither depends he on events which tend
and incline always from evil to worse. At last he is stayed in such a place,
from whence nothing may drive him away, and where nothing affrighteth him.

CHAP. XX.
The ^i^e and twentieth, He prosecuteth his discourse wh^rein he proves more
perticularly the commodities of death.
O How ignorant are men of their miseries, who praise not death which is the
best invention of nature, which whether it include felicity, or repe calamity,
or terminateth sacietie or lassitude of old age, or carries away youth in his
flower whilst better things are hoped for, or cutteth off childehood before he
undergo dangerous courses; The end of al, the remedy of many, the wish of
diverse men, deserving better of no men, then of those to whom she came before
she was called. She dismisseth the slave in dispight of his Lord, she
vnchaineth prisoners, shakes off the fetters of those men whom tirants hold
captive. She shows banished men that have always their hearts and eyes fixed
upon their country, that it is a small matter amongst whom they are laid and
buried. She when as fortune has divided common goods unequally. And has
given to two brothers different things, makes them equal. She it is that has
never done any thing according to another man's liking, she it is in which no
man has felt his humility, ^he it is that has obaied no man, she it is Marcia
whom thy father desired. She it is I say that brings it to pass that to be
borne is no punishment, that causes me not to loose my courage when I am
threatened by infinite accidents that makes me preserve my mind entire and
master of himself; I know where I must arrive; I see on this side Iibbets of
diverse fashions, some hanging their heads downward toward the earth, some
thrust through with stakes, some having their arms stretched out upon the
gallows. I see cords, strapadoes, and tortures for every member of the body,
yea likewise I see death. On the oth^rside, I perceive furious enemies, and
proud citizens, but here likewise see I death. The six and twenti^th, One
death dis^hargeth us of ^a^y sorrow^s.
It is no hard matter to serve, when as at suth time as a man cannot endure his
master, he may attane his liberty by stepping one foot forward, against the
injuries of life I have the benefit of death. Think how much good a fit and
commodius death affords us, and what evils have befallen many by living too
long If Pompey that honor and support of our common weal had died at Naples,
undoubtedly a man might have said, Behold the prince of the Roman pleople is
deported. But now the adiection of a little more time made him fall from the
height of his dignity. He saw his legions slain before his face, and what
miserable remainders were these of that battle, where the Senators led the
army to their end, that their General might be saved? For anon after he saw
the Egyptian murderer, and presented his so venerable body to a soldier
that slew him. And had his life been saved, he had repented himself. For what
a shame had it been that a King should have given Pompey his life? If Marcus
Cicero had died then, when he delivered himself from that massacre, which
Catili^e pretended to execute upon him and Rome, that Commonweal that was
defended by him, had called him her protector and safeguard. Afterward had he
followed his daughter, then might his death have been esteemed happy, he had
not seen those threatening swords that were brandished over the heads of his
Citizens, nor the goods of those that were murdered, given to the murderers,
in such sort that riches were cause of their deaths, who possessed them, he
had not understood that those goods that were taken from Consuls were sold at
outcries; nor of the murders, nor of the spoils which were recompensed out
of the public treasure, nor of the wars and rapines of three as bloody as
Catiline. Had the sea swallowed up Cato when he returned from Cyprus, with those
goods which the King had bequeathed by his will to the Roman people, or had he
perished with all that silver which he brought with him, which was afterward
employed in the maintenance of civil war, had he not died happily? Surely he
had carried away this honor with him, that no man had or durst do any fault
in Catoes presence. But now the adiection of a few years constrained this man,
who was borne to maintain both his own, and the public liberty to fly from
Caesar, and to follow Pompey. The seven and twentie^h, That no man dies too
soon.
No evil therefore has untimely death brought to Metillius. Nay more, he is
thereby exempted from all evils; yet died he too soon and too young. First
presuppose that he lives yet, and consider how little time is allotted man, in
regard of the years of his life. And what is this? We are placed in this world
for a moment of time, and shall in less then an instant dislodge from the
same: and having entered thereunto upon this condition, we have always our eye
fixed on that place whither we must tend: I speak of our years which fleet
away with an incredible swiftness. Examine how many years, Cities have stood,
and thou shall see how little while they have lasted, yea even those that most
glory in their antiquity. All humane things are frail, and scarce occupy
any place in this vast extent of infinite time. We say that all this earth,
with the people thereof, these Cities, rivers, and that sea which incloseth
them, is but a point in respect of the universe. Our life is less then a
point, if it be compared with all that time which is past, and is to come,
which has far greater extent then the world, considering that time so
oftentimes turns and measures himself in this so great inclo^ure of the
same. What avails it us then, to extend that which being brought to his full
extent, will be almost as much as nothing? In one kind we have lived enough,
and long enough, if it suffices us. And if thou live as long as I can
desire, and that therein old age be extended so far as thou may make
reckoning of ninety or of an hundred years: yet if thou will fix thy thought
upon all the time of eternity, there will be little difference betwixt the
shortest and the longest life: if considering how many years every one has
lived, The eight and twentieth, No man dies before his time, because he has
lived as much as he ought.
if thou compare them with those wherein he has not lived. Again, he died not
untimely, for he lived as long as he should have lived: for there was no
overplus of time wherein he should have lived longer. The age of old men is not
alike, no more is that of beasts. Some creatures are a weary of life after
fourteen years, and this is their longest age, which to a man is but the
first. Each one has a different faculty of living. There is no man dies too
soon, who was not to live longer then he lived. Every man's time is prefixed,
it shall always continue where it was settled; neither shall either diligence
or care advance him farther: he knows that he breaks his brains, and
loses his labor that pretends the contrary. Thy son has run his race,
and has attained to the prefixed end of his life. Thou art not therefore to
load thy self in this sort. He might have lived longer. His life was not
interrupted, and fortune never crossed the course of his years. Every one is
paid that which is promised him: the des^inies are carried according to their
proper vehemence: they neither lengthen or shorten the time: in vain are they
besought or solicited. Every one shall have as much as the first day of his
life has assigned him. From that time he began to see the light, he has
entered the way of death, and approached: destiny those years that were added
to his youth were s^olne away from life: The nine and twen^^^th, ^e are all in
error, there is no man more estranged from (...) th^n another.
we are all in this error, that we think that none but old and aged men are
near unto death, whereas infancy, youth, and every other age l^adeth us
thereunto. The Fates ply their business, they steal from us the apprehension
of our death; and to the end she may more easily steal upon us, she masketh
her self under the name of life. Childehood carries away infancy, youth
rauisheth childehood, and old age youth: but if thou calculate well these
decreases, they are as many decreases and losses.

CHAP. XXI.
The thirtie^h, It is ^^ly Go^ that k^ew^^h when it i^ ^^pedi^n^ ^or v^ ^o
leau^ our li^^s.
THou complainest Martia, that thy son lived not so long as he might, but how
know thou whether it were expedient for him to live longer, or mo^e
profitable for him that he died thus? What man can thou find at this day,
whose affairs are so firm and well assured, that he has no cause to fear
that which is to come? Humane a^^aires steal and slip away. Neither is there
any part of our life more declining and incertaine, then that which pleases us
most. And therefore the most happy ought to wish for death; because amidst this
inconstancy and confusion of things, nothing is certain but that which is
past. Who could assure thee that this fair body of thy son, and the
marvelous care that he had of his honor, maintained in the midst of so
many eyes of a City, founded and confounded with dissolutions and excess,
could in such sort warrant himself from sickness, that until old age his
beauty and seemlinesse should have remained untouched?

CHAP. XXII.
The one and (...), No ^an know^th his d^stiny, (...) ^he (...) adui^^d cannot
fore^^e that which is t^ come to pass^; we ought not therefore to bew^^^e those
that d^^ in you^h.
PRopose unto thy self a thousand infirmities of the soule^ for many excellent
spirits have not maintained unto their old age, that hope that we had
conceived of them in their youth; but oftentimes they have degenerated. In
their latter days therefore consequently, and to their greater shame, they
have addicted themselves to palliardise, which has made them soil the fair
beginnings of their life. Or being plunged in drunkenness and gourmandise,
their principal care has been to know what they should eat or drink. Add
hereunto the burnings, the ruins, shipwrackes, the operation of Surgeons, who
cut off their members, pull out their brains, th^ust their hands into their
entrails, and heal their privy parts, not without excessive pain: after
these, banishment, for thy son was no honester man then was Rutillius: and
prison, sure he has not bin a wiser man then Socrates: and with the stab of a
Poinard that was voluntarily buried in his breast, sure he was not more
virtuous then Cato. In considering these things thou shall find that they are
happy whom nature has retired in good time into a place of security,
considering that in the end they could not receive any other reward of their
life, then that or some such like. There is nothing so deceitful as man's life,
nothing so tray^^rous. No man would have accepted life except it had been
given at unawares: and therefore it is a great happiness not to be born, and
another happiness that death is near to shorten that life, A (...) of Cromutius
Co^dus constancy and death, yet let men temper their judgment: there is a law
about Stoicall when that must reform these resolutions.
and put us in that estate wherein we were before we lived. Call to thy
remembrance those wretched times, wherein S^ianus made a present to Atrius
Sec^^dus his Clyent of the confiscation of thy fathers goods^ which he took
from him by reason of some confident speeches he had uttered: for thy father
could not hold his peace, se^ing that men intended not only to make us
subject to S^ianus, but that by degrees he mounted to the sovereign authority.
It was decreed that a statue should be raised for him in Pompei^ Theater, which
the Emperor caused to be reedified because it had been burned. Cardus
exclaimed, That then the Theater was wholly ruinated. And what heart would not
have burst, seeing S^ianus sit upon Pompeis Cinders, and a wicked soldier
enstalled in the place of a great Captain? Notwithstanding the sta^u^ was
reared with a subscription. On the other side those Masties that this cursed
S^ianus nourished with humane blood, to the end that they should be private to
himself, and enraged against all others, began to bark on every side against
thy father, who thought not of them. What should he do^? To maintain himself
in life, it behooued him to humble himself before S^ianus; to die, to have
license from thee his daughter. But it was impossible for him to pacifi^
S^i^^^s, and his daughter less; yet at the last Cordus resolved with himself
to deceive his daughter. Having therefore taken his bath, the more easily to
deceive her, he retired himself into his chamber, as if he intended to take
some re^ection before his supper; and having dispatched his servants and pages
about some business, he cast some morsels of meat out of the window, to the
end it might be thought that he had eaten. Afterward, as if he had
sufficiently nourished himself in his chamber, he abstained from his supper,
continuing the same course the second and third day: upon the fourth day the
infirmity of his body discovered what he meant. Embracing thee therefore he
said, My dearest daughter, I have concealed nothing from thee during my whole
life, but this, I am entered the way of death, and have almost attained the
half: thou neither should, nor can recall me back again. After he had
spoken this, he commanded the lights to be carried away, and retired himself
into an obscure place. This act of his being discovered, every one was glad
that the prey was taken out of the throats of those greedy Wolves. His
accusers by S^ianus incitation, presented themselves before the siege of the
Consuls, complaining that Cordus was a dying, to the end to obtain permission
to withdraw him from that whereunto they had compelled him; so much were they
aggrieued that Cordus should escape their fingers. The question was upon a
matter of great importance, whether those that were adjudged to die should be
hindered from procuring their death. Whilst this matter was in debating, and
the accusers go and come, Cordus was delivered from their claws. See thou
not, Marcia, how unexpectedly the reuolutions of wretched times do steal upon
us? Do thou weep because one of thine must needs die? Thou see how hard a
thing it was for him to get this privilege.

CHAP. XXIII.
The two and thirtieth, Our bodies are the prisons of our souls, which
conceive great content to get their recourse to heaven.
BEsides this, that every future thing is uncertain, and the way to the worse
is more assured: it is easier for us to ascend to heaven, whereas our minds
are quickly dismissed from humane conversation. For they have gathered less
dross and ordure, and being delivered, before which were confused and
overwhelmed with the meditation of earthly things, they are more light to fly
back again to their original; and more easily ouerpasse all that which may
hinder them. For never did great wits take pleasure to remain in their earthly
prisons, they are glad to forsake them, and break through them: these so strict
limits are displeasing to them, being accustomed to raise themselves above the
heavens, and to contemn from above all humane and base things. Thence is it
that Plato cries, That a wise man's mind is wholly intended upon death, that
this he wills, this he meditateth, that he is always possessed with this
desire, when he beholds exterior things. What thoughtest thou, Marcia, when
thou saw a young man replenished with aged wisdom, a mind triumphing over
all pleasures, reformed, deuoid of vice^ rich without avarice, raised to honor
without ambition, desirous to have pleasures without dissolution to keep him
long time? What soever has attained his perfection hastes to his end. Perfect
virtue retireth it self and vanishes from our eyes: neither do the fruits
expect their Autumn, that are ripe in Summer. The fire the more it shines,
the sooner is it extinguished, and that lasts longest which being mixed with
a moist matter and hard to kindle, and smothered in smoke, shines through the
smother. For that which nourishes it, as it were by constraint, is the cause
it continues more long time. So good spirits, the more famous they are, the
shorter they live. For whereas there is no place of increase, there decrease is
the nearer. Fabianus said, and our predecessors also have seen it, that there
was an infant at Rome, as great as an absolute man, but he lived not long, and
every one that had judgment was of opinion that he should die shortly. For he
could not increase so much in years, as he had attained by his stature. So
maturitie is a token of imminent overthrow, and the end aproacheth where
increases are consummed.

CHAP. XXIIII.
Begin to estimate him by his virtues, The three and thirtieth, He that has
lived virtuously, ought not to be bewailed in his departure out of this world,
where the longer he had stayed, the more might he have been corrupted.
and not by his years. He has lived enough, he was left a pupil, and until
the fourteenth year of his age he was under the government of Tutors, but
always under his mothers custody: when he had a house of his own, yet would
he not leave thine. Being a young man, both in stature, beauty, and other
strength of the body, borne to be a soldier, he refused warfare, because he
would not leave thee desolate. Consider Marcia, how many mothers there be in
diverse houses, that see their children very little. Think you that those
mothers, whose sons follow the wars, lose in respect of them whole years,
and live solitarilie? then shall thou know that there is much time remaining
thee, in which thou have lost nothing. Thy son never departed out of thy
sight, he framed his studies in thy presence, showing himself of a most
excellent spirit, but it was accompanied with a modest fear, the which has
buried many perfections in diverse men. He was one of the goodliest Gentlemen
that a man might behold, yet behaved he himself with so great temperance and
modesty, that amiddest so great a troop of men-corrupting women, he gave no
occasion of suspicion: and whereas some of their impudence had attempted so far
as to tempt him, he blushed and was angry with himself, because he had
pleased. This holiness in his manners was the cause, that so young as he was,
he was thought worthy to be entertained amongst the number of those that
intermedled with those things that appertained to religion, and that by the aid
and assistance of his mother. In contemplation of these his virtues so behave
thy self, as if he were more conversant with thee now then ever. Now has he
nothing to withdraw him, he shall never put thee in care, or cause thee to
sorrow, and all the grief thou have conceived for so good a son is finished:
the rest being exempted from casualties, are full of pleasures, if thou know
how to make use of thy son, and if thou know that which has been most
precious in him, thou have but lost the Image and resemblance of him, although
it resembled him not rightly. For he is eternal, and for the present in better
estate then ever, despoiled of foreign incombrances, and at his full liberty.
These bones that thou see wreathed about with nerves, this skin that covered
us, this countenance, and these ministering hands, and those other members that
enclose us, are the bonds and fetters of the soul which is dejected, obscured,
infected, and hindered from knowing the truth of those things that appertain
unto her, and distracted with error. She has a grievous combat with this
flesh, to the end she may not be made captive and slave unto it. She extends
and raises her self to the place from whence she was sent: there is her
eternal repose, where in stead of troubles and confusions of this world, she
shall see nothing but that is clear and pure.

CHAP. XXV.
THou have no cause therefore to run unto thy sons sepulcher. The four and
thirtieth, The body is not the man but the soul, which leaves nothing of her
self upon the earth.
There lie his bones and ashes, the worser part of him, and most troublesome
unto him, and are no more parts of him then his raiment and other couertures of
his body. He is fled away wholly, and is departed wholly out of this world,
without leaving any thing of himself upon the earth: and afterward having
made a little pause above us, to cleanse him from those spots that were
remaining in him, and to shake o^f the rust of this corruptible life, he has
been carried to far higher places, where he conuerseth with the happier
souls, and has been entertained by that holy company of Scipioes, Catoes,
and others that have contemned this life, and now enjoy a full liberty by the
benefit of death. There Martia thy father embraces his nephew (although that
there al be parents) joyful to see him enlightened with a great brightness,
and teaches him the courses of the neighboring Stars, not by conjecture,
but as one that is truly expert, and leads him willingly into the secrets of
Nature. And as he that shows the singularities of an unknown City, is an
agreeable guest to that stranger that has not seen them: so is this
domestical interpreter welcome to his nephew, that examineth the causes of
celestial things, and takes delight to pry into the secrets of earth. The
five and thirtieth, We ought not lament those, that with out comparis^n are
more happy out of the world, the in the world.
For he has a singular contentment to behold from on high that which he has
left. Behave thy self therefore in such sort, O Marcia, as if thou were in the
presence of thy father and thy son, now such as thou know them, but
without comparison more excellent and highly raised. Be ashamed to estimate
them, so as if they were in some abject and contemptible estate, bewail not
them who are happy, and who have attained through ^ree and spacious fields to
the place of eternity. They are not hindered by intercourse of seas, neither
by high mountains, nor by deep valleys, nor by the dangerous straits and
quicksands of the sea. Their way is easy every where, they may change, and end
them easily, the one teach the other, and are intermixed with the Stars.

CHAP. XXVI.
For conclusion and confirmation of all that which is past^ before ^e induces
Marciaes father to discou^r the joys of th^se that are dead, and too Stoically
speaks he of the end of ^he world. ^augh at the absurdities, pity his
ignorance, embrace the best.
Think then, O Marcia, that thy father (who before time had credit with thee,
as thou had with thy son) addressing himself unto thee, from the
celestial tower speaks thus. But not with that thought wherewith he deplored
the civil wars, and caused them ever to be detested, who made up the rowles
of those who were proscribed, but with a sense as far more clear, as he is
more highly raised. Daughter, why so long time remainest thou in discomfort?
Why art thou so long time blinded in the ignorance of the truth? to think that
thy son has been hardly dealt withal, in that being weary of this life,
he has retired himself amongst his ancestors. Know thou not with what
storms Fortune disturbeth all things? how little favor she shows, except
to those, who have not in any sort frequented with her. Shall I recount unto
thee by name those Kings that should have been most happy, if death had more
maturely taken them from their instant evils? or those Roman Captains, who
wanted nothing of their greatnesses, if somewhat had been diminished of their
years? or those noble and famous persons, who have yielded their necks, and
expected the stroke of their soldiers swords? Behold thy father and thy
grandfather. The one fell into a murth^rers hand, that took away his life. I
offered my self to no other men's hands, and forbearing my meat, made it
known, with how great a mind I had written. Why is he so long time lamented
in our house, who died most happily? We are altogether united together, and see
that you that are alive are environed with profound darkness. There is nothing
amongst you that is to be wished for, nothing excellent or worthy: but all
things are humble, heavy, and incertaine: neither see you but a little parcel
of our light. Shall I tell thee that ^eere are no wars, nor battles fought by
land or sea, that Parricides are neither imagined nor thought upon here, that
our Courts are not con^used with plea^, bu^ that our days are perpetual, that
nothing is done in obscurity, that our minds are simple, our hearts open, our
lives laid open to every one, and that all ages and events are manifest? I
took delight to collect togeth^r all the adventures of a whole age, in a
corner and remote place of the world, and such act^ons as were attempted by a
few. Now may I see so many ages, the course and carriage of so many years, and
whatsoever time is past. Here may I behold those Kingdoms that are rising,
and those that ^all to ruin, the ouerturne of mighty Cities, and new courses
of the seas. For if it may yield thee any comfort to understand the secrets of
common destiny. I tell thee, that nothing that stands shall continue
steadfast: age shall destroy and carry away all things with it, and shall play
her part not only amongst men (for how slight a portion are they of Fortunes
power?) but also in places, countries, and parts of the world. So many
mountains shall she suppress, and enforce others in another place: she shall
sup up the seas, and turn rivers; and breaking of the commerce of Nations,
shall dissolve the society of mankind. In other places she shall devour
Cities with horrible yawning of the Earth, and shake them with Earthquakes:
shee^ shall cause pestilent exhalations to arise from the earth, and shall
cover the inhabited countries with deluges of water, killing every creature,
drowning the whole world, and with vast fires shall terrify and burn all
mortal men. And when the time shall come, that the world shall cease, to the
end it may be renewed again: these things shall beat and break one another,
and all things set on fire^ all that which now shines by an artificial
brightness, Stoicall conclusions, praise God that has given thee a better
light.
shall be consumed by one and the same fire. We also that are blessed souls
and partaker^ of eternity, when it shall seem good unto God to warpe these
things once again, when all things shall be confounded; then we who are but a
small part of this great ruin, shall return into our ancient elements. O
Marcia, how happy is thy son, who already knows all these things.

The End of the Book of Comfort.
OF CONSOLATION, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA TO HIS MOTHER HELVIA.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
THis Book was written during the time of his exile, which was about the first
year of CLAUDIUS reign (in the year since the City was builded DCCXCIIII.)
by the suggestion of impure MES^ALINE. This public Harlot objected against
him, that he had committed adultery with IVLIA GERMANICVS daughter, and
charged SENECA therewith. Of this have we spoken in his Life. Now therefore
being banished into Corsica, he comfort his mother, and shows her how he
broo^eth his misfortune constantly, and that she should do no less. He wrote
it not presently upon the beginning of his exile, which the Preface testifies,
but the last of the first years, or the beginning of the second. But this
wrote he now, when he was in the vigor and maturitie of his judgment, being
somewhat more then forty years old. And therefore his writing is answerable,
full of confidencie and eloquence. Perfect in style and structure, and more
orderly disposed then all the rest. I dare say it carries away the Palm from
all other books. He makes two heads of this his Consolation. Thou must
neither be sorry ^or my sake, nor for thine own. Not for my sake, for none of
those which the common sort repute for evils, as Change of place, Poverty,
Ignominy, Contempt, are evils, and thus orderly proves he till the fourteenth
Chapter. Neither must thou be sorry for thine own sake, for there are two
things that may af^lict thee, either because thou have loct some help and
comfort by me, or because thou can not endure my want. The first belongs
not to thee, because thou art not ambitious, neither ever did boast of the
grace and power of thy children. Neither ought the other, because thou were
always constant above thy sex. Thou have suffered many miseries, endure this.
Employ thy self in the study of wisdom which will further thee. Turn thy
self to my brothers, and of thy nephews by them and me, thou art not alone,
nor leadest a solitary life. This will both serve and delight thee. Turn thy
self likewise to my sister, which will prove both a comfort and example unto
thee. And he concludes his Book with her praises.

CHAP. I.
I Have already oftentimes undertaken this resolution (most dearest mother) to
comfort thee, He proposes diverse reasons why he deferred to comfort his mother.
and oftentimes have I contained my self. Many considerations moved me
thereunto. First, I supposed that I should despoile thee of all sorrow, i^
being unable as yet to suppress thy tears, I should in the mean space wipe
them away. Secondly, I assured my self that I should have more authority to
excite thee, if first of all I had conformed and confirmed my self.
Furthermore, I was afraid that if I had not mastered Fortune, she would have
trodden under foot some of those whom I most loved. I therefore endeavor
howsoever, in laying my hand on mine own wound, to creep forward and bind up
yours: notwithstanding there were some things on the contrary side that
crossed this my resolution. I knew well that it behooved me not at the first to
encounter with thy sorrow, when it was most vehement, for fear lest my
consolations should incense and afflict thee the more. For in infirmities and
sicknesses, likewise there is nothing more pernicious, then untimely remedies.
I expected therefore, whilst thy sorrow had weakened and disheartened it self,
to the end, that being mitigated and confirmed, by delay to sustain remedies,
it might suffer it self to be comforted and cured. Moreover, after I had
turned over all the monuments of those happy wits which they had composed to
pacify and moderate sorrow, I found not any example of such a man who had
comforted his friends, when as he himself was bewailed by them. So then I
remained perplexed in this new accident, and was afraid lest my endeavor, in
stead of proving a consolation, should become a renewing and cause of furth^r
grief. Besides this, had not that man need of new words, not borrowed from
vulgar and ordinary dis^ourse, that lifting his head from the Beer, should
vndertak^ to comfort his friends? But it cannot otherwise be, but that the
greatness of a grief that exceeds all measure, should utterly deface the
ornament and choice of words, when as oft-time it stops and cloaseth the
mouth. Yet howsoever I will endeavor, not in respect of the confidencie I
conceiu^ in mine own wit, but because I may serve for a most assured
consolation, because I propose it my self. My hope is, that since thou
would vouchsafe me any thing that I should require, that thou would do
me this favor (although that all sorrow is rebellious) to suffer me to pre^ixe
some limittes to thy discontent.

CHAP. II.
The sum of his discourse is, that since his mother has approved her self
courageous and a conqueror in other afflictions, she should not give place to
this.
BEhold how much I usurp upon thine indulgence. I doubt not but I shall be as
powerful with thee as thy grief, which notwithstanding is a passion that
wonderfully mastereth the afflicted; neither will I suddenly attempt to charge
him, I will first defend his cause, I will discover all things whereby he is
provoked, and cut up those things that are already cured. Some man will say,
What kind of consolation is this, to revive long buried evils, and to discover
unto the understanding all his adversities, that can scarcely endure the
presence of one only? But let this man think that those afflictions that are
so cross and pernicious, as they surmount their remedies, are oftentimes cured
by their contraries. And therefore will I present sorrow with all her own
attendants, and will not make a palliatiue cure, but I will ^eare and
scarrifie: what shall I get by it? That thy invincible spirit that has
ouer-mastered so many miseries may be ashamed to shrink at one wound in a body
that has so oftentimes bin cicatrized. Let them therefore weep and mourn
longer, whose delicate minds have been weakened by long felicity, and are
quickly d^iected upon the motion of the slightest miseries, but let them who
have spent their whole years in calamity, endure the most grievous assaults,
with a confident and immovable constancy. This one good has continual
infelicitie in it, that finally she hardneth those whom she tormenteth
ordinarily. Fortune has not given thee any intermission, but has exercised
thee in most grievous sorrows, nay, she has not spared thee on the very day
of thy birth. Thou did loose thy mother as soon as thou were borne, nay,
even in thy very entrance into the world, and as soon as thou wert^ as it
were, abandoned to this life. Thou were brought up under thy stepdame, whom
thou by all obsequiousness and piety (as much as could be expected from a
natural daughter) compelledst to be thy mother; yet none there is that has
not paid dearly to find out a good stepdame. When thou expectedst the
arrival of thine uncle by the mother side, a man both virtuous and valiant,
thou did loose him. And lest that fortune should make thy misfortune more
slight by delay, a month after thou buriedst thy dearest spouse, by whom thou
had three sons. In the height of thy sorrow these mournful tidings were
brought thee, even then when thy children were absent, as if all thy miseries
had been reserved till that time, to the end that thy sorrow might have no
means of relief or refuge. I pass over so many dangers, so many affrights
that incessantly assaulted thee, and which thou have endured. Into the same lap
wherein before time thou have dandled thy three little Nephews, thou have
afterward entertained their dead bones. Twenty days after thou had
solemnized the obsequies of my son, who died enfolded in thine arms, and
attended by thy loving kisses, thou heardest the news that I was banished.
Thou were as yet unexercised to bewail the living.

CHAP. III.
I Confess that this later wound is one of the most grievous that thou have
ever felt, That although this accident be grievous, yet Heluias constancy so
much approved before both can and may resist that.
and that it has not only scratcht of the skin, but has pierced into the
depth of thy breast and entrails. But even as young Soldiers bemoane
themselves overmuch for a slight wound, and are as fearful of the Physicians
hand as the Surgeons razor, where contrariwise they that are old Soldiers,
although they are thrust through, do patiently and without groaning suffer their
arms and legs to be cut off, as if their bodies were not their own: so must
thou now present thy self with a great courage to entertayne thy cure. Remove
from thy self these lamentations, these shrill shreeks and other immoderate
howlings of disconsolate women. For in vain have thou suffered so many
miseries, if tho^ have not yet learned to be miserable. What think thou that
I deal too fearfully with thee? I have taken none of thine evils from thee,
but have heaped them up and laid them before thee. I have done this resolutely,
for I am resolved to overcome thy grief, not to circumscribe it.

CHAP. IIII.
I Shall first of all get the upper hand as I think, Senecaes in^e^t in this
Treatise which ^e distinguishes into two principal points.
if I shall approve unto thee that I suffer nothing, in respect whereof I might
be called wretched, and much less make other men wretched whom I touch.
Secondly, if I shall pass over unto thee and approve that thine accident which
depends on mine is not grievous. This first will I undertake, which thy
piet^e will be content to give care to, that I have no evil: and if I cannot
approve this unto thee, I will make it manifest, that these things wherewith
thou think me to be oppressed, are not intolerable. But if this may not be
believed, yet will I please my self the more, because I shall be happy
amongst those things which are wont to make others miserable. Thou art not to
credit others in that which concerns me, I my self tell thee to the end
thou may not be deluded by ill grounded reports, that I am not miserable;
nay, I say further to secure thee more, that I cannot be miserable.

CHAP. V.
WE are first borne under a good condition, He enters into the consideration
of the former point, which concerns himself, and shows that he is not
miserable. First, nature has taught us to be contented with a little.
except we forsake the same. Nature has so disposed things, that to live
well, we have no need of great necessaries: every man may make himself
blessed. These external things are but slight matters, and have no great
effect either in prosperity or in adversity, neither do the one of these
raise a wiseman, neither does the other depresse him. For he has always
endeavored that his greatest goods should consist in himself, and the
complement of his contents should be resident in his heart. What then? say I
that I am a wise man? no: for if I could freely speak it, I would not only
deny that I was miserable, but contrariwise I would maintain it boldly, that
I was the most fortunate of all men, and would repute my self to be most
nearely lodged by the Gods. For the present, which is sufficient, to mitigate
all my miseri^s I have wholly dedicated my self to wisemen, and being scarce
able enough to assure and counsel my self, I have retired my self into
another man's Camp, that is to say, amongst those who easily both defense
themselves and their own fortunes. They have commanded me always to stand
addressed, as if I were enjoined to stand Sentinel, and to foresee all the
assaults and attempts of fortune long before they assail me. To them is
fortune tedious whom she assaileth suddenly, and easily repulse they her, who
continually expect her. The enemies charge most in^tantly defeateth those whom
they suddenly set upon: but they that before the battle have prepared
themselves for a future war, being well arranged and in a readiness, do
easily sustain the first assault, Secondly, nothing h^th befa^ne him that he
has not fore^ee^e, beca^^e he never give c^ed^te to w^r^d^y p^osperi^ie.
which commonly is the most dangerous. I never gave credit to fortune,
although she seemed to claim a truce at my hands: and as touching all those
things which with a liberal hand she has bestowed upon me, such as are
silver, honors, and great credit, I have put them in that place where she may
fetch them, without either my discontent or prejudice. There was a great
distance betwixt her and me, and therefore has she carried them away from me,
and not pulled them out of my ^ands. No man has adversity overthrown, but
him whom prosperity has deceived. They that have loved her presents as if
they had been perpetual and properly theirs, who would have themselves
respected by reason of the trifles; discomfort themselves incontinently, when
these false and frail delights abandon their ^eeble and childish
understandings, Thir^ly, the goods of this world are not truly goods, and the
evils are but apparently evil.
who know not what true pleasure is. But he that is not puffed up with
prosperity, neither restrained by adversity, has an invincible heart at all
times, and an approved constancy in either fortune; for he knows well in his
felicity, that he can make head against mishap. I have therefore always had
this opinion in those things which all men wish for, that there is no true
goodness in them; nay more, I have always found that they were vain and
outwardly smoothed with a deceivable gloss, but inwardly having nothing that
is answerable to their exterior resemblance. For in those things which we call
evils I find nothing so terrible and hard as the common opinion threatens. The
word it self by a certain persuasion and consent, is now-a-dayes more
distas^efull unto the ears, and afflicts those that hear the same, as if it
were some heavy and execrable thing, for so will the people have it: but men of
wisdom do for the most part disanull the ordinances of the people.

CHAP. VI.
He disput^th plen^ifull^ of banishm^nt, and proves that th^re is no e^^ll
ther^in, and tha^ those evils which accompany the ^^me should not be called
evils.
Leaving apart therefore the judgment of diverse men, which is extinguished by
the first appearances of things: howsoever they be believed, let us consider
what banishment is. It is the change of place. It may be thought that we seem
to lessen the same, and that we take from it all that is worst in it. This
change of place is accompanied with the incommodities of poverty, of ignominy,
and contempt: against these hereafter I will combat. In the mean while I will
first of all have this looked into, which incommoditie this change of place
breeds. It is an intoll^rable thing to be deprived of a man's country. Behold
this multitude which may hardly be contained within so many thousand houses of
this City, the greatest part of this troop wants their country; they are
retired hither from their Hamlets, Colonies, and all the quarters of the world.
Some are drawn hither by ambition, othersome by the necessity of public
offices, some by Embassages enjoined them, other some are invited for riot
sake, that hunteth after the opportunity of riches, and a ^it place wherein to
exercise their dissolutions; othersome are drawn with a desire of liberal
studies; others with a delight to haunt the Theaters; some to visit their
friends, others to make proof of their industry, having gotten an ample means
to make show of their virtue; some have brought their beauty to set it out to
sale, oth^rsom their eloquence. All sorts of men resort hither, where both
virtues and vices are highly prized. Command and cite every one of these in
person, and ask of every of these whence he is; thou shall see that for the
most part of them they have forsaken their country, to come and dwell in this
spacious City, which notwithstanding is but a City, and not their own.
Again, depart from this Rome, which may be called a common country of all
men, and ouersee other Cities, and there is none of these wherein thou shall
not find a greater part of foreign multitude But leave thou these countries,
and all those who for the pleasant situation of the place, are drawn to
inhabit there, and go into the deserts and desolate Isles, as those of
Cithnon, Serephium, Giare, and Corsica. Thou shall not find any place of
banishment, but that some one remains there for his pleasure. What place may
a man find more naked and craggie on every side, then this mountainous Isle
which I inha^ite? Is there any soil more barren? Are any people more savage?
Is any situation of place more unwholesome, or are more displeasing and
intemperate? Yet are there more strangers dwell here then those that are
natural, borne in that country. So little therefore is the change of place
grievous unto men, that this Isle has withdrawn some from their own
country. I find some that will say that there is a certain natural desire
in men's minds to change their seats, and to transfer their houses. For man
has a moveable and unsettled mind given him, he is never Master of himself,
he is confused, he intrudeth his thoughts into all known and unknown things,
still stirring and never quiet, and best contented with the novelty of things;
which thou will not wonder at, if thou consider his first original. The mind
is not composed of a terrestrial and weighty matter, it is a parcel of the
celestial spirit. But the nature of celestial things is always to be in
motion; he flies and is carried away with a most swift course. Behold the
Planets that enlighten the world, Whence it comes that men are so mutable.
there is none of them that stands still, but they incessantly turn, and
daily change their places. Although they whirle about with the heavens, yet
have they their contrary motion. The Sun runs through all the signs of the
Zodiaque, his motion is perpetual, neither remains he at any time in one
point. All things turn and pass without stay; and as the law and settled
ordinance of nature has determined, they are carried from one place to
another: when as the celestial bodies shall within certain spaces of months
and years, shape their course in their spheres, they shall renew the same.
Go therefore now and make thy self believe that humane understanding composed
of the same seeds that divine things are, ever patiently endures a passage and
change from place to place, since that God himself takes pleasure in a
continual and sudden motion, and maintains himself thereby. But withdraw
thine eyes from these celestial things, and behold these terrestrial and base
things. Thou shall see Nations and people change their seat: what mean these
Cities, peopled with Graecians, even in the very midst of barbarous Nations?
What means this Macedonian language amongst the Indians and Persians? Scithia
and all that tract of fierce and unconquered nations show us the Cities of
Achaia, built upon the shores of the Pontique sea. The continual cold and the
strange and inflexible natures of those Nations more united then their air,
could not hinder the Grecians from planting their Colonies there. There is a
company of the Athenians in Asia, the city of Miletum has peopled seventy five
Cities in diverse places: All that side of Italy that bordereth upon the lower
sea, was the greater Greece. The Tuscans iss^ed from Asia, the Tirians planted
themselves in Africa, the Africans in Spain, the Greeks the France, and the
French in Greece. The Perinean mountains forbad not the Germans ^o pass
onward, humane leuity led them by vnhanted and unknown ways. They drew with
them their children, their wives, and their parents laden with age. Some of
these being wearied with long travel, chose not their habitation by judgment,
but by reason of their weariness made choice of that they next met withal.
Some maintained their possession by force of Arms; some in seeking out unknown
Countries perished by sea; some planted their pauilions there where necessity
commanded them; neither had they all of them the same cause of seeking out, and
leaving their Country. Some of these after the ruin of their Cities, escaped
from the fury of their enemies, have by force made themselves Lords of other
Cities, and have driven out the right owners. other some have been dispersed
by civil wars, othersome when their Cities were over peopled, were mustered
and sent away to other places, as superfluous. Some Nations have been driven
out of their habitations by the plague, or by often earthquakes, or by some
insupportible incommodities of the territory: and othersome have been allured
by the bruit that ran, that such or such a Country was far more pleasant
and fruitful then their own. Some others have fo^saken their houses for
diverse occasions. This then is evident that no one has remained in the place
where he was borne, and that humane kind cease not to run hither and
thither. There is daily some change in this so great a world. Here some men
lay the foundation of new Cities, there arises a new Nation, and the name of
the old is lost, and is made and becomes more great then any other. But what
are all these transmig^ations of peoples but pub^ke banishment.

CHAP. VII.
WHy lead I thee in so great a Windelesse? What need I specify unto thee
Athenor that builded Padua? He proves the change of place by these that first
founded and peopled the Empire of Rome.
or Euander that Planted the Kingdom of the Ar^adians upon the banks of
Tiber? What should I tell thee of Diomedes, and so many others, who both
victorious and vanquished, have been scattered by the Trojan war into so
diverse Countries? Behold the founder of the Roman Empire, who being an Exile, a
fugitive, gathering together some few scattered soldiers with him after the
lack of Troy, constrained by necessity, and to warrant himself from the hands
of his victorious enemies, searched out foreign Countries and arrived in
Italy. After all this, how many people has he sent in Colonies through out
the Countries of the whole world? Wheresoever the Roman is Conqueror there
dwells he. To this change of places every one willingly subscribed his name,
and the oldest forsaking their altars and fires, willingly accompanied those
that sought out other Countries beyond the Seas.

CHAP. VIII.
THe matter requires not much example, A second proo^e by the inhabitants of
the Isle whereinto he was banished.
I will only add that which I know to be ordinary, the Isle where I am has
changed the inhabitants diverse times. But we ought not to insist upon those
histories which antiquity has buried. The Greeks themselves, who at this time
inhabit Marsilles, had before time made their abode in this Isle. No man
knows who drove them thence, whether it were the air which is unpleasant, or
the fear they had of Italy, which is the Mistrisse of the world, which is more
neighbor to the Isle, or because there is dangerous landing at it. That the
natural fierceness of Islanders was not the cause it appears, because these
Greeks went and intermixed themselves with the French, a cruel nation, and
who at that time knew no ciuility: A none after these of the Coast of Genes
came hither, the Spaniardes likewise, which appears by their resemblance in
manners, and the behavior both of the one and the other; for their head attire
is the same, and their shoes, such as the bordering Spaniard use; they retain
likewise some words of their language, having forgot their mother tongue by
reason of the conversation they have had with the Greeks and Genowayes. After
these Marcius caused a Colony of Roman Citizens to be sent thither, and
Scilla an other. See here how oftentimes one barren, The third in all the
estates of the world. Privileges which exile cannot take from us.
cragged and mountainous Conntry has changed inhabitants. In brief, thou
shall not find one Angle of the earth that a man may say it was manured by the
homebred Countrymen of that place. All are mixed, transported and translated
from one quarter to another. One people has succeeded an other. One Nation
has desired to dwell there which an other has dispeopled. That other have
been driven from that place whence they expulsed others. So has it pleased the
Destinies, that nothing should always remain firm and continue in one place.
Varro the most learned man amongst the Romans, thinks this a sufficient
remedy, that wheresoever we become, we account it the same world. Marcus
Brutus thinks this sufficient for those that are banished to carry their
virtues with them. If any one thinks that these two expediments considered
apart, have little power to comfort a banished man; he will confess that
these two together may do very much. For that which we have lost, deserves
it to be called any thing? Two the most excellent privileges, A doubtful
opinion of Seneca, as touching the Deity, and his ordinary Paradox, tying, the
first cause which i^ God to secondary causes, read here with advice.
that is to say, common nature, and our proper virtue will follow us in eu^ry
place wheresoever we fix our foot. Believe whosoever has created this
universe, whether it be that Almighty God, whether it be incorporall reason,
that Workmaster of great things, whether it be a demi spirit, equally extended
and spread amidst all great and small Creatures, whether it be Destiny, and this
immutable succession of things enchained the one within the other: such a one
has caused that no things (except they be things most abject and of little
worth) are not out of our power. All that which is good in man, is not subject
to humane power and violence, which neither can give it, or take it away.
Nature has created this world which is the greatest and fairest thing that a
man may see, But as touching the soul that contemplateth and admireth the
world, whereof she is the most excellentest part, she is proper unto us, she
is perpetual and shall continue so long with us, as we continue ^et us go
forward therefore willingly and confidently, whethersoeuer our fortune leads
us; let us march forward with a confident pace.

CHAP. IX.
An other notable consideration in exile is, that the whole world is a man's
country
LEt us travel over what countries soever we will, and we shall find no
Country in this world that is not accessible by a man. On what soever side we
address our eyes toward heaven; these things that are divine are separated
from those that are humane by equal distance: so then provided that mine eyes
be not hindered from beholding the heavens, as long as it shall be lawful
for me to behold the Sun and Moon, and to consider nearly the other
celestial bodies, their risings, settings and distances: Search out the causes
why the one have more swifter motions then the other; behold so many shining
stars by night, the one fixed, the other shaping a short course, and retiring
into their Spheres, some appearing suddenly, others blemishing the eye with
their spacious clearenesse, as if they would fall; others flying with a long
tract, and great light. As long as I shall behold these things, and exercise my
self amidst these celestial troops, as much as is lawful for a mortal man,
and if I have always my mind lifted up on high in contemplation of those
things that concern the same, what care I upon what ground I tread? But this
land wherein thou live is not fertile, neither bears it shadowie trees it
is not watered by the currents of great and nauigable rivers, it brings forth
nothing that other Countries might seek after; scarsly is it able to sustain
the inhabitants: no precious stone is cut here, no veins of gold or silver
are dug out of it. Base is that mind that takes pleasure in terrestrial
things; to those things must he be addressed which every way appear equally,
and every where shine equally, and this is he to think, that the goods of this
world through the false opinion that men have conceived of their firmity, do
but obscure and hinder the true goods. The more they enlarge the walks and
porches of their houses, the more high they raise their turrets, the more
larger they extend their streets, the more deeper they dig their caves and
summer retreats, the more higher they raise the roofes and ^eelings of their
dining Chambers, the more they hide the heavens from themselves. An accident
has driven thee into a certain Country, where in ^^eade of a Palace thou have
but a little Cabin, truly thou have but a weak mind, and such as i^
comforted with base delights, if therefore thou endure this patiently, because
thou know Romulus his cottage. Rather say thus, whatsoever the house be, it
is big enough to entertain virtues. Then will it be more fair then all the
Temples when justice shall be scene there, when continency, when prudence,
piety, the means how to discharge himself of his duty, and the knowledge of
divine and humane things. No place is too straight that entertaineth this
troop of so great virtues, no banishment is grievous, wherein a man may march
in such co^pany^ Brutus in that book which he wrote of virtue, says; That
he saw Marcellus that was ba^ished into Mitilene, and as far as humane
nature permitted, living most blessedly, never more desirous of the knowledge
of good letters then at that time: he therefore added, that he in departing
from him, rather thought that he went into banishment, who was to return
back again without him, then that he left him an exile. O far more happy
Marcellus at that time when he approved his banishment to Brutus, then when he
justified his Consulat to the people of Rome. How great a man was he, who
brought to pass that, that man should seem abanished man in his own
judgment, in departing from him that was an exile. The same Brutus says, that
C^s^r passing along by Mitele^e, would not only enter into the same, because
he^ could not endure to behold a deformed man. The Senate by mutual
supplica^ion obtained Marcellus re^ocation, so pensiu^ and sad were they, that
a man would have said at that time, that every one of them had Brutus soul,
and besought not for Marcellus but for themselves, for fear least being
without him, it should prove a true banishment, yet more attained he that day
when Brutus was sorry to leave him an exile, and Caesar to see him: for by this
means he had a testimony from them both. Brutus was sorry to return without
Marcellus, Caesar was ashamed; do thou doubt that this so worthy a man did
not encourage himself to endure his banishment with a quiet mind in these or
such like words? It is no misery for thee that, thou want thy Country: so
have thou informed thy self with good letters, Notable considerations to
pacifi^ the fury of exile, worthily set down under the person of, Marcellus.
that thou know that every place is a Wisemans Country. And what shall we
say of him that has banished thee? has he not been out of his Country for
the space of ten whole years? Undoubtedly it was to the end to increase the
Roman Empire, yet was he absent so long. And now behold Africa draws him
unto her, being replenished with the alarums of a threatening war. Spain
recalleth him that repaireth the broken and dispersed troops of Pompey,
perfidious Egypt calls him forth, and in conclusion the whole world which is
intent upon this occasion of the shaken Empire. Whither shall he march first,
against what party shall he first oppose himself. His victory shall drive him
through all the countries in the world. Let all Nations reverence and serve him,
as for thy self finish thy days with this content, that tho^ art much
esteemed by Brutus. Constantly therefore did Marcellus endure his exile,
neither did the change of place any ways change his mind, although he were
pressed with poverty, wherein there is no evil, as that man knows very well,
when avarice and dissolution (which ouerturne all things,) have not as yet
ouerturned his understanding. For how little is it, that is necessary for a
man's entertainment? has a virtuous man need of this or that? For mine own
part I find that I am dispossessed of many encumbrances, and not of my goods.
The desires of those things whereof the body stands in need are short, he
demands no more but a covering to defense him against the cold, and mea^e
and drink to extinguish his hunger and thirst. All that a man desires besides
these, serves but to entertain excess, and has no true use. It is not
necessary to ^ound all depthes, nor to murder so many beasts to fill the
belly, nor to go and fish for Oysters in foreign and unknown seas: The Gods
and Goddesses may destroy those men, whose dissolution has exceeded the bounds
of the Roman Empire so much envied. They will have the foul of their
ambitious Kitchens taken and brought from beyond the ^loud Phasis, which is in
the further part of Asia, and are not ashamed to send for their dainties from
the Parthians: from whom as yet we have not demanded recompense for the
wrongs they have done us. They bring from all places that which they know is
proper to enkindle these gluttons appetites: that which these decayed stomachs
will hardly digest, being glutted with too many dainties, is brought from the
farthest Ocean: they vomit to the end they may eat, they eat to the end they
may vomit: they take not time to digest those dainty morsels which they search
through the whole world. If a man despise these delicacies, what wrong does he
to poverty? if a man desire them, poverty likewise profits him. Some there
are that are not healed but against their wills, and if a poor man being
deprived of these dainties, cease not to wish for them, yet undoubtedly when
he cannot^ he is like to him that will not. Catus Caesar whom Nature as I
think brought into this world to show what great vices might do in a great
and worldly prosp^ritie, spent at one only supper the sum of two hundredth and
fifty thousand crowns, and being herein assisted by the wits of his best
belly-gods, yet scarcely found he how he might consume in that one repast all
the revenue of three Provinces. O miserable men whose pallats are not pleased
but with precious dainties, which are made precious, not by reason of their
excellent savor or any sweetness they yield the taste, but by reason of their
raritie and cunning in dressing. Otherwise if they would awaken themselves
never so little what need they so many arts to entertain their bellies? what
need they such traffiques, such desolation of woods, such fishing of Seas and
Rivers? Nature has furnished in all places sufficient meat for our bodies. But
these Countries and places like blind men they pass over, and travel through
all Nations, and sail all Seas, and when as they may satisfy their hunger
with a little, they provoke the same with much.

CHAP. X.
IT pleases me to ask: Why rig you and lanch you your ships? Why arm you
your hands both against wild beasts and men? A ^ontinuation of his inuectiue
against intemperance.
why run you hither and thither so tumultuously? why heap you riches upon
riches? will you not think how little your bodies are? Is it not a desperate
fury and extreme folly when as thou can hold so little, to desire so much?
Although therefore you increase your rents, and enlarge the bounds of your
lands, yet shall you never make your bodi^s greater. When your traffic has
been prosperous, your warfare has brought home rich spoils, when all the
dainties you have sought for from all places are gathered together: where will
you bestow all this provision? why heap you up so many things? The frugalitie
and prosperity of the ancient Romans.
undoubtedly your ancestors whose virtues at this time sustain your vices were
unhappy, who prepared their meat with their own hands, whose bed was the
earth, whose houses as yet shined not with gold, whose temples as yet shined
not with precious stones. In these days they swear religiously by Gods made of
earth, and those that had sworn by such Images returned to the enemy with
resolution to die, to the end they would not violate their plighted Faith. By
this account less blessedly lived our Dictator who gave audience to the
Ambassadors of the Samnites, at such time as he dressed his homely victuals by
the fire with his own hands. Yea such hands as had already oftentimes
defeated the Enemy, and put the c^owne of Laurel in the lap of I^piter
Capitoline. Better then Apicius lived in our memory, who in the same City out
of which sometimes Philosophers were commanded to depart, as if corrupters of
youth, made profession of the science of gourmandise, and infected the whole
age with his discipline, whose death it shall not be amiss to consider and
know. After he had gathered together into his Kitchen the sum of two millions
and a half in gold, after he had in his particular banquets consumed all the
presents that were given him by Princes, and the great revenue of the Capitol,
finding himself very much in debt, he began at that time to consider in what
estate his affairs stood, and finding that there remained as yet the sum of
two hundredth and fifty thousand crowns, supposing that it was too little, and
that he should be in danger to die for hunger, he killed himself by poison.
How great was his dissolution that thought himself poor having two hundredth
and fifty thousand crowns? Go now and think that the measure in money and
not in mind, is pertinent to the matter.

CHAP. XI.
APICIVS made small reckoning of two hundredth and fifty thousand crowns,
Having sufficiently detested intemperance, he proves again that every
Country has enough in it self to nourish him that inhabiteth the same.

The desire of worldly goods is insatiable.


and that which other men desire with wishes, he drove away by poison. But to a
man of so depraved a mind, that last potion was the most holsommest. Then eat
he and drunk he poison, when as he was not only delighted with immeasurable
banquets, but gloried therein: when he bragged of his vices, when as he had
drawn the whole City into admiration of his riot, when as he had incited the
youth (who of themselves are apt enough to follow evil examples) to follow and
imitate him. This is the end of those men who keep no measure in the use of
worldly goods, which notwithstanding have their bounds, but abuse and follow
evil customs, that has no limit or rule but his unbridled will. Covetousness
thinks no thing enough, nature is sufficed with a very little. Is poverty
then no incommoditie to those that are banished? none; for there is no exile so
miserable that is not fertile enough to nourish one man. Should not a banished
man covet a gown or a lodging? if he desires them only for use, he shall
neither want house or clothing: for the body is covered with as little as it
is nourished. Nature has made every thing easy which she knew necessary for
a man. If he wish for a furre gown of purple embroidered with gold, composed
of diverse colors, and after a rich fashion, he is poor by his own default,
and not by the rigor of adversity. Restore unto such a man all that he has
lost, yet shall thou do nothing for him, because he shall want more of that
which he desires thee, a banished man wants of all that which he has had. If
he coueteth a Cubberd garnished with vessel of gold, silver cups of great
price, because that long ago they were labored by cunning workmens hands,
medals made precious by a few men's madness, and a troop of Servants so great
that the house (which otherways is spacious) is unable to contain them; a
goodly stable furnished with many fat and gallant Horses, marbels, and other
stones of price, brought from all the corners of the World. Let a man gather up
together as many of these things as he can, yet will they never satisfy an
insatiable mind: no more then all the water in the world is not sufficient to
quench his thirst, that desires to drink not to satisfy his necessity, but
to extinguish the heat proceeding from the inflammation of his entrails. For
this is no thirst but a sickness: neither happens this only in money, but in
meat also. This is the nature of every desire that proceeds from error, not
from want: all whatsoever thou shall heap up will but serve to inflame him,
not to satisfy him. He then that contains himself within a natural measure
will have no sense of poverty, Mediocritie on the contrary side is always,
and every where content.
but he that exceeds this mediocritie in midst of his greatest riches shall
always find that poverty attends him. The most solitary and barren places
suffice those that content themselves with necessary things but they that
desire superfluity have never enough although they had whole Kingdoms. It is
the mind that makes men rich, he it is that accompanies them in exile and in
the desert, where finding sufficient to maintain his body he has goods in
abundance, and enjoys them contentedly. Money appertains nothing to the
mind, no more then all those things which untrained minds, and too much
addicted to their bodies so much affect, Why virtuous men cannot love the goods
of this world.
concern the immortal Gods. Precious stones, gold, silver, great tables well
garnished are but earthly burdens, which a sincere mind, and such as is no^
forgetful of his nature cannot love, because it is always light, and will
mount as high as heaven as soon as he finds the gate open; in the mean
while, and in as much as these bonds of the body, and mass of the flesh which
inuironeth the same will permit, upon the wings of a sudden and swift thought
he visits and raises celestial things. And therefore a freeman that is
allied to the gods, as great as this world, or time, can never be banished: for
his thought circleth the heavens, and examineth both time past and that which
is to come. This frail body, the fetters and gives of the soul, is tossed
hither and thither, punishments, thefts, and sickenesses are exercised upon it.
As for the mind, it is sacred and eternal, and hands cannot be laid upon it.

CHAP. XII.
The fourth fruit of exile and poverty is, that it has no care or torment of
mind, and contrariwise, the rich a^e poor for the most part of their lives.
Neither think thou that to lessen the incommodities of poverty (which no man
feels to be grievous except he that supposes it) that I use only the
precepts of Philosophy: first, consider how great the number of poor men is,
whom notwithstanding thou shall not see more pensive or careful then the rich;
contrariwise, I dare almost auow it, that they are more joyful, because their
minds are less distracted by affairs. Let us ouer-passe the poor, and com
unto the rich: In the greatest part of their life resemble they not poor men?
If men would travail they scantle their burdens, and trusse up their packes,
and as often as necessity requires them to make more have, they ouergoe the
troop of their companions. They that follow the wars, for the most part
carry none of their necessaries with them, because that military discipline
permits them not to carry much luggage. Besides this condition of time, and
incommoditie of places, which equalleth them with the poor; sometimes they are
so glutted with their riches, that some days they will content themselves to
suppe upon the grass, and will command their vessels of gold and silver away,
and content themselves to be served in platters and vessels of earth: mad and
unadvised they always fear that which they covet sometimes. What cloud of
error, and what ignorance of truth shaddoweth these men, which avoid that
which they imitate to yield them pleasure? For mine own part, as often as I
consider the life of our ancestors, I blush and dare not use the solace that
poverty gives me, because that dissolution has gotten so great a head in this
time, that at this day banished men have a greater viaticum, and more
commodities then great Princes patrimony and reuennues came to in times past.
Diverse examples of the temperance of our ancestors.

See Titus Liuius in his second book and eighteenth chapter: Valerius Maximus
in his fourth book and fourth Chapter.


It is well known that Homer had but one servant, Plato three, and that Zeno
the author of that severe and manly wisdom of the Stoickes had none at all.
If any one will therefore say that they lived miserably, will not he think
himself a catiue and miserable, by reason of this his false opinion? Menenius
Agrippa, who made a peace betwixt the Senate and the Roman people, that were
ready to assail one another, was buried at the common charge. Attilius Regulus
after he had overthrown the Carthaginians in Africa, wrote unto the Senate
that his husbandman was dead, by reason whereof his lands were unmanured,
whereupon the Senate took order as long as Regulus was absent. So much was it
to him that he had not a servant, that the Commonweal of Rome became his
husbandman. Scipio's daughters were married at the Cities charge, because
their father had left them nothing. Truly there was great reason why the
people of Rome should pay tribute unto Scipi^ once, when as they exacted a
tribute from Carthage always. How happy were the husbands of these daughters,
who had the Roman people for their fathers in law? Think thou them more
happy, whose daughters after they had played in the Theaters, had twenty
thousand crowns to their marriage, then Scipio was, who from the Senate their
Tutor, have received some small sum of money for their dowry? What man is he
that dare disdain poverty, that has so worthy examples? Would a banished man
complain that he wanted this or that, when as Scipio had no money to marry his
daughters? Regulus was without a husbandman, Menenius had need of friends to
pay for his funerals; and considering that all that which was wanting to those
worthy men, has been more plentifully ministered unto them then they had need;
so then such Patrons not only make poverty secure, but also gracious.

CHAP. XIII.
TO this it may be answered, An objection, that ignominy annexed with pouerti^
is a thing very odious
Why so artificially discoursest thou on these things, which considered apart
may be maintained, but if they be compared cannot? Change of place is tolerable
if thou only change thy place: poverty is tolerable, if ignominy be taken
from it, the which always is wont to oppress men's minds. To him who would
terrify me with a troop of evils, thus would I answer; If thou have force
enough against every part of fortune; the like may thou have against all.
When virtue has once hardened the mind she makes him invincible. If avarice
dismiss thee, which is the most violent plague of mankind, ambition will never
leave thee at rest. His opinion (...) touching death, proceeding from the
ignorance of the fall of the first man.
If thou beholdest thy last hour, not as a punishment, but as a law of
nature, into that breast whence thou have driven the fear of death, there is
no fear of any thing that dare enter. If thou think that the honest desires
of marriage, was not allotted man to feed his lust, but to increase his family.
He that is not violated with this secret mischief infixed in his bowels, every
other desire will ouerpasse and touch him not. Reason not only ouerturneth
vices one after another, but all of them together: she fights at once, and
overcomes the enemy at one stroke. Think thou that a wiseman that is
grounded in virtue, and estranged from vulgar opinions is shaken by ignominy?
Death is more ignominious then one simple ignominy; yet Socrates with the same
countenance and resolution entered the prison, wherewith he in times pastalone
brought the thirti^ tyrant^ into order, and took the ignominy from the place
by his entry: Examples to confirm hi^ answer.
for that could not seem to be a prison wherein Socrates was lodged. What man
is he so brutish, that will say or think that Marcus Cato was disgraced, at
such time as he demanded the Praetorship, and afterward the Consulate? It was
a disgrace both to the Praetor and Consulate who were honored by Cato. No man
can be despised by another man, except he first be contemned by himself. An
humble and abject mind becomes subject to this contumely; but whosoever
encourages himself against these terrible accidents, and overcomes those
evils wherewith other hearts are ouerturned, reputeth his afflictions to be his
ornaments. When we are thus affected, that nothing moves more admiration in us
then to see a man courageous in his miseries. Aristides was sent by the
Athenians, and commanded to be put to death, who made all those hang down
their head^ and mourn that saw him in that estate, not as if they had executed
a just man, but justice her self; yet was there one amongst them that spit in
his face: this might he have taken heavily, because he knew that no man that
had modesty would have done it, yet wiped he his face, and smilingly beheld
the Magistrates, and said thus, Admonish this man, that hereafter he open not
his mouth so uncleanly. This were enough to humble outrage it self. I know
that some will reply, that nothing is so hardly dis-jested as contempt, and
that death seems more pleasing then the same. To these I answer, that
oftentimes exile is exempted from these incommodities. If a man of note fall
upon the ground, yet is he always the same, and as great; neither is contemned
any more, then when as the ruin^ of sacred Temples are troad upon, which as
well both the religious as the standers by do adore. Thou can not therefore
find any want of thy son that is taken from thee, whom during his aboade
with thee, thou never thoughtest to appertain unto thee.

CHAP. XIIII.
He now comes to the second point of his d^scourse, the scope whe^^of, is,
that H^luia in regard of her self, has not any occasion to torment her self
for the absence of her son, and that for two principal causes.
SInce, most dear mother, thou have not any occasion in respect of me to
afflict thy self thus continually, there must be therefore some particular
considerations that press thee thus. But these are two; for either thou
tormentest thy self because thou think that thou have lost some stay, or
because thou can not endure the sorrow thou sustainest. I will slightly touch
the first consideration; for I know that thy heart loves nothing in thy
children but themselves. Let those mothers, who by their indiscretion breed
much discontent in their children that are grown in credit, consider what
they do. Being unable to execute public charges, they show themselves
ambitious by their children^ they embezzill and spend their reuennues, and by
their bables break their heads who are constrained to give ear unto them. But
for thine own part thou have greatly rejoiced at the goods that have befalne
thy children, which thou have never had a part of. Thou have always restrained
our liberality, when thou have had no power of thine own: thou being but the
daughter of a family, have not forborne to bestow thy favors plentifully upon
thy children that were rich: thou have administered the goods that our father
left us, as if they had been thine own, and have been as sparing of them as
if thou had had them to restore them to some strangers: thou have spared
our credit as if thou had been to employ such a one that were no ways
allied unto thee: our estates and honors were but a charge and pleasure to
thee, and thou never did respect us to enrich thy self: thou can not
therefore want thy son that is taken from thee, who in his safety never
thoughtest that he appertained unto thee.

CHAP. XV.
ALL my consolation must be aimed to withstand that, To remedy his mothers
sorrow, the better he specifieth the parties, and appliet^ diverse remedies.
whence the true force of thy motherly sorrow does arise. I want the embraces
of my dear child, I cannot see him, I cannot devise with him. Where is he, by
whose sight I redeemed my sorrow, to whom I communicated al my discontents?
Where are his discourses, wherewith I could not satisfy my self? Where are his
studies, which I entertained more willingly then a woman, more familiarly then
a mother? Where is this meeting, wherein the son showed himself joyful to
behold his mother? Thou will add hereunto the very places where I was wont to
reverence thee, to drink and eat with thee: the place likewise, whereas we
met the last time, which cannot but have great efficacy to afflict the mind.
For this likewise did Fortune most cruelly complot against thee, because that
when thou were secure, and fearedst no such matter, she dared to assault thee
three days before I was stricken. We had before times been fitly separated by
distance of places, and our absence during some years, had as it were,
disposed thee to this affliction: thou came back again unto me, not to
enjoy any pleasure or contentment by thy son, but to the end thou might
not lose the good to converse and communicate with him. Had thou been
separated from him long time before, this assault had not so much vexed thee,
because the distance of time might have assuaged thy sorrows: if thou had
not been severed from him, thou had endured thy loss more contentedly,
because thou had enioied this last fruit to be yet two days in thy sons
company. But cruel destiny has carried the matter in such sort, that thou
foundest me not at Rome at such time as I was banished, and arriuedst there
in^ontinently afterward, to receive the more grief, because I was then upon
departure. But the more furious these assaults are; the more ought thou to
call thy better resolved virtue to assist thee, and to fight more confidently
with thine enemy, which is sufficiently known unto thee, and that heretofore
has been diverse times defeated by thee. This blood of thy present affliction,
is not the first that thou have lost, thy precedent wounds, as yet unhealed,
have been renewed again.

CHAP. XVI.
THou ought not to allege in thine excuse, He confirms her by the
consideration of other wom^ns infirmities.
that thou art a woman, which is almost permitted to weep her fill, and yet
ought there to be some measure. And therefore our Ancestors allowed them ten
months space to bewail their husbands, and in limiting in this sort by their
public ordinance this obstinate sadne^ of women, they pretended not to hinder
their tears, but to bring them to some end. For it is a foolish and unbridled
affection in any one to torment himself incessantly, for the death of another
whom he loves. As contrariwise not to be moved, is to be reputed to have a
heart both obdurate and inhumane. The best mean that we can observe betwixt
piety and reason, is to feel some remorse, and afterward to extinguish the
same. There is no reason thou should build upon certain women, that having
once begun to entertain sorrow, never give it over till death has made an
end of them. Thou have known diverse, that having lost their sons, have never
afterward put off their mourning garments. The constancy that thou have
always showed heretofore, requires somewhat more at thy hands. Such a one as
in times past has approved it to all men, that she was delivered from all
feminine imperfections, cannot allege for her excuse, that she is a woman.
Impudicitie, one of the most greatest evils that reign in our time, has not
entangled thee amongst diverse others: pearls and precious stones have not
tempted thee, riches, which are esteemed the greatest good in this world, have
not bewitched thine eyes, the dangerous examples wherewith the wickeder sort
seduce the best have not distracted thee, thou that have been well brought up
in a Noble and well ordered Family, art not ashamed to have been fetile, and
the mother of diverse children: as if thou were vpbraided thereby that thou art
old. Never have thou according to the custom of diverse other women, which
desire nothing more then to be reputed bewtifull, hidden thy grossness, as if
it had been an unfitting burden, neither have thou made away the fruit of thy
womb, which thou thoughtest thou had received. Thou have never painted thy
self, nor taken any pleasure to wear such garments as might discover thy
naked skin. Modesty is the only ornament which thou have esteemed to be
most fitting, most seemly, and such as cannot be indemnified by age. So then
thou can not to the end thou may obtain license to weep; pretend the
name of a woman, because thy virtues have separated thee from that rank. So
far ought thou to be estranged from the tears of this sex, as thou art
from their imperfections. Women likewise themselves will not permit thee to
c^nsure and submit thy self to thy sorrow: but having suffered thee to weep a
little, and as much as need requires, they will make thee rise up, especially
if thou will behold those women, who for their excellent virtues, have been
numbered amongst the most famous men. He animateth her by worthy examples.
Fortune reduced Cornelia, the mother of twelve children, to that pass, that
she had only two remaining: if thou would count those she had buried, they
were ten, if thou will estimate them she had lost, the Gracchi, yet expressly
forbad she those that wept about her, and cursed that unhappy advise to accuse
Fortune in any sort, which had given her the Gracchi to her sons. By this
woman should he be bred, who said unto a certain person that declamed before
the people: Speak thou evil of my mother that bare me? But the mothers
speech, in my judgment, is more courageous. The son made high reckoning of
the birth of the Gracchi, the mother of their deaths. Rutillia followed her
son Cotta into exile, and her love toward him was so entire, that she had
rather endure exile then his want; neither returned she back again into her
Country, before she returned with her son. After his return, and at such
time as her son was ra^sed to the greatest honors: she bare his death as
constantly as she had followed him courageously; and no man could ever mark
that she let one tear fall from he^ eyes after he was enterred. She made
proof of her virtue at such time as she was banished, and of her wisdom, when
death drew him out of this world^ Nothing hindered her from showing her self
charitable, and nothing detained her in a sottish and superfluous sorrow. My
desire is that thou should be numbered amongst such women, Afterward he
counsels her to conquer, and not to disguise her passions.
and because thou have always imitated their life, be thou continually most
studious and careful to follow their example, and to repress and suppress
thy sorrow. I know that the matter is not in our power, and that there is no
passion that will be moderated, and especially not that which proceeds from
griefe^ for it is fierce and rebellious against all remedy^ yet will we in the
mean time that it master and swallow up sorrows, and yet notwithstanding
permit we tears to stream along a counterfeit and concealed countenance: we
will endeavor to exercise the mind in sports, or in seeing the Sword-players
skirmish; but amidst all these spectacles that shall detain the same, we are
content that a light touch of grief shall shake the same. It is far better to
ouercom the passion then to abuse it: for sorrow withdrawn by the pleasures of
this world, or beguiled by occupations relieueth himself, and by the means of
repose gathers more greater forces, and ^^^misheth afterward more
confidently. But the mind that gives place to reason, attaineth a perpetual
repose. But I will not teach thee th^se remedies which I know diverse other
shave used, namely that thou should pass the time in some long voyage, or
that thou should sport thy self in places of pleasure, or tha^ ^hou
should employ many days in carefully ouerlooking how thy affairs are
carried, and to order thy reuenew, or in short that thou should entangle thy
self always in so me new affairs. All these things profit for a short
moment, and are not remedies, but delays of sorrow. For mine own part I had
rathe^ thou should cease then deceive thy grief. I will therefore lead thee
the^her whether all they ought to have recourse, A principal remedy in foolish
and unbridled passions to have recourse to Philosophy, whereunto he exhorts
his mother.
who fly from fortune, that is to Philosophy, which will heal thy wound, and
pluck out all sorrow from thy mind. Though hitherto thou ^ast never addicted
thy self thereunto, yet now must thou do it; but thou ha^^ not studied all
the liberal sciences, tho^ have only tasted so much as the ancient severity
of my father permitted thee. I could have wished that my Father (one of the
best men in the world) had been less addicted to the fashions of ^ur
ancestors, and that he would ^aue permitted the^ seriously to be instructed
in Philosophy, and not slightly: now then should thou not have need to
pr^pare a remedy against Fortune, but thou should be exercised therein. As
for these that use good letters, not for wisdom ^alle, but rather for
ostentation and pride, for their cause he suffe^ed thee the less to follow
thy studies, but by reason of the pregnant wit thou have apprehended more in
a little ti^e then could be expected. The foundations of all sciences are
laid in thee. Return now unto these, and they will make thee secure these

never shall sorrow or sollitude^ not the vain sorrow of superfluous
affliction enter in^o thy heart any more, thy breast shall lie open to none of
these, for already is it shut up against all other vices. These are the
most assured remees, and such as can only deliver thee from fortune. But
whilst thou have attained that part which studies promise, thou have need of
^orne supports and s^aies, and therefore in the mean while will I show thee
thy comforts. Behold my brothers who being in security^ it is unlawful for
thee to accuse fortune, thou have in both to delight thy self for their
several virtues, the one by his industry has ar^aine^ honors, the other has
contemned them wisely: content thy self in the one of thy sons dignity, and
the others quiet, note the piety of them both. I know the inward affections of
my brethren, the one in this respect affects dignity, that he may be an
ornement unto thee, the other has retired himself to a peaceable and quiet
life, only to attend thee. Fortune has disposed thy children well; both for
thy succor, and for thy delight; thou may be defended by the dignity of
the one, and envy the others retirement. They will contend in offices toward
thee, and the desire of one shall be supplied by the pie^y of them both. I
dare boldly promise thee, thou shall want nothing but the number^ From these
behold my Nephews likewise, Marcus that pretty wanton lad, at whose sight all
sorrow must be banished, there is nothing so great, nothing so newly impressed
in any man's breast, which he by his wanton dalliance will not len^^ie, whose
tears will not his pleasures suppress? whose mind e^cept it be wholly
contracted by care, will not his merry and witty iestes ma^e joyful? Who will
not be drawn to delight by beholding his wantonnesse^ who though wholly fixed
and devoured in thoughts, would not be delighted by his pretty prattle, and so
pleasing that never wearieth any man? I beseech the Gods to grant him long life
amongst us. Let all the wearied cruelty o^ the Fates be spit and spent upon me,
let all my mother should grieve for, be transferred to me, or what afflicts my
grandmother, afflict me. So the rest may flourish in their accustomed estate, I
shall not complain of mine own solitude and condition. Let me only be the
expiation of the family, that here after shall live in repose. Keep in thy
lap my No^^tilla that shall shortly make thee a great Grandmother with that
affection I appropriated and made her mine own, that having lost me, she
might seem to be an Orphan, although I am now living. Love her I pray thee for
my sake: Fortune of late has taken her father from her, thy piety may effect
this that she shall only have cause to bewail the death of her mother, and yet
notwithstanding shall have no sense of this loss. Now fashion ^er mind, and
then her manners. Precepts take best hold when they are imprinted in tender
years. Let her accustom her self to your speeches, le^ her conform her
self according to thy manners, thou shall give her much, although thou give
her nothing but thy example. This so solemn an endeavor will serve for a
remedy, nothing can divert a mind that is piously sorrowful, but either reason
or honest occupation. I should number thy Father likewise amongst thy great
comforts, Secondly^ her Father.
but that he is absent: but now bethink thy self by thine own affection
what concerns him, and thou shall understand how far iuster a thing it is
that thou art reserved for him, then bestowed upon me. As often as immoderate
force of sorrow shall invade thee, and shall command thee to follow him, think
upon thy father; in giving him so many Nephews and Nephews children, thou
have brought to pass that thou art not alone. Meanewhile thou enioyest this
honor, that thou have happily finished the course of thy life, and as long as
he lives, it is unlawful for thee to complain that thou live.

Thirdly, her sister^ whose virtues and constancy she^ commends.
YEt had I almost concealed thy greatest solace, thy sister that has always
been so faithful unto thee, in whose bosom thou have familia^ly discharged
all thy sorrowes^ and who has showed toward us all an affection of a mother^
thou have mingled thy tears with hers, and thou first breathedst in her mouth^
She always follows thine affections, and yet in my behalf she grieueth
not ^o much for thee. By her h^nds was I brought into this City, by her pious
and motherly nursing, I recovered after a long and dangerous sickness, she
employed her credi^e to make me Quaestor. And whereas she blushed if any one
should have spoken to her, or saluted her with a louder voice, she was not
ashamed to go and speak with diverse several men in my behalf, neither could
her retired course of life, neither her modes^y (in so great pe^ulancy of
Country women) neither her quiet, neither her secret and inclined manners,
aiming at nothing more then ^^pose, detain her from showing her selfe^
ambitious in my behalf^. This dear mother is a s^lace whereby thou must be
comforted^ as much as in thee lies join thy self to her, and tie thy self
to her s^ric^ embraces. They that are in sorrow are wont to fly those things
which most they love, and to se^ke a liberty for their sorrow: but see that
thou both retire thy self, and whatsoever thou think unto her, whether thou will keep this habit, or lay it aside, with her thou shall find, either a
companion, or an end of thy sorrow. But if I be not decei^^d in the wisdom of
this most perfect woman, she will not suffer thee to consume thy self in
fruitless lament, and will propose thee her own example, whereof I my self
was a witness. Having been married young, she lost her husband, and our
uncle upon the sea, yet in the mean while, and at the same time she endured
her sorro^ and fear, and afterward escaping from the storm she solemnized
his funerals. O how many worthy actions of women are buried in obscurity, if
this woman had lived in the time of our a^cestors, who with a pure affection
honored their virtues; how many brave spirits should have enforced themselves
to extol a woman, The He^oicke virtues of Heluias sister.
who without any apprehension of her weakness, neither feared winds, neith^r
le^ted by waves, exposed her self to all hazards to bury her husband^ and
thinking of his obsequies, had not any thought at all of her own? The Poets
have enobled Alcestis, that hazarded her life to ransom her husband from
death. But this is more, to search with the expense of her own life a Tomb
for her husband^ the greater is the love that redeemeth by eminent danger that
which seems to be little. Furthermore, is not this a thing worthy of
admiration that during the space of sixeteene years, in which her husband was
governor of Egypt, she was never seen in the stre^t, neither suffered she
any of that Province to enter her house; she demanded nothing at her husbands
hands, neither suffered any other to entreat ought else at her hands: by
reason whereof this Province so talkatiue and ingenuous to defame their
governors, wherein diverse having carried themselves honestly, have
notwithstanding been accused of evil conversation, re^erenced thy sister as
the only example of sanctity, and enforcin^ their own natures which is to
take pleasure in jesting whatsoever become of it, carefully contained their
tongs, and althoug^ they hoped not ever to have had such a Gouernesse, yet
wished she the like daily. It was much for her to make her self known in
Egypt in sixeteene years space, but it was far more to conceal her^ self
so long. I recount not these things to the end to rippe up the praises of this
woman, for to represent them so briefly, is to diminish them; but to the end
that thou may understand that she is a woman of a great mind: whom neither
ambition, nor avarice (the companions and plagues of all humane greatness) could
ouercom, neither the apprehension of death, affrighted so much (although she saw
the ship disarmed and ready to sink) but that holding her^ dead husband
embraced in her arms, For conclusion, and for his last consolation, h^e says
that Heluia ^a^h no occasion to be sad, because her son enjoys a singular
contentment ^n mind in his exile.
she sought out, not the means to escape, but how she might bury his body.
The like resolution ought thou to show, and retire thy mind from sorrow,
and behave thy self so that men may not think that thou repentest this that
thou have brought me into this world, but because it is needful when as thou
have done all things^ yet that they should now and then reflect upon me,
neither that any of thy children should be more frequent in thy memory, not
because they are less dear unto thee, but because it is a natural thing to
lay thy hands more often on that which is aggrieued. Behold what thou ought
to think that I am: I am joyful and merry, as if all my affairs were in the
best estate of the world, and so they be, because my mind being discharged of
all cares, imployeth it self in those actions that are proper unto it, and
sometimes delights himself in more pleasing studies, and sometimes being
greedy to discover the truth, disposes and causes himself to consider both
mine own nature, and the disposition of the whole world. First he takes a
reuiew of all Countries, and searches out their situations. Afterward he
considers the sea that circleth them round about, and the ebbes and floats of
the same; then regards he all that which is marvelous, and dreadful in the
heavens and earth, that is to say, this great space, wherein the noise
resoundeth of so many thunders, of so many lightnings of contrary winds, of
ouerflow of waters, of snowes and hail. And having traveled through these low
places, he ascends more high to enjoy the sight of more divine things, and
remembering himself of eternity, he examineth all that which either has been,
or shall be in all ages.

The End of the Book of Consolation.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS. The first Book.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
He handles that part of natural Philosophy in these books, which is called
(...), that is the discourse of Meteors, because for the most part it
entreats of sublime matters, and those things that are betwixt heaven and
earth; yet entreats he of the motion of the earth, as also of floods and
waters; but in this respect, because they have their beginning or cause from
spirit or air, and in the regard thereof have some relation to sublime nature
lik^wise. These books are both excellent and learned; I will not say more
better, yet more plenti^ull then ARISTOTLE'S are upon this argument, and such as
he wrote when he was very old, about that time when he wrote his Epistles.
They are therefore fitly annexed in this place. This appears by diverse
places, where he makes mention of his old age, where he speaks of CAIUS
BALBILLVS, who was Prefect of Egypt under NERO, but most manifestly in the
beginning of his sixth book, where he speaks of that earthquake which shook
Campania, when as VIRGINIVS and MEMMIVS were Consuls. And these were some two
years before SENECAES death.

THE PREFACE.
AS much difference as there is (most virtuous Lucillius) betwixt Philosophy
and other Arts, The difference betwixt Philosophy and other sciences, and
betwixt that which is natural and the other that is moral.
so much suppose I that there is between that part of Philosophy that
concerns men, as the other that concerns the gods. This is more high and
courageous; it gives it self a larger scope, and not content with that which
she discovers by the eyes, suspecteth that there is somewhat more greater and
and more fairer, which Nature has locked from our sight. In brief, there is
as much difference betwixt the one and the other, as between God and man. The
one teaches what is to be done upon earth, the other what is done in heaven.
The one discusseth our errors, and ministers us light, whereby we may
discern the doubtful things in this life: the other raises us above that
gulf of obscurity wherein we were confounded, and having redeemed us from
thence, brings us thither where thi^ brightness shines. Verily I then
praise and give thanks unto nature when I behold her, not by this means which
is public, but when as I have entered her secrets. When I learn what the
matter of the world, is who is the author and conseruer thereof, what God is,
whether he be wholly intended in the contemplation of himself, or whether
sometimes he have ear of us, whether he do any thing daily, of whether he
has done it at once, whether he be a part of the world, or the world, whether
it be in his power to ordain something to day, and to derogate somewhat from
fatal destiny, whether it should be a divination of his majesty, and
confession of his error, to have made things that should be subject to change:
for it is necessary since that nothing can please him that is not perfectly
good, that those things which please him should be always the same; and yet
for all this is be no less free and powerful, for he is necessity himself.
If I were not admitted to the knowledge of these things, there was no necessity
why I should be borne: for what cause had I why I should be glad that I am
numbered and placed amongst the living? What to swallow down and dis-jest meat
and drink? what to glut this frail and decaying body that must perish, except
it be interchangeably nourished? or to live a slave to infirmity, or to fear
death, whereunto we are all of us borne? It thou take away from life this
inestimable good, it is not so much worth as to be swear or labored for. O how
contemptible a thing is man except he raise himself above humane things! Happy
is contemplation if it be rightly governed.

This is wrath and other passions of mind.


As long as we struggle with affections, what do we that deserves praise?
Although we get the upper hand, yet overcome we but monsters. What cause have
we to boast of our selves because we are unlike the worst men of the world? I
see not why he should take pleasure in himself that is stronger then a sick
man. There is great difference betwixt strength and good health. Thou have
escaped from the vices of the mind; thou art no hypocrite, nor flatterer, nor
double, nor soyled with uarice, which denies her self that, which she has
taken from all men, nor grounded in dissolution, which spends his goods and
money basely, and gets them likewise most villeinously; neither travailed
with ambition, which will not lead thee to dignity but by indignities. Thou
have as yet gotten nothing, thou have escaped many men's hands, but not thine
own. For that virtue which we affect is magnificent, not because it is a
blessed thing of it self to have wanted evil, but because it freeth the
mind, and prepares it to the knowledge of heavenly things, and makes it
worthy to come and accompany God. Then enjoys the mind the consummate and
complete good of humane condition, when as (treading all evil underfoot) he
flies to heaven and nestleth in the secret bosom of nature. Then takes he
delight in wandering amidst the stars, to laugh at the pauements of the rich,
and to deride the earth with all her gold, not only that I mean which she
has delivered out and given to make money of, but that also which she keeps
close hiddem, to content the avarice of prospertie. He cannot contemn the
porches, nor the house beams that are burnished with Iuory, nor the groves
planted upon the tops of houses, nor the rivers drawn and conuayed through
chambers before he has circled the whole world, and beholding the globe
thereof from above, small and for the most part covered with the Sea, and in
that place where it discovers it self, hugely desert, and either burnt or
frozen, without saying to himself: What a virtuous man's thought is that enuieth
the fruit^ of virtue.
Is this that point that is divided amongst so many Nations by fire and sword?
O how ridiculous are the bounds of mortal men? Let not the Dane pass beyond
the ri^er of I^^^r let Strimo include the Thracians, let Euphrates bound the
P^^thians, Danubia separate the Samaritans and the Romans, let Rhene border
Germany, the Pyr^nean mountains raise their heads betwixt France and Spain;
let the desolate vastness of lands divide Egypt from the Ethiopians. If we
should give humane understanding unto Ants, would not they likewise divide a
little Molehill of earth into Provinces? When as thou have raised thy self to
those things that are truly great, as often as thou shall see whole armies
marching with displayed engines, and as if there were some great matter in hand,
the horsemen now scowting and discovering before, now slancking the battle,
thou may freely say, The blacker Squadron trotteth through the Plains.
All this is but a business of Ants that labor in a Molehill. What
difference is betwixt them and us, The affairs of the world are trifles.
except it be in the measure of their little bodies? It is but a point wherein
you sail, wherein you go on warfare, wherein you dispose Kingdoms, yea, and
a very little one if a man consider the Ocean; that begi^teth it on every side.
A worthy description of vanity.
Above these there are spacious extent^, into the possession whereof the mind

cleansed from all ord^re, and being expedite and light, and contented with a

returns to his original. And this argument has he of his divinity, The

CHAP. 1.
But now let us come to our intended purpose. Hear that which Philosophy
teaches, Of the Meteors of ^^re.
as touching those fires that the air drives ouerthwartly. It is a sign that
they are driven by great force, because they are carried side-long, and by a
violent swiftness. It appears that they go not, but that they are forced.
And of these fires there are diverse forms. Lib. 1. Meteors of fire.
Aristotle calls a certain kind of these Goats. If thou ask me why, thou
must first of all give me a reason, why they are called young Kids. But if we be
agreed upon the name, as it is expedient, let none of us examine one another,
what this or that man says. They were called Goats, by reason they had some
resemblance of little ^eard^ hanging on them.
It shall be better to examine what the thing is, then to wonder at it, why
Aristotle called a globe of fire that is in the air a Goat. Such was that
which appeared as great as the body of the Moon, when Paulus AEmilius made
war against Perseus. And we our selves have oftentimes seen a flame in form
as great as a pillar, which notwithstanding in the very course thereof was
scattered. About the time that Caesar Augustus died, w^e saw the like Meteor,
and prodigy: we saw the like, when Scianus was adjudged to death; Whether
extra-ordinarie Meteors are fore-tokens of things to come.
neither was Germanitus death unaccompanied with the like presage. Thou will
say unto me, Art thou then so badly taught, as to think that the gods send
some predictions of death, and that there is any thing so great on the earth,
that the heavens should foresee the end? We shall find another time for this
matter: mean while we will see if all things be deduced by a certain order,
and the one so in^oulded in the other, that that which goes before, is either
the cause of those things that follow; or the sign. We will see whether the
gods have care of humane affairs, or whether the order of things discovers
by certain marks, that which ought to be done. Mean while, I think that
these fires are assembled by a vehement agitation of the air, when as the
inclination thereof has extended it self toward one part, and has not given
place, but sought within himself. From this encountrie and entershocke of the
air arise these pillar^, these globe^, these flashings. But when the air
assembleth more mildely and remains shut, there issue diuors impressions of
fire far lesser, and these crinite and bearded comets have their original,
then the fires that are less thick mark out their way, which appears not
very much, which they extend in the heaven, in such sort as there passed not a
night, wherein a man may not see such impressions in the ^ir^, because there
needs no great agitation to create them. To speak in a word, these
impressions have the same considerations, as lightnings, yet are they caused
which less force. Even as clouds being but indifferently broken one upon
another, cause flashes, and being impelled with greater force, breed
lightnings. Aristotle yields this reason. The globe of the earth exhaleth
diverse vapors, some moist, and some dry, some cold, and some other hot, and
fit to be enflamed: neither is it to be wondered at, that so many different
vapors issue from the earth, since in the heavens there appear diverse
colors, but some more fierce, as the fiery redness of the Dog-starre, some
more remiss, as that of Mars; some none at all, as that of Jupiter, but a pure
and clear shinning. It must therefore needs be, that in this so great
abundance of exhalations, that mount from the earth into the air, there must
some aliments of fire be raised to the clouds, that might fall on fire by
reason of their entershock, but also by the assistance of the beams of the
Son. For with as likewise we see that strawes that are besprinkled with
brimstone, draw unto them fire that is distant from them? It is likely therefore
to be true, this matter gathered together within the clouds, is as easily
kindled, and that the fires are great or little, according as the vapors have
been feeble or strong. For this were a foolish things to imagine that the
stars fall, or that they rise and mount again, or that any thing is taken
away or separated from them: because if this were so, by little and little
there should be no more stars, they should fail. For there is no night
whatsoever, during which a man ^^^th not diverse stars, that seem to shoot
forward or backward. But cont^^^^^ise, every one of them is found in his
accustomed place, and every one co^^^^^^ in their proportion. It follows
therefore, that these fires are engendre^ ^^^^rneath these stars, and continue
not long time, because they neither have foundation nor certain place. Why
therefore likewise are they not transferred, by day? What if I say that the
stars are not by day, because they appear not? Even as these remain hidden,
and obscured by the light of the Sun, so the Me^oors of fire run in the air,
as well by day as by night, but the brightness of the day hinders our eyes
from beholding them. Notwithstanding, sometimes the matter whereof they are
composed is so abundant and bright, that they are manifestly discovered even in
the daytime. In our age we have oftentimes seen diverse fires in the daytime,
the one gliding from the East to the West, the other from the West to the East.
The Mariners think it to be a sign of a tempest, when as many stars shoot^
but if there be a sign of winds, it is there where the winds are, that is,
in the air, which is in the midst between the Moon and the Earth. In a
vehement tempest there appear certain fires or stars that sit in upon the
sails, and at that time those that are in danger do^ suppose that they are
assisted by the god-heads of Gastor and Pollux. The fires called Castor and
Pollux.

These were Jupiters s^nnes by Laeda, who for their great valor and counning
by sea were reputed gods.


And their cause of better hope is, because already the tempest seems to be
allayed and the winds calmed. Sometimes these fires are carried, sometimes are
settled. When as Gilippus traveled toward Syracu^a, he saw a Star that settled
it self upon his lance. In the Roman Camp, in some men's judgment, there
appeared certain darts, as if set on fire by reason of fire of the air that
fell on them, which oftentimes after the manner of lightnings, are wont to blast
both men and tree^. But if they descend with a lesser force, Of falling fires.
yet slip they down and settle themselves without doing any hurt, or
inflicting any wound. Some of these break through the clouds, some other in
fair weather, if the air be fit to enkindle. For sometimes it thundereth in
fair weather, upon the same cause as it does in close and troubled air, which
is by reason of the collision of the air within it self, which although it be
clearer and drier, yet can meet together, and make some bodies that are like
unto clouds, Of thunders.
which by incountrie sound and make a noice: sometimes therefore there are
diverse pillars made, and sometimes shields, and images of vast fire, when as
the like, but greater cause falls upon such matter.

CHAP. II.
Of the circles and crowns that appear about the Sun and Moon.

Albert. lib. Meteor^log. tract. 4. cap. 8.


LEt us now see whence that light is made that enuironeth the Planets. It is
reported that upon the same day that Augustus returned from Apollonia and
entered Rome, there was seen a certain circle of diverse colors about the
Sun, after the manner of a Rainbow. The Grecians call this Hal^, and we may
properly call it a Crown. I will endeavor to express whence the cause hereof
is. When as a stone is cast into a Fish-poole, we see that the water makes
diverse circles, whereof the first is small, the second more great, the others
consequently g^^^^er, until the force of the stroke be vanished, and that the
water be settled as it was before. Let us suppose that some such matter is done
in the air, which becoming more thick may receive an impression, by the
means of the brightness of the Sun, or of the Moon, or of some Star, the
which enforci^g it self against the Sun, constrains it to retire, and to
fall in circles. For humiditie and air, and all that which takes form by
reuerberation, is imp^lled into the habitude of that thing that impelleth the
same. But all light is round, by means whereof it must needs be, that the air
beaten back by this brightness, must show it self in the same form. And
therefore it is that these shining circles are by the Grecians called Areae,
because that the places that are ordained to thr^sh corn in, are round for the
most part. But we think not that these, either Area, or Crowns, are caused
near unto the Moon, or the Sun, or other celestial bodies, for they are
few of them, although they seem to begirt and crown them. In what region of
the air.
This impression is made not far off from the earth, but our eyes being
deceived by their ordinary imbecilitie, thinks that it is placed just about
the star. But no such thing may be done near unto the Sun or the stars,
because the etheriall region is thin and transparent. It is in gross and
thick bodies, that such impressions are accustomed to be made, neither can
they take footing in subtle and thin bodies. We see I know not what such like
as these impressions about our lamps in the stoue, by reason of the obscurity.
They are made for the most part at such time as the Southern wind blows, In
what time.
when as the sky is covered and obscured. Sometime by little and little they
are dispersed and vanish, sometimes they break in some part, and from thence
the Sailers expect the wind where the flame first appears. For if it fail
to the Northward, a Northerly wind will follow, if to the Westward, a
Westerly, which is an Argument that in that part of the Heavens these crowns
are made, where ordinarily the winds are engendered: But the higher Region of
the air has none of these circles, because the Winds are lodged under it. To
these Arguments add this likewise, that a crown is never gathered there, but
where the air is settled and still. Otherwise it is never seen. For the air
that is settled may be pushed, extended, and molded into some form, but that
which is agitated cannot receive impression of the light, for it is not formed,
neither re^isteth, because every first part and portion thereof is scattered
and has no stay^ And therefore never shall we see any Planet whatsoever
crowned, except when the air is thick, and calm; by means whereof it is
capable to conserve the line which in appearance begirteth his round
brightness; and not without cause. For call again to thy remembrance the
example I proposed thee a little before. The stone that is cast into a
fish-poole or a lake or any settled water, makes innumerable circles, and this
it does not in a River. Why? Because the water that fli^th thus quickly, gives
not any leisure or means to the stone to form any figure. The same therefore
falls out in the air: for that which is settled may receive any impression,
but that which fleeteth and runs away swiftly, is incapable of form, and
disperseth every ^^gure that would approach it if it stayed. These circles being
scattered by little and little, and as it were confounded in themselves, express
the stillness, repose, and tranquillity of the air, and if they scatter but on
one side the wind comes from thence: if they be opened in diverse places some
storm will follow. How this comes to pass, it may be understood by those
things which I have declared already. For if the whole face of the circle
vanish, it appears that the air is moderate, and consequently still and
peaceable: if it be cut off but on one side, we see that the air is shaken on
that side that in opened, and that from the same the wind will blow. But when
it is dispersed in every part, it is a sign that it is assailed diverse ways,
and that the air stirs it self from one side to an other. By means
whereof it appears that a storm is at hand, and that there will be some
combat of the winds by reason of this inconstancy of the air, that whirleth
and turns it self thus from all parts. These crowns for the most part
appear about the Moon in the night time, and are noted about the other stars,
but seldom by day: so that some of the Grecians have denied that they are at
all, whereas Histories reprove and confute them. But the caus^ of this raritie
is this in that the light of the Sun is more strong, and the air it self
being agitated by the same, and being hot is less thick. But the power of the
Moon is more feeble, and therefore is it more easily sustained by the air
that inuironeth the same, and because that the other cel^stiall fires being
feeble cannot by their beams break or scatter the air, thence comes it
that these impressions are made at that time without any let, for they pierce
and plant themselves very easily in a solid matter, and that scatters not as
it does by day. The air likewise ought not be so thick, that it exclude and
drive away from him the brightness that is lent him, neither so thin and
attenuate that it gives not any means to the beams that beat upon it to stay
with him. This temperature properly falls out by night, when as the stars
reflect upon the same by their brightness, not violent or forcible, the air
gathers together and forms these circles, because it is more thicker then
in the day time.

CHAP. III.
Of the R^^ne-bow; the cause and form thereof, and why it appears not by
night.
COntrariwise, the Rainbow is never made by night, except very seldom,
because the Moon has not so much force to trauerse and color the clouds as
the sun has. For thus make they the form of the discolored Rainbow:
Because some parts in the clouds are more swelling, othersome more submisse,
some thicker then that the sun beams may be able to pierce them; othersome
so thin that they pass quite through them. This inequality mixeth together
this shadow and this brightness, and makes this wonderful variety in the
Rainbow. There is another reason given of this Rainbow; We see that when a
Pipe is broken in any place, that the water bubleth forth by a little crack:
and if the sun beats obliquely upon this water, it represents the diverse
colors of the Rainbow. The same shall thou see fall out, if at any time thou will observe a fuller, Examples to express this.
when as he has lightly filled his mouth with water, and besprinkleth his
cloth that is stretched on the Tenters. In this air besprinkled with water
there appears diverse colors, such as we see in the Arc. Doubt thou not but
the cause hereof is in the humor: for the Rainbow is never seen except it
be in rainie weather. But let us examine how it is made: Some say that there
are certain drops of water, How the Rainbow is caused.
beaten back by the sun and the clouds, so thick as the brightness cannot
pierce them, in such sort that from these drops there proceeds a shining, and
from the thick clouds a shadow; by means whereof, and by this incountrie the
Rainbow is made; one part whereof, which receives the sun, is shining, the
other that repulseth the same, and has made a shadow of it self to the
neighboring clouds, is more obscure. Others there are that are not of this
opinion. For this might seem true, if the Rainbow had but only two colors,
This opinion is examined.
and it consisted of light and shadow. But we although that colors infinite

drawn after the manner of subtle lines, as the Poet says, that whether they
be different colors thou can not know, except thou confer those of the one
side with those of the other; for their conjunction and assemblance blemisheth
and dazeleth the eyes: and therein is showed the admirable work of Nature,
because that that which began with things that were alike, ends in different.
To what purpose therefore serve these two colors of light and shadow, whereas a
reason is to be yielded of innumerable sorts. Some think that the Rainbow is
made thus: they say that in that part where it raineth, every drop of the
falling rain is a several mirror that represents the sun, then that this
great and infinite number of images long, large, and hollow, come and join and
mix themselves together; so that the Rainbow is an assembly of diverse
mirrours or representations of the same. To prove this, behold what they
allege: If in a fair and cleer^ day you set a thousand Basins in the Sun,
all of them severally represent his countenance. Put me a drop of water upon
every leaf of a tree, each one of these drops will have in it self the
resemblance of the Sun; but contrariwise a great standing poole represents
but one Sun. Why? Because all this limited plainness that has his brinks,
cannot be but one mirror: but if thou make partitions, and distinguishest by
diverse walls a huge and mighty Fish-poole, so many images shall thou have of
the Sun as there are several lakes. Leave that Fish-poole entire and one as
it was, thou shall observe but one sun. It is no great matter whether the
drop of water be small, or the Fish-poole narrow; if it has brimmes it is a
mirror of the sun. So then these infinite drops of water, carried by the
rain that falls, are as many mirrors, and have as many faces of the sun.
These appear confused to him that looks against them, and sees not their
distances, because the space suffers him not to distinguish the same.
Furthermore, in stead of so many faces there appears but one confused and
composed of all. The opinion of Aristotle as touching the colors in the Ark.
Aristotle is of the same opinion: From all that (says he) that is light and
thin, the sight repealeth unto it self his beams, but there is nothing
lighter then air or water; and therefore the radiations of our eyes return
from the thick air back again unto us. But if the sight be feeble and
infirm, it fails upon the least shocke that the air yields it. Some are
troubled with this infirmity, that they themselves seem to meet themselves,
and every where they behold their own image. Why? Because the weakness of
their sight cannot penetrate the air that is nearest them, but stays short;
so that whatsoever the fogges effect in others, every air works in these.
Every air how thin soever it be, has power enough to repulse a weak sight;
yet more easily may a thick air reflect back again unto us our sight,
because it cannot be pierced, but stays the beams of our eyes, and repelleth
them back again from whence they came. So then, since there are diverse drops
of water, they are as many mirrors; but by reason of their smalenesse they
represent only the color, and not the form of the sun. Moreover, when as
one and the same color is impressed in the infinity of drops, that fall
without intermission, it begins to be a face, not of many different images,
Of the diverse colors in the Arc.
but of one that is long and continued. How comes it to pass (says some
one) that thou tellest me that there is so many thousand of images here, where
I see not one? And since the sun is all of one color, why are these images
thus diverse colored? To answer thee hereunto, and to other such objections, I
must tell thee that there is nothing more incertaine then our sight, not only
in those things which she is hindered from seeing exactly, by reason of this
diversity of colors, but also in those things which she discovers hard at
hand. A Water-mans Oate being plunged into a little clear water, seems
either broken or crooked, although it be straight. Apples seem greater to
those that look upon them through a glass. The pillars in long Galleries seem
to be joined together, although there be a distance betwixt every one of them.
Return again to the sun it self, he whom reason approves to be greater
then the whole world, our eye has so contracted, that some wise men contend
that it has but a foot of Diameter. We know that he runs with a
swiftness surpassing all swiftness, yet none of us perceives any motion;
neither would we believe that he had kept on his course except it were apparent
that he moves. There is none of us that can observe the course of the heavens,
turning with a headlong and incredible swiftness, in such sort, that in the
twinkling of an eye he causes in diverse clymat^ of the world both day and
night; why then wo^drest thou that our eyes cannot discern the droppe^ of
^ater, or that the difference of these s^all images vanish from thy sight that
is so far distant? No man can doubt bu^ that the Rainebow is an image of the
Sun, conceived in a moist and hollow cloud. The reason is, because the
Rainebow is always opposite against the Sun, eyth^r higher or lower,
according as the Sun sets or rises, but by a contrary motion. For when
the Sun sets, Why the Rainebow appears opposite against the Sun.
the Rainebow is more high^ and if he rises above the Horizon, the Rainebow
is more low. Oftentimes such a cloud appears on the side of the Sunne^ which
makes nor a Rainebow, because it draws not an image by a right reflection.
But this variety is made for no other cause, but for that a part of the color
is in the Sun, and ^n other part in the cloud it self: Why there are diverse
col^urs in it.

so purple issues not in the same sort from the shell, A comparison from purple.
but it imports much how long time it has remained extinct, what suck it
has drawn either subtle or thick, or if it has received tin^ture one time
onely^ it is not therefore to be wondered at, considering that the Sun and
the cloud are two things, that is to say, the body and the mirror, if a man see
so many different colors which may arise or fall in diverse sorts: for of one
kind is the hea^ that proceeds from a fierce light, an other that proc^edeth
from a brightness not so shining and sparkling. To search out other causes, it
were extrauagant, considering that we have not any ground that may sustain
our discourse, except we should build upon conjectures, which have no end.
Here then it appears that there are two causes of the Rainbow, the Sun and
the Cloud, Two causes of the Rainebow.
for the Rainebow is never made in fair weather, neither then when it is so
close weather, that the Sun appears not, so then it is made of both,
without either of which it cannot be.

CHAP. IIII.
A con^i^mation of that which has been taken from the Arc, is formed by
opposition against the Sun, by the comparis^n of Artemido^us.
L^^ v^ add to that which is abo^e^^ide, another proof no less evident. The
image and representation which is made by reason of the mi^ror, never appears
^xcept the mirror be opposed in such sort, that a man may see ^h^ same in one
place, and the thing that it represented in an other tha^ is opposite. There
are certain reasons alleged by the Geometrician which persuade not, but
enforce; neyth^r has any man cause to doubt, but that the Arc is an image of
the Sun, which is badly expressed by reason of the d^f^^t and figure of the
mirror^ But let us (...) in ^he mean time to produce other proofs. Amongst
other arguments why the Arc is caused th^s^ I put this, that it is suddenly
made, and v^nish^th also as suddenly. But there is nothing more readily
represented then an image in a glass, for the mirror does nothing but only
represent the object. B^ri^n^s Artem^dorus adds, what kind of ^^oude it

f^lleth our when we behold a round and hollow cloud on one side of us, that
the image of the Sun which is severed from the Sun, is more turned toward
us; the yellow color therefore comes from the Sun, the blew proceeds
from the cloud, the other colors grow by a mixture of them both.

CHAP. V.
AGainst these things, these succeeding Arguments are aimed. There are two
opinions of mirrors; An objection against the compari^o^ precedent.
for some are of opinion that the resemblances are seen in these, that is the
figures of our bodies, sent forth and separated from our bodies: some say that
the images are not in the mirror, but that the bodies themselves are beheld;
the sight of the eye being retorted and reflected, and returned again into it
self. Now it appertains nothing to the matter, how we see, whatsoever we
behold, but how the like image should be represented by the looking glass.
What is so unlike as the Sun and the Rainebow, wherein neither the Center,
nor the figure, neither the greatness appears? for the Rainebow is longer
and more ample, and in the brighter part thereof more red then the Sun, but
in the other colors diverse. Again, when thou will compare a mirror with the
air, thou must give me the same leuity of body, and the same eqnality, and
the same brightness. But there are no clouds that have the similitude of a
looking glass, we oftentimes pass through them, and yet see not ourselves in
them. They that clime up to the tops of hills, behold the clouds, and yet see
not their image in the same. Every drop is a several mirror. I grant it, but
this I deny, that a cloud consists of drops. For she has some things
whereof she may create such drops, not herself, neither has a cloud any
water in it, but the matter of future water. I will likewise grant thee that
there are innumerable droppe^ in clouds, that yield some r^semblance, yet all
of them yield not one and the same, but every one has his apart. Again,
unite thou mirrors together, they will represent more then one face; for every
one will retain in himself the similitude of that he represents. There are
many mirrors that are composed of diverse small pieces, to which if thou
presentest but one man, yet there appears a multitude, every part expressing
and representing his own face. These though conjoined and placed together, do
not withstanding reserve unto themselves their images apart, and of one, they
make a multitude, yet confound they not that multitude, but distinguish it into
several faces. But the Rainebow is made all at once, and has but one only
face. What then? Is not the water that issues from a broken pype, or is
squirted or spit out of the mouth, wont to have some such like colors as we
see in the Rainebow. It Is true: but not for the same cause, as thou think,
because that every drop of water ^eceiueth the image of the Sun: for these
drops fall too soon to be able to receive any form. They must needly stay
to represent the same which they imitate. What is then done? They contract the
color and not the image of the Sun. Otherwise as Nero Caesar said most
learnedly; Fair Venus Dove, bending her neck aside,
In party colored plumes, does show her pride:
And as often as the Peacocke turns his head never so little, her party
colored plumes shine and sparkle: shall we therefore say, that these feathers
are Mirrors, who upon every inclination of the head, present new colors; as
much correspondence have the clouds with mirrors as those birds I told you,
and the Camelions and other kind of Creatures, who of themselves change their
colors, as often as either wrath or desire of generation makes them spread a
humor which gives a new tincture to the skin, or that they receive this
color by reuerberation of the light according as it beats upon them
directly, or obliquely. What resemblance is there betwixt mirrors and clouds?
mirrors are not transparent, but thick and of one piece, and matter:
contrariwise brightness trauerseth the clouds, which are thin, composed of
confused matter, by means whereof they cannot remain long times tied
together, but the one of them destroys the other. Besides, we see a part of
the heaven that is red, when the Sun rises, and sometimes we see clouds
that are colored like fire. What lets then but as they receive this color
by the arrival and encountry with the Sun, so also they should draw diverse
colors, although they have not the same efficacy as a mirror has? Thou said
not long since, (will some man say) that the Rainebow is always made by the
opposition of the Sun, because a mirror could not represent a face, if it
were not set opposite against the Sun. Herein, says he, we are aggrieed.
For even as we ought to set before the mirror the thing whose Image we would
have the glass to represent: so is it needful that the Sun beams should
beat directly upon the cloods, and that they should be near him to contract
color. This is their allegation, who would pretend that a cloud is colored.
Posidonius and they that think that a cloud is as a mirror, answer thus. If
there were any color in the Rainebow it would continue, and it should be seen
the more manifestly, the more nearer we were unto it: But now the image of the
Arch appears best when it is furthest of, the more it neereth us, the sooner
it dies. I cannot give way to this contradiction, when as I approve the
sentence. Why? I will tell you; because the cloud is colored, but so that the
color thereof appears not every ways; for the cloud it self appears not
every where; for no man sees the cloud wherein he is. What wonder then is it,
that the color thereof is not seen unto him, by whom she her self is not
seen? yet although she be not seen, she is; and consequently she has
color. So it is not an argument of a false color, because that in drawing
near unto the same, she cease to appear the same as she was before, for
the like falls out in the clouds themselves, which are not therefore false,
because they are not seen. Furthermore, when it is told thee, that the cloud
is straked with the Sun, it is not intended that this color was mixed as in
a hard, firm, and permanent body, but as in a fluid and flitting mass, which
receives neither form nor color but for a very little while. The better and
deeper tincture the Tyrian scarlet is, the higher must you hold the same, to
the end that the lusire thereof may show the better, Sen^caes opinion touchi^g
the ^^sh^^n of the Ar^h.
yet loses not in being near us his perfect color, but that tincture it
has, howsoever it be discovered, shows it self. Of that opinion am I that
Posidonius was, that the Arch is made when as the cloud is formed after the
manner of a mirror, hollow and round, like the half of a bowl. This cannot be
approved by the assistance of the Geometricians, who by invincible reasons
prove that the cloud is an image of the Sun, and yet resembles him not; as
likewise mirrors are not answerable wholly unto the truth of things. There are
some thou would be afraid to look upon, so deformed makes it their face to
appear that behold the same, by representing their similitude quite contrary.
Others of them are such, that in beholding them, will make thee think thy
self some worthy man, because that both thine arms, and the other members of
thy body will seem to be more greater and mighty then they are. Some of them
represent a true similitude of the face; others half the face; some there are
that lessen and turn it upwards. What is it therefore to wonder at, if the
sun be imperfectly represented in a cloud, as well as in these artificial
mirrors?

CHAP. VI.
AMongst other reasons, this shall be one, that the Arch never shows more
greater then the half of a Circle, The Prognostiques touching the Rainebow.
and that the less it is, the higher the Sun is. The mighty Arch does drink.
As our Virgil says, at such time as the rain is ready to fall, but the
Prognostiques of the Arch are diverse according to his situations. If it
appears in the south, it brings with it much rain, because that by their
abundance they could not be surmounted by the sun. Contrariwise, if it
appears in the west, there will follow but a dew and some little rain; and
if it be in the east, it is a sign of fair weather. But if the Arch be the
image of the sun, Why it appears greater then the Sun.
whence comes it that the Arch appears to be more great then the sun?
because the nature of some mirror is such, that it shows things to be more
greater then they were presented unto it, and will make the body appear of
more prodigious biggenesse: contrariwise, there are some that make things
seem far lesser then they be. Tell me why the face shows round in a
square mirror? happily thou may say, that it is thence whence this diverse
color proceeds; but I cannot tell thee whence this form comes, except in
thy hand thou have some pattern whereupon it is formed: But he has no other
then that of the sun, from whence thou must needely confess that the Arch
borrows his color, Of the color.
and consequently his form. Finally, we are agreede, that these colors which
we see in the Heavens proceed from the sun: but our difference is, because
thou maintainest that it is a color, and I say that it seems to be a
color, whether it be the one or the other, thou can not tell me why this
color vanishes suddenly, whereas all other lights are extinguished by
little and little. This apparition and disparrition of the Rainbow makes for
me: A proof that the comparison between the Rainbow and the mirror is
proper.
for it is the nature and property of a mirror not to show things in parts,
but wholly and at once. Every Image is made and unmade equally. To represent
the same or not represent the same, there needs no more to show it, or to
take it away. There is no proper substance or body in the cloud; it is but a
fiction and resemblance without the thing. Will thou know that it is thus? the
Rainbow will vanish if thou hide the Sun. I tell thee if thou oppose (I
say) another Cloud unto the Sun, the variety of the Rainbow will vanish;
yet is the Sun somewhat greater then the Arch. I have already answered, that
there are some mirrors which multiply the whole body which is presented unto
them: whereunto I add that all things seem more great, if they be beheld
through the water. Letters, although they be but small and obscure, appear more
greater and clearer, when they are read through a violl filled with water.
Apples seem more fairer then they be, if they swim in a glass. Examples
showing how the Rainbow seems more greater then the Sun.
Behold the Stars through a cloud, and thou will judge them more great,
because our eye slippeth in the humiditie, and cannot faithfully apprehend that
which it would. This appears clearly, if thou fillest a glass with water,
and castest into it some ring, for although the ring remains in the bottom,
yet the resemblance thereof appears in the top of the water. All that which a
man sees through the water, is far greater then the thing it self. What
wonder is it then, if in a moist cloud the image of the sun appears more
greater then natural. There are two reasons hereof: because in the cloud there
is somewhat that is like unto glass, which can shine: the other that has
somewhat of water, which although not formed, yet the nature thereof appears,
and finally, of a cloud we see that there comes rain.

CHAP. VII.
Of the triangles of glass that represent the ^olours in the Rainbow, and the
diffe^ence betwixt them and it.
BEcause (say thou) thou have made mention of a glass, even from the same
will I produce an argument against thy self. Men are accustomed to make
certain rods of glass very narrow, wherein there ar^ diverse angles, and knots
or points. If these be showed athwart the Sun, they represent the same
colors of the Rainbow, so that thou see that in it there is not the image
of the Sun, but an imitation of his color by reuerberation. In this thine
argument there are many things that make for me. First, this glass ought to be
thin, and as it were a mirror to reflect the Sun. Afterward it appears,
that in stead of a right color, it makes a representation of a false colo^r,
such as the neck of pigeons in turning themselves does, and changes diverse
colors. The same is in a mirror wherein no man perceives any color, but an
appearance of strange colors. This only remains to be resolved, why a man
sees not the Image and representation of the Sun in these rods? They are not
capable to express the same well, the matter is polished and disposed
thereunto, by means whereof they enforce themselves to represent the Sun; but
it is impossible, because both their form and fashion repugneth the same. If
they were made and fashioned with convenient proportion, they would represent
as many suns, as many insectures as they had: but because their divisions are
confused, they have not so great brightness as a mirror, they only begin to
make representations of the sun, and finish them not, and for that they are
near, they confound all these representations and images together, whence the
appearance of color proceeds.

CHAP. VIII.
But why does not the Rainbow, Why the Arth is but hal^^^ circle.
in stead of this great and half circle it makes, become wholly round? Some
think thus, that the sun being far more higher then the clouds, beats not,
but upon the upper part, whence it follows that the inferior i^ not
attainted with light. Entertaining the sun therefore but in one part, they
likewise represent but a part of the sun, and this part is never more great
then the half. This reason has no great waight^ Why? because tha^ although
the sun incl^neth toward the higher part, yet beats he upon the whole
cloud. He has colored it then: why not? since it is his custom to dart his
beams, and to penetrate through every thickness. Moreover, they contradict
their own intent; for if the sun be above, and for this cause reflecteth
only on the higher part of the clouds, never will the Arc descend unto the
earth; but we see that it extends it self even unto the ground^ Furthermore,
the Arch is always opposite against the sun, neither appertains it any thing
to the matter, whether it be above or beneath the same, because that every
place that is opposite against the sun, cannot but be beaten with the beame^
thereof. Again, sometimes a Westerly sun causes a Rain^bow, when a^ he
reflecteth upon the clouds beneath; and is nearest to the earth, which a^ that
time has but his half circle, although the clouds receive the sun, when he
tends to his declination. The Stoickes that would have the light appear in
the cloud, as a fire does in the mirror, say, that the cloud is hollow, and as
it were a half bowl, which cannot make an entire globe, because it is only a
part thereof. I approve their intention, but not their argument. For if in the
cauitie of a mirror, all the face of the opposite orb is expressed, then in an
half orb there is no cause why the whole globe may not be beheld, and if we
have said heretofore that a man sees entire circles of the same colors as the
Rainbow, enuironing the Sun and the Moon: whence comes it in the mean
space, that these circles are entirely whole, and the Rainbow is never but
half a circle? Again, why do hollow clouds, and such as are not flat and
round, receive and entertain the sun? Aristotle says, That after the
AEquinoctiall in Autumn the Rainbow is made every hour of the day, but that
in Summer it is never seen, but upon sunrise, or sunset. The cause is
evident. First, because about noonested the sun is so strong that he disperseth
the clouds, by means whereof he cannot impresse his image in them. But in the
morning and evening he has least force, and therefore the clouds may sustain
and repulse him. Moreover, whereas he is not accustomed to form the Arch,
except at such time as he is opposite to those clouds where he causes the
same; when the days are shorter, then is he always oblique. Therefore in
every part of the day, yea even at midday there are certain clouds, that he
may oppositely beat upon. But in Summer time he is carried above our heads, by
means whereof, at noonday he beholds the earth so directly, that there is
not any cloud that can be opposed against him, for at that time they are all
under him.

CHAP. IX.
NOw must I speak of rods or windgales, which are no less colored and diverse
then the Rainbow, Of rods that are imperfect Arkes.
which notwithstanding cease not to foretell rain, we need not stand long upon
this matter, for such rods or windgales are no other things, but imperfect
Rain-bowes. For these have a discolored face, yet have they nothing crooked in
them. For they appear for the most part near unto the sun in a moist cloud,
that begins but to spread, so that they have the same color that the
Rainbow has, but not the form, because the form of the clouds, when they
extend themselves, is different also.

CHAP. X.
THe like variety is in Crowns, but in this they differ, because Crowns are
made every where wheresoever the sun is, the Rainbow is not made, but in
opposition against the sun, the rods but near unto the sun. I can likewise
this way deliver a difference of all; if thou diuidest a crown, it is a
Rainbow, if thou straighten it, it is a rod? In all of them there is a
multiplicitie of colors, of blew, red, and yellow. Only the rods are nearest
to the sun, the Rain-bowes all of them are either solare, or lunare, crowns
are made about all the planets.

CHAP. XI.
THere appears likewise another sort of rods, when as small, scattered, and
long beams address themselves together, Of Parelies.
and streme from out some straits of the clouds. These ^re fore-tokens of
vehement raines. But what shall I say here? What name shall I give unto these
rods? Are they the Images of the sun? The Historians call them Suns, and
write that two of them appeared, and sometimes three: the Grecians call them
Parelia, because they are ordinarily seen near unto the sun, or because
they resemble the sun somewhat, for they imitate not the whole, but his image
and figure. Otherwise they have no heat or vigor whatsoever, they are dull and
imperfect. What name then shall we give them? Shall I do as Virgil did, who
in the beginning doubted of the name, and afterward gave that whereof he
doubted. What shall I call thee Rhetica divine,
Contend not therefore with Palernian wine.
There is nothing that can hinder us from calling them by the name of Parelia.
These are images of the sun in a thick and neighboring cloud, in the form of
a mirror. Some say that they are round clouds, shining, and like unto the
sun. For they follow him, remaining always with him, as long as they dure in
equal distance from him: no man is afraid to behold the image of the sun in
any fountain or still water, but the face hereof may appear as well above as
beneath, provided that he find proper matter to represent the same face.

CHAP^ XII.
AS often times as we would discover whether there were an ^clipse of the sun
or no: Of the eclipses of the Sun, and how they are discovered.
We fill certain basins with oil or pitch, because a thick humor is not
troubled so easily, and therefore retains the images that are offered unto
it. But the images and representations cannot appear, except it be in that
which is liquid and still. At that time are we wont to mark, how the Moon
opposed her self against the Sun, how s^e hides him, being greater then her
self, by the opposition of her body, now in part, if it happen that their
encountrie be but oblique, sometimes she obscureth him, being right under him.
This is called an entire defection and eclipse, during which we see the Stars,
and the brightness of the day is lost, that is to say, at such time as the Sun
has the Moon right under him. Even as therefore upon the earth we may behold
the image of them both; so may a man see them in the air, when as it is so
still and fair, as the face of the Sun is imprinted therein, which other
clouds receive likewise, but let slip, if either they are too moveable, or too
rare, or too sullen. For the moveable scatter him, the rare and clear let him
slip, the thick and darksome feel him not, no more then on the earth spotted
mirrors represent a perfect form unto us.

CHAP. XIII.
AFter the same manner likewise two Parelie are wont to be made. Of double
Parelies.
For what lets it, but that there may be as many as there are clouds that
are fit to represent the image of the Sun? Some are of that opinion, that as
often as they see two such representations, that they judge the one to be of
the Sun, the other of the image if self. For amongst us likewise, when as
diverse mirrors are disposed so, that the one is in the sight of the other, all
of them are filled, but yet there is but one image of the thing; the other are
the resemblances of that image. For it is no matter what the thing is, which is
showed in a mirror, because it represents all that which is set before it. So
there likewise in the air, if any casualtie dispose the clouds, so as they
behold one another: the one cloud will represent the Sun it self, and the
other represent the image of the Sun. But such clouds as these ought to be
thick, light, shining, and entirely of the nature of the Sun; and therefore
all these representations are white, and resemble the Crescent of the Moon,
because their brightness proceeds from an oblique reuerberation of the
sun. For if the cloud be beneath the sun, and nearer unto him, she is
dissipated by him, and being set far off, of him, she cannot sufficiently
entertain his beams, to make show of an impression, as mirrors represent not
our faces which are far off from them, because the sight of our eye has not
recourse unto us back again. Furthermore, the Parelie or Suns betoken rain
(for I will use the Historiographers name) especially if they show toward the
Southward, where the clouds are especially gathered: when such impressions as
these begirt the sun on every side, if we believe Aratus, it foretokeneth a
Tempest.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of other diverse sorts of fiery Meteors.
IT is time now to consider those other fires, which have diverse appearances,
sometimes there shines a star, sometimes the heaven is as it were inflamed,
sometimes there are fixed and inherent fires, sometimes they stay not in one
place. There are many kinds of these seen; sometimes there are fires that
outwardly are begirt with a crown, and inwardly flame. Sometimes the heavens
gather together, in such sort as if they seemed to be some round trench. There
are some that are called Pithyae, when as the greatness of a gross and round
fire, like unto a town runs in the heavens, or else burns it self to
nothing in one place. Furthermore there are Casma is when much vapor is
inflamed in a watery cloud, or one that is very thin.
Chasmata, when as sometimes a space of the heavens opens it self, and
gaping wide seems as it were in the secret thereof to show a burning flame:
and all these Meteors are of different colors, some of intended redness, some
of a slighter and fainter flame, some of a cleerer and whiter light, some
sparkling, and some equally yellow, without irruptions or radiations: we see
therefore The longest tract of stars grow white behind.
These shoot and fly like stars, and seem to shoot out long trains of
fire, by reason of their immeasurable swiftness, when as our eye cannot
discern their passing by, but wheresoever they ran, believed that all that
part was on fire. For such is the swiftness of their motion, that we cannot
apprehend their distances, but only see their ends. We see better the place
where the body of a fiery star presents it self, then the way that it
holds. He therefore design^th all his course, as it were with a continual
fire, because the slownesse of our ^ight follows not the moments of his race,
but sees at once both from what place it issued, and whether it attaineth;
which falls out in lightning; for the ^ire thereof seems long unto us,
because he ouerslippeth his space in the twinkling of an eye, and all that
circuit encountreth with our eyes, whereby it is discharged; yet is it not an
extended body, that it may occupy all the space of the way whereby it
comes: for things so long and extenuated have no force to give a violent
assault. Whence this li^htning and darting of them proceeds.
How therefore do these fires issue? When the fire is enkindled by the
collision of the air, it is violently pushed downward by the wind; and yet is
it not always caused by wind or by collision. Sometimes it is bred by reason
of some opportunity of the air; because that in this higher region there are
diverse things that are dry, hot, and terrestrial amongst which it is bred,
and the matter that feeds it fails very suddenly, and therefore is it
violently carried and vanished away. But why is it that his coulor is diverse?
what imports it, what that is which is enkindled, and how vehement it is,
Their signification.
whereby it is set on fire? But this fall of this fire signifies wind, from
that part from whence it breaks forth.

CHAP. XV.
THou ask me likewise how those lightnings are engendered which the Graeci^ns
call Sela, How lightnings are made.
in diverse sorts as it is reported. It may be that the force of the wind
breeds them, or the heat of the highest heaven may produce them: for when as
the ^lementary fire is spread every where, sometimes it embraces inferior
things if they be disposed to take fire. The motion of the stars may by his
course enkindle this fire, and transmit it to inferior bodies. What then? Can
it not be that the air repulseth that virtue which it has from fire, as far
as the aethereall region, whence afterward there follows a lightning or
enkindling of a star, or some such like darting fire? Of these lightnings, some
fall directly downwards, resembling shooting stars, some remain in a certain
place, and shoot forth so much light as may disperse darkness, and represent
the day, until such time as having consumed their nutriture, they first of all
become obscure, and afterward after the manner of a flame that is extinguished
in it self by continual diminution they are reduced to nothing. Of these some
appear in the clouds, some above the clouds, when as the thick air has
drawn that fire as high as the stars, which it had long time nourished and
entertained near unto the earth. Some of these ^uffer no delay, but run here
and there, and are extinguished in that place where they first appeared. These
are truly called lightnings, because their appearance is short and of small
continuance. Neither fall they without some mischief; for oftentimes they do
as much mischief as tempestuous fire-breaks. By these have we seen the tops
of houses s^rooken, which the Gaecians call Astropoplecta. Continued lightnings
or Comets, and their diverse sorts
But these continued lightnings which have their fire more strong, and which
follow the motion of the heaven, or that have a particular tract, are called
Comets, according to the opinion of the Stoics, whereof I am to entreat.
There are diverse sorts of these; some bearded, some like Torches or Lamps, some
are called Cyparissiae, and others whose fire is scattered and long in their
breaking forth. Some doubt whether they ought to put in the rank of these
Comets those beams and tombs of fire that are seldom seen. For they have
need of much matter, and conglobation of fire, considering that sometimes their
body is so great that it surpasses the thickness and roundnesse of the rising
sun. Amongst them thou may place these fires which are oftentimes
mentioned in histories and whereof sometimes the brightness is so heigh that such
fiery boddies seem to be placed amongst the stars, otherwhiles it is so low
that it seems to be the burning of some howses, that are far from the place
where we are. In the time of the Emperor Tiberius the horse men galloped to
succor the inhabitants of Ostia, supposing that their City was set on fire;
but it was a heat of the heavens, and a brightness of fire, thick and foggy,
which had shined for a great part of the night. Of these no man doubts but
that they have a flame which they show, and their substance is certain.
Whether the Rainbow and Crown^^ be but appearances.
The question is of the former, I mean of the Rainebow and crown, whether
they deceive the sight and are but counterfeit, or whether they have truly that
in them which appears. Our opinion is, that neither the Rainbow or Crowns
have any certain body. For in esteem that there is not any thing but
fallacious in mirrors, which do but represent a body subsisting without them;
otherwise it would remain therein, and could not be hidden or defaced by any
other Image, neither should a man in one instant see so many infinite forms
both appear and vanish in one and the same mirror. What is it then? They are
Images and vain representations of true bodies, nay which is more, there are
some artificial mirrors found, which may make some things appear far
contrary to that they are; for, as I said; there are some mirrours that make
their faces seem crooked that look into the same, and some there are that make
their show infinitely more huge, and exceeding humane habit, and the measure
of our bodies.

CHAP. XVI.
A monster of intempera^cy: a shame of Rome the villeinous Hostius.
IN this place I will tell thee a story, to the end thou may understand that
lust forgets not any instrument to provoke his desire, but is diligent and
ingenuous to excite his own fury. There was a man called Hostius so
uncleanly and villeinous, that he was not ashamed to make show of his
securrilitie and filthiness in the public Theater. This rich and covetous
wretch was owner of two millions and five hundredth thousand crowns; yet Diuus
Caesar after that his slaves had murdered him, judged that he was unworthy
that any man should revenge his death, and yet notwithstanding would he not
declare that he was justly slain. He was not only impure in respect of one sex,
but he surfetted in his lust both toward men and women, and made certain
mirrors of that fashion, whereof I late made mention, that showed the images of
men far greater then they were, wherein one finger exceeded the arm in
measure, length, and thickness. These did he dispose in such sort that when he
endured the company of men, he saw in the mirror all the execrable motions of
him he had admitted, enjoying by this means a false greatness of their
members, as if it had been true. In all bathes he made his choice, and chose
him men by the open measure of their length, yet notwithstanding delighted he
his insatiable lusts with fained appearances also. Go now and say that
Looking-glasses were invented for uncleanness sake. It is shameful to be
spoken what this monster (worthy to be torn with his own teeth) both spoke
and did; when as on every side mirrors were opposed against him, to the end he
might be a beholder of his own heinous villeinies. And those things which a
secret conscience would suppress, and such as any one being accused thereof,
would be ashamed to confess: these thrust he not only into his mouth, Modest
^i^s blush and Ch^isti^n ears abhor th^se rela^ions: shamel^sse; read i^
with shame, for such like actions, O can the^e be such? br^^de confusion ^or
^uer.
but into his eyes. But undoubtedly heinous sins are afraid to behold
themselves. The most desperatest villains, and they that are disposed to all
dishonor, feel that the tenderness of shame easily seizes their eyes. But
this man, as it were a trifle to suffer things unheard of, and unknown in his
own person, has made them come before his sight, and was not only contented
to see the greatness of his sin, but thought good to plant about himself
his mirrors, whereby he divided, and disposed his villeinies. And because he
could not so diligently observe and see, at such time as he was seized upon,
and his head hidden, and his body tied to the shameful part of some villeinous
buggerer, he represented his monstrous action to himself by resemblances: he
saw in his mirrors the surquedry of his mouth, he beheld the men whom he
received upon all the parts of his body. Sometimes dividing himself betwixt a
man and a woman, and abandoning his person to suffer both ways, he beheld
those villeinies which a man durst not either imagine or name. What has this
impure catife left himself to do in the darken^sse? He feared not the day,
and durst show himself those monsterous embracements, and approve them unto
himself. What? do thou think that he would not be painted in that habit?
There is some modesty in those that are prostitute and harlots, and they cover
in some sort those bodies of theirs, which are the objects of public disgrace,
whereby their unhappy patience may lie hidden, so that in some sort the very
brothel-house has modesty in it. But that Monster made a public spectacle
of his uncleanness, and showed those things to himself, to cover and hide
which no night were dark enough. I, says he, endure both a man and a woman
at once, and notwithstanding in that part also which is left me to some
disgrace, I exercise the part of a man. All my members are exercised in
pamardice; it is therefore requisite that mine eyes should have their part, and
that they should be witnesses and controllers. Even those things which by
situation are hidden from the sight of our bodies, are visited by art, least
any man should think that I know not what I do: nature did nothing when she
gave a man so feeble instruments to execute his lusts, and when she has
learned bruit beasts a more perfect contentment in their encountries. I will
find a means how I may deceive and satisfy my infirmity; whereto should my
iniquity serve me; if I should not sin more then nature has taught me? I
will set these kind of mirrors about me, that may present an incredible
greatness of forms. If I might have liberty I would make them truly as
great, and because I may not, I will feed my self with the similitude; my
villainy shall see more then it can conceive, and shall admire at his own
patience. O detessable wickedness. This man perchance was killed quickly, and
before he saw these things. He deserved to be massacred before his mirror.

CHAP. XVII.
LEt those Philosophers therefore be now derided who dispute thus of the nature
of mirrors, Of the use of mirrors upon the occasion of the former comparison.
enquiring whence it comes that our face shows thus, and turns toward us
what pretended the nature of things, that after she had given us true bodies,
she would likewise that a man should see these images? To what end was is to
prepare this matter that was fit to entertain forms? It was not to the end we
should pluck our beards by a looking glass, or to polish a man's face, nature
has not allowed dissolution any thing to exercise her folly in: but first of
all, Because our eyes are to feeble to behold the sun at hand, to the end
that they might comprehend the form of the same, she discovers it in a more
du^ler light. For although we may behold him both at his rising and his
setting, yet should we not know his true form in his resplendent brightness,
if his face were not showed us more easily to be observed in some pure and
polished thing. Secondly, we should not see the eclipses, neither might we know
what it is if we did not more easily upon the earth perceive the images both of
Sun and Moon. Thirdly, mirrors have been invented to the end that a man might
know himself. Of this invention have followed diverse benefits, first the
knowledge of our selves, afterward the resolution of some occurrents. The
fair ought to learn herein how to avoid infamy: the foul, to redeem by
their virtuous behavior, the imperfection of their countenance: The young, to
remember themselves that being in their flowring years, that it is time for
them to learn, and attempts actions of value: The old, to ^^ake off all
misse-beseeming actions that are unfitting for their white hairs, and to
meditate on death. For this cause nature ministered us the means to see our
selves. A clear fountain, and every bright stone reflecteth our minds. Late
did I see my self from of the shore,
When seas were calmed and tempest stirred no more.
What were these fellows, think thou, that combed themselves by this
glass? That age was more simple, the men contented themselves with that which
next came to hand, as yet the benefits of Nature were not wrested unto vice,
neither was her invention employed and ravished to satisfy dissolution and
excess. At the first, as casualtie offered the opportunity, so men discovered
their faces: but afterward, when as self-loue had insinuated it self amongst
mortal men, and made every man believe that he was fair and well pleasing,
they oftentimes despised those things, wherein at the first they saw and beheld
themselves. But when the world became evil, and began to puzzle themselue^ in
the earth, the use of Iron was first found out, which had not brought with it
any incommoditie, Whence dissolution grew.
had men contented themselves therewith. But other mischiefs began to burgen
out of the earth, which by their luster began to appear, and please those
which otherwise thought not thereupon, so that the one conceived a delight in
beholding a goblet, another an instrument made of brass, and fit ^or service,
and not to be beheld. Anon after some part of the earth was ordained to this
service, although in other respects: silver shined not as yet, but some other
matter more brittle and of less value. At that time also when as these old
fathers lived temperately, yet cleanly enough, if they had washed away the
sweat and dust, which they had gathered by their daily travel in the fleeting
stream; it was enough for them to stroke down their hair, and to comb
their long beards, and in this time every one served himself, and assisted
others. That hair which in times past was usually wont to be scattered by men's
hands, was dressed and handled by women, but they that had a fair hair,
contented themselves with the natural growth thereof, as we s^e Horses and
Lions do. But afterward, when as dissolution had gotten the better hand of
the world, men made mirrors of gold and silver as great as the body, and
afterward garnished them with precious stones, in so much as one of them cost
a woman more silver, then in times past would have sufficed to endow the
daughters of great Captains, that were married upon the common purse. Think
thou that those daughters had a mirror enchased with gold, whereas they were
enforcd to borrow silver to marry them? O happy poverty, the cause of so
worthy a renown. Had they been rich^ the Senate had not allotted them their
dowry. But whosoever he was that had the Senate for his father in law,
understood that he had received a dower, which it was not lawful to restore.
At this day the sum of money that was furnished by the Senate for the
daughters of Scipio, was not sufficient to buy a glass for the daughters of
enfranchised slaves. For dissolution invited by little and little by her
riches, is animat^d to much immodestie: and vices are grown to their full
maturitie. In brief, by such devices all things have been so confused, that
that which we call a woman's cabinet, is an equipage of men, nay I will say
less, even soldiers baggage. But now the mirror which was only admitted for
ornament sake, is made a necessary instrument to whatsoever vice.

The end of the first Book of Natural Questions.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS. The second Book.
CHAP. I.
ALl that which a man may draw in qu^stion in respect of the Universe, A
division of Philosophy into three parts, according to Seneca.
is divided into celestial, acriall, or earthly things. The first part
examineth the nature of the stars, and the greatness and form of those fires,
wherein the world is included: whether the heaven be solid and of a firm and
concreate matter, or compact of a subtle and thin substance: whether it
dr^ueth or is driven: whether the stars are under it, or fixed in the
contexture thereof: how the Sun observes the annual changes; or whether he
observes an oblique course, and other such like questions. The second part
entreats of the impressions of the air, and such as converse betwixt heaven
and earth. Of this sort are mists, raynes, snowes, and thunders that astonish
men's minds. In brief, whatsoever the air does or suffers, these call we
sublime, because they are higher then the lowest. The third part sufficiently
debateth upon fields^ land^, trees, and plants, and (to use the Lawyers phrase)
all that which the earth contains. Whence comes it to pass (say thou)
that thou have put the question of the motion of the earth in that place, Why
be intermixeth the questions of the Meteors.
wherein thou art to discourse upon thunder and lightning? Because that the
trembling of the earth is caused by the violence of the wind, which is but
agitated air, which although it plung it self under the earth, yet ought we
not to consider it there, but in that place where nature has lodged it. I will
tell thee a thing that shall be more wonderful, I must entreat of the earth
amongst celestial things. Why, say thou^ Because that when we discuss in
this place the properties of the earth, whether she be broad and unequal, or
immeasurably extended in length, whether it be compact wholly in the form of a
bowl, or assembleth her parts into an Orb, whether she enclose the waters, or
the waters have enclosed and covered her, whether she be a sluggish or a
senseless creature, or a body full of spirit, but coming from another place,
and such other like things that properly have a relation or dependence on the
earth, and, if a man may so speak it, are placed in the rank of those things
that are most base. But in questioning what the situation of the earth is, in
what part of the world it has been settled, how it is opposed against the
heaven and the stars, this question exceeds the precedent, and is more high.

CHAP. II.
Of the Elements or simple body, whereof one is the air.
BEcause I have made mention of those parts, into which all the matter of things
created are divided, I must speak some thing in general, and first of all
presuppose, that amongst the bodies that are simple, whence proceed those that
are composed, some reckon the air. Thou shall understand what this is, and why
I must speak thereof, if I aim my discourse more higher, and if I say, that
there is something continued, and wholly one, and some thing contrariwise,
consis^ing of diverse parts. Continuation is a continual conjunction of parts
amongst themselves. Unity is a continuation witho^t intermission, and a touch
of two bodies united in themselves. Is it to be doubted that amongst these
bodies which both we see and handle, which are either felt or feel, but that
there are some compound? These are such by conn^xion or aceruation, as for
example, a rope, corn, or a ship. Again, some not compounded, as a tree or
a stone. Therefore thou must needly grant, that amongst those things likewise
which are separated from sense, but are apprehended by reason; there is in some
of them a unity of bodies. See how I spare thine ears, I could acquit my
self, if I would use the Philosophers terms, and say, unite bodies, but since
I forgive thee this, see likewise that thou give me thanks. Why so? I^ at any
time I shall say one, remember thy self that I refer this not unto number,
but unto the nature of the body not composed by external help, but by his
own unity: by this note, air is one of the simple bodies.

Of the parts, and of the matter of the world.
CHAP. III.
THe world comprehends all these things which can fall within our knowledge,
of these some are parts, some are left in stead of matter: all nature wants
matter, even as every art that is Manuel. What this is, I will make it more
plain. The hands, the bones, the nerves, the eyes are a part of us, the suck
of that meat which we retain, and such as must be distributed into parts,
the matter: Again, blood is as it were a part of us, which notwithstanding is
a matter also: for it prepares other things likewise, and notwithstanding it
is of the number of these, by whose means the whole body is made.

CHAP. IIII.
Air so is a part of the world, The air is a necessary part of the world.
yea and a necessary part, for this is it that unites both heaven and earth,
that so separateth the lowest from the highest, that notwithstanding they are
joined by it. He separateth them because he is in the midst of them, and
unites them, because both of them by his means are agreede together. All that
which is sent him from the earth, he communicates with the heavens. Again,
he imparteth to terrestrial things, the efficacy of celestial bodies, which
so call I a part of the world, as I do beasts and plants, for both these kinds
of beasts and plants are a part o^ the world, because they have been created
as things necessa^y to perfect the whole, and because the whole cannot consist
without them, but one living creature and one plant is as it were a part, for
although it should die, yet that which is cut off, is of the whole: but air as
I have said cleaves both to heaven and earth, it is borne both and with the
one and the other, but that has unity, whatsoever is a native part of any
thing, for nothing is borne without unity.

CHAP. V.
THe earth is both a part of the world and the matter. The earth is a part
also^ and the master of the world.
I think thou will not ask me why it is a part, for as well may thou ask
me why the heaven is a part, for no more can the universe be without this,
then without that; but it is composed of these parts, by means whereof he
maintains all their stars in their being and vigor, all living creatures and
all plants. It is the heaven and earth that ^urnisheth all creatures and the
world (that requires so many things) with all their vigor, that maintain so
many celestial bodies in their being, turning so swiftly continually, and so
greedily both in their motion, and in their nourishment. In brief, by the
means of heaven and earth, all the nature of things r^ceyueth that which is
needful for it for his nourishment and conservation. From them likewise has
the world drawn all that which she needs, as long as he shall endure. I
will propose unto thee a little example to make thee comprehend so great a
thing: Eggs contain as much humor as is necessary for the being o^ that
creature which is to be hatched.

CHAP. VI.
THe air is so continuate with the earth, Whereof the air is composed.
and so united with it, that as soon as she departs from her place, he
supplieth it^ It is a part of the whole world, A refutation of the error of the
Epicure, who composeth the air of Atoms.
and yet the same, and receives whatsoever nutriment the world sends him, in
which respect we must take it for matter and not for a part. Hence is all
inconstancy and tumult, this do some men compose of distant small bodies, as
of dust, and depart very much from the truth; for never is there an accord of a
body that is framed of parts, but by unity when as the parts ought to consent
to the intention, and to add strength thereto. But the air if it be divided
into Atoms, that is to say into small parts, is scattered. And such things as
are scattered, may not be maintained. These things that are swollen and yield
not to the stroke, The ^orce of the air express^d by effects.
will show thee the intention and force of the air. Thou shall perceive it in
weighty things, which are carried away by the wind for a great space. Thou
shall perceive it by voices, which are either more feeble or stronger,
according as the air is moved: for what is a voice, but an intention of the
air, to the end it may be heard, formed by the repercussion of the tongue?
What is every course and motion, are they not the works of agitated air? this
is it that gives force to the nerves, and swiftness to those that run: This
it is that when it is vehemently moved and troubled in it self, Diverse
compari^ons to confirm th^^ refutation.
renteth up trees and forests, and bearing up whole houses on hie, at last
breaks them in peec^s. This it is that increases the sea when it is calm
and still. Let us come to lesser matters; for what ^ong is there without the
intention of the spirit? Cornets and Trumpets, and those that by some pressure
yield a greater sound then may be delivered by the voice, do they not
enlarge their sounds by the intention of the air? Let us consider the great
efficacy of ^eedes so small, as scarsly a man may discern them, if these fall
into the clefts of stones, yet do they push forth and wax great in such sort,
that they riue and cleave hugh stones in sunder, and dissolve them in a moment,
and small and tender roots in their beginning is succession of time skorne and
break both stones and rocks: what else is this but an intention of spirit,
without which there is nothing strong, and against which nothing may resist?
And by this, if by nothing else we may conceive that there is an unity in the
air, because our bodies are united in themselus; for what else is it that
contains them but spirit? by what other thing is it that our mind is
agitated? What is his motion but an intention? What is intention, but out of
unity? what unity except it were in the air? and what other thing produces
fruits and weak seeds, and rayseth flourishing trees, and extends their
branches, and stretches them out on high, then the intention and unity of the
spirit.

CHAP. VII.
That the air is a full body, and not void, n^yther in whole nor in part.
SOme tear and rent the air into small pieces, so as they intermixe void with
it, and they think it to be an Argument that the air is not a full body, but
that it contains much vacuity in it, because birds have so easy a motion
therein, because both small and great may have their passage through it: but
they are deceived; for the like facility likewise is in the waters, and yet may
no man doubt of their unity, which so entertain bodies, that they always
join themselves to them. This do the Latins call Circumstance, and the
Graecians Perist^sis, which is as well within the air, as in the water: For it
enuironeth every body by which it is impelled. There is no need therefore of any
void to intermixe therewith. But of this in an other place.

CHAP. VIII.
But now it is to be gathered that there is a certain vehemence in Nature, Of
the agitation and power of the air.
and that of great force: for nothing is vehement but by intention, and yet
undoubtedly nothing can be intended by any other thing, except it be intended
by it self, for we say after the same manner, that nothing can be moved by
another, except something were moveable of it self. But what is it that may be
thought to have more intention of it self then spirit? And who is he that will
deny that this is intended, when he sees the earth, the mountains, houses,
and many walls, great Cities with the people, and all the Sea-shoares shaken?
The swiftness and great extent of the air shows his intention. The eye
presently intends his sight through many miles, one voice at one time
resoundeth through many Cities, the light creeps not on by little and little,
but in an instant spreads it self over all things.

CHAP. IX.
HOw can the water be intended except it be by the air? Doubtest thou but that
that ouerflow of water that rises and increases, The efficacy of this
agitation, and how the air is mixed amidst the earth and waters.
from the foundation of the lowest sands and channel, and mounteth to the very
top of the Amphitheater, is without the intention of water? Truly there is no
Crane or any other engine that may more mount or drive the water then the
spirit. She applies her self unto it, she is raised, and indeuoureth many
things contrary to her nature, and being created to fleet, ascends upward
when the air possesses or impelleth her. Those Barks that are ouer-laden,
show they not that it is not the water but the wind that keeps them from
sinking? For the water would give place, neither could it sustain any
burdens, except she her self were sustained. A Trencher being cast out from a
higher place into a Fish-poole descends not, but leapeth back; how, I pray
you, except it were by the benefit of spirit? How does the voice penetrate
thick walls, but for this cause, because there is air in solid and massiue
things, which both receives and sends back the sound that came from without,
not only intending by the spirit those things that are open, but those things
likewise which are hidden, and included? which he may easily do, because he is
no ways divided, but by those very means whereby he seems separated, he
gathers up himself into himself. Plant betwixt him and us thick walls, and
mighty and high mountains, this hinders him from coming to us, but not
unto himself, for that is only intercluded whereby we may follow him. He
himself passes through that which is divided, and not only spreads himself
not only through the midst, but begirteth it on every side.

CHAP. X.
Of ^he situation and diverse quarter^ of the air.
THe air passes and spreads it self from the aether^all and cle^re region,
as far as the earth, more swift, more subtle, and higher then the earth and
waters, yet more thick and wa^ghty then that region, being of himself cold
and obscure; hi^ light and hea^e are borrowed from another place, yet in every
place he is not like himself, for he is changed by his neighbors. The higher
part thereof is driest, hottest, and for this cause also the most thinnest, by
reason of the vicinitie of eternal fires, and those so many motions of
s^arres, and the continual revolution of the heavens. That lower part, which
is nearest unto the earth is thick and obscure, by reason that it intertayneth
the exhalations of the earth. The middle part is more temperate if thou compare
it with the higher, and the lower, as much as concerns dryness and tenuity,
but colder then either part; for the higher parts thereof feel the heat of
the neighboring stars: the inferior likewise are warmed, first by the
exhalations of the earth, which bring with them very much heat; again by
reuerberation of the beams of the Sun, which redoubling their heat, as
far as they may reflect, do warm him gently: again, by the warm vapor of
living creatures, herbs and plants; for none of all these can live without
heat. Add hereunto now, not only those fires that are made by hand, and are
certain, but such a^ are covered by the earth, whereof some have broken forth
innumerable, are always burning in obscure and secret places. We may also well
say, that being the cause of fertility in so many places they have some heat,
for cold is barren, and heat is fit for generation. So then the middle Region
of the air being far dis^ant from the higher and lower, remains cold, because
the nature of the air is such.

CHAP. XI.
Why the air is moveable and inconstant.
BEcause whereas it is thus divided, in the lower part thereof it is for the most
part variable, inconstant, and mutable. About the earth it does very much, it
suffers very much, it agitateth and is agitated, yet all of it is not
affected in the same sort, but diversely in diverse places, and in his parts as
both unquiet and troubled. But the causes of this his inconstancy and change,
are in some sort ministered by the earth (whose position^ being diversely
changed, are of great moment in respect of the temperature of the air) in some
sort by the course of the Planets; amongst which thou may impute the most to
the Sun. The year follows him^ according to his motions, the Winters and
Summers are changed. The Moon has the next power. The rest of the stars
likewise no less affect the earth then that air which has incon^^ancy upon
the earth, and by their contrary and crook^d risings and settings now move
cold, now showers, and are the causes of other injuries of the earth. Having
to speak of thunder, lightning, and fulgurations, it concerned me to make this
Preface; for since such imp^essions are caused in the air, it wa^ necessary
for me to discover the nature thereof, to the end it might more easily appear,
what it might either do or suffer.

CHAP. XII.
THere are three things therefore that happen, Of ^hree ordina^ie meteors in

flashing, lightning, and thunder, which are made together, and are not so
soon^ heard the one as the other. Flashing show the fire that lightning
sends: the one is, if I may so speak it, as it were a threatening and a
thunder without noise. The other is the effect and stroke of the threat.
Diverse opinions as ^^^ching the nature of them.
There are some of these wherein all men consent, some wh^rein men's opinions
are different. They accord in this, that all these are made either in the
clouds or of the clouds. They likewise confess that they are of fire, or of a
hot and dry exhalation. Let us now descend to those things that are in
controversy. Some think that fire is in the clouds, some hold that it is made
for a time, and that it begins not to be, except then when it appeareth^
Those that are of this opinion, are not agreed as touching this, from whence
this fire proceeds. For some gather it from the light: other some say that
the beams of the Sun, by force of their reuerberation and frequent
reflection, enkindle the fire. Anaxagoras maintains that it distilleth from
the etheriall region, and that from this so great heat of the heavens many do
fall, which were long time kept and enclosed in the clouds. Aris^otle thinks
that this fire is not gathered long time before, but that it shoots out at
that very instant that it is formed: whose opinion is thus, Two parts of the
world, earth and water, The sum of Aristotle's opinion. Lib. de co^lo. cap. 3.
lie below, and every one of these contributeth to himself something. The
earthly vapor is dry and resembles smoke, whence arise the winds, the
thunders, and lightnings. That of the waters is moist, and converteth it self
into raines and snowes. But when this dry exhalation of the earth that
produces the winds, being thick, comes to join it self, that are
vehemently closed and locked one within another, it breaks it self. And in
this conflict the stroke yields a noise, such as we hear in our ouens, when
the flame cracketh, if the fire be made of green wood. And as the wind having
some moisture intermixed with him, when as it is assembled and shut in one,
bursteth out into a flame. In the same manner, that spirit which, as I said a
little before, was expressed by the collision of clouds, and being impacted
with others, neither can be broken nor press forth in silence. And different
the crack is, by reason of the different dashing together of the clouds,
whereof some yield a greater sound, some a lesser. But that force of the
expressed spirit is fire, which has the name of flashing or fulguration
enkindled easily, without any force and various; yet see we the fulguration
before we hear the sound. Because the sense of the eye is more swifter and
exceeds the ear by far.

CHAP. XIII.
But that their opinion is false: Whether there be fire res^rued in the cl^uds,
or whether it falls from on ^igh.
that contain the fire in clouds, may be gathered by diverse reasons. If it
falls from the heavens, why falls it not daily, whereas so much thereof
burns continually there? Again, they have yielded no reason why the fire
which naturally mounteth upward, should flow downwards. For the condition of
our fire is otherwise, whose sparkles which have some weight do fall. So then
the fire descends not, but is precipitated and drawn downwards. No such
matter befalls the elementarie fire, which is most pure, and wherein there is
nothing that may be depressed, or if any part thereof should fall, the whole is
in danger, because that that which is comprehensible may wholly perish.
Moreover, if that whose leuitie daily hinders him from falling, hold any
thing that is weighty secretly hidden in himself, how can he sub^ist in a
place, whence of necessity he ought to fall? What then? Are not some fires
wont to be carried into the inferior parts, as these very lightnings the
which are now in question? For they go not, but they are carried by Fate. There
is some power that depresseth them, which is not in the etherial region. For
nothing in this region is compelled by force, nothing is broken, nothing
falls out extraordinarily. All is governed, there is a repured fire that
enuironeth the world, lodged in the highest extremities of this round machine,
the which does all that fittingly, which is requisite for the entertainment of
himself: it cannot move from thence, neither be abased by any other foreign
accident, because in the etheriall region there is no place for any incertaine
body. For those things that are certain and governed strive not.

CHAP. XIIII.
If the air draw fire from the etheriall region, or if it be enflamed.
YOu say (I tell you) when as you yield a reason why certain stars flee from
one place unto another, that some parts of the air may draw unto themselves
the fire that falls from the etheriall region, and that by it they are
enflamed above. But there is a great difference in this, whether we say that
fire falls from the etheriall region (which Nature permits not) or that by
reason of the fiery force it enkindleth those things that are beneath, or that
it is enkindled here. For the fire falls not from thence (for that cannot
be) but is bred here. We see amongst our selves, that when as fire scatters
it self abroad, that some Islands that have been long times hot, conceive
flame, and take fire of themselves. It is therefore likely to be true, that in
the higher region of the air, the which has this property to draw fire unto
it self: that fire is enkindled sometimes by the heat of the etheriall
region, which covers and embraces it on every side. For it must needs be,
that both the lower part of the etheriall region has somewhat in it that
resembles the air, and that the highest air be not unlike to the lower part
of the etheriall region, because that one thing cannot readily pass or join
it self with that which is directly contrary thereunto. For these by their
neighborhood by little and little intermixe their force in such sort, that
thou may doubt whether of them both it is.

CHAP. XV.
The opinions of the Stoics, as touching the inflammations of the air, and
the agitatio^ of it self
SOme of our Stoics think that the air (when as it is easily changed into
fire and water) draws not from other parts new causes of inflammations, but
that in agitating himself, he enkindleth himself, and that then when he
scatters the thick and compact concauitie of the clouds, that necessarily in
the entershocke of those so vast bodies, there should be formed a great noise.
But this conflict of clouds (which hardly give place the one unto the other) is
of no small force to enkindle a flame, even as in some sort the hand assisteth
the Iron to cut, although that cutting be a thing proper unto Iron.

CHAP. XVI.
WHat difference then is there between fulguration and lightning? The
difference between fulguration and lightning.
I will tell thee: Fulguration is a fire that is spread at large: Lightning is
a fire that is gathered and darted with violence, we are wont in joining both
our hands together to take up water, and afterward in shutting to force it
out, as it were, out of a pipe. Suppose such like things to be done there. The
straightness of those clouds that are compressed and shut together yield forth
the wind that is shut in them, and by this means are they inflamed, and then
vomit out fire as it were the stroke of some engine of war. For we see
Arbelestres and Scorpions push forth their arrows with some noise.

CHAP. XVII.
SOme think that the spirit passing through cold and moist makes a noise. H^w
thunders are cau^^d after Anaximenes opinion.
For neither is hot iron extinguished without some sound. But even as if a
burning red hot piece thereof be put into water, it is not extinguished without
much hissing: So as Anaximenes says, when as the wind encountreth with the
clouds he causes thunders; and whilst it strives and wandreth through the
resisting and open clouds, in his very flight he enkindleth fire.

CHAP. XVIII.
ANAXIMANDER referred all things to wind. The opinion of Anaximander hereupon.
Thunders, says he, are the noise of a cloud that is strooken: Why are they
unequal? Because the shock it self is unequal. Whence comes it that it
thundereth in fair weather? Because at that time also the wind breaks
through the thick and dry air. But why sometimes does it not lighten and
thunder? because the wind that was ouer-feeble to make fire, And as tuching,
thundering and lightning.
was strong enough to make a noise: What then is fulguration? It is an
agitation of the air, that separating it self and falling out of the clouds
discovers a fire that is feeble and retained. What is lightning? It is the
course and out-breaking of a wind more violent and thick.

CHAP. XIX.
THe opinion of Anaximander is, Anaximanders opinion.
that these impressions are made by some influence of the AEtherial Region into
these of the air. So fire impacted in cold clouds makes a noise. But when it
deuideth them, fulguration follows, and the lesser force of fires, causes
fulguration, the greater, lightning.

CHAP. XX.
The examination of Diogenes Apolloniates his opinion.
DIOGENES APOLLONIATES says, that some thunders proceed from fire, some are
caused by wind. The fire produces those which he foregoeth and foretells:
the wind those that yield a clap without lightning. I confess that the one is
caused and is without the other sometimes: notwithstanding in such sort, that
their power is not separated, but that the one may be produced by the other.
For who would deny that the violent wind in stirring up a vehement noise,
could not likewise make a fire? And who likewise will not confess this, that
the fire may sometimes break the clouds, and yet not enforce his passage, if
after he has trauersed some, he is stayed and extinct by a more greater
assembly of other clouds. It follows then that the fire conuerteth it self
into wind, and that it loses his light and clearenesse when it burns and
enflameth that upon the earth which she has followed: add hereunto now, that
it must needs be, that the violence of lightning pusheth forth the wind, and
sends it before him, and draws it likewise after him when he cleaves the
air by so weighty a stroke^ And therefore it is that all things before they
feel the stroke of the thunder, tremble being shaken by the assault of the
wind which the fire drives before him.

CHAP. XXI.
Senecaes opinion, as touching lightning and thunder,
DIsmissing our Masters, for the present, let us begin to speak of our
selves, and from those things that are confessed, let us pass over to those
things that are doubtful: but what is that which is confessed? That lightning
is a fire, and fulguration likewise, which is naught else but a flame, and
should be lightning if it had more force. That it is fire, the heat thereof
testifies, and the effect makes proo^e enough: for lightning o^times is the
cause of mighty fires: woods and parts of Ci^ies are burned up by it; yea those
that are not stricken, yet are they seen to be blasted, and some are colored
as it were with soote. Furthermore, all things that are stricken with
lightning, smell of sulphur. It follows therefore that lightning and
fulguration is fire, and that the one is intermixed with the other, in such
^ort, as fulguration that is not carried as far as the earth, and again,
lightning is a fulguration that is carried as far as the earth. It is not a
desire I have to speak much that lengthneth this discourse; but to the end I
may prove that these things are of the same semblance, mark and nature.
Lightning is somewhat more then fulguration; Let us turn this, Fulguration, is
almost as much as lightning.

CHAP. XXII.
A comparison taken from material fire, and that which is terrestrial, that
serves to express how lightnings and tempests grow.
IT being manifest that both of them are fires, let us examine how fire is made
amongst us: for it is made in the same sort, as it is above us, and that in two
so^ts; the one is when it is enforced out of a flint stone; the other is, if it
be found out by attrition, as when as two woods are long times rubbed the one
against the other: every matter will not yield thee fire, but only that which
is proper to produce it, a^ the leaves of Laurel, ^u^e, and which the
shepherds (perfectly exercised therein) well know. It may therefore be that in
the same sort the clouds are stricken, (...) beaten one against an other, and
thereby yield fire^ Let us consider with wh^^ force storms rush in upon us,
with what violence whirlewi^des ^^e tur^ed, wha^soeue^ this storm mee^eth
withal, is scattered, spread and ravished, and cast far from the place where
it was^ what wonder is it therefore if so great a force drive forth the fire,
either from an other thing or from himself? for thou see what heat those
bodies may feel that are blasted, burned and ^laine by their passing: by them
yet ought we not to esteem that these impressions have as much heat as there
is in the stars, whose power is both ma^u^ilous and confessed.

CHAP. XXIII.
But happily those clouds also that are enforced and driven against other
clouds by an agitation of a murmuring wind, If lightning and thunder arise by
means of the intershocke of clouds.
and that is not ouerstrong, will engender a fire that will shine without
faling; for there nee^eth a less fire in fulguration then in lightning. By
those things that are ab^uesaid, we have gathered to what heat they ^ttaine
which are rubbed one against ^n other. Since then the ^yre which of his nature
is easily changed into fire, by the violence of his forces being converted into
fire is broken. It is both credible and likely that the fire which is frail,
and will suddenly perish, issues from a matter that is not solid, wherein it
may continue long time. It passes therefore and staieth no longer then his way
endures, for it is pu^hed forth without any matter to maintain and feed it
self.

CHAP. XXIIII.
HOw comes it then to pass (say thou) that where thou say, Why the
lightning falls downewards^ when as it is the property of it to mount upwards.
that this is the nature of fire to mount vpwardes, yet that the lightning
falls downewardes; what is that false which thou have spoken of fire? for he
as well mounteth upwards as he falls downwards: both of these may be true; for
fire by nature mounteth like a Pyramid, and if nothing hinders it, it
ascends as water by nature is carried downwards; but if some force be added
thereunto to impell it to the contrary, yet returns she to the place from
whence she fell by means of the shower; but the lightning falls by the same
necessity whereby it is driven out. In these fires that falls, which does
amongst trees, whose tops if they be tender, may be so drawn down that
they may touch the earth, but when thou shall let them go, they will return
unto their own place. Thou ar^ not therefore to respect the habit of every
thing as it is enforced. If thou will permit fire to go whether it will, it
will mount to heaven, that is, to the place where every light thing should be:
but when he meets with any thing that may repulse him, or alter his ascent,
this i^ not natural unto him, but servitude.

CHAP. XXV.
How fire may issue from water, that is to say, from the clouds.
YOu mainetaine (say thou) that clouds encountering vehemently one with an
other engender fire, but if they be moist and wet, how then can they engender
fire, which in all likelyhoods is unfit to have his beginning from a cloud,
as from water.

CHAP. XXVI.
An answer to this question.
THat fire that is bred, is not water at the first in the clouds, but thick
air, prepared to turn into water, and yet not changed into the same, but now
ready and inclined to be changed. Thou art not to think that it is gathered
then, but only powered out. It is made and falls at once: besides, if I
should grant, that a cloud is moist, and full of entertained waters, yet is
there nothing that hinders, but that fire may be drawn out of moisture, nay,
which thou will more wonder at out of humor it self. Some have denied that any
thing may be changed into fire, before it were turned into water. A cloud
therefore notwithstanding, the water that it contains, in some part may
render fire, as oftentimes one part of the wood burns, the other sweateth.
Neither do I say that these are not contrary amongst themselves, and that the
one destroys not the other, but where the fire is more forcible then the
water is, the water he obtains the mastery. Again, whereas the abundance of
humor exceeds, then is fire without any effect. And therefore green wood
burns not. It imports therefore how much water there is. For a little
resists not, neither hinders the fire. Why not? In the memory of our
ancestors, as Possidonius testifies, A no^able example.
when as in the AEgean sea there appeared an Island the sea fomed by day, and
from the depth thereof there arose a smoke. Afterward there issued a fire not
continual, but shining and sparkling at certain times, after the manner of
lightnings, as often as the heat that was beneath overcame the weight that was
above. After this, stones turned out of their places, and rocks partly whole
which the wind had driven forth before they were wholly burned, partly eaten
and turned into the lightness of a Pumnice stone. At last there appeared the
top of a mountain, black and almost burned: afterward there was some what
added to the height thereof, and that rock grew to the bigness of an Island.
The same happened again in our memory, when Valerius Asiaticus was Consul.
Why have I related these things? to the end it might appear, that neither the
fire is extinguished when the sea ouerfloweth it, nor the force thereof is
prohibited to issue by the weight of mighty waves. Asclepiodotus, the scholar
of Possidonius, reported that the Island was of two hundred miles, where through
the fire appeared where the waters were broken. And if the immeasurable force
of waters ascending from the depth, could not restrain the force of the
^lames: how much less can it extinguish fire in the air, where the humor is
thin, and but like a dew? So that this reason has no difficulty in it, that
may hinder the causes of these fires, which we see never sparkle, except at
such time as there is an inclination to rain, for in fair weather commonly we
see no lightnings. A fair and clear day fears none of these, neither the
night also, except it be obscured by dark clouds. What then? Does it not
lighten sometimes when as the stars are clear, and the night is calm? Yet
art thou to know that clouds are there whence the brightness appears,
although the mountains hide them from our sight. Add hereunto (which may be)
that the moist and low clouds yield fire, by beating one against another,
which mounting into the higher parts, are seen in the cleerest and purest part
of heaven, although they are bred in a black and obscure cloud.

CHAP. XXVII.
SOme have so distinguished Thunders, Of the diversity of thunders.
that they have said that there is one kind of them that make a grievous
murmr, such as is wont to forerun an earthquake, when as the winds that are
enclosed under the earth do roar and make a noise. I will tell you how these
men suppose that this may be done. When as the clouds have locked the wind
within themselves, the air that is tossed in the hollow parts thereof, yields
a sound like unto roaring, hoarse, unequal, and continuate; and therefore also
where the Region of the air is moist, it shuts up the Thunder from issuing
forth; and therefore these kind of thunders are the fore-tokeners of a shower
that is at hand. There is another sort that a man may rather call crackes then
Thunder, such as which we are wont to hear when as a bladder is broken over a
man's head. Such thunders break forth when as a cloud that is gathered
together is dissolved, and sends forth that wind wherewith it is distended.
This sudden and vehement noise is properly called a crack, which where it
bursteth forth, causes men to fall and sound, and some living to wax stupid
and astonished, and wholly beside themselves, whom we call strooken or
Apoplectique, whose minds that celestial sound has driven out of their
place. This crack likewise may be caused by this means, that is, when as the
air that is enclosed in a hollow cloud, and being extenuated by his motion is
scattered abroad, and afterward striving to have a more larger place, and
retained by the cloud that incloseth him, he makes a noise. What therefore?
May it not be likewise, that as in striking one hand upon another we make a
loud sound, so the clouds that are thick by beating one against another, should
make a great noise, because they are great things that concur?

CHAP. XXVIII.
We see (says he) clouds that hemme in the mountain tops, Why the clouds
thicken above the mountain tops, and yet no thunder follows.
and yet no sound is made; first of all they thunder not at every time they
encounter, but then when they are fitly composed to yield a sound: when the
back of our hands be beaten together they yield no clap, but one palm being
strooken against another, there follows a sound; yea, and it appertains
much to the matter whether the hands that are clapped one against another
hollow, or flat and extended. Furthermore, the clouds must not only go, but
be driven forward by a great and tempestuous force. The mountain likewise does
not cut the cloud, but directs it, and scatters that which first comes to
meet with it. Neither does a bladder likewise, howsoever it let out the wind,
always crack: if it be cut in two, it issues forth without any sense of the
care: if you will have it sound it must be broken and not cut. The same say I
of the clouds, except they shocke together with great violence they cannot
make a noise. Add hereunto now that the clouds which are gathered together
upon a mountain break not, but are spread abroad into some parts of the
mountain, as on the boughs of trees, on bushes, sharp stones, and eminent
rocks. Behold how they are dissolved, and if they have any breath in them they
let it out in diverse sorts, which except it break forth all at once, makes no
noise, whereupon note that the wind that whistleth above a tree thundreth not,
but sings. To make thunder there needs a great clap that may at one time
disperse the whole globe of wind.

CHAP. XXIX.
Moreover, the air is apt of it self to entertain voices: why not, when as a
voice is naught else but a repercussion of the air? How effectual the air is
in Thunders, and how.
The clouds therefore ought to be severed hollow, and extended. For thou see
that empty vessels send more then those that are full, and those strings that
are wound up more then they that are let slip; so Drums and Cymballs yield a
sound, because such instruments repel the air that resists them outwardly,
and could not sound in the air, except they were hollow.

CHAP. XXX.
Asclepiodotus opinion con^irmed by two rare examples.
THere are some of the opinion, amongst whom Asclepiodotus is one, that lightning
and thundering may break forth, by reason of the encountrie of some bodies.
AEtna in times past abounded with much fire, poured forth a mighty multitude of
burning sand. The day was covered with dust, and sudden night terrified the
people. At that time it is reported that there was much thunder and lightning,
which were caused by the concourse of dry bodies, and not of clouds; for it is
very likely, that in so great an inflammation of the air there were none.
Cambyses in times past sent an Army to the Temple of Ammon, which the sand
being scattered by the Southern wind, covered them like flakes of snow, and
at length overwhelmed them. And then also it is very likely that there were
thunders and lightnings, by the attrition of sands rubbing one against another.
This opinion is not repugnant to our purpose; for we have said that the earth
breaths forth bodies of both natures, and that through all the Regions of the
air there wandereth some dryness and humiditie: if therefore any such thing
happen, it makes a cloud more solid and thick, then if it had been covered
by a simple wind; and this cloud may be broken, and yield forth a sound. As
touching the above named accidents, whether it be that the air has been
filled by such streaming fires, or whether it be by the winds ouerturning the
sands, it must needs be that a cloud must be first formed, whence afterward
there may issue thunder. But dry things engender clouds as well as moist, and
as we have said a cloud is but the thickness of gross and assembled air.

CHAP. XXXI.
IF thou will observe the same, Of the marueilou^ effects of lightnings.
thou shall find that the effects of Thunder are maruailous; neither is it to
be doubted but that there is some extraordinary and divine power intermixed
with it. Silver melts in purses, and yet are they neither rent nor spoiled.
The sword is moulten and scabberd untouched. The Iron runs down from the
Iauelin top, and yet the steel vnfeared. The wine thickneth and remains
three days as if it were ice, when the Tun is broken. This likewise may
thou put amongst those things that are worthy note; That men and other
creatures that are stricken with lightning, have their heads turned toward that
place from whence it parts, and that all the tops of those trees that are
blasted bend toward the lightning. Furthermore, Serpents and all other
venomous beasts loose all their venom if they be touched with lightning.
Whence, says he, know you this? In envenomed bodies no worm breeds; but
those bodies that are strooken with lightning are filled with worms within a
few days.

CHAP. XXXII.
Moreover I say that lightnings presage things that are to come, Lightnings are
foretokeners of that which is to come.
not ministering only a sign of one or two things, but oftentimes they
foretell the whole order of succeeding Fates, yea, and that by evident decrees,
and far more manifest then if they were written. But this is the difference
betwixt us and the Tuscans, who exactly understand this divination by
lightning. We hold opinion, that because the clouds entershock and scatter one
another, therefore the lightning bursteth forth. They think that the clouds are
rudely driven the one against the other, to this end, that lightning should
issue, and be darted on the earth. For whereas they refer all things unto
God, they are of this opinion that they signify not because they are made, but
that they are made, to the end they should signify; yet are they ingendered by
one and the same reason, be it that either they ought to signify by a
deliberate purpose, or by a consequence: how then signify they except they be
sent from God? How? In such sort as birds who take not their flight to meet us,
yet in flying either on the right or on the left hand they have presaged
somewhat. And these, say thou, God moves. Thou make him too idle, and a
minister of small matters, if in some men he dispose their dreams, in beasts
their entrails, yet are these things ordered by divine assistance. But the
feathers of birds are not governed by God, neither forms he the entrails of
beasts under the axe. The order of the destinies is expressed unto us by other
more certain means, who every where publishes signs of that which shall
come to pass long before they happen, whereof some are familiar unto us,
Whether every thing that is s^ene and understood ^ath a signification.
the rest are unknown. All whatsoever is done is a sign of something that is
to come. Those things that are casual, and incertaine without reason, admit
not divination. The thing that has order has prediction also. Why therefore
is this honor given unto the Eagle, that she should presage the matters of
greatest importance, or to the Crow, or to a few other birds, and that the
chattering of all others has neither signification or presage? Because there
are many things that are not as yet reduced into Art, and other things which a
man cannot reduce, because they are too far estranged from our acquaintance.
But there is no living creature that foretells not somewhat, either by his
motion or encountrie. All things are not observed, but some things are noted.
Divination serves him that will observe the same. It therefore appertains
unto him that has addicted his mind thereunto. Those things which a man
respects not, may notwithstanding contain some certitude. The Chaldeans in
their observations respected nothing else but the influence of five Planets.
What think thou? Iudgest thou that so many thousand stars shine to no
purpose? And what is that which deceives these Calculators of Natiuities, but
they subject themselves I know not how to some small number of stars, whereas
all they that shine over our heads, have some influence and power over us? It
may be that the more nearer Planets do dart their beams more effectually upon
us, and that they which have a more swifter motion touch us in one sort, and
other living creatures in another. But the fixed stars, and those that for
their swift course have an answerable motion to that of the first mouer, and
seem not to stir, are yet without force and effect in our respects. To
speak of these things orderly, we must regard both the one and the other, and
know that which is proper both to the one and to the other. But there is no
less difficulty to know that which they can, as to doubt whether they have
any power or no.

CHAP. XXXIII.
The knowledge of lightnings has relation to three considerations.
LEt us now return unto lightnings, the power wher^of is diuid^d into three
considerations, namely, into their signification, their interpretation, and
their remedy: the first part respects form, the second divination, the
third expiation. For we must appease the gods, beseeching them to give us
goods, to auert all evils, to maintain their promises, and to remit their
threatenings.

CHAP. XXXIIII.
What power the Tus^ans attribute to lightnin^s in respect of ^iuination.
THe Tuscans think that lightnings have a sovereign power; for whatsoever
other things do portend, are taken away by the intercourse of lightning.
Whatsoever lightning presageth is fixed; neither is it changed by the
signification of any other presage. A flash of lightning that portendeth some
good, abolisheth all the sinister predictions of the entrails of beasts, and
whatsoever the flight of birds shall threaten. All that which lightning
denounces cannot be crossed by the presages of the entrails of beasts or by
birds: wherein me thinks they are much deceived. Why? Because there is nothing
truer then truth. If birds have foretold that which ought to come to pass,
this augurie cannot be disanulled by lightning: If it may be; the birds have
foretold nothing that shall come to pass. I do not now make a comparison
betwixt the bird and lightning, but of two true presages. If both of them
foretell that which is to come to pass, they are alike. If therefore the
lightning that comes after abolisheth the judgment of the entrails, and of
the augures, the entrails were badly looked into, and the motion and cry of
birds worse observed: for it imports nothing to know whethe^ of these two
are more strong and puissant in their nature, or whether of both has proposed
more signs of truth, for the sign in this respect is equal, if thou say that
the force of the flame is greater then that of the smoke, thou lie not; but
to devour the fire, the flame and smoke are of the same value. Therefore if
they say thus, that as often as the entrails of beasts shall presage one
thing, and the lightning an other, the authority of the lightning shall be
more great, happily I shall be of their opinion: But if they mainetaine that a
flash of lightning disanulleth the truth which those other signs have
foretold, and that we ought not to build on any thing but on this flash of
lightning: I say they abuse themselves; and the reason is, because it imports
not how many passages there be; It is but one thing that shall come to pass,
which if it has been well comprised in the first prediction and divination,
the second will be no prejudice unto it. All comes to one: I therefore say,
that it skilleth not, if one thing by means whereof we would inform our
selves be the same, or an other thing, because that whereof we enquire is one
and the same.

CHAP. XXXV.
DEstiny cannot be changed by lightning; Why not? because that lightning is a
part of Destiny: Whereto then serve so many expiations and ceremonies; to what
purpose is all this, if the Destinies be immutable? Permit me to follow the
austere opinion of those who entreat of these things, and mainetaine that
Destinies are no other thing but the solace of a pensive thought. The Destinies
mainetaine their right precisely, there is neither prayer that moves them, nor
misery or favor that alters them. They observe their irreuocable course,
they pass onward in an assured and unaltered order. Even as the water of
violent streams neither turns back, nor stays, but every wave is forcibly
driven one by an other that beats at his back: so the order of Destiny is
governed by an eternal succession, the decree whereof is, not to change that
which has been ordained and destinated.

CHAP. XXXVI.
But what meanest thou by this word Destiny, What Destiny is according to th^^
Stoickes.
I think it to be an invincible and immutable necessity of all things and
actions: if thou think that this necessity may be pacified by sacrifices or
by oblations of the head of a white Lamb, thou know no^ what divine things
are: you likewise say that the resolution of a wise man cannot be changed: how
much less that of gods, considering that a wiseman only discovers for the
present that which is good, but all things are present to the divine Essence^
yet notwithstanding in this place will I plead their cause, who are of the
opinion that a man may remedy lightnings, and affirm that expiations are
available sometimes to remove dangers, and sometimes to lessen them, or at
leastwise to differ them.

CHAP. XXXVII.
To what intent serve th^se means, if the doctrine of destiny ^e received.
I Will prosecute hereafter that which remains to be entreated upon as
concerning this matter; mean while we all of us are agreede in this point,
that we suppose that vows are profitable, (the force and power of the Fa^e^
always reserved:) for some things are in such sort left in suspense by the
immortal gods, that they turn unto good, if vows and prayers be made unto
the immortal gods, This therefore repugneth not against destiny, but is
enclosed in the same. Thou will say unto me, this thing shall happen, o^ shall
not happen; if it must come to pass, if you vow and make your request, yet
shall it take effect; if it shall not come to pass, vow and pray as much as
you list, it shall not fall out, the consequence of this argument is false,
because you have forgot the exception that I have put between both, that is to
say: This shall happen provided that a man make vows and prayers. It must
necessarily follow that to vow, or not to vow are comprehended within Destiny.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
THou presupposest that I confess my self vanquished, and that I auow that
this is comprehended also in Destiny, that a man should make vows: The means
are enclosed in destiny, and are the means to attain unto the end that Destiny
ordains.
so thus they shall be made; It is destinated that such a one shall be an
eloquent man, but under this condition, it is destinated that he be
instructed in good letters: the same Destiny therefore that addicteth him to
study, will cause that he shall become wise. An other man shall be rich, but
so as he traffic upon the seas: but in that order of fate which promises him
so great a patrimony, this destiny likewise is enclosed, that he shall set
sail to the wind, and that by reason thereof without any fear or exception,
he shall embarque and sail. The same (say I) of expiations. He shall escape
dangers, if he has appeased the fore-threatned wrath of the gods by
sacrifice. And this likewise is in Destiny, that he must expiate, and therefore
he shall do it. These things have been oftentimes opposed against us, to
approve that nothing has been left in our will, but that all power has been
committed to Destiny. When as this matter shall be handled, I will tell you
how there remains somewhat in man's will, although the Destiny continues. But
now have I explicated, that which was in question; how if the order of Fate be
certain, the expiations and remedies of prodigies prevent the dangers, because
these remedies impugn not Destinies, but are comprehended in the law of the
same. What then say thou, does the Southsayer profit me? for although he
co^nsell me nothing, yet must I necessarily make this expiation. It suffices,
because he is a Minister of Destiny: so when as health seems to proceed from
Fate, yet ought we to thank the Physician, because the benefit of Fate, came
unto us by his hands.

CHAP. XXXIX.
CAECINNA says, Diverse sorts of lightnings in regard of their significations,
according to the Tuscans and Stoiques.
that there are three sorts of lightning, the one of counsel, the other of
authority, the third of estate. The first precedeth the act, and comes after
the thought; that is, when the flash of lightning counsels or discovers
that which the thought deuiseth: The second, when as a lightning comes after
a thing is executed, to signify that either good or evil fortune shall
succeed, The third, when as lightning happens, when men are at rest, without
thinking or doing any thing. This sort of lightning menasseth, or promises, or
admonishes, by reason whereof Caecinna names it momentary: but I know not why
it should not be the same with that of counsell^ for he that admonishes
gives counsel, yet has it some distinction, and therefore is it separated
from that of counsel, because this first persuades and disswadeth, but the
third contains but a simple advice, to fly an imminent peril; as when we
fear that our neighbors will decei^e us, or set fire on our houses, or that
our slaves conspire against us. Besides this I see an other distinction: The
first concerns him that thinks, the other, him that thinks nothing. Every
thing has his property, we counsel those that deliberate, we admonish those
that bethink not themselves.

CHAP. XL.
FIrst of all the three sorts concern not all lightnings, Diverse names of
lightnings according to their diverse effects.
but are the significations thereof. For the sorts of lightning are that the
one pierces, the other scatters, and the other burns. The lightning that
pierces is subtle and flaming, taking his flight through narrow passages, by
reason that his flame is so subtle and thin, as nothing more: That which
dissipateth is gathered together as it were into a ball, having intermixed in
it self the force of a coacted and stormy wind, by means whereof this
lightning enters and issues ordinarily by one and the same habit: his force
that is spread at large pierces not, but breaks that which it touches: that
which burns has very much terrestrial vapor in it, and is more fiery then
flaming: by means whereof he leaves great ma^ks of fire behind him, that
remain on those things it has stricken. No lightning falls without fire,
but we properly call that a fiery lightning, that leaves manifest marks of
fire behind it: but this lightning that burns or blacketh, burns in three
sorts; for either it attainteth and blasteth slightly, or it burns, or
causes the thing that is struken to fall on fire: the fire is in all this, but
there is a difference in the sort and in the means: for all that which is
burned was bla^^ed or scorched likewise; but all that which is blasted and
scorched is not always burned. It may be that the fire has given but some
light attaint; we know that there are many things that are consumed in the
fire without making any flame: for nothing can burn except it be burned. I
will add this word more. One thing may be burned, and yet not kindled, and
something kindled which is not burned.

CHAP. XLI.
The effects of those lightnings that black those things which they touch.

The Tuscans opinions as touching the falling of lightnings.


NOw pass I over to that kind of lightning that blacketh those things it
beats upon, this either discoloureth or colors. I will discover the
difference of them both. That is discolored, whose color is vitiated, not
changed: that thing is colored, whose appearance is otherwise then it was at
the first, as blew, or black, or pale: The Tuscians and Stoikes accord herein,
but they differ in this, that the Tuscans say, that Jupiter darteth his
lightnings, and they give him three different handfuls to cast. The first, say
they, admonishes and is peaceable, and is darted by the good will of Jupiter
himself. The second likewise is darted from his hand, but by the advice of
counsel, whereunto he calls twelve other gods. This kind of lightning
sometimes does seem good but not without harming those upon whom it is sent.
The third also is darted by the same Jupiter, but after he has consulted with
the gods, whom they call superiors and infolded. This spoyleth and includes,
and ouerturneth all that which it meets withal in public, and in
particular; for fire consumes whatsoever it meets with.

CHAP. XLII.
IF you observe this well, you shall perceive at the first sight that antiquity
erreth herein. The explication of the Tuscans opinions according to Senacaes
mind.
What a folly is it to believe that Jupiter darteth lightnings out of the
clouds, that sometimes catch hold of statues, pillars and trees, blasting
sheep, and other innocent beasts, burning up the altars, and yet sparing
sacrilegious persons, and as if he had not sufficient counsel in himself,
but that he must call other Gods to assist him? Likewise that these lightnings
which he of himself darteth, are presages of joy and peace; and that these
lightninges which are darted by the plurality of voices of many of the gods are
dangerous: if you ask me my opinion, I think that the Tuscans are besotted
to believe that Jupiter has been in suspense, or ill addressed to execute.
For I pray you when he has darted those fires which should fall on innocent
beasts, and leave the wicked unpunished: shall we say that he would not use
his greatest justice, or that it has not succeeded according to his mind?
what was their intention when they said this? These Wisemen pretending to
bridle in the minds of the ignorant, made them believe, that there was an
inevitable fear, to the end we should dread a divinity, that is above vs^ It
was necessary in so great intemperance and corruption of manners, that there
should be some power, against which no man should think himself able to
prevail. To the end therefore that they who addict not themselves to do well,
but for fear of strokes should be affrighted; they established a just judge
over their heads with convenient instruments in his hand to chastise them.

CHAP. XLIII.
But why is that lightning, The continuation of Senecaes opinion, whereby he
labors to excuse the opinion of the Tuscans, as touching lightning.
which Jupiter himself darteth, only peaceable, and the other pernicious?
Because a prince (which is signified by the name of Jupiter) ought of himself
to do good unto his subjects without ever harming them, except his counsel be
of a contrary opinion. They that are mounted in authority above other men,
learn here, that the lightning is not darted out of heaven upon the earth but
by counsel, let them therefore call unto themselves diverse, let them weigh their
advice, moderate their decrees, and have this thought when they have occasion
to smite any thing: Jupiter contents not himself with his own private
counsel.

CHAP. XLIIII.
IN this place neither have they been so unadvised, as to think that Jupiter
changed his lightnings. These are the tricks of Poetical liberty. There is
another lightning far more slight,
Forged by the CICLOPS hands, wherein less fright,
Less flame or wrath is put when they are framed,
And this the gods their second lightnings named.
Such an error entered not into the heads of so great learned men, as to think
that Jupiter had sometimes more slighter and trifling lightnings. But they
intended this to teach Princes that have the charge to dart their lightnings
against men's sins, that all crimes deserve not the same punishment, but that
some are to be punished with extreme rigor, others suppressed by more
sufferable chastisements, others by censures and aduertisements.

CHAP. XLV.
NEither believed they this likewise, Why the Ancients attributed to Jupiter
certain lightnings of different effects, their opinion likewise as touching
Jupiter, setting down diverse names according to his different effects
that Jupiter is such a one, as we see in the Capitol, and in other Temples,
darting lightnings out of his hand, but they imagine such a Jupiter as the
Stoickes do, who is the keeper and protector of the world, a spirit and mind,
which is the work-master and Lord of this world, to whom all names are
agreeable. Will thou call him Destiny? Thou shall not err. On him depend all
things, and all the Causes of causes are of him. Will thou name him providence?
Thou say well. For his wisdom it is that provides for this world, to the
end it might be firm and immutable for ever; and that he should continue his
course and his effects. Will thou call him Nature? Thou shall not sin; for
all things have had their beginning by him, and we live by his spirit. Will thou call him the World? Thou shall not be deceived, because he is all that
which thou see, wholly infused into his parts, and sustaining himself by his
virtue. The Hetruricus have been of the same opinion, and therefore said they
that Jupiter darted his lightnings, by reason that nothing is done without him.

CHAP. XLVI.
Whether Jupiter darteth his lightnings him self.
WHy does Jupiter pass by those things that are to be stricken, or strike those
which he should not strike? Thou drawest me into a higher discourse, to which I
will assign a better place, and a fitter time. In the mean while I say this,
that Jupiter sends not down lightning: but that all things are so disposed,
that even those things which are not done by him, yet are not done without
reason, which is only his: Their force is his permission. For although now
Jupiter does them not, yet is he the cause that they were done. He assisteth
not all things one after another, but he has given all things their mark,
their efficacy, and their cause.

CHAP. XLVII.
The Tuscans division as touching lightnings, confuted.
NEither allow I their division, for they say that al lightnings are perpetual
or finite, or prolonged. The perpetual are those whose signification
appertains to the whole life, comprehending not only one thing, but a
succession of all that should happen from the beginning of life until the end.
Such are the lightnings which are made at such time as a man enters into the
possession of his patrimony, or into some new condition of life; or when as a
City changes her government. The finite have a certain day and term
assigned. The prolonged are those whose threats may be deferred, but not
wholly prevented or extinguished.

CHAP. XLVIII.
The reason why this division is refuted.
WHat the cause is (I will tell you) why I consent not in this division. For
that lightning which we call perpetual is finite, for it has a certain day
prefixed as well as the rest. Neither therefore are they finite, because they
signify a long time. And that which is prolonged is limited also, for by their
own confession, such a menace is certain until such time as a man has
obtained delay. For they auerre that private lightnings extend not above ten
years, and that public cannot be deferred above thirty: and by this
reckoning these likewise are finite, because there is a prefixed time, beyond
which they may not be proroged. The term then of all lightnings and their
effects is certain and determinate: for a man cannot comprehend in a certain
time a thing that is uncertain. And as touching that which we ought to
consider most nearly in lightnings, they speak both generally and confusedly,
and they will have us to distribute the effects in sort, as after them the
Philosopher Attalus and their scholar has done, which is that we should
regard where, when, to whom, and in what thing the lightning has fallen, what,
and how great it has been: if I would distribute all these things by parts,
what should I do but enter into an infinite number of distinctions.

CHAP. XLIX.
I Will now set down the names of lightnings, Diverse attributes of lightning,
as ridiculous as their profane Authors, exceeding the bonds of Natural
Philosophy.
according as Caecinna has described them, and will discover what my opinion
is in these. Some (says he) are postulatorie, whereby those sacrifices that
either are intermitted, or not rightly performed are repeated. Some monitorie,
whereby we are taught what we are to take heed of. Some pestiferous, which
portend death or banishment. Some fallacious, which under an appearance of
good, do us harm. They give an unhappy consulate to those that shall
undertake the charge, and an heritage, the purchase whereof will breed more
loss then profit. Some threatening, that offer evil but in appearance only.
Some murdering, which abolish the threats of precedent lightnings. Some
Attestata, that accord with the precedent. Some under earthly, which are done
in secret. Some overwhelmed, which beat upon those things which before time
were attainted and left. Some royal, that show their effects upon a whole
assembly of people, or upon the principal places of a free City, and whose
signification threaten some tyrannical invasions into a Commonweal. The
Lower, when the earth vomitteth flames of fire. The Hospitals, that by
sacrifices draw, or (as they speak it in a more milder term) inuit Jupiter
unto us. But if he be displeased, if then he be invited, he comes to the
great hazard of those that have invited him. The Auxiliarie which are likewise
called Summoned, but that comes for their good, that have caused it to come.

CHAP. L.
HOw far more simple was that division, which Attalus, A more moderat
distinction of the Philosopher Attalus.
a man of great note, and a Philosopher of our sort, used, who had intermixed
the discipline of the Tuscan with Grecian subtilties. Amongst lightnings, says
he, some there are that concern us, other some that signify nothing, or if
they signify any thing, we know not what it is. As touching those that
signify, some of them are joyful, some are adverse, and some neither adverse
nor joyful. Of those that are adverse and contrary, these are the kinds:
either they portend some unavoidable evils, or such as may be avoided, or such
as may be lessened or prolonged. The joyful signify either such as are
permanent, or such as have small continuance. Those that are mixed, either have
a part of good, or evil, or conuer^ the evil into good, or the good into
evil. Those are neither fatal nor joyful, which signify unto us some
action, whereat we ought neither to be terrified, nor rejoiced: as for
example, some long voyage, wherein there is neither fear, nor any thing to be
hoped for.

CHAP. LI.
Of those lightnings which have sign^fi^ation, and concern^ us.
Unto those lightnings I will return which have some signification, which
notwithstanding concerns us nothing, as if in the same year the same
lightning that fell before falls once more. There are lightnings likewise
that have no signification in our respect, as those whereof we know nothing,
witness the lightnings that fall in the spacious extent of the Ocean, or in
the deserts: for they have no signification, and if they have, it comes not
to our knowledge.

CHAP. LII.
Of the diverse ef^ects o^ lightning, according to the matter it meets with.
YEt there remains somewhat for me to declare as touching the force of
lightnings, which effect not every matter according to the same manner. She
breaks and dissipateth those things most vehemently which are hardest, and
sometime passes by those things that are yielding without any injury: She
conflicteth more rudely with stones and Iron, and those things that are
hardest, because she is constrained to make her passage through them with
violence. So then she opens the passage, sparing that which is tender and
hollow, although it seem to be more proper to take fire, because that in
finding a passage she shows her self less violent. Therefore is it, as I
have said, that a man finds silver melted in his purs^ because that fire that
is the purest and thinnest passes lightly through the pores of the leather: but
whatsoever it finds solid in building she breaks in pieces as rebellious
and resisting against her. But, as I said, it rages not after one manner, but
by the kind of evil that happens you may see what it is, and by the effects
you shall know what lightning is. Oft-times in the same matter one and the same
flash of lightning causes different effects, as in falling upon a tree it
burns that which is dry in it, pierces and breaks that which is hardest,
dissipateth the bark, cleaves the trunk, pulls up the roots, smoldereth
and partcheth the leaves. It congeal^th wine and melts Iron and brass.

CHAP. LIII.
A Marvelous thing this is, that the wine which is congealed by lightning, Of
the parti^ular ef^i^acy of light^ing in wine.
and afterward returns into his former estate, kills or makes those men
mad that drink thereof. Bethinking my self of the cause hereof, I say that
there is a mortal efficacy in this fire, whereof it is very likely that some
spirit remains in the wine which has been congelead and frozen. For this
liquid substance could not be congealed without some means. Moreover, if
lightning touches oil or any fat liquor, it stinketh ever afterward; whereby
it appears, that in this ^ire, so subtle and enforced against the order of
nature, there is so powerful an efficacy, that it not only kills that which
it touches rudely, but also that which it attainteth with the breath thereof.
Furthermore, in what place soever the lightning falls men undoubtedly smell a
sent of brimstone, which being weighty by nature, astonisheth those that
smell it often. But hereafter we will entreat of this at leisure, and will
have (it may be) the means to show how all things have been derived from
Philosophy, the mother of Arts, which has first of all sought out the causes
of things, and has observed the effects, conferring the ends with their
beginnings, what principally we ought to observe in the inspection of
lightnings.

CHAP. LIIII.
I Will now return to Possidonius opinion. Fr^^ the consid^^^tion of
lightnings, be returns to th^se of thunder.
The moister part of the earth and terrestiall things being on one side, the
drier and lighter part flies on the other. This serves for a nutriment to
lightnings; that unto raines. All hot and dry exhalations ascending and
attaining into the air, cannot keep themselves enclosed in clouds, but break
their prisons; whence follows that which we call thunder. All that likewise
which refineth it self in the air, is dried and warmed by the same means.
And this likewise, if it be enclosed, seeks nothing else, but how to escape
and break through with noise. Sometime it escapes all at once, whence
proceeds a very great thunder, sometimes by parts, and by little and little.
This spirit therefore expresses these thunders, whilst either it breaks the
cloud^, or flies by it. But this violent tumbling which the exhalation makes
in a cloud, is a most powerful force to enkindle the same.

CHAP. LV.
THunders are nothing else but a sound of the dry air, What thu^der is, and
how it is caused.
which cannot be done, but when it is either broken, or breaks. And if the
clouds, says he, be beaten one against another, that nois^ is made which is
now in question, but not universally, because there is no general conflict,
but in certain places only. Soft things yield no sound, except they be
stricken against those things that are hard. As a wave of the sea makes no
noise, except it meet with some hard thing that stays it. The fire being cast
into the water makes a noise in the quenching. Be it so: All this makes for
me, for the fire at that time makes not the noi^e, but the air that flies a
thwart, that which extinguisheth the fire: and if I should grant thee that fire
does it, and is extinguished in the cloud, I say that it grows from the
exhalation and the shock. What then (says he) may not one of these flitting
stars fall into a cloud, and be extinguished therein? Let us presuppose that
it may, and that it happens sometimes. For the present we seek for a
natural and continual cause, not for a rare and casual event. Put case that
I acknowledge all that to be tru^ which thou speak, that sometimes fires do
shine after it has thundered, resembling shooting and falling stars, yet is
not this the cause of thunder, but this happens, because it has thundered.
What is fulguration? Clidemus denies that it is a fire, maintaining this that
it is but an appearance: even as by night, after the stroke of the oar we see
some brightness. This example is not answerable, for this shining appears in
the water, that which is made in the air flasheth and issues forth.

CHAP. LVI.
The definition of thunder, and whence it is caused.
HE^ACLITVS thinks that fulguration is but an effect of fire, that begins
to enkindle it self, and a first flame as yet uncertain, that now is
extinguished, and then lighted again: these did the Ancients call Fulgetra,
that is to say, Fulgurations, but we call them thunders in the plural number,
but the Ancients called it thunder, or a sound. This have I found in Cicynna, a
man very eloquent, who had had some reputation for his eloquence, except
Ciceroes shadow had obscured him. The Ancients have used this word, making it
shorter by a syllable in the midst, which now we make long. For as we say,
Splendere, that is, to shine, we say likewise Fulgere, that is, to lighten: but
they were accustomed to pronounce the second syllable short, and to say,
Fulgere, to signify the sudden breaking out of light from the clouds.

CHAP. LVII.
Senecaes opinion in this point.
Ask thou me what mine opinion is? for until this present I have done
nothing but discover other men's opinions: I will tell it thee. Fulguration is
made, when as a sudden brightness spreads it self at large, which happens
at such time as the air by subtiliation of the clouds is converted into fire,
finding no fodder to raise it more higher. I think thou will not wonder, if
either motion extenuate the air, or extenuation endkindle it. In this sort a
bullet of lead violently shot out of a piece, mollifieth and melts it self,
and the shock of the air serves it in stead of fire. And therefore it is for
the most part that lightnings are made during the Summer time, because the
season is ordinarily hot, and fire is caused more easily by the attrition of
hot things. Fulguration and lightning are caused after the same manner, the one
shines, the other is darted. But that has a lighter force, and less
nutriment. And to let you know mine opinion in a word, lightning is but an
intended fulguration. What, as therefore a hot and smoakie vapor mounteth from
the earth into the air, and has sometimes whirled it self amongst the
clouds, it finally issues forth with violence; if it b^ feeble, then follows
fulguration. But when as fulgurations have more matter, and burn more
violently, they are converted into lightnings, and fall unto the earth.

CHAP. LVIII.
Why the lightning appears at once, and is not extended from high to low, in
the form of a colome of fire.
SOme there are that think that the lightning mounteth again, some others say
that it staieth after it has consumed that which nourishes it, and that the
stroke is enfeebled. But why does lightning appear all at once, and extends
not it self from high to low, in the form of a pillar of ^ire? Because she is
wonderful light, and of a swift motion, so that at one time she breaks
through the clouds, enflameth the air, and then when her motion cease, the
flame is extinguished. For the course of the exhalation is not continual, so
as the fire may extend it self, but when as by violence he is enkindled the
more, he takes his carier to escape. Being at liberty, and the combat
finished: for the same cause sometimes it extends it self as far as the
earth: sometimes it is dissolved, if any the least resistance do press it.
Why falls thi^ fire obliquely? By reason that it is composed of the air,
which is oblique and crooked, and because that nature draws the fire on high,
and violence forces it downward, it begins to be crooked. Sometimes nature
and force encounter, as it were, equally, in so much as the fire mounteth and
is drawn downwards. Why for the most part are the tops of mountains stricken?
Because they are opposed against the clouds, and the fire falling from the
heavens, must needs pass by them.

CHAP. LIX.
I Understand now what long since thou have desired, Of the true vs^ of this
part of natural Philosophy which entreats o^ lightnings, consisting on the
contempt of death, whereof he entreats amply, and shows that we ought as
little to ^eare lightning, as any other accidents that endanger life.

Constancy makes worldly casualtie nothing^


and what thou demandest. I had rather (say thou) not know lightnings, then
fear them. Learn therefore, of whom thou will, how they are made. For mine
own part, I take more pleasure to know how I may not fear them, then how I
may define them. I will follow thee whither thou call me. For in all things,
and in all speeches, we ought to intermix somewhat that is wholesome and
profitable. When as we ^ound into the secrets of Nature, when as we entreat of
divine things the mind must be freed from all passions, and settled likewise in
some sort. The most learned men, (and they that are continually exercised in
this study) have great need to do: not only to save our heads from those
strokes which are on every side aimed against us. But to the end we may suffer
them constantly and patiently. Invincible we may be; unassaulted we cannot be;
although that in the mean while there is some hope that we may be unshaken.
How say thou? Contemn thou death, and all those things that lead unto
death, whether they be wars, or shipwracks, or biting of wild beasts, or
weight of raines, tumbling down with a sudden fall: Can they do any more then
divide the body and soul? no diligence can prevail against these things, no
felicity tame them, no power avoid them, Fortune disposes diverse things
diversely, but death adiourneth all persons indifferently; whether the gods be
either pleased or displeased, we must die. And since there is no hope to
escape, let us gather the greater courage. Those creatures that are most
cowardly, whom Nature has framed unto flight, endeavor wit^ their weak bodies
to work forth a passage, when as none appears. There is no enemy more
dangerous then he, who hemmed in on every side, grows desperate and resolute:
for necessity makes us always more violent then valor does. He that
despaireth of his life, performs the noblest exploits, O that this Pagans
thought were our nobler Christians meditation, they would not then so proudly
^uer, look the poor, who are one with them in the grave, and like to be
greater then they in heaven.
or at leastwise such as may equal the actions of the most resolute. Think
that we have bin (for indeed so we are) betrayed and delivered unto death. This
is true (my Lucillius) we are all of us reserved to death. For how long time,
think thou, shall all this people, that thou see, endure? Nature will
adiorne and bury this in a little time: we need not to dispute of the thing,
but of the day; only we must come thither, either sooner or later. What then?
think thou not that he is more fearful then fear, more foolish then ^olly
itself, that makes long pursuits, and entreats some delay of his death?
Would thou not judge him a recreant (that being condemned to lose his head
amongst diverse others, and already within the executioners hands, that would
only entreat this favor, that he might be beheaded the last? Thus do we: we
account it a great matter to die latest. All of us are condemned, and most
justly condemned to a capital punishment. For (which is greatest comfort to
those that are to suffer the most extremities) all men's cause is one. If the
Magistrate had pronounced a sentence against us, every one should see us march
forward and submit ourselves unto the Hangman. What matter is it, wheth^r by
commandment, or of our own accord we march unto death? O how little sense
have thou, and how small consideration of thy frailty, if thou fear death
when it thundereth? Does thy life return again by thy fear? Shall thou live
if the lightning touch thee not? The sword will hit thee, the stone will strike
thee, the feuour will shake thee. Lightning is not the greatest, but the
fairest of thy dangers. But truly thou should be badly dealt withal, if that
infinite celeritie should prevent the sense of thy death, if thy death should
afterward be expiated with sacrifice. If thou also at such time as thou
yeeldest up the ghost, art a sign not of a vain, but of some great thing.
Truly it is a great injury for thee to be burned with lightning. But thou
fear when the heaven thundreth, thou quakest when the clouds break, and
expirest as often as brightness appears. What then? Think thou it to be a
matter more honest, to die for fear, then upon lightning? Lift up thy head,
then I pray thee, more boldly against the menaces of heaven, and when the world
shall be all on fire, think thou that thou have nothing to lose in so general
and famous a death. If thou think that this confusion of clouds, this
discord of tempests, this conflict in the air is prepared against thee, and
that this great collection of fires conspireth thy ruin: comfort thy self
likewise by this thought, that thy death is of some great importance. But thou
shall not have time or place to bethink thee of this, the very casualtie it
self caus^th f^are. And amongst the rest, this is one commodity thereof, that
it pr^uenteth thine expectation. For never did any man fear lightning, except
he that has escap^d it.

The End of the second Book of the Natural Questions.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS The third Book. Which entreats upon the waters.
THE PREFACE.
AS I am not ignorant, Seneca (...) this his Preface yields a noble reason
why in th^se his retired years he addicteth himself to the serious studies,
which is his care he has to instruct posterity.
most virtuous Lucillius, that in my retired years I lay the foundations of
mighty matter^, so have I resolved with my self to circuit the world, and to
discover the causes^ and secrets of the same, and a^terwards to publish them,
and to instruct other^ in them. When shall I attain so much? When shall I
gather together things so disseuered? When shall I cl^erely conceive those
things that are hidden? Old age hangs upon my back, and reproacheth me with
my lost time that was spent in vain occupations; so much the more therefore
let us press forward, and let labor recompense the losses of a life so ill
employed. Let us join night with day. Let us cut off our occupations in
worldly affairs, and let the master take no more care of them, let the mind
be wholly awakened in it self, and at leastwise in this later time s^ttle
himself in contemplation and knowledge of himself: which he shall do if he
draw himself to account, and measure every day the shortness of time, he
shall recompense by diligent use of the ^emainder of life, all that which is
lost of forme^ time. It is a great contentment to the mind, when as being
displeased and ashamed of the time that is past, he addicteth himself to the
excercises of virtue. It pleases me to cry out, and publish this verse of the
famous Poet, We lend our haughty minds more prouder wings^
And in small time contri^e most mighty things.
Thus would I say were I a child, and thus were I a young man^ for there is no
time that is not scant enough for so mighty things. But now we have retired
our selves to a matter both serious, grave, and almost infinite, and we debate
therein on the afternoones. Let us therefore do as they are wont, who set
forward on long iournies, who recompense their late rising with speedy footing.
Let us make have, and without excusing our selves by age, let us manage this
price of business, which though I know not whether I may compass, yet am I
assured that it is great; my mind increases as often as he intends and
thinks on the greatness of my attempt, and busieth not himself about the time,
but upon his deliberation. Some men have spent themselves in dis-jesting and
setting down the acts of foreign Kings, and what the people either suffered or
attempted together. How much better is it to reform our own infirmities, then
to discover other men's unto posterity? How far better is it, to celebrate the
works of the gods, then the thefts of Philip, Alexander, and some others? who
renowned for overthrowing diverse nations, were no less plagues amongst mortal
men, then inundations that drown up every plain, or fires which should
confound and burn up the greater part of men and beasts? They write how
Haniball passed the Alps, in what manner he brought the war into Italy, that
was fortified by the victories he had obtained in Spain; how after the ruin
of Carthage (his affairs and fortunes growing desperate) he obstinately
solicited Kings, offering himself to make war against the Romans, yea,
though it were without an army: how he ceased not, being strooken with age, to
seek out war in every angle of the world, so well could he be without his
country, and so little could he endure to be without an enemy. How far
better is it to enquire what is to be done, then what is done, and to teach
those that have submitted themselves to fortune, For the one teaches
prevention, the ^ther amongst good men remorse.
that she gives nothing but incertainties, and that all, whatsoever she has
fleeteth away like the wind? For she cannot stay in one place, she takes
pleasure to substitute sorrow in stead of joy, and to confound them together.
Let no man therefore be confident in prosperity, nor diffident in adversity.
The affairs of the world have their changes, why art thou proud? Thou know
not where these things that lift thee thus aloft intend to leave thee: they
shall have theirs, but not thine end; why lie thou on the ground? thou art
fallen to the lowest, it is now time for thee to stand upright: adversities are
changed to the best, desires to the worst. In thinking upon the resolution of
things, it is good to cast our eye, not only on particular houses (which a
little wind overthrows) but also on public estates. There are Kingdoms
that have raised themselves from very slight beginnings, above those that were
their commanders. The ancient Monarchies decayed when they were at their
highest: innumerable have those gouernements been that have been broken by
others. At this day as much as ever, God raises up some estates, and humbles
others: neither does he it in a milder sort, but in such manner he disperseth
them, that there remains no appearance of their re-establishment. We believe
these things to be great, because we our selves are small. Many things have
their greatness, not according to their nature, but according to our
humility: what think we to be the principal thing in humane life? It is not
to have couerd the back of the Ocean with our ships, nor to have settled our
confines on the shoares of the red sea, neither for want of ^inding out land to
have sought the unknown Isles, in forraging and spoiling the whole world: But
it is to have beheld all these things in thought, to have conquered our vices
(which is the greatest victory of all others). Innumerable are those men that
have had Cities and Nations under their government, but few there are that have
been Lords of themselves: How true this is the greatest wise men have
testified, the wisest Philosophers, the greatest Kings have confirmed to their
disgrac^.
what is the principal matter? To raise a man's mind above the threats and
promises of fortune; to think nothing worthy to be hoped for: for what is
there that is worth the wishing for? As oftentimes as thou shall give over the
contemplation of divine things, and have recourse unto humane, thou shall see
as little as they do, who forsake the brightness of a clear ^unne, and enter
into a thick shadow and darkness. What is the chiefest matter? To be able to
endure adversities with a constant mind, to suffer whatsoever it be that
happens, as if thou were willing it should happen. For thou should do no
less if thou thoughtest that all things were done by Gods ordinance. To weep,
to complain, and lament, is a kind of revolt. What is the chiefest? A mind
that is confirmed and confident against calamities, not only an adversary but
a mortal enemy of dissolution, a mind neither greedy of anger, neither
flying it, that knows how, not to expect but to make fortune, and to march
forth against both of these both dreadlesse and vnconfused; a mind that is
neither shaken by her tumult, nor blasted with her brightness. What is the
chiefest? Not to entertain evil counsels into our minds, to lift clean
hands unto heaven, to require no good that should be derived unto thee either
by one man's gift, or another man's los^e. To wish that which a man may do
without any other man's prejudice, namely for a good conscience. And as touching
those other things (which the children of this world prize so much) to respect
them (although some misfortune should bear away both house and substance) as
things that must issue by that place where they entered. What is the chiefest?
To raise the mind far above all casualties, to remember that thou art a man,
that whether thou be happy, thou must know that this will not continue long,
or unhappy, thou may know that thou art not so, except thou think thy self
so. Worthy contemplation, O had the light of grace accompanied these lights of
nature.
What is the chiefest? Above all things to have a free mind: it is not the
law of the Quirites, but the liberty of nature that gives this. But that man
is free, that has discharged himself from himself. To be subject to a man's
passions is a continual servitude, from which it is impossible to escape, a
slavery that presses with an equal weight, as well by day as by night,
without intermission and without relief. To be slave unto a man's self is the
servitude of seruitudes; which is easily dismissed if thou desist from
importuning thy self in many things, if thou ceasest to have a will to bribe
thy self, if thou set before thy eyes thy weakness and age, and say unto thy
self, Why am I mad? Why puff^ I? Why sweat I? Why change I places? Why haunt I
the courts and places of conference? I have neither need of much, nor of long
time. Moreover, it shall be good to consider the nature of things: this will
first of all cause us to retire our selves from shameful matters, and
afterward will separate the body very far from the mind, which should be
great and sublime. Furthermore those subtle discourses which we have made in
our selves, shall not make us worse in open assemblies. But there is nothing
more open then these wholesome counsels, by which we may learn to bridle our
vices and furies, which we daily believe, but give over never.

CHAP. I.
Of the original of waters, and their causes.
NOw let us enter into the consideration of waters, and examine after what
means they are made; either as Ovid says, Clear was the fountain bubling
from the sand;
Daining with silver streams the fruitful land.


Or as Virgil says, Where by nine channels with a r^aring noise,
The wrathful sea breaks through the mountain hie
And drownes the fruitful pastures that are ^ie.


Or as I find in my dearest Junior. And from Sicilian springs,
ELEVS draws his wings.
If any reason can discover their course; how so many huge floudes fleet along
both day and night; How the sea furnishes them.
why the one swell and wax proud through winter waters, other when as the rest
are at the lowest, are at their highest. In the mean space let us separate
Nilus from the rest, that has a peculiar and singular nature^ we will reserve
a day for him, but now we will only entreat of common waters both cold and
hot. In which we are to enquire whether they spring so of their own natures,
or whether they have other causes. Of the rest likewise we will discourse,
which are either famous for their savor, or for any other particular profit:
Their diverse effects.
for some help the eyes, some the nerves, some heal desperate and inueterate
sicknesses that are given over by the Physicians. Some there are that heal
ulcers, some being drunk, fortify the internal parts, and remedy the
infirmities of the lungs and other inward vessels. Some restrain and stop
blood: in brief, they are no less different in their use, then in their
savor.

CHAP. II.
ALL waters are either standing, or flow, or are collected, or have diverse
veins, What their diversity and taste is.
some are sweet, some are various in taste, other some harsh or salt, or ^itte
for medicine: of which, we say, some are of brimstone, some of iron, and some
of allome. Their savor shows what their property is. They have besides these
many other differences, first in respect of touch, being either cold or hot,
then in regard of weight, being all either light or heavy. Again, in respect
of color, some there are that are pure, some troubled, blew and shining.
Likewise in regard of their effect and wholesomnesse, for some are healthsome
and profitable, others are deadly, and some there are that convert into stone.
Some are subtle and thin, others, thick, fat, and oily; some nourish, some
pass by without helping him any ways that drinks of them, some being drunk
cause fecundity.

CHAP. III.
THe position of the place is the cause why either the water stands or
flows; Of their situation.
it runs when it passes by steep and bending places, in the plain it is
still and standing: sometimes by a contrary wind it is driven and caused to
mount. Sometimes it is gathered together, and runs not: It is engrossed by
the means of showers, and is natural in respect of her sourse, yet is there
no cause to the contrary but that the water may spring and be multiplied in
one place. Which we obser^e in the lake Fucine into which all those waters are
derived that fall from the neigbouring mountains: Besides this, great and many
hidden waters it contains, which observe their color, although the winter
floudes flow into them.

CHAP. IIII.
FIrst of all therefore let us enquire, Whence issue so many waters at we see.
how the earth be sufficient to continue the course of rivers, from whence
there issues so much water^ we wonder that the seas receive not any increase,
by reason of so many rivers that discharge themselves into her. And no less
wonderful is it, that the earth feels no alteration and damage by those so
many waters that issue from it. Wha^ is it that has so filled it, that she
can discharge so much out of his secret^, to furnish at all times? what reason
soever we have delivered of Rivers, the same will we propose as ^ouching
brooks and fountains.

CHAP. V.
Diverse think that the earth receives again into her whatsoever waters she
has sent out, If the earth gives and receives the waters.
and that the seas increase not hereby, because they convert not that which
flows into them to their use, but deliver it out incontinently: for the
seawater by an unknown way passes through the earth, and discovers it self
again, and then secretly returns, and is strained, and depraved in his
passages, and being beaten by the diverse ingat^s, and ^^u^ti^s of the earth,
lays aside her saltness, and chan^eth the prauity of her savor, by passage
through so many different channels, and at last becomes swe^^ water.

CHAP. VI.
SOme think that whatsoever rain waters the earth entertaineth, do
afterward fall again into the rivers. If raines be the efficient cause of
waters.
And to strengthen their opinion, they say, that there are very few rivers in
those countries where it seldom rayneth. And therefore say they, the deserts
of AEthiopia are dry, and that there are few fountains to be found within
the heart of Africa, because the nature of the air is extremely hot, and for
the most part it is always Summer. These places then that have neither herbs
nor trees, but are sandy are very little, or never watered with raines, which
if they fall they suddenly dr^nke up. But contrariwise it is well known that
Germany and France and Italy their neighbor abound in springs and rivers,
because they have a moist air, and a summer, that is not without rain.

CHAP. VII.
THou see that many things may be urged against this opinion: First, The
re^utati^^ of the former opinion.
I who am a very diligent digger of vineyeards, affi^me this unto thee, that
there is no rain so great that wetteth the earth above ten foot deep. All
the humidity consumes it self in the upper crust thereof, and descends not
to the lower parts: how then can the rain furnish the rivers with water when
as it does but wette the upper part of the earth. The greater part hereof is
carried into the sea by the channels of rivers. The earth drinks up a very
little, and keeps it not, for either she is dry and consumes that which
falls upon her, or is wet, refusing that which the heaven too lauishly
powers upon her. And therefore rivers increase not upon the first raines, by
reason that the dry earth drinks it all up. Moreover, are there not rivers
that issue out of rocks and mountains? What increase should the raynes give
them that stream along the rocks, and find not any earth to stay upon? Add
hereunto, that in dry places in those pits which are dug two or three
hundredth foot deep, there are found sources of living waters in a depth,
whether the water cannot penetrate; so that you may know that there is no
celestial or reserved humor there but only pure and springing water. This
very argument re^uteth the opinion of those that allege that some fountains
are s^ene to cast out water on the tops of mountains; whence it appears,
that waters mount up on high, or that they are produced there, considering that
all raine-water falls downwards.

CHAP. VIII.
Diverse think that as in the exterior part of the earth many vast marshes
extend themselves, That the waters flow from some hidden places under the earth.
besides great and nauigable lakes; and as the seas are stretched out through
the huge spaces of earth, and ^re infused into the valleys, so the interior
parts of the earth abound in sweet waters, and that they flow no less then the
Ocean, and the arms thereof does with us, nay rather so much the larger, the
more the earth stretches out on high: and therefore from that deep abundance
the rivers proceed and are derived, which why wondrest thou that the earth
feels them not when they are taken from her, when as the Ocean has no sense
of them when they are added to them.

CHAP. IX.
SOme like of this cause: If air being converted to ^ater under earth be the
efficient cause of ^ater^^
They say that the earth has some secret cauities in her, and much spirits
which necessarily wax cold, being oppressed with a weighty obscurity, at
length becoming slow and without motion, and finally changes it self into
water. Even as the change of air is the cause of shadow among^^ us, so in the
earth the air produces the water. It cannot long time continue above us,
because it is weighty and still. Sometimes it is attenuated by the Sun,
sometimes it is dissipated by the winds, by means whereof we see, that there
are great spaces between raines. But all that which is under earth, to make
the air turn into water is always the same, perpetual obscurity,
continual co^d, unexercised thickness, always therefore will these yield
causes to fountains and floods: if we agree that the earth is mutable, yet
all that she shall thrust forth is thickened, because it is not conceived by a
pure and free air, and consequently is suddenly converted into water.

CHAP. X.
YOu see now the first causes, Whether water proceed from the earth.
how waters are bred under the earth^ Add hereunto also if thou will, That all
is made of all, air of water, water of air, fire of air, air of fire. Why
therefore should not earth be made of water, and water of earth? which if it
be changeable into anything, may be changed into water, nay most^ of all into
it. Both of them resemble one an other, both of them are heavy and thick, and
are lodged together in the Center of the world. Earth is made of water, and why
should not water be made of earth? But there are great Rivers: But when thou
see how great they are, consider again from how great a thing they come.
Again, thou wondrest that although some float incessantly, and others fly
with a maruailous swiftness, yet never have they want of new water. And what
will thou say, that whereas the winds impell the air, yet notwithstanding it
fails in no part being not carried in a certain channel as Rivers, but
turning by a sudden and spacious motion through this vast extent of the
heavens? Art thou not amassed to see that there is not one drop of water left,
after so many billows that have beaten against the rocks, and shores. There is
nothing deficient that returns into it self. Of the transmutation of one
element into an^other.
The elements do nothing ^ls^ but turn and return. That which the one
loses, the other gets: And nature examineth her parts as it were in a
balance, for fear l^a^t if there were too little on the one side, and too
much on the other, the world should fall into ruin. All things are in all
things, not only the air passes into the element of fire, but is never
without fire. Take away heat from it, it will freeze, it will grow thick, and
hard. The air is changed into water, yet in such sort that before that time it
was not without humor. Both air and water are made by earth, yet is she
never less without water then without air. And therefore the passage through
both the one and the other is more easy, because she is already intermixed
with those elements through which she must pass. The earth then has
humiditie, and this she expresses. She has the air likewise, which is
thickened by the shadow of winters cold, to the intent to produce humiditie:
She is changeable into humor, and uses her own nature.

CHAP. XI.
Why Rivers and fountains are dried up sometimes.
WHat, therefore say thou, if the causes be perpetual whereby Rivers and
fountains rise, why are they sometimes dried and sometimes issue from those
places where they were not? Oftimes their passages are intercepted by the
trembling and motion of the earth; and ruins cut of these issues, and by
restrayning the waters enforce them to seek new passages, yea and to enforce
their way or else to break forth their way in an other place by reason of some
earthquake. It falls out alm^st ordinarily amongst us, that the Rivers that
have lost their bed first spread themselves, and afterward having lost their
way do that which Theophrastus says, happened in the Mountain called Corycus,
in which, after an earthquake there brake forth diverse fountains that were not
discovered before. But some think that by diverse other intervenient accidents
the waters are derived and drawn from their accustomed courses. The time has
been when there was no water to be found in the mountain Hemus, but when as
the French men being besieged by Cassander had retired themselves into those
parts, and had cut down the woods, there appeared a great quantity of water
which the trees had retained for their aliment: which being cut down, that
humor that was wont to be consumed in nourishing them began to spread it
self. The like, says he, happened also about Magnesia. But if I may speak
without any offense to Theophrastus, this matter is unlikely. For the most part
those places that are shadowed are fullest of water, which would not come to
pass if the trees dried up the moisture, that have their nourishment so near:
but the force of Rivers springs from beneath and has far more extent and
humor then the roots can contain. Furthermore, the trees that are lopped
deserve more humor, not only to maintain their being, but also for their
increase. The same man says that about Arcadia, which was a City in Creete,
the Fountains and Lakes dried up, because the City was ruined, and the land
ceased to be manured: but after it began to be husbanded, the waters returned
again. By reason of this dryness they think that the earth is hardened, and
that remaining unmanured, it could not yield forth water. Whence comes it
therefore that we see many fountains in the Deserts and those places that are
no ways put in use? In brief, we find that there are many places in diverse
Countries which have been tilled up by reason of those waters that have been
found in them; and that other some have not begun to make show of sources,
because they have not been husbanded. For by this shall thou understand that
it is not raine-water that presently deriueth from a fountain those vast
floods, that are fit to bear great ships of burden, because that both in
winter and summer these floods have their equal course from the beginning unto
the ending. Rain may make a torrent, but not a River, that streameth and
floteth with an equal tide betwixt his brincks and bancks. The raines make not
the water, but excite the same.

CHAP. XII.
LEt us (if it seem good unto thee) examine this matter more nearly, Wha^ is
t^^ true caus^ of Rivers.
and thou shall see that thou art far from thy reckoning if thou consider the
true original of rivers: undoubtedly it is the abundance of perpetual water,
and such as never dries up, that is the cause of a River. If therefore you
ask me how water is made, I will entreat you also to answer me how air or
earth is made? if there be four elements a man cannot ask of thee whence
water is, for it is the fourth part of nature: why therefore wondrest thou that
so great a portion of Nature may always spread something out of it self; Even
as the air which is the fourth part of the world moves the winds, so the
water moves brooks and rivers: i^ the wind be a flowing air, every River is
a flowing water. I have given him sufficient force, since I have given him the
name of an element: for thou know that that which proceeds from it cannot
fail.

CHAP. XIII.
WAter, as Thales says, The opinion of Thales as ^ouching water.
is the strongest of all the Elements, and in his opinion it is the first,
because that all things have been created of water. For we likewise are either
of the same opinion, or iumpe in the conclusion. For we say that it is the fire
that occupies the world, and conuerteth all things into himself, which
vanishing and being gathered into it self, and afterward being extinct, there
remains nothing in the nature of things but water, and that in fire the hope
of the future world is enclosed: so the fire is the beginning of the world, and
water the ending. Do thou wonder that Rivers may always issue from this
Element, which was in stead of all, and out of which all things were? This
humor in the disposition of all things was reduced to the fourth, and so
placed, that it might suffer both to produce floods, rivers, and fountains.
That which follows is a foolish opinion of Thales, for he says that the
globe of the earth is sustained by water, and carried after the manner of a
boat, and fluctuateth in his mobilitie, and such time as he is said to tremble,
it is not therefore to be wondered at^ that there is sufficient water to make
Rivers, considering that all the world is in water. But hiss away and contemn
this old opinion. For thou art not to think that water enters by certain
creuises into this world, and works out a pomp.

CHAP. XIIII.
THe Egyptians made four elements, The opinion of the Egyptians as touchi^g
the number of the elements.
and then of every one of them two male and female. They suppose the air to
be the male because it is wind, female because it is obscure and still. They
call fire masculine, because it burns with a flame; feminine, because it
shines without hurting by touching. The stronger earth they call male, as for
example, stones, and rocks: they assign the name of female, to that which is
manuable and fit to be employed.

CHAP. XV.
How and from whence the waters proceed.
WHence is the Sea? From the beginning it was so made, he has veins whereby
he is impelled, and flows. As the way of the sea is vast and hidden, so is
that of the milder waters, which no course of any river whatsoever may dry up.
The reason of the forces of the same is hidden. There issues no more from it
then there is superfluity; we approve some of these opinions, but consider
besides these, that which ensues. I consent that the earth is governed by
Nature, and that it has some resemblance with our bodies, wherein there are
veins and arteries, the one to contain the blood, the other the spirit. In
the earth likewise there are such ways, whereby the water runs, and others,
whereby the wind whirleth, which Nature has so formed according to the
resemblance of our bodies, that our Ancestors have called them veins, which
are the sources of waters. But as in us, besides the veins, there are diverse
sorts of humors, either necessary, or superfluous and stinking. The brains
for the head, the marrow for the bones, the muskles, the excrements of the
eyes, the nerves in the joints to procure a more easy motion: so are there
diverse sorts of humiditie found in the earth. Some being ripened, are hardened
as metals, amongst which avarice has dug up gold and silver. There are
others likewise which are changed into stone. In some places the earth and
water melt themselves, as we see in Bitumen, a clammie, limie, and pitchie
substance, and in others. This is the cause of waters that are bred according
to the ordinance of Nature. But as in our bodies, so oftentimes in the earth
the humors are corrupted, either a stroke, or some shaking, or the age of the
place, or cold, or heat offense Nature: so a sulphurous earth will draw a
certain humor, which sometimes will continue long, Diverse humidities in the
earth, as in our bodies.
sometimes little. Even as therefore in our^ bodies when a vain is opened, the
blood flows so long, until there be no more, or until the orifice of the
prick be shut, and has a cicatrise; or in any other sort the blood be
stopped: in such sort in the earth, when the veins of the same are open, the
brooks or rivers spread themselves. That only is to be considered how great the
orifice is, and how the water is consumed: sometimes it is dried up by some
impediment, sometimes it unites it self, as it were, in a cicatris^, and
follows that way which she has made: sometimes this mass of earth, which,
as we said, is immutable, cease to convert the humiditie into nutriment:
sometimes the conduits that are dried are filled again, either in assembling
their own forces, or gathering it from others. For oft-times those things that
are void, being set near unto those things that are full, draw the humor from
them, which passes easily into another thing. Oftentimes the earth dries it
self, and afterward becomes moist. The same falls out under earth, which
happens in the clouds, that the earth thickeneth her self, and engendereth
an humidity so weighty, that she can no longer contain it. Oftentimes she
gathers a thin and dispersed liquor like unto dew, which is gathered from
diverse places into one. Those Masters that make fountains, call it the sweat
of the earth, because that certain drops are expressed through the
straitness of the place, or are drawn by cunning. In this place there needs
much humiditie for a little source. But as touching the greater rivers, they
proceed from very great causes and conceptions, sometimes they flow mildely, if
the water has only carried her self by her own weight: sometimes with
vehemency and great noise, if the air be intermixed and push it forth.

But why are some fountains for six hours space full, Of the flux and reflux
of some fountains, and the increase and decrease of some rivers in certain
seasons.
and six hours dry. It were but labor lost to name all those rivers which
swell for diverse months, and are small for certain other. It is not now
needful to seek out a reason for every one in particular, since I may yield
the same reason for all rivers in general. Even as the quartan ague comes at
an hour, the gou^ has a certain term, and purgation, if nothing hinder it,
keeps his critique day, and female produces her fruit in a prefixed time: so
the waters have their pauses both to ^bbe and flow. But some spaces are less,
and therefore more notable, some greater and no less certain. Why should a
man wonder hereat, when as thou see the order of things disposed by degrees,
according to assignations. The Winter has always kept his course. The Summer
is warmed in due time. The changes of Autumn and Spring observe their usual
customs: both the Solstice and AEquinoctium have reference to their days.
Under earth the Laws of Nature are less known unto us, yet are they not
less certain. Below, thou see as much under earth as above. For there are
there^ most spacious dens, infinite and great retreates, and large spaces
between the mountains that are hanged here and there. There are a number of
hollowes and bottomless pits that have swallowed up whole Cities, and have
hidden strange ruins in their depthes. These caves are full of air, (for
there is nothing void in the universe) and in spacious and obscure pooles,
likewise, there breed certain creatures (although confused and deformed) as if
engendered in a blind and fat air, and in waters ouergrowne with mud, diverse of
which are blind as Moales, and Rats, that are bred under ground, who want
light, because they have no need thereof. From thence likewise, as Theophrastus
thinks, fishes are drawn forth in some places.

CHAP. XVII.
THere are many things in this place which come unto thy mind, After some
digression he taunteth the unbridled vanity of dissolute men of his time, in
respect of their ps^.
which a man may term after a merry sort, both incredulous and fabulous, that
a man should go and fish with his pick axe, and not with nets and hooks. I
expect that some one should go a fishing in the sea. But why may not fishes as
well haunt upon the earth, as we trauerse the seas? In the end we will change
our abod^. Do thou wonder at that which I have spoken? How far more
incredible are the works of excess and dissolution, as often as she li^t to
falsify and surmount Nature? Fishes swim in the chamber, and under the very
table the fish is taken, that is dressed and served in presently to the table.
A Barbel newly taken is not delicate enough, if it dies not in their hands
that are invited to dinne. They are shut up, served in, and showed in pots of
glass, at which time men take pleasure in their color, when they are ready
to die, which is changed diversely, when as the fish begins to wax weak,
and beats her self to death by little and little. Some they kill in Gar^m,
or pickle, and dress them living. Whence are those then that think it
impossible that a fish should live under the earth, and be dug out, and not
taken? How incredible would this seem unto them, that a fish swimmes in
pickle, and that it was not killed for supper, but in the midst of supper,
and made much sport, and fed the eyes before it satisfied the belly.

CHAP. XVIII.
He continues hi^ reproof against men's excess.
LEt us give over this dispute, and suffer me to censure this excess. There is
nothing more fair, say thou, then to see a Barbel die. At such time as she
strugleth ^or life, first there appears a redness, and afterward she is
covered all with palenesse, which are equally varied, and the face of the
color is uncertain betwixt life and death. O long idleness of sleepie and
sluggish dissolution: too late has she been awakened, too late has she
known, that she was deprived and defrauded of so great a good. Yet fishermen
enjoyed this so great and goodly spectacle, having the means to see such a
fish dead and sodden for their table. We wondered to see them so dainty, that
they would not touch the fish, except it were taken the same day, which as they
said, should taste of the sea it self. Therefore were they carried in post,
and in every street whole companies made way for rippiers, that puffing and
crying out as they ran, to make way. But to what height is excess grown
unto? That fish that is caught and killed to day is reputed rotten. I will not
trust thee with a matter of so great importance, I will have it brought me
alive, and I will see it die. The stomachs o^ the belly-gods are s^^zed with
this loathing, that they cannot taste a fish, except they have seen it
swimming, and dying at their banquets. The more that excess and furious
desires of superfluities made them ingenious, the more also did their fury
contemning all usual matters, invent daily some new subtlety and
magnificence. We have heard it spoken, that in times past, that the Barbel that
was taken amongst rocks, and in stony places, was a dainty dish. But now we
hear them say that there is nothing more pleasing, then to see a Barbel die.
Give me the glasse-bodie into my hands, that I may see it leap and quiver.
When it has been much and long time praised, it is suddenly taken out of that
clear fish-poole, then every one as he is cunninger shows his opinion. See
how this rednes appears more tinctured then Vermelion. Behold what vains he
discovers on his sides, you would say his belly were of blood? What clear
and blew color has he discovered at one time. Now he stretched out himself,
and becomes pale and of one color. But amongst all these deuisers, you shall
find none of them that will sit by his friend that lies a dying, no man will
have the heart to see his father yield up the ghost, although he has wished
his death heartily. Who is he amongst all these gourmands, that follows a
dead man of his family to the fire. He will abandon his parents and friends at
the last hour, yet notwitstanding they assemble themselves together to see a
dying fish? For in their opinion there is nothing more fair. I cannot choose,
but gird at them sometimes, and use some tart and rude terms in respect of
these men, who when there is any question of kitchin-worke, are not content
with their teeth, throats, and bellies to feed their excess, except they
sur^et with their eyes.

CHAP. XIX.
But to return unto my purpose, The difference of waters under the earth.
take this for a certain argument, that in the hollow places of the earth,
there is a great abundance of hidden waters that breed much corrupt and muddy
fish, which if at any time they break forth, bring with them an immeasurable
troop of fishes horrible to sight, and filthy and unwholesome in taste; truly
at such time as a great quantity of this water is sued out o^ the earth in the
country of Caria, near to the City of Lorina: all they died whosoever did eat
of those fishes that were drawn out of that River which before time was
unknown. Pestilent fishes and why.
Neither is this to be wondered at; for such fishes as these^ because they had
been long time shut up, were become great, fat and long, but slimy and fetured
in the darkness, and had never seen the light, whence comes the
wholesomenes of all victuals. That fishes may breed in the hollow of the
earth, it appears because that E^les are taken in hidden places, in troubled
waters and pits which yield a meat of hard digestion, by reason of their
sluggishnesse, especially when they are taken in those places where there is so
much mudde, as they may wholly bury themselves therein: so then the earth has
not only veins of water, which by their current may make rivers, but also
floudes of great extent, whereof some run always underneath the earth,
until such time as they discharge themselves in some gulf, some appear under
some lake. And who knows not that there are certain pooles which appear
without bottom? whereto tends this? to show that the great rivers have a
continual matter to maintain them, whose extremities are not to be touched as
they may be in springs and fountains.

CHAP. XX.
ANd why have waters diverse tastes? The causes of the diverse savors of waters.
for four causes. The first is of ^he earth through which the waters are
carried. The second, by reason of the agreement and conueniency of the same.
The third of air which is transformed into water. The fourth of corruption
which happens upon diverse occasions. These causes give diverse sauors and
properties unto waters. These give the virtue to heal infirmities, these
yield a stinking dampe and a pestilent vapor, the lightness or heaviness, or
too much heat or cold. It imports also to know whether they pass by the
veins of sulphur, nitre or bitume. If they be corrupted by some dangerous
minerals, a man cannot drink of them without the hazard of his life. Therefore
it is that Ovid says: The Cicones have such a flood that being drunk does
change, Examples of maruailous waters.

Their bowl that do drink to stone, all else to marble strange.
This is a medicine, and has a mud of that nature, that it both agglutinateth
and hardneth that whereupon it is applied. Even as the dust of the territory of
Pruzzel if it touches this water is turned into stone; so contrariwise this
water if it touches any thing that is solid, it cleaves, and is affixed
thereunto. Thence is it that such things as are cast into this lake, are
forthwith drawn out as hard as stone. The like whereof falls out in some
places of Italy, whether you cast a reed or the leaves of trees into the same,
thou shall draw them out in few days in the form of stone: for the wind
incloseth the body on every side, and by little and little takes hold and
hardne^h it. This will seem less wonde^full and strange unto thee, if thou
observe how these white and sulphurous waters are hardened and congealed about
their channels and pipes. Some such cause have these lakes whereof whosoever
drinks as the Poet says; Grows furious^ or else falls to Lethargy.
It has the like force that wine has, but more v^hement: for even as
drun^kennesse until it be dried is madness, and by the weight thereof
drives him that is drunk into sleep: so the sulphurous virtue of this wat^r
has some more powerful venom in it by means of the corrupted air, whence
follows either fury or lethargy, the like evil has the river Lynces^ius.

Which who so drinks although his draught be small,
Stumbles as if pure wine had made him fall.
CHAP. XXI.
THey that have looked down into some deep gulses, do die, so sudden is the
venom which kills those birds that do but fly over it, Whence proceeds
these diverse effects in waters.
such is the air, and such the place from whence this deadly water distilleth.
But if the venom of that air and place be less vehement, the evil also is
in some sort lenified, it only debilitateth the nerves, and stupifieth them,
as it were with drunkenness. Neither do I wonder, that the place and air do
infect the waters, and makes them like unto those regions, by which, and from
which they come^ The savor of the pasture appears in the milk, and the force
of the wine is extant in the vinegar; there is nothing that has not some taste
of that from whence it was taken and bred.

Of the Ocean created in the beginning of the world.
AN other kind there is of water also, that as we think had his beginning with
the world, which if it be eternal, so is this likewise, and if it has any
beginning, it likewise has a beginning with him. Ask you me what this is? It
is the Ocean with all those other seas that either flow from it, or wash the
borders of it, Some are of opinion that certain rivers, (whose nature cannot
be expressed) have had their beginnings with the world, as Ister and Nilus,
and other spacious floudes, and such as a man cannot reckon in the rank of
others, nor drive them from the same source.

CHAP. XXIII.
THis is therefore the division of waters, Diversity of terrestrial waters.
according to some men's opinions. After these there are celestial waters,
which the clouds power down from above. Amongst the terrestrial waters, there
are some (if I may so speak it) that swim and flow above the earth, othersome
there be that are hidden, whereof we have yielded a reason.

CHAP. XXIIII.
SOme there are that yield diverse reasons why certain waters are hot, Why
these are hot waters.
and others so boiling, that they can be of no use, except they be cooled by
the air, or tempered by the mixture of cold water. Empedocles thinks that
the water is hot by those fires which the earth covers and concealeth in
diverse places, especially if they run under that soil by which they take
their passage. We are wont to make certain Dragons and Serpentines, and
diverse other fashions of vessels, in which we fasten diverse little pypes of
thin brass bending downwards, to the end that the water distilling and turning
o^tentimes before the fire, may get issue in such space of time wherein it may
take heat. It therefore enters cold, and f^oweth out hot. Empedocles is of
this opinion, that the same is done under the earth, to whose opinion they
condescend whose bathes are warmed without fire. A warm air is infused
thereunto, which serves in stead of fire. This running through the pypes
warmeth the walls and vessels of the bath, as if fire had been set near unto
it. In brief, the cold water is by thi^ means changed into hot, neither
does the euaporation draw any savor, because it passes through closed and
covered places. Some think that these waters that either pass by or enter
these places that are full of sulphur, draw their hea^e by the benefit of ^he
matter through which they pas^e, which appears by their smell and taste; for
they yield the quality of the matter which has warmed them; and least thou
should wonder at this accident, power me but water upon quicklime, and it
will burn.

CHAP. XXV.
Diverse waters are deadly which neither offend in odor nor in taste. Of
venomous and deadly waters.
About Nouacris in Arcadia there is a river which the inhabitants of the place
call Styx which deceives strangers, because both in sight, and in smell, it
resembles other^, such as are the poisons of most cunning poysoners, which
cannot be discovered but by death: but this water whereof I have ^poken a
little before corrupts with incredible swiftness, neither is there any
remedy for it, because that as soon as it is drunken, it thickneth and
hardneth as plaster does in the water, Notable examples.
and closes up the bowels. There is likewise a cer^aine venomous wa^ter, in
Thessaly about Tempe, which both wild beasts and all kind of cattle do fly
from, which pierces both iron and brass, such force it has to mollify those
things that are heard. There are no trees that grow about it, nor any herbs
but it kills them. In some Rivers there is a wonderful property. For some
of these there are, which being drunk do tincture and die the flocks of
sheep, and within a very short space those that were black carry white
wool; and those that came with white fleeces return with black. The like
effects likewise have two Rivers in Beotia, whereof the one is called Melus,
that is to say, black by reason of his operation, yet both of these issue from
the same lake, though they have different effects. In Macedonia likewise, as
Theophrastus says, Pliny calls it Ceron in his second book.
there is a flood, whitherto they that desire to have white sheep drive their
flocks, which the longer they have drunk, the more deeply are they dyed and
turned into white: but if they have need of a brown color, they have a ready
and free Dier, for they drive the same flock to the flood Cerona. I have
modern authors that write that there is a River in Galatia, that blacketh all
that which is steeped in it, that in Capadocia there is another that changes
the color of horses only (and not other beasts) causing their hairs to be
spotted with white. It is well known that there some lakes that bear them up,
who cannot swim. The cause of such effects.
There was in Sicily, and at this day there is in Siria a pond, on the top
whereof whole bricks do swim, and although heavy things be cast into the
same, yet can they not sink unto the bottom. And the cause hereof is very
manifest. Weigh me a thing whatsoever it be, and counterpoise it with water, if
the water be more weighty it will bear up the thing that is lighter then it
self, and will raise the same above her the more lighter it is, and that which
is more weighty will descend. But if the weight of the water, and the thing
thou counterpoisest with it be equal, she shall not draw it to the bottom,
neither shall it wholly swim above the water, but it shall be carried on even
with the water, but shall swim as it were half drowned, and eminent in no
part. Thence comes it that some pieces of timber sometimes float wholly above
the water, other some are half within the water, and others sink to the
bottom. For when as the weight of the wood and water are equal, and that the
one thing yields in no sort to the other that which is more weighty
discendeth, and that which is lighter is carried on the top of the water. But
we esteem the heavy and light, not according to our own estimate, but in
comparison of the thing that should carry and bear up the same. When as
therefore the water is heavier then the body of a man or a stone, O^ ston^s and
other (...) things that ^loat above the water.
she suffers not that which is more lighter to sink unto the bottom. Whence
it comes to pass that the stones themselves float upon the water, yea, even
those that are hardest and most solid. For there are many Pummice stones and
such as are light, whereof certain Islands in Lydia are composed, the which for
this cause swim in the Sea, if a man will believe Theophrastus. For mine own
part I my self have seen an Island in the lake of Cutilias that floated, The
reason of the marvelous Isle of Cutili^s.
another in the lake of Vadimona, another in the lake of Station, swimming upon
the water. The Island of Cutilias has trees and herbs growing on it,
although the water bears it up, and is driven hither and thither, not only
by a strong wind, but by every gentle gale whatsoever. Neither remains it
either by day or night in one place, so moveable is it upon every breath of
wind. There are two causes hereof: the weight of the medicinable water, and
consequently more heavy; and the matter of the Isle which is apt to be
carried, which has no solid body, although it nourish trees. For happily the
fat humor takes hold of, and binds together the lighter trunkes, and those
leaves that are scattered in the lake. Therefore although there be some stones
in the same, yet shall thou find them spongie and hollow, such as those are
which a thick water collecteth and breeds about the brinks of some
medicinable fountains, which are engendered of the foam that is made by the
excrements of the water, that gather themselves together. That thing of
necessity must be light, which is made of another thing that is windy and
void. There are some secrets whereof a man can yield no reason; There are
infinite secrets in nature, whereof a man cannot give a reason.
as why the water of Nilus makes women fruitful, in such sort that it has
opened and disposed to conception the matrice of some women, that has been
closed by long sterrilitie; why likewise some waters in Lycia retain the seed
conceived by women, who had their matrice ever open. For mine own part, I
number these things amongst those that are indiscreetly and rashly published.
Some believe that there are certain waters that breed the scab in men's
bodies, or that poured on the skin or drunken, the leprosy, and other white
and deformed spots, which vice they ascribe to that water that is gathered of
dew. Who would not think that those waters that are turned into crystal are
most weighty? yet is it far otherwise; for this falls out in the lightest
waters, which the cold very easily congealeth, by reason that they are no
ways thick. But whence this stone is made, it appears very plainly by the
name which the Graecians give the same, How crystal is made.
for they call it (...), as well the transparant stone as the Ice, whereof it
is supposed that the crystal is made. For the celestial water, having very
little earthly substance in it, when it is grown hard by the continency and
vehemence of the longer cold is thickened more and more, until such time as
(all air being excluded) it shuts in it self, and that humor which was is
made a stone.

CHAP. XXVI.
IN summer some floods are increased, as Nilus (whereof we will render another
reason, Why some Rivers increase in Summer.
in a more convenient place) Theophrastus writes, that in Pontus there are
certain rivers that increase in the summer time, whereof he judges that there
are three causes; first, because at that time most of all the earth is apt to
be changed into winter; next, because there are some huge showers that fall in
a more remote place, whose waters streaming along by secret passages, are
silently discharged into the same; thirdly, if the entry be beaten with
continual winds, and the flood be beaten, and the water mounteth back
again, which seems to increase because it is not poured out into the Sea;
Other diverse accidents in Rivers and Fountains.
the fourth reason is from the Planets, for these in some months urge more
then in other some, and dry up the floods; in other places being farther off,
they draw and consume less, in such sort^ that that which is lessened in one
season is increased in another. There are some floods that manifestly fall into
some bottomless pit, and so are swallowed up from our sight: some are consumed
by little and little, and after some intermission return again and reassume
both their name and course: the cause is manifest, there is some vacuitie under
the earth. But all water by nature discendeth downward, and is carried into a
void place. The Rivers therefore that are received thither make their secret
course, but as soon as any thing that is solid meets with them, and stays
them, by working a passage that resists them, lest they renew and pursue
their former course. So when as Licus is drunk up and drayned
By yawning earth, at last he mounts again
Far from the place where first it was contained,
And springs and floats with in another maine,
And now drunk up, straight with a silent course
Sliding along, he spends his floods untamed
Amidst the Gre^kish Ocean, and his source
Is in that place proud Erasinus named.
The flood Tygris does the like in the East; it is swallowed up, and after
having made a long journey underneath the earth, at last in a far remote
place it rises again undoubtedly the same. Some fountains at a certain time
cast out their excrement, as Arethusa in Sicilia does from five to five years,
in Summer during the Olympian games: from thence springs that common report,
that the river Alphaeus passes from Achaia thither, and running under the sea,
without discovering her self, or breaking forth until such time as she has
attained the Sicilian shore. Therefore in those days when the Olympique games
are solemnized, the excrements of those beasts that are sacrificed, being cast
down the stream, found their issue and appear there. This, my dearest
Lucillius, have thou expressed in thy Poem: the like has Virgil done,
speaking to the fountain Arethusa; So grant the gods, that whilst thy milder
wave
The swift Sicanian stream does undermine,
That bitter tasted Doris never have
The means to intermix his wave with thine.
There is a fountain in Cheronese of Rhodes, that after a great space of time
pours out from her bottom certain ordures, until such time as it is wholly
and entirely purified. The like to this do diverse other fountains in other
places, which vomit out not only their mud and the leaves of trees, but also
all other things that are cast thereinto. The like does the Sea in every place,
whose nature is this; to discharge whatsoever carcasses or uncleanness it
has in it upon the shores. Some parts of the Sea do the like in some seasons
of the year, as about Messina and Milas, at which time she casts up upon the
sands, I know not what excrement, like unto doung, and boyleth and ripleth,
exhaling a stinking odor; whence the fable rises, That the horses of the Sun
are stabled there. But there are some things whereof it is a hard matter to
yield a reason: and as touching this, which is now in question, although some
have diligently observed when this purgation is made, The causes of the
purgation of these Rivers.
yet is there no certainty thereof; so that the nearest cause can hardly be
found out but only the general, which is, that all still and enclosed waters
purge themselves ordinarily, for excrements cannot stay in those which have a
current, that carries and rauisheth all things with it. Those that push not to
their shores that which is fallen into them, have a stream that is less or
more violent. But the Sea draws from her bottom, and casts upon her shores
the bodies of the dead, the wrecks of ships, and those small things that she
receives purging her self as well in fair weather as in stormy.

CHAP. XXVII.
But this place moves me to demand when the destinated day for the deluge
shall come, The description of a d^luge that ru^nateth the whole world.
how the greater part of the earth shall be covered with waters? whether it
shall be done by the virtue of the Ocean? whether the water that appears
shall raise her self against us? whether the violent raines shall fall without
intermission, or if the winter having driven away the former shall break the
clouds, and power down abundant waters; or if the earth shall more largely
extend all her waters, and shall discover new fountains, or whether there
shall be diverse concurrent causes to one so great a desolation, so as the
raines shall fall in great abundance, the Rivers shall exceed their bounds,
the Seas forsaking their ordinary limits shall cover the earth, and all waters
gathered together, shall run in one company, with a deliberation to extinguish
mankind. Thus it is; nothing is difficult unto nature, especially when she
^asteth to her end: in the creation and beginning of things she uses her
forces sparingly, and dispenses her self by fallacious increases; but when
she entendeth ruin, she suddenly employeth all her forces. How long time is
there required from the day of the conception of a child, until the time he
forsakes his mothers womb? with how great labors is he brought up from his
cradle? and what care must there be had in breeding and bringing up this little
body? But how suddenly and without labor is he brought to nothing? An age
builds Cities, but an hour destroys them. The wood that has flourished
long is made ashes in a moment. All things stand and flourish under a provident
care, and are dissolved quickly and suddenly. All that which nature would alter
in the estate of things that are created, suffices to ruinate mankind. When
as therefore this necessity of time shall come, the destinies move many causes
at once, and without a great concussion of the world so great a change cannot
be made, as some think, amongst whom is Fabianus. First of all the immeasurable
raines fall, and the heaven is wholly covered, without any appearance of the
Sun: a thick, moist, dark and continual fogge inuironeth the earth, and
cease not to distill, neither Vines or corn attain unto their maturitie:
all seeds are lost in the earth, the ^ields are covered with such herbs as
grow in Marshes and Plashes, expecting as yet some greater desolation; for the
roots are loosened, the trees fall, the Vine and every other plant has no more
hold of the earth that is soft and fluid. It sustaineth no more by the means
of the waters^ either herb or grass: famine presses all men, and they
enforced to seek their sus^enance after the manner of the ancients beat
down and shake down the Burgens and Acornes of the Holme and Oak, and all
such that in such necessities a tree may furnish, being shaken or beaten with
stones. The rotten houses fall unto the ground, the foundations sink being
mouldred and loosened by moisture, the whole earth is glutted with water, and
in vain do men labor to underprop that which falls to ruin. For every
foundation is in a slippery place, and in a muddie ground there is nothing
stable. After that the showers increase more and more, and those snowes that
were gathered in ages begin to melt. A headlong torrent, falling from the
highest mountains carries and hurleth away whole woods that have no settled
root, and tumbleth these stones that are washed away from the earth with the
rest. It drowneth villages, carries away troops of beasts, and those little
cabbans that it meets withal, and then assaulteth the greater houses.
Afterward it ouerturneth Cities and draws away with it the inhabitants,
enclosed in their own walls, who know whether they shall sink under their
houses, or perish in the water; so sudden is the accident that either should
oppres^e or drown them. Afterward, being increased by some other torrents
that join themselves with her, they ouerflow all the Champaine. Finally, being
swollen and ouercharged by the ruin of diverse nations, it lays hold on all
things. As touching the Rivers that are spacious in themselves, and are
ravished by the torrents, they forsake their channels, what think you will
become of Danubius, the Rhine, and Rhosne, who in their channels have a torrent
that runs marvelous swiftly? What can they do, when after they have
ouerflowed their bounds they are made new Rivers, and having broken the earth
have got themselves a new passage? With what violence flows the River of
Rhine when it falls into the Champaine countries, and finding an extent
sufficient to weaken his waves, fills himself every way with water, as if he
were enclosed in some straight channel? And Danubius likewise at such time as
he not only beats the foot, but also the midst of the mountains, yea,
approaches the very tops of the same, bearing with it not only the moistened
sides of the mountains, but the rocks that are hurried down, and the
Promontories of great Regions, which by reason of the weakness of their
foundation are separated from the continent. At length, finding no passage
because it has included it self it swells on every side, and swalloweth up
at once a whole extent of countries and Cities. Mean while the raines
continue, the heaven thickneth more and more; and thus by course of time the
evil is augmented. The precedent obscurity becomes black, fearful and
terrible, night incessantly beaten with dreadful lightnings, which the heaven
darteth one after another: the Sea seems to be enraged being increased by the
access of so many floods, and too much restrained at such time as she was
within her bounds. The shores stand no longer, they exceed their limits, the
torrents permit them not to enlarge themselves, and push back the floods,
whereof the most part as it were arrested by a bar that is not sufficiently
large, get passage from the one side unto the other, and make a new Sea, and
make the Champains resemble a standing poole. At that time as far as the eye
may aim there is nothing that can be discovered but water. All the noise
comes from the bottom, and the waters are the highest above all things, only
in the tops of mountains there are certain shallow places, where men saw
themselves, with their wives and children, driving their cattle before them:
all traffic and intercourse between Nations cease because the water has
filled all the valleys. In some the highest place, the remainder of mankind
maintained themselves, who being reduced to this extremity had this sollace,
that their fear was translated into stupiditie, being so astonished that fear
could not hurt them In brief, they were touched with no sense of grief which
loses his force in him that is miserable above the sense of evil. So then
the mountains resemble Isles, and increase the number of the Ciclades, as the
most ingenious Poet most wittily specifieth, saying as the greatness of the
thing required him, All things were Sea, nor had the Sea a shore.
Except he had reduced so much vigor of wit and plenty of matter to triuiall
toys, saying, The Wolf his head amongst the sheep did rear,
And waltering wa^es did furious Lions bear.
This is to exceed measure to jest and wanton it, in the ruin of the world. He
spoke mighty things, and began to set down the image of so great a confusion,
when he said, The unbridled floods run through the Champaine plains,
And mighty Towers lie buried under floods.
It was magnificently spoken if he had taken no care what sheep and wolves
did. But can any one swim in such a deluge and ouerflow? And were not the
beasts drowned as soon as the waters had laid hold of them and carried them
away? Thou have conceived the image and description of this disorder, as great
as it should be: if the heaven it self fall, endure it. Thou shall know that,
which becomes thee, if thou set before thine eyes the whole world floating in
water. Let us now return unto our purpose.

CHAP. XXVIII.
THere are some that think that the earth may well be beaten with excessive
raines, but not drowned. If the earth may be drowned with waters.
Those things that are the greatest must be violently strooken: the rain will
spoil the corn, the hail will beat down the fruit, the Rivers will
ouerflow their bounds, Whence proceeds a deluge, according to Senec^es and
the Stoics opinion.
and yet will not forsake their channels. Some there are that attribute this
ruin to the ouerflow of the Sea. It cannot be that a deluge should proceed
from the violence of torrents, or raines, or rivers. When the end of the earth
is near, and that it pleases nature that all mankind should perish, I grant
that continual and immeasurable raines fall from the heavens: that the
Northerly winds are suppressed, that the Southerly blow: that the clouds, the
tempests, and rivers increase. Yet harms do more increase,
The corn is washed away upon the plain,
The Plowman spends his vows, and toils in vain;
All what the year could yield for pain or cost;
Is drowned in water, and the labor lost.
It was not necessary that the earth should be offended, but only hidden. After
these beginnings the Seas increase, but beyond measure, they spread their waves
more largely then ever the greatest tempest did. The winds themselves that
raise them at their backs, entangle themselves with the waves of the Sea,
which break themselves upon the shores that are far estranged from sight.
Afterward when they had enlarged themselves, made a new Sea, from the depth of
the greatest Sea there arises a new flood, which brings with it a mischief
far greater then the former; for even as the matter of the air and the
aetheriall Region is very ample, so is that of the water, which abounds
marueilously in her secret places, she being sufficiently moved (for the
floods are the ministers of destiny) makes the waves swell wonderously, and
animateth her self violently. Then rises she to an incredible highness, and
mounteth above the highest and most as^ur^d retreates of men. It is no
difficult matter for the element of water to raise it self above the high^est
tops and Promontories of the earth. For if a man measure by the eye the crest
of the highest mountains, he shall find that the sea ^qualleth them in
height; for the globe of the earth is equally round. The^e caueties and
plains are such, that on every part they make an orb, wherein are
comprehended these as which make a part thereof, and fulfill the round. But
even as he that casts his eyes a long way, deceives himself and cannot
deprehend the places, which by little and little bow downward so can we not
comprehend the bowings of the ^ea, and all that which we see seems to be a
plain, yet is it round and like unto the land. Therefore also is it that the
sea swells not much, but incontinently slideth away, because it is enough for
her to rise a little, either to equal or surmount the rest, neither slippeth
she away from the banks where she is lowest, but from the midst, where the
great assembly of Waters is. In what season the flux and reflux of the sea is
greatest.
But even as the flux and reflux of the sea is accustomed ^o be the greatest,
during the Equinoctial in the time of the conjunction of the Sun and Moon;
so the deluge that is sent to cover all the earth, and which shall be the
greatest and most violent that men are accustomed to see, draws a more
infinite abundance of water with it, and never abateth until it has surpassed
and covered the tops of the highest mountains. The flux and refluxe of the
sea increases and decreaseth in some place more then a hundredth miles, and
never fails but keeps always the same order; for it increases and
decreaseth by measure. God speaks oftentimes by Pagans mouths that which is
assured in christian belief.
But in the time of deluge, it neither keeps measure nor rule. How comes
this to pass say thou? in such sort as the end of the world shall be by an
universal fire. Both the one and the other shall come to pass at such time as
it shall please God to give a beginning to better things, and give an end to
the old, Fire and water have the dominion over terrestrial things, From them
proceed the beginning and end of all things, as often then, as it pleases the
heavens that things shall be renewed, the sea shall ouerflow us, in such sort as
the fire from above shall lay hold on all things, when by an other end he would
bring all things to nothing.

CHAP. XXIX.
He continues to speak of the causes of deluge in his sense, and according to
other men's opinions, but by the light of nature the transcendent knowledge i^
^ying in the bo^ome of true Christians.
SOme think that the earth is shaken also, and that the ground being broken
open, there appear new heads of rivers, which cast forth more abundance of
waters, as from a place that is as yet full. Berosus that has interpreted
Belus says, that thi^ is caused by the motion of the stars, and maintains
it so assuredly, that he sticks not to set down the time of the end of the
world, as well by fire as by water, affirming that the earth shall be burned at
such time as all the stars which now hold diverse courses shall mere in the
sign of Cancer, so settled and placed in the same point, that a man may draw a
direct line through all their centres and circles, that the deluge shall cover
the earth, when as the same stars shall assemble and meet together in
Capricorn. In order, the one is the longest day in Summer, and the shortest
day of the winter under the other. The signs are of great efficacy and power,
which upon the changes of the year cause such moments: for mine own part I
reject not any of the causes (for one alone cannot cause so much mischief)
annexing unto them that which the Stoikes think. Whether it be that the world
be a spirit or body, by the disposition of of nature, it contains in it
trees, plants, and all that which it ought to do and suffer, from the
beginning of the world unto the end thereof, no otherwise then in the seed are
enclosed all the parts of the body of a man which should be formed. The Infant
that is borne in his mothers womb, has the roots of the beard and hair he
shall wear one day. In this little Mass likewise are all the lineaments of
the body, and all that which austerity shall discover in him. So the original
of the world has no less contained the Sun, the Moon, the reuolutions of
the Stars, the birth of living creatures, as the causes of the change of
terrestrial things. In them has been the deluge which comes by the order
of heaven, The Paradoxe of the Stoikes as touching the universal deluge, and
the end of the world, re^u^ed by the celestial v^ritie contained in Moses,
where a promise was made to the Patriarch Noe, that there should be no more any
universal deluge.
even as Winter and Summer do. It shall not therefore be done by rain,
neither by inundation of the sea, neither by quaking of the earth, but with all
these accidents which shall assist Nature, to the end that her determinations
should be accomplished and executed: yet as touching the principal cause, it
shall proceed from the earth it self, which as we have said is changeable,
and must resolve her self into water. Whereas therefore the end of all things
shall be come: at such time as the parts of the world must perish and be
disanulled, in such sort as they may be molded a new, and made better then
before, there shall more water be made then ever there was: for now the
aliments are distributed to every one according as it is behouefull. There must
something at that time join it self with an other, to the end that such
things that subsist in counterwaight should be troubled and confused by the
inequality that should happen. The most shall be found in the water, that has
nothing more for the present, then that which is necessary to enuiron the
earth, and not to drown it: if you will add any thing thereunto, it must
needly discharge the same in an other place. How shall it then be, that the
earth as being leas^ powerful, shall sink under that which is more strong?
She shall begin at that time to rot her self, and afterward being
moistened to melt it self into humor, and to fall to mudde. At that time the
rivers shall mount above the mountains, and shall shake them with a mighty
force, and afterward shall swallow them without noise. All the earth shall
vomit out waters, the tops of the mountains shall break forth in
fountains. Even as the wholesomest parts of the body become sick, and these
that are nearest to an ulcer wax vlcerated: so the mightiest regions of the
earth converted into water shall melt themselves likewise, and shall distill
from all parts. The rocks shall cleave in sunder to give passage to the waters
that shall assemble themselves to make a sea. The Straights of Venetian and
Sicilian seas shall be no more Charibdis and Scilla shall not be spoken of.
The new Sea shall swallow up all these fictions, and the Ocean that at this day
beguirteth the remotest parts of the earth, shall then be in the midst of the
waters. What shall then be? The Winter shall dominere over all other seasons,
the Summer shall be no more, and every star that before time dried up the
earth shall have no more heat or effect. All the names of particular seas, as
that of Casp^um, Erithrea the red, The Mediteranean, the greater seas, and
others shall perish^ being all of them intermixed together, and all that which
nature had disposed in part^, confused in one: neither Rampires nor high Towers
shall warran^ any man. The templ^^ shall no ways profit the suppliants, nor
the high places of Cities, because the water shall overtake those that ^^ie,
and bear them away out of their strongest Towers. Th^s predictio^ is wholly
fals^.
It shall from East to West, and one day shall bury all mankind, ouerturning
all that which fortunes favor has cherished so long time, all that which is
so much raised above the common, the great palaces, riches, magnificence, and
mighty Monarchies.

CHAP. XXX.
An other error that the earth is made to be drowned because in an universal
deluge, where as God by Moses speaks expr^sly to the contrary.
AL things as I have said are easy unto nature especially, those things which
she has resolved to do from the beginning, whereunto she comes not
suddenly but determinately. But from the first day of the world, as from his
informed unity, she came to take this habitude which we see she has, she
prefixed the day wherein the earth should be drowned, and to the end it might
not be an enterprise of difficult execution as if it were a new work: the
seas long since have exercised and fashioned themselves thereunto. See thou
not how the floudes of the Ocean run toward their banks, as if they sought
liberty: Have thou not observed how the flood has advanced it self, and put
the sea in possession of the earth? Do thou not perceive how the sea does
nothing but ^ome, and tempests against the bounds which restrain her? What
danger is there in that part where thou hear such a tumult, and from whence
issue so many rivers with so great noise, where Nature has lodged so much
water to assail us on every side, when she thinks fit? Is it not true,
that in digging the earth we find water, and when as either undermined by
avarice, or pushed forward by an other cause, we have dug and searched a
little deeper, sometimes a bloody death ensues. Furthermore, there are
certain Lakes under the earth that are maruailous great, and much hidden sea;
besides a great number of rivers that streams through certain passages under
earth. There shall be therefore on every side certain courses of this
deluge, some part of the waters floating through the earth, others about the
same; these being long times brideled and restrained shall finally get the
upper hand, and shall join their floudes with the rivers, and the pooles with
the marshes. The seas shall fill the brims and mouths of all fountains, and
shall enlarge them. Even as the belly in emptying it self wastes our bodies
as the forces are dissipated by swet; in like sort, the earth shall melt i^
self, and other causes ceasing shall find a means to plunge and drown it
self in it self, so think I that so many great things shall confound
themselves together, neither shall there be any long delay in the ruin. When
as once the world shall remitte any thing of his course and diligence, and the
accord which is betwixt the parts thereof shall be shaken, incontinently the
clouds shall break forth, the waters beneath shall is^ue from their
bottomless caves to cover the earth. There is nothing more violent, more hard
to be stayed, more rebellious, or more pernicious to those that would
restrain the same then a violent water. She shall use the liberty which was
granted her, and by the commandment of nature she shall fill all that which
she rrauerseth and enuironeth. Even as the fire issuing from diverse places
suddenly sets all on fire, Understanding this of time to come, it is a mee^
^able, it was once in Noah's t^me, and shall be no more.
the flames conspiring and assembling together to make one body; so in a moment
the seas that are vented and powered forth, shall come and join in one; but the
waves shall not rage always thus: but after that, mankind shall be ruined,
and beasts likewise be brought to confusion, whose natures men had taken upon
them; the earth shall suck up the waters, and constrain the sea to return
within his bounds, and to tempest in her channel. The ocean being driven far
from our limits, shall be chased into her caves, and the ancient order shall
be reestablished. Every living Creature shall be engendered anew, and the
earth shall be inhabited with innocent men, and borne to better hap. But
mankind shall not persevere long in this integrity; it shall only be for as
long time, as men shall be, new wickedness shall incontinently fly into the
midst of them Virtue is hard to be found, she requires a guide and
governor: but as touching vices, men learn them without a Master.

The End of the third Book of the Natural Questions.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS The fourth Book.
THE PREFACE.
What contentment a virtuous man receives by himself.
THou art much delighted (my Lucillius, the best of me) in Sicily and in the
government of the same: because as thou writest unto me, it is full of repose
and without trouble. But it will please thee far more, if thou will contain
thy self within thy limits, and make not that an Empire, which is but a
Procuration and ^ouernment. I doubt not but thou will carry thy self in thi^
sort^ I know how far thou art estranged from ambition, and how familiarly
thou art addicted and delighted in honest retirement and the study of good
letters. They that cannot support and contain themselves, have need of the
conversation of men, and multiplicitie of affairs. But thou accordest very
well with thy self: neither wonder I that few men are partakers of this so
great good: we are all of us too imperious and troublesome to our selves.
Sometimes we cherish our selves too much, otherwhiles too little. To day our
hearts are puffed up with pride, to morrow covetousness tormenteth us: now are
we prostituted by vain pleasures, anon after burned with cares and travail,
and that which is worst of all, we are never alone and retired to our selves.
We ^ust ^eeds therefore be in continual debate, being accompanied by so many
enormous vices. Do therefore, my Lucillius, that which thou were accustomed to
do: separate thy self as much as thou can from the community, neither
permit thy self to be accosted by flatterers, for these are their
crafts^masters in bewitching the greater and richer sort. The poison o^
^lattery a taste for great men.
Thou shall hardly esca^e them, although thou take heed of them. Believe me,
they will entrap t^^e, if thou betray thy self to their treasons. Flatteries
have naturally this force, that they are pleasing, although they be rejected;
and being oftentimes ex^luded, at last they are entertained. Repulse makes
them increase, neither is there any disgrace or outrage that can tame them.
That which I shall speak is incredible, and yet very true. A man is hit most
of all in that place where he is most open, and happily he is therefore ^i^
because he lies open. Dispose thy self therefore in such sort, that thou
may be assured that thou can not be touched, that thou may be
impenitrable: when thou have carried the chariest eye, he will strike thee
through those arms that thou reputest the most assured. Some one will use his
flattery secretly and sparingly, another openly counterfeising the fool in
all men's sight, as if that his simplicity were not cunning. Plancus, who had
been^ one of the cunningest Sicophant^ before Vellius time, said that we ought
not to flatter s^cretly, nor with dissimulation. In vain, says he, is
flattery, if it be obscured. The flatterer gets very much when he is
discovered, and more likewise if he blush after he has been taunted. Think
that thou shall mee^e with a great number of such as Plancus was, and that it
is not^ sufficient remedy against flattery, to refuse to be praised. Crispus
Passienus, whose equal I n^uer know in subtle discovery of all things;
especially in distinguishing and ^uring vices, oftentimes said that we only
put too the door against flatte^ies, but shut them not out, in such sort as we
are wont to put it too against our she friend, which if she thrust it back it
contenteth us, and more grateful is it, if she break it open. I remember that
I have heard the great Philosopher Demetrius say to a certain slave that was
enfranchised, A goodly touch against a fool^sh rub man, and a comedy against
avarice.
and was become very rich, that the shortest way for him to heap up great
wealth, was that day wherein he had repented himself that he had a good
conscience. I will never, says he, envy your practices, but will teach them,
that have need, the means how to escape shipwreck, how to fly from those
contentions that happen between buyers and sellers, not to trust to the
incertaintie of a country life, to retire themselves from the exercise of
less certain pleading; less, in what manner likewise they may not only
easily, but joyfully enrich themselves, and impouerish those that are at their
ease and quiet. I will swear (says he) that thou art higher then Fidus
Annaeus, and Apollonius Picta, although thou have but a mean and crooked
statute, as Fracas had. If I say that thou art the most liberal man amongst
all others, I shall not lie: when as it may seem that thou have given all men
that which thou have left. So is it, my Junior, the more that flattery
discovers it self, the more wicked, impudent, and outrageous it is, the
sooner deceives it. For we are now grown unto that madness, that he that
flattereth us little, seems to be a man of no honesty. I was wont to tell
thee that my brother Gallio (whom no man loved but heartily, The praise of
Gallio, Senecaes brother.
neither loved he any man but entirely) knew not other vices, and likewise
hated this. Thou have tied him every ways. Thou have begun to admire his great
and excellent spirit above all others, which rather wished to be cursed, then
to do any thing worthy shame. But he suddenly retired his foot. Thou beganst
to praise his frugalitie, he cut thee off in the beginning. Thou beganst to
admire his humanity, and unaffected affability which rauisheth those that
hear them in passing by, and greatly oblige those to whom they are addressed.
For there is no man living more agreeable unto another man, then this man unto
all men, whilst in the mean space the power of a natural goodness is such,
that it sauoureth no wa^es of art or simulation. There is no man but will
suffer that a public good should be imputed to him. And in this place likewise
he resisted thy flatteries, in such sort as thou exclaimedst that thou had
found a man that was armed against all attempts, whom every man would
entertain into his bosom. Thou did confess that thou did so much the
more admire his prudence and pertinacie in avoiding inevitable evils, because
thou were in hope that thy words should be entertained with an open ear,
although thou flatteredst, because thou spakest the truth. But so much the
rather learned he to resist them the more. For the truth is always assailed by
those things that have a resemblance of truth. Yet will I not have thee
displeased with thy self, as if thou had done amiss, or as if my brother
presumed that thou pretendedst to jest with him, How we ought to entertain a
flatterer.
or to circumuent him. He discovered thee not, but repulsed thee. Conform thy
self to this example: when as any flatterer comes unto thee; say unto him,
Go I pray thee, and carry these flattering speeches (which are accustomed to
leap from one Magistrate to another, that have these Apes and Sargeants
marching before them) to some one that will pay thee with the like, and takes
pleasure to hear all that which thou would speak unto him. I will deceive
no man, neither can I be deceived. I would be praised by you, if you were not
accustomed to praise the wicked. But what need thou to bring thy self into
that strait, that flatterers should touch thee so nearly? Let them be far
estranged from thee, when thou desire to be praised well. Why should thou
be indebted to any for it? Praise thy self, and say: I have addicted my self
to the study of the Liberal Sciences, How a man ought to prise himself.
although poverty persuaded me to the contrary, and withdrew my thoughts
thither, where my study might return me present gain. I aimed my thoughts at
little profit breeding poesy, and addicted my self to the wholesome study of
Philosophy. I ^^ue showed that every man is capable of virtue, and struggling
through the o^^^^ritie of my birth, and measuring my self not by my condition,
but my mind; I have equalled my self with the greatest. The enmity of
barbarous Caius could not drive me from my sincere intention, Messalus and
Narcissus unhappy conspirators against every man, enemies a long time of the
public weal, before they were foes to their private fortune, could not cross
my resolution. I have hazarded my neck to maintain mine honor, I have not
spoken that word, that was against my conscience. The care I always had, was
for my friends and not for my self, and the fear, that I was not so true a
friend as I should be. I never wept womanish tears, neither after the manner
of a suppliant have I lifted up my hands to any man. I have done nothing that
either was unworthy a man, or a good man. Being greater then mine own perils,
and ready to encounter with those that threatened me, I gave thanks unto Fortune
that would sound me, how highly I prised faith. So great a thing should not
cost me so little. She kept me not long in suspense, for the things that were
in balance were not equal, that is, whether it were better that faith should
perish for me, or I should perish for it. I have not violently thrust my self
into a desperate resolution of death, whereby I might discharge my self from
the fury of mighty men, I saw with Caius torments, I saw fires. I knew in
times past, under him, that humane affairs were brought to that estate, that
it was recounted amongst the works of mercy to be simply slain. Yet thrust I
not my self through with my sword, neither cast I my self headlong into the
sea, to the end that the world might see that I would not die, except it were
to remain faithful. Consider moreover my courage, that could not be corrupted
with bribes, and that in this rude conflict of avarice, I have never soyled my
hands with foul lucre: Moreover, my sobriety, my modesty in words, my
affability toward my inferiors, the reverence I have borne my superiors.
The means to reprove hypocrisy, and to fortify virtue.
Having said all this, ask counsel of thy self if thou have spoken truth, or
told a lie: if truth, Then art thou praised before a great witness: if a lie,
without witness thou have exposed thy self to laughter. But some one might
think, that either I would surprise thee or prove thee: believe which thou will, and begin by me to fear all others. Cast by that verse in Virgil.
Faith is secured in no place. --
And that which Ovid says. Throughout the world ERYNNIS changes round,
As if addressed and sworn with felon rage,
To leave no sin unsought for in this age.
Or that of Menanders (for who has not whetted the greatness of his wit
against this, detesting the conce^t of mankind that tends unto vice?) All,
says he, live otherwise then they should, and the Poet has leaped into the
Scene as if he were a Clown: he excepteth neither old nor young, nor woman,
nor man, and adds that every one without exception does evil, and that
wickedness is grown to the full. We ought therefore to fly, and to return
into our selves, nay more, we are to depart from our selves. Although the sea
separateth us, The sincere love betwixt Seneca and Lucillius.
I will assay to make thee partner of this good, that is, in lending thee my
hand at such time as thou know not what way to take, and making thee to
attain to a place more secured: and lest thou should have a sense of thy
solitude, I will devise with thee from this place as often as I may. We will be
one in that part wherein we are best: we will counsel one another, not
depending upon the presence of him that hears. I will lead thee far from
Sicily, to the end thou shall not yield too much credit to Histories, beginning
to please thy self as often as thou shall say in thy self, I have this
province under my government, which has sustained and broken the armies of the
mightiest Commonweals of the world, when the honor of a long war has
remained for many years in suspense, at such time as she saw the forces of
four Princes gathered together in one place, namely, of all the Empire, having
taken away the prosperity of Pompey, wearied that of Caesar's, translated that
of Lepidus, and surprised all the rest, that was present at the strangest
spectacle that may possibly be thought, whereby all mortal men may learn how
sudden the fall is from high to low, and by how many diverse ways Fortune
causes the power of this world to decline. For at one time she has scene
Pompey and Lepidus cast from their high degree to a lower, but by different
means, considering that Pompey fled before Caesar's army, and Lepidus his own.

CHAP. I.
But to the end I may wholly draw thee from thy self, He enters into
discourse of the increase of Nilus in Summer.
although Sicily has in it and about it many wonders, yet will I not for the
present entermeddle with any questions concerning thy Province, but will draw
thy thoughts another way. For we will now devise together upon that which we
have touched in the former Book, whence it is that Nilus flows and
increases in the Summer months. The Philosophers have left in writing, that
Nilus and Danubius resemble one another, alleging that the source of Danubius
is unknown, and that it is more great in Summer then in Winter. Both the one
and the other appeared to be false: for we find that the head-spring thereof
is in ^ermany, and it begins likewise to increase in Summer, (yet Nilus
always remains in his accustomed measure) that is to say, about the first
heates, at such time as the Sun growing more hot about the end of the spring
time, causes the snowes to melt, which Danubius has consumed, before that
Nilus begins to increase: Danubius decreaseth during the rest of the Summer,
and returns to his greatness in Winter, according to which it is measured.

CHAP. II.
In what time of the Summer this increase is made.
But Nilus increases in the heart of the Summer time after the AEquinoctiall,
before the rising of the Dog-starre. Nature has set this famous flood before
the eyes of all mankind, and has disposed it in such sort that it should
ouerflow Egypt, especially at such time as the earth, being parched by the most
burning heats, should draine out the water from the d^pth, and should draw as
much as the dryness of the whole year required. For in that part which
inclines toward AEthiopia, it raineth not, or if sometimes certain raines
do fall, yet recomfort they not the earth which is unaccustomed to rain
water. Thou know that Egypt has no other hope but in the water of Nilus, by
means whereof the year is either fruitful or barren, according as Nilus has
exceeded her bounds either more or less. There is no labourer in that country
that lifte^h up his eyes unto heaven; wherefore then may I not sport my self
with my Poet, and allege unto him is Ovid, saying, The herbs to IVPITER make
no request
To send them rain from heaven to wet their crest.
If a man could comprehend from whence Nilus begins to increase, The
passages and courses of Nilus.
he should find likewise the causes of the increase thereof: but having run
through the great deserts, it spreads it self into Marshes, whence coming
to disgorge himself into diverse currents that run here and there; first he
begins to assemble them all together about Philus, which is a stony Island,
full of mountains and hard to be landed at in any part, begirt with two Rivers,
which mix themselves in one, and fall into Nilus, whence they take their name.
Nilus more large then violent, round about this place being discharged from
AEthiopia, and running through the sands, that make a way unto those which
traffic in the Indian Seas, The Cataracts of Nilus.
is received into Cataractes a famous place, by reason of the maruailes that
are seen therein. In this place Nilus rayseth it self am^dst high rocks and
such as are hollowed and divided in diverse parts, employing in this place all
her forces. For the stones he meet^th withal break him, in such sort as he
attempteth to escape by the straights. In every place where it finds any
breach or resistance it floateth and gathers together his waters, which he
had carried along without any noise, and passes with violence and vehement
ouerflow through the most difficult passages, being no more like unto himself,
because in these straights it rouleth wholly troubled and muddie. But coming
to beat upon the rocks, it fometh, and at that time the injury of the place,
and not his nature, makes him change color. Afterward, having s^rmounted all
that which hinders him, he falls suddenly and plainly into a marvelous
depth, with such a noise as astonisheth the inhabitants of the country round
about, who having been planted in those places by the Persians, and being
unable to endure the continual thunder that deafened their ears, went and
encamped themselves in places more remote, and better for their rest. Amongst
the wonders of this river, I have heard more tell of the incredible boldness
of those who abide in those quarters. Two men ship themselves in a little
boat, which the one of them guides, and the other emptieth. Having long times
balanced amidst the troubled waves o^ violent Nilus, they go and retire
themselves into some narrow channels, by which they escape the dangerous
passages of the rocks, where leaping into the midst of the stream, they
govern the boat that is turned over them with their hand, and diuing their
heads downward to the great amaze of all the inhabitants that behold and
bewail them with bitter tears, thinking that they are swallowed up in this
gulf of waters, they show themselves again, and appear very far off from
the place where they divided so swiftly, as if they had been pushed forward by
some engines, receiving no other harm by the violent fall of this ^urious
stream, but that it brings them to still water. The first increase of Nilus
is observed about the Isle above mentioned. A little further off it is
separated by the means of a rock, A rock whence first increase of Nilus i^
perceived.
which the Grecians call Abatos, on which no men set foot except it be the
Priests of that place. These stones first of all feel the increase of Nilus.
Far off from this there appear two rocks, which those of the Country name
the veins of Nilus, from whence there issues a great abundance of water, but
not su^^icient to cover Egypt. When any festival day comes, the Priests
cast in their money, and the governors their jewels of gold in that part of
Nilus. The which becoming more mighty in all men's sight, runs by a deep
and large channel, yet not so great as he might well have, if it were not
restrained by the mountains that hem it in on every side. Finally he gets
liberty about Memphis, and having the Champion at his command, In what place
he gets his freedom.
he makes diverse rivers, and enters into channels made by hand running
through all Egypt, in such measure as they could wish, who divert the stream.
From the beginning he deuideth himself into two arms, and then reioyning his
waters, he issues forth after the manner of a Lake or troubled sea. His
violent course relenteth by reason of the extent of the provinces, over which
he is spread, embracing both on the right and the left hand all Egypt. As much
as Nilus increases, so much is there hope of fertility, neither does the
computation deceive the husbandman, it is so answerable to the measure of the
flood, which seems to fatten the sandy and altered earth, upon which he
powers his stream, and discharges his mud al at once: for having his waters
troubled, he leaves the thickest in dry places, and such as are exposed to
heat, afterward he manureth all the desert field with all the fat which he
has brought with him, aiding the territory by his inundation, and by this
glewing and clammy fatness, in such sort as all that which is not watered,
remains barren and desert. Increasing beyond measure he hurts. By this
reckoning behold a ma^uailous flood, which whereas many other small rivers do
but wash and waste the lands, diminishe^h them nothing, but contrariwise
fortifieth them: for by the means of his mudde he fat^eth and binds the
sands: so that Egypt ascribes not only her fertility, but her good territory
also to the same. It is a goodly thing to behold Nilus when it has covered the
champion. The fields are hidden, the valleys are covered, or appear not but in
form of Isles. There is no traffic in the Midland places, except by boats,
and the less the people see of these fields, the more rejoice they. But when
as Nilus contains himself within his bounds, he flows by seven mouths or
channels into the Mediterranean seas, The mouths or chanals of Nilus.
and which of these mouths thou will consider it is but a sea. True it is that
it spreads some other little arms in other shores which have no name.
Besides there are found in this river diverse monsters as huge and cruel as
those in the sea, The Mar^ailes contained in the same.
which may suffice to make it known that it is Nilus. Since he contains such
creatures and feeds them abundantly, and has place large enough to contain.
Balbillus an excellent man, and one of the learnedest in this world, writes,
that at such time as he governed Egypt, with the greatest mouth of Nilus,
called Hereaclioteca, he had this pastime to behold a great troop of
Dolphines coming from the sea, A combat between the Dolphins of the sea, and
Crocodiles of Nilus.
and another troop of Crocodiles coming out of Nilus, as if arranged in
battle to encounter one another, and that the Crocodiles were overcome by the
Dolphins, which are peaceable fish and bite not. The Crocodiles have a
marvelous hard and impenetrable back, so that other creatures that are more
great and dreadful cannot hurt them, but their bellies are soft and tender. It
was in this place that the Dolphins pierced them with the fins, and bristles
they had on their backes^ in such sort as they cut out their bowels, and made
them sink: many were dispatched in this sort, the rest as being put to flight,
returned themselves swiftly against the stream of Nilus. The properties of the
Crocodiles.
The Crocodile has this property, that he flies before these that run after
him, and runs after those that fly him. The Tontentes get the better of
them, not for any privilege of generositie they have above the other
Egyptians, but for their contempt and temeritie. For they willingly hunt the
Crocodile, and cast a snare over them as they fly, by means whereof they draw
them to them: but diverse of these Tontentes that have not sufficient courage to
pursue the Crocodile, resolutely are devoured by them. Theophrastas says, that
the water of Nilus was somewhat salt. For the space of two years under the
reign of Cleopatra, that is to say, in the tenth and the eleventh year Nilus
slowed not, which ^ignified according to the report of the Divines, the change
of the State under the government of two, which were Anthony and Cleopatra,
under whom the Kingdom was reduced into the form of a Province. Calimachus
is the Author that in times past the Nile was nine years without watering
Egypt. But now let us consider the causes of the increase of Nilus in Summer,
The causes of the increase of Nilus in summ^r according to the opinion o^ the
Ancients, which is false.
and let us begin with the most ancient. Anaxagorus says, That the snowes
that are moulten upon the mountains of AEthiopia, run and discharge
themselves in Nilus. All antiquity follows the same opinion. AEschilus,
Sophocles and Euripides have taught no less. But that this is false it
appears by many arguments. First of all, That AEthiopia is a country
extremely hot, it appears by the tawnie color of the inhabitants, and by
the testimony of the Troglotides, who have their houses under earth: the
rocks and stones are as they were on fire, not only at midday, but also in
the evening: the sand is so hot, that a man cannot walk upon it, the silver
waxes lead, the soder or joining of the images dissolues, there is no
couerture of any enriched matter that can endure. The Southerly wind that
comes from that country is extremely hot. Those beasts that hide themselves
in the winter, live continually abroad. In the time of least heat, the Serpents
creep abroad. In Alexandria likewise, far distant from these excessive
heats, it snoweth not, neither falls there any rain on the highest places.
How can it then be, that a country that is exposed to so great heats of the
Sun, there should any snowes fall all the Winter time? Truly there should
some other mountains be covered therewith, and namely those of Thrace and
Caucasus. But those Rivers that stream along from the mountains, swell about
the spring time, and upon the beginning of Summer, and afterward decrease in
Winter. For in the Spring time the snowes are melted, and about the first days
of the summer the Sun dissipateth the rest. The Rhine, the Rhos^e, Danubius
and Caystre, are small in winter, but great in summer: The Northern mountains
are charged with very much snow. The River Phasis that runs in those
quarters should increase then, if toward the summer time the swowes could make
the Rivers swell. Furthermore, if such were the cause of the increase of Nile,
it should be very great in the beginning of summer, because at that time, the
snowes are at that time entire in great heaps. But Nilus flows as proudly
for four months space, always in the same estate, if thou will believe
Thales, The opinion of Thales, as touching the incurse of Nilus.
the Etesian winds resist Nilus in his descent, and bridle his courses,
thrusting the sea against the entrances of his channels, by means of which
repulse he flows back again and increases not, but because he cannot have
further passage, he swells and ouerfloweth in every place where he may make
his way. Enthymenes of Marscillus accords hereunto, Euthymenes opinion.
saying, I have sailed in the Atlantique sea, thence flows Nilus more
greater, as long as the Etesians blow, for then the sea being pressed by these
winds repulseth them against their stream. When such winds cease the sea
waxes calm, and Nilus that returns back has less force. The examination
of these opinions.
Then is the seawater sweet, and the monsters in the same resemble those of
Nilus. Why therefore? If the Etesians make Nilus to swell, why does the
increase thereof begin, before these winds rise, and continue after they are
laid? Whence likewise comes it to pass, that it is not more great at such
time as they blow more rudely. For he neither rises nor falls, whether they
blow more or less, which would come to pass if he increased by their forces.
Furthermore, the Etesian winds beat upon the shoares of Egypt, and Nilus
streameth against them, contrariwise he would issue from the places whence they
came, if he took his original from them. Besides, he would flow from the sea
pure and blew, not troubled and dirtie, as he does at that present. Besides
infinite testimonies speak wholly to the contrary of this opinion. Then was
there place for falsehood to prevail, when the coasts were unknown. It was
lawful for them that spoke to publish their fables. But at this day all the
coast of the sea is frequented by their ships who traffique^ none of which say,
that the water of Nilus is blew, or that the sea has any other taste then it
has usually, which likewise Nature forbids to be believed. For the Sun
draws that which is most light, and sweet. Besides, why increases it not in
winter? Since at that time the winds being more violent then they were
accustomed might move the sea? For the Etesians are moderate. Furthermore, if
he were derived from the Atlantique sea, he would at one time fill all Egypt.
But he increases by degrees. The Philosopher Oenopides of Chios says, that in
winter the heat is hidden under earth, by means whereof the dens are hot, and
the fountain water is warm, by means whereof the veins of the earth are
dried by internal heat. But in other countries the floods increase by the
means of rain. An answer to Oenopides opinion.
But the Nile, because he is not assisted by any other rain he waxes the
less, and then increases in summer, at such time as the inward parts of the
earth are cold, and the fountains are fresh and cool. But if this were true,
the rivers should increase, and all the fountains should be full in summer. I
say likewise that in summer time the heat is not greater under earth. The
water, the lower caves, and the fountains are warm, because they receive not
the air that is cold without, so then they have no heat, but they drive out
cold. From the same cause proceeds this, that they are fresh in summer,
because the air being remote and severed from the same, The examination of
Diogenes Apolloniates his opinion.
and afterward warmed, attaineth not so far. Diogenes Apollinaris is of that
opinion, that the Sun draws humiditie unto him, which is sucked up from the
sea, and other waters by the dry land, that it cannot be that one earth should
be dry, and another moist, because all is perforated and full of passages.
Those things that are drier do sometimes borrow from the moister, and if the
earth received not from other parts, long since had it fallen to dust. So then
the Sun draws the waves, but the meridianall regions are those that have
most need: when the earth is dried, she draws more humiditie unto her. Even
as in lamps, the oil runs thither where it consumes, so the water runs
into that part, where the vehemency of heat and of the parched earth calls
it. Whence then is she drawn? From those parts that are always cold, that is,
from the Northern parts whence she flows. For this cause the Pontique sea
powers her stream continually into that which is the lower, not by ebbes and
floods after the manner of other seas, but tending and running always
violently toward that part. If this were not, if that which every one wants
were not supplied, and that which were excessive were not sent back again by
the same ways, the earth should peece-meale be brought to dust, or drowned in
the water. I would willingly demand of Diogenes, An instance that wrappeth
Diogenes in new absurdities.
since that this sea and the rivers join themselves together: Whence it
comes to pass, that the rivers in all countries are not more big in summer
time: The Sun scorcheth Egypt more then all other regions, and therefore
Nilus increases the more: But in other countries likewise there is some
increase of rivers? Furthermore, how comes it to pass that some places are
wholly dry, since that all the earth draws unto her the humiditie of other
countries, and so the more the dry earth shall be exposed to the Sun.
Finally, whence comes it that Nilus is sweet, if his water flows from the
sea? For there is no river more sweet in taste then Nilus is.

CHAP. III.
How the hail is made.
IF I should maintain that hail is made as ice is, the whole cloud being
frozen, I should undertake a thing that were ouer-headie. Therefore number me
amongst those witnesses of the second note, who deny that they have seen, but
auow that they have heard it. Or at leastwise I will do that which the
Historians do. For they when they have fained many things according to their
own fancy, will not maintain any one thing of consequence^ but add these
words, I refer my self to the credit of the Authors. Possidonius will answer
for me, Possidonius o^inion.
as well in that which I have already entreated of, as in that which follows.
For he will affirm that the hail is made of a rainy cloud converted into
water, as boldly as if he had been present at the making. But why hail is
round, thou thy self may know without a master, when as thou shall observe,
that every thing that droppeth gathers it self into a round, which likewise
appears in glasses, which gather a kind of dew from our breath, and in pots
that are powered o^t, and in every other light thing, as in the leaves of herbs
and trees, if any drop cleave unto them, they are always round. What is more
hard then stone? more soft then water,
Yet hardest stones by softest drops are pierced.
Or as another Poet says: The drops that fall do pierce the stone.
And this hollownesse is round also, whence it appears that the water has
some resemblance with the stone that it holloweth, for it makes a hole in the
same, that is answerable to her form and habitude. Furthermore, although the
hail were not such, yet in falling it might grow round, and tumbling so long
through a thick air, take an equal form on every side, which the snow cannot
do; The difference between snow and hail.
because it is not so solid, but is rather spread abroad, and falls not from
any great height, but takes his original from the lower region of the air,
so that it comes not from an air far distant, but falls from a place
near at hand. Why may not I give my self as much liberty as Anaxagoras did,
whereas free liberty should be amongst no men more then amongst Philosophers?
Hail is naught else but suspended ye. The snow is a sort of congelation
hanging in the frost. There is such a difference betwixt frost and ice, and
snow and ice, as between water and dew.

CHAP. IIII.
ANd having resolved this question, Why it snoweth, but haileth not in winter.
I might dismiss and repose my self, but I will give thee full measure, since
I have begun to be troublesome unto thee, I will relate whatsoever it be, that
may grow in question upon this matter. The question is then why it snoweth in
winter, and haileth not, and after that the cold has been broken by a milder
weather, the hail falls? Although thou think that I am deceived, yet
account I it for true, which I apprehend in my mind, which permits it self
to believe these trifling tales, wherein men are accustomed to nip our tongues,
and not to pull out our eyes. In winter the air freeseth, by means whereof it
resolves not himself into water, but into snow, to which the air is more
nearer. In the beginning of the Spring there follows a great change of
weather, and the air being become more warm, there succeed more greater
rain. Upon which occasion our Poet Virgil says, When as showre-bearing spring,
Discovers it self, the change of the air being opened, and resolved every
ways by the assistance of the season, is far more vehement. For this cause
the raynes fall more weighty and thick, but they continue not. The Winter
has lent, and thick showers, which we see oftentimes happen when the snow
falls amidst a rare and thin rain. We say that it is a snowie day when it is
cold and the heaven is covered: contrariwise, when the Northeast wind blows
and governs in the air, the raines are more small; but when the Southern
wind rayneth the rain is more strong, and the drops greater.

CHAP. V.
The ^pinion of the Po^t upon this point.
THat which is resolved by our Stoiques, neither dare I speak because it is but
weakly grounded, neither must I let it pass. For what evil is it to write
any thing that is presented unto us? For if we will exactly examine, and make a
diligent scrutiny of all things, it were better to be silent, since there is
scarcely any thing that is maintained by the one, that is not impugned by the
other. For there are very few things without contradiction. They say therefore
that all that which is frozen about Scithia and Pontus, and to the Northward,
dissolueth in the spring time: that at that time the Rivers thaw, and that the
snowes wherewith the mountains are covered, melt; by means whereof it is very
like, that the colder winds engender such a change, and intermixe themselves
with the air of the spring time. They further add that which I have not yet
tried, nor have the will to do the same; and I counsel thee that if thou will
know the truth thereof, not to make trial in this sort if the snow be cold.
Mark what they say, that they that tread upon the firm and hard snow have not
so much cold in their feet, as those that tread upon the snow that is newly
fallen. If they speak true, all that which comes from the Northerly places
(when as the snow is distributed, and the ice is broken) tieth and constrains
the warm and moist air of the Southern parts: and therefore when it should
rain the vehemency of the cold will make it fall into hail.

CHAP. VI.
O^ those that for^tell wh^^ it shall haite.
I Cannot temper my self, but that I must needs discover all the follies of
our Stoickes, who affirm that there are some men so well experienced in the
observations of clouds, that they can foretell when it shall hail, having the
means to comprehend the same, by long use, by observing the color of the
clouds, after which hail has followed so many times. It is an incredible
matter that in the City of Cleone there were certain men chosen to this end
upon the common purse, which were named (...), that is to say, obseruers of the
hail. When these had given the sign that hail would suddenly follow, what
expectest thou, that men should run to their clokes, or their letherne
peltches? Nay rather, every one sacrificed for himself a Lamb or a Pullet;
and forthwith those clouds declined another way, after he had tasted some
little of the blood: Do thou laugh at this? Behold cause of more laughter;
if ther^ were any that had neither Lamb nor Pullet, he drew his own blood,
wherein he neither hurt himself nor any other man. And to the end that thou
should not think that the clouds are cru^ll and desirous of blood, one of
them with a sharp p^n-knife pricked one of his fingers, and offered his blood:
at that the hail fled away from his field that had sacrificed thus, as from
those pastures whose Master had the means by more greater offerings to prevent
the eminent evil.

CHAP. VII.
SOme seek a reason hereof. Whether th^re be any reason in this pr^dicti^^.
Othersome that are more wise say, that it is impossible to covenant with the
hail, and to redeem the tempests by their diminutiue presents, although the
gods are pacified by such means. Some there are, that hold that they of
Cleones thought, that there was some secret virtue in blood, to turn away and
repulse the cloud. But how may so great power be enclosed in so little blood
as to mount so high, and to cause a resentment in the clouds. The shortest way,
was to say that all that was no other thing but a fable, and a lie: yet they of
Cleones punished those that had not the care to foresee and provide against
tempests, because by their negligence their Vineyards were beaten, or their
cornelayed. And amongst us, in the law of the twelve tables it was for^bidden,
that no man should enchant another man's fruit. The ancient Id^ots and those
of little judgment, believed that the inchanters caused the raines either to
fail or fall; but it is a thing most evident, that they cannot do it, yea,
and so manifest, that the cause hereof is not to be examined in any
Philosophers School.

CHAP. VIII.
YEt one thing will I add more, and it will content thee to favor and
applaude it. In what region of the air the snow is made.
They say that snow is made in that Region of the air that is nearest unto the
earth, and that has most heat, for three causes: the first is, that every
exhalation of the earth, whereas it has much heat and dry within, it is so
much the more hotter the nearer it is: the second, that the beams of the Sun
reflect upon the ^arth, and reuerberate back to themselves; the which
redoubling warms all that which is neere^t to the earth, the which has more
warmth, because they feel the Sun twice: the third cause is, that the higher
parts are more beaten by the winds, but whatsoever are lowest are less beaten
by the winds.

CHAP. IX.
TO these may a man add the reason of Democritus: Democritus reason annexed to
the preceden^.
the more solid a body is, the more suddenly receives it heat, and keeps it
the longer. Therefore if you set a vessel of brass, or glass, or silu^, in
the Sun, that of brass is warmed soonest, and keeps the heat longest. He
expresses the reason in this sort: It must needs be that the pores and
passages of those bodies that are closed, solid and thick should be more less
then the rest, and that the air that enters should be far more subtle. It
follows then, that as the Sto^es that are less spacious, and the smallest.
Ouens are soone^t hot; so the pores and pa^sages that are hidden, and cannot be
observed by the eye, do more speedily entertain the heat, and because they
are so narrow, deliver over this heat more slowly then they have received it.

CHAP. X.
The l^west Region of the air is more darkesome and l^sse pure.
THese long Prefaces bring us to the point that is now in question^ All air is
more thick, according as it is more near unto the earth^ As in the water, and
in all humiditie, the lees are found in the bottom; so in the air, those
things that are most thick are always lowest. But we have already proved
that all things, the more their matter is thick and solid, the more long time
and more effectually keep they the heat they have received: but the more the
air is raised and estranged from the ordures of the earth, the more pure and
neat it is; by means whereof it retains not the Sun, but lets it pass
as through a void place, and therefore is it that it warmeth less.

CHAP. XI.
Why the tops of the highest mountains have less sense of the heat of the Sun
then the valleys.
COntrariwise, some say that the tops of the mountains, being near unto the
Sun, should be also more ho^. But in my opinion they deceive themselves in
this, that they think that the Apenine, the Alps, and other renowned
mountains, by reason of their height have their heads so high, that their tops
may feel the neighborhood of the Sun: undoubtedly these mountains are
high, if a man compare them with us that are men; but when thou shall consider
the whole Universe, every one may perceive that both mountains and men ar^
things very base. The one compared with the other have the upper hand, and
together they are nothing. Neither is ther^ any thing, how high soever it be
raised, that in comparison with the whole should be esteemed any thing; and if
it were otherwise, we would not say, that all this circuit of the earth is but
a bowl. The properties of a bowl is to be round in all equalit^e. Consider
this equality in a ball; the s^itches, the corners and little holes that
appear therein, hinder not a man from s^ying that all the parts are round. But
as these spaces hinder not this ball to have a round figure, so in all the
globe of the earth in the highest mountains (whose tops are nothing if they be
compared with the whole round) the same ought to be considered. He that says
that the highest mountain, because it is nearest to the Sun, should be more
warmed, may say also that a great man should have more heat then a little man,
and that heat ought to be rather in the head then in the feet. But whosoever
has considered the world according to his measure, and r^membreth him self
that the earth is the center or point of this great circumference, shall know
that nothing may be so ^^gh in the same, that by that mean^s it may hau^ more
sense of the ^ffect of the Sun, and of those other celestial fir^s, as if he
were more nearer unto them. These mountains that we behold, and these high
Tenari^es that are covered with perpetual snowe^ are notwithstanding in the
bottom. True it is, that a mount which is raised high is nearer the Sun then
a valley, but in such sort is it, as one thing is greater then another: for
after this manner one (...) is said to be nearer heaven then another; which is
false, because between those things that are little there cannot be any great
difference, but whilst they are compared one with another. When we come to the
comparison of a mighty body, it skils not how much the one is greater then the
other, because although it be with a great difference, yet are they called
small.

CHAP. XII.
But to return, Why the s^^w is soft.
by reason of the reason^ above mentioned, diverse have bin o^ the opinion, that
snow is made in the low^st region of the air, by means whereof it is sof^,
because it i^ gathered of a cold that is less rigorous then that of other
regions. The neighboring air has too much cold to convert it self into
water and rain, and over little to be hardn^d into hail. Of thi^ moderate
cold, and not too much intended are the snowes mad^ by the means of thick
waters.

CHAP. XIII.
WHy, Of the res^lution of this question: ^e en^ereth into censure against the
Epicures of this world, who abuse snow.
say thou, do thou prosecute so earnestly these follies, whereby thou shall
neither become more l^arned, nor more b^tter? Thou tellest me how snowes are
made, where it concerns thee far more to let us understand why snowes are not
to be bought. Thou willest me to plead against dissolution: this is a daily
and a fruitless brawle; yet let us chide at it: although she be like to get
the upper hand, yet let her overcome us fighting and striving against her. What
then? Think thou that this inspection of nature avails nothing to that
which thou intendest? When we ask how snow is made, and say that by nature it
is like unto frost, that it contains in it self more ayr^ then water;
think thou not that they are reproached hereby, because they buy not true
water, but a far more baser thing? But let us rather inquire how snowes are
made, then how they are kept, because not contenting our selves to pour out
our old wine^, and to dispose them according to their savors and age, we have
found out the invention how to keep snow, and to the end it might overcome
Summer, and defense it self against the heat of the year, by the coldness of
the place, what have we attained by this diligence? Forsooth this, to buy water
that costeth us nothing. It grieueth us that we cannot buy the wind and the
Sun; or for that the air comes so easily to present himself to a rich and
more delicate sort, who could be contented to buy the same. O how impatiently
endure we that nature, the mother of all has left nothing common to all. This
which she would have flow and lie open to all men; this which she has made
public, to the end that all men might drink thereof to entertain life, that
which she has largely and happily dispensed for all, to serve the common use
of men, of savage beasts, of birds and all other living creatures, that are the
most idle, that has d^^^solution (ingenuous in her own mischief) drawn unto
a price; so is noth^^^ pleasing unto her except it cost dear. This was the
only thing that equalled the rich with the common sort, in which only they
could not exceed the poorest. For him was this devised (whose riches are
troublesome to himself) to feed his dissolution even in water. I will tell you
whence it came to pass that no running water seemed cold enough for us. As
long as the stomach is sound and capable of convenient nourishment, and is
filled but not ouerpressed, it is content with natural supplies, it feels
not the heat of the time, but his inward distemper; when as continual
drunkenness encampeth in his bowels, and the noble parts are inflamed by a
choleric humor that seizes the stomach, men seek necessarily for somewhat
that may temper that heat which waxes more violently by those waters that are
poured on it, and the remedy increases the sickness. And therefore not in
Summer only, but in the depth of winter they drink water for this cause. What
is the cause hereof but an evil (...) intrailes rotted and spoiled by excess,
to which no intermission has bin granted, to concoct and digest that which
they had th^ust into them; but some have heaped on their dinners those nightly
banquets, which have lasted till the next day morning, gourmandize and
drunkenness plunging as it were into a gulf, men's stomachs charged with
abundance and diversities of wines and meats. Besides this, intemperance that
has no intermission, having greedily devoured all that which was presented
unto him, becomes mad, and inflameth it self always in a new desire to follow
his train. Although therefore they garnish their chambers with Tapestrie and
other ornaments, and with huge fires conquer the vehemence of the cold, yet
notwithstanding their stomachs cloyed and weakened by their proper heat,
seeks some sollace to refresh themselves. For ^uen as we cast cold water
upon their faces that faint and are in a ^wound, to the end we may revive them,
A pleasant and fit comparison, to show the miseries of the dissolute.
so the entrails of these dissolute men, wholly stupefied with so much
excess, feel nothing, except you awake them with these extreme cold
drinks. Hence comes it that they content not themselves with snow, but
steep their ice in store of fresh water, as if the thickenesse thereof gave
them some more certain refreshing. And this ye is not taken from that which
grows above, but to the end it may have more force, and a more vehement
cold, they draw it and dig it out of the deeper places. Therefore is it,
that these delicacies have more prises then one, and there is traffic both of
water and ice, according to the diversities of the seasons of the year, to the
great dishonor of the buyers and the sellers. The Lacedaemonians banished
Perfumers out of their City, and commanded them suddenly to depart out of
their confines, because they wasted their oil. What would they have done if
they had seen the shops and storehouses for snow, and so many horses
appointed to carry water, whose color and savor they alter by the means of
the straw wherein they keep it? But good gods, how easy a thing is it to
extinguish wholesome thirst? But what can dull and dead jaws, stupefied with
burning meats, feel? Even as nothing is cold enough for them, A lively
description of bellygods, and how great was Senecaes admired hatred against all
excess.
so nothing is hot enough: but they thrust down the scalding morsels, speedily
drowned in their sauce, half smoking into their stomachs, to the end they may
extinguish them with snowie potions. Thou shall see certain lean fellows,
armed against the cold up to the chin, pale and ill disposed, that not only
swallow down, but also eat snow, casting great morsels of the same into their
cups, fearing least in forbearing their drink a little, it should wax warm.
Think thou that this is thirst? It is a feuor, yea, so malignant that it
(...) neither discovered in touching the pulse, nor by the color that
appears in the face. But intemperance an invincible evil, of soft and fluid
becoming hard and stupid burns the heart it self. Know thou not that all
things loose their force by custom? Therefore this snow, in which at this day
you that are delicate, are as it were plunged, by use and continual servitude
of the stomach has gotten this privilege, that it obtains the place of
water. Seek out now some other thing that is more cold, for an ordinary and
accustomed freshness and coolness is as much to you as nothing.

and Aristotle's opinion in 2. Meteorolog. wherein he highly taxes the
definition: bu^ Seneca in this place first defines what ^inde i^.
Some have defined it thus: The wind is an air which is fluent in one part.
This definition seems to be more exact, because the air is never so
immovable, but that in some sort it is agitated. So say we that the Sea is
calm, when it is but gently moved, and inclines not overmuch to one part.
When therefore thou read, When as the Sea was calm vnbet by windes^
Know that it is never so still but that it has some slight replying, and is
said to be calm, because it forces not a stream neither this way, nor that
way. The same may a man judge of the air, that it is never immovable although
it be quiet and calm. Which thou may conceive by this: When the sun is
infused into any closed place, we see certain little bodies carried now a
thwart, some upward, some downward, and diversely encountering together. He
shall therefore scarce diligently enough comprehend that he would, that says:
The flood is the agitation of the Sea, because when it is calmest it is stirred
likewise. But beyond exception shall he be that shall define it thus. The flood
is the agitation of the Sea into one part. So in this thing also, whereof we
most of all now debate, he shall not be excepted against, that carries
himself so as he says: The wind is a fluent air into one part, or the
wind is fluent air with violence; or the force of the air that fleeteth into
one part, or a course of the air a little more vehement then ordinary. I know
what may be answered for that other definition, what need thou to add
this, air flowing into one part? For whatsoever fl^^teth, into some part. No
man will say that the water flows, if it be only moved in it self, but if it
tends toward some part. There may be therefore somewhat that may move and not
flow, but contrariwise it cannot flow except i^ be into one part. But if this
breuiti^ b^ sufficient to defend us from r^proo^e, let us use this. But if any
man be more circumspect, let him not spare his word, by whose adiection he may
exclude all cavil. Let us now come to the matter it self, because we have
sufficiently disputed of the form.

CHAP. II.
DEMOCRITVS says, that when there are many of these small bodies, Whereof
wind is composed.
which he calls Atomi, in some void straight, there follows wind:
contrariwise that the estate of the air is calm and peaceable, when in much
void there are few Atoms. For even as in the market place or street, as long
as there is but little company, a man may walk without tumult: but when as
company meets in a straight, there grows quarrel, because they throng and
iustle one another: so in this space wherein we are environed, when many bodies
have filled a small place, it must needs be that in incountring one with
another: the one should be pushed by the other, which push them back again,
and that they should be confused together, and compresse one another. From
thence comes wind, when as those two bodies that were at debate are fallen
down, and after they have long time floted and remained in suspense, incline
themselves. But where there are few bodies in a great exstent, neither can they
iustle one another, nor be impelled the one by the other.

CHAP. III.
Refutation of Democritus argument in the former Chapter.
HOw false this opinion is, thou may gather hereby, because that when the sky
is cloudie and the air is thick, there is no wind stirring. But at that time
diverse bodies are assembled together, whence proceeds also the thickness of
the clouds. Add hereunto that about Rivers and Lakes fogs fall very
oftentimes, bodies being pressed and conjoined together, and yet there is no
wind. And sometimes so great a mist is spread abroad, that scarce one man can
see another, though they stand near together, which should not come to pass
except many bodies had enclosed themselves in a little space. But no time
wants wind more then that which is foggie. Add hereunto now that which
falls out on the contrary side, that the rising sun ordinarily attenuateth
the thick and moist air upon his rise. And then does the wind rise when as
the bodies are set at liberty, and that their press and multitude is resolved.

CHAP. IIII.
NOw therefore how saye^t thou, Wind is made in diverse sorts.
are the winds made, since thou c^nfessest that they are made? not after one
manner: for sometimes the earth pusheth out of her caves a great abundance of
air, oftimes when a great and continual ^xhalation drives up on high, that
which she had depr^ss^^, this change of intermixed^ air is turned into wind^
for this neither can I b^^ pe^^waded to believe, nor to conceal, which some
men do hold, that ^s by the meane^ of our meat, wind is caused in our bodies,
which cannot burst ^o^th, except it be by viole^^ (...)^ or like wise sometimes
by d^scharg^ of the belly with some noice, or making ^n escape which is not
heard: (...) ^his spaciou^ nature that maintains all things, in changing
nature produces winds. It is good for us that she disgesteth always,
otherwise we might fear some stink or or more vncle^nnesse. Is there not
therefore mo^e app^^ance to ^ay, that from all the parts of the earth, there
necessarily arrive a g^^at numbe^ of these Atoms, which heaped together, and
afterward attennated by the same, it happens that the wind is made, because
that all that which enlarges it self in a narrow place, requires a greater
space?

CHAP. V.
WHat then? think thou that the ^uaporations of the waters and earth are the
only cause of the wind? The air has in it self a natural faculty of motion.
That the gravity of the air is caused by these, and afterward resolved by
violence when these things that stood thick, as i^ is needful by being
extenuated, strive to get a greater space? For mine own part I judge it to be
so. But that is the more truer and firmer cause, is that the air has a
natural force of moving her self, which she has of her self, as other
things have without having any need of conceiving it from an other. Think
thou that the force of motion has been given us, and that the ay^^ ha^h been
condemned to remain idle, and without agitation, considering tha^ ^he water
cease not to have her motion, although the winds be calm, for otherwise
she could not breed fishes. We see likewise that Moss and other herbs grow
in the waters, and float above them.

CHAP. VI.
THere is somewhat therefore vital in the water. Speak I it only of the
water^ It has something vital in it self.
The fire that consumes all things, creates likewise somethings, and that
which cannot seem^ to b^e true^ and yet is very true) there are certain living
creatures that are engendered in the fire. The air likewise has some such like
virtue, and therefore sometimes it thickneth, sometimes it spreads and pureth
it self, sometimes it cloaseth, it opens, and restrains it self. There is
herefore such difference betwixt the air and the wind, as there is betwixt a
Lake and a River. Sometimes the sun it self is the cause of wind, sometimes
melting the cold air, and finding it thick and closed in it self, purifieth
and dilateth it.

CHAP. VII.
When and from whense the winds proceed.
WE have spoken of the winds in general, now let us begin to entreat of them
severally. It will happily appear how they are made, if it shall appear when
and whence they proceed, First therefore let us examine th^se winds that rise
before day, which either are raised from some rivers, or valleys, or gulfes.
There is none of them continues, but falls when the sun is mounted
somewhat high, neither is carried above the sight of the earth. This kind of
winds begins in the Spring time, and passes not the Summer. And from
thence most of all comes it, where there are many waters and mountains. The
Champions although they abound with waters, yet say I, that they want this
breath which stands in stead of wind.

CHAP. VIII.
HOw then is that wind bred which the Grecians call (...), what soever the
rivers and marshes cast out of themselves, Whence strong winds are caused.
(the which is much and continual) is in the day time the nutriment of the
sun, by night it is not spent, but being united in the mountains, is gathered
into one region; when it has filled the same, and being unable to contain it
self in it self, it breaks forth, and goes into an other part, and hence
comes the wind. It inclines therefore toward that part, which inuiteth it
with more free passage, and through the spaciousnes of the place, into which
being gathered together it may run. The proof hereof is, that it rises not
before midnight: for this collection begins to be made a little before day,
and being as it were accomplished at such time as the light appears, it
seeks to discharge it self of the weight, and thither especially tends,
where there is most air, and a great and spacious extent. The sun likewise
at his rise reflecting upon the cold air, in some sort adds forwardness to
it: for even before he appears, he prevails by his light, although his
beams do not dissipate the air, yet provoke he it, and stirs by
sending his light before: for when he himself appears, the one are raised up
into the air, the other are dissipated by little and little, in such sort as
they are not permitted to blow, except in the morning, their vigor vanisherh
under the force of the Sun. And if they be strong about the morning, about
midday they wax weak, and these small winds never pass midday. There are
some likewise that are very feeble, and more short, according as their causes
are more or less powerful.

CHAP. IX.
But why are these winds more violent in the springtime, Whence it comes
that such a wind is more violent in the Spring and Summer.
and in the summer? for in the two other seasons they are very mild and
scarsely fill the sails of ships; because the spring is moister, and a
greater euaporation is made from diverse waters and places, that by reason of
the moist nature of the heavens are full and over charged. But why is it that
these vapors are so great in the summer time? because such daily heat
continues after the setting of the sun, and continues for the greater part
of the night, and draws to it self that which is without, and attracteth
with violence all that which the earth is accustomed to render of it self, but
it has not sufficient force to consume and dissipate that which it has
drawn: for this cause, the earth and water push out these little Atoms which
are accustomed almost ordinarily to issue out, not only by heat, but also by
the reuerberation of his beams, the Sun is the efficient cause of the winds:
for the light that forgoeth the rising of the Sun does not as yet warm the
air, but only reflecteth upon it, which being stricken upon, retireth it
self on the one side; although I auerre not that this light is without heat,
considering that it is made of heat. It may be it has not so much heat,
that it may actually apppeare, yet notwithstanding it performs his dewty by
deducing and attenuating these things that are thick. Besides those places,
which by some iniquity of nature are so closed, that they cannot entertain the
sun, are notwithstanding lightened by a dry and heavy light, and are less
cold by day then by night. By nature likewise every heat dries and
disperseth away from it all clouds. If the wind blows from the place whence
the Sun departs.
It follows therefore, that the sun does the like. For which cause some are
of the opinion, that the wind blows from thence whence the sun parts.
But that this is false, it appears hereby because the wind drives ships
into diverse climates, and such as travel by sea with full sail, sail against
the sun rise, which should not come to pass, if the wind were always
carried by the sun.

CHAP. X.
THe Etesian winds likewise (which are alleged by some in way of proof)
serve them little for their purpose. Why the winds that are called Eteseans
blow not but in summer, and during the number of certain days.
I will first declare what their opinion is, and afterward why it disliketh
me. The Etesians (say they) blow not in the winter, because in the shorter
days the sun is sooner set before the cold be overcome, and therefore the
snowes both fall and are hardened. In the summer time they begin to blow,
because the days are longer, and the beams of the Sun directly beat upon
us. It is therefore like to be true, that the clouds being shaken with great
heat, push forth humidity, and that the earth (discovered and discharged of the
snow) produces the vapors more freely; whence issue more impressions in the
air to the Northward, then otherwise, which are carried into places more sweet
and temperate: so do the Etesians enforce themselves, and therefore is it that
they begin in the Solstice, being unable to endure the rising of the
Dogge-starre, because that already the colder part of the heaven has powered
much of his humor into the same. But the Sun having changed his course,
draws more directly toward us, inuiting one part of the air, and repulsing
the other. Thus the gale of these Etesians breaks the forces of Summer, and
defends it from the violence of the hotest months.

CHAP. XI.
If the Etesians and other winds are stirred by the sun.
NOw will I perform that which I promised, why the Etesians help them no
ways, neither yield any confirmation to this cause; we have said that about
the spring of the day, there arises a little wind, which is laid as soon as
the Sun meets with it. And therefore is it why the Mariners call the
Etesians idle and delicate, because they know not how to rise early as Gallion
says. They begin the most times to blow when that little mornings breath
begins to calm, which would not come to pass if the Sun were the stirrer
of them as he is of the lesser winds. Furthermore, if the length and greatness
of the day were the cause that they blew, they should be heard before the
Solstice at such time as the days are long, and the snowes are melted; for in
the month of July all the earth is discovered, or at leastwise there are very
few things that lie under the snow.

CHAP. XII.
THere are some sorts of winds which the clouds that are broken, and fall, Of
the winds called Ecnephy and h^w they are made.
push before them; these winds do the Grecians call (...) which in my opinion
are made after this manner. When as a great in^quality and diversity o^ bodies
which are cast forth by terrestrial vapors, mount on high, and that the one
of these bodies are dry, and the other moist. It is to be believed, that from
so great a contrariety of bodies that incessantly strive one against an other
at such time as they are assembled, there should certain hollow clouds be
composed. and that there is between them some distances, full of narrow holes,
such as are in flutes: In these distances there is a subtle and thin air,
that incloseth it self, which being tossed up and down therein, and in the end
warmed by a constrained and int^rrupted course, becomes hereby more strong;
and seeking for a place more large, breaks all that which incloseth it, and
issues like a wind, which for the most part is stormy, because it comes from
above, and falls upon us with a great violence, because it cannot spread it
self every ways, but contrariwise trauelleth very much to find an issue,
enforcing his way before him, and as it were by a violent combat. Ordinarily
this wind endures not long, because it breaks the recep^acles of those
clouds wherein it was carried: sometime it issues with a great noise, but not
without thunder and lightning. Such winds are of more vehemence and longer
continuance, if they carry with them other violent winds intermixed with them,
and such as issue from the same way, and strive to unite themselves with them:
even as torrents flow in a measurable greatness, as long as every one ha^h his
particular course, but when as diverse of them meet together in one, they
surpass in depth, breadth and swiftness the greatest rivers that flow
incessantly. The same way in all likelihood fall out in storms, which of
themselves continue not long time, but when they have ^ssembled their force^,
and when as from diverse parts of the heaven, the air being pressed, assembleth
it self in one place, they both gather more forces, and continue longer.

CHAP. XIII.
SO then a resolved cloud makes the wind which is dissolved in diverse sorts.
The manner how the winds break from the clouds that enclose the^.
Sometimes the air which is enclosed, searching to find a vent, strugleth in
such sort that it breaks all that collection of clouds that detaineth it,
sometimes the heat that has been occasioned by the sun, sometimes the
intershocke of clouds, as it happens when two great bodies encounter and crush
one another. In this place it may be demanded (if thou think it fit) whence
that storm is raised? which is accustomed to happen in rivers, which fleeting
onward without interruption seem peaceable and mild, and make no noise: but
when they encounter with any rock on this or that side of the river, they
rec^yle and turn their waters into round circles which cannot be divided; so
that in whirling about they suck up themselves, and make a gulf: so the wind
as long as nothing resists it, extends his forces: but when it is beaten
back by any promontory, or if by constraint of the places it be gathered into
some str^ight and crooked pypes, it oftimes turns and returns itself into
it self, and makes a gulf like unto those waters, which as I said, are
converted and whirled about. This wind turning it self, and enuironing one and
the same place, and moving it self violently in diverse circles and rounds, is
a whirlewind, which if it grow more strong and furious is inkindled, and makes
that flying fire, which the Grecians call (...). This is a fiery storm. These
winds for the most part being broken from the clouds discover all dangers,
whereby whole herdes of beasts are carried away in the fields, and whole
ships are tossed and drowned in the floudes. Some winds also engender diverse
others, and pushing the air into some other places, then those whereupon they
were formerly cast, spread themselves here and there. I will tell you likewise
that which is come into my memory; even as the drops of rain in the
beginning make not the earth slippery, but when they are gathered together, and
reinforced, then is it said that they flow and fall: in like case, as long as
the motions of the air are light and agitated in diverse places, it is not
wind as yet it begins to be when he has mingled all his motions together,
and has made a mighty body. It is the measure that puts a difference
betwixt the air and the wind, for the wind is a more vehement breath, and the
spirit likewise a lightly flowing air.

CHAP. XIIII.
I Will repeat now that which I said at the first, That there are winds
likewise which break from the caves and hollow places of ^he earth.
that the winds issue from caves and hollow places of the earth. The earth is
not made and fashioned of one whole massiue piece from the top unto the
bottom, but is hollow in diverse places: Suspended on obscure and hollow caves.
Some where she has voides without any humor. There likewise if no light show
the difference of the air, yet will I say that the clouds and mists cons^st in
obscurity. For neither are these above the earth, because they seem so to be,
but because they are, they are seen. There notwithstanding also are they for
this cause, because they are not seen. Thou may know likewise that there,
there do flow certain rivers, no less great then those that we see, the one
stealing along sweetly, the other violently and with roaring noise, by reason
that they fall down headlong from craggie and stony places. What then will thou not confess also, that there are lakes under the earth, and that there
are certain pooles, whose waters stands continually without issue? Which if
it be so, it follows also that the air is burdened, and by his burden
bended, and raises the wind by his urging forward. We shall know well then
that these winds shall be produced, in obscure places, out of these clouds
under earth, when they have gathered so much forces that either may suffice to
break through the resistance of the earth, or occupy some open passage for
these winds, and that by these caves they may be conveyed amongst us. But this
is most manifest, that under ^arth there is a great quantity of sulphur and
other minerals, that serve to enkindle fire. The air searching issue by these
caves, after it is very much agitated, must of necessity in this great press,
express and cause the fire to iss^^. Afterward the flames being spread more at
large, if there remained any air that was still, the subtlety thereof gave it
motion, and there with great noise and cracking sound, it seeks passage. But
I will entreat hereof more exactly when I shall speak of, and debate of the
trembling of the earth.

CHAP. XV.
A digression wherein he entreats of rivers and pooles under ground.
PErmit me now to tell thee a pleasant tale. Asclepiodotus recites, that in
times past Philip caused certain workmen to be let down in desert mines, to
see if there were any thing to be gotten, in what estate all things were, and
if the avarice of our predecessors had left any thing for those that were to
succeed. These men descended with many lights, and remained there for many
days, and finally being wearied with walking, they saw great rivers, and
pooles of a marvelous length like unto ours, but not enclosed and restrained
with any earth to bound them in, but spread and extended abroad, which made them
afraid: I took great content to read this; for I understand that our age is
sick, not only of new vices^ but also of those which the Ancients have
taught, and that it is not of late time that avarice has dug into the
veins of earth, and rocks, seeking in the darkness the ruin of mankind. An
inuecti^e against avarice.
And as touching our Ancestors, whom we praise so much, they likewise (whose
virtues we complain that we cannot equal) being led by hope, have opened and
dug down mountains, and have found themselves buried under the ruins, and
under the gain they had made. There have been Kings long time before Philip
of Macedon, that have searched out the very bowels of the earth to find out
silver, and forsaking the free air, have slid down into those caves, where
there was no difference betwixt day and night, leaving the clearenesse of the
day behind them. What great hope could this be? What necessity has bowed a
man toward the earth, who was made upright to behold the heavens, that he has
dug, and drowned himself in the heart of the earth, to draw out gold, which
is as dangerous in the searching, as in the keeping! For this has he
undermined the earth, and under hope of an uncertain prey covered in dirt,
(forgetful of his time, and forgetful of his better nature) has he
sequestered himself. There is no dead man to whom the earth is so weighty, as
to those upon whom avarice has cast so weighty a load of earth; from whom she
has taken the light of heaven, and whom she has buried in those bottomless
pits, wherein this poison was hidden: Into those places durst they descend,
where they have found a new disposition of things, the earth suspended, the
winds blowing in an obscure void, the dre^dfull sources of waters that
streamed along, a profound and perpetual night, yet for all this they fear
hell.

CHAP. XVI.
But to return to that which is now in question. Of the four^ principal
winds, and whence they come.
There are four winds, divided into East, West, South, and North. All the
rest which we call by diverse names are numbered under these: EVRVS retired
toward the mornings rise,
And to the Nabathean Kingdoms flies,
Breathing on Persia, and those mountains hye,
That are exposed to PHOEBVS rising eye.
Mild ZEPHIRVS the evening has possessed,
And bea^es upon the warmer shores of West,
But horrid BOREAS does the North invade
And bends his storms against the Scythian glade:
Where contrary, the Southern wind again
The Noonested tract does moist with clouds and rain.
Or if thou had rather comprehend them in shorter words, let them be
assembled in one tempest (which can no ways be.) EVRVS and NOTHVS tempest both
together,
And stormy Afrike hasts (to help them) thither.
And the North-winde which had no place in that conflict. Some imagine that
there are twelve winds. Of twelve winds, according to some
For they divide the four parts of the heauen^ into three, and give two
adjuncts to every one of the four principal winds. According to this manner,
Varro, a very diligent man, has ordered them; and not without cause: For the
Sun neither rises nor sets always in one place, but one is the rising
and setting Equinoctial, (for there are two Equinoctials) other the
Solstitiall and hibernall. We call that Subsolanus, Their name^.
that rises from the Oriental Equinoctial: the Grecians call it (...). Eurus
issues from the Orient of winter, which we have called Vulturnus. And Liuy so
terms it in that unfortunate battle of the Romans, wherein Hanibal set the
rising Sun and wind in the eyes of his enemies, and by the assistance both
of Sun and wind, got the victory. Varro surnameth it also Eurus after this
mann^r. At this day the Latins use indifferently both the one and the other.
The wind that blows from the Oriental Solstice, is called Caecias, or (...)
by the Greeks and the Latins have no other name. The West Equinoctial sends
Fauonius, which they that vnd^rstand not the Greek will tell thee is Zephirus.
From the Occid^ntall Solstice proceeds C^rus, or according to others,
Argestes, which I think not, because that Cor^s blows violently, and makes
a storm in some part; Argestes is ordinarily slack, equal, and common as
well to those that go, ^s those that return. Africus that is both stormy and
tempestuous, departs from the Occident of wint^r, and by the Grecians is
called (...). To the Northward, the highest is Aquilon, that in the midst
Septentrion, and Thracias is the lower, which has no other name amongst the
Latins. From the Meridionall axis arises Euronotus, then Notus, in Latin
Auster; after these Libanotus, which amongst us is without a name.

CHAP. XVII.
Th^^ there can be but twelve principal winds.
I Agree that there are twelve winds, not because there arise many in ^uery
country (for the inclination of the earth exclude^h some) but because there are
no more in any place. So say we that there are six cases, yet mean we not,
that every nowne has six cases, but because ^here is no nown that can have
more then six. They that have proposed twelve winds, have followed this
reason^ that ^here are as many winds as th^re are parts of the heaven, which is
divided into five circles, which pass through the Cardines of the world, that
is to say, the Northern, Solstitiall, Equinoctial, Hibernal, and Meridional,
to which is annexed a sixth, distinguishing, as thou know, the superior part
of the world, from the inferior. For there is always a half above, and
another beneath. The Greeks have called this line which is partly covered, and
partly discovered, Horizon, we Finitor or Finiens. To this must we add the
Meridian circle, which divides the Horizon by straight angles. Some of these
circles go sloapewise, and trauerse the others. But it is necessary that
there should be as great differences in the air, as there is in the parts. So
then the Horizon divides the five aboue-named circles, whereof it makes ten
parts, five to the Eastward, and five to the Westward. The Meridian circle,
which encountereth with the Horizon, adds two parts. If the air have twelve
differences, so many winds makes it. There are some that are proper to
certain places, which go not from one place to another, but bend themselves
toward that which is next, without blowing from one end of the world to
another. Atabulus molesteth Apulia; Iapix, Calabria; Sciron, Athens; Cataegis,
Pamphilia; Circius, France; whose inhabitants cease not to give him thanks,
although he breaks their buildings, as if they were bound unto him for the
bounty of their air. At such time as the Emperor Augustus soiorned in
France, he vowed and builded a Temple to this wind. It were an infinite matter
if I should entreat of all other winds in particular, since for the most
part, there is not any region that has not some wind, that both breeds and
cease in it, or about it.

CHAP. XVIII.
AMongst other works of divine providence therefore, a man may likewise wonder
at this, Why the winds have been created and lodged in the air.
as a matter worthy of admiration. For it has not out of one cause, both
found out, and disposed the winds diversely: but first of all, to the end it
might not suffer the air to stand still, but by continual agitation make it
profitable and vital to those that should use it. Again, that they might
minister raines unto the earth, and bridle excessive storms. For sometimes
they bring on clouds, sometimes sever them, to the end that the rain may be
distributed through all the world: Auster drives it into Italy, Aquilo casts
it into Africa, the Etesians suffer not the clouds to stay with us. The same
winds in the same season, when we have drought, water India and AEthiopia with
continual raines. But why? could a man store up his corn, were it not that
the wind assisted him to drive the chafe from that which was to be reserved?
Except there were somewhat that caused it to increase, and that breaking the
ear and spike that holds the grain hidden and covered (which the laborers
call the husks) should open the same? Is it not a great good, that she has
giu^n us the means to be able to traffic and to merchandise with foreign
Nations? How men have abused this blessing o^ God bestowed upon us by the wind.
This is a great benefit of Nature, exc^pt the fury of men converted it to
their injury. Now that which in times past was spoken by the greater part of
people by Caesar, that a man could scarcely say whether it were more expedient
for the Commonweal, if this man had lived, or had never been, may be at this
day said of the winds. So much the necessity of them, and the profit that they
bring counterpriseth the evils, that the fury of mankind has invented to his
own ruin by this means. For such goods cease, not to be good of their own
nature, although they are become hurtful through their wickedness that abuse
the same. The eternal providence of God, who is the governor of this world,
has not given this charge unto the winds to agitate the air, neither has he
lodged them in all parts to cleanse the same, to the end we should cover a part
of the sea with vessels charged with armed soldiers, or that we should seek
out enemies in or beyond the same. What madness is it that possesses us, and
makes us to seek out a means how to murder one another? We embarke our
selves to fight and seek out danger, we hazard our selves to find out hazard.
We adventure on uncertain fortune, we combat against the violence of a storm,
which no humane power is able to surmount, and run unto death without hope of
sepulture: yet should this be nothing, if we might attain peace hereby. But
now when we have escaped so many hidden rocks, and the ambushes of a seafull
of shoales, impetuous billows, and sands into which a headlong wind drives
those that sail: when we have passed through days covered with skowling
clouds, horrid night full of rain and thunder, and seen the vessels broken
and battered by the wind. What shall be the fruit of this labor and fear?
What haven shall entertain us, being wearied with so many evils? It shall be
war, and the enemy that attends us upon our descent; the Nations we shall
murder, and shall kill a part of the Conquerours army, with burning of those
Citi^s that were builded for perpetuity. Why call we the people to arms? Why
le^ie we men of war, entending to arrange our battles in the midst of the
sea? Why disquiet we the seas? Is not the earth great enough for us to die in?
Fortune handles us too delicatly: She has given us too hard bodies, and to
happy health. There is no accident that may hurt us. Every one may measure
his years, Inuectiues against the disturb^rs o^ humane peace.
and pursue them until old age. Let us then enter upon the s^a, and provoke
the forts that forbear us. Wretched men what seek you? Death; which every
where attends you, and always is at hand? He will find you even in your
beds, but let him find you always innocent; he will possess you in your
houses; but let him take hold of those that practice no evil. But what other
thing is this, but mere rage, for a man incessantly to carry his dangers
about him, and to thrust himself amongst new and unknown dangers, to enter
into choler without any offense, and thereupon to tread all things under
foot that a man meets withal, and after the manner of savage beasts, to
murder him that a man hates not? yet beasts bite either for revenge or hunger
sake; but we that are prodigal both of our own and other men's blood, trouble
the seas, lanch our ships, commit our security to the waue^, wish for fair
winds, whose felicity is to be carried speedily to war. How ^arre have our
evils ravished us that are evil? Is it a little matter for us to play the
fools in our own country? So the foolish Persian King sailed over into
Greece, The strange vanities o^ Xerxes and Alexander.
which he conquered not, although he covered the conntrie with soldiers. So
would Alexander enquire, when he was beyond the Bactrians and Indians, what was
beyond that great sea, and would be angry if he should leave any thing behind
him. Thus Covetousness will deliver Crassus into the Parthians hands. He shall
not fear the execrations of the Tribune that calls him back, nor the
storms of a long voyage, nor the lightnings which enuironing Euphrates,
foretold him of his fall, nor the gods that made head against him; In spite of
heaven and earth, he will run and seek out gold. It were therefore some
reason, to say that Nature had greatly favored us, if she had forbidden the
winds to blow, to the end to bridle the forces of humane fury, by staying
every one in his own country. For if there followed no other good, at
leastwise no man could be borne, but to do evil to himself, and his own.
But now it is a small matter to play the madman at home, In what so^t men
abuse the wi^des.
we must go far off, and torment others. There is no country so far of
us, but it may send us much misery. Whether know I, whether any powerful and
unknown Prince, made proud with his own greatness, shall sallie out of his
own country with armed hand? Or whether he riggeth some navy, intending to
cause some trouble? whence know I whether such or such a wind may bring arms
against me? It were a great part of humane peace, if the seas were closed, yet
can we not, as I said a little before, God is the a^thor o^ good, t^ou (...)
men em^loy his blessings to the contrary.
complain against God our Creator, if we abuse his benefits, and make them
contrary unto us. He gave the winds to keep the temperature both of heaven
and earth, to call forth and suppress the waters, to nourish seeds, and fruits
of trees; which the agitation of the winds, together with other assistance do
ripen, drawing nutriment to their upper parts, and increasing them, lest they
should wither. He gave the winds to know the furthermost parts of the earth.
For man had been an unskillful creature, and without great experience of
things, if he had been shut up within the confines of his own country. He
gave the winds, to the end that the commodities of every country might be
common, The wicked en^y nothing but to the^r own confusion.
not to the end they should carry legions and horsemen, nor transport men to
pernicious wars. If we weigh the benefits of nature according to their
deprauednesse that use them, we have received nothing but to our own misery.
What profits it a man to see, to speak? Nay, whose life is not a torment?
Thou shall find nothing of so manifest profit, which error cannot transfer
to the contrary. So Nature intended, that the winds should be good, but we
have made them evil. There is not one but pusheth us toward some evil. Every
one sets sail to diverse ends and intentions, but no man aymeth at the just
cause; A notable censure of our vanity.
for diverse evil concupiscences make us embarke, therefore we set sail to
some evil end. Plato speaks well to the purpose, and he it is, that must be
produced before us, as a witness in the end of our days, that we prise our
lives basely for things of small value. But (my d^ere Lucillius) if thou
estimate their fury well, that is to say, our own (for we are of the
company) thou will laugh; yet more when thou shall bethink thy self, that
life is gotten by those things, wherein life is consumed.

The End of the fifth Book of the Natural Questions.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA, DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS The sixth Book. Wherein He entreats of the motion of the earth.
CHAP. I.
IT has been heard by us (my Lucillius the best of men) that Pompeias a
renowned City in Campania, The wonderful earthquake that happened in Campania
in Senecaes time.
having on the one side the Surrentinian and Sabiane shores, on the other side
the Herculan, and which the Sea begi^teth with a pleasant gulf, made as it
were artificially, was shaken by an earthquake, not without the prejudice of
those countries that bordered upon the same: and that the same happened in
Winter time, which as our ancestors assure us, is exempt from such danger.
This earthquake happened the fifth day of February, when Regulus and Virginius
were Consuls, which brought a marvelous ruin into Campania, which had been
never well assured from that danger: yet had it not before that time encountered
with any such misfortune, and in great fears had been oftentimes preserved;
for a part of the City of Hercule is fallen to the ground, and that which as
yet stands, is not well assured. The e^^ect of this earthquake.
The Colonie of the Nucernis also, as it has not suffered some general
destruction, so is it not without complaint. Naples likewise has privately
lost much, but publicly nothing, being lightly touched with a great evil. As
touching some scattered Farms, they have been almost all of them shaken, but
not offended by this earthquake. They add hereunto, that six hundredth flocks
of sheep were strooken dead, and that statues have been riuen in sunder, and
moreover, that some persons lost their wits, and ran about the streets like
mad men. The process of this enterprised work, and the circumstance of the
season require us to examine the causes of these accidents. We ought to seek
out comfort for those that are dismayed, and extinguish mighty fear. For what
security can a man promise himself if the world it self be shaken, and the
most solid parts thereof quake, if that which is wholly immovable and settled,
There is nothing assured under heaven.
to the end it may sustain all other things on it be shattered here and
there? If the earth loses that which she has propper in her, which is to be
firm; whereupon may we assure our dismay and fear? What retreat shall there be
for our bodies? Whether shall they retire in danger, if fear issues and be
drawn from the bottom of the earth? All men are amazed with fear hearing the
houses crack, and the ruin has given a sign; then every one flies headlong
from the place, and forsakes his home and houshold-goods, and setleth himself
in the open fields. What retreat discover we? What succor appears if the
world it self fall into ruin? If she that keeps and sustaineth us, whereon
our Cities are builded, which some have said to be the foundation of the world
sinketh and trembles? How vain are the hopes which men apprehend amidst so
great incertainties.
What support, or rather what solace may a man hope for, when as fear i^ self
has lost the means of flight? Is there any assured retreat or firm safeguard,
say I, either for a man's self or another? I may repulse mine enemy from the
breach; high Rampires and Bulwarks will stay great armies from approaching
very easily. The heavens preserve us from shipwreck: the corners of our houses
resist the violence of raging raines, and d^fence us from the continual fall
of showers: the fire follows not those that fly it: the houses under ground,
and deep dug caves serve for a shelter against thunders and the threatenings
of heaven. The lightning penetrateth not the earth, but is repulsed by a little
object of the same. In the plague time a man may change his habitation. There
is no evil but may be avoided. Never did lightnings burn up whole Nations.
The pestilent air has desolated Cities, but not destroyed them: this evil
extends it self every way, and is unavoidably greedy, and publicly
harmefull. For it not only deuoureth houses, or families, or private Cities,
but ouerturneth whole Nations and Regions, and sometime covers them in her
ruins, sometimes hides them in a bottomless gulf of confusion. Neither
leaves it so much whereby it may appear that that was at leastwise, which now
is not. But the earth extends it self above noble Cities, without any
appearance of the former condition: neither want there some men that fear this
kind of death, more then any other, whereby both they and their houses are
swallowed up, and are carried away alive from the number of the living, as if
all sorts of death conducted us not to one and the same end. Consolations and
remedies against the same.
Amongst all other rites that nature pretends in justice, this is the
principal, that drawing near unto death we are all equal. There is no
difference therefore whether a stone crush me, or a whole mountain smother me,
whether the burden of one house fall upon me, or I breath my last under a
little heap of the dust thereof, or whether the whole earth hide my head; if I
die by day and before all men, or if some obscure and vast yawning of the earth
cover me, if I fall alone into such a bottomless pit, or if many Nations keep
me company. What care I if they make a great noise about me when I shall
depart? The death is always death in what part soever I meet it. Let us
therefore fortify our courages against this ruin, which neither can be
avoided nor prevented. Let us listen no more to those men, who have renounced
Campania, and who after this accident have forsaken the country, and vow that
they will never visit that Region again; for who will promise them that this
or that ground shall stand upon better foundations. All places of the earth are
of the same stu^^e, and if as yet they are not moved, yet are they moveable:
happily this night, or the day before this night shall divide this place
likewise, wherein thou live more securely. Whence will thou know that the
condition of these places is better, on which fortune has already spent all
her forces, and are assured for ever by the ruin which they have suffered. We
deceive our selves if we think that there is any part of the earth exempt from
this danger. All of them are subject to the same law. Nature has made nothing,
which is not exposed to change: this thing fails at one time, and that at
another. And even as in great Cities, now this house, now that is suspended; so
in this world, All countries are exposed to earthquakes.
now one Region is shaken, straight another. Tire in times past was defaced by
ruins. Asia lost twelve Cities at once. The last year Achaia and Macedon have
been endamaged with this evil (whatsoever it be) that has now afflicted
Campania. Fate makes his circuit; and if for a time he forget some things, at
last he reuisiteth them. He afflicts some more rarely, and others more often,
but leaves nothing exempt and free from evil: he mustereth not us only that
are men that have but a little handful of life, but Cities also, extents of
countries, shores, and the Sea it self. Mean while we make our selves believe
that these corruptible things are eternal, and believe that our good hap which
we enjoy, and which passes away more lightly then the wind, shall have some
weight or stay in this or that. And they that promise themselves that all
things shall be perpetual unto them, cannot remember that the earth it self,
on which we tread, is neither firm nor stable: for this accident is hot only
incident to Campania and Achaia, but to every ground, to be brittle, and to be
resolved upon diverse causes, and to be ruinated in part although the whole
remain.

CHAP. II.
WHat do I? I had promised to set down comforts against dangers, and behold
I denounce perrils every way; The true assurance against dangers, is to
remember that we are exposed to dangers.
I deny that there is any thing, which both cannot perish nor cause ruin,
which may be ever in eternal repose: but contrariwise, I maintain also that
this ought to serve for the greatest assurance that may be found, because a
fear without remedy is a mere folly. Reason shakes off wise-mens fear,
imprudent men gather great security in their desperation. Think therefore that
this is spoken unto mankind which was said unto those men, who through a sudden
captivity stood amassed amidst the flame and the enemy. The only help to
those that are in thrall
Is counted this, to hope no help at all.
If you will fear nothing, think that all things are to be feared: look about
you, upon how slight causes we are shaken and ouerturned. Neither is our meat,
nor our drink, our watching, our sleep wholesome for us, except it be in some
measure: you see now that our bodies are vain, fluid, infirm, and easily
destroyed. Undoubtedly this one danger were enough that the earths tremble,
that they are instantly dissipated, and swallow that which they themselves
sustain. He priseth himself very much, that fears the lightning, the
shaking and openings of the earth, although the sense of his own infirmity,
make him fear his own phlegm. After this manner are we borne; having so happy
members allotted us, men grown to this greatness, and for this cause, except the
parts of the world be moved, except the heavens thunder, except the earth
sink, we cannot perish. A little pain, not of the whole finger but of one
side of the nail of our little finger, or a chap kills us: and shall I fear
the tremblings of the earth, The smallest dangers being sufficient to end us,
why should we fear any whatsoever appeareance o^^ereth it self, the end is
one.
whom a little thick spittle choketh? Shall I fear that the Sea shall break
from out his bounds, and that the floods with a course more greater then
accustomed, by assembling more waters should attempt to drown me. When as a
potion has strangled some that slippeth down the contrary way into the
throat? What a fond thing is it to fear the Sea, when thou know that thou
may perish by a little drop? There is no greater solace and remedy against
death, then to know that we must die; and against all dangers that enuiron and
astonish us, to remember that we bear an infinite number of perrils in our
bosoms. For what madness can there be more, then to swound when we hear it
thunder, and to hide our selves under earth for fear of lightning? What is
more foolish then to fear the sudden fall and overthrow of mountains, the
ouerflowes of the Sea, being cast without his bounds. When as death meets
with us in all places, and accosteth us on al sides, and there is nothing so
little, but is of sufficient force to exterminate mankind. Neither should these
accidents confound us, as if they contained in them more evil then an ordinary
death: but contrariwise, since we must needs depart out of this life, and at
one time or other breath our last, it should be a contentment for us to die by
some notorious means. We must needs die sometime, wheresoever it be. Although
this earth that sustaineth me remains firm, and contains it self within
his limits, and is not shaken by any incommoditie, yet shall she cover me one
day. What skils it then whether I cover my self, or that the earth of it self
cover me? She opens her self through the marvelous power of an unknown
evil, she yawneth and makes me sink, and swalloweth me in her immeasurable
depth: What then? is it a more gentle death to die in the plain? What cause
have I to complain, if nature will not permit me to be buried in an ignoble
place? and if she cast a part of her self over me? My friend Vagellius wrote
very wittily in that worthy Verse of his; If I must fall this thing wish I,
That I may fall down from the sky.
The same will I say if I must die; let it be then when all the world is
shaken, not that it is a thing lawful to wish the ruin of the world, but
because it is a great solace against death, to see that all the earth must one
day have an end.

CHAP. III.
Of the natural cau^es of earthquakes.
THis likewise shall profit much, to presume in mind that the gods do none of
these things, neither that their indignation is the cause, whence proceeds
this agitation both of heaven and earth. Such accidents have their causes; it
is not by commandment that they rage thus, but even as our bodies are
afflicted with evil humors, so both heaven and earth have certain defaults,
and even then when they seem to do us harm, they endamage themselves. But
because we understand not the true causes, all accidents seem terrible unto
us, and because they happen very seldom, we are thereby affrighted the more.
Those evils that are ordinary are more easily endured, but those that are
extraordinary, astonish the more. Whence it comes to pass that we esteem^
extraordinary accidents for novelties.
But why seems any thing a novelty unto us? It is because we comprehend
nature by the eyes and not by reason, and think no ways on that which she
may do, but only on that which she has done. Therefore are we worthily
chastised for this negligence, being terrified by those accidents which we
call new, when as indeed they are not, but only unaccustomed. What then? Feel
we not our minds seized with religious fear, and find we not the common sort
dismayed, to see the Sun loose his light, or the Moon, (whose obscurity is
more often) when she hides her self wholly, or in some part, and far more
if we see pillars of enflamed fire thwarting the air; a greater part of the
heavens on fire, if we see crinite Comets and diverse Suns, if we behold the
stars by day time, the sudden fires running from one part to an other, and
leaving after them a great light? We behold none of these things without fear,
and when as to be ignorant is the cause of fear, think you it a small matter
to be instructed how you should not be afraid? How far better were it
therefore to seek out the causes of these changes, by applying the mind
diligently thereunto? For there cannot any one more worthy subject be found
out, wherein a man should not only fix his studies, but spend them also.

CHAP. IIII.
LEt us therefore seek out what the cause is which moves the earth from her
bottom to the top, The causes of diverse tremblings, and yawnings of the earth,
and other such gre^^ accidents.
that impelleth the weight of so massiue a body, what it is that has so much
force to be able to lift up so unwieldy a burden, whence comes it that
sometimes she trembles, and sometimes being loosened sincketh, now renteth
her self into diverse parts, now appears long time open, sometimes closes
her self suddenly, presently swalloweth up great Rivers, anon after disgorgeth
new, discovers in one place the veins of hot water, in an other cold:
vomiteth sometimes fire by a new vent of a Mountain or Rock: other whiles
choaketh and shuteth up those that had flamed and burned for the space of many
years. She moves a thousand miracles, produces diverse changes, transporteth
mountains, makes mountains of plains, swells up the valleys, and raises
new Islands in the Sea. To know the causes of so many accidents, is a thing
worthy to be discussed. But what commodity say thou will there grow hereby?
The greatest in this world, which is the knowledge of nature. Although the
consideration of this matter brings many commodities with it, What profit the
sear^^ into nature yeelde^h a man.
yet contains it nothing in it self more excellent then this, that the
worthiness thereof wholly possesses the mind that is fixed thereupon, and it
is not the gain, but the miracle that is observed therein that makes it
venerable. Let us consider then what the cause might be, why such things
happen, the contemplation whereof is so pleasing unto me, that although in
times past, during my younger years, I published a Treatise of earthquakes, yet
had I a mind to try and assay, whether age has added any thing either to my
knowledge or diligence.

CHAP. V.
Diverse opinions v^on the causes of ea^thquakes.
SOme have thought that the cause of earthquakes was in the air, some in the
impressions of fire, some in the earth it self, and othersome in the air.
Some have said that two or three of the elements were the cause, some have
imputed it to all. Some of these have said that one of these in their knowledge
was the cause thereof, but which they knew not: But now let us examine ^uery
particular. This before all things must I needs say, that the opinions of the
ancients were both gross and feeble. The ignorance of the ancient^ in this
point of natural Philosophy.
They wandered as yet about the truth. All things were new to those that spoke
of it first, but afterward they were better polished and discovered, and if
any thing be found out, yet for all that we ought to ascribe and attribute the
honor to them. It was the enterprise of a high understanding, to diue into the
secrets of nature, and not content to behold her outwardly, to contemplate her
inwardly, and to descend into the secrets of the Gods. He has helped very much
in the finding it out, that has hoped that he might find the same. Our
ancients therefore are to be heard with some excuse: nothing is consummate in
the beginning: neither in this thing only which is the greatest and most
intricate of all others, wherein likewise when as much is performed, yet every
age shall find what to do: but in every other business also, the beginnings
were always far from perfection.

CHAP. VI.
Whether waters be the cause of ^a^hquakes.
IT has not been maintained by one, nor after one manner, that the water is
the cause of earthquakes. Th^les Milesi^s is of the opinion, that all the earth
floateth, and is carried above the water, whether it be that we call it the
greater Ocean, or the great Sea, or any simple water of another nature, or a
moist element. By this water, says he, the earth is sustained as a great ship,
which waigheth very much upon the waters that bear it up. It were a superfluous
matter to set down the reasons why he thinks that the most waightiest part
of the world cannot be sustained by the air which is subtle and light: For
the question is not now about the situation thereof, The reasons alleged by
Thales to p^oue this, with Senecaes ans^e^es.
but of the trembling of the same. He alleges for one of his reasons, that
the waters are the cause of the quaking thereof, because that in all
extraordinary motions, there issue almost ordinarily some new fountains: as
it happens almost ordinarily by some ships, which if they be inclining to one
side; and show their keele aside-long^, gather water, which (if it happen that
the burden they bear be ouer-waightie) either spreads it self above,
raises it self more higher toward the right, or toward the left. We need
no long answer to show that this opinion is false. For if the water sustained
the earth, sometimes the whole earth should be shaken, and have continual
motion, neither should we wonder that it is agitated, but that it stays
settled. She should not tremble in a part, but wholly: for never is a ship
shaken to the halfes. But the earthquake is not of the whole, but a part only.
How then can it be^ that all that which is carried is not wholly agitated? if
that which is not carried is agitated? But why appear new waters? First of all
the earth has oftentimes trembled, and yet no new source has ever discovered
it self. Again, if for this cause the water brake forth, it would spread it
self on both sides of the earth, as we see it happens in Rivers, and in the
Sea, that when the ships lie at road, the increase of the waters appears,
especially about the sides of the Vessel. Finally, there should not be so
small an eruption made as he speaks, and the pump should not yield water as
it were by cleft, but a great del^ge should be made as from an infinite water
that bears the earth.

CHAP. VII.
SOme have imputed the motion of the earth to the water, Other re^sons of th^se
who after Th^le^ have thought, that the water is the cause of the trembling of
the earth.
but upon a different cause: They say that diverse kinds of waters run through
the whole earth: and that in some place the waters are perpetual, great and
nauigable, although it rayneth not. On the one side Nilus is very great^ and
violent in the Summer time, on the other Danubius and the R^ine, passing through
peaceable and hostile Countries, the one brideling the incursions of the
Sarmatians, and separating Europe from Asia^ the other repelling the Almaines
which are a warlike Nation. Add hereunto the spacious Lakes, the pooles
environed by nations that know not one an other, the Marshes that never as yet
ship has thoroughly sailed through, nor the inhabitants that border thereupon
have ^uer visited and searched. After thi^ so many fountains, so many sources,
whence are vomited both from above and beneath the earth, so many Rivers in so
great number. Besides these so many furious torrents, whose forces d^re as
little as they are sudden and violent. Such is the nature and appearances of
waters, especially of those that are in the earth. There likewise are diverse
currents of maruailous swiftness, which spend themselves into bottomless
pits: and others more gentill, which are spread abroad by spacious channells,
where they flow peaceably without any noise. But who will deny that they are
contained ^n vast receptacle^, and that in diverse places they remain in repose
without stirring. I need not long time insist upon this proof, that there are
many waters there, where all are. For the earth would not suffice to produce so
many floods if she had not abundance in store. This being thus; it must
needs b^e that sometimes a River swells inwardly, and that in breaking his
bounds he runs violently against that which resists him. By thi^ means
there shall be some motion made of some part against which the flood inforceth
it self, and against which it will bear until such time as it has a
decrease. It may be that the River exceeding his bounds eats away some
quarter of the Coun^rie, and carries with it a mass of the earth: which
beginning to be dissolved, all the rest which is above is shaken and follows
after. But that man ouer-tr^steth (...) eyes, and cannot extend his mind
f^rther then (...) ^ye of hi^ body, that believes not, that in the cauities of
the earth there are gulfes of ^he spacious Sea. For I see not what thing may
hinder, but that there is a shore under earth, and that by the channells which
are hidden under Sea, which therein it may be have as much and more place then
those which we see. The reason is that the earth and the sea, that is
discovered to our sight, ought to be as it were covered with so many Creatures
as we see. Contrariwise the Regions that are hidden, deserts, and without
inhabitants, receive the waters more freely, which nothing hinders to flow,
and to be agitated by those winds, by the whole air, and the whole distances
of places. A storm being raised there, and more violent then ordinary, may
more rudely shake some portion of the earth which it encountreth with. For in
our quarters likewise many places far distant from the Sea, have been beaten
with a sudden access and flood of the same; and the flood that is conceived to
come a far off has invaded those country houses that are builded about us.
Under earth also the Sea may have his ebb and floate; which cannot be without
some shaking of the earth, which is above the same.

CHAP. VIII.
He proves that there are abundant waters under the earth.
I Think that thou will not very much debate and doubt, whether there be
rivers and a sea hidden under ground: for from whence do they issue, and come
unto us, except that it be because the water is enclosed in his source? Tell
me when thou see the course of the river Tigris stayed, and the water
thereof cried up by little and little, and not all at once, and less appears
not, but that it is diminished until such time as it is wholly dried, whether
think thou that it goes, when as thou see it issue, as violent, spacious,
and deep as it was in the beginning? And when thou see the river Alphaeus,
which the Poets have so much renowned, loose it self in Achaia, and aft^r
having trauersed the sea, discover it self in Sicilie, where with a lively
source it passes forward the pleasant fountain of Arethusa, what think
thou? Know thou not that amongst the reports that are made of the River of
Nilus, and the over flow thereof in Summer time, that it is said that it
issues from the earth, and that it increases not by the waters of the air,
but by those waters that spring from under the earth? I have heard say by two
Centurions, whom the Emperor Nero Neroes praise during the first years of his
Empire, but how great alteration breedet^ much authority, where the counsailors
are flatterers, religion paganism, delight impiety?
(a friend of all virtue, but above all of verity) had sent to di^couer the
source of Nilus, that after a long journey, accomplished by the assistance of
the King of AEthiopia, who had recommended them to diverse other Kings, they
came unto certain marshes of infinite extent, the inhabitants of which
country knew not the end thereof, and no man durst promise himself to
discover the same, by reason that the hearbe^ and waters were so tied together,
that it was impossible for a footeman to travel; no less for a Boat, because
the Marshes being full of mud and flags, could not bear the vessel wherein
there was any more then one man. They add moreover, that they have seen in
Marshes two rocks, from whence the water falls abundantly. But whether it be
that such water be called the source or increase of Nilus, or that he has his
beginni^g there, or that he is derived from farther places, think thou that
it mounteth not from some great Lake under ear^h? It must needs be tha^ these
rocks have their waters derived from diverse place^, and gath^^ed up on high,
which discharge themselves in such abundance and s^ violently.

CHAP. IX.
THere be some that judge fire to be the cause of this motion, The examination
of their opinion who hold that the fire i^ cause of earthquake.
yet consider they this cause in diverse fashions. Amongst the rest Anaxagoras
thinks that the air and the earth are almost shaken by the same cause. When
as the wind which is enclosed under earth, breaks the air which was
thickened and formed in a cloud, with as great violence as the clouds which
we see are accustomed to break, and that the fire by this entershocke of
clouds, and by the course of the air, which is restrained within it, causes
lightning to issue. This air opposes it self against all things it meets,
which seeking a passage to issue forth, and teareth open all that which
hinders it, until such time that either it has found a passage by some
little hole to mount toward heaven, or that it has gotten it by force and
violence. Some say that the cause is in the fire, but they are not of opinion
that it is for this reason, but for that being covered in diverse places, it
burns and consumes all that which it meets withal. And if the things that
are eaten thereby happen to fall, then is it that there follows a disjunction
of the parts, which are disfurnished of their stays, and finally, a total
ruin, because nothing presents it self to sustain the burden. Then are
the openings and vast yawaings of the earth discovered; or else when the parts
of the same have long time declined, they which remain entire begin to
dissolve. We see the like hereof happen amongst us as oftentimes as the fire
has taken hold of some quarter in the City, when as the beams and
principals are burned, or that the maine tymbers that sustain the house are
sunk, then the house being shaken falls to the ground, and so long time
shrink they, and are uncertain, until they have found some place to stay
upon.

CHAP. X.
ANAXIMENES says, that the earth her self is the cause of her motion, The
opinion of Anaximenes, that the earth it self is the cause of her motion.
neither is there any thing extrinsecally that impelleth the same, but that
into her, and from her fall certain parts which the water dissolueth, or the
fire eats, or the wind shakes? but although rhese three cease, yet cease
she not to have something, by means whereof this revulsion and diminution is
made. For first of all, all things decline by succession of time, and there is
nothing that is exempted from the hands of age which ruinates the strongest and
most solid things. Even as therefore in old houses, some things fall although
they are not strooken, when as they have more weight upon them then force to
bear it: so falls it out in this universal body of the earth, that the
parts thereof are dissolved by age, and being dissolved, fall and breed a
trembling in the upper parts. First, whilst they separate themselves (for there
is no great thing that is disioyned without the motion of that whereunto it
cleaves) then when they are fallen they rebound back again after the manner
of a ball, which falling from on high upon the earth, is many times strooken
up, and makes diverse bounds. But if they happen to fall into some great poole,
the water that is moved by the fall makes that tremble which is round about,
and it is the weight that falls from on him that causes this present shocke,
and that spreads it every ways.

CHAP. XI.
Another opinion of those that think the earthquake is caused by fire.
THere are some that assign this trembling to the fire, but otherwise; for when
as in diverse places they are hot and boiling, it must needs be, that a
mighty vapor is turned up and down without issue, which by the
multiplication thereof reinforceth the air; which being animated and provoked,
riueth that which it opposite; but if it be more remiss it does nothing else
but move. We see that water fometh when fire is put under it. That which this
fire does in this water, that is included in a straight and narrow vessel, but
far more we may think it may do it, when with violence and great abundance,
he causes great quantities of waters to boil. Then agitateth he by the
vaporation of the waters that ouerflow, whatsoever he beats upon.

CHAP. XII.
Whether the wind be the cause of earthquakes.
MAny and the greatest learned men, are of the opinion that the wind is the
cause of earthquakes. Archelaus who has carefully examined the opinions of the
ancients, says thus: The winds are carried through the cauities of the earth,
afterward when all spaces of the same are filled, and that the air is
thickened as much as may be, that wind that comes after presses and
expresses the former, and first of all by redoubled strokes pusheth it
forward, and finally casts it out. This seeking for a place, runs here and
there, and enforces it self to break his bounds. Thus comes it to pass
that the earth is shaken by the wind, which strives and seeks for a passage
to get out at; when as therefore an earthquake is like to follow, first there
goes before it a tranquillity and calm of the air, and the reason is,
because the power and virtue which was accustomed to move the winds, is
detained under earth. And now likewise in this earthquake of Campania, although
it were in Winter time, and in a troubled season; yet so it is that some days
before it happened, the air was calm and peaceable. What then? Was there
never earthquake when the winds blew? Very seldom have two winds blown at
once: yet can it be, and it is wont to be; which if we admit, and that it
appears that two winds may blow at once, why might it come to pass that the
one should agitate the higher air, and the other the inferior.

CHAP. XIII.
YOu may number amongst those of this opinion Aristotle and his scholar
Theophrastus, The firm opinion of Aristotle and others, that wind is the
cause of earthquakes.
a man not so excellent and divine as the Graecians make him, yet of a
pleasing, fluent, and unaffected discourse. I will discover unto thee both
their opinions: there is always some euaporation from the earth, that is
sometimes dry, sometimes intermixed with humiditie. This exhalation issuing
from beneath, and carried up as high as it might, when as she has not a
farther place by which she may find issue, recoyleth back again, and
enfoldeth her self in her self: and whilst the debate of the wind, which
goes and comes, ouerturneth that which makes head against her, be it that
she remains enclosed, be it that she escapes by narrow straights, she moves
earthquakes and thunders. Strabo is of the same opinion; a man who has
carefully addicted himself to this part of Philosophy, and has diligently
searched out the secrets of Nature. This is his opinion: Cold and heat are
two opposites, and cannot be together, the cold slippeth in thither where the
heat is absent; as contrariwise, the heat enters that place whence the cold
is driven. This that I speak is true; but that both are driven contrariwise,
by this it appears. In Winter time when the cold is upon the earth the
Springs are warm, the Caves and all hidden places under earth are hot, because
the heat is retired thither, giving place unto the cold that possesses the
upper part. When the heat is thus entered into the lower parts, and has
insinuated it self as much as it may, the thicker it is the stronger it is. If
a new heat come unto it, the one being pressed by the other gives place: the
contrary happens, when as the cold becoming more powerful slippeth into
the Caves. All the heat which at that time was hidden therein, giving place
unto the cold, retireth it self into some narrow corner, and is moved, and
inforceth it self with great violence; for the nature of them both admits
no concord, neither can they ever bide in one place. Flying therefore and
striving by all means to get out, he overthrows, ruinateth and tosseth
whatsoever he meets. Therefore before the earth is moved, men are accustomed
to hear a kind of whistling or murmr whilst the winds combat beneath, or
otherwise, as our Virgil says could not, The earth waves under feet, the
mountains quake.
If the wind were not the cause hereof. There are likewise vicissitudes of
this fight, and each has his turn. The heat cease to assemble it self,
and to issue. Then is the cold repressed, and succeeds to reinforce himself
incontinently: when as therefore the force of heat and cold runs and
returns often, and that the wind goes and returns here and there, then is
it that the earth trembles.

CHAP. XIIII.
The diverse causes of earthquakes by the means of wind.
THere are some that think that earth is shaken by the wind, and by no other
means; but they imagine another cause then Aristotle did. And hear what they
say. Our body is watered and moistened with blood and spirit, which run here
and there, through those passages that are deputed to those offices. But we have
some more narrow receptacles of the soul, by which she does nothing else but
wander, some more open and spacious, in which she is gathered together, and
from whence she divides her self into parcels. So this great body of the
earth is open to the waters that possess the place of blood, and to the
winds, which a man may well call the soul. These two encounter in some place,
in some place stay. But as in the body, as long as it is in health, the
continual beating of the artery is measured, but if the health thereof be
altered, the pulse is frequent and high, the signs and violent respirations,
are the signs that the body is wearied and afflicted. In like sort when as
the waters and the winds are in their natural receptacles in the body of the
earth, they have no agitation above measure. But if there happen any disorder,
at that time there is distemper, as in a sick body, the wind that breathed
along pleasantly, if it be stopped in the passage, agitateth his veins. It
follows not therefore that the earth should be as the body of a living
creature, as some do pretend. For if it were so, it should be wholly agitated
as a living creature is. And we our selves feel that feuor afflicts not some
parts of the body more gently then other some, but that she runs through
all equally. Consider therefore, if it be not true that the wind enters into
the earth, replenished with air round about, which as long as he has free
passage, steals a long gently, if he encounter with any thing that stops
his passage, first of all he is charged by the air that presses after hard at
his back, afterward he flies secretly by some crany, and the more eagerly
dislodgeth he, the more straiter his passage is. This cannot be done without
conflict, neither is there any combat without agitation. If he finds not any
clift to escape there, he gathers himself together and begins to tempest,
whirling upwards and downwards, until such time as he has ouerturned and
suncke that which resisted him: if he be subtle, he is wonderously strong, and
if he slideth through passages that are somewhat narrow, and that by his virtue
he enlarges and dissipateth all that where he enters, then is the earth
shaken. For either she opens her self to give passage to the wind, or after
she has given it, being destitute o^ foundation, she seazeth and sea^eth her
self in that cauity whereby she gave him passage.

CHAP. XV.
The third opinion of ea^thquaks by ^orce of wind.
THus some think: The earth is perforated in diverse places, neither has she
only these first entrances and pores which she received as vents from her
beginning, but casualtie has bred many more in her. In some places the water
has enlarged all that earth which she had over her, the torrents have eaten
away some portion, the greatest heates have cleft another. The wind enters
betwixt both, which if the sea has included and driven, neither suffered the
floods to go backward, then he being cut off both of his entrance and return,
tumbleth about. And because he cannot, according to his nature, tend directly,
he shoots up himself on high, and reuerberateth the earth that presses him.

CHAP. XVI.
WE must also speak something as touching that which diverse Authors approve,
The fourth opinion as touching the trembling of the earth by wi^de.
and where it may be they will be found to be different. True it is that the
earth is not without air, and not only this air which maintains the same,
and tieth the parts thereof together, penetrating likewise through stones and
other bodies without life: but also this vital air which quickens and
nourishes all things. If she had it not, how should she give life to so many
plants and seeds, which draw their vigor from no place else? How could she
entertain and sustain so many diverse roots in her, the one of one fashion, the
other of another; the one entertained in her upper part, the others buried more
deeper, if she had not much soul which engenders so many and so diverse
things, and nourishes them by her inspiration and virtue? Hitherto have I ^et
down but conjectures. All the heavens, that are enclosed and arounded with
elementarie fire, all these innumerable numbers of the stars, Senec^es
opinion as touching the greatness of the Sun.
all the celestial bodies, and amongst the rest, the Sun (shaping his course
more near unto us, and which is but twice as great as the globe of the earth)
draw nourishment from the earth, and divide it amongst them, being sustained by
nothing ^lse but terrestrial vapoures. This is their nourishment and feeding.
But the earth could not nourish so many creatures, so ample and more greater
then her self, if she were not full of a soul, that day and night is spread
through all her parts. For it cannot be but that there remains very much in
her, from whence there is so much both expected and gathered, and that which
issues forth should not be bred in his proper t^me. She should not have
continual abundance of spirit to furnish so many celestial bodies, if these
things had not concurrence amongst themselves, and were not grounded and
changed in some other thing. Yet of necessity she must abound and be full,
and that she furnish her self with it, which she has in store. There is no
doubt then, but that much spirit is hidden therein, and that within the entrals
of the earth there is a marvelous abundance of air. This being so, that must
needs follow, that that which is filled with a thing which is very moveable,
should be oftentimes removed. Every one knows that there is nothing more
inconstant, stirring, and fleeting then the air.

CHAP. XVII.
IT is convenient therefore that she exercise her nature, A consequence drawn
from the precedent discourse, and a proof that the wind is the cause of the
trembling of the earth.
and that that which will always be moved, should sometime^ agitate and move
other things. When is this do^e? Then when her course is cut off and stayed.
For as long as he is not intercepted, he steals along quietly and peaceably,
but if he be resisted or restrained, he enters into fury, and breaks
through all that which intercepteth him, ^u^n as the Poet s^ith by the flood:
Araxes that disdaines to bear a bridge.
As long as he has an easy and free passage, he fleeteth along at pleasure,
but if either by cunning or adventure some stones are gathered together which
stay his course, he takes occasion hereby to do much mischief, and the more
stones are opposed against him, the more forces finds he. For all these
floods that come behind, and make the heap more high, being unable to support
themselves any more, overthrow all things in passing by, and fly along
leuelling their stream with that they have overthrown, and those waves that
fled before them. The wind can never be stayed.
The same befalls the wind: The more vigorous and swift it is, the more
swiftly flies it, and carries away with it, with greater violence, all that
which either stops or resists his passage. Thence comes the earthquake,
but in that part under which this conflict was made. That this which I have
spoken is true, it appears by this that follows. Oft-times when there has
bin an earthquake, if any part of the same has been shattered, the wind
has issued forth, and blown for the space of diverse days, as it fell out by
report in that earthquake, The conclusion of all the precedent discourse.
whereof those of Chalcis were afflicted, which was described by Asclepi^dotus,
Possidonius scholar, in his book of Natural Questions. You shall find in
other Authors, that the earth being opened in a certain place: anon after,
there issued a wind, which undoubtedly had made his way in that part from
whence it blew.

CHAP. XVIII.
In what sort the wind causes the earth to tremble.
SO then the wind being by nature swift, and changing from place to place, is
the greatest cause whereby the earth is moved. As long as this wind is impelled
and lies hidden in a void place, it remains calm, and does no evil to that
which enuironeth it; when as any external or superuenient cause solliciteth
him and chaseth him, and drives him into a strait: yet for a while gives he
place and wandereth, but when as all occasion of escape is taken from him, and
he is pressed on every side then, With a mighty murmr of the mountain,
He furious runs about his strait enclosure
And after he has long time beat against the same, he teareth and scatters
it in pieces, showing himself the more violent, the longer that this debate
has lasted in his prison and enclosure. Afterward when as he has searched
every nooke of the place wherein he was restrained and could not escape, he
returns toward that part, where he was most of all impact and closed, and
then slideth he away by certain secret places, which the earthquake has a
little opened, or passes by some new breach. Behold how his extreme violence
cannot be stayed, and there is no restraint sufficient to retain him: for he
breaks all bounds, and carries with him every burden that is laid upon him,
and infused into those things that are more small and thin, he prepares
himself a release and liberty by an invincible power that is natural unto
him, and running on headlong, establishes himself in his rights. In a word,
the wind^ ^s invincible, neither is there any thing that, May keep in awe, or
else in prison strong
The struggling winds or tempest thun^ring long.
Undoubtedly the Poets, who have discoursed in these terms; intended to
speak of these couerts under ground, where the winds r^maine enclosed. But
they have not comprehended, that that which is enclosed is not wind already,
and that that which is the wind, cannot be enclosed. For that which is
enclosed remains still, and is a statue of the air. The wind appears not
to be wind, A comparison taken from the body of man.
but when it flies. To these reasons a man may add this also, which proves
that the winds is the cause of earthquakes, that is to say, that our bodies
tremble not, except some cause do sh^ke the spirit, which being restrained by
fear, weakened by age, the veins decaying and shrinking, is a^^^sted by cold,
or when the access approaches is cast out of his cours^. For as long as he
flows without hinderance, and flows according to his accustomed manner,
there is no shaking in the body. But if any thing happ^n that hinders him
from performing his office, then being scarc^ able to bear those things which
he sustained by his vigor, in falling he shakes all that which in his
integrity he had supported.

CHAP. XIX.
But we must needs give care to Metrodorus Chius, The opinion of Metrodorus
upon this point.
that will have his opinion stand for law. For min^ own part I will not
ouerslip those opinions I approve not, when as it is far better to present all,
and rather to condemn that which we approve not, then to pass it under
silence. What says he then? Even as his voice that sing^th in a tun, passes
and resoundeth in every place with a certain echo, and although it be not
high, yet fills it always the ^unne, not without noise and rebound of the
same: So the capacity and vastit^e of the cauities, and holes that hang under
ground have their air, which as soon as another that falls from above has
stricken, makes a noise, even as the things that are void, whereof I have
spoken, have a resound, when any one cries in them.

CHAP. XX.
LEt us now come unto them, The examination of their opinion who think that
all the elements together, or the most part, are the cause of Earthquakes.
that have said that all the Elements, or the greater part of those whereof we
have spoken, are the cause of earthquake. Democritus sets them not down
all, but for the most part. For sometimes he says that the wind is the cause,
some^times the water, and sometimes both; and this prosecuteth he after this
manner. Some part of the earth is hollow, and in that there assembleth a great
quantity and abundance of water. Of this there is some part more subtle and
liquid then the rest: This being rejected by the weight that comes upon it,
is beaten against the earth, and shakes the same. For it could not float,
except it shaked that against which it is beaten. That likewise which
heretofore we have spoken by the air, may be said by the water also, when as
it is gathered into one place, and that it cease to contain any more: she
stays her self against something: then works she an issue first by her
weight, secondly by her violence, for she cannot have issue, but by some hollow
or bending place having been long time retained, nor fall by measure in a
right line, or without shaking those things, by which, and upon which she
falls. But if it so fall out, that having taken some motion, she happen to
stay in some place, and that this collection of water mounteth back again,
and confuseth it self in it self; she is repulsed toward the firm land,
which she shakes toward that side where she discharges her self most.
Furthermore, the earth being sometimes steeped in water that has entered into
it, setleth a little lower, and the bottom thereof is shaken: which coming to
pass, this part is pressed toward that, toward which the greatest abundance
of water enclineth. Sometimes also the wind pusheth forward the waves, and if
he insist with more violence then ordinary, he causes that portion of the
earth to tremble, into which he translated the waters that are gathered by him.
Sometimes enclosed in straits, and seeking issue, he stirs all those things
which he enuironeth, but the earth is porie, and gives passages for the wind,
which is so thin and pure, that a man cannot contain it, and so strong, that
nothing can resist his force. The Epicure ^aith that all these causes may be,
and he s^archeth out diverse others likewise, censuring those that have
maintained that both the one and the other causes above mentioned, proceed from
the quaking of the earth; sure it is a thing almost impossible to maintain
certain things to be certain, which a man cannot comprehend but by simple
conjecture. So then, according to his opinion, the water may shake the earth,
if it has washed and worn away some portions thereof, which being diminished
and infeebled, cannot any more sustain that, which they bare being in their
entire. The impression of the air may cause an earthquake, and it may come to
pass that the external air shall be agitated by another, that comes to
intermixe it self with it. It may be also that the earth being iustled by some
part of it self, that sincketh and falls suddenly, is shaken likewise: Or
else a portion of the same, being sustained by some supports, trembles if
either the supporters bend, or retire back. Happily also some inflammation of
the air being converted into fire, and like unto lightnings darteth forth and
confounds all that which it meets withal. And it may be that some wind
incenseth both the waters of marshes and pooles, whence follows an
earthquake, because the shocke is violent, or else the agitation of the air,
which increases by motion and urges it self, moves all things from the
bottom to the top. But the Epicure can find no more certain cause of
earthquake then the wind.

CHAP. XXI.
THis is our opinion also, Seneca accords with Aristotle in his opinion, in
as much as concerns earthquakes.
that it is the wind that eff^cteth so great things: since there is nothing so
strong and violent in nature, and without which, those things that are most
vehement, have not any vigor. The wind enkindleth the fire: take away the wind
from the waters, they are sluggish and dead; but if the wind stirs them,
they flow violently. The wine can dissipate the greatest spaces of countries,
make new mountains appear and rise, place unseen Isles in the midst of the
Ocean. Who doubts but that the wind brought that Island of Therasia into
sight, which in our time appeared in the AEgean seas, in the presence of those
Mariners that beheld the miracle. Possidonius sets down two sorts of
earthquakes, Three sorts of earthquakes.
giving every one of them a several name: the one is called Succussion, when
the earth is moved upward and downwards: The other is called Inclination, when
the earth is shaken, and inclines to one side like a boat. But I think there
is a third, which has his denomination from us, and our predecessors have
called Earthquake, and not without cause, because they differ the one from the
other. For in these accidents there is not always an agitation from high to
low, nor an inclining on one side or another, but sometimes a darting or
pressing forward, which is the least dangerous, whereas on the other side the
inclination is far less dreadful then the succussion or shaking. For if in
the inclination of the earth, the opposite motion, hastes not to redress that
which bends side-long, there necessarily follows a dreadful rain. And as
these motions are different in themselves, so are their causes diverse.

CHAP. XXII.
THerefore let us first of all speak of the motion by succussion or shaking.
Of the earthquake by succussion.
If at any time, by change of diverse chariots, men carry great burdens, and
that the wheels being drawn with more then usual force, sincke into some
place, you shall feel a shaking of the earth. Asclepi^dotus reports, that
when as a stone fell from the side of a mountain that was broken, it shaked in
such sort the buildings that were neere^ that they fell to the ground. The like
may happen under earth, that some of those stones that hang over the mountain,
being dissolved, fall with some great weight and noise into the hollowes that
are under earth, and the greater the weight is, and the higher it falls from,
the more violent noise is there made; and so all the covering of the hollow
valley is moved. And it is not unlikely but the rocks are pushed downward, and
divided by their simple weight; but when as the rivers flow and rage above
them, the water continually minisheth the joints of the stone, riuing off (if I
may so speak) the skin that incloseth it. This diminution increasing by
succession of time, infeebleth in such sort that which it has eaten, by little
and little, that such stays cannot any more sustain the burden. Then fall
the stones through excessive weight and this rock being cast down headlong,
shakes all that which it has driven to the bottom, having found no
resistance. And all things seem to fall to sudden ruin.
As our Virgil says. This should be the cause of this motion of succussion:
now pass I over to the other cause.

CHAP. XXIII.
Of the earthquake by inclination.
THe earth is of a rare nature, and has much void in it. Through these parts and
rarities the wind is carried, which when it is entered in some quantity and
finds no issue, it shakes the earth. This cause, i^ a troop of witnesses
prevails any thing with thee, is pleasing unto others, as I have said a
little before. This likewise does Calisthenes approve a man of no small
reckoning. For he was a man of a noble mind, and such a one as could not endure
a Princes insolency. Alexander is defamed for ever, which neither his virtue,
neither his felicity in war can ever redeem. For as oftentimes as a man shall
say, that he has defeated diverse thousands of Barbarians: it will be opposed,
and Calisthenes also. If any one says Alexander killed Darius, who at that
time was the greatest King of the earth: some will reply, and Calisthenes too.
When some shall allege that he conquered all that which he met withal, as
far as the bounds of the Ocean, on which he rigged new nauies, extending his
Empire from the one corner of Thrace, as far as the furthest part of the East,
it will be said that he slew Calisthenes. Although he has surpassed all
Princes, and precedent Captains: the wrong which he offered Calisthenes was so
great, that it blemisheth all his other exploits. This Philosopher then, in his
books wherein he describes how Helice and Bu^is have been devoured by the
waters: Calisthenes opinion.
and what accident was the cause why the sea covered them, or why they were
sucked up, says that which has bin touched in the former part, that the wind
entered the earth by some small and secret conduits in all parts, yea under the
sea. Afterward, when this course which it had held to enter, is stopped, and
the water hat^ cloased up behind him all other passage, he turns here and
there, and returning himself into himself, shakes the earth. And therefore
is it, that the places that border upon the sea are oftentimes agitated: and
the Poets have assigned this power unto Neptune. Whosoever understands the
Greek tongue, knows that Homer surnameth him (...), that is to say,
Earth-shaker.

CHAP. XXIIII.
In what manner the wind enters into the earth, to cause it to tremble.
FOr mine own part I am of this opinion that the wind is the cause of such an
evil. I will only debate upon one point, in what manner this wind enters,
if it be by pores, so strait that the eye cannot observe them, or if they are
more greater, and open, and likewise whether they rise from the bottom or
above the earth. This is incredible: For in our bodies likewise, the skin
repulseth the wind, which has not entered, except by those passages, by which
it is drawn, and being entertained by us, cannot consist but in the most
spacious part of the body, for it remains not amongst the nerves, and in the
pulpe, but in the entrals, and the large retreat of our breasts. A man may think
as much of the earth, especially by reason that the shaking happens not
above, nor about the surface of the earth, but from beneath, and proceeds
from the bottom. The proof whereof is, that the deepest seas are agitated,
when as that whereupon they are spread is moued^ It is therefore likely to be
true that the earth is agitated from the bottom, where the wind is formed in
spacious dens: Some will reply, that even as after we are seized with great
cold, a horror and trembling succeeds, so the wind finding a passage outward
causes the earth to tremble. But this is impossible. For first of all the
earth should of necessity be subject to this access of cold, to the end that
the same might befall her as does us, who q^iuer upon an external cause. I
will not deny, but that there is something in the earth that has some
resemblance with that which happens in our bodies, but the causes are diverse.
It must needs be some interior and deep agitation, that shakes the earth, as
a man may gather evidently enough by this, because the earth having been
opened by a very great and terrible motion, such opening has sometimes
swallowed and sucked up whole Cities, which no man has seen afterward.
Thucydides writes, that about the time that the war was in Peloponesus, all the
Atlantique Island, or the most part thereof, was covered with waters. As much
happened in Sidonia, if thou beleeuest Possidonius. This matter needs no
witnesses: for we our selves remember, that the earth having been opened by an
inward earthquake, all the Countries were ruined, and the Champions perished:
which I will now tell you how I think it happens.

CHAP. XXV.
WHen as the wind with great violence has engulfed himself wholly in the
cauities and void places of the earth, How the earth is shaken by the wind.
and that it begins to tempest in seeking an issue, it oftentimes beats
against the sides and places, wherein he is restrained, upon which sometimes
whole Cities are situated. And these at sometimes are in such sort shaken, that
the houses that are builded thereupon fall unto the ground. Sometimes the
agitation is so violent, that the foundations and walls that sustain all the
rest of building, fall into this concauitie, in such sort as whole Cities sink
down into a depth without end or measure. If thou will believe it, it is
reported that the mountain Ossa was joined to the mountain Olympus, and was
torn away by an earthquake in such sort, that the Mountain, that beforetime
was very thick, was divided into two: and that at that time, the River Peneus
retired himself, which dried up the Marshes that were discommodious to
Thessalie, and carried with him those waters that were settled there without
issue. The maruailous force of the wind.
Ladon, a River that is betwixt Helis and Megalopolis, was caused to flow by an
earthquake, what prove I by this? That the winds are gathered in spacious
caves: for I can give no other name to those void places under earth. If it
were otherways, the greater part of the earth should be shaken, where as now
the earthquake extends it self never farther then two hundredth miles about.
That whereof all the world talks has not passed Campania. At such time as
Chalcis was shaken, Thebes remained in quiet. AEgium was violently tossed, and
Patrassa that was near unto it, heard nothing of it. That vast concussion that
oppressed the two Cities of Helice and Buris, staid on the other side of
AEgium, How far the earthqu^ke extends.
whereby it appears that the earthquake had as much extent as under earth
those hollow places had, where the wind was enclosed.

CHAP. XXVI.
The examination of their opinions who hold the ^gyptians, and the Island of
Delos were never shaken.
I Could abuse the authority of great men to prove this, who write that Egypt
has never trembled. And the reason they yield hereof is this; That it is
wholly gathered and composed of mud. For (if we may give credit to Homer)
Phares was so far off from the Continent as a ship with full sail may reach
in one days journey: but now it is adjoined to the continent. For Nilus
flowing with a troubled stream, and bearing along with him much mud, and
heaping it afterward on those other lands, that are united together, has from
year to year enlarged the Confines of Egypt. Thence is it that it is a fat
and muddie ground, without any openings, but of a continued thicknes: the mud
being become dry; which has stopped up and cimented all that structure, and
united all the parts of the same so well together, that no void may come
between, considering that always that which is soft and moist, joins it
self with that which was solid. But I say that Egypt is subject to trembling,
and the Isle of Delos likewise, although that Virgil willed them to stand: He
made the inhabitants this favor find,
Neither to fear strange earthquakes, nor strange wind.
These the Philosophers likewise (a credulous Nation, according to Pindarus)
said to be exempt from trembling: Thucydides writes, that before time it had
not been agitated, but that about the time of the Peloponesian war it
trembled. Calisthenes says, that it was at an other time. Amongst many
prodigies (says he) which denounced the overthrow of Helice and Buris, there
were two most notable, the one was a pillar of fire, of immeasurable
greatness, the other the earthquake in Delos. The reason why he thinks that
Delos is firm, is, that being in the sea it has many hollow rocks and stones
that are pierced through, which give passage to the winds that are enclosed.
He adds, that by reason hereof the Islands are more assured, and the Cities
also that are more nearer to the sea. The City of Pompeias and Hercule have
^elt, that this is false. Furthermore, all the sea coasts are subject to
agitation. So Paphos has oftentimes been ruined, and Nicopolis likewise too
familiarly acquainted with this misery. A deep sea inuironeth Cyprus, yet is
it shaken, and so is Tire likewise: Hitherto have we examined the causes why
the earth trembles.

CHAP. XXVII.
A discourse upon (...) sheep which were found dead in that earthquake, and of
the causes of this accident.
But some particular accidents fell out in this earthquake of Campania, whereof
I am to set down some reasons. For they say that six hundredth flock of sheep
were killed in the Region of Pompeias. Thou have no cause to think that these
sheep perished through fear, we have said that after great earthquakes, there
ordinarily follows a pestilence: neither is this to be wondered at, because
many pestilent things lie hidden in the depth. The air it self, that is
imprisoned in eternal obscurity, either by the intermission of the earth, or
by his own idleness, is pernicious unto those that suck the same, either
being corrupted by the malignitie of hidden fires, when it is sent from a far
off, it soileth and infecteth the other air which is pure, and breeds new
sicknesses in them who breath the same, whereunto they have not been
accustomed. Furthermore, there are certain unprofitable and pestilent waters,
hidden in the hollowes and secrets of the earth, and the cause why they are
such, is, because they have neither flux nor reflux, nor are beat upon by any
freer wind. Being then thus thick and covered with an obscure mist, they have
nothing in them that is not pestilent, and contrary to our bodies. The air
likewise that is intermixed with them, and that lies amidst those marshes
when it rayseth it self, spreads a general corruption, and kills those
that draw the same. But bruit beasts and cattle feel this least, on whom the
plague the more greedier they are, reigns more fiercely. The reason is,
because they remain most often in open air, and along by river sides, which
ordinarily draw more contagion. As touching sheep, which are of a more tender
nature, and have their heads almost daily inclining toward the ground, I
wonder not that they have been attainted with this contagion, considering that
they have sucked and gathered the breath of the infected air from the earth.
Such an air had done more mischief unto men, had it issued in greater
abundance, but before it issued or was sucked up by any man, it was choked by
abundance of pure air that breath^d.

CHAP. XXVIII.
THat the earth contains many things both pestilent and mortal, Why the air
issuing from the hollow places of the earth is pestilent and mortal.
thou may know, because so many poisons issue from it, not scattered by the
hand, but of their own accord, the ground containing in it the seeds both of
good and evil. And why? are there not diverse places in Italy wherein by
secret pores certain venomous vapors are exhaled, that kill both man and
beasts if they draw near them. The birds also if they light upon it before it
be tempered with a better air, fall down in their very flight, and their
bodies become blew and swollen, even as these humane bodies are, that are
strangled. This spirit as long as it is contained in the earth, flowing through
a small and slender passage, has no more power to kill any, but those that
look into that, or willingly offer themselves unto it. But when as for many
ages it has been hidden in darkness, and through the malignitie and vice of
the place has gather^d more corruption, the longer it stays there the more
heavy it waxes, and consequently the more pernicious is it. But when it has
gotten an issue, it spreads that eternal venom; of shadie cold and
infernal night, and infecteth the air of our Region. For the best are
overcome by the worst. Then likewise that purer air is translated and changed
into evil: whence proceed sudden and continual deaths, and monstrous
sicknesses, as proceeding from new causes. The contagion continues more or
less, according to the continuance and vehemency of the earthquake, and
cease not until the spacious extent of the heavens, and the agitation of the
winds has dissipated those venomous vapors.

CHAP. XXIX.
A consideration of an other accident a^ touching some that have become
insensate and stupid in these earthquaks.
IF a particular and slight fear makes those that are attainted therewith to
become senseless, and to run about like fools and desperate men, we need
not wonder, if at such time as the world has had an alarm, and Cities have
been sunk, whole peoples swallowed up, and the earth shaken, that some have
been seen tormented with sadness and fear, destitute of consolation, and
driven out of their wits. It is no gasing matter to have a good sense in
prosperity or adversity. And therefore the milder spirits have been
attainted with such fear, that they have swounded. There is no man afraid
that hinders not his health in some sort: and whosoever is attainted with
fear, resembles a mad man rather then any other, but some recover themselves
suddenly, other some remain troubled a longer time, and are as it were
transported. Thence comes it that during the war time there are found so
many fools running about the streets; and never meet we with so many divines
and soothsayers, as when fear intermixed with Religion, attaynteth and
seizes men's brains. I wonder not that during this earthquake, a statue was
divided into two parts, and that the earth it self was rent from the top to
the bottom. Some say that erst the fury of a storm,
(So much can age and tract of many years
Transform those things beneath in sundry sorts.)
Did separate two places, which at first
Were but one soil. The Sea pusht forth her waves:
And headlong floods by force surpassing measure,
Did rent the strong Sicilian shores perforce
From Italy and his fair Continent,
And severed with a straight and floating stream,
The fields and Cities from their former bounds.
Thou see that there is nothing permanent in the estates of Cities and
Peoples, when as one part of nature is moved by it self, or that a violent
wind agitateth some Sea. For the effert of the parts as well as of the whole
is maruailous. For although it rages in some parts, yet is it caused by the
forces of the whole. So has the Sea divided and torn Spain from Africa: and
by the same inundation, so much testified by the most famous Poets: Sicilie
has been separated from Italy. But sometimes those things have most violence
which come from beneath, for that is most furious that inforceth his passage
through streights: we have sufficiently declared both of the effects of the
earthquake, and of the maruailous events that have succeeded them.

CHAP. XXX.
How it may come to pass that a statue cleaves in two by earthquake.
WHy therefore should a man be amazed for this cause, that the brass of one
statue, which is neither solid, but hollow and thin, is broken? when as
happily the spirit that seeks issue is included in the same? But who is he
that knows not this? we have seen houses tremble, and the joints and the
timbers of the same open, and afterward close again; contrariwise we have
seen some buildings that were not well grounded at the first, and which the
Carpenters had carelessly joined together, which being agitated by an
earthquake, have united themselves together in a better sort. And if it riueth
in two, whole walls, and renteth wholehouses, and shakes the walls of whole
Towers which are solid, and ouer-turneth the foundations of the building, who
is he that can find any matter worthy of note, that a statue has been rent
from the bottom to the top? But why continued the earthquake for diverse days?
For Campania ceased not to tremble continually, Why the quaking continues
diverse days.
sometimes more mildly then at other times, but with great hurt: because the
earthquake shiuered that which had been ouer-turned and shaken, which finding
no stay or resting place, fell, and broke it self an^w. All the wind had not
as yet gotten issue, but had only delivered over a part whilst the stronger
part, that remained, labored to find issue.

CHAP. XXXI.
AMongst those arguments whereby it is proved that these things are done by
the wind: Why the first tremblings are almost the most violent.
thou may without all doubt set down this: when as there is a great
earthquake past, whereby Cities and Countries are destroyed: there cannot an
other follow the same that is equal with it, but after the greatest, the
lighter motions follow, because the most violent have given passage to those
winds that encountered one an other. The remainder of these winds cannot do
so much, and do not beat one upon another, because they have their way
already opened, and follow that way by which the greatest force is past.
Moreover I think that worthy memory which a learned and honorable personage
has observed, that being in the stoue to wash himself, he undoubtedly saw
the pauements and stones, wherewith the house was paued, separate themselves
the one from the other, and afterward reunite themselves, and the water eating
between the clefts, at such time as the tyles separared themselves one from
another; boiled and foamed between them both, at such time as they closed
themselves. I have heard the same man report, that he had seen soft things
tremble more gently and oftener, then those of hard and solid nature.

CHAP. XXXII.
ANd thus much, my Lucillius, the best of men as touching the causes. What
resolutions we are to g^ther from these earthquakes.
Now come I to that which will fortify our minds, where it more concerns to
be confident then to be learned. But the one is not done without the other.
For resolution is no otherways planted in the mind then by good arts, and the
cont^mplation of nature. For whom will not this accident fortify and confirm
against all others: why then should I fear a man or a savage beast? I am
exposed to far greater dangers. We are assailed by Rivers, by Lands, and by
the greatest parts of nature: we ought therefore to provoke death with a
mighty courage, whether he invade us by an equal and vast assault, The
principal is a resolute and assured contempt of death.
or by a daily and ordinary end: it makes no matter with what mask he be
covered, nor how mighty the engine is that he draws against us, that which
he demands at our hands is the least matter. This shall old age take from
us, this the pain of an ear, this the corrupt abundance of humors in us,
this meat which the stomach can hardly dis-j^st; this a foot but slightly
offended. The soul in man is but a small matter, but it is a mighty thing to
contemn the soul. He that contemns it shall with a quiet eye behold the
enraged seas, although all the winds have incensed the same, although the
stream with some perturbation of the world, turn and arm all the Ocean
against the earth. He shall securely behold the dreadful and horrid face of
the lightning-heauen. Although the heaven breaks it self, and mixeth his
fires to ruin both himself, and all that is under him. He shall securely
behold the yawning earth that riueth and renteth under him. Although those
infernal Kingdoms should be discovered, he shall dreadlesse stand in the
face of this confusion, and happily shall skip into the gulf, into which he
should fall. What care I how great the means be, by which I perish? when as to
perish is no great matter? if therefore we will be happy, if we would not be
vexed by the fear of men, of gods, or any things: if we would despise fortune
that promises us unnecessary things, and threatens us with trifles, if we
will live quietly, and debate for felicity with the gods themselves, we must
carry our souls in our hands: whether it be that ambushes would entrap, or
sickness assail, or the enemies sword threaten, or the noise of falling
Islands, or the ruin of the earth, or these great fires that consume Cities
and Countries do inuiron her, she will lay hold on, which soever of these
dangers she lists: what else should I do but exhort her in her departure,
and to send her away with all her goods? Go forth courageously, go happily.
Think it not strange to restore that which thou have received. The question is
not now of the things, but of the time. Thou do that which thou ought to
do at an other time: neither desire thou death, neither fear it, beware thou
step not back as if thou were to depart into some place of ^uil: Nature that
made thee, exspecteth thee, and a place far better and secure. There the
earth trembles not, neither the winds combat one with an other, and burst
the clouds with thundering noise, nor fire desolateth whole Countries and
Cities, nor the fear of whole Nauies sucked up by shipwreck, nor Armies ready
to give battle, nor a multitude of Soldiers running in fury to murder one
another, nor the plague, nor fires kindled here and there, to burn the bodies
both of great and small, into ashes. This is but a small matter: what fear we?
Is death a grievous matter? rather let it happen once, then threaten always.
Shall I be afraid to perish, when as the earth perishes before me, and those
things are shaken which shake others, and attempting to do us mischief,
offense themselves? The sea has swallowed up Helice and Buris wholly: shall I
be afraid for one little body? Ships sail over two Cities, yea two such as
we knew, which are reserved in our remembrance, by the means of that
discourse which has been published of them. How many other Cities, in great
number, have been swallowed up in other places? Miserable ^ffects caused by
the ouer-great apprehension of death.
how many Nations has either the earth or sea devoured. Shall I refuse mine
end, when as I know that I am not without end? yea when I know that all things
are finite: shall I fear the last breath or sigh. As much as thou can
therefore, my Lucillius, animate thy self against the fear of death. This is
he that makes us humble, this is he that disquieteth and confounds that very
life which he spares. This is he that makes these earthquakes and lightnings
greater then they be. All which thou will endure constantly, if thou think
that there is no difference betwixt a short and long time. They are hours which
we loose: put case they be days, months, years; we loose them because they
must be lost. What imports it, I pray you, whether I attain to such a year
or no? The time fleeteth away, abandoning those that desire it so much: neither
is that mine that either is to come or has been. I hang upon the point of
flying Time, and it is a great matter that it has been but a very moment. The
wiseman Laelius answered very elegantly to a certain man, that said, I have
sixty years of age; speak thou (says he) of these sixty which thou have
not? neither hereby understand we the condition of incomprehensible life, nor
the chance of time which is never our own, because we make account of the
years that are past. Let us fix this in our minds, and let us o^tentimes say
one unto an other, we must die: when? what carest thou? Death is the law of
nature; Death the tribute and office of mortal men, and the remedy of all
evils; whosoever fears it will wish for it. Setting aside all other things,
my Lucillius, meditate on this only, least thou wax afraid of the name of
Death; make him familiar with thee by continual meditation, that if the cause
require thou may step forth and meet it.

The End of the sixth Book of the Natural Questions.
OF NATVRALL QVESTIONS, WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA; DEDICATED TO
LVCILLIVS The seventh Book. Wherein He entreats of Comets.
CHAP. I.
THere is no man so slow, dull, and brutish, that li^teth not his thoughts to
behold divine things, Nouelty rauisheth us, ordinary matters are contemptible
unto us.
and fixes not his whole mind upon them, especially when as some new miracle
appears in the heavens. For as long as nothing appears but that which is
ordinary, custom takes away the greatness of things. For we are so
composed, that those things which we daily meet withal, pass by, although
they be worthy of admiration: contrariwise, we take a singular pleasure to
behold the smallest trifles, if they have any novelty in them. This assembly
therefore of stars, whereby the beauty of this immeasurable body is
distinguished, inuiteth not the people to behold them; but when as any thing
is changed in some extraordinary manner, all men's eyes are fixed on heaven: no
man gaseth at the Sun except it be in the eclipse: no man observes the Moon
except she be darkened. Then whole Cities cry out, and every one being
transported through vain superstition, fears in his own behalf. But how
far greater things are those, that the Sun (if I may so speak it) has as
many degrees as it has days, and firmeth the year by his course? that from
the solstice he presently inclines and gives space unto the nights, that he
hides the stars, that he burns not the earth being far more greater then
the same, but nourishes it by temperating his heat, by intentions and
remissions, that he never fills or obscureth the Moon but when she is
opposite unto him; yet respect we not these things as long as they continue in
their order. If any thing be troubled or appear contrary to custom, we behold
it, we inquire of it, we show it: so natural a thing is it to admire at the
newness, and not at the greatness of things. The application of this
curiosity to the consideration of Comets
The same falls out in Comets: if a rare fire appear, and of an unaccustomed
figure there is no man that is not desirous to know what it is, and forgetting
all other things he questioneth upon this new accident, not knowing whether he
ought to admire or fear. For many there are that will enkindle fear in other
men, and walk about and presage that this fire threatens some great
mischief. They enquire therefore, and would needs know whether it be a
prodigy or some star in the heaven. The modest s^rch and examination of
these fires is laudable.
B^t truly no man may either search after a thing more magnificent, nor learn
a thing more profitable, then what the nature of the stars and planets is.
Whether this contracted flame, which both our sight does affirm, and that
light which flows from them, and that heat that descends from thence; or
whether they are not flaming Orbs, but certain solid and earthly bodies,
which sliding through fiery tracts, draw their brightness and color from
them, not being clear of themselves. Of which opinion many great men were, who
believed that the stars were compact of a solid substance, and were nourished
by foreign fire: for their flame, say they, would fly away except it had
something that restrained it, and detained it, and being gathered and not
united to a stable body, undoubtedly the world by his storminesse had
dissipated it.

CHAP. II.
If Comets are of the same condition as other s^ars.
FOr the better inuestigation hereof, it shall not be amiss to enquire whether
Comets are of the same condition as the stars are. For they seem to have
something common with them, their rising and setting, their resemblance
likewise, although they spread and stretch themselves out longer: for they are
as fiery and bright as the other. But if all stars were terrestrial
exhalations, the Comets and stars should be alike: but if they be naught else
but pure fire, and continue six months; neither the continual turning and
swiftness of the heaven dissolueth them, they likewise may consist of a thin
matter, neither for all this be dissipated by the continual course of heaven.
To this point it appertains also to know if the heaven turns the earth
continuing fixed, or if the heaven is immovable, and the earth turns. For
some there were that have said that it is we whom nature insensibly turns
about, A Paradox of the m^t^on and turning of the earth about the heavens,
reu^ed in ou^ t^m^ by Copernicus.
and that the rising and setting is not by the motion of the heavens, but that
they rise and set. It is a thing worthy contemplation to know in what estate we
are, if the place wherein we abide be fixed or turned, whether God causes us
to turn, or causes all things to turn about us; but it is necessary for us
to have a collection and knowledge of the ancient rising of Comets: for as yet
their courses cannot be comprehended, by reason of their raritie, neither can
it be sought out whether they observe their courses, and some due order
produces them to their certain day. This observation of celestial things is
a nouelti^, and but lately brought into Greece.

CHAP. III.
DEMOCRITVS also the most subtlest amongst all the ancient Philosophers says,
The ancient natural Philosophers seemed over curious in observing comets
that he suspecteth that there are diverse stars that run, but neither has
he set down their number, nor their names, for as yet had he not comprehended
the courses of the five Planets. Endoxus was the first that brought the
doctrine of these motions out of Egypt into Greece, yet speaks he nothing of
Comets; whereby it appears that this part had not been sufficiently labored
and sought into by the Egyptians, who had been the most curious obseruers of
the heavens. After him Conon a diligent enquirer after these things, likewise
gathered that these eclipses of the Sun were observed by the Egyptians: yet
made he no mention of Comets, which he would not have forgotten, if they had
any ways made mention or given knowledge of them. Two only amongst the
Caldees, who are reported to have studied this science, Epigenes and Apollonius
Myndius a most cunning obseruer of the works of nature, differ amongst
themselves: for the one says that Comets by the Caldees are put amongst the
number of wandering stars, and that their courses are well known. But
Epigenes contrariwise says that the Caldees have no assured knowledge of
Comets, but that in their judgments they are kindled by some storm that is
agitated and stirred in the air.

CHAP. IIII.
IF first therefore thou think it meet, Epigenes opinion as touching the
meteors of fire.
we will set down their opinions and refell them: This man thinks that the
star of Saturn has the most force unto all the celestial motions. This
when as she presses the neighboring sign of Mars, or that she passes into
those that have a vicinity with the Moon, or falls into the beams of the
Sun, being by nature windy and cold, she closes and thickneth the air in
diverse parts. Afterward, if she has gathered into her self the beams of the
Sun, it thundereth and lightneth. If Mars favors her likewise, it
lightneth. Besides (says he) the lightnings have one matter, and the
fulgurations another; for the euaporation of the water, and all other things
which are moist, does naught else but move the lightnings, which do naught
else but move threatenings; neither succeeds there any other evil. But the
exhalation that mounteth from the earth, as being more hot and more dry
produces lightnings. But those beams and Torches which differ in no other
thing amongs^ themselves but in greatness, are made after this manner: when as
some globe of the air has enclosed moist and earthly things in that which we
call a ^torme; whithersoeuer it is carried it presents the form of an
extended fire, which continues so long as the complexion of that air has
remained, carrying in it self much moist and earthly matter.

CHAP. V.
An examination and distinct resutation of those opinions.
TO begin with the last lies: this is false that Torches and fiery beams are
expressed by a storm: for a storm is formed, and rowleth near unto the earth;
and therefore it pulls up shrubs by the roots, and wheresoever it inclines,
it makes the ground naked, laying hold in the mean space on woods and
houses, for the most part lower then the clouds, and yet never higher. But
contrariwise, the pillars appear in the highest region of the air, and
consequently they have never resisted the clouds. Furthermore, a storm
presses forward more violently beyond comparison above any other cloud, and
fulfilleth his course in a round. It likewise continues not long time, but
bursteth it self by his own violence. But pillars of fire neither rome, nor
fly over as Torches do, but abide in one place, and shine in the same part of
the heaven. Charimander also in that book which he wrote of Comets, says,
that Anaxagoras observed in the heavens a great and unaccustomed light of the
greatness of a huge pillar, and that it shined for many days. Calisthenes
testifies that there appeared the like resemblance of extended fire, before
that Buris or Helice were hidden by the sea. A^istotle says, that it was not a
beam but a comet; but that by reason of the excessive heat it appeared not to
be scattered fire, but in process of time, when as now it burned less, it
presented it self in the form of a Comet: in which fire there were many
things that were worthy to be noted, and yet nothing more then this, that when
it shined in the heavens, the Sea presently ouerflowed Buris and Helice. Did
not therefore Aristotle believe, that not only that, but al other beams were
Comets? This difference have you, that in the one the fire was continual, in
the other scattered: for pillars have an equal flame, neither intermitted or
failing in any place, and coacted in the uttermost parts thereof, such as that
was whereof I spoke of late, according to Calisthenes opinion.

CHAP. VI.
Two sorts of Come^s according t^ Epigenes, and of their causes.
EPIGENES says there are two sorts of Comets; the one on every side power forth
their heat, and change not their place; others extend their scattered fire in
one place like hair, and trauerse the stars, where two such have appeared in
our time. These former are crinite, and every ways likewise immovable, yet
are they for the most part lower, and composed of the same causes, as pillars
and torches are from the intemperature of the troubled air, which carries with
it self many moist and dry exhalations that are raised from the earth. For the
wind that slides through these straits may inflame the air above, full of
nutriment, fit for fire, and afterward drive it backward from the place where
it is calmest, for fear lest through some cause it should return and grow
fain^, and anon after should come to raise it self, and enkindle the fire
where it was. For we see that the winds after some certain days, return unto
the same place whence they first issued. The raines also, and other kinds of
tempests, return unto their point and assignation. But to express his intent
in a few words, he thinks that Comets are made in the same sort, as fires
that are cast out by storms; this only is the difference, that the storms
fall from on high upon the earth, and these fires raise themselves from the
earth unto the heavens.

CHAP. VII.
Many things are spoken against these; The wind is no cause of Comets, a^
Epigenes thinks.
first, if the wind were the cause, a Comet should never appear without
wind, but now it appears even in the calmest air. Again, if it were caused
by wind, it should fall with the wind: and if it began with the wind it
should increase with the wind, and ^he more fiery should it be, the more
violent the wind was. To this add that likewise: The wind impelleth many
parts of the air; but a Comet appears in one place: the wind mounteth not
up on high; but Comets are seen very high above the winds. After this he
passes over to those, which a^ he says, have a more certain resemblance of
stars, which go forward, and pass the signs in the Zodiaque. These, says
he, are made of the same causes as the other that are lower: in this only they
differ, that the exhalations of the earth, carrying many dry things with them,
ascend to the higher part, and by the North wind are driven into the upper part
of heaven. Again, if the North wind did drive them, they should be always
driven to the Southward, against which the North wind blows. But they have
diverse stations, some go toward the East, some toward the West, and all in
turning, which way the wind would not give. Again, if the violence of the
North wind, lifted them up from the earth unto the heavens, Comets should not
rise with any other winds; but they rise.

CHAP. VIII.
But now let us refell that reason of his (for he uses them both). All that
which the earth has exhaled, Storms are not the cause of Comets.
either dry or moist, coming to join in one, the discord that happens
between these bodies, makes the air become stormy. The vehemency then of
that turning wind enkindleth by his course, and rayseth up on high, that which
it holds enclosed in it self, and the brightness of the fire that is
enclosed dureth as long time as the exhalation, whereby he is entertained,
which beginning to decrease, the fire decreaseth likewise. He that said this,
considered not what the course of storms and Comets is. That of storms is
headlong and violent, and swifter then the winds: that of the Comets is more
mild, and no man can discover what way they make in four and twenty hours.
Furthermore, the motion of ^tormes is inconstant, scattered, and turning: that
of Comets is certain, and keeps one settled course. Would any one of us think
that the wind carries away, or that the storm causes the Moon to turn, or
else the five wandering stars? Nothing less in my judgment. And why? Because
their course is neither troubled nor suspended. Let us transfer the same unto
Comets. They move not confusedly or tumultuosly, so as any man should believe
that they are impelled by turbulent and inconstant causes. And again, although
these storms might embrace the exhalations of earth and water^ and afterward
lift them up from beneath vpwards^ yet should they not make them mount above
the Moon. All their carriage extends no farther then the clouds. But we see
that comets are intermixed with the stars, and slide along the superior parts.
It is not therefore likely, that in so great space a storm of wind may
continue, the which as it is most violent, the sooner takes it an end.

CHAP. IX.
The continuation of the refutation contained in the former chapter.
LEt him choose which of these two he li^t: if it be a light storm it cannot
descend from so high, if it be a violent and sudden storm, it will break it
self the sooner. Moreover, these lower comets mount not so high as some think,
by reason that they have more weighty matter then the rest. This weight
hinders them from mounting. Contrariwise, it must necessarily follow that the
comets that are highest, and are of longest continuance have a matter more
solid then the lower. They likewise could not continue longer except some more
stronger nutriment maintained them. I said not long since that a storm could
not endure long, nor raise it self above the Moon, nor as far as the stars:
for a storm is raised by a conflict of diverse winds one with another. This
conflict cannot be of long continuance: for an uncertain wind having strugled
with the rest, finally, the victory remains to that which is the strongest.
But no violent tempest lasts long. The more headlong the tempests are, the
less time and continuance have they: when the winds are in their full force,
they incontinently begin to decline, and it must needs be that by their more
earnest vigor they should tend to their dissolution. So then no man ever saw a
strong storm of wind continue longer then four and twenty hours, no not an
hour. The swiftness thereof is wonderful, and no less wonderful is the
shortness. Besides this, he turns with more greater violence and swiftness
about the earth: if it be high, it is less headlong, by reason whereof it
spreads it self. Add hereunto now, that if it raised it self above the
regions of the air, toward the heavens and stars, the motion of them, which
whirleth about the whole frame would dissolve and dissipate the same: for what
is it that turns more swiftly then the motion of heaven? When the force of
all the winds should be assembled together, and the solid and firm structure
of the earth likewise, this motion could dissipate all that, and consequently
in less then nothing, should make that parcel of intorted and confused air
to vanish.

CHAP. X.
He continu^^h his proo^e, that storms o^ the air cannot be the cause o^ the
enkindling of Com^ts.
FVrthermore, the fire carried up by the storm could not continue long, if the
storm continued not likewise: but what is more incredible then that a storm
should last long? For one motion is overcome by his contrary motion: for the
place above the airs has his motion that carries the heavens. And draws the
higher stars with swifter turn,
And whirles them round about.
And if thou grant them some remission, which can hardly be done in any sort,
what shall we say of comets that continue six months? Again, there should be
two motions in one place, the one of them divine and continual, accomplishing
his work without intermission, the other fresh and new, being shaken by the
storm. Of necessity therefore, the one must be an impediment to the other. But
the motion of the Moon and the course of the other Planets, which are above,
always observe their time, neither stop they ^uer, or stay they, nor gives us
any suspicion of intermission or let in their motion. It is an incredible thing
that a storm (which is a kind of tempest extremely violent and impetuous)
should mount as high as mid-heauen, and whirle it self amongst the spheres,
whose course is so peaceable and governed, Put case that a storm enkindleth a
fire, and drives it up on high, or that it ^ppeareth in a longer form, yet
think I that it must be such as that is which causes the fire. But the form
of a storm is round, for it turns in the same place, and is whirled about,
after the manner of a cylinder that turns and rouleth in it self: therefore
the fire that is enclosed therein must be like unto the same. But it is long
and scattered, and no ways like unto that which is round.

CHAP. XI.
LEt us leave Epigenes, and examine other men's opinions, which before I begin to
expound, Comets appear^ in diverse part^ of heaven.
this is first of all to be presupposed, that Comets are not seen in one part
of the heaven, nor in the Zodiak only, but appear as well in the East as in
the West, yea, and oft-times about the North. Their form is not one; for
although the Grecians have made a difference of those whose flame hangs down
after the manner of a beard, and of those which on every side of them spread
their light as it were hair, and of those whose fire extends and pours it
self out, but tends toward a head; yet are all these of the same note, and
are rightly called Comets, whose forms when as they appear after a long time,
it is a hard matter to compare them one with another. At that very time when
they appear, all those that behold them are not of the same opinion in
respect of their habitude, but even as each of them has either a sharper or a
duller sight; Their quality is judged by the obscurity or clearenesse of our
sight.
so says he that they are either cleerer or redder, or that their hairs are
drawn inwardly or scattered on the sides. But whether there be any differences
of them or no, yet must Comets be made by the same reason. One thing must
remain resolved, that it is an extraordinary thing to see a new appearance of
stars, that draw about themselves a scattered fire. Some one of the ancients
allow of this reason, when as one of the wandering stars adioyneth it self to
another, both their lights being confused into one, make an appearance of a
longer star: neither does this happen only at such time as one Planet touches
another, but also when they approach, for the space between them both is
enlightened and inflamed both by the one and the other, and makes a long fire.

CHAP. XII.
TO these we will answer thus; An answer unto those that think that Comets are
formed by the approach and incountry of two Planets.
that there is a certain number of moveable stars, and that at one time both
they and Comets are wont to appear; whereby it is manifest, that Comets are
not caused by their coition and meeting, but are created of themselves. It
oft-times happens that a star is found right underneath one of those which is
highest, and sometimes Saturn is above Jupiter, and Mars beholds in a right
line both Venus and Mercury. But for all this course and incountry the one
with the other, a Comet is not therefore made, otherwise they should be made
every year, for in every year some stars meet together in one sign, if one
Planet drawing near or above another, did make a comet, it should cease to be
in the same instant, for the Planets pass suddenly. And therefore is it, that
the eclipse of the Planets dureth not long time, because the same course that
brought them together carries them away swiftly. We see that in a very little
space of time the eclipses both of Sun and Moon take an end. Those of the
other Planets likewise which are less, ought likewise to continue less. But
there are certain comets that endure six months, which would not come to
pass, if they were produced by conjunction of two planets, which cannot long
time subsist together; but that the law of necessity must needs separate
them. Besides, these planets seem near neighbors one unto another, yet are
they separated by huge distances. How then may one planet dart out fire unto
another, in such sort as both of them seem but one, when as there is so great
a distance between them? The light (says he) of two stars is intermixed, and
present a form of one: in no other sort then when as by meeting with the
Sun, a cloud becomes red, as the euenings and the mornings are yellow, and
as sometimes or other we see the Arch of the Sun. All these first of all are
caused by great force: for it is the Sun that enkindleth these, the stars have
not the same power. Again, none of these appear but under the Moon, and
near unto the earth. The superior bodies are pure and sincere, and never
change their color. Besides, if any such thing should happen it should not
endure, but should be extinguished suddenly, as crowns are which begirt the
Sun or Moon, and vanish a little while after: neither does the Rainbow
continue long if any such thing were, whereby the middle space between two stars
should be confused, they would as soon vanish out of sight, or if it continued
it should not be so long as the comets endure. The planets shape their course
in the circle of the Zodiac, but the comets appear in all the parts of the
heaven. As touching the time of their apparition, it is no more certain then
the place wherein they are confined.

CHAP. XIII.
THis is alleged by Artemidorus against that which is said before, that not
only the five stars do run, An instance of Artemidorus to maintain his
opinion, and the answ^r to the sam^.
but that they are observed alone, yet that innumerable stars, that are
carried in secret, either unknown unto us by reason of the obscurity of their
light, or by reason of such a position of their circles, that then at length
they are seen when they are come to their period or end. Therefore, as he
says, some stars run between, which are new unto us, which intermix their
light with those that are fixed, and extend their fire far mort then other
stars are accustomed: this is the slightest of his fictions, for all his
discourses of the world are impudent lies: for if we believe him, the heaven
that we see is most solid, and hardened after the manner of a tyle, and of a
deep and thick body, which was made of Atoms congested and gathered
together. The next surface unto this is fiery, so compact that it neither can
be dissolved or vitiated, yet has it some vents and windows, by which the fires
enter from the exterior part of the heaven, which are not so large that they
may trouble it inwardly, whence again they steal and slip forth. These
therefore which appeared contrary to custom, flowed and had their influence
from that matter, that lay on each side of the world. To answer these
questions, what other thing is it, then to exercise the hand, and to cast a
man's arms into the wind?

CHAP. XIIII.
YEt would I have this man tell me who has laid such thick planchars on the
heaven, An exact refutation of Artemidorus hi^ Paradoxes.
what reason there is that we should beleeu^ him that the heaven is of this
thickness. What is the cause he should carry so many solid bodies thither, and
detain them there? Again, that which is of so great thickness, must needs be
of a great weight. How therefore may heavy things remain suspended in the
heavens. How comes it to pass that this heavy burden fails not, and
breaks not himself through his weight? For it cannot be that the force of so
great a burden, as he sets down, should hang and depend on so slight
stays. Neither can this likewise be spoken, that outwardly there are some
supporters that uphold it from falling; nor likewise that in the midst there
is any thing opposed, that might entertain or contain such an impendent
body. No man likewise dare be so bold as to say that the world is carried and
whirled about infinitely, and that it falls, but that it appears not whether
it fall or no, because the precipitation thereof is eternal, having no end
wherein it may terminate. Some have spoken thus of the earth, Another Paradox
enclosed in diverse absurdities.
when as they had found no reason why a weight should consist in the air; It
is always falling say they, but it appears not whether it fall or no,
because, that is infinite into which it falls. What is it then, whereby thou will prove that only five stars move not, but that there are many, and in
many regions of the world? Or if it be lawful to answer this without any
probable argument. What is the cause why some man should not say, that either
all the stars are moved or none? Again, that troop of stars that wander here
and there, help thee nothing. For the more they be, the oftener should they
fall upon others: but comets are rare, and for this cause are wonderful.
Moreover, all ages will bear testimony against them, which have both observed
the rising of those stars, and have communicated them with posterity.

CHAP. XV.
AFter the death of Demetrius King of Syria, the father of Demetrius and
Antiochus, Examples to approve t^^t one Comet cannot be made of diverse
wandering stars.
and a little before the war in Achaia, there appeared a comet almost as
great as the Sun. In the beginning it was a circle of red fire, sparkling with
so great light, that it surmounted the obscurity of the night. Afterward this
greatness began to diminish, and the brightness thereof to vanish. Finally,
the Comet was wholly spent. How many wandering stars, think you, should have
been joined together to make so great a body? Although a thousand had been
reduced into one Mass, yet could they not reflect so much light as the Sun
does. During the reign of Attalus a Comet was seen, which in the beginning
was but little, but afterward it increased, and extended, and lengthened out
it self as far as the Equator, in such sort as it equalled (so long was the
extent thereof) that part of the heaven which the Astronomers call the
Milke-white way. How many wandering stars should there have been gotten
together, to occupy with a continual fire so long a tract of heaven?

CHAP. XVI.
The shameless error aod absurdity of some Historians, taxed, and namely of
Artemidorus.
WE have spoken against the argument, now must we say somewhat against the
witnesses: we need not labor much to empouerish the authority of Ephirus, he
is an Historian. Some men get commendation by relating of incredible matters,
and excite the Reader by some miracle, who would do some other thing else, if
he were but entertained by ordinary matters. Some are credulous, and some
negligent, some are circumuented, Against Historians in title, and liers in
effect.
and some pleased with lies: the one avoid them not, the other desire them. And
this is common of the whole Nation, which as he thinks cannot approve his
work; neither that it will be passable and vendible, except it has some
aspersion of lies. But Ephirus, a man of no religious honesty or faith, is
oft-times deceived, and oftentimes deceives: as in this place, because when as
in this Comet, which all the world observed, drew after it the event of a
mighty matter, when as upon the rising thereof it drowned Helice and Buris, he
says that it divided it self into two stars, which besides himself no man
testifies. For who is he that could observe that moment, wherein the Comet was
dissolved, and divided into two parts? And how if there be any man that has
seen a Comet divided into two, is there no man that has seen it made of two?
And why added he not into what stars it was divided, whereas it must needs be
some one of the five Planets.

CHAP. XVII.
The examination of Apollonius Paradox, that there are many wandering Comets.
APOLLONIVS MINDIVS is of a contrary opinion, for he says that a Comet is not
made one out of diverse erraticall stars, but that many Comets are erraticall.
It is not a false appearance, nor an extended fire, by the vicinitie of two
Planets, that makes a Comet: her form is not restrained in a round, but more
high, and extended in length: yet has it no manifest course, for it trauerseth
the highest part of heaven, and when as she is at the lowest of her course, she
is not seen. Neither are we to think that we saw the same in Claudius time,
which appeared in Augustus days, nor that which appeared under Nero Caesar,
which has enobled all the rest; was like unto that which appeared about the
eleventh hour of the day, when as men celebrated the sports of mother Venus,
after Julius Caesar had been murdered. There are diverse Comets of diverse
sorts, of different greatness and dislike in color: the one are red, without
any clearenes, the other white, and of a pure and clear brightness, the other
flaming obscurely, and environed with thick smoke. Some are bloody, hideous,
which presage nothing else but murders and massacres. These either lessen or
increase their light, as other celestial fires do in descending and
approaching more near unto us, they show more clear and more great: less and
more obscure in remounting, because they withdraw themselves further off.

CHAP. XVIII.
HEreunto we forth with answer, A difference between Comets and other
celestial fires.
that the same falls not out in Comets, that happens in other Celestial
fires. For Comets, the very first day they appear are at the greatest. But
they should increase the nearer they draw unto us: but now their first
appearance continues until such time as they begin to be extinguished.
Again, that which was answered to the first, may be answered to this man
likewise: if a Comet were a Planet, and had his course, it should be moved
within the bounds of the Zodiake, in which all other Planets shape their
course. For never does a star appear by a star. Our sight cannot penetrate
through a star, to see through it, what is under it. But men see through a
comet, as through a cloud, that which is underneath, whereby it appears that
it is not a star, but a light fire that is gathered in have.

CHAP. XIX.
ZENO the Stoique is of this opinion, Zenoes opinion according with Apollonius.
supposing that the stars do rank themselves, the one of them near unto
the other, and intermix their beams, where there follows an appearance of a
long star. By this reckoning diverse think that there are no comets, but that
by reuerberation of the stars, which are one of them near unto the other, or
by the conjunction of them that entertain one another that is caused, which
has such or such appearance of a comet. Some maintain that there are^ but
that they have their particular courses, and at the end of certain years they
appear. Some other accord also that there are; but deny that they ought to be
called stars, because they diminish by little and little, and continue not
long, and vanish, as it were, in an instant.

CHAP. XX.
Diverse of our coat and sort are of the same opinion, Senecaes opinion hereupon.
neither think they that it repugneth against the truth: for we see diverse
sorts of fires that are formed in the air, and sometimes the heaven on fire,
sometimes long streams of flame, then burning torches carried away swiftly,
with a large fire: the lightnings also, although marvellously sudden, in an
instant dazzle the eyes, and leave there fires proceeding from the air, that is
crushed and violently beaten together. Therefore resist they not, but being
expressed, flow, and forthwith perish. Other fires continue long, and vanish
not, except first of all that aliment that nourished them be consumed. In this
rank are those miracles that are written by Possidonius, burning pillars and
bucklers, and other fiery impressions, notable by reason of their novelty,
which would not astonish men's minds, if they appeared according to custom and
nature. All men are amassed that behold these, and be it that any fire either
shine or shoot, be it that pressing the air, and by setting it on fire, it
subsisteth, and is reputed for some novelty, every one gazeth thereat, and
supposes it to be miraculous. What then? Has not the heaven sometimes opened,
and a great clearenesse has broken forth of the cauitie. Thou might
exclaim: What is this? I see the heaven depart it self in twain
And scattered stars from thence shine forth again.
Which sometimes have shined before the night was expected, and have broken
forth at midday, but there is another reason hereof, why they appear at an
unusual time, which that they were, it is manifest even then, when they were
hidden. We see not many comets that are obscured by the Sunne-beames, in whose
Eclipse, as Possidonius testifies, there appeared a Comet, which the
neighboring Sun had hidden. For oftentimes when the Sun sets, there are
certain scattered fires seen not far of him: the cause is, because the
greater light is spread in such sort over the lesser, that it may not be seen:
But Comets escape the Sunne-beames.

CHAP. XXI.
That which the Stoiques teac^, as touching Comets.
SO then the Stoickes hold that the Comets, such as are torches, trumpets,
pillars, and other such wonders in the heaven are created of thick air. And
therefore appear they most often in the North, because in that place there is
found much weighty air. Why then is not a Comet fixed, but goes forward?
After the manner of fires, it follows that which nourishes it. For although
by nature he inclines upwards, yet when it wants matter, it declineth into
that air, according as the matter thereof tends or bends it, either to the
right or left part. For it has no way, but such as the vain of that which
nourishes it leads it, thither creeps it; neither shapeth she her course
as a star, but is fed as fire is. Why then appears it a long time, and is
not quickly extinguished? For that we beheld under the happy government of
Nero, was seen for the space of six months, shaping a course altogether
opposite to that which appeared in the time of Claudius. Of two Comets that
appeared in the time of Claudius and Nero.
For that rising from the North upwards, declined toward the East, always
more obscure. This began in the same part, but bending toward the West,
declined toward the Southward, and then vanished out of sight. That in
Claudius time had a quarter more moist, and more fit for inflammation, which she
followed. That in Neroes time had a more spacious and furnished extent. They
therefore descend thither, whither the matter that maintains them draws
them, and not their way: which appears to be diverse in those two which we
beheld, whereas the one moved toward the right hand, the other toward the
left. But all stars have their course in the same part, that is to say,
contrary to that of the heavens, which turns from the East to the West, and
the stars quite contrary: they have therefore a double motion, that of their
own, and that of the heavens, that carries them.

CHAP. XXII.
I Am not of the Stoiques opinion, The examination o^ the Stoics opinion.
for I think not that a comet is a sudden ^ire, but that it i^ to be r^puted
amongst one of the eternal works of Nature. First of all^ whatsoever the air
creates, are of short continuance, because they are made of a fleeting and
mutable subject. For how can any thing subsist long time in the same sort in
the air, when as the air it self never remains like it self? It does
nothing but turn and flow, and has very little rest. In a moments space it is
changed into another state then it was in before: now is it fair, now rayny,
then inconstant between both, for clouds are familiar with it^ into which he
gathers himself, and from which he is dissolved, which now ass^mble
themselves, suddenly scatter, and never continue at rest. It cannot be that a
settled ^ire should take his situation in a body so fleeting, and should clea^e
unto it so obstinatly, as if nature had so appropriated it, that it should
never be separated from it. Moreover, if it always remained annexed to that
which en^^rtaineth the same, it should never descend: for the nearer the air
approaches to the earth the thicker it is, and never does a comet descend as
far as the lower re^^on of the aire^ neither approaches so near unto the
earth. The fire likewise mounteth thither, whither his nature carries him, that
is to say, on high, or thither, whither the matter to which it cleaves, or
that it feeds, draws him.

CHAP. XXIII.
NO ordinary and celestial fires have an oblike way. The difference between
stars and Comets.
Circular motion is the property of the stars, yet know I not whether any other
comets have done the like^ tw^ in our age have don(...) that which is kindled
by a temporal cause is quickly (...). So do torches burn in passing by, so
lig^^nings (...) force for a flash, so those stars that are called transuerse
and falling, (...) cut the air; no fires have continuance but in their own
fire. Those divine ^tars speak I of, which shall continue as long as the
heaven it self, because they are parts and the workmanship there^f. But these
do something, they go, they infallibly follow their courses, and are equal.
For they should every other day become greater or less (if there fire were
gathered and collected) suddenly enkindled upon some cause: for it should be
lesser or greater, accordingly as it should be abundantly or sparingly
entertained. I said of l^te that there is nothing continual which is inflamed
by the corrup^ion of the aire^ now add I further, That which is enflamed by
the corruption of the air cannot subsist.
it neither can abide or stand by any means. For both a torch, and lightning,
and a shooting star; and whatsoever fire is expressed by the air, stays not
in a place, neither appears but whilst it fa^leth. The comet has her siege,
whence she is not so soon chased, but she finisheth her course in measure,
and is not extinguished suddenly, but vadeth by little and little: if it were a
wandering star, says he^ it should be in the Zodiake. Who se^^^^h one limit
for the stars? Seneca seems to incline in some sort to this opinion, that a
Comet is some kind of wandering star.
Who drives divine things into a strait? The Plane^s which thou only think
have motion, have diverse circles. Why therefore should there not be others,
which might have a way proper and peculiar from that of the Planets? what is
the cause that the heaven is inaccessible in some place? If thou think that
no Planet may pass the Zodiake, I say that a comet may have his circle so
large, that in so^e place he may enter into the Zodiaque. This is not
necessary, but it may be.

CHAP. XXIIII.
The reasons that move him to produce this Paradox.
COnsider whether this becomes not the greatness of heaven b^tter that it be
divided into several courses, then to imagine one only circle wherein all the
Planets have their course, and that the rest remain unprofitable and idle.
Beleeuest thou that in this so great and ^aire body, amongst innumerable
stars, which by their diverse beauty adorn and distinguish the night, nor
suffering the air to remain vo^de and improfitable, that there should be but
only five stars, to whom it should be lawful to exercise themselves, whilst
all the rest stand, like a fixed and immovable multitude? if any man enquire
of me in this place, why therefore is not the course of these as well observed
as of those five stars? To him I will answer, that we grant that there are
many things, but what they are we know not. All of us will confess, that each
of us has a soul, by whose command we are impelled, and revoked: but what
this soul is which is the Ruler and Governor over us, every man is as far
from telling thee, as he is uncertain where it is. Some will say that it is a
spirit, an other that it is harmony. That Man, a divine thing, and like unto
God; This Man, a very subtle air, and that other, an incorpor^all faculty:
neither will there want some that will call it blood; othersome, heat. So that
a man cannot know the truth of other things, who as yet has not the perfect
knowledge of himself.

CHAP. XXV.
That there is som^what more i^ Comet^ then in other Meteors of ^i^e.
WHy wonder we therefore that the Comets (which are a rare spectacle of heaven)
are as yet unrestrained under certain laws, and that neither their beginnings
nor endings are known, having not their return, but after a long space of
time? There are not yet a thousand and five hundredth years past since Greece
Numbered and named the light-some stars.
and many Nations are there at this day who know not the heaven but by sight,
that as yet are ignorant why the Moon fails, or suffers an eclipse: And
these things amongst us likewise have been lately reduced to a certainty. The
time shall come that these things which are now hidden shall be discovered by
Time, and the diligence of future Ages. One Age is ouer-short to seek out
these secrets, and a man's whole age is required to be spent in the
contemplation of heaven. Is it not a misery for us that we divide this little
time we have to live, One A^e cannot know all things.
between serious and frivolous occupati^ns? There shall be diverse ages
therefore that shall clear these difficulties: The time shall come wherein our
Posterity shall wonder that we were ignorant of so manifest things: we have
learned not long since in what time those five Planets, which we perceive, do
rise and set, or stay, why they go directly on, or recoile backward, and which
holding so different courses, constrain us to be curiou^: Not many years
since it has been showed vs^ if Jupiter rises, or sets, or is retrograde;
for so it is said, when he retireth. There have been some that have said unto
us: you err, that judge that any star either suppresseth or turns his
course. Celestial bodies have their motion, neither can they be auerted, they
all go forward, as soon as they are sent, they go. They shall be no more
when they cease to move. This eternal work has irreuocable motions: which if
they should at any time s^ay, the one should be confounded in the other, where
as now the same tenure and equality conser^eth them.

CHAP. XXVI.
WHence comes it then that certain Planets seem to be retrograde? Of the
retrogradation of certain Planets.
The course of the Sun imposes on them this appearance of slow motion,
besides, the nature and site of their courses and circles in such sort, that at
sometimes they deceive their sight that behold them. In this sort, ships that
sail with a fore-winde seem not to stir: The day will come when some one
shall show us in what parts the Comets wander: why they observe so different a
course from other stars, To maintain his opinion he answers to an obiec^ion
that is made, that the Comets are more nearer the earth then the Planets and
that they are of another form.
what and how great they are: We content our selves with those things that are
found: Let those that succeed us manifest the truth likewise for their parts^
We see not, says he, any thing that is underneath the Planets. Our eyes pierce
the Comets. First, if this be so, it is not in that part where the celestial
body is of a thick and solid fire, but there, where there is a brightness
more rare, and in that part where the hairs are scattered. Thou see through
the spaces of the fires, and not through them. All stars (says he) are
round, all Comets are extended, whereby it appears that they are no stars:
but who will grant thee this, that Comets are long? whereas naturally
according as other celestial bodies are, they are formed round, but it is
their brightness that extends it self. Even as the Sun spreads his
beams far and near, and yet has another form then that which proceeds
from his beams: so the bodies of Comets are round, but their light appears
more long, then that of the other stars.

CHAP. XXVII.
WHy (say thou?) Tell me first why the Moon receives a different light
from that of the Sun, Another answer of Senecaes, to the objection, that
there is a difference between the light of the Comets and Planets.
when as she receives the same from the Sun? whence is it that she is
sometimes red, and sometimes pal^? For what cause has she a leaden and dark
color, when she is excluded from the sight of the Sun? make me understand
why all the stars have a different appearance the one from the other, and
have no resemblance with that of the Sun. But as nothing hinders them to be
stars, although they resemble not, so nothing hinders the Comets from being
eternal, and of the same condition that the stars are, although they have
not the same appearance. And why? the world it self, if thou consider the
same, is it not composed of diverse parts? whence is it that the sun is
always burning in the sign of Leo, and scorcheth the earth with excessive
heat, and that in Aquarius he calls on the Winter, and causes the Rivers to
freeze? All this is but one sun, although his nature and effects are diverse:
within a short time after, he rises in the sign of Aries, and slowly steals
on in that of Libra, yet both the one and the other sign is of the same
nature, although that in the one there is swift motion, and in the other slow
progress. See thou not how contrary the elements are the one unto the
other. They are heavy and light, cold and hot, moist and dry. All the
harmony of the world is composed of discords. Thou denyest that a Comet is a
star, because the form of the one is not answerable to that of the other.
For thou see how like that star is that ful^illeth his course in thirty
years, to that which finisheth his within the space of twelve months, nature
frames not all her works upon one mold, but glorifieth her self in her
variety. She has made some bodies greater, some more swift then others, some
more violent, and some more tempered: There are some she has drawn^ from the
troop, to the end they should march apart and in sight, other some has she
put into comp^nie: he is wholly ignorant of the power of nature, that thinks
not that it ^s lawful for him to do that sometimes which he does often. She
shows not Comets ordinarily, she attributes them an other place, other
times, and different motions from the rest: By these Comets he would embezzle
the ^xcellencie of his work and the face of the Comet is more fair, then that
it should be esteemed casual; whether it be we observe their extent, whether
their more clear brigh^nesse, and more ardent then others. But their face has
some worthy and notable thing in it, for it is not restrained and locked up in
a narrow roome^ but is more large and spacious, and that comprehends that
which diue^s stars embrace.

CHAP. XXVIII.
Presage of Comets.
COmets signify tempest, as Aristotle says, and the intemperature of winds
and raynes. Think thou then that that which presageth a thing to come is not
a star? For this is not in such sort a sign and presage of tempest as that
is of rain, when Where boiling oil does crack, and rotten mushromes grows.
Or as it is a sign that the sea will rage, When Morcheus sport upon the dryer
coast,
And leave the marshes where they haunted most:
And mounting hence forsakes his watrie shroudes,
And soars aloft above the highest clouds.
But thus as the Equinoctial presageth heat or the cold of the year, that
runs as the Chaldies say, that the star that governs on the birthday,
setleth and presageth the good or evil hap of men. But to the end thou may
know that this is thus, the Comet threatens not the earth with wind and rain
suddenly, as Aristotle says, but makes all the whole year suspected: whereby
it appears that a Comet has not suddenly drawn presages to reflect them
upon that which she meets withal, but she has them in reservation, and
comprehended by the laws of the world: The Comet that appeared during the
Consulship of Paterculus, and V^piscus, accomplished that which was foretold by
Aristotle and Theophrastus: For there were great and continual tempests every
where. But in Achaia and Macedon the Cities were ruined by earthquake. Their
slow motion (says Aristotle) shows that they are weighty, and have much
earthly exhalation in them: Their course likewise for almost ordinarily they
are pushed toward the Poles.

CHAP. XXIX.
BOth the one and the other is false, Senecaes opinion of that which is
contained in the former Chapter.
I will first speak of the former, why those things that are carried more
heavily are more weighty? what then? Is the Planet of Saturn, which of all
others shapeth his course more slowly, heavy? But it is a sign of leuitie in
it, that it is above the rest. But she goes about with a longer compass, in
the month more slowly, but longer then the rest. Remember thy self that I may
say as much of Comets, although their course be more slow. But it is a lie to
say they go more slowly, for this last has trauersed the half of the heavens
in six months space: The former shaped his course in less time. But because
that Comets are weighty, they are carried more low. First, that which is
carried circularly, has not a course in straight angle. Afterward, this last
began his motion in the North, and came by the West unto the South, then
raising her course vanished. The other under Claudianus appeared first in the
North, and ceased not to raise it self continually on, and until it was
extinct. Hitherto have I proposed other men's reasons, or mine own, in respect
of Comets: which, whether they be true or no, the Gods know, who have the
knowledge of truth. For us it is lawful to censure and conjecture upon them in
secret only, not with any confidence to find them out, but yet with some hope.

CHAP. XXX.
ARISTOTLE speaks worthily, The use of the doctrine of Comets.
that we ought never to be accompanied with more modesty, then when we speak
of the Gods: if we enter the Temples with a good countenance; if we approach the
Sacrifice with abased eyes; if we cast our gowns over our faces; if we
compose our behavior in the most humblest sort that may be: how much more
ought we to do this when we dispute of fixed and wandering stars, and of the
nature of the Gods; avoiding carefully all rash, impudent, light, foolish,
lying, and malicious speech? neither let us wonder that those things are
discovered lately, which lie hidden so deeply. It must needs concern
Panaetius and those, Senecaes answer to Panaetius as tou^hing Comets.
that deny that a Comet is an ordinary star, affirming that it is but a
vain appearance to entreat more exactly, if every month of the year be
equally apt to produce Comets; if every Region of the heavens be fit to
entertain them, if they may be conceived every where, whereas they may wander:
and other questions, all which are taken away, when I say that they are no
casual fires, but interlaced in the heavens, which they bring not forth
frequently, but move them in secret. How many things are there besides Comets,
that pass in secret, and never discover themselves to man's eyes? How God ought
to be considered.
For God has not made all things subject to humane sight. How little see we
of that which is enclosed in so great an Orb? Even he that manageth these
things, who has created them, who has founded the World, and has enclosed it
about himself, and is the greater and better part of this his worke^ is not
subject to our eyes, but is to be visited by our thoughts.

CHAP. XXXI.
Of the weakness of man's judgment in the consideration and knowledge of
Celestial things.
THere are many things besides, that are near unto the divinity, and have a
power that approaches near unto it, which are hidden, or happily which thou will more wonder at, have filled our eyes, and fled from them, be it that their
subtilitie is so great, as the apprehension of humane understanding cannot
reach thereunto, or that so great a majesty remains hidden in so sacred a
retreat, governing his Kingdom, that is himself, without suffering any thing
to approach him, but the soul of man: We cannot know, what this thing is,
without which nothing is; and we wonder if some small fires are unknown unto
us, whereas God which is the greatest part of the world, is not subject to our
understanding? How many living creatures have we first known in this world?
and many things likewise are there, that the people of succeeding age shall
know, which are unknown unto us. The wonders of the world are discovered from
age to age.
Many things are reserved for the ages to come, when as our memory shall be
extinguished. The world is a little thing, except all men have somewhat to
observe in it. Those things that are sacred are oftentimes taught. The
Eleusians always reserve some novelty, to show unto those that revisit them.
Nature discovers not her secrets at once: we think that we are exercised in
them, but we are but poor Nouices. Things that are so hidden, are not the
subjects and objects of every man's eyes: they are enclosed and shut up in his
most retired sacrarie. The ages wherein we are shall see somewhat, the
succedent another part: why therefore shall these things be brought into our
knowledge. The greatest come slowly, especially when we cease to travel after
them. That which we wholly endeavor in our minds, we have not yet effected,
which is to be most wicked: vices are but yet a learning: dissolution has
found some novelty whereupon he may mad himself and doat. Impudicitie has
attracted some new thing to defame her self: The pomp and vanity of this
world has invented I know not what, more dainty and delicate then was
accustomed, to confound it self: We are not as yet sufficiently effeminate,
but extinguish by our disguises all that which remains of virtue: we will
outstrip women in their vanities; we that are men, attire our selves in
colors like Harlots, which modest Matrons would be ashamed to think upon: We
Bride it in our walks, and tread upon tip-toe; we walk not, but slip along.
Our fingers are laden with rings, Disorders not of Senecaes age but ou^s,
wh^rein pride want^th no ornam^nt.
and there is not a joint that has not a precious stone: We daily invent, I
know not what, to violate and vitiate manhood, and to defame it, because we
cannot shake it off. One has cut off his members, another has retired
himself into the most shameful and infamous place in the Theater, and being
hired to die, is armed with infamy. The poor man likewise has found a
subject, wherein to exercise his infirmity.

His Conclusion is such, that he complains of the contempt of Philoso^hie,
and the affectation of vanities, which if it be not a misery of this time, let
every wise man judge.
CHAP. XXXII.
WOnderest thou that wisdom has not as yet attained her perfection?
Iniquity is not yet wholly discovered. She is but newborn, and we bestow
all our labor upon her, our eyes and hands are at her service. Who is he that
se^keth after wisdom? who judges her worthy any more but a superficial
knowledge? who respects Philosophy or the liberal study thereof, but when
the Plays and Pastimes are put down, or when it rayneth, or when a man
knows not how to loose the time? Therefore is it that so many schools of the
Philosophers are empty. The old and new Academique have no Reader left them:
Who is he that will teach the precepts of Pyrrhon. The school of Pithagoras,
whose scholars were so envious, finds not a Master. The new sect of the
Sextians more powerful amongst the Romans, then any other, having begun with
great vehemency, is extinguished in his infancy. Contrariwise, what care is
there had that the name of some famous stage player should not be obscured. The
families of Pylades and Batillus, two famous Players, continues by
successions, there are diverse Scholars and a great number of Professors in
those sciences. Privately through the whole City their Pulpit sounds: hither
men and women trot. Both husbands and wives contend which of them shall be
nearest, afterward having lost all shame under their maskes, they enter into
Tauernes, caring in no sort what becomes of Philosophy. So far are we
therefore from comprehending any of those things, which the ancients have left
in obscurity, that for the most part most of their inventions are forgotten.
But vndoubt^dly, when we shall travel with all our power after it, if sober
and modest, youth would study this, if the elders would teach this, and then
younger learn it, yet scarcely should they sound the depth of it, where truth
is placed, which now we seek with idle hands and above the earth.

The End of the seventh and last Book of the Natural Questions.
OF THE REST AND RETIREMENT OF A WISEMAN. WRITTEN BY LUCIUS ANNAEVS SENECA.
The Argument of IVSTVS LIPSIVS.
I Know not whether this be a Book or an Epistle, yet is it to be severed from
the book of blessed li^e, with which it has no correspondence. Neither know I
when it was written, yet is both the matter and the handling thereof good and
learned. The question was, Whether it were lawful for a Wiseman to live
prinately and retired from the Commonweal? It was debated amongst the
Stoickes, who by consent called men thereunto. He maintayneth the affirmative,
and the beginning of this book is missing, that which is extant intends thus
much. He says by the example of the chiefest of the Stoiques, that this is
both just and usual, who although they sent some unto the Commonweal, yet
went not. But that some embraced honest repose, even from their youth, other
some in their later days retired thither, like old soldiers that had already
deserved their wages. But that honest repose is in the studies of wisdom, and
contemplation of Nature. He adds this, that these are pleasing both to the
Stoics and Epicures, but with some slight difference, because the one do
purposely seek out the rest, the other upon occasion; Namely, if the
Commonwealth be desperately corrupted, if a man have small authority and
favor; likewise if he he infirm and sickely. He concludes that even in
retirement the Commonweal is handled, which he makes double, the lesser and
the greater; the one is concluded and comprehended in certain bonds and laws,
as the Athenian or Roman Commonweal: the other is the whole world it self,
whereof nature has made us Citizens. The greater, a wiseman both manageth and
handles even in his rest and retirement, either by writing or teaching. This
did ZENO and CHRISIPPVS, and more profited they mankind then the labors and
discourses of all active men.

OVT OF THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
THe Circi by all men's consent, commend vices unto us, although we attempt
nothing else that is profitable for us, yet shall it profit our selves first of
all to retire our selves into our selves: the better shall we be every one of
us in retiring our selves apart, and why is it not lawful for us to retire our
selves to those that are the best men, and to choose some pattern whereby we
may direct our lives? which may it not be done in retirement? Then may a man
build on that which is the best, when no man comes between, that may wrest
the judgment which as yet is but weak, by the assistance of the people. Then
may the life march onward with an equal and settled pace, which we make
unprofitable by contrary deliberations: for amongst all other evils this is the
worst, that we change our vices into other vices, in such sort, as we have not
that power over our selves to continue in one vice, which is already familiar
unto us: we grow from one unto another, and cause our selves to be tormented
daily after some new manner. This likewise vexes us, that our judgments are
not only depraved, but slight and vain: we fluctuate and comprehend one thing
by another, we leave that which we have wished for, and run after that which
we have forsaken. In brief, there is a perpetual turn and return between
our desire and our repentance. For we depend wholly on other men's advice, and
that seems the best in our judgment, which is desired and praised by the
most, and not that which we ought to desire and esteem. Neither estimate we
the good or evil way by it self, but only by that which is most beaten,
wherein every one throngeth after another. Thou will say unto me, What do
thou Seneca? Thou forsakest thine own part. Truly the Stoickes say thus: We
will be in action even until the last term of our lives, we will not desist
to seek out common good, to help every one, to assist our very enemies, and
to labor with our hands: we are they that give not any vacation to our years,
and who, as an eloquent man says, hide our white hairs under our helmets. We
are they amongst whom it is so hard a matter to find any tract of idleness
before death, that (if the occasion offer it) even in our death we employ our
selves more then ever. Why talkest thou unto us of the precepts of Epicurus
amidst the very principles of Zenoes Doctrine? If thou be aggrieued, and moved
by following one party, why forsakest thou them not honestly and courageously
without betraying them? Behold what for the present I will answer thee;
Requirest thou any more at my hands then this, that I endeavor to resemble my
Masters and Conductors? What therefore will thou do? I will tract that path
which they lead me, and not that way which they send me.

CHAP. XXIX.
NOw will I approve unto thee that I forsake not the precepts of the Stoics,
for they themselves have not departed from them, and yet might I be very well
excused, although I followed not their precepts but their examples. This which
I say, will I divide into two parts: in the first I will show how any man may
from his infancy addict himself entirely to the contemplation of verity,
seek and exercise apart, the means how to order his life well. In the second,
how in his old age he may fashion other men, and make them virtuous. Herein
will I follow the custom of the vestall Virgins, which divide and order their
age in such sort, that they may learn first of all to understand their
ceremonies, and then to practice them, and finally to teach them unto others.

CHAP. XXX.
I Will also show that this is approved by the Stoickes, not that I am
constrained to do nothing that repugneth against the saying of Zeno or
Chrisippus, but because the dispute permittes me to incline to their advice;
and to follow always the opinion of one alone, is to offer injury to the
rest. Gladly would I wish it that all things were already understood, and that
truth should be discovered and confessed by all men, we would not then change
the opinions of the Stoics: but now we seek the truth with those men that
teach the same. There are two great sorts that differ in this thing, the one of
the Epicures, the other of the Stoics; but both of them send a man to his
repose, but the truth is that the ways are different. The Epicure says, That
a wiseman shall not have access to the Commonweal, except some accident
happen that drives him thereunto. And Zeno says, That he shall have access
to the Commonweal, except there be somewhat that retayneth him. The one
seeks repose of set purpose, the other upon occasion and cause. But this
cause extends very far, if the Commonweal be so desperate as it cannot he
helped, if it be possessed with mischiefs. The wiseman shall not labor in
vain, neither hazard himself, knowing that it will be but lost time,
especially if he have little credit and less forces, and that the
Commonweal be so sick, that it neither can nor will give him access or
audience. Even as a weak and consumed man will not enrowle himself to go
unto the wars; and as no man will lanch a Ship into the Sea that leaketh, and
has watching tymbers: so a wiseman will not cast himself into a way where
there is neither entry nor any issue whatsoever. He then that has all his
commidities in their entyre, may stay in the haven, and addict himself readily
to good occupations, rather then make sail and to go and cast himself athwart
the winds and waves; in brief, the disciple of virtues may embrace this happy
repose, wherein the most peaceable men have license to maintain themselves.
This is required at each man's hands, that (if he may do it) he profit diverse,
at leastwise some, if not his nearest; or if he cannot, at leastwise himself.
For when he makes himself profitable to others, he procures the common good.
As contrariwise, he that makes himself worse, first of all hurts himself,
then all those whom he might assist had he been a good man. So then he that
behaueth himself well in his own respect, does hereby profit others, because
he prepares them the means whence they may reap profit.

CHAP. XXXI.
LEt us imagine two Commonweals, the one great and truly public, the which
comprehends both gods and men: wherein we cannot confine our eye within this
or that limit, but we measure the extent of the same with the Sun: and the
other, that where Nature has caused us to be borne. This shall be either
Athens, or Carthage, or some other City, which appertains not unto me, but
to certain men only. Some men at one time serve both these Commonweals,
other some the lesser only, and some other the great, and not the less. We
may in repose serve this greater Commonweal, and I know not whether better in
contemplation then in action, as if we enquire what virtue is, or if there be
but one or diverse; whether it be nature or study that makes men virtuous:
whether there be but one world that comprehends the seas, the firm lands,
and that which is enclosed within them: or if God has created diverse worlds,
if the matter whereof all things are made, is continuate and complete, or in
parcels: if there be void intermixed amongst those things that are solid: if
God only beholds his work, or if he manage and governs it: if he be spread
about the same, and not enclosed, or if he be infused into all creatures: if
the world be corruptible or incorruptible, and to be numbered amongst those
things that have end. What service does he to God, that beholds and
considers these things? It is to that end, that the works of God should have
such a man for a witness. We say usually that the sovereign good is to live
according to nature, which has brought us into this world, both for
contemplation and action. Let us now approve that which we have said
heretofore.

CHAP. XXXII.
THis shall be well approved, if every one ask himself how great desire he
has had to know unknown things, and how much he listeneth attentively to all
fables that are recounted unto him. Some travel by sea, and expose themselves
to the dangers of a long voyage, under hope to know some hidden things, and
which few other men have seen. The like desire assembleth the people in the
Theaters. This compels us to search out hidden things, and to search out
those things that are secret, to turn over antiquities, and to examine the
customs of foreign Nations. Nature has given us a curious mind, and knowing
the excellency of her art and secret, has created us to be beholders of
things so excellent. But she had been frustrated of her intention, had she
discovered in secret, works of so great, so apparent, so exquisitly labored,
so proper, and of so diverse beauties. But to the end thou may know that she
would be beheld every ways, and not covertly or slightly consider where she
has lodged us. She has placed us in the midst of her self, and has given
us the ouer-view of every thing, and has not only created man upright: but
also to the end he might behold the rising and setting of the stars, and carry
his eyes on every side; she has raised his head, and planted it upon his
neck, which boweth and turns at his pleasure. Afterward she has produced
six signs for the day, and six for the night, and has left no part of her
undiscovered, to the end thereby that she might present them to the eye, and
enkindle a desire in him to behold the rest. For we see not all things and as
touching those things which appear unto us, we see them not in their
greatness: but our sight in searching them makes way, and planteth the
foundations of the truth, to the end that inquisition may pass from those
things that are manifest to those that are obscure, and find somewhat more
ancient then the world it self. As, where these celestial bodies come, what
was the estate of the world, before the parts thereof was disposed, as now they
be: what reason has discovered those things that were drowned and confused,
who has assigned places unto things; whence comes it, that those things that
are weighty, are by their nature inclined downwards; and those things that are
light mount up on high: if besides the force and weight of bodies, some higher
power has imposed a law on al those things; if that be true, and which is more
justifiable, that a man is a part o^ God, and that they are, as it were,
sparkles which that holy fire has caused to fall upon the earth, and that
remain enclosed in this foreign place. Our thought breaks through the
bulwarks of heauen^ neither is contented with that which is showed unto it. I
search, says he, that which is beyond the world, whither it be a deep void,
or some great extent enclosed, yet notwithstanding within certain bounds. What
is the habitude of those things that are excluded from our world, if they be
informed and confused: if in every part they have equal place, if they be
ordered to some use, if they are belonging to our world, or far estranged from
it, and whirleth about in the void^ if they be individual, whereof all things
created are to be made, or if their matter entertaineth them, and is every way
mutable: if the elements are contrary the one unto the other, or if they be
not at discord, but by diverse means entertain one another. Being borne to
seek out these things. Consider how small a time man has received, although
he employ himself wholly herein, although he permit no man to distract him,
and were careful to husband well every minute of an hour, without losing one:
although he lived longer then any other, without touch of any cross or
disaster whatsoever, yet is he over mortal, and of to small continuance to
attain unto the knowledge of eternal things. So then I live according to
Nature, if I addict my self wholly unto her, and admire and reverence her. But
her will is that I should intend to contemplation and action. I do both the one
and the other, for contemplation is not without action. But we must see (say
thou) if thou have disposed thy self thereunto, to this end only, to reap
the pleasure without searching any other thing, then a continual contemplation
and without issue; for this contemplation is a sweet and very attractiue
thing. To this I answer thee, that it imports as much as to demand, with
what affection thou addictest thy self to a politic and active life? If it
be to travel always, and without ceasing, in such sort as thou never raisest
thy self from the consideration of humane things to divine? Even as it is
unlikely that a man can desire things, or do any work, except he first of all
have some science in his soul, and some love of virtue (for these things
desire to be mixed together, and compared the one with the other) so virtue,
which is idle and without action, is an imperfect and languishing good, which
never makes show of that which she has learned. Who will say that a virtuous
man ought not to assay in action how much he has profited? Dare any man
maintain that he ought to meditate only on that which he ought to do? Is he
not tied also ^o exercise his hand sometimes, and to bring that which he has
meditated to a true effect. What if the delay be not in the wi^eman himself,
if there wants not an actor, but such things as are to be acted. What, will thou permit him to be with himself? With what mind does a wiseman retire
himself? To the end he may know that he will act somewhat by himself that may
profit posterity. Undoubtedly we that are Stoikes do maintain that Zeno and
Chrisippus have done more in their solitude, then if they had conducted Armies,
exercised public charges, established laws: for they have proposed worthy
lessons, not only to a Commonweal, but to all mankind: why therefore should
not such repose become a good man, by means whereof he governs the ages to
come, and instruct^th not only a small assembly of people, but teaches all men
that are living at this day, and that shall come hereafter into the world? In
brief, I ask if Cleanthes, Chrisippus, and Zeno, have lived according to
their precepts? I assure my self that thou will answer me thus, that they
lived so, as they said, men were to live, but none of these governed a
Commonweal. But thou may reply, that they had not either the means, or
qualities that were requisite in them that are admitted to the government of
public affairs. And I say for all that, that they lived not without doing
somewhat, but have found the means to make their solitude more profitable unto
mankind, then other men's endeavors and labou^s. So then they have done much,
although they have done nothing in public. Besides, there are three sorts of
life, amongst which, there is a question which is the best. The one intends
pleasure, the other contemplation, the third action. First of all, laying aside
all contention, and that irreconciliable hatred that we have denounced against
those who are of a contrary opinion to ours: let us see if these three manners
of living do not iumpe in one, although they appear under diverse titles. He
that approves pleasure is not without contemplation, and he that is
contemplative enjoys some pleasure; and he that addicteth himself to the
active life, has not wholly forsaken the contemplative. There is a great
difference (say thou) whether that be one thing which a man proposes, or a
dependence of some proposition; undoubtedly a great difference, and yet the one
cannot be without the other. Neither is he without action, who is
contemplative, neither does the other do any thing without contemplation. The
third likewise; whom ordinarily we make worst account of, appears not an idle
pleasure, but that wherein he confirms himself by reason. So this
voluptuous sect likewise is in action. And why should it not be in action? When
as the Epicure himself says, that he will sometimes retire himself from
pleasure, and long after pain, if either penitence attend pleasure, or a
lesser grief be taken for a more grievous. Whereto tends this discourse? To
show that a contemplative life is pleasing unto all men. Some seek after the
same, it is our place of rest and not our part. Add hereunto now, that
according to the precepts of Chrisippus, a man may live without travel, not to
addict himself unto idleness, but make choice of a commodious repose. The
Stoiques maintain that a wiseman will beware lest he meddle with affairs of
estate. But what skilleth it how a wiseman come unto repose, is it because the
Commonweal forsakes him, or he forsakes the Commonweal. If the
Commonweal should leave every one there (as she searches not those who
seek her in despite.) I ask you to what Commonweal a wiseman should
retire himself? Shall it be to Athens? In which Socrates is condemned, and
from whence Aristotle fled, for fear he should be condemned? whence envy
smothereth all virtues? Thou will grant me this, that a wiseman should not
retire thither: if he should go and live in that of Carthage, troubled with
continual seditions, enemy of their liberty who are good men: where equity
and goodness are basely prised, where enemies are rudely and cruelly
entreated, and where citizens themselves are pursued as enemies. He will fly
that place likewise. If I should represent other unto thee, I should not find
one that might support a wiseman, or be supported by a wise man. And if we
find not this Common-w^ale, which we imagine, the repose begins to be
necessary for all. Considering, that that alone which might be preferred
before repose, is found in no part. Put case that some one say, that it is good
to embark, but that we must not make sail upon that sea, wherein ships are
drowned ordinarily, and which is agitated with sudden gusts, which carry away
the most expert Pilots out of their course: I think that such a one forbids
me to weigh anchor, although he praises the Navigations.

The End of the Book of a Wise-mans rest and retirement.
CERTAIN COLLECTIONS GATHERED OVT OF SENECAES Books.
Of Poverty.
COntented poverty, as the Epicure says, is an honest thing, but it is not
now poverty, if it be content. He that agrees well with his poverty is a
rich man: he is poor that desires much, not he that has little; for what
profits it a man to have much in his coffer, to hoorde up much in his barnes,
to feed much cattle, and lend much upon usury, if he thirsts after another
man's fortunes, if he desire not those things which are gotten, but such as are
to be attained? Askst thou me what measure there is in riches? First, to have
that which is necessary; secondly, that which is sufficient: no man can be
possessed of a peaceable and contented life, that tormenteth himself much
about the enlargement thereof. There is no good whatsoever that profits him
that possesses the same, except that which we are addressed and willing to
loose. By the law of nature the greatest riches are but a composed poverty.
But know thou what bounds the law of Nature has allotted us? Not to be
hungry, not to be a thirst, not to be cold. To satisfy and assuage thy
thirst thou have no need to attempt the Seas, nor follow the wars: the thing
that nature desires is easily gotten, and readily s^t before thee. We sweat
for superfluities. They are those that wear out our apparel, that compel us
to wax old, that drive us upon foreign forces: it is at hand that may
suffice us. If a man suppose not that which he has to be ample enough,
although he be Lord of the whole world, yet is he miserable. Wretched is he
that judges not himself to be most blessed, although he command not the whole
world: he is not happy that thinks not himself happy. Let us have nothing
which may be taken from us, to his great profit that would lay hold thereof:
let there be very little in thy body that may be taken from thee. There is no
man, or very few at leastwise, that thirst after man's blood for murther-sake
only. The thief passes by the man that is naked, the poor man has peace in
a way beleagred with thieves. He has most fruit of his riches that wants
least. If thou live according to nature, thou shall never be poor; if
according to opinion never rich: nature desires a little, opinion a great
deal. If thou be laden with as many goods as diverse rich men possess, if
beside these particular riches fortune raise thee to honors, covers thee
with gold, cloatheth thee in purple, brings thee to such a height of
delights and riches, that thou couerest the earth with marble pillars, that not
only handlest gold and silver, but treadest upon it, that besides all this
thy chambers be garnished with statues and pictures, and all that which cunning
could represent, either rare or exquisite in gold or silver: these things will
teach thee to desire more greater. Natural desires are finite, they that
spring from false opinion have neither end nor measure: for falsitie has noe
limit, truth has some end; error is infinite. Retire thy self therefore from
these vanities, and when thou would know whether thou have a natural or
vain desire, behold if it stay in any part or no: if having gone far onward
thou always find somewhat farther off to be achieved, know that this is
not natural. That poverty which is exp^dite, is secure. When the allarum is
sounded, she knows that she is not sought after: when the army is commanded
to dislodge, she seeks how to issue, not what to carry with her. But if she
must make ^aile, the haven has no noise in it, the shores are not pestered
with many attendants. A troop of men attend her not to nourish, when she need
not wish for the felicity of for^aine countries: it is an easy matter to feed
a few bellies that are well governed, and desire naught else but to be filled.
Hunger is satisfied with a little, but excess with much: poverty is content
to satisfy her instant desires: well advised is that rich man, that having
great store of riches, possesses them as things that may be taken from him.
What moves thee then to refuse such a one for thy companion; whose manners a
discreet wiseman does imitate. If thou will govern thy mind well, either
thou must be poor, or like unto a poor man. Thou can not study any thing
that may profit thee except thou have a care of frugalitie, and this
frugalitie is a voluntary poverty. Whole armies have diverse times been
destitute of all things, the soldiers have fed upon roots and herbs, and
have suffered famine too loathsome to be spoken. And all this have they
suffered for a Kingdom, and which thou will wonder at more, for another man. Is
there any man that will doubt to endure poverty to deliver his mind from
these furious passions? Many in obtaining worldly riches, have not seen ^he
end of their miseries, but only the change. Neither wonder I hereat. The fault
is not in the riches, but in the mind it self. That which made poverty seem
tedious unto us, will make our riches burdensome likewise. Even as it skilleth
not whether you place a sick man in a wooden or a golden bed; for whether^
soever you shall carry him he bears his sickness with him: so it matters
not whether a sick mind be in riches or in poverty; for his mischief
follows him. We have no need of fortune to live securely: for whatsoever is
necessary she will give, although she be displeased. For fear she find us
unprepared, let poverty be familiar with us: we shall be more securely rich,
if we know how easy a thing it is to be poor. Begin to accustom thy self to
poverty. Behold my guest to set thy wealth at naught,
Resembling God in nature and in thought.
There is no man more worthy of God then he that has contemned riches. And
therefor I hinder thee not from the possession of goods, but this would I
effect, that thou should possess them without fear; which thou shall
attain unto by this one meane^, if thou hopest that thou likewise shall live
well without them, and beholdest them as things that are transitory. Let him
pass who follows not thee, but something that is in thee. For this cause
only is poverty to be beloved, because it discovers by whom thou art
esteemed: it is a great matter not to be corrupted with the fellowship of
riches. Great is that man who is poor in his riches. No man is borne rich.
Whosoever enters into this world is commanded to content himself with bread
and milk. Kingdoms come not to seek us so far. Nature requires bread and
water. He that has these is not poor; and if he boundeth his desires in
these, he shall contend with Jupiter in felicity: felicity is a disquiet
thing; she tormenteth her self, she distempereth the brain in more then one
sort. She provoke some to brave it, some to counterfeit gravity, some she
makes proud, othersome she humbles. If thou will know how little evil there
is in poverty, compare the countenance of a poor and rich man, one with the
other: the poor man laugheth more often, and more heartily, he is shaken with
no care, he is above the tempests of this world. His care passes over like a
slight cloud: their mirth (who are called fortunes minions) is fained: their
grievous and intolerable pride, although not openly is inwardly their torment,
and so much the more grievous, because that sometimes they have not liberty to
be publicly miserable. But amongst those disgusts that torment and swell up
their hearts, they are enforced to counterfeit their happiness: riches,
honors, powers, and such like, which draw us from the right, which in men's
opinion are precious, but i^ effect vilde. We know not how to praise those
things, whereof we ought not to determine according to common report, but
according to the nature of the things themselves. These things have nothing
magnificent in them, that may allure our minds unto them, except this, that
we are accustomed to admire them. For they are not praised because they are to
be desired, but because they are desired. This precedent cause have riches:
they change the mind, they breed pride and arrogancy, they draw on envy,
they so far estrange the mind that the fame of the money delights us,
although it be harmful unto us. All good things ought to be without fault, they
are pure, they neither corrupt nor solicit the mind, yet they extol and
delight men's minds, but without any pride. Those things that are good make men
confident, riches make men audacious. Those things that are good, give us
greatness of mind, riches insolency.

OTHER COLLECTIONS.
Of the remedies of casualties.
ALthough thou art fully possessed with all the flowers of Poesy, yet debated
and resolved I with my self at length to dedicate this little work unto thee^
concerning casual remedies, which the precedent times speak not of,
posterity shall respect. From whence therefore shall w^ first take our
beginning? If thou think it fit from death, What, from the last? Yea, from
the greatest. Hereat mankind does most especially tremble; neither without
cause in thy judgment do they so. All other fears leave some place after
them, death cutteth off all things. Other things torment us, but death
deuoureth all things. The issue of all that which we fear and are affrighted
at, after they have long time followed us and attended us, have their period in
this: yea, even those who think they fear nothing, yet notwithstanding are
afraid of death. All other things which we fear may find some redress or
solace. So therefore form and conform thy self, that if any man threaten thee
openly with death, thou may delude all his threats and slight fears.

Thou shall die: this is man's nature, and not his punishment^ Thou shall die:
upon this condition entered I the world, that I must leave it. Thou shall die^
it is the law of Nations to restore that which thou have borrowed. Thou shall
die^ life is but a pilgrimage, when thou have travailed long ^hou must return
home. Thou shall die: I thought thou would tell me some news; to this end I
came into the world^ this I do, every day conducteth me thereunto. Nature when
I was borne forthwith prefixed me this limit: why should I be displeased
herewith? I am sworn to obey her. Thou shall die: it is a foolish thing to
fear that which thou can not auoyde^ He escapes not death that deferreth
it. Thou shall die: neither the first nor the last; many have gone before me,
and all shall follow me. Thou shall die: this is the end of all that I ought to
do; what old man would not be glad to be exempted from service? Whither the
world passes thither shall I pass. To this end are all things created. That
which began must have an end. Thou shall die: nothing is grievous that
happens once. I know that I must pay that which I owe. I have contracted with
a creditor that will not loose his debt. Thou shall die: there can be no better
news, or more happy threat to mortal men.

But thou shall be beheaded^ what care I whether I die by the stroke, or by
the stab? But thou shall have many strokes, and thou shall see diverse swords
unsheathed against thee. What matters it how many the wounds be^ there can no
more but one be mortal.

Thou shall die in a strange country. The way to death is in every place. I am
ready to pay that which I owe. Let the creditor ^e^ to it^ where he will
arrest me. Thou shall die in a strange country. There ^s no ^arth that is
^trange to him that dies. Thou shall die in a strange country. Sleep is no
more grievous abroad then it is at home. Thou shall die in a strange country.
This is to return into a man's countr^e without provision.

But thou shall die young. It is the best that may befall a man to die before h^
wishes it. This is the only thing that concerns the young, as well as the
old. We are neither cited according to our revenues or years. The same
necessity of destiny constrains both young and old. It is best for a man to
die, when he has a desire to live. Thou shall die young. Whosoever comes to
the last period of his destiny, di^th old. For it skilleth not what the age of
man is, but what his term is. Thou shall die young. It may be that Fortune
retireth me from some great mishap, and if from naught else, at leastwise from
old age. Thou shall die young. It skilleth not how many years I have, but how
many I have received. If I cannot live longer, this is mine old age.

Thou shall lie unburied. What other thing shall I answer thee, but that of
Virgils.

Slight is the loss of sepulture.
If I feel nothing, I need not care whether my body be burned or no, and if I
be sensible, every sepulture is a torment.

Heaven couers him that has no pointed tomb.
What matters it whether fire or wild beasts consume me, or the earth which is
the sepulture of all things? This to him that has no sense, is nothing, and to
him that has feeling a burden. Thou shall be unburied. But thou shall be
burned, but then drowned, but then imprisoned, and locked in a tomb, but thou
shall rot, and be embowelled and sowed up, or cast into the hollow of a stone,
which shall consume and dry thee by little and little. There is no sepulture,
we are not buried, but cast out. Thou shall not be buried. Why art thou afraid
amiddest thy most security. This place is out of fear and danger. We are
indebted much unto life, to death nothing. Sepulture was not invented for the
dead sake, but for the living, to the end that our bodies, which in sight and
smell are most loathsome, should be hidden from our eyes: some the earth
ouerwhelmeth, some the flame consumes, some are shut up in stone, that will
return nothing but bones. We spare not the dead, but our own eyes.

I am sick. The time is now come wherein I must make proof of my virtue. A
confident man not only discovers himself upon the sea, and in the battle,
but virtue approves her self even in the bed. I am sick. This cannot
continue for an age. Either I shall leave mine Ague, or mine Ague will leave
me. We cannot be always together. The question is betwixt me and sickness,
and either he shall be conquered, or I overcome.

Men speak evil of thee. But evil men. It would move me, if Marcus Cato, if
Lelius the wiseman: if the other Cato, if the two Scipioes spoke these things.
In this time it is a matter praise-worthie to displease the wicked. That
sentence can have no authority, where he that is condemned does condemn. Men
speak evil of thee^ It would move m^, if they did it upon judgment, but now
they do^ it upon infirmity. They sp^ak^ not of me, but of them^elues. Men
sp^ake evil of thee, they do it therefore because they cannon speak well.
Not because I deserve it^ but because they are accustomed unto it. For there
are some dogs of that nature^ that they bark rather upon custom then
cur^^nesse.

Thou shall be banished: thou art d^^ciued when I have done all that I may, I
cannot pass out of my coun^rey. All men have one country, and out of this no
man may wander. Thou shall be banished, I am no^ fo^bidden my country, but the
place. Into whatsoever country I come, I come into mine own. I can be
banished into no place, for it is my country. Thou shall not be in thy
country. That is my country wheresoever I live well. But to live well is in
the man, and not in the place: In his power it i^ what his fortune shall be.
For if he be wise, he trauell^th; if a fool, he is banished. Thou shall be
banished: thou say thus. Thou shall be a citizen in another City.

Sorrow is at hand; if it be slight, let us endure it, patience is an easy
thing to support. If it be grievous, the glory is the greater. Let pain
extort cries, so h^ express not secrets. A man cannot resist pain, neithe^
pain reason. Pain is a tedious thing, nay rathe^ thou art effeminate. Few men
could endure pain. Let us be one of the few. We are weak by nature. Def^me
not Nature, she created us strong and valiant. Let us fly pain. And why?
Know thou not that he follows those that fly from him?

Poverty is grievous unto me, nay, thou unto poverty. The error is not in
poverty, but in the poor man. S^ee is ready, joyful, and assured. I am
poor. I in opinion, but not in truth. Thou art poor, because thou think
thy self so. I am poor. The birds want nothing. Tame beasts live their time,
wild beasts find food in their solitude.

I am not powerful, be glad, thou shall not be impotent. I may receive an
injury. Be glad, thou can not do any. He has great store of money. Iudgest
thou him to be a man, it is hi^ means? Who enuieth a treasury or full
coffers. And this man, whom thou supposest to be master of this money, is but
the bag that shuts it up. He has much. Whether i^ he covetous or prodigal:
if covetous, he has nothing: if prodigal, he shall have nothing. This man,
whom thou supposest to be happy, is often sad, does often sigh. Many accompany
him. Flies follow after honey; Wolves after carrion; Ants after wheat. This
troop follows their prey, and not the man. I have lost my money. It may be
it would have lost thee. I have lost my money, but thou hadest it. I have lost
my money. Thou shall be no more in so great danger. I have lost my money. how
happy art thou, if thou have lost thy covetousness with the same. But if she
remain with thee, yet art thou happy in some sort, because thou have neither
wood nor oil to cast into so horrible a fire. I have lost my money. And thy
money has lost and spoiled an infinite number of men. Thou shall be now more
light to walk on thy way, and more assured in thy house. Thou shall neither
have nor fear an heir. Fortune has disburthened thee, if thou conceiue^t the
same, and settled thee in a more secure place. Think thou it to be thy wrong?
It is thy remedy. Thou weepest, thou wailest, thou criest, as if thou were
undone, because thy riches have been taken from thee. It is thine own fault
that this loss does torment and touch thee so near. If thou had possessed
them as things that might perish, thou would not torment thy self thus. I
have lost my money, another had lost it before, to the end thou should have
it.

I have lost my sight. Night and obscurity has her pleasures. I have lost my
sight. From how many desires art thou exempted? How many things shall thou
want, which rather then thou should see^ thou thy self would pluck out
thine eyes. Knew thou not that bodily blindness is a part of innocence? The
eye discovers unto one man and adultery, to another incest, to this man a
house which he desires, to that man a town; in brief all sorts of
mischiefs. Undoubtedly, the eyes are the stinge of vices, and the guides of
wickedness.

I have lost my children. Thou art a fool to bewail the death of those that
are mortal. Is this a nou^lti^, or a thing to be wondered at? Is there any
house exempt from this accident? Call thou a tree miserable, whose fruit
falls to the ground whilst his branches mount aloft. Thy child is thy fruit.
No man is exempt from these^ strokes, untimely funerall^ are led as well out
of the Arti^icers shop, as the Kings Palace. Destiny and age have not the
same order. A man departs not out of the world in the same sort as he
entered. But why art thou vexed? What has happened contrary to thy hope.
Those that ought to die are dead. Yet could I have wished that they might have
lived. But no man promised thee thus much. My children are dead. They had them
who had greater right unto them then thou? They were only lent thee. Fortune
left thee them to bring them up, she has retained them, and has taken away
nothing but her own.

I have suffered shipwreck. Bethink thee not what thou have lost, but what
thou have escaped. I came naked to the shoare^ But thou gottest to land. I have
lost all: but thou might have been drowned with the rest.

I fell into the hands of thieves. But another man has met with detractors,
another with thieves, another with coseners^ The way is full of dangers.
Complain not thou that thou have met with them, rather rejoice that thou art
whole and in safety. I have grievous enemies. Even as thou seek out means
to defense thy self against the fury of savage beasts, and the venom of
serpents^ so see thou fortify thy self with some succors against thine
enemies, by means whereof thou may repulse them or repress them, or which
is more assured and better, make thy self gracious in their eyes.

I have lost a friend. It is true then that thou had one. I have lost a
friend. Seek out another in some part where thou may find him. Seek
amongst the Liberal Sciences, amongst those occupations that are just and
honest, in the shops of Artificers. This treasure is not sought out at the
table. Seek out some one that cares not for good cheer, but is frugall. I
have lost my friend. Show thy self to be a brave fellow, if thou have but lost
one, blush; if an only friend: why trustedst thou to one anchor in so great a
tempest.

I have lost a good wife. Did thou find her good, or make her good? If thou
foundest her by chance, thou may hope to light upon the like. If thou made
her good, hope well: the pattern is lost, but the craftesmaster is living. I
have lost a good wife. What allowedst thou in her? Her chastity? How many
women are there found, that having maintained their honor a long time, have
lost it at last? Was it her modesty: how many have bin numbered in the rank of
most honest matrons, that afterward were scoulds and railers? Were thou
delighted in her loyalty? How many of the best wives have we seen prove
noughts, of the most diligent, the most dissolute. The minds of all unskillful
persons, especially women, is subject to inconstancy. If thou had a good
wife, thou could not maintain that she would always remain in that
estate. There is not any thing so inconstant and unassured as the will of
women. We know the divorces of ancient matrimonies, and the brawles of married
couples, more hateful then divorces. How many are there that having
affectionately loved their wives in their youth, have forsaken them in their
age? How oftentimes have we laughed at the divorces of old and married folks?
How manies noted love, has been changed into more notable hatred? But this
was both good, and would have continued good had she lived. Death is the cause
that thou may boldly maintain this. I have lost a good wife, if thou
seek none but a good wife, thou shall find her. Provided that thou study
not about the antiquity of her race, nor on her worldly possession, which men
prise now adays more then Nobility. Beauty annexed to these, will make
headlong time against thee, but thou shall not have so much labor to govern
a mind that is puffed up with any vanity. A woman that is too proud of her
self, will make small reckoning of her husband. Marry with a maid, or that is
well brought up, and not tainted with her mothers vices. A maid that bears
not her fathers and mothers bequest at her cares, that is, not laden with
Rings and Jewels, nor clothed in such apparel, as cost more then she brought
unto her marriage. Nor that causes her self to be drawn in her Coach through
the City, and to behold the people as boldly, and on both sides, as would her
husband. Nor such an one for whom thine house will seem too little to contain
her carriage and equipage: Thou shall work that maiden according to thy mind,
which has not as yet been corrupted by those dissolutions that are in
request. I have lost a virtuous wife. Art thou not ashamed to weep, and to
call thy loss intolerable? But well, thou must know this, if thou bewailest
thy wife or no. In remembering thy self that thou art a husband, remember also
that thou art a man. I have lost a good wife. A man cannot recover a good
mother or a good sister, but a woman is an accessarie good, and is not reckoned
amongst those which every one cannot meet with but once in his life time. I
have lost a good wife. I can name thee many men, that having bewailed a good
wife, have met a second far better then the first.

Death, banishment, pains, sorrows, are no punishments, but tributes which we
must pay unto this life. Destiny sends no man out of this world, without
giving him some stroke. Happy is he that esteems himself such, and not he
who is esteemed such by others. But consider that this happiness is rare in this
world. It has near unto it misery, and borrows something of it.

The end of SENECAES Works.
A Table wherein SENECAES Paradoxes and other Stoicall vanities are set down,
to the end that such as are of weakest judgment and apprehension, may both
know, and be more circumspect in judging of them.
1 IT is a thanksgiving for a benefit when a man receives it with a good
will. 2 The virtuous child does more good unto his father, then he has
received from him. 3 Of the names of God, and if so many presents as he
bestows us, should be as many names as a man might bestow upon him. 4 Thou
art not to think that there are but seven wandering stars, and that the rest
are fixed. 5 The wicked and the foolish man is not exempt from any vice. 6 Of
the power of God. 7 That sometimes we ought not to recompense the good turn
which we have received. 8 The wiseman satisfies the rich man for the gold and
silver he offers him by one refusal. 9 Whether a man may give unto himself,
and requite himself. 10 That no man is good, wicked, or ungrateful. 11 All
men are ungrateful. 12 If a wiseman may receive a benefit, and pleasure from
another man, considering that he is Lord of all things. 13 Of diverse sorts of
benefits. 14 Of the resemblance and difference betwixt God and good Men. 15 If
Jupiter would fix his eyes upon the earth, I think that he might not see any
thing more fair, then Cato was at such time as he slew himself. 16 Of fatal
destiny. 17 One and the same necessity enchaineth both Gods and Men. 18 Death
is in the power and will o^ a man to kill himself, and to depart out of this
world when he thinks fit, without expecting the good will and pleasure of
God. 19 The rich man cannot be rich except he be poor. 20 Remedies against
diverse accidents of this life. 21 Our infirmities may be healed, and nature
which has created us to tend unto good, aideth us when we desire her to
become better. 22 Why mournest thou? on which side soever thou turnest thy
self, there is the end of thine evils. 23 Mercy or compassion is an
imperfection of the soul of affections. 24 If a wiseman pardons. 25 Of
happy Life, and of perfect Virtue. 26 Wherein consists the sovereign good.
27 The praise of that Epicure who cut his own throat. 28 That a wiseman ought
not to intermeddle with affairs of estate. 29 Of an imperfect and perfect
wiseman. 30 Death is neither good nor evil, for that may be either good or
evil which is something, but that which is nothing, and reduces all things to
nothing, neither subiecteth us to good or to evil. 31 Of the purgation of the
soul above us, where she makes a little stay to cleanse her self from the
spots that remain in her. 32 Of the end of the world, and of the resolution of
souls into their ancient elements. 33 Of the creator of all things, and of
the immutable succession of things that are enchained the one within the other.
34 Death is not a punishment, but the ordinance of nature. 35 Jupiter after the
consummation of the world, all the gods being derived into one, and nature
reposing her self a little, shall content himself with himself, and shall
govern his thoughts. 36 It is a great misery to be contrained to live, it is
no constraint to be constrained to live; there is no man that may be hindered
from ^orsaking this life. 37 Dying we are worse then we were when we were
borne. 38 Of two sorts of Wisemen. 39 God dwells in every good man, but we
know not what God he is. 40 Think thou for the present what I call a good
man? He which is imperfectly: for the other which is perfectly wise appears
not but by chance one time in five years, as the Phaenix and we ought not to
be abashed, if the generation of great things requires a great distance. 41 Of
the source of disorder which is in the soul. 42 The short life of a Wiseman
has as much extent for him as the long life of God. There is likewise
something wherein a wiseman marches before God, which is that God is wise by
the benefit of nature, and not by intention and diligence. 43 We deceive our
selves to think that life follows death, when as death had gone before, and
life follows it. 44 If the soul of a man being hidden under the ruins of a
Tower or Mountain, cannot be delivered from the body, nor find issue, but
spreads it self incontinently through all the members, because she has no
free issue. 45 If by reason of continual pain i^ be lawful for a man to
murder himself. 46 Of perfect virtue in this life. 47 Of the equality of
vertues^ and wherein lies their difference. 48 Of reason and the sovereign
good. 49 Of the behavior of a wiseman in death. 50 If it lie in our own
power to dispose of our lives as we please. 51 Of the Stoics wise man. 52
Jupiter can do no more then a wiseman. 53 Three sorts of Philosopers. 54
Stoicall inductions to persuade a man to murder himself. 55 The estate of the
soul before it enters into the body, and after it has left it. 56 That no
man but a wiseman can requite a good turn which is received. 57 If a wiseman
be without passions or no? 58 Of happy life and the chiefest good. 59 A happy
man is perfectly happy. 60 Of the golden age and the first men. 61 Of the
invention of arts and occupations. 62 That the firmity and felicity of a
wiseman (imagined perfect in this present life) is in himself. 63 The
sovereign good is in this life, and cannot receive increase. 64 This world
wherein we are contained, is one, is God, whose members and companions we are.
65 A dead man is no more. 66 That which we call good is a body. 67 Virtues and
other things, yea, those accidents which are without subject and form, are
animals and bodies. 68 If it be better to have moderate affection, or to have
none at all. 69 Wisdom is a good thing, to be wise is not. 70 Nothing seems
more dishonest then to wish for death. It is in thine own power to die when
thou will. 71 God is the soul of the world: it is all that which thou see,
and all that which thou see not. 72 Of the universal deluge by water which
shall ruin the world. 73 Of the end of the world by an universal deluge. 74
If the heaven turns and the earth stands still, or if the heaven is
immovable, and the earth turns. If the heaven falls continually,
unperceived because it falls into that which is infinite. 75 Of Comets. 76
The nourishment of the flesh is a savage life and beastly. 77 There is nothing
honest but that which is good. 78 Virtue is sufficient for her self, to live
well and happily. 79 Sins are equal, and virtuous actions likewise. 80 All
imprudent men are mad. 81 All wisemen are exempt and free: contrariwise, all
imprudent men are vicious and slaves. 82 No one but a wiseman is rich. 83 The
sum of certain dangerous Paradoxes of the Stoickes.
