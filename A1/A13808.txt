A brief Exposition of the Lords Prayer, contained in Questions and Answers:

Collected for the instruction of the unlearned, by John Tomkys Preacher of
Gods Word in the Town of Shrewesburie. 1585.

Psalm. 34. verse. 11. Come ye children and hearken unto me: I will teach you
the fear of the Lord.

Seen and allowed according to her Majesty's Injunctions.

AT LONDON; Printed by Robert Walde-grave, for William Ponsonbye.

TO THE CHRISTIAN PARENTS, AND GODLY House-houlders in the town of
Shrewesburie, grace, mercy and peace, in CHRIST JESUS be multiplied.
YE have hear published in print, in Questions and Answers, (beloved in the
Lord) the Sum of that exposition of the Lords prayer, which for your
edifying, and the instruction of your families, I made more at large in form
of Catechizing, for the Evening prayer exercise upon the Sabbath days, in
such sort as you then heard, and as God vouchsafed to inhable me. It may be
objected, that many godly writers have handled this argument very learnedlye,
and published the same to the benefit of the Church in their catechismes,
whose form, in respect of the matter, it might well have beseemed me to have
used. All this, with reverence both of the Objectors and Writers, I acknowledge
to be most true. And, if I had contented me self therewith, it would have
made more with mine ease. Not to offend these Writers, but to satisfy these
Objectors, the reason, which moved me in this sort to collect both the
Questions and Aunsweres, forth of learned Authors, which more at large have
interpreted this Prayer, is this. In most Catechismes, the Question is brief,
and the Answer is large: So that the Child, whose memory is short, and
capacitye weak, does hardlye at once commit so much to remembrance, and
heardelier conceive what he rehearses. To ease him in the one, and to help
him in the other, I have endeavored me self to use breuitye in both. And yet,
I must confess, that a dutiful care to deliver effectuallye and playnelye the
full sum and comfortable sense of every word of this most divine Prayer,
has forced me some-tymes in the Answer to lay down more words, then
willinglye I would. But how so ever I have behaved me self in Method, since
I have used truethe and sinceritye in matter, I trust you will accept my good
will, and approve my labor. I have thought good to publishe this my travel,
to satisfy the godly desire of some parents well disposed, that the copies
might be multiplied to the benefit of the youth. How necessary it is, that
we be continually exercised in prayer, the manyfould perrilles both of body
and of soul, wherewith we be environed, sufficientlye shows. How comfortable
it is so to be occupied, Psalm 81.8 and 86.5.6.7.
GOD allowing us to flee unto him by prayer, in the day of our trouble, Psalm
50.15.
and promisinge us of his mercy to hear us, and to deliver us forth of all
our distress, It may easily by the faithful be conceived, How fruitless a
thing it is, to demand of GOD in our prayer, that we ought not, or in such
sort as we should not, CHRIST shows Math. 6.7
when as he condemns such prayers by the name of BABBLING. Therefore, that
our prayers may be fruitful and comfortable, CHRIST has given us this form
of prayer, within the bounds whereof, the prayers of the faithful must be
conceived. Now, for so much as your duty is, (ye Christian parents) Ephesians. 6.4
to bring up your children in the instruction and information of the Lord, 1 Timothy 2 1.2
whereof prayer is no mean part 1. These. 5.17
wherein we should be exercised continually: exercise therefore, I beseech you in
the LORD, your families, with such diligence, in these Questions and Answers,
that they may thereby be taught reverently to talk with the LORD in their
prayers. Which fruit of my simple labors, if it may please God, that I may see,
it will be no small incoragement unto me, to proceed in my ministry, as I have
begone. God bless you, enlarge his gifts among you, and establish you in his
truth. Amen.

Yours in the Lord, John Tomkys.

Luke. 4.8. Apoc. 19.10. and 22.9.
that God only is to be honored.


P Which is the Second petition?


C Math. 6.10. Luke. 11.2.
Thy kingdom come.


P Why do we crave of God, that his kingdom may come, immediately after we had

That we may be delivered from the thraldom of Satan.

C Math 9.38
Even unto our selves.


P Is there any special thing signified by this word, Thy, when we say: Math.
6.10 Luke 11.2
Thy kingdom?


C Yea verily: for thereby we pray, Acts. 4 29
that the tyranny of Antichrist may be confounded, Acts. 4.30
and that the Kingdom of God may be enlarged.


P The third petition.
Which is the third Petition?


C Math. 6.10 Luke 11.2
Thy will be done even in earth as it is in heaven.


P Why is this petition placed in the third place?


C John. 8:47
Because God does then reign in us, when we submit our selves to his will.


P What does this word Thy, import, when we say: Math. 6, 10 Luke 11 2
Thy will be done?


C Even this much: that Gods will, and not ours be done.


P Why do we pray in that manner?


C Because Psalm, 51, 2 Ephesians, 1, 5
his will is good, but Genesis 6, 5
our will is evil.


P How many ways is the will of God considered in the scripture?


C Two ways: Esaias 46.9 10, 11, psa, 33 11 and 115, 3

these, 4, 3 ephesians, 1, 4,
may serve him, 3 and that we 2 Timothy, 2, 1^ 12. Heb. 12 Act, 14, 22
may be made like the image of his son.


P In what manner do we pray, that Gods will be done upon earth?


C Even in such manner Math, 6.10 Luke. 11, 2
as it is in heaven.


P And how is that?


C Dan 7, 10 Luke 15 10 Heb, 1, 7 Psalm, 34, 8
In most dutiful manner, and with all obedience?


P Why do we pray that Gods will be done in Earth?


C Psalm, 24, 1
Because he is Lord of the earth also, where his will should be known and
obayed. The fourth petition.



P The fourth Petition.
Which is the Fourth petition?


C Math 6.11. Luke. 11.3.
Give us this day our daily bread


P Why is this petition the First of those, wherein we crave of God things
necessary for our sustenaunce?


C Because it is convenient, that we crave our findyng at Gods hands, Deuteronomy.
8.3. Math. 4.4. Luke. 4.4.
of whom we do only depend.


P What is mente by the name of Bread?


C Gene. 3.19 John. 6.51. 1. Cor. 10 3. Math. 24.45. Luke. 12 42. 2. Cor. 4.1.
What so ever is necessary for the maintenance of our life.


P Why does Christ use this word Bread, rather than any other, thereby to
signify things necessary for this present life?


C To admonish us 3. Reg. 13.8. and 4. Reg. 4 8. Number. 11.31. etc. Psalm. 78.30
31
to live in all sobriety.


P Why do we call this bread Ours, since God gives it us?


C 1. Cor. 1.30.
Thereby we learn to acknowledge Gods goodness, Gene 3.19. Ephesians. 4.28. 2. These.
3.11.12.
and also to labor truly to get our living.


P Why do we call it our Daily bread, and desire, that it may be given us
Daily?


C Thereby we learn Luke. 11 3.
to acknowledge our daily necessity, Math. 6.34.
and to content our selves with that which God vouchsafes to bestow upon us.
The fifth petition.



P Why do we pray that it may be given us, speaking of many?


C Because we ought to pray 1. Tim. 2.1. 1. Cor. 12.12. Ephe. 1.22 23
for others as well as for our selves 2. Cor. 8.13.14.15.
and to help others, with that which God gives us.


P Why do we pray to God, to give us all things needful for us?


C Hereby we learn 1. Job. 1.21.
that of our selves we have nothing, 2. John. 6.16. Ezech. 4.16. Math. 5.45.
and 6.25. etc. Luke 12.23. 1. Pet. 5.7.
that God is willing to give us, what soever he knows needful for us, 3.
Esaias. 1.3. The fifth petition.
and that we ought to use his gifts to his glory.


P Which is the fifth petition?


C Math. 6.12. Luke. 11.4.
And forgive us our dettes, as we also forgive our detters.


P Why is this petition placed next unto those that went before?


C To strenghthen us against Satan's tentations G. 4.13.
which lays our sins before us, to discourage us in our prayers.


P Why does Christ teach us Math. 6.11. Luke. 11.3
first to ask things necessary for the body, Math. 6.12. Luke. 11.4.
and then things needful for the soul?


C Math. 6.25. etc. Luke. 12.22. etc. 1. Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 55.23.
To assure us, that since God is careful for our bodies, he will be much more
careful for our souls.


P Why does Christ teach us, Math. 6.12. Luke. 11.4.
to call our sins debtes?


C Because Gene. 17.4.
our obedience is due debt unto God, which when we do not perform Romans 5.23.
his wrath is due debt unto us.


P Why does Christ teach all men to pray in this manner?


C Psalm. 51.7. Romans 3.9. etc. Iam. 3.2.
Because all are transgressors of Gods laws, and ought to acknowledge the same.


P Why does Christ teach us to ask God forgiveness of our sins?


C Psalm. 32.2. Esaias. 43.25. and 44.22. Mark. 2.7.
Because to forgive sins belongs to God only, unto whom we become debtters
through our transgressions.


P May we receive any comfort, in that we be taught to ask God forgiveness of
our sins?


C Yea verily: for thereby we learn, Psalm. 101.11.12. and 130.7. Math 18.23.
etc.
that God is willing to forgive us our sins, if we crave it in faith.


P How may it stand with Gods justice freely to forgive us our offenses, the
desert whereof is death and damnation?


C Deuteronomy. 21.23. and 27.26. Esaias. 53.42. Cor. 5.21. Collos. 2.14.
Because Christ our mediator has made satisfaction to God for us.


P How does God freely forgive us our sins, seeing he does many ways punish
us for them?


C He punishes us for them in deed 1. Cor. 11.32. 1. Pet 4 17.
not thereby to purge us from them, but to chastise us, least we should delight
in the^.


P Is there not a condition added to this petition?


C Yea, even this: Math. 6.12. Luke. 11.4.
as we also forgive our debtors.


P Do we deserve forgiveness at Gods hands, if we forgive them that trespass
against us?


C No, for then it could not be truly said, Math. 18.27 Ephesians. 1.6.
that God does freely forgive us.


P Why then is this condition added?


C Both to teach us Math. 18.22.35. Romans 8.14.
that we ought to forgive other, Math. 6.14.15.
and also to assure us, that, (if we find our selves charitablye minded
toward other) God will forgive us.


P May not the Magistrate punish malefactors, notwithstanding, that we forgive
them the offenses which they commit against us?


C The sixth petition.
Yes, why not? Romans 13.1. etc.
For punishment lawfully inflicted by the Magistrate, is not contrary to
private charity here taught.


P The sixth petition.
Which is the sixth petition?


C Math. 6.13. Luke. 11.4.
And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil.


P Why is this petition placed in the last place?


C Because we can not enjoy Gods gifts, which we have prayed for, except he
vouchsafe Romans 6.16.
to deliver us from the assaults of Satan.


P What is meant by tentation, in this petition?


C Math. 4.1. etc. Luke. 4.1. etc. 2. Cor. 11.14. 1. Pet. 5.8.
The crafty guiles and subtle assaults of Satan, whereby he allureth us
continually to break Gods laws.


P What do we desire of God, when we beseech him, that he will not lead us into
these tentations?


C Herin we pray him, Romans 7.23.
that he will not deliver us up to our own lusts, Ephesians. 2.2.
nor to the tyranny of the Devil.


P Why does Christ teach us to pray to God to deliver us from tentation?


C Thereby he teaches us Ephesians. 6.10. etc.
to flee to Gods protection in all temptations, and Ephesians. 6.18.
to crave spiritual aid of him in the same. The Conclusion.



P What is that Evil, from the which we desire God to deliver us?


C Math. 4.1. etc. Luke. 4.1. etc. The Conclusion.
The Devil him self, Sin, the Flesh, the vanities of the world, and
whatsoever. Satan uses as an instrument to draw us from obedience to God.


P. Which is the Conclusion of the Lords prayer?


C Math. 6.13.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen.


P What does this conclusion contain?


C Apoc 7.12.
The praise due unto God, whereby we profess our faith in him.


P In acknowledgyng that the kingdom is Gods, what do we?


C Thereby we profess, that it belongs to God only, to give us those
things which we have asked, Psalm. 22.19. and 103.19.
because he only rules in heaven and earth.


P And what do we, when we confess, that the Power is his also?


C Thereby we acknowledge, that he only is hable to give us all those things,
which we have prayed for, Psalm. 115.3. Esaias. 14.27.
because he only is omnipotent.


P And what do we in acknowledging that the Glory is his in like manner?


C Hereby we acknowledge, that he only is to be worshipped, prayed unto and
praised, Psalm. 115.1.
because unto him only belongs glory and majesty.


P What is meant by this Addition: Math. 6.13.
for ever.


C Hereby our faith is confirmed, and God is glorified, when we do confess,
Psalm. 102.13. and. 145.13. Apoc. 7.12.
that his kingdom, his power, and his glory last, not for time, but for
everlasting.


P Why do we shut up this prayer with Math. 6.13.
Amen.


C Thereby we do profess Nehe. 8.7. 1. Cor. 14.16.
that we pray heartely, and that God will grant what so ever we ask according
to his commandment.


A Prayer to be used as well in private houses, as in the Congregation before
the exercise of Catechizing.
O Most gracious God and merciful Father, we beseech thee for thy son our
savior Christ's sake, so to bless the meditations of our hearts, the words of
our mouths, and the attendaunce of our ears, that what so ever shall be
conceived, spoken, and heard, may turn to thy glory and our edifiyng. Amen.
