LONDON, Printed by NICHOLAS OAKS. 1618.

To the Learned, and my worthily respected friends, D. BONHAM, and Master
NICHOLAS CARTER Physicians.
BE not offended, worthy Doctor, if I presume to parallel you with a
Physician, which netther is nor will be dubbed Doct. for any man's pleasure, nor
cares a whit for any clothing in Bysse, how worthy soe^er. For the which I
blame him the less, sithence neither Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Galen, Auicen,
nor any other of the old stamp ever assumed any such title, though better
given them. But tempora mutantur, and therefore now adays for distinction and
decorum sake it is very convenient and necessary to give such attributes,
especially to men endowed with so excellent a quality as the true knowledge of
Physic, and gift of healing is. But how vilely this worthy Science and
profession is traduced and abused! Witness the multitude of Mounte-bankes,
Quack-saluers, Horse-leaches, Cunning-women, Imposters and Vpstarts, who having
learned (my chance) the Calcining of Mercury, the preparation of Antimony, or
the composition of some homespun medicine, and having scraped together some
triuiall experiments out of some old Manuscripts, or from some brazen-fac't
Bragadotio, will presently forsooth set the Physician at open defiance,
boasting and protesting that they have saved the life of twenty, whom such and
such a Physician had quite forsaken and given over for dead. Nay I have heard a
good fellow (I will not say a Pharmacopaean, and that no simple one neither)
bouldly affirm that if he should not now and then add or diminish something
from the Physicians Bill, the fat were in the fire, and twere as much as the
Patients life were worth, aggravating the matter in such manner that my very
ears have glowed to hear it, seeing that by this their scandalous detraction,
they arrogate to themselves and impose upon the simple people, bringing them
into fools paradise! But the Physicians are well enough served, for if they
would expulse one pack of these, snaffle another, and take a little pains
with Fernelius, to prepare or see prepared their principal Medicines, and not
to be so idle as to give too much credit to the Druggist, nor let each
giddie-headed fellow be partaker of their secrets, it were doubtless better
for the Common wealth, more profitable unto themselves, and more pleasing unto
God: but of this enough. There rests nothing now (my worthy friends) but that
you would vouchsafe to stand betwixt me and such malicious detractors; for if
they dare baspheme the tall Cedars, what will they not do unto the lower
shrubs. The subject of this treatise is so well known unto you, that howsoever
some nice and scrupulous persons may make question of the verity of the
passages, or of the safety and excellency of the medicine, you are so well
instructed in the composition and virtue thereof, that no wise man will oppose
you, some may imagine that I might have made better choice of some famous and
remarkable Collegians for my patrons, but unto you only, and unto that worthy
Doctor Gwin am I obliged, whose multiplicity of learning, judgment and
discretion, accompanied with affability, humanity and courtesy is more then
apparently known to all your acquaintance; Let me therefore crave this boon
at your hands, that you would accept this simple translation as a testimony of
my loving remembrance toward you, and that you would defend it from the
obtrectations of scandalous tongues, and you shall ever make me

Yours, THO. BRETNOR.

To the ingenious and indifferent Reader.
THE cause moving me (courteous Reader) to translate and publish this small
Pamphlet, was not only the scarsitie of the French Copies, but the especial
want of such a Treatise in our own mother tongue: for not only the rude
multitude and men of some judgment through vain delusion and superstitious
fear, but many Physicians themselves through a Galenicall persuasion, make no
small question and scruple whether Opium may be taken inwardly or not; Nay, I
have known men of good discretion so far infatuated by conceit and hear
say as they have rather chosen to endure intolerable pains then they would
take three poor grains of well prepared Laudanum: but I cannot greatly blame
them, for the naked truth is, many modern Physicians know not well what to
make of it. Forestus Montanus and many others with Galen absolutely conclude,
that it is stupefying and cold in the fourth degree at least, and therefore not
fit to be inwardly taken at all, but in Syncopes and extreme necessity;
Mercatus is indifferent. Capiuaccius is forced by common experience to grant
with Auicen, that for its four degrees of coldness it is furnished with three
of heat in operation.

But Platerus, Bauhinus, Zwingerus, Scaliger, Quercitanus and others affirm
with Rhasis, that Opium is rather hot then cold, seeing that in tasting thereof
it does Palatum and linguam vrere, caput tentare, Sudorem prouocare, venerem
promouere, sitim excitare, pruritum insignem parere, animositatem fi^e potius
furorem inducere, and being outwardly applied does (contrary to all cold
things) blister the skin, discuss and mollify hard tumors and nodes. But
whether it be hot or cold it skils not much, seeing it is confessed of all
true Physicians, that it does ex forma specifica, naturally resist putrefaction
and wonderfully and speedily release the body from intolerable pains: for,
let the torments or grief proceed from what cause soever, either hot or cold,
inward or outward it works the same effects, so that this only Medicine well
prepared would doubtless save many thousand men's lives that travail or fail,
sub aequatore vel polo Arctico, into the East Indies or Northern discoueries,
under the hottest or coldest climes in the world, seeing it resembles much the
oil of Vitrioll, Vinegar, Chymicall salts and such like, which are given with
good success as well in cold as hot diseases: but what needs many words seeing
the Author himself has sufficiently discovered the benefit hereof, I only
wish you to have great regard to its preparation: for as in most Physical
Drugges there remains some bad quality or other which needs correction, so
does Opium require Vulcans help, and other specificall means to drive away
its sulphurous malignitie: you may read in Quercetane his answer to Anonimus
Cap. 2. and in Sennertus his Institutions Lib. 5. part. 3. Sect. 2. Cap. 1.
that the ancient fathers of Physic made their chiefest Medicines with their
own hands, and entitled them after their own names, which many retain to
this day, but now the case is altered; The Merchant he will have his Factor,
his Casher and his Broker too, the Grocer his Garbler, the Vintner his Cooper,
the Goldsmiths his Forger, the Draper his Cloath-worker and Drawer too, the
Physician his Apothecarie, The Apothecarie his Druggist and his Workman too:
for few of them make all their own Medicines. In brief John will be a Gentleman
at least. But me thinks, the life of man (so precious a thing in the sight of
God) should not be so little esteemed of as I fear it is in posting over
hither and thither, I would be loath to be mistaken, or have any man think I
go about to correct magnificat, or teach others having need of instruction my
self, but ingeniously (as any conscionable man ought) declare my opinion, and
to let the friendly Reader know how he may be abused if he look not about
him; for mine own part, I will be so bold, if able, as to prepare the chiefest
Physic I use my self, and for the Medicine handled in this book, they may
have it well don of my friend Harbert Whitfield in Newgate-Market, of Master
Bromhall, who has conferred with the Author and some others, no doubt about
this town. And so entreating thy gentle patience for these rude lines, and thy
kind acceptance of this homely translation while better is abreeding, I ever
rest,

Studious of thy health, THO. BRETNOR.

The Author his Preface to the Reader.
I Make no question (Courteous Reader) but as soon as this little Pamphlet
shall come abroad, there will be some which will presently begin to tax me;
saying, what fellow is this Sala? will he (like a Master) teach us what Opium
is, and how we should prepare an excellent Medicine thereof called Laudanum,
which will presently appease all griefs of the body, extinguish all extreme
heates in Fevers, stay all Fluxes of the belly, pro^oke quiet rest to the
diseased, etc. are not these only two things, the one whereof has been
disclosed to the world many ages ago, the other revealed to us of late by
sundry modern Physicians, so that we stand not in need of his instructions,
he might well enough have spared his breath, to have cooled his pottage.

To whom I answer first (concerning the natural property of Opium) by
demanding of them what ancient Physician was there ever, who has written of,
or declared the nature and use of this Medicine so well, or so amply given such
infallible and true reasons of its virtue and energie, but there may remain
some gap open, or some subject or other to work upon, wherein they may be
controuled, and whereto or from whence a man may add or diminish something
more or less: believe me (I think) they would have much ado to find me such
an Author; for if it were so, to what end should they dispute so often in
their public Academies and private consultations of the natural qualities of
Opium? were it not a notable argument of vain curiosity rather then of solid
judgment or discretion to dispute against a doctrine already reduced into
necessary and irreproueable Maxims as they imagine? But the naked truth is,
that the use of Opium is yet doubtful among the greatest part of Physicians:
which being granted, I know no reason but that if it be lawful for an other
to argue and dispute of many things beside the common conceit and apprehension
of the Ancient: it cannot be accounted idleness or vani^ie in me to utter my
opinion also being grounded upon rational terms, and agreeable to the
authority as well of ancient and modern Sages as mine own peculiar
experience and observations, collected and gathered for the instruction and
benefit of such only as shall have occasion to make good use of them, not
taking upon me in this tract or any other to teach any man; much less those
which think they know already much more then my self.

Secondly (concerning that objection that diverse Physicians have written and
made mention already of the Chymicall preparation of Opium as a principal
ingredience into that excellent Medicine called Laudanum) I deny not their
assertion, but rather rely upon their authority, and am partly satisfied with
such things as they have already divulged, as may appear hereafter, yet
notwithstanding the whole world can bear me witness that neither Laudanum
nor the use thereof have been things commonly known; for it is a thing most
certain, that among a hundred Physicians and Practitioners in Europe, a man
can hardly find fifty that will take pains to read over the works of
Paracelfus, or any other Spagitique which has written of this subject; much
less can the thing it self be common or familiar unto them: among those
fifty a manshall hardly find twenty which make use of it: among those
twenty it were strange to find ten which are able to prepare it with their
own hands, and among those ten it were rare to find three which durst freely
publish or manifest its virtues to the world, or propound the use thereof in
their private and particular consultations for the benefit of the diseased; or
maintain the same for such a sovereign thing as it is indeed.

I am very well assured that although the most part of our Physicians here at
the Hage do sometimes make use of this Medicine, yet a man may travail into a
hundred Cities in Christendon^ where the Physicians neither use it nor make any
more account of it then of a thing altogether strange unknown and of no use in
the world.

Furthermore, if we come to a popular examination thereof, I am persuaded that
in this very City (notwithstanding the aforesaid) among a thousand men and
women which know the name and use of Treakle, Mithridate and other ordinary
Medicinal compositions, and can apply them to their best use and behoof when
they are diseased or sick, yet a man can hardly find twenty of them which
have once in their lives heard one speak of Laudanum, the knowledge whereof no
question had been as requisite and necessary as of either of the aforenamed.
What great matter is it then if James, Martin, Francis, etc. knew what Laudanum
is, and the use thereof, when so many thousand men know nothing at all, many of
them in the mean time languishing and complaining of extreme pains and want
of sleep even to death, and can find no ease at all, unless by means of
this excellent and precious secret, or such like: Well then, Let us put the
case that this my Treatise were good for nothing else but to enlarge and make
known the name of Laudanum among the rude multitude to give them occasion
(when time and opportunity shall serve) to inquire and demand for it of their
Physicians, or of others which shall have the same by them, whereby they may be
assisted and fortified against sundry dangerous accidents which by no other
means can be so qu^ckely, safely or easily avoided; so that if it were for no
other reason then this, my labors (me thinks) were not unworthy regard; but
the profit which may redound to many persons by this discovery is not small, as
the discreet Reader may easily perceive hereafter. To conclude with the common
proverb, As he cannot spit sweet whose throat is full of gall, no more can
such as are stuffed with their own passions (thinking themselves only wise)
ever speak well, or commend others labor or knowledge then their own, yet
notwithstanding, neither these nor any other obstacles whatsoever, either ought
or can hinder the good will and entire affection of him which desi^eth the
advancement of Art to Gods glory, the benefit of his neighbor and his own
private joy and contentment. Whether Chymicall Medicines in general are more
violent and dangerous then other ordinary Medicines are; and whether in
respect thereof a man may lawfully administer them except in desperate diseases
only as some imagne?

A man shall find some Physicians in the world which (having no skill in
Chymicall art) being demanded of their patients and other people, what they
imagine and think of Chymicall Medicines and their use ingenerall, will not
altogether blame and reprove them (as not long since many d^d) but in
answering perhaps will say, the Medicines are ind^fferent good, but are always
more violent and dangerous in their operations then other ordinary Medicines
are, in regard whereof they ought not to be used but in desperate d^seases
only.

Therefore before we speak any more of Opium, or the Chymicall preparation
thereof (for the better purging of chymicall Medicines and such as use them
from suspicion and blame) I think it fittest to resolve this question on this
fashion.

First, it may be easily perceived, that these Learned M. M. by this manner of
answering fall into a double error, and are therefore worthily taxed in two
principal points which makes their consequence unsavory and idle. First, that
they judge and censure of things whereof they have no skill, nor exact
experience at all, so that what they answer in this point, is either by some
vain conjecture, blind tradition, or idle report; secondly, by making no
distinction between general and particular, they condemn all Chymicall
Medicines without exception to be such as a foresaid.

But leaving to reprove the former of these two points, as a thing exploded by
each discreet man's conceit, let us insist a little to confute the later: in
pro^ing that they wrongfully impose violence and churl^shnesse to chymicall
Medicines, seeing that under this generality they do not only condemn those
excellent Vomiteries and Cathartickes of Antimonie and Mercury, but also all
other kind of Vomitiues, both mean and gentle, all kind of Vegetable,
Deiectories or Purgatiues from the strongest to the weakest, even from
Scammonie to Aloes and so the very Rose, as also all other forms and degrees
of Medicines, whether they be Diaphoreticke, Diureticke, Vulnerarie,
Be^oardicke, Cordial, Anodyne, Somniferous, Roborating or Specifically
approp^i^tted to diverse parts of the body, or resisting diseases of diverse
natures, and finally all other kind of wholesome and necessary Medicines, used
generally as well among the Spag^riques as other ordinary Physicians, differing
only in manner of their composition and preparation.

Hereby you may at first dash perceive that if they would speak any thing
against the vehemence which may subsist in any Chymicall Medicine whatsoever,
they should change this general enuntiation into a more particular, and say,
among Chymicall Medicines there be some which be vehement and not to say
absolutely and generally that all Chymicall Medicines are so in performance
whereof we will do them right, and presently draw them to confess that we
only have not some vehement and churlish medicines, but that they themselves
also have the like, no man can deny.

Seeing therefore we accord in this (as we cannot choose) if they will further
aggrauate the former accusation, they must of necessity prove that chymicall
medicines of a vehement nature are more churlish and dangerous then their
ordinary Medicines of the same nature are, as also that their mild and gentle
Physic Chymically prepared, becomes more dangerous then before, but (alas
good men) they can prove no such matter.

For primarily touching those Chymicall Medicines, which they pretend to be
vehement (as those of Antimonie and Mercury vomitiue) there is no question
made among understanding Physicians (besides daily experience) that being
compared with those vehement vomits which the auncien^ Physicians have
prescribed, as those of white Hellebore, Tythimalls, Spurges, etc. they would
be found as gentle and familiar in their operations, a^ Sena and Rheubarbe are
in comparison of Scammonie, Colocynthis, and other vehement and alt^ratiue
purgatiues.

And furthermore, if they should say that they neither use white Hellebore, nor
Tithymalls in regard of their venomous proprieties, or because they are found
dangerous in working, this is the thing we look for at their hands, for they
can never make it appear, that either Antimony or Mercury well prepared cause
any such Symptoms in the body as these do: or if they esteem it a thing fit
and requisite to desist from the institutions of ancient Physicians, exploding
the use of such Medicines which they find to be dangerous; we think it far^e
more rational on the other part, (observing the main end of the foresaid
intentions, and so cutting off quite the usage of evil things,) to appoint and
ordain in their room such as are more gentle and familiar.

Here they may find fault (but nothing to the purpose) and say that they
custom to make sick people to vomit is very daungerus, and therefore to that
intent they ought to use no Med^cine at all* etc. But having sufficiently
answered this objection, and proved the contrary in my Treatise entitled
Emetologia, concerning the nature and use of vomitiue Medicines, I think it
needless to repeat the same in this place.

If notwithstanding what is said these M. M. persist in their opinion, saying
that Antimonie and Mercury, are Medicines not so free from Malign quality as
I pretend, but that that they in-here and cleave to the guts, and leave some
secret infection in the blood or Radical humors, the which in continuance of
times comes to manifest it self. And these are those common nuisances which
many object, thinking thereby to draw men's, affections after their own
fantasies.

But this vain opinion is quickly confuted by plain and evident
demonstration when they please, for most men which take either Antimonie or
Mercury well prepared, evacuate or cast the same out into the vessel,
whereinto they vomit even at the very first operation of the Medicine either
upward, or downward, so that it has been often found in the excrements, when
nature did work that way first, as sometimes it falls out.

Secondly, these (being mettallicke and fixed bodies) cannot be concocted, or
brought into chyle or natural nutriment by any means, whence it consequently
follows that they cannot intermixe themselves with the blood, or any other
substance of the body, as all other vegetable and animal Medicines may easily
do, in regard of that Symbolization they have with the foresaid substances, so
that the stomach may reduce them into chyle at pleasure, which is the cause
also that the poisons of evil plants, serpents and other venomous creatures
are more active, sudden and piercing then Arsink it self or Realgar mineral.

I could produce a number of other reasons to demonstrate that Chymicall
Medicines of a vehement nature, as principally the two before named (against
which all this controversy does particularly arise) are more gentle then any
violent vomitiue Medicine which our Ancients prescribed, yea far more safe
then any vomitorie under Hellebore or any above named: but to avoid long
discourse let these suffice at this time.

Now let us come to resolve our selves whether those ordinary Medicines which
be naturally gentle and without any offensive quality, after chymicall
preparation change their natural mildness, into that which is evil, and so
become vehement and dangerous.

Concerning which point we have in this discourse already spoken some thing
in defense of purgative Medicines, as those of more frequent use then others
among diseased persons, and therefore will be contented to determine the whole
matter in the general defense of Diaphoretickes, Diuretics, Alexiteries, etc.
chymically prepared.

First, therefore it must of necessity be granted of all opponents that every
Medicine ingenerall bereaved of its earthinesse and seculencie* and made pure
clean and well digested by fire must of consequence be less hurtful, less
dangerous, and less offensive, and is also far more apt to work, ci^otuto
and miunde (as the Physicians wish) then any crude, earthie, impure or ill
prepared Medicine may or can do by any meanes' possible; the reason is, that
when such ill-prepared stuff is once gotten into the stomach of any diseased
person, nature (already struggling against the disease) becomes thereby more
wearied, ouer-cloyed and oppressed in concocting and seperating the pu^enesse
from the impurenesse of such drugges then it was before, and therefore can
receive very little or no comfort at all by such Medicines, whereas on the
contrary part other medicines (made subtle, active, pure and well prepared by
art) do begin to disperce and dilate themselves gently into all parts of the
body as soon as they are received thereinto, and being never so little
exagitated or moved by natural heat assist nature her self without any
alteration or disturbance at all, and like a good friend aid and promone her;
whereas the other wearieth and tormenteth the body like a Tyrant. Moreover we
may consider that Chymicall Medicines being pure and neat, as aforesaid, leave
no feculent residence or corruption in the body at all, as others commonly do.

But if it comes to pass (as it is not unlikely) that some should deny these
reasons, obiecting that Chymicall Medicines being subtle and pure, can more
easily disturb nature, and move the body more suddenly then other Medicines
do; to whom we answer, that although among our Chymicall Medicines, there be
some of a subtle Nature, as our distilled oils, the quintessence of wine, and
other vegetables: and as there be diverse liquors (we acknowledge) very sharp
and piercing; so in like manner be there some diseases, wherein such Medicines
be very requisite and necessary, whereas others of a cross, seculent, and
clammy substance can yield no ease or comfort at all; in regard whereof we
ought not to account them dangerous or hurtful, but rather very beneficial
and wholesome, especially being well applied and used a^ all Medicines of what
nature soever ought to be.

But under color of these no man ought to comprehend other Chymicall
Medicines, or proclaim them to be of such a piercing nature, for coming to
purgative Medicines extracted (being of a sappie, thick, and condense form)
we know well that they are not nor cannot be so subtle or piercing as oils,
nor are called subtle in regard of their penetratiue virtue, but rather
because they are far more easily converted into Liquors, then the substances
from whence they are extracted, and therefore ought in no ease to be called
irritatiues.

Experience her self teaches us that the extract of Mechoacan, Rheubarbe, or
Sena (being gentle Med^cines) duly administered, show themselves far more
mild, gentle and effectual then when they are exhibited after an entire and
gross preparation.

But what need many words? do we not plainly see that our Chymicall Art
brings Colocynthis and Scammonie (acrimonious and venomous purgatiues) ^o be
so gentle and mild in operation, that a man may as safely and freely
administer them as Rheubarbe, having only regard to the quality of the
disease, and the humor they naturally purge? as namely that of Scammonie
whereof a man may boldly give to one of a strong constitution twenty grains
at a time, in sugar rosat, or any other conserve; And this will work easily
and well, without any touch of pain, perturbance or inflammation in the
bowels, as otherwise it would surely do.

And this is a Maxim that not only Scammonie, but every other purgative
Medicine of such venomous and vehement nature as Hellebore, Tithymalls, etc.
loose their acrimonie and malign quality, and by means of this Art become
gentle and effectual in the extirpation of all such diseases as they naturally
concern or respect, without any inconvenience or danger at all: and this is no
vain conjecture of mine own brain, for I can produce a hundred sage and
learned Physicians which can and will testify and make this good as well as my
self.

And this is all which I purposed to speak at this time in defense of
Chymicall Medicines, against the suggestions of scandalous tongues, not meaning
or intendeng hereby to disgrace or vilipend those ordinary Medicines,
wherewith the world is and has been furnished and served for so many ages
together; for both the one and the other may be found good or evil according
to the diversity of their usage, notwithstanding I have at all times endeavored
my self to the uttermost of my power, to amplify and illustrate the Art of
Physic for the comfort of the diseased (as every one ought) without any
passion or malice in condemning things newly invented for Paradoxes and
Heresies before due examination and trial.

EXcuse me worthy Sala if I chance
For want of judgment thy intent to miss,
In fitting that for England which for France:
Thou pains have taken and labor to Iwis,
For which and others thou deseruest bliss:
I wish I were thy neighbor, or that I
With such a one might spend my days and die.
But now the world is such, we cannot find
A man with whom we freely may converse,
Some proud, some stately, others so unkind,
That't greeues my heart their manners to rehearse:
Or talk of such selfe-louers in my verse,
When men by nature friendly creatures borne,
Doat on themselves and others foulely scorn.
But thou, Patauian-like, I hear do joy
To do poor scholars good, and to impart
Thy secrets best to him thou art not coy,
That Is of an honest and a friendly heart,
What wight from such a one would ever part:
Witness thy books abroad and notes beside,
For which to thee some private friends are ti'd.
For what is in Physic more to be desired,
Then knowledge how to use a Medicine well
What in that worthy art to be required:
More then o'th virtue and safe use to tell?
Wherein than others many do excel,
For how to strengthen vomit, sweat and rest
Is taught by thee as well as by the best.
Let Carping Critics, that in corners lurk,
Blaspheme, detract and utter what they can
Let some of them divulge me such a work:
And I will say he quits him like a man:
If not I wish him hold his peace till then.
For sure I am that he that fault does find,
Will come at least a bow and half behind.

OPIOLOGIA.
CHAPTER. 1. The opinion of Ancient Physicians, concerning the natural
propriety and virtues of Opium.
OPIVM (as ancient Physicians testify and modern confirm) is a certain
juice or viscous liquor which one time of the years destilleth or ^sue^^ from
the tops of white or black Popp^e, by me^nes of a little gash or incision made
in the outtermost rind of them (as witnesses Discordes in his fourth book of
Simples Chap. 60.) the which liquor after due condensation is reserved and laid
up for necessary uses, as may not only appear by the History aforesaid, but by
that of Peter Bellon hereafter recited.

Good Opium (as Diescordes and other Ancient Physicians affirm) is weighty
and ponderous, bitter in taste, and is quickly dissolved in water, it is smooth
and whitish and not rugged or lumpish, and being streined it does not like wax
melt against the sun, being kindled it causes not a blackish flame, and being
quenched or put out, it always retains its natural smell.

They *use many times to sophisticate or mix Opium with Glaucium, Gum, or the
juice of wild lettice, but that which is sophisticated with Glaucium is easily
discerned, for being cut into small pieces, it becomes yellow; in like
manner, if it be mixed with the juice of wild Lettice it becomes more rugged
and tart, and has little or no smell at all; but if it be counterfeited with
Gum, it will be bright and shyning in color, but weak in operation.

Opium taken crude and raw, as asoresayd, to the quantity of an Orobus or wild
Fitch, appeaseth all Aches or pains, helps digestion, stays all Coughes
and Destillations or Rheumes, which fall from the brain into the stomach, it
is excellent against all kind of Headache if the temples be anointed and
chaffed with the same and oil of roses: being dropped or instilled into the
ears with the oil of bitter Almonds, Mirrhe and Saffran, it heals and
recouereth Hearing, and the sooner being applied with the yolke of an egg hard
roasted in the imbers: it avails much against inflammation of the eyes, and
being mixed with vinegar is very good against Saint Anthonies fire, and heals
old ulcers: with saffran and woman's milk it is singular in gouts, and being
mixed with Supposatories, it provoke sleep.

Diagoras, Aetius and Mnesidemus disprove and find fault with the usage of
Opium in the diseases aforementioned, by reason of its stupefactiue quality, but
Diescordes (affirming the lawful use thereof) maintains the contrary, and
proves their opinion to be idle and false; seeing that the property of Opium
is quite of another operation; yet he ingeniously elsewhere confesses, that
the indiscreet and super^^uous usage thereof produces no small detriment to
the patient, making him fall into a Lethargy, whereby death commonly insues;
the which he further confirms in his sixth Book and seuenteeth Chapter of
Poisons, and their remedies, where he reckons up the Symptoms which it
causes in those bodies which have eaten too much thereof.

Nicander and Aetius have written of the great annoyances that come thereby;
and Gallen also in his second and third books D^ Comp. Med. describes Opium
to be a dangerous Medicine, saying, that it mortifieth the senses, and
causes deadly Symptoms, in regard whereof he wishes that no man should use
it, unless his Patient be in danger of death, through the extremity of his
pain, and, hereunto assenteth Pliny and diverse others: notwithstanding there
be no small number of modern Physicians quite of another mind.

The cause of those dangerous effects and Symptoms, which crude Opium by its
too much use is said to procure, is attributed to its exceeding coldness; for
most Physicians hold, that it is not unfitly ranged among things that are cold
in the fourth degree.

A Small Tract of Opium, taken out of the 13 Book and 15 Chapter of Peter
Bellon his History of the singularities of some memorable things found in
Greece, Asia, and other Countries.
A Man can hardly find (says he) any thing more worthy of observation then
Opium, which they prepare now a days in Turkey, and especially at Achara,
Carachara, Spartade, Emetelinde, and in other Cities bordering upon Cappadocia,
Paphlagonie and Cilicia.

They sow their fields with white Poppie, as we do with corn, and are so
circumspect in the sowing thereof, that every Paysant or Husbandman shall sow
no more then he can procure people to gather the same in due time, for when the
Poppie is grown to be headed, they cut a small hole or make incision therein,
whence issues forth certain milkish drops which they suffer to thicken or
congeale: some one of these Peasa^ts will gather (may chance) ten pounds,
another six, another more, or less, according to the number of people he
sets aworke, for it boots nothing to sow a great deal of ground, unless he
can get people enough to gather it. We verily believe that unless the Turks
used it much themselves, it would be as vnusually vended among Merchants, as
other unknown drugges are, but it is so common among the^, that there is not a
Turk but buyethmore or less thereof, for if he be worth but an Asper in all
the world, he will bestow half thereof in Opium, and carry the same at all
times about as well in Peace as War.

A certain Jewish Merchant, of the country of Natolia, assured us that there
passed no years wherein there were not fifty Camels laden out of Paphlagonia,
Cappadocia, Galatia and Cilicia, to transport the same into Persia, India and
Europe, and other parts of the Great Turks Dominion in Africa and else where;
the which we should have hardly believed if he had not related to us by
peece-meale (as it were) what quantity might be made and brought from each
several Village about the Confines of Carachora, and the Villages of
Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Armenia the less, and Gall^grecia, he told us
moreover that the Persians used it more abundantly then the Turks.

We desired one day to make an experiment, and try how much Opium a man could
take at a time without any offense or hurt, and we found that a certain
Ianisarie of our acquaintance did use to eat thereof every day, who took at
one time in our presence the weight of half a Dragme, and meeting with him the
next day at a Mercers shop, we caused him to weigh us out a whole dragme,
which we gave him, and he swallowed it up all at once without any danger or
hurt at all, saving that for a while he seemed like a drunken man.

To ^ate Opium in Turkey is no new thing, and the reason why it is used so
amongst them, is because they persuade themselves that it makes them more
aduenterous and less fearful of dangers in war, so that when the Turk
assembleth or mustereth any great Army together, they make such havoc of
their Opium, that they almost disfurnish the whole Country. They take it in as
great snuff amongst them, and account it as great an injury when one
vpbraides another with eating of Opium, as another Countriman would do if one
should call him a drunkard.

A Christian-Armenian, with whom we lodged long time, used many times to eat
Opium in our sight, and proving the same our selves, we found no other
accident, saving that it heated our stomachs, troubled something the brain,
and caused us to sweat in our sleep. We think that if men were disposed they
might as easily plant and sow Poppie in France, Germany, Italy, and some
other places of Europe, as well as in Asia, if they would but take the pains
to dress and gather it as they should do, for surely the Climate of Natolia
is as cold as that of France. It is made in the same manner as Authors do
describe, but I am affraide if we have any brought over hither it is
sophisticated and mingled, for the Merchants do questionles multiply it before
they vent it abroad into the Countries, and therefore because we know some
marks and tokens how to choose the best, it is not amiss to set down the same.

The best Opium is that which is very bitter, and so hot in taste that it will
almost scorch and inflame the mouth, it is in color something yellowish or
like to a Lions skin, and being formed into a lump, it seems speckled as a
mass of diverse colors, for in gathering the said Opium, the seeds are found
clustered upon the Poppie-heads, which being amassed cleave together like a
cake, its smell is fulsome and strong, and although it be accounted but of a
cold temprature, yet it many times scaldeth the mouth.

Opium is formed into cakes in the Country of Natolia, which exceed not above
four ounces or half a pound at the most, but the Merchants to make the
greater profit by their sophistication double the aforesaid quantity, for the
subtle Venetians make the Cakes in their shops to weigh a pound at least, and
this is the report of Bellon concerning Opium.

Now considering that in his time a man could hardly get any in Christendom
that were good, how should we find any now adays either in the Apothecaries
or Druggests shops which has these tokens, or is so effectual or precious in
its operation, letting pass the seeds or grains as the only difference in
gathering.

It is called ordinarily Opium Thebaicum, in respect of the Province of Thebes
where the best is made.

CHAP. II. Of the assurance we have that Opium may be used, and taken crude or
mixed in Medicines without any prejudice or indangering the Patients life at
all.
A MAN shall find some Physicians now a days who adhering too much a
conscience to the opinion of old Leeches (capital enemies to Opium its use)
do not only believe it as an article of their Creed, that whatsoever any
Author has said in detraction and disgrace of Opium is an undoubted truth: To
whom I answer and say, that we ought not to submit our selves to their
judgment altogether, nor to believe the opinion or saying of any Physician,
whether ancient or modern otherwise then daily observation of the use of
things and our Grandame experience confirm in our understanding for truth: for
seeing that the ancient Physicians, as well Grecians as Arabians, how great or
learned soever they were esteemed, yet being all but imperfect men and subject
to error, had their own proper passions, and were full of contention and
jealousy one against another, as we are now adays; whence it follows that
we ought not to receive all their works for gospel, without condition as
aforesaid: for as for example Galen, Pliny, and others, put the world in fear
and suspicion of Opium, and contrariwise Oribasius, Diescorides and others
commend it, and assure and affirm it to be profitable and necessary for the
cure of many diseases: who then in this case can give us better knowledge and
satisfaction of truth of these things then Experience her self? Now she tells
us that a man may safely use Opium inwardly in men's bodies, Oribasius therefore
and Diescorides, have spoken truly, whereas the error and abuse of others is
manifest: which howsoever it falls out, it hinders us nothing at all to search
into these things, seeing that neither cause nor reason can prejudice or hinder
the authority of daily experience.

That the use of Opium deserves to be applauded of all Physicians, we have
two principal and certain assurances; whereof the former is not only the
certification of Peter Bellon aforesaid, but of a hundred honorable personages,
who have been in Asia, and affirm that the Turks eat thereof in great
quantity almost every day ordinarily without any mischa^ce or hurt to their
bodies at al, which may in part be a sufficient demonstration that Opium is not
a thing so venomous and dangerous to the life of man, as some give out and
proclaim it to be.

But here some (to small purpose) may tell me that the Turks may easily
digest Opium, how cold soever in regard of the hot Clime they live in,
whereas the Christians dwelling under a colder in Europe can do no such
matter: to whom I answer, that if it were granted that Opium were of such
quality as aforesaid: yet whether a man could digest it or not, cannot be
Physicallie attributed to the temprature of the Climate, but rather to the
strong constitution, or natural vigor of the people; for the Turks being
from their very cradle more grossly brought up and sed then the Christians are
ingenerall, become not only more able bodied and stronger thereby, but also
more apt and able to eat and digest diverse things which the tender and nice
Christians cannot iudure: and that the truth is so, Let us but consider a
little the difference of natural toughnes and strength between a Christian
Paysant or Carle here amongst us, and a Gentleman or Citizen; do not we see (I
pray you) that the Paysant can more easily endure a purgation made of White
Hellebore, Tithymalls, Euphorbium or Colocynthis (which are accounted violent
and venomous Medicines) then these tender sparks aforesaid can brook
Rheubarbe, Mechoacan, Sena, Aloes or the Damask rose.

But why the Turks devour Opium on this fashion, ought rather to be imputed
unto an ordinary custom, and common usage among them, then to any other cause
whatsoever; even as the Indians are accustomed to take Tobacco, which is a
plant not only Narcoticke and stupefactiue, but of a violent and extreme
vomitiue quality also. Notwithstanding we see that Christians, all Europe over,
by little and little have brought themselves into such a custom and habit
thereunto, that they feel no alteration or prejudice at all ( as they think)
by the use thereof.

I make no question but a man might find a number of people among Christians
that if they cannot already, could easily accustom themselves to eat Opium
as familiarly, as they take Tobacco: although they could not use ^t in such
quantity, nor so often in regard it is a pure essence and extract, which
Nature has separated from its plant: For essential things are always far
more effectual then gross be, for confirmation whereof we need not doubt,
that if a man should separate the rosinous and sulphurous substance of
Tobaccao, and bring it into such a consistence as Opium is, and afterward give
it unto such as usually take Toba^co, they could not possibly endure the tenth
part so much of this as of the leaves, as has been already practiced and
tried.

There be some Empericks (I know) which give crude Opium to their Patiens in as
great or greater quantity at a time then Discorides has limited, and that
without any great danger or hazard of life at all, only correcting it a
little with the powder of Caraway-seed; and in case of necessity I my self
would not stick, or make any scruple to use it, yea I durst, if need were,
take two or three grains thereof at a time my self; for although I never did
eat thereof hitherto indeed, yet have I often tasted the same, and also
received great quantity of the sulphurous vapors, both into my stomach and
head in time of the preparation thereof without any perceiuance, or the least
touch of any offense in the world: nevertheless it is not my counsel that any
Physician should use it crude in this manner, seeing we have Art and means to
prepare it otherwise.

The second assurance that we have concerning the use of Opium, is in that we
find and see that the most expert and wisest Physicians of old, found it
good, and therefore prescribed this Medicine as a principal ingredient, and as
one of the most important bases in their chiefest compositions, Alexiteries,
Diaphoretickes, Anodynes, Cordialls, which naturally resist the most grievous
and violent diseases that can any ways happen to human bodies, for which
cause they usually call them Opiate Confections, as that of their Tre^cle of
Andromachus, their Mithridate of Danocrates, their Triphera magna, Aurea,
Alexandrina, Philomuim romanum, Requies Nicholai, and others, which they have
used as principal Medicines for these many hundred years and yet do; for
they are indeed the most precious and necessary compositions their ordinary
Apothecaries have.

The causes which moved Ancient Physicians to put Opium unto the foresaid
confections are not few, seeing that its properties are to assuage all inward
pains, strengthen the passages and conduits which are open, loose, and
disbanded: precipitate, disperse and consume these venomous vapors which are
raised from one part to another: incrassat and thicken al subtle corros^ue and
humors, by correcting their malignitie and acrimonie: stop and stay all fluxes
as well Dysenterick as Menstruall: appease and extinguish all extremities in
burning Fevers: provoke natural rest and sleep to Distressed and Lunaticke
persons: and finally, like a Balm defend the parts from corruption, which
operations and effects are required in all compositions, which are generally
ordained to resist the violence of diverse diseases, in appeasing and repelling
whereof some of these properties before named are ordinarily desired, as
Quercetanus in his Pharmacop^a (entreating of the vetues of Opium) affirms in
these words, saying, Pauci en^m sunt morbi qui non simul complacentur vel
ardoribus, vel inflammationibus, vel inquietudinibus, commotiomibus,
la^guoribus, oppressionibus, vigilijs, de^luxionibus vel var^^ generis
doloribus, capitis, pectoris, ventricul^, ventris vel cu^scunque alterius
Patris: ad quorum omnium Symptomatum ferociam compescendam Opium specificam and
peculiarem quandam habet proprietatem, qua vel vnum exhis Symptomatis seorsim,
vel plura cum malo coniuncta, Simul cum admirabili astantium, and ipsorum
aegrorum admiratione euincit ac subigit, vnde saepeumero in e^usmodi casibus
tam mirandos sanationum effectus prodere videmus Theriacam, Muhridatium,
Antidotos Esdrae and similes, quae Opium exciiunt, etc.

For there be very few diseases which are not either accompained with heates,
inflammations inquietude, preturbation, languishing, oppressions, watching,
fluxes etc. for mitigating and ^epressing of which Symptoms Opium has a
specificall and a certain peculiar propriety etc.

And this may serve to assure us that we may boldly use Opium inwardly without
any prejudice to life, yea rather for its better conservation being administered
with judgment and discretion as all other Medicines whatsoever ought to be.

CHAP. III. Concerning the good and evil affects which Opium may produce in
men's bodies.
THat Opium (as aforesaid) being wisely administered to the diseased, produces
in them many good effects, and contrariwise abused exciteth diverse dangerous
and mortal accidents, is in no sort doubted among discreet Physicians; but
touching the cause why Opium does work these effects in men's bodies is
disputable: for most Physicians impute it to that extremity of the fourth
degree of coldness wherewith it is endowed, and for proof and confirmation
hereof they produce an argument drawn from the effects of its operation in
this manner: Opium (say they) provoke a vigilant or watchful man to sleep,
and incrasseth thin and subtle humors: vigilancie, then proceeding (for the
most part) from a hot and dry cause with matter or without, and the
dissolution also of the humors from the like distemprature, Opium therefore
contrarying and impugning the causes of these effects must needs be of the
quality aforesaid, and for the further confirmation hereof they allege Galen,
Plini^* and others, who in like manner witness, that when Opium is
indiscreetly used, it causes Lethargicke sleep, privation of sense, stupe^
faction of members, suffocation of natural^ heat, and death in the end.

But although I cannot like a cunning Logician, frame sophistical Syllogismes,
or give such luster to my reasons, as many would do, which take greater
pleasure in the Flo^ of words, then in the verity and realitie o^ things,
notwithstanding if it be lawful for mere Naturalists in plain and simple
terms to discourse of such things, whereof they have sufficient experience, I
may (under correction of those which know these things better then my self)
deliver my opinion also.

Opium then is not such a cold thing as they would have it, as I can prove
both by reason and experience; by reason in regard it is not only bitter, but
inflaming and excoriatiue, which are evident tokens of its hot quality and
complexion; for so the wisest Physicians in the world judge of bitter things:
and the light of Nature it self teaches us that none of the four elements
do corrode, in^lame, or heat, but that of fire. Again, its nature is known
by its color, for being of a darkish yellow, when it is dried and powdered, it
must needs be hot, as Aloes and Myrrh, and all things of like color be,
especially if they have any bitter taste adjoined.

By experience we may well approve that Opium is not cold in two respects*
first that when the Turks eat thereof, they become cheerful, courageous and
fierce in war, secondly that when one gives two or three grains thereof to
any sick person, and cover him warm in his bed, it will make him sweat more
then any other Diaphoreticke, which operations can by no means proceed from
any cold quality it has.

But if a man should object amongst both. these reasons, saying, first the
Turks being of a hot constitution, and living in a hot clime, become more
faint-hearted and cowardlike then those of colder temperatures, and therefore
Opium tempering that heat makes him more frolic and cheerful
accidentally; secondly, that if a man give but a cup-full of cold water only
to a sick man to drink, it will questionless make him sweat etc. Whereunto
I answer, that if the Turks do acquire force and courage by tempering their
heat with cold things, they might very well spare that great labor and toil
they take in sowing their Poppie, and gathering their Opium, seeing that spring
and riuerwater might stand them in as great stead, being a cold liquor, and
dispiercing it self into all parts of the body, as soon as it is drunk, but
it is so far short of Opium in quickening the spirits, and raising the
courage, that it works quite contrary effects.

And whereas they affirm that a cup of water (which is apparently cold) will
cause any sick person to sweat, I answer, that if it cause one that is in a
Fever, or pestred with some other hot disease to sweat, as many times it does,
it proceeds not from any Diaphoreticall or sweating quality, inherent in it,
but comes to pass rather, per antiperistasim, and accidentally, for like as
water cast upon a hot Anuile or burning stone, immediately rayseth up vapors
and fumes, ^uen so does water given to such a body, which after condensation,
nature either expels by urine or sweat, nor has it this operation in all
diseases or tempratures, whence it is manifest that water naturally cannot
procure sweat but by accident only, as is said.

Now let us return to their arguments, which go about to prove that Opium is
cold in respect it provoke sleep, thickneth the humors, and taken too
liberally causes dangerous Symptoms and doubtful events, which reasons (I
affirm) are of no force in this behalf, for first as Opium provoke sleep
to all those which are afflicted with hot diseases, so does it also provoke the
same in all other causes without exception, yea although they be of different
qualities, as witn^sseth Auicen and others, who have diligently noted the same:
and as for the humors, Opium does not only incrafsate and thicken th^se which
are of a hot quality, but those also which are coldest of all, as that white
and christalline humor which flows and distilleth from the brain unto the
other parts, whence it appears that a man cannot produce such a necessary
consequence of the operation of Opium, as those men go about to do, for it we
were tied of necessity to adhere and stand to the sense of the former
arguments, it would consequently follow that all cold things would procure
sleep to the diseased, where no other thing could effect the same: Item, that
they only appeased all inward grieses, incrassed every humor, hot, cold or
how s^btill socuer, and in brief had the very same virtues that Opium before
is described to have, whereas ou the contrary part no hot things could effect
the same; but experience proves it far otherwise, for if Quicksilver, the
Magisterie of Lead (compared to Saturn) Saltpeter, or Allome (salts of a cold
temprature) or the water de Sper: Ran, which is thought to coagulate or
congeale the blood by its extreme frigidi^ie, if none of these (I fay) perform
those effects which Opium does, nor Ice nor Snow themselves rationally
administered in never so large a dose, can procure sleep, or cease pains, but
rather for the most part cause more vehement fits. Yet I will not deny that
cold things may sometimes, and upon some occasions procure rest, though not
always when need is, nor so surely at any time as Opium well prepared.

And as for hot things, they are for the most part so far from causing
disquietnesse to men's bodies, or subtilizing gross humors that quite contrary
a man may find many that will provoke sleep, and thicken subtle and virulent
humors, rather and sooner then other of a colder quality, as we may plainly
perceive by Mirrhe, Aloes, Storax, Olibanum, Worme-wood, Betonie, Safran and
such other, yea and Sulphur it self (the very fire of nature) does not only
provoke sleep in some reasonable measure, but does also in such wise coagulate
and condense the subtle and hot humors, that it avails much the Pthysicall
in staying their defluxions, and it is a thing most manifest amongst Spagirists
that Sulphur can coagulate water, wine or Aqua-vitae in such sort that a man
may beat them to powder in a mortar, and after reduce them to that natural
form they were in before.

I am not ignorant, that a man may tell me that things of a cold or hot
nature, do work diuersely in bodies according to the diversity of the
subject they light upon, as the fire which hardneth clay, and softneth wax,
and so of cold things, in like manner that Opium being extremely cold, by that
extremity works in bodies, where other things of an inferior degree cannot
in any wise; but neither of the two reasons reach to the deapth of our dispute,
for first Opium (the subject of our discourse) works not in men's bodies in
this or that manner by election, according to the diversity of their
tempratures and complexions, but does indifferently provoke sleep, and causes
all pains to cease of what nature or quality soever as aforesaid.

Secondly, putting the case that Opium were the coldest thing in the world, yet
that small Dose, which we commonly use to give at a time, cannot exceed the
great frigiditie of those things aforementioned in their larger Doses.

Were it not a great absurdity, to believe that one grain or two of Opium
were colder then a dragme of Allome, prepared or crude, or one scruple of the
Magisterie of Lead, or an ounce of the water of the Sperm^ of frogs, or two
ounces of the water of Nymphaa, or as an ounce or two of Quicksilver, which
some have used to give against the worms and other maladies, all which pass
through the body as cold as any ice, and manifestly cool the mouth, and other
conduits where they pass, which one small Dose of Opium cannot do, but rather
contrarily heateth both mouth and stomach; whence you may gather that these
reasons, and the like, are mere palliatiue and stuperficiall arguments, and
fine gloses to entertain long chat, rather then to prove any coldness in
Opium.

Now touching the Symptoms which Opium causes being inordinately taken,
Experience her self teaches us, that Aqua-vitae (which is of a hot and
subtle essence) being too abundantly ingurged, causes semblable effects, for
many being drunk with Aquavitae have dyed, seized as it were with Stupiditie,
privation, of sense, Trembling, Lethargy; and indeed ended their lives in such
manner, as if they had swallowed to much Opium, and became benumbed and stiff,
as if they had died in the very ye and snow.

Wine it self also causes diverse Symptoms of Opium in them which abuse it,
as we may plainly see by the lamentable examples used in diverse parts of the
Papacy, where they commonly make those people drunk which are condemned to
any violent death, of whom some go singing, and some railing thereunto, and
others as dull and senseless as bruit beasts, none of them having any
understanding or memory of their iminent slaughter, and which is worse, have
no true feeling of their sins, nor solid judgment or discretion to
recommend themselves to the mercy of their Creator.

Wine (as all Authors affirm, and Experience her self declares) being
abused, does cause in process of time Frenzy, Madness, Rage, Fury,
Stupiditie, Lethargy, Palsi^ and other dangerous diseases, even as Opium does,
and is notwithstanding an hot liquor, as all the world knows. We may then
conclude that Opium makes not the Turks fierce and courageous in war, nor
makes the diseased to sleep, nor appeaseth all inward griefs of the body,
because of its cold quality, or by reason of its heat (although it manifestly
appear to be hot) but in regard of his operations, which doubtless proceeds
from a specificall and hidden propriety wherewith it is endowed, even as we
see in deiectorie Physic, which purges neither by reason of any heat or
coldness therein, but rather by a certain specificall quality as is said.

Now as purgative Medicines rightly used, do not only euacuate Natures
excrements, and bring the body to an excellent temprature, but being abused
do mightily offend and bring dissolution to the same; even so Opium well
administered, endoweth the body with singular benefits, but abused and
vntemperatly given, works the contrary, whence it follows that in the usage
of either of them, it behooves the Physiti^n to be ruled by reason and
experience, walking in a good conscience, and practicing his Art in the best
manner to Gods glory and his Patients comfort.

CHAP. IIII. Wherein is showed the Counsel and advise of Theophrastus
Paracelsus, concerning Medicines Narcoticall or Anodynes, and in particular
that of Opium.
Having generally declared the opinion of ancient Physicians concerning the
nature, virtue and use of Opium, and the controversies which are among modern
Physicians touching the quality thereof, it is not amiss to see now what
Theophrastus Paracelsus (that great searcher and diuer into nature) says in
this behalf.

This Author has generally the usage of Anodyne Medicines in such high esteem
and reverence, that he recommendeth them unto his disciples as a principal
pillor of the whole body of Physic, assuring them that they are the most
important remedies of all others to cure the bodies of men of the most grievous
diseases they are subject unto: In the seventeenth book of his Archidoxes and
Chap. De Specifice anodyno, he says thus, that we should speak with great
reverence, and regard of the Anodyne or Specificall appeasor, we are moved by
diverse reasons, for in particular, we have met with some diseases, for cure
whereof (finding no help or reliese among our best secrets) the Specificall
Anody^^ not without great admiration accomplished our desire, and this fell not
out casually o^ without reason, seeing it is the nature of Anodynes to
extinguish diseases, even ^^ water quenches fire. And in his first book of
Natural things and Chapter D^ Sulphur F^brionato, speaking generally in
praise of those things which naturally provoke sleep, and are Anodynes, he
says what greater secret would a Physician desire to possess, then that which
can cause all pains to cease, and extinguish all internal heat? having this,
does not his skill pass that of Appollo, Machaon or Podalyrius? Let a man
consider a little this sentence, and mark with good judgment the subject
thereof, and he shall find no jesting matter of it, In his Commentary upon
the second Aphorism of the second Section of Hippocrates, vb^ somnus delirium,
etc. Paracelsus speaking in the end of that exposition, concerning the benefit
of wholesome sleep, says that sleep is such a great secret in Physic, that
being spoken without disgrace of other things, ^ee would gladly have any man
tell him wh^re he can in all the world find such a reme^ie, which can ma^ifest
such sudden and ^ctiue ease and relief, to the health of man's ^odie as it
does.

Hence you may perceive why these Ano^ynes (of what kind socuer) ought to be
so well regarded, esteemed and made account of among all Physicians* for seeing
sleep ^s a Medicine far surpassing all gemmes, and ^ewels in the world, he
that knows how to ^pply this Somniferous secret, conveniently and in good
season, ought to be held in great ^ccompt and estimation among diseased people.

That Theophrastus does also commend the usage of Opium among his Anodynes, and
Somniferous Medicines, it may easily appear in the forenamed Chapter De
Specifico Anod. wherein he proposes Opium only without addition of other
Somniferous things, to make that composition which he calls his Anodynum
Specificum, and attributes unto it this excellent propriety, saying, that it
causes not the whole body of man to sleep, but the diseases only. In his
book De Morbis amentium, where he writes of those that be Mad, Lunaticke,
Phrantick, Epilepticke, etc. he puts the quintessence of Opium in the rank
before Aurum Potabile, Argentum Potabile, the Magisterie of Pearls, and all
other precious Medicines which be ordained for these maladies.

Here some envious Critick^ (beside the purpose) will hit me a blow on the
blind side, saying how comes it to pass that these brave Spag^riques heal not
all the patients that fall into their hands, seeing they brag of such singular
secrets as these? of whom I demand the cause also, why they cure not all
theirs, having such grave institutions, solid grounds and principal Medicines
used ordinarily amongst them? This is not to prove that although Chymicall
Medicines work more cito, tuto and iucunde, by reason of their better
preparation, and exaltation in power then other ordinary Medicines, that
therefore they can surely overcome and cure all hereditarie, inbred and
incurable diseases, or such others which God for the exercise of his justice,
has inflicted and confirmed upon the bodies of men in such sort, that no
Medicine nor skill in the world can cure. For,

Ni Deus affuerit, viresque in fuderit herbis,
Quid, rogo dyctamnus quid pauacaea invent?
If God help not, and into herbs infuse,
A working power, in vain we Medicines use*
In his book De morbis resolutis, In his first book of Mineral diseases, and
in diverse other passages of his works, he makes mention of Opium, with such
great honor and respect as any ancient Physician in commendation thereof ever
did: afterward concerning it is usage he means not that any man should
administer it simple and crude, or grossly tempered and mixed with other
Medicines before the due preparation, for in his first Chapter De Sulphur
Embryonato, and his first book de Reb. not. he aff^^neth that Opium,
Mandrage, and Henbane, contain in them some malign substance, in regard
whereof no man ought to use them (if he work warily) before he have reduced
them into a quintessentiall f^rme, which indeed has bin the principal
occasion, that the Spagiricke Physicians (putting their hands to the plough)
have found the m^anes to prepare Opium into such a pretio^s and profitable
Medicine that in all Spagi^icall and ordinary practice whatsoever, none other
can be comparable either for speedy or wonderful operation, for which only
Medicine all Christian Physicians and people, which know it, are eternally
bound to give the fountain of all goodness, thanks, for his gracious gifts
inspired into men.

CHAP. V. Of the invention or means how to prepare Opium well, and wherein it
generally cons^^steth.
Having hitherto diversely discoursed of Opium, in demonstrating its precious
and necesarie use in Physic, we (...) now go about to show th^^ effectual
manner of preparation, which the Spagirists use, to the end we may more fre^l^
and safely administer the same, then the ancient Physicians did, who commonly
put the same into their Medicines unprepared, which Quercetanus (in his Pharm.
Dog. R^st. p^^ 186.) treating of the composition of Tre^kle, mightily
complayneth of in these words, saying, De plorandus enim error est nobilis
hui^^, alexipharmaci compositioni in tam magna, trium scilicet vnciarum dosi ad
miscere tantum ven^nu^ quale Opium crudum and minus praeparatum esse constat.
The error of them is greatly to be lamented, etc. Which Quercetanus avouches
not to blame the invention of ancient Physicians, nor the virtue of Treakle,
which ^ath been, and yet is daily used with great ^uccesse, but rather to
insinuate and show ^ow much more warily and safely they should ^aue dealt in the
usage of Opium, then they ^aue done heretofore, if they had as truly ^nowne
the Art Spagiricke, as we do now ^d^ies; how be it we ought notwithstanding
to take these things in good part which ^hey have reueiled unto us according to
their ^xperience, although the invention of the ^rue preparation of Opi^m,
ought by all ^eanes to be ascribed to Theophrastus Para^elsus, as principal
and chief of the natural Philosophers and Spagirists, who have gene^ally
written of the Chymicall preparation of all things in a manner, which are used
in Physic: where others on the contrary (in^reating of the
Philosophers-stone) have bu^^ed themselves to besot and fool the world, and by
that means have rather seduced men's understandings, then produced any ^^od
fruits or works of worth.

Now the best preparation of Opium, con^^steth in three principal practices;
the first (...) depriving, or taking from it its Oleagi^ous, or sulphurous
substance, wherein prin^ipally consists the evil, Narcoticall and
^upefactiue quality; the second in correcting and mitigating its causticke and
ad^ ^ing acrimonie, wherein it is almost parallelled unto Tithymalls, Spurges
and other lactiferous corrosiues; and the third in accompanying or mixing there
with some suc^ good additaments, and furtherers, as shalb^ described hereafter.

CHAP. VI. Containing three manners, or ways to depri^^ Opium from its
nar^oticall, stupefactiue an^ nuisible Sulphur, which must be done before its
essential extract can be drawn.
IT is formerly said that Op^um is deprived and freed from its malignitie three
manner of ways, the first (as Paracelsus in his second book D^ morbis
amentium says) is by taking Opium, and mixing therewith certain Aromaticall
things, and reducing them into a Ma^^ with the rob or juice of Quinces, and
afterward putting them, into a Quince, whose coare is first taken out; and
lastly, having covered or infoulded the same in past, bak^ it in an oven like
bread, and being taken out reduce or beat it into powder, and infuse i^ in
some convenient liquor, whereby the essense or tincture thereof may be
extracted, to which purpose he takes the spirit of Vitrioll (composed against
the Epilepsie) as a specificall furtherer in this case.

The second means, is to take Opium, and to cut it into small slices, and to
put it into ^a clean Drying Pan, or upon a Lamine or broad plate of iron, and
with a gentle fire euaporate away its Sulphur, which will exhale or fume away
like a gross and stinking smoke, from which smell it is no^ amiss to
abstain as much as may be: some in the interim sprinkle it with a little rose
Vinegar, and stir it together with a Spatula or slice as it melts like
Aloes, and after spread it abroad upon the said Lamine of iron, and so let it
euapour away as long as any fume will arise, and until it become so dry that
it may be powdered, always bewaring that it burn not.

This manner of preparation is approved for good of Quercetane, and many other
modern Physicians, and I my self also always observe the same method when I
have occasion to make any Laudanum for mine own use.

The third way is to dissolve the crude Opium in some convenient liquor (as is
said) and letting it digest and boil easily, still scumming away the froath,
and unctuous Cremor swimming aloft, which indeed is its sulphurous malignitie,
and reserve the rest for use.

This manner of preparation is highly commended of Crollius in his Basilica
Chymica, in the Chapter entreating of Laudanum.

Of these three manners of preparing Opium before it be brought to an extract,
let every Physician make his own choice.

CHAP. VII. How the ^incture, quintesse^ce or (as some call it the substance of
Opium) is to be extracted, wherein his manifold virtues consist, and how to
deprive or take away his malign acrimony.
THE tincture of Opium (purified from its sulphurous malignitie as before) is
ordinarily extracted with Aquavitae rectified, or else with Vinegar, juice of
Citrons, Oranges, Quinces or other egar and tart liquors, but of all these I
make continual choice of Vinegar, for egar things generally have a natural
propriety to correct all venomous things, and to qualify and mitigate all
those which have any great Acrimonie, or any Causticke or aduring faculty,
which a man cannot find that Aquavitae can by any means do, and this is the
reason that the most sage and auncien^ Physicians have ordained that Scammonie
should be corrected with the juice of Quixces, which is an egar liquor:
Euphorbium, the Hellebores, Esula, and other corrofiue and venomous Medicines,
are commonly corrected with Vinegar, being therewith sprinkled or totally
drenched: Antimonie (which is both of a vomitiue and purgative faculty as
modern Artists know) being extracted in distilled V^negar, instead of any
alteratiue or nauseall quality, becomes only a Bezoardicke Medicine
naturally provoking sweat: Arsenicke (that great poison) and Mercury
sublimate (that violent corrosiue) may be so corrected by digestion with
Vinegar, that a man may safely use them in Surgery.

Vinegar and other sower and tart things are of such high esteem among
Physicians, that (in a manner) no man does administer either Bezoar-stone,
Vnicornes-horne, Terralemnia, Treakle, or any other preservative to any sick
person, unless they be mi^ed with Oximel-simplex, Syrup of Quinces, juice of
Citrons, Pomgranates, Berberies, Sorrel or some other tart liquor; the which
thing they do not without great reason, considering that egar things
ingenerall comfort the stomach, resist poisons, qualify inward heates, and
defend the parts from corruption; the which thing indeed Vinegar does above all
other vegetable things whatsoever, as may plainly appear by its safe
conservation of all things from any corruption that are put therein, which
neither the juice of Citrons, Oranges, Pomgranates, nor any other thing can
do, unless a man cover them with oil and keep them close from the air; and
for my part I have made sufficient experiment that the essence of Opium
extracted with Vinegar is of greater efficacy, and more confortatiue then that
which is drawn with Aqua-vitae, which liquor notwithstanding I mesprise not in
regard it is a subtle and very excellent essence serving many Medicinal
operations, yet in this particular I do in no wise approve or allow thereof,
for many reasons which every discreet Physician can manifestly yield.

The means then to extract the Tincture of Opium (after it is prepared and
powdered as aforesaid) is to put the same into a convenient glass body having
a strait or narrow mouth, and that for every ounce of Opium you pour ther^unto
eight ounces of liquor at the least, be it Aqua-vitae, Vinegar or what other
things soever the Physician pleases, and being well and close luted or
stopped, let it be put in B. M. or set in the Sun, or by a furnace, or near
the fireside where it may remain warm in digestion for the space of thirty
or forty days together, for by that means the Opium will begin to alter and
change its acrimonious churlishness altogether; for this manner of digestion
does much resemble the Suns operation, in concocting and ripening tart and
crude things, and changing the^ into a sweet, pleasant and delectable taste, as
nature has manifested by the example of Figs, which at first have such a
corrasiue and causticke kind of Milkinesse in them, which (as soon as it but
touches any part of the body) rayseth pustules and blisters thereupon; which
milkinesse notwithstanding is afterward converted by the Sunnes-heate into a
delicate and sweet juice.

Having thus accomplished the digestion of the Opium, his subtle part is easily
separated from the gross by inclination or filtring; And his essence is
afterward easily brought into a required and due consistence by euaporation in
B.M. and so may be well reserved for use, as shall be declared hereafter.

CHAP. VIII. Concerning the diversity of those opiating compositions, which
the Spagirists call Laudanums.
THE Spagirists (imitating Paracelsus, who in diverse passages of his works,
terms Anodyne and mitigating Medicines Laud^nums) have ever since retained
that name of Opium so composed: which word signifies nothing else but a
Medicine endowed with noble and singular virtues, and therefore deserves
wonderful comm^nd^tions, which moved Croll^us to blazen it in this manner:
Laudabile med^camentum, quod pl^ne suo nomine respondet si Laudanum dicas.

But the preparation thereof is diversely handled, for every Spagirist (for the
most part) differs from another, in one thing or other: For ^irection wherein
I have principally made mention of four principall-ones, according whereunto a
man for his use may comprehend all other whatsoever.

The first Laudanum or specificall Anodyne is that of Theophrastus Paracelsus,
which he thus describes in the seventh book of his Archidoxes.

Here you may behold Paracelsus his Specificall Anodyne, wherein he ordeineth
only Opium as its principal base, which is the more remarkable in regard he
does reckon and esteem it as a powerful Medicine to assuage and cease all
griefs by its Specificall form, which ought to confirm us no little in our
opinion concerning his qualities aforesaid.

The second Laudanum is that which Quercetanus appoints in his Pharmacopaea.

numquam fi ustrabit: nam confert citra molestiam and cerebi vllam
perturbationem adversus omnis generis dolores a quacunque causa subortos:
contra omnes Haemorrhogias sieve fluxus sanguinis in quacunque corporis part
fuerint: contra omnes defluxiones and fluores ventris, dysentericos, Hepaticos,
lientericos and similes: and ad adducendam grat^m tranquillitat^m in febribus
ardentissimis, in quibus ipsis rationis sensus laeditur, and in phrenesim aeger
plerumque delabitur. After this he describes an other, whereunto he adioyneth
Henbane, and almost an hundred Bezoardick and cordial things: which whosoever
is curious, and desires to know may find them written in his said book, for
I am unwilling to set then down in this place, in regard they require a long
and tedious kind of preparation, and this may serve instead of all.

The third Laudanum is that of Oswaldus Crollius, according to his description
in his Basilica Chymica.
BEfore Crollius describes his Laudanum, he commends the usage of all
Anodynes generally in this manner. Multi sunt morbi, qui absque Anodynis sanari
non possuns: Ergo in omnium morborum curationibus, vbi dolorum comites
vigiliae, viriumque resolutiones adfuerint, Anodyna intrinseca appropriata
possunt administrari, vt ablatis symptomatum ipsis radieibus pernitiosorum
cruciatibus, amica quies naturae roddatur. Afterward setting down the
composition of his Laudanum ( which he calls Laudanum paracelsi) he
describes it thus.

concerning the Antepreparation of Opium and Hyosciamus and other circumstances,
as also in particular the manner and way of their composition: the Dose hereof
according to the Author, is from two grains to four, and touching its virtues
shall be declared hereafter.

The fourth Laudanum is the Authors Nepenthes Aurea.

Let these things be well incorporated together in a small glass vessel, and
afterward keep the composition very close.

But because all these Medicines are both very costly, and curious to compound,
and perhaps of no greater efficacy then some others which I make, and
participate to my friends, I have made bold for the good of my country to set
down two, the one whereof was communicated to me at a second hand, from the
learned and eminent Physician Io. Hartmannus of Marpurge in Germany, and the
other by the no less worthy and my much respected friend* Master Dr. Bonham
of London, which are as follows.

Aduertisments.
1 My meaning is that Opium should be first freed and quit from his sulphurous
Malignity, by means of its exsicration aforesaid, and afterward digested for
the space of a month in distilled Vinegar, wherein good stoare of white
Saunders, Balm, Redroses roses and Cinnamon have been infused, and lastly
brought unto the consistence of liquid Pitch, or somewhat thicker.

2 For Bezoar-Regall, I mean fine Gold, reduced into the form of powder, by
the Philosophers dissoluing balsame, and so brought unto such a true, real,
comfortable, and Bezoardick Medicine, that one grain thereof shall far
exceed six, or eight grains of the best oriental Bezoar; which (if need be)
is very demonstrable.

3 That the (Saffron being pure and neat.) be infused after Quercetans-maner
in Limon-water, and so the tincture drawn, let the water be euapored with an
easy and gentle fire, lest the more excellent and subtle spirit of the
Saffron fly away.

4 To conclude, I put no Magistery or tincture of Pearl, Pretious-stones,
Coral, nor of any other Cordial things in my Laudanum then you see, not only
because I find the foresaid tincture of Gold to be as sufficient and
available as all the rest, but for some other rational considerations, which
here I spare to speak of.

5 And for the Amber-grise put therein, I never knew any woman troubled with
the suffocation of the Mother, feel any manifest nuisance, alteration or
offense thereby, ^s some imagine, but if any man doubt thereof, let him but
only touch the Pill intended ^o be given upon such occasion with a little ^yle
of Charabes or Amber.

These are the Laudanums, or Opiating ^ompositions which I have bin contented
to describe in this book, which indeed are all ^ery good and excellent in
their operations, ^lthough they differ something one from another in
composition, and diversity of ingrediences, yet the principal base common to
them all, is merely Opium.

The reason why I ^aue not set down the preparation of this Medicine in so
ample and plain a manner and form, as every particular Reader might desire to
make himself Master of the Mystery, is in regard I would not wrong any
private person, who by his great ^abour, cost and industry, has purchased and
gotten a more peculiar interrest therein, as having sufficient understanding,
knowledge and experience in the whole Art of Physic. For although I am willing
to make every man, that shall read this Treatise acquainted with the utility
and profit which may redound and accrue by the use of such a Medicine, yet is
it not my intention for all that, to give occasion to many presumptuous
persons, which rashly, and without any true ground other then their own
private gain^ making practice in Physic, will take in hand with a thing of so
great consideration and importance as Laudanum is. And this is the reason also
wherefore I do so freely admonish and counsel every one that loves his own
life, or the preservation of his health, more then the sparing of a sew scald
pence, not to take this Medicine for any inward use at any man's hand, but only
of such as have good knowledge therein, and will faithfully communicate the
same, not giving quid for quo, as some unworthy Mercenaries do, who commonly
gape after their own benefit and commodite, rather then the good and safety
of their sick patient.

Furthermore, I am not ignorant though a man may find many Spagirists
vaunting, and bragging they have this and that La^danum, and other excellent
Anodynes composed without any Opium at all, some saying they can make Laudanum
with mixtion only of certain Cordialls, others would make the world believe
they have a certain embrionated Sulphur of Vitriall, which is a most rare
precious medicine, and Somniferous Anodyne; but these are nothing but vain
ostentations, seeing that without Opium or some other things of equiualen^ and
semblable faculties it is impossible for any man to prepare any general, true
or cer^aine Anodyne; how be it I deny not, but by permixtion of certain things
differing one from another in taste, smell and quality, a man may compose a
handsome counterfeit Lauda^um, seeing that I my self can prepare such a
Medicine of Nutmegs, Mace, Myrrh, Saf^ron, Amber, Mask, Aqua-vita,
Quintessence, of Sulphur, etc. without any Opi^^, the only smell whereof will
provoke sleep, and being administered will appease diverse griefs, yet for all
that it is nothing so general or available an Anodyne, that it may be
compared in any sort with that prepared of Opium, or if it were a man might
doubtless make as great scruple to take that as the other; for if Opium can
endanger the body by its natural som^iferous quality, why should not another
Aromaticall Cordial do the same, which by art has acquired the like faculty.

Moreover concerning the foresaid sulphurous Anodyne, although Paracelsus tells
wonders of such a one, in the seventh Chap. of his book De re^. nature. wherein
he discourses of diverse mineral Sulphurs, it is so (ingeniously with Crollius
I confess) that I never saw any such medicine; for having try^d conclusions,
and wrought long time vpor* Vitrioll, I could never perceive it had any such
substance in it, which had like operation to that of Opium, as I have plainly
manifested in my book entitled Anatomia Vitriol^, divulged five years since;
in regard whereof those are much deceived which by means of its precipitation
with salt of Tartar, by boiling in an iron pot, or by means of sublimation do
separate a greenish powder from Vitriol, calling it Sulphur ^mbryonatum
Vitriol^, which being put to Vulcans Test, a man may quickly find it to be
nothing but Copper, or being administered alters the stomach, and rather
provoke vomit, then either comfort or disposition to sleep: it is therefore
apparent that Paracelsus, intended some other thing in this project then he
vouchsafed to discover to us.

Hence you may behold the reasons, wherefore we ought not to mis-prise, and
vilipend certain things for uncertain, but content our selves with the
aforesaid Laudanums, or such like, with thanksgiving to the Author of all
goodness, not suffering our understandings to be abused by the vain
florishes or idle fantasies of any other.

CHAP. IX. Concerning the virtues and use of all opiating Laudanums, as well in
general as particular.
Having already set down the manner how to prep^^e Opium well, and to make
excellent compositions thereof called Laudanums, it behooves us now to declare
their virtues and use for the better direction and aduertise^ent to them which
shall have occasion to use the same.

The properties of every Laudanum, which is well prepared and corrected, as
beforesayd, are principally six.
1 The first is to give ease, or to cease all inward pains proceeding of what
cause soever, and that at all times, and to all persons without exception of
what complexion, temprature, age, or constit^tion of body soever, only having
regard to the Dose, and other circumstances which are requisite for the
Physician to obser^e.

2 To provoke those to sleep which are destitute thereof by reason of any
corporal disease, or alteration of spirit, which things it effects without
dulling or benumming the senses, weakening the members, constipating the body,
or producing any evil accidents at all in them, as other Somniferous things
do which are naturally cold, and il prepared.

3 To stop all vehement, subtle and corroding Cathurrous distillations falling
from the brain upon the lower parts, thickening them by little and little,
strenthening the brain, and repressing the gross vapors which rise from the
stomach upwards, which are ordinarily the causes of such defluxions.

4 To stay naturally the Haemorrhagie, dyssenterie and menstruall fluxes, as
also the Dyarrhaea and flux of the belly, proceeding from the great
distemprature of inward heat, or some sharp and biting humor.

5 To consummate and cease all burning Fevers and praeternaturall heat,
proceeding from any wound or ulcer, or from the fermentation or ripening of any
choleric humor, or any causticke or venomous matter.

6 To roborate and strengthen the bowels and all the relaxed and feeble
conduits, and those whose virtue retentiue is weakened, by reason of some long
sickness, or by the too much use of purgative medicines.

Laudanum is more particularly used with good success in these diseases
following.
1 Against all manner of headache, as inueterate Megrims, Cephalalgia, or any
other kind of excessive pain, having regard that the stomach be first
cleansed from all gross and corrupt humors, the Dose is one small Pill to be
taken at bedtime, some two hours after supper, either in the water or syrrup
of sweet Maioran, B^tony, or some other Cephalic liquor, as the Physicians
shall think good: or otherwise a man may take it in ale or broth, or swallow
it dry as it is, continuing the same as long as need shall require, that is
until the pain be so tamed, that Laudanum is needless, which order must be
observed in all other diseases, wherein it is used.

2 Against all subtle Catarrhons, Destillations which fall from the brain
unto the eyes, teeth, or ears, or upon the inferior parts, as the lungs,
breast, stomach, etc. wherein Laudanum is used, as aforesaid, keeping the
Patients head in the mean time neither too hot, nor too cold, nor suffering
him to drink any wine, stale beer, or other strong drink, as also to forbear
eating of mustard, garlic, onions, all spices and other things of a hot and
dry quality, which further and provoke too much the foresaid distillation. If
it be convenient to open the body you must use no other purgative then that of
Aloes, washed in rose water, and thickened with the juice of Rheubarb, Manna,
Syrrupe of Roses, or with a convenient Clister, which indeed is much better,
for all other kind of purgative, dry and attractiue medicines are very
dangerous in such accidents.

3 Against all pains of the ears with noise and flatulent tingling, be it by
reason of certain wind enclosed in the brain, or of any other vapors arising
from the stomach: this medicine is best taken in the water of Fennel, Sage or a
little white wine going to bed as aforesaid.

4 Against the ayrie Epilepsie (I speak unto Naturalists) whose sits happen
with great ebullition of blood, and afflict the Patient with an Haemorrhagic
and great headache, we use to give Laudanum in the water of Paeonie, wild Poppy
or other appropriat liquor before or after the fit, and this must be given once
every quarter of the Moon in the morning before Sunrise, causing the patient
to keep a good diet, and to be let blood in due season and opportunity.

5 Against toothache caused through any hot and subtle destillation, we use to
dissolve a little Laudanum in Vinegar, a few drops whereof the sick patient
must take and hold in his mouth a while, and after spit it out, and so take
more and more in that fashion, until the pain cease.

7 To those which cannot sleep by any means, we commonly give a little
La^danum with a spoon-ful of the water of Hypericon or Balm, some twice or
thrice a week, as long as need shall require.

7 To those which have any great flux of blood at the nose, or mouth, after
due inquisition of the precedent cause, to the end Phlebotomie,
Cupping-glasses, or other means for revulsion-sake may be used, which taking no
effect, we should instantly give the patient a little Laudanum in the water of
Plaintaine, bursa pastoris Tormentill, or rather (as most effectual) in Aqua
spermatis ranarum per descensum distillat. And if the blood issue from the
nose, we put a little lint therein, that is soaked in the said water and
Laudanum mixed, and also apply some dipped therein to the forehead, by means
whereof the flux will immediately stay: But if the party has bled much
already, use no more Phlebotomie, but presently have recourse to this remedy.

8 To those which are subject to too much vomiting and cannot brook any meat
on their stomach, by reason of some offensive matter there heaped and
congealed, it is necessary that expulsion of the aforesaid matter be first made
by the fittest Emunctory, either upward or downward, as occasion shall require;
or if the vomiting proceed through the abudance of wind, or vapors enclosed in
the bowels by reason of some obstruction in the reins (as often it falls out)
or of some other part in such case these obstructions should be opened with
some good Diureticke, Diaphoretick and other convenient medicines, otherwise if
the vomiting proceed from the particular debility of the stomach, f^o^ some
ulcer, or any other cause then those aforenamed: In such case a man may
administer Laudanum in the Syrrup of Quinces or Betony, reiterating the same as
often as need shall require.

9 Against burning, malignant and pestilent Fevers (after convenient use of
vomits, Bezoardicks and other remedies fit to euacuate gross humors, or
purify the blood, if it be needful) a man may give the Patient Laudanu^ in
the water of Carduus-be^ed ctus, Veronica, Celondine or such^like, for in such
cases it does precipitate and consume the venomous vapors which arise from the
center of the body to the brain, causing madness, rage, phrensey, and diverse
other dangerous accidents, which by this means may be prevented, for it
asswageth the extreme heat in Fevers, comfort the body and recreateth the
spirits.

10 In intermitting Fevers after due euacuation of the offending and gross
humors, by vomit or siege appropriate, and the subtle and thin by conuen^ent
Diaphoretickes, as also by giving respiration to the star of Microcosmick-fi^e
by Phlebotomie, if need require, after which intentions (if the Fever cease
not) a man may bouldly administer Laudanum in the water of Centory,
Carduus-be^edictus, Mouseare, or others appropriat an hour or two before the
fit, by which means twice or thrice used, I have seen many Aguish people
cured when no other remedy prevailed, yet I will not affirm this to be an
infallible cure in all, for intermitting Fevers fall out to be such many
times, that the best Physicians in the world know not what to say unto them,
seeing they mock and scorn (as it were both them and their medicines.)

11 Against the Collicke, and all griping in the belly (having regard that the
body be always kept soluble by some Clyster or Laxatiue Medicine, we commonly
give Laudanum in a spoone-full of good white wind; but the pain falling out
too violent and intellerable we stay for no other remedies, but use this at the
very beginning, and the grief being ceased, the Physician may happily proceed
in his cure by removing the offending cause, otherwise if he shall see
occasion.

12 In extreme pains and pinches which proceed from the small guts called
Iliaca p^ssi^, we administer Laudanum in the oil of sweet Almonds, or
Muscilage of Quince-seed.

13 Against pains of the Matrix, we give Landanum in the water of Chamomill or
Mugwort, but if the pains do particularly proceed from retention of the
menstrues, then must the cause be taken away by provoking them with convenient
medicines, nevertheless the grief being intolerable, Laudanum may be first
used, for it cease all pains, represseth and consumes all noisome vapors,
which mount to the brain, and afflict women with privation of Sense,
Strangulation, Epileptick fits, etc. without fear of any prejudice, by
neglecting the cause, which the Physician may better meddle withal when the
Symptoms are stayed.

14 When a woman is delivered from Childbirth, and her pains fall out
afterward to be insupportable, causing want of Sleep, Sounding, a burning
Fever, and great debilitie. In such a case Laudanum is found to be the most
sovereign remedy that can be, and has no less virtue in the restrayning the
too much effusion of blood after birth, by giving only one small Pill as
aforesaid.

15 In all dangerous Fluxions of the Menstrues, we use to give Laudanum twice
or thrice, or as need shall require, and it will doubtless stay them, so that
the Patient use a convenient diet and rest, and refrain from anger and other
violent passions, altering and troubling the blood, I have cured diverse that
have lost (in a manner) all the blood in their bodies, by giving them only
Laudanum, and after taking a course to restore nature with convenient Viands,
and to comfort the heart, cause them to take the Magisterie of Pearl, Coral,
the Cordial Elixer, commonly called the Philosophers Aurum Potabile, etc.

16 In Dysenteries, and also in great ^luxes of the belly without blood, having
first euacuated the offending matter with Rheubarbe or other convenient
medicines, according to the quality of the ma^^er, and the part affected, we
use Laudanum with the Syrtupe of Quinces, once, twice or thrice, as need shall
require, omitting in no wise expedient Phlebotomie, or any other outward
means, whether they be Unguents, Plasters, or whatsoever.

17 To those which (having taken some naughty purgation) are fallen into a
violent flux of the belly with no little danger of life (as by many examples
is apparent) we give Laudanum in a spoone-full of Red-wine once, twice, etc.
until the flux cease.

18 In exceeding grief in the Reins (called Nephritis) as also when the urine
destilleth by drops, scalding and corroding the vrinarie passages, much like to
a strong-lee, Laudanu^ is given mixed with a little conserve of Roses, or with
some Syrrupe of Violets.

19 Laudanum is likewise given to those which are daungerously afflicted with
the stone, after the giving of a mollifyng and carminatiue Clister, if the body
be bound, and then it is best exhibited in Mead, or the Syrrupe of Liquirise.

20 To those which are exceedingly pained by reason of some inward rupture,
Laudanum is usually given in a spoone-full of good wine, annoynting them
outwardly with a little oil of Nut-megs, and causing them in the mean time to
keep themselves very warm.

21 Against all Gouts, or pains in the joints, whether it be in the Feet,
Hands, Knees, Hippes, etc. coniunct with inflammation, and when the offending
matter is windy and unconstant shifting from one place unto another, in such
cases to ease the pain, digest the matter, and thicken it so that it may be
more easily expelled by purgative means, or that Nature-selfe may consume it
by insensible transpiration) ^audanum is certainly worthy great
commendations, especially when it is given from the hand of a skillful
Physician, that is with reason, understanding and in fit time, for in such
occurrences where the matter is so vagant and uncertain, purgative Medicines
do more ha^me then good by sturring the humor over much, and causing
inanition of the parts when the inflammation grows more vehement, and the
sick persons far worse afflicted then before. To Arthriticall persons, in
whom the offending matter is not so vagant, but constant and resident in one
place, who suffer not only great pain, but an extreme Fever with
debilitation, loss of natural rest and such like cases and Symptones,
Laudanum is very convenient at the instant to stay the violence, after which
you may use purgative medicines to take away the cause with far better
success then before, for if you should tamper and purge during these fits you
would raise sundry others of greater danger, for such strong purgations as
those which are able to exhale the offending matter from the joints, would be
used when nature is quiet, rather then at such times as she is vexed, dejected
and cast down through violent pains and grief.

22 To a wounded person, which is assaulted with a burning Fever, Inquietude,
Haemorrhagia, or some other accident, whereby the wound is incensed and in
danger to gangrene: in such a case that Chyrurgian is worthy double honor,
who knows well how to use Laudanum, for the good success which undoubtedly
follows.

23 If any person afflicted with intolerable great pain by reason of any
in^eterate ulcers in the legs, arms, or other parts of the body, as many times
it falls out, by giving a little Laudanum some two hours after supper, the
pain will cease without fail. I had once in Switzerland a certain patient
about 90. years of age in cure, who had two great ulcers, which in 15. years
did so torment him, that he could take no rest, night nor day, so that he was
constrained to seek about for some man to give him case; to whom having but
begun to administer a little Laudanum, he immediately recovered his natural
rest, and shortly after was able to walk all the town over, the which he
could not do of long time before, so that only by means of Laudanum he
preserved himself for the space of one year and a half together, at the end
whereof he died for very age, the ulcers in the mean time, neat, clean and
open, and that without application of any other outward thing more then a
linen ragge dipped in the water of Spotted Pers^^aria, and so laid to the
soar handsomely as I had directed.

24 Lastly when any person is tormented with any malady whatsoever, and having
tried all ordinary remedies that can be devised to take away the cause, and
being not able to be helped thereby, but remain in continual torments, Dolor,
Vexation and Watching, whereby the Radical moisture is so dainly exhausted,
natural heat extinguished, etc. In this case Laudanum does merit to be
called the only sovereign salve for languishing people, seeing it cease all
their grief strengthens their inward parts, maintains natural heat, and
produces such miracles in nature, that none can imagine, but such as have
experience of the same, for I have observed many examples very remarkable, as
that having my self, with good discretion and advice administered Laudanum to
some persons, when they have been struggeling with death, and assaulted with
intolerable Agonies, Pain and torments, they have had such comfort and ease,
that presently after they have in far better sense recommended themselves
unto God, given order concerning their worldly estate, and yielded their
spirits into the hand of their Maker with quietness, great comfort and
edification of all them that were present about them; But the contrary has
often fallen out and still does for want of such a Medicine, in whose stead
there can be found no parrallel, as experience does plainly declare, which
ought to move and stir up every Physician, which neither knows how to
procure nor use the same to acquit himself so much the more carefully of his
charge before God and his neighbor, for there is no reason, particular
opinion, nor any disputation ought to prevail against charity, by means
whereof the whole universe does stand and continue, and whereupon all good Arts
and Sciences are founded, so that we halt in our duty, when we neglect to
search out and procure such things as are wholesome, good, and comfortable to
sick people, albeit they were invented and found out by Pagans or Christians,
ancient or modern, Gallen or Paracelsus or any other Author, whose opinion we
hold for Oracles, we cannot render ourselves excusable before God the very
searcher of the heart and thoughts: for experience being the great fundamental
book of Physicians, which is daily read unto us by the light of nature, we
should continually endeavor our selves, not only to understand but observe,
also her mo^ions and directions, considering that (as Paracelsus says) all the
means and remedies which naturally cure sicknesses, are thetrue Canons and
rules of Physic, which I would ^aue to be construed with all convenient
exception, attributing unto reason that which ^s agreeable, and unto Authors
the honor ^ue unto them.

Certain Cautions and aduertisements for the better and more safe use of
Laudanum.
WE may all understand that there is nothing in the world (be it never so good)
it for medicine, wherein good judgment and discretion for its safe exhibition
is not to ^e required, which indeed is the chiefest reason that moves me to
give further Cau^on and advertisement concerning the use (...) Laudanum.

1 First although in the former passages i^ has bin decreed, that ^his
Medicine should be used with di^ers Vehicles in every disease, yet there may
happen some particular occurrence, that in one or other, the distilled waters
and Syrrups aforesaid may not be conveniently taken as well in r^spect of
their qualities, smells and taste, as other particular p^op^rties antipathizing
the sick Patient, whereof we have seen diverse examples, as some that cannot
endure the smell or taste of roses, others of Quinces, some loving sweet things,
others not able to endure them, to some distilled waters are pleasant, to
others they cause vomit, and other accidents, so that the Physician ought to
look unto all these things, and because such occasions may often fall out, it
is best to administer Laudanum in Wine, Beer, Chicken-broath or some other
Vehicle, agreeable as well to the Patients nature as his disease, whereunto
great regard must be had.

2 You must not give Laudanum twice in one day, unless in great extremity of
pains for once will suffice, nor you ought not to exceed ordinarily the weight
of three or four grains at a time, yet unto a person of strong constitution a
man may give from four to ^ix. I^ is best administered at night two hours
afte^ supper, as aforesaid, unless great occasion fall out otherwise, for then
any time of the day must serve, according (to the old saying) necess^^ie has
no law.

3 You must also have great regard that the body be free from superfluous
excrements, which must be procured with some convenient Laxatiue Medicine,
molli^^ing Clifter, or Suppositorie, but in lean and megre bodies, and such as
feed very little, and such as are slender, full of heat and destitute of
necessary humiditie and radica^l moisture, having withal their veins full of
blood, with such you must deal very warily, for they have more need then a man
would think to have their heat cooled, and humected, rather then by purging
the body, where no excrements are to dry the same more and more, for by
diminishing the humors, heat must needs increase, and so will the body pine
and consume away to nothing.

4 To Asthmaticall people, whose Breasts, Lungs and other Organes are stuffed
with Viscous and clammy phlegm, you must take heed of giving any Laudanum, for
in such cases you must use Medicines to dissolve and cleanse away the said
matter, which Laudanum cannot do being a medicine of a corroborating and
indifferent thickning nature:

5 Laudanum is not good or convenient for Hydropical persons, which for the
abundance of water contained in them have much ado to breath and dare not
sleep in their beds for fear of suffocation, yet after the watrie matter is
euacuated, the Liver and other parts unstopped with convenient medicines, and
deliuer^d from the foresaid Symptoms, then a man may be bold to give them
Laudanum to Roborate the bowels, defend the body from subtle Des^uxions and
finish the whole cure.

6 Finally, Laudaunum is not convenient for them, whose stomach is full of
gross humors which should be euacuated with vomitory or Cathariticke
medicines, nor for those which have the Small-pocks, which Symptoms should be
taken away with appropriat remedies: In brief, no man ought to undertake the
cure of any disease with Laudanum, which has need of mitigation or help,
either by Vomitories, Cathartickes, Diaphoretickes, Diuretickes, Alexitaries,
Vulneraries, Phlebotomie, Diet, or any other appropriat remedy: And
contrariwise it is idle to go about to cure any disease with an other
medicine, which of necessity must be cured with Laudanum: for every medicinal
rule, and every Section of medicines have under them their proper maladies for
whose cure they are especially appropriated, yet notwithstanding we are
constrained many times upon occasion to mix one thing with another, not only
in regard that two or three diseases do often iump together in one body, but
also for the variety of Symptoms, and effects that one only diseases may
sometimes produce, so that one while one Medicine, another while another may be
found to be most convenient, and agreeable. And this is the reason why I
propose not Laudanum for a universal Medicine.

CHAP. X. Confuting three erroneous objections which may be proposed against
the use of Laudanum.
SOme 8. years since, ^being in consultatio^ with certain Physicians, about a
man which was troubled with a flux of the belly a month together, and at that
time together with the same had a continual Fever, was deprived of natural
rest and mightily tormented with belly-ach, so that notwithstanding the use of
a great number of medicines, yet he was become exceeding weak and feeble: upon
which occasion when it came to my turn to s^eake, I proposed Laudanum, for an
excellent medicine in that case: but they utterly disl^king the same, came upon
me with these three objections following, which notwithstanding were not able
to renverse or overthrow my opinion. To prevent therefore a mischief which may
happen to some sick persons for want of Laudanum, being denied the use thereof
upon so slight reasons, I thought good for conclusion of this Treatise, to set
down their objections and my refutation of them in manner as follows.

The Objections.
1 First that Laudanum, being principally composed of Opium, and still
re^eyning its Somniferous property, might consequently suffocate natural
heat, and benum and stup^fie all the senses.

2 Seeing Laudanum does incrassate and thicken the subtle humors, it followed
that although it did cease pain for the time, yet afterward it made the cause
of the sickness malignant, fixed and incurable.

3 That it has been observed, that some sick people have died some few
hours after the taking of Laudanu^, inconsideration whereof we should abstain
from its use altogether.

The Answer.
Concerning the first objection, I am of opinion, that if such men as go about
to propose any such thing, would either give place to the authority of great
Physicians, or experience-self (both which assuring us that c^ude Opium, taken
in small quantity, neither suffocateth natural hea^e, nor dulleth the senses,
as has been already sufficiently proved in the beginning of this discourse)
they would neither blame, nor so basely esteem of it; but suppose that a very
small Dose of crude Opium did produce such effects, must it therefore do the
same when it is deprived of the superfluity of its narcotical Sulphur, his
Acrimonie corrected, and after mixed with such Bezoardick and Cordial things
as aforesaid? No man of judgment, or of any experience in the Mysteries of
nature, can deny that Opiu^ (the principal ingredience or Basis of Laudanum)
being thus altered both in form and substance, becomes likewise changed in
its virtues and operations, and therefore can with no reason censure so hardly
thereof as when it is crude: And notwithstanding that Laudanu^ does provoke the
diseased to sleep, yet daily experience teaches us that it does not suffocate
natural heat, but rather preserve it when it is about to consume, and in
danger to be suddenly extinct by reason of its violent motion, extreme
pains, and extraordinary watching, whereby it is as rudely handled as a lamp
or burning-torch is in a mighty tempest, which causes a greater wasting of
oil, and loss of light then it would do if it were defended from such an
accident.

2 For the second objection: Laudanum is so far from aggravating, impairing
or making worse the causes of the disease by reason of its incrassating
faculty, that quite contrary it prepares some offending humors, and makes
them far more apt and easy to be expelled, as in the 21. passage before
concerning Gouts we have something declared; For is it not the consent and
verdict of the best Physicians in the world, that the preparation of humors
before purgation does chiefly consist in two operations, that is in subtilizing
and attenuating of those which are Viscouse thick and clammy, and incrassating
and thickning indifferently those which are too subtle, virulent, windy and
vagant in the body? Now the greatest part of extreme pains and inward heates
proceeding from some dissolved matter, that is either salt, sharp or
corroding, or from such as does excoriate, inflame and alter the member
affected, whereby malignant vapors arise, which passing unto the adjoining
parts, do by consent produce sundry torments, and many evil accidents as by
experience is manifest: what better course can a man observe, then by means of
Laudanum to thicken and digest the said humors and sequestring and consuming
the aforesaid vapors in such sort, that they can by no means exercise their
cruelty as before? And in case of superfluity (if it be any ways requisite to
be purged, a man may do it afterward far more warily and safely then in the
former estate: is not this represented to any man's understanding, by sundry
outward ulcers, which being inflamed and distilling from some subtle and
corrosiue humor, cause great Pricking, Dolor and pains and oftentimes by
consent a Fever to the Patient, so that the true remedy in such a case to take
away such accidents is some excellent Anodyne, which may mitigate and assuage
that unnatural heat, and suddenly ripen and indifferently thicken the
offending humor which was so subtle and corrosiue, which being done, al other
Symptoms cease whatsoever; Laudanum then (not only producing these effects by
its natural property, but also mundifying, resisting putrefaction, and
healing, and comforting the weakened parts as it were Balsame) may by good
consequence take away or extinguish the cause of many evil Symptoms, rather
then impair and make them incureable: for although it does moderately
incrassate, yet notwithstanding it does not coagulate the blood, nor fix the
substances, which in their own proper nature are liquid in stone, nor soder or
glue the parts together as Gypsum does, for which cause only men should blame
it in such manner as before.

3 Thirdly, we will not deny, but that some sick person may chance to die soon
after the receipt of Laudanum, but that Lauda^um was the cause of their death,
and that in regard thereof its use is utterly to be abandoned and forsaken is
the matter now in question.

First therefore it is very apparent by our former discourse, that Laudanum is
not a thing of such a venomous quality, as will cause death to the receiver,
for albeit the observation be true that some have died soon after the taking
thereof, yet that ought not to supersede all other reasons, attestations and
experience concerning the good effects, and safe use of Laudanum, for as it is
an absurd and foolish thing for a man to say, ^ did see certain grains of
Bezoar-stone, Vnicornes-horne, Pearls, or such like precious Cordials given to
a sick person who died not long after, ergo, that was the cause of his death,
and therf^re take heed of using any such thing hereafter: or I saw one give a
Clister to such a sick person who died soon after, Ergo, Clisters are
dangerous remedies, and ought not to be used, as many simple people are
accustomed to argue; Even so it is as absurd a thing to hold Laudanum in
suspicion, because such a one took it and after dy^d, for although it do
principally and speedily cause all torments to cease, and provoke the diseased
to sleep, yet that is no consequence that it can preserve a man from death,
when by God his secret decree his hour is come, for neither that nor no other
Medicine in the world can do: sleep and exemption from pains are necessary
things, as well for sound as sick men, the one with distinction, the other
without all exception; but that these two do sometimes serve for the
maintenance and strengthening of man's life, and other sometimes are
unnecessary, and of no use, this proceeds not through any fault in themselves,
but in nature which does not receive them for her own good and benefit, as
other times she uses to do, which thing is lively represented unto us by the
use of meat, drink and all other things called Medicines not natural, which
sometimes are good and profitable to the body, and sometimes quite contrary,
even as nature disposes of them for our good, or evil, howsoever in
themselves they are always good, seeing without the^ no man can live, we may
easily perceive the v^ritie hereof by the example of any man, who having
watched, and travailed moderately until at last he become drowsy and faint,
who after a little sleep, and repose being awakened, becomes as lively and
frolic as at first. But if this man return to his labor, and redouble his
pains and watching in such sort, that he surpass the limits of his strength,
and so long until his vital animal and natural functions be utterly
disbanded and weakened, making such an exceeding alteration in his body and
turning it quite vpside-downe, so that a dangerous and mortal disease ensue:
Now in this case, if he betake himself to this Medicine for rest and sleep,
thinking to find like benefit and comfort, as before, he shall be so far from
enjoying the same, that quite contrary he must needs pay the price of his life
for his vain excess and intemperance. After the very same manner may we
judge of such a sick person as has wanted sleep beyond measure, endured
intolerable pains, taken no food or nourishment, and become extreme weak
and at point of death, who afterward falling into a little sleep of himself,
or by means of a little Laudanum, or a spoone-full or two of some restauratiue
liquor to comfort him; instead of recovering his life by any of these, he
doubtless dies; the cause of his death notwithstanding ought not to be
imputed to the little sleep he had, nor to the taking of the Cordial (seeing
that sleep and nourishment are two necessary things for the preservation of
life) but rather in regard that death having seized upon them, these things
could not produce those good effects, which by natures intention they were
ordained and appointed for. Let this suffice then to confute the third
objection aforesaid, in defense of well prepared and discreetly administered
Laudanum. For if any man using Opium as the Turks do, or Henbane, Mandrage,
or any other Narcotiall thing so crude, raw, il-prepared or uncorrected has or
does commit any notable error in that behalf, it is far from my scope or
intention to defend any such abuse; my desire is rather that Physicians should
beware how they deal with simple people, and lest the Art should be
slaundered, there ought to be a fit time elected for the giving of Laudanum,
that is at the first encounter of the disease, when there is good hope of cure,
considering that we must not only have regard to purge Phlebomize, prescribe
a Diet, etc. to our Patients, but also to comfort and restore, to advance and
bring them to their natural rest, and to cease and qualify their torments.
Moreover we should omit no occasion at any time, to ease and succor our
neighbor, even until the point of death, in all things we may or can
possibly, even as, we would be served our selves in the like ^ase, and that
with all convenient exceptions and protestation for the reason aforesaid; And
this shall suffice for conclusion of this present Treatise.

Now I protest to every one that shall read this same, that I have no
pretension in this discourse, to iniure, or detract from those which worthily
make profession of Physic, but only desire to amplify the knowledge of this
medicine, for the benefit of such persons as are ignorant thereof, as I have
before said in my Preface. And also to manifest the pains which I take, and
the diligence I bestow to find out the properties, preparation and true use of
such things as are especially convenient and necessary in Physic, and
consequently to make it appear, that those which (moved with their own
proper passions) shall speak any thing against me, deceive themselves, and
derogate from that Noble name whence they are called Christians, thinking it no
wrong to detract from another honor, so they may by that means or any other
augment their own, which I would have construed with all modest exception,
intending not to touch any one man's name more than another, if their own
tongues be not their own accusors, whereby if they chance to manifest
themselves they shall have no occasion to blame me, and therefore I commit my
right to him which only knows the hearts of men, and who administreth Justice,
Equity, Mercy and Grace, unto all his Creatures, to whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.
