To our Treasurer, Lords, auditors of our Exchecker, and to all our Customers
and Searchers at any of our Ports, Havens or Creckes, within our Kingdom of
Scotland being for the time, and to all and sundry our others leiges and
subjects whom it effeirs to whose knowledge these presents shall come, or whom
the samine does concern greeting.
Forsameikle as in ane general convention of our three Estates of our said
Kingdom halden in our burgh of Dondie upon the xiij day of May the year of God
1597. years, upon very good considerations, It was thought meet, statute and
ordained, that all claith and others waires and merchandise to be brought
within our said Kingdom from foraine Nations should in all time there-after
pay to us the custom following. That is to say, twelve pennies for every
pounds worth thereof: And to that effect, we and our said Estates gave full
power and commission to a competent number of the Lords auditors of our
Exchecker and others of our Nobility and Council, to set pryces upon the
said waires and merchandises, conform to the whilk our Customers to be
appointed to that effect should collect and vp-lift our custom thereof. And as
it is well known to al men of judgment and understanding that this special
prerogative (amongst many others) has by the laws of Nations been yielded and
acknowledged to be proper and inherent in the persons of Princes, that they may
according to their several occasions raise to themselves sic competent means
by taking of custom of wares and merchandises transported out of their
Kingdoms or brought within the samine, as to their wisdoms and discretions
shall seem expedient sufficiently to supply and sustein the great charges
and expenses incident unto them in the menteinance of their Crowns and
dignities (so the same be done without prejudice of trade and traffic) Even so
it is most certain that we are a free Prince, of a Sovereign power, having
als great liberties and privileges by the laws of our said Kingdom and
privilege of our Crown and Diadame, as any other Prince or Potentate
whatsomever. And therefore may alter, raise and diminish our customs as the
pryces of wares and merchandises does rise or fall. Jn consideration whereof,
and because we are credibille informed that diverse wares and merchandises
contained in the A B C of our customs of our said Kingdom, are therein valued
and rated at lower pryces then they should be, to our great loss and
hinderance; and that diverse of the said wares and merchandises are valued and
rated at over heigh and dear a rate, to the great prejudice and hurt of the
Merchant; and that diverse wares and merchandises both of those that are brought
within our said Kingdom, and of those that are transported out of the samine
are not at all valued nor mentioned in the said A B C, whereby the customs
thereof has hitherto been taken only by the eaths of the merchants awners of
the said wares and merchandises. FOR REFORMATION whereof, and to the intent
that all sic wares and merchandises as at any time after the first day of
November next to come shall be brought into our said Kingdom or transported
forth thereof, may reasonably and indifferently be valued and rated both for
the true payment to us of our custom and for the ease of the merchants, we
have lately given power and direction to ane competent number of the Lords of
our Council and auditors of our Exchecker, to try and examine what reasonable
and indifferent values and pryces may and ought to be set upon ilk sort of the
said wares and merchandise; and there-vpon to make and set down ane Book of
Rates and valuation, to the effect our Customers may know what to take, and the
Merchant know what to pay for the custom thereof. And that it may appear what
care we have to avoid the least inconvenient or grievance that may arise to our
people, we gave special direction to the said Lords of our Council and
Exchecker, that in setting down of the said Book of Rates and valuation, they
should have a special regard to the setting of the samine orderly, and to
forbear to value at ane heigh rate sic commodities imported within our said
Kingdom, as our poor people within the samine could not goodly want; or might
give occasion to the Merchants to raise the pryces thereof, sic as Victual,
Pick, Tar, Hemp, Lint, Iron, Soap, Tackle, Cordage, and others of the like
nature. VVhilks Lords so appointed by us have set down this present Book of
Rates and valuation accordingly, and reported the samin to us subscryved with
their hands, the Original containing forty leaves written on both the sides.
VVhilk Book we have for the better authority thereof lykwyse signed with our
awn hand, and have ordained our great Seal of our said Kingdom to be appended
and hung thereunto, and ordeins this samine Book to remain amongst our
Records and Registers of our said Kingdom. And therefore WE WILL AND DECLARES,
and for us and our successors, decernes and ordeins that there shall be for
ever after the said first day of November next to come after the date hereof,
taken and received by our Customers to our use twelve pennies of every pounds
worth of all wares and merchandises contained in the said Book of Rates, that
shall either be transported out of our said Kingdom, or imported within the
samine, as for the custom due to us for the samine wares and merchandises
(wynes, gould and silver only excepted) The impost of which wynes is
particularly set down by it self in ane artickle at the end of this present
Book of valuation and rates of merchandises and goods imported within our
said Kingdom; and the custom of the said gould and silver (incase the samine
shall be transported out of our said Kingdom upon license) is set down by it
self in ane artickle at the end of this present Book of Rates and valuation of
wares and merchandises exported out of our said Kingdom. And for this effect,
WE do by these presents ordein and command all our Customers, Searchers, and
others having entresse in receipt of our customs at every Port, Haven or
Harberie within our said Kingdom, that after the said first day of November
next to come, they and ilk ane of them demand, vplift, and take of all our
leiges or strangers that shall happen to transport out of our said Kingdom to
foraine Nations or or import within the samine from foraine Nations any of the
goods, merchandises or wares contained in the said Book of Rates, twelve
pennies for every pounds worth thereof, according as the samine is valued and
rated in the same Book as for the Custom due to us, our heirs and
successors for the samine: And that they demand, vp-lift and take of impost
for every tun of wine that shall happen to be imported and brought within our
said Kingdom after the said first day of November next to come, the sum of
money set down in the said Book of Rates; and for every pounds worth of
coined gould or silver carried out of our said Kingdom upon license, the due
custom likwyse set down in the said Book of Rates. And incase it shall happen
any merchandises, goods or wares either to be transported out of our said
Kingdom to foraine Nations, or brought within the same from foraine Nations,
whilks are not contained and set down in this present Book of Rates. OUR WILL
AND PLEASVRE IS that the same shall be valued by the Merchant awner thereof or
his factours, upon their eaths of fidelity, solemnedlie given in presence of
our Customers, and that our custom shall be taken thereof accordingly. And we
ordain all Merchants als well our borne subjects of our said Kingdom as
strangers, to observe, fulfill and obey this our ordinance concerning the
payment of our customs, under the pain of incurring our heigh displeasure,
and as they will answer to the contrary upon their perrell. As likewise we
ordain the Lords of our Privy Council and auditors of our Exchecker of our
said Kingdom, to direct letters for answering and payment making to our
Customers of the custom of merchandises, goods and wares, and impost of wynes
set down in this present Book of Rates and valuation dew to us, after the
said first day of November next to come in sic ample form, and under the like
pains as they have been accustomed to direct letters for the like cause of
before. Provyding alwise, like as OUR WILL AND PLEASVRE IS that if at any time
hereafter it shall plainly appear to our Thesaurer and Lords of our Council
and auditors of our Exchecker of our said Kingdom being for the time, that the
rate, value, kind, name, lenth or weght of any goods, wares and merchandises
contained in this present Book be mistaken or wrong valued contrair the treuth
and our true meaning in that behalf. In that case, we do by these presents
give full power and commission to our said Thesaurer, Lords of our Council,
and auditors of our Exchecker, or any elleven of them conjunctlie (our said
Thesaurer being alwise ane) to reform the same Book according to our true
meaning in every point. And we ordein the Clerk of our Register and Rolls of

present Book of Rates and valuation under his sign and subscription manuell,
for their better warrant, to ask, crave, receive, intrometwith, and collect

Exchecker, as to all other our Customers, officiers, and others whom it shall

disponed upon: And the ane half of the said seal to be kept be the
Customer, and the other half be the Clerk of Cocquet. The awners of the said
claith, and others aboue-written, pay-and the custom thereof, with sic ane
duty for the seal as was accustomed to be paid of auld to the Customer and
Clerk of Cocquet equally betwix them. And to the end, that all English claith
and others aboue-written, presently remaining within this Realm, may be
decerned and knawn from that whilk hereafter sall be brought within the same, It

and perform al other things whilk to every ane of them is appointed to be done
in manner foresaid, under the pain of confiscation of all the wobes and pieces
of English claith, and others aboue-specified, that sall be apprehended
thereafter wanting the said seall. As also, to the effect his Heighnes Customs
of all merchandise and gudes carried from Scotland to England, and from thence
to Scotland may be the mair trewlie paid, It is decerned, statute and
ordained, that na Marchands, their factours nor servants, Masters, Awners nor
Skippers of Ships, Barks or others veshels going from Scotland to England,
