TO THE HOnorable, and my much worthy honored, truly learned, and Judicious
Knight, Sr Francis Bacon, his Maties Attorney General, Increase of honor,
health, and eternal happiness.
WORTHY Knight, I have read of many Essaies, and a kind of Charactering of
them, by such, as when I looked into the form, or nature of their writing, I
have been of the conceit, that they were but Imitators of your breaking the
ice to their inventions; which, how short they fall of your worth, I had rather
think then speak, though Truth need not blush at her blame: Now, for my
self unworthy to touch near the Rock of those Diamonds, or to speak in
their praise, who so far exceed the power of my capacity, vouchsafe me
leave yet, I beseech you, among those Apes that would counterfeit the actions of
men, to play the like part with learning, and as a Monkey, that would make a
face like a Man, and cannot, so to write like a Scholar, and am not: and thus
not daring to adventure the Print, under your Patronage, without your
favorable allowance, in the devoted service of my bounden duty, I leave these
poor Trauells of my Spirit, to the perusing of your pleasing leisure, with the
further fruits of my humble affection, to the happy employment of your
honorable pleasure.

At your service in all humbleness NICH: BRETON.

To the Reader.
READ what you list, and understand what you can: Characters are not every man's
construction, though they be writ in our mother tongue: and what I have
written, being of no other nature, if they fit not your humor, they may please
a better: I make no comparison, because I know you not, but if you will
vouchsafe to look into them, it may be you may find something in them; their
natures are diverse, as you may see, if your eyes be open, and if you can make
use of them to good purpose, your wits may prove the better: In brief,
fearing the fool will be put upon me, for being too busy with matters too
far above my understanding, I will leave my imperfection to pardon, or
correction, and my labor to their liking, that will not think ill of a well
meaning: and so rest

Your well-willing friend, N.B.

WHo reads this Book with a judicious eye,
Will in true Judgment, true discretion try,
Where words and matter close and sweetly coucht,
Do show how truth, wit, art, and nature touched.
What need more words these Characters to praise,
They are the true charactering of Essaies.
I.R.

IN words of worth, to speak of these Essays
Let this suffice, the work it self will praise.
C.N.

SOme have an humor, that to discommend
They know themselves, they know not how to mend.
Other correct, what they do think amiss:
While in their own conceit the error is.
But true judicious wits, and honest minds,
Will give their censure in some better kinds:
And say but truth, that cannot be mistook:
Wit has well labor de learning in this Book.
R.B.

Ad Authorem.
HE that shall read thy characters (Nic: Breton)
And weigh them well; must say they are well written.
They taste the lamp: much reading, observation,
Art, matter, wit, all worthy commendation.
Some weaue their lines of such a slender thread,
They will not last so long, as to be read.
Thou have so spunne, so weau'd; thy words, thy lines
They please us most being viewd, a hundred times.
W.D.

In laudem operis.
WOrds are the pensils, whereby drawn we sinde
The picture of the inward man, the mind.
Such thoughts, such words; such words, such is the man.
Say; is this Spirit a Plebeyan?
That like the singing Lark does mount so high,
We cannot reach them with an earthly eye.
W.P.

WHile I Essay to character this Book,
And th^se charactered Essays o'relooke:
I herein find few words, great worth involve:
A Lip^o^ style, terse Phrase: and so resolve,
That as a Stone's best valued, and best prised,
When best in known: So this, when best revised
I.B.

Wisdom.
WISDOM is a working Grace in the Souls of the Elect: by whom the Spirit is
made capable of those secrets, that neither Nature, nor Reason, is able to
comprehend: who, by a powerful virtue, She has from the divine Essence,
works in all things, according to the will of the Almighty: and, being,
before beginning, shall exceed Time, in an eternal proceeding: She is a
Light, in the Intellectual part, by which Reason is led to direct the Senses
in their due Course, and Nature is preserved from Subiecting her self to
Imperfection: in the Creation, She was of Council with the Trinity, in the
pleasing of the Deity, in the Redemption, the Inuenter of Mercy, for, the
preservation of the Elect, and in the Glorification, the Treasurer of life, for
the reward of the faithful, who, having committed to her Care, the carriage of
the whole Motion, finding the disposition of earth in all the Children of her
Womb, by such a Measure, as she finds fitting their quality, she gives them
either the grace of Nature, or the glory of Reason: While being the Mother of
the Graces, She gives them that holy Instruction, that, in the knowledge of
the highest Love, thorough the paths of Virtue, makes a passage to Heaven:
Learning has from her, that knowledge without the which, all knowledge, is
mere Ignorance: while, only, in the Grace of Truth, is seen the Glory of
understanding: Knowledge has from Her that Learning, whereby, she is taught
the direction of her Love, in the way of life: Understanding has from her that
Knowledge, that keeps Conceit, always in the Spirits comfort: and Judgment,
from Understanding, that Rule of Justice, that by the even weight of
Impartiality, shows the hand of Heaven in the heart of Humanity: in the
Heavens, She keeps the Angels in their orders, teaches them the Natures of
their Offices, and emploies them in the service of their Creator: in the
Firmament, She walks among the Stars, sets, and keeps them, in their
places, courses, and operations, at her pleasure, She ecclipseth the light,
and, in a Moment, leaves not a Cloud in the ^kie: in Her Thunders, and
Lightenings she shows the Terror of the Highest Wrath, and in Her temperate
Calmes, the patience of his Mercy: in her frostie Winters, she shows the
weakness of Nature, and in her Sunny Springs, the Recovery of Her health: in the
Lovers of this world lives no part of her pureness, but, with Her beloved She
makes a Heaven upon Earth: in the King, she shows her Grace, in his Council
her Care, and, in his State, her Strength: in the Souldior, she shows Virtue,
the truest Valor, in the Lawier, Truth, the Honor of his Plea, in the Merchant,
Conscience, the wealth of his Soul, and in the Churchman Charity, the true
fruit of his Devotion: She lives in the World, but, not the worlds Love, for
the Worlds unworthiness, is not capable of her worth: She receives Mammon,
as a gift from his Maker, and makes him serve her use to his Glory: She gives
Honor, Grace in Bounty, and, manageth wit, by the Care of discretion: She
shows the Necessity of difference, and, wherein is the happiness of Unity:
She puts her Labor, to providence, her hope, to patience, her life, to her
Love, and her Love, to her Lord: with whom, as chief Secretary of his secrets,
she writes his will to the World, and as high Steward of his Courts, she keeps
Account of all his Tenaunts: in Sum, so great is her Grace in the Heavens, as
gives her Glory above the Earth, and so, Infinite, are her Excellencies, in all
the Course of her Action, and, so Glorious are the Notes of her
Incomprehensible Nature, that, I will thus only Conclude, far short of her
Commendation: She is Gods Love, and his Angels Light, his Servants, Grace, and
His Beloueds Glory.

Learning.
LEarning is the life of Reason, and the Light of Nature, where, Time, Order,
and Measure, square out the true Course of Knowledge; where, Discretion, in the
Temper of Passion, brings experience to the best fruit of Affection: while,
both, the Theoricke, and the Practicke, labor in the life of Judgment, till,
the perfection of Art, show the Honor of understanding: She is the keie of
knowledge, that vnlocketh the Cabinet of Conceit, wherein are laid up the
Labors of Virtue, for the use of the Scholars of Wisdom: where every
gracious Spirit may find matter enough worthy of the Record of the best
Memory: She is the Nurse of Nature, with that Milk of Reason, that, would make
a Child of Grace, never lie from the Dugge: She is the Schoole-mistris of
Wit, and the gentle Governor of Will, when, the Delight of understanding,
gives the Comfort of Study: She is unpleasing to none that knows her, and
unprofitable, to none that loves her: She fears not to Wet her feet, to Wade
thorough the Waters of Comfort, but, comes not near the Seas of Iniquity,
where, folly drownes Affection, in the delight of Vanity: She opens her
Treasures to the Trauailers in Virtue, but, keeps them close from the Eyes of
Idleness: She makes the King Gracious, and his Council, Judicious, his
Clergy, Devout, and, his Kingdom, prosperous: She gives Honor to Virtue,
Grace, to Honor, Reward, to Labor, and, Love, to Truth: She is the Messenger of
Wisdom, to the minds of the Virtuous, and, the Way to Honor, in the Spirits
of the Gracious: She is the Storehouse of Understanding, where the Affection
of Grace, can not want Instruction of goodness, while, in the Rules of her
directions, Reason is never out of square: She is the Exercise of Wit, in the
application of Knowledge, and the preserver of the understanding, in the
practice of Memory: In brief, she makes Age honorable, and, youth Admirable:
the virtuous, wise, and the wise, gracious: Her Libraries are infinite, her
lessons without number, her instruction, without comparison, and her Scholars
without equality: In brief, finding it a laborinth, to go through the grounds
of her praise: Let this suffice, that in all Ages she has been, and ever will
be, the Darling of wisdom, the delight of wit, the study of virtue, and the
stay of knowledge.

Knowledge.
KNowledge is a Collection of understanding, gathered in the grounds of
Learning, by the instruction of Wisdom: She is the exercise of Memory, in the
actions of the Mind, and the imployer of the Senses, in the will of the
Spirit: she is the Notary of Time, and the tryer of Truth, and the labor of
the Spirit in the love of Virtue: she is the pleasure of wit, and the paradise
of Reason, where Conceit gathers the sweet of Understanding. She is the Kings
councellor, and the Counsels grace, Youths guarde, and Ages glory: It is free
from doubts, and fears no danger, while the care of Providence cuts off the
cause of Repentance: she is the enemy of Idleness, and the maintayner of
Labor, in the care of credit, and pleasure of profit: she needs no advice in
the Resolution of Action, while Experience in observation, finds perfection
infallible: It cleares Errors, and cannot be deceived, corrects Impuritie, and
will not be corrupted: She has a wide ear, and a close mouth, a pure eye,
and a perfect heart: It is begotten by Grace, bred by Virtue, brought up by
Learning, and maintainde by Love: she conuerseth with the best capacities, and
communicates with the soundest Judgments, dwells with the diuinest Natures, and
loves the most patient dispositions: Her hope is a kind of Assurance, her faith
a continual expectation, her love an apprehension of Joy, and her life the
light of Eternity: Her labors are infinite, her ways are unsearchable, her
Graces incomparable, and her Excellencies inexplicable: and therefore, being so
little acquainted with her worth, as makes me blush at my unworthiness, to
speak in the least of her praise: I will only leave her advancement to
Virtue, her honor to Wisdom, her grace to Truth, and to Eternity; his glory.

Practice.
Practice, is the Motion of the Spirit, where the Senses are all set to work
in their Natures, where, in the fittest employment of Time, Reason makes the
best use of understanding: She is the Continuance of knowledge in the Ease of
Memory, and, the Honor of Resolution in the effect of Judgment. She plants the
Spring, and reapes the Harvest, makes labor sweet, and patience, comfortable:
She has a foot on the earth, but, an eye at heaven, where the prayer of faith
finds the felicity of the Soul: in the fruit of Charity, she shows the
nature of Devotion, and in the Mercy of Justice, the Glory of government. She
gives Time honor, in the fruit of Action, and Reason, grace, in the
application of knowledge: She takes the height of the Sun, walks about the
world, sounds the depth of the Sea, and makes her passage thorough the waters.
She is ready for all occasions, attends all persons, works with all
instruments, and finisheth all actions: She takes Invention for her teacher,
makes time, her servant, method her direction, and place her habitation: She
has a wakefull eye, and a working brain, which fits the members of the body,
to the service of the spirit: She is the Physicians agent, and the
Apothecaries benefactor, the Chirurgions wealth, and the Patients, patience:
She brings time, to labor, and care, to contentment: learning to knowledge,
and virtue to honor: in Idleness she has no pleasure, nor acquaintance with
Ignorance, but in Industry, is her delight, and in understanding, her grace:
She has a passage thorough all the Predicaments, she has a hand in all the
Arts, a property in all professions, and a quality in all conditions: in
brief, so many are the varieties of the manners of her proceedings, as makes
me fearful to follow her too far in observation, lest, being never able to
come near the height of her commendation, I be enforced, as I am, to leave her
wholly to admiration.

Patience.
PAtience is a kind of heavenly Tenure, whereby the Soul is held in
possession, and a sweet temper in the Spirit, which restrains nature from
exceeding reason in passion. Her hand keeps time in his right course, and her
eye pierces into the depth of understanding: She attends wisdom in all her
works, and proportioneth time, to the necessity of matter: She is the poison
of Sorrow in the hope of Comfort, and the paradise of conceit in the joy of
peace: Her tongue speaks seldom, but to purpose, and her foot goes slowly,
but surely: She is the imitator of the Incomprehensible in his passage to
perfection, and a servant of his will in the map of his workmanship: in
Confusion, She has no operation, while she only ^arieth her conceit, with the
consideration of experience: She travails far, and is never weary; and
gives over no work, but to better a beginning: She makes the King merciful,
and the Subject loyal, Honor gracious, and, Wisdom glorious: She pacifieth
wrath, and puts off revenge, and, in the humility of charity, shows the
nature of Grace: She is beloved of the Highest, and embraced of the wisest,
honored with the worthiest, and graced with the best: She makes imprisonment,
Liberty, when the mind goes thorough the world, and in sickness finds
health, where death is the way to life: She is an Enemy to passion, and
knows no Purgatory; thinks fortune a fiction, and builds only upon
Providence: She is the sick-mans Salve, and the whole man's preserver: the
Wise-mans staff, and the goodmans Guide: In sum, not to wade too far in
her worthiness, lest I be drowned in the depth of wonder, I will thus end, in
her endless Honor: She is the grace of Christ, and the virtue of
Christianity, the praise of Goodness, and the preserver of the world.

Love.
LOve is the life of Nature, and the joy of Reason, in the Spirit of Grace;
where virtue drawing affection, the concord of Sense, makes an union
inseperable in the divine apprehension of the joy of Election, it is a
rauishment of the Soul, in the delight of the Spirit: which, being carried
above it self, into inexplicable comfort, feels that heavenly sickness, that
is better than the worlds health, when the wisest of men, in the swounding
delight of his sacred Inspiration, could thus utter the sweetness of his
passion: My Soul is sick of Love. It is a healthful sickness in the Soul,
a pleasing passion in the Heart, a contentiue labor in the Mind, and a
peaceful trouble of the Senses: it alters natures in contrarieties, when
difficulty is made easy, pain, made a pleasure, poverty, riches, and
imprisonment, liberty: for the content of conceit, which regards not to be an
abject, in being subject, but to an object: it rejoices in truth, and knows
no inconstancy, it is free from Jealousy, and fears no fortune: it breaks
the rule of Arithmericke, by confounding of number, where the conjunction of
thoughts make one mind in two bodies, where neither figure, nor cipher, can
make division of union: it simpathies with life, and participates with light,
when the eye of the mind, sees the joy of the heart: it is a predominat power,
which endures no equality, and yet, communicates with reason, in the rules of
Concord: it breeds safety in a King, and peace, in a kingdom, Nations unity,
and Natures gladness: It sings in labor, in the joy of hope, and makes a
paradise in reward of desert: it pleads but mercy, in the justice of the
Almighty; and but mutual Amity, in the nature of Humanity: In sum, having
no Eagles eye, to look upon the Sun, and fearing to look too high, for
fear of a chip in mine eye, I will in these few words, speak in praise of
this peerless virtue: Love is the grace of nature, and the glory of reason,
the blessing of God, and the comfort of the world.

Peace.
PEACE, is a Calm in Conceit, where the Senses take pleasure, in the rest of
the Spirit: It is Natures holy day after Reasons labor, and Wisdoms music in
the Concords of the mind: It is a blessing of Grace, a bounty of Mercy, a
proof of Love, and, a preserver of life: It holds no Arguments, knows no
quarrels, is an enemy to sedition, and a continuance of Amity: It is the
root of plenty, the Tree of pleasure, the fruit of Love, and the sweetness of
life: It is like the still Night, where all things are at rest, and the quiet
sleep, where dreams are not troublesome: or the resolved point, in the
perfection of knowledge, where no cares, nor doubts make controversies in
opinion: it needs no watch, where is no fear of Enemy, nor Solicitor of
Causes, where Agreements are concluded: It is the intent of Law, and the fruit
of Justice: the end of War, and the beginning of Wealth: It is a grace in a
Court, and a glory in a Kingdom, a blessing in a Family, and a happiness in a
Commonwealth: It fills the rich man's cofers, and feeds the poor man's labor:
It is the Wise-mans study, and the Good-mans joy: who love it, are gracious,
who make it, are blessed, who keep it are happy, and who break it, are
miserable: It has no dwelling with Idolatry, nor friendship with falsehood, for
her life is in Truth, and in her, all is Amen. But lest in the Justice of
Peace, I may rather be reproved for my Ignorance of her worth, then thought
worthy to speak in her praise, with this only Conclusion, in the commendation
of Peace, I will draw to an end, and hold my peace: It was a message of Joy at
the birth of Christ, a song of Joy, at the imbracement of Christ, an assurance
of Joy, at the death of Christ, and shall be the fullness of Joy, at the
coming of Christ.

War.
WAR is a scourge of the wrath of God, which by famine, fire, or sword,
humbles the spirits of the Repentant, tries the patience of the Faithful,
and hardneth the hearts of the ungodly: it is the misery of Time, and the
terror of Nature, the dispeopling of the Earth, and the ruin of her Beauty:
Her life, is Action, her food; Blood, her honor, Valor, and her joy, Conquest.
She is Valors exercise, and Honors adventure, Reasons trouble, and Peaces
enemy: she is the stout man's love, and the weak man's fear, the poor man's
toil, and the rich man's plague: she is the Armourers Benefactor, and the
Chirurgions agent, the Cowards ague, and the Desperats overthrow: she is the
wish of Envy, the plague of them that wish her, the shipwreck of life, and the
agent for death; The best of her is, that she is the seasoner of the body, and
the manager of the mind, for the enduring of labor, in the resolution of
action: she thunders in the Air, rips up the Earth, cuts thorough the Seas,
and consumes with the fire: she is indeed the invention of Malice, the work
of Mischief, the music of Hell, and the dance of the Devil: she makes the
end of Youth untimely, and of Age wretched, the Cities sack, and the Countries
beggary: she is the Captains pride, and the Captives sorrow, the throat of
blood, and the grave of flesh: she is the woe of the world, the punishment of
sin, the passage of danger, and, the Messenger of destruction: she is the
wise man's warning, and the fools payment, the godly man's grief, and, the
wicked man's game: In sum, so many are her wounds, so mortal her cures, so
dangerous her course, and, so deuilish her devises, that, I will wade no
further in her rivers of blood, but, only, thus conclude in her description:
she is Gods curse, and Man's misery, hells Practice, and earthes Hell.

Valor.
VAlor is a Virtue in the spirit, which keeps the flesh in subjection:
Resolves without fear, and travails without fainting: she vows no villainy,
nor, breaks; her fidelity, she is patient in captivity, and pitiful in
conquest: Her gain is honor, and, desert her mean, fortune her skorne, and
folly, her hate: wisdom is her guide, and conquest her grace, clemency, her
praise, and humility, her Glory: she is youths ornament, and ages honor;
natures blessing, and Virtue; love: Her life is resolution, and her love,
victory, her triumph, truth, and her fame, virtue: Her arms are from
antiquity, and, her cote, full of honor, where, the title of grace, has her
Herauldry from heaven she makes a walk of war, and a sport of danger, an
ease, of labor, and a lest, of death: she makes famine, but abstinence, want,
but, a patience, sickness, but a purge, and death, a puff: she is the
Mainteiner of ^arre, the General of an army, ^he terror of an Enemy, and the
^ory of a camp: she is the No^lenesse of the mind, and the ^^rength of the
Body, the li^e of ^ope, and the death of fear* with (...) handful of men,
she ouer^hrowes a multitude, and with a ^daine amazement, she discom^tes a
Camp: she is the revenge ^f wrong, and the defense of ^ight, Religions
Champion, and, ^ertues choice: In brief, let this ^uffice in her commendation:
she ^rengthened David, and conque^ed Goliath, she overthrows her ^nemies, and
conquers her self.

Resolution.
REsolution is the Honoure^ Valor, in the quarrel of Ve^tue, for the defense
of Right, an^ Redress of Wrong: She, beaten the March, pitcheth the Battle
plants the Ordinance, and Maintains the fight: Her Ear is stop^ from
Disswasions, her Eye aim^^ only at Honor, her hand takes the Sword of Valor,
and her heart thinks of nothing, but victory^ She gives the Charge, makes the
Stand, Assaults the fort, and enters the Breach: She breaks the Pikes, faceth
the Shot, dampes the Souldior, and defeates the Army: She loses no time,
slippes no Occasion, dreads no danger, and, Cares for no force; ^he is Valors
life, and virtues ^oue, Justice Honor, and, Mer^ies Glory: She beats down
Castles, fires Ships, Wades ^^orough the Sea, and Walks ^^orough the World:
She makes ^isedome, her Guide, and Will, ^er Servant, Reason, her Compa^ion,
and Honor, her Mistress: ^he is a Blessing in Nature, and a ^eauty, in Reason, a
Grace in In^ention, and, a Glory in Action: ^he studies no plots, when her
^latforme is set down, and defers ^o time, when her hour is pre^xed: She
stands upon no ^elpes, when she knows her own ^orce, and in the Execution of
her ^ill, she is a Rock Irremoueable: ^he is the Kings Will, without
Contradiction, and the Judges ^oome, without Exception, the ^chollers
profession, without Al^eration, and the Soldiers Honor without Comparison: In
Summ^ so many are the grounds of he^ Grace, and the just Causes of he^
Commendation, that, Leauin^ her worth, to the description (...) better wits, I
will in these few words, conclude my Conceit^ her. She is the stoutnesse of
the heart, and the strength of the mind, a gift of God, and, the glory of the
World.

Honor.
HOnor is a Title of Grace given by the spirit of Virtue, to the desert of
Valor, in the defense of Truth: it is wronged in baseness, and abused in
vn^worthinesse, endangered in wantonness, and lost in wickednes^ It nourishes
Art, and crownet^ Wit, graceth Learning, and glorifieth Wisdom: in the
Herauldry of Heaven, it has the richest Cote, being, in Nature Allied, unto
all the houses of Grace, which in the Heaven of heavens, attend the King of
kings: Her Escucheon is a heart, in which, in the shield of faith, she bears
on the Anckor of Hope, the Helmit of Salvation: she quarters with Wisdom in
the Resolution of Valor, and in the line of Charity, she is of the House of
Justice: Her Supporters are Time, and Patience, her Mantle, Truth, and her
crest, Christ treading upon the Globe of the world: her Imprese, Corona mea,
Christus: In brief, finding her state so high, that I am not able to climb
unto the praise of her perfection, I will leave her Royalty to the Register of
most Princely spirits, and in my humble hearts thus only deliver my opinion of
her: She is Virtues due, and Graces gift, Valors wealth, and Reasons joy.

Truth.
TRuth is the Glory of time, and the daughter of Eternity: a Title of the
highest Grace, and, a Note of a divine Nature: she is the life of Religion, the
light of Love, the Grace of Wit, and the Crown of Wisdom, she is the Beauty
of Valor, the brightness of honor, the blessing of reason, and the joy of
faith: her truth is pure gold, her Time, is right precious, her word is most
gracious, and her will, is most glorious: Her Essence is in God, and, her
dwelling with his servants, her will in his wisdom, and her work, to his
Glory: she is honored in love, and graced in constancy, in patience admired,
and in charity, beloved she is the Angels worship, the Virgins fame, the
Saints bliss, and the Martirs crown: she is the Kings Greatness, and his
Councels, Goodness, his subjects Peace, and his kingdoms Praise: she is the
life of learning, and the light of the Law, the honor of Trade, and the grace
of labor: she has a pure Eye, a plain hand, a piercing wit and a perfect
heart: she is wisdoms walk in the way of holiness, and takes up her rest,
but, in the resolution of goodness: Her tongue never trippes, her heart never
faintes, her hand never fails, and her faith, never fears: her Church is
without schism, her City without fraud, her Court, without Vanity, and her
kingdom, without Villainy: In sum, so infinite is her Excellence, in the
construction of all sense, that I will thus only conclude in the wonder of her
worth: she is the Nature of perfection, in the perfection of Nature, where God,
in Christ, shows the glory of Christianity.

Time.
TIme is a continual Motion, which from the highest Moouer, has his operation
in all the subjects of Nature, according to their quality, or disposition: He
is in proportion, like a Circle, wherein, he walks with an even passage, to
the point of his prefixed place: He attends none, and yet is a servant to
all; he is best employed by wisdom, and, most abused, by folly: He carries
both the sword and the scepter, for the use both of Justice, and Mercy: He is
present in all Invention, and, can not be spared from Action: He is the
Treasury of Graces in the Memory of the wise, and, bringes them forth to the
world, upon Necessity of their use: He opens the windows of Heaven, to give
Light unto the Earth, and, spreades the cloak of the Night to cover the Rest
of labor: He closes the Eye of Nature, and waketh the spirit of Reason, he
trauelleth thorough the mind, and is visible, but, to the Eye of
Understanding: He is swifter then the wind, and yet, as still, as a Stone,
precious in his right use, but, perilous in the contrary: He is soon found
of the careful Soul, and quickly mist in the want of his comfort, he is soon
lost in the lack of Emploiment, and not to be recovered without a world of
Endeavor: he is the true man's peace, and the Thieves perdition, the good man's
blessing, and the wicked man's curse: He is known to be, but, his being
unknown, but only in his being, in a being above knowledge: he is a Riddle not
to be read, but in the circumstance of description, his name, better known
then his nature, and he that makes best use of him, has the best
understanding so him: he is like the study of the Philosophers stone, where, a
man may see wonders, and yet short of his Expectation: she is at the Invention
of war, Arms the Soldier, Maintains the quarrel, and makes the Peace: He
is the Courtiers Play-fellow, and, the Soldiers Schole-master, the Lawyers
Gain, and the Merchantes, Hope: His life, is Motion, and his love Action, his
honor, Patience, and his glory, perfection: He masketh Modesty and blusheth
Virginity, honoreth Humility, and graceth, Charity: In Sum, finding it a
world to walk thorough the wonder of his Worth, I will thus briefly deliver,
what I find truly of him: He is the Agent of the Living, and the Register of
the dead, the direction of God, and a great Worke-master in the world.

Death.
DEATH is an ordinance of God, for the subiecting of the world, which is
limited his time for the correction of Pride; in his substance, he is nothing,
being but only a deprivation, and in his true description, a name without a
nature: He is seen, but in a picture: heard, but in a tale: feared, but in a
passion: and felt, but in a pinch: He is a terror, but to the wicked, and a
skar-crow, but to the foolish: but to the wise, a way of comfort, and to the
godly, the gate of life: He is the case of pain, and the end of sorrow, the
liberty of the imprisoned, and the joy of the faithful: it is both the wound
of sin, and the wages of sin, the Sinners fear, and the Sinners doom. He
is the Sextons agent, and the Hangmans revenue, the rich man's dirge, and the
Mourners merry-day. He is a course of time, but uncertain, till he come, and
welcome but to such, as are weary of their lives: It is a message from the
Physician, when the Patient is past cure, and if the writ be well made, it is a
supra sedeas for all diseases: It is the heavens stroke, and the earths
Steward, the follower of sickness, and the forerunner to Hell. In sum,
having no pleasure to ponder too much of the power of it, I will thus conclude
my opinion of it* It is a stinge of sin, and the terror of the wicked, the
crown of the Godly, the staire of vengeance, and a stratagem of the Devil.

Faith.
FAITH is the hand of the soul, which lays hold of the promises of Christ in
the mercy of the Almighty: She has a bright eye, and a holy ear, a clear
heart, and a sure foot: she is the strength of Hope, the trust of Truth, the
honor of Amity, and the joy of Love: she is rare among the sons of men,
and hardly found among the daughters of weomen; but among the sons of God,
she is a conueyance of their inheritance, and among the daughters of Grace, she
is the assurance of their portions. Her dwelling is in the Church of God, her
conversation with the Saints of God, her delight with the beloved of God, and
her life is in the love of God: she knows no falsehood, distrusts no Truth,
breaks no promise, and coins no excuse, but as bright as the Sun, as swift
as the wind, as sure as the rock, and as pure as the gold, she looks toward
heaven, but lives in the world, in the souls of the Elect, to the glory of
Election: she was wounded in Paradise, by a dart of the Devil, and healed of
her hurt, by the death of Christ Jesus: she is the poor man's credit, and the
rich man's praise, the wisemans care, and the good man's cognizance. In sum,
finding her worth, in words hardly to be expressed, I will in these few words
only deliver my opinion of her: She is Gods blessing, and man's bliss,
reasons comfort, and virtues glory.

Fear.
FEAR is a fruit of sin, which drove the first Father of our flesh, from the
presence of God, and has bred an imperfection in a number of the worse part of
his posterity: It is the disgrace of nature, the foil of reason, the maime of
wit, and the slur of understanding: It is the palsy of the Spirit, where the
Soul wants faith, and the badge of a Coward, that cannot abide the sight of
a sword: It is weakness in nature, and a wound in patience, the death of hope,
and the entrance into despair: It is childrens awe, and fools amazement, a
worm in conscience, and a curse to wickedness. In brief, it makes the Coward
stagger, the Liar stammer, the Thief stumble, and the Traitor start: It is a
blot in Arms, a blur in Honor, the shame of a Soldier, and the defeat of an
Army.
