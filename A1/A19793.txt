A SERMON PREACHED BEfore His Majesty,

At Whitehall, on Easter day last, 1614.

By the Bishop of Elie, His Majesty's Almoner.

Jmprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1614.

PHILIP. II. 8HE humbled Himself, made obedient, unto death, even the death,
of the Cross.

9 For this cause, has God also, highly exalted Him; and given Him a Name,
above every name.

10 That, at the Name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of those in Heaven, and
in Earth, and under the Earth.

11 And that, every Tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is the Lord, to
the glory of GOD the Father.


The sum.
FOr this cause, God has exalted him (says the Text) Him, (that is Christ.)
And, for this cause are we now here, to celebrate this exalting. Of which His
exalting, this is the first day: and the Act of this day, the first step of it:
even, His rising again from the dead. Haec est clarificatio Domini nostri Jesus
Christi, quae, ab Eius resurrectione sumpsit exordium (says S. Augustine upon
this place.) This now, is the glorifying of our Lord Jesus Christ, which, took
his beginning, at His glorious resurrection.

Thus, is the sum and substance of this Text, set down by that learned
Father.

The division.
By him also, is it likewise divided to our hands: Into, Humilitas Claritatis
meritum; and, Claritas humilitatis praemium. Humility, other three.) Which
two, here and ever, are so fast linked together, as, there is no parting them.
I cannot, but touch, and I will, but touch the Merit (in the first verse: Opus
diei.

His exaltation.

And is, of two sorts. By God, (in the 9. verse,) And by us, (in the two last.)

Of his Person: Of his Name. Two Super's, either, one; Super-exaltauit Ipsum.
Nomen super omne nomen,

Knee, by the Tongue. The Knee, to bow to it, (verse 10.) The Tongue, to
confess it, (verse 11.) And both these, to be general; Every Knee, every
Tongue. And not in gross, but deduced into three several ranks: All in
Heaven, All in earth, All under the earth: which comprehends all (indeed) and
leaves none out. This acknowledgement, Knee, is by the Tongue more plainly
expressed: And this it is, That Jesus Christ is the Lord, Lord of all those
three. This, to the glory of God the Father.

But then last, take the use with us. That, since in Him, His humiliauit se
ipsum, ends in Super-exaltauit Deus: His humbling Himself, in Gods Exalting;
That, Verse 5.
the same mind be in us: And, the same end shall come to us. As his end was, so
ours shall be, in the glory of God the Father.

The Prayer, etc.

Propter quod, Verse 8.
For this cause.
We touch first upon this word. Propter.
It is the Axis and Cardo, the very point, whereupon the whole Text turns.

Propter; A cause there is. So God exalts ever; for a cause. Here, on earth,
otherwhile, there is an Exaltauit, without a Propter quod. Some, Esaias 12.15.
Est. 3.1. Nehem. 4.1.
as Sobna, Haman, Sanballat, sometimes exalted; no man knows, wherefore. With
God, there goes ever; with men, there should go, a Propter quod, before
Exaltauit.

For a cause: for what? for this cause. And this now, Propter quod.
casts us back to the former verse, where it is set down, Humiliauit: There
it is, for His Humility.

Now, Humiliauit.
of all causes, not for that: if we go by this world, which (as the proverb
is) was made for the presumptuous. Not, for that virtue, of all others. A
virtue, (before Christ thus graced it) so, out of request, as, the
Philosophers, (look into their Ethiques) you shall (...) so much as find the
name of humility, in the list of all their virtues. Well, this cast virtue, of
no reckoning: is here made the Propter quod, of Christ's exalting. As, Luke 1.48.
Respexit humilitatem, the ground, of His Mothers Magnificat. And He, that, by
Him, 2. Cor. 4.6.
brought light out of darkness, at the first: will by Him, bring glory out of
humility at last, Or, this book deceives us. With God, it shall have the
place of a Propter quod; how poor account soever, we make of it here.

But, this Quod, is a Collectiue; there be in it, more points then one. I will
but point at them.

Humiliauit Ipse, Ipse. 1.
He humbled (He:) which many times is idle, but here, a circumstance of great
weight. He: so great a Person; being in the form of God, Verse 6.
and without any disparagement at all, equal to God (as he tells us a verse
before) He, humbled. Vbi, Maiestatem p^amisit; vt humilitatem illustraret. That
discourse of His High Majesty, was but to set out, to give a luster to His
humility. For, for one of mean estate, to be humble, is no great praise: It
were a fault, if he were not. But, in al^o nihil altum supere: For a King (as
David) to say, 2. Sam. 6.22.
I will yet be more humble: For the King of Kings, for Him, to show this great
humility; that is a Propter quod indeed. Humiliauit Ipse.

Humiliauit Ipse se. Ipse se, Se.
and not alius ipsum; that he was not brought to it by any other, but of his
own accord, He humbled himself. There is a difference between humilis, and
humiliatus. One may be humbled, and yet not humble. Phara^ was humbled, Exodus
10.16.
brought down by his ten plagues. Matthew. 27.32.
Simeon of Cyrene, angariatus, to humble his neck under the Cross. This was,
alius ^psos. But Ipse se, is the true humility. For then, it is ^audabils
vol^a^tate, not miserabili necessitate: or a willing mind; and that is,
commendable not of force and constrain* for that, is miserable. For this cause
that He humbled himself.

Humiliauit ipse se (Obediens) It was not Absaloms humility, Obediens.
in show and complement* and his heart full of pride, disobedience, 2. Sam.
15.5.
yea rebellion. (And yet it is a glory for humility, that even proud men take
a pride, to shroud themselves in her mantle: that pride wears humilities
liuerie.) But, it is not humble courtesy, but humble Obedience, that is the
Propter quod. Till it come to that, many bear themselves in terms and show,
low, ad humum; even touch the ground. But come once thither, to obedience;
then, give laws they must, but obey none; make others obedient, (and ye will)
but not- factus obediens, not made themselves so. Christ was so made. And for
this cause.

Humiliauit ipse se Obediens, would not serve, Factus.
and no more; but (factus), must be added. Somewhat there was, in that. An
Obedience there is, that comes from the dictamen of natural reason: In some
things we so obey; we will do it, because our reason so moves us. That is,
Obediens natus. But, some other there be, wherein there is no other reason, to
lead us to do it, but only this, that it is enjoined us by a lawful
Superior, and therefore we do it, and for no other cause. This is Obediens
factus; and that in true proper terms, is the right obedience indeed. All,
look to the former; and very few obey thus. Luke 2.5^.
But even so obeyed Christ, and erat subditus illis. And for this cause then,
that He was factus Obediens.

Obediens factus, (vsque) is a fifth. For the very size, Vsque.
the extent of our obedience is a matter considerable. For if we come to any,
Acts 26.28.
it is Agrippa's, in modico, in some petty small matter. 1. Sam. 15.9.
Or Saul's, in the refuse of the spoils little worth. And, that obedience is
little worth, that is so shrunk up. The drawing out, the vsque of it, is all
in all. How far obedient? until what? Vsque quo? Which very Extent, or
vsque, is many times as much worth as the Obedience it self. This also will
come into the Propter quod.

Now, many Vsque's there be, in this, of His. 1. Vsque naturam hominis,
Thither. His very humanity had been humility enough. 2. Vsque formam Serui,
Verse 7.
is more:
How? 1. Sam. 25.41.
Even to wash the feet of thy servants, (said Abigail) and took her self to
be very humble in so saying. John 13.5.
Thither he came too.

vsque mortem (the sixth point) mortem? Mortem.
that will stagger the best of us. We love Obedience in a whole skin: Job
2.4.
Vsque any thing, rather then that. And to (say troth) no reason in the world,
obedience should come to that. Romans 6.23.
Death is the wages of sin, of disobedience. Factus obediens? what, And
factus reus too? Obedient, and yet put to death? Heaven and earth should ring
of it, if the case were ours. Well, even thither came his obedience: Et, ne
perderet obedientiam, perdidit vitam. And rather then to lose his obedience,
lost his life. This is indeed, a great Propter quod.

vltima linea, (we say) Nay, Mortem autem Crucis.
there is yet an Autem more behind, to make it up full seven. For, One death is
worse then another. And His, was Mortem autem, the worst death of all: the
death of malefactors: and, of the worst sort of malefactors, Mortem Crucis.

Nay; if He must die, let him die, an honest, a fair death. Not so: Sapient.
2.20.
nay Morte turpissima, (said they of it, that put him to it,) the foulest death
of all other: vsque mortem, mortem autem crucis.

Died; and, so died. Ever the (So) the manner is more then the thing it self,
in all of Christ. To be borne, (So) to be borne, vsque praesepe, Luke 2.7.
to the Cratch: To die, nay (So) to die, vsque crucem, to the Cross. Vsque
naturam hominis; vsque formam Serui; vsque mortem malefici? 1. So great a
Person: 2. Thus to humble: 3. Humble His own self: 4. To be obedient: 5. To
be made obedient: 6. obedient with an vsque, so far; 7 So far, as to
death: 8 And to a death, so opprobrious:
These Extensiues, and Intensiues put together, will (I trus) make up a perfect
Propter quod. And this, for humilitas claritatis meritum, (in the first verse.)

NOw, Verse 9.
for Claritas humilitatis praemium, (in the rest.) And, will ye observe how
they answer one another? For humiliauit there, Here is exaltauit: For Ipse
there; Deus, God here: For Ipse se, Deus ipsum. He humbled himself; God
exalted him. For humiliauit vsque, there: here, is exaltauit super: For, factus
obediens; Here factus Domi^^^. For mortem crucis, the death of the Cross
there: Here, is the glory of God the Father.

This exalting, we reduced to two. Of his person; Of his Name. Of his Person,
Super-exaltauit Ipsum.
in superexaltauit ipsum: Of his Name, (in the rest of the verse.)

To begin, with His personal exaltation. S^per-exaltauit, is a decompound.
There is, Ex, and Super, (both) in it. His exalting has an Ex, whence, or out
of what. His exalting has a super, whither or whereunto.

Ex, from whence? Ex.
from the two very last words Mortem Crucis. His raising to life opposed to
Mortem, the sorrows of death. The giving of His Name; to Crucis, the shame of
the Cross. This days (Ex) was from death. His humiliauit, had been ad h^^um,
to the ground. Nay further, into the ground; Nay further yet, Ephesians. 4.9.
(...) into the very lowest parts of it. His exaltauit then, was from thence,
from death; and not the g^^es of death, (then, he was not in: Psalm. 9.13.49.15.
) nor the jaws of death, (then he was not, quite down) but from inferiora,
Prou. 7.27.
and interiora, the lowermost, and innermost rooms of death. From under the
Stone; Matthew. 28.^.
Thence: From the Dungeon, Gene. 40.15.
with Joseph; From the bottom of the Danne, Dan. 6.23.
with Daniel; From the Belly of the Whale, Iona^ 2.10.
with Jonas. (All three, Types of Him) There is His, Ex.

Now then, Super.
whither? From death, to life: From shame, to glory; From a death of shame, to
a life of glory. From the form of a servant; in factus obediens, to the
digni^ie of a Sovereign, in factus Dominus.

But will ye mark again? For, Non ficut delictum, Romans 5.15.
fic donum (says he, elsewhere.) So here, not as His humbling, so was his
exalting: but more. That of His humbling; was dispatched in one verse. This, of
His exalting, has no less then three. So the amends is large, three to one.

But, that is not it I mean: But this: Super is not thither only, but above
and beyond it. From death to life. Nay, Super; more then so: John 11.44.
Not Lazarus life, to die again, but life immortal: vt vitam habeat, and
abundantius habeat: That, abundantius, Ioh. 10.10.
is ^^mortalitie. From shame to glory: only that? Nay, Super, to the glory of
the Father, that is) glory, that shall never fade, 1. Pet. 1.4.
as all here shall. So, downward, it was but vsque, had his stint, so far,
and no farther: upward now, it is, Super, no stint, but higher and higher still.

This day is the feast of the first fruits. Leuit. 23.10.
On it, He had no more, but the first fruits of His exalting. He was exalted,
Ion. 2.10.
but with Jonas exaltation only, from the lower parts, to the upper parts of
the earth. But we shall follow Him higher, to the exaltation of Elias, 2. Reg.
2.11.
Super, above the clouds: Nay, Super, above the Stars, above the Heavens, and
the heavens of the heavens: till we have brought Him, from de profundis, to in
excelsis; from the lowest parts of the earth, to the highest place in Heaven,
even to the right hand of God. And higher, we cannot go.

Will ye observe yet once more, a kind of Omen or presage, of both these
exaltings; and that, at the very time of His humiliation? For, even that His
humiliation was acted, after the manner of an exalting (though in a mere
mockery.) For, to all their disgraces, they added this, of scorn. They lift
Him up, upon His Cross, for all the world, Iudie. 16.25.
as the Philistines did Samson, set Him aloft, between the two pillars, to
make sport at him. This was his exaltation. And they gave Him a Name too, Mar.
15.26.19.18.
Pilates title over His head; And bowed their Knees; And cried, Aue Rex (a
kind of Confession.

This, as they performed it, was grande ludibrium; but as God turned it, it was
grande mysterium. For, to earnest, God turned both. A kind of strife, there
seemed to be: the lower they, the higher God; the more odious they sought to
make Him; the more glorious, God: He Exalted His Person, in stead of the
Cross, to His own high throne of Majesty. And in stead of Pilates title,
gave Him a Title of true honor, above all the Titles in the world.

And this, for Super-exaltauit ipsum: And so, I pass from the exalting of His
person, (the amends for Mortem.) And come to the exalting of His Name, (the
amends for Crucis) (in the latter part of the same verse.)

He gave him a Name. For, Dedit El Nomen.
without a Name, what is exalting? What is His Natinitie without an Epiphanie?
For, to those two, may these two here well be compated. His Resurrection, is a
very Nativity. To it, does S. Paul apply the verse of the Psalm H^die
genuite, Acts. 13.33.
Acts 13. And this Name-giring, is as the Epiphanie; to make it apparent and
known to the world. And indeed, they are things exalted or lift up, but that
they may be in view, and notice taken of them? So that, they which be exalted,
seem not so to be, till their so being, be made public, and, there go a
Name of it abroad in the world.

And sure, when men are so high, as higher they cannot be, (as Kings) there is
no other way to exalt them, left us, but this; to spread abroad, to dilate
their names. Which, every noble generous spirit, had rather have, then any
dignity, though never so high. For, being in their dignities, how far will
they venture; even to ieopard dignity, life and all: and all, but to leave a
glorious Name behind them? That, To give a Name, is even to exalt His very
exaltation it self; and to make him, that is at the highest, higher yet.

Super omne Nomen.
A Name be gave him: what Name? not (inter) among the famous names on earth;
but (Super) omne nomen, above them all. Here is, Super upon Super: another
Super to His Name, no less then His Person. That, above all Persons; and this,
above all names whatsoever. And now, by this time, His Exaltation is complete,
and not one (Super) to be added more.

This Name, is named in the verse, and it is the Name of Jesus. Of the giving
first, And then of the Super of it.

Of the giving, Dedit ei.
three doubts arise. 1. How given Him, and others had it also? 2. How given Him
now, and He had it before, even in the womb of his Mother? 3. How given Him
of grace, and yet He deserved it Propter quod.


How is this Name said to be given Him, Dedit ei.
(as some special dignity) and others had it beside and before Him? Jesus the
Worthy, Others had it. Heb. 4.8.
the soune of Nun. Jesus the high Priest, Agg. 1.1.
the son of Iosedek, (to say nothing of Jesus the son of Sirach.) They had
it (it is true) but not given them by God, as He, Matthew. 1.21.
by the mouth of the Angel, Gods deputy. But they, by men, had men to their
Godfathers. As, now, we have a Sect or Society of Jesus: but they gave
themselves the Name: God never gave it them. He gave it here, for humiliauit,
a virtue they little regard: For he that does but smell of it, is, eo ipso,
not meet to be of that Company. Other manner spirits, they.

I have before this, told you, Sermon. at Christm, 1610.
of four maine differences, between this Jesus, and all others. This one now,
shall serve for all. All those Iesu's, and every one of them, had need of, and
were glad, to lay hold of the skirts of this Jesus, Zach. 8.23.
to be saved by Him. (otherwise they had been falsely so called) lost men,
all. And so, will be willing, to resign this Name to Him; that He, may (at
least) bear it, with a maine difference, from them all. Dedit ei.


But what tell ye us, of it now, He had it before.
after the Resurrection? do not we know, it was given Him, being yet in the
womb? It was so, but by a kind of anticipation. For, it never had the perfect
verifying, the full Christendom (as they say) till this day. Not yet full
three days since, they vpbraided Him with it, Jesus, a Savior, A wise
Savior, Matthew. 27.42.
and cannot save Himself! For, He seemed to perish then, to lose His life, in
their sight: but, now, this day taking it again, He showed, He did but lay
it down, Ioh. 10.18.
He lost it not: He was now Jesus indeed, able to save himself: and able to
save all those, Hebr. 5.9.
that trust Him with their salvation. So; it was never in kind till now; but
now, it was.

But, Dedit ei.
if He gave it Him, and (...) gave it Him, He did merit it.
of grace: where is the merit then, the Propter quod we spoke of, what is
become of that? Safe enough, for all this. That, which is otherwise due, it may
be so cheerfully parted with, as if it were a frank and free gift indeed.
The Apostle, elsewhere, has taught us to join debita and beneuolentia, 1.
Cor. 7.3.
in one: They will stand together well enough.

In many things, we suffer slander by the Church of Rome: In this among many;
as if we pinched at Christ's merit, and were loath, he should be allowed
Himself to merit ought, because of this (...), that sounds all upon grace.
Wherein, it is well known, take the most that can be made of it, and we say
no other thing, then do their own Schoolmen. It is not gratia adoptionis,
this; the grace of adoption, (as in us) that is, here spoken of: It is gratia
vnionis, the grace of union, And that grace Christ had. For, seeing, in the
humanity of Christ, there was not, there could not be, any possibility of
merit, to deserve the uniting it self, or the being assumed into the Godhead:
To be so assumed, and so united, was that grace, we term, the grace of union.
Other grace, we know none in Christ. But being once so united, there was in
Him, to deserve, and deserve again, and that, amply Propter quod, might then
be truly said of of Him, every way.

Super omne. Above all names.
This, for the giving. But now, how is this Name, said to be above all names?
what, above the Name of God? We may say, with the Apostle, 1. Cor. 15.27.
when he says, God did give it Him, it is manifest, he is excepted, that did
give it Him. But we need not so say. For, this is one of Gods own Names. I am
(says He) and beside me, Esa. 43.11.
there is no Savior.

How is it then given Him? Accepit vt homo, quod habebat vt Deus. What, as God,
He had; as Man, He received. With His nature. His Name; and the chief of all
His Names, the Name of a Savior. For above all, it is: Above all, to Him;
Above all, to us.

Above all to Him.
To Him: for though many Titles of the Deity, sound, and seem, to be more
glorious: Yet, He esteems them all, not like this: Why? For no other reason,
but that, they had not, nos homines, and nostram Salutem, in them. No Name He
sets by, like that, wherein, with His glory, is joined, out safety. And this,
of all He made choice of, (as, to Him, above all) that we might accordingly
esteem of Him, that esteems it above all, only, for our sakes.

Above all to Us.
But howsoever, to Him: To us sure, above all. For no Name, do we hold by,
Acts. 4.12.
No name under heaven, given us, whereby we may be saved, but it. To us, more
worth it is, then all, yea, (I may say,) then the very name of God. For, God in
Him reconcileth the world; without Him, is enemy to it, 2. Cor. 5.19.
and to us: So, with this Name, there is comfort in the Name of God: without
it, none at all. The Name (sure) which we have use of above all. For it is the
Name, which, in the depth of all our distress, by sin or by misery, we even
adjure Him by, vt rem nominis impleat, that he make good His own Name, show,
He bears it not for naught, and so, save us: That, He would never so remember
our wretched sins, as that thereby to forget His own blessed Name: That Name
specially, which He of all other most esteems: and so, of all other will
least forget. To Him then, and to us, both; it is Nomen super omne nomen. And,
so let it be; even Suprema lex, Salus: and supremum nomen, Jesus. To save, the
highest Law: And the Name of a Savior, the Highest Name. Let it so be, let it
ever stand Highest, and let no name whatsoever, get above it. And so, I come to
the tenth verse.

That at the Name of Jesus, etc. Verse 10.
At the Name of Jesus.
TO give Him such a Name, is one gift: To give Him, that for such a one, it
should be reputed and taken, is another: For, given it may be, on His part; and
not acknowledged on ours. So that, this is a new degree.

That God, though He have so exalted it, yet reckons it not exalted, unless we
do our parts also, unless our exaltation come to. At which words, comes in
our duty: The part, that concerns us. Thus to esteem it Super omne nomen,
above all: And in sign we so do, to declare as much. And therein, He leaves
us not to our selves, but prescribes the very manner of our declaration, how He
will have it: Namely, these two ways. The Knee to bow to it; the tongue to
confess it.

Knee and Tongue.
Now, these are outward acts, both. So then: first we are to set down this, for
a ground; that the exalting of the soul within, is not enough. More is
required by Him: more to be performed by us. He will not have the inward parts
only, and it skilles not for the outward members, though we favor our Knees,
and lock up our lips. No: Mental devotion will not serve: He will have,
both corporal and vocal, to express it by.

Our body is to afford her part, to His glory: And the parts of our body: And
namely, these two, the Knee, and the Tongue. Not only the upper parts, the
Tongue in our head: but even the nether also, the Knee in our leg. The words
be plain, I see not how we can avoid them.

Knee, two things. 1. He would have it bow. 2. Knee bow.
He would have it bow to His Name.
humility to exalt Him, who for His humility was exalted? Or what way more
fit, to express our humility by, then by this sign of humbleness? For, a
special way it is of exalting, or making a thing high, by falling down, and
making our selves low before it. Then secondly, That God cares for our knees:
will be served with them. 1. Reg. 19.18. Psalm. 95.6.
Negatiuely; He will not have them bow to Baal. Positiuely, He will have them
bow to Himself. Will ye believe Him, if He bind it with an oath? I have sworn
(says he) by my self that every Knee shall bow to me. Esa. 45.23. And will ye
make God forsworn? And it cannot be said, this is Old Testament: For even in
the New, Romans 14.11. These very words are applied to Christ, as meant to be
fulfilled in, and to Him.

But, this here in the Text, is more strong: that, It is assigned Him, (this
honor) as a part of His reward, for Mortem Crucis. And shall we rob Him, or
take from Him the reward of His Passion?

We begin our Liturgy every day, with the Psalm (And we had it from the
Primitive Church, they did begin theirs with the same.) Wherein we inuit
our selves to it: Come, Let Us worship, and fall down, and kneel before the
Lord our maker. Shall we ever say it, and never do it? Is not this to mock
God?

Primitive Church did so, did bow. And verily, He will not have us worship Him
like Elephants, as if we had no ioints in our Knees; He will have more honor of
men, then of the pillars in the Church. He will have us bow the knees. And let
us bow them in Gods Name.

Bow, to His Name.
To bow the Knee, And to His Name, to bow it, For, This is another prerogative.
He is exalted, to whose Person, Knees do bow: but He, to whose Name only, much
more. But the case, is here otherwise. Acts. 1.9.
For His Person is taken up out of our sight: Psa. 16.2.
all we can do, will not reach unto it. But, His Name, He has left behind
to us, that we may show by our reverence and respect to it, how much we
esteem Him, how true the Psalm shall be, Holy and reverend is His Name.
Psalm. 111.9.


But if we have much ado, to get it bow at all: much more shall we have to get
it done to His Name. 1. There be, that do it not.

What speak I of not doing it? There be, that, not only forbear to do it
themselves, but put themselves, to an evil occupation, to find faults where
none is, and cast scruples into men's minds, by no means to do it.

Name? Nay at the holy Mysteries themselves, not to do it: Where, His Name is
(I am sure,) and more then His Name, even the body and blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ: And those, not without His soul: Nor that, without His Deity: Nor all
these, without inestimable high benefits of grace, attending on them. And yet
they, Casar. Arelat. bow 30.
that would be glad and feign, a pardon for this life, or some other Patent,
with all humility to receive upon their knees: This, so great, so high, so
heavenly a gift, they strain, and make dangerous, to bow their knees to
receive it: as if it were scarce worth so much. But, it has ever been the
manner in Christ's Church, whether we Matthew. 2.11. Chrysostom. hom. ad pop. Antioch
61. Ambros. in Ps. 98 lib. 3.6 1^. de Spir. S^o. August^^^ Ps. 22. Ps. 48. and
Ep. 120, c 27.
offer to Him, or receive ought offered from Him, in this wise to do it.

But to keep us to the Name: This is sure, The words themselves are so plain,
as they are able to convince any man's conscience: And there is no writer (not
of the Ancient) on this place, A^^br^s Hexa. l. 6* c. 9. Hi. (...) in Esa 45.
Cyril in Esa. l. 4 O 3. Theodores in Phil. 2.
that I can find, (save he that turned all into Allegories) but literally
understands it, and likes well enough, we should actually perform it.

Yet will ye see, what subtilties are taken up, to shift this duty?

Knees are called for, and all have not Knees. Here are three ranks reckoned:
and two of them have none. What is that to us? we have: To us, it is properly
spoken, and we to look to it. And if this were ought, that the spirits in
Heaven and Hell have no bodies, and so no Knees: Why, they have no tongues
neither properly, and then by the same rule, take away comfessing too, and so
do neither.

But the Apostle, that in another place, gives the Angels tongues, 1. Cor. 13.1.
(with the tongues of men and Angels) might as well in this place, give them
Knees: they have one, as much as the other. And in both places, humanum dicit,
he speaks to us, Romans 6.19.
after the manner of men: that we by our own language, might conceive, what
they do. For, sure it is, the spirits of both kinds, as they do yield
reverence, so they have their ways, and means, to express it, by somewhat
(...) to the Knee. They do it their way: we to do it ours. And this is ours:
let us look to our own then, and not busy our brains about theirs. But for
us, and for our sakes, they are diverse times expressed in the Revelation,
Revel. 4.10.5.8.14.7.11.
even doing thus, falling down before Him.

Name, more then to the Name of Christ? The Name of Jesus.
There want not reasons why.

Christ, is not, cannot be, the name of God, God cannot be anointed. But Jesus
is the Name of God, and the chief Name of God (as we have heard.)

Christ, is communicated, by Him to others, namely, to Princes: So is not
Jesus: Esa. 43.11.
that is proper. Ego sum, and praeter me non est alius. And ever, that which is
proper, is above that which is holden in common.

Christ is anointed, to what end? to be our Savior. That is the end, then. And
ever, the end is above the means, ever the name of health, above the name of
any medicine.

this Name is exalted above all names, and this act, limited to it, in direct
words; ^^d so, this name above them, in this very peculiar: Why seek we any
further?

Thirdly. What? to the two syllables, Name. The Name is not the sound, but the
sense. The caution is easy then, do it to the sense; have mind on Him, that
is named, and do His Name the honor, and spare not.

Kneeling? I trow, not; but remove the superstition, and retain them still.
Do but even so here, and all is at an end.

Indeed, if it were a taken-vp worship, or some humane iniunction; it might
perhaps, be drawn within the case of the brazen Serpent. 2. Reg. 18.4.
But, being thus directly set down by God himself; in us, there may be
superstition; in it, there can be none. And, if it be in us, we are to mend
our selves; but not to stir the act, which is of Gods own prescribing. It
was never heard in Divinity, that ever superstition could abolish a duty of
the Text.

That, we set our selves to drive away superstition, it is well: But it will be
well too, that we so drive it away, as we drive not, all reverent regard and
decency away with it also. And are we not well toward it? We have driven it
from our head: for, we keep on, of all hands, And from out Knees; for, Kneel
we may not: we use not, (I am sure.) Sure, heed would be taken, that by taking
heed, we prove not superstitious: we slip not into the other extreme,
before we be aware: Which, of the two extremes, Religion worse endures; as
more opposite unto it. For, believe this, as it may be superstitiously used;
so it may irreligiously be neglected also.

Look to the Text then, and let no man persuade you, but that God requires a
reverent carriage, even of the body it self: And namely, this service of the
Knee; And that, to His Sons Name. Ye shall not displease Him by it, fear
not: Fear this rather, for the Knee, if it will not bow; that it shall be
stricken with somewhat, that it shall not be able to bow. And for the Name,
that they, that will do no honor to it; when time of need comes, shall
receive no comfort by it. And so I leave this point.

The tongue.
For, the Knee is not all: He further requires somewhat, from the Tongue. And
reason: That member, of all other, Psalm. 30.12.57.8.
the Psalmist calls our glory: a peculiar we have, more then the beasts: They,
will be taught to bow, and bend their joints: We have Tongues besides, to do
something more, then they. And indeed, the Knee is but a dumb acknowledgement,
does but signify implicit: but, a vocal confession, that does utter our
mind plainly. And so, is looked for, at our hands.

To confess.
This he calls, (...) Three things are in it. First, (...): speak we must,
say somewhat. And secondly, (...): do it together, not, some speak, and some
sit mute. And thirdly, (...): speak out, not whispering, or between the
teeth; but clearly and audibly. And this is (...). And it was the praise of
the Primitive Church, this, that jointly they did it, and alowd: that their
Amen, (as S. Hierome says) was like a clap of thunder; And their Alleluia, as
the roaring of the Sea: And no praise it is to us; who, as our joints are
stiff, to bow; so our voices, are hoarce to confess. We can neither see the
former, nor scarce hear the latter; as if, (there being but two duties in
the Text) we meant to suppress them both.

Knee first, and then Tongue.
The Knee, and the Tongue: Why the Knee first? why begins he there? They be
marshalled right. For, having, by our Knee bowed, put our selves in mind of
due regard of Him in fear and reverence; we are then the fitter to speak of
Him, and to Him, with that respect is meet: And, not be so homely with Him, as
in their gesture and speech both, some are: as if they were hail fellow, even
familiar with God. And all (forsooth) as they call it, to cast out the spirit
of bondage. From a heart possessed with the humble fear of God, from such a
heart, Confession is ever most kindly: Faith being, as the heart; and fear
being as the kings; (so the Fathers compare them:) It will get an heat, and an
ouer-heate, (our says;) if by fear, as cool air, it be not tempered: But,
faith and fear together, make the blessed mixture.

Every Knee.
The Tongue, and every Tongue; as the Knee, and every Knee, they to bow all,
Every Tongue.
and these all to confess. But for all that, not all alike. They, in heaven
cast down their crowns, Revel. 4.10.
and fall down themselves of their own accord: And confess Him, singing,
Luc. 2.14.
a^ at His birth, Revel. 15.3.4.8.5.9.
and in the Revelation diverse times. They, under the earth do it too, but not
vltro, are thrown down, footstool. So; Psalm. 110.1.
down they go, though sore against their wills: And confess Him too, though
roaring, Mark. 9.26.
and as it were upon the rack. They, on Earth, Angels, get them to their
Knees, gladly; and cheerfully confess Him: The rest, (as Infidels, and some
Christians little better, John 18.6.
) are forced to fall backward, and made, in the end to cry, Vicisti Galilaee;
Revel. 16.10.
though they gnaw their Tongues when they have done.

So, we see our lot: One way, or other, we shall come to it, all: if not now,
in die illo: Which is the reason, that Romans 14.11. the Apostle applies this
place in Esaias, to Christ's sitting in Judgment, at the latter day. Exalted, He
shall be, with our good wills; or whether we will or no. Either fall on our Knees
now; or be cast flat on our faces then: Either confess Him Cantando, with
Saints and Angels, or vlulando, with devils and damned spirits. For the Father
will be glorified in the Son, by the glorious Confession, of them that
yield; or the glorious confusion, of them that stand out.

Every Tongue.
The Tongue, and every Tongue: that is, every Speech, Dialect, Idiome Language,
in the world stand charged with this Confession. Omnis spiritus, Psalm 150.^
every spirit to give breath; and Omnis Lingua, every Tongue, to be as a
Trumpet, to sound it forth. And, where are they then, that deny any Tongue the
faculty here granted; Or bar any of them the duty here enjoined? That
lock up the public Confession (the chief of all other) in some one Tongue
or two, and send forth their Supersedeas to all the rest. No, His Title here,
has more Tongues then Pilat's on the Cross: That, had but three; this, has
every Tongue, what, where, whose soever, none except. A Praeludium whereof, was
in the Tongues sent from Heaven, whereby, every Nation under Heaven, heard,
Acts 2.6.
each in their own Tongue spoken, Magnalia Dei, the glad tidings of the Gospel.

Confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
But, though thus many Tongues, yet one Confession. Even this: that Jesus Christ
is the Lord. And, a blessed Confession it is (this) that Jesus (that is) a
Savior, that He, that such a one, is the Lord: that not a fleecer, or a
flaier, but a Savior, has the place: 2. That Christ, (that is) one which
saves, and cures unction, non punctione, with anointing, not with searing or
pricking, that we acknowledge Him, to be the Lord. Lord: before, by that He is
Son: And now Lord again, by virtue or His Propter quod.

Lord, whereof? Nay, not qualified, of such, or such a Place, Baronie, County,
Segniorie, but Lord in abstracto. But, it we will qualify Him, we may. Lord
of these three ranks of Confessors (here in the Verse) and of those three
places and Regions, that contein them: 1. Lord of Heanen, He gave the Keys of
it: 2. Lord of Earth: Matt. 16.19.
He has the Key of David, Revel. 3.7.
(and, if of His, of every Kingdom else:) 3. Lord of Hell, for, lo, the Keys
of Hell and of Death, Apoc. 1.18.
Of Death, to unlock the graves: Of Hell, to lock up the old Dragon, Revel.
20.3^
and his crew, into the bottomless pit. A great Lord: For, whither shall one
go, to get out of His dominion?

Well, if it be, but to confess this, that is no great matter; we will not
stick with Him; who cannot say, Jesus Christ is the Lord? That can no man
(says the Apostle) ( say it, 1. Cor. 12.3.
as it should be said,) but by the holy Ghost. For, confessing Him Lord, we
confess more things by Him, then one. For, two things go to it. 1. S. Peter
giver is one; 2. S. Paul, the other. Domine salua, pereo, says S. Peter. Save
Lord, Matthew. 14.30.
sink: A Lord to save. 2. Domine quid me vis ^^cere? Acts. 9.6.
says S. Paul.
Lord what service would thou I should do? A Lord to serve.

Saint Peter's, we like well; to succor and save us when we are in any danger:
He shall hear of us, then. But Saint Paul's quid me vis facere? when it comes
to that, then our confession fumbles, and sticks in our teeth. Nay then, Psalm.
12.4.
Quis est Dominus noster? we have no Lord (we) then. So, we play fust and
loose, with our confession; fast, at succor: loose, at service; in, at one;
out, at the other?

But what speak I of doing His will? when, if He do not ours, in each
respect; if, we have not this or that when we would: we fall from
confessing, and fall to murmuring. And it fares with us, not as if He were
Lord, and we to do His will: but as if, we (indeed) were the Lords, and He
to do ours: As if, there were nothing between us and Him; but He, to do our
turns, and then Tu autem Domine, His Lordship were expired and at an end.

Upon the point, thus it is: we confess it, the wrong way; the Lord to be
Jesus: but not, Jesus to be the Lord. O Lord be Jesus: but not, O Jesus be
Lord. O Lord be Jesus to save us: but not, O Jesus be Lord, to command us. So
that, all our humiliauit still, is without factus obediens.

Ye see then, it is worth the while, to confess this, as it should be
confessed. In this wise, none can do it, but by the Holy Ghost. Otherwise, for
an Oretenus only, our own ghost will serve well enough. But that, is not it.
Quid me vis facere? is it, that makes the Lord. He tells us so Himself, and
with a kind of admiration, that any should think otherwise. How call ye me
Lord (says He) and do not as I will you? Luke 6.46.
As much to say, as, It is to no purpose, Matthew. 7.21.
though you say Domine, Domine, double it, and treble it too, it will go for
no confession: Tit. 1.16.
if, a factis negant come in the neck of it: if, Saint Paul's Quid me vis
facere? be left out.

Confess to the glory of God the Father.
And this, is yet more plain, by the last words of all, Namely, that this
confession is so to be made, as it redound to the glory of God the Father.
Whose great glory, it is, that His son is Lord of such servants: That men
shall say, See what servants He has! how full of reverence to His Name, how
free, how forward to do His will. Herein is His Name much magnified. As on the
other side, it must needs be evil spoken of, Romans 2.24.
and that among the very heathen, when, not a Knee, got to bow* when this
syllable (Lord) comes out of our mouth, but no, Quid me vis facere? to follow
it. When they see, how vnseruicelike, our service is; how rude, our behavior
toward Him, and His Name, whom, we term Lord indeed; but use Him, nothing so:
But, come hither into His presence, and carry our selves here, for all the
world, as the fellow did before Augustus, of whom, Mecaenas well said: Hic homo
erubescit timere Caesarem. And, so we, as if we were ashamed, to seem to bear
any reverence, at all, to Him, or His Name. It would not be thus. I am privy,
there is no one thing, does more alien those, that of a simple mind refuse the
Church, then this; that they see so unseemly behavior, so small reverence
showed this way. But sure, the Apostle tells us, our carriage there, should be
such, so decent, as if a stranger, or unbeliever should come into our
assemblies, the very reverence He there sees, should make him fall down, 1.
Cor. 14.25.
and say, Verily God is among us; to see us, so respectively bear our selves;
in the manner of our worship.

JESUS is the Lord to the glory of God the Father.
This Confession that Jesus is the Lord, is to be, to the glory of God the
Father: So we take it one way. Or, this Confession is to be, that Jesus is the
Lord to the glory of God the Father: so another way. And both well. To confess:
that He is the Lord, that all His Lordship is, not to His own glory; but to
His Fathers. Think not then, that Gloria filio, shall abate ought of Gloria
Patrj. The Son is Lord, to the glory of His Father, and not otherwise. Let
that fear then be far from us, that in exalting the Son, we shall in the
least minute eclipse the glory of his Father. Here is no fear of emulation,
that it will prove the case, of Jupiter and Saturn. No, So blessed is the
accord of this Father, and this Son, as the Father thinks it some blemish
to His glory, if so profound humility, so complete obedience, He had not seen
highly rewarded, with Super upon Super. And the son, will admit of no glory,
that shall impair His Fathers in the least degree: For lo, He is Lord to the
glory of God his Father. This is the end of His (of Christ's;) And the same may
be the end of all Exaltations; that a Savior ever may be Lord, hold that
place: And hold it, and be Lord, not to His own, but to the Glory of God,
even God the Father.

The Conclusion.
THe end of all: And, we must needs know and take that, with us; for which, all
this here is brought: And it is a Lesson; even, His Discite a me; and it is a
Pattern; Matthew. 11.29.
even, His Exemplum dedi vobis, John 13.15.
to commend unto us, the virtue of the Text; the Propter quod of the Feast;
even Humility: Hoc erit signum, it is His sign at Christmas: Luke 2.12.
As His sign then, so His Propter quod now, at Easter. So, the virtue of both
Feasts: I will offer you but 3. short points touching it.

Humiliauit.
Et quomodo non humiliatur homo, Christ's Person.
coram humili Deo? How is not the Son of man humble, and the Son of God is?
Even for Him, to love it; for His very Person.

Work.
but in it, and by it, bringing to pass the work of our Redemption: Which,
cannot but extraordinarily commend this virtue to us; in that it has pleased
God, to do more for us, in this His Humility, then ever he did in all His
Majesty: even, to save and redeem us by it. John 10.38.14.11.
To love it, then; if not for Him, yet for the works sake.

Propter quod, Reward.
in the Text: if not for the work, yet for the Rewards sake. That, as Christ,
was no looser by it, no more shall we: For, all this Glory here, the way to it,
is, by the first Verse. Humiliauit, is the beginning; and the end of it is
Exalting. That, the mother; this, the daughter: all rises from Humiliauit ipse
se. James 4.10.
Humiliamini ergo, says S. James. 1. Pet. 5.6.
Humiliamini ergo, says Saint Peter; and after it there follows still, and
exaltabit vos Deus, a promise of a like glorious end. And what says the
Apostle here? This mind (says he) was in Christ; Verse 1.
and it was (...), ^ wise mind: That, we count it a wise mind, and worth the
carrying, and carry it; and it shall carry us, to the same iourneys end, it
brought Him: even to the glory of God the Father. This for Humility.

Obediens Donuno.
And what? Shall we not give some light ^^ial, of our Obedience also, to auerre
our Confession, that, He is our Lord? It would be, by, Domine, quid nos vis
facere? (that is the true trial.) Say then, Domine, quid nos vis facere? And,
he will answer us; Hoc facite in mei memoria^. Will ye know, what I would have
you do? Do this, in remembrance of me: In sign that I am Lord, do but this:
Here is a case of instance, and that now; even at this very present, a proof
to be made. By this, we shall see, whether He be Lord or no. For, if not this;
but, slip the collar here, and shrink away: Si rem grandem dixisset, 2. Reg.
5.13.
in a far greater matter, how would we stand with Him, then? We were wrong
before, here is the sound and syllables, (we spoke of,) here it is. For, all
is but sound and syllables, if, not this.

But of us, I hope for better things, Heb. 6.9.
that by our humble carriage, and Obedience (at least, in this) we will set our
selves, some way to Exalt Him, in this His day of Exaltation: Which, as it will
tend to His glory; so will He turn it to matter of our glory: and that, in
His Kingdom of glory: or (to keep the word of the Text) in the glory of God
the Father. That so, we may end, as the Text ends. A better, or more blessed
end there cannot be. And, to this blessed end, He bring us, that by His
Humility and Obedience has not only purchased it for us: but set the way
open, and gone it before us, JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, etc.
