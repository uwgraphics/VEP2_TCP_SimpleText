of the bosse of Byllyngesgate. unto London Stone.
Galaunt.


Right as small flodes / increase to waters fell
So yt narowe furrous / may not sustain.
Right so pride unclosed may not counsel
this new wretchedness yt causes us conplayne
How woe has wrapped us in a cruel chain
Our pride shows it well both terre and nere
England may wayie* that ever it came here
The sin that now regneth / to behold is ruthe.
Of fraud and dysceyte / great abhom ynacyon
But need constrayneth us / now to say the truth
Of pride and dysceyte / this new dyssymulacyon
That blyndeth and consumes / our English nacyon.
Lucyters progeny among us does appear
England may wayle that ever it came here
Right late stood our land in such prosperyte
Of chyualry / manhood / and rich marchaundyse
Thrughe all christian royalmes / sprange our felycyte.
Of great welthe and prowess / in sundry wise
Our sadness is changed / for the new guyse
We have eryled our welthe / I note where
England may wayle / that ever it came here.
Pride has found way to exclude man fro blys
In dysfygurynge nature / by this new array
Both men and women / can say what it is
For both need and pouerte / goth now right gaye
But alas our sorrow / increases every day
And if ye live long ye shall both se and here
That England shall wayle / that ever it came here.
For pride has our plente / turned to evil fare
And fedeth us as beestes / that draws in the ploughe
Many a worthy man / brings he to sorrow and care
Where fortune sometime / fresshely on him loughe
Examyne thy living that this world uses enough.
How / need with sin / grows every where
England may wayle that ever it came here
For many a vengeance as scripture makes mencyon
Has fallen to kingdoms in sundry wise
And finally put the people in dystruccyon
For their obstynacy / a new fangle guyse
Alas england that sometime was so wise.
Other nacyons refuse / have bought so dear
That thou may wayle / that ever it came here.
Sometime we had France / in great derysyon
For their hateful pride and loathsome uncleanness
Use we not now / the same in our regyon
And have permuted out welthe / for their gladness
Lechery of our people is become a maystres.
Our gentylnes / for galauntyse have we left there.
England may wayle that ever it came here.
It ye behold the galauntes progenye byperyous
That out of France be fled / for their intoxycacyon
Has now vengeance consumed / that royalme glorious
For their pride / and sinful abhomynacyon.
That all the world / may wayle their desolacyon
O France / why did not these galauntes abide there
England (...)
For in this name Galaunt / ye may express.
Seven letters for some cause in especyall
That fygureth ye. vii. deedly sins and their wretchedness
By whom man is made / to the devil thrall.
Was not pride cause of Lucyfers fall
Pride is in hell / and galauntes nygheth them nere.
England may wayle / that ever it came here
O thou gay galaunt / by thine unthrifty name
With gabbynge and glosynge / gettest that thou have
Gyle was thy father / and Ialousye thy dame
In Iettynge / in Jangling / thy days ben past.
For all thy glorious going / age gnaweth fast
Thy glased life and glotony / be glewed so in fere
That England may wayle^t that ever it came here
Appetytes of auaryce / be to them so amerous
Abusyon and arrogaunce / ben of one affynyte
Adventure and anger / ben aye so debatous.
Faynynge estate / of counterfeit auctoryte
Adulacyon of adventure / may thou not auaunt the
As a liar in goodness / in thine array do appear
England may wayle / that ever it came here
For all the land / lechery lepeth about
That good love and law / ben almoost lorne
Of lust and liking / ledest thou such a route
That sloth and lechery / have elennes to torn
Thou labourest to lose / that thy friends gat to forne
For lewdenes and lechery / ben so led in fere.
England may wayle that ever it came here.
Abhomynable accydye / accuses all our nacyon
Our aungelyke abstynence / is now refused.
Ferthermore of Antecryste / this new dyssymulacyon
Alas that such sorrow / among us is used
Our auaryce and hatred / have us so accused
That diverse aduersytees / seweth us year by year.
England may wayle that ever it came here.
For our wasting wretchedness / that wades so deep.
In our wanton werynge / of clothes to torn
To wyldenes and wrath / the world takes most keep.
For in wasting and vanyte / men reken not what is lorne
For wife and for women / for to were the horn.
That virtuous vyrgynyte / is deed and laid on bear
England may wayle that ever it came here
The noble course of nature / nycete has devoured
For need causes it to be our desolacyon
So has the new fangles / our wealth obscured
That neclygence nouryssheth necessyte / to our confusyon.
This causes our galauntes / by their nacyon
Neuerthryfte and thryueles / noye ever us so nere
England may wayle / that ever it came here.
For trygetours and tryflours / that tauernes haunte
Have troth and temperaunce / trodden under foot
Talewes and talking / and drinking ataunte.
As tyrauntes and traitors / toyllous in moote
Till they be tried out is there no boot
And trysed to baratrum / tossed in fere.
England shall wayle / that ever it came here.
O galaunt upon galaunt / and o thou galaunt gaye
And thou ruskyn galaunt / that pouerte does menace
For all thy warrocked hoode / and thy proud array
And thy parrocked pouche / that thou so fast do brace.
Thou busyest the / to counterfeit Lucyfers trace.
Think not to long / or thou dwell with him there
For the cursed ensample / that thou show here:
So many barefote people / and so few good lyuers
Has no man seen / sith the world began
So many styroppes / and so few good chyuallers
And so many braynles / that little good can
Men arrayed as women / and woman as man
This causes death / and that all thing is so dear
England may wayle / that ever it came here
So much richesse and array / and so much need
So many bedes borue / and so little devotion
So much fasrynge for hungre / and so little need
So much painted worship / and so little reason
I trow no man has seen / in this regyon
Our sin asks vengeance / I am in great fere.
In short time we shall wayle / that ever it came here.
How many points were they now a days
And yet a good point / among them were hard to find
Daggers of vengeance / ready to make frayes.
With long taters down to the ars behind
Tryppynge with small shankes / as light as lefe on lynde.
To make it toughe and fresshe / as it were the new year
England may wayle that ever it came here
So many purfled garments / furred with non sequitur
With so many penyles purses / has no man saw.
Small gyrdynge in the waste / with all their other mustur
That we go all backewarde / from high to law
Y^ florysshynge mede of our wealth / we have bego^ to mawe
But we beseech god / amend us another year
Or else we shall wayle that ever it came here
Our women are dyspoyled / and give them to wantones
Our men with cloutes / at their breast like a pie
Our women have debated / with shamefastnes
And our men with uncleanness / it I shall not lie
O england thou may weep with Ieromye
Seeing the people thus led by the ere.
England may wayle that ever it came here.
Our women in their part / labor as they may
In their array with chere and countenance
Our men on their side make them fresshe and gay
And labor to purchase / women's pleasaunce
Thus between both grows much myschaunce
Each seeks sin as does appear.
England may wayle / that ever it came here.
Our galauntes live / in lusts as beestes.
Maynteynours of quarelles / and vnthryftynes.
Our shameless women with their high crestes
Extorcyon / robbery / and our vngentylnes.
Prelatis neclige^ce lordis rauayn and marchau^tis deceytes
These asks vengeance / this lesson must ye lere
Else shall ye wayle / that ever it came here.
Behold these days / the people of our nacyon.
Are charged with sin / and governed by folly.
How need will compel us / by transmygracyon
With very woe / drive unto Babylonye.
O england / where is now thy glory
That sometime shone / thrughe the world so clear.
Well may thou wayle / that ever this sorrow came here.
All people labor of this new dysguysynge.
In forgynge their fantasyes / to maynteyne pride.
He is now wysest / that can most of deuysynge
Good making of a man is now laid on side
This new array is brought up / in this land so wide
And yet for all that it may not last a year
England may wayle that ever it came here
Behold the rolled heddes / stuffed with flocks.
The new broched doublettes / open at the breasts
Stuffed with pectoll / of their loves smockes.
Their gowns and their cotes / shredde all in lystes
So many cappes as now be / and so few good priests
I can not reken half the route of their marde gere.
England may wayle that ever it came here.
These galauntes / use also full abhomynacyon.
Their typpettes be wrythen / life to a chain.
And they go haltered in them / as horse in the stable
It is a peryllous pronostycacyon certain
For sinful souls / shall be bound in pain
Hand and foot in perpetual fire.
They shall curse the time / that ever it came here.
All these new bulwarks / they were at their knees
They labor sore in their wits / fantasyes to find
No man holds him content / with his degrees
Pride goth before / and shame comes behind
Alas that English men / should be so blind
So much sorrow among us and so little fere
We may wayle the time that ever it came here
Forget not lightly / how many strangers.
Have entered this kingdom / and kept the possessyon.
Five times / as writes old chronicles
And changed our tunges / in sundry dyuysyon.
O elergy / pray for our English nacyon
That god for his mercy / of this sin make us clear
Else we shall wayle / that ever it came here
Effectually pray god / for his reformacyon.
Of wealth / manhood / and of marchaundyse.
And tresoury of peace / that Christ in his passion
Left between god and man / when he should dye.
The comynalte in love / conserve perseuerauntlye
With charity both high and low to Join in fere
In voydynge of sin that tourmenteth us here
O england / remember thine old sadness
Pray god thou may rejoice / thine old felycyte
Exyle pride and releue to thy goodness
For sin has consumed / this worlds humanyte
That thou may resore / again to thy gladness
And his blessed mother / as this land is her dowere
For we have cause to wayle that ever it came here
Thus ends this galaunt.

Here begins the marriage of London Stone and the fair pusell the bosse of
Byllyngesgate.
Harken unto me / both loud and still
And to this matter / lay to your eere
And of your advise and also your good will
Of this little prosses / yt after does appear.
Of.ii. yt have dwelte i^ london many a year.
And now is dysposed / to be man and wife
Help the^ with your charity / to bye their wedding gere
For they be both naked / and not worth an halfpeny knyfe.
To you their names / I will declare
If ye know any Impedymente.
The one is the bosse of Byllyngesgate of beauty so fair.
And the other London Stone / curtes and gente
This is their purpose and hole entente
To be married / as soon as they may
He that would let them I would he were shente
It would do you good to se them dance and play.
For now ye great love / yt is between them twain.
And neither of them looked other in the face.
London Stone answered / full wisely again.
Where is no love / there lacks grace
But evil tunges is so vnmylde
And of late has said / in a place where they dydemete
^ow the Besie of byllyngesgate / has had a child.
By the well with two buckettes in bishop gate street.
It were able to make any woman weep
To be so deedly belyed as is the good Bosse.
The man is in sins deep
That robs her so of her good lose
For to his soul it is daungerouse.
Thus says London Stone / of prudence so wise
He that in sclaunder / any will dysclose.
Of the deuylles reward / he shall not mysse
Therefore let my wife and me alone.
For by my study and waking many a night.
I know by the sterres / that shone by the moon.
That fair Bosse / holy was in my sight
And that to my nature / she should be coequall.
And remain as my fere / ever in my sight.
By the purueyaunce / of the gods Imperyall
To my comfort shynynge as the sterres bright
Wherefore I beseech you / in humble wise
To report the best in every place
And say no worse / than may be to your praise.
Which Iupyter had ordained of his great grace
Long or that we came in to this town
For our comfort / and for our solace.
As man and wife by dyuyne prouysyowne
Therefore are we greed to remain in this place.
Sith the gods above / has destyned them so.
Let us be merry and think how they dance
For it is a goodly couple of them two.
For in their behauoure / was never found varyaunce
As knows all that here be present
Which bring the herers / to life eternal.
Where god is regnynge permanent
Among his aungelles celestyall
Finis.
