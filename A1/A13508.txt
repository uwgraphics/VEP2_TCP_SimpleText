Reader take this in your way.
A Pamphlet (Reader,) from the press is hurld,
That has not many fellows in the world:
The maner's common, though the matter's shallow,
And it is all true, which makes it want a fellow.
And because I would not have you either guld of your money, or deceived in
expectation, I pray you take notice of my plain dealing; for I have not given
my book aswelling bumbasted title, of a promising inside of news; therefore
if you look for any such matter from hence, take this warning, hold fast your
money, and lay the book down: yet if you do buy it (I dare presume) you shall
find somewhat in it worth part of your money; the troth is that I did chiefly
write it, because I am of much acquaintance, and cannot pass the streets, but
I am continually stayed by one or other, to know what news, so that sometimes
I am four hours before I can go the length of too pair of butts, where such
nonsense or senseless questions are propounded to me, that calls many
seeming wise men's wisedoms in question, drawing aside the curtains of their
vnderstandiug, and laying their ignorance wide open. First John Easy takes me,
and holds me fast by the fist half an hour, and will needs torture some
news out of me from Spinola, whom I was never near by 500 miles; for he is
in the Pallatinate country, and I was in Bohemia. I am no sooner eased of him,
but Gregory Gandergoose, an Alderman of Gotham catches me by the goll,
demanding if Bohemia be a great town, and whether there be any meare in it,
and whether the last fleet of ships be arrived there: his mouth being stopped, a
third examines me boldly, what news from Vienna, where the Emperors army is,
what the Duke of Bauaria does, what is become of Count Buquoy, how fares all
the Englishmen; Where lies the King of Bohemiaes forces, what Bethlem Gabor
does, what tidings of Dampeier, and such a tempest of inquisition, that it
almost shakes my patience in pieces. To ease my self of all which, I was
enforced to set pen to paper, and let this poor pamphlet (my harrald or
nuntius) travel and talk, whilst I take my ease with silence. Thus much I
dare affirm, that whosoever he or they be, that do scatter any scandalous
speeches against the plenty in Bohemia of all manner of needful things for the
sustenance of man and beasts, (of the which there is more abundance then ever
I saw in any place else) or whatsoever they be that report any ill success on
the Kings party, this little book, and I the Author does proclaim and prove
them false liars, and they are to be suspected, for coining such falsehoods, as
no well-willers to the Bohemian prosperity. One thing I must entreat the
Readers patience in reading one hundred lines; wherein, I have kept a filthy
stir about a beastly fellow, who was (at my going from England, a piece of a
Graues-end Constable) at which time he did me such wrong, as might have
drawn my life in question; for he falsely said that I would have fired their
Town. I did promise him a ierke or two of my pen at my return; which now I
have performed, (not out of any malice, but because I would be as good as my
word with him.) Thus craving you to read if you like, and like as you list. I
leave you a book much like a prattling Gossip, full of many words to small
purpose.

Yours, as you are mine. John Tailor

TAILORS TRAVELS, FROM THE CITY of London in England, to the City of Prague
in Bohemia.
I Come from Bohem, yet no news I bring,
Of business 'twixt the Keysar and the king:
My Muse dares not ascend the lofty stairs
Of state, or write of Princes great affairs.
And as for news of battles, or of War,
Were England from Bohemia thrice as far:
Yet we do know (or seem to know) more here
Then was, is, or will ever be known there.
At Ordinaries, and at Barbers shopps,
There tidings vented are, as thick as hopps,
How many thousands such a day were slain,
What men of note were in the battle taken,
When, where, and how the bloody fight begun,
And how such sconces, and such towns were won;
How so and so the armies bravely met,
And which side glorious victory did get:
The month, the week, the day, the very hour,
And time, they did oppose each others power,
These things in England prating fools do chatter,
When all Bohemia knows of no such matter.
For all this summer, that is gone and past,
Until the first day of October last,
The armies never did together meet,
Nor scarce their eye sight did each other greet:
The fault is neither in the foot or horse,
Of the right valiant brave Bohemian force,
From place to place they daily seek the foe,
They march, and remarch, watch, ward, ride, run, go,
And grieuing so to waste the time away,
Thirst for the hazard of a glorious day.
But still the enemy does play bopeepe,
And thinks it best in a whole skin to sleep,
For neither martial policy, or might,
Or any means can draw the foe to fight:
And now and then they conquer, spoil and pillage,
Some few thatcht houses, or some pelting village;
And to their trenches run away again,
Where they like foxes in their holes remain,
Thinking by lingering out the wars in length,
To weaken and decay the Beamish strength.
This is the news, which now I mean to book,
He that will needs have more, must needs go look.
Thus leaving wars, and matters of high state,
To those that dare, and knows how to relate,
I Will only write how I past here and there,
And what I have observed every where,
I Will truly write what I have heard and eyed,
And those that will not so be satisfied,
I (as I meet them) will some tales devise,
And fill their cares (by word of mouth) with lies:
THe month that bears a mighty Emp'rours name,
( Augustus hight) I passed down the stream,
Friday the fourth, Just sixteen hundred twenty
Full moon, the sign in Piscis, that time went I;
The next day being saturday, a day,
Which all great Britain well remember may,
When all with thanks do annually combine,
Unto the Almighty majesty divine,
Because that day, in a most happy season,
Our Soueragne was preserved from Gouries treason;
Therefore to Churches people do repair,
And offer sacrifice of praise and praire,
With bells and bonfires, every town addressing,
And to our gracious King their loves expressing,
On that day, when in every nooke and angle,
Fag gots and bauins smoked, and bells did iangle:
Only at Graues-end, (why I cannot tell,)
There was no spark of fire, or sound of bell,
Their steeple, (like an instrument vnstrung,)
Seemed (as I wish all scolds) without a tongue,
Their bonfires colder then the greatest frost,
Or chiller then their charities (almost)
Which I perceiving, said I much did muse,
That Graues-end did forget the thankful use,
Which all the towns in England did observe;
And cause I did the King of Britain serve,
I and my fellow, for our Masters sake,
Would (near the waters side) a bonfire make;
With that a Scotch man, Tompson by his name,
Bestowed four faggots to increase the flame,
At which (to kindle all) a Graues-end Baker,
Bestowed his bauine, and was our partaker:
We 18 foot from any house retired,
Where we a jury of good faggots fired;
But ere the flame, or scarce the smoke began,
There came the fearful shadow of a man,
The Ghost or Image of a Constable,
Whose frantic actions (downeright dunce-stable,)
Armed out of France and Spain, with Bacchus bounty:
(Of which there is plenty in the Kentish county,)
His adle coxcomb with tobaco puff'd`
His guts with ale full bumbasted and stuffed,
And though half blind, yet in a looking glass,
He could perceive the figure of an ass;
And as his slauering chapps nonsense did stutter,
His breath (like to a iakes) a sent did utter,
His legs indenting scarcely could bear up,
His drunken trunk (over charged with many a cup.)
This riff raff rubbish, that could scarcely stand,
(Having a staff of office in his hand,)
Came to us as our fire began to smother,
Throwing some faggots one way, some another,
And in the Kings name did first break the peace,
Commanding that our bonfire should succease.
The Sotchman angry at this rudnes done,
The scattered faggots, he again laid on:
Which made the demi Constable go to him,
And punch him on the breast, and outrage do him;
At which a cuffe or twain were given, or lent,
About the ears, (which neither did content.)
But then to hear how fearful the ass braid,
With what a hideous noise he houl'd for aid,
That all the ale in Graues-end, in one hour,
Turned either good, bad, strong, small, sweet, or sour:
And then a kennell of incarnate currs,
Hanged one poor Thomson, like so many burrs;
Haling him up the dirty streets, all foul,
(Like devils pulling a condemned soul.)
The Iaylor (like the grand deu'll) gladly sees,
And with an itching hope of fines and fees,
Thinking the Constable, and his sweet self,
Might drink and quaffe with that ill gotten pelf;
For why such hounds as these, may if they will,
Under the show of good, turn good to ill;
And with authority the peace first break,
With Lordly domineering over the weak,
Committing (often) they care not whom or why,
So they may exercise themselves thereby,
And with the iaylor share both fee and fine,
Drowning their damned gain in smoke and wine:
Thus hirelings Constables, and iaylors may,
Abuse the kings liege people night and day,
I say they may, I say not they do so,
And they know best if they do so or no.
They haled poor Thomson all along the street,
Tearing him that the ground scarce touched his feet,
Which he perceiving, did request them cease
Their rudenes, vowing he would go in peace,
He would with quietness go where they would,
And prayed them from his throat to loose their hold.
Some of the townsmen did entreat them there,
That they their barbarous baseness would forbear,
But all entreaty was like oil to fire,
Not quenc'd; but more enflamed the scuruy squire.
Then they afresh began to hale and tear,
(Like mungrell mastifes, on a little Bear,)
Leaving kind Tompsom neither foot or fist,
Nor any limb or member to resist,
Who being thus oppressed with ods and might,
Most valiant with his teeth, began to bite,
Some by the fingers, others by the thumbs,
He fang'd within the circuit of his gummes;
Great pitty'twas his chapps did never close,
On the half Constables, cheeks, ears, or nose;
His service had deserved reward to have,
If he had marked the peasant for a knave:
Yet all that labor had away bin thrown,
Through town and country he is already known;
His prisoner, he did beat, and spurned and kicked,
He searched his pockets (I Will not say he picked)
And finding (as he said) no money there,
To hear how then the bellwether did swear,
And almost tearing Tompson into quarters,
Bound both his hands behind him with his garters,
And after in their rude robustious rage,
Tide both his feet, and cast him in the cage,
There all night he remained in lousy litter,
Which for the Constable had bin much fitter,
Or for some vagabond (that is sprung from Caine,)
Some rogue or runagate, should there have lain,
And not a Gentleman that is well descended,
That did no hurt, nor any harm intended:
But for a bonfire in fit time and place,
To be abused and used thus beastty base.
There did I leave him till the morrow day,
And how he escaped their hands I cannot say.
This piece of officer, this nasty patch,
(Whose understanding sleeps out many a watch)
Ran like a town bull, roaring up and down,
Saying that we had meant to fire the town;
And thus the devil his master did devise,
To bolster out his late abuse with lies;
So all the street down as I past along,
The people all about me in a throng,
Calling me villain, traitor, rogue, and theife,
Saying that I to fire their town was chief.
I bore the wrongs as patient as I might,
Vowing my pen should ease me when I write;
Like to a grumbling cur, that sleeps on hay,
Eats none himself, drives other beasts away,
So this base fellow would not once express,
Unto his Prince, a subjects ioyfulnesse,
But cause we did attempt it (as you see)
H'imprison'd Thompson, and thus slandered me.
Thus having eased my much incensed muse,
I crave the reader this one fault excuse,
For having urged his patience all this time,
With such a scuruy subject, and worse rhyme;
And thou Graues-endian officer take this,
And thank thy self, for all that written is,
It Is not against the town this tale I tell,
(For sure there does some honest people dwell,)
(...)he first let(...)ers of his (...)ames are R. L (...)nd his full (...)ame
being (...)nnagrama(...)'d is A Tro(...)eler, a trobe(...)er he was to (...)e,
and so I (...)ear he has (...)ene to my Reader.
But against thee, thou fiend in shape of man,
By whom this beastly outrage first began,
Which I could do no less, but let thee know,
And pay thee truly what I long did owe,
And now all is even betwixt thou and I,
Then farrewell and be hanged, that is twice God buy.
Sunday the 26 of August we set sail from Graues-end, and with various winds,
some large and some scarce, we happily past the seas, and sailed up the river
of Maze, by the Brill, and on the wednesday following I arrived at Roterdam in
Holland, at which time the worthy regiment of the right honorable Colonel Sir
Horace Veare, and the two noble Earls, of Essex, and Oxford departed from
thence in Martial Equipage toward the Pallatinate Country, whose Heroic and
Magnanimous endeavors, I beseech the Lord of hosts, and God of battles to
direct and bless.

The same day, I went to the Hage, and from thence to Leyden, where I lodged
all night, and the morrow being thurseday the 30 of August, I sailed from
Leyden, to Amsterdam, where I saw many things worthy the noting, but because
they are so near and frequent to many of our Nation, I omit to relate them, to
avoid teadiousnes: but on the friday at night I got passage from thence toward
Hambrogh, in a small hoy, in the which we were weather-beaten at sea three
days and nights before we arrived there.

Saturday the eight of September I left Hambrogh, and being carried day and
night in wagons, on the monday night following I came to an ancient town
called Heldesheim, it stands in Brunswick land, and yet it belongs to the
Bishop of Collin, where I did observe in their Doom Kirk, or Cathedral
Church, a crown of silver 80 foot in compass, hanged up in the body of the
Church, in the circuit of which crown were placed 160 wax candles, the which
on festival days, or at the celebration of some high ceremonies are lighted
to lighten their darkness, or their ignorance, choose ye whether.

Moreover there I saw a silver bell in their steeple, of six hundred and 30 l.
weight, and the Leads of their steeple, shining and sparkling with the Sun
beams, they did affirm to me to be gold, the truth of which I am doubtful
of.

In this town I stayed four days, and on friday the 14 of September, I went
six dutch miles to the strong town of Brunswick, where by reason of my short
stay, which was but two hours, I observed nothing worthy of memory, but their
triple walls, and double ditches, their artillery and fortifications, which
they think to be impregnable; besides, there I saw an old house of the Duke of
Brunswicke, with the statue of a golden lion, of a great bigness, standing
aloft upon a pillar, with the broken walls, and houses, which the Dukes Cannon
has left there six years since, as tokens and badges of his fury, and their
rebellion.

From thence on the morrow I went one dutch mile further, to an ancient town
called Wolfunbuttle, where the Duke of Brunswick keeps his Court, in the which
I and my fellow could get no further admittance, then over a bridge into his
outtermost, or base court; for his soldiers, seeing us with swords and
pistolls, were fearful, belike, that we would have taken the fortress from
them, and therefore though we were but two Englishmen, yet they durst not let
us enter; which made men call to remembrance the frequent, and daily Egresse
and Regresse, that all people and nations have to his Majesty royal Court of
great Britain, where none that are of any good fashion or aspect are debarred
entrance: when those inferior Princes houses are guarded with hungry
Halberdiers, and reverend rufty bil-men, with a brace or two of hot shots, so
that their palaces are more like prisons, then the free and noble courts of
commanding potentates.

After two days entertainment at Wolfunbuttle, with an English Merchant
residing there, of good fame and credit, named Master Thomas Sackuille, I wish
my brother, my fellow Tilbery, and another man in my company departed from
thence on foot, onward on our iourny toward Bohemia, in which travel, what
occurrences happened, and what things of note I saw, were as follows.

Passing with many weary steps, through the towns of Rosondink, Remling,
Soolem, Hessen Darsam, and Haluerstade, (which is all in Brunswick land,) But
this town of Haluerstade belongs to a Bishop so styled, who is Duke Christian
brother to the now Duke of Brunswick, a long dutch mile (or almost six English)
is a small town or a Bleck called Groaning belonging to the Duke, in the which
place I observed two things worthy of remembrance.

First a most stately Palace built with a beautiful Chapel, so adorned with
the images and forms of Angels, and Cherubins, with such exquisitenes of arts
best industry of caruing, grauing, guilding, painting, glasing, and pauing,
with such superexcellent workmanship of organes, pulpit and font, that for
curiosity and admirable rareness, all the buildings, and fabrics that ever I
beheld, must give it pre-eminence. I confess that Henry the seuenths Chapel
at Westminster, Kings College Chapel in Cambridge, and Christ's Church in
Canterbury, are beyond it in height and workmanship of stone: for indeed this
Chapel is most of wood gipps, and plaster of Parris; but it is so gilded as
if it had bin made in the golden age, when gold was esteemed as dross, so that
a man had need to wear a veil over his dazeling eyes, or else he can hardly
look upon it.

The caruing and painting seem to outgo the arts of Pigmalion, Apelles, or
Praxiteles; the pauing of chequered black and white marble, and the windows
glassed with Crystal: but all this great cost and show is very little to the
honor of God, or the propagation of the Ghospel, the edification of the
ignorant. For in this Chapel of ease, there is no Service. If the painted
pulpit could preach, the dumb images might (perhaps) have a sermon now and
then; for scarce at any time there comes any body into the Chapel, but a
fellow that shows the beauty of it for two pence or three pence a piece.

In the same house, in a place or celler built of purpose, is a great tonne or
vessel of wood, that was 7 years in making, and has used to be filled with
Rhenish wine: it is said to be twice as big as the vessel at Heidelberg,
and the hoopes of it are twelve inches thick, and the staves or bordes of it
being as much: I went up to the top of it, with a ladder of 18 stepps, he that
keeps it says it will hold 160 tonnes. My fellow Tilbery did creep in at the
tap hole; it is in length 32 foot, and in breadth acrosse 19, and verily I
think that babble cost more money the making, then would have built a good ship,
or founded an alms house for 6 poor people.

This is a Tub of Tubs, Tub of Tubs Hall,
Who n'ere had fellow yet, nor ever shall;
O had Diogenes but had this a Ton,
He would had thought that he more room had won,
Then Alexanders conquests, or the bounds
Of the vast Occean, and the solid grounds.
Or had Cornelius but this tub, to drench
His clients that had practiced too much French,
A thousand hogsheads then would haunt his firkin,
And Mistress Minks recover her lost mirkin.
This mighty cask great Bacchus used too stride,
When he to drunkards hall did often ride;
And in this barrel he did keep his court,
Bathing himself in Rhenish for disport.
But now these 8 years it has dry bin kept;
In it the wine-god has nor pist or wept;
That now the Cappell, and the cask combine,
One has no preaching, the other has no wine.
And now the use they put it to is this,
It Is showed for money, as the Chapel is.
From Groaning we traveled to a town called Ashers Leaven, to Ashleauen, to
Kinderne, to Hall, and so to Leipzig, which is one of the chiefest towns in
Saxony, being famous for a yearly Mart that is yearly held there, whereto
Merchants and other people from the most part of Christendom have annual
concourse: in this town we stayed two days, and taking our leave then of some
English Merchants, who used us kindly, we there would have hired a coach or
wagon to Prague; but all the Saxon coach-men and carters were afraid to look
upon any part of Bohemia, because their Duke is a professed enemy in arms
against the King of Beam, so that we were forced to hire a fellow with a
wheelebarrow two days to carry our cloakes, swords, guns, pistolls, and other
apparel and luggage which were our necessaries, to a town called Boorne, to
Froburge, and so to another town called Penigh, where we cashierd our
one-wheel'd coach, and hired a cart with two, which carried both us and our
baggage to Chemnizt another town in Saxony, from whence to a place called
Shop, we were feign to be our own sumpter horses, walking on foot to the
last town in Saxony, called Marienberg. From thence passing up and down
inaccessable mountains, we came to a wood, which parts Bohemia from Saxony on
the west, which wood is called by the people of those parts the Beamer Wolts or
Wolt, and is in breadth to English miles, and in length further then I know how
to describe truly: but this much of it I dare affirm, that it is a natural
impregnable wall to the kingdom of Bohem, which kingdom is all incompast
round with woods and mountains, so that there is no passage on that side of
it, for any army to enter into it with munition and artillery, all the ways
being uneven, and the mountain tops all boggs, mosses, and quagmires, that
great ordnance or any heavy carriage either of horse, cart or wagon, will sink
and be lost. Besides, there are numbers past numbering of Fur trees, many
standing, and such store fallen of themselves, that any passage might easily be
stopped by laying them cross the way. And of all my iourny, the travel
through that dismal wood was the most heavy unto me, for the trees grew so
thick, and so high, that the sun was obscured, and the day seemed night; in
some places, the way paued with swimming trees 2 miles together on the tops of
hills, which now and then I slipping besides, sunk to the middle in a quagmire.

When we had thus footed it, and traveled past the hills and woods, (being at
the least 4 hours toil) and that we might look down the mountains into
the fruitful land of Bohem, never did sight more rejoice us, the lower hills
being all full of Vineyards, and the valleys, corn and pasture; not an English
mile distance, but a village every way; and twenty, thirty, or forty reekes or
stacks of corn which their barnes cannot hold, in the space of every hours
iourny: in a word, every thing that belonged to the use and commodity of man
was and is there, and all the delightful objects to satisfy every sense is
there abundantly, so that nature seemed to make that Country her storehouse or
granary, for there is nothing wanting except men's gratitude to God for such
blessings.

The first night we lodged there at a pretty town called Comoda, which town
by negligence and occasion of fire had fifty houses burnt two days before our
coming thither, it being eleven dutch miles from Prague. There we hired a
wagon 7 dutch miles to a town called Slowne, from whence we walked on foot a
long 16 English miles to Prague, which long looked for the City we could not
see until we came within an hours travel of it: within half a dutch mile is
a fearful place, being frequented with inhumaine and barbarous murderers,
that assault travelers, first shooting and murdring them, and after searching
their pockets, where if they have money or not, all is one, it is but so many
slain: for these villains have a wood, and a deep valley to shelter
themselves in, that they are hardly taken afterward; but if they chance at any
time to be but apprehended, they are racked and tortured to make them confess,
and afterward their executions are very terrible. But (I thank God) we past
that place, and many other as dangerous as that, where some were robbed and
murdered (as report told us) both before us, behind us, and on each side: and
we saw in our iourny above seven score gallowses and wheels, where thieues
were hanged some fresh, and some half rotten, and the carkases of murderers,
broken limb after limb on the wheels; and yet it was our happiness only to see
the dead villains, and escape the living.

I came into Prague on thurseday the seventh of September, whither if I had
come but the friday before, I had seen a most fearful execution of two
notorious offenders; the manner how, with their faults, as it was truly
related to me by English Gentlemen that saw it, I think it not much
impertinent to relate.

The one of them being taken, apprehended and racked, for ripping up alive a
woman with child, and for taking the infant out of her body, did sow a living
puppy into her belly; all which he confessed he did to make properties for
wichcraft: and being further tortured, he confessed when and where he had
committed 35. murders more: the other in respect of him was but a petty
offender, for he in all his life time had murdered but 14. For the which
execrable facts, their deserved executions were as follows: First, they were
brought out of the Iayle naked from the girdle upward; and so being bound fast
on high in a cart, that the spectators might see them; then the Hangman having
a pan of coals near him, with red hot pincers nip'd off the nipple of one
breast; then he took a knife and gives him a slash or cut down the back on
one side, from the shoulder to the waste; and presently gave him such another
slash, three inches from the first; then on the top he cut the slashes into
one;, and presently taking pincers, took hold of the cross cut, and tore him
down like a Girse below the middle, letting it hang down behind him like a
belt: after which he took his burning pincers, and plucked off the tops of his
fingers of one hand: then passing to another place of the Town, his other
nipple was plucked off, the other side of his back so cut and mangled, (which
they call by the name of rimming, (if it had been riming, I would never have
written but in prose) his other fingers nip'd off; then passing further, all
his toes were nip'd off with the burning pincers: after which he was enforced
to come out of the cart, and go on foot up a steep hill to the Gallows,
where he was broken with a wheel, alive, one bone after another, beginning at
his legs and ending with his neck, and last of all quartered and laid on the
wheel, on a high post, till Crows, Ravens, or consuming time consume him.

This was the manner of both their executions, but I speak but of the greatest
murderer particularly, because it is reported, that all these torments never
made him once to change countenance, or to make any sign or action of grief,
to call to God for mercy, or to entreat the people to pray for him; but as if
he had been a senseless stock or stone, he did most scornefully, and as it
were in disdain abide it: whilst the other villain did cry, rore, and make
lamentation, calling upon God often; the difference was not much in their
lives, and manner of their deaths, but I am persuaded the odds was great in
their dying.

The City of Prague is almost circular or round, being divided in the middle by
the river of Moldoue, over which is a fair stone Bridge, of 600. paces over,
and at each end a strong gate of stone: there is said to be in it of Churches
and Chapels, 150. for there are great numbers of Catholics, who have many
Chapels dedicated to sundry Saints, and I was there at four several sorts of
divine exercises; viz. at good sermons with the Protestants, at Mass with the
Papists, at a Lutherans preaching, and at the Jews Synagog; three of which I
saw and heard for curiosity, and the other for edification.

The Jews in Prague are in such great numbers, that they are thought to be of
men, women and children, betwixt 50. or 60000. who do all live by brocage and
usury upon the Christians, and are very rich in money and Jewels, so that a man
may see ten or twelve together of them, that are accounted worth 20. 30. or
40000. l. apiece; and yet the slaves go so miserably attired, that 15. of them
are not worth the hanging for their whole wardrobes.

The Castle where the King and Queen do keep their Court, is magnificent and
sumptuous in building, strongly situated and fortified by nature and art, being
founded on a high hill, so that at pleasure it keeps the town in command, and
it is much more spacious in rooms for receipt in gardens and orchards, then
the Tower of London. I was in it daily the space of 20 days, and saw it
royally graced with the presence of a gracious King and Queen, who were
honorably atte^ded by a gallant courtly train of Lords and Ladies, and
Gentles, of the high Dutch and Bohemians, and where was free and bountiful
entertainment to strangers in abundance: I must ever humbly and thankfully
acknowledge the Queens Majesty's goodness toward me, whose undeserved
favors were helpful unto me both there, and in my tedious iorny home-ward.
Moreover there I saw (and had in mine arms) the King and Queens youngest son,
Prince Robert, who was borne there on the 16 of December last: a goodly child
as ever I saw of that age, whom with the rest I pray God to bless; to his
glory and his Parents joy and comfort.

There (for a token) I did think it meet,
To take the shoes from off this Prince his feet:
I do not say I stole, but I did take,
And whilst I live I Will keep them for his sake:
Long may his Grace live to be stylde a man,
And then I Will steal his boots too, if I can.
The shoes were upright shoes, and so was he
That wore them, from all harm upright and free:
He used them for their use, and not for pride,
He never wronged them, or never trod a side.
Lambskin they were, as white as Innocence,
(True patterns for the footsteps of a Prince,)
And time will come (as I do hope in God)
He that in childhood with these shoes was shod,
Shall with his manly feet once trample down,
All Antichristian foes to his renown.
The city of Prague, has in it (by reason of the wars) thrice the number of
it is own inhabitants, and yet for all that, victuals is in such great plenty,
that 6 men cannot eat three half penny worth of bread, and I did buy in the
market a fat goose well roast for the vallew of nine pence English, and I and
my brother have dined there at a Cooks with good roasted meat, bread and
beer, so that we have bin satisfied and left, for the vallew of five pence: a
good turkey there may be bought for two shillings, and for fresh fish I never
saw such store, for in one market day I have known in Prague 2000 carps,
besides other fishes, which carps in London are five shillings a piece, and
there they were for eight pence, or ten pence at the most, so that one of their
fresh fish markets here were worth at the least 5 or 600 pounds, and as for
all other manner of wild foul, they are there in satiety, besides their
fruits are in such abundance that I boght a basket of grapes of the quantity
of half a pecke for a penny and farthing, and a hat-ful of fair peaches for
as much, pickled cowcumbers I have bought a pecke for three pence, and
muskmellons, there has bin cast five or six carts load of them in one day to
their hoggs.

As concerning the diet that is in the Kings armies, I could never yet hear
any man complain of want, but that it is more plentiful then in the city,
the greatest scarcity has bin to some sick soldiers, who being not able to
march with the leaguers (by reason of their weakness) they have bin left
amongst the Boores, or husbandmen in the next villages, where their languages
not understood, their succor has bin but small, but for all this in the camp
has ever bin a continual cheapnes of all things, the King most duly paying
his soldiers at the end of every month, having in his great leguer, under the
conduct of the Princes of Hollock and Anhalt, of foot and horse 43000, and at
the least of carts and wagons to carry provision, and baggage for the army, to
the number of 18000. In his little leaguer under the leading of Count Mansfelt
there are of foot and horse 7000, besides carrs and wagons for carriage, and
yet for these great numbers of men and beasts, there is food in all abundance.

In the camp with Grave Mansfelt is the Brittane regiment under their Colonel
Sir Andrew Gray Knight, and in Prague I met with many worthy Gentlemen and
soldiers, which were there sick, as the worthy Captain Bushel, Lieutenaut
Grimes, Lieuetenant Langworth, Ancient Galbreath, Ancient Vandenbrooke, Master
Whitney, Master Blundell and others, all which did most courteously entertain
me, unto whom I must ever rest thankful, and they do affirm that now it has
pleased God to grant their soldiers recovery, that they do hope every
Britain soldier does retain more good spirit, then 3 enemies of what nation
soever.

Thus having showed part of the best things in Bohemia, the Court and City of
Prague, it shall not be amiss if I relate a little merrily, of some things
there tolerable, some intolerable, some naught and some worse then naught; for
as every rose has a prickle, and every Be a sting, so no earthly kingdom
has such persection of goodness, but it may be justly taxed with
imperfections.

Prague is a famous, ancient, kingly seat,
In situation and in state complete,
Rich in abundance of the earths best treasure,
Proud and high minded, beyond bounds or measure,
In Architecture stately; in Atire,
Bezonians and Pleibeians do aspire,
To be apparelled with the stately port
Of worship, honor, or the royal court;
There coaches, and carroches are so rife,
They do attend on every trades man's wife,
Whose husbands are but in a mean regard,
And get their living by the ell or yard,
How ever their estates may be defended,
Their wives like demi ladies are attended:
I there a Chimney sweepers wife have seen,
Habillimented like the diamond Queen,
Most gaudy garish, as a fine maid marrian,
With breath as sweet as any sugar carrion,
With satin cloak, lined through with budg, or sable,
Or cunny furre (or what her purse is able)
With velvet hood, with tiffanies, and purles,
Rebatoes frizlings, and with powdered curles,
And (lest her hue or sent should be attainted,
She Is antidoted, well persum'd and painted,
She Is fur'd, she is fringed, she is laced and at her wast,
She Is with a massy chain of silver braced,
She Is yellow starched, she is ruff'd, and cuff'd, and muff'd,
She Is ring'd, she is braceleted, she is richly tuff'd,
Her petticoale, good silk as can be bought,
Her smock, about the tail laced round and wrought,
Her gadding legs are finely spanish booted,
The whilst her husband, like a slave all sooted,
Looks like a courtier to infernal Pluto,
And knows himself to be a base cornuto.
Then since a man that lives by chimny sweep,
His wife so gaudy richly clad does keep,
Think then but how a Merchants wife may go,
Or how a burgamaisters wife does show;
There (by a kind of top sie turuy use,)
The women wear the boots, the men the shoes,
I know not if it be profit, or else pride,
But sure they are oft'ner riden then they ride:
These females seem to be most valiant there,
Their painting shows they do no colors fear,
Most art-like plastring natures imperfections,
With sublimated, white and red complexions;
So much for pride I have observed there,
Their other faults are almost every where.
Thus having stayed in Prague almost 3. weeks, I returned from thence homeward,
on tuesday, the 26. of September, having in my company three Gentlemen, a
widow (and four small children) whose husband and being an English man, and
the Kings Brewer for Beer, deceased, and was buried there in Prague whilst I
was there: the good desolate woman having received reward after seven years
service there and at Heidelberg, being desirous to retire to her country
(England) came with us, with my brother, and my fellow Tilbery. We took two
Coaches at the Castle of Prague, and in a day and half, we were carried seven
Duch miles, to a Town in Bohemia (standing on the river of Elue) called
Leutmeritz, at which Town we all laid our moneys together, and bought a boat
of 48. foot in length, and not 3. foot in breadth, and because we did not know
the river, we hired a Bohemian waterman to guide us 15. dutch miles, to the
Town of Dreason in Saxony. But 4. miles short of that Town, which was the
first Town in the Saxon Country, called Pirne, where we were stayed 5. hours
without the gates, til such time as the Burgamaster would be pleased to examine
us: in the mean space our waterman (not daring to abide the terrible trial of
examination, because the Duke of Saxon was in Arms against the King of Beam)
he ran away, and left us to bring the boat down the river, 600. English
miles our selves to Hamburgh.

But now to close up all, I will relate what rare diet, excellent cookery, and
sweet lodging we had in ouriourney in Germany: first for our comfort, after
very hard getting of houseroome, our lodgings was every night in straw, where
lying together well littered, we honestly always left our sheets behind us:
then at our suppers at a table square, and so broad, that two men can hardly
shake hands over it, we being some twelve about it. Our first dish being a raw
cabbadge, of the quantity of half a pecke, cut and chopped small, with the fat
of resty bacon powered upon it in stead of oil; which dish must be emptied
before we could get any more: Our second dish perhaps, a peck of boylde Apples
and honey, the Apples being boiled skins, stalks, cores, and all: Thirdly,
100. Gudgeons, newly taken perhaps, yet as salt as if they had been three
years pickled, or twice at the East Indies, boiled with scales, guts an all,
and buried in Ginger like sawdust: a fresh pike as salt as brine, boiled in
flat milk, with a pound of Garlic. This was the manner of the most part of
our diet; and if we did ask them why they did salt their meat so
unreasonably, their answer was, that their beer could not be consumed, except
their meat were salted extraordinarily.

If a man do find fault or seem distasted with their beastly diet, he is in
danger to be thrust out of doors, and take up his lodging in the streets: and
in the conclusion when dinner or supper is ended, then comes mine Host, or his
leather lip'd Froe, with a saucy reckoning of what they please, which sounds in
our ears like a harsh Epilogue, after a bad play; for what they say we must
pay, their words are irreuocable (like the ancient Kings of Persia) and we must
not question or ask how and how it can be so much, but pay them their demand
without grumbling to half a farthing.

Which made me call to mind six several principals, that do belong to a
traveler, as patience, silence, wariness, watchfulness, a good stomach, and
a purse well moneyed; for if he want any one of these, (perhaps) the other five
will never bring him to his iournies end. A man's patience must be such, that
(though he be a Barron) he must bear all abuses, either in words, lodging,
diet, or almost any thing, though offered from or by a sowter, a tinker, or a
Merchant of tripes and turnips; his silence must be, that though he hear and
understand himself wronged, yet he must be as dumb as a Gudgeon or a Whiting
mop: and though his mouth be shut, his wariness must be such, that his ears
must be ever open, to listen and ouer-heare all dangers that may be complotted
against him: his watchfulness must be so, that he must seldom sleep with both
his eyes at once, lest his throat be cut before he wake again. But for his
stomach, he must eat grass with a horse, and draffe with the hogs, for
he that cannot eat pickled herring broth, and dirty puddings, shall many
times fast by authority, and go to bed withont his supper: and last of all, he
must have Fortunatus or a Prince his purse, that must be (like a drunkards
dagger) ever drawn, to pay bountifully for such wash and grains, as his
valiant stomach hrth overcome, conquered and devoured: but of this a little in
verse:

Six things unto a Traveler belongs,
An Asses back, to abide and bear all wrongs:
A fishes tougue (mute) grudging speech forbearing,
A Hearts quick ear, all dangers, ouerhearing.
A dogs eyes, that must wake as they do sleep,
And by such watch his corpse from peril keep.
A swines sweet homely taste, that must digest
Al Fish, Flesh, Roots, Foul, foul and beastly dressed;
And last, he must have ever at his call
A purse well lynde with coin to pay for all.
With this kind of lodging and diet, and with tedious labor sometimes night
and day, we came in 14. days 607. miles from Prague in Bohemia, to Hambrogh
on the hither skirts of Germany, the river having above 1000. shelues and
sands, and 800. Islands, so that a man cannot see on which side of them to go,
there being 240. mills chained in boats on the first stream, and a number
numberless of Oaks and other trees sunk with the violence of the River, and
sometimes fogs and mists that we could not see a boats length from us: besides
great Rocks, and stones that were fallen into the water, that any or many of
these impediments do often overthrow boats, and drown passengers; yet I, and
my fellow Tilbery (we being both his Majesty's watermen) did by Gods
assistance safely escape them all, and brought our selves, as is afore-sayd, to
Hamborogh, where being wind bound 10. days, I thank the English Merchants, I
was well welcomed, until at last it pleased God, the wind came fair, I took
ship, and after 9. days and nights of various weather (I give praise to the
Almighty) I safely came home to my house in London, on saturday the 28. of
September. 1620.

You that have bought this, grieve not at the cost,
There Is something worth your noting, all is not lost,
First half a Constable is well bumbasted,
If there were nothing else, your coins not wasted,
Then I relate of hills, and dales, and downs,
Of Churches, Chapels, Palaces and Towns,
And then to make amends (although but small)
I tell a tale of a great Tub withal,
With many a gallowse, Iibbit, and a wheel,
Where murdrers bones are broke, from head to heel;
How rich Bohemia is in wealth and food,
Of all things which for man or beast is good.
How in the Court at Prague (a princely place)
A gracious Queen vouchsafed me to grace,
How on the sixteenth day of August last,
King Frederick to his royal army past,
How fifty thousand were in arms araid,
Of the Kings force, be side the Hungarian aid,
And how Bohemia strongly can oppose,
And cuffe and curry all their daring foes.
Then though no news of state, may here be had,
I know here is something will make good men glad,
No bringer of strange tales I mean to be,
Nor i will believe none that are told to me.
FINIS.
