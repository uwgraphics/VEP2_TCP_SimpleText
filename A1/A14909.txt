TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, JAMES EARL OF Carlisle, Viscount Doncaster, Baron of
Saley, one of his Majesty's Privy Counsel, Gentleman of his Bedchamber, and
Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
WHen the Israelites were traveling through the wilderness to Canaan, the
Lord gave them three guides, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam; of those three guides
Miriam was the meanest; she was a woman, Mica. 6.4.
the infirmer sex, and she murmured first against Moses, therefore she was
stricken with leprosy: Aaron was their second guide, but in somethings he
proved a blind guide to them, for he set up a golden calfe before them: Moses
was their third guide, but he could not bring them to Canaan, it was Joshua
who brought them to their rest. So there are three guides which direct men in
this world; first corrupt nature, or natura non suscitata, that is, nature not
wakened or stirred up by learning; this guide is but like unto Miriam, and
oftentimes it murmureth against Moses, the law of God. The second guide is
ratio suscitata, reason wakned and stirred up, and somewhat refined by learning
and human sciences; yet it is but a blind guide, and oftentimes it
murmureth, and repineth against Moses as well as leprous Miriam. The third
guide which directs men here; is the law of God, which shows us the way to
Canaan and our eternal rest. Moses guided the Jews three manner of ways;
first by the ceremonies; secondly by the Judicial; and thirdly by the Moral
precepts. The ceremonies did dilineate to them Christ to come, and as a painter
when he is about to paint a man, first he draws some lines and draughts,
and this is called (...); Secondly he adds the black colors, and this is
called (...); and lastly the vive colors, and this is called (...); then we
discern plainly whom he did delineate before: we take up at the first that
he is painting a man, but we cannot discern in particular who it is: The
first lineaments (as it were) of Christ were drawn to the Patriarchs; then
Moses added the black colors in the ceremonies; but when Christ came in the
flesh, then he was seen in his vive colors: and as the fathers say, to the
Patriarchs he was in spicis, to the Jews in farina, sed nobis in pane; that
is, the Patriarchs saw him as it were, but in the ear of the corn, the Jews
saw him in the meal, but we see him in the bread set upon the table before us.
The second way how Moses directed them, was by his judicial laws, guiding
them in their policy and commonwealth, where for hardness of their hearts,
he permitted many things to them; but their chief and principal guide was
the Moral law, which is that guide of guides. David when he breaks out in
commendation of this law, he spends the whole 119 psalm in praise of it,
and there is not one verse in it except the 122 which has not some epithet of
the law of God in it, as his judgments, his words, his laws, his testimonies,
his commandments, his covenant, his statutes, and his precepts etc. It may be
said, perhaps, that this law seems not to be such a guide, seeing it is called
a killing letter, and the ministration of death: but this is only accidental
to it that it is so called, 2. Cor. 3.6.7.
when it meets with the perverse and corrupt nature of unregenerate man, then
it is the ministration of death and a killing letter; but when it meeeteth with
a regenerate man, then it becomes a guide unto him; therefore the fathers say
well, Datur duris in flagellum, proficientibus in paedagogiam, and
perfectioribus in solatium; the law is a whip and a scourge to the stubborn
and disobedient, it is a tutor to those who begin to learn new obedience, but
it becomes a comforter and a counselor to those who have made any progress
in holiness, Psalm. 18.26.
and as God himself with the pure he will show himself pure; and with the
froward he will show himself froward, so does this law show it self a hard
and a rigorous Taskmaster to the wicked. This law being such a perfect guide,
and so necessary in the Church, what monsters are these Antinomians who set
themselves against the law, and will banish it out of the Church, whereas
Christ came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it Christ and Moses were in
the mountain together: Matt. 5.17. Matt. 17.3.
so the Church sang the song of Moses, and the song of the lamb, Revel. 15.3.
the Law and the Gospel must not be separated. Those who would remove and
banish the law out of the Church do as thieves do when they come to rob and
steal; the first thing that that they do in the house, they put out the light
that they may steal the more securely: So carnal and profane men, that they
may sin the more securely and with greater liberty, do labor to abolish the
law out of the Church; but the Lord never lighted his candle, that it should be
put under a bushel. The Lord has set men in three ranks in the world: some in
the meanest and basest condition of life, some in a middle condition of life,
and some in a higher condition: this law is necessary for all sorts and
conditions of men: for to those who live in the lowest and basest condition it
is necessary to uphold them, they have not been unfitly compared to a fishers
net, which has lead to make it sink, and cork to make it swim; so poverty
and crosses hold the poor man down and make him to sink, then the comfortable
promises of the law of God make him to swim and hold up his head: so this law
is necessary for those who are in a middle state, it is like the tongue of the
balance to those to make the scales stand right, but it is most of all
necessary to those who stand in high places, for high places, as David says,
are slippery places. In Israel when a man built a new house he was commanded to
make a battlement about it, Deuteronomy. 22.8.
lest men should fall over and endanger themselves; so when men are in eminent
places, the best battlement to save them is the law of God. I know, my
Honorable, and very good Lord, when ye remember Gods goodness toward you who
has advanced you to such an high place, and continued you in such favor with
your Prince so long, that ye will be thankful to your God, and that ye will
not forget to make this law your philactery, Prove. 3.3.
and put it like a chain about your neck. The reasons, my Honorable Lord, that
have moved me to seek your Lordships patrocinie to this work, are first,
because I know ye love the truth. Secondly, because ye have so faithfully and
honorably carried your self often in those weighty employments which his
Majesty and the State have committed to you. And thirdly, because you carry
your self so respectively to all sorts of men at home: these motives
encouraged me to take the boldness to present this treatise to your Lordship.
And although I be not able to bring a lamb, the sacrifice of the richer sort,
yet if I bring but two turtle doves, Levit. 5.7.
I know your Lordship will accept of it, because a man is debtor for that which
he has, 2. Cor. 8.12.
and not for that which he has not. The grace of God be with your Lordship,
and preserve you blameless in soul and body until the coming of the Lord in
glory.

Your Honors in all dutiful submission JOHN WEEMES.

AN EXPLICATION OF THE MORAL LAW. The first Book, containing sundry
Questions for the understanding of the first Table of the Moral Law.
EXERCITAT. I. Of the excellency of the Moral Law, above other Laws.
Iam. 2.8. If ye fulfill the royal Law yet do well.
THe Moral Law has not been unfitly compared to the Eclipticke line; for as
the Sun keeps still his course in the Eclipticke line; and other planets,
Simile,
some of them are now in this side of the line, and now in that side of the
line; and when they come within the Eclipticke line, then they come nearer to
the Sun. So man, when he walks in holiness and righteousness, then he
is within his Eclipticke line; but when he walks in sin and
unrighteousness, then he is without his line. Job. 23.17. His ways have I
kept and have not declined from them.

A comparison betwixt the Law Moral and Judicial.
To show the excellency of the Moral Law, above all other Laws; let us
compare, first, Gods Moral Law, with his judicial Law which he gave also
himself. Gods moral Law exceeds his judicial Law in this, that his
judicial Law obliged the Jews, and that only in Judea. The Judicial law did
bind the Jews only in Judea.
As other positive Laws bind, not men out of their own Country; so the
judicial Law of Moses, obliged not the Jews; but only in Judea. Example, no
Levite might have a possession in Judea particularly by himself; yet their Law
did not bind the Jews out of Judea; The Moral Law binds all persons in all
places.
for a Levite of Cyprus sold his possession, and laid the money down at the
Apostles feet. Act. 4.36. but Gods moral Law binds all persons, in all
places an therefore it is called the royal Law, or the Kings Law, James, 2.8.
For that which the King commands to be common, is common to all; as the Kings
high way, Number. 21.2. So the Kings weight. 2. Sam. 14.26. He weighed the hair
of his head at two hundred sicles after the Kings weight; That is, the weight
wherewith all men weighed. So the Kings Law, that is, the Law which all are
bound to walk in. Contrary to this, is pervertere vias domini, to pervert the
ways of the Lord. Act. 10.13. It was a great blindness then of those, who
said Act. 16.21. that Paul and Silas taught customs which were not lawful for
them to receive, neither to observe being Romans. But Gods moral Law binds
all people a like.

The Moral law binds the inner man, but the Judicial Law binds him not.
Secondly, the moral Law binds the inner man, but the judicial Law of Moses
obliged not the inner man. Example, Tooth for tooth, and eye for eye, Deuteronomy.
16.21. When one had paid tooth for tooth, or eye for eye, he had satisfied the
judicial Law; for that Law required no more of him. but the moral Law
required more of him, that he should be free of the rancour of his heart.

Thirdly, The judicial Law was fitted for them, as they were a people of a
hard heart; as the law of divorce, The Judicial Law for the estate of the
Jews.
of Jealousy, and of the revenger of the blood; which were Laws made according
to the hardness of the hearts of that people; and as the shoemaker makes a
shoe according to the crooked foot: so the Lord made these judicial Laws,
and fitted them to the estate of that people. Solon being asked, whether he had
given the best Laws to the Athenians or not? Answered: the best that they
could suffer. So the Lord fitted these Laws to the nature of that people: but
the moral Law of God, is not fitted that way to the estate of men; but all men
must fit themselves to it.

Fourthly, some of the Judicial Laws exempted some men, from performing some
duties; The Judicial Law exempted some men from some duties, but the moral
Law binds all alike.
as Deuteronomy. 24, 5. A mad should not go to the wars, nor be charged with any
business, the first year that he is married. But the moral Law prescribes
alike obedience to all, Joel. 2, 16. Let the bridegroom go forth of his
chamber and the bride out of her closet.

Secondly, let us compare Gods moral Law, A comparison betwixt the moral Law
and the ceremonial.
and his ceremonial Law together. Some of the ceremonial Laws obliged all
the Jews in all places: therefore Daniel in Babylon might not eat of any of
the unclean meats of the King of Babel, Dan. 1, 8. Some of the ceremonies
obliged but some of the Jews in all places; Ceremonies which had relati n to
the Temple, were not kept in the Wilderness, or in the captivity.
as no Nazaret might drink wine. And thirdly some of the ceremonies, obliged
all the Jews at sometimes; as no Jew might eat leaven at the Pascha. But the
moral Law obliged all people, at all times, and in all places. These
ceremonies which had relation to the Temple, they kept them neither in the
wilderness, nor in the captivity: as they paid nothing to the Priests who
served in the Temple. But the moral Law did bind them, both in the wilderness
and in the captivity; and therefore he who brake the Sabbath in the
wilderness, was stoned to death, Levit. 24.

Again, the ceremonial Law was accommodated and fitted to them, as they were
infants in the Church; and it was fitted to their capacity and nonage: but the
moral Law binds all estates and conditions of men alike.

The ceremonial Law show what was sin ex accidente indirectly, but the
moral per se and directly.
Thirdly, the ceremonial Law, made them understand sin, ex accidente; for it
was appointed in expiationem peccati, for the expiation of sin: as the
judicial Law was appointed in paenam peccati, for the punishment of sin. But
the moral Law showed them directly what was sin.

Fourthly, these ceremonial Laws are called, praecepta non bona, Ezekiel.
20.25. I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby
they shall not live.

Pracepta mala non bona bona.

There are three sorts of precepts. First mala, as the statutes of Omri. Micah.
6.16. Secondly, non bona, as the ceremonial Law. Thirdly bona, as the moral
Law. The Lord calls these ceremonial precepts, non bona: because they could
bring nothing to perfection, Heb. 10.1. And he that kept them could not live by
them; they were given but as hedges to keep in the people, The ceremonial
statutes were called, not good, because they brought nothing to perfection.
after they set up the Golden Calfe, that they should not commit Idolatry any
more: and they were but shadows to them, of good things to come, Heb. 10.1.
They commanded neither virtue nor vice in themselves; therefore he calls them
praecepta non bona. But the moral Precepts are just and holy, and the man that
does them, shall live in them, Gal. 3.12.

A comparison betwixt the moral Law, and the Laws of men.
Thirdly, let us compare Gods moral Law and the Laws of men, they say that
ratio legis est anima legis, the wisdom of God was anima huius legis, and as
far as the wisdom of God, differed from the wisdom of man; so far
differs the Law of God, from the civil Laws of men.

Secondly, the civil Law says, The moral Law of God forbids the motions
of the heart without consent, but the Law of man does not so.
de minutis non curat lex, that is, the Law looks not to every small
transgression. But Gods moral Law, observes and condemns, both the great
and the least sins; it forbids Gnats, as well as Camels, Mat. 23. The
Nazaret was forbidden as well to eat the kernel of the Raisin, as to eat the
husk, or drink the Wine. Number. 6.4. So the Lord forbids in his Law, as well
the first motions of the heart without consent, as he does the act it self;
but man's Law looks not to these: Simile.
and as the Sun when it shines brightly, shows us atoms, the very little
motes, which are the least things we can perceive: so the bright Law of God,
shows us these first motions of the heart to be sin, which the natural man
would think to be as small as the motes in the Sun.

Thirdly, the civil Law says, Cogitationis paenam in nostro for^ nemo luat;
but the moral Law first takes order with the cogitations of the heart, then
it comes to the countenance, Why is thy countenance fallen, Genesis 4.6. then to
the gnashing of teeth, Act. 7.54. (...), (...).
they gnashed with their teeth, as if they had been cutting with a Saw: then
to the foaming of the mouth; therefore the Hebrwes mark, that Ceseph
signifies both foaming at the mouth, and anger, Esth. 1.18. (...) ira spuma.

These the Greeks call (...), Who are angry till they foame at the mouth
again. So the moral Law takes order with the angry words as to call our
brother Raca or fool: then see how the moral Law pursues the act it self;
as first, the Pharisees revenge, tooth for tooth and eye for eye: then Cains
revenge, seven for one. Then Lamanes revenge, seventy for one, Genesis 24. Then
Hamans revenge, The moral Law forbids all sort of unlawful revenge, or to
remember an injury.
to have all the Jews killed; and as the moral Law takes order with the fact
it self: so with the dregs after the injury is pardoned. Thou shall not
avenge nor remember Levit. 19, 18. A man is stricken with a dagger, when he
throws away the dagger then he pardons the revenge; but yet if he keep
still the sheath, the dregge remains; and he remembereth the wrong done to
him.

The Civil Law does not respect virtues in themselves, but as they concern
the Commonwealth.
Fourthly, the civil Law, Whatsoever it commands concerning virtues, it
commands it only in respect of humane society, and as they are acts of
justice; so that if it prescribe any thing of moral virtues, as of temperance
and sobriety; it respects them no other ways, Arist. lib. 5. Ethic. cap. 1
but as they are good for the commonwealth; but not as they are directly
virtues in themselves. Example, When it comandeth temperance, it commands it
not as a virtue necessary for this or that particular man, but because this
intemperance does hurt the commonwealth. So when it forbids Adultery, it
forbids not, as a sin hurtful to the man, who commits it; but as a
sin contrary to an act of justice: but the Law of God commands these
virtues, as virtues directly; both intellectunall and moral.

Fifthly, man's Law permits many things, which the Law of God altogether
disaloweth; man's Law permitted the Husband, if he took his wife in the act of
Adultery to kill her; as the Athenians made a Law of it; and Draco and Solon
approved it. The Law of the twelve tables says Moechum in adulteri^
deprehensum necato: Plutarchus in vita solomis, and lex 12 tabul.
but this Law was moderated lege Iulia, it was only permitted for the husband
to kill the Adulterer, if he had been a vile and a base fellow; and
afterward, it was permitted to the Father only, to kill his Daughter if she
were taken in adultery; but not to her Husband: yet these were never allowed by
the Law of God, and although before men those were not punished, yet they were
guilty before the Lord.

Fourthly, A comparison betwixt the moral Law, and Law of a man's conscience.
let us compare the moral Law with the Law of man's conscience, and we shall
see how perfect the moral Law is. We are obliged to follow our conscience if
it be rightly informed, because it is the Deputy of the Lord: if it be an
erroneous conscience, we are bound to do nothing against it; because it is the
Lords Deputy we should thus far respect it, although we follow it not. A
Tyrant because he is Gods Deputy, his subjects may not rise against him; yet
they must not obey his unlawful Commandments: but we are still bound to
follow the Law of God.

Lastly, A comparison betwixt the Law of God and the Law of sin.
let us compare the moral Law and the Law of sin together. Paul Romans 7, 21.
calls sin a Law, because it commands a man, even as the Law does. Gods Law
is a straight Law, the streightest Line in the Mathematickes, is the shortest
Line, and if we would go the straight way to happiness, let us keep this Law
of God; but enter not in the way of sin; for it is a crooked Line, and it
will be long ere we come to our journeyes end, if we walk out of this plain
way: the Law of sin is easy in the beginning and narrow in the end; but the
Law of God is contrary: the Law of sin is lato-angusta, but the Law of God
is angusto-lata.

The conclusion of this is. From the generality of the Pagans shall be judged,
only by it, as it is the Law of nature. The Jews shall be judged by it, as it
is the Law of Moses; by whom the Lord wrote these great things of his Law, Hos.
8, 12. There is one that accuses you, even Moses in whom ye trust, Ioh. 5, 45.
Thirdly, Christians shall be judged by the evangelicall law. Romans 2, 16. God
shall judge the secrets of men, by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.

But if any man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man
beholding his natural face in a glass; for he beholds himself and goes
away, and straight way forgeteth what manner of man he was, Iam. 1.23. So it
is, if we forget our spiritual face when we look in the Law.

From this that the Law is spiritual and searches the Aquinas says out of
Seneca; Servitus in totum hominem cujuscunque, sortis per omnia non descendit:
but we may convert this speech, Servitus in totum hominem cujuscunque sortis
per omnia descendit: no Law of man can bind the conscience of any, no not of
the poorest Slave that is, Slaves in the Revelation are called, (...).
bodies, Rev. 18.13. She sold bodies, that is, slaves; why are slaves called
(...) bodies? because as Epiphanius observes, their Masters commandments
reach only to their bodies; therefore the Apostle calls them, their Masters
according to the flesh. (...) Vaginae, ^haldaice corpus
Ephesians. 6.5. the body is but nedena the sheath of the soul. Dan. 7.15. I Daniel
was greived in my spirit in the midst of my Sheath. But the moral law of God
binds both soul and body: and this is that which James says, there is one
Lawgiver who can both save and destroy. Iam. 4.12. meaning God who can destroy
both soul and body.

speak evil of his brother Iam. 4.17. for then he judges the Law, because
the Law forbidderh a man to speak evil of his brother, and as the strokes
which are given upon the left side, are felt upon the right: so when we speak
evil of our brother, we wrong the Law in not submitting our selves to it; and
Judge that, which should be our Judge; and then we wrong God himself who gave
this Law, and we say as the house of Israel said, the way of the Lord is not
equal. Ezekiel. 18.25.

EXERCITAT. II. The manner how the Lord gave the Law.
Exodus 19.16. And it came to pass, one the third day in the morning that there
were thundrings and lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount, etc.
FIrst consider, where the Lord gave this Law? upon Mount Sinai, and in the
Tabernacle. Secondly, how he gave it? with thundering and lightning. why Sinai
was called the mountain of God.


The Lord gave his Law upon Mount Sinai: it is called the mountain of God; not
for the height of it, as tall Cedars are called the Cedars of God: but it is so
called because oftentimes the Lord appeared there and gave his Law there: and
from this the Heathen called their Gods, the Gods of the Mountains 1 King.
20.13. And therefore they sacrificed in the high places.

The Apostle, A comparison betwixt Sinai and Sion.
Gal. 4.25. makes a comparison between Sinai and Sion; that is, betwixt the
Law and the Gospel, and he compares Sinai and the Law to Hagar the bondwoman,
who brought forth bond Children; and Sinai to Sara the free woman, who brought
forth free Children, and he makes Sinai, Hagar and her Children (...), so he
makes Sion, Sara and her Children (...): which agree together or are in the
same rank: then he makes Sion, and Sara (...), so he makes Hagar and Sara;
and the bondwomans Children and the free. Let us study then to fly from
Sinai, that burns with fire and is a Mountain of blackness and darkness
and Tempest, where there is nothing but fear and terror, and which brings
forth Children of bondage: and let us come unto Sion and to the City of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, which brings forth free Children, Heb.
12.18.22.

Sinai and Sion like Ebal and Gerazim.
Sinai is like Mount Ebal, where the Tribes stood who cursed: and Sion is like
mout Gerazim, where the Tribes stood to bless. If we would be blessed, let us
draw near to Sion and Gerazim, and shun Sinai and Ebal.

The Law was given in Sinai and in the Tabernacle: some part of this Law
concerned only the Jews, The moral Law was given upon Mount Sinai, but the
ceremonial Law in the Tabernacle.
and some part of it concerned all the world. That which concerned all the
world was given upon the top of the Mount. The ceremonial Law which was given
to the Jews, was given to Moses in the Tabernacle, Levit. 1. and when the
Tabernacle was destroyed then the ceremonies were abolished: but the moral Law
which was given upon mount Sinai indureth for ever, and shall remain as long
as the Mountains shall stand.

The second thing to be considered, is the manner how the Lord gave his Law.

The Lord gave his Law with thunder and lightning, there is a great similitude
between natural Thunder and spiritual Thunder; The thunder is called Gods
voice.
natural Thunder is called the voice of God, and so is spiritual Thunder: but
the difference is this, the natural Thunder is the voice of God, but it is not
a distinct voice, it shows us that there is a God, but not distinctly that
there is a God: and as there is a difference, betwixt the speech which a man
makes with his fingers, Pro. 6.13. when he makes signs with his fingers he
is said to speak with them; and betwixt that which he speaks with his
tongue: so there is a greater difference betwixt this natural voice of God,
his Thunder, and his spiritual voice in the Word; the one is vox in Aere, the
other is vox in Sanctuario, Psalm. 29.9. But in the Temple every one speaks of
his glory,

Secondly, The natural thunder resembles the spiritual thunder, the word.
this natural Thunder resembles the spiritual thunder in subtilitie, for
this natural Thunder will break the bones and not the flesh, and it will
pierce very subtly: yet the spiritual Thunder far surpasses it; it will
devide betwixt the marrow and the bones, Heb. 3.12. and it discerns the very
cogitations of the heart.

Lastly, this natural Thunder makes Hindes to calve; it renteth the rocks,
and it breaks the hardest things which withstand it, but not the softest:
(...)
so does this spiritual Thunder, the Word of the Lord resists the proud, and
gives grace to the humble Iam. 4.6. Psalm. 81.7. I answered thee in the secret
place of thunder. Besether ragnas, Symmachus, (...) in loco abscondito
majestatis: and the reason of the speech was this, (...) vox.
when he was to reveal his will unto his people, he revealed himself and
spoke in the thunder, (...) filia voces, and the Grecizing Jews call thunder
(...) a voice.
as Exodus 19.16. and therefore kol is called a voice, and when Bath is joined
with it, it is taken for a kind of Prophecy among the Hebrews: and with the
thunder, he usually fortold them of somethings to come. Ioh. 42.29. when the
Father said to his Son I have glorified it, and will glorify it again. Some
of those that stood by said it thundered, others said it was an Angel that spoke
to him; Gods revelations made to the people were usually with thunder.
the reason was because these Revelations were usually in thunder, as if ye
should say, some say it was Kol, others say it was bath kol; and they say an
Angel speaks to him, speaking after the manner of the Chaldeans, who ascribe
the works of God, to his Ministers the Angels or contra. The Chaldes ascribe
the works of God to his Angels.
See Eccles. 5.6. say not before the Angel the, Seventy has it, say not
before God so the Chaldies call mortem repentinam, angelum mortis. And we may
observe further, that John, in all the Revelations made to him, joins thunder
with the Revelation. as cap. 4.5. and out of the Throne proceeded Lightening
and Thundrings, and voices. So cap. 6.1. I heard as it were the noise of
thunder, one of the four beasts saying come and see. So cap. 10.3. and when he
had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices: thus we see how the two
thunders go together: and therefore the Hebrews call them Tomim, (...)
gemelli. The Christian Jews, gemelli.
who observe, that prophecy and thunder went usually together: when they hear
it thunder so often, they ask of them who remain Jews still. What is the
cause that they hear no voice, nor Angel speaking unto them of their Messiah
to come? and these miscreants when it thundreth do light candles, hoping to
hear that comfortable voice of their Messiah; whom they expected so long.

The people when they heard the thunder, and the Lord speaking, to them out of
the cloud, were exceedingly affrayd, Exodus 20.19. and they said unto Moses,
speak thou with us, and we will hear. The Lord behoved to qualify this voice
to them, and Moses himself feared and quaked, Heb. 12.21

Moses and the people were affrayd at the giving of the Law.
When the Lord appeared to Elias, there came a strong wind and rent the
Mountains, and the Rocks, and the Lord was not there: and after the wind, an
Earthquake; and the Lord was not there: and after the Earthquake, a Fire; and
the Lord was not there: and after the Fire, a still small voice, and the Lord
was there. 1 King. 19.17.18, the Lord has qualified these thunderings of the
Law; and of Kol, a thundering voice, he has made, bath Kol, vox in silentio, a
small voice; and now Bonarges, the sons of thunder, do qualify their
threatenings, and temper them; that they become the sons of consolation; and
as after thundering there comes Rain: so after their threatenings, with pity
and tears of compassion; they end in comfort.

EXERCITAT. III. That the Law was written in Tables of Stone.
Exodus 34.1, And the Lord said unto Moses, hew the two Tables of Stone, like
unto the first.
LEt us consider first who wrote the Law? secondly why it was written upon
stone? thirdly why upon hewn stone? forthly, why upon two Tables? lastly, why
and wherefore they were so written, that this writting took up the whole
Tables; so that there was no blanke left?

First the Lord wrote the Law: To write accordtng to the phr^se of Scripture,
to give Laws.
to write according to the phrase of the Scripture, is usually, to give Laws,
as Esaias 10.1. Woe to them that write grievous things which they have
prescribed. So Dan. 6.8. Now O King, write the decree, that is, give out the
Law.

Whether were the second Tables written by God, Moses?

They were written by God as the first were, Deuteronomy. 10.2. it is said I will
write in the Tables, the words that werein the first Tables.

But it may be said, Exodus 34.28. that Moses was with the Lord forty days and
forty nights, he did neither eat bread nor drink water: and he wrote upon
the Tables, the words of the covenant, the ten Commandments.

God wrote the second Tables as he did the first.
The words should be read this ways, and he did neither eat nor drink, to wit
Moses, here is a rest distinguished by the point Atnach. and he wrote upon
Tables, to wit God.

How God, Moses, and the King, are said to write the Law.
Observe, that God wrote the Law upon stone with his own finger, and Moses
wrote the Law, and the King is commanded to write out the Law. The Lord wrote
the Law, (...)
that is, the ten Commandments: and Moses wrote the Law, that is, Hhamusha,
the whole five books of Moses: (...)
and the King wrote the Law Deuteronomy. 17:18. This is called Mishne torah, the
repetition of the Law, or the copy of the Law, John 8, 32. And the reason why
the King wrote out Deuteronomie, The King wrote out Deuteronomie only.
rather then any other part of Moses Law, was this; because it is a compend of
the whole Law, and all these things commanded to them concerning the King, are
set down in it: in the other books, there are many histories and things,
which concern the Priests, and belong not to the King: therefore he wrote them
not out.

The Lord wrote the ten Commandments, and gave them by the ministry of the
Angels to Moses, Gal. 3.19. How the Law is said to be given by the Angels.
It was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator, that is, Moses and the
Angels were Mediators in the giving of this Law. So Act. 7.53. They received
the Law by the disposition of Angels. Moses himself again wrote the
Judicial, and ceremonial Law, but grace was given by Christ. The first was
given by God himself as common principles to all; and these which Moses gave,
were more particular determinations, and cases depending upon this Law; but
Jesus Christ gave grace.

New Testament with his own hand, as the Lord wrote the ten Commandments with
his own hand?

The reason seems to be this; Why Christ wrote none of the new Testament with
his own hand.
if Christ had written any of the Gospel with his own hand, then
superstitious people would have preferred it, to that which was written by the
Apostles: for, if men make an Idol of the cross, upon which they hold, that
Christ was crucified; and of the nails that nailed him to the Cross: far
more would they have made an Idol of that which Christ wrote with his own
hand: and this seems to be the reason, why Christ Baptized none with his own
hand.

But by this reason it should seem,

There was no such danger of Idolatry here;

The Lord wrote the commandments upon stone. We find in the Scripture, that
they did write of old in Lead, Job. 19.24. so in stone. Thirdly in the Sapphire
and other precious stones; as the names of the twelve Tribes were written upon
two Onix stones. Exodus 28.10. the Jews wrote in Lead and stone, etc
And upon the precious stones in the Brestplate. ver. 12. Fourthly, upon Tables
which are called ceraetae, or levigatae tabulae, set over with wax; and they
were called Pugillares tabulae, quod stylo pingerentur, So Luc. 1.36. Zachary
called for writting Tables. Fifthly, they wrote in parchment, So Iere. 36.
Iehoiachim cut the roll of Ieremies prophecy with a knife. So they wrote in
brass, as that covenant which was made betwixt the Romans, and the Jews, was
written in brass, 1 Mac. 8.22. and cap. 15.13.

Most of the Jews hold, that the Law was written by God in a Sapphire. And
Epiphanius is of this mind in his treatise of the twelve precious stones. So
Rabbi Joseph in his Paraphrase upon Cant. 1. Suidas in Mosen and Abulensis upon
Exodus 24.16. The Law was not writt^n upon a Sapphire but upon some other stone.
and for this they allege that place Deuteronomy. 33.2. The Lord did shine from
Paran, and there came a fiery Law from his right hand: they say the glorious
beams which came from the Lord shined upon the Sapphire, and made a reflexe
back again, casting glistring beams like the fire; but this is a mistaking
of the place: the meaneing of the place is only, that the Lord takes a
comparison from the sun here, which in the morning shows a light before it,
then afterward it arises, and enlighteneth the earth: so by degrees God show
his power amongst the Israelites wheresoever they went, even from Egypt whence
they came, until they came to the Land of Edom, which was near to the
promised Land. Then it was not a Saphir upon which he wrote; but another stone.

He wrote upon stone, to signify the hardness of our hearts.
He wrote upon stone, to signify the hardness of our hearts: there is no stone
so hard, as the heart of a graceless man is: therefore, Zach. 7.12. They made
their hearts like the Adamant stone. This Adamant is such a sort of stone, that
no Iron can cut it, it will break any mattell says Hierome, but it cannot be
broken it self: therefore the Greeks called it (...) ab (...) et (...)
because it cannot be broken: and Pliny writing of it says, Durities ejus est
inenarrabilis, et simul ignium victrix natura, et nunquam incalescens, and then
he adds, illa invicta vis, The heart of man like the Adamant.
et duarum violentissimarum naturae rerum contemptrix, hircino tamen rumpitur
sanguine fadissimo animalium. That is, this Adament which will neither be broken
by Iron, or will be made hot by the fire; yet the blood of the stinking Goat
will make it soft, this most fitly represents the hard heart of man: because
the base commodities, and the threatenings of men; will make his heart to yield;
but it is hard like the Adamant to resist the Law of God, Iere. 5.13. They have
made their faces harder than the rocks. The heart of a wicked man is like the
Smythes anvill, the more strokes that it gets, the harder it is, this is a
fearful thing, 2 Chronicles. 28.20.21.22. When the Lords hand was against Achaz,
the more that he afflicted him, the more he hardened his heart; therefore the
Lord says of him; This is that Achaz. And Kinchi marketh upon Psalm. 115. that
the Article Hu, is set-before some notable transgressors, as Genesis 36.43. (...)
The Hebrews call this milleth hat^gnam, dictio quae auget significationem.
This is Esau the Father of the Edomites So Numb. 26.9. this is that Dathan and
Abiram. So Genesis 10.9. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. So 2 Chronicles. 28
This is that Achaz that hardened his heart.

He wrote the Law upon stone, The Law was wrieten upon stone, to signify the
perpetutey of it.
to signify the perpetuity of it. The Lord commanded his Prophets to write
their P^ophesies upon Tables, Esaias ^0.8. But the Seventie has it, ^cribe super
Buxe, write them on the bush tree, which consumes not. Job. 13.28. to signify
the indurance of the troubles that were upon him, expresses it by writting,
saying Thou writest bitter things against me. To correct is actio transiens, to
write is actio permanens.

The Lord wrote the Law upon hewn stone, to teach us, that he must prepare our
hearts and smooth them, before they can receive the Law: this is called in the
Scriptures, Breaking up of the fallow ground Hose. 10.12. For as the Husbandman
in the Summer breaks up the ground, and pulls out the Thorns; that the
Land may be fit to receive seed: So the Lord breaks up the fallow ground
of our hearts, God prepares the heart before he sow the seed of grace.
and pulls out the Thorns, that he may sow in the seed of grace; and he
makes smooth the heart with his preventing grace, that it may be fit to
receive his Heavenly characters; he will not write his Law in a rough and
unsmooth heart.

He wrote the Law upon two Tables, and Solomon alludeth to this. Prove. 3.3.
Write mercy and truth upon the Table of thy heart. The Lord does not care that
thou have the Law written upon the posts of thy door, and the fringes of thy
garment; but he will have it written in the heart. Psalm. 40.7. In the volume of
thy book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea thy Law
is in the midst of my heart. Where the holy Ghost alludeth to the form which
was under the Law, they wrote upon parchment and rolled it up upon a piece of
wood, or upon a reed Luc. 4.2. (...) He rolled up the book; Hence came this
phrase amongst the Latins. Ducere ad umbilicum.
as if he would say, thy Law O Lord is not written upon the roll and wrapped
up that way, but it is written in the midst of my heart.

(...) Hinc and hinc.
Whether were these two Tables written one both the sides, or were they written
upon one side only; because, the Text says they were written mize umize, one
both the sides, one the one side, and on the other, Exodus 22.15. The Seventy
read it, Hinc et hinc erant scriptae.

The Law was not written on both sides of the Tables, but upon one side.
They were written on both the sides; that is, they were written in both the
Tables; but they were not written, as the rowles were written, both within and
without; Zach. 5.3. The curse of the Thief upon the one side, and the curse of
the Swearer upon the other side; mize umize it was written in both the sides,
that they might read it both before and behind.

(...)
They had two sorts of writings, first, that which the Hebrews call Gnalpanim in
facie; the other in tergo. The Greeks had (...) rowles, which were written
upon the one side only, and (...) rowles which were written both within and
without. The Tables were (...) written upon the one side, Scripta (...). (...).

but the roll of Gods judgment Ezekiel. 2.10. was (...) and it had written in it
Lamentations and mourning and woe. So the flying, roll of the curse of God
Zach. 5.3 had the curses written both within and without, and the Lord wrote
this way only to the wicked; When the Lord is said to write, he writes upon
both sides to the wicked, but upon the one side to the godly.
but the Law was given not as a curse but as a direction to Gods Children, and
therefore it was written but upon the one side of the Tables:

Lastly, this writting took up the whole Tables, No blanke left for man to
add any thing to the Law.
to signify, that there was no blanke left for man to add any thing to this
Law. Deuteronomy. 4.2. Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither
shall ye diminish ought from it.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
this Law was written upon Tables of stone and they were broken, to signify,
that we break this first Covenant: but in the New covenant when he gives us
hearts of flesh Ier. 31.33. and shall betroth us to himself for ever in
judgment righteousness and in loving kindness, Hos. 2.19. Then we shall not
fall away from the covenant again.

EXERCITAT. IIII. The Preface of the Law.
Exodus 2.20. I am the Lord thy God, etc.
THe Lord, Exodus 34.28. wrote upon the Tables the Words of the Covenant, the
ten Commandments. Some err in dividing the Commandments.
Here it is expressly said, that there are ten Commandments; but men have
erred sundry ways in dividing these Commandments: for some of the Jews make
the first and second but one Commandment; yet to make up the number of ten,
they made this the first Commandment, I am the Lord thy God etc. and they say,
this must of necessity be presupposed, To believe that there is a God who
commands; and they hold, that in this Commandment the Lord binds them To
believe in him. They clear the matter by this comparison. If a King should
come to a people whom they know not, and he were to give them Laws, it were
necessary first that they should know him to be a King; and what right he had
over them to give them Laws: So when God says I am the Lord your God, it is
as much as if he should say, The Israelites believed in God before they
received the Law.
receive me for your King and submit you to my Laws. But this should not
induce us to think, that these words are a command: for the Israelites before
they came to receive the Law, they believed in him, Exodus 4.31. and Exodus
14.31. after that they had passed the red sea, They believed in God and in
Moses. They believed in God already, and therefore they needed not a new
precept to be given them that they should believe, but that was presupposed:
for if they had not first believed, he should not have given them these Laws:
and they promised that when he was about to give them the Law, that all things
the Lord would bid them do, that they would do Exodus 19.8. In these words
then, I am the Lord thy God, The Lord made an intimation to them in these words.
there is nothing commanded, but only an intimation made to them who it is
that speaks to them, to wit, the Lord God.

All the Commandments are set down by way of precept. Thou shall not commit
Adultery, and, Thou shall not steal. The right exposition of the words.
These words Exodus 34.28. God wrote in Tables the ten words of the Covenant,
should not be translated here, He wrote ten Sentences. as Mat. 21.24. I will
ask you one word; that is, one Sentence, or one Question: but it is taken
here, Prosententia precipiente, for a commanding Sentence, as Esth. 1.10. The
Queen refused to come at the word of the King, These words are not a
Commandment, but a Preface.
that is, at the commandment of the King. So De calogus is called (...) by the
Apostle, a command: ten words, that is, ten commands. These words then are not
a command, but a preface to the commands; because they are not set down by way
of precept as the rest of the Commandments.

In this preface we have to consider what is craved of us? secondly who craveth
it of us? First, what is craved; obedience, that they should hearken: for
obedience begins at the ear, Speak Lord, for thy Servant hears 1 Samuel
3.10. Secondly who craveth this attention? it is Iehova, the great and mighty
God.

There are four things to be marked in this name Iehova; first, that God
revealed not himself to any, Four things to be marked in the name Iehova.
by his name Iehova until Moses time, Exodus 6.3. I was known before to be
shaddai, and I manifested my self to the Patriarchs by Adonai, and Elohim;
but I manifested not my self, by my name Iehova, which signifies my essence,
until I revealed my self unto thee, Moses.

But this name Iehova was known before Moses time, Genesis 4.26. incaptum est
nomen Iehova invocari, So Genesis 15.8.

The Fathers who lived before Moses time, The Lord revealed not himself by his
name Iehova, until he reveal^d himself to Moses. (...)
called him not Iehova, but Elohim or Adonai; but Moses, who wrote the history
of Genesis, after that this name was revealed unto him, he used this word,
Iehova, in the history of Genesis. Moses does not set down here the words of
the Patriarchs, but the sense of their words: they called him Elohim and
Adonai, but Moses called him Iehova. This name was Peli before, a hid name,
admirable, or secret. Peloni almoni, is a name in the Scriptures, which is not
expressed but understood; as Ruth. 4.1. So in the Gospel, Ye shall go unto
what shall I call him his house. (...)
Mat. 26.18. and of Peloni almoni, is made Palmoni, Dan. 8.13. which the
Seventy translate (...) for it is a hid name of reverence, which is
communicated to none. (...)
When Manoah asked the Angel what his name was, he answered my name is Peli,
admirable or secret Judge. 13.18. The Heathen had some dark footesteps of the
name Iehova,
The Heathen had some dark footsteps of this admirable and secret name; for
upon the gate of the Temple of Minerva which was called Sai, they had this
inscription written: Ego sum omne quod extitit, est, et erit, meumque peplum
nemo adhuc mortalium detexit. And they prayed that their God would unvaile
himself unto them, that they might understand something of his great majesty.
It was not for the benefit of the Church to know the Angels name; and therefore
he concealed it.

Sundry causes which make men conceal their names.
There are many causes wherefore men conceall their names; sometimes fear,
sometimes shame, sometimes deceit, sometimes wisdom, sometimes charity and
humility makes them to conceall their names. When Paul wrote his Epistle to the
Hebrews; wisdom made him to conceall his name: for he becoming now of a Jew,
a Christian; his Epistle would have had the less credit with the Jews: and
therefore he concealeth his name. Why the Lord kept up his name Iehova from
the Patriarchs so long.
The reason, why the Lord kept up his name Iehova from the Patriarchs so long,
was his wisdom: but now when the promises were to be accomplished which he
had made before; he expresses his name Iehova.

The second thing to be considered in this name is, that he is called Eheie,
Ero qui ero, Exodus 3.14. that is, whose eternity endures for ever: and he is
called Eheie, who was, is, and is to come: for, the future tense with the
Hebrews comprehends all the three times, past, present, and to come. John
says of the beast, Reve. 17.11. the beast which was, and is not: the thing
that is past, is not: and Ezekiel. 26.19. thou shall be no more: God is
opposite to man by way of contradiction.
when a man is dead he was, and is no more. God is only immortality, he is
Alpha and Omega, and he is opposite to man by way of contradiction, which is
the greatest contrariety that is. deus est, homo non est, John expressing this
name Eheie, expresses it thus (...), Revel. 1.8. setting them down as nounes;
and he would rather commit a soloecisme in the Greek tongue, then not to
express the name Iehova by them: for by nature they are participles, they
should not be taken materially here (...), but as participles, and they should
be declined (...): but to express Eheie and Iehova, he calls them (...) etc.

The third thing to be observed in this name is, The letter Iod added to some
words for the whole name Iehova.
that some times the letter Iod and no more of the name Iehova, is added to
words: example Jonas. 1.9. I am an Hebrew and I fear the Lord God; it is in
the original Gnibhri anochi, as if he should say, (...)
I am an Hebrew of Iehova or belonging to him, the letter Iod is not Affixum
here, and the sentence would be perfect without it Gnebher anochi: but this Iod
added to it, carries this sense, (...)
I am an Hebrew belonging to Iehova.

The fourth thing to be observed in the name Iehova, The name Iehova is given
to no creature, as the rest of Gods attributes are.
is this, that his other attributes, Adonai, and Elohim, are given to
creatures, as to Angels and to men; but this name Iehova is never given to any
creature.

The last thing to be observed in this name, is this, The name Iehova is never
pronounced with it own vowels.
that it is never pronounced, nor written with the own vowels of it; but
either with the vowels of Elohim, or Adonai, and the Seventie translate it
always (...), Of this see more Commandment. 3.
and the Jews call it (...) ineffabile, (...), indicibile, and (...)
ineloquibile.

I am the Lord thy God. The preface includes in it remission of sins, the
resurrection and life everlasting.
To be their God includes three special blessings in it. First, remission of
sins. Secondly, the resurrection of the body. and thirdly, life everlasting.

First it includes in it remission of sins, and it is concluded thus.

They who are blessed, have God to be their God.

They who have their sins remitted, are blessed.

Therefore, they who have their sins remitted, have God to be their God.

Secondly, the resurrection of the body is contained within this preface I am
the Lord thy God; as Christ proves against the Sadduces. I am the God of
Abraham and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, God is not the God of the
dead; but of the living, that is, of those who live to God, although their
bodies be in the grave. To prove the resurrection out of this place, some
frame the argument after this manner.

They who live in their souls after their bodies are dead, must rise again in
their bodies;

But Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, live in their souls, although their bodies be
dead;

Therefore, their bodies must rise again.

But this argument, although it hold well enough against those who hold the
immortality of the soul, yet it proves not against the Sadduces who deny the
Immortality of the soul: but to fit the argument against the Sadduces, and
those who deny the Immortality of the soul; it must be framed thus.

An argument to convince the Sadduc^s, who denied all the Scriptures except the
five books of Moses.
They who have God, to be their God; must live again,

But Abraham Isaac and Jacob, have God, to be their God:

Therefore, they must live again.

This argument will hold against the Sadduces who admitted the five books of
Moses, and granted that God made a covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob.

Sadduces might have said, that God might have been their God while they were
living, and now ceased to be their God when they were dead.

(...) I am their God, and not, I was their God: for although the word Sum be
not expressed in the covenant, yet it is to be understood after Any according
to the manner of the Hebrews. (...)


He might have been the God of their souls,

The Sadduces could not frame this answer, I am the God of Abraham, that is,
of whole Abraham. For when any thing is attributed or astricted to a part, the
Whole is presupposed first. Example, the black Moore is white in his teeth,
When any thing is attributed to the part, the whole is first understood.
then the Moore must first exist who has the white teeth. So if the Whole
exist not, In potentia at least, then this limitation cannot be made to the
soul, that he might be the God of Abraham's soul; as though the body never
were to rise again: and if their bodies were not to rise again, how could he
be called the God of their bodies? or why commanded he their bodies to be
circumcised and made them Temples of the holy Ghost, if he had not been
minded to raise them again? To live then, must be understood here first of the
soul, living actually, and of the body, living potentially, which by the power
of God shall be raised again; and it is said in this sense, The Churchyard is
called the house of the Living.
Mark. 5.39. She is not dead but alive. How was she living? by the power of God
who was able to raise her again: and therefore the Hebrews call the Church
yard, Domus viventium, The house of the Living because the bodies lived to God
all this time. The Jews themselves believe the resurrection Esaias 26.19. (...)
Nebhelathi jekumun, Cadaver meum resurgent that is, I believe that my body
shall rise again and others with me, so. Ioh. 11.24. I know that he shall rise
again in the resurrection at the Last day.

Thirdly, this preface contains in it life eterall. Heb. 11.16. God is not
ashamed to be called their God and he has prepared for them a City to come,
Heb. 11.16.
it is concluded thus.

If their God had not prepared for them a City to come he might have been
ashamed;

But their God cannot be ashamed:

Therefore their God has prepared for them a City to come.

I am the Lord thy God; here he teaches them the, application of all the
promises of Salvation to themselves. Heb. 11.13. the faithful embraced the
promises and kissed them, The comforts in divinity stands in these possessive
promises mine, thine, ours.
this was their parrticular application of the promises. The Schoolmen say
well, that all the comfort in divinity lies in these possessive pronounes
mine, thine, and our's, (...) tu mihi.
a Savior is borne to you, Luc. 2.11. So Paul who has given himself for us
Tit. 2.14. And the comfortable promises of the Gospel, Thou art mine, this is
the sum of the whole covenant.
is Esaias 43.1. Li atta, tu mihi, which is (...), a short sentence, but
comprehending all the promises of Salvation in it: when God says thou art
mine, and our hearts can answer him again we are thine. This is a happy
meeting: the Jews used to write these two short words Li atta, the sum of
the whole covenant, as a motto upon their rings, and above their gates: Mine
and thine are words of love. 2 King 20.32. Achab said to Benhadad he is my
brother, then the text says the men did diligently observe whether any thing
would come from him (meaning from Achab) and they did hastily catch this word,
when he said is my Brother: So when the Lord utterreth this word to us, I am
your God, we should hastily catch it, and lay hold upon it; and make particular
application to our selves of the promise: but hypocrites cannot make this
particular application to themselves of these promises of salvation; Hypocrites
cannot make particular application of God, nor his promises to themselves.
when the Lord offered a sign to Achaz, Esaias. 7. the Prophet said to him ask
a sign of the Lord thy God, but how answered the hypocrite? I will not tempt
the Lord, but he durst not say, I will not tempt the Lord my God: but Esaias can
apply that to himself, will ye tempt the Lord my God Esaias 7.13. Pharao said
Exodus 10.17. Pray to your God for me, that he may take away this plague from me:
and so Darius Dan. 6.20. calls him Daniels God, and not my God, and see how
strangely the Jews spoke of Christ; There is one Christ who is dead and risen
again, Act. 25.19. and the Devils say, Jesus thou son of the most high God,
what have we to do with thee, Mark. 5.7.

How comes it, Balaam that wizard makes particular application to himself,
calling God his God Number. 22.18. I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God.

Balaam called God his God, Hetruscians, How Balaam called God his God.
taking him to be that Hetruscian God who had informed his mind, and
enlightened it at that time.

How comes it that Ezekias says to Esaias. 2 King 19.4. it may be the Lord
will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, and will reprove the words which the
Lord thy God has heard?

He calls him Esayes God, and not his God, Pharaoh and Nebuchad-nezzer did,
but only because Esaias was their mouth to the Lord at that time, who brought
the answers to them from God.

The last thing which is contained in this preface, is, the reason why they
should obey him? because he brought them out of the Land of Egypt.

The conclusion of this is, Psalm. 119.130. Conclusion.
the entrance to thy words gives light, and gives understanding to the simple.

EXERCITAT. V. Commandment 1.
Exodus 20.3. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.
The first and second Commandment, are two distinct Commandments.
THe first and the second Commandment are two distinct Commandments, and not
one, as the Church of Rome would make them: for if they were not two distinct
Commandments, then whatsoever religious duties are required, and offenses
forbidden in Gods Word elsewhere, could not be contained here under one of
these Commandments: but all religious duties required besides in any other
Scripture; can, and must be contained in some distinct Commandment of the
first Table, and there are many religious actions commanded, which we must
refer to some general head, and some distinct Commandment in the first
table, which cannot be referred to the first or third Commandment, or to the
fourth, and therefore of necessity they are to be referred to the second
Commandment. To bow before God belongs both to the first and second
Commandment in diverse respects.


Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them. These words belong both to
the first and second Commandment in diverse considerations; To bow the body,
is an exercise of religious worship due to God, and we must not perform it to
any other creature There are two sorts of bowing of the body, the first is an
absolute bowing or terminatiua adoratio, as they call it, and stayed in the
thing, to which it is given; and this is performed when the thing it self is
the principal cause why the worship is given unto it. Adoratio terminativa
relativa.

This sort of worship is due only to God himself and it belongs to the
first Commandment, although it be an external action of the body, 1 Timothy
2.8. Adoratio terminativa, quid.
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without
wrath and doubting. This external action of the body, To lift up the hands,
belongs to the first Commandment. The second sort of bowing or of bodily
worship is that, which we call Relatiua, quando non terminator in creatura,
Adoratio relativa, quid.
when it ends not in the creature, Sed transit in aliud, it passes to
another; and this sort of worship is forbidden in the second Commandment: such
was the worship which Cornelius would have given to Peter Act. 10.25. and which
John would have given to the Angel Revela. 19.10.

Secondly, others distinguish the first and the second Commandment this way:
Neither all, nor only inward worship, is commanded in the first Table.
that all inward worship is commanded in the first Commandment, and all
outward worship, in the second but neither all, nor only, inward worship is
commanded in the first Commandment: as to bow the knee before God terminative
et absolute, is judged a part of the worshipe of God in the first Commandment:
so both the outward and inward relative worship are condemned in the second
Commandment. When a man carries any religious and reverent respect to worship
before the creature, this is condemned in the second Commandment, as when the
Philistims would not tread upon the threshold where Dagon broake his neck 2 Samuel 5.5.

Thirdly when false worship is given to the false God, they make that a breach
of the second Commandment; and when true worship is given to the true God,
they say this is commanded in the first Commandment: but this distinction
holds not, for when a man worshipeth a false God, by false means; as when a
Covetous man makes a God of his money, it is a breach of the first
Commandment, and not of the second: but when he goes about to worship: any
creature for Gods cause outwardly in act, this relative worship is condemned in
the second Commandment.

Ye shall have no other Gods before me: these words are not rightly translated,
ye shall not make Peregrinos deos, strange Gods: he forbideth not only deos
gentium, which are dij peregrinj, but thou shall make to thy self no Gods,
(...) alienus.
although thou never learn of another people to make them. And this word Achar
in other places of the Scripture, is expounded by these two words, Necar and
Zar, so that he forbids to have any God but himself.

It is great Idolatry to worship the Gods of other people, being deceived by
them; as the heart of Solomon was drawn to worshipe strange Gods by the
example of his Wives. It is greater Idolatry when they make choice to worship
them, not being compelled for fear, To worship Gods whom their Fathers knew
not, a great sin.
as they would have driven David to do, 1 Samuel 26.19. thus did Amaziah
willingly worship the Gods of the Edomites after that he had overcome them, 2 Chronicles. 25.14. but a higher sort of Idolatry, is to worship Gods whom their
Fathers knew not. Deuteronomy. 32.17. this was a greater sin than to worship the Gods
of their Fathers.

(...)
Before me, in the Hebrew it is, Gnal Panai which may be expounded in my place;
as Deuteronomy. 21.16. he may not make the son of the beloved first borne, gnal
Panai, in place of the son of the hated woman. Or, gnal panai, id est e
regione mei ye shall not bring in the Harlot in my sight.

Before me, God is a jealous God. Who will not suffer Idolum Zelotypiae, the
Image of Jealousy to be set up before him. The great hatred of God against
Idolatry.
Ezekiel. 8.3, he who should not suffer a stranger to enter into the Temple, how
can he suffer an Image to be set up before him? he who would not suffer the
Arc, and Dagon to stand together in the Temple of the Philistims; how can he
suffer an Idol to be set up beside himself in his own Temple? What boldness
was it in the Jews, to set up the Idol in mount Olevit, (...) Mons unctionis
a (...) unctus fuit. (...) Mons corruptionis a (...) corrumpere.
even in the sight of the Lord, for he never looked out of the Sanctuary, but
he saw that vile hill of abominations: therefore he calls it not, Har
hamishha, Mons unctionis, but Har hammashhith, Mons corruptionis, The Hill of
corruption, 2 King 23.13. And they came nearer with their Idols to set them up
before the Lord Ezekiel. 8.5. Northward at the gate of the Altar, this Image of
Jealousy in the entry was set up. This was the outmost gate in the court of
the Gentiles. And yet nearer, in Gazophylacijs, in the Chambers that were next
the Temple. When the Prophet dug a hole through the wall he saw them
worshipping creeping things and abominable beasts verse. 10. And yet nearer,
even to the North gate of the Lords house at the entry of the Court of the
Priests, there they set up the filthy God Tammuz. The Idols in Ezekiel's days,
were brought nearer and nearer, until at last they were brought within the
Temple.
And yet they come nearer which was a greater abomination, At the door of the
Temple of the Lord, betwixt the Porch and the Altar, were five and twenty men
with their backs toward the Lord, and their faces toward the East, and they
were worshipping the Sun. When they came to worship before the Lord they
turned their faces toward the Arc: When the people of God worshipped, they
turned their faces toward the Arc.
which was in the West end of the Temple, and when they came out of the Temple,
they returned not that way, by which they entered in: as when they came in at
the East gate, they went out at the North or North-eastgate, They went not out
of the Temple by the door at which they entered in.
but they went not out at the East gate because then they should have turned
their backs upon the Lord. If they might notturne their backs upon him; far
less might they turn their hearts from him. See Esaias. 1.4.

Ye shall have no other Gods. Acherim, Strange Gods, (...)
so it is called strange fire. Nom. 3.3. and strange incense Exodus 30.9. and
Levit. 10.1. So alienare se retrorsum, is to go Backward from the true God,
Esaias. 1.4. In worship, if we respect either the object, To have another God is
to have a strange God.
or the manner of the worship; to have another God, is to have a false God. so
Gal. 18.9. Another Gospel, is a contrary Gospel, and Disparata sunt
contraria in cultu divino, ubi est alius et alius non est vnus cultus;
therefore a strange God, is put here for a false God.

We may take up this Commandment in these propositions. First, ye shall have a
God. Secondly, ye shall have me for your God. Thirdly, ye shall have me only
for your God.

Many have not God to be their God.
First, ye shall have a God. The most people of the World have not God for their
God; there were and are three religions in the world, first Iudaisme, secondly
Christianity, and thirdly Paganism.

(...)
Iudaisme is considered in a threefold estate, first when they were Gnammi, My
people, secondly when they were Lo gnammi, (...) The estate of the Jews when
they were the people of God.
Not my people, and thirdly when they shall be Rubhama, to be pitied Hose. 1.

In the first estate, when they were gnammi, My people, then they worshipped
the true God, they waited for salvation in Christ to come, and they were
distinguished from other people by the badge of circumcision; then the
Proselyte of the Gentiles was numbered with them, and he was called Goi
gnikkari, (...)
Gentilis fundamentalis, when he had embraced the Articles of the faith. Those
who were opposite to the people of God in this estate, were either those who
mixed their religion with heathenish Idolatry, The Samaritans religion
contrary to the Jews in their first estate. (...)
such were the Samaritans: of these Chrysostom said, (...) to mix these
things that should not be mixed, the true worship with the false; and the
Jews stigmatized (as it were) the Samaritans with these two letters, Gnaijn
zain because they used strange worship. Or, those who fell away quite to
gentilisme, such as was Rabshake whom the Jews hold generally to have been an
apostate Jew; (...)
and such a one is called Copher begnikkar, Negans fundamentum.

In their second estate they are Lo gnammi, Not my people. And they despised me
Esaias. 1, The great ingratitude of the Jews in casting off the Lord, who had
done such great things for them.
They whom I begot and brought up, they upon whom I bestowed so great
privileges, they to whom I gave so many benefits with out their desert, they
whom I carried upon Eagles wings, Deuteronomy. 7.6. (for the Eagle does not carry her
young ones in her tallones as other ravenous fowls do, but upon her wings) I
was betwixt them and all danger, I covered them in Egypt with my wings, I
carried them through the Desert; and yet they have cast me off, whom they ought
to have worshipped: they have despised me in my Precepts, in my Counsels, and in
my Ceremonies, in my Patriarchs and in my Prophets, in my Judges and in my
Kings, and lastly they have despised me in my welbeloved Son, whom I sent to
them, Saying, perhaps they will reverence my Son Mat. 21.37. They regarded
not the rock of their Salvation, but judged him Plagued and smitten of God,
Esaias. 53.4. They rejected me, whom I accounted only for my children, and I
accounted all other people but dogs in respect of them, Matthew 15.26. But
they turning into Dogs have rent me, Psalm. 22. Philip. 2.3. And now the Turk
and the Jew are alike, (...) desiderabilis. a (...) desiderare.
he in his Desideratus Messiah, his wordly King; and the Turk in his Muhhamad,
his desiderabilis Mahomet, both circumcise; the Jews the eight day, the Turks
the eight year.

In their third estate, when they shall be Ruhhama, they and the Christians
shall be one, The Jews in their third estate shall be all one with the
Christians.
then there shall be one shepherd and one sheepfold, Ioh. 10.26. And the
seal of the Covenant shall be baptism, as it is to us now.

The second religion Professed in the World is Christianity, How they were
called Christians at the first,
those have God for their God, first they were called Nozerim, nazaraei and
afterward their name was changed at Antioch, (...)
and they were called Mesichijm Act. 11.26. And the seal of the covenant to
them is baptism. Opposite to these are Apostats who fall away from
Christianity; such a one is called Hemir dath, Mutans fidem.

Some fall totally from Christianity.
These who fall from Christianity: do fall away either totallie, or in part. If
they fall totallie, either they fall to Iudaisme, Turcisme, or Gentilisme.

(...) a radi^e, (...) en^ere.
First, if they fall to Iudaisme, then they are called Copharim, redempti pretio,
bought with a price.

Secondly, if they fall to Turcisme, if the Turks buy the Children of the
Christians, then they are called Mamlukin, and they circumcise them when they
are eight year old: and if they take them alive when they are men of age, then
they must renounce their Christianity, (...) a radice (...) pax.
and they must say; Non est Deus, nisi Deus et Mahumet, then they are
circumcised, and called Musulmanin, servati, a salem Pax.

The third sort are these who fall totallie to Gentilisme, as Julian the
Apostate.

Heretics and Schismatics fall from Christianity in part.
They who fall a way in part from Christianity, are either Heretics or
Schismatickes. Haeretici in veritatem; et Schismatici, in charitatem, peccant.

(...)
The third religion is Paganism, it is called Gajaroth, and in the Syrian
language the Paganes are called Aramaei. Galat. 3.28. The reason why they are
so called: is because the first Idolaters, mentioned of, in the Scriptures came
from Aram, or Syria: as Abraham's Father was a Syrian, Laban was a Syrian,
Naaman was a Syrian, and Balaam was a Syrian Deuteronomy. 23.4. And they put an
Aramite for an Idolater, as an Arabian for a Thief, Iere. 3.2. and a Chaldean
for a Genethliacke Dan. 2.2.

Brerwood in his inquiries.
If all the world were divided into thirty one parts, there will be found
ninetene parts to be possessed by Idolaters, seven by Mahumetans and Jews,
and but five parts by the Christians.

Nineteen parts are possessed by Idolaters, first some of Europe and the sixth
part of Africa, the most part of Asia, as India, Calecut, Cathay, and Tartarie,
all America, except a few drawn to Popery, be the Spaniards.

The Mahumetans possess six parts of the World, as Arabia, Persia, and a part
of Asia, as the Tartares, and the fourteenth part of Europe.

Christians possess but five parts of the World, and there are thirteen sects
amongst them. Papists, Grecians, Melchites or Syrians, Indians or Christians of
Saint Thomas, East Indians, Georgians, Muscevits and Russians, Nestorians,
Iacobits, Ophits in Egypt, Armenians, Abissaeni and Maronits.

Now take the true professores, and separate them from these corrupt
worshipers: then separate hypocrites from these true professors; and so we
shall see how few there are, who have God for their God. Conclusion.


The conclusion of this is: seeing that there are so few, that have the true
God, to be their God: let us study to be of the number of that little flock,
to make the Lord to be our God; and then we shall be his people.

EXERCITAT. VI. God is to be loved with all the heart. Commandment. 1,
Deuteronomy. 5.6. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, etc.
THis Commandment craveth of us that we should have God to be our God.
First, that we should love him. Secondly only love him. Thirdly, with our
heart, and with all our heart. Fourthly to put our trust in him, Reasons why we
should love God.
and hope in him. Lastly, to fear him.

Prove. 30.15. There are three things which are not satisfied, Nothing can fill
the heart but God.
yea four that say they have not enough: the grave and barren womb, the earth
that is not filled with water, and the fire that says not, it is enough. So
nothing can fill the heart of man, there is such an Immensitie, and emptiness
in it, that nothing can satisfy it but God himself: Cast three Worlds into
it, yet it will never say, it is enough, Et nullum datur vacuum, it must be
filled and nothing can fill it but God: Therefore he speaks to the heart,
and when it is empty he must fill it with graces. Satan is said to fill the
heart, Act. 5.3. But he cannot come in directly to the heart, to fill it, but
only to the sense and fantasy, this is proper to God only, both to fill the
heart and to give it contentment.

Nothing can give rest to the soul but God.
but God: the heart of man is like the needle of the Compass, that trembles
still, until it come to the Pole. 1 Samuel 25.29. The soul of a wicked man is
in a sling; that which is in a sling is violently tossed about: So is the soul
when it is not upon the proper object, God. David said Psalm. 30.10. Libbi
sehharchar, My heart was troubled; Sohher is called a Merchant going too and
fro selling his wares: (...) mercator a (...) circumare.
so is the heart of man troubled about sundry things; and the letters are
doubled here, to signify the great care and trouble, that David had, when he
sought after these things, as the Merchant seeks for his gain. When the rich
man said in the Gospel, Soul take thy, rest, for now thou have much goods
laid up for many years Luc. 12.19. He put the soul from the right object. But
when David said, Return my soul to thy rest, Psalm. 116.7. then he set his
Soul upon the right object.

Secondly, we must only love him, Nihil praeter, supra aut contra.

Whether is God to be loved for his benefits or not?

God is to be loved for himself, Although he should kill me, yet will I
trust in him. Job. 13.15. Medium quatale and perse nullam boni appetibilis
rationem possidet, tota quippe ratio amandi medium, est convenientia cum fine.
God is vltimus finis (as Thomas says) and we may not serve him for another
end, for then we should make ultimum finem but medium. An^igonus Sochaeus
says, Ne estote servis similes, qui dominis serviunt mercedis ergo. In Pirke
Abhoth.
There is great reward in keeping Gods Commandments Psalm. 19.11. The reward is
the end of our service, but it is not the end of that which we love; we expect
our reward, but we enjoy not our reward. These benefits in respect of our
infirmity may be motives to stir us up to love him, and they may be ordine
Prima, but never quoad dignitatem Pracipua. Ioh. 6.26. Ye seek me because ye
eat the bread and were filled. Job. 21.15. What shall it profit us, if we pray
unto him? They measure all their religion by profit, and will do nothing but
for gain. So Mal. 3.14. It is a vain thing to serve the Lord, Hypocrites
serve God for gain.
and what profit is it that we have keep his ordinances? Hypocrites serve God
for gain.
To those men gain is Godliness. 1 Timothy 6. And they are like little Children
that will not say their Prayers, unless we promise them their breakfast.

God is to be loved with the whole heart.
The manner how we should love him; we should love him with our heart, the
heart is the first thing that God looks unto. Prove. 23.26. Son give me
thine heart. God looks first upon the heart.
When the beast was cut up for a sacrifice the first thing that the Priest
looked upon, was the heart, and if the heart was naught, Simile.
the sacrifice was rejected: God looks first upon the heart of his Children,
and then upon their Sacrifices; as he looked upon Abel and upon his sacrifice.
God looks upon the intention without the act.
Genesis 4.4. Secondly, he looks upon the intention of the heart without the
act, as upon David's purpose to build the Temple; and here he accepts more of
the quality then of the quantity. Thirdly, he likes sometime the action of
an unregenerat man, but not as it proceeds from him. 2 Chronicles. 25.2. Amaziah
did that which was good in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.
The Lord likes the action of an unregerate man, but not as it proceeds from.
The things which he did were good in themselves, but not as they proceeded
from him.

Seeing the heart is that, which the Lord looks first upon; then every man
should study to purge his heart especially from Hypocrisy, which defiles all
our actions, Hypocrisy defiles all the actions of a man.
and makes the doung of our sacrifices to be cast in our faces. We have a
notable example how this Hypocrisy divides the heart Hos. 10.2. And hinders
it that it cannot love God. 1 Samuel 21.7. There was a certain man of the
servants of Saul there (Doeg) detained before the Lord. (...) Doeg was a great
Hypocrite.
But this does not express the force of the words in the original, Ninghzar
liphni Iehova, it carries this sense with it, Incluserat se ante Tabernaculum
ut studio legis occuparetur. He went of purpose to study the Law of God
there, and to understand his will, who would have thought, but that this
hypocrite came with an upright heart to serve the Lord? and yet because the
heart of him was not perfect, he became a most fearful persecuter, and
murderer of the Priests of God.

So when the Seventie went up to meet the Lord, Exodus 24.1. Nadab and Abihu
went with them, and yet because those rebels had not a good heart to love the
Lord: therefore they brought in strange fire to the Altar of the Lord. David
said Psalm. 18.44. That many of my servants mendaciter se subjiciunt mihi, Many
counterfitly submited themselves to me: So many counterfitely submit themselves
to the Lord, whose hearts are not upright with him. The prophet shows this
Hypocrisy. Iere. 17.8. The heart of man is deceitful above all things, in the
original it is, Gnakobh, A Supplanter.

Thou shall love the Lord with all thine heart, (...)
and it is enlarged, Deuteronomy. 6.5. Thou shall love the Lord with all thine heart,
soul, and might. And Marc. 10.30. with all thy soul, mind, and strength. In
the Hebrew it is ex toto valde tuo. The Chaldee Pharaphrast paraphraseth it, Ex
tota substantia tua, which is not the meaning of the Law. We are not curiously
here to seek the difference of these, mind, Soul, strength, and heart; (...)
but only to consider, what God craveth of us, that we should love him
unfainedly; and with an upright heart.

And that we may take up this the better, Repetition of words in the Scripture
sometimes does intend the affection, sometimes the signification, sometimes
both the affection and signification, and sometimes neither of them.
we must understand that repetitions in the Scripture, sometimes neither intend
the affection, nor signification; but diminish, them; example Job. 19.21. Have
pity, have pity upon me my friends. Here the doubling of the word neither
intends the signification, nor affection, but dimisheth it rather.

Sometimes again, when the same words are repeated, they intend both the
affection and signification. Psalm. 126. Venientes veniebant cum exultatione.
Here it intends both the signification and the affection, they came home as
cheerfully from the captavitie, as these who bring home their corn with joy
and gladness. Exam. 2. Ge. 25.30. and Esau said to Jacob, feed me I pray thee
with that red with that red pottage. Here the doubling of the same words
intends both the affection of Esau, and the signification of the words: that
is, With that excellent red pottage. But when the repetition is in diverse
words, it intends the affection, but not the signification of the words.
Example, Exodus 32.6. The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
play* hear the words to Eat, Drink, and Play, intend not the signification,
but only the affection of the people; they express how earnest the people
were in this their Idolatry. It is true, ye shall find when diverse words are
set down to express one thing, they sometimes intend the signification, as
well as the affection; but that is in the joining of the words, and not in the
words themselves. Example Luc. 17.17. They did eat, they drank; they married
wives, they were given in marriage. Here although their security be set down
by diverse words, yet the repetition of them intends the signification, as
well as the affection; they are set down here without any conjunction, The
Hebrews to express the earnestness of things, set down the words (...),
without a conjunction.
after the manner of the Hebrews: for the Hebrews when they would express
their earnest desire about a business, they set down their words without a
conjunction: but when diverse words are set down with a conjunction, then they
intend not the signification, but only the affection; as here, Thou shall love
the Lord with all thy s^ule etc. Here the words intend the affection, but not
the signification: and therefore we are not here curiously to seek how these
words differ, but to understand, that we should love the Lord, not only
comparatively, or appretiatively; but both intensively and extensively, as
far as we can: and as the sun beams gathered together and united in a
Cristall glass, Deus amendus est intensive and extensive.
burn the hoter: So all the affections gathered together and united, make the
love the more fervent, Tunc omnes fontes mei laudabunt te Psalm. 103.

Contrary to this love is lukewarmenesse in the service of God. Such was the
Church of Laodicea, God cannot abide lukewarm people.
because they were lukewarm, therefore the Lord says; I will spue them out of
my mouth. Rev. 3.16. For cold and hot things contract the stomach and make it
to keep the nourishment: but lukewarmenesse dilateth the stomach and makes
it spue out the nourishment: Non datur hic medium.
So the Lord cannot a bid those lukewarm people, but spueth them out.
Lukewarmenesse is not a midst between cold and heat, as in natural things;
but it is more opposite to heat than cold is.

And that we may conceive this the better, let us mark these four sorts of
people.

Continens and temperans, bonus. Incontinens and temperans, malus. Incontinens
and intemperans, pejor. Continens and intemperans, pessimus.
The best sort of these four, Four sorts of professors compared together and
who are worst.
are they who are both continent and temperate, subduing their passions, and
serving God in sincerity both in heart and deed; as Zachary and Elizabeth were
both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and ordinances of
the Lord blameless. Luc. 1.6.

Secondly, the Incontinent and Temperate are not the worst, as those who are
over ruled by their passions but burst not forth in act, as David when he was
about to kill Nabal; here he was incontinent: but by the wise council of
Abigail he was restrained from murder, and was temperate in his action.

Thirdly some are both incontinent and intemperat and yet these are not the
worst, who being overcome with their Passions burst forth in act, as David when
he committed adultery, and as he who killed in sudden passion: neither are
those most opposite to them who are both continent and temperat.

Fourthly, some are continent and intemperat, and they are worst of all, and
most opposite to the first sort. For such do not things through passion, but
under color and pretense of religion, as the Hypocrites: these the Lord does
abhor most of all, even as he who in cold blood kills a man, is more
detestable than he who kills in sudden passion: for this sin comes
nearest to the sin of the Devil, who is not subject to passion. And as these
who commit adultery not so much through lust, but out of the bad habit of
their mind, because it is contrary to the Law; are more hardly reclaimed than
others who are misled by lust (for here the reasonable faculty is corrupted,
and in the other the sensual faculty) so a man who through infirmity and
weakness, falls in the neglect of the service of his God; is not so corrupted,
as he who through a bad habit is corrupted, so that at no time he can love the
Lord. And the child of God may be compared to a man who falls into an
Epilepsie, but those lukewarm people are like those that have the Hydropsie
who thirst continually: and therefore of al sins we must abhor and detest
this lukewarmenesse most,

Whether is the hatred of God, or the ignorance of God the greater sin?

In genere moris Odium Dei est deterius ignorantia, Sed in penere entis
Ignorantia est deterior Odi^.
therefore the hatred of God opposite to the love of God, must be the greater
sin. But if ye will consider ignorance as opposite to the vision of God,
(wherein consisteh our blessedness) then the ignorance of God is a greater
sin than the hatred of God: for to see God is a more excellent thing, than to
love him.

And to love God the better we should hate our selves Luc. 21.26:

Man is considered in a fourefold estate. Man considered in a threefold estatr.
First in his innocent estate. Secondly in his corrupt estate. Thirdly in his
regenerate estate, and Fourthly, in his glorified estate.

In his innocent estate, to love God and to love himself were Idem: The love
of a man's e-selfe in his innocent state was but a reflex of the love of God.
for as the Echo est individuum cum suo sono, it is but the reflexe of the same
sound back again: so when man loved God in his innocent estate, and then
loved himself; it was but a reflexe of the love of God and but one love with
it.

In the second estate, to love God and to love himself are contrary, Romans
1.30. Haters of God. 2 Timothy 3.2. Men shall be lovers of their own selves.

In the third estate to love God and to hate our selves are not directly
contrary, but subcontrarie: for by this hatred is understood only less love,
and hatred is not properly taken here, this makes the subcontrarietie: and the
Schoolmen say well, Deus non extinguit, God takes not away the love of a man's
self but moderateth it.
sed ordinat affectiones, He takes not away the love of a man's self, but
only moderateth it; that he hate himself, that is, love himself less than
God; and in this sense it is said, Genesis 29.31. That he hated Leah, that is, he
less loved her than Rachel. In the fourth estate they shall be one again.

In statu primo, Amore deum et amare se, sunt idem.
In statu secundo, Amare deum et amare se, sunt contraria.
In statu tertio, Amare deum et edisse se, sunt subcontraria.
In statu quarto, Amare deum et amare se, sunt idem.
We cannot reach to the full measure of this love in this life, Our knowledge
of God in this life is not perfect. Simile.
the knowledge which we have of God, is but secundum modum recipientis, et non
recepti, that is, It is according to the measure of our knowledge, and not
according to the dignity of him that is known. Thou see in a looking glass
the Image of a face represented before it, the glass represents the face
here, not according to the perfection of the face, but only according to the
perfection of the glass; which represents the Image of things to us, and not
the essence of things. So we see the Image of the fire in the eye, not
according to the nature of the fire (for then it should burn and consume the
eye) but only the color and the figure of the fire; Our love to God in the
this life is, as our knowledge of him is.
and the eye although it be but little, yet it takes up the whole figure of
the Hemisphere: so the knowledge which we have of God, it is but a finite
knowledge, we know him not as he is infinite in himself, and our love is as
our knowledge is. In the life to come our knowledge shall be but a finite
knowledge, but then we shall love both Intensive et extensive to the full, that
is all, that the Law requires of us.

The Children of God love the Lord, vel secundum actum, always; as the
glorified in heaven: vel secundum studium: Diligitur Deus vel secundu^. actum.
studium. habitum,

for their care and endeavor is to love the Lord: this is the greatest
perfection of love, that the Children of God can attain unto, in this life:
vel secundum habitum; as many of the Children of God, when they fall into some
great sin, yet they lose not the habit of the love of God.

Papists hold that God requires not this love literally.
Most of the Schoolmen, and Papists hold, that this Commandment craveth not
this literally here; but only they teach that this is Medium, a midst to lead
us to the end, when we shall love him fully in the life to come: and they add
further, that Secundum sensum anagogicum, the Law requires this exact and full
love; but it craveth it not of us literally here in this life; and they say
there is a double perfection: First, Quando pervenitur ad finem. Secondly,
Quando non receditur a sine, When we attain to the end; Or when we go not
from the end. Simile.
And they give this example: A Captain says to his Soldiers, fight and
obtain the victory; some of them do fight and obtain the victory; some of
them again do their best, and yet obtain not the victory; yet they fight
also, and do fulfill the Captains Commandment: So in this life they say,
that God requires no more of us, but that we go not from the end, and in the
life to come that we attain unto the end. But these Soldiers who fight and
obtain not the victory, if the Captain should deall with them, In foro
stricti juris, According to the rigor of the Law, they should get no reward of
him; but it pleases the Captain to accept of the good indevours of his
Soldiers: and so dealleth God with his Servants, God accepts of the
endevou^s of his children in the Court of new obedience
he accepts of his Saints in the Court of new obedience, although they come
far short of that obedience, which is required of them.

But under the New Testament he promises that his Children should keep his
Laws. Ezekiel. 36.27.

They shall begin this new obedience in this life, Our new obedience begun
here, but perfect in the life to come.
and that more cherefully than under the Law: but that shall be perfected in
the life to come, which is required in the Law.

This one Commandment, to love the Lord with all our heart, is the
Commandment which we must study first: for all the rest are implied and
contained in it, as the conclusions are contained in the premises and this
Love is the fulfilling of the Law Romans 13.10. Amor Dei ^^p et Legem Reductive.
Effective. Formaliter.



This love of God, is the fulfilling of the Law three ways. First, Reductive,
because we fulfill all the Comments for the love of God. Secondly Effective,
he who loves the Lord is ready to obey him. And thirdly formaliter, quia
finis in moralibus habet rationem forma: for all our actions should be
referred to his glory.

To put our trust in God, is commanded in the first Commandment.
As this Commandment craveth of us to love God, so it Commands us to put our
whole trust in him, to hope in him, and to fear him. First, to put our trust
in him, He that trusts in the Lord shall stand as Mount Zion, that cannot he
removed. Psalm. 125.1. But the wicked who put their trust in any other thing,
their hope shall be cut off and their trust shall be a spiders house, Job.
8.14. mark the comparison, the spider spinneth a web out of her own bowels,
and she weaveth it most curiously, then she incloseth herself within the
midst of her web, as it were a house: but how easily is she swept away? So man
when he spinneth out of his own heart, his own imaginations and trusts in
them; The trust of the wicked, like the Spiders web.
they are but like the Spiders house unto him. These weave the Spiders web, but
their webs shall not become garments to them, neither shall they cover
themselves with their works, Esaias. 59.5.6.

The goodness of God is the object of our hope.
So we should hope in him. The reason wherefore we believe him, is the
authority of the speaker; although we have no evidence of that which we
believe: So the reason wherefore we hope in God, is his power and goodness,
that he is able and willing to perform that which we hope for. Fides respicit
primario veritatem, spes vero primario bonitatem.

So we should fear him. The Lord is called The fear of Isaac. Genesis 31.42. (as
he is called Expectatio et Patientia Israel, God is called The fear of Isaac.
Iere. 14.8.) that is, he whom Isaac fears, Esaias 8.13. Sanctify the Lord and
let him be your fear. It is the manner of the Scriptures, to put the habit or
the passion for the object. So Gal. 2.23. Actus potentia pro objecto ponuntur.
Faith is put for Christ the object of faith, and Romans 8. We are saved by hope,
that is, by Christ hoped for. So the fear of Isaac, that is, the Lord whom
Isaac should fear.

The Chaldees call God Dehil, (...)
terror or fear Dan. 2.31. Jacob coming from Syrian and being to swear to a
Syrian, swears to him according to the Syrian or Chalde Phrase, by the fear
of his Father Isaac, that is, as Onkelos paraphraseth it, by the God that Isaac
feared.

This fear of God is a fence for the keeping of all the Commandments. Deuteronomy.
4.10. I will cause them to hear my words that they may learn to fear me. So
Levit. 25.17. Ye shall not therefore oppress one another, but ye shall fear
the Lord. So verse. 36. Take no usurie of him or increase, but fear thy God. So
verse. 43. Thou shall not rule over him with rigor, but shall fear thy God. So
Levit. 19.32. Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of
the old man, and fear thy God. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the
Lord, and the end of all is to fear him. Eccles. 12, 13.

The Conclusion of this is, Seeing no flesh can be justified by keeping this
Law, to love the Lord with all our heart, strength and might, we must pray
with David, enter not into judgment with thy Servant: for in thy sight shall
no man living be justified Psalm. 143.2. And that he would accept of us in the
Court of new obedience, and not bring us into the Court of justice.

EXERCITAT. VII. Of the highest degree of man's love to God. Commandment I.
Romans 9.3. For I could wish that my self were accursed from Christ for my
brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh.
WE are bound to love God above all things, because he is the fountain of all
goodness, and next unto him we should love our own Salvation. Our temporary
life to be preferred to the life of our equal.


We are bound to love our temporary life better then out neighbors, provided
that he be our equal: but if he be our superior in the highest degree, as our
King, or the Commonwealth, The temporary life of our superior to be preferred
to our own.
then we are bound to give our temporary life, for their saftie: David's
subjects said to him, Thou art worth ten thousand of us, 2 Samuel 18. But for our
Spiritual life, Our own salvation to be preferred to the salvation of all men.
we are more bound to wish our own salvation, than the salvation of any other
whatsoever, yea than the salvation of the whole Church. Mat. 25.9. The wise
Virgins said, not so, lest there be not enough for us and for you.

We are bound to quit our temporary estate for the peace of the Church:
Gregorius Presbyter de vita Nazianzen.
Gregory Nazianzen gives us a good proof of this: for when there arose a
great contention in the Council of Constantinople about him, because he was
placed there, their suffrages not being asked: Nazianzen left his place
willingly, and said to the rest after this manner; I beseech you by the holy
Trinity, that ye would live peaceably together, and if I be any cause of the
dissension, I am no more worthy then the Prophet Jonas was, cast me into the
Sea, that this storm may cease; and I will most willingly suffer whatsoever ye
will do unto me (although I be innocent) for your peace sake; cast me out of
my place and banish me, only keep unity and peace amongst your selves.
Farewell holy Pastors, and remember my labors continually.

Secondly the good Pastor is bound to give his life for his sheep, Ioh. 10.17.
and Paul said he was ready to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus,
Act. 21.10.

Thirdly, We may desire the deferring of our glory for the good of the Church.
we may desire sometimes the deferring of our glory to come, for the good of
the Church. Philip. 1.23. For I am in a strait between two, having a desire
to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better; nevertheless to abide
in the flesh is more needful for you, but we must never desire, for the good
of the Church, to be deprived of eternal life.

But Paul wished to be deprived of eternal glory,

This was but a conditional wish, let this cup pass etc. And charitas
exuberans optat etiam Impossibilia, says Luther. When Paul wished that he
might be a curse for his brethren, it was voluntas conditionata, but when
Christ wished that this cup might pass, it was voluntas sub condition;
Voluntas Conditionata sub condition.

the matter may be cleared by this Example, a man has two servants, both their
wills are subordinat to their Masters will, but he injoyneth to one of them a
harder task then to the other; this man refuses not to do his Masters will,
but says unto him, if it be thy will, I will do this, although it be a hard
task, here his will is sub condition, as before it was voluntas conditionata,
a will ready to do his masters will: but this is a further degree, that he
will undergo this likewise, if his Master will bid him, The difference betwixt
Paul's wish and Christ's wish.
and this is the lowest degree of subjection. Paul's wish was voluntas
conditionata only, but Christ's wish was not only conditionata, but likewise
sub condition.

We are joined to God Similitudine naturae, vel communione faelicitatis.
Again we must observe that we are joined to God, either similitudine, natarae,
or communione faelicitatis. The first is broken off by the evil of sin, and
the second by the evil of punishment. Now if Paul should have wished to have
been removed from Christ, ratione similitudinis naturae, that had been a
sin in him; but he wished only to be separated from him communione
faelicitatis. Bernard said, it was better to be in hell and love God, than to
be in Heaven and sin. None that loves God can be in hell, nor none that
sins can be in heaven: We may will the greatest punishment rather than the
diminution of Gods glory.
for the midst and the end cannot be separat; yet this should be our
disposition, when we give a proof of our love to God, that we could wish in
sincerity the greatest punishment, rather then that Gods glory should be
diminished. Simile.
The Philosopher says, that natural things have two motions, the one ad sui
conservationem, the other ad conservationem universi; as water tends
downward by the proper motion of it, yet ad vitandum vacuum, to eschew
emptiness, which is repugnant to the nature of the whole, it will ascend: So
the Godly have the like inclination, one for their own particular good, and
the other for the good of the whole, The good of the Church to be preferred to
our temporary estate.
which is the glory of God; if we can redeem the good of the whole Church with
our greatest temporary misery, we are obliged to it.

Malum paenae but Malum Culpae: Malum Culpae Paenae:

for if he had been in that estate, he had been excluded from Heaven, and he
had been viator still, but if he had been in heaven he had been
Comprehensor; Man in this li^e is V^a^or, in heaven he shall be Comprehensor.
and they who are from home, traveling to their journies end, can never love
God so perfectly; as they who have attained to the mark already.

If ye will consider this petition by it self, Paul's wish considered simply in
it self was no sin.
if indeed he had been excluded from the Kingdom of heaven, then it had
been a sin for him to have wished it. One may wish a thing simply without
sin, Simile.
yet to wish it vestitum omnibus circumstantijs it may be sin. Example, a
woman has her husband to be executed for some capital offense, the woman
wished her husband to live, as her husband, and a Father to her Children to
provide for them; but if she should desire her husband to live as an Enemy to
the Commonwealth contrary to the Law, then her wish were a sinful wish: So
for Paul to wish this to testify his earnest love to the Church, it was no
sin; Paul's wish vestitum circumstantije was a sin.
but if he had wished it vestitum ominibus circumstantijs, with a diminution of
the love of God, and want of eternal happiness; then his wish had been sin.

Again we wish a thing antecedente voluntate vel consequente voluntate, with
an antecedent or consequent will. Example, a Judge by his antecedent will,
Voluntas antecedens subsequens.

wishes that all the subjects may live; but by his consequent will, he wishes
the malefactor to die. So Paul wished this by his antecedent will, but not
considering it with all the consequents that might follow upon it.

Fourthly, Paul wished not this absolutely, Paul's wish was not absolute but in
comparison.
but in comparison: as the natural Mother who pleaded before Solomon chose
rather, that the Child should be given to her who was not the Mother of it,
than that the Child should be cut in two, 1 King 3.26. If ye consider Paul's
wish here, it was only in comparison; rather then they should die, he wishes
this to himself.

But how wishes he to be accursed of God, be rased out of the book of life,
seeing it was a thing impossible?

Paul formally, he cannot be rased out of the book of life; Paul's wish
considered materially and formally.
but if ye will consider it materially, looking to Paul's affection at this
time, then he might have been rased out of the book of life. Consider
Christ's Petition, let this cup pass. In Gods eternal decree it was impossible
that it should pass, but consider again Christ's infirmity as he was a man,
these two might stand together, not to pass, and that it should pass: So
consider Gods eternal decree, Paul cannot be accursed, nor his name rased out
of the Book of Life: but consider again his love and affection toward his
brethren, he wished to be rased out of the book of Life. Love is like unto
the Ivy, which if if it cleave to a stone or an old Wall, it will rather die
than forsake it: So Paul being sick of love for the Churches cause, he would
rather suffer the most extreme punishments, then that the Church of the Jews
should perish.

A man cannot simply wish to be accursed for others.
A man may wish that which tends to his perfection, as to give his life for
his Country; this is a way to happiness, if he do it in faith, but if he
should seek simply to be accursed for others, this were to seek his own
destruction; and this he cannot do. Paul's wish was not an ordinary means of
the Jews salvation.


Paul's wish was not an ordinary mean here for the saving of the Jews, but his
earnest desire coming from his great love testified this, how earnestly he
desired their Salvation.

Paul teaches us, how much we should account of the salvation of the sons
of men.

Cor. 13.5.

Thirdly, it teaches us, that love is stronger then death Cant. 8.6.

Fourthly, it teaches us, how much we are indebted

The conclusion of this is,

EXERCITAT. VIII. Commandment, 1.
Luc. 16.13. Ye cannot love God and Mammon.
WHen we love any thing more than God, and set our affections upon it, then we
make a god of it. Three sort^ of men who have not God for their God.


There are three sorts of people especially who have another god for their god.
The first are (...) lovers of honor. The second are (...) lovers of money, and
of third are (...), lovers of Pleasures.

The first are (...) lovers of honor; man naturally seeks himself and his
own honor, and he forgets to give honor to God. John 7.18. He that
speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he that seeks his glory
that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

The highest degree of this Idolatry is when they affect that honor which
belongs only to God; A great ambition to affect the honor that is due to
God.
the ground of this affectation, is that poison which Satan dropped into the
ears of our first Parents in Paradise, when he said, Ye shall be as Gods,
Genesis 3.5. Therefore man affects the honor, that is due to God. Such was that
ambition of Herod, Act. 12.22. When he was delighted with that cry of the
people, The great ambition of Tyr^s.
The voice of God and not of man. Such was the ambition of Nabuchadnezzer,
Esaias. ^4.14. I will ascend above the height of the clouds, I will be like the
most high. Such was the ambition of the King of Tornes, Ezekiel. 28. First in
wisdom, he thought himself wiser than Daniel. verse. 3. Then he thought
himself to be the sum and perfection of all wisdom. Thirdly, he thought
that he exceeded the High Priest in all his ornaments, verse. 13. Fourthly he
thought himself to be above Adam when he was in Eden the Garden of God verse.
13. Fifthly above the Cherubims or Angels verse. 14. And last he said, he was God
himself, and sat in the seat of God. An^ such is the ambition of the Pope that
exalts himself above all that is called God. 2 Thessalonians. 1.4.



voluntas absoluta et efficax, Voluntas absoluta and efficax. conditionata and
inefficax.

et conditionata et inefficax: by the first they cannot desire to be like God;
but by the second they may desire to be like God. The will of man cannot
absolutely wish to be like God in all things, A creature cannot wish to be like
God in all things.
but it wishes to be like God in somethings, as Adam and Eve desired to be
like him in knowledge. Nabuchadnezzer desired to be like him in greatness.
Esaias. 14.14. Simon Magus desired to be like him in power, in working of
miracles, therefore they called him the great power of God, Act. 8.10. and
Herod desir^d to be worshipped like God Act. 12.22. But absolutely no creature
can desire to be like God.

The second sort, are (...), lovers of money, covetousness is Idolatry, Ephesians.
5.5.

There is a great resemblance betwixt the Idolatry of the first Commandment,
Great affinity betwixt Idolatry of the first Commandment and Idolatry of the
second Commandment.
and the Idolatry of the second Commandment; betwixt a covetous wretch setting
his heart upon his money, and an Idolater, bowing before his Image. The Lord
showed to Ezekiel in a vision. Cap. 8. the vile abominations that were
committed within the Temple, and what they were doing in the Chambers of their
Imagerie. Some were worshipping creeping things; Some with their Censers in
their hands making the smoke to go up before their Images, and some weeping
before the filthy Idol Tammuz. So if the Lord would lead us in the Spirit, and
let us see (as he did Ezekiel) what our several affections were doing within
us; we should see a thousand times greater Idolatry, than ever Ezekiel saw in
the Temple. Here we should see some sacrificeing to their own net, Greater
Idolatry now than in the days of Ezekiel.
Habak. 1.16. ascribing all things to their own wit and policy. We shall see
others sacrificing to Tammuz or Ball Peor, to their filthy lust, and as, Iere.
7.18. The Children gathered the Wood, the Fathers kindled the fire, and the
Women kneaded their dough to make Cakes to the Queen of Heaven; so when we
look into our hearts we shall see our affections busy to give some sort of
service to this Idol or that, and to none more readily, then to Baal-mammon.

When Nabuchadnezzar set up a golden Image to be worshipped, all the People
fell down and worshipped it, but the three children who refused to worship it
were cast into the fiery furnace, yet the Angel of the Lord was with them in
the midst of the fiery furnace, and they found the most comfortable presence of
God with them, because they would not fall down before that Idol: So says
Chrysostom, Chrysostom. Hom. 18. in Cap. 5. ad Ephesians.
covetous and avaritious wretches fall down before their money, but the
children of God refuse with the three Children to fall down before that god of
thick clay which is Gold, (...) Aurum est densum lutum.
gnabh tit, densum lutum, Habak. 2.7. And therefore God is with them in all
their necessities, and provideth for them. And as the Idolater has a sacrifice
which he offers to his Idol: So, The sacrifice of the covetous man to his
Idol.
says Chrysostom, has the avaritious man his sacrifice which he offers to
his Idol, but what sacrifice has he, Even those whom he defraudeth, and
makes a sacrifice of them to his Idol: again, he makes a sacrifice of the
poor to whom he denies maintenance. And last, the wretch offers himself,
because he defraudeth his own soul of the use of his riches. And as the
Idolater devoutly beholds his Idol, and dare scarcely touch it: so the
covetous wretch dare scarcely be bold to touch his money, and his heart is
oftener with his money, The covetous man is married to his gold.
then the Idolaters heart is with his Idol. Job purged himself of this
Idolatry. If I have made Gold mine hope, or fine Gold my Confidence, Job.
31.34. The Seventy read it, si posui aurum in conjugium meum, and it
signifies the great love which the covetous man has to his riches.

The third sort, are, (...) lovers of pleasures. John reduces all these sorts
of pleasures to three, either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes or
the pride of life, 1 Ioh. 2.16. first the lust of the flesh, by this is meant
all internal pleasures wherein the flesh delights, as drunkenness gluttony,
whoredom, such make a god of their belly: the very panch, which is the basest
part in man, is made a god by them, they sacrifice not to the wit their more
excellent part, The belly is a base god.
but all their care is for the belly. Clemens Alexandrinus writes of a fish
which he calls (...) which has not a heart distinguished from the belly, as
other fishes have, but it has the heart in the belly: So these gluttons which
make a god of their belly, have their heart in their belly.

The second sort of pleasures, is the lust of the eyes. The lust of the eyes
what.
Eccles. 2.10. Whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
not mine heart from any Joy. He studied to satisfy all his senses, Salomen
satisfied all his senses with pleasures.
his ear with music. I got me men singers and women singers, and the
delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts,
verse. 8. His eye with great buildings, gardens and Orchards verse. 4.5. His
taste, I sought in mine heart to give my self unto Wine, verse. 3. this is, to
live in pleasure, and such are dead while they live. 1 Timothy 5.6. such were
Tyrus and Sydon, and those of Phoenicia, they were called Phoenicians from the
Syriacke word Phinnek delicatus, and (...) delicait, (...) delicate educavit.
because they spent their time in pleasure. Christ pronounces a woe against
such, Woe be to you that laugh, Luc. 6.25. That is, that spend your time in
mirth and pleasure.

The third sort of pleasure, is the Pride of life, which puffs up men that
they know not themselves. David says of these, that Pride compasses them
about as a chain: and violence covers them as a garment. Psalm. 73.6.

The Conclusion of this is; The Lord in the Creation made a threefold
subordination, first that man should be subordinat and subject to God, to
honor and reverence him. Secondly, that the sensual appetite should be
subordinat to the reasonable faculty. Thirdly, that things below here should
be subject both to the reasonable faculty and sensual appetite, but when a
man loves any thing better than God, then all these three subordinations are
broken: for when he affects divine honor, making a god of himself; then
the first subordination is broken* when he sets his heart on his pleasures,
and makes a God of them, as the rich glutton who had his pleasures and good
things in things in this life, L^^. 16. Then the second subordination is
broken. And thirdly, when he sets his heart on his money, to make a God of
it, and to serve it. As the rich man in the Gospel, Luc. 12.13. Then the third
subordination is broken. Whereas it should serve him he, becomes a slave to
it: the heathen could say, mihi res, non me rebus submittere conor.

Commandment II.
EXERCITAT. I. Of Idolatry in general.
Exodus 20.5. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image etc.
THere are two things forbidden in this Commandment: first to make an Image
for a religious worship, and secondly to worship it.

Some condemn the act of painting and carving, as the Jews do, The lawful
use of painting.
who will not suffer a painter to dwell amongst them. But this gift of it
self, is the gift of God, as may be seen in Aholiab and Bezaliel whom the
Lord endued with this skill. Exodus 31.3. Secondly some will not allow the
historical use of them in houses, or upon the Princes Coin for distinctions
sake, but this is lawful, and Christ himself allows it. Mat. 22.20. But
some go further and allow them, What use of painting unlawful.
not only for ornaments in private houses, but also in Churches, as the
Lutherans do. Fourthly, some allow them for excitation, to move them to
worship: and lastly, some allow them for adoration. These are not Lawful.

Thou shall not make to thy self etc. There is a difference betwixt him that
makes the I^^^, and him that prays to it when it is made; the one is the
material Idolater, the other is the formal Idolater. The artificer makes
only the Image, but he who prays before it and adoreth it, makes a god of
it. The Children of Israel cried unto Aaron, make us gods to go before us,
Exodus 32.1. It was Aaron that made the Calfe, but the people made the Calfe a
god. If a man had come into the shop of Demetrius the silver smith, and had
asked him, what he was doing? and he should have answered, I am making gods;
he should not have answered rightly here: for it was he that bowed before the
Idol, and prayed before it, that made a god of it, Psalm. 115.8. They that make
them are like unto them: so are all they that put their trust in them. This is
the special sort of making of gods, when men trust in them and adore them: The
Poet Martial says, Qui fingit sacros, auro vel marmore vultus,
Non facit ille Deos; qui rogat, iste facit.


Thou shall not bow down to them etc. There are two things forbidden here,
Nihil dandum idolo, nec accipiendum ab Idolo: Nothing must be given to the
Idol, nor nothing taken from the Idol. We must give nothing to the Idol, as
reverence or maintenance. No worship to be given to an Idol.


First we must do no homage or reverence to the Idol. (...) genuaflexit.
(...) dimissio capitis cum superiore corpore. (...) verticen^ inclinare. (...)
totum corpus prosternere.
The Hebrews have four words, to note the four several gestures of the
body, the first is Barach, The bowing of the knee, 2 Chr. 6.13. The second is
Carang, which signifies the bowing of the head, with the bulk of the body,
Psalm. 95.6. The third is Kadad, the bowing of the head, the fourth is
Hishtahhavah, The prostrating of the whole body upon the ground. So he
forbids to lift ^^e eyes to an Idol, Ier. 18.6. So to kiss the Idol, 1
King 19.18. I have reserved ten thousand whose mouth have not kissed Baal.
Cicero makes mention of the Image of Hercules, (...) quando absolute ponitur
significat osculari.
cujus mentum osculis adorantium attritum fuit. And when they could not reach
to the Idol to kiss it, they kissed their hand in token of homage which they
did to their Idol. Contrary to this sort of worship is the kissing of the
Son Jesus Christ, Psalm. 2.12. This osculum homagij, is due only to Christ.

Secondly, Nothing to be given to the maintenance of an Idol.
we must give nothing to an Idol for the maintenance of the service of it, as
the Israelites took their eare-rings and Jewels to make the golden calfe. So
we must not plant groves to it, Deuteronomy. 16.22. Psalm. 137.2. We hanged our harpes
upon the willowes, when they desired us to play to their gods; we hung up our
harpes upon the Willowes, that is, upon the groves consecrat to Belus or Bell,
and we said, it were better that our tongues should cleave to the roof of our
mouth, than that we should forget the worship of the true God at Jerusalem; so
to erect any title or inscription in honor of them, Levit. 26.1.

So to institute a Priesthood to serve these Idols, Nuplere manum quid Hebreyes.
Iud. 17.12. As Micah consecrated a Levite, in the original it is Implevit
Micah manum Levitae, where this Idolater imitated the form of consecration of
the Lords Priests, Exodus 29.31. 2 Chro. 13.3. Omnis veniens ad implendam manum
suam, that is, to be ordained: When the Priest was consecrat to the Lord, the
Ram which was to be offered, was called Aries impletionis Exodus 29.31.
Because the hand of the Priest was filled with it when he was ordained. These
Idolatrous Priests, 2 King. 23. are called Kemarim, as ye would say, black,
(...) denigrare.
because they were smoked with the smoke of the sacrifices.

The Priests stood barefoot before the Lord when they served.
So to stand barefooted before the Idol which the heathen called Nudipedalia,
they borrowed this custom from the Priests of the Lord, who stood barefooted
before the Lord when they served,

All these sorts of external worship given to Idols the Jews called Gnabhuda
Zara, and it consisted in four things, (...) Cultus alienus (...) altar (...)
fuffitus (...) incurvatio (...) libatio How adoration differs from prayer.
first Altar, secondly Suffitus, thirdly, Incurvatio, and fourthly Libatio.

Adoration consists in the inward adoration of the heart, and outward gesture
of the body; and it differs from Prayer, which may be performed by the
inward act of the mind sometimes, without any outward gesture of the body.
Adoration is an act of religious worship.


This Adoration is an act of religion, properly to be performed to God only,
as the object of it; for it arises of an apprehension of the excellence of God
above all things created, and it is Idolatry when this worship is given to any
creature either directly or indirectly.

Spiritual and civil worship are distinguished by the end and intention of
the worshipper.
Spiritual Adoration and civil adoration are distinguished by the end, and the
intention of the worshipper only distinguishes them. There is no outward
worship which is done to God but it may be done to men, except only sacrifice
which is due to God only, Exodus 22. Otherwise the intention of these who
worship, and the end wherefore they worship, distinguishes them. When the
mother of the sons of Zebedeus came to Christ and bowed to him, Mat. 20.20.
desiring that one of her sons might sit at his right hand, and the other at
his left hand, this was but civil adoration which she gave to him; because it
was but a civil thing which she required of him, taking him to be a temporal
King: but when a Catholic comes and boweth before the Pope, he gives him
more then civil honor, he gives him divine honor; why? because he takes
him to be one that cannot err in his calling, and who is Christ's vicar upon
earth here: So he gives him in effect that which is due to Christ, and that
he has that same power to forgive sins which Christ has.

There is Totum potestativum and Totum contractum; Totum Potestat^vum.
Contractum.

Totum potestativum is the power of ruling and governing in a King; Totum
contractum is the same power contracted in an inferior magistrate; as in a
Major or Provest, Christ has Totum potestativum, absolute power to remit
sins, but his ministers have not Totum contractum, as inferior magistrates
have the power of the King, Ministers have not totum contractum but they are as
heralds to pronounce remission of sins.
they are only but Heralds to make intimation of the remission of sins: the
inferior magistrate may urge obedience to himself, because he has. Totum
potestativum contractum in himself; but no man has Totum potestativum
contractum within himself to remit sins. When they bow before the Pope, they
hold that he has not only potestatem contractam to remit sins, but
potestatem excellentiae, and that it differs only in degree from Christ's
power, whereas the Minister in remission of sins, has not this power (...)
sed tantum (...), and he does nothing in absolution but disposes only the
penitent, potestas (...). (...).

and by the word and probable signs absolueth him: this absolution is not a
proper act of forgiveness of sin, as if it had a direct, necessary and
physical influence in forgiveness of sin: but he is only Causa moralis,
seu concilians, whereupon God is moved to pardon the penitent when he sees him
humbled. But they ascribe to the pope the same power which is in Christ to
forgive sins, although not in the same degree: therefore when they bow before
the pope it is idolatrous worship, and as the people called Simon Magus the
great power of God. Act. 8.10. so do they the pope.

The intention of the worshiper makes not that civil worship which was first
instituted to be spiritual.
The intention of the worshiper makes not that civil worship which was first
instituted to be spiritual worship. Example, If a man should stand before an
idol, and feign himself to bow before it, for the loosing of the lachet of
his shoe, this were idolatry; why? because bowing before an idol was
instituted for the honor of the idol: and here we must distinguish inter
finem operis, Finis Oteris. Operantis.

and finem operantis, and the action is to be judged a fine operis and non
operantis.

bow down the head like a bull-rush and to spread sackcloath and ashes under
them. Esaias 58.5. this did not please the Lord: and when the Lord wills us to
keep our foot when we go into the house of God, Eccles. 5.1. It is meant of
the affections, and not of the foot of the body.

finis operis, and not operantis which distinguishes the action, therefore
these turne-coats, and time servers, who have a knee ready for every
idolatrous service, their intentions will not excuse them from idolatry,
because the chief thing which is intended there is idolatry.

EXERCITAT. II. No spiritual worship is due to any creature invisible.
Commandment II.
Exodus 20.4. Or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is
in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
GOd knowing the wandering heart of man how prone it is to idolatry, and to go
a whoring after other Gods, first he forbids them to worship any thing in
heaven, secondly in the earth, thirdly in water under the earth. He forbids
them to worship these visible creatures; but there is more comprehended here:
God said, in the creation, that he created heaven and earth. Genesis 1.1. But the
Apostle expresses it more largely. Coloss. 1.16. For by him were created all
things that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible. So
should this be resolved here more largely, as to things invisible now in the
heavens, and to the devils who are cast out of the heavens, and appear to men
in visible shapes.

Things in heaven which are not to be worshipped: as first, the humanity of
Christ; Christ God and man is the object of our worship, but not Christ in his
manhead. John 5.23. Christ God and man is the object of our worship.
He that honors not the son, honors not the father. To. 14.11. All
knees shall bow to me. John 20.28. Thomas said, My Lord, and my God; yet the
man Christ was to be worshipped when he was lying in the grave: because the
hypostaticall union was not separated by death; but the humanity by it self is
not to be worshipped* for Christ as man he worshipped. Ioh. 4.22. We know what we
worship. The humani^y of Christ by it self is not to worshipped. Nicen. epist.
7. ad Constant.
Secondly, Cursed is he that puts his trust in man. Ier. 17.5. But the
humane nature of Christ considered by it self, is a man, and therefore not to
be worshipped. And the council of Nice accursed Nestorius, and condemned him as
an idolater, because he did hold that Christ the son of God was but a mere
man, and yet was to be worshipped; Cyrill calls this (...): it is true, we
worship Christ's manhood with his Godhead associative, but we worship not his
Godhead and his ma^hood copulative; we worship the king with his crown
associative, but we worship not the king and the crown copulative; Adorati^
Associativa. Copulat^va.

and we worship not the humanity of Christ for it self, but because it is
hypostatically united to the Godhead, and so it is worshipped (...). If we
should worship the humanity of Christ with civil honor, To worship the godhead
of Christ with civil honor is blasphemy.
as it is hypostatically united to the Godhead, then we should worship the
Godhead but with civil honor, which were blasphemy; for spiritual honor is
only due to the Godhead, and the worship which is due to one of the persons in
the hypostaticall union, is due also to the other: therefore it is not civil
honor which is given to the humanity of Christ, as it is united
hypostatically with the Godhead; and seeing adoration respects totum
suppositum, Adoration looks t^ the greatest excellency in the person.
the whole person; it looks always to the greatest excellency in the
person, for otherwise if we should worship a person, and not look to his
chiefest excellency, it were no less then to profess that there were no
greater excellency in him. Example, Simile.
If a King were both a Duke, a Marquess, and an Earl, and if one should give
him the honor only which is due to an Earl, this were in effect to degrade
him of his kingly honor: so to consider Christ as God and man, and yet to give
him only but civil honor, this were to degrade him of his greatest honor:
To conclude this with Athanasius, Nec Verbum sine Carne, nec Caro sine Verbo
adorari potest; Neither the Godhead of Christ without the manhood, nor the
manhood without the Godhead are to be worshipped. Ob.
but so that the reason and cause of the adoration is still in the deity; and
the humanity is adored because it is hypostatically joined to the deity.

A distinct excellency stirs up a distinct affection and motion in the
mind, but the excellency of the humanity is a distinct excellency:
therefore it should stir up a distinct adoration.

A distinct excellency in distinct persons should have a distinct adoration; A
distinct excellence in diverse persons stirs up a distinct reverence and
affection:
as a King should be otherwise worshipped then a Baron: but when they concur
in one person, then there should not be a distinct adoration: here we give one
sort of adoration to the whole, to both the natures of Christ in one person.

Angels who are in heaven are not to be worshipped. Angels not to be worshipped.
Coloss. 2.18. Let no man beguile you of your reward involuntary humility and
worshipping of angels, intruding himself in those things which he has not
seen, vainly puffed up in his fleshly mind, and not holding the head. Where
the Apostle reasons this ways, every one who is subject and subordinate, as
the members are to the head, should not have that honor which is due to the
head. But the angels are subject to the head; therefore they should not have
that which is due to Christ the head: Let us pray to our father, and he can
send legions of angels to defend us. Matt. 26.23.

There are two sorts of worship, cultus religionis, Cultu^ Religionis
Societatis.

and cultus societatis; cultus societatis belongs to all those who are of one
society, the angels are our fellow servants. Revel. 22.9. Therefore this
worship which is done to them, is done to them as our fellow servants.

This civil worship which is performed by men, is either as they are politici
in civitate mundi, or ecclesiastici in ecclesia D^i; that is, as they are
civil men dwelling upon the earth, and gathered within the church and made
members of her; as they are members of the church again, either they are
members of the Church triumphant, or militant: the angels now are of the Church
triumphant, conciues triumphantes: therefore they have not of us cultum
societatis now, and when they appeared of old to the Patriarchs they were
worshipped only with civil worship,

Whether is it a diverse sort of worship which is given to an angel and to a
king? it might seem to be a diverse kind of worship, because the excellency
is diverse, the king being civil, and the angel spiritual.

Adoration given to an angel and to a king differ in degree only.
non differunt specie, but gradu: for to make it civil worship, it is
sufficient that it be a creature to whom it is given; but if we will respect
the degree, there may be greater or lesser worship given; greater to the
angels, and lesser to the king.

The souls departed are not to be worshipped.
In heaven there are also the souls of the blessed departed, and them we may
not worship: for they understand not what we are doing upon the earth. When
Elias was to be taken up to heaven, The Jews say of the dead, gnalau hashalem,
which they contract thus (...) on him is peace, and not on him be peace.
he said to Elisha, ask of me what I shall do for thee before I go hence.
2. Kings 2.9. whereby he employed that there was no place to ask him after he
was gone. And if the Saints on earth refused this spiritual worship offered to
them, as Paul and Barnabas Act. 14.15. much more will they refuse it in heaven,
Psalm. 115.1. Revel. 5.13.
they will say, not unto us, not unto us, they cast down their crowns before
him that sits upon the throne, and give him all the honor.

Of old there were Idolaters called Collyridani, of whom Epiphanius makes
mention, who baked cakes, The Church of Rome make an idol of the virgin Mary.
and offered them to the virgin Mary, this was idolatrous worship offered to
her. So when the Church of Rome take the fine flower and the incense of prayer,
and offer to the virgin Mary, they commit idolatry and make an idol of her.

The conclusion of this is, commandments, promises and practices are our
warrant to worship the Lord only, and to call upon him in our necessity. Psalm.
50.15. call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shall
glorify me.

EXERCITAT. III. No visible things in the heavens, or in the earth to be
worshipped. Commandment II.
Exodus 20.4. Or the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or etc.
AS before the Lord discharged things invisible in the heavens to be worshipped;
so now he discharges all things visible, seen with the eye, whether devils
appearing in a visible form, or the sun, moon and stars, or any creature
in the earth, or in the water under the earth.

First, he forbids to worship the infernal spirits, the devils, (...);
when the devil appears in any visible shape to call upon him, or to
sacrifice to him; such was the worship which they gave him in the Teraphim. The
Teraphim what?
Elias in tishbi shows how they made this Teraphim, they took a child who
was the first borne, wrung off his neck, and embalmed his head with spices; How
the Teraphim gave the answers.
and they wrote in a plate of gold, the name of the spirit whom they called
upon, and they put it under this head, and then the spirit gave the answers.
Laban called this Teraphim, (...)
his God; therefore he says, nehhashti, auguratus sum, I divined by my God
that the Lord has blessed me for thy sake. Genesis 30.27.

(...)
They had their Teraphim likewise in the likeness of a whole man. 1. Sam. 19.13.

Secondly, they worshipped the devil in the form of a goat, They shall no
more offer their sacrifice to the hairie ones, (...)
leshegnirim, that is, to the devils who appeared in the form of satyrs and
goats. Levit. 17.7.

Thirdly they worshipped him in the form of a fly. Baalzebub was the God of
the Ekronites, and Ahazia sent to get a response of him, whether he should live
or not. 2. Kings 1.2.

In all idolatry the dedivill is worshipped:
There is no sort of idolatry in which the devil is not worshipped. Psalm.
106.37. Yea they sacrificed their sons and daughters to devils. so 1. Cor.
10. The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not
to God; and I would not that you should have any fellowship with devils. Ye
cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils. Those idolaters made
not a direct covenant with the devil as the former did, nor they consulted not
with him directly as they did.

The Sun is not to be worshipped.
Now let us come to visible things, which they were forbidden to worship, and
first the sun, the moon and the stars, and things in the heavens.

How they came to worship the planets.
Men studied first the course of the stars, and that bred astronomy; then
they observed the influence of the planets, and that bred physic; then they
foretold things by the stars, and that bred judicial astrology: and last
they worshipped the planets, and that bred idolatry. Of all the planets, they
chiefly worshipped the sun. The Amonites worshipped the sun.
The Ammonites called the sun moloch, and their God Moloch, and they burnt
their children to this God, a most unnatural sin; they spared the Canaanites
whom God commanded them to destroy, Diverse nations had the sun for their god.
and spared not their children, the fruit of their own loins: the Lord
commanded to offer the first borne to him, and they offered their first borne
to Moloch.

They had horses for the sun, and chariots for it, Subdiales Statua.
which carried about the image of the sun 2. Kings 13.11. and some worshipped
the fire, symbolum solis; as the Chaldeans: and the Sydonians called the sun
Heliogabalus, deus fingens, vel formans; (...) Deuteronomy omnia fingens. (...) Omnia
videns.
because the sun fashioneth all things; and the Israelites worshipped this god.

The Tyrians called the sun Hercules; haar col, omnia videns; and Hercules
twelve labors in their Mythologie, signify the sun passing through the
twelve, signs in the Zodiac.

So the Egyptians worshipped the sun, and they called him Jupiter Hammon,
omnia califaciens, so they called the sun Adon, dominus, they saluted the Sun
(...), The Jews learned from the heathen to worship the sun.
and from Adon they made Adonis, and they took their fable of loosing and
finding of Adonis, from the setting and rising of the sun, and the Jews
learned from these nations, to worship the sun, the moon and host of heaven.

Seeing the sun is the chief of all the planets; the queen of heaven? Ier.
7.8. and 44.19. When we burnt incense to the queen of heaven.

It should not be translated, What is meant by the queen of heaven.
When we burnt incense to the queen of heaven; the seventie translate it
better, (...), the host of heaven* the difference of the interpretation arose
of this, because the hebrew word malcah written with He, signifies a queen,
and with aleph it signifies a work. Again, amongst the Latins Luna is in
the feminine gender, (...) Regina (...) opus.
and Sol is in the masculine gender: but with the Hebrews shemesh the sun is
in the feminine gender, and jareah the moon is in the masculine gender:
therefore according to their genders, it maybe said Deus lunus, and Sol regina.

Many become foolish in their worship. Simile.
It is strange to se, how people have been so foolish, to forget the creator,
and to give all praise to the creature; they are not unfitly compared to
country people, who have never been at the court: when they come first to
court, the first men that they see clothed in fine apparel, they take him to
be the King, and they fall down and worship him: so the heathen when they saw
some beauty in the sun, they gave it that honor which was due to God. (...)
Sol a (...) Ministrare
shemesh the sun, comes from the word shamash ministrare, because it is
appointed to serve men; why then should man fall down and serve it?

They worsh^ped the moon as a goddess.
Secondly, they worshipped the moon in the heaven, and Job purges himself of
this idolatry, Job. 31.27. or my mouth had kissed mine hand, when I beheld the
sun when it shined, or the moon walking in her brightness: the idolaters when
they could not reach to the moon to kiss her, they kissed their hands in
token of homage, Some wor^^iped the stars and planets.
and this was called adorare, quasi applicare manum ad os.

Thirdly they worshipped the stars or mazoloth the planets, 2. King. 23.5. And
he put down also them that burnt incense unto Baal, to the sun, to the moon
and Lemazaloth, to the planets. Genesis 30.11. and Leah said, a troop comes,
(...) Lea and Rachel kept somer ^^u^s of their fathers idolatry.
and she called his name Gad. Bagad read in two words signifies bonam
fortunam: Gad was the host of heaven to which they sacrificed, and gave divine
honor, Esaias. 65.11. and they called it Masal tobh, bona fortuna; Leah ascribed
this good fortune to the influence of the stars: neither of Jacobs wives were
purged from their fathers idolatry, Rachel stole her fathers Teraphim, and
Leah ascribed all to good fortune, and the influence of the stars.

In earth they worshipped beasts, the Israelites worship^d the golden calfe in
the wilderness, this calfe they set up as a representation of God, Why the
Israelites set up the golden calfe.
who fed them in the wilderness, and provided for them; the ox was always
holden a sign of plenty, The ox was a sign of plenty.
therefore Solomon says, where the ox is wanting the crib is empty* Prove.
14.4. and Joseph because he provided for the people of God in their necessity,
he is called bos dei, Deuteronomy. 33.17. and the Romans set up a golden ox to
Minutius; because he provided for them in the famine. So they dedicated this
calfe to the Lord, because he provided for them in the wilderness.

The Lord forbids them to make the likeness of male or female to worship
it, Deuteronomy. 4.16. for they worshipped both bull calves, and cow calves, they had
both gneglim and gnegloth Hosea 10.15. (...) The apostle in disdain puts
Baal in the feminine gender.
and the Apostle Romans 17.4. puts the name Baal in the feminine gender,
(...), and (...) should be understood. Tobit. 1.5. all the tribes made
defection sacrificing (...) to the cow Baal, (...) should not be understood
here, for what strength is there in an idol to help?

God made man lord over all his creatures, as neat and sheep, and all beasts
of the field, Psalm. 8.7. and yet man forgets this, and worshipeth the very
basest of them.

Lastly, in the water under the earth. The Egyptians worshipped Nilus as a god,
and the fishes in it. So the Philistims worshipped Dagon, The heathen worshipped
the water as a god.
which was half a fish and half a man in shape, therefore the Lord forbideth
the people to learn at these heathen nations to worship things in the water
under the earth.

The conclusion of this is, let us say with David, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none upon the earth that I desire besides thee. Psalm. 73.25.

EXERCITAT. IV. No image can be made to represent God. Commandment II.
Esaias. 40.25. To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal, says the
holy One?
THe Church of Rome say, for representation the image of God cannot be painted
to express lively and fully the nature of God: and in this sense they say,
that God forbideth any image of him to be made, seeing he has no form whereby
he can be expressed. Esaias 40.18. To whom will ye liken God, or what likeness
will ye compare unto him? But to express him by some bodily shape as he
appeared here, that is no idolatry, as he appeared to Daniel in the likeness
of an old man, and the holy ghost appeared in the likeness of a done. Matt.
3.16. When he is painted to teach the histories of the scripture, that so by
sensible figures our minds may ascend to take up the invisible God; to paint
him this way is not a sin; angels themselves are immateriall spirits, yet
they were painted under the law, and represented by cherubins; why then may not
God be represented by an image? There is a great difference betwixt the angels
and God. No proportion betwixt God and an image.
First they are finite, and therefore there may be some proportion betwixt them
and an image; but God is infinite, and an image finite; therefore no proportion
betwixt them.

Imago Personae. Representationis officii.

Secondly, there is imago personae, and imago representationis officij, the
cherubins were no representation of the persons of the angels; for they being
immateriall, cannot be expressed by any material things, and if we should
conceive an angel to have any quantity by an image, then the image should
teach us a lie: An image may represent the office of angels but not their
persons.
the cherubins then are only representations of the office of the angels, that
they were ministering spirits attending the elect; and they were painted this
way, that the Jews might read (as it were) in a history, what the angels did
to them who wait upon the Church continually.

But members are attributed to God in the scripture:

Members are attribute to God metaphorice, Members attributed to God
metaphorically not typically.
but not typice, metaphora est in verbis, typus in rebus, the scripture sets
him down with ears, hands, and feet by words borrowed from men, but it never
sets him down by any bodily shape painted before us, but always forbids
us to represent him by any bodily shape; and there is no danger to the people
by idolatry, when he is represented to the ear by metaphorical words, but
great danger to them when he is represented to the eye by visible shapes.

How shall we conceive of God then,

We must conceive him to be a spirit, most just, How we must conceive God.
most holy, and infinite; but because the infinite Godhead is but finitely
comprehended by us; therefore we should set the eyes of our faith upon the
manhood of Christ; Simile.
for he that sees the son sees the father. When a man looks into a
crystal glass, it casts no reflexe to him; but put steel upon the back
of it, it will cast a reflexe: so when we look upon the Godhead it self, it
casts no comfortable reflexe unto us, but put the humanity, as it were a
back of steel to that glass, then it casts a reflexe to us.

Now let us speak of the worship it self. The Church of Rome being charged
with idolatry, and worshipping of idols, they wipe their mouth with the whore,
and say they did it not, Prove. 30.20. And they go about by sundry shifts to
clear themselves of this idolatry.

Adoratio Absoluta. Respectiva.

There is a double sort of worship, the first is called adoratio respectiva, the
second is called adoratio absoluta. Absolute adoration is this, when the
worship is termed in the creature, as objectum quod adorationis, and the
worship is limitated to the creature. Respective adoration is this, when
worship is given to dead and senseless creatures for the examplars sake,
Obiectum Quod. Quo.

then the exemplar is obiectum quo, and the dead and senseless thing is
obiectum quod; that is, we reverence and adore the dead and senseless thing
for the examplars sake. Simile.
Example, when we attend the coffin, the corpse being buried already, the
coffin is obiectum quod which we attend, and the corpse are obiectum quo which
moves us to attend the coffin: so when we do homage to the Viceroy for the
King; the Viceroy here is obiectum quod, and the King is obiectum quo. The more
modest of the papists of old made but the image obiectum quod adorationis, and
God himself obiectum quo.

Adoratio Respectiva. Coniuncta.

Again they say, that there is adoratio coniuncta, or coadoratio, and there is
adoratio respectiva: coadoratio or coniuncta adoratio, they make to be this;
when both the exemplar, and the thing represented by the exemplar are worshipped
coniunctim, as obiectum quod adaequatum, this sort of worship they gave not to
the image at the first, but only respectivam adorationem.

Imago consideratur. Secundum rem naturae. Formaliter.

Thirdly, they say that an image is considered secundum rem naturae, and so it
is not worshipped. Secondly formaliter and in actu exerci^^^, as it holds
forth the exemplar to us, and so it is ^^rminus formalis adorationis, and then
the cause of the adoration is in the exemplar, which both moves the adoration
and determines it; and the image is but a condition of the adoration, and the
adoration is not given to it, but to him who is the cause of the adoration, as
Caietan says. Many papists now hold they are not only accidentally to be
worshipped but properly.
But now they go farther and maintain that images are not only to be
worshipped accidentally or improperly; but also by themselves, and properly, so
that they end and terminate the worship, as they are considered in themselves;
and not only as they are portraitures of the exemplar represented: and some of
them say yet more plainly, that it is the self same worship, that is due to
God, and to the image; and that it is coadoratio or coniuncta adoratio,
Gregorius de Valentia disput. 6. quest. 11. punct. 6.
and eodem officio, and honoris genere, eodem animi motu, and eade^ voluntate
excitandi opinione^ excellentiae, ille cultus ad prototypon spectat secundum
se, ad imaginem vero coram ipsa, and in ipsa tanquam vicaria; they clearly
confess, that it is the same worship that is due to God and to the image: and
as the Echo est individuum cum suo sono; so it is one sort of worship which is
given both to the image and to God: and Vasques implies, Vasq. lib. 3. de
ador. disput. 1. cap. 5.
that in some case the devil may be worshipped appearing in some visible shape.
When Darius mother Sysigambis came before Alexander the great, (mistaking
Ephestion for Alexander) she fell down before Ephestion, but knowing that she
was mistaken, she began to blush: But Alexander said unto her, be not ashamed,
non errasti matter, nam Ephestion est etiam Alexander. If a papist falling down
before his image and mistaking the image for Christ, and if Christ should say
to him be not ashamed, thou art not mistaken, for this image is also Christ:
then he needed not to blush nor be ashamed: but Christ is more jealous of his
honor than so, and will not give it to any creature.

The conclusion of this is, 1. Ioh. 5.2. little children, Conclusione.
beware of idols, Micha's idol bewitched the whole tribe of Dan. Judge. 18.36.

EXERCITAT. V. That idolatry is most opposite to God. Commandment II.
2. Cor. 6.14. What communion has light with darkness? 16. and what agreement
has the temple of God with idols?
Idolatry is a sin that is first most opposite to God himself, and secondly
it is opposite to his marriage with his Church.

(...) Qui habet vitam in se and a se.
First, it is most opposite to God himself, God is ens entium, and therefore he
is vnus, verus, and bonus.

First, God is ens entium, who has his being of himself, and hereby ye shall
know that Chai, the living Lord is amongst you. Josh. 3.10. this title
distinguishes him from dead idols which have neither life in themselves, nor
can give life to others. Psalm. 106.26. And they joined to Baal-phegor, and eat
the sacrifices of the dead, that is, the gods who are dead; they are called
dumb idols, Haback. 2.18. (...)
So Psalm. 115. they have mouths but they speak not, (...)
the idols are called elilim, nihilitates. Esaias. 2.8. Ezekiel. 30.13. and Tohu,
The idols are called dead gods.
emptiness. 1. Sam. 12.21. things are true as long as they agree with the
pattern which is in the mind of God, but when they go from that once, they
are reckoned for shadows of things only. Prove. 20.6. Who shall find a
faithful man? as if he shoud say, it is easy to find shadows of men, but it
is a hard thing to find a man indeed who is answerable to the mind of God.
Idolaters, because they go from this pattern, People following other gods
become no people.
they are called non gens. Hos. 10.9. and non populus, not a people. 1. Pet.
2.10. and the apostle says, an idol is nothing. 1. Cor. 8.4. it is not nihil
negativum, but nihil privativum, Nihil negativum. privativum. effectivum.

there is no relation betwixt God and it, or it is nihil affectivum.

The first attribute of God who is Ens entium, Omne ens est unum numero and
specie, sed Deus unum eminenter.
is unit as and therefore the scripture by way of excellence calls him vnus,
Job. 31.15. (...) Vnus.
Did not one fashion us in the womb, that is, God, so Zach. 14.9. In that day
there shall be one Lord, and his name vnus, this name Ehhad, (...)
afterward the heathen called it Adad, corruptly, Deuteronomy. 6.4. (...)
Hearken Israel, the Lord thy God is one, and it is written with a great Daleth
which letter signifies four, as the Hebrews mark, to signify the four
corners of the earth, and that he should be worshipped in them, and none else
but he; although there be many that are called gods, yet to us there is but
one God. 1. Cor. 8.6.

The gods of the heathen were many; they had thirty thousand gods, as Hes^^d
witnesses. And Augustine observes well in his book de civitate dei, The
heathen multiplied their gods according to the periods of their life.
that they multiplied their gods because they durst not concredit all to one
God: as they had one god for the mountains, another for the valleys, one for
the sea, and another for the land; so they had a god for every period of man's
life: when the child was borne, they committed him deae Lucinae: when he weeped
they committed him to vaticana or vagitana: when they lifted up the child from
the ground, they committed him to Dea Levana: and when he was in the cradle to
Dea Cunina, and so through the rest of the periods of his life. But David
acknowledged God to be his God from his mothers womb. Psalm. 22.10. So they had
a god or a goddess for every several part of the body, Jupiter the eldest
brother got the head, Neptune the second brother got the breast, and foreparts,
They had gods for every part of the body.
and Pluto the third brother got the hinder parts, the middle part or cinctum
they gave to Mars, the eyes to Cupid, they gave the kidneys to Venus, and the
knees to the Goddess Misericordia, and the feet to Thaleia: these parts they
committed to several Gods and Goddesses, because they distrusted them, and
would not concredite all to one God, but David says, Psalm 34.20. That God
keeps all our bones. And Christ says, that the very hairs of our head are
numbered. Matthew. 10.30. so that they cannot fall to the ground without Gods
providence. They had like ways Deos tutelares which they carried about with
them, as Rachel stole her fathers Gods. Genesis 31.19. and they had Penates, their
household Gods, Esaias. 46.7. They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him and
set him in his place, and he stands: yea from his place shall he not remove.

The second attribute of God who is Ens entium is verum, but the idol teaches
lies, Habakuk 2.18. how teaches the idol lies? Non per inexistentiam, sed per
assistentiam. Non per inexistentia^, that is, the divill spoke not out of the
idol, How the idol speaks lies.
but per assistentia, that is, the priest lying beside the idol, the divill
inspired the Priest to speak these lies. When the Priest slept upon the skin
of the beast that was sacrificed, then the devil inspired him; this sleeping
the Greeks call it (...), (...) pellis.
the idol was but the pledge of the devils presence to the Priest: so now when
the Priests stand in defense of their idols and idolatry, and teach that they
are to be worshipped, then the devil speaks by the idol, and the idol is
the pledge of the devils presence to the Priest, and that which is offered to
the idol is said to be offered to the devil. Psalm. 106.37. 1. Cor. 10.20.

The third attribute of God as he is Ens entium, is Bonum, goodness, there is
none good but God only, that is, having his goodness of himself: but idols
by way of appropriation are called sin. Lament. 1.8. My people have committed
a sin, Idolatry by way of appropriation is called sin.
that is idolatry. So Exodus 32. 22. This people is prone to sin, that is, to
idolatry. So Number. 23.21. He saw no iniquity in Jacob, that is, idolatry, and
in this sense is that place of Syracides to be understood, Syracid. 49.5. All
the kings of Israel were sinners except David, Josias and Ezekias, that is,
they were idolaters.

Secondly, Idol^trie breaks the wedlock betwixt Christ and his Church.
this sin of idolatry breaks that holy wedlock which is betwixt Christ and
his church, he being a jealous God, he cannot suffer his spouse to go a
whooring after other gods, but would have her a chaste virgin presented unto
him; this was typed under the law by the turtle doves and young pigeons, which
the Lord commanded to be offered to him: the young pigeon was commanded to be
sacrificed unto him, because it had never a mate; and the turtle dove, because
it had but one mate: so God will have of his church her first love, and only
love: this abstinence from idolatry is called virginity. God will have of his
Church her first love, and only love.
Revelat. 14.4. and idolaters are called adulterers, Iam. 4.4. when the Jews
denied Ioh. 8.41. that they were the children of fornication, they meant, they
were not idolaters, who say to the stock thou art my father, and to the stone,
thou have brought me forth, Ier. 2.27. they say, they have God for their
father, and they called the Samaritans bastards, (...) ingluvies vel vesicula
in avibus quae sordium receptaculum est a (...) stercus. (...).
because they worshipped strange gods. When the church is corrupted and defiled
with idolatry, then she is called Moreah, Zeph. 3.1. the Seventy translate it,
(...), when one is exposed to some great shame for their filthiness, and in
this sense it is said, that Joseph would not make Mary a public example for
her suspected incontinencie. Mat. 1.19.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
idola^rie being a sin so opposite to God himself; it was a great blindness
in Micha when he set up an idol in his house, to say then. That the Lord would
do him good, Judge. 17.13. their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after
other Gods, Psalm. ^6.7.

EXERCITAT. VI. Commandment 2. How base idols are in the sight of God.
Ier. 11.12. Ye have set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn
incense to Baal.
THis idolatry is most detestable in the eyes of the Lord, therefore when the
scripture speaks of idols it calls them abominationes, as the abomination
of the Moabites, and Ammonites: When the Romans set up the spread-eagle in the
temple of Jerusalem, it was called the abomination of desolation, (...) ab
illicitis idolorum cultibus. Quare addunt haebraei epithetum perpetuum.
Mat. 24.15. so they are called (...), pollutiones, Act. 15.20.

The apostle wills us to abstain from abominable idolatry, 1. Pet. 4.3.
this epithete is not put for distinction sake here, as though there were some
sort of idolatry lawful; but it is Epithetum perpetuum, as the Hebrews call
it, as Psalm. 86.13. Thou have delivered my soul from the lowest hell, we
cannot infer hence that there are two hells, the epithete here is not put for
distinctions sake, but to signify the deepenesse of hell: so the epithete is
added here to signify the vileness of idolatry.

Now if we would understand how detestable these idols are in the sight of
God, let us go through all the causes of them.

How base and senseless makers of idols are.
First the efficient cause; they that make them, are like unto them, Psalm.
115.8. What a senseless thing is this to make an idol, and then to be
afraid of it? these are like little children, who black their neighbors
faces, and then are afraid of them.

Secondly the matter, how basely he thinks of it; when the people began to
worship the brazen serpent, Hebraei exprimunt diminutiva per (...) cum in fine
sic (...). Exodus 32.15. The little righteous ones
he called it Nechusbtan. 2. King. 18.4. as you would say, a little piece of
brass in contempt; for it is the manner of the Hebrews to express their
diminutives by adding Nunto them. So he calls them Gelilim, stercoreos deos.
2. King. 23.10. he defiled topheth, that is, he appointed it for base and
unclean uses, as to cast out their doung there, and their filth; because gods
of doung were worshipped there.

The Lord commanded the Jews when they were about to ease nature to go
without the camp, Ainsworth c. 7.8 of the communion of saints.
Deuteronomy. 23.12.13. and to have a paddle that they might dig and cover the
excreme^ts. All the ceremonial laws are to be reduced to some of the moral
laws; our divines reduce this place properly to the second commandment, that
we should cover these loathsome excrements of idolatry, as they were to cover
their natural excrements. The Lord detesteth the form of the idols.


Thirdly the lord detested the form of them; he detested not only (...) which
is abiecti animalis forma; but also to be represented by man, who of all
visible creatures is the most excellent. Psalm. 115.5. They have eyes and see
not, cares and hear not, and a mouth that speaks not, these were made to the
similitude of man; and likewise the Teraphim were images made to the likeness
of man. 1. Sam. 13.19. yet he detested all these images.

Lastly, from the effects, The base names which the holy Ghost gives to idols.
(...)
the holy ghost calls the idols Miphlezeth, terriculamenta. 1. King. 15.13.
They that worship them shall get no rest neither day nor night. Revel. 14.11.
(...)


So they are called Gnatzabbim, dolores, so they are called Tzirim, tormina vel
cruciatus, (...)
because they put a man to as great pain as the woman is when she is in her
childbirth, Psalm. 135.15.
Esaias. 45.16. and 21.3. They are called Bush, pudor. Ier. 11.12. the same word
is given to a man's privy parts: (...)
Deuteronomy. 25.11. Ye have set up altars to the shameful thing: The heathen gave
sundry names to their idols.
that is, to idols, and so Gideon is called Ierubesheth, 1. Sam. 11.21. because
he put Bush or that shameful idol Baal to shame.

A man is ashamed when his nakedness is seen, this idolatry makes the people
naked. Exodus 35.25. The heathen called their god (...) the God of thunder, but
God in derision called him Baal-Peor, or (...) the god of a crack, they called
their god Baalzebub, the god who did drive away flies, but Christ in disdain
called him (...) the god of doung: the Jews in contempt call the god of Eckron
the god of flies, because their temple was free from flies; for there was never
a fly seen in the temple of Jerusalem for all the flesh that was sacrificed in
it: but the Ekronites called him Baalzebub, because he kept them from hornets
and flies; this name afterward was given to the devil himself, he is called
Baalzebub, because he is the father of all this idolatry.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, all offenses are against the the kings laws, but
petty treason is a greater offense then common transgressions: but when rebels
begin to disclaim their king and set up another in his place, that is the
highest offense of all: sins of the second table offend God, but swearing and
taking the name of God in vain is petty treason against him, as when one
falsifieth the kings coin; but to set up a rebel in his place, an idol, that
is the highest treason: let us detest that sin most, which turns us away
farthest from God.

EXERCITAT. VII. What force idols have to allure those who worship them, and to
draw men after them.
1. Cor. 12.2. Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb
idols, even as ye were led.
THe loadstone has not so great virtue to draw the iron to it, as the idol
has to draw the worshiper after it. And as the whirlewinde carries a man
violently: so do the idols draw men violently after them.

The scripture makes mention of sundry swift beasts, (...) Dromas. Ier. 2.23.
as the mule, Camelo-pardalis, the wild ass, and the dromedary. As the wild
ass snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure, and none can turn her away: and as
the dromedary is most swift transversing her ways. Ier. 2.23.24. So are the
idolaters swift in following their idols.

There are two things that a man is bound to care for specially, his natural
life, and his spiritual life.

His natural life consists in his health, wealth, and ease, but see how the
idolaters to serve their idols, despise and neglect the care of these three.

First, their health, they neglect their bodies, Idolaters neglect their health
to serve their id^ls.
and think their religion consists in abstinence Coloss. 2.23. they disfigure
their faces and looks with a sad countenance. Matt. 6.16. And which is more,
the priests of Baal cut themselves with knives and lancers until the blood
gushed out upon them. 1. Kings 18.28. so do Fratres flagellantes, who whip
themselves until the blood run down: and sometimes they have given their
bodies to be burnt for their idols.

Secondly, a man is bound to have a care of his wealth and riches, but how
prodigally have the idolaters bestowed their riches upon their idols? Idolaters
spare no cost for their idols.
Exodus 32.3. And all the people brake off the golden eare-rings which were in
their ears, and brought them to Aaron. So Hos. 8.4. of their silver and their
gold have they made themselves idols. So Ezekiel. 16.33. Others give gifts to
whores, but thou give thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them. So Psalm.
16.4. deum alienum dotant, that is, they give a dowry to their idols, and
bestow their goods upon them, and stand not for cost.

Thirdly their ease, they care not for their ease, so they may satisfy their
idols. Exodus 32.6. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
offerings. So Baals priests cried from morning until evening. 1. Kings 18.29.
The heathen gave diverse attributes to their idols, and to every attribute they
made a prayer.
They were not weary to use many idle repetitions and long prayers to their
idols. They gave sundry attributes to their idols, and to every attribute they
used to say a prayer, and so with much vain babbling they spent the time: So do
many now spend their canonical hours, and this Christ forbideth: Matt. 6.7.
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do, for they
think they shall be heard for their much babbling.

And their greatest love should be to their children who should succeed them;
but the unnatutall idolater will not stand to offer his children to Moloch, and
to sacrifice them to him. There is but one rare example in all the scriptures
of Abraham, who at the commandment of God took his only son Isaac (...),
the son of his age, and would have offered him to the Lord, but it was usual
to these idolaters to sacrifice their children to devils. Psalm. 106.37.

Secondly, for the spiritual and eternal life; they preferred their idols to
it. Hos. 2.2. They carried their adulteries betwixt their breasts: that is, the
signs of their idolatry, to testify that the idol had their heart, whereas
they should have carried the Lord as a bundle of mirrhe betwixt their breasts:
Cant. 1.13.

So they walked, behhukkoth, in their statutes, Levit. 20.23. Whereas they
should have walked in his statutes; (...)
they gave all honor and reverence unto them; they cried, Great is Diana of
the Ephesians, Act. 19.28. They kept their gods and changed them not. Ier.
2.11. has a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods?

May we not conclude then, Ier. 10.8. They are altogether brutish and foolish,
Conclusion.
the stock is a doctrine of vanities They who worship stocks and stones and
dumb idols, are more brutish then beasts.

EXERCITAT. VIII. The many evils which the people have got out of idolatrous
Egypt.
Deuteronomy. 17.16. Ye shall not cause the people to return to Egypt.
Egypt was the matrix of all idolatry, therefore the Lord forbad them to go
back to Egypt: The evil which the people of God got in Egypt.
they got much mischief out of Egypt, there were their breasts pressed, and
there they bruised the teats of their virginity: Ezekiel. 23.3. They lost their
spiritual virginity there.
There they learned the grounds of their idolatry, hence it is, that the most
of the ceremonial laws are opposite to idolatrous worship in Egypt.

Secondly, turba miscellanea, The mixed multitude came from thence.
the mixed multitude came out of Egypt: Exodus 12.38. Who learned them to
murmr and to cry; Would to God we were back again at the flesh pots of
Egypt. Exodus, 16.2.

Thirdly, they got their leprosy out of Egypt, for that sort of leprosy
called Elephantiasis, The leprosy from Egypt.
when the skin grows hard like the Elephants skin was bred only about Nilus
in Egypt. Deuteronomy. 28.17. The Lord will smite the with the boiles of Egypt. They
forgot their circumcision there.


Forthly, they forgot their circumcision in Egypt, therefore it is called
opprobrium Aegypti, Josh. 5.9. This day have I rolled away the reproach of
Egypt from you.

The blasphemer came out of it.
Fifthly, the blasphemer who blasphemed the name of the Lord, Levit. 24.10. was
the son of an Egyptian.

The golden calves.
Sixthly, Jeroboam brought the golden calves out of Egypt: therefore they were
commanded never to go back again to Egypt. Because Egypt was such a vile
land the Psalmist calls it the land of Ham Psalm. 105.23.27. Egypt why called
Ham.
and 106.22. Ham was cursed by his father Noah, so the Egyptians his posterity
were an accursed people. Egypt was a proud people, Egypt called Rahab.
therefore it is called Rahab, Psalm. 87.4 and Esaias 51.9. And now what have thou
to do in Egypt to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have thou to do in the
way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? Sichor is put for Egypt.
Ier. 2.18. Sihor is Nilus, which signifies blackness, for the troubled
waters of Nilus differed much from the clea^e running waters of Siloh, why then
should they go to drink of them? So the city, for Ierulem, and Behemoth
beasts, for an elephant.
and he calls Euphrates the River here Antonomastice, for the greatness of
it. Genesis 15.18. It is called the great river; these two were the borders of
Canaan, from the river of Egypt to Euphrates. Exodus 23.31.

What great blessing was this then, when five cities in the land of Egypt
should speak the languages of Canaan, (...) ^^str^ctio. (...)
that is, should worship the Lord in truth, And one of them shall be called
the city of the Sun, Esaias. 19.18. that is, they shall be converted to
profess the truth, and one of them shall be the most excellent city, that is
Alexandria, the city where Mark taught the Gospel first.

If Egypt was so abhorred and detested by the Lord, what must spiritual Egypt
be? Revelat. 11.8. and these Who take the mark of the beast upon them.
Revelat. 16.2. And as they were never to return back to Egypt again; so
neither must the people of God return now to spiritual Egypt.

Observe how John does parallel the judgments of old Egypt, and spiritual
Egypt together. Old Egypt and spiritual Egypt paralleled together in their
plagues.
Old Egypt was plagued with sores and botches: In sores.
so are they of spiritual Egypt. Revelat. 16.2.

Secondly in old Egypt the waters were turned into blood: So in spiritual
Egypt. In blood.
The waters of the sea became as the blood of a dead man, and every living
soul died in the sea. Verse. 3.

Thirdly in old Egypt there was great darkness: In darkness.
So in spiritual Egypt there is great darkness. Verse. 10.

Fourthly, frogs molested the Kings chamber in Egypt, In the frogs.
So frogs came out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the
beast, working miracles to deceive the world and the Kings of the earth. Verse.
13. Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses in Egypt. 2. Tim. 3.8. And when he
wrought his miracles they said, he carried straw to Aphra, as the proverb is
in the Talmud, In their magitians.
they meant that there was Magic enough in Egypt already, therefore he needed
not to come to Egypt, to play his tricks of Magic there; thus they withstood
the man of God, and hardened the heart of Pharaoh: So in spiritual Egypt, do
these frogs and deceivers set themselves against Moses, saying, that he has
not his calling of God.

Lastly, there was thundering and lightning in Egypt; In thundering and
lightning.
so in spiritual Egypt Verse. 18.

The conclusion of this is; Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers
of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. Revelat. 18.4.

EXERCITAT. IX. A comparison betwixt the golden calves set up in the
wilderness, the golden calves in Dan and Bethel, and the popish Idols.
Commandment II.
Psalm. 106.19. They made a calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image; they
changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.
THe idolatry of Jeroboam, compared with the idolatry of the Israelites in
the wilderness, The idolatry of the Israelites under Jeroboam compared with
their idolatry in the time of Aaron.
setting up the golden calfe, will be found a far less sin, if we look
nearely unto it.

First, they had lately tasted of the great benefits of God, in delivering them
out of Egypt by a mighty hand, and bringing them through the red sea: Yet they
soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel. Psalm. 106.13. In
benefit^.
They forgot God their Savior which had done great thin^s in Egypt, wonderful
works in the land of Ham, and terrible things in the red sea. Verse. 21.22.

In outward pledges of his favor.
Secondly they had many more pledges of the favor of God, then the ten Tribes
had, they had the cloud by day, (...) pa^^^ ^^^ustissimorum.
and the pillar of fire by night, he fed them with the bread of the strong
ones, Psalm. 78.25. They had the tabernacle, and the arc the testimony of God
presence amongst them, which Jeroboam and the ten tribes had not; therefore
their sin was greater then theirs.

In their prophets.
Thirdy for prophets, they had Moses the man of God, who was faithful in all
his house. Heb. 3.2. the ten tribes had Ahijah the Shilonite, but what was he
to Moses? they had an old prophet in Bethel, but a great deceiver, and they
had a young prophet, but was easily deceived. 1. King. 13. and what were they
to Moses?

Fourthly, the ten tribes had priests but of the meanest and the basest of the
people. 1. King. 13.33. In their priests.
He made of the lowest of the people priests for the high places, whosoever
would, he consecrated him, and be became one of the priests of the high
places: but they had Aaron the Lords high priest, who was consecrated and
ordained by God himself, and called to this honor. Heb. 5.4. Aarons sin in
making the golden calfe a greater sin than the sin of Demetrius or Jeroboam.
he that had holiness to the Lord engraven in a plate of gold upon his
forehead, for him to sit down and fashion an image with a graving tool; like
another Demetrius the silver-smith, he making silver shrines to Diana, and he
making golden calves to Iehova, what a great change was this? Again he to
represent the Lord by an ox that eats grass. Ps. 106.20. This was a great
abomination it was great idolatry when the men of Lycaonia would have
worshipped God in the likeness of men, Act. 14.11. but greater idolatry to
worship the lord in the likeness of an ox: Jeroboam made a feast day
according to his own heart, in honor of his idol. 1. King. 12.13. so said
Aaron, to morrow is a feast to Iehova, this was a greater sin than that of
Jeroboam.

Now let us compare the idolaters in our times with those who worshipped the
golden calfe in the wilderness, and ye shall see greater abomination in this
idolatry than in the idolatry of former times. The Israelites gave the glory
of Christ who dwelt in a cloud and pillar unto a calfe; but these idolaters
give the glory of Christ when he is dwelling in our flesh, Sacrae ceremoniae
Eccles. Romans lib. 7. cap. de consecratione agni dei.
and glorified to a creature whom they worship as God indeed, giving it to
their crucifixes and Agnus Dei.

When Christ was in the flesh here, there were many who gave themselves out for
false Christ's; but Christ forbids to believe such. Mat. 24.23. so these
counterfeit christ's should not be believed.

The Lord, Ezekiel. 23.4. makes a comparison betwixt two sisters, (...)
Aholah and Aholibah. Aholah is tentorium, Abolibah is tentorium meum in ea.
He calls the ten tribes tentorium a tent, because they were separated from
the temple of God now, and he calls the kingdom of Judah, tentorium meum in
ea, my tabernacle in her, because as yet they professed the true worship of
God. Aholah played the harlot. Verse. 5. But yet her sister Aholibah was more
corrupted then she, A comparison betwixt the idolatry of Israel and Judah.
Verse. 11. So compare Aholah the Jewish church with Aholibah (who glories that
she is the true church) and she shall be found the greater harlot of the two.
And the lord comparing Samaria with Jerusalem, Ezekiel. 16.51. says, that Samaria
had not committed half of the sins which Judah had committed, Quomodo Hebraei
exprimunt comparativum gradum.
but that Judah had justified her sister in all her abominations; amplificasti
abominationes tuas prae ipsis. Samaria was not simply justified, but only in
comparison with Judah. So Luke. 18.14. The publican went down to his house,
justus prae illo, justified rather than the Pharisee. So Mat. 12.41. Surgere
and stare in iudice^ quid apud hebraci.
The queen of the South shall rise in judgment against this generation, that
is; shall stand in judgment and not fall, compared with this generation: So if
we will compare the Jewish idolatry and the idolatry of this generation, A
comparison betwixt the idolatry of the Jews, and the idolatry in our times.
they shall stand in judgment when this generation shall fall; and there shall
be a more easy sentence pronounced against them, then against this generation.

The Jews who were so much addicted to idolatry before the Lord Jesus Christ's
coming in the flesh, quite renounced their idols, and they say now, that there
is no punishment which befalls them, but there is a drachme weight of the
golden calfe in it; and when they see any church in which there are idols, they
call it Beth Hatturpha, domus turpitudini^. (...)
So we may hope that, before the Lords second coming, they who stand most in
defense of these idols: shall renounce them as a filthy thing, and acknowledge
that there was a drachme weight of their idolatry in all their former
punishments.

EXERCITAT. X. Of the increase of idolatry, and how it increased and spread
through the world. Commandment II.
Ier. 16.11. Your fathers have forsaken me, says the Lord, and have walked
after other gods, and served them, and worshipped them, and ye have done worse
then your fathers.
Idolatry is a work of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. And there is no work of the
flesh that man is so prone unto as to idolatry: The first period, of Idolatry.
The first period of idolatry began not long after the creation. Genesis 4.24.
Then began men to profane the name of the Lord. Psalm. 49.12. Man being in
honor abides not, he is like the beasts that perish. Idolatry makes a man
brutish.
Idolatry makes a man brutish. Ier. 10.14. Every man is brutish in his
knowledge, every founder is confounded by his gra^en image.

There were three notable men, from the creation to the flood, who kept the
truth in sincerity and purity in their families; Adam, Methusalem, and Noah,
and then the Lord drowned the world for wickedness.

After the flood, The second period of idolatry.
as people increased they began to build a tower to get themselves a name, and
the Lord scattered them, and they who went to the east worshipped idols, and
this was called (...), the Persians called the Scythians with whom they were
conversant, Sakas, a Sach vel Sacksah, which signifies a multitude, because
they were gathered together in multitudes; So the Arabians had their names from
Gnarabh, (...) miscelanea turba a (...) miscuit*
miscere, turba miscellanea, a confused multitude. Genesis 14.1. Tidall King of
nations, Symmachus translateth it King of the Scythians; and these worshipped
their conquerours and captains as gods. The church all this time remained with
Heber and his posterity, Melchizedeck and some few others who dwelt in Canaan.
The Churh in the third period remained with the posterity of of Hebe^ and with
some few others.
Those of Hebers posterity who went to Syria fell to idolatry, and therefore
an Aramite is put for an idolater in the scriptures; Terah Abraham's father an
idolater, Abraham himself was an idolater, Laban the Syrian an idolater,
Naaman the Syrian an idolater, and Balaam the Syrian an idolater.

There were some others who were not of the posterity of Heber who kept the
truth amongst them. Genesis 20.4. Lord will thou slay also a righteous nation?

Third period of idolatry.
The third period after the flood when idolatry increased, was, when they set
up a molten calfe which Moses caused bray to powder; and made them drink it in
detestation of that idol which they had worshipped.

After Moses death, Satan labored to make an idol of the body of Moses, Satan
labored to make an idol of Moses body.
and that which he could not do by him when he was living, he goes about to
effect it by his body when he was dead; but Michael withstood him. Iud. 9. and
buried his body where no man knew; and here we may see that the relics of the
Saints are made idols.

The fourth period of idolatry.
The fourth period of idolatry was under the Judges, and here we shall mark
four things. First that none of the Judges themselves were idolaters, as most
of the King of Judah and all the Kings of Israel were, and that was the cause
why idolatry got not such footing in the time of the Judges, as it did
afterward. None of the Judges were idolaters.


Secondly, when they fell to idolatry, the Lord scourged them by the
Philistims, Ammonites, Madianites, and then they cried unto the Lord, and he
helped them,

Thirdly, Dan an idolatrous tribe.
of all the tribes the tribe of Dan was most given to idolatry; therefore they
took away the Ephod Teraphim, and the graven image out of the house of Micah,
and set it up in Dan, this was the idolatry of the whole tribe, Is it better
for thee to be a Priest for the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto
a tribe and a family in Israel? Iud. 18.20.

Fourthly, Jonathan the son of Gershon, the son of Manasseth was the priest
to this idol. Jonathan was the son of Gershon, and Gershon was the son of
Moses, (...) cum suspenso pro (...)
and the Jews observe that they will not have him called the grandchilde of
Moses, but of Manasseth, who by anticipation was called Manasseth, because he
followed him in his idolatry; yet to show that he was the grandchild of
Moses, the word is so set down that it may be read either Manasse or Mose. The
judgments of God upon Dan for their idolatry.


Because the tribe of Dan was most infected with idolatry, therefore the
golden calves were afterward erected in Dan, as a punishment of their former
idolatry, and for this cause it was that they were the first of the tribes, who
were carried away in the west side of Jordan. Ier. 8.16. The snorting of his
horses was heard from Dan, and John, Rev. 12. When he reckoned up the tribes
which were sealed, he passes by the tribe of Dan.

The fifth period of idolatry was under the Kings, The fifth period of idolatry.
the Kings of Israel were idolaters, or tolerated idols, All the Kings of
Israel were sinners except David, Ezekiah and Josias, Ecclus. 49.5. That is,
they were idolaters. In this period idolatry waxed by degrees, first it waxed
much in Salomons time, he who excelled all the sons of the East for his
knowledge, Idolatry in the fifth period increased by degrees.
he whose heart the Lord had enlarged, he who was a prophet of God and a pen
man of the Holy Ghost, he who for his devotion offered to God so many thousand
sacrifices, his prayers, his great care he had to build the Temple, who fell
not away until his old days, who would have thought that the dragon with his
tail would have pulled down this great star? and although the Lord
threatened that the kingdom should be rent from him. 1. King. 11.11. Yet he was
nothing moved with it; and if we will compare his foolish son Rehoboam with
his wise father, he may seem to be more obedient then he; for when he had
gathered an army to fight against Jeroboam and the ten tribes, yet when the
prophet Shemaiah came to him, 1. King. 12.24. He harkened unto the word of the
Lord and went back again, but Salemon went on in his sins and idolatry.

Idolatry came to a greater high in the days of Jeroboam.
Secondly, it waxed more when the ten tribes were rent from the house of David
and Solomon; then Jeroboam set up the calves in Dan and Bethel, then the ten
tribes were Aholah, and yet Aholibah exceeded them in whoredoms. Ezekiel. 23.

Thirdly, it came to the height in the days of Manasseth, and so it continued
with the rest of the Kings, like a leprosy, until the captivity. Then
idolatry died in the captivity, for there they were purged and fined, and
they brought it not back, neither went a whoring after other gods.

The last period was when idolatry began in the christian church, the beast
which was dead was quickened again: Revelat. 17.11. And then the idolatry of
the Gentiles was brought in in the christian church.

EXERCITAT. XI. Whether Gideon made the Ephod an idol or not. Commandment II.
Judge. 8.26. And Gideon made an Ephod thereof, and put it in his city in
Ophra; and all Israel went thither a whoring after it.
WHen Gideon made an Ephod of the gold and eare-rings which they had taken of
the spoil, we need not to take it so strictly that it was only made of gold,
but of those things which were taken in the spoil, whether gold, silk,
linen, etc.

But it may seem, Verse. 27. That statuit in Ophra, he set it up in Ophra,
that it was of pure gold, which might stand up, an image made of gold.

In the Hebrew it is posuit only, he put it, and not, he set it up, the
priests Ephod was of linen, and the high priests Ephod was partly of linen,
and partly of silk, and partly of gold.

This word Ephod in the scripture is applied only to holy uses, Ephod twofold.
but if we will consider the persons who put on the Ephod, then it may be
said to be partly ecclesiastical, and partly politic.

Ecclesiastical is three fold, first the Ephod of the high priest: Exodus 28.6.
Secondly of the priests: Ephod ecclesiastical threefold.
1. Sam. 22.18. And thirdly of the Levites: 1. Sam. 2.18.

Politic again is that which David wore when he danced before the Arc: 2.
Sam. 6.18. David did not put on the Priests ephod.
When David said to Abiather the high priest Ahimelechs son, I pray thee bring
me hither the Ephod. 1. Sam. 30.7. And Abiather brought hither the Ephod, el
David, to David, that is, Davidis causa, (...) id est, Davidis causa.
the priest took on this Ephod to ask counsel for David what he should do,
David wore not the priestly Ephod himself; for by Ephod here is meant the
whole ornaments of the priest: So Hos 3.4.

Gideon intended here to set up an idol in Ophra? those who hold the
affirmative bring this reason for them: because he instituted that for which he
had not warrant out of the word of God.



Gideon did not directly set up an idol, nor did he intend to do it; but
because he withstood not the people when they committed idolatry, therefore
he sinned.

Verse. 27. it is not rightly translated, Fornicatus est omnis Israel post cum,
as though they followed Gideons example in their idolatry; The Israelites went
not a whoring after the Ephod till after the death of Gideon. Obj.
Iunius translateth it better, post eum scilicet Ephodem, or in eo scilicet
Ephode.

Thirdly, some hold that Gideon sinned, offering sacrifice with this Ephod upon
him.

Vzziah when he went to offer incense at the altar, but stroke him with
leprosy: 2. Cron. 26.17. and spared not Core, Dathan, and Abiram with their
accomplices. Number. 16. Would he have spared Gideon if he had attempted such a
thing? and is it probable that he who refused the government when it was
offered to him by all their consent, that he would affect the priesthood?



When Ieshuah set up an altar, Josh. 22.29,30. Gideon set up the Ephod in
memory of thanksgiving.
He set it not up that they might sacrifice there, but only he set it up as a
memorial of thanksgiving. So Gideon made this Ephod only in a memorial of
thanksgiving, and for no other use.

But these who hold the negative that he committed not idolatry in making the
Ephod, bring these reasons. Reasons proving that Gideon committed not idolatry
in making the Ephod.


First Jude 8.32. It is said, Gideon died in a good old age, which comprehends
in it four things. First, fullness of days; secondly, tranquillity of mind;
thirdly, a good name, and fourthly, to die in the favor of God, and this
phrase is never spoken but of those who died well, as Abraham died in bona
cani^ie, in a good old age. Genesis 25.15. So David, 1. Chron. 29.28. and so
Gideon here.

Secondly, the Israelites are challenged for this, showed not kindness toward
Ierubbaal, or Gideon, according to the goodness which he had shown to them,
Verse. 35. Now if he had set up this idol to make the people to commit
idolatry, they should have had no cause to have shown kindness to him, but
rather should have hated him.

But it may be said that the Ephod became a snare to him and to his house:
Verse. 27.

Although Gideon himself sinned not in setting up the Ephod, yet it tended to
his ruin, that is, Abimelech, when this Ephod was set up in the house of
Baal-bereth in Sichem. Judge. 9.33.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
that we are to construe the acts of the Saints in the best part where we see
no evident proof to the contrary: far less are we to condemn them, where
the holy spirit commends them.

EXERCITAT. XII. Whether Naaman might bow in the house Rimmon or not?
Commandment II.
2. King. 5.18. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master
goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand,
and I bow my self in the house of Rimmon.
THere is a question moved, whether or not may a man dissemble his religion,
and be present at the worship of idols? and some allege this place for it.

For clearing of this, Cajetan observes, first what is meant by this word
Lehishtahhavath; (...)
secondly, what it is that Naaman craveth; and thirdly, what the prophets
answer infers.

First, he observes that this word Lehishtahhavoth bowing, (the greeks
translate it (...)) was used by the eastern people both in civil and
religious worship, Cajetan goes about to clear Naaman of idolatry in bowing
in the house of Rimmon.
and it is translated adorare (says he) but improperly only, si adoravero in
templo Rimmon: but se in what Naaman desires to be dispensed with; he craveth
only a pardon and dispensation here, for the bowing of his body, as he was
wont to do to the king; he acknowledges here the true God, that he would
serve none but him, and that he would have an Altar built for him that he might
sacrifice only to him. And whe^he returned to his country, no doubt but he
worshipped the true God?

Genuflexio imitatiua. obsequij.

And Caietan observes farther, that there is a double bowing of the knee; the
first is called Genuflexio imitativa, the second is called Genuflexio obsequij:
and he says, that genuflexio imitativa; counterfeiting the kings bowing, Est
eiusdem speciei cum regio, it is of the same kind with the kings bowing of the
knee, and this is flat idolatry; Naaman meant not of such kind of bowing of
the knee.

The question then is only de genuflexione obsequii, this he says, was
lawful in it self, and he bowed with the king, not having respect to
idolatry, but only to his bowing simply. For the king to bow, it is not an
unlawful action; but when he boweth before an idol with an idolatrous mind
to worship the idol, then it is idolatry, but his servant bowing with him,
and doing that civil honor to him which he used to perform to him at other
times, is not partaker of his idolatry; the one is adoratio absoluta, and the
other is relativa: and he goes about to clear the matter by this comparison,
Adoratio absoluta. relativa.

If a great man should go unto a whore, and his servants should accompany
him, they go not with him as he is going unto a whore, but simply as he is
going, and they accompany him now as at other times; but if they should commend
him for such a fact and flatter him in it, Simile.
then they should be guilty of his whooredome: So when Naaman went into the
house of Rimmon with the king and bowed there, this bowing was only a civil
bowing, such as he performed to the king at other times before.

But when it is objected,

He answers, Naaman had not made a protestation to the contrary that he would
worship none but the true God, it had been a scandal, but Naaman protested
the contrary both in word and deed, and so was free from scandal.

But the matter is not clear yet, Naamans fact contrary to his protestation.
he makes a protestations here, but it may seem that his fact is contrary
to his protestation, when he goes in and boweth there. And Caietans comparison
which he uses, seems not to be so pertinent; for if the servants should go in
with their master in the bawdy house and see him commit that villainy, could
they justify themselves by their civil homage which they owe to their lord;
Naaman was not simply free of sin in bowing in the house of Rimmon.
we cannot say then that Naaman was simply free of sin in this; and therefore
he craveth pardon.

Some answer, that the prophet fitteth his answer here to the weak and
infirm conscience. Romans 15.1. Ye that are strong ought to bear with the
infirmities of the weak: The Prophet fitted his answer to the weak conscience
of Naaman, as some say.
and they say his weak conscience appeared in this, because he was not
resolved as yet fully what to do in this case: This is the note of a weak
conscience, Romans 14.15. to be troubled and grieved at a thing, and doubt
whether it may do it, or not do it; and yet inclines to do it, this is an
infirm conscience: the prophet having to do here with his weak brother,
bids him go in peace, Naaman asks two things.
and not to trouble him about this matter: but this cannot be the meaning of
the prophets answer, that go in peace should be an affirmative justifying him
in this fact, Naaman has two demands, first that he might have so much earth,
as to build an altar that he might sacrifice to the Lord upon it: now if we
shall fit the prophets answer to this demand, would the prophet justify a
thing that was contrary to the Law, and bid him go sacrifice there? for they
were to sacrifice only in the place which the Lord their God should appoint.
So go in peace, the meaning is not that the prophet allows this fact of his.
Non est factum approbantis, sed dimittentis and promittentis se oraturum pro
salute eius; that is, he approved not this that Naaman asked, but when he said
go in peace, it was only a dismissing of him, and sending him away, promising
that he would pray for him, that the Lord would strengthen and confirm him,
who as yet was weak in faith, if this fact had been allowed or approved by
the Prophet, what is the cause that so many martyrs of God have suffered such
great torments and troubles, The Prophet did not approve this demand of Naaman.
rather then that they would communicate with idolaters in the least show of
idolatry?

There was a stately fountain of water, and the image of Bacchus set up there
with a vinetree spreading it self round about the court, and overshadowing it;
when Licinius came for recreation to the court, Auxentius and many others
following him, seeing a branch of the vine tree loaded with clusters, he bad
Auxentius cut it off, and he suspecting nothing, did it; Then Licinius said
unto him, set that branch at the feet of Bacchus. Suidas in Auxentio.
But Auxentius answered, God forbid, o Emperor, that I do it, for I am a
Christian; But Licinius said unto him, either get thee from my service, or do
this; The martyrs would communicate with idolaters in nothing.
at nihil cunctatus zonam soluit and recessit: The martyrs of God would not
cast one grain of frankincense into the fire to the idols; they would
communicate with them in nothing: therefore the Prophet would never justify
this, that he should go into the house of Rimmon upon any pretense to worship:
The Prophet would not justify Naamans going into the house of Rimmon.
When the Emperor went unto the Mass, the Count Palatine who was his
swordbearer, carried his sword before him to the church door, but would never
go into the Mass with him; and he learned not, that this distinction of
genuflexio imitativa and genuflexio obsequij, would have saved him from
idolatry.

The conclusion of this is, that those who are zealous for the glory of God
will neither directly nor indirectly communicate with idolaters, neither will
they eat swines flesh, nor drink of the broth. Esaias. 65.4.

EXERCITAT. XIII. Of mixtures of Religion. Commandment II.
1. King. 18.21. And Elijah came unto all the people and said, how long halt
ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, then follow him; but if Baal,
then follow him.
TO worship two gods is a sin against the first commandment; but to mix the
means of Gods worship, is a sin against the second commandment.

When things are mixed they are not kept in purity as when Vintners mix water
with wine, or when silver and lead are mixed together, and they make up a
third, different from the two; God will not have his religion mixed this ways.

The Lord commanded, Exodus 30.29. to make the holy ointment of pure myrrh, in
the original it is mar derer, mirrha libertatis, that is, which is free from
all mixture, (...)
so thou shall make oleum de olivis purissimum. Levit. 24.2. the incense that
was offered was the most transparent and pure incense, Lebhonah Zaccah: Exodus
30.34. (...)
So the flower which was offered to God was simila pura, The wine, o^ntment,
the oil, the flower which was offered to the Lord were pure without mixture.
and the Apostle forbids (...), to mix the word: 2. Cor. 2.17. As Vintners
mix water and wine together. Prove. 9.3. Wisdom sent forth her maids, why are
they called her maids? but to teach preachers to keep the word in sincerity,
as virgins labor to keep their virginity uncorrupted; and therefore the
prophet Esaias puts the prophets and evangelists in the feminine gender,
Mebhashereth. Prophets and Evangelists put in the feminine gender. (...) The
people of God are not called from Abraham.


The Jews observe, that the people of God are never called in the scriptures
Abrahamites from Abraham, neither Isaac from Isaac, but once Amos 7.9. But they
are called Israelites from Jacob, and Jews from Judah, and they gave this to be
the reason; because there came those of Abraham who professed diverse
religions, and so of Isaac; but these who came of Israel and of Judah professed
but one religion.

The Lord would have his people a people dwelling by themselves, The Jews a
people dwelling by themselves.
that they should have no meddling with the heathen. Number. 23.9. Lo the people
shall dwell alone, Why he would not have them to dwell near the sea.
and shall not be reckoned among the nations. He would not have them lie near
the sea coast (for the Philistims lay betwixt them and the sea,) lest they
having too great commerce by sea with the heathen, they should have waxed
prouder and learned their fashions, as Tyrus waxed prouder by trading with many
nations by sea. Ezekiel. 27.28. and this ways they should have endangered their
religion; Solomon of all the Kings sent his ships far abroad to other
nations, but Iehosaphat and Ahaziah attempted this in vain. The kings of the
Islands who.
2. Chron. 20.35. and where it is said, Psalm. 72 10. The Kings of the Islands
shall bring presents to thee, what Islands are meant here? not the far Islands,
but the Islands which lay within the Mediterranean sea.

First, it was not lawful to mix Gods religion and the devils, Gods religion
and the devils mixed together.
such was that religion in the house of Micah. Iud. 17.5. Who had an Ephod and
Teraphim, an Ephod for the true worship of God, and the Teraphim for the
worship of the devil.

Again it was not lawful to mix Iudaisme and Gentilisme together. Levit.
19.27. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall thou mar
the corners of thy beard, Iudaisme and gentilisme.
ye shall not make any cutting in your flesh for the dead, nor print any mark
upon you. These were the ceremonies of the heathen; therefore the Lord
discharges his people to use them. Such was the mixture of the Samaritan
religion, who worshipped both the Lord and the idols of the land; and such was
the religion of the Gergasites who learned many things of the heathen, Joseph.
lib. 2. de bello Iudaico. cap. 20.
as to eat swines flesh, and not to circumcise; and of the Ebionites who
observe both the Jewish and christian sabbath.

Christianity and Iudaisme cannot be mixed.
Thirdly, it is not lawful to mix christianity and judaisme; such were the
Galatians, who would keep the ceremonies of the law and the gospel.



Why the Apostles kept the ceremonies after the death of Christ.
They kept these ceremonies but for a while, for the winning of the weak Jews.
When Christ came in the flesh, the ceremonies and grace were mixed together
like the new wine and the dregs; then the lees began to settle down, and the
wine to be somewhat more clear: so at the first, the wine of grace and the
ceremonies which were the lees, were mingled together, and afterward they
began to be separated; Simile.
and as the Vintner, if he draw the wine too soon from the lees, it will
become sour; for the dregs keep the wine from corruption, therefore he who
minds to keep his wine, lets it stand upon the dregs awhile to preserve
it: So the Apostles would not draw the wine of grace too soon from the lees of
the ceremonies, but lest this wine standing too long upon the lees should
corrupt, as Moab did. Ier. 48.11. therefore they drew the gospel altogether
from the ceremonies.

When judaisme and gentilisme were mixed together, here the ox and the ass
were yoked together, the clean and the unclean beast; when the apostles used
the ceremonies after the death of Christ, they used them ad aliud, and non per
se, The ceremonies after the death of Christ, were not kept for themselves but
for another end.
for the winning of their brethren, and not for any thing that was in the
ceremonies themselves, but when the Galatians used them under the gospel, this
was to join a dead man and a living man together, for they were dead after
Christ said, consummatum est, and had no use in the church afterward but by
accident; for as he who builds a vault lets the centrels stand until he
put in the key stone, and then he pulls them away: so when the corner stone
Jesus Christ was come, it was time that these centrels, the ceremonies should
be removed.

Fourthly, it is not lawful to mix christianity and gentilisme, such was the
doctrine of the Nicolaitans: Revelat. 2.15. and some in Corinth who professed
that there was not a resurrection: Such is the religion of those in Russia and
Muscovia, they have some christian profession of the Greek church, and mixed
with many heathenish ceremonies.

Whether is it a greater sin to mix judaisme and christianity together,

It is a greater sin to mix judaisme and christianity together,

Fifthly, when a religion is made up of judaisme, gentilisme, and christianity,
Brerewood in his inquiries.
such is the religion of the Marduites a people in Syria, who keep the
christian sabbath with the Christians, and the Jewish sabbath with the Jews,
and they worship the sun and the moon with the Pagans.

Some idolatrous worship is made up of judaisme, gentilisme, and Arrianisme, as
Turcisme. Some is made of iudaisme, gentilisme, and christianity.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, the pure worship of God is like the glassie sea.
Revel. 4.6. which is transparent and shines, and not dark and covered with
ceremonies: we must not borrow the painting of that wrinkled whore to paint the
Church with it, but we must keep her in her own beauty.

EXERCITAT. XIV. Of the motives which moved the heathen to worship idols.
Commandment 2.
Romans 1.21. Because when they knew God they glorified him not, they became
vain in their imaginations.
Idolatry amongst the heathen arose especially from three grounds, the first
ground was the desire which they had to continue the name of their
predecessors, benefactors, and their nobles; the second ground, was the desire
of some bodily pledge of Gods presence to be amongst them; and the third
ground which drew them to idolatry, was their boldness to represent God
mystically and hieroglyphically by sundry images.

The heathen set up an image to continue the name of their predecessors, and
their posterity worshipped it as a God.
The first ground was their desire to continue their name to the posterity, and
therefore they set up images only at the first for representation in
remembrances; but the posterity following, turned this representation into
adoration, and they made gods of those whom they knew to have been but men;
therefore they set up in their temples, Harpocrates holding his finger upon his
mouth, to teach them silence, that no man should be bold to say, that these
were men once, Augustine. de civitate Dei lib. 8.
whom they worship now as gods.

The second ground which moved them to commit idolatry, The people desired
much a visible sign of the presence of their God.
was the desire they had of some visible pledge of the presence of a godhead
amongst them; and even as the soldiers desire to see their captain visibly in
the field before them: So desired they to have some visible sign of a godhead
amongst them; and having these pledges, they thought that their gods would not
leave them, and wanting these, they thought the gods would leave them.

When Alexander the great besieged Tyrus, one of their Diviners told them, that
it was revealed to him in a dream, that their god Apollo was to depart from
them shortly; what do they to detain Apollo still amongst them? they take the
image of Apollo their god, They tied the image of Apollo to a post.
and bind it with a chain of gold to a post, thinking thereby to detain
Apollo; they held that this image was a pledge of his presence amongst them,
Diodorus Sic. lib. 1. cap. 1.
and they thought so long as they kept the image of Apollo that he would not
leave them.

The third ground which led them to this idolatry, was their boldness to
represent god mystically by their hieroglyphics, representing him as they
pleased. Plutarch. de Iside and Osiri.
In Thebe a town of Egypt (as Plutarch makes mention) they worshipped a god
whom they acknowledged to be immortal, but how painted they him? in the
likeness of a man blowing an egg out of his mouth, How they painted God in
Thebe* Varro de re rustica lib. 2. cap. 1.11.
whereby they signified, that it was the Lord that made the round world by his
word, and they dedicated a sheep to him; because of old, milk was their food
for the most part.

So in the town of Sai where Minerva was worshipped, before the gates of the
Temple they had this hiroglyphick painted an infant, an old man, a sparhawke, a
fish, Plutarch. de Iside and Osiri.
and Hippopotamos whereby they signified, O qui nascimini and denascimini, Deus
odit impudentiam. By the young child they signified our birth, and by the old
man our death, and by the sparhawke they meant God, who was most sharp in
sight to see all things, and swift to revenge; and by the fish which lives in
the sea, a thing hated by the Egyptians, they meant hatred, and by Hippopotamos
the sea horse, who kills his father and covers his damme, they meant
impudency.

The Egyptians represented God by a serpent.
So the Egyptians represented God by the serpent Aspis who casts the skin
every year and renueth the age of it, whereby they signified Gods
immortality, and thus boldly They changed the glory of the incorruptible God
into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed
beasts and creeping things. Romans 1.23.

EXERCITAT. XV. Whether things idolatrous may be converted to any use, either
in the service of God, or may we convert them to our own use? Commandment II.
Deuteronomy. 7.25. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou
shall not desire the silver or gold that is upon them, nor take it unto thee,
lest thou be snared therein, for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
AS we must give nothing to the idol, so we must take nothing from it.

There were three sorts of Cherem, (...) Res devota Anathema. Three sorts of
execrable things under the law.
or things execrable under the law, first when both men and beasts were to be
destroyed, and then nothing came either to Gods use or to the peoples; such
were the goods of the apostate Jews who fell away from the true God. Deuteronomy.
13.15. and in this sense the Amalekites and their goods were execrable.

Secondly, they were execrable, when the men and their beasts and their stuff
were burnt, but the gold, silver, brass, and iron were reserved for the use of
the sanctuary, and these of Jericho were execrable in this sort: Josh. 6.24.

The third sort were these, when the men alone were killed, but the beasts and
all other things which belonged to them were converted to the use of the
soldiers; such was the town of Hai. Josh. 8.27.

Things consecrate to idols were execrable when they were idolatrous in state.

Things belonging to idolaters are of three sotts.
Things belonging to Idolaters were of three sorts, first such as pertained to
Idolaters but were not idolatrous, as David took the sword of Goliath, and hung
it up in the house of God; What idolatrous things we may use.
secondly things that were idolatrous, but were not idolatrous in state, as the
fountains out of which the heathen drew water for the service of their idols,
yet the Christians might have converted these fountains to a spiritual or a
civil use; so Gideon took the bullock which was appointed for Baal, and the
grove, and offered the bullock with the wood in a sacrifice to the Lord. Judge.
6.26. So the Bethshemites took the Philistims cart, and the kine, and offered
them to the Lord in a sacrifice. 1. Sam. 6.15. because they were not idolatrous
in state; for even as the clothes of the leper being washed, were made clean,
Lev. 21.8. So those things which belonged to the Idolater, and were not
idolatrous in state, might be cleansed and converted to other uses.

But when a thing was idolatrous in state, and carried the mark and badge of
the idol still upon it; as their images of gold and silver, and their
ornaments. Deuteronomy. 7.25. they were to be cast away, and not to be converted to
any other use. Esaias. 30.22. Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven
images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shall
cast them away as a menstruous cloth, and shall say unto it, get thee hence.

Achan stole a Babylonish garment, and two hundredth shekels of silver, and a
wedge of gold. Josh. 7.21. in the Hebrew it is, (...) Lingua auri.
Lashon zahabh, a tongue of gold, this tongue some hold to have been the sword
which hung by the idols side; Vi^^lspand de ponderibus and mensuris. The
Scythians worshipped asword.
and some worshipped Acinacis, the sword it self, as the Scythians. Of old, a
sword was called lingua, as Fannius an ancient writer testifies, and the
Babylonish garment they hold to be the cloak which covered the idol, and the
two hundred shekels to be the money which was dedicated to the idol; now
because Achan took this which was idolatrous in state, and which might not be
converted to his use, therefore the Lord will have him and all his to be rooted
out.

That which had an immediate dependence still upon the idol, and had relation
to it, Cassiodorus and tripartita Rufins.
keeping still both the matter and the form; that cannot be offered to the
Lord. Example, What Idolatrous things might not be used.
Constantine the great took out of the temple of Serapis their sacred elne
Fathom, whereby they measured yearly how much the river Nilus would overflow;
which the heathen thought to have a certain divinity in it; this elne
Constantine should not have caused to be put in the temple of Alexandria,
because this elne both in matter and form was kept here, as it was in the
idolatrous use before.

That which is idolatrous in state and has an immediate dependence upon the
idol, Nothing that has an immediate dependence on the Idol can be converted
to any use.
should neither be converted to a spiritual or a civil use; therefore that
which the Jews say, is false, that David took the crown from Milcom the god
of the Ammonites, and set it upon his own head. 2. Sam. 12.30. If this crown
was the crown of the god of the Ammonites, then it was idolatrous in state,
(...) nomen Idoli. (...) Rex eorum. David took not the Crown from Mil om the
Idol, but from the King of Ammon. Obj.
and David could not have set it upon his own head. Wherefore he took this
crown from Malcam the king of the Ammonites, and set it upon his own head.

But how could the king wear such a crown upon his own head? a talent in
weight is forty six pounds and fourteen ounces, which being reduced to the
value of our money will extend to 2250. pounds; the king of Ammon could not
wear such a crown of so great weight upon his head; therefore it may seem
that it was taken from the head of the idol, and not from the head of the king.

Most think that Talent here is taken according to the Syrian weight, Some
think that the crown was 2250. pound according to the Syrian weight.
which was not above the quarter of an Hebrew talent, and which weighs of our
weight eleven pound and four ounces, and they think this the rather; because
Rabba in the country of the children of Ammon, lay in the country of Syria;
therefore it seems that they followed their weight.

Secondly, some answer that this crown was valued Some think that the crown
was valued according to the worth and not the weight.
in regard it was set with precious stones and jewels, it weighed so much, that
is, it was worth so much. Zach. 11.13. they weighed for my wages as much as I
was valued at, that is, thirty pieces of silver.



Things which have been the immediate instruments of Idolatry, may be used.
Again these things which have been the mediate instruments in the worshipping
of idols, these may be used; a church may be used although before idolatry
has been committed there: There was no mountain more defiled with idolatry
then the mount of Olives was, The Idol it self may not be used.
and therefore it was called mons corruptionis, 2. King. 23.13. and yet no
place where Christ prayed so often as there.

The idol it self may not be used, because it has been the immediate
instrument of idolatry; when soldiers do besiege a town and take it, they
pull down the trophies and colors of the enemies, but not the town it self,
the idols are the trophies, ensigns and colors of idolatry, and therefore to
be pulled down.

Deuteronomy. 12.2, 3. Ye shall verily destroy all the places wherein the nations,
which ye shall possess, serve their Gods. Then it may seem that the places
where idols have bin worshipped should be destroyed.

Moses judicial laws do not bind us as they did the Israelites.
This was a temporary ordinance, and a part of Moses policy which is now
abrogat, for howsoever the equity of this law remains, teaching us to detest
idolatry, yet it binds us not in such a manner to detest idolatry as they
did. Example, God commanded here to destroy idolatrous places, he commanded to
burn the cattle, spoil, and goods of the apostates; the equity of this
commandment teaches us to detest and abhor idolatry, but we are not bound
to follow it in the same manner.

The Lord commanded to consume the rest of the holy things, when the religious
use of them ceased, as to burn that which was left of the Pascha. Exodus 12.10.
So that which was left of the ram of consecration. Exodus 29.34. and so of the
flesh of the peace offering. Levit. 7.15. The equity of the judicial law
binds us now.
the equity of this ordinance continues for ever, teaching us how to regard
holy things with an higher estimation than common things, but we are not bound
according to the letter of the law to follow this; for the bread and the wine
remaining after the Sacrament should not be burnt; in these laws we must
look to the equity and substance, but not to the letter; and many things were
urged in Moses policy, which we are freed of now. Example, the Jews were
forbidden expressly to marie with the heathen, and if they had married such
heathen wives, and had begotten children upon them; yet they were commanded to
put them away again. Ezra. 10.11. Greater liberty to Christians under the
Gospel, then to the Jews under the Law.
But now a Christian has greater liberty. 2. Corinthians. 12.13, 14. An idolatrous
wife was not sanctified by her husband under Moses law, as she may be under the
gospel; God has changed the rigor of this law. Deuteronomy. 17.25. Not to take so
much as any thing belonging to idolatry, and turn it to a civil use. Josh.
7.1. It is now changed, and the abomination is taken away, we may eat now of
the idolothites, when they are not in the temple of the idols, which they might
not do under Moses law.

If the brazen serpent was abolished, why should not the place likewise where
idols have been worshipped, be abolished as well as images.



Things are idolatrous in state when they are in the act of idolatry, When a
thing is idolatrous in state.
but out of that act and place, and carrying no representation of the idol,
they cease to be idolatrous, and may be used. Example, no man might eat of
the flesh of the sacrifice when it was in idoleio in the place where the idol
was worshipped; yet the rest of the flesh, when it was sold in the shambles they
might eat of it: The superstitious Jews would drink no wine of the Gentiles.
for relata extra usum non sunt relata, the relation here cease betwixt the
flesh and the idol. Julian the apostate caused consecrate the whole flesh in
the shambles to the idols, thinking that none of the Christians would eat of
it; but the flesh in the shambles was extra usum, it but was idolatrous in the
temple of the idols, but not in the shambles.

Conclusion.
The Lord forbad the Jews libamina gentium, Deuteronomy. 32.37. but the Jews added
that they should drink none of the wine of the gentiles, that is, any meat or
drink dressed by them; and therefore at this day they will neither eat of the
christians meat, nor drink of their drink, but they will give of their meat
to the christians; it was only libamen, the idolatrous drink of the gentiles
which the Lord forbad them, but he forbad them not simply their meat and drink.

The conclusion of this is, as he who is chaste despises not only the harlot,
but also the favor of the harlot: so if we would eschew idolatry, we must not
only eschew idols, but also things dedicated to idols.

8.31. will interchange with man, he will both lend some things to him, and
borrow some things from him.

Some things are spoken properly, which arise either from his understanding or
from his will. Things arising from the understanding and will of God, are first
spoken properly of himself.
From the understanding, as his knowledge, and providence, these are first
spoken properly of God; and then attributed to man. So these which arise from
his will, as his goodness, mercy, and grace, he communicates himself by
creation to all his creatures; and therefore he is called the father of them.
Father properly is given to God.
Job. 38.28. Pater pluviae, the father of rain. This word father is properly
attributed to him. (...).
Ephesians. 3.15. Of whom all fatherhoods in heaven and earth are named, and it is
borrowed from him and given to creatures; either when men beget a son, or
when they make a thing, they are called the father of it. Genesis 4.20. borrowed
from him who is the father by eternal generation of his son; or father by
creation of all the creatures.

Somethings first proper to the creatures, and then attributed to God.
There are other things which are first proper to the creatures, and then
attributed to God by way of metaphor, such as are spoken of God (...) as when
we attribute hands, feet, and eyes to him. Secondly such things as are spoken
of him, (...), when the scripture brings in God angry after the manner of
man, Things proper to the creatures attributed to God three ways.
Psalm. 18.8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils. Thirdly these things
that are spoken of him (...), when passions are attributed to God after the
manner of men; and they are either simple or compounded passions: Simple, as
anger, hatred; compounded as jealousy, which is made up of love and hatred.

This word Kin signifies either to be jealous or zealous, (...) Zelotypus

evil sense. Number. 5.14. Vekinne eth ishto, (...)

Jealousy is a mixed affection of love and hatred, (...)
therefore it is called the fire of his jealousy. Zeph. 1.18. God, because he
has married the Church to himself, Jealousy what.

left she should go a whooring from him after other gods. In heaven he only
loves the triumphant Church, he is not jealous of her; in earth he is jealous
often times of his militant Church, but he hates her not; but he hates the
children of this world altogether.

A loving husband first begins to suspect his wife, How jealousy is bred,
and how it proceeds.
then he becomes jealous of her, and last he comes to hate her and cast her
off: but before he come to cast her off, hatred says, I will cast her off,
because she has played the harlot; but love says, I am loath to cast her off,
because she has been the wife of my youth. She is the mother of my children,
and so love prevails for a while, but at last when she continues in her
adulteries, then he turns her away, and gives her the bill of divorcement,
and hates her more than ever he loved her: so does God deal with his Church
before he cast her off.

This jealousy is a strong passion. Cant. 8.6. Jealousy is a strong and
rooted passion.
Jealousy is cruel as the grave: The grave spares no man, and there is no
redemption from the grave: So the jealous husband, nothing will satisfy him:
and as it is a dangerous thing to meet a bear robbed of her whelps. Prove.
17.12. and the revenger of blood in his heat. Deuteronomy. 19.6. So it is to meet a
jealous man in his rage. Why the offering of the adulterous woman is called the
offering of memorial.
Prove. 6.34. Jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the
day of vengance. He will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content
though thou give many gifts.

So this passion is a rooted passion: under the Law the sacrifice which was
offered for the woman suspected of adultery, is called oblatio recordationis,
the offering of memorial. Number. 5.18. in all other sacrifices iniquity was
purged and forgotten, but in this sacrifice the wrong is remembered, and they
say, there are three things which can hardly be cured, jealousy, frenzy, and
heresy.

The Lord sets this attribute of jealousy before the Church here, to warn
her to abstain from idolatry, and spiritual adultery. Why the Lord sets
this word jealousy to this commandment.
If the wife would remember the rage of her husband, it would terrify her; and
if she would remember his love, this would keep her in obedience: the
adulterous woman when she enticed the young man to adultery. Prove. 7.19. She
says, The man is not at home, he is gone a far journey, he has taken a
bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. She says,
the good man will come home, but not my jealous husband will come; neither
thinks she thus with her self, what if he come home and take me in the act
of adultery? A difference betwixt God the husband of his Church, and other
jealous husbands.


God is a jealous husband, mark a difference betwixt him and other jealous
husbands. Ier. 3.1. They say if a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
and become another man's wife, shall he return unto her again? shall not the
land be greatly polluted? but thou have played the harlot with many lovers,
yet return again to me, says the Lord; and if she will return to him as to
a father and guide of her youth, he promises to accept of her. Verse. 4.
Whereas no other husband may accept of his wife back again, after he has
put her away being married to another.

When the Church commits adultery whether cease she to be the spouse of
Christ or not?

She cease to be his spouse upon her part, The Church may cease to be a
spouse upon her part, but not upon Gods part.
because she has committed adultery; but so long as he gives her not the
bill of divorcement, he accounts of her as his spouse: therefore the Lord
says of Judah, Where is the bill of your mothers divorcement? Esaias. 50.1. (...)
aversatrix. (...) prevari^^trix.
as if he would say, I never gave her a bill of divorcement, but she went
willingly from me of her own accord, when I would have kept her still. Judah
and Israel are compared by the Prophet. Ier. 3.11. he called Israel Meshubha,
the backsliding Israel, and he calls Judah Bagodah, treacherous Judah, when
Israel fell away he gave the bill of divorcement to the ten tribes, but he did
not repudiate treacherous Judah for all her adulteries.

First he was the guide of her youth, When the Lord gave Israel the bill of
divorce.
and he loved her because he remembered still the kindenes of her youth, and the
love of her espousals. Ier. 2.2. that is, when he remembered the love of the
Patriarchs, and their sincerity in worshipping of him. Then they committed
adultery and fell away from him; yet they repented, therefore he cast them not
off; But after that they had crucified the Lord of glory, then Paul said, he
would go to the Gentiles. There was a little remnant of the Jews who believed
in Christ, they were to be gathered in, and to these Peter went to Babylon. 1.
Pet. 5.13. When he gave Judah the bill of devorce.
And a few in the West scattered abroad in Pentus, Asia, and Bithynia, and to
these Peter wrote. 1. Pet. 1.1. and about the time of the destruction of
Jerusalem the Lord gave them absolutely the bill of divorcement, and then he
counted them not a people.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
jealousy is only joined to the second commandment, he is angry for the
breach of any commandment, but he is jealous when his worship is corrupted,
and his glory given to creatures, wherefore this must be a high transgression.

EXERCITAT. XVI. The punishment for the breach of the second Commandment.
Exodus 20.5. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.
IN this threatening we have to consider what it is to visit here; secondly
what sins of the fathers the Lord visits upon the children; thirdly who are
meant by our fathers here; fourthly how the children are punished for their
fathers sins.

What the word Visit signifies.
To visit here is a speech borrowed from a Judge who uses to punish the evil
doers, and to reward those who do well; so the Lord the great Judge of the
world he punishes idolaters and their posterity, and he rewards the true
worshipers who keep his commandments, he visits in judgment, as he visited
the Egyptians, God visits sometimes in mercy and sometimes in judgment.
and he visits in mercy, as he visited the Israelites. Exodus 3.16.
visitando visitavi, I have surely visited you, that is, in mercy. So Genesis
21.1. The Lord visited Sara, as he had said, that is, he visited her in mercy.

Children have sin from their parents by propagation, or imitation.
He visiteh the sins. Sin is either the sin which the children have from
their parents by propagation, or by imitation; by propagation, as original
sin; by imitation, as their other personal sins. Here we must put a
difference betwixt that accident which is common to the nature of all men,
which is called accidens naturae; Accidens naturae. personae.

And a personal accident which is incident to some: The accident which is
common to the whole nature of man is always transmitted from the father to the
child, and shall continue to all the posterity of Adam, to the end. The most
filthy leprosy that is, and which runs long in a blood, yet in time will
wear away in the posterity; Original sin is alike in all the sons of men
both just and unjust,
but this original and hereditarie sin never wears out, but it continues
with all the children of men, and is alike in them all; the sons of the just,
and the sons of the unjust are both alike in this original sin.

But these which are personal accidents are not propagated from the father to
the son, Personal accidents are not propagated from the fathers to the
children.
especially the gifts of the mind; it may be, that a strong father begets a a
strong child, and the leprous father begets a leprous son, but neither the
defects nor the virtues of the mind are transmitted from the fathers to the
children, as the father who is a musician begets not his son a musician;
and the father who is wise, begets not always a wise child; as Solomon the
wisest man that ever was, had but a fool to his son, Rehoboam; therefore he
says, Eccles. 2.19. Who knows whether his son shall be a wise man or a fool.

Seeing Adam transmitted original sin to his posterity,

He got grace in his second estate, as a personal gift, Adam did not transmit
his righteousness to his posterity, because it was not natural, but
personal to him.
and therefore he could not transmit it to his posterity; but if he had stood
in integrity, he should have transmitted righteousness to his posterity,
because then it was natural to him, as when he fell he transmitted sin to his
posterity. And he begot a son in his own likeness after his image. Genesis
5.3.

This original sin the Lord may punish the children for it, if he would
deal in judgment with them, because it is found in all children transmitted
from their parents.

By sin here especially is meant idolatry, which by way of appropriation is
called sin, By sin here is chiefly meant Idolatry.

See Command. 2. Exer. 5. page 80.

By fathers are meant fathers natural, and by example.


as is shown before, God visits other sins also besides idolatry, As all
the blood shed from Abel to Zachary. Mat. 23.35.

By fathers here are meant not only natural fathers, but those who are
fathers by example, as Cain was a father, Core was a father, and Balaam was a
father. Jude 11. Woe unto them, for they have gone into the way of Cain, and
ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the
gainsaying of Core: and in this sense the devil is called a father. Ioh. 8.44.
Ye are of your father the devil.

Children by nature and imitation.
There are two sorts of children; children by nature, and children by imitation:
children by imitation are these of whom it is chiefly meant here, and they are
rather called their children whom they imitate, Children by imitation are
chiefly meant of here.
than their children who begot them. Example, Judge. 18.30. Jonathan the son
of Gershon, the son of Manasseh; this Jonathan was Moses natural grandchild
by generation, yet he is called the grandchild of Manasseh, because in
wickedness he followed Manasseh, and the Jews say, (...) See Exercitat. 10.
Page 95.
they would not write his name, the son of Gershon, the sone of Moses, for
that had been a disgrace to Moses, but they wrote him to be the son of
Manasseth, by lifting up a letter. And the Hebrews give another example like
unto this. Achaz King of Judah called king of Israel, and why.
2. Chron. 28.19. And the Lord brought Judah low, because of Achaz king of
Israel. Why is Achaz called king of Israel, here, seeing he was king of Judah?
they say, because he imitated the wicked kings of Israel in their wickedness.

He visits the sins of the fathers upon the children.

Deuteronomy. 24.16. The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither
shall the children be put to death for their fathers.

The Lord restrains here the power of the magistrate that he may not put the
children to death for their fathers offenses, as we see. 2. King. 14.16. The
Magistrate may not put the child to death for his fathers sin.
And they slew his servants who had slain the king his father, but the
children of the murderer he slew not, according to that which was written in
the Law, the children shall not be put to death for their fathers offenses.

The magistrate may not put the children to death for their fathers offenses,
See Iunis Analyzes in Levit. 20.20.
although he may punish them other ways; then it seems to be a strange
collection. Levit. 20.20. If a woman be begotten incestuously with child, then
she shall be burnt, non expectato partu, that is, before she be delivered of
the child.

But they shall die childlesse,

This cannot be the meaning of the place, The mother cannot be killed, the
child being quick in her belly.
that the mother and quick child shall be killed together; for the children
may not be put to death for the offense of their father or mother; but this
seems rather to be the meaning of the place, when the magistrate
understands once that a man had lain with his uncles wife, then he shall
presently cut them off, before the woman conceive, and so they shall die
without seed.

The Lord who is author of life and death, God may punish the children with
temporal punishments for their fathers sin.
he may punish the children for their fathers offenses with temporal
punishments, but he never punishes the children for their fathers offenses
with eternal punishments, unless they imitate their fathers sins.

It may be said that children are punished not only with temporal
judgments, Genesis 17.14. And the uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his
foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Here
the child may seem to be cut off for his fathers fault, because his father
neglected to circumcise him; and, to be cut off here, is a spiritual
judgment, to be cut off in the wrath of God.

praeputiatus masculus que non circumciderit caruem praeputij sui, (...) qui
non circumciderit, est sut. Kal, a (...) but the Vulgar Latin translation
makes it to be fut. Niphal a (...) qui non circumcisus fuerit.
but the vulgar Latin reads it; if he be not circumcised, he shall be cut off;
but the right reading is, he who circumciseth not the foreskin of his flesh, he
shall be cut off, for the text adds, he has broken my covenant, which cannot
be said of young infants, but of children when they are come to age and
understanding, and when they become (as the Jews say) filii praecepti, then if
they despise the covenant, they are to be cut off.

When children imitate their fathers sins, then the Lord punishes them:
Children imitate their fathers sins two ways.
Children imitate their fathers sins two ways, either affirmatively, or
negatively; affirmatively, when they begin to imitate their fathers sins in
their infancy and young years. Ier. 7.8. The children gather wood, and the
fathers kindle the fire, and the women kneade the dough to make cakes to the
queen of heaven; here they were initiated in their fathers idolatry. So when
the Israelites married with the wives of Ashdod, the children spoke the
language of Ashdod, imitating their fathers. Nehem. 13.24 Secondly, when they
come to a greater maturitie of age, and then they fill up the measures of their
fathers: Mat. 23.32.

Children are guilty of their fathers sins when they are not humbled for them.
Secondly they imitate their fathers sins negatively, that is, when they dissent
not from their fathers sins, and when they are not humbled for them; for if
such children had the occasions and temptations which their fathers had, they
would do as they did; and therefore justly their fathers sins may be laid
to their charge. Dan. 5.22. And thou his son, O Balshazzer, have not humbled
thine heart, though thou knew all this, meaning the sins of
Nebuchadnezzar, and the punishment of them; this should teach us to take notice
of the corruption of our nature, and how ready we are to follow others in
wickedness, and especially the sins of our parents; the blind Jews said,
if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets. Mat. 23.30.

Ye will say then,

They are their fathers sins occasionaliter, but they are their own sins
causaliter: occasionaliter, The sins of the fathers are the childrens
causaliter, but the fathers occasionaliter.
for God may take occasion by the fathers sins, to withdraw the grace from
his children, and then they are prone and ready to follow all the sins of
their fathers; when God punishes the children for their fathers sins, he
would never punish them if they were not sinners themselves; but he respects
more the sins of the fathers in punishing of them. Ioh. 9.3. Christ says of
the blind man, God would not punish children for their fathers sin if they
were not sinners themselves.
that it was neither for his own sins nor his fathers sins that he was
borne blind, but that the works of God might appear; if this man had not
been a sinner, he had not been borne blind; for blindness is a punishment
of sin: but yet when he made him blind, he respected not here his sin,
nor the sins of his fathers; but that the glory of God might appear: So when
God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, he would not punish
them unless they were sinners; but he respects more the sins of their
parents, than their own sins, when he punishes them; and the Lord punishes
the fathers sins in their children: God in punishing the children looks
more to their fathers sins than to their own.
the Lawyers say, if the father and the son be suspected of one crime, it is
fit that the son be put first to the torture, and they held that it will
make the father to confess sooner then if he were put to the torture himself.
See how David took on for Absalon, would to God O my son Absalon that I had
died for thee. 2. Sam 18.33. When the Lord punishes the children for their
fathers sins, their greatest punishment is their fathers.

When the fathers sins and the childrens sins meet together, then there is
a double punishment. Esaias. 40.2. She has received from the Lords hand,
Ciphlaijm, double for all her sins. (...) Duplicia pro omnibas peccati^, id
est, pro suis peccat^^. and pa^entum.


The Jews had a proverb in their mouths, The fathers have eaten sour grapes
and the childrens teeth are set on edge. Ezekiel. 18.2. Iere. 31.29. the Lord
says, they shall no more use this proverb, What is meant by the Jews
proverb, that the father eat sour grapes etc.
but the soul that sins shall die. They meant that they were carried away
in captivity for the sins of Manasseh. Ier. 15.4. which he did in Jerusalem:
the Lord promised that they should have no more cause to say so, For the soul
that sins shall die. To die, here, is taken for a temporal punishment, as
exile, famine and such, and not for spiritual death, for the Jews complained
only for their bodily chastisements and not for spiritual; and the Lord
answered that he would punish them no more so. God may justly set the
childrens teeth on edge for their fathers offenses, as he did before; and the
punishment of the Jews sins lies upon their posterity unto this day; but
the Lord promises, that their teeth should never be set on edge again, that
is, punished in the captivity of Babel.

B^as uses a profane compo^^on.
God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children: It was a profane
comparison of Bias the philosopher, who said, If the Gods should punish the
children for their fathers offenses, this were all one, as if a Doctor should
give the child physic when the father is troubled with the colicke or stone:
but this is a foolish comparison; let us then make the comparison this ways;
the father is a leper and he begets his son a leper, now if the Doctor
should prescribe physic to the son for his fathers leprosy, he should do
well; because it is both his fathers leprosy and his own leprosy.

When the children follow not the fathers in their sins, then the father is
said to die in his own sin. What it is to die in his own sin.
Number. 27.3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company
of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of
Korah, but died in his own sin. that is, in the common sin of murmuring with
the rest of the people; and it is called his own sin, because his children
followed him not in his rebellion. Number, 26.11. The children of Core died not.
But when the children follow the footsteps of their father, then they die in a
common sin.

The fathers sins are imputed to their children, Fathers should be ware to
bring punishments upon their children.
this should be a means to restrain fathers from sin, and it were but for
their childrens cause, to keep them from punishment: many parents are careful
to leave inheritance to their children, but oftentimes they leave their sins
to them. The legacy of Ioab.
It was a fearful legacy that Ioab left to his children, that some of them
should lean upon a staff, some of them should die of a bloody flixe, and some
of them of a leprosy, and some of them should beg their bread. 2. Sam. 3.29.
When a man dies and has nothing to leave unto his children but his sins, as
to one his blood, to another his swearing, and to another his adultery, is not
this a pitiful latter will and testament? Some leave lands to their children,
but withal they leave their fearful sins to them; and it were better for
them to want their lands, then to be heirs to their sins: Gehazi left a
talent of silver behind him to his posterity; but he left the leprosy with
it. 2. King. 5.27.

Children should confess their fathers sins.
The fathers sins are imputed to the children, therefore the children should
confess the sins of their fathers. Levit. 26.41. If they confess their
iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers. So Nehem. 1.6. Both I and my
fathers house have sinned; and this they are bound to do, as far as they can
come to the knowledge of their fathers sins: such sins of their fathers
they should confess, which they in their own proper persons have committed by
the example of their forefathers, for these sins they ought to crave pardon.
Psalm. 79.8. Remember not against us former iniquities, (...) iniquitates
Praecedentium
that is, the sins which we have committed before by imitating our fathers
sins: but we must take heed here, that we crave not pardon for our fathers
who are dead; for there is no remission, but that which is gotten in this life.

Lastly the Lord not only visits the sins of the fathers upon the
children, but also the sins of the mother. God visits not only the sins
of the fathers, but also the sins of the mothers upon the children.
Psalm. 109.14. Let not the sins of his mother be blotted out, but when the
father is an Amorite, and the mother a Hittite. Ezekiel. 16.3. that is worst of
all for the children: for if any of the parents be holy, then the child is
holy. 1. Cor. 7.14.





EXERCITAT. XVIII. Of the extent of Gods justice and his mercy to those who
break and keep his Commandments. Commandment II.
Exodus 20.5. Visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto thousands
of them that love me and keep my Commandments.
THe Lord visits the iniquity of the fathers unto the third and fourth
generation, in the original it is, in tertianos and quartanos. So, 2. King.
10.30. Filij quartani sedebunt super solio: Thy children of the fourth
generation shall fit on thy throne, that is, Iehoachaz, Iehoash, Jeroboam, and
Zachariah; the father is the first, the son is the second, the grandchild is
the third, and the great grandchild is the fourth; and he sets down the
third and fourth generation, Why the Lord punishes unto the third and fourth
generation.
because men may live to see so many generations come of them. Genesis 50.23. And
Joseph saw Ephraims children to the third generation, that is, he saw Ephraim,
and his sons, and his sons sons.

It pleases God in mercy to break off the course of sin, and to interrupt
it for the Churches cause; God breaks off the course of sin sometimes, his
Churches cause.
Korah was a bad man, yet his sons were men fearing God, who wrote some of
the Psalms.

Where the course of sin is broken off, Where sin is broken off the
punishment will be broken off.
there the punishment is not inflicted; the grandfather is a wicked man, his
son follows not his footsteps, the grandchild again follows the
footsteps of his grandfather, here the sin which was broken off begins
again and continues still with the grandchild. Manasseh had his sin
pardoned, but his son Ammon walking in the former ways of his father, became
heir of his fathers wickedness; therefore God deferred not the punishment, for
within two years after he was king, he was miserably killed: Then Josias
succeeded who brake off the course of his fathers sin; and therefore the
punishment was deferred for the space of thirty one years. Then his younger
brother Ioahaz succeeded to him, and the punishment was continued in him, and
likewise in his eldest son Eliacim.

In lib. de sera vindicta Numin^s.
Plutarch shows why the Gods defer punishment for a time; because the sin
is not found in the child, which was found in the father; and when the same
sin buddeth fo^^h again in the grandchild, then the gods do punish: and he
uses this comparison, for even, says he, as the grandfather had a mole upon
his face, which is not seen in his son, Simile.
but yet it is seen in the grandchild; passing by his son, it comes to the
grandchild: So may sin pass by the son and come to the grandchild: and he
tells of a woman who brought forth a blackmore, when as neither of the
parents were blackmores, and being condemned to die as an adulteress, an old
man testified there, that the great grandfather of that child was a
blackemore, and that his blacknes had passed by two generations, Sin may
pass by two generations and come to the third.
and come to the third: so sin may pass from one or two generations, and
light upon the third; and where sin is continued there the punishment
lights.

Sometimes sin continues in a blood.
Sometimes ye shall see sin continued, going on in a blood without any
interruption. Rebekah thought that Esau would have forgotten that which Jacob
did to him. Genesis 27.45. but he never forgot it, and that hatred continued in
his posterity the Edomites without interruption, and they cried; Psalm. 137.7.
Down with them, down with them.

He visits to the third and fourth generation for idolatry, God sometime
continues punishment longer than to the third and fourth generation.
but he continues the punishment some times longer than to the third and
fourth generation. Ezekiel. 4.5. I have laid upon thee the years of their
iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundredth and ninety
days, so shall thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel: three hundredth
and ninety prophetical days are taken here for years; and he speaks here
of the idolatry which began in Salo^^ns old age, and continued until the
ninth year of (...) captivity, just three hundredth and ninety years in all;
and as all the blood from Abel to Zachary might be required at the hands of
the Jews in Christ's time: So may the Lord lay upon the idolaters now, all the
idolatry from the first idolaters to this time, if he would deal in justice
with them; and hence it follows, that the idolaters who lived three hundred
years since, were not in so miserable a case as the idolaters are in now;
Idolaters in our times are in a worse case then they of old.
because they had not so many sins to be laid to their charge.

Of them that hate me:

How can God be hated,

The idolaters do not hate God simply as he is good, How a man is said to hate
God.
so Ahab hated Micaiah because he told him the truth, and Paul said, am I
become your enemy, because I told you the truth. Gal. 4.16.

To hate God and to love idols, are directly contrary; but for a man to hate
himself, To hate God and love our selves are directly contrary.
to the end he may love God, are subcontrary; when a man loves himself
less, that he may love the Lord, this is but improperly called hatred, and so
Jacob hated Leah, that is, To hate our selves, and love God are subcontraries.
he less loved her than Rachel; but when a man loves God less then his
idol, that is properly called hatred.

Now to keep our selves that we fall not into this hatred of God by loving
idols, Idolaters look not straight upon God.
we must lift up our eyes and look straight from the creatures to God, and
from God to the creatures; and then we shall not fall to idolatry. Quando
linea currit aequaliter inter duo extrema, and we look straight by the line
to the two extremes, then we see them perfectly; but when we look not
equally upon them, but a squint; then we have not a perfect view. Idolaters
never look aright upon God and his creatures, and therefore they give the
honor to the creature which is due to the creator, but if they would compare
God with the poor creatures, they would never give his glory unto them.

And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
commandments.

God enclineth more to mercy then justice.
Gods justice reaches unto the third and fourth generation, but his mercy to
the thousand generation; and hence we may gather, that God inclines more to
mercy than to justice, and therefore when he punishes he is said, Facere opus
non suum, quid.
facere opus non suum. Esaias. 28.21. That he may do his strange work, that
is, to punish.





The blessing of the fathers are conveyed to good children.
Showing mercy unto thousands, this blessing of God is conveyed by good parents
to the children, for the more good predecessors that a man has, he may look
for a greater blessing. We have an example of this. Genesis 49.26. The blessings
of thy fathers are strong with the blessings of my progenitors, all the
blessings of the good predecessors concurring together, are effectual means
to continue the blessing to the posterity.

To thousands, the Lord will not forget thee, although thou be many generations
after thy good predecessors, God forgets not the children of good parents to
many generations.
David made inquiry for Ionathans posterity that he might do good unto them.
2. Sam. 9.1. Is there any left of the house of Saul, that I may show him
kindness, for Ionathans sake. The Lord blessed the posterity of Ionadab, the
Rehabits, for their godfathers cause.

Of them that love me and keep my commandments. Our best works have need of
mercy.
Hence we may learn, if men's best works have need of mercy, then no man can
be justified by his works, for mercy secludeth merit. Hos. 10.12. Sow to
your selves in righteousness, and reap in mercy; the Church must look for
mercy when she is reaping her reward. So, 2. Tim. 1.16. The Lord give mercy
unto the house of Onisephorus, for he has often refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chains.

Showing mercy. Exodus 23.19. God shows mercy without merit. (...)
Supplicationes eloquitur pauper.
I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, that is, I will have mercy
without any merit. Prove. 18.23. The poor uses entreaties. Tahhannunim, that
is, they beg only of favor, but nothing of merit. So when we have done all
things that we can do, let us count our selves unprofitable servants. Luc.
17.10.

And keep my commandments, God shows mercy and then we keep his
Commandments.
the Lord must first show mercy before we can keep his commandments; we
keep not his commandments first, and then he shows mercy, all the good of
the Church depends upon Christ, and if he show not mercy, then she is not a
Church. The Church has been fitly compared to Heliotropion, or the marigold,
so long as the sun shines upon it, so long it spreads the leaves of it;
but when the sun withdrawes it self, then it contracteth the leaves and
spreads no more. So does the Church flourish when the Lords mercy shines
upon her; but when he withdrawes his presence from her, she loses her beauty.

And keep my commandments. The children of God keep the commandments
because the Lord freeth them of the straight obedience of the law, non (...),
it lies not upon them, nor urges them, as it does upon the wicked, Justice non
est lex posita, the law is not made for the righteous man. God enableth his
children to keep his Commandments.
1. Tim. 1.9. It lies not like a burden upon them, God accepts of their
endeavors, although they come short in many things.

Secondly, in keeping the law the spirit of God both jubet and juvat, he
commands his children, and gives them the spirit of obedience to do those
things, which he commands, willingly.

God takes away the irritation of the Law from his children.
Thirdly, he takes away the irritation of the law; for the law to a natural
man is a provocation to sin. Romans 7. and so the law becomes easy to them,
and thus they are said to keep the commandments. Conclusion.


The conclusion of this is, Miserable is the case of idolaters, who must both
answer for their own sins, and likewise for the idolatry of their
predecessors.

Commandment III.
Exodus 20.7. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
FIrst the commandment is set down here, and secondly the reason of the
commandment. The commandment, Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain; the reason of the commandment, for the Lord will not hold him
guiltless that takes his name in vain. What it is to take Gods name in vain.


Thou shall not take, that is, thou having no calling, thou shall not take his
name in thy mouth to swear by it; and so Christ says to Peter, all they that
take the sword, shall perish by the sword. Mat. 26.52. that is, they who have
no calling to take the sword, if they take the sword they shall die by it; so
he that takes Gods name in his mouth to swear by it, and is not called to
swear, he takes the name of God in vain; and the Hebrews observe, that
Nisbang signifies to be sworn, (...) potius passive hic sumitur quam active
rather then to swear; which implies that a man should not swear but when an
oath is laid upon him.

Secondly thou shall not take, (...) proprie Onus tollere.
Nasha is to lift or take up a thing of weight, as tollere parabolam, To take
up a proverb. Esaias. 14.4. to take up a lamentation, Ezekiel. 26.17.

In vain, Leshave, and Levit. 19.12. it is, Ye shall not swear by my name,
(...)
Leshakar, falsely.

The negative part of this commandment forbids first the superstitious
abusing of the name of God. Secondly, it forbids the deceitful and
superstitious abuse of the name of God. Thirdly, imprecations and cursings.
Fourthly, perjurie. Fifthly, blasphemy.

The affirmative part commands to use Gods titles and names reverently, in an
oath to observe verity, righteousness and judgment. So to vow, etc.

EXERCITAT. I. How the Jews superstitiously abused the name of God Iehova.
Commandment III.
Levit. 24.11. And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
Lord.
THe Jews had this name Iehova at the first in (...), secondly in (...) first
they reverenced this name, and then superstitiously abused it.

First they had a more religious and reverent respect to this name, because it
was Zecer, memoriale ejus, his memorial. (...) Memoriale. (...) Nomen
separatum. (...) Nomen gloriosum. (...) Nomen benedictum.
Exodus 3.14. This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all
generations: Secondly, because this name Iehova was the name of Gods essence,
they did the more sparingly express it, and they called it Shem hamphorash,
nomen separatum, a separate name, because it was incommunicable to any other
creature, so they called it Shem hammichbad, nomen gloriosum, and Shem
ijthbarek, nomen benedictum.

Secondly they express this name but seldom, because they could not tell how
to pronounce it, for it is not pointed with the own vowels of it in the
scripture, but only with the vowels of Adonai, or Elohim, the Greeks have no
letter to pronounce it aright, and therefore it is called (...); for these
respects at the first it was but seldom pronounced, and the first who
pronounced Iehova, Who pronounced the name Iehova amongst the Christians first.
amongst the Christians was Petrus Galatinus following the pronunciation of the
Syriacks and the Greeks, but if ye would pronounce it according to the own
letters, it should be Iahvo, as (...)

Afterward the Jews fell in (...), superstitiously abusing this name; and
first they say; that the Israelitish woman's son was stoned to death, because
he blasphemed the name of God, that is, because he pronounced the name Iehova:
Onkelos paraphraseth it, quod expresserit nomen Iehova, and the Seventy, Quod
(...) he named the name, to with, Iehova. (...)


Then they sell into greater superstition, they say, The superstitious abuse of
the name of Iehova.
the high Priest pronounced this name Iehova ten times in the day of expiation;
thrice in his first confession. Levit. 16.6. which was private; thrice in his
second confession, which was public. Levit. 16:24. and thrice upon the
skape-gate. Levit. 16.21. and once in casting of lots. Levit. 16.9. So they
say, the Priest who blessed the people, if he was out of the temple and blessed
the people, then his blessing was pronounced as three blessings, and the people
answered, amen, at every blessing, but when he pronounced it in the temple, he
pronounced it as one blessing: When he blessed out of the temple, they say,
that he expressed the blessing by the name Adonai; but in the temple, by the
name Iehova: when they blessed out of the temple, they lifted but their hands
to their shoulders, but when they blessed in the temple, they lifted their
hands above their heads, except only the high priest; when he blessed, they
say of him, that he lifted not his hands to his head, because the name Iehova
was written in a plate of gold upon his forehead; therefore in reverence to
this name he would not lift his hands to his head.

Again they say, when the witnesses testified against the blasphemer, that he
had pronounced the name Iehova, the Judges enquired not of them, whether heard
ye this man swear by the name Iehova, but by the name Iose; and the witness
said, percussit Iose Iosem, the blasphemer pierced God, naming him by his own
name: (...) Perfodiens a (...) perforare.
and this they called properly Nakabh, perforare, the piercing of the side of
God, but when the people were dismissed, they keept still the witnesses; they
enquired not then of the witnesses, whether the blasphemer had blasphemed the
name of Iose or not; but the judges said unto them, tell us what ye heard; and
the witnesses said, we heard him distinctly pronounce the name Iehova; then the
judges rent their clothes, and so afterward the man was stoned to death; and
thus superstitiously they abused this name.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, two extremities would be shunned in taking Gods name
in our mouths, first that we profanely abuse not this name by cursing, and
next that we superstitiously abuse it not.

EXERCITAT. II. Of the Jews superstitious and deceitful oaths. Commandment
III.
Mat. 23.16. Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever
shall swear by the gold of the temple is a debtor.
THere is no people that abuses the name of God more than the Jews do,
applying these titles and speeches which belong only to God, unto men; The
Jews abuse the names and attributes of God.
for when they write their familiar epistles to their friends, commending their
friends epistle or letter which they have received, they say, Eloquia Domini,
eloquia pura, giving that commendation to their epistles, which is due only to
the law of the Lord. Again, when they flatter their friends, desiring that
they may be entire with them, then they abuse the scripture; pateat accessus
ad adytum sanctitatis tuae, they crave access to his holiness, which is
proper only to God. Thirdly, when they would testify themselves thankful,
The Jews abuse the Scriptures.
they say, Nomini tuo psallam, I will sing O Lord unto thy name. Fourthly, when
they complain that their friends have forsaken them, and are not kind unto
them, then they say, Cum exercitibus nostris non egrederis Domine, Lord thou
go not out with our armies. Fifthly, when they bid their friends unto a
wedding or a banquet, they say, In te speravi Domine, non confundar, I have
trusted in thee, O Lord, let me not be confounded. Thus we see how these
blind wretches abuse the scriptures, and take the name of God in vain, and we
see how Christ blames them. Mat. 5. for swearing by the creatures.

The Jews thought it lawful to swear by the heavens.
To prove that it was lawful to swear by the heavens, they abused these
scriptures. Amos 4.2. The Lord did swear by his holiness, that is, by the
heavens (say they) whereas the Prophet meant that he swore by himself. So,
Amos 8.7. The Lord has sworn by the excellency of Jacob: the Jews took it
for his temple and not for himself, whereas he swore by himself, because he
had no greater to swear by. Heb. 6.13. So they used to swear deceitfully, How
they did sophisticate their oaths.
and to sophisticate their oaths. Mat. 23.16. When they swore by the temple,
they said, it was nothing; but to swear by the gold of the temple, then he was
a debtor. So if he swore by the altar, it was nothing; but to swear by the
gift upon the altar, then he was a debtor, but Christ shows them, that to
swear by the temple, The Jews swore by the Temple.
was greater than to swear by the gold of the temple; for the temple
sanctified the gold, therefore it is greater than the gold: so the altar
sanctified the gift upon the altar, and therefore it was a greater sin to
swear by the altar, than by the gift upon the altar.

The Prophet Haggai propounded a question to the Priests. Hagg. 2.12. If one
bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt does touch
bread or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? and the
Priests answered and said, no? Then said Haggai, if one that is unclean by a
dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? and the Priests answered
and said, it shall be unclean. If a holy thing touch that which is common,
will it make it holy? No: if an unclean thing touch a clean thing, will it
make it unclean? Yes: but here when the altar touched the gift, it sanctified
it more, and made it holy. And here is the difference betwixt legal
sanctification and Christ's blood purging us; for Christ's blood when it touches
us, it makes us holy, but it becomes not unclean, whereas these things which
were holy under the law, might be polluted by unclean things.

The form of the oath amongst the Jews at this day, is this, How the Jews
swear, and the manner of their oath.
when he swears he holds the book of the law in his hand, and he swears
in the holy tongue after this manner. I Abraham swear by the God of Israel,
and by him who is long suffering and merciful, that I owe nothing to this man
N. and the Judges say unto him again, We attest thee by the great Lord,
whether there be any thing in thy hand which belongs to that man. And when
the curse of the law is pronounced, he answers, Amen, Amen.

They have learned this trick at this day, They will keep no oath unless
they swear upon their own Torah.
they hold that no oath binds them, but when they lay their hand upon their
own Torah, that is, the book which is read in their own Synagogues; but if
they lay their hand upon any other bible before a Christian Magistrate; they
will readily forswear themselves, therefore sundry towns in Germany
understanding this, How Christians make the Jews to swear.
the Magistrates will not take an oath of them, until the Torah, their bible
be brought out of their Synagogues, and then they make them lay their hand
upon it and swear. Moreover in the day of their expiation, their Rabbi do
absolve them from their perjuries, and all their deceits which they have used
against the Christians; and they say, Optimus qui inter gentes est, dignus est
cui caput conteratur tanquam serpenti, the best of the Christians is worthy to
be trod upon, as the head of the serpent.

They will give their oath willingly in no other language but in the Hebrew
tongue; The Jews will not swear willingly but in the Hebrew tongue.
and they allege that place of Esaias for them. Esaias. 19.18. In that day shall
five cities speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts.
And they say if the Egyptians must swear in the language of Canaan, then all
people should swear in that language, and they account all other languages but
the language of Ashdod. Neh. 13.24. and especially the Latin tongue, which
they hate above all other; but our Lord sanctified the Latin tongue as well as
the rest, upon the cross.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, Those who know not Jesus Christ the angel of the
covenant, in whom the Lord has put his name, Exodus 23.21. will never sanctify
him in his attributes.

EXERCITAT III. What great sin it is to curse God. Commandment III.
Hebrai^e, Bless God and die.
Job. 2.9. Then said his wife unto him, do thou still retain thine
integrity? Curse God and die.
WE may learn from the example of God himself not to use imprecations and
curses; for when the holy Ghost uses an oath, he concealeth the imprecation
and expresses it by Im Lo, (...) Si non
Si non, as Psalm. 89.35. Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto
David, that is, I have sworn that I will not lie unto David. God when he
swears expresses not the curse.
So Psalm. 95.11. Unto whom I swear in my wrath, if they enter into my rest,
that is, I have sworn that they shall never enter into my rest. When the Lord
pronounced this oath negatively, then it is to be understood as an
affirmation, as Esaias. 14.24. The Lord of hosts has sworn, if not, so it
shall come to pass, that is, it shall certainly come to pass: but when he
sets it down affirmatively, then it is to be understood negatively, as
Psalm. 95.11. If they shall enter into my rest, that is, they shall never enter
into my rest.

When God swears by himself this ways cum reticentia, he holds back the
curse; Why God keeps up the execration when he swears.
because no execration or curse can fall upon him, and therefore it cannot be
expressed which never falls out, neither should this sort of speech be
supplied, as some do profanely, non ero Deus, or such.

Whether are these words, Psalm. 110.1. The Lord said unto my Lord, an oath or a
simple asseveration?

Although the word seem to be set down simply; (...) includit juramentum.
yet in effect, it is the Lords oath here, and verba nefasta, or the execration
are concealed.

So when men use these imprecations, they conceal the curse, as Genesis 14.23. If
I take from a thread, to a shoe latchet; in the blessings we should express
them. Iam. 4.15. Ye ought to say, if the Lord will, we shall live, and do this
or that. And not only religious Abraham suppresseth the curse, but even wicked
and profane Iezabel, when she swore by her idol she concealed the curse, So
let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life, The devil a
cursed creature, yet dares not be bold to express the curse.
as the life of one of these by to morrow. 1. King. 19.2. And not only
idolaters, but the devil himself suppresseth it. Job. 1.11. If he curse thee
not to thy face.

They express not the curse to come upon themselves but upon others, Pharaoh
expressed the curse which he wished to light upon the Israelites.
as Pharaoh in effect expressed the curse when he said, Exodus 10.10. Let the
Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, that is, I pray God that the Lord
be no more with you, than I shall let you go, this was an imprecation or curse
which he wished to come upon them; because he purposed not to let them go.

Psalm. 131. The people in the captivity seem to have expressed the curse: If I
do not remember thee, O Jerusalem, then let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth.

This imprecation was not expressed when they were scoffingly urged by the
Babylonians to sing, when the psalm was penned in remembrance of their
mockery; The Jews did not express this as a curse, but as a memorial of
mockery of the heathen.
as if they should say, the Babylonians desired of us songs of mirth when we
were in sadness; but we had rather that our right hand had dried up, and our
tongue had cleaved to the roof of our mouth, than that we had pleased them in
singing.

Psalm. 7.4. If I have done this, then let my enemy pursue my life, it might
seem here that David expresses the curse.

David expressed not the curse here, but defended his innocence, and desired to
be freed of his enemies, as if he should say, David expresses not the curse,
but defends his innocence.
If I have done these things, then they might have had just cause to pursue me,
but seeing I am not guilty of any such thing, but rather I may say I have
deserved well of their hands; therefore I desire thee O Lord that thou would
free me from them.

The Scripture expresses cursing by blessing, in reverence of God.
When the scripture speaks any thing which might seem to impare the holy name
of God, it expresses it by the contrary, as Naboth has blessed God for cursed
God. 1. King. 22.13. So Job. 2.9. So Psalm. 10. avarus benedicit; Targum,
blasphemat.

to bless here, to be taken ironice, per Antiphrasim, or per Euphemismum.

How to know when a word is spoken nonice or by way of mocking. (...) Meretrix
a (...) sanctificare
That which is spoken ironice, we know the contrary is meant ex gestu
loquentis, and forma sermonis; as when Christ said to his disciples, sleep
henceforth; but that which is spoken per antiphrasin, is not known by the
gesture of the speaker, but by the words themselves; as the whore is called
Kedeshah from Kadash sanctificare, because she is not holy: So Deuteronomy. 22.9. Thou
shall not sow thy vinyard with diverse seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which
thou have sown, and the fruit of thy vinyard be sanctified, that is, defiled.
So auri sacra fames, id est, detestanda, so St Antonies fire is called sacer
ignis.

Euphemismus quid.
But Euphemismus is, when we express things that are odious by good and holy
words; and as the scripture expresses filthy things by holy words, so it
expresses odious things by holy words, and this the scripture does, both for
the honor of God, and to show the purity and holiness that is in the
scriptures themselves, as here, bless God and die, for curse God, So 1. Sam.
14.41. Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel, show who is innocent,
that is, who is guilty, so the Latins call Scelus, piaculum.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
let us learn to sanctify God in our hearts, and speak reverently of him
with our tongues; man's tongue is called Cabhod, his glory, Genesis 49.6. and Psalm.
16.9. because it should be the instrument to praise God, and set forth his
glory; but oftentimes it becomes a weapon of unrighteousness, and a member
which dishonors God most, and whereas it should be their glory, it becomes
their shame. Philip. 3.19.

EXERCITAT. IIII. That men should not curse the creatures of God. Commandment
III.
2. Sam. 1.21. Yet mountains Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
be any rain upon you, nor fields of offerings.
GOd who created his creatures has only power to curse them, for ejus est
ligare cujus est solvere; God has only power to curse the creatures.
God curses the reasonable creature for his sin, and the unreasonable and
senseless creatures, for the sin of man, Psalm. 107.33. He turns rivers into
a wilderness, and the water springs into dry ground: Creatures are cursed for
man's sin.
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell
therein, and God cursed the fig tree, that it might be an exemplar to the
Jews. David cursed the mountains of Gilboa to be barren, because of the
blood that was shed there: when a man was killed under the law, and they knew
not who killed him, the elders of the next city were commanded to take a
heifer, and bring it into a rough valley, How the place was barren where the
uncertain murder was committed.
which is neither eared nor sown. Deuteronomy. 21.4. that is, which should become
rough afterward, and should not be eared nor sown; for the innocent blood
that was shed there procured this barrenness: So did it upon the mountains of
Gilboa.

We must neither curse the reasonable, nor unreasonable creatures, for then a
man desires the Lord but to execute his sinful passion, and he makes
himself both judge and party here.

We may not curse the reasonable creatures.
We must not curse the reasonable creatures, nor use imprecations against them;
because it is a fearful sin. We have an example of this. (...) Per me jurant,
id est, faciunt de nomine meo juramenti, and execrationis formulam, sic Number.
5.27. and Esaias 65:15.
Psalm. 102.8. By Nishbagnu, jurant in me, that is, they wish all evil to
befall me, that I may become an execration. It was the manner of the Jews when
they wished any good thing to a man, they made choice of some notable good
person, and they desired that the person to whom they wished well might be like
such a man, or such a woman. As Ruth 4.11. The Lord make the woman that is come
into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of
Israel.

The people of the Jews took a good or vile person to be a pattern of their
blessing or cursing.
So when they cursed, they made choice of some vile man to make him a pattern,
as it were, of the curse. Ier. 29.22. The Lord make the like Zedekiah, and like
Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire. So the woman that was guilty
of adultery was a curse amongst the people. Number. 5.27. And here they use
cursing against David, that he might become so miserable, as to be a pattern
or example of misery, so that all men might say when they cursed; The Lord
make thee like David.

So we may not curse the unreasonable or senseless creatures, We may not curse
the senseless creatures.
because this curse redoundeth to the Lord himself; and as he who mocketh the
poor, reproacheth his maker. Prove. 17.5. so he that curses the creatures, in
effect, he curses the creator who made them.

So to curse the creatures as they have relation to man, Not to curse the
creatures as they have relation to man.
is a great sin, he that wishes evil to the creatures, wishes evil to
the man himself; the Lord forbids in his law to curse the deaf or the
blind. Levit. 14.19. the unreasonable and senseless creatures are deaf, and
therefore we should not curse them; and if the Lord would open the mouth of
these creatures, and make them to speak as he did Balaams Ass; they would
say, am not I thy horse or ass, why do thou curse me?

Contrary to this cursing, The manner how the people of God blessed others when
they did meet.
is that custom which was used amongst the people of God (...) Let not this
befall thee. Luc. 20.16. So David blessed Abigail. 1. Sam. 25.32. Blessed be
the Lord who has sent thee to meet me, and blessed be thy advice, and blessed
be thou. So to bless men in their lawful callings. Psalm. 129.8. The blessing
of the Lord be upon you. So Ruth 2.4. Beaz came from Bethleem and said unto the
reapers, the Lord be with you; and they answered him; The Lord bless thee.

The Prophets and Apostles had a singular warrant to curse both the reasonable
and unreasonable creatures, The Prophets and Apostles had a warrant to curse.
as Peter said to Simon Magus, Thy money perish with thee. Act, 8.20.

First, they when they cursed, The Prophets and Apostles had the spirit of
discerning when they cursed.
had the gift of discerning of spirits, and they knew who were reprobates, and
against these they used most fearful imprecations of eternal damnation, as
against Doeg, Achitophel, and Judas, that Psalm. 109. from Verse. 6. to the end
is a terrible imprecation, which David used against Doeg, because he caused the
Priests to be slain; The fearful curse which David pronounced against Doeg.
first against Doeg himself, Verse. 6, 7. then against his family, Verse. 8, 9.
then against his name, honor and goods: Verse. 11, 12, 13. and against his
eternal salvation. 14, 15. Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan stand
at his right hand. Set thou the wicked man over him, the Caldee Paraphrast
paraphraseth it, Set thou the devil over him, who is the father of
wickedness, and Satan he takes not for an adversary, but properly for Satan,
as Zach. 3.1. And because these were castawayes and reprobates: Judas went to
his own place. Act. 1.25. therefore the Lord by the mouth of his Prophets,
denounced these terrible imprecations against them.

Luc. 9.54. they spoke here in sinful passion; how did the Prophets then, and
Apostles curse without sin?

Jeremiah, as a Prophet denounced many threatenings against the wicked enemies
of the Church; yet through passion and perturbation, not as a Prophet, he uses
many sinful imprecations. Ier. 20. The children of God glory in their
tribulations. Jeremiah cursed in passion.
Romans 5.3. but Jeremy fretted in his tribulations: Christ says, when a man
chid is borne into the world there is joy; but Jeremy cursed the day of his
nativity, which was the creature of God, and he cursed the man likewise that
brought the news; whereas he that brings good news should be blessed,
wherefore he spoke these things in passion, and not as a Prophet of God.

The Prophets of God when they cursed, When the Prophets cursed, they had an
eye to the glory of God, and good of his Church.
they had an eye still to the glory of God, that his justice might appear in
the punishment of wicked men, and the Church might be edified by their
punishments. Psalm. 59.11. Slay them not, left my people forget, scatter them
and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

Thirdly, the Prophets used these imprecations that they might vindicate their
ministry. If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and
consume thee and thy fifty. 2. King. 1.10.

Fourthly, they used these imprecations that the Church might be kept in
purity; Moses was the meekest man in the earth, yet he says, Smite through the
loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise
not against him. Deuteronomy. 33.11. The Prophets curses are to be taken for
predictions for the most part.


Lastly, many of their curses are to be taken rather as predictions than
curses, as David's cursing of Ioabs posterity, and it was but for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the
Lord. 1. Cor. 5.5. So Paul delivered Hymeneus and Alexander unto Satan, that
they might not learn to blaspheme. 1. Tim. 1.20.

What use should the Church make now of these imprecations?

They may apply them against the enemies of the Church in general, but not in
particular.

Seeing particular men may not curse, Particular men may not curse now.
Meroz. Judge. 5.23.

This cursing was but an approbation of the curse which was already denounced
against Meroz.

The conclusion of this is, let us bless and not curse. How the people cursed
Meroz.
Romans 12.14. Let us remember what tribes stood upon mount Ebal to curse the
people, they were the children of the bond woman, for the most part; but those
who are borne of the free woman stood upon the mount Gerazim to bless; they
who curse are but the children of the bond woman, and shall be cast out of the
inheritance, and shall not inherit with the free woman's children.

EXERCITAT. V. Of perjury. Commandment. III.
Ezekiel. 17.16. As I live, says the Lord God, surely in the place where the king
dwells that made him king whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he
brake; even with him in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
THe Lord threatened here a judgment upon Zedekiah, because he break his oath
to Nabuchadnezzar who made him king, and because he brake the Lords own oath,
and the Lords covenant. Ezekiel. 17.19. therefore he should die in the midst of
Babylon.

Perjurie a great sin.
This perjurie is a high degree of taking of the name of God in vain; for when
a man promises by an oath, he lays both Gods verity and justice to pledge;
and God, as it were, lays his credit in pledge for him. David desired the
Lord to be surety for him. Psalm. 119.122. (...) Sponde pro servo suo in bonum.
Be surety for thy servant for good. In a promissory oath the Lord is surety
for a man, and gives his word for him; now if he break his oath, then he
breaks to the Lord, and makes his name to be evil spoken of.

Secondly, when man swears, he binds himself to bring forth all that
which he knows, and to perform that which he promised; and therefore the
oath is called vinculum animae, the bond of the soul. An oath is the bond of
the soul. (...)
Number. 30.2. If a man swear to bind his soul with a band. Now when he has
no care to perform his oath, it is evident that there is neither truth nor
verity in the mind. (...) Obligatione oblagando animam suam.


Thirdly, these three go always together, verity in an assertory oath,
fidelity in a promissory oath, and an execration, if it be not performed.

In a promissory oath there is double verity, first when a man makes an oath
and is minded to perform it, and secondly when he performs it; A double
verity in a promissorie oath.
if a man promise a great thing or a little, and is minded to perform neither
of them, he is a liar equally in both, as it is an assertory oath; for all
lies, considered in themselves, All lies considered in themselves are alike.
are equal, and none of them is greater than another: the liars of Pambiditha
said, that they could make a camel go through a needles eye; if another liar
should say, that he could make a mouse go through a needles eye, the one is
not a greater lie than the other: so if one should swear to give an hundred
pound, and another should swear to give ten pound, but yet neither of them are
minded to perform this; both these lies are alike, as they are assertory, one
of them is not greater than the other; but if ye will respect the performing of
these two, the performing or not performing of them are not alike; for if a man
withhold an hundredth pound which he promises to give to a poor man, and he
does not perform it; his sin is greater than the sin of him who promises
ten pounds, and withholds it. Justice and judgment how they are taken.


This oath must be in truth, justice, and judgment. Ezekiel. 4.3. When justice
and judgment are joined together in the scriptures, then justice is commonly
understood of civil affairs, and judgment of criminal. Psalm. 89.14. Justice
and judgment are the habitation of thy throne, they are verba forensia. 2.
Sam. 8.15. And David reigned over all Israel, and David executed judgment and
justice unto all his people. So Iam. 2.13. He shall have judgment without
mercy, who shows no mercy, here it is taken for the execution of judgment;
Now when the Lord commands that we should swear in truth, in justice and
judgment. Ier. 4.3. it is meant that we should testify the truth both in
civil and criminal causes. When Zedekiah had given his hand to
Nebuchadnezzar. Ezekiel. 17.18. and sworn obedience to him, and brake his oath,
then he failed in justice.



When a man is bound to perform his promissory oath.
the woman breaks to the man, here the man is free of his promissory oath;
but if there be not reciprocatio, a mutual dealing in the same case, then the
bond is not loosed. Example, John sw^reth by an oath to give Thomas so much
money, Thomas again swears to him that he will give him so many oxen, but
not for the money, John breaks to Thomas, and gives him not the money; the
question is whether Thomas be free of his oath in promising him the oxen? the
answer is, he is not; but he is bound to give the oxen, nam specie ad
speciem non admittur compensatio hic, that is, John did not promise Thomas the
money for the oxen, but in another respect.

Peter bound to keep this oath or not? Thou shall never wash my feet. John 13.8.

An oath not ratified by the superior, or when it is a hinderance to a greater
good, is not to be kept.
Secondly, all oaths have this tacit condition annexed to them, providing
that they hinder not a greater good; Peter's oath would have hindered a greater
good here; forthen Christ could not have showed them a pattern of great
humility to wash their feet.

Whether may an oath made by the inferior, with the consent and knowledge of
the superior,

Not, the Canonists give an example of this, The superior may not loose the
oath of the inferior which he has once ratified.
for all necessaries to entertain him at school, and the father by his own
consent is spoiled of his authority; but much more when he gives his express
consent.

But Abraham might free his servant of the oath which he had made him to
swear. Genesis 24.8. If the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
shall be free of this mine oath.

Abraham freeth him of an impossibility,

When an oath is exacted of a multitude,

The oath representative binds all the posterity, Gibonites; An oath
representative binds the posterity.
therefore after many years the seven sons of Saul were hanged for the
breach of this representative oath. 2. Sam. 21.6. Although particularly every
one of them had not sworn the oath. When Saul took an oath of the people that
they should eat none till night; Jonathan was not present when the oath was
made. 1. Sam. 14.27. yet the oath did bind them all; so the Jews took upon
them and their seed to keep the days of Purim. Esth. 9.27. So the Israelites
were bound to carry away Joseph's bones out of Egypt, which their father did
swear. Genesis 37.29. Exodus 13.19. So in a representative oath the children are
bound to keep that in forma specifica, which their fathers did swear.



The statutes of a commonwealth, how they bind.
having the punishment annexed if they break them: he who breaks the first
sort, where there is an express condition of perjury added, this man is
perjured; But if he break the statutes of the latter sort propounded
conditionally under such a punishment, he is free of perjurie, if he undergo
the punishment, because such an oath obliged to obedience or punishment, and
the law binds either to obedience or punishment; and if he refuse to
undergo the punishment, then he is perjured.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, to swear rashly and without a cause, is from that
evil one, Mat. 5.37. but perjurie is a higher degree from the evil one, and
the book of Gods curse especially lights upon his house. Zach. 5. as we see
in Zedekiah here.

EXERCITAT. VI. Of blasphemy. Commandment III.
1. King. 21.10. And she set two sons of Belial before him to bear witness
against him, saying, thou did blaspheme God and the King.
IN blasphemy let us consider these things. First, wherefore it is called
blasphemy. Secondly, wherefore the Jews condemned Christ as a blasphemer.
Thirdly, what ceremonies they used when they heard one blaspheme. Fourthly, the
judgments which have be fallen those who have blasphemed.

First, wherefore is it called blasphemy, it comes from the Greek word
(...) ladere famam. (...).


Sundry people do express one and the selfsame thing diversely. Example, 1.
King. 2.10. Sundry people express one phrase diversely.
He blasphemed God and the King. The Greeks commonly express this phrase
this ways (...), as Ioh. 19.12. Whosoever makes himself a king, speaks
against Caesar. But the Hebrews when they express this phrase, they say,
(...).
he has blessed the king; and the Seventy, following the Hebrews say (...)
he has blessed the king, (...).
and the Atticks amongst the Hebrews express it otherwise, (...) he has
spoken well of the king; that is, he has cursed the king, and this (...)
signified (...) to blaspheme, (...).
which word is appropriated now to God, when his holy name is blasphemed, and
this is done sundry ways. It is blasphemy to give God names which befit him
not.


First when men give to God that which no ways befitteth him, as when they
called Christ a drinker of wine. Mat. 11.19.

They blaspheme when they speak disdainfully of God.
Secondly the name of the Lord is blasphemed, when they maliciously and in
disdain speak against the Lord, as Pharaoh said; Who is the Lord that I should
know him? Exodus 5.2. such was the blasphemy of the son of the Israelitish
woman. Levit. 24.11. He blasphemed the name of the Lord, in the original it
is, he pierced the name of the Lord; such was the blasphemy of the Jews who
said, (...) Perforavit nomen.
that Christ did cast out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
Luc. 11.15. This blasphemy is properly called the sin against the holy
Ghost; and they sin toti, in tote, and totaliter. Toti, that is, having their
minds enlightened, and their affections maliciously set, they reject the whole
known truth; In toto, that is, they sin against the whole law, and cast the
law behind them: And totaliter, they fall away finally from the truth; To
blaspheme this ways is a most terrible sin, for it pierces the side of God:
And as the strokes which are given to the vital parts are deadly; so to
blaspheme God, of whom we hold out life, that is a most fearful sin.

How they condemned Christ as a blasphemer.
Secondly, why they condemned Christ as a blasphemer. Job. 19.7. We have a law,
and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the son of God. The
law is set down; Exodus 22. Lev. 19. Deuteronomy. 18. that the blasphemer shall die the
death; and the practice of it, Lev. 24. But the Jews did mis-interpret this
law, for first, they generally hold that the son of the Israelitish woman was
put to death, because when he cursed, he expressed the name Iehova, (...)
and so Onkelos the Paraphrast paraphraseth it, Parash eth shema, he expressed
the name Iehova; the Seventy (...), he named the name Iehova. In this sense
they said not, that Christ blasphemed, but they say, he shall die because he
made himself the son of God. But the law faith, he that blasphemeth the name
of God, shall die the death: Now to apply this to him who was the son of God
and gave the law, was the wresting of the law, therefore they say, We have a
law; it was their law, but not the law of God.

Thirdly, The ceremonies which they used when they heard blasphemy.
consider the ceremonies which they used when they heard any blaspheme; they
were two especially: first, they put their fingers in their cares that they
might not hear the blasphemy; Act. 7.57. and secondly, they rent their
clothes.

How could they rent their clothes, rent the heart and not the clothes. Joel
2.13.

He does not forbid them simply to rent their clothes, but rather to rent
their heart than their clothes. Thou shall be called Israel and not Jacob. Genesis
22.38. that is, thou shall be called rather Israel than Jacob. So buy wisdom
and not gold. Prove. 8.10. that is, rather, wisdom than gold. When ye make a
great feast, bid not your brethren, but the poor. Luc. 14.12, 13. that is,
rather the poor than your brethren. So, he sent me not to baptize, but to
preach. 1. Cor. 1.17. that is, rather to preach than to baptize.

They rent their clothes when the king died, When, and for whom they rent
their clothes.
as David and his men rent their clothes for the death of Saul and Jonathan.
2. Sam. 1.11, 12. and for burning of the book of the law. Ier. 36.23, 24. and
when the temple was destroyed, Ier. 41.5. and so when they heard the name of
God blasphemed. 2. King. 19.1.

They rent not their clothes but when they heard an Israelite blaspheme, and
therefore they gather that Rabsakeh was an apostate Jew, because they rent
their clothes when they heard him blaspheme. 2. King. 19.1.

They rent their clothes when one died who was near unto them in blood. Genesis
37.34. Le. 13.45. and 21.10. the Priest is forbidden to rent his clothes;
therefore they gather that others might rent their clothes for the death of
their friends or kinsmen, they rent the forepart of their clothes, How they
rent their clothes.
but not behind, or the sides, or beneath, save the high Priest, he rent his
clothes beneath; and the measure of the renting was an hand breadth, and this
was only the upper garment.



Something national, ceremonial, and moral commanded to the Jews.
Some things were commanded to them as national, and some things as types, and
some things as moral; these things which were national do not bind us now,
as to put dust upon the head in the day of humiliation, to go in sackcloth, to
anoint the face and such; those which are typical do not bind us; but only
moral precepts do bind us, as to rent the heart, etc.

The judgment of God upon blasphemers.
Fourthly, see the judgments of God that have come upon blaspemers; as upon
Julian the Apostate, who dyed casting up his blood against the heaven. Upon
Arrius, who died scouring out his guts; upon Olympus an Arrian Bishop, who
denying the trinity, was stricken with three thunderbolts from the heaven, and
killed in a bath.

Conclusion.
Ecclus. 23.12. There is a word that is clothed about with death, God grant
that it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; here the blasphemer is brought
in, as carried to the place of execution in his mourning apparel; blasphemy
is clothed with death; therefore all Christians as they would shun eternal
death and be clothed in white, let them shun this blasphemy.

EXERCITAT. VII. To give God his right titles and attributes. Commandment III.
2. King. 2.14. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell, from him, and
smote the waters, and said; Where is the Lord God of Elijah Aphhu.
WE have spoken of the negative part of this commandment, that we should not
take the name of God in vain. When the Lord called his Prophets he confirmed
them in their calling by sundry signs.
Now we come to the affirmative, to use the name of God reverently in prayer,
in swearing, and vowing.

The Lord, when he appointed his Prophets, used sundry signs to confirm
them; he touched Esaiahs lips with a cole from the altar. Esaias. 6.6. so he
touched the mouth of Jeremiah. Cap. 1.9. Then the Lord put forth his hand and
touched my mouth. So he bids Ezekiel, eat the book, Ezekiel. 3.2. so he
appointed Elisha by casting the mantle of Elijah about him. 1. King. 19.19. and
to this Christ alludeth: Luc. 24.49. Allusion.
But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be clothed with power from
on high.

Now when Elisha was clothed with this mantle of Elijah he stroke the waters
with his mantle, as he saw his master do before; and the waters not being
divided, as he saw Elijah divide them before with the same mantle, he cries
out, where is the Lord God of Elijah Aphhu.

The question is, whether this word Aphhu should be joined to the words going
before, or to the words following: Some join it to the words following, and
read it this ways, (...) Sic legitur. Vbi est Iehova Deus Elijae Aph-hu? and
percussit aquas.
he himself smote the waters, that is, Elijah himself, but the words should be
joined with the words going before, Where is the Lord God of Elijah Aphhu. For
they are distinguished from the words following by the point Pesik, and Aph-hu,
are joined together by the Euphonick accent Maccaph, which shows them to be
but one word; the words they are to be read as a prayer, Elisha calling upon
the God of Elijah by his title and attribute Aph-hu.

Reasons proving that Aph-hu is a proper name of God.
Now that this is one of Gods attributes, first it is proved; because the
Seventy never do translate it.

Secondly, because Aquila and Symmachus translate it here (...) which
signifies the hid name of God, and Hu is often times joined to the proper name
of God Iehova: Lament. 1.18. So to the name Peli, hu peli Dan. 8. So to the
Messiah. Zach. 9.9.

Thirdly, the Chaldee paraphrast does not translate it, but paraphraseth it
this ways; Suscipe petitionem meam Domine Deus Elijah Aph-hu.

Fourthly, the Jews at this day in the beginning of their prayers, they begin
their invocations thus, Aph-hu, qui es ante orbe^ conditu^, and Aph-hu a quo
conditus est orbis.

Lastly, the ancient Jew Abrabaniel commenting upon this place, puts Iehova
for Aph-hu: by these reasons we may perceive, that all those take it for a
proper name of God.

A special part of Gods worship to know his names and attributes.
It is a special part of Gods worship to use his names, titles and attributes
reverently, now if this his name should be passed by and neglected, were not
this a taking of the name of God in vain?

So we should study to know his other names which are revealed to us, as Shem,
and Iehova and Shecina. Exodus 29.45. and (...), power: Luc. 22.63. at the right
hand of the power, and many such.

But where the names are altogether hid, as Hu Peloni Almani contracted
Palmoni. Daniel 8. these we should not search.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of a lawful oath. Commandment III.
Ier. 4.3. Thou shall swear, The Lord lives in truth, judgment, and
righteousness.
FIrst we must swear by the Lord, it is a principal part of his worship.
Esaias. 45. Deuteronomy. 13. (...)
and it is expressed some times this ways, qui iurant Laihova, to the Lord,
that is, by the Lord, Esaias. 29.18. 2. Chron. 15. Zeph. 1.5.

We must not swear by the creatures, We may not swear by the creatures.
for they cannot bear witness of the truth and falsehood of the heart.

But the children of God seem to have sworn by the creatures. 1. Sam. 25.26.
As the Lord lives, and as thy soul lives.

The first part of these words is an oath, When we swear directly by God, the
creatures may be named.
but the latter part contains an asseveration or obtestation only conjoined
with the oath; for although we may not swear by the creatures, yet when we
swear directly by God, in the form of the oath we may name the creatures, and
present them before God, that he would take vengeance of us, if we lie and
swear falsely. Ier. 38.16. So the king swear to Jeremiah, saying, as the Lord
lives who made us this soul, I will not put thee to death; and it is to be
observed, that these two are distinguished in the Hebrew phrase which cannot be
so distinguished in another language; (...) Vivat Iehova (...) Vivat anima tua
(...) in forma piel, significat vitam habere in se vela se. (...) in forma
paul, passive significat vitam habere ab alio, and non a se.
when God is named in the oath, it is Chai Iehova, but when the creature is
named, it is but Che; the first signifies him that has life in himself, and
gives life to others; and therefore we should swear only by him, the second
signifies, that which has life of another, and therefore we should not swear
by it.

When the Prophets speak of idols they say both Chai and Che; they say Chai,
because the idolaters thought their gods to be living gods, (...) Vivat Deus
tuus o Dan, and vivat mos Beer-sheba.
and Che; because, according to the truth it self, they had no life in them,
as Amos 4 14. Chai cloecha dan, veche derech beer-shabhang.

If the name of the Lord be not called on either expressly,

When one says, the Lord knows I speak the truth, whether is this an oath
or not?

When a speech is pronounced by way of enunciation it is not an oath, but when
is is pronounced by way of invocation it becomes an oath.
These words may be considered two ways, either enunciative, or invocative,
when one purposes to call God for a witness, as Gal. 1.20. Before God I lie
not. So when Peter said, thou know that I love thee, Ioh. 21.15. here it is
the form of an oath; because they call God for a witness that they speak the
truth in his presence: but if it be spoken only by way of enunciation, showing
that they speak the truth, then it is not an oath.



Whether a man be bound to keep the oath which he has sworn by the creatures.
whose majesty and glory shines in these creatures, but if he should swear
so by the devil, that oath obliged him not, because he is an enemy opposite
to God altogether; and the goodness of God is not seen in him, as in other
creatures.

If it be said that he who swears by the creatures amiss forsweareth
himself;

This will not follow, Albeit the swearing by the creatures falsely dishonor
God, yet it does not honor him to swear by them truly.
and yet they are not to be honored with that honor which is due to God.
Example, if a man be drunk with wine, the abuse of the creatures redoundeth
to the dishonor of God, but when we use the creatures moderately, we honor
God, but yet we give not divine worship to the creature, and multa sufficient
ad contumeliam Dei quae non sufficient ad cultum Dei, many things do dishonor
God which are not fit means to worship him.

He that swears must swear by the Lord, We must not swear by idols.
we must not swear then by the name of idols. Exodus 23.13. I will not remember
their gods, so Psalm. 16. I will not take the name of their gods in my mouth.
They that swear by the sin of Samaria and say, thy God O Dan lives, and the
manner of Bersheba lives. Amos 8.14. the manner of Beersheba, that is, The
manner of Beersheba what.
the forms and rites of the worshipping in Beersheba, as the Chaldee Paraphrast
paraphraseth it.

One may take an oath of an idolater as Jacob took an oath of Laban when he
swore by his false gods. Genesis 31.53.

But a man may seem this way to be guilty of idolatry,

If a Christian should compel an idolater to swear by his idol, then he were
guilty of his idolatry. Josh. 23.7. Neither make mention of the name of their
idols, How a man is not guilty of idolatry, albeit he make the ido^ater swear
by his idol.
nor cause them to swear by them. He who sells an idol to an idolater, is
guilty of his idolatry, as he who puts a sword in a mad man's hand is the
cause why he murdereth; but he who accidentally only is an occasion to
another man's sin, the sin is not his, but the persons who commits it;
we may use the sin of another man lawfully to our good, when that which we
ask of him, if he please, he may do it without sin; it is sin then to him,
because he does it not rightly; but it is no sin to thee, When we may use
another man's sin for our good.
because thou ask of him a thing lawful; and therefore thou do not
communicate with him in his sin. Example, a man comes to borrow money of an
Usurer, the Usurer if he please might lend the money freely without usury;
therefore the borrower may safely borrow money, albeit he seek so much for
the loan of his money: So a Christian may take an oath of an idolater, why?
because the idolater if he pleased might swear to him by the true God; now
when the idolater swears to him by a false god, the Christian partaketh not
with him in his idolatry, but seeks only to secure himself, Why a
Chrishian makes the idolater swear by his idol.
and this he seeks by swearing, but not by swearing by the false god: but if
a man should come to seek help of a witch, this were altogether unlawful;
for a witch cannot be in a covenant with the devil, but she must sin;
therefore a man cannot seek help of her.



How the oath which an idolater has made by his idol does bind him.
The oath in it self is no more then a simple promise, for it cannot be an
oath, nisi prima veritas adducatur in testem, who is God himself: but yet if
ye will respect the evil informed conscience, who takes this idol to be a
true God, then the idolater is more bound by his oath then by his simple
promise; because all Divines agree in this, that an erring conscience binds a
man that he shall do nothing against it. Romans 14.14. If he judge a thing to be
unclean to him, it is unclean, and if he judge a thing to be holy to him, it
is holy; the erroneous conscience of the idolater does not change the nature of
the thing, but only to himself who thinks so of his idol; but not to him
who thinks otherwise of the idol.

Whether is it a greater sin to swear by the true God falsely, or to swear
by the false god truly?

It is a greater sin to swear by the true God falsely, A greater sin to
swear by the true God falsely, then by a false god truly.
he sins against the third commandment; when he swears by the true God
falsely, it directly overthrowes all internal confidence and worship of God;
but when he swears by a false god truly, he overthrows the external
means of Gods worship, to wit, swearing by him.

The conditions of an oath are these: first, The first condition of an oath.
it must be in verity, all men naturally are liars. Romans 3.4. Therefore God
has found out an oath to secure men the better. Heb. 6.17. God swears
himself, to secure men, for God willing to show unto the heirs of promise
more abundantly the immutabilitie of his counsel, confirms it by an oath,
that is, by two immutable things, Why the Lord himself swears.
by which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation.
It is unpossible that God can lie, yet to help our infidelity he adds an
oath; men trust more to an oath then to a simple promise: for many men will
lie, but will be loath to forswear themselves; and an act of religion binds
more than a simple promise; and when God swears, he lays two bands upon
himself, first that he lie not, secondly, that he forswear not: the Apostle
calls Gods promise, Why God will have man to swear to his neighbor.
and his oath, two immutable things. Heb. 6.18. men are naturally liars,
therefore as God swears, to secure man, so he will have man to swear to man
to secure his neighbor; and man knowing that God is both the witness, and the
Judge, this secureth him.

The oath must be in verity; there is an agreement betwixt the mind and the
matter, and this is metaphysica veritas; Veritas Metaphysica. Logica.
Theologica.

the second is ad^quatio lingua and rei, and this is logica veritas; and the
third is, when there is adaquatio rei, lingua and conceptus, when the matter,
the the tongue, and the mind agree, and that is, theologica veritas.

When there is an agreement betwixt the tongue and the matter, this is a
material truth; when there is an agreement betwixt the mind and the tongue, A
threefold verity.
this is a formal truth; when there is an agreement betwixt the mind, the
matter, and the tongue, this is both a material and formal truth: A threefold
falsehood.
So when there is a disagreement betwixt the matter and the tongue, this is a
material false oath. Secondly when there is a disagreement betwixt the mind
and the tongue, this is a formal false oath; but when the mind the matter and
the tongue differ, then it is both a material and formal false oath. Esaias.
59.13. Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

In an assertorie oath, it is most requisite that the verity of the mind and
the matter go together; but in a promissory oath, it is most necessary that
the heart and the tongue go together. An oath must be in judgment.


The second condition of an oath is that it be in judgment, that it be not a
rash oath. Levit. 5.1. and this is actus prudentia non justitiae, it is an act
of prudencie and not of justice. It is not enough to know, that it is a truth
which he swears, and that it be a matter of weight, but also whether he may
be believed without an oath. An oath is not simply required of a man as
theological virtues are.


An oath is not simply required of a man, as humility, and prayer, and such;
but only necessary as repentance is after a man's fall: if man had stood in
innocence, there had been no use of these oaths, they are only then
necessary as letting of blood is necessary to the body, which should be
advisedly and sparingly done, to use it ordinarily is dangerous.

When a man swears rashly, Whether a man may keep the oath that is made
rashly.
here judgment is required to know whether he should keep such an oath or
not. David swore rashly that he would kill Nabal, yet he was better advised,
and with judgment retreated his oath. 2. Sam. 25. The rest of the tribes swore
that they would give none of their daughters to the tribe of Benjamin, yet they
gave them the daughters of the men of Iabesh Gilead afterward, being better
advised; and because the daughters of the men of Iabesh Gilead were too few for
them, The tribes repented them of the rash oath made concerning Benjamin.
they bad them go to the feast of Shiloh where the maids came forth to dance
in the vineyards, and there to take them wives. Judge. 21.21.

The third property of an oath is, that it be in justice, The third condition
of an oath.
that is to say, when he is called upon in necessity to swear: it is not
enough that he swear the truth, and that he swear advisedly with judgment;
but also he must be called to swear, and it must be laid upon him by a
Judge: Christ says, when the Comforter will come, How the holy Ghost
convinces the world of sin, justice, and judgment. Iudicium Libertatis.
Potestatis.

he will reprove the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment. Ioh.
16.8. Of sin, that is, of infidelity opposite to verity. Of judgment, that
is, of rash judgment concerning others, when they take upon them judicium
libertatis and have not judicium potestatis, that is, when they judge having no
calling to judge: Thirdly he will reprove the world of justice; because man is
an unequal judge, taking that to himself which is only due to God; now when
the Comforter came, he reduced sin into verity, rash judgment into true
judgment, and this unequal justice to right justice, answerable to these
three which are required in an oath, and when an oath wants any of these
three, then it is (...), from the evil one. Mat. 5.27.

Of the word AMEN, whether it be an asseveration or an oath.
IT is commonly taken for an asseveration, but it is not a simple asseveration,
but an oath; for Christ calls verity into witness, who is God himself, who
is Amen. (...)
Revel. 3.14. and Elohe Amen. Esaias. 56.16. These two are equivalent in the old
testament, as I live, says the Lord; and in the new testament, (...). Ioh.
1.51. Therefore when the Lord says, I live, and says, Amen, it is all one.
The Chaldees say, Kim Ana, (...)
constans and firmus ego, for Gods truth is his life, and his life is his
truth; and it is all one when he affirms a thing by himself, and by his Amen.

Amen, Amen, I say unto you; the Chaldees would translate it, How the Chaldee
interpret amen.
I swear, I swear unto you: we read never that any of the Prophets or
Apostles used this word Amen in an oath, but only God, or his son Jesus
Christ: because they cannot swear by themselves, having the Lord to swear by,
who is greater than themselves.

Why the Church uses amen at the end of her prayers.
And the Church uses this word in the end of her prayers, (...) fiat: because
all the promises in God are yea and amen in Christ. 2. Cor. 1.20. therefore she
is persuaded that the Lord will grant her petitions; and it is better
translated, so it is, than, so let it be; it is not only a wish or a desire of
a thing to be so, but also an assurance that the thing is granted.

Three sorts of amen in the Talmud.
The Jews in the Talmud made three sorts of unlawful Amen; the first was
Iethomah, pupillum, when one says Amen; (...)
and understands not to what, as children; the second is ^atuphah, raptum,
(...)
when one says Amen before prayer be ended; and the third is, Ketuphah,
soctum, that is, when one by turns divides his thoughts betwixt God and the
world, now he prays, now his mind runs after his worldly business; then
he prays again, and so his mind runs after the world again.

De juramento coacto.
IF a man be taken by thieves;

He is bound to keep this oath, if it be in malis poena, Psalm. 15.4. although
it be to his own hurt; but if it be sin in it self, he is not bound to
keep it.

But he is enforced to this oath, Ob. Answ. The will of man cannot be
compelled.
therefore he is not bound to keep it.

The will of man cannot simply be compelled, for when a man does a thing for
fear of greater evil, he is not judged to do it unwillingly; for although at
the first, it would seem to be against his will, yet the fear of greater
evil makes him to be willing; and in this action of redeeming himself from
thieves, three things are to be considered: first, the action of him that
swears; secondly, he who compels him to swear; thirdly, the matter which
he swears.

First we consider the action of him who swears, Whether a man is bound to
perform his oath made to thieves.
the action is good, because redimit vexationem suam, and nature teaches a man
to redeem his liberty; and if it be an action of mercy to redeem another
from the hands of thieves; much more is it an action of mercy for a man to
redeem himself: but if we consider the oath upon the thieves part, who
makes the captive to swear, then it is altogether unlawful. Thirdly, the
matter must be considered which they make him to swear, if the matter be only
loss of his goods, then he is to keep his oath. Psalm. 15.4. but if the matter
of the oath be sin in it self; then he is not to keep it.

A man is obliged to (...) perform his oath to the thieves: in the court of
conscience albeit not in the courts of men,
Again we must distinguish betwixt the court of conscience and the courts of
men; the oath made to thieves is not valide in the courts of men, because he
was enforced to it. If a man to supply his necessity borrow money from an
usurer, here is a necessity; but no external necessity compelling him by
force: therefore he is bound here in the courts of men to keep his promise;
but when the thief compels him, this necessity binds him not in the
courts of men, quia est vis major, but in the court of conscience he is bound
to keep his oath, although there be no external compulsion.

De juramento incauto.
A Man takes an oath of another ignorantly, and the swearer swears
deceitfully unto him; yet if the Lord who is the principal contracter allow or
command the thing which he swears, Whether a man is bound to keep the oath
which he has sworn, being deceived through ignorance.
the oath is not null, although he that is the second contracter be deceived,
as we see in the example of the Gibeonites; Joshua was deceived by them when
they made an oath to him deceitfully; yet the oath abode firm and sure, and
obliged the posterity, because the Lord God himself was the principal
contracter.

Maimon. Tom. a. tract. de Regib. cap. 7 sect. 10.
The Lord commanded when they came near any city to fight against it, first,
that they should receive the seven precepts of Noah; The conditions of peace
that was offered to the nations.
secondly, that they should become tributaries; and thirdly, that they should
become servants to the Jews: but the Lord excepted still the Moabites, and
Ammonites, that no peace should be offered to them; and notwithstanding that
Joshua had offered peace to the seven nations, yet they contemned the peace,
because the Lord had hardened their hearts and was to destroy them.

And the Hebrews say, Three things given them in choice.
when the messenger did offer peace to them, they had three things in
commission to them. First, fugiat qui vult; secondly, dedat se qui vult; and
thirdly, pugnet qui vult: and they say, that the Gergafites of all the seven
nations accepted of the conditions of peace, therefore they are not reckoned
amongst the rest. Deuteronomy. 20.27. Josh. 9.1. the Gibeonites who were of the
Hivites, at the first refused the conditions of peace with the rest; but seeing
the rest miserably put to the sword, by deceit they entered in conditions of
peace with Joshua: here the oath which Joshua made with them, did bind him;
because it was according to the intention of the lawgiver, and error persona
non irritat contractum.

The conclusion of this is. Conclusion.
Seeing God is both the judge and the witness in an oath, we should not call
him to witness in an untruth; neither swear falsely, Lest the book of Gods
curse light upon the house of the swearer. Zach. 5.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of the gestures which they used in swearing. Commandment III.
Exodus 17.16. And Moses built an altar, and called it Iehova Nissi, for he
says, because the Lord has sworn that he will have war with Ameleck from
generation to generation.
Diverse readings of this place. Exodus 17.16.
THis place is diversely read, some read it thus, He set up a trophee of
victory, and called the name thereof Iehova Nissi, or the Lord is my banner;
and he said, because the hand of the Lord was against Amaleck, in abscondito
lana, that is, when the moon is in the conjunction with the sun, which is
the last day of the month; so Prove. 7.20. (...)
Here they make that to be one word, which should be two, Cesiah, for Ces jah.

(...)
Others read it thus, And he said; because the hand of Amaleck was against the
throne of the Lord; therefore there should be war from generation to
generation.

The best reading of it.
But the best reading is, And he said, because the hand was upon the throne of
the Lord, the battle of the Lord shall be against Amaleck from generation to
generation, that is, the Lord laying his hand upon his throne, has sworn that
there shall be a perpetual war with Amaleck. When they swore they laid their
hands upon some solemn thing.
Here is an allusion to the form which they used in swearing, to lay on their
hand upon some solemn thing when they swore; as Abraham's servant put his hand
under his masters thigh. So they used to swear at the altar. 1. King. 8.31. If
the oath come before thine altar in this house. So they used to lay their hands
upon the altar, hence came that phrase tangere aras: now the Lord speaking
after the manner of men here, is said to lay his hand upon his throne, that is,
to swear by himself, for he has no greater to swear by. Heb. 6.

This ceremony in swearing is expressed some times by laying on the hand,
Ceremonies used in swearing.
and some times by lifting up the hand; when the hand is holden up to the
heaven, Vibrare manum, and levare manum quid.
it is a sign of swearing. Genesis 14.24. so Esaias. 3.7. To lift up is taken for
swearing; but vibrare manum, est habitus percutientis. Ezekiel. 36.7. to shake the
hand to and fro. Psalm. 106. Esaias. 11.15. and sometimes to lift up the hand is a
sign of help, and favor, as men put the hand to help them that are weak.
Psalm. 10.33. and sometimes it is the gesture of him that prays. Esaias. 49.22.

Mark the goodness of God who bears so much with man's infirmity; first he
promises unto him, God swears to us bearing with our infirmities.
then he affirms unto him, then he swears to him, and then he expresses
the oath by the gestures, and manners of men, for a man's greater assurance; and
last he sets his seal to confirm all in the sacrament; and here we have
great cause to be humbled for our infidelity, and to magnify the mercy of
God who condescendeth so far unto us, to the end, we should not be faithless
but faithful. He that believes not God makes him a liar, because he
believes not the record that God gave of his son. 1. Ioh. 5.10. He that
believes not Gods record makes him a liar, but much more does he make him a
liar who believes not his oath, and his sealed promise.

The Lord swears laying his hand upon his throne, Lawful to swear laying
the hand upon the Scriptures.
therefore to lay their hand upon the holy scriptures when they swear, is a
thing lawful: for they do not swear by the scriptures, but they use that
sign to affect them more in their oath. So Abraham's servant laid his hand
under his masters thigh, and they swore beside the altar, or laying their hand
upon the altar.

The accomplishment of this oath against Amalecke.
The accomplishment of this oath against Amaleck is perpetual war, for the
rooting out of the Amalekites: we read how angry the Lord was with Saul for
sparing of them. 1. Sam. 15.11. and how the Hagagites, as Haman and his
posterity were rooted out. Esth. 9. which was the effect of this curse: and
many of them fled to Macedonia, and changed their names; (therefore the Seventy
in Esther translate an Hagagite, a Macedonian) so their name was rooted out
under heaven.

Some good people of other nations but none good came of Amalecke.
The curse was so upon the Amalekites, that none proved good of them; but ye
shall find some good men and women of the posterity of other cursed nations,
as of the posterity of Ham, Ebedmelech the black more. Ier. 38.7. of Esau, Job:
of the Cananites, Rahab: of the Hittites, Vrijah: of the Iebusites, Arauna: of
the Moabites, Ruth. of the Philistims, the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the
Gittites; and of the Hivites came the Gibionites or Nethinims: but none came of
the cursed posterity of the Amalekites, because the Lord commanded them to be
made cherem execrable.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, as we should reverently swear when we take the
name of God in our mouths; so we should use reverent gestures in swearing.

EXERCITAT. X. Of Vows. Commandment. III.
Psalm. 76.11. Vow and pay unto the Lord your God, etc.
A Vow is a promise deliberately made to God, What a vow is.
of some good things to be performed, if it be not disannulled by the superior.
Deuteronomy. 23.23. Exitum labiorum servabis, that is, thou shall perform thy vows.

In this promise a desire is not sufficient to make a vow, What is sufficient
to make a vow.
neither is the purpose or intention sufficient to make it, unless he who
voweth have a mind to oblige himself; it suffices to make a vow, if he has
resolved in his mind although he has neither spoken it by word or writ.

Secondly, it is said, deliberately made; for a promise in a sudden passion,
without due consideration, makes not a vow; how great this deliberation should
be, In canon: mulier: qua habet similem. 26.
the Gloss says, Iudicium quod sufficit ad obligandum diabolo, sufficit ad
obligandum Deo, but this is a false ground, for any sudden or hasty motion
binds a man to the devil, but there must be a full resolution or a full
consent to bind a man by his vow.

Thirdly, it is said, of some good thing; A man must not vow that which is
sin in it self.
to exclude things that are evil in themselves; for a man may not vow that
which is sin in it self, as those who vowed that they would neither eat nor
drink until they had killed Paul. Act. 23.12.

There are some vows de malo and ad malum; Three sorts of vows.
some de bono male, and some de bono been: that which is de malo and ad malum,
should not be kept; Secondly, that which is de bono male, as if a man should
vow to give alms, that he may be seen of men; he should give his alms, but
leave the end: a man keeps a concubine, he voweth that that day that she
bears him a son, he will give so much to the Church; he should give that
which he voweth, to the Church, but leave his concubine. And thirdly, de bono
been, and these vows he is bound to perform.

What things we may not vow.
A man may not vow that which hinders a greater good; Peter vowed that Christ
should never wash his feet, Things that hinder a greater good.
this vow would have hindered a greater good, and therefore it should not be
kept.

Things that are not in our power.
So he may not vow that which is not in his power: Example, a man that is
married may not vow abstinence from his wife, Things absolutely necessary.
nor the woman from her husband; the reason is, because the man has not power
over his body, but the wife; neither has the woman power over her own body,
We may not vow trifles.
but the husband: 1. Cor. 7.4. but yet the man may things without the consent
of the wife, because he is vow other her head, so he may not vow that which
is absolutely necessary, as to vow he will die: so he may not vow a trifle, as
to lift a straw.

Vows must have the consent of the superior.
If it be not disanulled by the consent of the superior. Superiors are God in
the highest degree; husbands to their wives, parents to their children, masters
to their servants, Who are our superiors.
etc. in the lower degree. If the consent of the superior be not to the vow,
then it is null. A man voweth things which are free or indifferent to him; to
marry or not to marry is a thing in it self indifferent, yet it is not simply
free to thee; and if thou vow such a vow and have not the Lords consent in it,
who is thy superior; then thy vow is null: thou have his consent when he gives
thee the gift of continency, When we have the Lords consent in our vows.
that thou can live without marriage; but to all he gives not this gift.
Mat. 19.12.

Whether may a man vow that which he is bound to perform by the law.

He may vow that which he is already bound to perform; Thom. tom. 4. did.
38. q. 1. art. 2. quest. 11.
neither does this derogate any thing from the law of God, as though his vow
were more then Gods law by which he is obliged already; he does only this to
help his own infirmity and weakness: How a man may vow that which he is
bound to do already.
there are some things which are not commanded in the law to us, and they are
both materially and formally left free to us, and such things we may vow: there
are other things which are commanded by the law, which are not altogether
voluntary, and left free to us; if a man make a vow of such a thing, it is a
material vow only, Votum Materiale. Formale.

but not a formal vow. Example, 1. Sam: 1.11. When Hanna vowed that she would
dedicate her son to the Lord, this was the material part of her vow, she
was bound to this, because he was a Levites son. Number. 1.3, 4. The material
part of the vow is commanded by the Lord, but the formal part is voluntary to
us.
but besides this, she vowed him to be a Nazaret unto the Lord; this was the
voluntary and formal part of the vow. So Jacob was bound by the law of the
Lord to have God for his God, yet he voweth, if the Lord would bring him back
again from Mesopotamia safely, then the Lord should be his God. Genesis 28.21.
this was the formal part of his vow. So David, Psalm. 119.106. Why we should
vow that which we are bound to perform.
I have sworn and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous
judgments: David was bound to keep the Lords judgments, yet because he was
so ready to fall, he adds this oath to strengthen himself, and to enable
him for the keeping of the commandments.

Levit. 27.26.

The first borne of the beasts were so the Lords, they could not be dedicated
or vowed over again: a beast when it is given to God, The difference betwixt
the dedication of the first borne of beasts and man.
it is not liberum agens, to fall from the dedication again, it is mere
passive in the dedication: but man after that he is dedicate to God in
baptism, he is a creature that works freely, and sins often: therefore
he may vow anew again to strengthen himself that he fall no more.

The difference betwixt the vows under the Law and under the Gospel.
We must put a difference betwixt the Jewish vows under the old testament, and
our vows under the gospel: under the law, vows were a part of Gods worship;
but now they are not a part of Gods worship: they are not pars cultus now, sed
ad cultum; the Church of Rome take them still to be a part of Gods worship.

Esaias says, that we shall vow under the gospel. Esaias. 19.21. Yea they shall
vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. Then it may seem that our vows are
a part of Gods worship now under the gospel, as they were under the law.

The holy Ghost expresses the estate of the Church under the new Testament by
legal terms oftentimes.
When the holy ghost speaks in the old testament of the estate of the Church
under the new, he often times uses legal terms as Malachi 3.3.4. He shall
purify the sons of Levi that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in
righteousness, then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in the former years. And so by vows,
the Prophet Esaias meant, the spiritual worship which we shall perform to the
Lord under the gospel.



What things a man may vow under the Gospel.
He may vow those things, quasunt necessaria propter aliud, sed libera in se.
Example, a man is overtaken with wine, and he is drunk; he voweth abstinence
from wine, this vow may be a lawful vow: First, if he restrain it not to
one certain day: The conditions of a vow under the Gospel.
Secondly, that he put no part of holiness in it; for the kingdom of God
stands not in meat and drink. Romans 14.17. Thirdly, that he place no merit
in it: Fourthly, that it take not away his Christian liberty, but only
restrain the use of this liberty; this way when he uses his vow, he makes
it a fence to the commandments of God.

A vow is a straight obligation to bind us to God, mark the phrase of the
holy ghost. Psalm. 56.12. My vows are upon me, that is, I am bound to do this:
the Hebrews use this proposition, Gual, super, (...) Super me stint vota tuae
o Deus. (...) hic notat of ficium, id est, teneor persolvere votatua. Quest.
for the duties which we are to perform to any. Super nos est tradere eum in
manum regis. 1. Sam. 23.20. this duty lies upon us, or we are bound to do
it, so Nehem. 6.10. they are said detineri voto, to be holden with their vow.

Whether does a vow bind us more strictly than an oath?

If it be a solemn vow, and an oath be interposed, Whether an oath or a vow
does bind more strictly.
which is the bond of the soul. Number. 30.3.4. Then the vow binds more then
the oath; but if it be a simple vow, then it binds not so strictly as an
oath: necessity loses a simple vow, but necessity breaks not a man's oath;
therefore a man's oath binds him more straightly, then his simple vow.

Necessity loses a simple vow, Necessity breaks a simple vow, but not an
oath.
the Rechabites vowed that they should never lodge in houses, but in tents; but
necessity compelled them to break this vow, when Nebuchadnezzar came to
besiege Jerusalem. Ier. 35.

Whether is a thing better done with a vow,

Those things which God has commanded in the scriptures to be done, What
things are better done with a vow, and what not.
when a vow is added to them they are better done then with a vow: But those
things which God has left free to man, and he has not a certain calling to
do them; it is better to do them without a vow: when thou addest a vow to the
thing which God commanded thee to do, then thou do offer both the tree and
the fruit to the Lord; but when thou vowest these things for which thou have no
certain calling, thou do not offer the tree to the Lord, and the fruit he
will not accept.

(...) Sacrificium retributionis a (...) retribuere, vel (...) pax.
When the vow is vowed, we must study to perform it. Shillem is called
sacrificium retributionis; because when they were in danger, they vowed, and
when they were freed they performed it: this word comes first from Shallam
retribuere, and then from Shalum pax: because when a man pays his vows to
the Lord, then he gets peace in his mind.

It is added, if it be not disanulled by the superior; for it is in the
superiors power to disanull or approve the vow the superiors are, the
husband to the wife, the master to the servants, and tutor to the pupils.

The husband may approve or disanull the vow of his wife.
The husband when he heard the vow of his wife, and approved it, then it was
called his vow. Hanna made a vow; 1. Sam. 1.11. but when her husband Elkana
allowed it, it is called his vow. 1. Sam. 1.12. He went up to pay his vow. The
vows of the wives are called their husbands vows.
So when the husbands stood by and ratified the vows of their idolatrous
wives, they are called their vows. Ier. 44.25. Number. 30.14. It was in the
husbands power to disallow the vow of his wife, vir ejus stabiliet illud, vel
irritum faciet: the husband by his tacit consent allows the vow of his wife,
and she might safely perform it; but if after that he had holden his peace
from day to day, and then afterward disallow her vowed, then he shall bear her
iniquity. Number. 30.15. Gnavonah, the affixe is in the feminine gender, because
his wife would have performed her lawful vow, (...) iniquitas ejus, scilicet
uxoris.
but he taking upon him by his authority to disanull her vow, then he bears
her iniquity.

Drusius ex Phesicta. 41.61.4.
The parents might disallow the vows of their children; the Jews say, they
might disanull the vow of the males, until they were thirteen years of age
and a day past, and of the maid until she was ten years of age and a day
past; but the civil law says, they may disallow the vow of the male until he
was fourteen, and the maid until she was thirteen. There are two sorts of
vows, real vows, and personal vows, Votum Reale. Personale.

real vows are such as belong to the establishing of the house or family,
What the real vows are and what the personal.
and personal vows are such as belong to their person; real vows the parent
may disanull until the children be twenty five years, they give an example
of this. If a child should vow to give so much land to a holy use, his father
may disanull this vow until he be twenty five years of age; but if it be
only a personal vow to abstain from such and such things, then the parent
may but disanull this vow of his son, until he be fourteen years of age.

Whether may a preacher disanull the vows of any of his congregation or not?

If it be a superstitious vow, The preacher may not directly disanull the vow
of his hearer.
but he must not take upon him directly to disanull such a vow; for this were
to usurp the privilege of a husband, master, father, or tutor; a man has
vowed that he will drink no wine, he abstaineth from wine along time, and
falls in a great sickness, the physician comes to him, Simile.
and tells him that there is no health for him, unless he drink wine: The
physician does nothing in this case, but shows the man in what case he is, if
he drink no wine; and so it is necessity here that loses the vow, and not
the physician: So the preacher may show the necessity and expediencie of the
loosing of the vow, but he may not loose the vow; for this is not a part of
the keys of the kingdom of God committed to his charge.

The Pope takes upon him to dispense with vows, The Pope how he dispenses
with vows.
or to change vows: Some vows he permits the Bishops in their diocesses
to dispense with, and some he reserveth to himself to dispense with them; and
he permits the Priest only to absolve them from excommunication at the
hour of death, and thus he abuses the keys of the kingdom of God, applying
them to those things which are not spiritual.



EXERCITAT. XI. Of Jephthes vow. Commandment III.
Judge. 11.30. And Iephthe vowed a vow.
Three things to be considered in Iephthes vow.
THere are three things to be considered in Iephthes vow, first, what moved
Iephthe to vow this vow, and whether this vow was the cause of the victory or
not? Secondly, how this vow is to be read? and thirdly, whether he sacrificed
his daughter or not?

First, what moved him to vow this vow, some separating the 29. and 30. verses
say, The opinion of Caietan concerning this vow.
that the spirit of the Lord came upon Iephthe, and he passed over Gilead over
to the children of Ammon, the spirit of the Lord came then upon him to go
against the children of Ammon, and here they make a rest, And Iephthe vowed a
vow, this begins a new sentence, he vowed a vow of his own head, (say they)
but the spirit of the Lord was upon him to direct him to go against the
children of Ammon.

But the same spirit that moved him to go against the children of Ammon, moved
him to make his vow; Caietans opinion not likely.
and this vow was the cause of the victory, for the text sath, If thou deliver
mine enemies into mine hand; then it subjoyneth, the Lord delivered them into
his hands, and if the Lord had not granted this victory for the vow, Iephthes
vow was conditional.
Iephthe had not been bound to perform this vow; because he vowed this vow
with a condition, if thou grant me this victory, and then Verse 36. it is
added, Do to me according as it has proceeded out of thy mouth, for as much
as the Lord has taken vengance of thine enemies: God granted the victory not
only for the prayer of the people, but also for Iephthes vow.
he heard the prayers of the people and saw their afflictions, and granted the
victory for their prayers, but he granted it also for Iephthes vow, although
there were many defects in it.

The second thing to be considered, here, How the words are to to be read
disiunctive vel copulative.
is how the words of the vow are to be read; some read the words with a
copulative and not disjunctive conjunction; and they say, a disjunctive has
place only where two things are opposite under the same gender, but we speak
not so of those where the one is comprehended under the other. Example, of the
first, he who curses his father or his mother, here are two distinct persons
opposite under the next gender. Exodus 21.17. Mat. 15.4. So he who touches this
man or his wife. Genesis 26.11. But we say not this way; this is a living
creature, or a man; because the one comprehends the other, for every living
creature is a man. So it shall surely be the Lords, [and] I will offer it in a
burnt offering, and not; [Or] I will offer it: for whatsoever was offered in a
burnt offering, was the Lords; therefore it must be read (say they) it shall
surely be the Lords, and I will offer it for a burnt offering.

Piscator.
Others make the difference betwixt these two members after this manner, that he
promised to consecrate to the Lord whatsoever met him first, whether it were
dog or ass, for such he might have redeemed by the law. Levit. 27.11. and
the latter part of the vow, I shall offer it in a burnt offering: had this
condition annexed to it; If it be a creature fit for sacrifice.

Israel to want children, therefore Elizabeth said, the Lord has taken away my
reproach. Luc. 1.25. and Psalm. 78.63. Their virgins were not praised,

There was no command^ment to sacrifice their children.
As they had no example to vow virginity in those times, far less had they
any example or command to sacrifice their children: Iephthes vow was a rash
vow, and much ignorance in it of the law of God, for Levit. 27.11. The Lord
commands that if a man vow a female, Much ignorance of the law in Iephthes
vow.
that her estimation shall be thirty shekles, and that he may redeem the
female for so much, and as he is to be blamed for his ignorance; so for his
rashness in vowing this, I^phthe intended chiefly that his daughter should
live a solitary life, and accidently only to live a virgin.
in that he neither advised with Priest nor Levite for the space of two
months: and it may be said farther, that virginity was not the chief thing
that he intended here in his vow, but only a solitary life, that she should
be separated from the society of others, which of necessity must infer
virginity: if he had vowed a son to the Lord, he might have been the
Lords, and have been married also: as Samuel was consecrated to the Lord, and
yet he was married; and a woman consecrated to the Lord must follow her
husband; but Iephthes daughter not being married, he consecrateth her to the
Lord to live in a solitary place: So that he intended a solitary life for her
principally, and virginity but accidentally.

The third and chief thing to be considered here, Whether Iephthe sacrificed
his daughter.
is this, whether did Iephthe offer his daughter or not? the whole question
depends upon the translation of this word. Verse. 40. (...)
The daughters of Israel went out yearly to lament her, the Seventy reads it
(...) and the Chaldee Lealaab, ad lugendum: but they might lament her yearly,
she being alive; because she lived such a solitary life. The reason why they
translate it, To lament her, (...) a (...) Draco. (...) pro (...) non est
gerundium ex duplicantibus sed ex quie scentibus Lamed He, est igitur gerundium
Piel ut (...), thema est (...) confabulari.
was, because they derived Letannoth from Tanan, and hence comes Tanim draco,
because the dragon makes a pitiful mourning when she cries. Micah 1.8. I
shall lament like a dragon. So Job. 30.25. I was a brother to the dragons,
Letannim pro letanninim: but Letannoth here is derived from Tanah narrare. So
Judge. 5.11. Ietannu, narrabunt justitias Domini, it should be translated then,
ad colloquendum, and Pagninus, and Arias Montanus translate it so to comfort
her; the Hebrew gloss has it ad loquendum ad cor ejus, ad consolandam eam;
(...) Ad confabulandum cum ea.
and Kimchi in his commentary, Lehashihhah, ad confabulandum cum ea, which
Iunius follows, and the Tigurin, to talk with her, or we may read it, ut
narrant res laetas, to tell her good news, or glad tidings.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
the Lord accepts of Iephthes vow; although there were many infirmities in
it, yet by faith he pleased God. Heb. 11.32.

EXERCITAT. XII. Of David's vow. Commandment III.
Psalm. 132.2. He swear unto the Lord and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house: nor go up into my bed.
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, etc.
DAvid seeing the ark of God ambulatorie, and having no resting place, but now
in this place and now in that, The cause which moved David to vow.
when he himself had gotten rest from all his enemies, he intends to build
a temple for the Lord; and he makes a vow, neither to come into his new
house, nor ascend up into his bed, nor to give sleep unto his eyes; nor
slumber to his eye lids, until he find out a place for the Lord to dwell in.

When David wrote this psalm.
This psalm was written by David when the arc was carried from the house of
Obed-edom. 1. Chron. 15. We heard of it at Ephrata, What is meant by Ephrata.
that is, in the city of Ephraim. Verse. 6. where the Prophet makes an
allusion betwixt Ephraim and Ephrata; and he said, we heard it in Ephrata, that
is Shiloh, where the arc remained a long time; and therefore it is called the
house of God. Judge. 20.18. And we found it in the fields of the wood, that is,
in Kiriath-Iearim: before he heard of it in Shiloh, but now he found it in
Kiriath-jearim in the house of Aminadah, and so he carried it to Jerusalem,
and purposed there to build an house for it; because it had dwelt long in tents
which were not firm but moveable: but after that he was forbidden by the
Prophet to build the temple, and that his son Solomon was to build the
temple, David dedicateth this psalm to be sung at the bringing of the arc
into the temple.
David dedicateth this psalm to be sung when the temple should be built; and
therefore he calls it a psalm of degrees, for it was the psalm which they
sung upon the thirtenth degree as they ascended into the temple; Why called
psalms of degrees,
for there are twelve psalms of degrees going before: and David who had the
whole form of the temple revealed unto him, saw these degrees as well as the
rest of the temple.

How could David vow that he would never give sleep to his eyes, until he had
built the temple?

The scripture speaks after the common manner, The scripture speaks after
the manner of men.
not that he should not sleep at all; but that scarce he should take a
nappe, or that he should not sleep soundly, or take his rest kindly until he
had built the temple. So it speaks after this manner. Job. 7.13. They sat
down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights; not that they
sat all this time, but the most part of this time they sat upon the ground.

But how performed he this vow,

The Lord who appeared to Nathan that same night released his vow, How David
performed this vow.
and showed him the pattern how the temple should be built; David gathered
materials for the building of the temple; but the particular place was not
revealed unto him where it should be built* he fought many battles with the
Philistims, he committed adultery, and numbered the people; then the angel of
the Lord killed so many thousand of them, and where the angel stood, and held
his hand over the floor of Arauna the Iebusite, there Gad the Prophet showed
him the particular place where the temple should be built.

David is rewarded two manner of ways for this vow. David is richly rewarded
for this vow.
First, a son is promised to him, as if the Lord should say to him; Thou
promisedst to build an house to me; therefore I shall build thee an house,
that is, I will give thee a posterity to succeed unto thee in thy throne: So
Exodus 1.17. The Lord built them houses, that is, he gave them children. So he
that will not build his brothers house. What it is to build the house.
Deuteronomy. 25.19. that is, raise up seed to him.

The second part of the promise is this, that the son which was to come out
of his loins should build the temple, and that Jesus Christ who was also to
come of him should build the spiritual temple; and this vow of David was so
acceptable to God, God promises a protection to the temple for David's cause.
that he promised a protection to the temple and to Jerusalem; not only for
Salomons sake who built the temple, but also for David's sake. 2. King. 19 34. I
will defend this city, and save it for thine own sake, and for thy servant
David's sake.

David did to Solomon.

David's vow here, he was not bound to keep it, because the Lord did not
approve it.

Solomon was bound to build the temple which David had vowed.



EXERCITAT. XII. Of the punishment for the breach of this Commandment.
Commandment. III.
Exodus 20.7. For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in
vain.
HE will not hold him guiltless, the Hebrews speak less and understand
more, Prove. 17.21. The Hebrews express the less and understand the more.
The father of the foolish rejoices not: that is, he is very sad. So Prove.
24.23. It is not good to accept persons in judgment: that is, it is very
evil. So Exodus 20.7. He will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in
vain: that is, he will cerly punish him.

He will not hold him guiltless. Guilt is the obligation to the punishment.
Sin is the transgression of the law, and guilt is the obligation to the
punishment for the transgression of the law; and it is expressed; by fearful
names in the Scripture, as by blood, by debt. By blood, Thy blood be upon thine
own head. 2. Guilt expressed by sundry fearful names.
Sam. 1.10. for as it is a fearful thing for a man that is challenged for
shedding of blood, if the blood be found upon him, as it was upon Ioabs girdle,
and his shoes, when he killed Abner and Hasael. 1. King. 2.5. to come in
before a Judge: so it is for a sinner to come in before the Lord, and the guilt
upon him.

So the Scripture expresses this guilt this ways. Simile.
Let his iniquity return upon his own head, Psalm. 7.16. How iniquity
returns upon the head of the wicked.
Under the law, when a man confessed his sins, all the guilt was laid over
upon the beast, and it was killed for the man, but he that was an obstinate
sinner, and continued in his disobedience; the guilt was not laid upon the
beast, but returned upon his own head, and he died for it. Guilt expressed by
debt.
So this guilt is expressed by debt, and not by little debt, but by talents,
and that many talents, Matt. 18.24. and Matt. 6.2. (...), He is in danger, or
indebted to the Council. And contrary to this is, Not to impute sin. Romans
5.13. To cover sin, Psalm. 32.1. and To blot out sin, Psalm. 51.1.

Sin, guilt and punishment go together.
Sin the transgression of the law, and guilt the obligation to the punishment
for the transgression, and the punishment go together: but many are afraid of
the punishment, who neither are afraid of the sin, or of the guilt of it: How
sin finds out a man.
but where the guilt is, there the punishment will find them out. Number. 32.23.
Your sin will find you out. Sin leaves such a sent behind it, that even
as the dog finds out the hare by the sent; so does the punishment find out
the guilty man by the guilt. The sin passes away, but the guilt remains,
Josh. 22.17. We are not cleansed from the iniquity of Baal-peor unto this day.

Sometimes again the guilt is pardoned, although the sin remain; Sometimes
the guilt is pardoned although the sin remain.
as the guilt of the sins in the children of God is taken away, yet
concupiscence remains in them. There is Materiale in peccato, and formale;
the formal which is the obligation to the punishment is taken away from the
children of God, although the material part remain still, Ier. 50.20. In
those days, and in that time, What the material, and what the formal part in
sin.
says the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall
be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
pardon them whom I reserve. and Romans 8.1. There is no condemnation to them that
are in Christ. There is sin worthy of condemnation, but the Lord pardons
it. When a Magistrate gives over his place, here formale respectivum desinit,
Simile.
men respect him no more as a Magistrate, but yet he remains still a man: so
this (...), or concupiscence remaining after baptism in the child of God, is
sin; but the relation, the guilt, which is the obligation to the punishment,
is taken away; manet vitium, sed tollitur judicium. Cessat (...), sed restat
(...). That irregularity or breach of the law remains still in the child of
God, although the Lord punish him not for it.

Again there is an actual guilt, Reatus Actualis. Potentialis.

and a potentiall guilt in sin; the actual guilt is taken away from the sins
of the justified; but the potentiall guilt is still in them: the matter may be
cleared by this example, The actual guilt taken away from the sin of the
godly but the potentiall remains.
there were serpents in the wilderness which stung the Israelites to death:
there was a viper upon Paul's hand which hurt him not, and there was the brazen
serpent in the wilderness lift up on a pole. The sins of the wicked are like
the serpents that stung the Israelites to death; the sins of the children of
God are like a viper upon Paul's hand, Simile.
although it had a sting in it, yet it was restrained by the power of God, that
it could not hurt him: so the guilt is taken from the sins of the children of
God, that they have no power to sting them: as the viper had no power to sting
Paul's hand: but in heaven there shall be no sting at all, neither potentiall,
nor actual to hurt the children of God, as there was neither actual power,
nor potentiall in the brazen serpent to hurt.

Sin when it is not imputed must be transferred upon another, Where the guilt
is, there the punishment will follow.
and it is punished upon that person upon whom it is transferred and where the
guilt is, there the punishment follows.

If it be said,

This is the natural part of the law, sin be punished this way: What
essential and what accidental to justice.
for as this is essential to the nature of man, that he be a living soul; but
this is only accommodatum natura, or fit for the nature of man, that he have
the use of his right hand; but it follows not always that he has the use of
his right hand: so this is essential to justice, that sin be punished; but
this a thing fitting only, but not essential, that it be punished this or that
way.

The supreme Judge in punishing, remitting or transferring sin upon another
does not contrary to the law.
The supreme Judge, when he uses the mitigation of the law; when he changes
the offenders heart, and breaks off the course of sin in him, and when he
punishes another for him, who does willingly undergo the punishment, and when
he exacteth the rigor of the law in those who continue in their sins; in
none of these he does contrary to the law.

Four ways of proceeding in judgment.
And that we may understand this the better, let us observe that a Judge
proceeds four ways in judgeing. First, he proceeds sometimes (...),
according to the strict rigor of the law, that he will punish the person in
whom the sin is found. Secondly, he proceeds sometimes (...), according to
the mitigation or favorable interpretation of the law. Thirdly, he proceeds
sometimes (...), above the law. And lastly, (...), against the law. Example,
Zaleucus made a law, that the adulter should lose both his eyes; his son
commits adultery, The strict rigor of the law.
if Zalencus should have pulled out both the eyes of his son, that had been
(...), according to the strict rigor of the law. Secondly, if he had spared
both his eyes, Against the law.
that had been (...), against the law. Fourthy, when he spares one of his
eyes, The mitigation of the law.
that was (...), according to the mitigation of the law. Thirdly when he found
out this remedy, Above the law.
that one of his own eyes should be pulled out, and one of his sons eyes,
this was (...), above the law. The law would never have dreamed of this midst,
but it came of the clemency of the king to spare one of his sons eyes; but
that justice might have place, and the law satisfied, he will have two eyes
pulled out.

But if we will look more nearely unto this, It was not an act of perfect
mercy or justice in Zaleucus in sparing one of his sons eyes, and pulling out
one of his own.
it was neither justice nor mercy properly; for if it had been perfect mercy,
both his sons eyes should have been spared; and if it had been perfect
justice, both his eyes should have been pulled out.

Now to apply this to the matter in hand, the soul that is guilty shall die,
now if all who are guilty were condemned, this were according to the rigor of
the law. Secondly, if he should absolve and quit all, this were contrary to
the law. Thirdly, when he concluded that he would save some, this is a
mitigation of the law. Fourthly, when he finds out this remedy to pardon
some, and to satisfy the law by his son who was willing to undergo the
guilt for them; Why God punishes some and spares others.
this is above the law: there is a pardon granted here, and yet the punishment
not remitted, the pardon is granted to some that they may study the more to
keep the law, and the sin is punished in others, that Gods justice may be
fully satisfied.

When the guilt is taken from the sin, it is transferred upon Christ; and he
must undergo the punishment to satisfy the law; because he has given his
word for us.

All sin has guilt with it naturally, The sin of swearing has a fearful
guilt with it.
but especially this sin of swearing; for if a man shall answer for every
idle word at the day of judgment, Matt. 12.36. much more shall he give
account of his idle and blasphemous oaths. In that vision of Ezekiel cap.
2.10. He saw a roll which had written in it lamentations, mourning and woe.
And in that vision of Zachariah. cap. 5. The roll was twenty cubits in length,
Swearing brings the curse and judgment of God upon men.
and ten inbreadth, which would contain a great number of lamentations,
mourning and woes, all these light upon the house of the swearer and blasphemer.

The conclusion of this: Ecclus 23.9. accustom not thy self to swearing,
neither use thy self to the naming of the holy one, for a man that uses
swearing, shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall not depart from
his house. The sin of swearing brings the judgment and the curse of God
upon a man's self and his family, and likewise upon the whole land, Ier.
23.10. So because of swearing the land moarneth, and the pleasant places of the
wilderness are dried up.

Commandment IV.
EXERCITAT. I. Of the word Sabbath, how it is taken in the Scriptures.
Exodus 20.8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
THe word Sabbath is not translated, The word Sabbath is not translated in any
language.
but kept in the original, and passes in all languages, as the word Cherubim,
Pascha, and such.

But when it signifies a whole week, then it is translated; as Levit. 23.15.
The Sabbath signifies a whole week.
And you shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day
that ye brought the sheafe of the wave offering: seven weeks shall be
complete. In the Hebrew it is, seven Sabbaths shall be complete. So in the
Gospel, Ifast twice in the week. Luc. 18.12.

It is distinguished from other Sabbaths by (He) demonstrative, Hasabbath,
Demonstrativum. (...) Sabbathum sabbathorum.
and it is called Sabbath Sabbathon, a Sabbath of Sabbaths, Exodus 31.15. that
is, an excellent Sabbath. Matthew retains the first, calling it Sabbath, and
the Apostle, Heb. 4.9. translateth Sabbathon (...), it is not a diminitive
here, as some would make it, because nun is added to it, as though it signified
(...), or a preparation to the Sabbath; but it is doubled here to signify an
excellent Sabbath above other Sabbaths. The Hebrews express the superlative
diversely, (...)
sometimes they add the name of God (El) to it, when they would express a
great or excellent thing as el gabbish, great hailestones. Ezekiel. 13.11 so ariel
a strong lion, 2. Sam. 20.

Secondly, they express the superlative by putting two synonima or words that
are equivalent in signification together, (...) e coeno luti.
as Psalm. 40.2. He brought me out, Mittit hajaven, e coeno luti, the mirie
clay. And thirdly, by doubling the same word, as Genesis 14.10. putei, putei, to
signify many and deep pits: (...) putei putei.
and so here, Sabbath Sabbathon to signify that great Sabbath. The Jews
comparing this Sabbath with other Sabbaths they call it the Queen, and their
other Sabbaths as Pascha pentecost, and feast of Tabernacles, they compare them
but to concubines, and the days betwixt the first day of the feast, and the
last great day of it, they compare them but to handmaids.

This Sabbath exceeds all other Sabbaths.

high Sabbath, Ioh. 19.31. (For that Sabbath day was an high day) when the
Jews transferred their pascha to it, was the sabbath day more holy, because of
this translation of the pascha to it?

Why the Sabbath was called a high Sabbath.
It is called a high day here only in estimation of the Jews, for the
Scriptures speak of things sometimes s men conceive of them; as Ioh. 18.28.
And they themselves went not into the Judgment hall, lest they should be
defiled: The Scripture Speaks of things as men conceive of them.
that is, as they thought or conceived, they should be defiled.

And from this word Sabbath sundry languages do form and derive their word
signifying the Sabbath. as the Syriack calls it Sabba, Diverse derivations of
the word Sabbath.
and the Greeks following the Syriack, call it (...), and in the plural
number (...) having the accent in the penult syllable: but when it is derived
from the Hebrew word Sabbath, then the Greek termination is (...) having the
accent in antepenultima, and the Apostle following Hellenismum, or the
Grecizing Jews teaches us to put the accent in penultima, therefore they who
derive it from the Hebrew word Sabbath are mistaken.

All the rest of the feasts take their denomination from it, as the feast of
expiation. Levit. 16.21. The rest of the feasts take their denomination from
the Sabbath.
So the seventh years rest, and the Iubile the fiftieth years rest are all
called Sabbaths; and the whole week is called the Sabbath. Levit. 23.15. Luc.
18.12.

The heathen who lived out of the Church, The profane derivation of the
Sabbath according to the heathen.
as Plutarch, made a profane derivation of this word Sabbath, deriving it from
(...) Bacchus, and when they saw the Jews keep it, they said, they kept orgya
Bacchi, the feasts of Bacchus.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
all the feasts took their denomination from the Sabbath, and were called
Sabbaths from it; therefore they were but vassals to the Sabbath, and like
servants called after their masters name, and were to be abolished, whereas
the Sabbath should endure.

EXERCITAT. II. When the Sabbath day begins. Commandment IV.
Genesis 1.8. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
FOr the understanding of this, when the Sabbath begins, we must know first,
what is a natural day, and what is an artificial day: The natural day what.
A natural day is the space of twenty four hours, measured by the presence
and absence of the sun; the presence of the sun is called the day, and the
absence of it is called the night.

An artificial day what.
An artificial day is from the sun rising to the sun setting, as Exodus
18.14. Why sit thou thy self alone, and all the people stand by thee from
morning unto even, and so Ioh. 11.9. Are there not twelve hours in the day.

When the natural day began.
The natural day began in the morning, because the light was the first thing
that was created; this light measured the three first days when it shined; and
it made the night when it withdrew it self: but from the fourth day after the
creation, the sun measured the day, and the moon the night.

The darkness which was upon the face of the depth was not the first night.
That darkness which was upon the face of the earth made not the first night,
it was no part of time, but punctum temporis; for time is the measure of
motion, and it began with the light, and shall end with it. Rev. 10.6. Then
there shall be no more time.

Secondly, the night is the privation of light, and the habit goes always
before the privation; therefore the day was before the night.

Psalm. 104.19. He appointed the moon for seasons, the sun knows her going
down. He appointed the moon for seasons, here the moon is reckoned first,
because the night was before the day, and the sun waits upon her and
knows her seasons.

The sun knows Mebhoo, occasum suum, (...) Sol novit occasum suum, et non
ejus, scilicet Lunae.
for Shemesh is in the common gender: and the sun waits not upon the moon,
but she waits upon the sun; because she has all her light from the sun.
Secondly, David keeps not the order of time here, The order of time not
always kept in the scriptures. Object.
no more then he does in reckoning up of the plagues of Egypt. Psalm. 106.

But the evening and the morning were the first day, therefore the evening has
been before the morning.

The evening is the ending of the light here, (...) vespera finis diei a (...)
miscere, sic dicta, quod tunc lux tenebris commisceri inciptat*
and the morning is the ending of the night; the evening is called Gnerebh from
Gnarabh miscere, because it is partly day, and partly night; and it is called
crepusculum, from the old Latin word crepera, which signifies dubious, as when
we doubt whether it be day or night, and it is amidst betwixt day and night.

There is a twofold midst, medietas aequidistantiae, Medietas Interpositionis.
AEquidistantiae.

and medietas interpositionis; as the sun in the days of Joshua is said to
stand upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon. Josh. 10.13. The
sun stood South-west from the camp of Joshua where it pitched at that time,
in Makkedah as ye go to Bethoron. Verse. 10. which lay betwixt Gibeon and
Ajalon. The sun in the South-west makes three after noone, and yet the sun
is said to stand in the midst of heaven. Verse. 15. although it was three hours
past the meridionall, this was medietas interpositionis.

The second is, medietas aequidistantiae, as when a thing participateth equally
of both the extremes; now when Gnerebh is called the evening, Gnerebh the
evening belongs to the day, and not to the night,
what sort of midst is it? it is not medium aequidistantiae here, but medium
interpositionis; and therefore it belongs to the day, and not to the night.

When Christ is said to lie three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth: How Christ lay three days and three nights in the grave.
Christ was crucified betwixt two evenings at that time when the Pascall Lamb
was killed; the evening here is reckoned for the first day; and the next four
and twenty hours are reckoned for the second day; and he rose upon the third
morning, that was the third day; the morning here Synecdochice is taken for the
whole day, and the night following.



Varro de lingua latina.
There is a threefold morning, First, when there is more darkness than light.
Secondly, when there is a like darkness and light. A three fold morning.
Thirdly, when there is more light than darkness. The first morning belongs
to the night going before; the second stands as a midst betwixt both the day
and the night; and the third morning belongs to the day following: this is
clear out of the scripture; The Evangelists reconciled concerning the time
when Christ rose.
for Matthew Cap. 28.1. says, (...) that is, Serum Sabbathi, the Jews Sabbath
being ended, it began to dawne to the first day of the week; the first part of
those words have relation to the first morning, in which there is more
darkness than light, and the latter part has relation to the third morning,
in which there is more light than darkness. The first morning Mark calls it
(...), the Jews Sabbath being ended, Luke calls it (...), upon the first day
of the week when there was great darkness as yet. Mark calls the third
morning (...), early in the morning the first day of the week, when there was
more light then darkness, and John explaineth this, (...), while as yet there
was some darkness; when the women rose to go to the sepulcher, it was the
first morning being very dark: The time when the women came to the sepulcher.
when they were going to it it was betwixt light and darkness, this was the
second morning; but when they were at the sepulcher, Christ was risen, that was
the third morning. Now when it is said the evening and the morning was the
first day; by the morning here is understood the first part of the morning
ending the night, Gnerebh the even is the ending of the day, and not the
beginning of the night.
rather than beginning the day, as by the first part of Gnereb is understood,
the ending of the day, and not the beginning of the night.

Ezekiel. 24.26.27. Jerusalem should be destroyed, and he commanded him to hold
his peace and not to speak of the destruction of it to the people; and the
Lord gives him a sign, that his mouth should be opened in that day that the
city should be destroyed, and that in that day he would send one to tell him;
he was dumb all this while, and the accomplishment of this prophecy we see.
Ezekiel, 33.22. Where the Prophets mouth was opened unto him in the evening, and
the messenger came to him in the morning: therefore the morning is a part of
the night preceding, and the day begins at the night.

Ezekiel sets down expressly the year, Ezekiel. 24.1. And he opened not his
mouth concerning this matter; from the nineth year to the twelfth, at which
time Jerusalem was destroyed. Cap. 33.22. Then the hand of the Lord was upon
him, and opened his mouth, and he spoke the self same night that the city
was destroyed, and in the morning of that day the messenger came to him; but
this morning could not be a part of that day in which the city was destroyed,
and in which his mouth was opened; because there was three days journey
betwixt Jerusalem and Babylon, where Ezekiel was in the captivity for the
present: therefore this testimony will not serve the turn to prove that the
morning was a part of that day in which his mouth was opened.

Ezekiel that morning.

Jerusalem destroyed only in vision? did Ezekiel hold his peace all this time
only in vision? and saw the Prophet this day of the destruction of Jerusalem
only in a vision? All these things concerning the destruction of the temple,
were really done and not in vision.
this cannot stand; wherefore all these were really done, and he told him of
the destruction of the city; which he could not do in one night being such a
destance betwixt Jerusalem and Babylon. This text then will afford no more but
this, in that day that the man escapes he shall come to thee, and tell thee
of the destruction of the city; and not this, that he shall come the self
same day that he escapes.

Genesis 29.23. Leah was brought to Jacob in the evening, that is, in the night;
otherwise Jacob would have discerned her: therefore the evening belonged to the
night, and not to the day.

The evening has sundry periods.
as the morning has. First, when the sun is declining, secondly, when the
sun is setting, the time betwixt these two was called inter duas vesperas,
betwixt two evenings. Exodus 12.6. These two evenings belong properly to the
day; then there is a third part of the evening, when it is dark night, and
this belongs to the night* and it was in this evening that Laban brought Leah
to Jacob.

Now because the day begins at the morning and not at the evening, it
follows, that the Sabbath must begin at the same period, at which the day
began at the creation.

This fixed period at which the Sabbath begins must be after midnight, The
time when the Sabbath does begin is after midnight.
when it is dawning toward the day, that is, when the day is ascending upward,
therefore Matthew says, Cap. 28.1. When it began to dawne toward the first
day of the week: in the original it is (...) from (...) which signifies to
wax toward the light, although it be not light; (...) Candela separationis.
it signifies not Habhdil the candle of separation, with which the Jews used
to make a distinction betwixt the Sabbath and the day following; neither does
it signify the light of the stars, as some would have it; neither the rising
of the morning star; but that time only when the Sabbath begins to be
kept, and dawneth toward it.

If this be the true beginning of the day after midnight, Ludovicus de Dieu
inannotat. in Matthew.
then the nations who keep a diverse period of the beginning of their day from
this, decline from the first institution; as the Vmbrians at midnight, the
Astronomers at midday, the Babylonians at the sun rising, the Athenians at
the sun setting.

Midnight can not be properly the beginning of the day, The inconveniences that
would follow if the Sabba^h began at any other time than after midnight.
because it partly partaketh of the day going before and partly of the day
following; for the beginning of the day must be after midnight, and it is de
media nocte, and not media nox when it begins.

It cannot begin at the midday, for this is contrary to the first institution;
for here there is neither morning nor evening.

Thirdly, Why the Sabbath cannot begin at the light.
it cannot begin at the light with the Babylonians; for here there would follow
a great absurdity: because they who dwell far North from the equinoctial
line, or far South from it; they have the sun in summer the whole four and
twenty hours, and in winter they want the light of the sun the whole day:
therefore if the Sabbath began here with the light, then their Sabbath should
be twice as long in the summer, and none in the winter: therefore there must
be another period at which the day begins, than the light, or the rising of
the sun.

Why it cannot begin at the sun setting.
Lastly, the setting of the sun cannot be the beginning of the natural day,
for this is contrary to the order of creation, as is said before: therefore no
man ought to invert the order of nature for the beginning of the day, except
God come in by his divine institution and change it, as when he brought the
children of Israel out of Egypt in the evening, and instituted the Passover as
a memorial of that deliverance, he began that day at the evening, which
observation they kept from that night in which they came out of Egypt, until
that morning when Christ rose again from the dead.

The Evangelists speak of the division of the day, according to the Romans
computation.
The Evangelists when they speak of the morning when Christ rose, they speak
according to the reckoning of the Romans, and not according to the reckoning of
the Jews. The Jews at this time had many customs of the Romans amongst them,
because they were subject to them; the Jews divided their night in three
watches, the first they called caput vigiliarum, Lament. 2.19. then they had
the middle watch. Iud. 7.19. and the morning watch. Exodus 14.14. But after the
manner of the Romans they divided their night into four watches, And he came
to them in the fourth watch. Marc. 6.48. So they dated their years according
to the reign of the Princes, who reigned over them, as Luc. 3.1. In the
fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. So the Prophets often times
do reckon by the heathen Kings. So when Alexander came to Jerusalem, they
reckoned their times from his coming, and they called it Era Alexandri, and
so, Era Seleucidarum Alexandri: and so here they followed the Romans in
counting of their day. The Romans divided their day and night into sixtene
parts, The Romans divided their day and night into sixtene parts.
the first part was called Diluculum, 2 Ortus solis, 3 Ascensio diei, 4
Antimedium diei, 5 Meredies, 6 Pomeridianum tempus, 7 Declinatio diei, 8
Occasus solis, 9 Crepusculum, 10 Conticinium, Vide Rosini antiquitates.
11 Ascensio noctis, 12 ante medium noctis, 13 Intempestiva nox, 14 De media
nocte, 15 Declinatio noctis, 16 Gallicinium: all this time De media nocte,
until the rising of the sun is called the morning.

A Demonstration to show at what time the day began in the creation.
Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither thy Moon withdraw it self: for
the Lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall
be ended. Esaias. 60.20.

god who commanded light to shine out of darkness has shyned in our hearts to
give ye light of his glory in christ 2 cor. 4.6.



EXERCITAT. III. Of the Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial part of the Sabbath
day. Commandment IV.
Nehem. 9.14. And made known unto them thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst
them precepts, statutes and laws by the hand of Moses thy servant.
SOme of Moses laws are both moral, judicial and ceremonial. That the first
borne should have a double portion was both moral, judicial, and ceremonial.
Example, to give a double portion to the eldest, there is something natural
in this law, to give a double portion to the eldest, because he was his fathers
strength and first begotten: there was something judicial in this law, he must
have a double portion; because he was to maintain the prerogative of the
first borne in Israel: and there was something ceremonial in this law, as he
got a double portion; because he was a type of Christ, Who was the first borne
amongst many. Romans 8.29.

The judicial part of the law cease now, because the commonwealth of Israel
stands not now. The ceremonial part of the law is taken away, because the
eldest now is not a type of Christ the first borne: but the moral part of the
law remains, that the eldest should have a double portion, because he is his
fathers strength.

Posi ivum Morale. Divinum.

So in the law of the Sabbath there is something morale positivum, the moral
positive part of the law; and secondly, something positivum divinum, the divine
positive part of the law, and both those remain still. Thirdly, there are
somethings judicial in this law, and somethings ceremonial, and those two are
abrogated.

The moral positive part of this law, What is morale positivum in the Sabbath.
and the divine positive part do remain: the Schoolmen say well, Cultus est
a natura, modus a lege, and virtus a gratia. Cultus est a natura, nature it
self teaches us that there must be a time given to the service of God, and
this is morale positivum, the moral positive part of the law, Remember that
thou keep the rest. But to keep the seventh day, What divinum positivum.
Modus est a lege, this was the divine positive part: but the spirit of God
teaches us to sanctify the Sabbath, and this is a gratia, from his grace.

This is the moral positive part of the law, All people have appointed a
certain time for the worship of God.
to have a time for the worship of God; therefore all people have appointed a
certain time for his worship, the Mahumetans keep the sixth day of the week;
the Jews the seventh; the Christians the first day; and the Indians the fourth
day.

The divine positive part of the law is to keep it within seven days, this is
the limitation of God himself, for nature would not teach us to keep one of
seven, more then one of eight.

How can this law bind us more than any other of Moses judicial laws;

This divine positive part binds all men, This divine positive law binds us
strictly, because it was given to Adam before his fall.
because it was given to Adam before his fall, and he represented all
mankind; therefore this divine positive law has a greater force to bind us,
then other of Moses positive laws which did bind only the Jews in Judea.

It may be said that ceremonies are changable:

Ceremonies of order appointed by the Church may be changed, Ceremonies of
order may be changed by the Church.
but this cannot be changed; for although it be not the natural part of the
law, yet it has the properties of the natural part; for that which is the
moral and divine natural part of the law, cannot be revoked without a stain
of the Lords holiness, as that adultery should be no sin; The moral divine
natural part of the law cannot be revoked without a stain of Gods holiness.
but this circumscription of the day might be altered to the fourth or fifth
day without any stain of Gods holiness; yet because it is the divine positive
part which God himself has set down, and gave to Adam before his fall,
therefore it cannot be altered or changed.

The judicial part of the Sabbath is the ease of man and beast.
The judicial part of this law is the ease of man and beast. So in the seventh
year the land was to rest for the ease of man and beast. Levit. 25.6. for the
stranger and for thy servant etc. The Lord had a special respect to his people
as he was their governor, lawgiver, and captain, Judge. 8.23. And they were
Feudarij his fewers who in a special manner held their land of him, and in
this respect especially, he gave them their judicial laws.

The ceremonial part of this law of the Sabbath.
The ceremonial part of this law consisted in the manner how they kept their
sabbath, they had a double sacrifice for it, they might kindle no fire on it,
Exodus 35.3. They might dress no meat that day, they were limited to a Sabbath
days journey, their Sabbath began in the evening and ended in the evening, and
it was a type to them of all the benefits which they were to receive in Christ
to come.

Not to kindle fire on the Sabbath was a ceremonial law.
They might kindle no fire this day, this was a ceremonial part of their
service; and it seems but to have continued as long as they were in the
wilderness. When Christ went to eat bread in the house of one of the chief
Pharisees upon the Sabbath day, Luc. 14.1. is it probable that there was no
fire that day to dress the meat? Their Sabbath was a day of joy unto them, and
they laid aside their sackcloth that day, and they had a feast that day, The
Jews Sabbath was a day of joy to them.
which was a part of their ceremonial worship, Judith. 10.3.

Whether are we as strictly bound to keep the Sabbath, as the Jews were
under the law?

We are not so strictly bound to the letter, The Sabbath a part of the Jews
pedagogie.
for it was a part of their pedagogie under the law. When they made a feast
that day, it was a remembrance to them of the benefits which they were to get
in Christ to come, The Sabbath was a type to the Jews of all the benefits
which they were to receive in Christ.
and therefore that occasion ceasing, we are not bound to it; we may fast upon
the Sabbath, and humble our selves when occasion serves: but we are more
bound to the moral rest than they were; the Lord says, Joel 2.19. Rent your
hearts and not your garments: We are more bound to the moral rest of the
Sabbath than the Jews were.
the moral part of this law binds us more then it did bind the Jews, in
respect of the greater measure of knowledge which we have now; but the
literal part of the law did bind the Jews, but it does not bind us; for
they were to rent their clothes as well as their hearts in the day of
humiliation. What a Sabbath days journey was.


They might go no further that day than a Sabbath days journey; they measured
their journey two ways; (...) diaeta terrae.
the first was their common measure, and that was called Cibhrath haaretz,
diaeta terrae, Genesis 35.16. that is, as much ground as a man might go from
morning to breakfast, or from breakfast to dinner; the Seventy translate it
(...), that is, as much ground as a horse will run in a carrear or a spurt:
so far was it betwixt Bethlehem and Rama. The second measure of their
journey, was the measure for the Sabbath, which was as far distant as betwixt
the uttermost tent and the tabernacle, (...) Terminus Sabbaths.
which was two thousand cubits, Josh. 3.4. And this they called Tehhum Sabbath,
terminus Sabbathi; (...) miliare.
and so they call it mil miliare, that is, an Italian mile: The Syriack has
it, almost seven furlongs: but when they came to Canaan, they might go as
far upon the Sabbath as the space betwixt their houses and their Synagogues,
every man's house was not so nere the Synagogue as mount Olivet was to
Jerusalem; How far the Jews might go upon the Sabbath in Canaan.
thus much ground of two thousand cubits kept still the name of a Sabbath days
journie, although they might go further upon the Sabbath then two thousand
cubits. Some do hold that a Sabbath days journey after that they came to
Canaan was as much ground, as they might go after the evening sacrifice was
ended, but this would be a very uncertain measure of ground; for then it might
be longer or shorter, according to the length or shortness of the day.

This was a part of the ceremonial Sabbath to begin at the evening, and end at
the evening, Nehem. 13.19. This was ceremonial in the Sabbath to begin at the
evening.
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark,
before the Sabbath, I commanded the gates to be shut.

Lastly, their Sabbath was a pledge to them of all the benefits which they were
to receive in Christ to come; in the allegorical signification, their Sabbath
signified to them Christ resting in the grave; What the Sabbath signified
allegorically, tropologically and anagogically.
in the tropologicall signification, it signified to them their rest from their
servile works, and works of the flesh: and in the anagogicall signification, it
signified to them their eternal rest.



this day for our labors; Typus Destinatus. Arbitrarius.

so we shall rest one day in the heavens from our sins, but this is only an
arbitrarie type. So the head and the body are but arbitrarie types of Christ
and his Church: so the seven golden candlesticks. Revelat. 1.13. are but
arbitrarie types to the seven Churches in Asia, and comparisons are borrowed
from those.

How shall we discern those things which are forbidden by a moral law,

That which is forbidden by a ceremonial law is forbidden at one time, and not
at another. Example, To know what things are forbidden by a ceremonial, and
what by a moral law.
to kindle fire upon the Sabbath is a ceremonial law, because it was forbidden
to them only upon the Sabbath; they might kindle fire at the Pascha and the
Pentecost. So abstinence from leaven, was but a ceremonial law, because it was
forbidden only at the Pascha, and not at the rest of the feasts; but to buy and
sell is forbidden in all their three feasts: therefore it is a moral precept,
they might buy nothing upon the day of the Passover, therefore they bought all
necessaries the day before. Ioh. 13.27. So that which is forbidden to some
persons and not to all is a ceremonial thing. Example, no Nazaret might drink
wine, and the Priest might not drink wine when he entered into the
Congregation, but other persons might drink wine, therefore it is but a
ceremonial law. So for the place, no man might carry a vessel through the
temple. Mark. 11.16. but out of that place, any man might carry a vessel,
therefore it was but a ceremonial law.

The conclusion of this is, this law of the Sabbath has something moral,
judicial, and something ceremonial, therefore we must study to distinguish
those three, that we may know what part of the commandment binds us
perpetually in this precept.

EXERCITAT IIII. Of the difference betwixt the Sabbath and other feast days.
Commandment IIII.
Exodus 31.15. The seventh day is a Sabbath of Sabbaths unto the Lord.
(...) dies bonus.
FIrst, the Sabbath day differed from Iom Tobh, a good day; Secondly, it
differed from Gnazeroch, dies interdicti; Thirdly, from Mognadim their three
great feasts.

Dies bonus, a good day what.
First, it differed from dies bonus, a good day. 1. Sam. 25.8. a good day, was a
day wherein they met only to be merry, but they kept no religious exercise
that day:

The Chaldee paraphrast upon this says, we are commanded to keep the Sabbath
and good days, that is, the feasts; and not to go above two thousand cubits,
but good days are not so taken in the scriptures as applied to their feasts:
but to a day for banqueting only. And it was festum fori, Fastum Fori. Chori.

non chori, as the schoolmen speak; such a feast was that commemoration of
Pur, it was commanded by Mordechai to be kept in remembrance of the rest from
their enemies; Pur was a politic cessation only.
it is not called Mogned, as the rest of their feasts are, but Tzemim tempus,
it is not called a Sabbath; it is said there that they rested from their
enemies, (...) tempus. (...) cessare.
the word is Nuah, but not Shabbath to rest, but not to rest as on the Sabbath
or on their feasts. The days of Pur were but a politic cessation, and they
were good days, (...) quiescere.
but not holy days.

they read the book of Esther, as may be seen in their Calendar.

The liturgy was not appointed by Mordechai, The Jews liturgy upon the days
of Pur was not appointed by Mordecha^.
but by the Jews afterward; the Jews at this day upon the foureteenth and
fifteenth of Adar read the history of Esther, and as often as mention is made
of Haman, they knock upon the table of the Synagogue, Vide Schinlerum in voce
Pur. (...) dies interdicti
as though they would beat out his brains, and they cry, cursed be Haman, but
blessed be Mordechai; cursed be Zeresh, but blessed be Esther.

Secondly, the Sabbath differed from Gnazereth, The Sabbath differed from
Gnazereth,
or dies inter dicti. Joel. 1.13. they are called Gnazereth, or dies
interdicti, because the hands of men were shut up at these times from work;
and these were kept when some great and heavy judgment of God was upon the
Church. Gnazereth or dies interdicti were appointed to be kept for some great
judgment.
Such was the fast of the fourth month when Jerusalem was taken. Ier. 29.6. So
the fast of the fifth month, the seventh day, for the burning of the temple,
this fast, Ier. 51.12. is said to be kept the ninth day, it seems then that
this fast was kept both the days, for the great desolation that was then;
their third fast was kept in the seventh month Tishri, and this was for the
slaughter of Gedaliah. 2. King. 25.25. Their fourth fast was in their tenth
month Tebbeth, when Nebuchadnezzar burnt Jerusalem: these Gnazereth were but
occasional, and not perpetual as the Sabbath was, therefore Zach. 8.19. The
Lord promised to turn these fasts into joy and gladness, and into cheerful
feasts.

Thirdly, The Sabbath differed from their great feasts.
the Sabbath differed from the festival days called Mognadim.

The first difference betwixt those feasts and the Sabbath was this; The feasts
had no preparation as the Sabbath had.
those feasts had no (...) or preparation going before them, but the Sabbath
had still a preparation going before it, and it was called (...) or pervigilium
Sabbathi.

Ioh. 19.14. It was the preparation to the Passover; therefore the Passover had
a preparation as well as the Sabbath.

a great Sabbath. Ioh. 19.31. And the preparation was then in respect of the
Sabbath, and not in respect of the festival day; their other feasts besides
the Sabbath needed no preparation.

The festival days were transferred to the Sabbath, and why?
Secondly, the Sabbath and their festival days differed in this, they used to
transfer their festival days to the Sabbath, but the Sabbath stood
immovable, and could never be removed to any of their feasts: they used, as
the Jews say, to transfer their other holy days to the Sabbath, propter
olera and mortuos, that is, because their meats and dead bodies could not be
kept from corruption two days together, and especially in Tisri answering to
our Autumn: therefore they made the feast day a common day, and upon it they
prepared their meat and buried their dead, and they transferred the religious
exercises of that day to the Sabbath.

All the sacrifices of their feasts gave way to the Sabbath. Talmud in tract.
de paschate. cap. 5.
So the sacrifices of all their feasts gave way to the Sabbath; their daily
evening sacrifice was killed at eight of the clock and an half, according to
the Jews counting of their hours, that is, half an hour before three, and
offered at the ninth hour and an half, that is, half an hour after our
three: but in the evening of the Passover it was killed half an hour before
seven, and offered half an hour before eight, that is, according to our
calculation, it was killed half an hour after one, and offered half an hour
after two of the clock; and this they did that they might rest the evening of
the Sabbath.

Fourthly, the Sabbath had a double sacrifice appointed for it, The Sabbath had
a double sacrifice.
whereas their feasts had their own particular sacrifices.

Fifthly, The Sabbath was kept in the wilderness.
the Sabbath was kept in the wilderness and in the captivity, and he that
brake the Sabbath in the wilderness, was stoned to death, but those feasts
were not kept in the captivity, and the Passover but once kept in the
wilderness. Number. 9.5.

Lastly, The whole week took denomination from the Sabbath.
the Sabbath and other festival days differ in this, the whole week took
the denomination from the Sabbath. Luc. 18.12. I fast twice in the Sabbath,
that is, in the week. So Act. 13.42. The Gentiles besought that these words
might be preached unto them, (...), that is, in the middle of the week.

The difference betwixt the Sabbath and the week days was this, The
difference betwixt the Sabbath and week days.
every Sabbath day they came to hear the scriptures, read and expounded. Marc.
1.21. Luc. 4.31. So Act. 14.15. and 15.21. but on the week days they met but
occasionally, as Act. 17.10. Esaias. 58.2. They seek me daily to know my ways:
they sought the Lord daily, but the Sabbath day was the appointed time to seek.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
the Jews had many Sabbaths, and now we have but one, and therefore we
should be more careful in observing of it; nam vis unita fortior. For as a
river divided into many streams runs the more slowly, and united into one
runs the more strongly, so the affections set upon more objects are not so
intended, as when they are set upon one.

EXERCITAT. V. Of the sanctification of the Sabbath. Commandment IIII.
Esaias. 58.13. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord,
honorable, and shall honor him, etc. Then I will cause thee ride upon the
high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob.
God who made the creature, has only power to separate it for a holy use.
GOD sanctifies his Sabbath, and man sanctifies it, God sanctifies the
Sabbath because he made it; he that made the creature has power to sanctify
it, and to separate it for a holy use: he that made the bread and the wine may
set a new stamp upon these creatures, and appoint them for his sacrament. So
he that made the days may separate a day for his own use and service,
Sanctificat^ Constitutiva. Invocativae.

and this is constitutiva sanctificatio; but when man is said to sanctify the
Sabbath, it is but invocativa sanctificatio, that is, he desires of God that
grace, that he may sanctify it, and keep it holy.

How the Lord is said to sanctify the Sabbath.
Again God is said to sanctify it. Ezekiel. 20.12. I gave them my Sabbath to be
a sign betwixt me and them, that they may know that I am the Lord who
sanctifies them; the Lord sanctifies this day when he sanctifies man to
keep it holy. A man is said to do a thing when he endeavors to do it,
although he do it not, but the Lord gives a man grace and sanctifies him.

Time is called holy improperly.
The Lord is said to sanctify the Sabbath, because he separateth it from a
profane use to a religious use; time in it self is not sanctified, it is but
numerus motus; and it is called holy improperly only, because it is the
measure of holy actions: so the Angel said to Sara, I will return to thee at
the time of life. Genesis 18.14. Time in it self does not live, it is only the
measure of living things: The Sabbath is the measure of holy actions.
so the Sabbath is sanctified when it is made the measure of holy actions.
Works to be done that day, are the works for the soul especially, all the
week long a man's travel is for his mouth. Eccles. 6.7. and the Sabbath is for
the soul, a noble day in respect of the week days; and he that exercises
himself that day as he ought, is the Lords freeman.

There are sundry sorts of people who sanctify not the Sabbath, some mock the
Sabbath and scorn it. Some are mockers of the Sabbath.
Lament. 1.7. The adversaries saw her, and did mock at her Sabbaths. Augustine
says of Seneca, that he mocked the Jews because they spent the seventh part
of their life in idleness, and the heathen called the Jews Sabbatarij, in
derision.

There is another sort of people who think the Sabbath a burden to them. Amos.
8.6. Some are weary of the Sabbath.
When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn; and the Sabbath,
that we may set forth wheat?

There are some who make the Sabbath their delight. To some the Sabbath is a
delight.
Esaias. 58.13. Some kept the Sabbath of the golden calfe; Aaron said, To morrow
is a feast to the Lord. Exodus 32.5. Three sorts of men who do not sanctify
the Sabbath.
and how kept they this feast? They sat down to eat and to drink, and rose
to play. Verse. 6. Others keep it as the ox keeps the Sabbath, they rest from
labor, but they serve not the Lord that day, but they know not that Sabbath a
Sud, that internal and secret rest. There is a third sort who begin the
Sabbath, (...) arcanum secretum.
but continue not in the worship of God, they think that a part of it is
sufficient for God, and they make it diem intercisum, a half holy day, and
some will abstain from labor that day, but not from pastime; but the
sanctification of the Sabbath requires both abstinence from labor and
pastime, and that for these reasons.

Reasons proving abstinence from labor and pastime on the Sabbath.
The first is taken from the institution of the Sabbath, the Sabbath was
instituted in innocence, when man The Sabbath given to Adam, in which he might
meditate upon Gods work.
the Lord appointed not this rest for any wearisomenesse or want of recreation;
but the Sabbath was instituted, that he might have a day to meditate upon Gods
works freely; The end of the Sabbath is not rest chiefly.
in the week days he was dressing the garden which would have brought some
distraction to the mind; therefore the Lord would have a day set a part for
himself, that man might meditate upon him and his works: Now if Adam who had
no sin within him, or evil example without him, notwithstanding of his well
disposed heart to Gods service had need of a day; what need have we then of a
day who are sinners? This argument serves against those who think that the
end of the Sabbath is, that men may refresh themselves, this could not befall
Adam because he was not weary; rest I grant is commanded here, but it is ad
aliud, for holiness, and not for gaming.

The Sabbath not appointed for pastime.
the negation of labor is the position of holiness and sanctification, the
one is taken away that the other may be placed; but pastime and gaming after
public service are a let to the rest of this day, for it is all alike holy.
The Romans made a law ne quis lanam Tarento eveheret, that none should carry
wool out of Tarentum, but some who carried sheep out of Tarentum were
punished as transgressors of the law; because they who carried out sheep
carried out wool: and quod una via prohibetur, ad id alia via perveniri non
potest, that which is forbidden one way, we cannot come to it by another way;
to profane the Sabbath by works is forbidden, therefore it is forbidden also
to profane it by pastime.

No time has any inherent holiness in it, Reasonable creatures are the
subject of holiness.
for reasonable

That which is most large and most permanent, is the principal and essential
part of the commandment. But albeit David could not have access to the house
of the Lord, Men are bound to keep the Sabbath by private exercises if they
cannot keep it publicly.
as the swallows and the sparrowes had to the altar, yet he was bound to
keep the Sabbath, and in the captivity they were bound to keep this day
holy, as a man in prison is bound to keep it holy by private exercises;
therefore Christ bids his Disciples pray that their flight be not on the
Sabbath. Mat. 24. This argument makes against those who think that we are
bound to think upon divine service no longer then we are in the Church.

Small works are forbidden that day; Small works are forbidden on the Sabbath.
was it not a Mary Magdalene would buy nothing for the annoynting of Christ
until the Sabbath was past. Seeing then the Lord forbids such small things,
we cannot say that the Sabbath was instituted for refreshing of our wearied
bodies onley.

They say that the ^^nne shines in some places almost twenty and four hours,

Put the case that we dwell under the pole where the sun shines half a
year, revolution of the sun to the same point, Where the sun shines long,
the Sabbath is to be measured by the revolution of it to the same point.
Conclusion.
in a part of which time a man may sleep and take his rest, as he that has a
night in that time.

The conclusion of this is, God gives us six whole days to our own use,
therefore we should give him a whole for his Sabbath, or else we have two
measures in our bag, a little to meet out with, and a great to receive in,
which is abomination to the Lord.

EXERCITAT. VI. That man is commanded to labor six days. Commandment IV.
Exodus 20.9. Six days shall thou labor and do all that thou have to do.
Whether is this a precept or permission.
Six days shall thou labor; the Lord commands his people to labor six
days, this is not a permission but a precept, it is not left arbitrarie to
them, as if he should say, Ye may labor, but it is commanded, Ye shall labor
six days. So Act. 1.22. One shall be a witness with us of his resurrection,
that is, I command him to be a witness, and not this way, it is free for him
to be a witness, or he may be a witness.



Affirmativa ligant semper, sed non ad semper, negativa ligant semper and ad
semper: the affirmatives bind not simply without intermission, but the
negative precepts bind without intermission.

They had their morning sacrifice when they entered to their work, and their
evening sacrifice when they ended their work: they gave God the first part of
the day and the last, although they were days appointed for work. And Job.
23.12. I have esteemed the words of his mouth more then my necessary food. They
would not omit this duty for their meat, far less for their labor: and
they divided the day in three parts, the first ad tephilla, orationem: the
second ad torah, legem; The Jews gave a part of the work days to the Lord.
and the third ad malacha, opus: although they were days appointed for work,
yet they gave the Lord his part of them every day.

Six days shall thou labor. God has given man six days, therefore it is
good reason that he give the Lord one: Great reason that God have one day
seeing he gives six to man.
he gave Adam leave to eat of the fruit of all the trees in paradise, except
one; therefore he should have reserved that one, for God. If the Lord had
given but one day to man, and taken fix to himself, yet he was to obey; but
now when he has given him fix, and taken but one to himself, how can any
man refuse to give him this day? what if the Lord had commanded thee some great
thing would not thou have done it? 2. King. 5.13.

Six days shall thou, labor that thou may rest the seventh, a man should
always remember Gods service, and make it his last and principal end. 1. Cor.
10.31. Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
the glory of God. He should be diligent in his calling upon the week days,
that he may rest upon the Sabbath from the works of his calling. He that is
not faithful in his calling, To be diligent in their calling, and to keep the
Sabbath go together.
will never care to keep the Sabbath; and he that keeps the Sabbath will be
diligent in his calling: those two are like the two cherubins whose faces
looked one toward another.

There is a special note of remembrance set before the Sabbath as a phylactery
to cause men to remember it; and this is a part of the phylactery, Do all that
thou have to do: do the work of thy calling upon the week days, that thou
may keep the Sabbath.



Levit. 19.23. When a man planted a vineyard, the Lord commanded that he
should not eat of the fruit of it for three years, and all that time the
trees should be uncircumcised; but the fourth year the fruit of it should be
holy unto the Lord, and in the fifth year they are bidden profane their
vineyards, that is, to turn them to common uses; there was no man might use
the fruit of the fourth year, A man cannot separate a day to make it holy.
but it was dedicated to God, and in the fifth year they were commanded to make
it common: so no man may profane the Sabbath appointed for Gods service, so
neither may they separate any of the rest of the days of the week, to make
them holy for Gods service as the Sabbath. When a man separateth a particular
day for the worship of God, it makes it not holy, as the Sabbath is. Seir the
Casuist says, Ecclesia potest abolere dies festos, determinatio diei est a
jure humano, Seirus lib. 7. cap. 13.
and consuetudo plurimum potest in jure humano, sanctificatio est a lege
divina, the Church may abolish holy days, for the determination of them is but
from man, and custone prevails much in the laws of men; but the
sanctification of a day is from God: God only may sanctify a Sabbath for
himself, tempus non est inter privata bona: but it is numbered among such
things as a^e common to all, as the air and water: and quod divini juris est,
nullius in bonis est; therefore man cannot separate time as God does for his
service, and their separation is but occasional and alterable.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, God has given man six days to labor and do his
own work, that he may keep the Sabbath, and have Gods blessing upon his
travels; he must seek a blessing upon the Sabbath to all his travels in the
week days. For Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that
build it, except the Lord keep the city, the watchman watches but in vain.
Psalm. 127. So they labor in vain who work all the week, except the Lord
bless their travels; and the Sabbath is the day in which he blesses the
works of his children, He opens his hand every day and satisfies the desire
of every living thing, Psalm. 144.16. But he has another storehouse which he
opens to his children upon the Sabbath.

EXERCITAT. VII. No work to be done upon the Sabbath. Commandment. IV.
Exodus 20.10. In it thou shall not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates.
THe interdiction is here set down, not to break the Sabbath, first the
father is forbidden, the son and the daughter, the manservant and the
maidservant who should religiously observe it, and the stranger is forbidden
that he should not give offense to others, and thirdly the beast that he should
not give an occasion to work that day.

First, Reformation must begin at the head.
the father of the family is forbidden to do any work. Reformation must begin
at the head first, as in a kingdom, at the king. Psalm. 101. this is his gate.
So in a Magistrate, as in Joshua cap. 24. I and my house will serve the Lord;
this is his gate. So the master of a private family. Moses before he was a
magistrate should have circumcised his son. When reformation begins at the
head, then the Scripture says, Salvation is come to thee and to thine house,
Luc. 19.9. because they are the means to instruct and inform their household:
and even as the balm laid upon Aarons head ran down to the hem of his
garment, Psalm. 133.2. So when the father of a family is religious, then
religion descends from him to his children, to his manservant, and to his
maidservant.

Nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant nor thy maidservant. Observe
that in matters of religion there is no difference betwixt bond and free, In
matters of religion no difference betwixt male and female, bound or free.
male and female, Galat. 3.28. betwixt bond and free; therefore the servant
paid the half shekell as well as the master did, Exodus 30.15. betwixt male
and female; therefore the daughters in Canaan might succeed to their fathers
inheritance as well as the males, Number. 36.

Necessitas obedientia non excusat servum, sed necessitas coactionis excusat
servum.
Thy manservant, nor thy maidservant. Some hold that servants may work upon
the Sabbath day at their masters commandment, and that the commandment is
only given to the master, Seitus lib. 7. cap. 28. en casibus.
and that the sin lies upon him if he cause his servant to work, and not
upon his servant: but the Lords commandment forbids all equally, whether
they be masters or servants, the meanest servant is within the covenant as well
as their master who commands. Nehemiah did contest with his servants for
breaking of the Sabbath, He saw some treading winepresses upon the Sabbath day,
and bringing in sheaves, and loading asses, and also wine, grapes and figs,
and all manner of burdens which they brought in Jerusalem upon the Sabbath,
Neh. 13.15. the most part of these were servants: and why did Nehemiah contest
with them, if servants were not bound to keep the Sabbath as well as their
masters?

And the stranger that is within thy gates. Advena Iustitia. Porta.

There were two sorts of strangers amongst them, the first was advena justitia,
and the second advena portae. Advena justitiae was he that was a proselyte and
converted, and he was either Toshebh, inhabitans, (...) Inhabitans. (...)
Externus (...).
who was converted and had dwelt long amongst them; the seventy translate it
(...), a parishoner: Or Ger who was newly converted, the Seventy translate him
(...) a proselite. Such proselytes were Arauna the Iebusite, Vriah the Hittite,
Ebed-melech, Iethro and such. David makes mention of these strangers, Psalm.
135.19. Bless the Lord o house of Israel: Bless the Lord o house of Aaron:
Bless the Lord o house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord bless the Lord: ye
that fear the Lord, that is, all strangers converted, and proselytes who were
joined to Israel and Aaron. Esaias 65.3. Let not the stranger say, the Lord has
separated me. They might eat the passover with the rest of the Israelites,
Exodus 13.48. and of these strangers it is not meant here, for the charge is
directly given to them as to the Israelites, that they should do no manner of
work; but it is meant of that stranger that was advena porta, Strangers that
were not converted are meant here.
such strangers as dwelt amongst them occasionally, but were not converted, or
become Proselytes, those were bound to rest from their labors upon the
Sabbath, that they should not give offense to the people of God; Such were that
mixed multitude that came out of Egypt, Exodus 12.38. Number. 11.4. And an hundred
and fifty three thousand and six hundredth in Salomons time, 2. Chron. 2.17.
And those strangers, if they continued any while amongst the Jews, they were
to learn the seven precepts of Noah; and this way they were to be brought
piece and piece to the truth, until they came to be proselytes.

Now the beast is commanded to rest upon the Sabbath, The beast is not the
proper subject of this law.
the beast here is not the proper subject of this law. The Schoolmen say well,
quando finis praecepti particularis alius est a re precepta in genere, tunc non
cadit sub praeceptum: When the end of the particular precept is different from
the general precept, then it falls not under the general precept. The end
of the law is, that God should be worshipped upon the Sabbath; the reason why
the beast should not work, is, because if the beast should work, the man must
work with the beast: the Lord says, Thou shall not muzze the mouth of the ox
etc. has God regard of oxen? Why the beast should not work.
1. Cor. 9.6. The Lord gave this law, not for the ox cause, but for man's
cause: so here when he bids the beasts rest upon the Sabbath, it is not for
the beasts sake, but for man's sake; the beasts because they have labored for
man all the week long, they should rest; but this is a duty required in the
sixth Commandment, The merciful man has pity upon his beast, Prove. 12.10.
Piety is the subject of the first table, and mercy of the second.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, that all must be within the covenant from the
highest, to the lowest none is excepted. Deuteronomy. 29.10. You stand this day all of
you before the Lord your God: your captains of your tribes, your elders, and
your officers, with all the men of Israel, your little ones, your wives, and
the stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of the wood unto the drawer
of the water, that thou should enter in covenant with the Lord thy God this
day.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Whether the Sabbath was from the beginning or not.
Commandment IV.
Exodus 20.11. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day.
WE have shown who should rest upon the Sabbath, the next thing to be
considered, is, the reason why we should rest upon the Sabbath, because God
rested from all his works; the reason why the Jews did keep the Sabbath upon
the seventh day from the creation, was, The reason why we keep the first day
of the week.
because God rested that day from all his works: which reason binds not us
Christians now directly, because God rested not from all his works upon our
Sabbath; but because Christ rested from all his works upon our Sabbath;
triumphed over death and hell; therefore we should keep it. Why the seventy
translate it, God rested the sixth day.


The seventy translate these words thus, God rested from his works the sixth
day; and they give the reason why they translate it the sixth day, and not the
seventh, lest king Ptolomie should have asked them; did God work any thing
upon the seventh day before he rested? but it should not be translated, God
rested from creating of new kinds that are perfect.
he rested from all his works quae fecit, sed quae fecerat, that is, he
rested from all his works the seventh day which he had made the sixth day, and
where it is said, he rested from all his works, it is to be understood (as the
Schoolmen say) he ceased a no vis speciebus perfectis creandis, sed non ab
imperfectis: when he creates daily, souls of men, these are not perfectae
species, for the body is begotten by generation, and the soul is only created
of nothing. Ps. 102.18. The people that shall be created etc. this is meant of
their souls, and not of their bodies: (...) Nutrix ab (...) fid^lem esse.
for their bodies are begotten by generation. When the beasts are begotten it
is a work of generation, but not of creation: and the Lord ceased not from
ruling and preserving those creatures which he had made: God rested not from
the works of his providence and preservation.
therefore Prove. 8.30. it is said, I was as a nurse with him: and even as great
men commit their children to nurses; so the Lord after that he created the
world, committed the care of it to his providence, as to a nurse.

God rested from all his works; therefore he would have us to rest from our
works.

Four sorts of rest.
There are four sorts of rest, the first is a natural rest, as when Christ sat
down at the well to rest him. Ioh. 4.6. Secondly, a rest from sin; thirdly,
a typical rest, Heb. 4.9. fourthly, that eternal rest in heaven, Esaias 66.23.
Sin is our most proper labor, and most wearisome labor, to work in brick
and clay in Egypt was not like it, Sin is the most wearisome labor.
it is called (...), labor, and it is like quicksilver, Habet principium motus
in se, sed non quietis, still trembling, but never at rest. We must rest also
from the works of our callings, in our callings There is much vexation of
spirit, Eccles. 1.14.

Rest is the habit, and moving a privation; when a man rests that he may
labor again, that is not a perfect rest; when a man is carried contrary to
nature, then the motion is violent, and the rest is comfortable: the motion of
sin is contrary to nature, therefore the rest from sin must be comfortable;
The motion of sin is contrary to nature.
they who rest not from sin here, shall not rest in the life to come, Revel.
14.11. They that worship the beast shall never rest, neither day nor night.

God sets down his example for imitation.
The Lord sets down his example for imitation to us because he rested that
day, Exodus 16. And they say that these words (The Lord rested from all his
works the seventh day) were a reason added to Moses Sabbath, when the law was
given, but not to Adams Sabbath before the fall.

But we answer, Moses: Something in the Sabbath natural from the beginning,
and something added by Moses.
in the reason of the fifth commandment; this was juris naturae, given to Adam
and all his posterity before the fall, Honor thy father and thy mother that
thy days may be long, that is, that thou may live a long time happily here,
and then to be translated to another life: but this was juris Mosaici; That thy
days may be long in the land whither thou art to go. So this was juris
naturae in the reason added to the Sabbath, thou shall rest from all thy
works, because God rested from his works, but this is only juris Mosaici,
that the Sabbath should be a sign betwixt God and them; and belongs not to
Adams Sabbath. Ezekiel. 20.10. I brought them out of Egypt and gave them my
Sabbaths, that they might be a sign betwixt me and them: To rest upon the
Sabbath was natural to it from the beginning; but that it should be a sign
betwixt God and the people was accessorie to it in Moses time.
The Sabbath was a particular sign to them of their bringing out of Egypt, and
they should always remember to keep it; because the Lord brought them out of
Egypt; the Sabbath was from the beginning, but it was accessory to the Jewish
Church that it was made a sign, as the rainebow was from the beginning; (the
reflexe of the sun in a cloud) but it was not a sign to the world until
after the deluge.

But they say, Genesis of the Sabbath, or that any of the Patriarchs kept it.

We read nothing that the adulterous or incestuous persons were put to death
before Iudahs time, did the Patriarchs suffer this sin to be unpunished all
this time? The Patriarchs had an appointed time for Gods worship.
and is it probable that the holy men of God who sacrificed to the Lord and
worshipped him, had not a certain time for his worship determinate to them? the
Lord sanctified his Sabbath as soon as he rested from his works, and he set
up the sun and the moon Lemognadim, (...) In statuta tempora.
(which is the word used afterward in the law for their holy conventions) ad
statua tempora. What appointed times were then for his worship, if not the
Sabbath? for as yet they had none of their anniversary feasts.

that thou may rest, and thy servant may rest, belonged not to Adams Sabbath,
for Adam before the fail was not wearied, and there should have been no
servile subjection before the fall; therefore these words belong only to Moses
Sabbath.

Adam should not have been wearied in dressing of the garden, Albeit man had
stood in innocence, yet there should have been distinctions of superiority,
degrees and sexes.
yet he behoved to rest, that he might exercise himself only in the worship
of God; and although servile subjection came in after sin, yet if man had not
fallen, there should have been degrees of superiority and inferiority, and
there should have been a distinction of ages, sexes, and dignities.

Ioh. 7.22. Christ makes an opposition betwixt two laws, one of circumcision,
and another of the Sabbath; and he says that circumcision is kept, not because
Moses instituted circumcision, but because it was from the fathers: and because
Moses law of the Sabbath was given after the law of circumcision; therefore it
is that infants are circumcised upon the Sabbath, and yet the Sabbath is not
broken.

rest of the ceremonies belonging to it, which Christ especially means of
here; but the moral part was given to Adam before his fall; Christ makes an
opposition betwixt the ceremony of the Sabbath and the ceremony of circumcision.
he makes but opposition here betwixt the ceremony of circumcision, and the
ceremony of the Sabbath; the less necessary ceremony gave place to the
greater, and the Jews say, when a child was to be circumcised upon the
Sabbath, yet the morning sacrifice behoved to be offered first before the child
was circumcised; and then all the rest of the ceremonial worship in the
Sabbath gave place to circumcision

And where they urge us, Job that they kept the Sabbath in his time (which was
before the law was given.) It is said that Job had seven sons, and they went
and feasted in their houses every one his day; Jobs children kept the Sabbath.
and then it is subjoyned, Job. 1.6. That there was a day when the sons of
God came to present themselves before the Lord. Pineda in Iobum.
Now who were the sons of God here? but Jobs children who assembled
themselves to worship God upon the seventh day?

They say that these words, God rested the seventh day and sanctified the
Sabbath, are set down (...), The sanctification of the Sabbath was not set
down by way of anticipation.
by way of anticipation; because God promised to sanctify that day afterward:
this carries no probability with it, that God is said sanctify it, because
he was purposed to sanctify it afterward; for then he might be said to
sanctify the mount Moriah when he created it, because afterward he was to
build the temple there, and to sanctify the Pascha and the Pentecost, because
afterward he was to appoint them for holy uses.

The conclusion of this is, we live not by examples, Conclusion.
but by rules, but Gods example was a rule to the Jews, and Christ's example
should be an example to us to keep the Sabbath: God rested from the beginning
upon that day, and the law has first respect to Adams Sabbath, and not to
Moses Sabbath.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of the change of the Sabbath to the first day of the week.
Commandment. IV.
Revelat. 1.10. I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.
CHrist when he rose he changed the Jewish Sabbath into his day, and called it
the Lords day. Christ is set down as an example of imitation to us, Christ
teaches both by word and deed.
and he teaches us two ways, by his doing and by his teaching. Act. 1.1. Of
all that Jesus began both to do and to teach. The Apostles followed him
because he rose that day, and kept that day: therefore they called it his day,
John was ravished in the spirit, The Sabbath is called the Lords day
emphatically.
(...), he sets the article (...) before it, as if he would say, that Lords
day; all days are the Lords days, but this day is emphatically called the
Lords day; because he, as Lord of the Sabbath, changed it: and Beatus Renanus
commenting upon Tertullian observes well, that it was the manner in the
Apostles days, to call things rather the Lords than Christ's, Things called the
Lords rather then Christ's.
as the Lords supper, the Lords table, so the Lords day; because he instituted
all these.

Secondly, Christ has ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Heb.
4.10. Here four things are to be considered. First, God had a rest, and Christ
had a rest; God rested after the creation, and Christ rested after the
redemption; Gods rest upon the Sabbath, and Christ's rest upon his Sabbath
compared together.
God rested when he had made the world, and Christ rested when he made the new
world. 2. Cor. 15.17. Old things are past away, behold all things are become
new. Secondly, God is set for an example to the Jews in the creation, and by
like consequence Christ rested that day from all his labors. So should
Christians rest upon this Sabbath from all their labors. And this example of
Christ binds Christians as forcibly to keep this Sabbath, as the example of
God did bind the Jews to keep their Sabbath.

Thirdly, the Apostle 1. Cor. 16.2. The Apostles kept this first day of the
week.
commanded that upon the first day of the week a collection be made for the
Saints, and he speaks of this day not as a new day, but as a day well known
among the Christians; for this epistle to the Corinthians was written in the
fiftieth and seventh year of Christ, that is, twenty three years after his
death.

The Lord changed the Priesthood from the first borne to the Leviticall
priesthood. So when the people of Israel came out of Egypt, he changed their
account; whereas before they reckoned from Tishri, now he commanded them to
reckon from Nisan, because of the great benefit of their deliverance out of
Egypt: So now he will have the Sabbath to be reckoned from his resurrection,
and not as the Jews reckoned.

Upon this day the Lord created the heaven and the earth; this day the Angels
were created, Many notable things done this day.
this day the Lord gave Manna to the Israelites, this day the Spirit came down
upon the Apostles, and upon this day circumcision was instituted; as
Chrysostom observes; because Christ who rose this day was to circumcise the
heart.

When the Lord changed the Sabbath day,

There are four sorts of changes in religion: First, when the essence and
substance of religion is changed. Four sorts of changes in religion.
Secondly, when the state of religion is changed: Thirdly, when the essence is
changed in part; Fourthly, when the rites in religion are changed. The change
of the essence.


The first change is when the essence of religion is changed, as when a Turk
becomes a Christian, this is as when a man is raised from death to life.

The change of the state of a thing.
The second change is, when the state is changed, as when Christ changed the
Sabbath into the Lords day; this is as when a boy becomes a man.

The change of the esscence in part.
The third change is, when the essence is changed in part, as when one
professes the truth, but in some point he is heretical; he is converted in
this point, here the essence is changed in part; this is, as when a man who is
sick becomes whole.

The change of the rites.
The fourth change is, when the rites are changed, this is like the change of a
man's clothes: the change here of the Sabbath into the Lords day, was but a
change in the state and in the rites, but not in the essence; neither in the
whole nor part.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is; Christ who is Lord of the Sabbath. Mat. 12.8. has
power to change the Sabbath. There are four memorable changes which Christ
made, Four memorable changes which Christ made.
the first is his miraculous change, as when he changed water into wine; the
second was the changing of the ordinances, he changed the ceremonies of the law
into the gospel; and the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the
week; the third is when he changes man from nature to grace; and the fourth
is when he changes men from grace to glory, and in all these he goes from
the more imperfect to the more perfect.

EXERCITAT. X. That works of necessity do not violate or profane the Sabbath.
Commandment IIII.
Mat. 12.11. What man shall there be amongst you that shall have one sheep,
and if it fall into a pit upon the Sabbath day, will not lay hold on it and
lift it out?
ALthough the Lord has discharged servile works to be done upon the Sabbath,
God allows such servile works as belong to his worship to be done upon the
Sabbath.
yet he allows such works to be done upon it which serve for his own
worship. To circumcise was a servile work, yet because it served for his
worship; therefore he allowed it. So the killing of beasts was a servile work,
yet because it served for his worship the Lord approved it.

Secondly, Works of charity may be done upon the Sabbath.
works of charity are the works of the Sabbath, as to cloth the naked and to
feed the hungry, yet all works of charity are not to be done that day,
especially such, quae sola intention operantis ad misericordiam diriguntur.
Example, a man upon the Sabbath builds a bridge, this work he proposes to
himself as a work of charity, yet this is a servile work and may not be done
that day, but in case of great necessity.

Works of necessity may be done that day; there is a double necessity,
inevitable necessity, and contracted necessity: Inevitable necessity is such
that we can no ways eschew it, see it, nor help it; Necessitas Inevitabilis
Contracta.

as when fire upon a sudden comes upon a house on the Sabbath day; this
inevitable necessity breaks not the Sabbath. Inevitable necessity profaneth
not the Sabbath.
The second sort of necessity is a contracted necessity, when men do not
dispose of their affairs all the week long, they draw upon themselves a
necessity to break the Sabbath.

Necessitas Imminens. Prasens.

Again, we must distinguish betwixt danger imminent, and danger present; if
the danger be not imminent, that sort of necessity profaneth the Sabbath.
Example, the weather is like to be stormy, therefore a man may cut down his
corn, or lead it home upon the Sabbath; this sort of necessity breaks the
Sabbath, Present necessity profaneth not the Sabbath.
but if the danger be present, that sort of necessity breaks not the
Sabbath. Example, if a flood should carry away the corn, in that case a man
may go and save the corn, and that necessity does not violate the Sabbath,
and in this case we profane the Sabbath unless we profane it.



Necessitas non habet legem sed sibi legem facit.
secondly, an extreme necessity: if he and his family be only pinched, for
that sort of necessity he must not break the Sabbath; Non licet sumere lucrum
hoc die, nisi mera necessitas cogat, si principaliter ob lucrum fiat tunc est
opu^ servile.
but if his necessity be an extreme necessity, then albeit he work upon the
Sabbath, he profaneth it not; but the Lord allows it.

As works of necessity profane not the Sabbath, so the commandment of the
superior profaneth it not. Extreme necessity profaneth not the Sabbath.
God commanded the Jews to do no servile work upon the Sabbath, yet he
commands them to compass the walls of Jericho seven days; The commandment
of God the superior, breaks not the Sabbath.
here the Jews might safely break the Sabbath at the commandment of their
superior.

The casuists grant too much liberty to the people in doing servile works.
Servile works are forbidden that day, but the Romish Casuists grant too much
liberty to the people in teaching them what are servile works, and what are
not. Example, they say that windemills, and water mills may grind that day,
because they require no great work, nor toil or labor; but they say, if a
man should grind at a man-mill, that were a servile work: So they hold that
fishes coming but once in the year, Vide Azpilaetam de violatione sesiorum.
as hering, that it is lawful for the fishers to fish that day: likewise they
hold that men may make merchandise that day, providing that it be of things on
which a certain price is set down. So they held that works of the mind are
not servile works, and that they may be done on the Sabbath, if they be not
bodily works; as a lawyer may inform his client: so such works as are common
to the master with the servant; as to write, they hold them no servile works.

The Jews were profane violaters of the Sabbath, Seyrus de festis.
as we may see in the days of Esaias, and Jeremy, and so continued on till the
days of Nehemiah; but afterward they fell into another extremity in the days
of the Macchabes, The superstition of the Jews in keeping of the Sabbath.
and then they became superstitious observers of the Sabbath, 1. Macch. 2.36.
They fled into a city upon the Sabbath, neither threw they ston^s at them who
pursued them; but said let us all dye in our innocence; heaven and earth shall
testify for us, They would not fight to de^^^d them upon the Sabbath.
that ye put us to death wrongfully. So they rose up against them upon the
Sabbath, and slew them with their wives and children, to the number of a
thousand people. but Matthias verse 41. made this decree, If it fall out upon
the Sabbath that our enemies invade us, we will defendour selves, that there
may be a people left upon the Sabbath to keep the Sabbath.

Philo in his second book of the life of Moses, says, Sabbatum quietem
adferre, non tantum mancipijs, sed etiam arboribus and stirpibus. Therefore
Matt. 12. and Luc. 6. When the Disciples pulled the ears of corn upon the
Sabbath; they said, that the Disciples did that which was not lawful upon the
Sabbath. They would bury no body upon the Sabbath, therefore the body of Christ
was taken down from the cross before the sun set. The Pharisees extent in
superstitious observing of the Sabbath.
The Lord commanded, Ier. 17. that they should carry no burdens upon the
Sabbath, but the Pharisees extended it thus far, The precept.
The Pharisees extent.
that it was not lawful for the sick man to take up his bed upon the Sabbath.
The precept.
Ioh. 5. They might make no journey upon the Sabbath, The Pharisees extent.
but the Pharisees extended it thus far (as Origin testifies of those who
were called Dosithaei) that they would not stir out of the place where they
sat upon the Sabbath; Cynesius apud Euoptium.
and Cynesius reports of a Jew, who was at the helm of the ship before the
Sabbath, but so soon as the sun set, he left the helm of the ship and cast
himself along in the ship, and read all that night, and the day following upon
the book of the law: and although they threatened him with death, yet he
would not take the helm in his hand to guide the ship again: yet Christ and
his Disciples went through the corn upon the Sabbath.

Works of necessity may be done that day, but the Jews hold, The precept. The
Pharisees extent.
that they might not bury the dead that day; this is a work of piety, and
oftentimes of necessity, therefore it might be performed that day. A physician
may go to visit his patient that day, and the midwife may go to help a woman
in childbirth that day, and a smith may shoe a post-horse that day, providing
that he be about the business that concerns the estate.

The superstitious Jews will suffer their beasts to carry no more upon them
then their haltar or bridle; The Pharisees extent.
they will not saddle their horse that day; whereas the Shunamitish woman
desired one of the asses to be made ready, and a servant to be sent, that she
might go to the man of God; her husband said, Wherefore will thou go to him
to day, it is neither new moon nor Sabbath. 2. King. 4.22.23. It was their
custom to do so on the Sabbath and new moons. In the days of Christ they
would have pulled out their sheep or ox out of a pit upon the Sabbath, Matt.
12.13. The precept.
but afterward they would let the beast lie still until the morrow; The
Pharisees extent.
but if it was a marish place or deep ditch wherein the beast was in present
danger, then they used to hire some poor Christian for a trifle to pull out
the beast for them. They hold that it is not lawful for the blind to lean
upon a staff that day, but for the lame it is lawful: Schichardus de Sabbatho
ex Tal.
because the blind may want the staff, but not the lame. They teach, that if
a man be wounded a day before the Sabbath, and the plaster be laid to his
wound, The Pharisees extent.
he may suffer the plaster that day to lie still at the wound, but if he take
it away, he may not lay to a new plaster that day. The Pharisees extent.
They hold that if a flea bite a man that day, he may take it, but not kill
it; and if a thorn prick him in the foot that day, he may not pull it out.
And last, they hold that a Tailor may not carry a needle, far less a sword.

Men run into extremities in religion, Men oftentimes run into extremities in
religion.
Peter will not have Christ to wash his feet at the first, but then he falls
into the other extremity, Not my feet only but also my hands and my head.
Ioh. 13.9. So here they were profane breakers of the Sabbath, and then they
became superstitious observers of it: but we should keep the golden
mediocritie, and turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. Deuteronomy. 5.32.

The conclusion of this is, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath, and therefore in necessity

Secondly, if we sanctify the Lord in this life, Conclusion.
we shall keep that eternal sabbath with him in the heavens; the
sanctification of the Sabbath in this life is but the first fruits, and the
full harvest shall be in the life to come. When the foundation of the second
temple was laid, all the people shouted for joy, Ezra 3.11. In hope that the
temple should be finished: so if we lay the foundation of the sanctifying of
the Sabbath in this life, we may rejoice, because it shall be finished in the
life to come.

The evening and the morning were the first day, the second day; the third day
etc. but it is not said, that the evening and the morning were the seventh day;
to put us in remembrance that our Sabbath shall be an eternal Sabbath, and
never have an end.

Of the punishment for the breach of the Sabbath.
Those who brake the Sabbath under the law were to be put to death Exodus 21.
Why they were put to death under the law who brake the Sabbath.
and Levit. 24. the reason of this was, because their Sabbath was a pledge to
them of all the benefits which they were to receive in Christ to come. So the
priests daughter was to be burnt quick if she defiled her self by committing
whoredom, the reason was because her father was a type of Christ to come: Why
the Priests daughter was burnt quick.
if a preachers daughter now should commit whoredom, she should not be burnt
quick for it, because her father is not a type now of Christ to come; I grant
she should be more severely punished in respect of her offense, than any other
woman, the breach of the Sabbath now is to be punished with death: but
otherwise at the magistrates arbitrament.

Exodus 21. that he who breaks the Sabbath should be put to death.

They knew not that this which seemed but a small fault to them, should be
punished with death.

SVch a place of pointing we have. 2. Sam. 8.13. The pointing of places is to
be observed.
And Divid got him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the
valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. There was a great distince
betwixt the valley of salt and Syria, therefore the place must be read by the
distinction of the point Tarcha; he got him a name when he returned from Syria.
Here is the distiction, and he slew the eighteen thousand men in the valley of
salt, such pointings as these would be marked.

1. Ioh. 2.16. For all that is in the world, The devil tempts Evah with three
temptations.
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of
the father, but of the world: these were the tentations of the devil to Evah,
Genesis 3. First, The tree was good for food, this was the lust of the flesh: then
it was pleasant to behold, this was the lust of the eyes; and thirdly, ye shall
be like gods, this is the pride of life: and so ye shall see these three in the
temptations which he used to tempt Christ, Matt. 4. first he said, Command that
these stones be made bread, this was the lust of the flesh: secondly, he showed
him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, this was the lust of
the eyes: thirdly, when he would have Christ to cast himself down from the
pinnacle of the Temple, and when he said, That the Lord would give his Angels
charge over him, this was The pride of life.

Page 70. l. 6.

What are we to think of the Teraphim which Micol put in David's bed, was this
an idol or not?

If Jacob purged his house of Teraphim, David then that religious king (who
purged his house of other sins, Psalm. 101.) have suffered an idol in his
house; it was an image made then in the similitude of a man, and she put the
goats hair upon the head of it, that it might resemble the hair of a man: it
was such an image as they carry at burials: the seventy translate it (...).

Page 75. l. 22.

The people at the giving of the Law saw no visible shape.
Deuteronomy. 4.12. And the Lord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And when
the Lord appeared to them, he appeared in a cloud. Psalm. 18.11.

Page 87. l. 8.

The idols have great force to draw idolaters after them. Ier. 8.2. They loved
them, they served them, they walked after them, sought after them, and
worshipped them.

Idolaters are more earnest in the service of their Idols, than the godly in
the service of their God.
Observe the five words set down here to note the earnestness of idolaters to
follow their idols. First, They loved them in their heart. Secondly, They
served them, there was never a slave that served so servilly, as they served
their idols. Thirdly, They walked after them, seeking their responses from
them, and trusting in them. Fourthly, They sought after them from Sihor to
Euphrates. Fifthly, They worshipped them, giving all the glory that was due to
God unto them.

Ye shall not find in all the Scriptures, such an earnest desire to please
God, ye will find in the Scriptures these things spoken severally of the
children of God, and Gods worship; but ye shall not find them joined all
together, as they are here when they are jointly spoken of worshipping Idols.
First, for the love of God, Ye that love the Lord hate evil. Psalm. 97.10. here
is the love of God, but none of the rest. Secondly, the service of God, and the
people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, Iud. 2.7. Thirdly, for walking
after the Lord, as Noah walked with God, Genesis 6.9. Fourthly, to seek him, This
is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face. Psalm. 24.6.
Lastly, to worship him. O come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel
before the Lord our maker.

This idolatry loses all natural bonds; The idolaters break all the bonds
of nature.
against the fifth commandment. They say to the stock thou art my father, and
to the stone thou have begotten me. Ier. 2.27. It makes them not only to
forget their duty toward God, but all their duty toward their parents; They
brea ke the fifth commandment.
and as the superstitious Pharisees if they had vowed any thing, they would
have suffered their parents to sterue, rather than they would have broken their
superstitious vow, Mat. 15.5. So the idolater, rather or he will omit any duty
to his idol, he will suffer his parents to sterue.

Against the sixth commandment; They sin greivously against the sixth.
most cruel and barbarous were they when they sacrificed their children to
Moloch in the valley of Topheth, which the Prophet Jeremiah called the valley
of slaughter. Ier. 7.32. and the Seventy translate it (...): It might justly be
called Aceldama, the field of blood; and see how the Lord justly revenged this
sin upon their idolatrous Kings, he suffered their dead bodies to be taken
out of the graves and hung up before the sun. Ier. 8.2. Because Idolaters
worshipped the Sun, the Lord caused their dead bones to be hang up against the
Sun.
and especially the bones of Menasseh and Ammon who were the chief idolaters,
and were buried together. 2. King. 21.18. They were buried in the garden of
their own house, in the garden of Vzziah; whereas the body of David who was a
true worshipper of the Lord, was safe and untouched. Act. 2.29. His sepulcher
is with us unto this day.

Against the seventh commandment; Against the seventh commandment.
it procures men to be given over to unnatural lust. Romans 1.26.

Against the eight commandment; Against the eight commandment.
they took the Lords wine, and his wool, and his flexe, and gave it to Baal.
Hos. 2.8. He but lent them that corn, and that wine, and they bestowed it
upon the Idol Baal.

Ye were carried away after dumb Idols.

The Moabites worshipped Baal-Peor, and the Israelites worshipped that, Number. 25.3.

The Ammonites worshipped Chemosh. Judge. 11.24. and Moloch, 1. King. 11.33. and
the Israelites worshipped them.

Thirdly, the Sydonians worshipped Ashtaroth. 2. King. 23.14. and the
Israelites worshipped that. 2. King. 11.33.

The Philistims worshipped Dagon, but we read not that they worshipped that God.

The Babylonians god was Bell or Bagnal, they worshipped that.

They worshipped the Egyptians calfe.

They worshipped Adonis. Ezekiel. 8. and the queen of heaven. Ier. 7.18. and
Priapus, 1. King. 15.13. and the host of heaven. 2. King. 25.5. all these they
worshipped. Were they not then carried after dumb Idols?

Page 91. l. 24. A comparison betwixt Israel and Judah in their idolatry, and
which of their idolatry was greatest.

The idolatry of Judah was greater than the idolatry of Israel.
FIrst, Iudahs sin was greater than the sin of Israel, although Israel
sinned continually without interruption, yet Iudahs idolatry was greater when
he fell to it.

Secondly, Judah committed idolatry in the temple of the Lord. Ezekiel. 8. Israel
did not so.

Thirdly, Judah had the true Priests, the true Prophets, and some good Kings,
and the true temple; Israel had none of these.

Fourthly, all the promises of Christ to come were made to Judah and not to
Israel, therefore Judah did justify Samaria in all her sins, the one was
aversatrix, and the other was praevaricatrix.

A comparison betwixt Judah and the idolaters now.

THe Israelites worshipped the golden calfe in Horeb, or in Sinai; but they
brag that they dwell in Sion, and yet worship idols.

Secondly, the Jews worshipped a calfe when Christ dwelt but in the bush,
cloud, and pillar; but they worship idols now when Christ has taken on our
flesh upon him.

They worshipped God in the likeness of an ox; Idolatry now is more dangerous
than the idolatry of Judah or Israel.
but now they worship him in the likeness of a man, more dangerous idolatry;
for man is capable of civil worship which a beast is not, which has some
resemblance with spiritual worship; and as Absalom in the noonetide of the day
lay with his fathers concubines: so do they now in the sunshine of the
gospel, when they might have been cured and would not.

Lastly, Suetonius lib. 6. cap. 22.
they have refined all the shifts and excuses of the heathen, so they justify
all their idolatries; and as Caligula when he brought the image of Jupiter
Olympus, he broke off the head of it, and set on his own image upon it: So
they have broken off the old shifts of idolaters, and brought in their own new
shifts in place of them, and their idolatry is refined idolatry.

Page 93. l. 6. A comparison betwixt the waters of Sihor and the waters of
Euphrates.

THe scriptures expresses idolatry by the term of drinking of water, so
bodily whoredom is expressed this ways, Idolatry compared to the waters of
Sihor.
aquam alienam haurit.

First, let us observe what resemblance is betwixt Nilus and idolatry; no man
can tell directly whence Nilus proceeds, it has so many springs: so no man
can tell directly the beginning of idolatry, it has so many springs.

Secondly, the water of Nilus is black and troubled, therefore it is called
Sihor blacknes: so is idolatry troubled water.

Thirdly, Nilus is unwholesome water for drink, so is idolatry.

Fourthly, Nilus parts it self in seven branches: so did the idolatry of
Egypt part it self in many branches.

Then for Euphrates. Josh. 24.2. Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the
flood in old time, even Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor;
and they served other Gods. So when they were carried to Babylon, when they
sat by the river Euphrates, then they did solicit them to worship their
idols. Psalm. 137.

Judah, because he participated with the Kings of the North, and the South,
therefore he was plagued by them both.
Judah stood betwixt Euphrates and Nilus, he should have participated with
neither of them; but because he did, he was both plagued with the king of the
North, and the king of the South.

Babylon stood upon Euphrates, and Jeremiah commanded Seraiah to bind a stone
to the book and cast it in the midst of Euphrates; And thou shall say, thus
shall Babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon
her. Ier. 51.63. As the Egyptians sunk in the red sea like a stone. Exodus 15.
and Babylon sunk as the stone did sink in Euphrates: So shall spiritual
Babylon be thrown into the sea like a great millstone, and shall be found no
more at all. Revelat. 18.21.

Page 119. l. 2.

I am a jealous God. See how far the Lord submits himself to our
capacity: First, God takes upon him as it were our natural infirmities and
our natural passions for our capacity.
to take our natural infirmities upon him, as hunger. Psalm. 50.1. If I were
hungry I will not tell thee. So to take our passions as our anger, grief,
sadness, fury, wrath, jealousy, and that which seems to come nearer to our
sinful passions, as to be froward. Ps. 18.26. With the froward thou will show
thy self froward. Whatsoever is spoken of God, it is good in it self,
although it exceed and become sinful in us.

Page 150. l. 35. Of Jeremiah and Job cursing the day of their birth.

THese who hold that Jeremiah sinned not in those imprecations and curses
allege first, Some bring reasons to prove that Ieremia sinned not in cursing
the day of his birth.
that Jeremiah before he began to curse, he praised God. Ier. 20.12. Sing unto
the Lord, praise ye the Lord; for he has delivered the soul of the poor from
the hand of evil doers. and then he adds, Cursed be the day wherein I was
borne: this cannot be a sinful cursing, Does the fountain send forth at the
same place sweet water and bitter water. Iam. 3.11. Can out of the mouth
proceed both blessing and cursing?

Secondly, when he uses these curses, God gives him a comfortable answer; as
Cap. 15.10. Woe is me my mother that thou have borne me a man of strife, and a
man of contention to the whole earth. The Lord answers him. Verse. 11. Verily
it shall be well with thy remnant: verily I will cause the enemy to entreat
thee well in the time of evil, and in the time of affliction. God says, It
shall be well with thy remnant, that is, the rest of thy days.

And they that justify Job say, Some say that Job sinned not in cursing the
day of his birth.
that for seven days Job did hold his peace, and then he opened his mouth
and spoke; Cap. 3.1. which phrase the scripture uses, when men speak
deliberately and advisedly. As Act. 10.34. Then Peter opened his mouth and said.

To open the mouth and speak, in the scriptures is to speak deliberately and
with advicement.
Secondly, they say, would Job or Jeremiah curse their mother who bare them?
then that woe should have befallen them which the Prophet Esaias speaks of.
Cap. 45.10. Woe be to him that says to his father, what begettest thou? or to
the woman, what have thou brought forth?

Thirdly, would Jeremiah use a sinful curse against the day of his nativitie,
who was sanctified from his mothers womb? Ier. 1.5.

Fourthly, how could he curse that day which was past?

And where it is objected that we should rejoice in tribulation, Afflictions
are not good in themselves, but as they are sanctified of the Lord.
and that Jeremiah fretted in tribulation. They answer that simply,
tribulations and afflictions are not good in themselves, but they are the wages
of sin; but it is only the Lord that sanctifies them, and turns them to
the good of his children.

And they say, that he cursed not the day it self, but the miseries that
followed that day, as David cursed not the mountains of Gilboa directly; but
the blood shed there, which made the mountains barren; and so it was not the
man who brought the news, whom he cursed, but the miseries themselves, which
befell him after that time; and in effect they say it was but such a complaint
as Paul's was: O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of
death? Romans 7.24. and he said, better is the day of death, then the day of ones
birth. Ecles. 7.1. Pereat dies mortalitatis, ut erumpat dies aeternitatis.

The fathers generally stand to justify him in this, that it was not a sinful
cursing, as Hierome, Theodoret, Clemens Alexandrinus, Gregorius Nissenus,
Cyrillus, Alexandrinus, Origin, Gregorius Magnus.

Jeremy and Job not altogether free from sin in cursing the day of their
nativity.
But Elias was a man subject to the same passions as we are. Iam. 5.17. and so
were Jeremiah and Job; therefore it may seem that they spoke not here without
sin, although the Lord pardoned them.

Page 191. l. 20.

He will not hold him guiltless, that is, he will punish him.

We pray daily that God would pardon us the guilt of our sins, and there is
no guilt that we are more liable unto, than to the guilt of our idle speeches
and swearing.

Now that we may be freed of this guilt, How God punishes the guilt, and how
he pardons it.
we must consider first, how God punishes this guilt; secondly, how he
pardons this guilt: he punishes the guilt when he imputes the sin to
the offender, he pardons the guilt when he transferreth it upon another.

When he transferreth it upon another, the sin remains, but the guilt is
taken away; and some call this concupiscence which remains, materiale in
peccato, What the material and what the formal part in sin.
but that which is taken away is formale, as the land-marke cast out of the
land, it cease to be a land-marke any more, but it cease not to be a stone:
and some say the guilt is taken from the person, although not from the sin it
self.

How can the sin be transferred upon an innocent person to make him undergo
the punishment,

The innocent person because he gives his word for the guilty, Psalm. 119.122.
Sponde pro servo tuo, be surety for thy servant. So Heb. 7.22. Christ is
punished for us, because he gave his word for us.
Jesus made a surety of a better Testament, therefore he is punished for us.

And that we may take up this the better, mark how a Judge proceeds either
according to the rigor of the law, or the mitigation of the law, or contrary
to the law, or above the law. According to the rigor of the law, when he
imputes the guilt to all; contrary to the law, if he should impute the guilt
to none; How a Judge proceeds in executing justice.
according to the mittigation of the law when he speareth some, but this is
above the law, that his Son Jesus Christ should undergo the punishment for us,
this comes of the clemency of the high Judge.

David according to the law executed Ioab, contrary to the law killed Vrijah,
according to the mittigation of the law confined Shemi, whereas he might have
caused him to be executed; and Solomon out of his clemency he spared Adonijah.

All that was in Christ's condemnation was in our absolution.
Jesus Christ the just, in whose mouth was found no guile, who was a perfect man
in word, for our cause was condemned for blasphemy, to absolve us from the
guilt of that sin; for whatsoever was in Christ's condemnation, is in our
absolution.

the sign of the three Golden Lions in Cornehill, near the Royal Exchange.
1632.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, WILLIAM VISCOUNT OF STERLINE, LORD ALEXANDER of
Tullibody, principal Secretary for the Kingdom of Scotland, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council of both the Kingdoms.
Right Honorable,
SOLOMON the wisest King, writ three several books, and in those three several
books he takes three several Epithetes and Styles unto himself: in the
Proverbes he calls himself Solomon the son of David, King of Jsrael; In
Ecclesiastes, he calls himself the Preacher, son of David, King of
Jerusalem; And in the Canticles, he calls himself Solomon only. In the
first book he gives directions to all men, and as a King he speaks to all;
in his second book, he as a Preacher speaks to Jerusalem below here, he
speaks not to all here as King of Jsrael; In his third book, he speaks
only to the Church above. So the Lord when he gives his Laws, he gives
some Laws to all, as King of the Nations, and some Laws he gives to the
Jews, his peculiar people, and the Gospel he gives as to the Church above;
the law which he gave to all Nations, was the law of Nature manifested to Adam
before the fall, and this Law was repeated again to Noah in seven Preceps, as
not to commit Idolatry, Fornication, to abstain from things strangled, Act.
15.20. Levit. 17.10.
and from blood; those Laws were moral Precepts, I will set my face against
him that eats blood, this is not the ceremonial part of the Law, but in
detestation of cruelty it is forbidden to take a member from a living creature,
and to eat the blood while the life is in it; but to eat things strangled, or
cold blood, was but the ceremonial part; thirdly, the Lord renewed this same
Law again upon Mount Sinai, to all Nations, but he added to it his judicial,
and ceremonial Laws, as peculiar to his people the Jews, and in this respect
it is called their Law, Ioh. 8.17.
is it not written in your Law, because this Law was directed to them after a
special manner, and therefore they are called his people, he came to his
own, Ioh. 1.11.
and his own knew him not. These ceremonial Laws did not bind other people,
as they did the Jews; therefore when Jonah came and preached to the Ninevites,
he spoke nothing to them of the ceremonies of the Law; so when Daniel spoke to
Nebuchadnezzar, he spoke nothing of the ceremonial Law. So when Elisha spoke
to Naaman the Syrian, he spoke not a word of this Law to him. So when the
Prophets spoke to Tyrus, Sydon, and to the Nations round about, they spoke
nothing of those ceremonies to them, these belonged only to the Jews, they are
forbidden to eat things strangled, or a beast that dyed of it self, but yet
the Gentiles might eat of such. Deuteronomy. 24.2^.
And here we may mark a difference betwixt circumcision and the rest of the
ceremonies of the Law, for many that were not of the Church of the Jews used
circumcision, as Herodotus Strabo, and Epiphanius testify, for circumcision
was given to Abraham and his posterity, not only to Abraham's posterity who
lived within the Church, but to those also who came of Jsmael, Esau, Keturah,
etc. and howsoever those did circumcise rather by imitation, than for
conscience, yet it was a law given to all Abraham's posterity; but the rest of
the ceremonies did no ways bind them; but the moral part of this Law binds
them all. It was a great mercy of God, that when man had fallen from him, that
he gives him a Law again, Hos. 11.6.
and does not suffer him to wander as a Lamb in a large pasture, and like an
untamed Heifer which knows not the Yoke, and that one should not devour
another, Habak. 1.15.
as the Fishes of the Sea, but gives him a Law to hedge him in, and keep him
within the bounds. Man has a threefold life, his spiritual life, his natural
life, and his civil life; the Lord in his Law had regard to all these sorts of
lives; first, his spiritual life, which is called the life of God, Ephesians. 4.18.
and he takes order with this in the first Table; Secondly, his natural
life, that he be not killed, nor his blood shed; and thirdly, for his civil
life, that he may have the means to live comfortably, Marc. 5.26.
which is called a man's life, in the Scripture. Other Laws of Men are but
concerning circumstances, and they are but the application of this Law, to this
or that particular people, and they stand not unmovable, as this Law of God
does, but upon occasions they may be altered and changed; therefore the
Persians that made their Laws which could not be changed, incroached too far
upon the LORD and his privileges, and all other Laws are to be rectified by
this Law, and the farther that they go from this, they are the more imperfect;
Men set the Dyall by the Sun, and their Watch by the Dyall, The Dyall comes
nearer to the Sun than the Watch; so when men reduce their Laws to this Law,
then they set the Dyall to the Sun, but when they rectify their Laws by any
other Law, they set but their Watch to their Dyall. Many have written already
upon those Commandments, to whom we are much beholden, and the Hebrews
Proverb is true of them, nisi ipsi elevassent lapidem non inventa fuisset sub
eo haec Margarita, but yet there is something left to be cleared, and as there
was oil enough so long as there were Vessels in the Widows house; So there
shall be matter enough for all those who are to entreat of this Subject: and
my intention especially is here to clear these things out of the phrase of the
Original Tongues, and the customs of the people of God, and although there be
things handled already by others set down here, yet when ye find these
things, count them not as vrticam inter myrtos, but as myrta inter myrtos, for
both come from him, who is the Author of Truth.

It may please your Lordship to accept of these my Travels, as a signification
of the honorable respect I carry to your Lordship, whose virtue and learning
has brought you to this eminent place. Laertius writes of one Crates, that
bestowed his gifts very foolishly; for he gave to his Flatterer ten Talents,
to his Whore a Talent, to his Cook ten Mnas, to his Physician a Drachme, to
his Philosopher three half pennies, to his Counselor fumum, smoke; foolish
men value the basest things at the highest rate, and the highest things at the
basest rate; But I know, my Lord, that you weigh things in the balance of the
Sanctuary, and think more of those heavenly things, than of those base and
sinful pleasures, which the world are so much taken up with; The grace of God
be with your Lordship, and keep and preserve you for ever.

Your Lordships in all Christian duties, John Weemes.

AN EXPLICATION OF THE MORAL LAW The second Book, containing sundry
Questions for the understanding of the second table of the Moral Law.
Commandment V.
EXERCITAT. I. How the second table is like unto the first.
Mat. 22.39. The second is like unto the first, Thou shall love thy neighbor
as thy self.
THe Lord has reduced all his Commandments to ten, as to (...), an instrument
of ten strings to play upon; he reduced them to two, which the Hebrews call
calolim gadolim, (...) Vniversalia magna.
universalia magna, and the two poles upon which the Commandments are turned;
and at last he reduced them to one, Romans 13.10.

The first and the second table are said to be one, they are not one
simplicitate indivisibili, Vnum Simplicitate indivisibili. Vnitate
subordinationis.

as the soul is one; but they are one unitate subordinationis, as the husband
and the wife are one.

Duties of the first table help the performance of the duties of the second.
The second is like unto the first. The duties of the first table help the
performance of the duties of the second; and therefore ye shall see that the
fear of God, a duty of the first table, is added many times with the duties of
the second table, for By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil, Prove.
16.6. And Nehemiah blaming cruelty in the Jews toward their brethren, said,
Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God. Neh. 5.9.

The duties of the second table have respect to the duties of the first.
So the duties of the second table always have respect to the duties of the
first. 1. Cor. 10.31. Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye
do, do all to the glory of God. Therefore the Divines say, that the
Commandments of the second table must be practiced in and with the
Commandments of the first table, and the Hebrews express this after their
manner, Qui amatur infra, amatur supra; and so he that loves his neighbor
below will love God above.

He who breaks one Commandment brea^eth them all.
Secondly, the first and second are like, because he that breaks one breaks
all. Iam. 2.10. For there is such an harmony amongst the Commandments, that
one is not broken without the breach of another; for He who says, do not
commit adultery, said also do not kill. Iam. 2.11. And by the transgression of
any of these Commandments, the authority of the Lawgiver is contemned, whose
authority should move us to keep his Commandments. In every sin there is
aversio a Deo, quod est formale in omni peccato; it is the turning from God,
which is the formal part of all sin; and every sin fails against charity
which is the sum of the law; therefore he who breaks one, breaks all.



This follows not, All sins turn men from God, yet not all alike.
for although all sins turn men from God, and make them guilty of eternal
death: yet all sins turn not men from God alike, neither make they men
guilty alike of eternal damnation.

Although he that breaks one breaks all, yet there is a nearer breach
betwixt some commandments then betwixt others. Gregory illustrateth the matter
by a fit comparison; as those who tune the strings of an instrument, do it so
cunningly, that when they touch one string, yet they touch not the string that
is nearest to it, but that which is upon the same concord and note; Simile.
and although they touch not the rest of the strings, yet they all tremble, but
that which is upon the same note gives the sound: so we commit no sin but
we break all the Commandments, and make them all to tremble, Greater affinity
betwixt some Commandment than others.
as it were: but yet there is a nearer breach betwixt some of the Commandments
then others, to wit, those who stand upon the same note. And as in the camp
the soldiers who make war, although they serve in the whole camp, yet they
are bound especially to serve under some standard, Simile.
and there are special bonds betwixt them and their own company: So although
there be an affinity amonst all sins, yet there is a greater affinity
betwixt some sins then others, Greater affinity betwixt some sins then
others.
as those which serve (as it were) under one standard. Example, Prove. 30. Give
me not poverty, lest I steal and take the name of God in vain; there is a
greater affinity betwixt the eighth Commandment, and the third, then betwixt
the eighth and the fourth; for men when they steal, care little to take the
name of God in vain to hide their theft. So, Give me not too much lest I be
full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? Satiety of plenty, and worldly
means, and contempt of God, go usually together, the breach of the eighth and
the first Commandment. So gluttony and idolatry, Deuteronomy 13.20. So fornication
and adultery, as we see in the Israelites, committing fornication with the
daughters of Moab, they fell to worship Idols also. Number. 25.1. So fornication
and profaneness, Some sin are a breach of all the Commandments and cannot
be referred to one.
as Esau was a fornicator and profane person, Heb. 12.16. and there are some
sins which are not to be referred as a breach of any one Commandment, but are
a breach of all the Commandments; as, drunkenesse; it is a sin which
breaks all the Commandments, because it depriveth man of reason, which is
the chiefest faculty in the soul, and in which obedience to God is wrought
first, and the performance of all duties to our neighbors. If then there were
not a great affinity amongst the Commandments, one sin could not break all
the Commandments.

Seeing he who breaks one breaks all, then let us remember that saying of
David, Psalm. 119.6. I shall not be ashamed when I have respect to all thy
Commandments. So verse. 128. Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning
all things to be right, that is, he approves all the Commandments of the
Lord in all things: The Hebrews when they will have all things observed,
repeat the word Col to signify that nothing is to be omitted. (...) Et
praecipuum omnium primitiarum ex omnibus, and omnis oblationis omnium ex
omnibus oblationibus vestris Sacerdotum est.
not as some men do, who like of one Commandment and reject another. And the
Hebrews double the word Col when they will have all things observed, as Ezekiel.
44.30. Vereshith col biccure col vecol terumath col miccol terumothechem
lecohanim ijhjeh, that is, And the first of all the first fruits of all things,
and every oblation of all of every sort shall be the Priests. And the Jews
say, Merces praecepti est praeceptum, vel praeceptum trahit praeceptum, that
is, he that studieth to keep one of the Commandments, the Lord gives him
grace and inableth him to walk in the rest. And they say, Merces peccati
peccatum est, and delictum trahit delictum.

Our obedience should be copulative, therefore the Commandments are set down
with a copulative conjunction, Thou shall not commit adultery, and thou shall
not steal etc. Why the Commandments in the Hebrewe are otherwise
distinguished then any other part of the Scripture.
And as they are distinguished by a full point; so they are lightly
distinguished by a comma; which kind of distinction, is not found elsewhere in
the old testament, and they are thus distinguished to show their coherence and
connection.

The second is like unto the first, The second table of the law is like the
first in quality.
they are like in quality but not in equality, and we must always remember to
make an equal comparison in degrees when we compare them, the greatest of the
first, with the greatest of the second; then the breaches of the first will be
greater then the breaches of the second: but if we make not an equal
comparison, then the breaches of some of the second table is greater then some
of the first: as the Lord says, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, Matt.
9.13. God does not prefer here the duties of the second table to the moral
worship of the first table simply, Comparing the greatest with the greatest,
and the least with the least, the duties of the first table are to be preferred
to the second.
for spiritual duties are more excellent then corporal duties, as the spirit
is more excellent then the body; if a man be like to sterve for hunger, then it
is better to feed him then to teach him, but simply it is better to teach him
than to feed him: if we compare the lesser duties of the first table with the
greater of the second table, then we must prefer the second to the first;
therefore Ahimelech the Priest gave David the show bread, and the sword of
Goliath in his necessity, because he judged it better to arm the Magistrate in
his necessity then to observe the ceremony.

Seeing the Lord will have mercy and not sacrifice, Eleazer chose rather to
dye, then eat swines flesh, 2. Maccab. 6.19.

If he had eaten swines flesh at that time, Why Eleazer refused to eat swines
flesh.
it had been to him the renouncing of the whole moral law; and therefore he
chose rather to die.

Whether is it a greater sin to be perjured,

Whether perjury or murder be a greater sin.
If we make an equal comparison, then perjury will be found a greater sin
then murder; but if a man through fear perjure himself, and with a high hand
kill his neighbor, then murder is a greater sin then perjury; but comparing
the greatest with the greatest, and the least with the least, then perjury is a
greater sin then murder.





Who are our neighbors.
Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. Christ shows who are our
neighbors, Luc. 10. He is the best neighbor who loves best: some contract
this word neighbor very near, for vicinus, or their door neighbor, The
Pharisees took this word neighbor for their friends.
proximus mihi ratione loci, and proximus meus ratione affectionis; others take
neighbor only for their friends, and wellwillers, and hence the Pharisees
gathered, that they might hate their enemies: but the Apostle Romans 13.3.
extends it to all men calling our neighbor (...) any man whosoever if he be
our flesh, Esaias 41. or our blood, Act. 17. When Moses saw two Israelites strive
together, Neighbor sometimes is taken for our dearest friend, and sometime for
our adversary.
he said, ye are brethren why should ye strive, Evod. 2.13. So Let every man
borrow of his neighbor, Exodus 11.2. The Egyptians were neither neighbors nor
friends to the Israelites in their judgment.

Thy neighbor, sometimes it signifies a special friend, as Deuteronomy. 13.6. Thy
neighbor which is as thine own soul. So Job. 2.11. but sometimes it is taken
for an adversary: as Prove. He that is first in his own cause seems just,
but his neighbor comes and searches him. Prove. 18.17.

A man is bound to love his enemy, A man should love his enemies.
this is a principle ingraft in nature, Natura primo quaerit conservationem
speciei sua, as if a dog be hounded at a heard of swine, Nature seeks the
preservation of it self.
they will run all together to defend themselves; so if two men were going to
fight together, a lion in the mean time comes to devour one of them, both of
them set themselves against the lion; the first instinct here is to seek the
preservation of their kind, and the second is to seek the preservation of
themselves.

There are two sorts of love, Amor Naturalis. Supernaturalis.

the first is natural and humane, the second is divine and supernatural.

This natural love again is twofold, the first is amor concupiscentiae and
the second is amor amicita, sensual love, and love of friendship: Amor
Concupiscentia. Amicitia.

amor concupiscentiae is this, when we love our neighbor for our own profit
and commodity only, as Laban loved Jacob, only for his own commodity; the
second is the love of friendship when we love our neighbor chiefly for his
own good. Spiritual love what.
Spiritual and supernatural love is this, when we love our neighbor for
Gods cause; for although the object of our love be our neighbor, yet the
reason why we love him is God.

As thy self, the measure of this love is, to love our neighbor as our self:
The measure of our love to our neighbor.
a man is bound as far as he can to imitate God: but in God idem est amans
and amatum, and he loves himself most; therefore a man is bound chiefly to
love himself, quisque sibi proximus est, and in amore similitudo eminenter
includitur, every man is nearest to himself, and in love the similitude is
included after the most eminent form and excellent manner.

A man must know first to love himself; diligere se ut se, that is not good
love: secondly, A man loves himself three ways.
diligere se ut principalem finem, that is not right love: thirdly, diligere se
in ordine ad Deum, that is to love himself truly.

A good man only loves himself.
A good man can only love himself; for this is only true love which
respects the most excellent part, the mind, and he studieth most to
beautify it with graces, and to make the sensual appetite subject to reason;
it is he that agrees best with himself; it is he who has greatest joy
within himself; and nunquam minus est solus quam cum solus: the wicked man
again cannot love himself, because he studieth not for the right gifts of the
mind to beautify the soul; A wicked man cannot love himself and why.
he labors only for things which hurt a man more then they do him good;
that which his reason bids him do, his sensual appetite draws him from
it, and when he is merry in his sensual appetite, then his reasonable faculty
is sad, Prove. 14.13. Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful, and the end of
that mirth is heaviness. Therefore he desires not to be alone, but seeks
for the company of voluptuous libertines to spend the time with them, and as he
who has a scold for his wife at home, is glad to seek abroad for company to
make him merry: so the wicked man finding no peace of conscience at home within
himself, but great jarres, is glad to seek abroad for mirth to drive away his
melancholious fits; Seneca said well, Omnis stultitia laborat fastidio sui, all
sort of foolishness is wearisomnesse to it self. The sensual man loves not
his own life and health, but rather hates it by his intemperate diet,
hastening his own death; this is corrupt self-love, and not that true love
which God placed in man from the beginning, A wicked man hates his own life,
therefore cannot love his brother.
it is now turned into that (...) when a man pleases and flattereth himself,
and this tends to his destruction.

The rule to love others, must be to love our selves: The Schoolmen make three
sorts of measures, the first is mensura excellentiae: Mensura Excellentiae.
Reduplicationis. Aequalitatis.

the second is mensura reduplicationis: and the third is mensura aequalitatis.

Mensura equalitatis, the measure of equality is that measure when the measure
and the thing measured are just equal, as time and things below here, The
measure of equality what.
they began with time and shall end with time.

Secondly, there is mensura reduplicationis, The measure of reduplication what.
the measure of reduplication, as when we lay a yard to a web of cloth, we
measure the cloth by often applying the self same yard.

Thirdly, The measure of excellency what.
mensura excellentiae the measure of excellency is that which excels all
other measures in excellency, and the nearer that any thing draws to it, the
more excellent it is: as gold is the measure of excellency amongst the
metals, and silver draws nearest to gold in excellency. So justice is the
measure of excelency to all virtues; and in this sense, God is the measure of
excellency to all things. Now what sort of measure is man to his neighbor,
when he measures his neighbor by himself? he is not mensura excellentiae,
for that belongs only to God, The love of a man's self is the measure of
equality to the love of his neighbor.
he is not mensura reduplicationis, but he is properly mensura aequalitatis.
Those who falsify their measures are abominable before the Lord, when they
have a short measure and a long: the Pharisees measure and yard reached no
farther but to their well-willers and kinsmen, the Politicians reaches only to
his country; but a Christian man's measure reaches to any man, (...). Romans
13.3.

Whether is a man bound more to wish riches to himself, or to his neighbor?

If thou be rich, and thy neighbor poor, When a man is to wish more riches to
himself than to his neighbor. Quest.


What if thou and thy neighbor be of equal estate and condition, what art
thou to do then?

If it be bonum honestum, to thy neighbor, providing that honesty may arise to
thee by wishing that to him; we have an example of this in Abraham and the
king of Sodom. Genesis 14. When Abraham left the goods to the king of Sodom, and
wished only the lives of men; it could not be objected to Abraham that he was
seeking any thing for his own profit; this tended to his credit.





Two motives which make us to love our neighbor.
There are two motives which make us to love our neighbor, the first is
grounded in nature, and the second in grace; But how much more unto thee, both
in the flesh and in the Lord. Philem. 16. and the nearer that they draw to
those two fountains, Where there is most grace, there we should love most.
the more we are to love them. Example, Bethshebe Salomons mother had four
sons. 1. Chron. 3. yet she loved Solomon more then all the rest, How Solomon
is said to be his mothers only son.
because she saw him draw nearest to the Lord in grace; therefore he says, I
was the only son of my mother, that is, I was her best beloved son. Prove.
4.3.

Example 2. Christ had more cousen-germans then John; as Joseph, James, yet John
was his best beloved Disciple; because he had more eminent graces than the rest.
Where there is an equality in the flesh, where thou see most grace, Simile.
love them best. A center out of which issue many lines, the farther that they
are extended from the center, they are the more disunited amongst themselves;
and the nearer that they approach to the center, the more they are united
amongst themselves: So the nearer that our friends draw to God, and resemble
him, How we should love them that are alike in grace.
the more we should love them; and the farther that they are removed from God,
the less we should love them: but when men are alike in grace, we should love
them best who are nearest to us in nature. Romans 15.11. Salute Herodian my
kinsman: There were many as near in grace to Paul as Herodian was, yet because
Herodian was his kinsman, this moved him to love him.

Whether did Christ love them best who were nearest to him in the flesh and in
the Lord?

As man, Whether Christ loved them best who were his kinsmen.
he loved them only best who were nearest to him in the Lord: when they told
him that his brethren and kinsmen stood without; he said, Who are my brethren
and my kinsmen? Those who do the will of my father which is in heaven, the
same is my brother, and sister, and mother. Mat. 12.50. he respected only
those who drew nearest to him in the Lord. When Judas place was void, two stood
for it, Matthias and Joseph. Act. 1.23. Joseph was our Lords kinsman, and was
surnamed the just; Why the lot fell upon Matthias, and not upon Joseph Christ's
kinsman.
yet the lot fell upon Matthias, to teach us, that Christ in his spiritual
kingdom has not this respect to flesh and blood; hence we may see the folly
of those who think that Christ is commanded by his mother now: but these
obligations cease in the life to come.

We are bound by degrees to love our neighbors, We must love our neighbors
by degrees.
the parents are more bound to love their children, then the children their
parents. 2. Cor. 12.14. For children ought not to lay up for the parents, but
the parents for the children: and we say, that one father will provide better
for nine children, than nine children will provide for one father.

What if a man's father and his son be cast in prison for debt, which of the
debts is he bound to pay first?

He is bound no doubt to pay the old debt first, Whether a man is bound to
relieve his father or his son first.
but ordinarily we are to provide for our children rather then for our parents,
but in great necessity we are more bound to our parents.

The order of loving amongst brethren and sisters.
Brethren and sisters are to love others better then strangers; the brothers to
love the sisters, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot. Genesis
34.31. Sisters are to love their sisters more then their brethren, because of
the near similitude: therefore Exodus 26.17. when the curtains are joined
together, for their similitude they are said to be joined quaelibet ad sororem
suam, every one to her sister.

Brothers are to love other best.
So brothers are to love brethren most, they are begotten of the same parents,
they are bred up together in the same house, and they resemble others more then
sisters do; and therefore they are to love others better: frater is called
fere alter, almost another, and one eye is not so like another, as on brother
should be like another: God has made many things two in the body, as two
ears, two feet, two hands: one eye picketh not out another, when one leg
stumbleth the other helps it, A friend loves at all times, and a brother is
borne for adversity. Prove. 17.17. Wherefore he that casts away his brother
and makes choice of another, is like unto him who cutting away his natural
leg takes to him a leg of wood; the first style which the primitive Church
took, they were called brethren. Heb. 13.1. 1. Cor. 7.12. and Christ calls
himself the brother of his spouse. The love of brethren turns oftentimes to
hatred.
Cant. 8.1. but the greatest love amongst brethren turns often times to
hatred. Prove. 18.19. A brother offended is harder to win then a strong city,
and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. The first blood that
ever watered the ground was the blood of Abel, shed by his brother Cain. Genesis
4. There is a curse pronounced against Edom: Amos. 1.11. Because he did pursue
his brethren with the sword, and cast off all pity: in the Hebrew it is,
(...) and crumpit miserationis suas.
because he did corrupt his compassions. The Prophet Obadiah describes
unnatural friends: Verse. 7. First, those that were viri foederis, that seemed
to be in league with Edom, should deceive him; viri pacis, that is, who made a
show to live peaceably with him; Viri Faderis. Pacis. Panis. Vteri.

thirdly, viri panis, that is, those who eat familiarly with him, yet they
shall thrust the Edomites out of their land; if it was unnatural for those who
were but viri foederis, pacis and panis, how much more for those who are viri
faderis, panis, pacis, sanguinis and uteri, men that are in covenant, men that
are at peace, men who live and break bread together, men who are one blood,
yea that are bred in one womb, what great sin it is for them to hate one
another.

In the family again, we are to love those who are borne at home more then
those who are borne abroad. Levit. 18.9. those are said to be borne at home,
who are begotten of one father, Who are said to be borne at home, and who
abroad.
those are said to be borne abroad, who are borne of one mother, but not
begotten of one father. The children who are mothers children raised not up
seed to their eldest brother, because familia matris non vocatur familia. (...)
from (...) frater, semen and (...).
Those who are begotten of one father the Greeks call them (...), those who are
borne of one mother they called them (...) uterini.

But those who are fathers children and mothers children, we are to love them
best. Genesis 45.22. Fathers children and mothers children are to love others
most; Joseph gave to all of his brethren each man changes of raiment, but to
Benjamin he gave five changes of raiment: why did he give five changes of
raiment to Benjamin? because he was his brother both by father and mother, and
the holy ghost exaggerateth the wrong done to such a brother. Psalm. 50.20. Thou
sit and speak against thy brother, thou slanderest thine own mothers
son.

Lastly, A man is bound to love his wife better then father or children.
in the family a man is bound to leave father and mother and cleave unto his
wife, and he is bound to love her better then ten sons, and so should the
wife love the husband. 1. Sam. 1.9.

As thy self. Some hold that this is not the measure of love under the
gospel, to love our neighbor as our selves; There is but one measure of our
love to our neighbor under the law and under the gospel.
but we should love him under the gospel as Christ loved us: but this cannot
stand that there should be one measure of love under the law, and another
under the gospel; for the gospel abolisheth not the law, and there is one
rule for all.

If this should be the rule, to love our neighbor as our self under the
gospel, then some should have done works of supererogation, as Paul who loved
the Jews better then himself.

He did nothing here but that which the law required of him, therefore he could
not supererogate, for neither the law nor the gospel requires of any man to
love another man's salvation better then his own.

But we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 1. Ioh. 3.16. And the
good sheepherd gives his life for his sheep. John 10.



we should love one another as Christ loved us. Ioh. 13.34.

As is not a note of equality here.
and Christ says, a new commandment I give you, that ye may love one
another. Ioh. 13.33. It is called a new commandment, because it is more fully
expressed, to love our neighbor as Christ loved us: then to love our neighbor
as our self, is not a new commandment in substance, but new in form; and new
is put here for more excellent, Novum sumitur pro excellenti sapissime.
as Mat. 9.17. new wine: So Revelat. 5.9. A new song, that is, excellent wine,
an excellent song.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
we are not bound neither affectu nor effectu, to love all our neighbors
alike.

EXERCITAT. II. Of the duties of the wife to the husband. Commandment. V.
Ephesians. 5.22. Wives submit your selves unto your husbands as unto the Lord.
THere are sundry combinations in the which the inferiors are bound to give
honor to their superiors: First in the family, and next in the polity.
Sundry combinations in the family.
In the family, first, betwixt the wife and the husband. The man is bound to
honor his wife.
The wife is bound to honor her husband, and the man is bound to honor his
wife. 1. Pet. 3.7. because this is the gentlest sort of commandment, therefore
he is bound to honor her, as she is bound to honor him.

The second combination is betwixt the children and the parents, and the third
combination in the family is betwixt the master and the servant; and because
every thing is best seen in the smallest partitions, therefore we will unfold
this in the family first.

The duties of the wife to the husband, are subjection, Three duties of the
wife to the husband.
obedience, and reverence.

First, The woman should be subject to the man by order of creation.
the woman owes subjection to the man by the order of creation: The woman was
made for the man, and not man for the woman. 1. Cor. 11.8. and as the Sabbath
was made for the man, and not the man for the Sabbath. Mark. 2.23. therefore he
is Lord of the Sabbath. So the woman was made for the man: therefore he is
Lord over the woman.

Miriam prius nominatur quia peccati author fuit.
So they two shall be one flesh; it is (...) in the masculine gender, and not
(...) in the feminine, because the man is the more excellent sex; but when the
woman is chief in the transgression, then the woman is put first, Obloquutae
sunt Miriam and Aaron, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses. Number. 12.1.

Secondly, as the order of creation proves this, so does the fall prove it:
The woman was first in the transgression and not the man. 1. Tim. 2.14. The
woman was last in good, The woman fell first therefore ought to be subject.
and created but for the man: First, in evil, last, in good; therefore she is
justly subject to the man.

Thirdly, the Apostles order proves this subjection. 1. Cor. 7.1. God is
Christ's head, Christ is the man's head, and the man is the woman's head; if ye
will respect order in policy, the man is the image of God above the woman, and
he is more the glory of God then the woman: if the woman will not subject her
self to her husband, but usurp sovereignty over him, as she seeks
sovereignty over her husband, so if she could, she would pull Christ out of
his place, and God out of his place.

The veil a token of subjection.
Fourthly, the veil that was put upon the woman's head on the day of her
marriage, testifies her subjection to her husband: therefore she is said to
have power upon her head, 1. Cor. 10.10. The woman ought to have power over her
head, that is, a veil, which was a sign of her subjection and of her husbands
power over her. Number. 2. When the husband was jealous of his wife, she stood
bareheaded all the time before the Priest, as not being under her husbands
subjection until she was cleared of that suspicion.

Genesis 20.16. And unto Sara he said, Behold I have given thy brother a thousand
pieces of silver: behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that
are with thee, and with all other; that is, The veil a token of subjection to
her husband.
I have given thy husband money to buy thee a veil to cover thy face, that all
may know with whom thou do converse, that thou art a man's wife, and so they
shall not commit adultery with thee, taking thee to be an unmarried woman. The
bill of divorce why called the bill of diminution. (...) Attenuari.
The woman was subject to her husband; the bill of divorce, Matt. 5.31. is
called in the Syriack Libellus diminutionis, and she was diminuto capite, when
she wanted her husband; the man is the glory of the woman, and when she wants
her husband she wants her glory.

Lastly, The woman called after her husbands name. (...) Vir. (...) Faemina.
(...)
the woman in token of her subjection when she was married, she changed her
name and wa^ called after her husband: to impose a name was a sign of
authority: Adam was called Ish, and Eva was called Issha, and Salomons spouse
is called Shulamite, Cant. 6.13. and the Romans said Quando ego ero Catus tu
eris Caia, Esaias. 4.1. Only let us be called after thy name.

This subjection of the wife to the husband, differs far from servile
subjection, The subjection of the wife to the husband is not servile subjection.
for he that is servily subject, works for another: but the wife works not
for another, but for her self, for she and her husband are one. This
subjection of the woman to the man in the beginning was a more free and willing
subjection then since the fall, Genesis 3. Et ad maritum tuum erit appetitus tuus;
the seventy translate it (...), conversio tua, thy turning shall be to him: the
same phrase is used to express the subjection of the younger brother to the
elder, Appetitus illius erga te, and thou shall rule over him, Genesis 4. He shall
be subject unto thee, because thou art his elder brother: so the woman should
be subject to the man, because she was created after him, and for him, and she
is the weaker vessel. When the husbands desire is said to be toward his wife,
The desire of the husband toward the wife is love, but her desire to the
husband is both subjection and love.
then it signifies love, Can. 7.10. I am my beloveds, and his desire is
toward me, that is, he loves me most entirely; but the woman's desire toward
the man, implies both love and subjection.

If the woman had not sinned, her appetite had not been toward her husband.
If the man had not fallen, the Lord would not have given out this that her
appetite should have been toward her husband, The law is not made for a
righteous man, 1. Tim. 1.9. After the fall ye shall see that man and woman
carried the punishment of their sin: In natural things, the woman brings
forth her children with pain, and the man eats his bread in the sweat of his
brows. Since the fall man and woman carry the punishment of their sins in
natural, moral, and spiritual things.
Secondly, in moral duties there is some reluctation, and the woman is more
hardly subject to her husband, then before. But in spiritual duties and
subjection to God there is greatest rebellion of all, Romans 7.23. I find
another law in my members rebelling against the law of my mind.

The second duty of the wife to the husband is obedience, (...) Faemin e
trihuent honorem maritis.
All the wives shall give honor to their husbands, Esth. 1.20. Hannashim
ijttenu jekar, the verb here is put in the masculine gender, Nomina masculina
juncta foeminis.
although he be speaking of women, to signify their voluntary subjection and
obedience: for it is the manner of the Hebrews when they speak in the praise
of women, they put them in the masculine gender, Ruth. 1.8. So 1. Sam. 25.27.
Prove. 31.13. Esaias 34.14. Eccles. 12.4. these the Greeks call (...), (...).
F^rtem virum me praesto hic de foeminis dicitur.
when women behave themselves like men, Esth. 1.22. Asshuerus made a law, That
every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published
in the language of every people, in the original it is, Loquetur lingua populi
sui, Loqui lingua populi sui apud Persas quid.
to speak the language of their own people, and it seems to be a
proverbiall speech, that is, to keep their wives in subjection, as the
Persians did.

Whether did Vashti refuse lawfully or not to come to the king at the feast?

Some answer that she justly refused, Macrobius says, Macrob. lib. 7. Saturnal.
that it was only given to concubines and harlots, to come publicly in the
sight of men at their feasts, and public meetings. But for answer to this,
Whether Vasti did justly refuse to come at the commandment of the king.
some of the Persian laws were altogether unlawful: Cambyses asked of his
counselors, whether there was any such law amongst the Persians that the king
might marry his own sister? they answered, not: but there was another law,
that the kings of Persia might do what they would: this law is altogether
unjust: so this law, Many of the Persian laws unlawful.
that the laws of the Medes and Persians could not be revoked, was not just;
for all positive laws of men upon better considerations may be altered; this is
proper here only to the law of God not to be altered. And they had some laws
which proceeded only of jealousy, as this: Vasti should have given obedience
to the king.
now this law being a law so defective it did not bind, whereas the King
himself commanded her to come, and here his wife was not to interpret the
statute, but to give simple obedience to her husband.

The third thing which the wife owes to the husband is reverence; (...)
Dominus, Vir.
Bagnal is called both lord and husband: So Sara honored Abraham and called
him Lord. 1. Pet. 3.6. So the wise calls her husband Isshi, my man, Hosea. 2.
as the name of greatest familiarity and love, But the harlot says, Prove. 7.19.
[ish,] the man is gone abroad, and not [isshi,] my man: and the Lord after he
disclaimed the word bagnal, yet he would be called ish, Hos. 2.16. Contrary to
this is, when wives count basely of their husbands, Job. 19.17. My breath is
strange to my wife.

EXERCITAT. III. Of the husbands duty to the wife. Commandment. V.
1. Pet. 3.7. Husbands give honor to your wives as to the weaker vessels.
THe husbands duty is expressed in the creation thus, How the husbands duty to
his wife is expressed.
They two shall be one flesh: the man and the woman that were two, are made
one; they are unum principium generationis, therefore the man should love his
wife and not hate her, because she is his own flesh.

Things said to be one four ways.
They are made one flesh. Sundry ways things are made one, there is unum
natural, as the soul and the body make one man naturally: unum artificiale,
as stones and timber make the house: Vnum mystice, as Christ and his Church;
and this union in marriage is partly moral, and partly natural.

Secondly, the husbands duty to the wife is expressed in the creation, thus; He
shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, Genesis 2.24. When
the woman went out of her fathers house to her husbands, she was said (...) as
Acsaph when she went from her father Caleb. Josh. 15.18. this was called (...),
her going out, but when she came in into the house of Othniel her husband, this
was called (...), her going in to her husband; and Isaac brought Rebeccha into
his mother Sarahs tent, Genesis 24.67. to signify that he would have her in place
of a mother, and that he would leave father and mother for her.

The second part of the husbands duty is to cleave to his wife, which Christ
expounds Matt. 19.5. (...), to be glued to his wife: (...) agglutinor,
glutinamentis adjungor, metaphorice adhaeresco, a (...) gluten.
the Lord to express his love to his Church, compares her to a girdle
cleaving to his loins, Ier. 13.11. As the girdle cleaves to the loins of a
man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel, and the whole
house of Judah, says the Lord; Now he says, he made her to cleave to him as
a girdle to his loins, but the seventy translate it, He glued her to his
loins, and why was she glued to his loins? Amor est in cord tanquam in
sede, and in renibus tanquam instrumento.
because the reins which are the seat of love, are in the loins: My reins
do teach me in the night season, Psalm. 16.7. Therefore he carried his Church
girded about his loins: he that would honor his wife should be glued to her
in affection: a thing that is glued, will break sooner in any part then where
it is glued.

The man when he is married, To spread the lap of the garment, and to
overshadow the woman, signify protection and love.
is said to spread the lap of his garment over his wife: Ruth. 3.9. Spread thy
skirt over thine handmaid. And the holy Ghost alluding to this, in more
comeliness and decency is said to overshadow the virgin Mary, Luc. 1.35.
Allusion.
The power of the highest shall overshadow thee.

Moses more particularly sets down those things which the husband owes to
his wife, Exodus 21.10. The husband owes five things to his wife.
First he owes her meat; secondly clothing; thirdly cohabitation, the fourth
thing which the husband owes to his wife, is Debitum tempus, and the fifth
thing which he owes to her, is honor.

The first thing that he owes to his wife is meat, She eat of his morsels, and
drank of his cup, 2. Sam. 12.3. Exodus 21:10. If he take another he shall not
diminish her food; in the original it is Sheerah, flesh; for the Hebrews put
flesh for all things necessary for the maintenance of our life, as well as they
do bread, Psalm. 78.10. (...) caro eius. Flesh put for all necessary food,
Can he prepare flesh for his people in the wilderness? Targum paraphraseth
it, alimentum ejus; and the seventy translate it (...), things necessary for
them.

(...) Indumentum.
The second thing is indumentum, kesuth, the virtuous woman cloatheth her
busband that he may be known in the gates of the city: and the Hebrews say,
that the good woman cloatheth her servants, and the good husband cloatheth his
wife, and God cloatheth all; the wife is said to cloth her husband, when she
prepares that which he brings in to her.

(...)
The third thing which he owes to his wife is cohabitation (Tabhoth eleah) the
seventy translate it (...) viri cohabitantes; the Polygamists could not
perform this duty to their wives to dwell with them. The kings of Persia had
many wives, and when the king made choice of them, before they came unto him,
they stayed in a chamber called (...), the virgins chamber: and after they were
married, they stayed in a chamber called (...), the wives chamber; this was
contrary to this cohabitation that a man is bound to dwell with his wife.

The fourth thing which the husband owes to his wife is debitum tempus
[gnonathah] which comes from gnanah, (...) Debitum tempus a (...) respondere.
respondere, the seventy translate it (...), vel consuetudinem, and the Apostle
calls it due benevolence. 1. Cor. 7.3.

The fifth thing which the husband owes to his wife is Cabhod, (...) Honor.
honor, when they were married he said, Esto mihi in uxorem secundum legem
Mosis and Israel, and ego secundum verbum Dei, colam te, honorabo te, alam te,
and regam te, The properties of the head.
juxta morem eorum qui colunt, honorant, alunt, and regunt uxores suos
fideliter.

The husband is the wives head; the head excels the rest of the members: 1.
Eminentia, it is more eminent; 2. Perfectione, in perfection; 3. Influentia, it
gives influence; 4. Conformitate cum caeteris membris, in conformity betwixt
it and the rest of the members.

First it excels the rest of the body eminentia, although it be superior to
the rest of the body, yet it must not (...) or (...), that is, (...)
carry a lordly dominion over them, but only Mashal, gently to command her.

Secondly, The man should excel the wife in gifts.
the head excels the rest of the members in perfection: so should the man
excel the woman in gifts; although the man excel the woman in gifts, yet he
should not despise her, thinking her no fit match for him: An apologue of the
Sun and the Moon.
the Hebrews have an apologue fit for this purpose, The Sun said upon a time
that the Moon could not be a fit match for him, for he gives light and heat
to all things, and in the body he rules the heart, and in the metals, the
gold; and for time he rules both the day and the year. But the Moon replied,
If ye rule the year, I rule the month; if ye rule the day, I rule the night;
if ye rule the heart, I rule the brain; and if ye rule the gold, I rule the
silver; wherefore there is no such inequality but that I may match with you.
Many men have a high conceit of themselves that they are like the cedar of
Lebanon, and women but like the thistle of Lebanon 2. King: 14.9.

Thirdly, the head gives influence to the body, A man should teach and rule
his wife.
so should a man teach and rule his wife. In that vision of Joseph, the Moon
and the stars fell down before him, the Sun was his father, the Moon his
mother, and the stars his brethren: and as the Sun gives light to the
Moon and Stars, so should the husband to the wife.

The last thing is conformity betwixt the head and the rest of the members;
There should be a conformity betwixt the man and the wife.
this conformity should make a man to cherish his wife, She slept in his
bosom, 2. Sam. 12.3. Those things which are most dear unto us, we keep them
in our bosom. Esaias 40.11. and John leaned in Christ's bosom, and the reason is
subjoyned, because he loved him best, John 13.23. Mothers keep their young
ones in their bosoms, and if it were possible they would take them into their
very bowels again, Portatur in sinu infans, recumbit in sinu dilectus, and
cubat in sinu uxor.

EXERCITAT. IV. Of the duties of children to their parents. Commandment V.
Exodus 20. Honor thy father and thy mother. Levit. 19.3. Ye shall fear every
man his mother and his father.
CReated goodness has some similitude with that eternal goodness which is
in God; Gods attributes are his power, his wisdom and his goodness; and they
who have these by participation them we are bound to honor, whether they
participate with him in his power, wisdom or goodness: in his power, as our
parents circa esse natural, who are the instruments of our being, and beget
us: and then circa esse spirituale, as pastors who beget us in Jesus Christ,
and make us resemble the Lord. 1. Cor. 4.15. And thirdly, quoad esse temporale,
the similitude of Gods goodness appears more in princes preserving and
protecting us, all these we are bound to honor and reverence.

Duties of children to their parents.
The children owe to their parents three things, reverence, obedience, and
gratitude:

Why the mother is put before the father.
First they owe reverence; for honor, the father is set before the mother; and
for fear, the mother is set before the father, Levit. 19.3. to teach us that
we should honor and fear, as well our mother as our father. Moses says, He
who curses his father and his mother, let him die the death. Levit. 20.9. but
Marc. 7.10. He who curses his father or his mother: and Prove. 15.20. (...)
maledixit. (...) vilipendit. (...) honoravit.
A foolish man despises his mother. Exodus 21.17. He who curses his father or
his mother: but Deuteronomy. 27.16. He who sets light by his parents: Calal and
Calah. Calal est maledicere, and Calah est vilipendere, opposite to Cabhad
honorare. Prove. 30.28. What is that, to set light by them? who think little
thing of them, and give not all due respects unto them, and help them not in
their necessity; then they are said to set light by their parents: what is this
fear (say the Hebrews) which is required of children toward their parents?
First, What fear is required of children to their parents.
that they sit not in their place, Prove. 30.28. Her children rise up and call
her blessed. Nec destruunt verba eorum, that is, they carpe not at their words:
and they say farther, that children are not to call their parents neither
living nor dead by their proper names, but to call their father sir. Example,
Mat. 21.30. I go sir, and to call them mother. As 1. King. 2.20. And Solomon
said, ask on my mother, and to entertain this due reverence and respect in
their hearts, Children may not testify against their parents in judgment.
they were not to look upon their fathers nakedness. Genesis 9. And lastly they
might not testify against their parents in judgment, although they were
guilty, except only in matters of idolatry and treason. Example, Deuteronomy. 33.9.
Of Levi, who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him,
neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children; for they
have observed thy word and kept thy covenant. They preferred the glory of God
to the honor of their earthly parents, and spared them not when they committed
idolatry. So in the case of treason, the child is bound to testify against his
father to discover the treason, but after the treason is committed, he is not
bound to testify, or give any evidence against his father.

The children called their father Abbi, and their mother Immi; (...)
My father and my mother. Esaias. 8.4. Servants amongst the Hebrews might not
call their masters Abba, nor their mistress Immi, but when their masters adopted
them, then they might call him Abh, and the Apostle alludeth to this form.
Allusion.
Romans 8.15. Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye
have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba father. And the
Apostle of purpose keeps the Syriack word Abba, and translateth it not, that
he may show the allusion more clearly. Children owe obedience to their parents.


The second thing which children owe to their parents is obedience; the
Rechabites are a notable example of obedience to their father Ionadab, The
Rhechabites, an example of obedience.
their father commanded them that they should not dwell in houses, nor sow
fields, nor plant vineyards, nor drink wine. Ier. 35.6. this was but a humane
precept, as ye may see by the opposition made betwixt it and Gods commandment,
and yet they kept it for three hundred years; Ionadab lived in the days of
Iehu, and his sons in the days of Iehoiachim, and yet they thought they were
bound to obey their fathers commandment, which obedience the Lord rewarded.
Ier. 35.18. and he takes an example from them to convict the Jews who would
not obey the Lord. (...).
Children must not be (...), unruly, (...) absque iugo
or untamed, like beasts which know not the yoke, these are the sons of
Belial, without a yoke; these the poets call intacta cervice, that is, that
have not felt the yoke, (...).
contrary to these are obedient, (...), folij obedientiae. 1. Pet. 1.14.

The special part of Childrens obedience toward their parents, is to be
directed by them in their marriage. So Sampson sought the consent of his parents
to his marriage. Judge. 14.2.

Whether is the consent of parents necessary for children to be had in their
marriage or not?

There is a two fold necessity, a natural necessity, Necesiitas Naturalis.
Moralis.
Whether the consent of the parents be necessary in the marriage of their
children.
a moral necessity is that, without the which the marriage cannot be well
done; when Esau married the daughters of Heth. Genesis 27.46. He had not the
consent of his parents, it was a marriage, but a bad marriage.

There is one exception, if the mother be a common harlot, then the child ought
the less reverence to her. Hos. 2.2. Plead with your mother, plead: for she
is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and Verse. 4. Her children be the
children of whoredoms.

The third thing which children owe to their parents is maintenance: we have a
notable example of this, Children should give maintenance to their parents.
Genesis 47.12. And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren, in the original
it is, he nourished him as mothers do their little children by putting meat
into their mouth, Lepi Hataph, (...)
so Christ had a care to leave his mother to John to be entertained. John
19.27. There are two beasts set down in the scripture, who teach the parents
the duty toward their children, and children their duty toward their
parents; the first is the Wolf, the second is the Lion; the Wolf teaches
parents to provide for their children, when he hunteth for his prey in the
morning he divides it among his young ones in the evening: So parents should
provide for their children, and give every one their portions: Benjamin is
compared to this Wolf, Genesis 49. Secondly, the Lion teaches children to
provide for their parents, and to maintain them; the young Lion when he
hunteth for his prey and catches it, he roareth and calls the old Lion to
the prey, who is not able of himself to hunt or catch the prey, and Amos
alludeth to this. Cap. 3.4. Will the Lion roar unless he have catched his
prey: and so the foul which teaches children to provide for their parents,
(...).
is the Storke, she is called Storke from (...) natural affection, because
she provideth for the old, and she is called (...), hence comes (...), (...).
when the children study to requite their parents; and in the Hebrew she is
called Hhasidah, benignitas. 1. Tim. 5.4. If a widow have children let them
learn to requite their parents, in the Syriack it is, rependere faenus
parentibus. A man divides his goods in three part; First, so much he spends
upon himself his wife and family; Secondly, so much he gives to the poor;
Thirdly, so much he lends to his children looking for interest back again;
and the Hebrews say, that children should give to their parents meat, drink,
and clothes, and that they should lead them in and lead them out; and they
add fatrher that they should honor the Lord with their substance if they have
any, but they are to honor their parents whether they have substance or not;
if they have not, they are to beg for their parents; but with this condition,
The children are bound to bury their parents honestly.
the child is bound to maintain his father in his old age, if his father had
brought him up in some lawful calling when he was young, whereby he might
gain his living, otherwise if he had no care of his education, he was not
bound to perform this duty to his parents.

So the child is bound to bury his father. Luc. 9.59. Hence comes that word
amongst the Latins parentare, to do the last duty to their parents in
burying them decently, and parentalia the duty it self.

The superstitious and avaritious Jews taught that children were not bound to
relieve their fathers necessity, if they had made a vow. Mat. 23. they band
their vows by an oath, that such and such a man should have no profit by them;
and the oath was by the gift, and so they were instructed, that if any man
swore by the altar, it was nothing; The Jews taught their children not to
help their parents if they had vowed the contrary.
but if he swore by the gift which was upon the altar, then he was a debtor;
when he said, by this gift thou shall have no profit by me, then in no case
they might help their parents.

Amongst the Hebrews (as the Talmud says) there was [Muddir,] devovens, and
[Muddar,] devotum, Talmud. tractatu de votis. (...) devovens. (...) votum.
that which they call Muddar was of two sorts, the first was Muddar Hanaah, the
second was Muddar Ahohhel; the first they called votum nihili, the second they
called votum comestionis; when they made the first sort of vow, (...) votum
nihili. (...) votum come stienis,
they might give them nothing nor help them at all; when they made the second
sort of vow, they might lend them any thing that pertained not to the dressing
of meat, as clothes, jewels, or rings, but they might lend them nothing to
dress their meat with, as pannes, pots, or such, when they taught their
children here Mat. 23. to vow such vows, there votum was votum nihili, that
is, they might lend them nothing, nor help them; By the gift if ye have any
profit by me, they meant, they should have no profit by them, and they
understood the curse to light upon them, if they helped them.

EXERCITAT. V. Of the Parents duty to their children. Commandment V.
Deuteronomy. 6.7. Thou shall teach them diligently to thy children, etc.
PArents duty toward their children is, first, to instruct them as soon as
they are capable, Thou shall teach these words diligently to thy children:
(...) exacues ea filiis.
Veshinnantem Lebhanecha, thou shall sharpen the instructions to thy children,
as one would sharpen the point of a stake when he drives it into the ground.
Abraham's example is to be marked. Genesis 14.14. He armed all his trained
servants, but in the original it is, (...) armati vel (...).
[Hhanichau] his chatechized servants; not only trained in the discipline of
war, but also catechized in the principles of religion. (...) Catechismus
So Genesis 12.5. Abraham took all the souls which he had gotten in Haran, the
Chaldee Paraphrast paraphraseth it this ways, omnes animas quas subjecerat
legi, all the souls whom he had brought up in the law: and the Hebrews say,
that Abraham taught the men, and Sarai the women. Genesis 33.17. And Jacob
journeyed to Succoth and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle,
therefore the name of that place is called Succoth. The Chaldees call Jacob,
ministrum eruditionis, a teacher or instructor; but why call they him so? they
allude by an anticipation ad (...). Exodus 33.7. because the tabernacle was the
place where the Lord taught his people; and the Chaldees translate it, (...)
domus doctrine.
Beth Olphana, the house of learning. This tabernacle was a type both of the
temple, and synagogue, therefore they say, that Jacob taught his family in
this tabernacle. Philo vertit, (...), the house or court of the Lord. So Exodus
31.8. Thou shall show it to thy son in that day; and this was called nox
annuntiationis, when the father taught his son what every thing meant in the
Paschall Lamb, when they enquired what means this bread? what mean these
sower herbs? etc. And the Apostle alludeth to this, annunciate donec venerit,
show the Lords death until he come again. 1. Cor. 11.26. So Prove. 4.1.
Hearken ye children to the instructions of a father, and attend to knowledge
and understanding; I was my fathers son, tender and only beloved in the
sight of my mother, he taught meal so and said unto me, let thy heart retain
my words. Who taught me? my father David; for the word in the original is in
the masculine gender Vajoreni, and he adds, Let my words stay thine heart,
(...) Simile.
or uphold thine heart the words are borrowed from husband men, ut agricolae
stirpibus pedimenta apponunt, as the husband men put stays to the trees which
they plant: So the precepts of the fathers stay and uphold the children.
Bethsheba used likewise to instruct her son, Prove. 30. The mothers used to
instruct the children.
Which chapter is set down by way of alphabet, that Solomon her child might
learn her precepts with his A. B. C. And because the fathers taught their
children first, therefore this name father, was given to teachers and Doctors.
The name father is given to teachers.
Judge. 18.19. That thou may be a father and a Priest to us. So 2. Sam. 2.6.

The parents must instruct their children according to their capacity. Prove.
22.6. Hhanoch lanagnar gnal pi, (...) instrue vel initiare puerum ad os.
teach the child according to their capacity, even as we feed children with
such meat as they are able to digest, there should be set down to them (...) a
plain form of doctrine. Romans 2.20. Children should be taught according to
their capacity.
and the rule of Esaias would be followed here. Esaias. 28.10. Add line unto
line, here a little, and there a little; for as a builder stretche^h forth his
line, Simile.
and then builds a little; and then he stretches forth his line again, and
then he builds a little: so should children piece and piece be taught.

The manner how the Jews taught their children.
The manner of the Jews in instructing of their children was this, when their
sons were five years old they set them [Lemikkra] to the text of the law;
(...)
and when they were ten years old, they set them [Lemishna] to the text of the
Talmud, and when he is thirteen years old then he is [Bar mitzvath] filius
praecepti, and jugo legis subijcitur, then he is subject to the law as to
keep the Pascha, and the Sabbath, and the rest of the ceremonies; and when he
is fifteen year old, they set him [Legemara] to the explication of the text
in the Talmud. (...)
So when children are five or six years old, the parents are bound to teach
them the first principles of religion plainly; and when they are ten years
old, to teach them to read the history of the Bible; and when they are
thirteen years old, Children should be taught by degrees.
to fit them for the Sacrament; and when they are fifteen year old, to cause
them to read the harder places of the scripture, and so by degrees from the
less to the more, to train them up in religion. When a Gentill is turned to
Iudaisme, first, they ask him this question, What makes thee desire to be
circumcised? The Jews propound questions to the Gentiles that embrace their
religion.
do thou not know that the Jews of all people are the most hated? and if
he answer and say, I know, then they propound to him some of the lighter
precepts of the law of Moses, which they call [Mitzvath calloth] precepta
levia, (...) praecepta levia.
as Levit. 19.9. When thou reapest thy harvest, thou shall not reap the
corners of thy field. So that law, Ye shall not kill the dame sitting upon her
young ones. Deuteronomy. 22.6. Then they came ad [Mitzvath camureth] precepta gravia,
(...) praecepta gravia.
and they tell them more concerning the punishments and transgression of the
law, and they say, before this time thou might have safely eaten the fat, or
the blood, or broken the Sabbath; but now when thou art entered within the
covenant, if thou eat the fat, or the blood, then thou deservest to be cut off
from the people of God, and if thou break the Sabbath, to be stoned to death.
And thou must know moreover, that there is a time to come, and that all good is
not rewarded in this life, nor all evil punished here; and thus by degrees
they initiate their proselytes, as is set down at large in their Talmud.

But many men do initiate and offer their children to the devil: They who
offered their children to Moloch, The manner how they used their children who
offered them to Moloch.
first they carried them round about the fire, and these were called (...), and
it was called (...). Secondly, They caused their children to pass through the
fire, 2. King. 17.17. and this was called lustratio. And thirdly, they put them
in the belly of Moloch and burnt them quick. Many parents offer their children
and initiate them in the devils service.
So many parents first initiate their children to the devil when they correct
them not; this is to make them run about the fire. Secondly, when by their
evil example they teach them villainy, even as the young lion learneth from the
old lion to catch the prey, Ezekiel. 19.6. thus they make them pass through the
fire. (...).
Thirdly they not only teach them evil by their evil example, but they
applaud them and allow them in their wickedness, Romans 1.32. then they put them
into the arms of the devil.

There is a great necessity of this duty that parents instruct their children;
The necessity of correcting children.
for by nature we are borne blind and ignorant, therefore parents should take
pains to bring their children to knowledge. The bears when they bring forth
their young ones they are an evil favored lump, and a mass without shape;
Simile.
but by continual licking of them, they bring them to some shape and form: By
good education children are brought to some good fashion.
so thy child who is by nature the child of wrath, by continual instruction
and good education may be brought to some good form and fashion, that he may
see and understand the principles of religion. And as the midwifes when the
child is borne, Simile.
sets the joints of the child right, (...) Cur dicu^tur infantes palmarum
apud Hebraeos.
and swadleth him that he be not vacius (therefore they are called gnolole
tippuchim, Lament. 2.20. Infantes palmarum, not because they are but a span in
length, but because the midwife, when they are newborn, sets their joints
with her hands, that they may be the more straight afterward) so should the
parents teach their children when they are young, Mori in pueritia quid.
and frame their minds aright: It is a great judgment Quando moritur anima in
adolescentia, Morietur in pueritia anima ipsorum, id est, in stoliditate and
insipientia.
as Job speaks, cap. 36.14. They dye in their youth, that is, in their
foolishness, then the sins of their youth lie down in the dust with them.

The Lord accounts highly of this, when the parents begin to teach their
children in their tender years, children are the seed-corne of the Church and
commonwealth, and if they be corrupted in the family, what hope is there of
them when they come to the Church, and policy: the physician says, that
vitium primae concoctionis non corrigitur in secunda, the faults of the first
digestion are not helped in the second: so errors committed in youth for lack
of education, can hardly be helped in old age.

Adam the father of this life, and Christ the father of the life to come.
When the Prophet Esaias speaks of Christ, he calls him Pater futuri saeculi,
the everlasting father, cap. 9.6. Adam was the father of all the children of
this life, and Christ the second Adam is the father of the life to come: when
they beget their children, they beget them only for this life; but when they
instruct them, they may be called Patres futuri saeculi, fathers of the life to
come.

When children are young they are fittest to be taught.
The youngest years are the fittest years to teach children, Prove. 20.11. A
child is known by his doings whether his works be clean and right, the boys
that mocked Elias were devoured by the bears 2. King 2.24. and the Hebrews
say that there are skuls of all sises in Golgotha: the tree which the Lord made
choice of Ier. 1.11. was the almond tree; why made he choice of the almond
tree? because it blossometh first: so the Lord made choice of Jeremiah from his
infancy; (...).
the Lord likes children when they begin to flourish in their young years,
the Lord likes not of these autumnales arbores Iud. 13. which begin to bud
about the latter end of harvest; the Church says omnes fructus servavi tibi
tam veteres quam novos, Can. 7.13. it is a happy thing when both the first and
the latter fruits are reserved for the Lord.

Crates the Philosopher said that he would go up to the highest place of the
city, Many have a care to gather riches for their children, but no care to
train them up well.
and cry in the audience of of all the people: O men whither go ye? why take
ye such pains to scrape riches together for your children, and have no care
to train them up who should enjoy them? And Plutarch said, Simile.
he would add but this one word, that such men as these are very like to them
who are very careful for the shoe, but have no care for the foot.

Lastly, Parents should make choice of good masters to their children.
as parents should have a care to teach their children, so should they make
choice of good masters to instruct them; Pharaohs daughter caused Moses to be
brought up in all the sciences of Egypt, Act. 7. Iehoash had Iehoiada for his
master, 2. King 12.2. And we se what care Theodosius had to make choice of
good masters for his sons, Arcadius and Honorius. Nicephorus lib. 3. c. 23.
And what care had Constantine of a tutor to his son Crispus. Amongst the
causes of Iulians apostasy, the history shows us, that this was one; that
he had two heathenish masters, who taught him, Libanius and Iamblichus, from
whom he drank in great profaneness.

EXERCITAT. V. That parents should correct their children. Commandment IV.
Prove. 22.15. Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of
correction shall drive it far from him.
AS parents ought to instruct their children, so they are bound to correct
them: Simile.
and as it is not enough to plant a vine, unless we prune it and dress it:
so it is not enough to beget children, but we must also teach them and correct
them. The best example that parents can set before them how to correct their
children, is the example of God himself; God the best pattern for correction.
God corrects all his children, and he corrects them in love, he is angry
with them when he does correct them, but he does not hate them; and his
corrections are with moderation.

The Lord corrects in love. (...) Virga filij mei.
First he corrects his children, this rod he calls [shebhat beni] the rod
of my son, Ezekiel. 2.10. for as the father has a rod which he keeps for his
children to make them stand in fear of him: so has the Lord a rod for his
Church; and as a father chasteneth his son, so does the Lord thy God chasten
thee, Deuteronomy. 8.5. The Lord chasteneth every son whom he loves, Heb. 12.7. It
is otherwise in the Church then it was amongst the Romans; The Romans might not
whip a free man, but it is not so in the Church.
for none who was free borne might be whipped among the Romans, Act. 22.25. But
the Lord thinks them but bastards whom he does not correct, Heb. 12.8. in
the Church, He corrects every child whom he loves; so should fathers
esteem those children but bastards whom they correct not. They send out their
little ones like a flock, and their children dance, Job 21.21. this shows
the little care they had to bring up their children, but suffered them to
wander at their pleasure; and never corrected them.

Secondly the Lord corrects his children in love; God corrects his children
in love.
he is angry with their sins, but loves their persons: he is not like
doting fathers who think that every blemish in their children is a virtue, he
can both love them and be angry at their sin; fond parents are lukewarm at
the offenses of their children: it is said of David, 1. King. 1.6. That he
never displeased Adonijah at any time; Elies fault in not correcting his
children.
and of Eli, 1. Sam. 3.13. When his sons made themselves vile, he restrained
them not: in the original it is, (...)
licet maledictionem inferrent sibi liberi, non corrugavit tamen in eos
frontem, although they brought a curse upon them selves, or cursed themselves,
yet he never frowned upon them: there is a twofold curse, as there is a twofold
blessing, a verbal curse and a real curse, they really cursed themselves by
their lewd lives, and in the mean time, Eli non corrugavit frontem in eos, he
did not so much as frown upon them for their sins, Brutus executes his own
sons.
but said unto them, Why do ye such things my sons? Bernard said well, Quia
ira Eli tepuit in filios, ira Dei exarsit in illum. Brutus, when his sons
played the traitors he executed them with his own hands, being Consul;
therefore the history said of him, Exuit patrem ut indueret consulem: so should
a Christian father lay aside fond compassion, and as a Christian, correct his
child: he that will not beat a child with his rod at the commandment of God,
will never take a knife to cut his throat, as Abraham would have done at the
commandment of the Lord.

Thirdly, God moderateth his correction.
when God corrects his children he moderateth his correction; when he
punishes the wicked, he punishes them in wrath, Nah. 1.9. Non surget bis
afflictio, that is, the wicked shall totally and finally be consumed at once;
So Esaias 30.32. And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass; The
Lords rod of correction passes over his children, Gods rod passes over his
children, but it lies upon the wicked.
and lies not long upon them; but is a grounded staff upon the wicked, and
overthrows them.

When God corrects his children, In the midst of his anger he remembers
mercy, Hab. 3.2. and Lament. 2.4. He stood with his right hand as an
adversary: God is but like an adversary, he is not an adversary. When the Epha
was carried to Shinar, Zach. 5.8, 9. it was carried by women having the wings
of a storke: why carried they it upon the wings of a storke? because the storke
is called chasidah, benignity; to teach them, that in the midst of his anger
he remembers mercy. (...) benignitas.
2. Sam. 7.11. I will correct him with rods of men, but in the original it is
more significative, (...) virga senum, vel hominum debilium.
Beshebhat anashim, with the rods of old or weak men; for even as a silly
feeble old man lays on but a weak blow: so does the Lord correct his
children but with a faint blow: The rods of men what.
and he corrects them with the stripes of men, that is, which men are able
to bear. Ier. 46.28. Castigabo te in Iudicio, and non evacuabo te, I will
correct thee in measure, yet not utterly cut thee off; or, I will not leave the
wholly unpunished. So parents when they correct their children, Parents in
correcting their children should moderate their corrections.
in the midst of their anger they should remember mercy; A bridle for the ass,
a whip for the horse, and a rod for the fools back, Prove. 26.3. Scourge not
thy son upon the back like the fool, there should be neither liver, tumor,
nor sanguis, blewnesse of the wound, swelling, nor blood, except the offense be
very great, Prove. 20.30. it should not be virga furoris, or virga exactoris,
Esaias 9.4. and 10.5. as those who were the taskmasters of Egypt, whipped the
poor Israelites with many stripes; the fathers rod should not be (...), (...)
ab (...) infuria.
contumeliosa verberatio.

God corected his children in measure, Psalm. 78.50. jephalles natibh leappo,
He weighs a path for his wrath; (...) Libravit semitam irae suae.
in correcting he does all things In pondere, numero and mensura, in weight,
number, and measure; there is a threefold measure, the first is mensura
mensurans, the second is mensura mensurata, and the third is quantitas
mensurae, as pondus. In that vision of Zachariah, cap. 8.9. ye may see all
these three, first mensura mensurans, Threefold measure.
the sins of the Jews was the Epha, the punishment was mensura mensurata,
which was measured, and the weight of their iniquity was the talent of lead.

This correction should be with instruction, and therefore the Hebrews mark
that musar is called both instruction and correction; (...) Disciplina.
Castigatio.

and correctio is called disciplina pacis. Musar shelomenu, The chastisements
of our peace was upon him, Esaias 53.5. that is, (...) Disciplina pacis.
the chastisements which brought our peace; and so when we are chastised, It
brings forth the quiet fruit of righteousness, Heb. 12. this is the
comfortable fruit of correction.

EXERCITAT. VII. Of the provision for the eldest son. Commandment. V.
Deuteronomy. 21.17. He shall acknowledge the first borne by giving him a double
portion of all that he has.
THe parents are bound to provide for the children, Four sorts of children in
Israel.
but especially for the first borne; a child in Israel was sometimes (...), but
not (...), and sometimes he was (...), but not (...), and sometimes he was
(...), and (...); and sometimes he was (...), and (...).

He was (...) who opened the womb first; Jacob had more wives, the son
which he begot first was his (...), but the son which Zilpah bare first was
her (...), but not his (...); he who was (...) was dedicated to the Lord, but
he who was (...), only got the double portion, but if he were (...) and
(...), then most justly the double portion of all that his father had belonged
unto him. Christ was (...) borne of the virgin Mary, and he was (...) the
first borne amongst many brethren; and thirdly he was (...) the only begotten
son of his father, and therefore the inheritance justly belongs unto him.

The man's first borne got the double portion.
The man's first borne in Israel got the double portion of his fathers goods but
not of his mothers, for they were equally divided amongst the rest, and he got
the whole inheritance. Ruben for committing incest lost the dignity of the
priesthood. Secondly, of the princely government. And thirdly, the double
portion. Judah got the dignity, Levi got the Priesthood, and Joseph got the
double portion. 1. Chron. 5.1.

Why the eldest got the double portion.
There were three reasons why the eldest got the double portion in Israel: first
a natural reason, because he was his fathers strength, The eldest was his
fathers strength.
Deuteronomy. 21.17. So Psalm. 78.51. He smote all the first borne in Egypt, the
chief of their strength, in the tabernacle of Ham. So Psalm. 105.36.

He kept the tribes distinguished.
Secondly, there was a politic reason to keep the family in its own dignity,
and the tribes distinguished.

He was a type of Christ.
Thirdly, a ceremonial reason, because he was a type of Christ, who was first
borne amongst many brethren.

Allusion.
The eldest son was begotten in his fathers strength, hence is that allusion,
Job. 18.13. Primogenitus mortis, that is, a strong death, and Esaias. 14.13.
Primogeniti pauperum, id est, pauperrimi, very poor; so the first borne was
the most honorable: Allusion.
hence is that allusion. Heb. 12.23. Ye are come to the Church of the first
borne. The first borne got the double portion, therefore Christ the first borne
among many brethren was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows.
Psalm. 45.7.

This double portion which was given to the eldest was called Pi shenaijm. 1.
Sam. 1.5. and 1. King. 2.29. (...)
and the Chaldee paraphrast calls it Teren Hhullakin, duplam portionem, and
the Seventy call it (...) that is, a worthy or a double portion, and Cajetan
calls it a portion which serves for two mouths.

If a man had three sons in Israel, his goods were divided in four parts,
and the eldest got two parts; How the goods were divided amongst the children.
Allusion.
if he had two sons, his goods were divided in three parts, and the eldest
got two, and Elisha alludeth to this form when he said, I pray thee, How
Elisha required the double portion of the spirit.
let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. 2. King. 2.9. because he was
the eldest scholar in Elias school, therefore he desires a double portion;
he desired not to have twice so many gifts as his master Elias had; as if
Elias had eight, that he should have had sixteen: ( for the disciple is not
above his master. Mat. 10.24.) but twice so much as any of the rest of his
fellows, as if Elias spirit had been divided into three parts, he desires
but two parts; and the Apostle alludeth to this, let the elders that rule well
be counted worthy of double honor. 1. Tim. 5.17.

Now that we may understand the better how the eldest got the double portion,
we must know first, that the tribes were divided into families; these families
were like to our kinreds in Scotland, as Grahames, Murrayes, which Buchanan
fitly terms familias; and the families again were divided into households,
this division we see. Josh. 7. When Acans theft was discovered, the lot lighted
first upon the tribe, secondly upon the family, and thirdly upon the household,
and fourthly upon the person. (...) tribus.
The land was first divided into tribes, and that division remained still, and
the tribes got more or less assigned unto them, according to their number.

(...) familia.
The second division was the division in the families, and this word family is
taken three ways in the scripture: The word family taken three ways.
First, for the whole tribe. Judge. 13.2. There was a certain man of Zerah, of
the family of the Danites, that is, of the tribe of Dan; Secondly, family is
taken for the whole kindred descending of one stock. Judge. 6.15. Behold my
family is poor in Manasseh, in the original it is, (...)
Alphi hadal, my thousand is the meanest in Manasseh; in these families there
were many. Judge. 18.2. The children of Dan sent five men of the chief of their
families; because there were but five families or kinreds in Dan. Thirdly,
family is taken for the chief house in the family, this chief house in the
family had a greater portion of land, How the land was divided in the family.
then other households had; and therefore their land might suffer division.
Example, in the family of Elimelech, Ruth 4. the land was divided betwixt
Elimelech and his brother N. and it got the denomination from the eldest
brother, for it was called the family of Elimelech. This Elimelech the eldest
son got the double portion of his fathers goods, but he got not the double
portion of the land in his fathers inheritance, for N. and Boaz got an equal
part with him.

(...) domus. The division of the goods in the house.
Those who were of the household, a less portion of ground was allotted to them,
and the eldest got the whole, as also the double portion of his fathers goods;
the rest got but their share of the goods, and went out of the house. Iesse
David's father had seven sons, the portion of land that was allotted to his
house, it was so little that it could not suffer division amongst them. So
Naboths vineyard, it could not have been divided, it was the portion that
belonged to one household. When Machlon and Chilion died, N. refused to raise up
seed to them, Boaz did the part of a kinsman, and married Ruth, and raised up
seed to him. Ruth 4. therefore the double portion of the inheritance befell to
Boaz; Now if the whole had fallen unto Boaz, he might have divided it into
three parts as it was at the first, betwixt Elimelech, N. and BoaZ: and if he
had had three sons, he might have divided it amongst them; but if he had had
four, he might not have divided it in four parts.

But one in the gospel came to Christ to desire him to divide the inheritance
betwixt him and his brother. Luc. 12.13.

This division is meant of the division in the family, Prove. 17.2. A wise
servant shall have a part of the inheritance amongst the brethren, or as the
Chaldee paraphrast has it, He shall divide the inheritance amongst the
brethren; this division was meant of the chief house in the family, and not
of any division in the household. By this we may understand also, that division
which is spoken of in that parable of the forelorne son; the eldest abode at
home in the house with his father, and got all his fathers inheritance; but the
youngest got a portion of his fathers goods, and went his way.

Whether did the first of the kings sons succeed to the kingdom or not?

By the law of nations, the first borne did succeed. The first borne of kings
succeeded by the law of nations.
Exodus 11.5. From the first borne of Pharaoh who sits upon the throne, and
so amongst the Edomites; He took the eldest son who should have reigned in
his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. 2. King. 3.27,
So 1. King. 2.15. Thou know that the kingdom was mine; and that all Israel
set their faces upon me. And if we shall look before the law was written
amongst the Patr^arches; we shall see, that the first borne had always this
dignity. Genesis 49.3. Ruben thou art my first borne, my might, and the beginning
of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power, which
the Chaldee paraphraseth this ways. Te decebat ut acciperes tres parts,
primogenituram, sacerdotium, and regnum: It became thee to have three parts,
the birthright, Priesthood, and kingdom.

Although the kingdom went by succession, and by right it befell to the
eldest, yet it pleased God to alter this. God sometimes made choice of others
than the first borne to succeed the kingdom.
When Rubens inheritance was divided. 1. Chron. 5. Joseph got the double
portion, Levi got the Priesthood, and Judah got the kingdom; here it went not
by succession, but by free election: So David was the youngest of his fathers
sons, yet it pleased God to make choice of him to the kingdom; and so
Solomon extraordinarily succeeded to the kingdom. Conclusion.


The conclusion of this is; he that was the first borne of the household in
Israel got all the inheritance, and the double portion of the goods, and the
younger brethren were secluded from the inheritance, they got only the portion
of the goods; We are all kings and coheires wi h Christ in the spirit al^
kingdom.
but in our spiritual inheritance, although our elder brother Christ has
gotten the double portion ( being anointed with oil of gladness above his
fellows. Psalm. 45.7.) and the inheritance; yet we who are his younger brethren
are not secluded from the inheritance, but we are coheires with Christ. Romans 8.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of the provision for the daughters. Commandment. V.
Number. 27.8. If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his
inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
THe Jews say that in Israel there was a mutual succession and transmission
of the inheritance; Maimonides de primogenitura.
Secondly, that there was transmission, but not a succession, and thirdly, that
there was succession, but not a transmission; and fourthly, that there was
neither transmission, nor succession.

First, there was a mutual succession betwixt the father and the son, when
the child succeeded to his father, if his son died without children, he
transmitted the inheritance back to his father again, although he were dead;
and then the inheritance descended to the next brethren from the father, and so
to the daughters if there were no brethren; and they succeeded not here as
brothers to their brother who was dead, but as children to their father, as if
he had been alive; and the inheritance was transmitted upward, although it
were even to Adam; therefore the Jews say, that no man wanted an heir in
Israel.

Secondly, the inheritance was transmitted, but there was no mutual
succession. Example, the woman might transmit to her husband all which were
hers, but she could not succeed to her husband.

Thirdly, there was a succession but not a transmission, as the son succeeded
to his mother, but he could not transmit his right to her.

Fourthly, there was neither succession nor transmission, as these who were
uterini, borne of one mother, but not begotten of one father; they did neither
succeed to their brethren, nor yet was there any transmission.

The inheritance descended to the males, and if they had no males, then it came
to the daughters; and if the child was an Hermaphrodite, If there were no males
to succeed, then the daughters succeeded.
of whom they doubted whether he was male or female, then the inheritance fell
not to this Hermaphrodite, but he was reckoned amongst the daughters only,
and got his portion amongst them.

The promise was made at the first to Abraham, and to his seed; Children
continue the name and memory of the family.
but seed here is chiefly meant the males, and therefore the Lord commanded
them to be circumcised, and to carry the badge of the covenant in their
flesh: the inheritance was first promised to the males, because the males kept
the memory of the family; (...) mas. (...) memoria.
Zacar is called Mas, and Zecer is called memoria, therefore Euripides said of
the males (...), columnae familiarum sunt mares. Esaias. 60.10. (...) elegans
paranomasia. (...) filius a (...) filiare septuag. (...) filiae a (...) oblitus
est (...) oblivio. (...) libere.
A Son is called Nin from Nun filiare, which the Seventy translate (...),
permanere, because by sons the name is continued: Absolon said, 2. Sam.
18.18. I have no son to preserve my name. The daughters again are called
Nashin a Nasha, oblitus fuit, to forget, because the name of the family is
forgotten in them: hence amongst the Greeks (...), is called oblivio, because
when men want children, their name is forgotten.

The Lord commanded in his law Deuteronomy. 25.5. If a man die without children, and
Mat. 24.24. (...) commonly is translated filii, but not well, for the daughters
succeeded likewise to the inheritance when there were no sons, and therefore
it should be rather translated liberi, which comprehends both the males and
females, for the word Zerang comprehends both.

The daughters raised up seed to the parents as well as the males did. Ruth.
4.11. The daughters raised up seed to their fathers.
for the women built up the house.

When the daughters married within their own tribe they continued their
fathers name; What daughters raised up seed.
but this is understood only of the daughters who were heretrixes in Israel,
and had no brethren; they were bound to marry within their own family and
tribe. Number. 36.8. but the males might marry in any tribe, because the
inheritance followed them, as David married Michol Saul's daughter of the tribe
of Benjamin, The heretrixes were to marry in their own tribes.
and Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, of the tribe of Issachar. 2. Sam. 3. So the
females might marry with any tribe when they were not heretrixes. The men might
marry in any tribe.
So Saul gave his daughter to Hadriel the Ephramite, and his second daughter to
David who was of the tribe of Judah; and then to Phalti who was of the tribe of
Benjamin; and Caleb offered his daughter to any that would smite
Kiriath-Sepher, and the rest of the tribes swore that they would not give their
daughters to the tribe of Benjamin, which shows that it was usual to the
tribes to marry together.

Those who were not heretrixes might marry in any tribe, Women that were not
heretrixes might marry in any tribe.
therefore the vulgar translation translateth it not well. Number. 36. Every man
shall marry a wife in his own tribe and family, for it is not so in the
original, but this ways, every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
shall keep himself to his own inheritance, and whereas the Lord says, Verse.
9. Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another; the vulgar
translation translateth it badly, ne misceantur tribus, as though the Lord
commanded that one tribe should not marry with another, which the Lord never
forbad, unless by the marriage there had followed a confusion of the
inheritances; the heretrix was ever still bound to marry within her own tribe,
and her son was to succeed to his grandfathers inheritance.

Josh. 24.33. And Eleazer the son of Aaron died, and they buried him in a
hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount
Ephraim. The Priests had no possession in Israel, how had Phinehas this hill
then? they say, that he had it by his mother who was the heretrix, and it fell
to her son; although he might have no inheritance by his father, yet he might
have by his mother; and they say that the familes were still distinguished in
Israel, although they dwelt in several tribes, and they knew (...) suam,
although they were of another tribe, and this kept the tribes distinguished.

Number. 36.9. forbids that the inheritance should remove from one tribe to
another, we must not rest upon that answer, seeing the heretrix was bound to
marry still in her own tribe; when the Lord speaks of the inheritance, What
was meant by the inheritance.
he means of arable lands or vinyards which might not be sold. Levit. 25.23.
What lands or houses might not be sold.
The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine. but a house or a
garden within a walled city might be sold. Levit. 25.30. for that was not a
part of the inheritance in Israel. When Pinchas got this hill, it is meant
only of his habitation, and burial place in his garden; he had not an
inheritance of the land: So Hebron was a city of the Levites, but Caleb had
the fields thereof. Josh. 21.11, 12. And they gave them the city of Arbah, the
father of Anak, (which city is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah, with the
suburbs round about it; but the fields of the city, and the villages thereof
they gave to Caleb the son of Iephunneth for his possession.

Segub who was of the tribe of Manasseth had three and twenty cities in the
land of Gilead 1. Chr. 2.22. Therefore a man in one tribe might possess land
in another tribe.

There was no confusion of the tribes here, for the Manasseth, How Segub had
cities in Manasseth.
lay in the west side of Jordan, of which was Segub; and another part lay on
the east side where Gilead was, which was in the other half tribe of Manasseth.

Again it may be answered, although they had been Manasseth; but they were
taken from the Geshurites in Syria, and were not within the bounds of Canaan,
and so any tribe might have possessed them, as well as they of Manasseth.

But if the tribes might marry together,

When the males married to any other tribe, The women were rekoned to be of the
tribe in which their husbands were.
the women were reckoned still to be of the tribe in which their husbands were
of, and if the women were heretrixes, they behoved to marry still within their
own tribes.

If the woman might marry in another tribe,

If a woman was once married in another tribe, The inheritance came not to the
woman that was married to another tribe. Why the heretrix was to marry in her
own tribe.
and then her brother had dyed without children, the inheritance came not to
her, but to the next in the kindred, as to the Uncles, and to their children,
etc.

The heretrixe might marry none but in her own family, for then the
inheritances might have been confounded, her son being heir to his fathers
inheritance and to his grandfathers also by his mother; and by this we may
understand why Mary being the heretrixe by right, married Joseph one of her
own family and kindred.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, women succeeded unto the inheritance in Israel as
well as the men did, therefore women are not secluded from the kingdom of God
more then men, Galat. 3.28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free,
neither male nor female, for they are all one in Christ.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of the imposition of the name to the child. Commandment V.
Genesis 35.18. She called his name Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin.
THe duties which are common to both the parents toward their children, are
handled already; to impose a name, is a duty which properly belongs to the
father, for the imposition of a name signifies authority; It is the fathers
part to impose a name.
Adam Lord over all the creatures, imposed names to them.

To call how it is taken.
To call, when it has no relation to the first imposition, then it is
understood of those who had no authority to impose the name, as Luc. 1.56. His
friends and kinsmen called him after his fathers name, Zechariah; here to call,
The woman has no authority to impose the name.
is understood, they would have called, or they began to call him so. So Gen
25.30. They called his name Esau, they called his name Edom, that is, they
began to call, and took up this name to call him Edom: for in a speech of many
where one is principal it is singular or plural, as Exodus 15.23. he called it
bitterness, or they called it bitterness, but it is not so to be understood
when the father gives the name to the child, that he or they might call him
so, but the father by his authority imposed the name to him.

The father being lord over the children, and the woman's head, the woman has
no authority to impose the name without the fathers consent: therefore although
the name Ismael was revealed to Hagar Genesis 16.11. And she is commanded to call
him so, yet in the same chapter it is said, that Abraham called his name
Ismael. So Salomons name was given to him by David his father, and when the
Angel Gabriel said to Mary, Thou shall conceive a son and call his name
Jesus, Luc. 1.21. The conception was finished now, and the name was told
already to Mary, Luc. 1.31. Yet the holy Ghost will have Joseph this ways to
give him the name, because he was Christ's reputed father, Matt. 1.21.

When the mother gave the name to the child, The mothers gave not the name but
in extraordinary cases.
there was some extraordinary reason in it; the reason why Leah gave the name
to her son, was, that she might recompense the contempt of her husband, for
he loved her not as Rachel, And she called his name Ruben, for she said, the
Lord has seen mine affliction, now therefore my husband will love me, Genesis
29.31. So the daughters of Lot gave names to their sons, Genesis 19.37.

The mothers imposed names to their children, although they had a father; that
collection then seems not to hold Esaias. 7. (...) pro (...) mutato in
Thou shall call his name Emanuel (vekarath) speaking in the feminine gender to
the virgin, that Christ as man had not a father, some read it better vekarath,
contracte pro vekaraah, and then it is read, unusquisque vocabit, every one
shall call him Jesus.

Names which they should impose should carry some instruction with them, What
names should not be imposed.
as the names which the Patriarchs gave to their children; and such were the
names which the fathers gave both to the Greek and Latin Church, as Deodati,
Quod vult Deus, Timotheus, Theophilus.

Names which should not be imposed to their children are first the names of
God, Emanuel, Jesus, etc.

Jesus given to one in the Church, Colos. 4.11. seeing it was Christ's proper
name.

Whether the name Jesus may be given to any now.
This Jesus was one of the circumcision, and amongst the Jews, Joshua and Jesus
were all one, and they contracted the name of Joshua into Jesus; but now this
name is appropriate to Christ under the Gospel, and it were blasphemy to give
it to any but to Christ: the name Jason signified the same thing which Jesus
does, but it is not appropriated as Jesus name is; therefore a man may call his
son Jason.

(...)
Names of Idols may not be given to children, as Hannibal, [Hhanan Bagnal,] Have
mercy Baal; Hasdrubal, Balthasser, so Malchus from Moloch; such were these
names, Nebuchadnezer, Nebuzarradan, from the Idol Nebo, Esaias 46. The Heathen
called their kings after their Gods.
Nebo is fallen, and Ier. 51. such was the name Evil-Merodah, from Merodah the
god of the Babylonians, Esaias 50. so Benhadad from the Syrian god Adad, which
they pronounced corruptly for Ehhad, unus.

A father should not delay to give a name to his son.
The father should endeavor to give a name to his child as soon as he can; it
was a great commendation to Andronicus and Iunia, that they were in Christ
before Paul. To. 16.7. So it is a great privilege to the child, to be entered
soon into the covenant: when the child was circumcised under the law he was
called Hhatam, (...) Sponsus. Whati Zipporah meant by a bloody husband.
sponsus, because then he was married to the covenant, and so Onkelos
paraphraseth the place, Exodus 4.25. Thou art a bloody husband to me: his
paraphrase is, in sanguine circumcisionis datus est nobis sponsus, and he
thinks that it is not Moses here that is called the bloody husband, but the
child who was circumcised: and therefore as Hhatam in the Hebrew signifies
sponsus: So Hhathan in the Arabicke tongue signifies circumcision, because
they were married to the covenant when they were circumcised. And touched his
feet, they intepret touch here, she hurt, as touch not my Christ Psalm. 105.7.
that is, hurt them not; and by feet, Pe^ pro pudendi^.
they understand the part of the body which was circumcised, or that part which
distinguishes the sexes: so the feet is elsewhere taken, as Esaias 7. He shall
shave the hair of his feet, that is, of the privy part: as the parent
rejoiceth to see his son soon married; so should it be a great joy to the
parent to see his son soon entered into the covenant.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
the Imposition of the name argues the first soverainty of the father over the
child, wherefore the father who resigneth this to others, depriveth himself of
the authority which he has over his child.

EXERCITAT. X. Of the duty of servants to their masters. Commandment V.
Ephesians. 6.5. Servants be obedient to your masters according to the flesh.
THe third combination in the family, is betwixt the masters and the servants.

The ground of servitude and servile subjection is sin; the first servant was a
disobedient son, Nomina domini and servinon naturae sed peccati, and culpa
non natura meruit hoc nomen, Genesis 9.25. Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren: Sin the ground of servitude.
he cursed him thrice, as he blessed Sem twice, and Iaphet once.

When servitude began.
This curse began in the days of Sem, who was Melchisedeck the king of Salem,
when the Canaanites were tributaries to him, and afterward they were servants
to the Israelites.

This servitude was somewhat mitigated in some of their posterity; Some of the
posterity of Ham had a mitigation of their servitude.
the Gibionites were of the offspring of Canaan, Josh 9.25.27. yet they had the
blessing of God upon their service, and he continued them; although Saul would
have roored them out, 2. Sam. 21. So the Cherethites were Canaanites; yet the
Lord mitigated their service, for they became David's guard, and so it was
mitigated in Vrijah the Hittite, and Ebed-melech the blackmoore, and in Arauna
the Iebusite, and in the woman of Canaan; but yet the servitude continued still
upon the posterity of the seven nations, 1. King. 9.21. Solomon did levy a
tribute of bond-service upon them unto this day. And after the captivity,
Nehem. 11.3. and this curse lies yet upon the posterity, as the blackmoores
are sold for slaves unto this day, and the Egyptians are vagabonds.



Thomas 1.2. quast. 94. art. 5.
A thing is said to be de jure naturae two manner of ways; First, when the law
of nature commands such a thing and forbids the contrary. Example, Thou
shall love thy neighbor, the contrary, thou shall not hate him. Secondly, when
such a thing was according to nature in the first institution, but the contrary
is not forbidden. Example, a man by nature is borne naked, nature has not
given him clothing, but art has found out this help for him; now this is not
contrary to nature, because there is nothing forbidden in the first
institution. The first is de jure positivo naturali, Ius natural Positivum:
Negativum.

and we must do nothing contrary to that: but that which is contra jus
negativum, wherein nature has determined nothing but has left that free to
the will of man; here we may do against that law; because nature has
concluded nothing to the contrary.

Again, Servitude both according to the first intention of nature and against
it.
servitude is against the first intention of nature; but if we will consider
the second intention of nature, because nature has intervenied, it is
according to the intention of nature, that some should serve, and some go
free; for as the sensitive faculty should obey the reasonable and serve it: so
should the fool serve the wise man, Prove. 11.29. when such are borne without
judgment, they are fit to serve the wise, although they actually serve not,
nor cannot be compelled to serve.

There were a number in the days of the Apostles who thought that Christian
liberty, and servitude could not stand together; when servants may have this
liberty from their servitude by lawful means, Christian liberty and servitude
may stand together.
they should seek it, that they might come nearer to their first estate
again, when man was created a free creature; therefore those servants who
refused their liberty, when they might have had it, were boared in the ear
with a note of infamy; but of it self it is not an unlawful calling, 1. Cor.
7.2. Tim. 6. And Paul desires Philemon that he receive home again On^simus
his servant: and these were servants after the Roman law, of whom Paul
speaks, which was the hardest sort of servitude that could be.

Seeing servitude is a lawful calling, Deuteronomy. 23.15. Thou shall not deliver unto
his master the servant that is escaped from his master unto thee? this might
seem to loose the bond, which is betwixt the master and the servant.

Servants who fled for religion were to be protected.
The law means of such servants who were Gentiles, and who for their religion
came from their master to the Church of Israel, for otherwise a fugitive
servant was to go back to his master again, as Onesimus to Philemon.

Servants were either servants by birth, or made servants; The first division
of servants.
servants by birth were those, who were borne of handmaids; if the father had
been a free man, and the mother a slave; then the children were slaves: Nam
partus sequitur ventrem, the child is reputed according to the condition of the
mother: but it is otherwise in the covenant of grace. If any of the parents be
holy, then the child is holy, 1. Cor. 7.14. that is, he may be admitted to the
covenant; those who were borne in the house, were called vernae domus; hence
comes vernaculus sermo, the homebred tongue: and opposite to those were
elienigenae, (...) Children begotten in their masters house.
and those vernae domus were called (...) borne in the house; for when a man
married a woman and begat children in their masters house, the children were
not called their children, Allusion.
but their masters children; and David alludeth to this form, Psalm. 116.16. I
am the son of thy handmaid; that is, my mother dwelt within thy house, and
was within the covenant, and I was borne within thy house, and consequently
belong to thee: Hebraus ex Hebrais quid:
when both the parents were Hebrews and free, then the child was free also,
Philip. 5.5. Paul was Hebraus ex Hebrais, that is, both his father and his
mother were Hebrews, and he was free borne.

The second sort of servants were made servants: and they were either Iure
gentium, Servus Iure gentium. Iure civil.
Allusion. Men taken in the war according to the law of nations were made
servants.
or Iure civili; Iure gentium were those who were taken in war, and were
servi belli, and Christ alludeth to this form, Luc. 4.18. when he expresses
the miserable estate of sinners carried captives, he calls them (...) cuspide
captos, run down with a spear, and therefore the prince of the captives in the
captivity was called (...), the prince of the captivity, the Romans called
those servants mancipia, quia manu capti; of whomsoever a man is overcome to
him he is a servant. 2. Pet. 2.19.

Those who were servants jure civili were such as sold themselves to be slaves,
Allusion.
and the holy Ghost alludeth to this sort of servants, Ahab sold himself to
sin, 1. King. 21.25. Although we be sold under sin, and taken captives,
yet let us never sell our selves to sin, Romans 7.14.

The second division of servants; The second division of servants.
the Jews had four sorts of servants in their house; first, those who had the
greatest charge in the house, (...) a radice (...) discurrere.
as Eleazar in Abraham's house, he is called Ben meshek, filius discursus
domus, because he ran up and down, having all the care upon him, and he is
called Dameshek, which is all one with Meshek, the steward of the house, and
Dameshek was his surname, as Eleazar was his proper name, putting daleth before
meshek. (...) pro demonstrativo, apud Syros.
Daleth is the article which the Syrians use to put for He demonstrativo, and
some hold that it was he who built Damascus; such a servant was Joseph in
Potiphers house, Job. 12.18. (...)
He binds [Azor] a girdle upon their loins, [Azor] in the chaldee tongue
signifies a girdle or a purse which the Kings steward wore in the East, such a
servant was Nehemiah the Tirshashite; this comes from the Hebrew word Tirosh,
mustum, (...) Mustum.
and being formed after the manner of the Chaldee names, it is Atirshata; he
was so called, because he was the Kings cupbearer, such a one was Herod's
steward. Luc. 8.3. (...), the Syriacks call him Oeconomus, and the Arabic
thesaurarius, his treasurer; these servants were said stare coram Domino, to
stand before their master. 1. King. 10.8. Happy are thy men, happy are these
thy servants which stand continually before thee, that is, which serve thee;
and the Angel alluding to this form says, I am Gabriel that stand in the
presence of God. Luc. 1.19. that is, ready to serve him and to execute his
will: Such servants were called Meshartim. (...) Ministrantes a (...)
Ministra^it.
Number. 11.28. 1. Chron. 6.32. and 1. King. 1.15. Abishaig is said, [Mesharath]
ministrare regi, to minister to the King; such a servant Christ speaks of,
Mat. 24.45 whom the Lord sets over his household.

The second sort of servants were those who had an inferior sort of service;
such was Elisha that powered water upon the hands of Elias his master; and those
servants were called Gnabhodim properly.

The third sort of servants were those who were more servile. 1. Sam. 8. as
Cooks and Bakers, and these the Romans call mediastini, quia ad media opera
destinati, servants that were busy about service, that was of the middle sort.

The basest sort of service.
The fourth sort of servants were those who were set to the basest sort of
service, as to grind in the man-mill. Exodus 11.5. Even to the first borne of
the maid servant that sits behind the mill, that is, the man-mill, she is
said to sit behind the mill, because she thrust it before her as she wrought;
by the handmaid here is meant the captive, who was set in the basest sort of
slavery; for they made the slaves in the day time grind in the prison; and
shut them up in the night in a pit, Allusion.
and they closed the door with the millstone, and Esaias alludeth to this sort of
servitude, when he says; Take the milstones and grind meal, uncover thy
locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. Esaias.
47.2. all these were signs of their servitude in the captivity. This sort of
servitude at the first amongst the Greeks was called (...) is called pulvis,
because they served in the dust; servants should be as diligent in their
calling, as wrestlers who wrestle in the dust; this word is appropriate now to
Church service.

They had other sorts of servants which were called mercenary servants,
Mercenarie or hirelings.
and this was a more easy kind of servitude; and this servitude endured but
three years. Deuteronomy. 15.18. He has been worth a double hired servant to thee
in serving thee six years, he is worthy of double wages, because he has
served twice as long as a mercenary, for a mercenary served only three years.
Esaias. 16.14. and Job alludeth to this sort of service, Allusion.
are not his days like the days of an hireling. Job. 7.1.

The duties of the servants to their masters are subjection, obedience,
fidelity, and diligence. The duties of servants to their masters.


First subjection, to show their subjection, Servants took their denomination
from their masters.
they took their denomination from their masters, as from Herod, Herodiani; so
from Caesar, Caesariani; from Germanicus, Germaniani. Servus per se non est
persona, sed res, and possessio Domini sui, therefore they are called (...)
possessio. Genesis 24.35. My master is become great, and the Lord has given him
flocks, and herdes, and silver, and gold, and men servants, and maid servants,
and Camels, and Asses; and the Greeks call them (...) quia non habent personam
in jure civili, neque habent patriam, neque heredem; and they call them (...)
their masters feet. 1. Sam. 25.17. Servants called their masters feet.
Let it be given even unto the young men that follow my Lord, in the Hebrew it
is that walk at my Lords feet.

The second duty is obedience, Servants are to obey their masters.
for obediencie they should have their eyes always toward their masters, to
be directed by them, as it were with a word or nod; and as the master teaches
with his eye. Psalm. 32.18. So should the eyes of the handmaid be toward her
mistress. Psalm. 123.2. If they set their eyes toward their masters, then
their masters eye will be toward them for their good; ponam supra te oculum
meum. Genesis 44.21. and Ier. 39.12.

Their obedience should be ready obedience, such was the obedience of the
Centurions servants, I say to one go, and he goes, and to another come, and
he comes. Mat. 8.9. The manner of servants obedience.
Jobs servants were not obedient, I called my servant, and he answered me not.
Job. 19.16. So those servants who answer again to their masters. Tit. 2.9.
Servus sit monosyllabus Domino.

The manner of their obedience should be with fear and trembling: this fear
is not taken here for servile fear, such as is in slaves, for it is the same
word which is used. (...).
Phil. 2.12. With fear and trembling, which is not servile fear, 2. Cor.
7.15. They received Titus with fear and trembling: this was more then servile
fear.

This obedience of servants to their masters is limited; they are but their
masters according to the flesh. Ephesians. 6.5. And Thomas observes well out of
Seneca, that Servitus in totum hominem cujuscunque generis per omnis non
descendit, that is, their commandments reach not to the soul of the basest
slave that is, and therefore slaves are called [(...)] bodies. Revel. 18.13.
because their masters commandments reach only to their bodies, and not to
their souls.

In what cases the servants are free from their masters service.
The servants are free of their masters service in these cases: First, when they
are the Lords prisoners in sickness: Secondly, in the night when they go to
rest; and thirdly, on the Sabbath when they go to serve the Lord.

Servants obey your masters according to the flesh; this signifies the short
continuance of this subjection, for all bonds according to the flesh, cease in
the life to come; as the bond betwixt the man and the wife, so betwixt the
master and the servant, for then they shall be like the Angels of God.

their masters money, Exodus 21.21. and they are reckoned inter mobilia, among
the masters moveable goods. Genesis 24.35. Whether might a servant in Israel sue
his master at the law for any wrong done unto him?

According to the positive laws of the Jews he might not sue his master,
Whether the servant may plead with his master.
but the moral law allows that he should plead with his master if he had
done him wrong. Job. 31.13.14. If I did despise the cause of my man servant or
my maidservant, when they contended with me, what shall I do then when God
rises up? and when he visits, what shall I answer him? did not he who
made me in the mothers womb, make him? There are two reasons here why Job will
not decline to be tried by his servant, because they are alike in creation,
The reasons why servants may plead with their masters.
and shall be presented alike before Gods judgment seat; and therefore it is
good reason that we be both tried in the judicatories of men, God submits
himself as it were to be tried in judgment.
and it is most equitable that my servant have place to plead against me; God
himself refused not to be tried with his servants. Esaias. 49.1. Let us come
near together to judgment. So Ier. 2.9. Gods power is an absolute power, and
it reaches as far as his will does. Secondly, God cannot be angry with his
servants, nor punish them above their deserts, and if he would do so, what
Judge has he above him to call him to account? for if an equal had not power
over his equal, much less over his superior, and his superior in the
highest degree; and yet the Lord will submit himself to be tried, pleading
with base men, that he may be justified in his speeches, when he is judged.
Psalm. 51.4. What is base man then whose breath is in his nostrils, that he
should refuse this judicatory?

The third duty of servants to their masters, Fidelity of servants to their
masters. (...) accilla and (...) nutrix ab (...) f^d^^m effe.
is fidelity: Mat. 24.45. Who is a faithful and a wise servant? Such a servant
was Jacob to Laban, who by all means sought his masters profit; Amah in the
original is called a handmaid, and Omen is called a nurse, which both come
from aman, fidelem esse, because the handmaid should be as faithful to her
mistress, as the nurse should be in keeping of the child committed to her.

The servant labors not for himself but for his master, the talents were
put out by the servants for their masters gain. Mat. 25.27. The Jews say that
there was a question betwixt them and the Cananites which dwelt in Africa (for
when Joshua killed the Cananites, Procopius.
a number of them fled to Africa, as the inscription at Mauritania testifies:
The manner how the Canaanites pleaded for their liberty.
Nos sumus Cananai qui fugimus a facie Ioshuae praedatoris) they came before
Alexander the great to claim their possession in Canaan again, and they said,
that the land of Canaan took the name of their father Canaan. Number. 34.1. And
Gabboath a Jew asked them, what sort of arguments they would use in this their
pleading? they said, they would use arguments taken out of the law: well said
the Jew, it is written, Genesis 9.25. Cursed is Canaan, a servant of servants
shall he be to his brethren. Whatsoever the servant acquireth, it belongs to
the master, but ye are our servants, therefore whatsoever ye have, does
justly belongs unto us; ye see how ye are justly secluded from Canaan, and
have no right to it.

Diligence is required in a servant.
The fourth duty of servants is diligence. Prove. 27.18. He who keeps the
fig tree eats the fruit thereof, so he that waits upon his master shall
be honored: Stare pro servire.
Servants were said to stand before their master. Ier. 18.20. 1. King. 17.1. 2.
King. 5.16. Beati servi qui stant coram te: David alludeth to this, Psalm.
134.1. Bless ye the Lord all ye servants of the Lord which by night stand in
the house of the Lord. And 135.2. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord. Such
a servant was Eleazer, who was Ben Meshok, filius discursus, in Abraham's house.
So Luc. 17.7. Which of you having a servant who having served all the day, does
not gird himself at night, etc.

How Appelles painted a servant.
Appelles painted a servant with his hands full of tools, to signify that he
should be diligent in his work; with broad shoulders, to bear many wrongs;
with Hinds feet, to run speedily at his masters command; with a lean belly,
that he should be content of a spare diet; with the ears of an Ass, and his
mouth shut with two keys, to signify that he should be swift to hear, and
slow to speak.

EXERCITAT. XI. Of the masters duties to their servants. Commandment. V.
Ephesians. 6.9. And ye masters do the same things to them.
THe masters duties to servants are, first, to command them; secondly, to
instruct them; thirdly, to feed them; fourthly, to correct them; and lastly to
reward them.

First, to command them; their commandments must be pia, possibilia, and
proportionalia, they should be holy, Pracepta Pia. Possibilia. Proportionalia.

things possible, and things that are proportionable to their strength: they
should be pia; when Saul commanded Doeg to run upon the Priests and kill them.
1. Sam. 22.18. this was a wicked commandment.

Secondly, they should be possibilia; Genesis 24.8. And if the woman will not
follow thee, then thou shall be clear of this mine oath.

Thirdly, they should be proportionalia, Levit. 25.43. Thou shall not rule over
him with rigor. So Ephesians. 6, 9. First, the Egyptians caused the Israelites to
gather the straw; Secondly, to make the brick; and thirdly, they caused them
to make the pots. (...) in duritie.
Psalm. 81.5. Fecerunt manus transire per ollas, and yet they said, perficite
opera in die suo, (...) manus ejus transierunt per ollas.
that is, they would have the whole days task of them. So Exodus 1.15.
Fecerunt Israel servire in duritie, they made Israel to serve with rigor; they
have a proverb in the Talmud, juxta robur cameli dant super ipsum onera, that
is, they should lay no more upon him then he is able to bear: this (...) est
violenta servitus. Mat. 5.41. and this hard service is called an iron furnace.
Deuteronomy. 4.20.

Masters ought to instruct their servants. (...) a (...) Catechismus.
The second duty of the master to the servants is to instruct them; Abraham
brought forth [Hhanichau] his catechized servants. So Josh. 24. I and my house
shall serve the Lord, and so Ezekias instructed his servants to write out a
part of Salomons Proverbs. Prove. 25.1. Servants should adorn the doctrine of
Jesus Christ. Tit. 2.19. which they cannot do unless they be taught.

The masters duty to his servants to feed him.
The third duty of the master to the servants is to feed them, Thou shall not
muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. 1. Cor. 8.9. The ox
when he was treading out the corn might eat as much as he pleased; Allusion.
and the Prophet alludeth Hos. 10.11. Ephraim delighted in threshing, but not
in plowing, that is, in the commodity of religion, but not in the pains to
reap up his heart; and the Hebrews have a proverb, Bos debet edere ex
tritura sua; the heathen put an Engine about their servants neck, The Heathen
used their servants hardly.
which they called (...), and it reached down to their hands, that they might
not so much as lick of the meal when they were sifting it; here the servants
amongst the heathen, were in a worse case then the oxen amongst the Jews. Job.
29.11. They made their servants to die for thirst when they were treading out
the vinepresses: the virtuous woman rises while it is night, and gives meat
to her husband, and a portion to her handmaids. Prove. 31.15. See Salomons
example, 2. Chron. 2.10. and 1. King. 5. There are many niggard masters now,
that will allow no more to their servants then Ahab did to Micajah when he was
his prisoner. 1. King. 2.2. (...) Aqua pressurae, id est exigua. (...) Panis
dimensio. (...) Dimensum, id est quaternt modij frumenti quos servi accipiebant
in mensem.
Cibato eum exiguo pane and aqua pressurae, that is, with a little water which
used to be given to prisoners; and in effect, they fed them with tears, Psalm.
80.5. That portion which the masters in old times gave to their servants was
called Lehhem hhuk, panis dimensi, and (...) the measure which was measured out
to servants in corn, this the heathen called (...).

As masters should not pinch their servants, Pythagoras said, Noli insidere
chaeniei, that is, have not a care what ye shall eat the morrow.
so they must not daintily bring them up, He that daintily brings up his
servant from a child, shall have him [ijhjeh manon] become his son at the
last, and the Hebrews give an example of this in Jeroboam, (...) Filius
who being so much made of, affected the kingdom afterward.

The fourth duty is to correct them, and to cover their less offenses; nagnar
and (...), (...) Puer. (...) Colaphum incutere.
is both a child and a servant: why are servants called children in the
Scripture? but to teach masters to correct them gently.

They used sundry sorts of corrections, first (...), (...) Crepida, to beat
with a shoe or pantofle et non a (...), virga to beat with a rod. (...)
Depilantibus, a (...) Depilavit.
to buffet; then (...), to beat with a shoe or pantofle; then (...), barbae
vellicatio, the pulling of the beard, Esaias 50.6. I gave my back to the smiters,
and my cheeks [lemoritim] to them that plucked off the hair. For great
offenses the master might whip his servant ad tumorem, ad livorem, ad
sanguinem: The blewenesse of the wound chaseth away evil, Prove. 20.30. but he
should whip him so thar he leave not a scarre or mark behind him, the Greeks
called these (...), that is, servi stigmatici, whose backs were marked like
the moore hen; Masters should not correct their servants rigorously,
and they were so called ab atagine, this belongs only to the magistrate to
mark and stigmatize them.

Although the Lord grant great liberty to masters over their servants in
correcting them, yet they have no power over the life of their servants, and
therefore the master is not excused, Exodus 21.20. If he had struck his
servant with a weapon purposing to kill him, and he kill him. He is excused
only if he beat him with a rod, Masters have no power over the life of their
servants.
having an intention only to chastise him, and in the mean time he dye: it
is not to be presumed that he did this of purpose to kill his servant; but if
he had beaten him with such violence that he had presently dyed under his
hand, then he was holden as the murderer of him; and whereas it is said Exodus
21.21. He is his money, this freeth him neither in the court of conscience nor
before men, as if he had power to kill his servant: neither was he freed, but
in so far as it was presumed that he would not have killed him when he
bought him, but only to chastise him.

Masters should reward their servants.
The last duty of masters to the servants, is to reward them, Exodus 21.13. At
he came in with his body, so he shall go out with his body. He shall go
out with his body, that is, he shall go out alone; and it is opposite to
that, he shall go out with his wife, that is, if he had been married before
they shall both go out free.

And Deuteronomy. 15.13. Thou shall not send him away empty, but thou shall reward him
liberally. In the original it is [bagnanek tagnanik lo] thou shall honorably
send him away, (...) H^^^rando honorarium et ^^^is ve^ torquem au^e^m collo
ejus impone^^ imp^^^^^^ (...) ter^^^.
or thou shall put a chain about his neck when thou sendest him away. When
masters reward their servants, and servants do their duty faithfully, this is
called (...), Matt. 20.2. he agreed with them for a penny, (...); when the
servant serves faithfully, and the master rewards him not liberally, this
makes a jarre in music. Esaias 16.14. But now the Lord has spoken saying,
within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall
be contemned, with all that great multitude, and the remnant shall be very
small and feeble. Here is an allusion to the manner how the Jews paid the
wages of their mercenary servants, annus mercenarij, Annus ^ercenarij quid,
was the year when he had complete his full time, Allusion.
and served neither more nor less, then he got his full wages and nothing was
diminished, nor the payment was delayed; so Moabs cup is full, and therefore
the Lord will not defer his punishment, but punish him presently.

Now, that masters may perform this duty the better to their servants, let
them remember that of Job. 13.14. He who created me created him in the womb.
Motives to move masters to perform duty to their servants.
When John fell down before the angel to worship him, the angel said, Do it
not, for I am thy fellow servant; Revel. 19.10. much more may masters say to
their servants, I am thy fellow servant: by nature and birth they are equal
with them, Homines contubernales, humiles amici, and conservi, and habent cutem
communem, licet non vestem: They live under one roof, they are friends of a
lower condition, they are covered with the same skin, and they differ only in
apparel; and as they differ not in creation, so neither in redemption, Galat.
3.28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, neither male nor female,
for they are all one in Christ: the servant paid the half sicle as well as the
master. And let them remember that they shall be equal with them in death, Job
3.19. The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his
master.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
if masters look up to their great master the Lord, Supra Se, In Se, Iuxta Se,
Infra Se,

they will do their duty to their servants under them; a man has a fourefold
obligation; first to God, supra se; then to himself, in se; then to his
equals, ^^xta se; and then to his inferiors, infra se; if they look up to him
that is above them, it will teach them their duty to those who are under them.

EXERCITAT. XII. Of the duties of the subjects to their King. Commandment. V.
Romans 13.2. Whosoever resists the power, resists the ordinance of God.
WE have spoken of the combination in the family, now we come to the
combination in the polity, betwixt subjects and their Prince.

As children are bound to honor their parents in the family, so are subjects
to honor their King in their polity. The duties of subjects to their Prince
are first, to honor him; secondly, to be subject unto him; and thirdly, to be
obedient unto him.

First, to honor him, and to have an inward respect unto him; for his callings
sake; not only for his gifts of body or mind, but because he is Gods
lieutenant and deputy upon the earth here: Christ said, That he who receives
a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall not want his reward, Matt. 10.41.
that is, if we respect him as he is a prophet only, and for no other respect:
so the subjects when they honor their King, only because he is their king,
and for no by respect, then they honor him rightly.

Kings are to have their due styles.
From this inward reverence and estimation they are bound to give him his due
styles and titles; they are called the breath of our nostrils, Lament. 4.11. So
the shields of the earth. Psalm 47.9. And lapides sanctitatis, Lament. 4.1. and
Vectes, the bars, Hos. 11.6. For as the bars carried the arc, so do they
the weight of the common wealth, and they are called (...), Act. 1.23. and
(...), Luc. 22.25. The highest titles and styles belong to God only; titles in
the second place belong unto the angels who are Gods ministers; they are called
Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, Coloss. 1.16. and in the third
place belong to Princes who are Gods deputies; subjects must not give that to
their prince which is due to God, as when they said to Herod, Number. 12.8.
Wherefore then are ye not afraid to speak against my servant against Moses.
Sol. larch^ marketh upon this place, he says not against my servant Moses,
but against my servant against Moses: against my servant, although he were not
Moses: Against Moses my great servant, seeing he is both my servant and my
servant Moses, how can ye speak against him? such a speech is that Genesis 21.10.
He shall not be heir with my son with Isaac, he shall not be hair with my
son, who am a free woman; nor with Isaac who is the child of promise.
The voice of a god and not of a man, Act. 12.22. We must not give them that
which belongs unto angels; their highest titles are to be called Gods upon
earth, and to resemble the angels, Thou art wise as an angel of God, 2. Sam.
14.15. therefore to speak disdainfully of them, as the Israelites said, What
portion have we in David? neither in the son of Iesse, 1. King. 12.15. that
is a great sin; it is a sin to curse him in their bedchamber, for a bird of
the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings, shall tell the
matter, Eccles. 10.2. But the greatest sin to rail publicly against him,
Thou shall not curse the ruler of my people, as Shimei did David, 2. Sam. 16.
Thou shall not curse the ruler of my people; he is the father of the
commonwealth, and a man must not curse his father and his mother, for then he
is to die the death: the king is the light of the body, and he that touches
him touches the apple of his eye: We must speak of princes (...) or (...),
that is, either briefly or sweetly.

So to give hom^ge to them, to kiss them, 1. Sam. 10. Samuel kissed Saul; this
was called osculum homagij, the kiss of homage; David alludes to this, Psalm.
2. Kiss the son it was their manner, that others did not kiss the King
himself, but they laid their hand under his hand, and then kissed their own
hand, thus did Solomon's brethren to him, but the inferiors laid their hand
under his thigh, and then blessed it, Genesis 24. and the Ethiopians use to do
unto this day as R. Abraham testifies.

That we may the better take up what honor is due to Princes, let us consider
Psalm. 82. who endited this Psalm? it was the Lord: who wrote it? it was Asaph:
against whom was it directed? (...)
it was directed against evil Judges, Verse. 5. They know not, neither will
they understand, they walk on in darkness, and all the foundations of the
earth are out of course: yet mark what he says of these Judges: Ye are gods,
and all of you are the children of the most high; If these be called gods whom
he reproves so sharply for neglect of their duty, how are they then to be
reguarded, as the children of the most high, who accept not the persons of the
wicked? Verse. 2. Who defends the poor and fatherless, Who does justice to
the afflicted and needy, and riddeth them out of the hand of the wicked, verse.
4.

Subjects owe to their Prince another sort of honor, to honor them with their
goods, as we are said to honor God with our substance, Prove. 3.9. So should
we honor the Prince with our substance; Asconius. Census Vectigalis. Canonis.
Capitationis.

there was a threefold tribute which they paid to the king of old: Census
vectigalis, census canonis, and census capitationis. Census vectigalis was the
tribute or custom which he got of strangers; (...) peculium.
Census canonis was the kings set rent, or his Segulla; and Census capitationis
was the pole money which they paid unto him head by head, Act. 22.26. Paul
said, I bought it with a great sum (...): because this sum was gathered
head by head, 1. Sam. 10.27. but the children of Belial said, How shall this
man save us? and they despised him, and brought him no presents: but such as
the Lord touched their hearts brought gifts to him: if they be called the
children of Belial who offered no gift to the king, much more are these the
sons of Belial who refuse to pay, that which is due unto him.

The second duty of the subject to their Prince is subjection, they are to
subject themselves to the Prince, because his government is the ordinance of
God.

How is magistracy called the ordinance of God, Peter called it an humane
ordinance, 2. Pet. 2.13. Submit your selves [(...)] to every ordinance of man.

It is the ordinance of God, How magistracy is both called a divine ordinance,
and an ordinance of man.
because God has appointed Princes to rule, Prove. 8.16. By Me Princes reign,
but it is called an ordinance of man, because the several forms of government
are not from God immediately, but they may be added by man's discretion
according to times, places and persons: but it is not so in the ministry, for
as the original of it is from God, so are the number of the offices set down
in his word.

In the civil administration he uses the natural sense and reason of man,
left in man after the fall, to rule and to prescribe laws, except only in the
laws of Moses policy; but concerning Church policy, the Son of God out of
his own mouth prescribes laws to it.

Magistracy is an humane ordinance subjective, because men are the subject of
it; secondly, objective, because it handles humane affairs; and thirdly,
(...) in respect of the end, for it was instituted for the good of man.

When we submit our selves to the authority of the Prince, and to the
authority of the Church,

The authority of the Prince, praest imperio suo, but Church men praesunt
legatione aliena, as they are Ambassadors from the Lord, Priores sem per
obtinent dignitatem, hi in causa legationis tantum, and so we are to obey them
only.



We must distinguish here betwixt the Kings person and his calling; the kings
person is but one, and his subjects are many; but if we shall consider the
Kings calling, he is above the people, 2 Samuel 18.3. Thou art worth ten thousand
of us.

King. 12.7. If thou will be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve
them, and answer them?

The word service how it is taken.
The word [service] is not taken properly here, but only thus, if thou will
yield to them in somethings, and therefore 2. Chr. 10.7. it is said, If thou will be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them:
here he explaineth what he meant by that, If thou will serve them, that is,
to deal kindly with them.

Humane laws are to be obeyed when they are subordinate to the law of God.
We obey the Prince when we obey his laws, for Princes laws when they are
right, are derived from the eternal law; for even as the second causes bring
forth their natural effects, because they are subordinate to the first cause;
so humane laws are to be obeyed when they are subordinate to the law of God,
By me kings reign, Prove. 8.16. So Ioh. 18. Thou should have no power except
it were given thee from above; this obligation depends not from the will of
man, but from the first cause, the power of God; therefore who resists the
power, resists the ordinance of God, Romans 13.2. So Number. 16.11. What are we?
ye have not murmured against us, but against the Lord.



Whether the breach of Gods laws and the Princes laws be one sin.
The law of the Prince brings in a new obligation; the breach of the first law
is injustice, and the breach of the second law is disobedience.

Whether do laws of Princes bind the conscience?

They bind not the conscience primario and per se; because he only who can
punish the soul, Gersom uses this comparison. The laws of the Prince bind
not the conscience primario and per se.
When a Physician prescribes to his patient to eat no poysonable meat, if he
should eat of it, he sins not here primario, because he breaks the
Physicians command; but because this is forbidden, in the sixth commandment,
Thou shall not murder; and as the soul is said to be in a place per
concomitantia^, because it is in the body which is properly in a place: Simile.
So the laws of men are said to bind the conscience per concomitantia^,
because they depend upon the law of God; and they are agreeable to it, which
primario and per se binds the conscience.

Whether does a man's conscience bind him more,

His conscience binds him more than the law of his superior. Let every soul
be subject to superior powers, Romans 3.1.
and the commadement of the superior loses the commandment of the inferior.

The conscience has none directly above it, Whether the conscience or the
commandment of the superior bind more strictly,
but God only, but a magistrate may have some other above him, the conscience
being the immediate deputy of God must bind more strictly than the commandment
of the magistrate, who is but mediately set under God. But here we must learn
to put a difference betwixt these things which are indifferent in themselves,
and these things which are simply forbidden or commanded. In these things which
are indifferent we are more bound to follow the commandment of the magistrate,
than our own consciences; but in these things which are good or evil in
themselves, we are more bound to follow our conscience in shunning of the one,
and following of the other, than to the commandment of the magistrate. Again
observe a difference betwixt subjection and obedience, A difference betwixt
obedience and subjection.
there may be subjection where there is not obedience, if a Prince should
command a thing not lawful, we are not to obey it, but yet we are still
subject to the Prince; and to testify thy subjection to him, thou must disobey
with all reverence. Dan. 3.18. Be it known to thee, O King, that we will not
serve thy gods, nor worship thy golden image which thou have set up. They
refused to give obedience to his unlawful commandments, and yet they submit
themselves most willingly, and acknowledge him to be their King.



How the King is subject to the law.
The King is subject to the directive part of the law, but not to the coactive
part of it. The law is considered two ways, first, as it is the rule of
justice, and the line by which both the Prince and the people should be
guided: The Emperor said well, legibus solutus legibus tamen vivit. Secondly,
the law is considered as an instrument which the Prince uses for the ruling of
his subjects: if we consider the law in the first sense, the Prince is subject
to it; but consider the law as an instrument which the Prince uses in ruling
of the people, in this sense, Simile.
he is not subject to it: a blind man is led by his servant, so far as his
servant leads him, he is not his servant, or his inferior; but consider the
servant as an instrument serving his master, although he were never so sharp
sighted, yet he is inferior and serves him.

Obediencia Activa. Passiva.

The last duty is obedience; There is a twofold obedience, active obedience, and
passive obedience; active obedience when we obey their commandments, and
passive obedience when we submit our selves to their punishments.

Contrary to this obedience is, quando mendaciter se subijciunt. Psalm. 18.44.
When they yield fained obedience: Prove. 24.21. My son fear the Lord and the
King, Essani what.
and meddle not with them that are given to change. Essani were called Hashoni
rebels, (...) Rebels seditiosi.
they taught the Jews not to acknowledge the Romans Empire, teaching them that
they should be subject to none but to God. Prove. 30.29. There are three things
which go well, (...) compositum ex (...) et (...)
yea four which are comely in going, a Lion which is strong amongst beasts,
and turns not away for any; a Greyhound, an he Goat also, and a King against
whom there is no rising up.

The conclusion of this is, the Jews say, Conclusion.
Esto orans pro salute regni, nam si non esset authoritas publica, vir proximum
suum deglutiret, ut pisces majores minores: Pray for those who are in
authority, for if there were no authority to restrain oppressors, then the
wicked would devour them that are more righteous then he, and make men as the
fishes of the sea, which have no ruler over them. Habak. 1.13.14.

EXERCITAT. XIII. Of spiritual fathers and the honor due to them.
Commandment. V.
1. Tim. 5.17. Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.
THis word father is taken sundry ways in the Scripture; The word father taken
diversely.
The Israelites are called the sons of Jacob and Joseph, Psalm. 77.15. they
are called the sons of Jacob, because they came of his loins; and they are
called the sons of Joseph, because he fed them and nourished them in Egypt.
The Israelites why called the sons of Jacob or Joseph.
So Number. 3.1. These also are the generations of Aaron and of Moses, they were
Aarons generation by nature, and they are called Moses generation; because he
taught them and instructed them: and so the Preachers are called spiritual
fathers, because they beget children by the immortal seed of the word. 1 Pet.
1.23. and 1 Cor. 4.15. In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel.
So Gal. 4.19. My little children of whom I travel in birth till Christ be
formed in you.

Children that are begotten of this incorruptible seed will reverence their
fathers; and those who be (...), 1. Tim. 1.3. and not bastards, and (...) nobly
borne. Act. 17.11. they will carry all due reverence and respect to their
parents; but those who are only mothers children will not so honor their
parents. Cant. 1.6.

The first part of honor due to pastors.
The first part of honor which children owe to their parents, is to call them
fathers, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
2. King. 13.14.

Mat. 23.9. Call no man your father upon earth, for one is your father which is
in heaven.

How Pastors may be called fathers.
Christ reproves there only the ambitious affectation of the Pharisees, who
delighted much to be called fathers; when the Pharisees sat in Moses chair,
then they might call them fathers, that is, as long as they taught the truth;
but when they were not directly subordinate to God, and affected that which was
due only to him, then they were not to be counted as fathers. M^rke the
opposition, call no man your father, for one is your father in heaven; if the
earthly father be subordinated to the heavenly, then ye may call him father:
but when he affects that which is due to the heavenly father, Instrumentum
Con^unctum. Remotum.

to whom belongs the kingdom, the power, and the glory, then call him not
father. Again, when the earthly father counts himself instrumentum
conjunctum gratiae, and not remotum, then count him not father; but if he
count himself only instrumentum remotum, then count him father. Example, God
when he cures a man by physic; physic is instrumentum propius, and the man
who applies it, is instrumentum rem^tius: So the word it self is instrumentum
conjunctum, and the minister who applies it, is but instrumentum remotum. Now
if he should think himself to be instrumentum conjunctum, he is not to be
called father. So spiritual fathers are called Angels. Rev. 2.1. and Saviors,
Obadiah 21. But here we must take heed, that we apply not this word in
particular, to this or that spiritual father, as to say, this is my Savior,
this is my Angel; for as Judges are called Gods in general, it cannot be said
so of this or that particular man, that he is a god: So although this word
Angel be said of the ministers in general; yet it cannot be applied to any of
them in particular.

So the Scripture usually calls Prophets, Prophets called the men of God.
(...) Vir Dei.
[Ish Elohim] the men of God, that is, the excellent men of God; as Samuel is
called the man of God. 1. Sam. 9.7. Elijah a man of God: 1. King. 17.24. the
young Prophet a man of God. 1. King. 13.1. Elisha a holy man of God, Moses
called the man of God. Deuteronomy. 33.1. 1. Chron. 23.14. and Ezr. 3.2. David a man
of God. 2 Chronicles. 8.14. Igdaliah a man of God, Ier. 35.4. So in the new
testament Timothy is called a man of God. 1. Tim. 5.11. and generally it is
applied to all Preachers, that the man of God may be made perfect. 2. Tim. 3.16.

These things which are Gods are are most excellent; so should they be who are
separated to this holy calling, he has concredited to them his word; the
breaking of bread to his people, and the custody of the souls of his people,
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch
for your souls, as they that must give account. Heb. 13.17.





Exodus 22.28. Thou shall not curse the gods, Paul gives this style to the high
priest. Act. 23.5.

Paul gives this title to him here as a Judge, because he was sitting in
judgment; but not as he was the high Priest.

A second duty to spiritual fathers is to behave our selves reverently toward
them.
The second part of honor due to spiritual fathers, is performed by outward
gestures, as saluting them, and bowing to them. 2. King. 4.27. Contrary to this
reverence is to speak disdainfully of them. 2. King. 9.11. Wherefore came this
mad fellow to thee? So 2. King. 2.23. Go up thou bald head go up thou bald
pate. They mocked and stoned him, and wished that he might be taken away in the
whirlwind, as his master Elijah was taken away before him.

These duties should be performed as they are Preachers, to receive a Prophet
as a Prophet. Mat. 10.41. this is true honor.

A third duty is maintenance.
The third part of the honor due to Preachers is to give them maintenance; this
is called double honor. 1 Timothy 5.17. which is an allusion to the double
portion, which the first borne got under the law.

First, this maintenance should be given them in due time. Tardar^ lachrymam
quid apud Hebraeos.
Exodus 22.29. Non tardabis lachrimam tuam, Thou shall not delay to offer thy
first fruits and thy liquor; it is called lachryma, a tear; because it was
pressed out in the press like tears. Qui cito dat, bis dat; they that give
soon, give twice. Psalm. 68.52. Aethiopia currere fecit manus suas ad Deum,
Currere fecit manus, quid apud Hebraeos.
they made their hands run to the Lord, to note their speediness in giving.

Secondly, it should not be contracta manus, a shut hand. Deuteronomy. 15.7. they
gave it secundum sufficientiam spontaneitatis manus, according to the
sufficiency of the free will offering. Deuteronomy. 16.10. Contracta manus quid,
(...) manus aperta (...) manus clausa.
following the example of God himself, who opens his hand and fills with
his blessings every living thing. Psalm. 145.16.

Thirdly, they gave it cheerfully: Deuteronomy. 16.11. And thou shall rejoice before
the Lord thy God; the Lord loves a cheerful giver. 2. Cor. 9.7.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
Ministers are worthy of double honor; but many will scarce allow to them now
the maintenance of Micahs Levite; ten shekels of silver, a suite of apparel,
and meat and drink. Judge. 17.10.

EXERCITAT. XIIII. Of the promise annexed to the fifth Commandment.
Ephesians. 6.7. Honor thy father and thy mother (which is the first commandment
with promise,) that it may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the
earth.
THe Lord commanded the Jews to reverence their parents, and he adds the
reason, that their days may be long in the land. Deuteronomy. 22.6. Thou shall not
take the dame with the young ones, that thy days may be prolonged in the land;
they were commanded to spare the dame, because she represented the parents in
bringing up of her young ones; and if their days should be prolonged for
sparing the dame, much more for honoring their parents.

That thy days may be long in the land, (...) prolongabunt dies tuos
transitive, vel prolongabuntur dies tui intransitive.
in the Hebrew it is, that they may prolong thy days [Iarichun jamecha]
Parents are said to prolong the days of the children, because they are
instruments of the prolonging of their days by praying to God for them, and
they testify that they would have them to live long, and in this sense
Ministers are said to save themselves and those that hear them. 1. Tim. 4.16.
or, that thy days may be long in the land, that is, may be prolonged,
prolongentur. So Luc. 12.20. This night they shall take away thy soul, that
is, thy soul shall be taken away.

Parents prolong the days of their children by their prayers.
Parents prolong the days of their children by their prayers: learn hence what
a good custom it is for children to be taught to seek their fathers
blessing, for the parents blessing has great force to convey the blessing to
the children. (...) cum benedictionibus (...) hic significat cum and non supra.
Genesis 49.36. The blessings of thy father are with the blessings of my
progenitors; all the blessings of the predecessors concurring with the
blessings of the father have great force.

What it is to die in an old age.
They shall prolong thy days. Long life is a blessing of God, thou shall come
in a lusty old age to the grave. Job. 5.26. this the Greeks call (...), and
the Hebrews made a feast when they were past sixty years of age; Calah is
abundance of days, thou shall go to thy grave in abundance of days; and age
is promised as a blessing, not a troublesome old age, but a lusty and strong
old age. Genesis 25.8. Then Abraham gave up the Ghost, and died in a good old age,
an old man and full of days, Job says, thou shall come to thy grave in a full
age. Deuteronomy. 33.25. As thy days are, so shall thy age be, that is, thou shall be
in thine old age, as thou wast in thy young years; and it is said of Moses,
Deuteronomy. 34.7. That he was an hundred and twenty years old when he died, and his
eyes were not dimmed, nor his natural force abated; that is, his humidum
radicale, or natural moisture was not abated, (...) Humidum radicale. (...)
Gena, maxilla.
or as Hierom reads it, his eyes were not dim, nor his teeth loosed.

Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shocke of corn comes
in, in his season. Job. 5.26. Mark an excellent comparison here betwixt
reaping and death. First, the woman conceives the seed in her womb, A
comparison betwixt reaping and death.
and it is formed there, then the child is borne; herbescit in peritia, he
grows up like a tender plant in his young years; then adolescit, he shoots
up and promises some fruit; and then he grows old, withered, and white;
then death cutteth him down, and then he is threshed and winnowed, and all
his goods taken from him. Lastly, he is laid up in the grave as in a barn, to
be brought forth in the spring time at the resurrection.

How is this promise fulfilled?

There is a twofold reckoning of a man's life in the Scriptures: First, How the
promise of long life is fullfilled.
when they are old in years and have made no progress in grace; young in
years and old in grace: of old they commended the wisdom of the aged in
youths, and they called it (...), as he would say, young old; such a one was
Solomon, when he was young in years, yet he was old in grace; and Josias
while he was yet young, began to seek after the God of David his father. 2.
Chron. 34.3.

There are others who are old in years but have made no progress in grace:
the Lord observes these two, Esaias. 65.20. There shall be no more thence an
infant of days, nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days, for the
children shall die an hundred years old, but the sinner being an hundredth
year old shall be accursed.

So that we may observe men of three conditions, Some young in year, and old
in grace.
some are young in years but old in grace, as Solomon and Josias. Secondly,
some old in years and old in grace. Old in years and old in grace.
Prove. 16.31. The hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of
righteousness, and Esaias. 46.4. And even to your old age I am he, and even to
your hoary hairs will I carry you. Levit. 19.22. Hoarie head put for a wiseman.
Thou shall rise up before the hoary head, the Chaldee paraphrast paraphraseth
it, thou shall rise up before the wise, Old in years but not in grace.
for then the age is honorable when it is found in the way of righteousness.
And thirdly, some old in years, but not in grace; as Ioab. 1. K^^^ 2.6. Let
not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace. When an obedient son to
his parents dies young, How children are said to die an hundredth year old.
his young years are reckoned as an hundred years to him, but when a
disobedient son lives an hundred years, yet he is accursed before God; and
diu fuit, sed non diu vixit, that is, he has been long, but he has not lived
long; for even as a ship when she is tossed to and fro in the sea by stormy
winds and tempests, Simile.
we do not say that she has sailed long, but that she has been tossed to
and fro, but when she tends directly to the harbor, then she is said to
sail: So although a wicked man be here long upon the earth, yet he is not
said to live long, but to be long tossed to and fro; and he is accursed before
the Lord, and the obedient son has his young years reckoned to him as an
hundred years.

That thy days may be prolonged in the land, it is meant here of a good age,
which has both a natural life and the spiritual life, for Godliness has
the promises both of this life, and of the life to come. 1 Timothy 4.8.

Disobedience to parents cut short the life of the children.
Disobedience to parents cutteth short the life of the children, as Hophui and
Phineas for disobedience to their father Eli, and Absolon for his disobedience
to his father David: Observe what judgments light upon such disobedient
children. First they are accursed as Ham was, Genesis 9. Secondly they die a
miserable and violent death. Prove. 30.17. The eye that mocketh at his father,
Light or lamp put for the posterity.
and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
and the young eagles shall eat it. Thirdly, He that curses his father or his
mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness: that is, he shall die
childlesse, and shall not have one to succeed unto him to continue his name. So
the Lord said that he will give Solomon one Tribe, that David may have a light
always in Jerusalem: that is, one to succeed in his kingdom, so the woman of
Tekoah called her ^^^^e her cole, 2. Sam. 14.7. They shall quench my cole wh^
(...) left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon
the earth. And Nadab, and Abihu, because of their rebellion, dyed before the
Lord in the wilderness, and they had no children. Numb. 3.4. and 2 Chro. 24.2.

The bloody and deceitful man shall not live out half his days, Psalm.
55.23. and Job. 15.32. How the bloody man lives not half his days.
He shall be cut off before his time. So Eccles. 7.17. Mori in tempore non suo
quid.
Why should thou die before thy time. A man dies before his time when he
shortneth the ordinary course of his life by sin, as when the bloody man is
cut off for murder by the Magistrate, he dies before his time: for by the
course of nature he might have lived longer. Secondly, he dies before his
time, when he is not ripe fruit to the Lord; the wicked are never ripe fruit
to God, Hosea. 9.10. I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your
fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at the first time.

Whither thou art to go, No typical holiness now in one land more then in
another.
but the Apostle when he repeateth this promise, says only, That thou may
live long on the earth, Ephesians. 6.3. but he leaves out, whither thou art to
go, because now there is no typical holiness more in one land than in
another.

This shows the folly of the Jews who hold that they who are buried out of
Canaan, at the resurrection shall be carried through the cavernes of the earth,
until they come to the holy land of Israel, and there they shall rise: and
this they call [gulgulmehhilloth] volutatio cavernaru^. (...) volatatio
cavernarum.


Secondly it refuteth the superstitious conceit of many who think that there
is more holiness in Canaan than in any other land, and many bloody battles
have been fought for it; whereas now it is no better than any other land.

Commandment. VI.
EXERCITAT I. Of Murder in general.
Exodus 20.13. Thou shall not kill.
Great barbarity to put out the life of man.
IT is a great barbarity to put out the life of man who is the workmanship of
God: when a skillful weaver of tapestry is weaving a curious piece of work,
he permits his apprentises to weave the common sort of work, Simile.
as the beasts, the fowls, and such: but when he comes to the weaving of the
picture of man, that piece of work he takes in his own hand: so the Lord
when he created the world, he said, Let the water bring forth the fishes, God
made the water and the earth to bring out other creatures, but he made man with
his own hand.
and the earth the beasts, he permits this piece of work to be done as it
were by his apprentises; but when he comes to that excellent piece of work,
to make man, then he says, Genesis 1.26. Let us make man, (...) Opus
p^rygi^ni^um texer^.
that piece of the tapestrie he will weave with his own hand. How wonderfully
have thou wrought me, in the lowest parts of the earth; Psalm. 139.15. [rucamti]
as curiously as a cunning piece of tapestry is wrought, (...) In^^^^pere.
which the Seventy translate (...), how wonderfully have thou carved me out, in
the lower parts of the earth, that is, in my mothers belly; Deus est (...), or
statuarius, it is the Lord that made the mould, and the mothers belly is the
shop wherein he molded man below here; all that he made before he made man
(...) but assaies, or trials, but when he comes to make man, then he comes
to his consultation, Let us make man to our image, therefore he has a great
care that his life be not put out.

The second reason why man should not be killed, God made man to his own image
because he had no greater to make him by.
is because he is made to his image. When God swears He swears by
himself, because he has no greater to swear by, Hebr. 6.13. So when he
made man he made him to his own image: because he had no greater to make him
by. Phydias the painter painted the image of Minerva and his own image so
cunningly together, Simile. Phydias painted the image of Minerva with his own.
that he said, whosoever should mar the image of Minerva, should mar the
image of Phydias; and whosoever should mar the image of Phydias, should mar
the image of Minerva; so the Lord placed his image so cunningly in man, that
whosoever defaceth his image, defaceth the man; and whosoever kills the man
defaceth his image. Whatsoever is sealed with a seal, that is excellent in its
own kind, as Esaias 28.25. Hordeum signatum, that is excellent barley, when God
set his seal upon man, it shows that he was an excellent creature; there is
no Prince that will suffer his image to be abused.

There fell out a sedition at Antioch, because Theodosius the Emperor exacted
a new kind of tribute from the people; the people in a commotion break down
the image of the Empress Priscilla, Theodoret. lib. 5.
who was lately dead, and drew it through the streets; when the Emperor heard
of this, he was in a great rage, and sent his soldiers against the city to
sack it; as the soldiers were coming forward to sack the city, How
Macedonius the monk assuaged the wrath of Theodosius the Emperor.
one Macedonius a monk endued with heavenly wisdom, came out to meet him,
and said after this manner: Tell the Emperor these words, that he is not only
an Emperor, but also a man: therefore let him not look only to his Empire,
but also to himself; for he being a man commands also those that are men;
and let him not use men so barbarously, God is angry when he sees man his
image defaced.
who are made to the image of God; he is angry and that justly, that the brazen
image of his wife was thus contumeliously abused, and shall not the Emperor of
heaven be angry, to see his glorious image so contumeliously used; there is a
great difference betwixt this image of God, and this brazen image; for this one
brazen image we are able to to set up an hundred again, but he is not able
to make one hair of the heads of those, if he kill them. This being told the
Emperor, he suppressed his anger, and withdrew his forces. The Lord highly
esteems of this image in man; he made this the last of all his works, and
he had nothing now to make, but to make himself man; and upon this piece of
his work he set on his image as his Arms, and therefore no man should be so
bold as to deface it.



per concomitantiam, How the image of God is in the life of man, and the life
in the blood.
it accompanies it. First, the vital spirits are carried by the blood.
Secondly, the senses depend upon the vital spirits; and the reasonable soul
upon the senses, and the image of God is in the soul; take away the blood, the
spirits fail; take away the spirits, the senses fail; take away the senses,
the reasonable faculty fails; and take away the reasonable faculty, the image
of God fails in the man.

The image of God is in the soul tanquamin proprio subjecto, as in the proper
subject: it is in the body, Gods image is in the soul, body, and blood.
tanquam in organo, as in the organ, therefore the Apostle wills us to make
our members weapons of righteousness, Romans 6.19. And it is in the blood,
tanquan in copula, as in the bond, for the blood is that which coupleth the
soul and the body together.

How precious a thing is the life of man in the sight of God, Exodus 21.22. If
they follow no mischief, that is, The care that God has of the life of man
before he be borne.
if the child be not figured yet, as the Greek has it, or not a living soul
as yet, yet the striker was mulcted or amerced, and this was paid to the
husband; not only for the wrong done to the woman, but also for the wrong done
to that which should have been a child, although he was not as yet faetus
signatus: and when the child is borne, see what care the Lord has for the
safety and indemnity of his life; first he sets up a Magistrate to defend
him, and then he commands that the houses have battlements about them, that
he fall not over, and ditches to be covered, that he fall not in; and not
only commands he the man that kills to be killed, but the beast also that
kills a man, to be killed, and his flesh not to be eaten, Exodus 21.28.

The conclusion of this is: Conclusion.
man is made to the image of God, and whosoever kills a man shall dye for it,
Genesis 9.5. Surely your blood will I require at the hand of every beast, at the
hand of a man, and at the hand of every man's brother; after that the Lord had
said, I will not curse the ground any more for man's sake, although the
imaginations of his heart be evil always, and after that God was reconciled
to Noah, and smelled his sacrifice; yet he says, I will require the blood of
man, to teach us, that murder falls not under this remission, I will require
it at the hands of a beast; although it cannot sin, yet it shall be stoned to
death, and the flesh of it shall not be eaten, Exodus 21.28. No man is free from
punishment for murder. (...)
I will require it at the hand of a common man and of a great man, and I will
require it at the hands of a brother, so that no degree shall escape unpunished
for this sin, homo natura, vir dignitate, and frater cognatione: a man by
nature, a mighty man by his dignity, and a brother by neerenesse of blood.

EXERCITAT. II. Of unjust anger, or murder in the heart. Commandment. VI.
Matt. 5.22. Whosoever is angry with his brother, etc.
THere are sundry degrees of this murder before it come to the act; The
degrees of murder.
First, if a man be angry with his brother unjustly, and hate him without a
cause, then it is murder in the heart. Anger in it self is no sin, it is
cos virtutum, it is a whetstone to all the virtues, and the defect of it, is
called (...), when a man should be angry, and yet is not angry; but this anger
is a sin, when it anteverteth reason; Christ himself was angry, Matt. 21.12.
but his reason anteverted his anger. Ioh. 11.33. He troubled himself, his
reason stirred up his passions, Anger is a sin when it anteverteth reason.
(...), turbavit seipsum.
because reason stirred the passion and ruled it, it was just anger: but when
passion stirred reason, then it is unjust anger.

Secondly, when this anger is not moderated, then it is unjust anger, (...)
as Jonas anger was, cap. 4.9. I do well to be angry even unto the death. So
Moses anger; his passion blinded him so, that he speaks to God in the
feminine gender, Number. 11.15. [veim cacah at gnosheh li] If thou deal so with
me, kill me I pray thee.

Anger follows reason more then concupiscence, and concupiscence is more
brutish: when anger revengeth it self, it is sub ratione vindictae, but lust
has no regard to reason. This anger being exorbitant, is turned into sin,
Simile.
and the philosopher compares it to an hasty servant that runs away before he
get all the directions from his master; and unto a dog that barketh at his
master when he knockes at the door, before he know him; so anger when it
stays not to be directed by reason.

And thirdly, when it endures too long, then it is not just anger, Let not the
Sun go down upon your wrath. Ephesians. 4.26. and anger rests in the bosom of
fools. Eccl. 7.9.

There is nothing that a man is more tried in, then in his anger, the Hebrews
have a proverb, Bekis bekos, bekagnas, that is, a man is tried by his purse,
(...) in marsupio (...) in poculo. (...) in ira. He is o^ great strength that
is, long suffering.
by his cup, and by his anger: if he be soon angry, he is contrary to the
Lord who is slow to anger. Nahum. 1.3. The Lord is slow to anger, and [Gadol
coah] great in power. So Number. 14.17. And now I beseech thee, let the power of
my Lord be great, (...) Magnus virtute, id est, longanimis. (...) Longas
irarum, id est tardus ad iram, sic (...) brevis irarum, Pro. 14.17. id est,
praeceps ad iram.
according as thou have spoken, saying, the Lord is long suffering, and of
great mercy, and a man of this spirit is called a man of a cool spirit. Prove.
17.27. and Mat. 18.26. Produc super me spiritum tuum; that is, have patience,
and Erech Appaijm, one who has wide nostrils, Exodus 34.6. For he who has
narrow nostrils, commonly is of a hasty spirit.

So if he continue in his anger; there is nothing that a man is more ready to
keep then his wrath, and therefore the Hebrews put Servare, pro servare iram,
SERVARE pro servare iram.
as Ier. 3.5. Will he reserve for ever, that is, will he reserve his anger for
ever. Psalm. 103.9. Neither will he keep for ever, that is, he will not keep
his anger for ever. So Levit. 19.18. Thou shall not revenge [Velotittor] nor
keep, (...) non servabis, a (...) servavi^
that is, thou shall not keep thine anger against thy brother. Esau kept his
anger against his brother Jacob until the day of his fathers death. Genesis
27.41. and his posterity after him, who said, raze it, raze it, even to the
foundation thereof. Psalm. 127.7.

be angry, but sin not. Ephesians. 4.9.

Scriptura protonit absolute and si^^ condition quid ex Hypothesi intelligs
acts.
yet it is rather to be understood here conditionally; If ye be angry sin
not, so Psalm. 86.1. The Lord arises and his enemies will be scattered; that
is, if the Lord arise, his enemies will be scattered. So Verse 9. Thou O God
sentst a plentiful rain, and thou confirmedst thine inheritance, that is,
when thou sendest a plentiful rain, thy inheritance is confirmed.

How a man is to relieve his en ^ies Asle under the burden.
The virtue contrary to this continuing in anger, is to seek to be reconciled
to our neighbor. Exodus 23.5. If thou see the Ass of him that hates thee
lying under his burden and would forbear to help him; thou shall surely
help with him. The Chaldee paraphrast in his paraphrase has it this way; when
thou see the Ass of him that hates thee lying under the burden, Triplex
geminatio ejus them r^^. (...)
thou shall leave thine own business, thou shall leave the Ass with his
burden, and thou shall leave thine hatred, and be reconciled to thy neighbor;
and then thou shall learn to know quickly, what it is to help the Ass of him
that hates. So Christ, Mat. 5. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar and there
remembrest that thy brother has ought against thee, leave thy gift at the
Altar, and go and be reconciled to thy brother; so, leave the Ass for a
while, and first be reconciled to thy enemy: the Lords chief intention is
here of reconciliation, has God regard of Asses. 1. Cor. 9.9?

How murder shows it self in the eye.
Secondly, this murder comes to the eye; the hea^hen said, animus habitat in
oculis, the mind dwells in the eye; there is an evil eye, which is a
covetous eye. Prove. 23.6. Eat not the bread of him that has an evil eye, that
is, of a covetous eye; so there is an adulterous eye. 2. Pet. 2.14. And there
is an envious eye, Deuteronomy. 15.9. Take heed that thine eye be not evil against
thy brother; and there is a murdering eye, 1. Sam. 18.9. (...) scribitur cum
Vau and legitur (...) cum Iod (...) ab (...) immanis and (...) oculas.
And Saul eyed David from that day forward, Hebraice, he looked upon him with
an evil eye: So Job. 16.9. Mine enemy sharpeneth his eye upon me; these the
Greeks call (...), these who look fiercely.

Thirdly, How anger shows it self in the countenance.
this murder shows it self in the countenance, Genesis 4. Why is thy
countenance fallen, (...) Ira. Nasus.

Aph is called the nose, and it is called anger, because anger shows it self
in the nose, and so I take that place. Esaias. 2.22. Cease from man whose breath
is in his nostrils, that is, meddle not with Christ, who if his wrath he once
kindled, ye perish from the way. Psalm. 2.12. The breath to be in the nostrils
is commonly taken to be a sign of infirmity, because the breath shows it
self at the nose.

But it would seem here that it signifies infirmity, for the words following
imports infirmity, [Ki ba me] wherein is he to be esteemed?

The words should not be read Ba me, wherein, (...) in quo. (...) qui excels^s
reputatas est.
but [Bamme] excelsus in one word, because he is esteemed the high and mighty,
beware that ye anger him not, for he is the mighty God; and the words of the
next chapter following import this, For behold the Lord, the Lord of hosts
does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah, etc. this the Greeks call (...),
for (...) signifies supercilium contrahere, to frown as men do when they are
angry.

So it shows it self in the face, Levit. 17.10. Face put for anger.
I will set my face against that soul that eats blood; that is, mine anger.
So Genesis 32.20. I will appease thy face, that is, thy anger; and Lament. 4.16.
The face of the Lord has divided them. So Ier. 3.12. I will cause my face to
fall upon them, and 1. Pet. 3.12. The face of the Lord is upon them that do
evil, that is, his anger is upon them.

Anger shows it self in the face.
Fourthly, this anger shows it self by the foaming at the mouth, (...) Spuma.
Ira.

therefore the Hebrews mark, that Ketzeph is put both for foame and anger.
Esther 1.12. The King was very wroth, and his anger burnt within him; these the
Greeks call (...) who are angry until the foame stand at their mouth.

Anger shows it self in the teeth.
Fifthly, they express the anger of the heart with their teeth, when they gnash
with their teeth. Act. 7.5. (...), is properly to saw with a saw, because their
teeth go, as if they were sawing with a saw.

How the tongue murdereth.
Sixthly, to murder with the tongue; Ier. 18.18. Come let us smite him with the
tongue. The tongue is compared to a sword, The tongue compared to diverse
things.
and to an arrow; to a sword that kills comminus, near hand, and an arrow
that kills eminus, that is, afar off. Genesis 49.23. and to the sharpest sword
that is call sica, Psalm. 42.10. and to a razor, and to the Juniper coals that
burn most hotly. Ps. 120.4. and to a rod, Prove. 14.3. In the mouth of the
foolish is a rod of pride; that is, with his tongue he beats others. And
Hierom interprets that place, 1. Tim. 3.3. A minister must not be a striker,
that is, he must not rail with his tongue, and verse. 18. He must not be given
to wine, because when men are given to wine, they have no care of their tongue;
the Hebrews say that lingua continet pharmaca vitae and mortis, the tongue
has both the drugs of life and death, and mors and vita in manu linguae, death
and life are in the power of the tongue. Prove. 18.21.

Christ sets down the three sorts of punishments answerable to three sorts
of anger. The Scripture borrows comparisons from Ierusa em, Canaan, and the
places about it, to show the estate of the godly and the wicked.
Christ describing here three degrees of anger, sets down the punishment
answerable to them; and he alludeth to the punishments which were usual
amongst the Jews; it is the manner of the scriptures to borrow comparisons
from Canaan, Jerusalem, and the places about Jerusalem, to express the future
and blessed estate of heaven, anagogically; so by other places, to express the
pains of the damned in hell, as Tophet is called Gehenna; so the lake of
Sodom is called the torments of hell. Revelat 19.20. These were cast into the
lake of fire, burning with fire and brimstone. So Jude. 7. and here our Savior
Christ alludeth to the punishments that were amongst the Jews. The three
punishments here, and the three judicatories in Israel do not agree in every
thing.
But we must not make these three judicatories in Israel, and the three
punishments spoken of here to agree all together; for in the least judicatorie
in Israel they judged not of matters capital, of life and death, but in
matters of goods; but Christ says here, he that is angry with a man is worthy
of judgment, the judgment which Christ speaks of here, cannot be applied to
these judicatories that were in Israel: and there is a third sort of judgment
assigned here to Gehenna, but the Judges in Israel punished none in Gehenna,
only the idolatrous fathers burnt their children there to Moloch: we must
only then make the comparison this ways, as there were diverse sorts of
punishments amongst the Jews, some lesser and some greater; So in the life to
come, As there were greater and lesser punishments, for greater or lesser sins
in Israel so shall there be greater or lesser pains in hell.
there shall be smaller and greater pains and punishments, for smaller and
greater sins; and as the greatest torment amongst the Jews was the burning
of their children unto Moloch, so for the greatest sort of anger, there shall
be the greatest punishments in hell.

The second thing to be considered here, is the word Raca: Hebrew and Syriack
words, Why Raca is not interpreted in the new Testament.
usually are interpreted in the new Testament, but this word is not
interpreted; and the reasons are; First, because it was a word commonly used
amongst the Jews, convitium non acre sed familiare, a word which in familiar
speech the master used to the servant, as when he called him noddie or
witless body: So Judge. 9.4. (...)
Abimelech. hired vain and [Rekim] light persons, the Seventy translate it,
(...), viros inanes, hence come the Saracens from the Chaldee word Sarack,
(...) vacui cerebro, Rabince. (...) vacuum esse.
vacuum esse, men who lived by robbery and had nothing of their own, as ye
would say, empty men; they should not be called Saracens, from Sarah, for they
came of Hagar, they should be rather called Hagarens.

A second reason wherefore this word Raca is not interpreted, because there is
no fit word in our language whereby to express it; there are some Hebrew and
Greek words which cannot be fully expressed in our language. (...)
Example, Job. 39.30. Her young ones [legnalegnu dam] suck blood; but it is
better expressed by the sound, then translated, they glut-glut blood: So there
are some words in the new Testament that cannot be expressed well by
translation, (...) naso suspendo, subsannio, a (...) naris, nasus.
as (...). Gal. 6.7. signifies more then to mock, it signifies likewise to
fleere with the nose, and with the mouth; and it is an ironie in gesture, (...)
Impetus cum stridore, factu^ per onomatopaean ad imitationem soni literae r, ut
bmbo ex sono to b.
rather then in words. So 2 Pet. 3.10. The heavens shall go away (...) with a
great noise, it is more then a noise, it is such a noise as the sea makes in a
great storm.

The third thing to be marked here is that which Chrysostom observes; he who
is angry with his brother without a cause is guilty of judgment; therefore he
who is angry with his brother for a cause, is not guilty of judgment, and if
he have a just cause he may call his brother fool; Christ called his
Disciples fools, Luc. 24.25. To be angry for a just cause is no sin.
and so Paul called the Galatians foolish. Galat. 3.1.

The Papists argument to prove venial sins.
The church of Rome goes about to prove out of this place, that some sins are
venial, and some not; those sins are venial which deserve not hell fire,
but some sins deserve not hell fire, as when a man is angry with his brother
unadvisedly.

This fallacy is like to that which is propounded to boys in the schools.

That which thou boughtest in the market that did thou eat.

But thou boughtest raw flesh in the market.
Therefore thou did eat raw flesh.
The boy is taught to answer to this fallacy, that here they pass from the
substance in the proposition, to the accident in the assumption, from the flesh
to the rawnesse of the flesh, and then there are quatuor termini, four terms;
and so here they pass from the meanest degrees of the pains of hell, to the
highest degree; all sorts of sins are not punished in the highest degree of
punishment, as he that calls his brother fool, but yet all sorts of sins
are punished in hell with greater or lesser punishment.

The conclusion of this is; Prove. 4.23. Keep thy heart 15.19.

Secondly, as sins increase, so do the punishments.

EXERCITAT. III. De infanticidio, of the killing of an infant in the mothers
womb. Commandment VI.
Exodus 21.22. If men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
depart from her, and yet no mischief follow, he shall be surely punished, etc.
AS the world in the creation was first a confused mass, and then the Lord by
degrees distinguished the several days works; so does the Lord in the
creation of the little world man, The degrees of the forming of the child in
the mothers belly.
the first seven days is nothing but seed; Secondly, he is curdled: Job.
10.10. Have thou not powered me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? then
he becomes flesh, and is no more called seed, but faetus, a birth; Thirdly,
the principal parts of the body are fashioned, as the heart, the brain, and
the liver; and the rest of the members are not yet discerned: Fourthly, when
the arms, thighs, and the rest of the members are distinctly fashioned, then
it is no more called faetus, (...) puer a (...) movere.
but infans, Nagner, puer, from nagnar, movere, because he begins to stir
in his mothers belly, the 35 day, and then the child is septimestris, borne in
the seventh month, and none lives before that time: but if the foetus be
perfect the forty fifth day, then he begins to stir the nintieth day, and
his birth falls in the ninth month; but if the foetus be perfect in the
fiftieth day, then he begins to stir in the hundredth day, and he is borne
in the tenth month; so that doubling the perfection of the Embrio, (...) massa
rudis and intricata adhuc, neque in veram formam evoluta a (...) convolvit,
involvit.
which David called Golem. Psalm. 131.16. After all the parts are formed, then
the child begins to stir in the mothers belly, and tripling again the
motion of the child in the mothers belly, we shall know the time when the
child is borne. David speaks of these degrees how the child is fashioned in
the mothers belly. Psalm. 139.16. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being
unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
were fashioned, while as yet there was none of them.

This place is not rightly translated in the vulgar Latin.
Those words Exodus 21.22. are not rightly translated in the vulgar translation;
If men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her,
and she live, he shall be surely punished, their meaning is, that the man
shall be punished by a fine or mulct for striking of the woman if she abort;
but if she live, although the child die, yet the striker shall not die for it,
whereas the law means, if there follow [ason] damnum, (...) damnum, exitium
either to the mother or to the child, then the striker shall die; this place
then must be understood of a child formed, who has life in him; but if it be
but Embrio, or that which is called massa rudis, before all the members be
fashioned; then if she bring forth such a birth, he shall not die for it; the
Seventy translate it, (...) omnibus lineamentis ad exemplar formatum.
if her fruit depart from her (...), non signatum; and the Rabbines call it
asiman, which word they borrowed from the Greeks, as money not stamped or
sealed, (...) non signatum.
so is the Embrio before the soul be created in the body; and that word Ason
which is interpreted death, (...) virunculus qui con^picitur in nigredine oculi.
they seem to have read it ishon, as you would say virunculus, which the
Germans call Mannikin, or like the little man seen in the aple of the eye; as
if they would say, if the body be fully fashioned, and have all the members,
and be a little man, then he who strikes the mother, and makes her to abort,
shall die for it; but if the birth be not perfectly fashioned, and it be not a
mannikin, when the striker strikes the mother and she abort of such a birth,
he shall not dye for it.

When a man strikes a woman in the seventh month, he is rather to be judged
a murderer, than in the eight month, if she part with her child; for the
child which is borne in the eight month is commonly dead; Why rather to be
judged a murderer if he strike a woman in the seventh month, nor in the
eighth month after her conception.
and therefore the Greeks said (...), Zeta nota septenarij numeri apud
Graecos, (...), vive; Theta stands for the eight number, and being the first
letter of the word (...), it was the note of those who were condemned to dye:
he who is borne in the eighth month is called [Napal] abortivus, or deciduus
fructus, the child borne before the time, opposite to chordus, who is borne
after the time, such as those were called subgrundini, (...) abortus abortivu^
a (...) cadere.
because they were buried under the eves of the houses, and not reckoned as
living children to be buried amongst others. Allusion.
And Solomon alludeth to this Eccles. 6.3. He that has no burial, an
untimely birth is better then he; the reason why the infant lives who was
borne in the seventh month, Why the children borne in the seventh month live,
and not in the eight.
and not in the eighth, is this, because the infant in the seventh month
gathers all his strength together, turns himself, changes his place, and
seeks for a more commodious place; if if he be borne when the spirits are
wakned, and stirred up, he may live; and the child in the seventh month in his
mothers belly, is like unto a man, when he is sleeping in his bed, after his
first sleep he turns himself that he may lay himself more commodiously;
but if it fall out that he can sleep no more, then he arises and walks;
Simile.
but he does things more confusedly and indigestedly; but after that he has
turned himself, if he fall asleep again, then he sleeps more soundly,
and is more hardly wakned; so when the child is borne in the eighth month, his
spirits are diffused, and has no strength to help himself forth, but dies
in the birth; and therefore if a man strike a woman in the seventh month, and
she abort; there is more probability that he has killed a living child, then
if she had aborted in the eight month: for Octimestris lives not in the
birth, and it may be presupposed that the infant was dead at the time, the
mother bearing it in the eight month; so it was not the stroke of the striker
that made the child to die, but because it was in the eighth month, therefore
she brought forth this dead child. Great cruelty to kill the infant in the
mothers womb.


It is a great cruelty to kill the child in the mothers belly, to kill this
innocent in his first mansion, which should have been the place of his refuge;
(...) Secundine, a tranquillitate foetus a (...) tranquillum esse.
the tunicle in which he is wrapped in his mothers belly, is called Shilo,
because (as the Hebrews say) the young infant should live peaceably in it, in
his mothers womb, as in a place of refuge. When Benah, and Rehab killed
Ishboseth, David said, ye are wicked men who have killed a righteous person in
his own house, upon his own bed: shall I not require this at your hands? 2 Samuel 4.11. So the Lord will require at the hands of such killers, the blood of
infants.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
the Lord who forbids in his law to kill the kid when it is sucking the
damme, had a further intention here; for, does God regard kids, 1. Cor. 8.9?
but his chief intention is, that young infants may be saved, both when they
are in their mothers womb, and when they are sucking their breasts.

EXERCITAT. IV. DE 'AYTOPHONIA. Of selfe-murther. Commandment VI.
1. Sam. 31.4. Saul took a sword and fell upon it, and died.
ALl power which man has is of God, and the Lord has reserved the power of
death and life to himself, 1. Sam. 2.6. Deuteronomy. 32.19. God has reserved the
power of life and death to himself. Dominium Vtile. Supremum

He has not granted to man the power of his own life, he has made him
usufructuarium, and he has granted him dominium utile, but not supremum
dominium, not absolute and high dominion, as the Lord has given the earth to
the sons of men, Psalm. 115.16. he has granted utile dominium to them, but
not the supreme dominion, God has given the profitable dominion of the earth,
but not the supreme.
he has reserved that for himself: A man is lord over his natural and
moral actions. 1. Cor. 7.4. The wife has no power over her own body, but the
husband; before she was married she had the power over her own body to dispone
of it to her husband; but when she is married she has not that power; God has
put under man's feet, sheep, oxen, beasts of the field, the foul of the air,
and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the seas,
Psalm. 8.7, 8. those he may kill, because the Lord has given him power over
them to kill them for the maintenance of his life; but he is not Dominus vitae,
nes membrorum, he is not lord of his own life or of the least member of his
body; therefore he may not kill himself.

This self murder is contrary to the Law of nature, contrary to the divine
law, Self murder is contra-to nature.
and contrary to humane laws. First it is contrary to the law of nature, for
every thing seeks the preservation of it self; skin for skin, and all that a
man has will he give for his life, and nature abhors death as the last
enemy. 1. Cor. 15.

When a man may desire the separation of the soul from the body.
The soul and the body make up one person, and therefore they desire not to be
separated, neither should they desire, except it be for sin, as Paul said,
cupio dissolvi, I desire to be dissolved, Phil. 1.23. When the soul is out of
the body, it desires to be in the body. Revelat. 6.10. The body is called the
soul, because of the nere conjunction of them as Levit. 19.28. and 21.1. Hag.
2.14.
How long O Lord holy and true, do thou not judge and revenge our blood? The
souls call it their blood, because they long for their bodies again, and for
this it is, that the body when it is separated from the soul is called
[nephesh] the soul, why is the body called the soul? because it shall be
joined to the soul again as it was before, and the soul shall dwell in the
same body, this is therefore contrary to nature, for a man to make a separation
betwixt his own soul and his body.

Contrary to the law of God.
Again, it is contrary to the divine law, the Lord commands us to love our
neighbor as our self, but a man that kills himself cannot love himself.

Contrary to the law of man.
Thirdly, it is contrary to humane laws, and therefore they do as much as they
can to refrain it, because it takes away a member from the commonwealth, they
have made ordinances; that such be made open spectacles, and that they be not
buried in Christian burial, to restrain this sin.

It is not lawful for a man to kill himself for detestation of sins past, A
man is not to kill himself in detestation of sin past.
for this life is only the time of repentance, therefore the fathers defined
it thus, Est momentum unde pendet aeternitas, it is the moment upon which our
eternity hangs: and as those who are committed to prison, Simile.
must not break the prison at their own hand, until he who commits them
to prison command them to come out: Non enim poena vitatur furtiva discessione,
sed crescit, when a man breaks the prison he escheweth not the punishment by
flying, but increases it rather. Lucretia killed herself that she should not
be defiled by Tarquinius, but it had been no sin in her, if she had not
given her consent; for if a woman that is forced against her will should lose
her virginity, then chastity should not be reckoned amongst the gifts of the
mind, but only amongst the gifts of the body, as strength, beauty, and
health; therefore she was guilty of self murder. It is not lawful for a man
to kill himself to eschew sin to come, for we must not do evil that good
may come of it; it is not lawful for a man to cut the thread of his own life,
that he may enjoy life eternal, for God only determines the time of his
abode here, None may kill himself to enjoy eternal life.
and when he shall remove; and therefore the children of God have waited
always till the Lord should make the dissolution, Luc. 2.29. Now (...) let
thou thy servant depart in peace; in the Syriacke it is, now thou openest the
prison door; the prisoner must not go out until the prison be opened unto
him. Phil. 1.23. I desire to be dissolved.

The Stoics said, if a wise man were taken captive he might soon relieve
himself; The Stoickes held that a man might kill himself.
and if he thought not himself happy in bonds, he might quickly loose
himself: and Seneca said, Quamcunque venam nostri corporis, esse venam ad
libertatem: he meant that a man might open a vein, and let himself blood to
death: but it was better said of Plato, Ne dividas lignum in via, that is, take
not the soul from the body in the way here.

Sampson who killed himself.

As Sampson was a type of Christ in his conception, so was he in many of his
actions, and in his death; Gabriel the angel told Mary of her conception: so
did the angel tell Sampsons mother, Iud. 13.3. and as the angels name who came
to Mary was Gabriel, so the name of the angel who came to Sampsons mother was
Admirable; (...) Sol, add ad (...) et sic fit diminutivum (...) Solilus.
Sampson was a type of Christ in his name, he was called Shamshon, Solilus or
little Sun, so Christ is the Sun of righteousness, Malac. 4.2. He was a
type of Christ in his marriage: as he married with the Philistines, so Christ
married with the Gentiles; and Sampson killed more at his death then in life, so
did Christ. Sampson was directed by the Lords Spirit, Sampson in his death was
directed by the spirit of God.
in his marriage; Iud. 14.4. His father and his mother knew not that it was of
the Lord that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: as he was a snare
to the Philistines in his marriage, and directed by the Lord in it; so was he in
his death, he was directed by the spirit of the Lord in it: (...) Impulit,
agita^^ (...) Tintinnabulu^, sic dictum quod percussione personet,
in the original it is, [Pagnam] huc illuc impelli a Spiritu, Iud. 13.25. as
the bells which hung in the skirts of Aarons garments are called [Pagnamon]
because they were shaken to and fro.

Sampson desired to die with ihis enemies, but not that uncircumcised death.
But he desired to die with his enemies.

He desired not to die with his enemies that uncircumcised death, Psalm. 25.9.
Destroy not my soul with the wicked: and his last words may be taken rather as
a concession then a prayer: as a good captain had rather die, then that his
enemies should prevail; and the fathers reckoned him amongst the martyrs, for
he most willingly bare witness to the truth. Secondly, his testimony was
confirmed by his death, and it was for a divine and supernatural truth. And
lastly, for the glory of God; all which concurred in the death of Sampson,
Reasons proving that Sampson died in the favor of God.
and the Lord accepted of his prayer, and heard him when he dyed, and gave him
greater strength then before.

How could Sampson be a type of Christ, seeing he committed many great sins?

Many were types of Christ, but not in their sins. Tichonius in his rule set
down by Augustine, says, Ab his enim, vel removenda quoad significationem
istam, peccata; Men albeit they commit great sins, may be types of Christ.
vel ea in corporis christi (quod est Ecclesia) parts ac membra, quae peccatis
interdum contaminantur, transferenda, he means, that as types of Christ they
committed not those sins, but as members of the Church they sinned; and the
sins should not be transferred upon them as they were types of Christ, but as
they were members of the Church. A man's picture does not always represent the
man, Simile.
for sometimes the fault is in the wood; and sometimes in the stone, or paper,
and sometimes in the colors, and sometimes in the unskilfulnesse of the
painter; yet it is the picture of that man which it represents: so although
there be defects and wants in the types of Christ, yet they may be types of
him. Now if Sampson had been a self murderer, the Apostle would never have
reckoned him up amongst the faithful.

A man is bound by lawful means to seek the preservation of his life; the
Hebrews call this Vivificare, VIVIFICARE quid apud Hebraeos.
and notat actum continuum, non inchoatum, that is, it signifies the
preservation of life, but not the beginning of life, as Number. 22.33. I should
have killed thee, sed asinum vivificassem, that is, I should have kept the ass
alive. So Number. 37.15. Number vivificastis omnem foeminam? that is, have ye
preserved the women alive, So Luc. 17.34.

A man is guilty of self murder, when he spends the means prodigally which
should entertain his life; A man is a self murderer when he spends his
means that entertaines his life.
we have a natural life, and a spiritual life, the means which entertain
our natural life are called our life; When thou besiegest a town, thou shall
not cut down the fruitful trees, Arbor enim agri homo est, for the tree of
the field is man, Deuteronomy. 20.19. that is, it is the means which intertaines the
life of man. So Proverb. 27.27. Life put for the maintenance of the life.
It shall be life to thy maids, that is, maintenance. So in the Gospel it is
said, that the poor widow cast into the treasury (...), her whole life, that
is, her whole substance. Mark. 12.44. So the woman having an issue of blood
twelve years, spent her living upon the Physicians. Luc. 8.43. (...), her
whole life: So Eccles. 6.8. The poor walking before the living; mark the
opposition, Poor and living, for living and dead; the poor are judged as they
were dead civilly, because they want the comfortable means to entertain their
life; when men do prodigally waste the means which should entertain their
life, (...) ab a and (...) salvo, est vitium quando exceditur modus.
this the Greeks call (...), as if ye would say, non salvatio sui; such a one
was that forlorn son, Luke 15.13. Who wasted his substance with riotous
living, (...).

The life taken for the spiritual life.
Our life is also taken for our spiritual life, and when we have not the care
to entertain the grace of God in our selves, then we are said to be
murderers of our souls, and when we neglect the means of our salvation,
such as those, Number. 16.38. are called peccatores in animam suam, sinners
against their own soul; the life of the soul is a more excellent life, then
the life of the body; the life of nature is seated but in the blood, Vita est
in sanguine, the life is in the blood, Genesis 9. but our spiritual life is in
the blood of Christ: our natural life is entertained with corruptible things,
Thou shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them, for
thou may eat of them; and thou shall not cut them down, for the tree of the
field is man's life. Deuteronomy. 20.19. But our spiritual life is entertained by the
tree of life, Jesus Christ, therefore this life is called the life of God.
Ephesians. 4.18.

The Hebrews say, that the Ammonites and Moabites who drew the Israelites to
idolatry, and killed their souls, were punished unto the tenth generation,
that they should never enter into the Congregation: but the Edomites who killed
them with the sword, and the Egyptians who drowned them, were but punished to
the third generation.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
if it be a great sin to put out the life of another man, it is a greater sin
for a man to put out his own life, for he must love his neighbor as himself.

EXERCITAT. V. Of cruel murder. Commandment. VI.
Luc. 33.1. There were present at that season some that told him of the
Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
LEt us enquire here, first, why Pilate mingled the blood of the Galileans with
their sacrifices? Secondly, why they propound this question to Christ?

The occasion why Pilate mingled their blood with The cause why Pilate killed
the Galileans.
their sacrifices was this; when the Romans had subdued the Jews, they laid
grievous taxations upon them, and they sent their Publicans abroad daily to
exact of them, (...) Exactores. (...) collector tributorum a (...) colligere.
(...) Peccatores
and therefore they called them Nogeshim, exactores, in the Syriack, Gabbi,
collector tributorum, from the Syriack word Gabha, which signifies to gather
tribute or tole; they hated them so, that they called them sinners, and they
would not marry with them; therefore they said, ne contingat tibi uxor quae sit
aliqua e publicanis, and they would not eat with them, nor converse with them;
because the Publicans handled the Jews so hardly, they hated both them and the
Romans exceedingly; How Judas of Galilie drew people after him, and taught them
that that they should obey no King but God.
and one Judas of Galile, Act. 5.37. In the days of the taxation, rose up and
drew away much people after him; he taught those that followed him, that they
should acknowledge no other King but God, and that they should have no other
Lord but God himself; and he reasoned this ways, thou shall worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shall thou serve; therefore all civil honor is
forbidden to be given to Kings; not unlike to that conclusion of the Pope, the
spiritual man judges all things, and he is judged of none; therefore the Pope
and the clergy are exemted from all civil authority.

Augustus appointed a daily sacrifice for himself.
Philo in his book de legatione ad Caium, testifies, that Augustus upon his
own charges appointed a daily sacrifice for himself in the temple; and
Theophylactus writing upon Act. 5. shows that this Judas Galilaeus forbad
that any should sacrifice for the Emperor; Pilate when he saw these Galileans
(who were the followers of Judas Galilaeus) sacrificing, he came upon them and
killed them, and mingled their blood with their sacrifices; because they forbad
to sacrifice for Caesar. Some came and told Christ what Pilate had done to
these men, and they thought that these men were greater sinners then others,
for those who are cut off by the sword, men think that they are greater
sinners then others, and that they die not well; but a man may die a violent
death, and yet die in the favor of God; a sudden death is not always a bad
death, Jobs sons died suddenly, but to the wicked it is a bad death. Job. 34
20. and Josias was killed in the battle, A violent death not always a bad
death.
and yet the Lord says, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shall be
gathered to thy grave in peace. 2 King. 22.20.

Now for Pilates cruelty, The exaggeration of Pilates cruelty.
it may be exaggerated by many circumstances: First, who did it, when he did
it, where he did it; for actions are accounted either good or evil, not only
from the object and end, but also from the circumstances; for even as in the
natural body, it is not enough to be a perfect man, and want no member, but
also that he have color, proportion, and straightness, which do grace the
body: So an action is not good, unless all the circumstances concur; but it
is accounted as an evil action, if any circumstance be wanting; therefore
Thomas says well, Thom. 2.2. quaest. 3. ad 1.
Bonum non nisi ex integra causa constare, malum vero ex quocunque defectu
consurgere. When many circumstances concur in an evil action, they aggravate
the sin very much, as the Israelites, Ezekiel. 23.37. committed spiritual
adultery with their Idols, they sacrificed their children to Moloch; they
defiled the Sanctuary with blood, and they defiled it with blood upon the
Sabbath day. There were many circumstances to exaggerate Pilates fact; First,
that a Magistrate should kill so cruelly, this was (...) trucidare. Mat. 10.28.
Great cruelty in Pilate to kill those, he being a Magistrate.
and not (...) interficere. Secondly, the place exaggerates the fact, being
done in the temple. When Athaliah was to be killed, Iehojada the Priest
commanded to carry her forth without the ranges. 2 King. 11.15. that is,
without the precinct of the temple, he would not have her blood shed near the
temple to defile it, this murder came nearest to Zacharies murder, Great
cruelty to kill them in the temple.
who was killed betwixt the porch and the Altar, which was nearer to the
holiest of all then the Altar; he killed them in the temple publicly in the
sight of all men, Thomas says well, Occultatio peccati, quae est simplex
circumstantia peccati, diminuit and nou auget peccatum; tum quia signum
verecundiae, and qui manifest peccat, When the hiding of a sin diminishes sin.
cum agit, tum docet; that is, the hiding of the sin which is one
circumstance that concurreth in the sin, it does not aggravate the sin,
because it is a sign of shamefastness, and he that commits a sin
publicly, he both does it, and teaches others to do the like. Esaias. 3.9.
they proclaim their sins as Sodom, that is, they show them out and hide
them not. Sed quando occultatio peccati est causa peccati, non diminuit sed
auget and constituit novam speciem peccati, as it is in secret theft, fraud, or
deceit,

Thirdly, to kill them that were not under his jurisdiction; for the Galileans
were under the jurisdiction of Herod, so to kill them at the altar which was
the place of refuge, when they were now begging pardon for their sins, this
aggravateth the sin more.

Pilate was an heathen, and had no respect to the altar.

The heath^^ carried great reverence to the Altar.
See what reverence the heathen carried to the Altar, for when any person fled
to the Altar for refuge, they would never kill him there, if he refused to
come out from the Altar, Turnebi adversaria.
they would smoke him out, and if that would not serve the turn, they would
close him up in the temple that he might famish there, and that the heathen
had always a respect to the Altar of refuge, we may see it by the history of
Amyris.

Amyris being sent by the Sybarites to the oracle of Delphos, Sail^s in (...).
to consult how long their Commonwealth should stand; it was answered, that it
should continue ever until they reverenced man more then the gods; he seeing
one day a slave beaten by his master, and flying to the altar of refuge, yet
his master spared him not there; then the slave fled to the tomb of his
masters father, and then his master spared him; which when Amyris perceived,
presently he went and sold all that he had, and went and dwelt at Peloponesus;
for now I see, said he, that men are more reverenced then the gods. By this we
may see what regard the heathen had of old to the altars, and what a barbarous
cruelty was this in Pilate to kill these poor Galileans, when they were
sacrificing.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
that the Lord abhors all murder, but especially cruel murder, committed
openly in the sight of God and his people.

EXERCITAT. VI. How the Lord enquireth for blood and punishes it.
Commandment. VI.
Psalm. 9.12. When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them.
THe Lord enquireth for blood, God first enquireth for blood, and then
punishes it.
and then revengeth it. First, he enquireth for blood: Genesis 4.9. And the Lord
said unto Cain, where is Abel thy brother? So Genesis 42.22 Behold now his blood
is required at our hands. (...) quaesivit sciscitatas, percunctatus est.
Daresh, est summo judicio inquirere, to search diligently.

The Lord requires this blood, God requires the blood of man from reasonable,
unreasonable, and senseless creatures.
at the stones and timber of the house. Habak. 2.11. and at the hands of a
beast, Genesis 5.9. and at the hands of a man, that is, of a common man, and at
the hands of a great man, and at the hands of a man's brother: and he enquireth
after the blood, from the shedder of the blood, to the author or first cause;
there was the hand of the Ammonite that killed Vriah; God searches out blood
from the shedder to the first inventer.
there was the hand of Ioab that set him in the forefront of the battle, and
there was the hand of David that invented this: yet Nathan passed by them all,
and said to David, Thou have killed Vriah the Hittite with the sword. 2 Samuel
12.9. So there were the false witnesses who testified against Naboth and stoned
him, and the false Judges who condemned him, and then Iezabel the Queen, and
last the King, who sealed all with his signet: and yet it is said, that Ahab
killed him. 1 King. 21.19. Have thou killed and taken possession? The Lord
says, Number. 32.23. Your sins shall find you out; The guilt of sin leaves
such a scent behind it, that the punishment follows it and finds it out,
even as the dog by the scent finds out the Hare, and as the hew and cry
follows the murderer; How a man's sin finds him out. (...) cubavit,
excubavit, proprie bestiarum est.
so does the revenging hand of God follow the sin of murder home to the door
of him that committed it. Genesis 4.7. Sin [Robhetz] lies at the door, that is,
the guilt of sin, as a mastive dog lies at the door. Deuteronomy. 31.17. Many evils
and troubles shall find them; man finds out sin first, and sin finds
him out again. And see how the senseless creatures discover the blood and
enquire after it; Job says, Let not the earth cover my blood. Cap. 16.18. When
sense is given to heaven and earth, then the Lord signifies by this, Why is
sense attributed to senseless creatures.
that this sin is such, that it inverteth the nature of the senseless
creatures settled by God: and therefore they seek to be revenged of this
sin, and cry out for a vengeance, which is spoken of such sins in the
Scriptures which must presently be punished without any delay.

As the Lord searches and enquireth for the blood, so he revengeth it, God
revengeth blood when he has searched it out.
when Zachariah was killed betwixt the porch and the altar, what said he? The
Lord look upon it, and require it. 2 Chronicles. 24. and the Lord answered to his
request, Luc. 11.51. How he revenged the blood of Zachariah.
I say unto you it shall be required. A year was scarcely past when the Princes
who condiscended to this bloody murder, were all killed by the Assyrians, and
the King himself was wounded, and there he died; see how the Lord revenged
this blood.

And we see this more evidently in David. 2 Samuel 12.9.10. Because thou have
slain Vriah the Hittite, How the Lord revenged the blood of Vriah upon David
and his posterity
with the sword of the Ammonite, the sword shall never depart from thy house;
which was performed, first, in the slaughter of his son Ammon; secondly, of
Absolon: thirdly, in Adonijah; then in the five sons of Iehosaphat. 2 Chronicles.
21. And of all the sons of Ioram except Achazia who was also killed by the
King of Iezreel. 2. Chron. 22. And Athalia killed all the Kings seed except
Ioas, who was also killed afterward by his servants. 2 Chronicles. 24. and his
son Amaziah was killed, 2 Chronicles. 25.27. and Josias was killed in the battle,
2 Chronicles. 35.23. and lastly, the sons of Zedekias killed by Nebuchadnezzar, 2.
King. 25.7. see how the sword never departed from his house.

Secondly, God makes the conscience of man to revenge the blood that he has
shed.
the Lord makes the conscience to be vindex sanguinis, the revenger of the
blood; for when a man has once committed this sin, how fearfully does his
conscience torment him? When Ioab wrote to David that Vriah was killed at
Rabba, David thought but lightly of the matter at the first, what wrote he
back to Ioab? Let not this matter trouble thee, for the sword devoureth the one
as well as the other. 2 Samuel 11.25. But see how this matter troubled him after
his conscience was wakened, then he said that this blood was always before
him. Psalm. 51.3. it is verbum forense, always standing up in his face, and
pleading against him; and he prayed, (...) a sanguinibus.
that the Lord would deliver him; [Middamim] from bloods in the plural number,
to signify the greatness of this sin; or because he was not only guilty of
the blood of Vrijah, Blood a great sting to the conscience.
but also of those who were killed with him. Abigail when she dissuaded David
from killing of Nabal, 2. Sam. 25.31. she said, That this would be no grief
to David, (...) non crit titubationi aut offenfioni cordi.
nor offense of heart to my Lord, in the original it is, [Lepukah alemicshol]
it shall be no staggering or stumbling; the conscience is offended at the
remembrance of the shedding of innocent blood, as when a man dasheth his foot
against a stone. David when he remembered this, would not drink of the water
which was gotten out of the well of Bethleem by the hazard of the blood of men;
see what difference is between the conscience wakened and not wakened, and how
little David esteemed of shedding of blood in the first case, and how much in
the second.

The souls departed desire their blood to be revenged.
Thirdly, the souls of those who have been murdered, cry from the heavens for
a vengeance upon those who have murdered them. Rev. 6.10. How long Lord holy
and true, do thou not judge and revenge our blood upon those that dwell upon
the earth? this crying of the souls is not from sinful passion, Absolute
desires without sin shall be granted.
as the Apostles desired that fire might come from heaven and burn the
Samaritans, Luc. 9.54. but this desire of the glorified souls is without
sin; and all desires without sin, which are absolute desires, must be
fulfilled; I say absolute desires, because Christ desired without sin that
the cup might pass from him, but it was not an absolute, but a conditional
desire: but absolute desires must be fullfilled; this is one of the grounds of
the resurrection, because the souls now without sin, A ground of our
resurrection.
do long to be joined to their bodies again, therefore it must be granted to
them.

The conclusion of this is, let us pray with David to keep us from blood, and
let us study to wash our hands in innocence, that we may compass the Lords
altar, Psalm. 26.6. and that the Lord would not gather our life with bloody men,
verse. 9.

EXERCITAT. VII. De inculpata tutela, How a man may lawfully defend himself.
Commandment. VI.
Exodus 21.2. If a theife be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
there shall be no blood shed for him, if the Sun be risen upon him there
shall be blood shed for him.
WE have spoken of unlawful killing, which is murder; now it remains to
speak of lawful killing, and the first branch of this is, inculpata tutela,
and the second is casual slaughter.

God commands that a man should not kill his neighbor; and secondly, that he
should preserve himself; First, that he should not hurt his neighbor.

Man is considered six manner of ways. First, Man is considered six ways.
as he is a Christian; secondly, as he is a Magistrate; thirdly, as he is a
Soldier; fourthly, as he is a Citizen; fifthly, as he is a Moralist; and
lastly, as he is the work of nature.

In his first estate he is considered as a Christian, As a Christian how he is
to behave himself.
and then he must lay aside all hatred: it is natural for a man to love his
friend, and it is natural to him in his corrupt estate to hate his enemy: but
it is a work of grace when a man pardons injuries done unto him. The Lord
commended Solomon much for this, That he sought not the life of his enemies,
1. King. 3.11.

(...) a Magistrate.
Secondly, man is considered as a Magistrate, and then, He bears not the
sword in vain, Romans 13.6. but he must remember that it is gladius Dei, and
Gideon^: the sword of the Lord and of Gideon, Judge. 7.20. and he is the Lords
sword bearer: his part is to institute good laws, and put them in execution for
punishing of transgressors.

As a Soldier.
Thirdly, a man is considered as he is a Soldier, and then he is reputed to
be without honor, if he fight not for the welfare of his own country, and
seek not to repair the wrongs done unto it.

As a Citizen.
Fourthly he is considered as a Citizen, and here he is bound to seek
redress of his wrongs by the law, and not to revenge himself.

As a Moralist.
Fifthly, he is considered as a Moralist, then it is more honorable for him to
overcome his passions, than for him to overcome a strong city, Prove. 16.32. and
in this consideration he should be more careful not to do a wrong, then not
to receive a wrong.

As the work of nature.
Sixthly, he is considered as the work of nature, and then he should be
farthest from revenge;

Let us consider how nature brings forth a man, and that will teach him to
do no wrong to his neighbor: the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. takes an argument from
nature, Does not nature teach you that it is unseemely for a woman to be
shaven? So nature teaches a man in his first creation and birth to be a
peaceable creature, because she brings him forth without weapons.



that which nature affords not to a man for his preservation, art must help
it. Example, Nature seeks help from nature to defend it self.
nature brings forth a man naked, now because of the injury of the weather,
and the uncomelinesse of the body since the fall, nature seeks art to help
her, to make clothes for a man to cover his nakedness, and to defend himself
from the injury of the weather; so does it for weapons defensive, but never for
offensive in the first place: the hand of man is given to him for the safety of
himself, but not to wrong his enemy, 1. Sam. 25.26. (...) Servavit manum tuam
tibi.
Servavit manum tuam tibi, He has reserved thy hand to thy self: not that
thou should kill Nabal with it, but that thou should defend thy self
from Saul, who is pursuing thee to take thy life.

When men use their strength to wrong one another, see how the holy Ghost
speaks of them, Dan 11.40. When he describes the combat betwixt the king of
the South, and the king of the North, he brings them fighting like two
beasts, ARIET ARE quid. (...) petijt, impetijt cornibus, proprie de arietibus
dictum.
and they are said [arietare] to push with their horns like two rams: when men
go this way to kill one another, abusing their natural strength, they are
like unto beasts which push at others, and therefore in this case, Let him not
beast who puts on the harness, as he who puts it off, 1. King. 20.11.

Secondly, a man is to defend himself: and in necessity the Lord makes him a
Magistrate: and as in necessity all things are common for the safety of the
life of man, A man in necessity is a magistrate to defend himself.
that a man may go to his neighbors vineyard, or his field, and eat so much
as will satisfy his hunger; so in necessity the Lord makes a man a Magistrate
to defend himself, when he can have no other means to save himself. And
here we must put a difference betwixt him, qui infert injuriam, and qui
propulsat injuriam, he must defend himself, but not wrong his enemy, that
must be his chief intention: and a second intention, if he can have no other
means to save himself, then he becomes a Magistrate in that case: and he
must take heed here first, that he seek not revenge; A man must not seek
revenge.
for, Vengeance is mine, says the Lord, Romans 12.9. therefore David says, The
Lord avenge me of thee, but mine hand shall not be upon thee, 1 Samuel 24.12. So
Prove. 20.22. Say not I will do to him as he has done to me, Ier. 50.15. Take
vengeance on her, as she has done, so do thou to her, here the Prophet leaves
the revenge to God.

Sampson said, As they have done unto me so have I done unto them, Iud. 15.11.
therefore men may revenge themselves upon others, who have wronged then.

bears not the sword in vain, Romans 13.4. and those who revenge their wrongs
heroico instinctu, as Phinheas, Sampson, and Ehud; from those who follow their
own particular revenge, for They know not of what spirit they are, Luc. 9.55.

What a man must do before kill or be killed.
Before a man be brought to this necessity either to kill or be killed: first
he is to flee, and secondly to defend himself by all means possible, but not
to pursue, if he be rid of his enemy.

Navarrus E. 15. 4. Soto ar^. 8. 9. 5. d d. in l. ut vim. etc.
First, he is to fly, Matt. 10.23. But when they persecute you in this city,
flee ye into another, therefore that tenent of Navarrus is most false, cadem
recte admitti putat ut alapa vitetur, and ad honorem recuperandum; and Soto,
defensio cum intersectione est licita, quia fuga est ignominiosa.

(...) (...) ^imite cum in sorib^s id est, si^^ite cum extra s^pta, ne
ingressus irritat in me.
As he is bound to flee to defend himself, so he is bound to hold off the
injury: when Iehoram King of Israel sent a man to take Elisha, Elisha said;
Shut the door, and hold him fast, at the door, 2. King. 6.23. it is not well
translated, Handle him roughly, he was only to save himself here.

Now when he has used all other means, and cannot save his life otherwise;
(...) Si in effossione, vel cum effossionis instrumento
then necessity in that case makes him a magistrate. If a thief be found
breaking up, and be smitten that he die, Exodus 22.2. if he be found breaking
up, [ im bammahhthereth, Lex 12. tabularum vetat furem diurnum occidi nisi telo
se defendat
] but it is better translated, cum perfossionis instrumento, if he come with
an instrument in his hand to break up the house, now in such a case the Lord
says, if he be killed, then he who killed him was free of his blood; because
it was in the night time, and there was none to help him; and it could not be
known whether he came to rob or to kill; when David came to seek support of
Nabal, he gave him a churlish answer, and said, That many men now a days
break from their masters, 1. Sam. 25.10. but Abigail says of David, A man
fights the Lords battle when he defends himself.
that he fights the battles of the Lord, verse. 28. what battles of the Lord
had he fought? he was not entered into the kingdom, he only defended
himself in fleeing from Saul, and this Abigail called a just defense, and
says that he did fight the battle of the Lord.

When Christ sent his Disciples abroad in their first expedition, he forbad
them to take a staff with them, Matt. 10.10. that is, such a staff as might
hinder them in their way, but take only a light rod with them, no staff of
defense: but when he sent them forth afterward, he says, He that has not a
sword, let him sell his garment and buy one, Luc. 22.36. and the Apostles seem
to have carried swords in their defense, and although these words contained not
a precept, The Apostles carried weapons to defend themselves. (...), Sira vel
gladius.
yet they are taken from the common custom, as the opposition of the former
times implies; and this sword (or if ye will translate it, a sacrificing
knife, as some do) they were to use only in defense of themselves, and not to
wrong others, and therefore Peter when he smote off Malchus ear, Christ said
to him, Put up thy sword in his place, for all they that take the sword shall
perish with the sword, Matt. 26.52.

Esaias. 2.4. They shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears
into pruning books; therefore it may seem that under the Gospel, men may not
use a defensive weapon.



Matt. 5.39. Resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on the right
cheek, turn to him the other also: and if any man will sue thee at the law,
and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also: Therefore it may seem
that it is not lawful for a Christian to defend himself.

How these words, Mat. 5.39. are to be understood.
There is no place in the Scripture which has been more mistaken then this:
Julian the Apostate abused this Scripture, when he would box the Christians
upon the one cheek, he would bid them hold up the other also; but Christ in
this place is not speaking of every sort of injury, but of light injuries, such
as are a box, or a blow, or loosing of a coat, or cloak; he takes not away
all judicatories here; his meaning is only that we should be patient in
lighter offenses and wrongs, and to remit something of our right in such things
as we may recover, We may remit something of our right, for keeping of peace.
and not to stand punctually in every thing, this is that which the Gospel
teaches. So to go two miles with a man if he compel thee, but not an
hundred: so not to stand for a coat or a cloak; but if a man should take all
that thou have from thee, then thou art to resist him, and seek remedy by
order of law. So the words following, give to him that asks thee, and from
him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away, verse. 42. We should be
patient in suffering of injuries.
if these words should be extended to the farthest, there were nothing more
hard, and it would be contrary to that, 2. Cor. 8.13. For I mean not that
other men be eased, and ye burdened. When he bids them hold up the other
cheek, it is not meant literally here, but his meaning is, that they should be
patiene in suffering of injuries, Lam. 3.30. Christ suffered patiently, yet
held not up the other cheek when he was smitten.
He gives his cheeks to him that smites him; that is, he suffers
patiently. Christ himself when he was smitten, did not hold up the other
cheek, but said, Why smitest thou me? Ioh. 18.23. therefore the words are not
to be taken literally, but are to be understood that we should carry a
Christian heart, ready to forgive, and not to prosecute all injuries, and to
remit something of our own right at sometimes for the Gospels sake. They say
in the Schools, Moral virtues may suffer extention.
that Virtus moralis non consistit in puncto mathematico, but habet suam
latitudinem; it may be farther extended: so when those Christian virtues are
required, they are not so required that they suffer no sort of extention; ye
may spare your cloak, or your coat, but if they would spoil you of all, ye
are not to yield to that: Paul forbids the Corinthians to go before Heathen
judges to plead; but yet Paul being enforced, appealed to Caesar. The Gospel
takes not away lawful means of defense.
So that the Gospel takes not away lawful means from a man to defend
himself, but only shows when, and how he should use those means, and how
he should forbear to seek to be repaired of light injuries.

Romans 12.19. Avenge not your selves:

When he forbids them (...), to avenge themselves, he forbids them not
to defend themselves, God forbids to revenge, but not to defend
and the words going before show this, Requite not evil for evil; this is the
description of unlawful revenge, and not of lawful defense, and he gives
the reason, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, says the Lord; and Christ
says, Shall not God avenge his own elect? Luke 18.7.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is. Necessity armeth a man to defend himself, but not
to kill his neighbor, this is called Gravis necessitas, Necessitas Extrema.
Gravis.

but if it be extrema necessitas, then he is armed, not only with defensive,
but also offensive weapons: but many men extend this necessity too far, when
it is neither extrema necessitas, nor gravis necessitas.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of casual slaughter, and who were admitted to the city of
refuge. Commandment. VI.
2 Samuel 14.4. And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the King, she fell on her
face etc.
THe sixth Commandment commands to cut off the guilty murderer, so it
appointed cities of refuge for casual slaughter, or for those who in sudden
passion had killed a man, such were sheltered in the city of refuge; but the
voluntary or wilful murderer was not sheltered in the city of refuge.

Agere Ignoranter. Ex ignorantia.

We must put a difference betwixt these two, agere ex ignorantia, and agere
ignoranter, to do a thing of ignorance, and to do a thing ignorantly: to do
a thing ignorantly is to do a thing that we are ignorant when we are in
doing of it; but yet ignorance is not the proper cause why we do it, but some
other bad accident which draws on the ignorance, as Lot when he lay with his
daughters, here he did it ignorantly, but yet his ignorance was not the cause
of his sin, but his drunkenness which drew on his ignorance: but he is said
to do a thing through ignorance, when his ignorance is the chief and the
principal cause of his action, as when a man was felling wood, his axe head
flees off and kills a man; here he kills a man of ignorance, this
ignorance is the chief and principal cause of the action; it was not
accersita ignorantia, Ignorantia Accersita. Simplex.

sed simplex ignorantia, he drew not on this ignorance, but it was simple
ignorance, he that killed a man of ignorance was admitted to the city of
refuge, but not he who killed a man ignorantly.

There are three sorts of actions of men; (...).
the first are done deliberately, the second in sudden passion, the third by
chance; the first are violent injuries and wrongs, (...).
and these were not protected in the cities of refuge; the second were the
actions which were done in sudden passion, and these were admitted to the
cities of refuge; as the woman of Tekoahs two sons went to the field, and the
one of them killed the other upon a sudden, and the woman said unto the King,
Remember the Lord. 2 Samuel 14. that is, the law of the Lord, that has appointed
cities of refuge to protect such, that the revenger of blood kill them not. The
third were casual actions, when a man was killed by chance; as they who kill
unawares, and unwittingly. Josh. 20.3. and these were admitted to the cities of
refuge.

Men do things either voluntary willingly, invite against their will; ex
part invite, or non invite. First, when one commits murder willingly, then
he was not admitted to the city of refuge. Secondly, Agere Voluntary. Invite.
Ex part invite. Non invite.

when he killed invite, against his will, then he was admitted to the city of
refuge, because this was ignorantia invincibilis, inevitable ignorance; as if a
man had been f^lling wood, and his axe head had flowne off and killed a man.
Thirdly, ex part invite agere, as when a man in sudden passion had killed his
neighbor, and he was admitted to the city of refuge. Fourthly, non invite
agere, this comes ex ignorantia concomitante. Example, Mutius Saevola
intended to kill the King, he missed the King, and killed another in steed of
him, and when it was told him, he was sorry that he had not killed the King,
he did not this ex ignorantia antecedente, sed ex ignorantia concomitante, and
the fact was not involuntarium, he did it not invitus, but non invite; and such
a man was not admitted to the city of refuge.

A man kills three ways.
A man kills three manner of ways; First, when the heart kills and not the
hand; Secondly, when the hand kills and not the heart; and thirdly, when the
heart and the hand kills. When the heart kills and not the hand, that
comes not to be tried before men, when the hand kills but not the heart,
these were admitted to the cities of refuge; and thirdly, when both the heart
and the hand killed, and those were not admitted to the cities of refuge.

Exodus 21.12. He that smites a man that he die, shall be surely put to death;
that is, if he smite him willingly, he was not protected in the city of
refuge; the vulgar translation translateth it, qui percusserit hominem velens
occidere, morte morietur, what means he by this, volens occidere, willing to
kill? does he mean this? be that strikes a man not casually, but willing to
kill him? or means he this? he who strikes a man, willing to hurt him but
not to kill him, and in the mean time he kill him; does the law here consider
the purpose and intention of the killer only? no, but the law considers here
effectum, non affectum, the effect, and not his affection; whether he had a
purpose to kill him or not to kill him, if he kill him, he is a murderer. Some
do kill, and intend not to kill; some intend to strike and not to kill, and
yet do kill; and thirdly, some intend to kill, and yet kill not; none of these
were admitted to the city of refuge.

These who killed of ignorance were admitted to the cities of refuge, with
sundry caveats. The caveats with which a man was admitted to the city of
refuge.


The first caveat was this, that they behoved to be in King. 4. one of them
gathered colloquintida, or some poysonable herb, and put it in the pot; now if
he had poisoned some of his fellows through ignorance, he had been protected
in the city of refuge, Ignorance excuses a man, who is in a lawful calling.
because he was in a lawful action; but if he should have ignorantly killed a
man in an unlawful action, then this ignorance should not have excused him.
Example, if a man had stricken a woman with child not knowing that she was
with child, and the child had died, he would not have been protected in the
city of refuge, because he was in an unlawful action: So if he had bin in an
unprofitable action, as if he had been mowing grass upon the house top.
Psalm. 129.29. and a stone had fallen down and killed a man, this ignorance
would not have excused him, because he was in an unprofitable action, for men
use not to mow grass upon the house top: So if he had killed a man
ignorantly in his sport or pastime, res licita and seria casum excusat, res
vero illicita and jocosa casum atrociorem reddit. When a man is about a lawful
action or earnest business, he is excused if he kill casually, but if he be
in sport or about trifles, then he is not excused.

debita advertentia, if the axe head had usually flowne off before, and he had
killed a man, then he was not protected in the city of refuge, because he
had not used all means possible to make the head of the axe fast; the like we
see in the pushing ox. Exodus 21. If the ox used to push, and his master kept
him not within the house, and then if he kill a man, his master was to die for
it, and the city of refuge saved him not.

Lapis manus quid apud Hebrac^.
then he was to die: So if he smote him with a stone of the hand. 2. King.
9.24. Implevit mauum arc^.
Number. 35.17. that is, with a stone that fills the hand, as Rabbi Solomon
interprets it; not with a little stone; so if he smite him with a weapon of
wood, and there is a greater restriction of wood then of iron.



The Lord Deuteronomy. 19.9. promised to them, Three cities on each side of Jordan.
when he should enlarge their bonds, he would give them more cities of refuge;
this promise was made to them when they were on the west side of Jordan, before
they came over the river; they had three cities assigned to them already, on
the east side of Jordan, and he was to appoint other three more for them in the
west side of Jordan; in all, there were but six.

It may be asked, Jordan; seeing there were but two tribes and an half upon
the east side, and all the rest upon the west side, the one was much more
spacious then the other?

Although that which was on the west of Jordan was more large in breadth then
the east side, Why there were as many cities on the east side, as on the west
side of Jordan.
yet in length they were equal; therefore he appointed as many cities upon the
east side as upon the west: and there may be another reason assigned, why he
appointed as many cities on the east side as on the west, because those who
dwelt in the east side of Jordan were farthest from the Temple, and the means
of Gods worship; and therefore were more cruel, and readier to shed blood (as
borderers are) and to obviate this; the Lord appointed three cities of refuge,
on the east side of Jordan.

These cities of refuge were appointed to save the man-killer from the revenger
of the blood; and that they might have the safer passage to these cities of
refuge, the hie ways were made plain, the hills demolished, and the hollow
places filled up, and bridges made for them to pass the rivers, and there was
an equal distance betwixt them, and they were situated upon the tops of the
hills; and they set up (as the Hebrews say) statuas mercuriales, (...)

images by the way, having this inscription upon them [Micklat] and the hand
pointing to the city of refuge; and John the Baptist alludeth to this form,
when he says, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Mat.
3.3. Christ is the city of refuge for all poor and ignorant sinners, and the
Preachers are statuae mercuriales, who point out this way to the city of
refuge, and sends them to the death of Jesus Christ the high Priest. See
Esaias. 40.3, 4.

Why were they commanded to stay in the city of refuge, until the death of
the high Priest? Mat. 15.19. Why then were these who casually killed, confined
within the city of refuge?

This was enjoined to them rather as a punishment of their former sins, and
likewise to teach them, Why the manslayer was kept in the city of refuge
until the death of the high Priest.
that Jesus Christ hehoved to purge both their sins of ignorance, and sins
of error; and we may see that this was but a ceremonial law, foreshadowing
some other thing to come; for if a man had killed another twenty years before
the death of the high Priest, or a day before his death, yet both were released
alike at the day of his death; if ye will respect justice in it self, they
should not have been equally punished, and both should not have been confined
a like time in the city of refuge; but this was to teach them, that Christ's
death relieved all sorts of sinners, and as the high Priest was a type of
Christ in his person, in his apparel, in his sacrificing; so was he in his
death.

Both Jews and Proselytes strangers were admitted to the city of refuge. Number.
35.25. What strangers were admitted to the city of refuge.
These six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel, and for
the stranger, and for the sojourner among them. There were two sorts of
strangers amongst them; First, he that was newly converted to the Jewish
religion, and he was [Ger] and the Seventy translate it, (...), a Proselyte.
(...).
Secondly, the stranger who dwelt long among them, and he was [Toshebh] and the
Seventy translate it, (...), both these were admitted to the city of refuge;
but an heathen abiding in Gentilisme, such a stranger was not admitted to the
city of refuge.

There fell an accident in Switzerland, a Slatter was slatting a house, the
ladder breaks, and he falling down killed a man in the street; A case of
casual slaughter.
the man's son who was killed, pursued the slatter as the murderer of his
father; the Judge demanded whether there was any hatred betwixt him and his
father, or not? he answered, none that he knew of; whereupon the Judge would
have absolved the slatter, but the man being more instant for justice, the
Judge ordained that he should go up upon the top of the house, and the slatter
should stand under him, and then he should try, if he could kill the slatter,
casting himself down upon him; the young man answered, that he could not
hazard his life to kill the slatter, the Judge replied, no more would the
slatter have hazarded his life to kill your father, wherefore it was but a
casual fact in the slatter, and he being in his lawful calling should not die
for it, and if such a fact should have fallen out in Israel, the cities of
refuge should have protected him.

The woman of Tekoahs parable not rightly applied.
The woman of Tekoahs parable was not rightly applied here; for the widows two
sons went upon a sudden to the field, and killed one another; but Absalom
waited for his brothers death: Cities of refuge were appointed for those who of
ignorance killed, or in sudden passion, but not for those who killed in cold
blood, the Lord commanded to take such a one from the horns of the altar: And
Jonathan, the Chaldee Paraphrast paraphraseth it thus, although he be a
Priest, and serve at mine altar, thou shall take him from thence and kill him;
and Targum of Jerusalem, although he be the Priest which stands and serves
before me, thou shall take him from mine altar and kill him; therefore they
conclude, that cities of refuge protected none that were wilful murderers.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, that the life of man is a precious thing before God;
and in such a case of casual slaughter, or when in sudden passion one kills
another, ampliandi sunt favores (as the lawyer say) and in poenis benignior
interpretatio facienda, they should have the most favorable interpretation of
the law, they should have (...), legis, the mitigation of the law, and not
(...), the rigor of the law, and Christian laws should not be written with
blood, as were the laws of Draco.

EXERCITAT. IX. Whether the revenger of the blood was bound by the Law to kill
the manslayer, or was it a permission only? Commandment VI.
Number. 35.27. And [if] the revenger of blood find him without the borders of
the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer, he shall
not be guilty of blood.
IT is commonly holden, that this was only a permission, that the revenger of
the blood might kill the manslayer: but if we shall weigh the circumstances
well, set down in the text, we shall see that it is a commandment, and not a
permission: and that it was not only lawful to kill him, but that he was
bound to kill him, as a Judge is bound to kill malefactor: if he was found to
be guilty of murder, then he was given over into the hands of the revenger of
blood, and he killed him. Number. 35.2. Deuteronomy. 19.12. So if he was found
innocent, if the revenger of the blood did find him without his city of
refuge, he was bound also to kill him; this was not a permission to kill him,
as the law of divorce was permitted for the hardness of the peoples hearts;
but there is more here, a commandment is set to him, as a Magistrate, that he
should kill him; and as the Magistrate might take no bribe to let the murderer
go free; so might not the revenger of the blood take any satisfaction for him
that is fled to the city of refuge, The revenger of the blood might take no
satisfaction from the killer to let him go free.
that he should come out of it again, and dwell in the land, until the death
of the high Priest, Number. 35.32. and another reason is added, lest the land be
polluted for blood defiles the land, verse. 33. and this the Lord does both for
the greater detestation of the sin of blood, and that this might be a true
type of Jesus Christ; as there was no regresse for the killer to his own land,
but by the death of the high priest, so there is no regresse for us into
heaven, but by the death of Jesus Christ our high priest.



How the murder was expiated without the blood of the manslayer.
and the sin was pardoned in the type, by him, who prefigured Jesus Christ,
who truly takes away sin.

It was not a permission to kill the manslayer, but a precept.
Number. 35.19. The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer, and not,
he may slay him, or, it is permitted to him to slay him: so verse. 21. The
revenger of the blood shall slay him when he meets him; and so he shall
take no satisfaction for him, Deuteronomy. 19.12. If it had been permitted only to
the revenger of the blood to do this, then if he had found him without the
city of refuge, he might have spared him, or transacted with him for money;
but this was no ways lawful for him to do, therefore he might not spare
him, but was bound to kill him wheresoever he did find him, without the city
of refuge.

But he was an innocent man,

Although he was innocent of murder, Why the manslayer might be killed if he
was found out of the city of refuge.
which commanded him to stay still in the city of refuge, makes him guilty.
Shimei was pardoned of his sin, but under this condition, that he should not go
over the brook Kidron, 1. King. 2.37. but when he transgressed this
commandment, he was killed: so the man that killed casually, was pardoned
conditionally, if he had stayed in the city of refuge, but if he had gone out
of it, before the death of the high Priest, he was to die.

The conclusion of this is, if this blood which was shed casually polluted the
land of Canaan, wherein the 35.34. as it was Emmanuels land, Esaias. 8.8. much
more does innocent blood cruelly shed defile the land, and makes the Lord to
withdraw his presence from it.

There was no safety to those who were out of Rachabs house, nor no safety to

EXERCITAT. X. Why David, a man of blood, was forbidden to build the Temple.
Commandment VI
1. Chron. 22.8. Thou shall not build an house unto my name, because thou have
shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
WHen the Lord granted rest to David from all his enemies round about him, he
said to Nathan the Prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains, 2 Samuel 7.2. but God did not approve of this
his purpose to build the Temple: the first reason is, 2. Sam. 7.6. I have not
dwelt in any house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of
Egypt, Why God did not approve David's purpose to build the Temple.
even unto this day: but I have walked in a Tabernacle. So. 1. Chron. 17.4, 5,
6. neither did God take this in an evil part, neither found he fault with any
of the Princes of Israel for this, 2 Samuel 7.7. In all the places where I have
walked with the Children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of
the children of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying; why
build ye not an house of cedar to me? but 2. Chron. 22.8. there is another
reason given why the Lord will not have David to build the temple, because Thou
have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars, therefore thou shall
not build an house to me. And Solomon, when he wrote to Hiram, 1. King. 5.3.
Thou know that David my father could not build an house to the Lord, for the
wars that were about on every side.

It may seem strange, why the Lord should never have desired a house to be
builded unto him, but always delighted in tents since he came out of Egypt;
how comes it afterward, that the Lord expostulateth so with them, that they
builded not his house, and that it lay so long unprepared. But the second
reason seems more strange, thou shall not build a house to me, because thou
have been a man of blood; What blood is meant here when David is called a man
of blood.
what blood is meant of here? means he of the blood of Vriah, which David
shed, or the blood of the Priests which was shed at Nob, whereof he was the
occasion? 1 Samuel 22.8. by blood here is meant that blood which he shed in the
wars: Thou have shed much blood in my sight; that is, at my commandment,
which Abigail touches, CORAM DEO, quid in sacro sermon.
1. Sam. 25.28. dissuading David from killing of her husband Nabal, For the
Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house, because my Lord fights the
battles of the Lord, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days: as
if she should say, the wars which thou have undertaken, God himself is the
chief captain in them: How then could the shedding of blood so stain David,
that he could not build a Temple to the Lord? The shedding the blood of the
enemies of God is most acceptable to God.
for as Theodoret observes well, the shedding the blood of the enemies of God,
was most acceptable to him, Esaias, 34.6. when the Levites killed their brethren
who committed idolarrie; Moses says, Consecrate your selves to day to the
Lord, every man upon his son, and upon his brother, Exodus 32.29. Allusion.
where there is a clear allusion to the consecration of Priests, and the
Priests that day when they were consecrate, the blood was put upon their
thumb, and their toe, Exodus 29.20. So that day on which the Levites killed
their brethren, the blood did consecrate their hands; and defiled them not.
David, when he killed the enemies of the Lord, there was nothing to defile his
hands here, but then he washed his hands in innocence, and then he offered a
most acceptable sacrifice to God: why then should he have been forbidden to
build an house unto the Lord, because he was a man of blood?

The reason why God would not have David to build the Temple.
The reasons why the Lord would not have David to build the temple were these:
the first reason was this, the Lord from that time, that he brought his people
out of Egypt, was called their great commander, and leader, and then he b^^^
to call his people an host, Exodus 7.4. Extendere manum imperatoris Signum.
That I man (...) out mine armies, my people the children of Israel out of
Egypt, by great Judgments, and with a stretched out arm: this stretching out
of the arm was a sign which the commander gave to the soldiers. Josh. 8.18.
therefore in that battle which Moses fought against the Amalekites, Exodus
17.18. he held up his hands, as a commander or general of the field; and so
the Lord stretched out his hand, and gave a sign to all the frogs and lice,
his armies, to fight against Pharaoh, and so he promised that he would
redeem them with a stretched out arm: now when he had his people in the
wilderness as his army round about him, God was amongst his people as the
Emperor amongst his Soldiers.
he commanded to make a tabernacle for him, which he would have pitched
amongst the midst of his people, as the Emperors tent is amongst his soldiers,
Number 2 3.

After that they had entered into Canaan, they had wars all the days of
Joshua, cap. 3.7. the Lord said to them, Ye shall know that the living God is
amongst you; even as the Emperor is among his soldiers in his tent. And as
all the time of the Judges, the arc dwelt under curtains; so likewise in the
days of David it dwelt in a tent, and all this while they stood in need of a
valiant and courageous Captain, God himself to be their general, and this
Vriah acknowledged, 2. Sam. 7.6, 7. the arc and Israel and Judah abides in
tents; Shall I then go home to mine own house, and lie with my wife: This was
the reason why God would not have David to build the Temple, for the wars
were not yet ended.

But 2. Sam. 7.1. It is said, The Lord had given him rest round about from all
his enemies; it might seem then, that now the Lord needed not to lodge any
longer in a tent.

Although David had peace with his enemies round about without, having overcome
them, David had peace with foreign enemies but not in his own kingdom.
yet the kingdom was not settled within; therefore it was not time yet for the
Lord to have his house builded, but to dwell still in a tent as he did before,
but the time was shortly to come when all his enemies should be put under, and
then the people should enjoy the fruits of peace, The Lord promised a peaceable
king to the Israelites.
and then he promised to them a peaceable king, who needed not to go abroad to
fight his wars, but should live peaceably at home with them in Jerusalem;
then the Lord said, that he would quit that warfaring life, and his tent, and
have a Temple built unto him, where he might dwell, and for this end, Why the
Temple is called the house of God.
he made choice of a peaceable king to build it: hence we may see, why the
Temple is called the house of God, and his resting place, Psalm. 132.^3. The
reason then w^y the Lord would not have David to build his Temple was this,
because the wars were not yet ended, and the Lord would dwell still yet among
them in the Tabernacle, as in a tent.

There was another cause why the Lord would not have David to build the Temple,
Why God would have his Temple built by a peaceable prince.
because he was fighting his battles, he was not a man of peace, he was not a
fit type of Christ, the Prince of peace, when he was fighting the battles;
this was reserved for Solomon, who was a peaceable king, therefore there was
not a hammer heard in the building of the Temple, to signify, that it should
be a Temple of peace: where strifes and contentions are, the kingdom of God is
never well built; In that vision of Elijah, there was a wind, and the Lord was
not there; there was an earthquake, and the Lord was not there; and after the
earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire, a
still small voice, and the Lord was there, 1 King. 19.11.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, there is the blood of war, and the blood of
reconciliation; the Lord would have no blood of war shed in his Temple, The
Temple how built.
he would have it builded in a peaceable time, in a peaceable manner, that no
hammer was heard in the building of it; a peace able Prince must build it, no
weapon might be carried through it, Marc. 11.16. no murderer was protected in
it, but was pulled from the horns of the altar; no blood was shed in it: when
Athaliah was to be killed, Iehoiada commanded to carry her without the ranges,
2. King. 11.15. And lastly, because the Temple stood upon a hill, there was
(...), or a wall builded round about it, that no man might fall over, as there
were batlements about the houses, that no man might be in danger when they
walked upon their roofes, or bring blood upon their houses, Deuteronomy. 22.8. So the
Lord built this wall about the Temple, that no blood might be brought upon his
house, but the blood of reconciliation was daily shed in this house, which was
a type of that blood, which is the blood of peace, and speaks better things
then the blood of Abel.

EXERCITAT. XI. Of the order of the sixth and seventh Commandments.
Marc. 10.19. Thou know the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not
kill.
ALL the three Evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke, have set down this history
of the young man, asking Christ what he should do to obtain life eternal;
Matthew sets down the Commandments which Christ bids him keep after
this manner, Thou shall not kill, thou shall not commit adultery, but Mark.
10.19. and Luke cap. 18.20. do set them down in this order; Thou shall not
commit adultery, thou shall not kill, and the Apostle keeps the same order.
Romans 13.11.

Although it be not very material in what order the commandments be set
down, when they are not directly entreated of, but when they are cast in by
way of answer and illustration; for we see the Evangelists, when they handle
them but occasionally, they put the first commandment after theft and
adultery, yet it is not to be passed by: Mark and Luke keep this order, Why
murder is put before adultery.
and the Apostle likewise sets down adultery before murder; the reason
seems to be this, the Seventy in their translation, set down adultery before
murder, this edition of the Seventy was translated in the days of Ptolomeus
Philadelphus, and was received by the grecizing Jews, who lived in Alexandria;
Matthew following the Hebrew text, and writing especially unto the Jews,
keeps the order set down in the original text, in Deuteronomy. 5 But Mark who
ruled the church of Alexandria, followed the translation which was received
there; and this seems to be the reason why Luke and Paul kept the same order.
Romans 13.11. because they followed the translation which was used amongst the
grecizing Jews; for although the Greek translation, which is called
complutensis, sets murder before adultery; yet the ancient Roman edition,
in Exodus 20. has it this ways; Thou shall not commit adultery, thou shall not
murder. So Philo, and Clemens Alexandrinus do set adultery before murder:
This Philo lived in the time of the Apostles, and then no doubt the Greek
translation was more pure, and deserved more authority, but this Philo first
sets down adultery, and then murder, and then theft; and he gives a
reason why adultery is put before murder, because of the filthiness of it,
S^r^m. lib. 6.
and the great and many evils that it brings upon the family. So Clemens
Alexandrinus sets down adultery first, and then murder; and Julian the
Apostate who was a reader first in Nicomedia, and therefore could not be
ignorant of the order of the commandments, Cyril. lib. 6. contra Iul. Apostat.
sets them down after the same manner, neither does Cyrill the Bishop of
Alexandria find fault with him for setting them down so.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: the translation of the Seventy being so generally
received in the churches of Alexandria, it is most probable that the
Evangelists and Apostles would give no offense to the grecizing Jews, in
things which were not contrary to faith.

Commandment. VII.
EXERCITAT. I. How vile a sin adultery is.
Exodus 20.14. Thou shall not commit adultery.
WHen a man sins, he sins either against God, against himself, or
against his neighbor; the Apostle lays out this division plainly: Tit. 2.12.
We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; holy
before God, soberly toward our selves, and righteously toward our neighbor.

The adulterer sins, first, against God; secondly, against himself, and
thirdly, against his neighbor.

First, he sins against God; The adulterer sins against the three persons
of the Trinity.
he sins directly against all the three persons of the Trinity, against
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.

First, he sins against God the father the creator; The adulterer sins
against God the father.
when God created Adam, he made him first one, then he made the man and the
woman two, and thirdly by marriage, he made the man and the woman one again;
Adam created one at the first, then was made two and then one.
And they two shall be one flesh. Genesis 2.24. And then comes the adulterer,
and separateth them whom God has conjoined and made one.

^e sins against the Son.
Secondly, the adulterer sins against God the Son the redemer, Shall I then
take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? 1. Cor.
6.15. Is Christ divided? he is like the natural mother that will not have the
child divided, he will not have his members, to be made the members of an
harlot.

He sins against the Holy ghost.
Thirdly, the adulterer sins against the holy Ghost the Sanctifier, defiling
the temple of his body; and as the unclean conversation of the Sodomites
grieved the spirit of just Lot. 2. Pet. 2.8. much more does the unclean
conversation of the adulterer, grieve the good spirit of God.

The adulterer sins against himself.
Secondly, the adulterer sins against himself; First, against his own body.
How sins he against his own body? He sins against his own body
subjective, but in other sins objective; for in other sins the body is but
the instrument, and the thing which he abuses is without the body; as when a
murderer kills a man, the wrong and injury is done to his neighbor; but
when he commits adultery, the body is not only the instrument by which he
commits this sin, but also the thing it self which is abused; he sins
against his own body making it the member of an harlot, and depriving it of
the dignity which it had, and by bringing loathsome and vile diseases upon it.

ALIENVS pro inimica apud Hebra^^.
So he sins against his own family, bringing in a strange woman, Prove. 5.9.
Lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years unto the cruel. and
Prove. 5.20. And why will thou my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and
embrace the bosom of a stranger.

(...) Spurius. (...) aliona labes. (...) Spurius a (...) tacere.
So he sins against the child begotten in adultery, he is called Mamzer, as
ye would say, aliena labes, another man's blot; and the Hebrews call him
Shatuki, from shatak tacere, for when others are praising their parents, he
must hold his peace, because he knew not who was his father; and the Jews
call the natural children the olive and the vine, and the bastard they called
the bramble, and the Greeks call them (...), (...) contumelia and (...)
stupro, bruta etiam animalia (...) dicuatur cum petulantia sunt and ^as^rva.
because they are subject to contumelies. Ioh. 8.41. We be not borne of
fornication: the Physicians call the short ribs costas spurias, or base ribs,
the Athenians had a place in Athens called Cynosorgus, from (...) canis, and
(...) in the Ionick tongue signifies white, because they offered a white dog
to Hercules: First, they offered a dog; quia canes promiscue coeunt, then
they offered it to Hercules, because Hercules was a bastard, therefore they
used to say to a bastard, (...), that is, get you to the judicatory to be tried.

As the adulterer sins against himself, The adulterer wrongeth his
neighbor.
so he sins against his neighbor; First, he wrongeth the head of the
family, taking from him, The wife called the delight of the eyes.
her who slept in his bosom, eat of his morsels, and drank of his cup. 2.
Sam. 12.3. So he takes from him the delight of his eyes. Ezekiel. 24.16. So he
wrongeth the rest of his neighbors children, making them to be suspected of
bastardie; for even as one piece of light money makes the whole sum to be
suspected; so does the bastard make the rest of the children in the family to be
suspected. Psalm. 128.3. The children of the house are called olive plants:
Children compared to olive plants.
why are they compared to olive plants? as the olive plant will suffer no other
graft of any other tree to be ingrafted in the stock, so cannot the natural
children of the house abide a bastard to be amongst them. Judge. 9.2. Thou shall
not inherit with us, because thou art the son of a strange woman.

Compare this sin of adultery with other sins, Adultery compared with
murder.
and ye shall see the vileness of it: a murderer when he has committed a
murder, his conscience does sting him after the fact be done, but stolen
waters are sweet to the adulterer. Prove. 9.17. that is, he has no remorse for
the sin, and he is led like the ox to the slaughter, or as a fool to the
correction of the stocks, till a dart strike through his liver, as a bird
hastes to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life. Prove. 7.22, 23.

Adultery compared with fornication.
Compare this sin with fornication, and ye shall see the vileness of it.
Chrysostom has a good comparison to this purpose, Simile.
we excuse says he the master of a ship, when the ship is cast away by the
storm of weather; but if the ship be brought within the harbor, and then the
master of the ship should cast her away, then he should plead no excuse: So
says he, when youth is unmarried, and carried away with the tempests of
sinful lusts, they may seem to have some pretense or excuse to extenuat their
fault, as not being married; but when they are come within the haven, or safe
port of marriage; what excuse can they have then?

Adultery compared with theft.
Compare this sin and theft together; theft takes away a man's goods, but
whoredom steals away oftentimes the right of a man's lands. The theife when
he steals, does it for necessity, and he will restore seven fold for it,
but an adulterer cannot make restitution. Adultery the greatest theft.
Prove. 6.31, 32. It is the greatest sort of theft that is, and therefore the
Greeks called them (...), fures conjugij.

Sin added to another fault, to note the greatness of it.
When the Scripture appropriateth this word [Sin] to any particular sin, then
it notes a great sin; as this people has committed a sin, that is,
idolatry; So whoredom by way of appropriation is called a sin, Luc. 7.37.
And behold a woman in the city which was a sinner, that is, which was a
prostitute harlot.

The greatness of this sin appears in this, there is a double end of
marriage; First, to beget children; Secondly, the remedy against lust; but the
adulterer delights in lust, but not to beget children in this act, therefore
it is most opposite to honorable marriage.

Under the law, the sacrifice which was offered for the woman suspected of
adultery, is called oblatio recordationis; Number. 5.18. In all other sacrifices
the iniquity was purged, and put away; but in this sacrifice the sin of
adultery is remembered, and there was no incense nor oil added to this
sacrifice, which two signified, pleasure and joy; there was nothing pleasing to
the Lord in it.

Lastly, the greatness of the punishment shows the greatness of the sin,
The punishment of adultery grievous.
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Heb. 13.4. and without shall be
dogs, sorcerers, and whoremongers, etc. Revelat. 22.15. The whores house
inclines to death, (...)
and her paths [El rephaijm] to the Giants. Proverbs 2.18. to that part of
hell, where these damned monsters are.

The conclusion of this: Conclusion.
Seeing adultery is such a fearful sin, we must shun all occasions
which lead unto it; Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door
of her house. Prove. 5.8. When Potiphars wife took hold on Joseph's cloak, he
left the cloak behind him, and would not touch it again; no more then David
would drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which was got with the
hazard of men's lives.

EXERCITAT. II. Of the allurements of the Whore to adultery, and how vile she
is being compared with wisdom. Commandment. VII.
Prove. 9.14. She sits at the door of her house on a seat in the high
places of the city, to call passengers that go by, etc.
The whore is wisdoms Ape.
THe whore is the Ape of wisdom, for as the Ape in some outward gestures
imitateth man, but cannot reason as man does, or speak as he does: so the
whore but imitateth wisdom in some outward things, but not in true virtuous
actions.

The whore counterfeiteth wisdom in inviting her lovers.
She counterfeiteth wisdom; First, wisdom stands in the top of high places,
by the way in the places of the paths, Prove. 8.2. and she calls the sons
of men in the entry of the gates. So does the whore sit in the corners and
high places of the city; and inviteth her lovers. Prove. 9.14.15.

Secondly, wisdom has her palace; She has builded her house, she has
hewn out her seven pillars. Prove. 9.1. So the whore has her chamber, and her
bed decked with coverings, and perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and ointment. Prove.
7.16.

Thirdly, wisdom has her banquet; She has killed her beasts, she has
mingled her wine: she has also furnished her table. Prove. 9.2. So has the
whore her banquet, her peace offerings: Prove. 7.14.

Fourthly, wisdom inviteth the simple; Prove. 8.5. but the whore inviteth the
foolish man, void of understanding. Prove. 7.7.

But se the difference, wisdom has a stately palace builded upon seven
pillars, but the whore has a bed decked with coverings, perfumes, and aloes,
this bed dressed thus with such perfumes, and ointments, might put the young
man in mind that he was going to his grave, for the bodies of the dead were
embalmed with such perfumes and ointments, and Her house is the way to hell
going down to the chambers of death, Prove. 7.27.

Wisdom cries without, she utters her voice in the streets, she cries
in the chief places of concourse, in the openings of the gates, in the city
she utters her words. Mark the proceeding of wisdom here in this gradation:
First, she cries [bahhutz] without, that is, (...) foris (...) locus urbis
patulus in quem Mercatores ac Venditores contrahendi et vendendi gratia
convenient. (...) in capite tumltuantium id est turbarum. (...) ad fores
portarum, ubi suprema Iudicum subsellia.
she cries as she comes out at the door: again, she cries [barhhobhoth] in
the streets, that is, in the place where buyers, and sellers use to meet for
exercising of merchandise. Thirdly, she cries [berosh homijoth] in the chief
place of concourse, that is, where both the chief of the people, and common
multitude resort, as 1. Sam. 14.38. Draw near here all ye chief people. So
Iud. 20.2. Fourthly, she cries [hephithhe shegnarim] in the opening of the
gates, that is, in the place where the Judges, and the counsel sat, she is
not afraid of the faces of great men, nor of the power of the Judge. But the
whore has her cry, and she comes to the door of her house, and to the
streets, and to the corners of the streets, Prove. 7.12. but she dares not be
bold to come into the gates of the city, where judgment and justice are
administered.

They that eat of wisdoms banquet, it shall be marrow to their bones, Prove.
3.8. but they that eat of the whores banquet, shall mourn at the last, when
their flesh, and their body are consumed, Venus abantiquis (...) dicta.
therefore the Greeks called Venus (...), solvens vel dissolvens membra.

Wisdom mixeth her wine with spices, but the whore has her cup of fornication
mixed with Philtra, or enchantments, Revel. 17.4. poculum (...), a cup of
abomination, and filthiness of her fornication, Wisdom has length of days
in her right hand, Prove. 3.16. but the whores feet go down to death, and her
steps take hold on the grave, Prou. 5.5. Whores of old haunted amongst the
graves.
The whores of old were shut out of the city, and dwelt by themselves, and
when they committed their villainy, Hadrianus Turnebus, lib. advers. 13.19.
they went to secret places amongst the graves, therefore they called them
bustuartas moechas, de scortis inter busta atque monumenta prostantibus: the
whores who haunted among the graves to hide their filthiness: and the Seventy
allude to this, Ierem. 1. How say thou I am not polluted, I saw thy ways in
the valley* the Seventy has it, I saw thy ways amongst the graves.

Wisdom brings riches in her left hand, Prove. 3.16. but the whore brings
a man to a morsel of bread, Prove. 6.26. and strangers are filled with his
strength, that is, ROBVR pro divi^ijs.
his riches, for strength is put for riches, Hos. 7.9. Job. 30.24. And he
mourns when all is spent, Pro. 5.11. in the original it is [Nahamta
ba^hharithecha] which properly signifies to roar as the hungry lions do when
they are hungerbit. (...) ne forte rugias vel gemas in no^issimis tuis (...)
rug^st, fremuit leonum famelicorum proprie.
Such was the cry of the forlorn son, after that he had wasted all his
goods upon whores, when he said, I perish with hunger, Luc. 15.17.

Wisdom comes with honor in her left hand, Prove. 3 16. but the whore
brings shame, Prove. 5.14. I was almost in all evil in the midd st of the
congregation and assembly, that is, I was esteemed an infamous sinner, So Luc.
7.3. Behold a woman in the city which was a sinner, that is, who was esteemed a
public and infamous sinner, and so publicans and harlots are joined together,
as infamous and notorious sinners.

Who so finds wisdom finds life, Prove. 8.35. but whosoever haunteth with
a whore gives his years [leaczari] to the cruel, (...) Crud^lis, proprie
v^^^num Asp^^lu^.
Prove. 5.9 [aczar] properly signifies the poison of the aspe, Deuteronomy. 32.33.
which breeds no pain at the first, but the poison is deadly and cannot be
cured; The lips of a strange woman do drop as the honey comb, but her end is
bitter as worme-wood, sweet things breed choler, but bitter things diminish
choler; the fair speeches and songs of the whore seem to be sweet and
pleasant, but being digested they turn to bitterness, but spiritual songs as
David's, although they seem bitter at the first, yet they are comfortable in
the end, and Sweeter then the honey and the honey comb, Psalm. 19. Therefore
Solomon wills the young man to deliver himself from the strange woman that
flattereth with her words, Prove. 2.16. nitzal est furto se eripere, (...) furto
se eripuit, vel proripuit.
to steal himself out of her bonds, who keeps him so in fetters.

As the Lord said to the Israelites, that he had set life and good, and death
and evil before them, Deuteronomy. 30.15. So the Lord here sets death and life before
men, the way of wisdom, and the paths of the whore, that they should choose
the one and decline the other.

EXERCITAT. VII. The adulterous eye is a motive to adultery. Commandment. III.
2. Pet. 2.14. Having their eyes full of adultery.
THe motives which draw men to this sin, are first, the members of the body,
and they are those two especially, the eye and the tongue; and the ornaments of
the body, either natural, or artificial; natural, as the hair; artificial,
as apparel.

Adultery first bred in the heart.
Adultery is first bred in the heart, out of the heart comes adultery and
murder, Matt. 15.19. Apolidorus in his dream, as Plutarch testifies, dreamed
that the Scythians took him, and fleyed the skin off him, and boiled him in
a caldron, and in the meanetime, while he was thus tormented in the caldron,
his heart said secretly unto him, Ego tibi horum sum causa; the heart is the
cause of all filthiness, and therefore if we would keep this Commandment,
we must Gird the loins of of our minds and be sober, 1. Pet. 1.13. that is,
our sinful passions, and especially our lust, which hinders us in the way.
(...) Si pellectus fuit animas meus.
Job. 31.9. If mine heart has been deceived by a woman: [im niphta libbi;] it
is the same word which is used, Exodus 22.16. If a man entice a maid: and 1.
King. 22.20. Who shall deceive Ahab: It is the heart that deceives a man,
therefore the heart should chiefly be looked unto, for it is the hardest task
of all to keep it. It was well said by one of the Fathers, Non puto ullum qui
clauserat coelum oratione, It is a hard task to keep the heart aright.
quod clauserat animam a cogitatione; and facilius est coelum obserare quam
animam; I believe not that he who shut the heavens by his prayer, could shut
his heart from evil thoughts, and that it is an easier thing to shut the
heavens, then the heart.

Adultery shows it self in the eye.
This adultery comes from the heart to the eyes and there is a great affinity
betwixt the heart and the eye, the one is causa, and the other is occasio to
this sin; and the eye is the bawd, who goes betwixt the object and the
heart; and there is such affinity betwixt the heart and the eye, Desires are
attributed to the eyes.
that desires are attributes to the eyes, Eccl. 2.10. I withheld not from mine
eyes, whatsoever they desired. So Genesis 45.20. Let not your eyes spare the
stuff. So 1. Sam. 24.10. Mine eye spared thee.

The eyes are the occasion, but it is the heart that must yield to the desire
or deny it, The eye is the occasion, but the heart is the cause of sin.
the eye importunes us much; therefore John calls it, The lust of the eye; 1.
Ioh. 2.16. So Number. 15.39. That ye go not a whoring after your own eyes: and
Peter says, That their eyes are full of adultery: in the Greek it is (...)
Pleni adulterae, (...).
full of the whore, as if the whore were seen sitting in the eye of the
adulterer, but it is better read, Full of adultery; for it is the manner of the
Hebrews, to put the epethite for the substantive; as Deuteronomy. 29.19. Vt addat
ehrietatem sitienti, prositi, here the epethite ebrius, Regula Hebraeorum. The
epethite put for the substantive.
is put for the substantive, ebrietas: so here adultera, the epethite, is put
for adulterium, the substantive.

To make a covenant with our eyes is that which is required of us here; there
is a great discord betwixt the regenerate mind and the sinful members, and
therefore the regenerate part had need to take good heed to them, or else they
will deceive it.

Job made a covenant with his eyes, Job. 31.9. Not only to restrain the first
consent, and sinful motion, but also the sight it self; and it was his
study, Reducere speciem sensus externi, ad eandem speciem cum interno; as the
Schoolmen say, to make his eyes answerable to his heart, as his heart was
clean from adultery, so he would have his eyes also.

Simply to behold a woman is not a sin, but curiously, and with a sinful eye
to look after a woman, and lust after her, that is sin. Matt. 5.28. the
Apostle says, 2. Cor. 4.18. Look not at things which are seen, but at things
which are not seen, (...), is so to look, When it is sin to look upon a
woman.
as the archer looks to the mark; he that beholds a woman this ways,
has an adulterous eye, He that looks on a woman, Matt. 5.28. (...), is not
only to look with the eye, but also with the heart. Some of the heathen have
plucked out their eyes.
Some of the heathen knowing how unruly the eye was, have pulled out their
eyes, and they thought them most happy that were blind. And Seneca said, Nonne
intelligis partem foelicitatis nostra esse caecitatem: but they were mistaken,
Christ wills us to pull out our sinful eye, Matt. 5.29. take lust from our
eye, which is a member of our sinful body, and then the eye of it self is a
good member of the body.

We should not look upon the nakedness of others.
The eye is the special occasion to this sin, therefore men should not desire
to see the nakedness of others; Sem and Iaphet went backward that they might
not see their fathers nakedness. Rabbi Abraham held that it was not lawful to
behold the creatures when they were ingendering, The angels when they apeared
were clothed.
because of the corruption of man's nature, which is stirred up to sin by such
sights; the angels who are blessed spirits, and have no concupiscence, yet when
they appeared in the likeness of men, they appeared clothed, Act. 1.10. and
the Seraphins wings covered their feet, Esaias. 6.2. For reverence of the Majesty
of God, they covered that part which the Scripture calls our feet. Deuteronomy.
28.57. Genesis 49.10.

Nature teaches us to cover our nakedness, therefore when a man has
committed a sin, he blusheth, the blood, as it were, would cover the sin,
Verecundia celat turpem actum, and erubescentia cessat a turpi actu.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, although we had need to look to all our senses, to
our taste, Prove. 23.1. to our touch, Eccles. 6.1. yet we have more need to
look unto our noble sense of hearing, for Evil communication corrupts good
manners. 1. Cor. 15.33. but most of all we have need to look to our sight,
and we should do with it as the Romans of old did with their prisoners, they
never went abroad but they had their keeper joined with them, therefore they
said, Vna catena continet tam mili tem quam reum, send never thine eyes abroad,
but send their keepers with them.

EXERCITAT. IV. How the tongue breaks this Commandment by filthy speeches.
Commandment. VII.
Ephesians. 4.29. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.
BEfore man fell he needed no clothes to cover his nakedness, but after the
fall, as the Apostle says, We put honor upon our unclean parts, 1. Cor.
12.23. So before the fall, no speech had been uncomely, but since the fall
such is the corruption of the heart of man when he hears filthy speeches,
that he is provoked by them; therefore when the holy Ghost speaks of such
things, (...).
he covers them with modest and comely terms.

And first we shall observe, The modesty of the spirit of God on the
Scriptures in giving comely terms to things.
that there are no proper names in the Scripture given to that part of the
body which distinguishes the sexes in man or woman, as in other languages,
and that is done for modesties sake, sometimes the Scriptures call it flesh.
Genesis 17.13.23. Caro.
Levit. 15.2.19. Ezekiel. 16.26. and 23.20. so it is called a man's shame, Deuteronomy.
25.11. Pudor.
The woman that puts out her hand, and takes a man by his shame: hence it
is that all filthiness is called confusion, Philip. 3.9. Thirdly it is called
his nakedness, per Antiphrasin, Nuditas.
because it should not be naked; Levit. 18.6. Nahum. 3.5. Pes.
So it is called the feet; Esaias, 7.20. I shall shave the hair of the feet:
so Deuteronomy. 28.57. and Exodus 4.25. and the thigh, Femur.
Numb. 5.21. And the Lord cause thy thigh to rot, so Exodus 1.5. All the children
which came out of Jacobs thigh; and the Apostle calls them Unclean parts,
Membra ignobiliora; foedus circumcisionis. (...)
1. Cor. 23. and Targum upon Ruth, for modesty calls this member foedus
circumcisionis, and the Hebrews call it [beth bosheth] domus pudoris, and
[abhar hamishgabh] membrum Coitus, so digitus: so [beth hamishtarim] domus
absconditorum, and the man's is called his arrow, and the woman's her quiver,
Sagitta. Pharetra.
Eccles. 6.6. She opens her quiver to every arrow.

When they describe the action it self, they set it down in most comely
terms: Arare.
Iud. 14.18. If ye had not plowed with my heifer: so the Latins following them
say fundum alienum arat, Revelare alam.
and they call the adulterer agricola, so revelare alam: Deuteronomy 22.30. He shall
not discover his fathers skirt. Molere.
So to grind, Let my wife grind to another man, Job. 31.10. So to bow down,
Let another bow down upon her. Incurvare.
so Seminabitur semine, Number. 5.28. that is, Seminari semine.
her husband shall lie with her and she shall conceive. So to eat, Edere.
Bibere.
She wiped her mouth and said, she did it not, Prove. 30.20. Effundere aquam.
so to drink, and the water is put for seed: He shall pour out his water out
of buckets, Aqua pro semine.
Number. 25.59. and Prove. 7.9. (...).
Stolen waters are sweet: so (...), to go together. Matt. 1.19. so to touch,
I suffered thee not to touch her, Tangere.
Genesis 20.6. and 1 Cor. 7.1. It is not good for a man to touch a woman, Dare
poma. Legere nuces.
hence comes intacta virgo, amongst the Latins, and the Latins used to
express these actions in modest terms, mutum peccatum. (...)
as dare poma, legere nuces, for these kind of fruits were set upon the table
of Priapus, and the Schoolmen call the sin of Sodom, mutum peccatum. So the
Masorets have changed one word into another for modesty, (...)
Deuteronomy. 28.30. Thou shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
they have changed [shagal] subagitare, into [shacabh] concumbere, and their
tradition in the Talmud is col hammikraoth haccethubhim bethorah legannai korin
othan leshebhah; omnes voces quae scriptae sunt in lege obscene, legunt eas
honest.

But ye will say,

When the holy Scriptures were written, When the scriptures were written, there
were no uncomely termee.
these words were comely and modest, and gave no offense to the hearer, but the
corruption of man is grown since; and many words are so degenerate, that
chaste ears cannot hear them without offense; many words are degenerate now,
which in our fathers time sounded well enough.

The conclusion of this is: Conclusion.
Let us study to be modest in our words, as well as to be holy in our actions;
many men are ashamed now that their nakedness should be seen, but they are
not ashamed to lay out their nakedness in filthy and beastly speeches.

EXERCITAT. V. That the dressing of the hare is a motive to the sin of
adultery. Commandment. VII.
1. Pet. 3.3. Let not your adorning be that outward adorning, of the plating of
the hair.
THe hair has a fourefold use: First, The hair of the head has a fourefold
use.
it has a natural use, to be the woman's ornament and her glory. 1. Cor.
11.14. It is the woman's glory, but it is a shame for the man to wear long
hair, which is the woman's ornament. Job. 5.5. The robbers swallow up their
substance, in the Hebrew it is Tzamim, (...)
the hairie ones; Nebuchadnezzar when he lived amongst the beasts, then his
hair did grow; (...)
and the devils are called Shegnarim, hirsuti. Levit. 17.7. They shall no more
offer their sacrifices Leshegnirim, to the hairy ones, that is, to the devils;
they are called hayrie ones, because they appeared in the form of Satyrs or
wild Goats; Absolon who gloried in his long hair was caught by it.

Secondly, the hair has a moral use: Levit. 19.32. And thou shall rise
before the hoary head. Thirdly, it had a ceremonial use, as the Nazarits
hair. And lastly, men have found out a profane use to make it an occasion to
uncleanness.

The abuse of the hair, and that four ways.
The hair is abused; First, when it is dyed and made of another color, then
the natural color of it; Which of you, says Christ, can make one hair black
or white. Mat. 5.36.

Secondly, the hair is abused when the locks are hung out to be seen of
others; Iunius in Cant. 4.1.
a modest matron hides them. See Cant. 4.1. Oculi tui columbini prae crine
tuo, that is, thy hair is bound up like the modest matrons, and not hung as
the hair of the strumpet; the locks of the hair are called Mahhlephoth, (...)
mutationes. (...) mors.
mutationes; and our death is called Hhalephah, mutatio; Ioh. 14.14. and the
Hebrews give the reason why the locks are so called, because the locks change
first; when our hair begins to change, it is praeludium mortis, the
forerunner of death; if men and women would remember this, they would glory
little in their hair.

Thirdly, it is abused in plateing and frizeling of it. 1. Pet. 3.3. So women
abuse their hair when they cut it like a man's hair. 1. Cor. 11.6. It is a
shame for a woman to be shorn.

And lastly the hair is abused, when they borrow false hair, Pea; est mulier
alienam caesariem gestans.

Defects of nature may be supplied,

We may supply the personal defects in nature, What defects in man or woman
are to be supplied. Two sorts of defects, personal and natural.
or the occasional wants; a man wants a leg, he may put a leg of wood
in place of it; but natural defects which are incident to all the sons of
men should not be supplied by art. Example, the wrinckling of the face is
natural to all old women; this is a natural defect and not personal:
therefore to paint the face to cover this defect is altogether unlawful, so to
dye the hair and make it of another color.

The Lord has given oil to make the face to shine,

God when he gives the use of his creatures to men, A fourfold use of Gods
creatures, for necessity and for delight, and as typical, and as national
customs.
he gave first for necessity; secondly, he gave them for delight, as the wine
to cheer the heart, and the oil to make the face to shine; thirdly, he gave
the Jews some things for ceremony; fourthly, he permitted some things to them
for the national customs, as to the Jews to annoint their faces with oil:
So he bids the Jews rent their hearts and not their clothes; the Lord
has given us the comfortable and natural use of the oil, but he has not
given us that national custom of the oil to annoint our faces with it, no
more then in the day of humiliation to rent our clothes.

When women paint their faces as Iezabel did, they are ashamed of nature, and
would amend Gods handy work; hypocrites are called in the Syriack, facetakers
Nasaph bappa, (...)
because they take a counterfeit face upon them, and make a show of that which
they have not: as there is moral hypocrisy, so there is artificial
hypocrisy; (...), is that which is the contrary; (...).
this is nativa pulchritudo, and non fucata.

Women should study to adorn the hid man of the heart, and not to delight in
these outward shows; What things we should labor to adorn.
Mary Magdalen when she was converted, wiped Christ's feet with the hair of her
head, wherewith she had entised her lovers before; we have a notable example
of the Roman matrons, Plutarch. de fauore.
what they did with their hair in defense of the Capitol; when the Gauls
besieged the Capitol, the Romans had no strings for their crosse-bowes to
defend the Capitol, and the history tells us the women did shave off their
hair to make strings to the crosse-bowes, that they might defend their gods,
and therefore they say, aedem veneri calvae consecrarunt; if they would cut
their hair (the greatest ornament) for the defense of their heathenish gods;
what a shame is it for women who profess themselves Christians to make their
hair to be an occasion to make others to sin.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, we must mortify sin in all the parts of the
body, and the ornaments of it should be comely.

EXERCITAT. VI. Of whorish apparel. Commandment VII.
Prove. 6.10. There met him a woman with the attire of an harlot.
Why we should not be proud of our apparel.
Our apparel at the first was instituted to cover our nakedness, therefore we
should not be proud of our apparel; man in his best estate is but a worm (as
the Hebrews say) clothed with the excrements of the worm, he is but
expectatio vermium, and shall be consumed with worms, why then should he be
proud of his apparel?

Christ says, Mat. 6.29. A comparison betwixt the clothing of Solomon and the
clothing of the Lilies.
that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of the Lilies; the
glory of Solomon was bur artificial, but the glory of the Lilie was natural;
now the perfection of art is to imitate nature, and as far as nature
exceeds art, as far does the Lilie exceed Solomon in all his glory.

Secondly, Salomons clothing was borrowed, but not the Lilies.
how many things was Solomon beholden to, when he was dressed up this ways?
he was beholden to the earth for the Gold, to Egypt for the linen, to the
silke-worme for the silk, and to the shellfish for the purpure; and if every
one of these should have claimed their own, Solomon should have been stripped
out of all, and should have stood up like Esops Crow, who borrowed a feather of
every foul; but the Lilie was beholden to none: therefore the Lilie exceeded
Solomon in all his glory.

Thirdly, when Solomon was adorned this way, Salomons clothing was to cover
his shame, but not the Lilies.
his ornaments were but the covering of his shame, and he had no more cause to
brag of these, then a thief had of a silk rope, or if a man should brag
of a plaster laid to his filthy sore: but the Lilie carries no mark of
shame, therefore the Lilie exceeded Solomon in all his glory.

Fourthly, There was but one Solomon richly clothed, but all the Lilies of the
field were so.
there was much ado to get one Solomon decked this ways, bur all the Lilies
of the field were decked alike; therefore the Lilie exceeded Solomon in all his
glory; there is small reason then why men and women should so glory in their
apparel.

Apparel is ordained to distinguish the estates and conditions of men, the
nobler from the baser, Apparel ordained to distinguish ^exes.
They who are in Kings houses wear soft apparel. Mat. 10.18. and the Kings
daughters in those days wore a party colored gown (...) ^om. 13.18. And she
had a garment of diverse colors. So the nobler sort in Israel wore white
clothes, Eccles. 9.8. Let thy clothes be white, therefore they were called
[Horim] candidi; (...)
and the baser sort wore black clothes. Prove. 22.29. Non stabit cum obscuris,
that is, with the baser sort.

Again apparel was instituted to distinguish sexes, The man shall not put on
the woman's apparel. Deuteronomy. 22.5.

Lastly, apparel was instituted for commodity, when they traveled with the
ambulatorie Arc through the wilderness, then their clothes were short, but
when they came to Canaan, they had (...), clothes reaching to their feet.
Revelat. 1.13. But the devil has found out another use of apparel. (...)
ornatus meretricius.
Prove. 7.10. She met him with [Shith tzonah,] the attire of a whore, this is a
garment which becomes not an honest woman; and as in the wars, justa est
percussio gerentis hostilem tessaram, they may be justly killed who wear the
enemies badge in the wars; so may those who wear the whorish garments: There
is nothing that shows the vanity of the mind, more the^ apparel does. Luc.
7.25. They that wear soft apparel, The apparel shows the vanity of the
mind.
(...), the Apostle; 1. Cor. 6.9. transferreth it to the mind (...), molles,
the apparel shows the effeminatnesse of the mind.

Some ornaments lawful in themselves.
Some sort of ornaments and apparel are lawful in themselves, and the Lord
only condemns the abuse of them; a chain of it self is a thing lawful,
and it is lawful for a man of place to wear it, but if he wear pride with
it, as a chain, Psalm. 73.6. then it is an abuse of the ornament: (...) i^^nis.
(...) incantare.
So Lahhash is called an eare-ring, and Lahhash is called incantare, to bewitch
or entice, when one wears an eare-ring to entice or bewitch with it, then it
is the abuse of the ornament.

Those ornaments which the matrons of old used, as Rebeccha and Sarah, as
bracelets and eare-rings, they are not unlawful. 1. Pet. 2.5. For after this
man^^^ was the holy women of old time adorned, who trusted in God, where the
Apostle insinuates, that there was much more gravity, and comeliness in that
age, Ornaments from which the spirit of God borrows comparisons, are lawful.
then there is now; Secondly, these ornaments are lawful in themselves, from
which the spirit of God borrows comparisons in decking of the Church; (...)
Redimicula ornamenti colli fuerunt.
the abuse of these is only condemned, and not the use. Esaias. 3.20.
Hakkishurim, the Lord applies this to the ornaments which he bestows upon
his Church. Ier. 2.32. Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire,
the Seventy (...), fasciae pectoralis. So Ezekiel. 16.11. the holy Ghost borrowes
comparisons from ornaments and deckings of the body; I clothed thee with
broidered work, I shod thee with badgers skins, and I put bracelets upon
thine hand, and jewels upon thy forehead; the use of these is lawful, but the
abuse is only condemned.

These ornaments which have any necessary use in the body, are lawful, and
the abuse is only censured. Esaias. 3.20. [Batte hanephesh] domus animae, (...)
domus animae.
the soul here is put for the breath of the soul; and because they breathed
in these maskes, therefore they are called the house of the soul; the mask is
a necessary ornament for the safety of the face, therefore the abuse is only
condemned here. So 1, King. 20.38. Mutavit se in sudario, that is, he changed
himself in putting a scarf upon his face; the Chaldee has it Megnaphar,
(...) pulvis. (...) sudarium.
which signifies to keep the dust from the eyes; it is not [Epher] pulvis
here, but [Aphar] fudarium, this is a necessary covering for the face.

The persons who may use these ornaments are the rich rather then the poor. 2.
Tim. 2.19. The Apostle forbids the women to adorn themselves with gold,
pearls or costly array: What persons may wear ornaments lawfully.
The Christians at that time for the most pare were of the poorer sort, for not
many noble were called. 1. Cor. 1.8. he blamed those who adorned themselves
above their rank.

Secondly, it is more lawful for those who are in the court, then those who
are in the country to wear these ornaments; They that are in Kings houses
wear soft apparel. Mat. 11.18.

Thirdly, it is more lawful for married women to dress themselves, than for
widows, that so they may please their husbands: She that is married cares how
to please her husband. 1. Cor. 7.34. but when women dress themselves this
ways, they must have a care to adorn the hid man of the heart always: the
maids before they were married in Israel used to go forth to the vineyards
clothed in white, to dance in the day of expiation. Judge. 20.21. and they
said, O young men lift up your eyes upon us, and see which of us ye will
choose; look not to beauty, because it is deceitful; neither to riches,
because they take their wings and fly away; but choose her who fears the
Lord.

Women must not do that which is lawful unless it be expedient.
Christian women must remember not only what is lawful, but also what is
expedient; they have wealth enough, and their husbands allow them; yet they
must remember the expediencie, and how far it is lawful for them to extend
their Christian liberty. 1. Cor. 10.26. The Apostle shows us, That the earth
is the Lords, and the plenty thereof; therefore it is lawful for us to eat of
any thing; and again, The earth is the Lords and all that is therein;
therefore we should not eat to offend others; it was better for them to spare
their Christian liberty, then to extend it too far to the offense of others.

That apparel is unlawful which men borrow from strange nations, not
contenting themselves with the ancient forms of their country. Zeph. 1.8. I
will punish all such as are clothed in strange apparel; (...)
such as were these. 2. Chron. 20.1. [Mehagnammonim] who counterfeited the
Ammonites in their apparel, and gestures, and such are the garish women in
these days, who cannot satisfy themselves enough with new forms, who daily
change with the moon, that a tailor can hardly shape a coat for her; they may
be compared to the ships of Tyrus, whose boards were of the fur trees of
Shenir, whose masts were from Lebanon, whose oars were from Bashan, and their
benches of the ivory of Chittim, their sails from Egypt, and the purple that
covered them from the isles of Elishah, Ezekiel. 27.5, 6, 7. so these women have
their ornaments from India, Spain, France, Italy, etc. and all to make up a
proud bark in Tyrus. Nazianzen writing against the pride of women (who borrow
from sundry creatures, ornaments to dress themselves) compares them to
Pandora that goddess whom the Poets feign to be sent to Epimetheus by the
gods, Simile.
with a barrel having all sort of mischief enclosed in it, that they might be
avenged upon him for the deceit of his brother Prometheus: so the whorish woman
is that Pandora, by whom the divill, the world, and the flesh have sent a
barrel, in which all sort of vanities is enclosed to plague the insolent and
loose youth, who is given to filthiness.

These ornaments are altogether unlawful, which are put upon parts of the body
that should be covered; the women, Esaias. 3.20. did wear [hazegnadoth] a garter
of worth about their leg, (...) periscillis ornamenta pedum.
which the Prophet blames in them, and for this purpose they made their
clothes the shorter, that their legs might be seen; modesty should have
taught them to cover that part with their clothes, the abuse of this ornament
is not only condemned here, (...)
but likewise the very use of it in women. So Esaias 3.16. The daughter of Zion
[g^bhu] altae sunt, they did wear high shoes to make them seem the taller;
Which of you (says Christ) can add one cubit to his stature, (...)
Matt. 6.27. so to wear ornaments upon the basest parts, Esaias 3.18. I will
take away [hagnaccasim] their ornaments about their feet, which made them go
as if they had been fettered, the very use of these ornaments are condemned
here, and not the abuse only.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, the holy women, Exodus 30. gave their looking glasses
for the making of the bras^n altar (for of old their looking glasses were made
of brass) so should Christian women now renounce these ornaments of vanity,
and deck the hid man of the heart.

EXERCITAT. VI. What unclean persons were called dogs. Commandment. VII.
Deuteronomy. 23.18. Thou shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow.
WE have spoken of the occasions which lead to the breach of this Commandment;
Wherein the actual breaking of this command stands.
now it remains to speak of the actual transgression of it; and it is
broken either by unlawful conjunction, or unlawful separation.

God has put in some fowls, a shadow of chastity to teach men to shun
filthiness and uncleanenesse; the turtle dove makes choice but of one mate,
The example of the unreasonable creatures do teach men chastity.
to teach man and woman to live in holy wedlock; the lioness when she has
joined her self with the leopard, before she come to the lion again, she will
wash herself that the lion may not smell her, to teach the adulterous woman
what a filthy thing adultery is, When she wipeth her mouth and says, she did
it not, Prove. 30. but the most memorable example of the beasts is, the example
of the mare, which Aristotle makes mention of: Arist. lib. 9. de hist. ^^i
^lium, cap. 47.
the King of Scythia had a mare of most excellent brood, which brought forth
most excellent coalts, amongst the rest she had one which excelled them all;
the king was desirous that this coalt might horse his damme, that so he might
have an excellent brood of them, but the coalt, when he was brought to his
damme, would not horse her; the king seeing this, he caused them to cover the
damme, that he might not know here, but he perceiving afterward that it was
his damme, run away and cast himself over a steep rock, and brake his neck;
is not this a memorable example to teach men and women to fly incestuous
adultery; for as God has put some shadow of chastity in unreasonable
creatures, to teach man to eschew uncleanenesse; so the Lord sets before us
most filthy and unclean beasts, to teach man not to be like unto them.

A dog is a most unclean and filthy creature, The most vile creatures teach
men to abstain from uncleanenesse.
which goes publicly and promiscuously to generation, and therefore these
were called Cynici Philosophi, who were not ashamed publicly in the sight of
all to lie with women.

By dog is not meant, Deuteronomy. 23.18. a dog properly called a dog, but
Cynaedus, or meritorius, An adulterer metaphorically called a dog.
who is unsatiable in lust like a dog, and that it is meant of such a dog,
the reasons are these.

First, because the whore and the dog are joined together here: secondly, the
Scripture applies this word dog to filthy whoremungers: When Ishbosheth
objecteth to Abner that he lay with his fathers concubine Rizpah, what
answered he? An persona canina ego? Am I a filthy person like a dog, who
has no care to whom I join my self.

The whore and the dog compared together.
Hierome upon Esaias 6. says, the dog and the whore are well joined together;
for the dog, when as he should keep and watch the house, and run seldom
abroad, yet in his uncleanenesse he runs here and there, and joyneth and
coupleth himself indifferently to any: so does the whore who should keep her
self at home, and be domi-porta; yet she wandereth abroad, and seeks after
strange lovers. Pro. 7.12. Now is she without, now in the streets, and lies
at every corner. The modest and chaste woman is compared to the vine that
grows by the sides of the house: Psalm. 128.3.



Praeter naturam corruptam, which is against corrupt nature, and there is a
filthiness, which is secundum corruptam naturam, according to corrupt nature,
1. Cor. 5.1. It is reported that there is a fornication committed amongst you,
and such a fornication as is not once named amongst the Gentiles, Job. 36.14.
They die in youth, (...)
and their life is [bakkedeshim] among the unclean. And these sorts of
uncleanenesse may be taken up after this manner; first, quando servatur sexus,
sed non ordo, as when a man commits adultery with a woman. So quando non
servatur gradus, as in incest. Secondly, Four sorts of uncleinenesse.
quando servat speciem non sexum, and these the Apostle calls (...), 1. Cor.
6.9. 1. Tim. 1.10. Levit. 20.13. and this is called (...), abomination.
Thirdly, quando not servant sexum nec speciem, sed genus tantum, this is
bestiality. And lastly, quando neo servatur genus, nec species, nec ordo, as
when one lies with unclean spirits, which are called Incubi, or Succubi, and
the Schoolmen observe, that the Lord in the first creation forbids these
sorts of uncleanenesse: first, there was not a fit help found amongst the
beasts to man, God forbideth all these sorts of uncleanenesse in the creation.
hence they infer that a man should not lie with a beast. Secondly, when God
created man and woman, he created them male and female, to teach us not to
confound our sexes, for then they cannot increase and multiply. Thirdly, when
God created the woman, he created her out of the side of man, to teach us that
collateral marriages are only lawful marriages, but not in the line
directly, either ascending or descending; and it is to be observed that there
is but one word tebhel, mixtio vel confusio, when a man lies with a beast,
Levit. 18. So when a man lies with his daughter in law, this is also called
tebhel, to teach us what an horrible sin it is, quando non servatur species,
so quando non servatur gradus.

Uncleanness again, Uncleanness according to corrupt nature.
est secundum naturam corruptam, according to corrupt nature, it is either
fornication or adultery; those who delight in this filthiness, and lie still
in it, are dogs: Abner purged himself of this uncleanenesse, Am Ia dogs
head? 2. Sam. 3.8. See how this sin changes men and women into dogs, and
salt bitches. When Nabuchadnezzer was cast out of his kingdom, he had the
heart of an ox in him, although he had the shape of a man; so these filthy
creatures although they have the shape of men and women, yet they carry the
heart of a dog within them.

And as the holy Ghost terms them dogs, (...) a (...) pascere (...) armare.
so he calls them fed horses. Ier. 5.8. They were as fed horses in the
morning, every one neighed after his neighbors wife [susim mevuzanim] from
[Zun] pascere, but the critickes of the Jews read it in the margent
[mejuzanim] id est, duro pene praediti, a [jazan] armare.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, let us remember that fearful sentence, Revelat.
22.15. For without are dogs, and let us study to be holy, that we be not
excluded out of that holy city.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Whether David might marry Bathsheba after that he had
committed adultery with her. Commandment VII.
Psalm. 51. In the inscription, When Nathan the Prophet came unto him, after he
had gone in to Bathsheba.
THere be two things which may seem to hinder David's marriage with Bathsheba:
First, the uncleanenesse of Bathsheba, and a number of her sins concurring
together, showing no repentance in her. Secondly, that action of the common
law, Nemo ducat came quam adulterio polluit.

The sin of Bathsheba aggravated.
First, let us look unto the sins of Bathsheba, she did wash her self in a
place where she might be seen by the king, Justin. lib. 1.
and exposed her chastity this ways, not unlike unto the history of Candaules,
he having a fair and a beautiful wife, Simile.
one of his soldiers, named Gyges, saw her naked, she was grieved that she
should have been seen naked of any, except of her husband, she concluded
that one of the two should die, that she might be the wife only of one who
had seen her naked: Gyges killed the king Candaules, and then married the
queen. So David saw Bathsheba naked, killed Vriah, and then married Bathsheba.
When Iulia the mother of Caracalla opened her breasts before him, he said,
Spartianus.
vellem si liceret: what replied the whore to him? Si libeat, licet, an nosti
te imperatorem leges dare and non accipere? so we may think that Bathsheba
thought the same, yielding so to David.

Secondly, compare her fact, and the fact of her husband Vriah: he was but a
Hittite, a stranger and a proselyte, yet he would not go up to his own bed
to lie with his wife, when the arc and his master Ioab were in the fields; but
she being a borne Jew, and trained up in the exercises of religion, yet would
go in to another man when the ark of the Lord, and her husband both were in
the fields.

Thirdly, it may be alleged that she mourned not for her husband a sufficient
time, Et quod non persolverat justa marito suo, that she mourned not for her
husband the appointed time; Theodosius lib. 1. logum de secundis nuptijs. c. 21.
for they were infamous by the civil law, who married a second wife, or a
second husband, before a year was expired, or ten months at the least.

Fourthly, that she married him who killed her husband, her religious husband,
her courageous husband, who was one of David's worthies; and here it may be said
of her as the Prophet said of Achab when he killed Naboth, and took away his
vineyard, occidisti, possedisti, 1. King. 21. So Bathsheba consenting to the
killing of her husband Vriah, possessed David for her husband.

Although Bathsheba's sin cannot be excused, The weakness of Bathsheba
excused.
but that it was adultery that she committed, yet to exaggerate her faults too
far, this is Satan's part and not the part of a charitable Christian.

She was washing her self in the garden, but not of purpose to be seen of the
king; and she was in her legal purification washing her self, 2. Sam. 11.4.
and David sent for her, and lay with her, for she was now purified from her
uncleanenesse.

She went in to David when her husband and the arc were in the fields: but
consider the weakness of the woman, and the infirmity of her sex, she was
but a sheep, as Nathan calls her, and might easily be deceived by David.
David would have made Vriah her husband drunk with wine that he might have
gone in, and lien with his wife, and now he makes her drunk with fair
promises, that he might lie with her; Thou shall be queen, etc.



Sam. 11.26. But how long she mourned for him, the time is not set down,
Eccles. 22.12. Seven days does a man mourn for him that is dead, and in the
Scriptures we read but thirty that they mourned at the most, Deuteronomy. 34. so
long they mourned for Moses, and when it is said, Genesis 50.3. That the Egyptians
mourned for Jacob threescore and ten days, How long they mourned for the dead.
it is to be understood thus, that there were thirty days spent in mourning,
and the rest in embalming of the body.

And whereas she is charged, as privy to the killing of her husband, the
history shows no such thing, and in charity we should think rather that
she knew not of the killing of him.

Arguments proving Bathsheba's repentance.
Arguments proving her repentance, both before that David had married her, and
likewise after.

First, she is reckoned amongst our Lords predecessors Rahab, and Tamar, to
show us, that she repented of this sin from her heart: and here Hieromes
saying is to be marked; Notandum (inquit) in genealogia Christi nullam
sanctarum mulierum assumi, sed illas quas Scriptura reprehendit, ut qui propter
peccatores venerat, de peccatoribus natus, peccatum deleret: that is, it is to
be marked that none of the holy women are reckoned in Christ's genealogy, but
such as the Scripture reproves for some sin, that he who came into the
world for sinners, and who was borne of sinners might abolish and destroy
sin; and as Rahab the harlot repented her of her whoredom before Salmon
married her; so did Bathsheba repent her of her adultery before David married
her.

Secondly, when David married her; 2. Sam. 12.24. the text says, he comforted
her; (...) Penituit. Consolatus est.

the Lord grants consolation only to penitent sinners, as to her after her
fall and repentance; and therefore the word Nahham signifies first to repent.
1. Sam. 15.35. and then to comfort; Esaias. 40.1. because none gets comfort
but those who repent first.

Thirdly, 1. King. 1.21. Otherwise, when the King shall sleep with his
fathers, I and my son shall be counted offenders; which shows that God had
pardoned her sin, and that she was loath to draw on another new guilt upon
her.

Fourthly, see the holy instruction which she gave to her son Lemuel, she was
a Prophetess and had revelation from the Lord. Prove. 31.2. It is not for Kings
to drink wine, nor for Princes strong drink; and she calls him the son of
her vows, whom she had consecrated to the Lord by many vows; all which show
the repentance of this holy woman.

Fifthly, Solomon calls himself the son of thine handmaid. Wis. 9.5. In
which epithet his father David delighted very much before: Psalm. 116.16. Truly
I am thy servant, I am thy servant, the son of thine handmaid, where they
allude to that custom under the law, (...).
for those who dwelt with their masters, and begot children within the house,
the children were called [Ben bethe] vernae domus; they were not counted their
fathers children, What meant by the son of the handmaid.
or their mothers chilren, but their masters children. So would David and
Solomon say, we are begotten of faithful parents, and of faithful mothers
within the covenant, and therefore we belong to thee as justly, as the children
of the servants borne within the house, do belong to their master.

David swears to Bathsheba that her son should succeed and granted her
request, and see how Nathan the Prophet advised her in all her businesses; all
which shows that she has been a holy woman, and repented her of her former
adultery.

Solomon honored her, being his mother, he set her at his right hand, and it
is chiefly to be ma^ked, that the Lord would not have the child begotten in
adultery to live, lest a bastard should succeed to the kingdom, or that he
being alive might be a reproach continually to his mother.

The second reason alleged, why David might not marry Bathsheba, was, because
he had polluted her with adultery; Nemo eam ducat quam adulterio polluit.

The Canonists understand this axiom with these caveats.

First, if the adulterer and the adulteress have made a mutual promise when
her husband was alive.

Secondly, if the adulterer and the adulteress have lived together.

Thirdly, if the adulterer had intended the death of his wife, or the
adulteress had intended the death of her husband; in these cases the Casuists
do not permit them to marry. To grant liberty for the adulterer to marry the
adulteress, were to open a door to all uncleanness, and because there are
few of them that seriously repent them of their sin, therefore that liberty
should not be granted, that the adulterer and the adulteress should marry
together.

David's example in marrying Bathsheba, both in their repentance, and in Gods
approbation of the marriage was extraordinary, therefore it should not be made
an example or president for others to do the like.

EXERCITAT. IX. Against Polygamie. Commandment. VII.
Levit. 18.17. Thou shall not take a woman to her sister.
THe Lord discharges here a man to marry two wives at once, What is meant by
sister here.
by [Sister] here is not meant a natural sister, for that the Lord discharged
before. Lev. 18.16. Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy brothers wife;
therefore thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy wives sister, but by
[Sister] here is meant any other woman. The Carraim amongst the Jews, and they
who followed the literal sense, expound the words thus; Thou shall not take a
woman to her sister, that is, thou shall not marry two wives at once; but the
Pharisees who gave way to Polygamie interpreted the words thus; thou may not
marry two sisters, but thou may marry two other women; the Carraim who did
interpret the words thus, thou shall not marry two wives at once, said, qui
multiplicat uxores, multiplicat veneficas; and they said, that it was not
permitted to the King to have many wives, therefore it is lawful to none to
have many wives; but the Pharisees gave way to it and taught it.

Reasons to prove that it is not the natural sister here spoken of.
Now the reasons to prove, that by sister here is not meant a sister properly
taken are these.

Neither shall thou take a woman to her sister to vex her Levit. 18.18. but
the wives in Polygamie are called angentes, or vexers. 1. Sam. 1.6.

Moses pass it by and not forbid it? but this Polygamie was forbidden in the
first institution. Mat. 19.5. 1. Cor. 6.16. and 7.39. Romans 7.2. and Mal. 2.3.
but we can show no place in Moses law against Polygamie except this, and Deuteronomy.
17.10. where he forbids the King to multiply wives.

Thou shall not take a woman to her sister in her life time, because it was
usual among the Jews to have more wives at once.



Boaz who raised up seed to his next kinsman was not married, and N. refused to
raise up seed to him, because he was married, and had children of his own;
and therefore the Chaldee Paraphrast upon Ruth 4. Josephus lib. 5. antiquil.
Cap. 14.
Non possum redimere, quia uxorem habeo; and Josephus inclines to this, that
it was the unmarried brother that behoved to raise up seed to his eldest
brother, and (...), is not meant of him that took one wife to another, but of
him that married his brothers wife; he not being married.

Secondly, he might marry his brothers wife,

That follows not,

This Polygamie is contrary to the first institution of God, for God made one
man and one woman, Polygamie is contrary to the law of God.
and not one man and two women at the first. Judge. 5.30. Dederunt puellam, and
duas puellas uni viro, Have they not divided to every man a damsel or two
damsels? This shows the great confusion that was then, and the scarcity of
men, and multitude of women; and Thomas observes well, that man does something
which agrees to him ex natura generis, as to beget; Secondly, he does
something ex natura speciei, as he is a reasonable creature, to beget a
reasonable creature; and thirdly, he does something as a faithful man,
marrying one wife, and herein he represents Christ; and she represents the
Church. Although polygamie be not against the two first, yet it does directly
cross the last, the resemblance betwixt Christ and his Church; therefore the
faithful man should have but one wife.

If it were lawful for a man to have more wives at once, It was never
permitted for a woman to have more husbands at once.
then it should be lawful for a woman to have more husbands at once; but it
was never permitted amongst any people for a woman to have two husbands at
once, therefore it is not lawful for a man to have more wives at once; The
reason of the connection, the Apostle gives, the man has not power over his
own body but the wife, and the wife has not power over her own body but the
husband. 1. Cor. 7.4.

It may be alleged that women have had two husbands at once, once, for Paul
says, 1. Tim. 3.9. If she has been the wife of one husband, he means not
here, if a widow marry again; therefore it may seem that she has had more
husbands at once.

Two sorts of Digamie.
There are two sorts of digamie; direct digamie, and indirect digamie; direct
digamie when one has two husbands at once; indirect digamie when one was put
away, and they married another, and in this sense it may be said, that the
woman had two husbands; by the law of God she might not divorce from her first
husband, but it was permitted amongst the Jews, and commanded amongst the
Gentiles; for by the law of God she was still the wife of the first husband, if
she had not been repudiate for adultery.

should not disinherite the child of the hated woman for the child of the
beloved. Deuteronomy. 21.15.

Some laws are permissive some definitive.
Some laws are permissive, and others are definitive; I call these permissive,
when the law permits the first part for the hardness of the peoples hearts,
but then it restrains the abuse of it by inhibitions, that it should not
exceed; the law tolerateth usurie, this is the permissive part of the law; it
does not command this, then in comes the restraint, that they shall not
exceed such an annuitie, this is the definitive part of the law. So the law
permits a man to have more wives, and then it comes in and restrains the
abuse that might follow upon it; Thou shall not disinherite the child of the
hated woman for the child of the beloved.

Polygamie a middle sin betwixt fornication and adultery.
The Divines make this sin of polygamie a middle sin betwixt fornication and
adultery, less then adultery, and greater then fornication.



If we consider the sin in it self, it is ever adultery, In what case
polygamie is a sin.
but consider it, first, upon Gods part, who passes by this sin, not
punishing it; and upon their part, who through a general custom thought it no
sin, then it may be said to be less then adultery. Christ said to the Jews,
If I had not spoken unto you, ye should have no sin. Ioh. 15.22. that is, if
the truth had not been clearly declared unto you, your sin had been the
less, but because I have spoken so clearly unto you, that aggravateth your
sin. This extenuated the sin of the Jews, because the Prophets spoke
little or nothing against polygamie, as they did against adultery: When Judah
lay with Tamar, taking her to be a common harlot, his sin was the lesser;
but she knowing that he was her father in law, her sin was the greater:
Polygamie was a sin of ignorance amongst the Jews: but if a man should marry
more wives at once now, it should be flat adultery.

But God gave the wives of Saul into the bosom of David. 2. Sam. 12.8.

To put them in his bosom is to put them in his subjection, In what case God
is said to give Saul's wives to David.
for David could never have married the wives of Saul, for that had been
incest.

Whether did God dispense with the Jews to marry many wives or not?

None could ever show this dispensation, Romans 3.25. he called them sins
passed by, through the long forbearance of God.

What is the difference betwixt a sin passed by,

All sins are pardoned to the children of God in Gods eternal decree; sins
when he does not chasten them for them, A difference betwixt sins passed by
and pardoned.
as he does for other sins; and when he pardons other known sins, he
pardons these unknown sins together with them; when David got pardon of
his adultery, he got pardon likewise of his polygamie which he knew not to be
sin. When David got pardon of his adulrery in his own sense, he behaved
likewise to have pardon in his own sense of his murder, because it was a
known sin to him likewise, but these sins which he knew not, the general
remission served for them.

The difference betwixt a married wife and a concubine.
Let us compare the married wife and the concubine together, and show how they
differ.

(...) Habebant dotem uxores non concubine.
First, the married wife differed from the concubine by contract and solemnity
of marriage; but when he married the concubine, there was neither contract nor
solemnity of marriage.

Secondly, they differed in their titles, for the chief and principal wife
was called [Shagal] conjux, (...)
she was the principal and chief of all the Kings wives. Neh. 2.6. Dan. 5.2.
Quae semper tori jus habet, the concubines were admitted but some times; (...)
Domina, hera.
and the married wife was called [Gebhereth,] the mistres of the house. Genesis
18.8. but these concubines had never this title.

Thirdly, they differed in their intertainement, for if the King had taken more
concubines, he might have made them aromatorias and apothecarias for his
spices, and cooks and bakers, and the common sort he might have made them
socarias, which they could not have done to their wives solemnly espoused.

Four things proper to the concubines, and fine to the wives.
Fourthly, when they married these concubines, they ought them but four things;
victum, amictum, debitum tempus, and cohabitationem; food, raiment, due
benevolence, and cohabitation; but he was to give five things to his wife whom
he had solemnly taken, victum, amictum, debitum tempus, cohabitationem, and
honorem: food, raiment, due benevolence, and he was bound to dwell with her,
and to honor her.

Fifthly, they differed in their posterity, Only the children of the freewoman
succeeded to the inheritance.
for the children of the free woman succeeded to the inheritance; but not the
children of the concubines. It is true by singular prerogative, Jacob gave to
the sons of the concubines their portion among the tribes, but the children
of other concubines stayed not in the house, but were sent out with gifts, Genesis
25. and the children of the concubines were called the free woman's children,
Genesis 16.2. Go in unto mine hand maid, it may be that I obtain children by her:
and therefore Rachel and Lea are put for them and their handmaids, Ruth. 4.11.
and we may see how the children of the concubines were more servile then the
children of the free-women, therefore, Galat. 4.23. they are called the
children of the bond woman, and they did things rather for fear then love;
this the Lord shows, Deuteronomy. 27. when he divided the tribes, he set those who
were borne of the free women, Rachel and Leah, upon the hill to bless, but
those who came of the handmaids, he set them upon the hill of cursing, as
being of a more servile and base mind. Ruben for his incest lost this
privilege, and was set among the children of the handmaids, and Zabulon the
youngest son of Leah is set amongst them to make up the number.

Whether was the concubine a wife properly or not?

Yes, Genesis 30.9. Leah gave Zilpah for a wife unto her husband, therefore when
it is said, he took her [ leisha, (...)
] in uxorem, it should not be translated, uxoris loc^, but verily for his wife;
so I shall be unto you [Leadona,] idest, vere Deus. Hos. 13.12. Servavit Israel
[leisha] propter uxorem, Genesis 29. An non pro Rachaele servivi tibi. 2. Sam.
20.3. David shut up his concubines, and they were in widdowhood until the day
of their death; if they were widows, then they were married before, and the
children begotten betwixt them were truly their fathers children, and not
bastards.



(...)
Scortata est contra eum, [gnal] non cum eo, Ezekiel. 16.16. and when she fled
from him she was justly punished for her uncleanenesse. Iud. 19.

The differences betwixt the concubines and the whore.
Again let us consider how the concubine and the whore differed: the concubine
made a division and rent betwixt the man and his wife when he married her,
therefore she is called Pilagish from Palag-ish, (...) Concubina, quasi (...)
dividero virum.
dividere virum, that he could not errare in amore ejus; as Solomon says,
Prove. 5. but the whore makes a total separation betwixt the man and the wife.

Again they differed in their ends; marriage has a double end, the first end
is the begetting of children, the second end is a remedy against lust; the
whore desires not the first end for the procreation of children, neither
desires she the last end of marriage, the holy remedy against lust; the
Polygamist aims at the first end, to have children; but not at the last end,
for avoiding of lust, for this diversity of concubines made a way rather to
increase lust, then to quench it, They shall commit whoredom and not increase,
Hos. 4.10. this is a judgment pronounced against polygamists, and not against
adulterers, for they longed for children, where as the other long for none;
the word in the original is ijpparedu. (...) mula.
Pered in the original is called a mule, as if ye would say, they shall play
the mule; the mule is a beast very libidinous, but begetting nothing. So these
polygamists, although they long for children, yet the Lord threatened them with
want of children. An example of this we see in Solomon, although he had many
concubines yet he had but one son; and he was also a fool.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
we are to bless our Savior who has reduced marriage to the first
institution, that one man should have but one wife, Matt. 19.5.

EXERCITAT. X. Of Divorce. Commandment. VII.
Matt. 19.9. Whosoever puts away his wife, except it be for fornication,
commits adultery.
WE have shown how this Commandment is broken by unlawful conjunction, now
it remains to speak how it is broken by unlawful separation.

The Hebrews call repudium, cerith, excisio, (...) Excisio, Repudium. (...)
Libellus excisionis. (...)
and they call the bill of divorce Sepher cerithoth, libellus excisionis,
because the woman was cut off from the family of her husband, and had liberty
to go where she pleased. And the Chaldees call it net pitturin, and the
Rabbis call it girush, expulsio, and the latter Rabbines call it riphudin,
from the Latin word repudium; and the Greeks call it (...) and the bill of
divorce they call it (...): Divortium, Ariat Montanus.
was when the man gave the bill of divorce to the woman; Repudium was when the
woman gave the bill of divorce to the man.

There was a great question betwixt the house of Sammai, and the house of
Hillel concerning divorces. (...).
Sammai held that it was lawful for a man to put away his wife only for
adultery; The difference betwixt the School of Sammai and Hillel concerning
divorce.
and he expounded these words, Si invenerit nuditatem in ea; that is, if she
has committed adultery. But Hillel and his followers extended this word
nuditas to all sorts of filthiness, as to the least sort of offense that is,
because it is said in the text, Si non invenerit gratiam in oculis ejus, Deuteronomy.
24.1. and they who asked the question of Christ, seem to be of the opinion of
Hillel; for they say, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause? Matt. 19.3. Ben Syra who was a follower of Sammai, being asked of a man,
(...)
who had a great shrew to his wife, whether he might divorce from her or not,
he answered Os quod cecidit in sort tua, rode illud.

When Moses speaks of divorces which were usual amongst the Jews, he
speaks of those divorces which were for light causes and not for adultery;
How Moses is to be understood when he speaks of divorce.
Moses words, Deuteronomy. 24.1, 2, 3. should not be read thus, If she has found no
favor in his eyes, then let him write her a bill of divorce: but thus
hypothetically: If she has found no favor in his eyes, and if he write her a
bill of divorce and put her away etc. If he were speaking of lawful divorce
for adultery, then it should be translated in the imperative mood, Let him
write her a bill of divorce, and let him put her away, as the words of Christ
implie, Matt. 19.9. that for adultery it is lawful for a man to put away his
wife; but that which Moses spoke hypothetically they took it absolutely. So
Ioh. 21.22. If he tarry till I come what is that to thee? that which Christ
spoke hypothetically, they took it absolutely, as if Christ had said that John
should not die till he came again.

The reason to prove that Moses is speaking here, Deuteronomy. 24. of unlawful
divorces, and not for adultery; is this, verse. 4. Her former husband may not
take her home again to wife, after that she is defiled by him, and defiles
herself: Huttamaah is a compound word, (...) ex Hithpael et Hophal compositum:
Sic Judge. 9.9. (...) ex Hiphil and Hophal, sensus est, vestrisnever bis
persuasa ita missam facere pinguedinom meam, iuxta Hiphil, et ea ipsa quoque
priver et deficiar, iuxta Hophal, nihilque amplius habeam in me commenbile.
for the Hebrews use to compound two conjugations, and it signifies she was
defiled by her husband, and she defiled her self; she was defiled by her
husband, because he put her away unjustly, and gave her occasion to commit
adultery, and she defiled her self, who being unjustly divorced, yet would
marry another and so commit adultery; for Christ says, Matt. 5.23. Whosoever
shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: but
whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes
her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced,
commits adultery; if he had put away his wife for fornication, she had not
been polluted by him, but only she had polluted herself, if she had married
another.

But it may be said, Deuteronomy. 24.3. (...) Nuditas.
If he have found some nakedness in her, [gnervath] nakedness in the Scripture
is taken for filthiness and adultery, then it may seem that Moses is speaking
here of unjust divorce.

Nakedness is taken for other sorts of filthiness then for adultery, the
Seventy translate it (...), Nakedness is taken for adultery.
rem turpem; and Jonathan turns it, transgressionem rei, They put away their
wives for many other causes besides adultery, as for blemishes in their
persons, scolding and brabling, and such.

But Malachi seems to approve this sort of divorce for light causes, If thou
hate her, put her away, says the Lord. Malac. 2.16.

It should not be translated,

Moses did not simply allow here the putting away of their wives for such light
causes, but if they would put away their wives for such light causes, then he
bids them write a bill of divorce to them; the Lord allowed not that an
Israelite should marry a captive heathen, but if he will marry such a one,
then let him shave her head, and put on her mourning apparel, and mourn for
so many days, that by these means the Israelites love might be abated, and so
might leave her. So Moses liked not of these divorces, but if a man will put
away his wife for such causes, then let him write her a bill of divorce.

Joseph would have done Mary, Matt. 1.

The special use of the bill of divorce was when they put them away for light
causes.
If the Magistrate had done his duty after that she was known to be an
adulteress, then in that case she needed not a bill of divorce; but for their
remissness the husbands were oftentimes forced to give the bill of divorce to
their adulterous wives, and especially when the Jews came under the
subjection of the Romans, then most usually they gave the bill of divorce for
adultery, because the Romans had no respect to the law of God, putting the
adulteress to death; therefore their husbands were glad to be rid of them, by
giving them the bill of divorce.

The cause of giving the bill of divorce amongst the Jews.
The cause of many divorces amongst the Jews was the multitudes of their wives
which they had. They who travel amongst the Turks at this day, testify, that
there is no cause so much pleaded in their judicatories as divorces; and the
reason they give to be this, because of the multitude of their wives.

When the man gave the bill of divorce to the woman, How the bill of divorce
was written.
the cause of the divorce was written in the bill, and the woman did show the
bill of divorce before the Judges, and the children did also keep the bill of
divorce, to be a testimony that their mother was not an harlot, and the Lord
alludeth to this form, Esaias 50.1. Where is the bill of your mothers
divorcement, whom I have put away? as if the Lord would say, Allusion.
I put not away your mother, but she went away willingly from me.

When they wrote this bill of divorce the Jews wrote it in a long letter, but
the Romans wrote it in few words, res tuas tibi habeto.

The bill of divorce was given by the man to the woman at the first, to be a
sign of her innocence, The man gave the bill of divorce to the woman at the
first.
and of his wrong dealing with her; and as Tamar, when she showed to Judah his
ring, and his signet, Judah said, she is more righteous then I am: so the man
putting away his wife for no just cause, and the woman showing the bill of
divorce to her husband, he might justly say, surely she is more righteous then
I.

The man had the power to give the bill of divorce to the woman at the first,
but afterward the woman gave the bill of divorce to the man also, Marc. 10.12.
and if a woman put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits
adultery. Josephus, lib. 15. cap. 11.
Salome the sister of Herod was the first woman who gave the bill of divorce to
her husband Chrystoberus; and Josephus adds, that the law only permits
the man to give the bill of divorce to the woman, and that it was not lawful
for the wife who was repudiat to marry, but by the commandment of her former
husband; the first part, that the husband should give the bill of divorce, is
set down in the law: but this latter part, that they might not marry again but
by their husbands consent, is not in the law, for that came in by custom and
not by the law, for the woman might leave the husband when she had a just
cause, and marry again without his consent.

When the wife was repudiat from her husband for no lawful cause, and married
another, and bare children to him, Forum Poli. Fori.

whether were these children bastards or not?

They were bastards in foro poli, before God; but not in foro fori, in the
courts of men.

The conclusion of this is; Let no man separate that which God has conjoined;
and let no man conjoyne that which God has separated.

EXERCITAT. VIII. How man and woman may live chastely in holy wedlock together.
Commandment VII.
Prove. 5.19. Let thy wife be unto thee as the loving hind, etc.
Solomon says, Prove. 5.15. Drink waters out of thine own cesterne, here by a
modest kind of speech, he wills a man to content himself with his own
wife. Concupiscence or lust in the Scriptures is compared to burning, Lust
called burning and thirst.
1. Cor. 7.2. and the Prophet alludeth to this sort of thirst, Ier. 2.25.
Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: the remedy
against this burning and thirst is holy marriage, which quenches it, but
whoredom rather increases it: I have forbidden thee, would Solomon say, the
company of those beastly whores, and now I show thee the way how thou may
live chastely in holy wedlock, then he subjoyneth, Let thy fountains be
dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the street, verse. 26. or divide thy
waters in the street; here he gives a reason wherefore marriage should be
preferred to adultery, because seldom children are begotten of adulterers, and
if they beget any, Adulterers often times ashamed of their children.
they are ashamed of them, that they should be called their children: first,
seldom they beget any, they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase,
Iipparidu; pered is called a Mule, which is a beast which is much given to
lust, and yet begets nothing; and if they beget any children, they are
ashamed of them, and the children likewise are ashamed of their fathers; and
therefore the Hebrews call them Shatuki, from shatak, tacere, (...) spurius a
(...) tacere.
the father will not profess such a child to be his, nor the child profess
the father to be his father.

And rivers of waters in the streets, that is, when thou know them to be
thine own children, then thou have power to direct them and guide them, and
see that they marry by thy direction, for even as men draw water conduits which
way they will, so should the parents lead the children in their marriages.

Let them be only thine own, that is, Imperativum pro fu^uro.
they shall only be thine own, and thou may be assured when thou do
marry a chaste woman, that thy children are thine own, and not a strangers with
thee, to inherit and possess that which thou have purchased. Psalm. 127.4.
Children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his
reward, and thy children shall be like arrows in the hand of a mighty man.
Then Solomon returns to his first advice, let thy fountain be blessed, and
rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

The first preservative to keep man and wife in purity, is to live chastely
before they be married; so did Jacob, Genesis 49.3. Ruben thou art my might, and
the beginning of my strength; Jacob knew not a woman before he was married, but
Esau was a profane man and a fornicator. Heb. 12.16.

The second remedy is, for a man to delight himself with his wife; Let her
be like a loving Hind unto thee, and as a pleasant Roe, and let her breasts
satisfy thee at all times. The wife compared to the Hind.
Prove. 5.19. the Hind is a loving creature, and follows the male; the Hind
is ardent in her love, and they are ready one of them to help another, so
should the man and his wife; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, (...)
inebriant te.
in the Hebrew it is, [Ieravucha] inebrient te: see how the Holy ghost wills
a man to delight himself with his own wife, therefore he adds, Cur erres
cum extranea [Tishge] to wander as beasts do, (...) erravit, proprie bestiarum
est.
who make not choice of one mate. And contrary to this chaste love is, when a
man thinks that stolen waters are sweet. Prove. 9.17. and is not content to
drink out of his own cisterne. Prove. 5.15. he should call his wife the
delight of his eyes. Ezekiel. 24.16. So should the wife content her self with the
love of her husband; Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth. Cant. 2.

This chaste love the longer that it continue, the stronger and sweeter it is;
INEBRIARI in re a morum quid.
and the longer that it is kept, it is the more fragrant; the love betwixt the
whore and the harlot, is not a permanent love. Prove. 7.18. Come let us be
drunk with love until the morning, yet it is the same word that is used to
express that chaste love betwixt the husband and the wife: Prove. 5.17. but it
differs very much from that love; this word Rabha to be drunk, VERBVM
mediae significationis, quid.
is verbum mediae significationis, as the Hebrews mark, that is, it may be
taken either in a good part, or in an evil; but vergit saepius in extremum, it
declineth to the extremity if it be not taken heed unto. So Psalm. 90.10. Dies
annorum nostrorum and superbia eorum, labor, and dolor; the days of our years
and their strength is labor and sorrow; (...)
in the original it is [Rohebam] superbi^: why i^ the strength of our ears
called pride? because often times it enclineth to pride. Why the strength of
our years is called pride.
So [Rabha] to be drunk, signifies first, to be merry ad hilaritatem only,
as Genesis 43.34. and Job. 2.10. and Psalm. 23. Calix meus ebrius est, my cup
runs over, and this the Holy ghost allows; but there is another sort of
drunkenness which vergit in extremum, and this the Lord condemns. So in the
matter of marriage, for the man and the wife to be moderately drunk with
this love, the Lord allows this; but this excess of love which is betwixt
the whore and the harlot, this the Lord condemns.

Secondly, the pure love betwixt the man and the wife continues and endures,
The love betwixt the whore and the harlot is not permanent.
but the love betwixt the whore and the harlot is but for a short time,
therefore she says, Prove. 7.18. Let us take our fill of love until the
morning; it lasts but for one night, and then degenerateth into hatred, as
Amnon hated Tamar more then ever he loved her. 2. Sam. 13.15.

The third way how to keep and intertaine this love, is for the man to respect
his wife, The whore speaks disdainfully of her husband.
and the woman to honor her husband. Prove. 7.19. when the whore enticed the
young man unto her house, mark how disdainefully she speaks of her husband;
The man is not at home, in contempt she calls him the man, (...)
she calls him not [Bagnale] my lord, or [Isshi] my man; when once they turn
their hearts and affections from their husbands, then there is an open way made
for adultery; when the Scripture speaks of the husband Deuteronomy. 28.56 it calls
him vir sinus, because he sleeps in his wives bosom; The wife called the
wife of the bosom,
and those which we keep in our bosom we love them dearly, so the wife is
called uxor sinus. Micah. 7.5. who sleeps in her husbands bosom. So 2. Sam.
12.3. so she is called uxor adolescentiae ejus. Prove. 1.18. to remember what
love he bare to her in her youth, and therefore he should not despise her in
her age.

The fourth way to live chastely, Married persons are to bear with others
infirmities.
is to bear every one with the infirmity of others, this was the fault of Jobs
wife. Job. 19.17. My breath is strange to my wife.

The first way is, to remember the children gotten betwixt them, which should
be the pledges of their love. Job. 19.17. Although I entreated her for the
childrens sake of mine own bowels.

And as it is the way to keep them in holy wedlock when they are married, to
keep their vessels in purity before they be married; so to testify their
love, the widow after her husband is dead, she should live as a widow indeed
and not in pleasure. 1. Tim. 5.6. For then she is dead while she is alive; and
so the man should live chastely, until he be called to a new marriage, to
testify his love to his former wife; the women amongst the Jews when they
spoke of their husbands that were dead, they said, memoria ejus sicut vinum
Lebani.

They desired to be buried together.
Lastly, to testify their mutual love; of old, they desired to be buried
together; so was Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecka, Jacob and Rachel.

Of the punishment of adultery.
NExt unto spiritual adultery the Lord has punished this bodily whoredom;
the first world was drowned for this sin. Genesis 6.2, 3, 4. and for this sin
the Lord destroyed with the plague twenty four thousand. Number. 25.9. For this
sin the tribe of Benjamin was almost rooted out. Judge. 19.28. for this sin
David's house was punished both with incest and with blood.

As the Lord punished this sin himself, so he will have it punished by the
Magistrate; (...) Iniquitas Iudicum, id est, quaerenda, cognoscenda and
punienda a Iudicibus. (...) iniuria quae sit mihi.
in the days of Job it was c^pitall. Job. 31.11. For this is an heinous crime,
yea, [G^^avon pelilim] est iniquitas judicum, that is, that which the Judges
should punish; and not the iniquity which the Judges commit. So Genesis 16.5.
[Hhamasi] injuria mea, is not the injury which I do, but the injury which is
done to me, so in the days of Abimelech. Genesis 26.11. He that touches this
man or his wife, shall surely be put to death. So amongst the heathen it was
capital, as amongst the Egyptians, Joseph for suspected adultery, was put in
the prison with those who were executed; and in Babylon, Nebuchadnezzer roasted
the adulterous Priests in the fire. Ier. 29.22. and if we shall observe how
the jealous husband will not spare in the day of vengeance. Prove. 6.34. we
shall see what a just judgment befalls the adulterer, when the jealous
husband kills him in sudden passion, Allusion.
and Solomon alludeth to this, He goes after her straight way till a dart
strike through his liver. Prove. 7.23. and why through his liver? his liver was
the part of the body in which his unclean lust lodged, therefore the dart
pierces this part especially, and the part by which a man offends most, in
that he is most commonly punished.

The Egyptians used to cut off the nose and the ears of the Adulteress, and
the Prophet alludeth to this sort of punishment, Ezekiel. 23 25. They shall deal
furiously with thee; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears.

Commandment. VIII.
EXERCITAT I. Of theft in general.
Exodus 20.15. Thou shall not steal.
The Lord gives men the use of the earth, but not the absolute dominion of it.
DAvid says, The heaven, even the heavens are the Lords: but the earth has he
given to the children of men. Psalm. 115.16. He has given the earth to the
children of men, he has not given them the absolute dominion of the earth, for
that he has reserved to himself, he has given them but a subordinate
dominion, they hold all in capite of him, for the earth is the Lords, and the
fullness thereof, therefore every man must seek his daily bread of him, and
not be his own carver, but be content with that measure which the Lord
allotted to him.

Thieves will not be contented with that portion which the Lord allotteth unto
them, but they come like the serv^nts of Elies sons with their flesh hook in
their hand, and say, give me this; and if thou will not, I will take it by
force. 1. Sam. 2.

Ius Spirituale. Civil.

Man has a double right to the creatures; First, he has a spiritual right,
and then he has a civil right; a wicked and unregenerate man may have a
civil right to the creatures, The wicked may have a civil right, but not a
spiritual right.
because the sentence and the curse of the law is not yet executed upon them.
Luc. 6.35. God is kind unto the unthankefull and to the evil, and God grants
to them the use of these temporal things, for the maintenance of their civil
life; but the thief has neither a spiritual nor civil right to that which
he steals, and therefore he is twice a thief.

The thief sins both against justice, The thief sins against justice,
distributative and commutative.
and against charity; First, he sins against justice, both commutative and
distributive, he sins against commutative justice and gives not this for
this, but takes it either by violence, or by craft.

So he sins against distributive justice; see how David describes the
righteous man. Psalm. 112.9. He has dispersed, he has given to the poor, his
righteousness endures for ever; the righteous man disperseth to the poor,
and his righteousness endures for ever; that is, his alms and his good deeds
shall be had in remembrance here, and afterward shall receive him into
eternal tabernacles. Luc. 16.9. that is, they shall testify that he is to be
received into eternal tabernacles; the righteous scatters and the thief
gathers, his alms testify that he shall be received into eternal
tabernacles, but his theft deserves that he should be secluded from eternal
tabernacles.

Again, he sins against charity; The thief sins against charity.
and he runs into the breach of the sixth Commandment, as he does into the
eight; for when he takes away his neighbors goods, he takes away his life;
and therefore their goods are called their life. Luc. 8.43. She spent upon the
Physicians all her goods, in the Gree^e it is, (...), her whole life; because
her goods were the means to maintain her life; therefore they are called her
life.

Sin sweet in the beginning, but bitter in the end.
This sin at the first is very sweet to a man, but in the end it is very
bitter. Proverb. 20.17. The bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward
his mouth shall be filled with gravel: it is sweet to him for the present,
but the end of it is bitter. The devils alchymie is to change stones into
bread; Mat. 4.3. but the thieves alchymie is to turn bread into stones and
gravel; (...) Caput. Venenum.
SVGERE caput vipera quid.
as Achans theft was sweet to him at the first, but afterward it proved gravel
to him. Josh. 7. Caput viperae suget. Job. 20.16. When the female viper
engendereth with the male, the female sucketh the head of the male, and biteth
it off with great delight; then she conceives her young ones, which eat out
her belly. So when the thief steals the righteous man's goods, they seem
very sweet unto him, but in the end he smarteth for it; he sucketh the vipers
head at the first, but the brood gnaweth out his belly.

The conclusion of this is; as the Lord has a care that a man's first and
natural life be preserved: so he has a care that his second life be
preserved, that is, the means which should maintain his life.

EXERCITAT. II. What theft is. Commandment VIII.
Exodus 20.15. Thou shall not steal.
THeft is defined, The taking away of another man's goods against his will; and
it is committed either in ablato, or in deposito.

In ablato, When it is theft to take a thing without the consent of the owner.
when one takes away that which belongs to another against his will, then it
is theft. If the absolute and supreme lord himself give his consent, although
the owner or inferior lord give not his consent, yet it is not theft: as when
the Israelites took away the Egyptians earerings, and jewels, although they
had not the consent of the Egyptians to take them away, yet it was not theft;
because God himself, (...) Spolia^erunt Aegyptio^. (...) Est eripere praeda^.
who was the supreme Lord commanded them; therefore, Exodus 12.36. [vainatzelu
eth mizraijm,] they spoiled the Egyptians: they had as good right to these
jewels as the soldiers had to the spoil.

Secondly, a man may take another man's goods in in his necessity to supply his
mere wants; in this case the law makes things common; and although he have
not the consent of the owner, when he takes his goods; yet this is not theft.
In necessity a man may take another man's goods without his consent.
Before the fall all things were common among men, and ordained for man's
sustentation, and this division of goods was brought in but after the fall; and
therefore ought to give place to the first institution in a man's necessity to
save his life: for in the first estate every man might take as much would
suffice him, not doing wrong to another: so in this estate, a man may take as
much of another man's goods as to supply his necessity, without the owners
consent. A man might go into his neighbors vineyard, and ease as many grapes
as he pleased, jure charitatis, by the right of charity: but he might carry
none away with him, Iu. Charitatis. Proprietatis.

because he had not jus proprietatis; so David in his necessity eat the show
bread, 1. Sam. 21. and the Disciples pulled the ears of corn, Matt. 12. hence
it is that the poor are called [bagnale tobh] Lords of ^ther men's goods, Prove.
3.26. because in their necessity they have the right of charity to their goods:
The poor are lords of our goods in necessitio.
he has not here an absolute dominion or dominium rectum as the lawyers call
it, for they say, dominium anius rei penes plures in solidum jura non
patiuntur, that is, the law will not suffer that more shall have the absolute
dominion of one thing,



Dominus in solidum of it, for when he takes so much to satisfy his
necessite, he is bound to restore as much again if he be able; and therefore
some say, that things in such a case are rather communicanda, quam communia, to
be communicated, then common.

A man may have the tacit consent although not the express consent of the
owner.
Thirdly, when a man has the tacit consent of the owner to a thing, although
he have not his express consent, this is not theft; and this he does, when he
enjoys a thing by prescription.

Prescription what.
Modestinus the lawyer describes prescription after this manner, Est adjectio
dominij per continuationem possessionis a lege definiti.

First, it is called adjectio dominij, because the dominion is not gotten by
the direct consent of the former possessor, but by the law which presumes that
the former possessor had given his consent by his long secrecy in not claming
his own again. And as a custom differs from the law, so does the right by
prescription, from the right which a man gets directly with the possessors
consent; for custom is a secret consent for the most part, but the law is an
open and a clear consent.

And it is added per continuationem, for the law presumes, ^f he had enjoyed
it for a long space, and the possessou^ had not clamed his right, Lands
prescribe not when the owner does chal enge it within such time.
all this time, in that case the law says, that the possessor is willing to
quit his possession. Example of this we have, Judge. 11. 12.13. where Iephthe
pleaded, that the Israelites possessed that land by prescription three hundredth
years. So we have an example that the law prescribes not, when the possessor
challenges it within such a time, 2. King. 8.3. The widow that was absent from
her possession seven years amongst the Philistines, for famine, in this time
her land prescribed not, and the king commanded to restore it to her again.

Again, they must have a just title to this possession, Men must have a good
title in prescription.
or else it will never prescribe.

But it is against the law to take any thing from the right owner against his
will.

That which is taken from the owner by prescription, A twofold end of the Law.
There is the supreme end of the law, and there is the inferior end of of the
law; the supreme end of the law is this, that every man may have his own, and
that men may be certain of their possessions: now because the supreme end of
the law cannot be kept without the breach of the inferior end of the law; the
inferior end is neglected that the supreme end may be kept.

When a man then has the Commandment of God for his warrant, although he
take something from the owner against his will, that is no theft: so when he
takes by the law of nature in his necessity to supply his want, although the
owner consent not, yet it is not theft. So when he has the tacit consent of
the owner, and the approbation of the law by prescription, this is not theft.
In voluntarium. Per ignoranrantiam. Per violentiam. Secundum quid.

But when he takes a thing directly against the owners will, this is theft. It
is taken against the owners will, first by ignorance, as in secret theft;
secondly, by violence; thirdly, when it is partly taken against his will, and
partly with his will, as in usury.

Secondly, theft is committed in Deposito, in a thing committed to ones trust
and this is called [Pikkadon] or (...), (...) Depositum. (...).
Tim. 6.20. Levit. 6.2. If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the
Lord, and lie unto his neighbor, in that which was delivered to him to keep,
or in fellowship; in the Hebrew it is, in positione manus, for pone^e manum
significat societatem inire, apud Hebraeos, Exodus 22.11. P^sitto manus est
societa^^^ contractus apud Hebrae^^.
First, the case is set down, when he shall not make it good which is
concredited to him, if it be wanting; and then the case is set down, when he
shall make it good: if through his negligence the thing be stolen or lost, then
he is to make it good; if it be taken away secretly, he shall not make it
good, but an oath of the Lord shall be betwixt them. And Paul alludeth to this
form. 2. Tim. 1.12. I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
committed unto him against that day. God is that faithful depositarius, who
will keep our depositum faithfully, and we concredit the keeping of our
salvation unto him; Allusion.
that is called depositum, which is a matter of great weight, and it is
arrhabo, which is a part of the price that cannot be taken back again,
Depositum quid. (...) Arrhabo. (...) Respondere.
and to express the suerty of this keeping, David says, Psalm. 119.122.
[gnarobh gnabhdecha] subarrha servum tuum, be suerty for thy servant.

(...) Subarrha servum tuum.
The conclusion of this is, that which is taken from the owner against his will
is theft: it is theft to take a thing craftily from a man, but the greatest
theft of all, is to take a thing violently from him against his will, for here
the owner is altogether unwilling to give his goods, but when a man is craftily
over reached, it is not fully against his will that he gives his goods.

EXERCITAT. III. Of Oppression. Commandment. VIII.
1 Thessalonians. 4.6. Let no man go beyond or oppress his neighbor in any matter.
THeft is divided according to the time, according to the object, and according
to the manner.

According to the time, there is the night theft, Theft divided according to
the time.
and the day theft: if the thief came to steal in the night, then he might
be killed safely; but if he came to steal in the day time, they might not kill
him, Exodus 22.2.3.

Secondly, according to the object. If he steal holy things, that is called
sacrilege: as the theft of Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5.2. If he rob the
Commonwealth, that is called peculatus; if he steal cattle, that is called
abigeatus; such were the Chaldeans, who robbed Job of his goods; and such were
the Saracens, (...) irruere praedonum more. 1. Sam. 27. (...) Excurrere. (...)
vacuum esse.
because they lived by robberies and excursions, they were called Saracens from
[Sarak] excurrere which comes from [rik] vacuum esse; and the Seventy
translate them (...), such were the Ishmaelites, Genesis 37. which Targum Jonathan
translateth Arabians, and such were the Chaldeans, Hab. 1.7. If he had stolen
a man, that was called plagium, and such a one was to die the death, Exodus
21.16.

Again, theft is divided according to the manner, it was either public theft
or secret theft: if (...) was public, either by land or by sea, Theft divided
according to the manner.
by land when it was committed with an open and a high hand, the highest sort
of those are murdering thieves, who kill that they may rob, such were these
who lay betwixt Jerusalem, and Jericho. (...) Diabolus a (...) vastavit.
Luc. 10.30. those resemble most the devil Ashmodeus, who has his name a
[shadad] vastare, who spoyleth and spares none.

Robbery by sea is called piracie, Revelat. 12.12. Woe be unto the earth, and
to the sea, because the devil is come down to you, having great wrath: these
spirits are the devils factors who trouble the sea: Piracie what.
such were the barks of the Isles Pharos amongst the Egean islands called
(...), that is, little swift barks, or pinnages which came out secretly like
mice of the I Will Pharos to rob, and Lemnunculi, SHIPS of desire what.
little barks that came out of the I Will Lemnos to rob like the barks of
Dunkirk; and Job alludeth to these sorts of barks, My days pass as ships of
desire, Job. 9.26. that is, like the pirates pinn^ge which is very swift to
catch the prey.

(...) Vt abripuir.
Theft again is divided according to the manner, either to oppress by
violence, or by fraud, Levit. 19.13. by violence, that is called gazal, to
pluck a thing by violence out of ones hand, so it is said of Benajah, that He
plucked the spear out of the Egyptians hand. 2. Sam. 23.24. The second sort of
theft is to oppress by fraud; this is called [gnashak, (...) Fraud vel
oppressione detinuit, oppressit.
] and John the baptist forbids both those, Luke 3.14. Do violence to no
man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages: this sort of
theft comes of covetousness, Micah. 2.2. They covet fields and take them by
violence, and houses and take them away, so they oppress a man and his house,
even a man and his heritage.

Oppressors called hunters.
These violent oppressors are called hunters in the Scripture; ^imrod was a
mighty hunter, Genesis 10.8. that is, a mighty o^pressor. So Prove. 12.27. He shall
not roste that which he ^ooke in hunting: that is, which he has taken by
oppression.

They are compared to the lion, to the wolf, to the wild ass and to the
Gryphon, avis digitata, Oppressors compared to the lion, wolf, wild ass and
gryphon.
that has tallons, Ier. 12.9. First, they are compared to the lion, Psalm.
10.10. He croucheth and humbles himself, that the poor may fall by his
strong ones, that is, he croucheth and humbles himself, as if his strong
parts were weak and feeble, to make the poor fall, and as the lion coucheth
to catch the beast, and then leapeth upon it and divoureth it; so does the
mighty hunter oppresses the poor, Micah. 3.2. Who hate the good and love the
evil, Oppressors in the Scriptures are called ravenous beasts.
and pluck off their skin from of them, and their flesh from their bones, who
also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and they
break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh within
the caldron. So they are compared to wolves, Zeph. 3.3. Her princes within her
are roaring lions, her Judges are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones till
the morrow. Thirdly, they are compared to the wild ass, Job. 24.5. to show
their speediness and readiness to oppress and their readiness to fly away
when they have done, that they may escape the hand of the Magistrate. Fourthly,
they are compared to the Gryphon. Levit. 11.16. (...) Vultur. a (...)
violentia. (...)
who lives by rapine and therefore he is called tahhmas from hhamas violence,
and the Seventy translate it (...), ravenous kites. Then the holy Ghost
discribeth the persons whom they oppress, the poor, the widow, and the
fatherless, and these the Lord especially calls his people. Exodus 22.25. If
thou lend money to any of my people, that is, to the poor of my people, The
poor are called Gods people.
So Psalm. 14.4. They eat my people as bread, that is, the poor of my people;
they are (...), an^ worse, for they eat men when they are dead, but thos^
oppressors eat them while they are alive. When they rob the poor they rob
the Lord himself. So Job. ^4.3. They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
and they take the widows ox for a pledge; God promises to be a father to
the fatherless, and a Judge of the widows. Psalm. 68.5. they take the Ass of
the fatherless, that is, of him whom I have taken to be a father to, yet they
spare him not; and they take his Ass from him, that is, the beast which
serves him for greatest use. So they take the widows ox, (...) vidua ab
(...) silere.
the widow in the Hebrew is called [Almonah] from [Alam] mutum esse; she has
no body to speak for her, and they take her ox from her, the most necessary
beast for work, and therefore under the law he who took away a man's ox, he
was bound to restore five for him. Exodus 22.1. Then they take her only ox,
Simile.
which aggravateth their sin much, as Nathan tells David when he took the
man's only sheep. 1. Sam. 12. then under pretext of justice, as if the poor
widow were debtfull to them. Job. 22.9. They send away the widow empty. These
oppressors are the worst Physicians that can be, The merciless dealing of the
oppressor.
letting too much blood, and not taking away the superfluous humors, but the
thing necessary for their life; and these are called viri sanguinum, Psalm.
54.24. because they suck the substance from the poor, as it were their blood.
And Job. 24.10. They take away the gleanings from the hungry. The Lord
forbids expressly, Deuteronomy. 24.19. when they reap their fields to take away
their gleanings, but to leave them to the poor, the fatherless, and the
widow; but they misregarded the Lords ordinance, and took all away: So the
Lord commanded when they gathered the grapes of their vineyards, they should
not gleane afterward; but the oppressors took in all. Job. 24.6. The wicked
gat^er the vintage, Serotmare vineam quid.
and leave nothing to the poor, others expound Serotinare vineam, thus they
gather the grapes before they be ripe, to serve for the use of man in the end
of the corn harvest; and this aggravateth their sin more. Plutarch says,
that we condemn more the hornets and the waspes which sting men to death, then
we do wolves and lions; because these when they kill men, do not feed upon
their bodies, but the lions and the wolves feed upon them when they kill them:
To cut the vines before they be ripe and can serve for no use, that doubleth
the iniquity.

The conclusion of this is: Esaias. 31.13. Conclusion.
He that despises the gain of oppression, he shall dwell on the height of
high places, his place of defense shall be the munition of rocks, bread shall
be given him, and his water shall be sure: but oppressors, Ier. 17.11. are
like the Partridge that sits on eggs, and hatcheth them not; So he that
gets riches and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days,
and in the end shall be a fool.

EXERCITAT. IV. De furto palliato, or covered theft. Commandment. VIII.
Ier. 22.14. Woe be to him that cutteth out my windows, and it is seeled with
Cedar and painted with Vermilion.
FVrtum palliatum, or colored theft is, (...) Palliare pallium. Lev. 5.15. So
the Latins say, gaudere gaudium. Theft colored under pretense of religion.
when men cast a cloak or some pretense upon their theft. Timgnol magnal, when
a man is blinded, as if a cloak were cast about his eyes.

This colored theft is colored sundry wa^es; First, under the color of
religion, as those who bro^ght cattle and doves to the temple to be sold, and
changed their money there; they pretended that all this was done for the
service of God, that the people might have their sacrifices more ready at hand;
but Christ called this theft, Ye have made my house a den of thieves. Mat.
21.13.

Theft colored under pretense of charity.
Secondly, this sort of theft is colored under pretense of charity; as Judas
theft was; when he saw Mary pouring a box of ointment upon Christ's head, he
said, What needed this waste, might not this have been sold for so much, and
have been given to the poor? this he spoke (says the Evangelist) Not because
he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and
bare what was put therein. Mar. 12.5, 6.

Theft colored under pretense of merchandice.
Thirdly, this theft is colored under pretense of merchandice. Hos. 12.7. He is
a merchant, and the balance of deceit is in his hand, in the Hebrew it is, He
is a Cananite, and the balance of deceit is in his hand. He deceives the
buyer not openly, but under the pretense of equity, A Canaanite for a deceiver.
and he is called a Cananite, because the Cananites were given much to deceive
in buying and selling. So Ezekiel. 17.4. He cropped off the top of his young twigs,
and carried it [El eretz cenagnan] to the land of Canaan, (...)
that is, he carried Zedekias to Babylon, to the land of traffic, or to the
land which used deceit in their traffic.

Under pretense of law.
Fourthly, this sort of theft is colored under pretense of law; such was the
colored theft of Zacheus the Publican. Luc. 19.9. When he had taken men's
goods per (...), by forged cavillations; if any man had spoken any thing
against him, he accused them as wrongers of the law, and that he did nothing to
them contrary to the law.

Theft colored with fair pretenses.
Fifthly, when men color their theft under fair pretenses, such were these who
took out the seeling out of the house of God, and seeled their own houses
with it. Ier. 22.14. and that it might not appear to be the seeling of the
house of God, they painted it over with Vermilion; ye should have seen there
a fair and neat house, but the wood was stolen out of the house of God, and
handsomely painted over, that no man might know it.

Sixthly, theft is colored, Theft colored by deluding the senses.
when men's senses are deluded by sleight, and when coggers with the dice win
men's money from them, Allusion.
and the Apostle alludeth to this, Ephesians 4.14. Be not carried about with every
wind of doctrine by the sleight of men; (...), (...) Lusus aleae, ipse actus
ludendi alea seu tesseris. (...) caliditas, vafrities,
that is, with such sleights as they use at dice, and this is called
Stellionatus, couzenage; so when the simpler are overreached by the more
crafty, this is called (...), and he who is easily deceived this way is called
Pothe, (...) Simplex.
and therefore it is good to have the craft of the serpent with the simplicity
of the dove.

In all sort of bargaining, In bargaining the will must have the consent.
the will should have the full cons nt; now when the understanding is blinded
which determines the will, then the will cannot give the clear and express
consent: as in violent and open theft, the stronger overmatcheth the weaker; So
in covered theft, the crafty overreacheth the simpler.

Observe how God has always met this colored theft; God has punished
colored theft.
Jacob by colored theft took the birth right from Esau, but see how Laban
paid him home again, giving him Leah in stead of Rachel. So the Gibeonites by
craft deceived Joshua, but David and Solomon made their posterity servants and
drudges in the house of God. So Iehoiachim brought his kingdom to ruin, quia
commiscuit se cum ista cedro; because he meddled with the cedars of the house of
God, to seele his own house with them, Ier. 22.15. And thus the Lord, Psalm.
18.2^. 2 Samuel 22 27. est (...) sed Psalm. 18.26. (...) cum perverso perverteris,
sic, cretizat cum Crete^sibus.
shows himself froward with the froward, and craft e with the crafty: but
2. Sam. 22.27. the letters are transposed when the same matter is handled, to
note some singular thing in this, how the Lord changes himself to these
subtle and crafty deceivers, and takes them in their own craft; the greatest
victory, that is, to kill a man with his own sword. David said of Goliahs
sword, There is no sword like to that. 1. Sam. 21.9.

The conclusion of this is: The Lord who abhors hypocrisy in our religion,
lying in our speech, and that a man should not wear a woman's apparel; so
does he likewise abhor and detest covered theft.

EXERCITAT. V. Of Usury. Commandment. VIII.
Psalm. 15.5. He that puts not out his money to usury, shall never be moved.
Usury is a colored sort of theft, and it is expressed by diverse names in the
Scriptures. First, it is called [Neshek] biting, (...) Morsus. (...) Serpens.
and by allusion and change of letters, it may be called [Nahhash] a serpent.:
For as Chrysostom marketh well upon the fifth of Matthew, the money of the
usurer is the biting of the serpent Aspis; for he that is stung with this
serpent, feels no pain for the present, but a certain tickling and delight;
then he falls in a sleep, and in the mean time, Simile.
the venom of the serpent spreads it self through ^is body, comes to his
heart, and so kills him. So he who borrows money from the usurer, thinks
^t sweet, but it consumes the whole substance, and bri^geth a man to poverty,
(...)
it is called also [Tarbith] and [Marbith] multiplication, because it
multiplieth, and the Chaldee calls it [Hhabbulah] perditio, because it
destroys a man's substance, and the Greeks call it (...) pario. Ier. 5.27. As
a cage is full of birds, (...) a (...) pario.
so are their houses full of deceit; therefore they are waxen rich. Mark the
comparison; as the fowler sets a trap to catch the birds, (which is called
decipula a decipiendo) he scatters a little corn to ensnare the birds, and
then catches them in a trap: So the house of the usurer draws the poor man
as to a snare, he sees some hope of gain at the first, like a little handful
of corn scattered before the birds; but in the end it proves but a snare to
him.

Now that we may find out what usury is, we must do as they who carve out
Images, they cut off this and this to make it that; so must we proceed in
finding out what usury is, it is not this nor that, but it is this, and then we
come to the definition of it.

First, Usury cannot be found out by the persons who borrow, nor by things
lent, nor by the law.
we cannot find it out by the persons to whom we are forbidden to lend on
usury, as thou shall not lend on usurie to the poor of my people, or, thou
shall not lend upon usury to thy brother a Jew.

Secondly, we cannot find it out by things lent, as thou shall not lend upon
usury, money, corn or wine. Deuteronomy. 23.19. for there is usury also in other
bargains.

Thirdly, neither can it be found out well by the restraint of the law, as that
is usury which is forbidden by the law; wherefore to come by the nature of it,
is to define it, and so we shall know what it is.

It may be said, Deuteronomy. 23.19, 20. Thou shall not lend upon usury to thy
brother, unto a stranger thou may lend; therefore it may seem not to be a
moral law.

By stranger here is meant only the Canaanite, (...) excluso pro (...)
extraneo isti, id est, reliquis istis Cehananaeorum.
thou may lend usury to that stranger; that is, to the Canaanite whom thou
art to destroy, [Lanochre pro leanochre] Contra quem jus belli est, contra eum
jus usurae; and that it is not meant of every stranger it is clear. Psalm.
15.5. He that puts not out his money to usury, the best interpreters of the
Jews add, etiam Gentili.

The Jews hard dealing with the Christians, condemned.
Wherefore the practice of the Jews at this day, who take usury of us
Christians counting us strangers, is condemned by their fathers who lived long
since; the Jews call us Christians, Edomites: Esau was Jacobs brother, and if
we be Edomites, then they should take no usury of us, because we are their
brethren.

If thou lend money to any of my people, that is poor by thee, thou shall not
be to him as an usurer. Exodus 22.25. here it may seem that they might lend unto
the rich upon usury, but not to the poor.

The poor are called Gods people in a special manner.
The meaning of the place is, Thou shall not lend upon usury to my people, but
especially to the poor of my people, for God calls the poor his people
after a special manner. Psalm. 14.4. They eat up my people as they eat bread,
that is, the poor; they are his people, both because they are within the
covenant, as also in respect of their estate and condition, because they are
poor, the Lord takes the protection of them.

Secondly, Thou shall not lend to the poor of my people upon usury, therefore
ye may lend to the rich, this will not follow. Ye shall not curse the deaf,
nor put a stumbling block before the blind. Levit. 10.14. therefore ye may
curse him who hears, or ye may put a stumbling block before the seeing, this
will not follow.

Again, we cannot find out this usury by things lent upon usury, as money,
victuals, etc. Deuteronomy. 23.19.

pecunia non est lucrativa, money of it self cannot make gain, therefore no
gain should be taken ^or it.

Mat. 25.20. Behold I have gained five talents more; and therefore money is
called (...) vel (...), which is put out to use; but when it is hid in the
ground and put to no use; then it is pecunia (...) and otiosa, money that
makes no gain.

Some say that husbandry is secundum naturam, praeter naturam, but usury is
contra naturam.

Biting usury is contra naturam; contra naturam, against nature.

No gain should be taken for that which perishes in the use, as money, corn,
wine, etc.

Money, corn and wine perish in the use, Non vi contractus perit, sed ratione
rei, and it perishes in the use altogether to the lender: therefore the
borrower is bound to the lender to make it good.

As this were great wrong to seek fruit of that bread,

But this clears not the doubt, for they seek no profit, pro hoc individuo
quod perit, but for the same in kind.

Thirdly, Usury cannot be found out by the restriction of municipiall laws.
we cannot find it out by the limitation of municipicall laws, for they vary
very much, and they rather restrain the abuse of it, than they allow it; they
tolerate it for the necessity of the people, but they restrain it, lest they
should too far exceed in taking usury, Simile.
and this law cannot be a fit rule to permit like to be taken in every place;
for as a Physician cannot let blood of all his patients alike, but takes of
some more, and some less; So Princes deal with their subjects, according to
their riches or poverty.

They who limitate it to the sum; first, they condemn simply decimam usuram,
which in the space of an hundred months equalleth the sum, that is ten of
the hundred; What usury condemned.
such was the usury of the Jews. Secondly, they condemned usuras usurarum; It
is observed that the beasts which are most imperfect, superfaetant, and they
will be breeding young ones, they will have young ones in their belly, and they
will have young ones sucking them, all at once. So these usurers multiply gain
upon gain, and superfaetant, which is a most unperfect kind of birth. So they
condemn monthly usury, Hosea alludeth to this, Allusion.
A month shall devour them wiih their portion. cap. 5.7. Aristophanes
reports how the people of Greece were much troubled with this monthly usury,
and they desired that the witch Medea might cause the moon to stand still with
her enchantments, that so she might not come so often about in her
revolutions, and they be forced to pay their monthly usury.

What usury the Romans allowed.
The Romans allowed unciarium faenus, or centesimam usuram, twelve in the
hundred, and this was called haereditas ex ass, vel centesima, because their
Libra was divided in twelve parts, they might not take then Sextans, two of the
whole sum, or Triens, three of the whole sum; or quadrans, four^ of the
whole sum; or quincunx, five of the whole, as Joseph did. Genesis 41.34. or
semis, the half of the whole; or septunx, the seventh part of the whole; or
bes, the eighth part of the whole; or dodrans, the ninth part of the whole,
dempto triente; or dextans dempto sextante, taking away two from twelve, or
deunx, dempta uncia, to take all except one part.

The law of the twelve tables forbad all usury except unciar^^m ^aenus, one of
twelve; and according to our reckon^ng is 8. and. Then rogaetione tribunitia ad
semiunc^alem redacta est, it was restrained to the sixth part of the whole; and
according to the English to four of the hundred and 1/16. and at last, they
forbad it altogether, and posuerunt furem condemnari duplo, faenoratorem
quadruplo; they ordained that a thief should pay two fold, but an usurer
should pay four fold.

Some Emperors have abolished usury altogether, Some Emperors have abolished
usury altogether.
and some have permitted it; Leo the Emperor discharged it altogether, but
Anastasius was glad to permit it again, at the earnest suit of the people of
Constantinople.

We have not found out as yet what this usury is; usury is a lending for gain,
only vi mutui, this sort of lending is not lending at all; for lending must be
free for a time, as a gift is simply free: to lend, and not freely to lend, is
not to lend. A thing is attributed three manner of ways, as they say in the
schools; univoce, analogice, O nothing is attributed three ways.
and aequivoce; either properly, by way of analogy, or improperly. Example,
this word God is attributed to God properly; to the Magistrate, by way of
analogy. Psalm. 82.6. I said ye were Gods, and to the devil improperly. 2 Cor.
4.4. In whom the God of this word has blinded the minds of them.

Example 2. this word Satan is properly attributed to the devil, and by way of
analogy to Judas. Job. 6.70. Aliquid attribuitur. Vnivoce. Equivoce. Analogice.

and to Peter improperly. Mark. 8.33. Get thee behind me Satan.

Example 3. This word father is spoken properly of the natural father, who
begets his child; by way of analogy it is given to Preachers. 1. Cor. 4.15.
and improperly it is given to Idols: Ier. 2.27. They say to the stock thou art
my father. So this word to lend, is taken properly, when a man lends freely,
looking for no gain. Luc. 6.35. So thou shall lend unto many nations and thou
shall not borrow. Deuteronomy. 28.12. Secondly, by way of Analogy, as when we say,
lend me your helping hand; and thirdly, aequivoce or improperly, to lend for
gain.

Again; to lend for gain is to sell their charity, gratis accepistis, gratis
date; Mat. 10.8. that which men freely receive, they should freely give; as
when Gehazi sold that gift which was given freely.

Usury what.
Usury is, to make simply a bargain or contract of gain, whether the borrower
have made gain or it or not; this is exacting usury; see Psalm. 109.11. Nehem.
5.7. Deuteronomy. 15.2.3.

To make a contract this way, I will have gain simply for my loss, that is
not a lawful bargain, and that is usury: but if it be made this ways, I will
have gain if you make any gain, 1 (...) meum est meum and tuum est tuum. 2
(...) meum est meum and tuum est meum. 3 (...) meum est tuum and tuum est meum.
4 (...) meum est tuum and tuum est tuum. Ob.
this is no usury, for this is lawful in societate contractus; so if ye lose
I will lose, this is no usury; but simply to make the contract thus, I will
have gain whether ye have loss or gain, this is biting usury, 2. Cor. 8.13.
I mean not that other men be eased and ye be burdened, but that there be an
equality: and the Jews mark that there be four sorts of men; the first are
they who say, thine is thine, and mine is mine; such are they who live only by
themselves, having no society with others.

The second are they, who say, mine is mine, and thine is mine; those are
robbers and oppressors.

The third sort be they who say, mine is thine, and thine is mine, as those who
lend and borrow for gain.

The fourth sort are those, who say, mine is thine, and thine is thine; and
such are true Israelites, who lend to their brother Looking for nothing again,
Luc. 6.35.

Exodus 21.19. If he rise again and walk upon his staff, then shall he that
smote him be quit, only he shall pay for his time; that is, the loss of his
time, because he might have gai^ed so much in this time. Why then may not a
man tal^e gain for laying out of his money.



Gregory Nissen speaking against the usurers, says, Gregorius Nissen.
Vsurarius nescit laborem agrorum colendorum, mercaturam non exercet, sed uno
loco considens immanes domi suae feras nutrit, vult omnia sibi marata, and sin^
satu gigni, cujus aratrum est calamus, ager charta; semenatramentum; pluvia,
tempus quod illi pecuniae fructum auget occultis incrementis, falx est illa rei
repetitio, and area est domus, in qua miserorum fortunas ventilat, that is, The
husbandry of the unsurer.
the usurer has no skill to labor the ground, he knows not how to play the
merchant, but sitting still in one place, he nourishes a company of wild
beasts in his house, he will have all things to grow, and to bring forth
without plowing or sowing, his plough is his pen, his ink is his seed, the
paper is his field, and time is the latter rain which makes his corns to
grow, and the sicle is the exaction of his usury, and his house is the barn in
which he winnoweth the poor man's goods.

The Ammonites and Moabites might not enter into the congregation of the Lord,
Usurers are more injurious to the poor then the Ammonites were to the
Israelites.
even to their tenth generation, because they met not the people of God wi^h
bread and water, in the way when they came out of Egypt, Deuteronomy. 23.4. how shall
these miserable wretches the usurers enter into the Lords Tabernacle, who not
only withholds bread and water from the poor, the Lords people, but also do
take from them that which should sustain their life.

These biting usurers were so abhorred in the primitive Church, that as they
condemned the usurer himself; so they made the Scribes who wrote the bonds,
and also the witnesses, incapable of any be^efit; and that no testament or
latter will, written by such should be valide. The house of the usurer was
called Domus Satanae; and they ordained that no man should eat or drink with
such usurers, nor fetch fire from them, and after that they were dead, that
they should not be buried in Christian burial.

Ezekiel. 18.13. this sin is matched with theft: and Verse. 10. with adultery,
and Verse. 11. with violence, it is the daughter of oppression, and sister to
Idolatry, and he that does these things shall not dwell in Gods holy hill,
Psalm. 15. Albeit those worldlings think themselves more honest then thieves
and adulterers, yet the Lord makes their case all alike.

Secondly, although the usurer by his usury get that by usury and unjust gain
increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the
poor, Prove. 28.8. and Job says, that though he (that is, the oppressor or
usurer) heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; he may
prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the
silver.

And they applied that place, Prover. 15.27. He that hates gifts shall live:
that is, he that takes usury for his money, for to take gifts is to take
usury. Psalm. 15.5. He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes
reward upon the innocent: in the Hebrew it is, that takes not gifts freely for
his money: but he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; that is,
brings both his house and posterity to ruin, for usury is like a canker or
moth that consumes all that a man can gain.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of Sacrilege. Commandment VI.
Sacrilege is colored theft for the most part, under some pretense of law.

It is defined thus; Sacrilege what.
Sacrilege is an inverting and turning of those things to other uses, which
were dedicated to God and his service; as when they bought and sold in the
Temple, they made it a den of thieves: such was the sacrilege of Ananias,
quando intervertit aliquid, when he changed something which was dedicated to a
holy use, to his own private use, Act. 5.2.

The Prophet Malachi speaks much against this sin of sacrilege, Will a man
rob God? What it is to rob God.
yet ye have robed me, Malac. 3.8. the very term seemed so odious to the
Jews, that they straight way denied, and they tell the Prophet, that they had
committed no such sin, Wherein have we robbed thee? Great injury to rob God.
the Prophet answered them, In tithes and offerings, as if he should say, does
it not content you, to withold from man his right; but ye will rob God also?
what a sin is it for children to rob their parents? God is your father, and
the Church is your mother, will ye be so unnatural children as to rob them,
God hates wrongs against whomsoever they be committed. Solomon says, The
righteous man regards the life of his beast, Prover. 12.10. How great a wrong
is it then, to offer wrong to a man, who is like to o^r selves? And if the Lord
commanded us to help our enemies beast; much more to help our brother. 1.
Cor. 6.6. A brother goes to law with brother, if no injury may be offered to a
brother, much less to a superior, and that to a high superior: When Shimei
railed against David, what said Abishai: What does this dead dog rail
against the King? The sin of sacrilege exaggerated.
let me go I pray thee, and cut of his neck, 2. Sam. 16.9. The injury is yet
aggravated, if there come respectus beneficij, in respect of the great favor
and kindness shown by him to those who offer him injury: but when contempt
is joined with the injury, that exaggerateth the sin most of all: when Joseph
had feasted his brethren, Genesis 37. and then to steal his cup, what great
injury is this? How can we open our mouths in this behalf.

But when men leave off to sin against men, and begin to wrong God himself,
to sin against the heavens; this is a great sin. Esaias. 7.13. Is it a small
thing that ye will weary men, but ye will weary my God also? he is not our
inferior, he is not our equal, but he is our superior and that in the
highest degree; what great sin is it then to rob him? the Saints of God have
been of another mind, Psalm. 116.12. What shall I render to God for all his
benefits, and not only the Godly, but also the hypocrites. Mic. 66.



Why the Lord required the tith of them who dwelt in Canaan.
The earth is the Lords and all that is therein, Deuteronomy. 10.14. Psalm. 24.1. And
God the father gave his son the ends of it for a possession, Psalm. 2.8. God
the son again substituted under the law, the Priests, the Levites and the
poor for his deputies, and he would have the Jews, as his tenants and
farmars, to pay a duty in homage to him. When God gave the earth to Abraham
and to his seed, he received a tith of him in signu^ universalis dominij, in
token of his absolute dominion. Pharaoh, when he had gotten the whole land of
Egypt in his hand, Joseph took a fifth part of the increase for him: Genesis
41.34. but God dealt more liberally with the Jews, he sought but the tenth
part from them, although all was his own. So God now under the Gospel will
have men to honor him with their substance, and to give of their riches for
the maintenance of his worship.

What was the difference betwixt things dedicated,

For the better understanding of this, Difference betwixt things dedicated
under the law, and things given for holy uses under the gospel.
we must mark that there was a twofold dedication under the law: First when
they dedicate the property to God, but not the use, as their new houses, Deuteronomy.
20.5. So Psalm. 30. in the inscription. They did this as in dwellers in
Emmanuels land, and it was a curse to them if they dwelt not in their new
houses, they were loci ut sic to them, (as the Schoolmen speak) but our
houses are loci ut loci only. When we dwell in our new houses, Sanctificatio
In vocativa. Constitutiva.

we pray to God, that he would bless us in them, but this is invocativa
sanctificatio only, and not constitutiva. We hold our houses of him who is
Lord of the whole earth; but we hold them not of him in type, as they who
dwelt in Canaan, it is not a curse now if a man build a new house and dwell not
in it.

The second sort of dedication was, when the Jews resigned to the Lord both
the property and the use of those things which they consecrated and dedicated.
As when Arauna the Iebusite dedicated the ground for building of the Temple,
when Arauna did separate that part of the ground for that holy use, it was both
dedicated and designed. But a man under the Gospel; when he gives a plot of
ground for a religious use, it ^s not for the dedication of the ground that the
Church accepts of it, but only because it is a fit piece of ground for such
an use, and the man is willing to give it.

The dedication again under the law was such, A great diff^^ent betwixt the
dedication of our Temples, and the Temple of Jerusalem.
that the thing dedicated might not be transferred to another use; the ground
upon which the Temple stood was so dedicated that they might not build a temple
in another place, neither for commmodity or ease of the people, as Jeroboam
did, 1. King. 12.26. but under the Gospel, where a place is designed for the
worship of God, it may be changed to a more commodious place; it is not the
dedication then that makes it a permanent place, but a commodity only.

Goliahs sword was given to David, and the show bread to relieve his necessity.

Things dedicated under the Law differed from things dedicated under the
Gospel.
yield further, even to the ease and commodity of man, the Temple it self
might not be changed to any other place, neither for the commodity, nor ease of
the people, because it was the maine type and wardrobe of all the ceremonies,
therefore it was sacrilege to turn it to any other use.

It was unlawful to change things dedicated under the law to the service of
God, to any other use, Prove. 20.25. it is a snare for a man to devour that
which is holy, and after vows to enquire. Athalia took the pole money that
was appointed for the service of God, and did dedicate it to Baal.



In what respect sacrilege is greater now then under the Law.
If ye will respect the thing consecrate, it was a greater sin to rob God
under the Law, then now; but if ye will respect them who commit the sin, it
is a greater sin now, because men now, have greater knowledge under the
Gospel, than they had under the Law. Example, if a rich man should steal but
one sheep from a poor man, it were a greater sin in respect of the person,
then if a poor man should steal ten sheep from a rich man; but comparing one
sheep and ten sheep together; it is a greater sin to steal ten sheep then
one.

Things given to idolatrous uses should be turned to good uses: Example, Things
dedicated to Idolatrous uses may be changed into ho y uses.
our forefathers bestowed tithes to idolatrous uses for the most part, and
there were two causes moved them to do this, the impulsive cause, and the
final cause; the impulsive cause, which moved them in time of ignorance and
blindness, Causa Impulsiva. Finalis.

to give some thing to the Church, was to pray for the dead, and other
superstitious uses; yet the final cause was still to serve God, as may be
seen in their evidences and donations, which ever bear this clause, Deo and
Ecclesiae, before they make any mention of Saint, or other superstitious uses.
The final cause cease not, neither the effect, although the impulsive cause
cease, therefore those things which have been Idolatrous may be turned to holy
uses.

The temple was the house of prayer, How the Temple was a house of prayer.
not only because they prayed in it, but also because the Lord promised to
hear them for the Temples sake, therefore it was sacrilege in them to make
this house a den of thieves.

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
let us learn to honor God with our substance. Prove. 3.9. there are many now
who fall down before the Lord, but they fall not down as the three wise men
did, who offered gold, myrrh, and incense to him, Matt. 2.11. but they are
far worse who rob him; See the judgments that lighted upon Shishak king of
Egypt, Athalia and Nebuchadnezzer, Antiochus, and Crassus, for robbing the
Temple of God.

EXERCITAT. VII. That every man should have a lawful calling, Commandment.
VIII.
Ephesians. 4.28. Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him work with
his hands the things that are good.
The affirmative part of this Commandment.
TO preserve men from theft and unjust dealing, first he must have a calling;
secondly, a lawful calling; Thirdly; he must be diligent in his calling; and
lastly, he must continue in his calling.

A man must get his bread with the sweat of his brow, or with the grief of his
mind.
First, he must have a calling; he must get his bread with the sweat of his
brows, or with the grief of his mind; with the sweat of his brows, as those
who labor with their hands; and with the grief of his mind, as those who
rule and govern others: he must either do as the eye does, which directs
the body; or as the hand does, which works for the body. The Doctors of the
Jews had some callings, The Doctors of the Jews had some trades.
as Paul was a tent maker, and some of them were tanners, and bakers, and
Christ himself was a carpenter until he was thirty years of age, Mark. 6.3.
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary. The Jews have a proverb in the
^almud, Bona est doctrina legis, and via terrae; they call via terrae, some
trade, it is good to be a Doctor of the Law, and likewise to have some trade
with it.

Beggars have no calling, it was in the decaying estate of the commonwealth of
Israel when they were suffered to beg; Querere panem quid apud Hebraeos.
(...) the impotent beggar, (...) the sturdy beggar.
the Hebrews call this, quaerere panem, that is, to beg, Job. 15.23. Psalm.
37.25. bread here, does not signify all things comfortable for the life of
man, but the basest things for the entertainment of his life. 1 Samuel 2.5. They
that were full, have hired out themselves for bread, that is, for the meanest
things to sustain their life, (...) Ostiatim petentes. (...) ab (...)
desiderare, petere.
and such are called [Machasir gnal hepatachim] ostiatim petentes, Marc. 10.46.
when men willingly profess poverty, this is not a lawful calling; such were
[ebjonim] the Ebionites, and such are the begging friars.

Secondly, he must have a lawful calling. Ephesians. 4.28. Let him work with his
hands the things which are good.

Some callings are honorable in themselves, as the ministry, 1. Tim. 5.17.
Secondly, Some callings are honorable in themselves, and some praise worthy.
some are praiseworthy in themselves, but honorable only in respect of the
end, Eccles. 38.1. Honora medicum propter necessitatem; he is to be praised
for the skill which he has, but when he cures the body, that it may be a fit
instrument for the soul, this makes him honorable.

Thirdly, some are only praiseworthy, as (...), Some callings praise worthy.
those who live by handy trades; when the virtuous woman spinneth, and makes
clothes to her husband; then she is praised in the the gates of the city,
Prove. 30. but no calling is to be termed sordide, or base, as the Moralists
term them.

Such callings are lawful, callings used by the holy men of God are lawful.
(...) rermutare. (...) Lampas, fax taeda
which the holy men of God have used, as Alphaeus in the syriacke is called
hhalphus, from [hhalaph] permutare, to change; he was (...), numularius, a
changer of money; and John calls those (...), changers of small money, ^oh
2.14. So Debora was the wife of Lapidoth, a lamp maker, so Lydia was a seller
of purple; Joseph a carpenter; Simon a tanner, and Paul a tentmaker.

To detest any lawful calling is a great sin, No lawful calling to be
detested.
as the superstitious Egyptians, detested all sheepeheards, because they both
kept sheep, and killed them, which the Egygtians honored as their gods: and I
take this to be the reason why it is said, Genesis 39.6. That Potipher left all
that he had in Joseph's hands, W^y Pharaoh would not suffer Joseph to touch his
meat.
and he knew naught that he had, save the bread which he did eat, that is,
he would not suffer him to touch his meat, for he held him to be an unclean
Hebrew, because he eat the flesh of sheep and oxen. So the Jews detest all
Physicians, they have a proverb in the Talmud, Optimus inter medicos ad
gehennam. To gather tribute is a thing lawful, and yet the Jews hated all the
Publicans who gathered it: so they would not suffer a painter to dwell amongst
them: and this is the fault of most of our gentry, when they speak of handie
trades, they speak basely of them, they cannot suffer their children to be
brought up in any such trade, therefore their children when they come to age,
say with him in the Gospel, Dig I cannot, and to beg I am ashamed. Luc.
16.3. therefore I will falsify my masters account.

Call^ngs against the first Commandment.
Callings which are not lawful to be used, are such as are breaches of the
commandments, as the man who kept the damsel, that had the spirit of
divination, because of the gain which she made to him by her divination, Act.
16.16. So those in Ephesus, who professed curious arts, Act. 19.19. So the
mourning women who mourned, Ier. 9.17. having no hope of the resurrection,
these callings were against the first Commandment.

Callings against the second Commandment.
Against the second Commandment, to make silver shrines to Diana, Act. 19.24.
So those superstitious callings which the Jews have found out, and which they
sell for money in their synagogues at this day, as the office of Gelilah,
Buxtorfius in synagoga lu^^a^ca, Cap. 22.
to open the roll of the law, and to wrap it up again: So the office of
Hagbaach, to carry about and elevate the book of the Law: so the office of
Etzchaijm, to touch the pieces of the wood unto which the volume of the Law is
fastened. So the superstitious callings in the Church of Rome, all those are
against the second Commandment.

Against the sixth Commandment, Callings against the sixth Commandment.
to use a trade to hurt, or put out the life of man, such were those Sicarij,
Act. 21.38. who wore Cutlishes, only to stab men, and not as we do, to defend
our selves.

Against the seventh Commandment, to keep a bandy house, Number. 25.8. Callings
against the seventh Commandment. (...) Prostibulum, Lupanar.
So to live by prostituting of their body, Thou shall not bring the hire of a
whore, Deuteronomy. 23.18. The Seventy translate it (...), that is, she who continues
in prostituting her body for gain. So the calling that has affinity with this
sin, or can hardly be discharged without this sin, should not be used; as
for a woman to be a taverner; see the affinity betwixt the whore and the
taverner; first, (...) alere. (...) Scortatus est. (...).
[zun] in the Hebrew is called one that sells victuals, and [zanah] is called
Scortari: Secondly, (...), signifies to sell victuals, and scortari, so among
the Latins, mereor signifies to sell, and meretrix, a whore, and meritoria,
were the places where they sold victuals. Rachab was called (...), a taverner,
but James calls her an harlot, Iam. 2.25. Heb. 11.31.

So against the eight Commandment, Callings against the eight Commandment.
the biting usurer, a trade against this Commandment, and the alchymists, who
make men believe that they can change brass or any other metal into gold:
one said well of this trade, ejus initium est scire, medium ment^^i, and finis
m^ndicare: that the beginning of it was a desire of knowledge, the midst of it
a lie, and the end of it is begging. Et chymia est casta meretrix, and multos
invitat, ^eminem admittit, that Chymia is a chaste whore, alluring many to come
to her, but suffers none to touch her. So (...), or proxineta, that goes
betwixt the buyer, and the seller; and makes the buyer to buy the dearer; he
was called so, because he hung out a sign to draw men to buy: from (...), the
sign of the Vintner, So (...), was he who engrossed all to his own use, and
carried it out of the country. For this Nahum calls the merchants of Ninive
bruchos, the kankerworme, bruchus is a kind of locust which consumes all, and
then flies away. Nahum. 3.16. Thirdly, (...), which are called Dardanarij by
the Latins, who keep up the corn until it be scarce, that they may sell it
at a dearer rate, hence came Dardanariae arts, Prove. 11.26. He that
withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him, but blessing shall be upon the
head of him that sells it.

Callings against the nineth Commandment.
Against the ninth Commandment, are jesters which the Greeks call (...), or
(...), Hos. 7.3. They made the kings heart merry with their lies; they were
called (...), because they used all the members of their body to make sport.

Thirdly, men must be diligent in their calling, Prove. 6.6. Solomon wills
sluggards to go to the ant, that Provideth her meat in the summer, and
gathers her food in the harvest, and moreover he says, that she has no
guide, overseer, or ruler. Solomon sets down here all sorts of government:
(...)
First, Katzin in aristocracie, and then shoterim in democracie, and moshel in
monarchy; the ant has none of those rulers, and yet she provideth well in
summer for the winter; the sluggard that has all these commanders, or at the
least lives under some of them, should learn to be diligent in his calling:
Solomon goes not far off to seek a master to teach him, but one that is
ready at hand, and the basest of all the creatures. ^rov. 10.4. He becomes
poor that deals with a slack hand, but [jad hharzttim] the hand of the
diligent makes rich. (...) a (...) effodere.
[hhazatz] is to dig in the ground for gold: he that is as diligent in his
calling, as a man who diggeth for gold in the earth, that man shall become
rich, Prove. 22.29. See thou a man diligent in his calling, (...) Coram
obscuris.
he shall stand before kings; non stabit [liphne hhashim,] coram obscuris, that
is, before the meaner and baser sort who were clothed in soyled black.

Lastly, men must continue in their calling, Men should continue in their
callings.
and not change from one calling to another. 1. Cor. 7.20. Let every man abide
in the same calling wherein he was called, the Jews give an example of one
Meyr who changed his calling often: First, he was [hanechtom] a baker: again,
he changed that calling, (...) Pistor. (...) Calcearius. hence comes sandals.
(...) Scriba.
and he be came [sandalat] a shoemaker: Thirdly, he left that calling, and
he became [sopher] a scribe: and lastly, he became [megnabhed gnoorth] a
skinner; and they said of this Meyir, hhalaph Meyir eth melachoth velo
gnorocushi, Mutat Meyir artem suam, sed non pellem mutat Ethiops, (...) Pellio
vel qui concinnat pelles.
they meant that Meyir continued still a knave although he changed from one
trade to another.

A man may change his calling, When a man may change his calling.
first if the Lord call him to another calling, as when he called Elisha from
the plough, to be a Prophet. So he called the Apostles from fishers, to be
fishers of men. So if they be called by the commonwealth, and have gifts for
their calling, they may change their calling; but they must not change their
calling only for gain, as the posterity of Eli did, who said, Put me into the
Priests office that I may eat bread, 1. Sam. 2.36. they desired to be Priests
only for gain, for a piece of silver, and a morsel of bread.

As a man is bound to use a lawful calling, and to be diligent in his calling:
so he must have a care to keep that which he has gained in his lawful
calling therefore, Prove. 6.1. Solomon says, If thou be suerty for thy friend,
if thou have stricken hands with the stranger, thou art snared with the words
of thy mouth, deliver thy self as a roe from the hand of the hunter [im
takaguta] Si defixisti manum tuam; (...)
If thou have stricken hand with the stranger, Job. 17.3. Who is he that will
strike hands for me; that is, who will give his word for me, giving his hand
for my hand; this the Greeks of old called (...), is that part which joyneth
the hand to the arm, The forms which they used when they became suerty.
which we call the wrest; and they used when they gave their word for another,
to give them their wrest to be bound, whereby they signified, that they were
bound now for him, for whom they had given their word. There is a difference
betwixt vas and pr^s: The difference betwixt vas and praes.
he was properly called vas, who gave his word for him who was ready to be
carried to judgment; and praes was he who gave his word for the debt; all sort
of suretiship is not condemned, but rash suretiship; be thou not amongst those
that strike the hand, that is, be not thou one of those who usually strike the
hand. Ruben gave his word for Benjamin; and Paul gave his word for Onesimus;
Christ was both our praes and our vas; he was vas presenting himself before
the judge for us, All sorts of su^rtiship not forbidden.
there he gave his word for us. Psalm. 119.122. Subarrha servum tuum; be suerty
for thy servant: and so he was praes for us, paying our debt.

The conclusion of this is, He that will not work, neither should he eat, 1 Thessalonians. 3.10.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Of commutative justice. Commandment VIII.
Levit. 19.30. Just balances, just weight, a just Epha, a just hin shall ye
have; I am the Lord.
THe Lord craveth in this commandment that men exercise justice, both
commutative and distributive.

God who made all things, pondere, numero and mensura. Wisd. 11. has commanded
just dealing in weight, number* and measure, and he adds; I am the Lord,
putting his subscription to it. There are two sorts of Magistrates, the one is
magistratus loquens, Magistratus Loquens. Mutus.

the other is magistratus mutus; the one a dumb magistrate, the other a
speaking magistrate; the one, in fore litigioso, the other in foro venali; that
is, the one in pleading of causes, the other in buying and selling; and the
commonwealth suffers damage, as well by the one as by the other. To subborne
the Judge and make him give out a false sentence is a fearful sin; so to
falsify measures. Hos. 12.7. He is a merchant, and the balance of deceit is
in his hand. The Lord who sits amongst the Judges, to see whether they do
justice or not, he sits also in this judicatorie, to see to matters whether
they go right or wrong.

These weights and measures are called the Lords work. Prove. 16.11. they are
called the Lords work, Measures called the Lords work.
because they please him. Prove. 11.1. For a just weight is his delight. So Ioh.
6.29. This is the work of God, to believe in him, that is, it is the work of
God which pleases him. And mark what great care the Lord had to preserve
these measures and weights; the shekell was called the shekell of the
sanctuary. Levit. 27.25. Exodus 30.13. and after the captivity, he renewed this
precept concerning the shekell. Ezekiel. 45.12. that all corruption in measures
might be taken away, because it was kept in the Sanctuary; and the common
shekell was rectified by it. So the measures of the foot were kept in the
Capitol amongst the Romans, and among us; one town has the keeping of the
stone, another of the peck, and another of the elne.

Measures natural by institution.
These measures of commutative justice were, first, natural; secondly, by
institution; natural were these, when men interchanged wares with wares, as
neat for sheep; hence it seems when they began to sell for money, and had
found it out by institution, they put the print of the beast first upon the
money, as Jacob bought it for so much money. Genesis 33.19. but Act. 7.16. he
bought it for so many pieces of silver: (...)
and this piece of money was called Keshitah, agnus. Job. 42.16. and the
Chaldee translateth it Hhurephah, or Hhurphan, as they of Peloponesus set a
snaile upon their money; hence was their proverb, testudo superabit virtutem
ac sapientiam.

By institution were first, their measures, and then their money; their
measures, their finger, the palm and the cubit: man is a compend of things
both seen and not seen, and therefore whatsoever perfection is in any of
them, the sum of it is found in him; the measures are taken from him as it is
called cubitus viri, Measures taken from the body of man.
Revelat. 21.17. He measured the wall an hundred and forty and four cubits,
according to the measure of a man, that is of an Angel who appeared in the
likeness of a man, it is not called the Kings cubit, or the common cubit, or
the cubit of the Sanctuary, but a man's cubit; because it was borrowed from man
first, and the Lord alludeth to this form. Esaias. 40.12. Who has measured the
waters with the hollow of his hand, and the heavens with his spanne: these were
first measures of liquid and dry things, taken from the body of man.

The first measure taken from the body of man, A finger broad the first measure
taken from man. (...) digitus annularis.
was digitus, a finger. Ier. 52.21. The thickness thereof was four fingers.
When the Priest measured the incense which was to be offered, he measured it
digito annulari, with his ring finger.

The second measure taken from the body of man was Lepach, palmus. 1. Sam.
17.4. Palmus.
There came out a champion out of the camp of the Philistims named Goliath:
whose height was six cubits and a spanne, that is, he was a span more then
six cubits: So Esaias. 48.13. My right hand has spanned the heavens.

The third measure taken from man was the cubite, and it was of two sorts,
either cubitus communis, Cubitus Communis. Decurtatus.

or cubitus decurtatus; cubitus decurtatus, or the short cubit, was the half
of the common cubite. Judge. 3.16. Ehud made him a dagger of a cubite length,
that is, half a cubite. Cubitus communis seu mosaicus, the common cubite was
twenty four fingers from the elbow to the top of the finger; the flying book
of Gods curse was twenty cubits in length, and ten in breadth; which measured
those that were to be cut off. Zach. 5.2, 3. this is the just cubite. Ezekiel.
41.8. The reed is called a full reed of six cubits, that is, a just reed. So
Genesis 23.16. Abraham gave to Ephron full weight, that is, just weight, and of
the cubits the reed was made up.

They builded by the line and by the reed; the line served to make the wall
straight, if any stone stood out, The line and reed served for building of the
walls.
the line brought them to put it in; and the reed served to measure the length,
the height, and the breadth; and Revelat. 21.15. this is called a golden reed,
in respect of the new Jerusalem which was from above: this reed consisted of
six cubits, and Ezekiel adds a palm. Ezekiel. 40.5. And in the man's hand was a
measuring reed of six cubits and an hand breadth; the hand breadth is added
here, because the Angel came from Babel, and brought a reed with him from
Babel which was shorter by a palm then the Jews reed; Why a palm was added
to the reed in Babylon.
therefore he adds a hand breadth, to teach them that the second temple
should be equal in length and breadth with the first temple.

The line was a measure also, whereby they measured their ground, Al^^sion.
and their buildings. David alludeth to this: Psalm. 16.6. The lines are fallen
to me in pleasant places. So Psalm. 19.4. Their line is gone out through all the
earth. The line, the preaching of the gospel came from Jerusalem, which was
the center, to the circumference, which was the whole earth.

The line of desolation what.
So when they demolished houses, they measured them with a line; this line is
called the line of desolation, Allusion.
and Jeremiah alludeth to this. Lament. 2.8. The Lord has purposed to destroy
the wall of the daughter of Sion, he has stretched a line. So 2. King. 21.13.
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house
of Achab.

Weights why called the weights of the bag.
The stones wherewith they weighed things, were called lapides sacculi. Prove.
16.15. All the weights of the bag are his work, they are called the weights
of the bag, because they are kept in the bag, Allusion.
and David alludeth to this Ps. 56.8. Thou put all my tears in the bottle,
that is, thou weighest them.

Their measures for their corn, was the Epha, and Christ requires three
properties in this measure. Luc, 6.38. (...)
Pressed down, shaken together, and running over. Zachariah alludeth to this
measure of the Epha. Zach. 5. Contrary to these properties of the Epha are the
measures of the churl. Esaias. 32.7. The instruments of the churl are evil.

The second measure by institution is money, this money is called numus, Money
a measure by institution.
from Numa Pompilius who coined it first amongst the Romans; or it was so
called rather (...), from the law, because it is commanded to be coined by the
law. The benefit of this money, is first, to supply our wants, for men are not
able to carry their wares still about with them, therefore they contract them
more compendiously into money, and they buy things necessary for themselves
with it, and this money is (...), or fide jussor, it gives the word for us,
and it is (...), subsidium indigentia nostrae, the aid and succor of our
wants, and it keeps contracts and societies amongst men; therefore Solomon
says, that money answers to all things. Eccles. 10.19.

God will have clear dealing betwixt man and man, God will have men to deal
clearly and truly in buying and selling. (...) tam vere ut bic dies.
in buying and selling. Genesis 25.33. Jacob said, swear to me this day, in the
original it is [Cajom] As truly as this day is a day, that thou will sell to
me thy birth right.

He will have the buyer to give the just price for the thing he buyeth, and he
will have him that sells, to sell sufficient wares; (...) mensura pro
mensura. (...) transiens inter Mercatores.
this the Hebrews call [Midda bamidda] mensura pro mensura, and the Greeks
call (...), the money must be sufficient money, [Gnobher lassohher] currens
inter mercatores, he will have it to be good and current money. Contrary to
this is argentum adulterinum, carens publica approbatione, Your money is become
dross. Esaias. 1.22.

He will not have the buyer to overreach the seller: The buyer must not
deceive the seller, nor the seller the buyer.
Prove. 20.14. It is naught, it is naught, says the buyer: but when be is gone
his way, then he boasts; neither will he have the seller to deceive the
buyer. Amos. 8.5. The Lord objected to the Jews that they made the ephasmall,
and the shekell great; they made the shekell great, they had a false shekell
which weighed more then the common shekell did, How the Jews made the Epha
less.
and they weighed the shekell of the buyer by this shekell; and because it was
not equal in weight with their false shekell, therefore they caused them to
add so much more to their shekell, and so deceived the people: Likewise they
diminished the Epha when they had corn to sell, and so the people were cozened
both in the shekell and Epha.

So these who sold water and wine. (...) is (...), vitiare vinum. (...)
frumentum a (...) frangere. Frangere sitim quid apud Hebraos.
As they failed in the quantity in buying and selling, so in the quality;
sometimes they sold quisquilias frumenti, and the refuse of the wheat, they
sold enough in the quantity but not in the quality; the Hebrews call wheat
[Bar] from [Shabhar] frangere, because it is pure and clean stuff, which is
able to break our fast, and kill our hunger. So the Psalmist says, Onagri in
desert^ non fregerunt sitim. Psalm. 104.11. that is, they got no water to quench
their thirst.

Those who interchange things, should make the equality to be such after the
interchange is done, that every one of them have as much as they had before
they interchanged; Arist. Cap. 4. lib. 5. Eth. sub finem.
so that neither of the parties must brag of their gain, nor complain for
their loss. It is naught, it is naught, says the buyer: but when he is gone
away, then he boasts. Prove. 20.14.







the price, Whether things may be sold at a higher rate than they are worth.
Equality Natural. Usual.

and here the common estimation of the Magistrate, and the custom of the
country should rule this equality of things. This equality is either natural
or usual: in matters of contract we respect not the value natural, but we
esteem the worth of them by the conveniencie for use. In nature the meanest
living creature is more excellent than pearls or diamonds (for things living
are more excellent then things without life) yet to our use, bread is better
than a thousand of such little creatures. Secondly, the value of things is
esteemed according to the rareness. 2. King 6.25. An Ass head was worth
eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of the cab of doves guts, worth
five pieces of silver, but when the siege was dissolved. 2. King. 7.8. Two
measures of barley were sold for a shekell, and the measure of fine flower for
a shekell. So when there is a great mortality, then the corn is sold for
little or nothing, because there is no body to eat it. Revelat. 6.6. A measure
of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny: Rarum and
pretiosum permutantur apud Hebraeos.
but when the corn is scant, then it is sold at a higher rate; therefore the
Hebrews put Rarum pro caro, Let thy feet be precious in thy neighbors house,
that is, let them seldom come there. Prove 25.7. So 1. Sam. 3.1. And the word
of the Lord was precious in those days, that is, rare.

Whether,

There is pretium justificatum and limitatum, Whether things may be sold at a
higher rate in respect of time. Pretium Rigidum. M^te. Mediocre.

which consists within some reasonable limits of justice, and it has three
degrees: the first is called rigidum and supremum, the second is called, pium
and mite, or infimum, which is the lowest price; and the third is, mediocre vel
discretum; and men in their common speech express these three thus. The
highest price, they say, a thing is worth so much if it were to be sold to a
Turk; the lowest price, I can sell it no cheaper to my brother; and the middle
price, I sell it usually thus to any man.

pretium rigidum, or not?

pretium augmentativum, or multiplicativum, that is augmented above the worth
of the thing in extremity, this is a breach of commutative justice. A man may
sell for a time at a dearer rate, when he receives not present money, and
David alludeth to this. Psalm. 44.12. Thou sellest thy people, and non
multiplicasti pretium nostrum, that is, thou dealest not with us as other
merchants do, when they sell their wares, they sell at a higher rate; because
they get not present money; but we seem to be base in thine eyes, that thou
sellest us away for nothing.

Wretches wish dearth.
These are wretched people which wish a dearth when it is cheap. Amos. 8.5.
When will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn? and the Sabbath, that
we may set forth wheat? (...) Annus sepcimus. (...) Aediles ceriales.
By Sabbath here is meant the Sabbath of the seventh year, called Shemittah,
for when the land rested the seventh year, the poor got that which the earth
brought forth of its own accord without any labor; and then they needed not
to buy corn from the rich: Therefore they wished that this Sabbath were past,
that they might sell at a dearer rate.

Those who ruled the market amongst the Hebrews, and moderated the price of
the corn, were called Shabharim; because they brake the hunger of the people,
and they were called by the Greeks (...), they who ruled the market, and
(...), who measured out the corn, (...), overseers, and (...), inspectores,
and the Latins called them, Aediles Ceriales, the overseers of the corn.

The Lord says, Deuteronomy. 15.9. Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked
heart, saying, the seventh year the year of rest is at hand, and thine eye be
evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nothing: observe how the
rich wretches hated the seventh year, if it were present, they said, would to
God it were gone that we might sell at a high rate, and if it were near at
hand, then they would give their poor brother nothing to relieve him, for they
knew that in this seventh year, the land would fall to the owner again, and
so they should have made little gain: and if it was long to the seventh year,
then they would have given him money for his land, having no respect to their
poor brother, but to themselves.

Now let us see what things cannot be sold or bought. Things that cannot be
sold.


First, it was not lawful to sell men, Joel. 3.3. (...), Hominum venditor.
They gave a boy for a harlot, and a girl for wine; Deuteronomy. 21.14. Thou shall
not sell her at all, for money; thou shall not make merchandise of her. And
Amos 2.6. Not lawful to sell men.
They bought the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.

Secondly, it is not lawful to sell blood, Number. 35.32. Not to sell blood.
Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of
death, but he shall be surely put to death.

Thirdly, to sell chastity, Deuteronomy. 23.18. Not to sell chastity.
Thou shall not bring the hire of a whore, nor the price of a dog into the
house of the Lord thy God.

Fourthly, it is not lawful to sell justice, Not to sell justice.
this was Felix fault who hoped that money should have been given him of Paul,
that he might loose him, Act. 24.26.

Whether is it lawful to buy and sell the right of burial or not?

Whether the right of burial may be sold.
The Canonists answer, that burial is made a holy place by consecration and
benediction, and therefore they hold it simonie to sell burial; but no place
of it self can be made holy under the Gospel; the bodies of the saints lying
there make the place more to be respected, but not for the place it self; when
we meet in our Churches, the places of themselves are not holy, but the
people of God who meet in the those Churches; so the burial places are not
holy in themselves, but the bodies of the saints buried there; Abraham bought a
burial place, Genesis 23.4.

Fifthly, the souls of men fall not under this commutative justice, The souls
of men cannot be sold.
for there is no (...), or Compensatio animae, Matt. 16.26. What shall a man
give in exchange for his soul. Revelat. 18.13. Rome is said to sell men, as
heathenish Rome of old sold slaves: so does popish Rome sell the souls of men.
2. Pet. 2.3. Through covetousness they with fained words make merchandise of
you.

Things that were types of Christ might not be sold.
Sixthly, it was not lawful to sell those things which were types of Christ and
his grace: Esau sold his birth right, Genesis 25.34. and the Priesthood which
belonged to the first borne; and his smelling clothes, as Isiodore says, were
vestes sacerdotales, his priestly garments

Jacob sinned because he would not give the red pottage to his brother Esau
when he was hungry, but only under this condition, that he should sell him
the birth right. Secondly, that for such a small thing he sought so rich an
inheritance.

Whether Jacob sinned in resolving to give Esau the pottage.
If Jacob had seen his brother Esau in extreme necessity and then to have
refused to give him this pottage, this had been a great sin in him: but it was
rather intemperance that moved him to seek this pottage then necessity, what
necessity could urge him, was there not plenty enough in his fathers house? and
he urged it upon his brother Jacob, faining that he would die if he got not
that pottage.

And where it was alleged, that this was too small a price for a thing of such
great worth; it may be answered, that the right partained to Jacob already, and
he needed not to have given him any thing for it.

How could Jacob buy it safely, Esau could not sell it.

A man may buy that safely, A man may lawfully buy that which another cannot
sell.
which another cannot sell, Prove. 13.23. Buy the truth, but sell it not: and
servants may give their goods justly to rigid masters, which they cannot justly
exact.

So to sell that ointment which was poured upon Christ's head, Matt. 26.12.
These cannot be given for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price
of them, Job. 28.15, 16.

Seventhly, Not to sell the gifts of the holy Ghost.
it is not lawful to sell the gifts of the holy Ghost, as Gehezi would have
sold them; 1. King. 5. and Simon Magus would have bought them, Act. 8.19.20.

But the greatest sin of all is, to sell Christ himself, as Judas sold him
for thirty pieces of silver, A great sin, and bad merchandise to sell Christ.
Matt. 26.15. this was bad merchandise, says Saint Austin, Judas sold his
salvation, and the Scribes and Pharisees bought their damnation. The price which
Judas got, he threw it back to the Scribes; and Christ whom they bought, and
enclosed in the grave rose again, and they lost him, so neither of the two
gained in this bargan. Conclusion.


The conclusion of this is, the Lord cursed the Cananite who had the balance of
deceit in his hand; Hos. 12.7. and the flying book of Gods curse lighted upon
the thief, Zach. 5.3. therefore let men learn to deal uprightly and justly
in their bargains, or else the curse of God will light upon them.

EXERCITAT. IX. Of distributive justice. Commandment. VIII.
Psalm. 41.1. Blessed is he that considers wisely of the poor.
HE that would consider wisely of the poor, must consider first what right he
has to that which he gives to the poor: Secondly, that he must give of his
own to the poor, and not of other men's: thirdly, the manner how he must
give, from his heart, in what order, and with what wisdom: Fourthly, to whom?
to the poor.

Ius Civil. Spirituale.

First, he must consider what right he has to that which he gives: a man
has a double right to a thing, a civil right, and a spiritual right, God the
father gave Jesus Christ his son the uttermost parts of the earth for a
possession, Psalm. 2.8. yet he would not have the Temple dedicated unto him,
Christ bought the civil right of things.
until David bought it from Arauna the Iebusite for fifty shekels of silver,
2. Sam. 24.24. that he might have the civil right also. So he bought these
things which he had need of against the feast, that he might have a civil
right. The Apostle touches both those rights, 1. Cor. 10.25. Whatsoever is
sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake. Eat
whatsoever is sold in the shambles; that is, eat it when ye buy it with your
money, this is civil right. For conscience sake; here is the spiritual right.
Tit. 1.15. To the clean all things are clean, this is the spiritual right.

Some hold that a wicked and unregenerate man can have no right to a thing,
because man was made to the image of God, and having lost that image, he has
lost that dominion, Johannes Gershon de potestate Ecclesiastica,
consideratione, 31.
and right which he had to the creatures. And as traitors when they commit
treason their lands are forefeited; so wicked men by the fall have lost their
right to the creatures, and Esaias. 60.12. The nations and kings that will not
serve thee, shall perish, and that the children of God have all the right to
things temporal which the wicked have. The wicked have not a spiritual right
to the creatures, but they have a civil right.


But these places show only, that the wicked have lost all spiritual right to
the creatures, but they have not lost their civil dominion and right:
Nabuchadnezzer was an idolatrous and a wicked king, yet the Lord says, I have
given all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzer the king of Babylon, my
servant, and the beasts of the fields have I given him also, to serve him,
Ierem. 27.6. He permitted him not only to take them, but he gave them to him.
So Ezekiel. 29.20. I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor. So Dan.
2.37. Thou o king art a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given thee a
kingdom, power, strength and glory. So to Cyrus an infidel, the Lord gave the
treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, Esaias, 45.3. And
Christ himself confirms this, when he bids give tribute to Caesar,
although he was an infidel, Matt. 22.21. The ground of the civil right is
reason.
and he said to Pilate, John. 19.11. Thou could have no power at all against
me, except it were given thee from above: wherefore sin depriveth not wicked
men of their civil right to the creatures, the ground of the civil right is
reason which is in man, The ground of the spiritual right is holiness.
because he is a reasonable creature to command and rule: the ground of the
spiritual right is, because he is a holy creature, and as sin takes not away
the life of man, so it takes not away his civil possessions, and as the Lord
Matt. 5.45. Makes his Sun to rise upon the evil and on the good: so he
bestows this civil right, as well on the evil as on the good, the wicked
have this civil right to the creatures, therefore they may distribute them to
others.

A man must give that which is his own.
Secondly, he must give that which is his own to the poor, and not that which
pertains to others; Break thy bread to the poor, Esaias, 58.7. So Job. 31.20.
If he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; a man may not rob and
steal, and give that to the poor, for that were an abomination to the Lord.
The Lord that will not have the price of a whore offered unto him, Deuteronomy. 23.18.
Far less will he have that which is gotten by rapine given to the poor,
and therefore alme^ in the Hebrew, (...) iustitia Eleemosyna.
and Syriack tongue is called [tzedecah] justitia, Matt. 6.1. When thou do
thine alms, in the Syriack it is, When thou do thy justice: to teach us,
that alms should not be of things gotten by deceit, rapine, or wrong.

Make to your selves friends of the mannon of unrighteousness, Luc. 16.9. then
it may seem that we may give alms of that which was unjustly gotten.

Why called mammon of unrighteoustesse.
It is called mammon of unrighteousness, not because it is unjustly gotten, but
because it is oftentimes the cause of injustice, for when men are rich they
take occasion to do wrong. Secondly, it may be called mammon of
unrighteousness, not because it is unjustly gotten, but because it is unjustly
withholden from the poor in their necessity.

The manner of giving to the poor.
The third thing to be considered in giving to the poor is the manner, and here
four things must concur; first the pity of the heart; secondly, the
understanding of the heart; thirdly, discretion or wisdom in giving; and
fourthly, in singleness of the heart. First, it must be given with hearty
affection; Alms must be given with compassion.
Esaias, 58.10. Draw out thy soul to the hungry. 1. Ioh. 3.17. But whosoever
has this worlds goods, and sees his brother has need, and shuts up his
bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him? We should
give our ^almes with such an affection and compassion as the mother carries to
her young child, therefore (...), comes from (...) misereor; if the compassion
of the heart go not first, the Lord counts nothing of the ^almes, Prove.
22.9. He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed: for he gives of his
bread to the poor: here the pity of his heart is expressed by his eye: as a
covetous heart is expressed by an evil eye, Prove. 23.6. So 30.25. Did I not
weep for him that was in trouble, and was not my soul grieved for the poor:
it is a more easy matter to to give the alms to the poor, than to be
affected in heart for their wants. It is an heathenish sentence of some who
say, miseratio est aliena sapienti, Lipsius.
ut imbecilli malique oculi nota est lippire, ad conspectum lippientis: sic
animi, dolor viso, dolere, as it is a note of a weak eye, Men should be
affected with the grief of others.
to water when it beholds a sore eye, so it is a note of a weak mind to be
affect and grieved with other men's miseries; Who is weak (says Paul) and I am
not weak, 2. Cor. 11.25. I am as much touched with other men's wants as if I
wanted my self. Amos. 6.6. Woe to them that drink wine in bowls, (...)
Doloris exp^rs.
and anoint themselves with the chief ointment, but they are not grieved for
the affliction of Joseph. He is called (...), who is not moved with other men's
grief, he is called (...) and (...), who has a fellow feeling of his
brethrens want, and he is called (...), who is not moved with their wants: but
(...), is worst of all, to delight and rejoice at other men's miseries, as
Joseph's brethren when they had cast him into the pit, They sat down to eat
bread, and to be mirry, Genesis 37.25. A great sin to rejoice at the calamity
of Gods children.
the Lord denounced a great Judgment against the Ammonites, when they rejoiced
at the Jews, and the sanctuary when it was prophained, Ier. 25.6. Thus says
the Lord, because thou have clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet,
and rejoiced in heart with all despite against the land of Israel, behold
therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and I will deliver thee for a
spoil to the Heathen, and will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause
the to perish out of the country.

No man exempted from giving the alms of the heart.
The special alms is the alms of the heart, therefore none are exempted from
giving of alms, no not the poorest that is, because they may have a pitiful
heart, Charitas de sacculo non erogatur; the widows mite was more acceptable
then all the rich offerings of the Pharisees.

Secondly, he must give it with the understanding of the heart.

Things which men enjoy are of three sorts.
Things which men enjoy, are either necessary, profitable, delightful or
superfluous; In things necessary, we must first serve our selves, and then our
brethren: there is a twofold necessity, the first is an absolute necessity,
this is called necessitas vitae; there is another necessity ad statum and
conditionem, for our condition and estate; we are not bound to give that which
is necessary for the entertainment of our life, to help our neighbor; but
only that which is necessary for us to live decently in that condition of life
wherein we are placed. It was an extraordinary case then, when the widow of
Sarepta having but a little meal and oil to help her necessity and her
child, yet served the Prophet first.

Things profitable for us should be given to help our neighbors nececessity.
Secondly, that which is profitable to me should serve for my neighbors
necessity: He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none, Luc.
3.11. he says not, he that has one coat let him give it to him that has
none, for that serves for his necessity.

Cor. 8.14. That your abundance may be a supply for their want; here it may
seem that we are only to supply our neighbors necessity with our abundance,
and not with those things which are necessary for our condition and estate.

By abundance here is not meant superfluity, What meant by abundance.
but such things as the Corinthians might spare well; and it is called
abundance in respect of the poor estate of the saints, who were in Jerusalem
at that time.

Thirdly, that which is delectable for me, Things delectable for us should
serve our neighbors utility.
should serve for my neighbors utility, and they give this example of it; In
Israel they used to anoint their faces with oil to make them shine; and they
used to annoint their feet to make them the more fit for their journey; and
they say, that a man was bound to spare the oil wherewith he was to annoint
his face, for his neighbor to annoint his feet for profitable journey; and if
we are to part with things delectable for our neighbors utilitie, much more
are we bound to part with them for our neighbors necessity. Example, Luc. 10.
the oil and the wine which the Samaritan had to serve him in his journey; yet
he took them and poured them into the wounds of his poor neighbor; he
took that which was profitable to him in his journey, and supplied his
neighbors necessity.

Lastly, Our superfluity should give place to our neighbors delight.
superfluity should give place to our neighbors delight, but this is the
misery, that the rich glutton out of his superfluity will not bestow his
crummes to supply Lazarus necessity. Luc. 16.

Thirdly, Men should give to the poor with wisdom.
it must be given with the wisdom of the heart, the modest receiver is
ashamed often times to take, therefore there is wisdom required to fasten any
thing and urge it upon him. And as we should not shame these who have not. 1.
Cor. 11.22. So wisdom will teach a man so to give to the children of God,
that they be not ashamed in receiving it. An example of this we have in Boaz,
who considered wisely of the estate of Ruth, Boaz judged wisely of Ruth.
knowing that her religion had taught her shamefastnes, and that she was loath
to be chargeable to others, although she was poor; therefore he willed his
servants to suffer her to gleane in the field: next he bids her come and eat
with him; and thirdly, he commanded his servants to let some more fall of
purpose to her, then they used to do, Ruth. 2. See how wisely he judged of
the poor. Esaias. 58.7. Bring the poor which are cast out of thine house. (...)
vim attulit. (...).
and 2. King. 4.8 The widow constrained him to eat bread, [Hhasak] vim
attulit, the Seventy translate it, (...), it signifies not a bare invitation,
but an enquiring, enviting, and compelling. So did the Disciples to Christ,
Luc. 24.29. and it is great wisdom to do so, for there is such modesty in
the children of God, that they excuse themselves being loath to be
troublesome; therefore the inviter should be more earnest with them.
Arcesilaus visiting Apelles Chius, Simile.
and knowing his poverty, and how unwilling he would have be^ne to have taken
any thing from him; sitting by him as he was lying in his bed, said unto him,
incommode cubas, and lifting up his pillow secretly, he conveyed a purse of
money under his head, which money when the old woman who attended him did find,
he said Arcesilai hoc furtum est, this is Arcesilaus theft; there is great
dexterity required in giving to some.

Alms to be given in simplicity.
Fourthly, he must give it in the simplicity of his heart: Romans 4.8. He that
gives, let him do it with simplicity. It must not be given with ostentation,
as the Pharisees gave their alms with the sound of a trumpet. Mat. 6.2. The
Jews write that the Corban which was in the temple of Jerusalem, had this
proverb written about it, The gift given in secret pacifieth wrath. Prove.
21.14. to teach them to give that which they gave, secretly, and to make no
vain show when they put it in the treasury, and not to let their left hand know
what their right hand does.

The fourth thing to be considered is, A twofold use of our goods.
to whom it should be given? to the poor; Blessed is he that considers
wisely of the poor. A man must have a double use of his goods, not only to
entertain himself and his family, but also to give to the poor; when a man
provideth only for himself and his, this is but a sowing to the flesh. Galat.
6.8. he is worse then an infidel that will not do this 1. Tim. 5.8. but he
must give unto the poor, and this is a sowing to the spirit. The Jews were to
leave the corners of the fields to the poor. The corners of the fields and the
gleanings left to the poor.
Levit. 19.19. and the gleanings of their fields; the corner was that which
they left growing in the field, and the gleaning was that which fell away in
the reaping; and so of their olives. Deuteronomy. 24.19. and as the master of the
family was to give the first fruits to the Priests, and the tithe to the
Levits; and to carry the second tithe to Jerusalem to be eaten before the Lord;
So he was to leave these gleanings, and the corners of the field to the poor
as an alms; if there were many poor they added the more, and if they did sow
little and reap much according to the blessings of God, they added the more;
and the measure of their corner, was the sixth part, as the Jews say. When men
make themselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that they may
receive them into eternal tabernacles, How men make them friends of riches.
this was called by the fathers traiectitia pecunia: for the merchants when
they go beyond sea take not their money with them for fear of robbing, Simile.
but take their bill of exchange with them, and their money meets them in a
strange country: So the children of God give out their money here unto the
poor, and cast their bread upon the water. Eccles. 7.1. and they take Gods
bill of exchange for it, and after many days they find it, when it meets
them in the life to come.

It should be given to the poor, Break thy bread to the hungry. Esaias. 48.7.
A man in his necessity is Lord of thy goods. Prove. 3.27. therefore thou can
not withhold them from him.

To what poor we must give. (...) tremuit, defecit.
The poor to whom we must give, are first, the weak poor, [Vmatah jado] if his
hand fail or tremble. Levit. 25.35.

Secondly, if he be one of our own poor: Deuteronomy. 15.7. If there be among you a
poor man of one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in the land which the
Lord thy God gives thee; Thou shall not harden thy heart, nor shut thine hand
upon thy poor brother.

Lastly, if he be one of the poor Saints, and one of the household of says,
Those things which are given to the poor are called in the scriptures,
sometimes Eleemosyna and iustitia Mat. 6.1. and (...), 1. Cor. 16.1 and (...),
1. Cor. 16.3. and (...), 1. Cor. 16 15. and (...) benedictio, 2. Cor. 9.5. and
(...) semen, 2. Cor. 9.10. and (...) ministerium vel sacrificium. 2. Cor. 9.12.
and thou give him in that respect, thou judge wisely of the poor, then thou
shall be partaker of their prayers, and thou shall lose nothing. The Apostle to
persuade the Corinthians to help the Saints at Jerusalem in their necessity;
says; 2. Cor. 8.15. that he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he
that had gathered little had no lack. God brought things to such an equality
amongst the Jews, that although they gathered more Manna, yet they had nothing
over the Homer, and they that gathered less, yet their Homer was full; there
were many miracles in this Manna, and this was one. So the Apostle to bring an
equality in the Church, when the Corinthians in their abundance did help those
in Jerusalem, they shall have their homer full, and sufficient to content them;
and the poor saints in Jerusalem, although they gathered little, yet they
shall have no lack; for that which the Corinthians bestow upon them will fill
their homer; and they again with their prayers will supply that to the
Corinthians which they bestowed upon them; and so both they and the Corinthians
shall be brought to an equality, that none of them shall want.

So they consider wisely of the poor who make (...), places to bring up poor
infants, and (...), (...) Domus misericordiae.
hospitals for the poor, these the Hebrews call [Beth Hhesdah] domus
misericordiae, the house of mercy.

They of Crete are commended most for their hospitality; they had two sorts of
hospitality, first, (...), The hospitality of the Cretians.
where the strangers dined; and (...), the house where they slept, and he who
entertained those, was called (...), he gave them salt and bread in fignum
amicitiae; and from this, the Greek fathers in the Primitive Church called the
Preacher (...), Preachers why called (...).
because he gives the bread of life to men here, as strangers and Pilgrims
upon the earth.

Contrary to this is inhumanitie, not to receive strangers; such were the
Samaritans, who would not receive the Apostles; but the greatest barbaritie of
all is to kill strangers, as the Carthaginians did; so Busiris, this is called
(...), the killing of guests.

Miserable niggards who give nothing to the poor have not the right use of
their own bread. Niggardly wretches have not the use of their own goods.
Achab cast himself upon his bed, and could not eat his bread because he could
not get Naboths vineyard; these wretches have neither the right use of their
goods for themselves nor for others. The Prophet Zachary calls great men the
oaks of Basan. Cap. 11.2. Why great men called oaks.
Why are they called the oaks of Basan? because the oak tree brings forth
no fruit, but that which feeds hogs; so great men do nothing for the most
part with their riches, but feed horses and dogs; but poor Lazarus sterveth
at the gate. Luc. 15. Ambrose said, Panem postulat pauper and equus mordet
aurum, that is, the poor beggeth a piece of bread only, but the horse as it
were eats gold.

The conclusion of this is: 1. Ioh. 3.17. Whosoever how dwells the love of
God in him?



EXERCITAT. X. Of Restitution. Commandment. VIII.
Luc. 19.8. And Zacheus stood up and said unto the Lord, behold, the half of
my goods I give to the poor, etc. and I restore him four fold.
REstitution is a part of distributive justice. The chief intention of the
lawgiver is, that no man should defraud his neighbor, but if he has taken
any thing from him by fraud or oppression, then he sets down the way how
he may be recompensed by making restitution.

In restitution consider these points: First, what it is; Secondly, what is to
be restored; Thirdly, how much is to be restored; Fourthly, to whom it is
made; Lastly, when it is to be restored.

Restitution what.
Restitution is defined after this manner, it is a special act of distributive
justice, by the which a man is bound to restore to another that which is his,
by the law of equity, formally, or vertually.

Who is bound to make restitution.
He is bound to make restitution, who withholds another man's goods: The law of
God binds him to make restitution, although he be bound by no humane
contract; Zacheus was obliged here to make restitution, although there was no
humane law nor contract that did bind him; the law of God binds the deceiver
to make restitution to the party whom he has hurt, before ever the law of the
Judge bind him; and the punishment instituted by the Judge freeth him not, from
that which he owes to the party, unless the thing adjudged be given to the
party; and as he who satisfies and defrayeth one debt, does not satisfy for
another: So when he has satisfied the Judge, he remains still debtor to the
party.

Secondly, what is to be restored: A difference betwixt restitution and
satisfaction.
Here we must put a difference betwixt restitution and satisfaction; in wrongs
and injuries done to our neighbor, properly we make satisfaction, but not
restitution; but in things stolen and taken away, we make restitution.

First, if a man has damnified his neighbor in his soul, he must make
satisfaction to him after this manner; First, he must confess his error to
him; again, he must set down his retractation; Thirdly, he should pray
earnestly to the Lord for him, that he would reclaim him from his error;
confession, retractation, In damnifying our neighbor, we must make
confession, restitution, and satisfaction.
and intercession is all that is required of him, to repair the hurt that is
done to his neighbors soul.

Secondly, for defamation; What restitution was to be made in damnifying a man
or woman's name.
If a man had slandered a woman in Israel, and raised an evil report upon her
after he had married her, and had not found her a maid; and if the signs of
her virginity proved otherwise, then the elders of the city were bound to
take the man, and to whip him, and besides he was to pay an hundred shekels to
her father, because he had defamed her. Deuteronomy. 22.16. If a man again had layen
with a maid that was not betrothed, then he was bound to pay fifty shekells to
her father, and likewise he was bound to marry her, and not put her away. If a
man slander his neighbor and raise an evil report upon him; he is to
confess publicly the wrong that he had done to him, and make a recantation of
all that he has spoken, for the wrong which he has done to his neighbor.



A man is to respect his own good name before his neighbors.
He is to prefer his own good name to the good name of his neighbor, if he
and his neighbor be in an equal case; but in this case the slanderer has
lost his good name, and possesses it unjustly; but the good name justly
belongs to him who is slandered and defamed; and by all law conditio
possidentis est potior, he that is in possession has the best right.

A four fold restitution, in curing, cessation, shame, and smart.
If he had done wrong to his neighbors person and hurt him, then he was bound
to give him curationem and cessationem. Exodus 21.19. that is, to satisfy the
Chirurgian for curing of him, and to give him so much as he might have gained
all the time; and the Jews add, that he was to pay besides for his shame, and
for his smart. If a man had hurt a slave in Israel, whom satisfied he for
curing of him? the Chirurgian; whom satisfied he for his cessation? his
master, because he wrought to him; whom satisfied he for his pain? himself;
whom satisfied he for his credit? no body; because he was but a slave and
capable of no credit. A difference betwixt the restitution to a free man in
Israel, and a slave and a woman.
If a man had hurt a free man in Israel, he satisfied the Chirurgian for this
curing, and he satisfied himself for three things; for his shame, for his
pain, and for his cessation. If a man had hurt the wife of an Israelite, he
satisfied the Chirurgian for curing of her, he satisfied her husband for her
cessation, he satisfied herself for her pain, and for her shame: he satisfied
a part to her husband, and a part to her self, because it tended to the
discredit of them both: but the civil law said, Homo liber nullae pretio
estimari potest, Iuxta g^ossam, qua quaest. si quis ff. ad l.
he that hurts a free man, by the law he is bound Ad cessationem and
curationem; but if he has made any deformity or scarre in his body, he could
make no satisfaction for that, Corpus enim liberum nullam recipit
aestimationem, says the Law. But if a man should make a star or a blemish in
a slave, there may be a recomtaken for that, for as there is a great difference
to hurt man in his face, and to hurt him in the foot, so there is as great a
difference betwixt a free man and a slave, and therefore the Greeks call
slaves (...), their masters feet.

As satisfaction is to be made for wrongs done, A threefold restitution in
things stolen.
so is restitution for things stolen or taken away by fraud, and here
restitution is made, when it is idem numero, specie, vel aequivalens.

First, he is to restore idem numero, the self same thing, if it be extant,
and not perished, and if it be worse he is bound to make it good, and if it be
not extant, then to restore it idem specie, and if that will not satisfy, he
is bound to give aequivalens, the worth of the thing. Lands within
prescription, the lands are to be restored, but not the gain.


In restitution this rule also must be observed. Lands which prescribe not are
to be restored, 2. King. 8. the widow being away from her land seven years,
in the time of famine amongst the Philistims, she came home at the end of
seven years, and the king commanded to restore to her all that were hers, and
the fruit of the field since she left the land: so that if it be a thing
fruitful, which is withholden, it must be restored with the fruits of it, these
charges should only be deduced which were bestowed in gathering in these
fruits; but if the thing be not fruitful of it self, and yet it has been
kept back from the owner for a time, and he who withheld it, has made some
gain by it, he is not bound in that case to make restitution of the gain
which he has gotten by it: Example, a thief has a chain, and has made some
gain by it, he is bound to restore the chain back again, but not the
gain; So the biting usurer is bound to give back the money, but not the gain.

Things sinful given by the owner, the receiver was not to render it back
again.
Things which are not to be restored, Id quod datur propter delictum non est
restituendum: if it be a sin both upon the part of the giver, and the
receiver; the receiver is not bound to give it back again: when Judah gave his
staff and signet to Tamar to lie with her, it was a sin upon his part to
give them, and a sin upon her part to receive them, therefore she was not
bound to give them back again to Judah, but they were to be given to the
poor, for it was not lawful for her to keep them to herself: when the
Scribes gave thirty pieces of silver to Judas to betray Christ, Judas took the
money, but he repented and cast it back again, but they would not take it to
put it in their treasury.

Things lawful given by the owner, the receiver is bound to restore it back
again.
But if it be lawful upon the part of the giver, and not upon the part of the
receiver, then the receiver is to give it back, and to make restitution to the
giver. Solomon says, Buy wisdom, and sell it not, Prove. 10. It is lawful
for a man to come to a Judge, and to offer him money to do him justice, and to
expide his cause; yet it is not lawful for the Judge to take it; and if he
did take it, he was bound to make restitution.

Thirdly, to whom restitution is to be made.

Zacheus says, whomsoever I have damnified, to him I will make restitution:
and if he be dead, then he is bound by the law to make restitution to the next
kinsman, In what case restitution is to be made to the dead.
Number. 5.6, 7. and if he have no kinsman, to give it to the poor. Naomi said to
Ruth her daughter in law, Blessed be the the Lord, who has not left off his
kindness to the living and to the dead; Ruth. 1. that is, to the posterity of
the dead.

What if those from whom Zacheus had taken by false accusation, fourefold to
the poor, as alms?

No, for in this case it was just debt to the poor, That which is just debt a
man is not to make alms of it.
and not alms, Ista communicatio non est gratuita, sed ex justitia debetur; it
was not a free gift here, but a thing that belonged justly to them, for the
poor in this case succeed to the children, and a man may not make alms of
that which is just debt: this was proper to the poor, therefore he could not
give it as alms, and this was the brag of the Pharisee, Luc. 18.12. Do
decimas, I give tithes of all that I possess, Why alms and justice, has both
one name.
he made a gift of that he was to pay. Alms in the Syriacke is called
justice, Matt. 6.1. When thou do thy justice, that is, thine alms: the
reason of this is, because alms is a fruit of justice, and not of oppression;
the poor would have been here as heirs, and this would have been due to
them: but if he had given any thing besides to them, that had been alms.

Fourthly, how much is to be restored; The measure of the restitution.
Moses law appointed not so great a punishment for him that stole money, or
household stuff; as for him who stole sheep or oxen, for there are some evils
considered in themselves, although they be less, yet they do greater hurt to
the commonwealth, then these that are greater, and some sins are committed
with a greater facility then others; as it is easier to steal sheep or oxen
then money, because money is more closely kept; now neat and sheep are more
necessary for the life of man then money, and sheep and oxen were the
sacrifices which were offered unto the Lord, and therefore no marvel although
there was a greater punishment inflicted for stealing of them then for stealing
of other things.

Why did the Lord command five oxen to be restored for one, and but four
sheep to be restored for one.

The difference betwixt the restitution of oxen and sheep.
for a man perchance might steal a sheep in necessity to satisfy him and his
family, but not an ox to satisffe him and his family. Again, the ox was the
beast that was most necessary for them, and therefore he who stole an ox was
more severely punished: therefore the Greeks when they would praise a thing,
they put (...) to it, as (...), a fair child, and (...) a fair fig.



According to the nature of the theft the punishment is to be measured.
The reason of this was, when the thief went on in his sin, the punishment
was enlarged, Zacheus stinted himself to fourefold, not by virtue of Moses
law, for he was but a heathen, and a publican; but because he knew not
certainly how much was due to every one, he will rather give more then less.
So David, 2. Sam. 12.5. says, he will restore the lamb fourefold, but in the
original, (...)
it is Arbangtaijm, bis quatuor, twice so much as is commanded in the law,
Exodus 21.27. for the Hebrews double in the duall number until they come to
seven.

An example of Zaccheus restitution.
And he will give the half of his goods to the poor. Let us put this case:
Zacheus had in his stock an hundred thousand pounds, he takes of this ten
thousand from the poor, and binds himself to give back to them whom he had
defrauded fourefold, this would have amounted to forty thousand pound, there
remains behind sixty thousand pound in the stock, the half of this he
gives to the poor, and now remains thirty thousand in the stock, and then
he says, the rest which is behind is mine own.

Fifthly, in what order restitution is to be made.

Where there is sufficient to satisfy all, then certain debts are to be paid
before uncertain. If there be not sufficient to satisfy all, and the
creditors be equal, then restitution pro rato is to be made; To whom chiefly
restitution is first to be made.
and if they be not equal, then the poor is first to be satisfied, and if
there be nothing to satisfy, then there must be a willing mind. The
Schoolmen observe very well, that there is Necessitas praecepti, and
necessitas medij, Necessitas Pracepti. Medij.

where the precept binds, and the means cannot be had, then the Lord
accounts that obedience to the precept when there is a willing mind:
Example, The means are sometime an accomplishment of the precept.
The Lord commands every Christian man to receive the Sacrament, the
Christian is taken captive amongst the Turks, so that he cannot come to the
Sacrament, in this case the Lord does accept his desire for the deed. So if a
man be willing to pay that which he is bound to pay, necessitate praecepti,
albeit the means fail, the Lord accepts his will for the deed in this case,
and reputeth him obedient to his Commandment.

Lastly, when restitution is to be made.

Zacheus restored at that time when Christ spoke to him, he left it not to be
done by his heirs, There is no delay to be made in restitution.
but he paid it himself, he says not dabo, I shall give it, but do, I give
it in the present time, while this impetus spiritus was upon him, at the same
time he will restore; for this inflatus spiritus is soon quenched, while
Christ stands by he pays it. Exodus 22.26. Restore thy neighbors raiment in
which his skin sleeps, before the Sun go down; so the clothes that he
wears; in the morning before the Sun rise. Abimelech rose up early in the
morning to restore Sara to Abraham. Genesis 20.8. Lev. 6.5. The Lord commanded,
that when a man made restitution he should give the principal, and add a fifth
part more to it, and give it to him, to whom it appertained, and the time is
set down, in the day of his trespass offering, he was not then to defer
it. Prove. 3.28. Say not come again to morrow; he is bound presently to
restore if he have means, and if he may do it without the loss of his
credit, if the sin be secret, or without the overthrow of his family, he is
not to make restitution presently, unless he be in as great necessity to whom
restitution is to be made; and last, he who has stolen any thing secretly,
and cannot make restitution without discovery of himself, he is not to give
it himself, but by another, to save his credit.

The conclusion of this is, If thou make restitution thou shall be the child of
Abraham, Conclusion.
and salvation shall come to thy house; thou shall not overthrow thine house by
this mean, but build it, but otherwise, thou and thy money shall perish
together, and Thy children shall flatter the poor for bread, as Job says,
Job. 27.

Commandment. IX.
EXERCITAT I. That a Judge may be a false witness.
Exodus 20.16. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
THis Commandment is broken either in judgment or out of judgment.

The persons who concur in judgment are first, the Judge, (...) Index. (...)
Dominus Iudicij. (...) Filius iudicij (...) Debtor. (...) Ad^ocatus. (...)
Viri litis vel contentionum. (...) Adversarij Five sorts of person; may hear
false witness in judgment.
and he is first called by the Hebrews; Shophet. Secondly, bagnal mishphat,
he that has his cause to be tried before the Judge. Thirdly, Ben Dina, filius
judicij, the guilty person, and he is called also chobhel, debtor, or
creditor. Fourthly, the witnesses. Fifthly, melitz, the advocate. The parties
who were tried in judgment, were called anshe ribhoth, virilitis, vel
adversarij, all these may bear false witness in judgment.

First, the Judge may be a false witness; the Judge is bound to do two
things, Justice, and Judgment. He is bound to do Justice, that is, to protect
the innocent, and to deliver them from oppression. Job. 29.17. I brake the
jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. The Judge may
pervert two things, justice, and judgment.
A good Judge should do as David did, who smote the lion and took the lamb
out of his mouth, 1. Sam. 17.35. but Saul reserved Agag the wolf that he might
kill the lambs, 1 Samuel 15.9.

The second part of the Judge duty is, to do judgment, that is, to punish
the wicked: and that he may perform this duty rightly, An upright judge is
to do two things.
he must proceed two ways, either per scrutinium, by searching out the matter
diligently if there be no witnesses, Job. 29.16. The cause which I knew not I
searched out, a Judge should dig through the wall to find out abominations,
as Ezekiel did, Ezekiel. 8.8. Secondly, if he would judge rightly, he must try
out the truth per testes.

First, a Judge, who is the Lords deputy must study to imitate the Lord who is
the great Judge of the world who cannot do wrong: A Judge must incline to
neither hand.
Genesis 18.25. he must not incline more to the one part then to the other, until
he have tried the cause; and as the Arithmeticall midst is equally distant
from both the extremes, so must the Judge stand neutrally affected to both the
parties, and incline neither to the one, nor to the other: and as the tongue of
the balance stands equally to both the scales, so must the Judge to both the
parties, and the Hebrews observe, that osnaijm is both called the ears, and a
pair of balances, for even as the tongue of the balance stands as a judge
betwixt the two scales, (...) Aures. Bilances.

and enclineth to neither of them, until the weight be laid into the scales,
so should the ears of the Judge stand equally affected to both the parties
until he hear their reasons.

Secondly, the great Judge of the world enquireth before he judges, he will
come down and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
the sin, A Judge must enquire before he judge.
Genesis 18.21. Licet sint Deo aperta, non tamen punivit audita, sed visa, albeit
nothing be hid from God, for all things are naked before him, Heb. 4. yet he
punished not those things which he heard only, but what he saw. And the
council of Lateran advised Judges to learn of God himself to try and
examine:

Thirdly, A Judge must not judge rashly.
the great Judge of the world judges not rashly; temeritie and
inconsiderateness are principal motives to make a Judge err in judgment, as
we see in the case of David's judging betwixt Mephiboseth and Ziba: First, David
promised and swore that he would be a friend to Jonathan. 1. Sam. 19. and
remembering his oath, he gave his lands to his son Mephiboseth; yet by the
false accusations of Ziba, and David's surmising, that Mephiboseth affected the
kingdom, he will give the whole lands of Mephiboseth to Ziba; and which is
more, when he knew the truth, and saw the treachery of Ziba; yet he would not
recall his former sentence, but said, Why speak thou any more of thy
matters? I have said, thou and Ziba divide the land. 2. Sam. 19.29. not unlike
unto Pilate who said, quod scripsi scripsi, and which is worst of all; he
admitted Ziba to be one of his courtiours; albeit, he was such a notable liar
and a seditious man, and deserved rather death then preferment.

But it may be said that David in such a doubtful case did wisely, David's rash
judgment seems to be excused.
in bidding them divide the inheritance betwixt them, as Solomon bid them
divide the children betwixt the women; for if David had given all to
Mephiboseth, this might have been thought a means to have puffed him up the
more to affect the kingdom; but taking the half of the land from him, he
clippeth his wings; and Solomon knew by the answer of the woman when she bad
give the whole child, not parted, that she was the mother of the child. So when
Mephiboseth bids Ziba take all, by this it might have been gathered that he
was to affect the kingdom, not being content with so little a portion; and as
Solomon suspected that Adonijah affected the kingdom, because he would have
married Abishag: so might David have suspected Mephiboseth to affect the
kingdom, because he was not content with the half of the inheritance.

David erred in rash judgment.
But David being wise according to the wisdom of an Angel of God, 2. Sam.
14.20. he should not have believed the slanderous reports of Ziba, his charity
rather should have led him, when he heard good Mephiboseth renounce all
because of the Kings safe return, and that he would give Ziba the whole
inheritance, to be of another judgment; that Mephiboseth being a lame creature
and a dead dog (as he called himself) affected not the kingdom. There was
great temeritie and rashness in David, giving out judgment here.

Moses was ignorant of four causes which he was to consult with the Lord for.
There were four causes which came before Moses, the first of those who were
unclean by touching the dead, and might not eat the Passover upon the
fourteenth day of the first month. Number. 9.6. in this case, because he was
ignorant of it, he said, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will
command concerning you.

The second cause was that concerning the daughters of Zelophehad who did sue
for an inheritance, because Moses was ignorant of that cause, therefore he
brought it before the Lord. Number. 27.5.

The third cause was of him who blasphemed the name of God; because he was
ignorant of this, he put him in ward that the mind of the Lord might be showed
them. Levit. 24.12.

The fourth cause which came before him was this, what should be done with him
who gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day; because he was ignorant of this
cause, therefore they put him ward, because it was not declared what should be
done to him. This should teach Judges not to proceed rashly in judgment, but
to learn of Moses to ask the Lord, and to know his mind before they give out
sentence.

Fourthly, (...) Ioh. 3.7. (...). Iud. verse. 16. A judge should not be an
accepter of person.
the great Judge of the world accepts not persons in judgment, he judges
not according to the judgment of the eyes, that is, he looks not to the
outward appearance of things. When Samuel saw Eliab, a man of tall stature; he
said, Surely the Lords anointed is before me, but the Lord said to Samuel, The
Lord sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the
Lord looks on the heart, He has not eyes of flesh. Job. 10.4. (...) quorum
ius purum est a (...) lex eorum and (...) purum.
A Judge should look as near to the cause as he can, that he be not an
accepter of persons; a Judge is called detabhraja. Dan. 3.2. because he should
administer pure justice.

Judges administer not pure justice when they respect the persons of men.

The word person here is taken for any thing which the Judges respect, besides
the cause.

First, person is taken for a man's riches. Iam 2.3. Acception of persons
considered diverse ways Librare justitiam. Psalm. 58.2. The balance should be
equal making no difference betwixt lead and gold.
For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly
apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment, and if ye have
respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say unto him sit thou here
in a good place: and say to the poor, stand thou there, or sit here under my
footstool; are ye not then partial in your selves, and become Judges of evil
thoughts? here person is taken for riches. When a Judge considers a man
only, because he is rich; then he accepts his person.

There is nothing that corrupts a Judge sooner then bribes. Deuteronomy. 16.19. (...)
For a gift blinds the eyes of the wise, and Exodus 23.8. it blinds the eyes
of Pikhhim, those who see and have their eyes open; albeit, if they saw never
so well, these bribes will draw on some scales upon their eyes; there is
nothing more tender than the eye, nor may be more easily hurt; a little dust
blinds it; but when once it has drawn on a catarack, it becomes
senseless, and ye may thrust any thing into it, yet it will not feel. A
Judge then who is the eye of the civil body should take heed that this light
be not blemished, if he acquaint himself to take bribes and become Ish
terumoth, (...) Vir oblationum passive, qui recipit non qui offert oblationes.
(...)
one that receives gifts, Then he overthrows the land. Prove. 29.4. Gifts
blind the eyes. Deuteronomy. 16.19. Iagnaver, it is the same word which is used when
they took Zedekias; and pulled out his eyes out of his head. 2. King. 25.7.
Bribes do not only blind the eyes of the Judge, but pull out the eyes out of
his head; this Jude verse. 11. calls deceptio mercedis, Esaias. 33.15. and he
that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, he shall dwell on high, his
place of defense shall be the munition of rocks; Poverty and riches great
enemies to judgment.
bread shall be given him, his water shall be sure. Wise men have not thought
poor men fit to be judges, for poverty is a great tentation to corruption.
Prove. 30.8. Give me not too little, lest I be poor and steal, therefore Esaias.
3.7. he considered well who said, There is neither bread nor clothing in my
house, therefore make me not a ruler of the people. But they are more wretched
that are rich, and yet cannot be satisfied, Valerius Max. lib. 6.14.
but grind the faces of the poor. When Servius Sulpitius Galba, and Aurelius
the Consul did strive in the Senate, which of them should be sent into Spain
against Viriatum, the Senators differing among themselves, and waiting which
way Scipio would incline; he said, I give my voice that neither of them be
sent; his reason was, alter nihil habet, alteri nihil sat est: So he judged
that it was as dangerous to put the government in the hands of a rich wretch,
as into the hands of a poor man. Samuel purged himself of this vice of
avarice. 1. Sam. 12.3. Of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine
eyes therewith? Joshua was far from this sin of avarice, when he had
divided the whole land amongst the tribes, then the children of Israel gave him
an inheritance amongst them. Josh. 19.49. he was so far from covetousness,
that he took nothing to himself.

Secondly person is taken for a man's stature and comeliness. The word person
taken for a man's stature.
1. Sam. 16.7. When a Judge has regard to a man, because he is a comely
person, Plutarchus 1. Rhet. in Hyperide.
then he is an excepter of persons: Phrene the whore being condemned, one
Hyperides her advocate opened the breasts of Phrene, which moved the Judges to
pity her, this was an acceptance of persons.

Thirdly, person is taken for the country. Act. 10.34. The word person taken
for the country.
Of a truth I perceive that God is no accepter of persons, but in every nation,
he that fears him and works righteousness, is accepted with him. When a
Judge has respect to a man, because he is his country man, then he is an
accepter of persons. In that judicatory of Athens, Areopagus or mars street,
they sat in a dark place that they might neither see nor discern who was
their friend or foe, rich or poor, their country man or stanger, but only
looked to the cause; and there was given in before them T. C. contra D. C. So
the Judges in Egypt were painted without hands and blind, to signify that he
should judge truly. Esaias 11.4. and He shall not judge according to the sight
of his eyes.

If a Judge pronounce false sentence for fear, as Pilate did; If thou let him
go thou art not Caesar's friend. So for favor, as Herod to please the people,
beheaded John. Act. 11. So for hatred, Achab said, I hate Micaiah. 1. King. 22.
therefore Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and
water of affliction. Verse. 27. all these are by respects, and the Judge is an
accepter of persons when he looks to any of these, this is to turn judgment
into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood; that is, they turn
judgment into bitterness. See Lament. 3.15. When the Scribes and Pharisees
condemned Christ to die, see how they wrest judgment and turn it into
wormwood: The law is that the blasphemer should die the death. Levit. 24.16.
but they add this that they had a law, and by their law he should die the
death; because he had made himself the son of God. Ioh. 19.7. he was the
son of God, and therefore the lawgiver, then he brake not the law; they mis
apply the breach of the law to him, and they say that he should die according
to their law; this was not Gods law, it was usual to the Jews to speak
doubtfully: therefore Vzziel said, Qui perplexe loqui potest, been; si non
taceat. If a man can speak doubtfully, that is well, but if he cannot; let
him hold his peace.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: where the law fails, the land must go to decay.
Habak. 1.4. Defluit lex, it is a speech borrowed from the pulse of man. Jacobs
heart failed within him, (...)
Vajapag libbo. Genesis 45.26. where the motion of the heart or pulse grows
weak or cease, in great joy or great fear, the natural heat being then
dispersed, it hurts the body, and as we try the constitution of a man's body
by the pulse, if the pulse stir not at all, then he is dead; if it stir but
slowly then he is weak, but if it keep an equal stroke, then he is in a
good constitution. So the law is the pulse of the common wealth, if it stir
not at all, then the commonwealth is dead: if it have but small motion, then
the commonwealth is weak; but if the law keep an equal course, then the
commonwealth is in a good constitution.

EXERCITAT. II. Against false witnesses. Commandment IX.
Deuteronomy. 19.18. If the witness be a false witness that testifies falsely
against his brother, then shall he do unto him as he thought to have done to
his brother.
A false witness is the second person, A false witness is next to the Judge
who does corrupt judgment.
who corrupts the judgment, and makes the Judge to pronounce a false
sentence. First, let us consider the necessity of these witnesses; Secondly,
what witnesses; Thirdly, how many witnesses the Lord would have for the trial
of a cause; and fourthly, when they should speak and testify.

First, for the necessity of these witnesses: If God sat in every judicatorie
as he sat in the first iudicatory, when he judged Adam and Eva, then there
needed no witnesses, for all things are naked before him, but because God has
withdrawn himself, and has substitute Judges in his place who know not all
things; therefore he has appointed witnesses to give evidence to the Judges.

Secondly, What manner of witness should be admitted.
what sort of men those witnesses should be; they should be first, men of
knowledge; and secondly faithful witnesses; and thirdly, they should agree in
their testimonies. First, for their knowledge; they must hear and see. 1. Ioh.
1.3. That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you. Witnesses can
have no knowledge but by hearing and seeing; but Christ shall not judge after
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove prove after the hearing of his ears.
Esaias. 11.3. and Solomon says, that A false witness shall perish, but he that
hears, speaks constantly. Prove. 21.28. In the Talmud the trial of the
witnesses is set down, how they tried them by seven demands: First, qua
septimana Iubilaei factum est; in what week of the Iubile did this fall out?
Secondly, qua hebdomade annali, in what week of the year? Thirdly, quali
septem inter singulos Iubilaeos interfluente, that is, in which of the Sevenths
in the Iubile did this fall out? Fourthly, quo die mensis, what day of the
month? Fifthly, what day of the week? Sixthly, at what hour? and Seventhly, in
what place did such a thing fall out.

Secondly, the witnesses should be faithful. Revel. 3.14. These things says
the Amen, the faithful and true witness. Prove. 14.5. A faithful witness
will not fly; If he be a true witness indeed, Multa dicuntur in Scripturis
juxta opinionem estimantium illo tempore. Ioh. 8.28. non introierunt in
pratorium no ipsi contaminarentur, id est, ut ipsi existmabant. S^^ Ier. 28.1.
Hananiah dicitur propheta, cum tamen Pseudopropheta.
or reputed to be a true witness, he may be admitted. Esaias. 8.2. Vrijah is
called a faithful witness, who was in effect an idolater; yet because he was
reputed to be a faithful man among the people; therefore he is called a
faithful witness. The nearer that men approach to the Lord, their greater
care should be to speak the truth. Romans 9.1. I say the truth in Christ, I lie
not. So it is the greatest sin to lie to the Holy Ghost. Act. 4.3. It is a
greater sin for a Preacher to be a false witness, then for another witness
in a civil court; because he draws near to God. 1. Cor. 15.14. If Christ be
not risen, then is our preaching in vain, and we are found false witnesses of
God. So to wrest the word (...). 2. Pet. 3.16. It is a speech borrowed from
those, who put a man upon the rack, and make him speak that which he never
thought. So unstable souls when they wrest the Scriptures to draw out a sense
out of them which they never meant. It is a greater sin to witness a
falsehood in judgment, then out of judgment, because they draw nearer to the
Lord, such were those false witnesses, who testified against Christ, and
wrested his words. Christ said not, destruam, as they alleged; neither, Dei
templum; neither, possum illud redintegrare, but only this, Destroy this
temple, and in three days it shall be built up again. Ioh. 2. So that one
word being changed, the sense may be perverted, Prove. 17.9. He that repeateth
a matter, separateth friends; that is, he that repeateth a matter changing
something in it, or not keeping the words, interpret them maliciously, these
were not admitted to be witnesses; some propter culpam, as the infamous:
secondly, for defect of judgment, as fools and children: thirdly, propter
affectum, as friends and enemies: fourthly, for their condition, and estate, as
the poor and servants: fifthly, for their sex, as women: sixthly, for their
calling, as usurers and publicans: and the Jews added seventhly dove-sellers,
as infamous, because they taught doves miphriche jonin, they taught the doves
to fly, (...)
and to carry their messages, which was a divination which they used when Satan
was the carrier, therefore they hated dove-sellers, and admitted them not as
winesses.

Thirdly, witnesses must not only be men of knowledge and faithful, but they
must agree in witnessing, and jumpe together in their testimonies; otherwise
their testimonies do not prove: they should be non solum testes, sed contestes,
and these three agree in one, 1. Ioh. 5.7. Mark says, that the testimonies of
those who testified against Christ were not (...), they agreed not together,
and thus much for the conditions required in the witnesses.

Now follows the third thing to be considered in the witnesses, and it is the
number: The number of witnesses required in Iudge^ mentm^^n^.
At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the
matter be established, Deuteronomy. 19.16. In the great point of our salvation the
Lord uses three witnesses in heaven, and three in earth to confirm our
redemption: the three in heaven, are, The Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost,
1. Ioh. 5.7. And so the three in earth are, The Spirit, the Water, and the
Blood, and these three agree in one. So in the censures and admonitions of the
Church, there must be two or three witnesses. 2, Cor. 13.1. This is the third
time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every
word be established.

In civil judicatories some make this exception, one witness may suffice, if
the matter questioned be to no man's hurt. A man is called in question whether
he be baptized or not: or whether he be married or not: one honest witness
may serve to prove this, because it tends to no man's hurt.



Deuteronomy. 17.6. and Dan. 13. but afterward the Judge, the accuser, and the
witnesses were all distinguished; when it is said, Ioh. 8.10. Woman, where are
those trine accusers? the witnesses should have accused the woman, but they
being convict in their own conscience, went out one by one.

What time the witnesses are to bear witness. (...)
Lastly, the witnesses are bound to testify when they are required by the
Judge, and if the matter require they are bound to testify, albeit the Judge
ask them not: therefore guana, respondere, with the Hebrewe, signifies as
well to answer to the matter, as to the Judge, and so Christ is said to answer
when no man asked him: So 1. Sam. 11.17. To answer is to answer according to
ones desire, Eccles. 10.19. Money answers to all things, That is, to every
man's desire: to answer then is to speak when time and cause requires. When a
cause requires, a witness is bound to answer to deliver the innocent, Prove.
24.11. and A true witness delivers souls, Prove. 14.25. They knew me from
the beginning, if they would testify, Act. 26.5.

Because the chief part of judgment depends upon the witnesses, The
witnesses were to do sundry things against the guilty.
therefore under the law the witnesses did sundry things in the execution of
the guilty. First they laid their hands upon him, to signify that they
devolved all the guilt upon his own head, and that he did die for his own
fault, hence is that phrase, His mischief shall return upon his own head.
Psalm. 7.16. therefore a man's condemnation is expressed by laying on hands upon
his head, Heb. 10.29. Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be
thought worthy: in the Syriacke it is expressed by laying on the hands upon the
head; he alludeth to the custom under the law, where the witnesses laid their
hands upon the head of him who was to be stoned, Levit. 24.15. and the Greeks
say (...), and the Latins say, Quod illorum capiti sit.

The second thing which the witnesses did under the law, they stoned the guilty
man; and before they stoned him, they laid aside their upper garments, that
they might be the more fit to throw stones at him, Act. 7.58. They cast him out
of the city and stoned him, and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a
young man's feet, whose name was Saul, and after the witnesses threw stones at
him. Lastly the people stoned him, to signify that the guiltiness of that
person might not defile the land: and also for their detestation of the crime.

Ministers have a special privilege in judgment, 1. Tim. 5.19. Against an
Elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses; that is,
they must be testes assistentes, before any accusation be intended against
them: against another, an accusation may be intended, if the accuser will bind
himself to follow the accusation of him whom he accused: but a minister has a
greater privilege, that it must be known before hand, whether there be two or
three witnesses, to prove this accusation against him, before ever his name be
called in question. The reason why the Lord would have them ready to testify,
Why the Lord would have present witnesses, when the Ministers or Elders are
accused.
was this; the Lord has a great care and respect to his Gospel, and has put
this treasure in earthly vessels; first, he will have no man to touch them, or
do them any harm, Psalm. 105.15. Secondly, he will have maintenance given to
them, that they may be encouraged in the law of the Lord, 2. Chron. 21.4.
Thirdly, he has a great care of their credit and good name, for if the
accusation were not followed presently, then the Elder all this time lay under
the slander, and the accuser was, the conqueror; David speaking of God, Psalm.
51.4. says, That thou may be justified when thou speak, A difference
betwixt these, to overcome in judgment, and to be clear.
and be clear when thou judge, that is, when thou art judged and called in
question by men, but Paul citing the place, Romans 3.4. That thou may overcome
when thou art judged; why does he put overcome, for pure or clear? because
none overcomes in judgment but he that is pure or clear, now all the while
that the Elder lies under the slander he is judged impure, and the accuser
overcomes. But when the matter is put to a trial, the Elder is found clear
and pure, and overcomes, and the accuser is overcome and blotted. Here we see
the necessity of present witnesses, that the Elders good name lie not under
such a blot, and that he make not the Gospel to be evil spoken of, as the
sons of Eli did; who made the sacrifices to be abhorred.

And there is great necessity why the Lord should have such a care of the
minister, for it has been still the policy of the devil to blot their good
name. See it in the example of Narcissus bishop of Jerusalem, and Athanasius,
and sundry others.

The consectaries that follow upon this, are first, that

Secondly, that Magistrates should be more unwilling

Thirdly, that God will not exempt his Elders from

The conclusion of this is, Conclusion.
all evidence depends upon the witnesses in judgment, therefore the
witnesses should be most careful to testify the truth; they stand before the
Lord, Deuteronomy. 19.17. The witnesses stand in the Lords presence.
Testes sistent se coram Jehovah, if they testify an untruth, they lie in the
presence of God; so they testify against the innocent parties, and they are
the cause of their death; such were the false witnesses who testified against
Naboth, 1. King. 21.13. and Doeg against David and Ahimelech the Priest. 1.
Sam. 22.9. and such was Ziba against Mephiboseth, 2. Sam. 16.3. and Vriah
against Jeremy, Ierem. 27.17. the witnesses against Christ, Matt. 26.61. and
they who witnessed against Steven, Act. 6.13.

EXERCITAT. III. Against equivocation. Commandment. IX.
Psalm. 15.2. He that speaks the truth in his heart.
WHen a man that is called in question answers by equivocation, then it is a
breach of this Commandment in judgment.

Two sorts of equivocation.
There are two sorts of equivocation, the first is called Logical, the second
is, when men equivocate by mental reservation.

Aequivocatio Logica. Mentalis

Logical equivocation is this, when a speech does carry a double sense, or may
be construed two ways: Example, What logical equivocation is.
The head of the butler shall be lift up, and the head of the baker shall be
lift up, Genesis 40. to lift up here is a logical equivocation, for sometimes it
signifies to exalt a man to honor, as the butler was; and sometimes to hang
up a man, as the baker was. So, Let the dead bury their dead, Luc. 9.60. this
is a logical equivocation in speech, that is, let them who are spiritually
dead bury those who are naturally dead. So Matt. 7.1. Judge not, that ye be
not judged, Iudicium Libertatis. Potestatis.

this word judging is taken two ways. The first is Iudicium libertatis, the
second is Iudicium potestatis.

When logical equivocation is lawful.
Logical equivocation is lawful, when it is used to convince senseless
sinners, who will not believe the truth when it is plainly told them. Example:
Ezekiel. 12.13. The Lord threatened that he would bring Zedekiah king of Judah
into the land of Chaldea, and that he should die there, and yet never see it.
Why does the Lord set down this speech so mystically unto him? because this
perfidious king would not believe the truth when it was plainly told him, he
died in Babel and yet he never saw it, because his eyes were picked out at
Riblah.

Example 2. 2. King. 8.10. A twofold equivocation logical, in pointing, and
words or speecies.
And Elisha said unto Hasael, go and say unto him, thou may certainly
recover, howbeit the Lord has showed me thou shall certainly die: this is a
logical equivocation, first in pointing, and then in the words. In pointing
leh emur lo chaje tohje, (...)
here is a double reading, the marginall, and the text reading: the marginall
reading thus, Say unto him, thou may certainly recover, albeit the Lord has
showed me that he shall surely die. The new translation follows this
reading: the text reading is thus, Go tell him he shall not live, because the
Lord has showed me he shall certainly dye. In the first reading it is set
down indefinitely, he may live or not live, because the disease was not
deadly: but in the second reading it is set down definitely, because the Lord
said he should die. The Hebrews observe, Regula Hebraeorum.
that when a negative is set down before two verbes coming from the same
root, When the note of negation denies, and when it is indefinite.
then commonly it denies doubtfully, as when the serpent said to Eva non
moriendo morieru; perhaps ye may die, and perhaps ye may not die, Genesis 3. but
when the note of denial is set betwixt the two verbes, then it certainly
denies, as moriendo non morieris Ye shall not dye at all; the note was set
before both the verbes in Satan's speech, and therefore it is but doubtfully
denied. The text again may be read two ways, because of the accent, maccaph,
which sometimes is euphonicus accentus, and sometimes syntacticus; A twofold
accent, euphonick and syntactick.
if it be euphonicus accentus, then it is read this ways without distinction
(for euphonia is not a note of distinction) Abi dic ei, non vivendo vives, as
though there were not an accent here, but if maccaph be syntacticus accentus,
then it is read with a distinction thus, Abi dic, non vivendo vives, here the
rest is placed after dic, and Iunius follows this reading.

This example is also an equivocation in speech.
This is also an example of logical equivocation in speech, Go tell him he may
live, although the Lord said he should die; if ye respect his sickness, he
might live, for it was not deadly, yet the Lord said he should die, respecting
that which Hazael should do unto him, for he did did cast a wet cloth upon
him, and smothered him. Why the Lord set down this speech so doubtfully?
because faithless Benhadad would not believe the truth when it was plainly
told him.

Another example of logical equivocation is this, I will join thee in
affinity this day with one of the two. 1. Sam. 18.21. which carries a double
sense, either I will give the one of them this present day, (...)
or that day, that is, when thou bring me an hundredth foreskins of the
Philistines.

Logical equivocation when it is unlawful.
Logical equivocation is not lawful when it tends to deceive men: Genesis 3.5.
Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil; this caryeth a double sense, first
to know evil by contemplation; A twofold knowledge, by contemplation, and by
miserable experience.
Secondly by woeful experience; we know a fever in the first sense before ever
we feel it, but in the second sense we know it when we feel it burning us;
Act. 1. Now I know in verity, this was experimental knowledge. In the first
sense, we know the privation by the habit; and in the second sense, we know
the want of the habit by the privation. Logical equivocation is then a sin,
when it serves either to pervert religion or justice; but when the Lord uses
it against wicked and senseless sinners who will not believe the truth, when
it is plainly told them, then it is no sin.

The second sort of equivocation is by mental reservation, Equivocation by
mental reservation.
when a speech is patched up, and the one part is expressed, and the other part
is reserved in the mind of the speaker; and this is now called Jesuitical
equivocation, and they say that such a proposition, mixta ex mentali and vocali
est legitima; this kind of equivocation is no ways lawful, for in a
theological truth there must be an agreement betwixt the mind, the matter,
and the tongue; but here there is no agreement betwixt these three, for when a
Judge demands of a Priest, are you a Priest? he answers, I am not a Priest,
when he knows certainly in his mind that he is a Priest, and yet his
tongue says he is not a Priest; this is the most formal lie that can be made.

To clear this the better, Simulare and dissimulare quid.
we must mark what it is simulare, and what it is dissimulare.

Simulare is to counterfeit that which is not in a man; dissimulare is to
dissemble, that which he is bound to profess, and this is done sundry ways.
First, simulare vocationem. 1. King. 13.18. Simulare vocationem.
as when the old Prophet fained that he had a commission from the Lord to the
young Prophet to eat at Bethel. So when Zidkiah made horns and said, So shall
thou push the Syrians until thou have confounded them, 1. King. 22.11. So the
word Hithnabbi, impulit se ad prophetandum, (...)
is usually spoken of false Prophets, who fained that they had a calling from
the Lord when they had none; So the false Prophet that wore a rough gown that
he might deceive the people. Zach. 13.4. So, dissimulare vocationem;
Dissimulare vocationem.
as Peter denied that he was one of Christ's Disciples.

Secondly, simulare professionem; as Esth. 9. Simulare professionem.
Many for fear became Jews, the Seventy translate it (...), they were
circumcised; so the Sichemites when they circumcised themselves that they might
obtain Dina; this was a counterfeit profession. So hypocrites when they make a
show of religion. Dissimulare professionem.
So to dissimulate their profession as the Jews did, who for fear of
Antiochus persecution drew their prep^ce that they might not be known to be
Jews; and the Apostle means of this, Art thou circumcised? draw not thy
prepuce. 1. Cor. 7.18. Epiphanius calls the instrument wherewith they drew
their prepuce, (...) traho.

Simulare conditionem.
Thirdly, to simulate or dissimulate their condition or estate; to simulate, as
David before Achis did simulate and counterfeit that he was mad. (...) fictam
actionem notat. Dissimulare conditionem. (...) qui fingit se divitem. (...) qui
fingit se pauperem. Simulare sexum.
1. Sam. 31. So 2. Sam. 13. Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thy self to be
sick. So Prove. 13.7. There is that makes himself rich, yet has nothing;
Iesh mithgnashar; so to dissemble their condition or estate, there is that
makes himself poor, yet has great riches; Mithroshash, such was the
dissimulation of the Gibeonites. Josh 9.

Fourthly, to simulate or dissimulate their sex; to simulate, as when a woman
puts upon her a man's apparel, to make men believe that she is a man. So
to dissimulate their sex, Dissimulare sexum.
as when Sardanapalus put a woman's apparel upon him, and sat spinning
amongst them.

When a Priest stands before a Judge and is examined; First, he dissembleth
his vocation, for he denies that he is a Priest; Secondly, he dissembleth
his profession, for he is bound as a Christian to tell the truth, not only in
matters of faith, but also to answer to a civil truth, when it is demanded of
him; and as he dissembleth, so does he simulate, wearing counterfeit
apparel; simulating a courtier or some other laike man.

There are three things required in a truth.
Truth is first, in the matter; then in the mind; and thirdly, in the tongue.
It is first, in the matter as a simple truth, Veritas in Objecte. Subjecte.
Sign.

but as it is completa veritas, a full truth or falsehood; it is first, in our
mind; for our mind composeth and divides first; and as health is objective,
first, in physic, but properly and formally in the man who is healed; so
although truth be first objective, in the simple object; yet completa veritas,
is first in the mind, and then in the word or writing; verity is in the matter
as in the object; it is in the mind as in the subject; and it is in the
speech, as in the sign; and there should be an agreement betwixt all these
three, the matter, the mind, and the tongue; hence it is that the Scripture
attributes those things which are proper to the heart, to the tongue, because
of the agreement that should be betwixt them. Psalm. 45. My tongue shall
meditate on thy justice. So Act. 2. My tongue was glad, because the tongue
expresses the gladness of the heart. So Josh. 1.8. This book of the law
shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate in it day and night.
So Prove. 3.3. Bind them about thy neck, and write them upon the table of thine
heart; First, verity must be in the heart, and then the words are framed in the
throat; therefore he says, Bind them about thy neck, and then they come to the
tongue.

This verity which is the conception of the mind is uttered two ways; either,
per signum vocale, The conceptions of the mind uttered two ways.
by some other sign, whereby we express our mind, which is a kind of
speech, and therefore Solomon says, Proverb. 6.13. He speaks with his feet,
he teaches with his fingers.

When one sent a messenger to Periander to ask him how he could reign so
securely amongst his subjects, he answered no other thing to the messengers,
but brought them out to a field of ripe corn, and with his staff beat off the
ears of corn, which was as much in effect, as if he had said, if thou would
live securely amongst thy subjects, cut the heads from some of them.

To use signs that are arbitrary and not received amongst all nations, When
people are deceived with signs common to all nations, yet it is not a lie.
although he be deceived with whom thou have to do, it is not thy fault,
neither is this deceit; this kind of dissimulation the fathers call it (...):
such was that stratagem of Joshua when he fled from Hai; So when the Romans
cast bread into the camp of the enemies out of the Capitol, Livium lib. 5.
to make them believe that they had plenty of victuals, although the enemies
were deceived here, yet this was no fault in the Romans; Haet signa usurpari
possunt, quia non communi iustituto usurpata, that is, those signs may be
used, because they are not generally received nor agreed upon by all people,
but those things which are generally received amongst all people, as their
speech, and writing, Hieroglyphics, and such; here if we speak one thing and
mean another, this is a falsehood.

When a man is deceived by an ambiguous word, it is not a li^.
When a word has many significations, and if that which a man conceives in his
mind agrees with one of the significations, he makes not a lie, although
the man who hears him, conceive it otherwise; as when Christ said, Beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees, although the Disciples took it for leaven indeed,
yet it was not a lie; and the superior may speak otherwise then he thinks,
for trial of the truth. Example, we have in Joseph, who being the governor in
Egypt, said, Ye are spies. Genesis 43. and then accused them of theft; but the
inferior may not answer so doubtfully to his superior.

The mind is expressed by answering to the question three ways. Respondere ad
diversum. ad idem. ad contrarium.

We express our mind when we answer to a thing, either ad idem, ad diversum,
vel ad contrarium. Example, when Abimelech asked Abraham, Is this woman thy
wife? If Abraham should have answered, she is my wife; then he had answered, ad
idem, and he would not have made a lie. Secondly, when he answer she is my
sister, here he answered ad diversum, and this was not a lie; for this word
sister is taken in a large sense amongst the Hebrews; and so a wife may be
called a sister Paul says, Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife,
as well as other Apostles. 1. Cor. 9.5. and so sister is taken for one that is
near in kindred, as Sarah was to Abraham. Thirdly, if he had answered, she is
not my wife; then he had answered per contrarium, and had made a lie: So when a
man utters his mind, per signum reale, A real sign answers to the mind
three ways.
sometimes the sign answers, ad idem; sometimes ad diversum; and sometimes
ad contrarium; it answers ad idem; when a man may gather at the first by the
sign, that the party with whom he has to do thinks so, as he
demonstrateth by this sign. Example, when Esther fell down before Ashuerus
King of Persia, to petition him for the Jews her contrymen; Ashuerus held
out the scepter to her. Esth. 5.2. here Esther knew by this sign that the King
was minded to grant her petition, and the King answered ad idem, by this sign,
to the petition of Esther.

Sometimes the sign is diversum, from that which a man thinks when he makes
such a sign, this is not a real lie; because it is not contrary to his mind.
Example, when Joseph knew his brethren, (...) altenum se finxir.
he made himself strange to them, Vaijthnakker. Genesis 42.7. this he did to try
them the better, but not for another end. So Joshua and his army fained
themselves to fly before the men of Ai. Josh. 8. but this they did at the
commandment of the Lord, for he allowed this stratagem, as may be seen Verse.
18. So Christ simulated that he would have gone farther, and not stay at Emaus
all night. Luc. 24.28. This simulation was not contrary to his mind, but
diversum; he simulated that he would go forward, that he might make the
Disciples to be the more earnest with him to bid him stay; and this simulation
has this tacit condition annexed to it, I will not stay at Emaus unless my
Disciples be very earnest with me to stay.

A Physician has a patient that cannot abide such physic as will cure him,
Simile,
the Physician deludeth the senses of the patient, to make the patient believe
that it is some other thing; here this sign is not contrary to the Physicians
mind, for he minds to make this a sign to cure his patient: the sign is
diversum here, but not contrarium; but when the sign or the word is contrary
to that which the mind thinks, then it is a lie. Example, Psalm. 18.
Mendaciter se subijcient mihi, they shall yield fained obedience to me; for
when they made outward shows of obedience to David, they thought no such thing
in their heart. Jacob put the skins of goats upon his hands, and upon the
smooth of his neck, and then he said to his father; A twofold lie in Jacob, in
words and signs.
I am Esau thy first borne. Genesis 27.19. here was a double lie, a lie in words,
and a lie in sign, both contrary to his mind. So 1. King. 14.5. When the wife
of Jeroboam fained herself to be another woman, that she might deceive the
Prophets; this was a real lie contrary to her mind: for if the Prophet had
demanded of her, art thou the wife of Jeroboam or not? doubtless she would
have answered I am not the wife of Jeroboam, but some other woman; and so she
should have made a double lie, contrary to her mind, both in her apparel,
and in her speech.

When a Priest stands before a Judge clothed in Scarlet, and with long
hair, the Judge demands of him, art thou a Priest? he answers, I am not a
Priest; this is a lie in words. Again, he makes a real lie in wearing such
apparel, that he may not be taken for a Priest, and so both the signs and
words are contrary to his mind. And as the Lord said to Ahija the Prophet. 1.
King. 14.5. The wife of Jeroboam comes to ask a thing of thee, and when she
comes in she shall feign her self to be another woman, and the Prophet
said unto her, why fainest thou thy self to be another woman. So the Lord
says to the Judge, the man who stands before thee, would feign himself not
to be a Priest; A difference betwixt real and verbal signs.
but the Judge may say unto him, why fainest thou thy self to be another man?

We must put a difference between real and verbal signs, for words do more
indefinitely determine the mind of the speaker, than signs do. Signs again
do more confusedly and indeterminately express the mind, and therefore it is
more lawful to use the one rather than the other. Example, when a man upon the
stage puts on a Kings apparel, this is not a real lie, but if he should
say upon a stage that he were the King, that were a real lie; and because all
men know that Kings play not upon the stage; therefore there is no great danger
of a lie, but when the sign is hardly discerned; and made to cover a lie; then
it is a lie indeed.

When the Lord threatened Ninive that it should be destroyed within forty
days, and it was not destroyed; God in threatening to destroy Ninive and not
doing it, yet it was not a lie.
this was not a Jesuitical lie, for it is the usual manner of the Prophets to
understand the condition, and suppress it when they threaten, which may be
easily understood by the like phrases, as the Prophet said to Ezekiah. Esaias.
38. Set thine house in order, for thou shall die and not live. Here the
threatening is set down, but the condition is understood; to wit, if thou pray
not; but when Ezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord;
then God sent his Prophet back again to him with this commission; Tell
Hezekiah the captain of my people, thus says the Lord, the God of David thy
father; I have heard thy prayers, I have seen thy tears, behold I will heal
thee on the third day; Sometimes God sets down both the condition and the
threatening.
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years. 2. King. 20. Sometimes again,
both the threatening and the condition is set down; as Genesis 20.7. Now restore
the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and will pray for thee, and thou shall
live; and if thou restore her not, know then that thou shall surely die; thou
and all that are thine.

So when a Judge for examination and trial setreth down a thing not thetice,
by way of assertion, A Judge may examine thetic^ and interrogatorie.
but by way of intrerogation and trial; this is not a lie. So Solomon called
for a sword to cut the child, when he was not minded to cut the child, but
only to try who was the mother of the child. 1. King. 3. So when Christ bad
his disciples give bread to the multitude to feed them, whereas he knew that
they had not bread sufficient to feed them; this was not a lie, but only to
try the obedience of the Disciples. Mat. 14.16. So we propound Elenches to
young scholars to try them, which we know to be false in themselves.

When in ironie or jest we bid a man do such a thing, but we will him not do
it, this is not a lie; as when Michaiah said to Ach^^, A man may use an ironie
and not lie.
Go up and prosper. 1. King. 22.15. And so Christ said to his Disciples,
Sleep on now and take your rest. Mat. 26.45. these are not lies, for in such
speeches we may know by the gestures of the speakers that they do but jest.

Peter when he dissembled.

Peter did not this to deceive any man, but only for fear to save his life.





Cor. 4.3. We handled not the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of
the truth, commending our selves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
Paul here manifests the truth both before God and man, but the Jesuits in
their equivocations, manifest not the truth before God and man.

They answer,

Then the Martyrs were great fools who did not learn to equivocate this way,
to save their lives.

Heb. 6.6. An oath is the end of all controversies, but equivocation
multiplyeth controversies.

They answer, we may not equivocate before a Judge who proceeds formally, and
is a competent Judge:

When the Shunamitish woman said to Elisha, Thou man of God do not lie unto
thine handmaid. 2. King. 4.17. Hierome says well, Etiam inter hosts servanda
est fides: we must deal truly even to our enemies.

The conclusion of this is: Psalm. 5.6. And those great liars shall be shut out
of the holy city, Revel. 22.15.

EXERCITAT. IV. Against lies. Commandment. IX.
Revelat. 21.27. And there shall in no wise enter into the holy Jerusalem, any
thing that defiles, or makes a lie.
A man may be a lier two ways.
THe lier is a false witness as well out of judgment as in judgment.

In natural things, a thing is said to lie, when it makes a fair show, but
it performs not that which it promises, (...) Mentitum est opus olivae.
Habak. 3.17. The labor of the olive shall fail, but in the original it is,
Kichas, it shall lie the olive is said to lie, when it blossometh pleasantly in
the spring, but when it comes to the harvest it fails. Esaias 58.11. Thou
shall be like a spring of water, whose waters fail not: in the original it
is, whose waters lie not. So when men speak and make a show of words in one
thing, If the words and mind differ, it is a lie.
and think another, it is a lie, but this does not fully express the nature
of a lie, for if a man speak a thing thinking it to be a truth, and it be not
a truth in it self, August.
it is a lie; for every untruth is a lie, Ioh. 8. When a man teaches an
untruth, thinking that it is a truth, then he is a lier, and therefore mentiri,
contra mentem ire, expresses not the full nature of a lie, for a man may
speak a lie, and not speak contrary to his mind.

Three sorts of lies.
Lies are commonly divided into three sorts. The first they call mendacium
jocosum, when a man ^ttereth a lie in sport to make others merry, Hosea. 7.3.
They make the King glad with their wickedness, and the Princes with their
lies. If, We may not teach the truth to please men, Gal. 1.10. much less may
we tell an untruth to please men: and if a man may not lie to help a man out
of danger; much less to delight him. For as the Schoolmen say well, Bonum
utile prefertur bono delectabili.

The second sort of lie, is Officiosum mendacium, when a man makes a lie to
help others; will ye speak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully of him.
Job. 13.7. will any man make a lie for Gods cause; he that stands not in
need of our goods, Psalm. 16. far less stands he in need of any of our
evil: Nullum verum fundatur in falso, omne tamen falsum innititur alicui vero:
God who is truth, will not be served by a lie, and if we may not lie for Gods
cause, and for his glory; much less may we lie for man's good, to make a lie
in charity, is to make charity the daughter of a lie, and the devil to be the
grandfather. Charity rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth, 1.
Cor. 13.6.

There are three sorts of liars. First, the natural liar. Secondly, the
habitual lier: And thirdly, There are three sorts of liars.
the subtle lier.

The natural lier, as Psalm 116. All men are liers. So Sarah made a lie, Genesis
18.

The habitual lier, as those of Crete; Cretenses sunt mendaces, The Cretians
are always liars, Tit. 1.12. Suidas.
the ground of this proverb arose from Theseus, when he went against Crete,
and overcame it, one of the Cretians went to Greece, and told his father
Aegaeu^; that he was slain, and he for displeasure drowned himself, (...)
Assuunt mendacium mendacio.
whereupon the proverb rose, Cretenses mendaces. So Psalm. 119.69. The proud
have forged lies against me, in the original it is taphiu gnalai sheker, They
have sowed one lie to another.

The third sort of liers, are the subtle liers, Prove. 3.25. (...) Septuag.
(...) arantes absurda. ARARE MENDACIVM quid apud Hebraeos.
Devise not evil against thy neighbor, In the Hebrew it is, al tacharosh,
noli arare mendacium: plow not a lie: it is a speech borrowed from husbandry,
for as the husband man ploweth up the ground, and searches into the earth with
the share of the plough, so does a wicked man turn over and over the heart of
him, how to excogitate and find out a lie: but in this sort of husbandry, as
he ploweth iniquity and sows wickedness, so he shall reap the same.

Whether Jacob made a lie.
WHen Jacob said to his father Isaac, I am your son Esau, your first borne,
Genesis 27.19. this was not a lie, if ye will respect Esau, for Esau had sold him
his birthright already: but it was a lie, if ye will respect Jacob himself,
Neither a tropicall, nor a figurative speech is a lie.
because he deceived his father by it: a tropicall speech is not a lie; as
Herod is a fox, so neither is a figurative speech, Matt. 11.14. John is Elias,
Jacob might have called himself Esau, if he had not done this to deceive his
father, and there concurred a number of lies besides here: first I have done as
thou have commanded me, Verse. 19. he bad bring him venison, and he brought him
kids flesh. Again he said, The Lord my God brought it to me. Verse. 20. here is
a greater lie in abusing the name of God, and last he made a real lie in
putting on the skins of the kids of goats, that he might deceive his old father
Isaac, but here we may lament the infirmities of the Patriarchs, and admire
the great mercies of God in pardoning them.

Whether David made a lie.
The first lie that David made.
THe first lie that David made was to Ahimelech the Priest that he might get of
the show bread, 1. Sam. 21.1. Davia said, that the king had commanded him a
business, whereas he had no such commandment from the king.

Christ justifies David in the necessity, but not in the fact of the lie.
But Christ justified David's fact, Matt. 12. therefore he made not a lie.

Christ justified him that in necessity he went and got of the shewbread, but
he justified not his lie; so God wills that Jacob should get the blessing;
but he justified neither Rebeceahs deceit, nor Jacobs lie. David knew that the
Priest might make bold to give him this bread, and therefore he made a lie.

Whether was it an officious, or a pernicious lie in David.

It was but an officious lie to save his life.

But it may be said that this lie of David was a pernicious lie, because this
lie was the occasion of the death of the Priests. 1 Samuel 22.22. And David said
unto Abiather, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would
surely tell Saul, I have occasioned the death of all these persons in thy
fathers house; here he takes the blame upon him, as though he were the cause
of this murder.

When David saw Doeg there, David made but an officious lie to Ahimelech, for
he had gotten the bread before he saw Doeg.
he conjectured that he would tell Saul, but he knew not of the tragical
event, that he would kill all the priests, and by all probability he had
spoken first with the Priest, and gotten the show bread from him before that he
saw Doeg, for if he had seen him before, he would have gone more warily to
work.

The second lie that David made, is alleged, 1. Whether David caused Jonathan
to make a lie to Saul.
Sam. 20.6. If thy father at all miss me, then say; David earnestly asked
leave of me, that he might run to Bethleem his city, for there is a yearly
sacrifice there, for all the family: he was going now to the field to hide
himself for fear, from Saul, how then bids he Jonathan tell that he was
gone to Bethleem to keep the feast?

In charity we are rather to think that he both hid himself, and kept the
feast at Bethleem, Jeremy 38.24, 25, 26. was commanded by Zedekiah.

1. Sam. 27.10. And Achis said to David, Whether David made a lie to Achis.
whither have ye made a rode to day? and David said, against the South of
Judah, and against the south of the Ierachmelites, and the South of the Kenites,
and David saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath, saying
lest they should tell on us, saying so did David, and so will his manner be all
the while that he dwells in the country of the Philistims: And Achis
believed David, saying, he has made his people utterly to abhor him,
therefore he shall be my servant for ever. Here it seems David made a lie to
Achis.

David made this rode upon the south of Judah his country men, and killed them,
which had been a great cruelty and barbaritie, or rather through infirmity,
that he spoke somewhat ambiguously to the king, telling him that he had made
a rode upon the South, but how far he made a rode upon the south, he tells
him not: he said that he had killed a number of the south, but he told him not
whether they were Jews or Philistims; for they were Philistims whom he killed,
and not Jews, Verse. 11.

Raphael a lie or not when he called himself Azarias the son of Ananias of
the tribe of Nephtalim, Tobit. 5.

Asmodeus the evil spirit.

Abraham are called men. Genesis 18.

Raphael if he had been an angel to call himself a man.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is; Let us shun all lies, for if we delight in lies,
then we are the children of the devil, Job. 8.44 and to lie is a part of the
old man, which must be mortified and laid aside, Ephesians. 4.25. Coloss 3.9.

EXERCITAT. V. Against boasting of our selves. Commandment IX.
Prove. 27.6. Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth.
THis Commandment condemns boasting of any thing in our selves, this is
called (...). (...), Suiipsius laudatio.


The ground of this boasting is self-love, and the conceit of our selves,
hence comes swellings, 2. Cor. 12.20. and then bragging.

First then, a man must not brag of his knowledge, What things a man must not
brag of.
They said they saw well enough when they were blind, Revelat. 3.17.

So a man must not brag of his holiness, as the Pharisee did, Luc. 18.11. I
thank thee O God, that I am not as other men are, and such as said, Stand by
thy self, come not near to me; for I am holyer then thou, Esaias. 65.5.

Thirdly, he must not brag of his works, Romans 3.27. So neither of his
perseverance, this was Peter's brag; Matt. 26.33. Though all men be offended
because of thee, yet will I never be offended. It is a good thing when Moses
face shines, and he knows not.

As a man may not brag of his spiritual estate, A man should neither brag
of his strength nor riches.
so neither may he brag of his bodily strength, as Goliath did, nor of his
riches, Ier. 9.23. Let not the mighty man glory in his might; Let not the rich
man glory in his riches. So Hos. 12.8. Ephraim said, I am become rich, I have
found me out substance. he braggeth of his substance, but tells not of whom
he had them; such was the proud brag of Benhadad. 1. King. 20.10. God do so,
and more to me also, if the dust of Samaria shall be handfuls, for all the
people that shall follow. So Esaias 14. Nebuchadnezzars brag, I have set my
throne above the stars, and I have gathered all the earth, as one gathers
eggs.

A man must not boast of his security.
Neither must they brag of their worldly security, such was the brag of
Babylon, I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow* Revelat.
18.7. Esaias. 47.8. Solomon says, It is not good to eat much honey, so he that
searches his own glory shall perish, Prove. 25.27. as honey taken moderately is
wholesome, but to eat too much of it, makes a way to surfeit: so it is not
good for a man to search his own praise, or to brag too much of himself.
And whereas he goes about thus to get friends by bragging, he loses his
friends.

Lastly, let not a man brag of the victory before it be gotten, Let him not
brag who girdeth on the harness, but he who lays it aside. 1. King. 20.11.

The assuming of glorious titles is a great bragging.
Kings and great men must not arrogate too great and high titles to themselves,
for this is a proud boasting. Alexander the great, commanded to call himself
the son of Jupiter Hammon. So Sapor king of Persia in his letters to
Constantine, began with these titles: King of kings, Sapor prince of the
stars, the brother of the Sun, and the moon, wishes all health to
Constantine. So to call themselves, The great king, a title which is only
proper to God. Matt. 5.25. Thou shall not swear by Jerusalem, for it is the
city of the great king, (...) Majestas, superbia.
such is the proud title of the Othmans, gnottoma, signifies pride and
majesty, hence comes the proud name Othman, which we call Ottaman. (...) Rex
superb^s.
So the titles which the Pope takes to himself; calling himself, Christ's
Vicar upon earth, and those titles which his flatterers give unto him.

Simon Magus ascribed a little to himself, calling himself some great one.
Act. 8.9. and the people called him, the great power of God. So the proud style
which the Church of Rome takes to her, calling herself the mother Church.
Whereas the Jewish Church called the Church of the Gentiles, her sister. Cant.
8.8. So the proud titles which the Pharisees and Doctors of the Jews took to
themselves, (...)
they were called Pekachim aperti, because they only saw; and leaders of the
blind. Romans 2.19. and they would not be content to be called (...), lovers of
wisdom; but (...), wise men; therefore they said, (...), the wise men will
teach traditions the day, and they were called Merobhetz hatorah, (...)
because they made the law to rest amongst them; and they said of the common
people, populus terrae scabellum pedum Pharisaeorum. One of them was called Or
hagnolum, the light of the world; and the title of Rabbi Judah was Rabboni
hakkodesh, holy master. (...)
Zaddias was called Hagaon, illustris; and Aben Ezra was called Lapis auxilij,
the stone. Lastly, the proud titles which the School men take to themselves,
as Doctor irrefragabilis, Doctor seraphicus, Doctor fundatissimus, Doctor
illuminatus, Doctor solemnis, Doctor subtilis, Doctor angelicus, and Comestor,
quod edit scripturam; and Iacobus de Voragine, quod devoraverat scripturam.

Of the Pharisees brag. Luc. 18.
FIrst, the Pharisee fails in reckoning up his virtues, The negative part of
the Pharisees brag.
but makes no mention of his vices; for he says not, I am proud or a
contemner of God, or a contemner of others. Secondly, he says not through the
grace of God I am that I am, as Paul said; but he gloried as though he had
been made of better stuff then other men. Thirdly, he says, I am not an
oppressor or an adulterer; but he was one, for the greatest sort of robbery is
to rob God of his honor; therefore the Apostle says, That Christ thought it
not robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2.6. he says, he is not an
adulterer; he abstaineth perhaps from the fact, but the Pharisees understood
not; That to lust after a woman was a sin. Mat. 5. Paul himself before his
conversion knew not this. Romans 7. and then he adds, I am not like this
Publican. What see thou O Pharisee in this Publican? Who art thou that
judge another man's servant? See thou not this poor Publican knocking on
his breast, and casting down his eyes? Are there not twelve hours in the day?
and does not the Lord call some, at the eleventh hour, and some at the sun
setting? And the Hebrews say, Noli quemquam contemnere, nemo enim est cui non
est sua hora: Despise no man, for every man has his time of calling.

The affirmative part of the Pharisees brag.
But mark the affirmative part of this brag, I fast twice in the week, and I
give my tithes; what abstinence is this to abstain from meat, and not from
sin? the devils never eat, and yet their abstinence pleases not God.
Secondly, he says, I give tithes; he makes a gift of that which he was bound
to pay. Boasting whereto compared.
Basil has a good saying, Inanis gloria est tinea virtutum, vainglory is as
a moath which eats and consumes the virtue; and Gregory in his morals has
a good comparison against against this pride; he says, as Eleazer fighting
with the Elephant, killed the Elephant, and was killed by the Elephant himself
when the Elephant fell upon him; So when a man has killed many vices, and
becomes proud of that, they fall under pride, and so are killed by it. Is enim
sub host quem prosternit moritur, qui de culpa quam superat elevatur.



A man should be very sparing in doing of this, When a man reckons up his
good deeds, he must first give the glory to God.
for oftentimes it proceeds of the pride of his heart, and robs the Lord
of his glory; God is most liberal to man, and will trade with him and let him
have the gain, but God himself will have the praise; and he reserveth this as
the fat of the sacrifice for himself. Esaias. 42. My glory I will not give to
another. There is in the Sun light and brightness, the Sun communicates the
beams of his light to the creatures, but reserveth the light for himself; so
the Lord reserveth his glory for himself, but he communicates the beams
thereof to Angels and to men. If a rich man should bestow upon a poor man a
sum of money to build some Church with it, this poor man after the work is
ended, puts on his own name and arms upon the work; has not the rich man
just cause to find fault with the poor man for this. So it is when man takes
the honor to himself which is due to God, but when a man reckons up his
good deeds, not trusting or glorying in them, but giving all the glory to God,
then it is not a sin; and when he says, Dum coronat Deus opera mea, What
time chiefly men should glory of their good deeds.
non coronat nisi dona sua. And the children of God have used this rather at
their death and in the point of their dissolution, then in their life time;
Hezekiah said when he was to die; Remember me O Lord I beseech, how I have
walked before thee in truth, and in a perfect heart; and have done that which
was good in thy sight. Esaias. 38.3. And Paul said when he was to be offered up,
and the time of his departure was at hand; I have fought a good fight, I have
finished my course, I have kept the faith, and henceforth is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness. 2. Tim. 4.7. So Hilarion said when he was at the
point of death. O my soul go thy way, why art thou afraid? for thou have
served Christ thy Lord seventy years, why then should thou be afraid to go
to him? and it is more safe for a man to remember these good deeds at the
hour of his death than in his life time; for as Hezekiah in a boasting manner
did show his treasures to the King of Babel, he was spoiled and robbed of them.
2. King. 20.17. So many in their life time bragging of those things which they
have done, are oftentimes spoiled by Satan of the comfort and fruit of them.

The saints are very sparing to brag of themselves.
And ye shall see that the Saints of God have been very loath to speak that
which sounded to their own praise, as Paul says, Ye compelled me to brag.
1. Cor. 12. and when the children of God speak any thing which tends to
their own praise, either they speak it in the person of another, or they
extenuate it very much; we have an example of this in Paul. 1. They speak for
the most part in the person of another.
Cor. 12.2. I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, caught up to the
third heaven, of such a man I will glory, but of my self I will not glory.
First, mark when he comes to speak of himself, he speaks in the person
of another. Secondly, he concealed it for fourteen years. Hence we see it to
be true which Solomon says. Prove. 29.11. A fool utters all his mind, but
a wise man will keep it till afterward. John will not say that he himself
leaned in the bosom of Christ, but for modesty he says, There was leaning on
Jesus bosom one of his Disciples whom he loved. Ioh. 13.23. So they extenuate
that which seems to make for their own praise. When Abraham had invited the
Angels, although he had killed a calfe and prepared great fare for them, yet he
says, I will fetch a morsel of bread. Genesis 18.5. So when Luke speaks of the
feast which Matthew, called also Levi, made in his house to Christ, he says,
that Levi made a great feast to Christ. Luc. 5.27.28. but when himself
speaks of it. Mat. 9.10. he says only, that he came home and eat bread in
Levies house; to teach us, that another man's mouth should praise us, and not
our own. Prove. 27.2.

But Moses writes of himself, he was very meek above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth. Number. 12.3.

This verse seems to have been added by Joshua, Many places of anticipation
in the Scripture.
or by Esaras, rather than set down by Moses himself; for there are many
things insert by the men of God in Moses writings, which were not insert by
Moses himself. As Lachis which is called Dan. Genesis 14.14. although it got not
this name until Joshua divided the land amongst the tribes. Josh. 19.27. So
Number. 21.14, 15.27. these three verses which fell out in the days of Joshua are
set down in Moses history, albeit not by Moses himself.

So when Solomon gave to Hiram so many cities, Hiram called them in the
Phaenician tongue the land of Chabbul. 1. King. 9.13. this was the first
imposition of the name, and yet it is so called in the days of Joshua. Cap.
19.27. this Esdras did, or some other holy man; long after Joshua was dead. So
this verse might be inserted after Moses death: So the whole last chapter of
Deuteronomie was added after Moses death.

The conclusion of this is: Conclusion.
What have thou that thou have not received? and if thou have received, why
boastest thou as if thou hadest not received them. 1 Cor. 4.7.

EXERCITAT. VI. Of Hyperbolik speeches in excess or defect. Commandment. IX.
1. King. 20.10. Then Benhadad sent unto him and said, the gods do so to me
and more also; if the dust of Samaria shall be handfuls for all the people
that shall follow me.
What an hyperbole is.
HYperbolies are such kind of speeches, when the speech exceeds the thing it
self; Fabius says, conceditur enim amplius dicere qua^ in re est, quia dici
quantum est, non potest, meliusque ultra, quam citra stat ratio.

Hyperbolick speeches not to be admitted rashly in the Scriptures.
We are not rashly to admit these kind of speeches in the Scripture; for as
excess in manners is a fault, so excess in speech.

In what sense the Scriptures admit an hyperbole.
When the Scriptures make a comparison of things which have some resemblance,
the comparison is not made of things equal; but of things that have some
similitude. Examples of hyperbolick speeches in scripture in excess.
Example, Genesis 13.16. I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; this is
not an hyperbolick speech, but a comparison of two things; of that which more
easily can be numbered, with that which more hardly can be numbered: God says
not, that he will make his seed as many as the dust of the earth, or the
stars of heaven; but he says, That men shall be no more able to number
them, than they were able to number the dust of the earth or the stars of the
heaven; for he says, If a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy
seed be numbered. So Ier. 15.8. Their widows are increased to me above the
sand of the sea. In their sense and feeling they thought them more then the
sands of the seas.

Another example, I destroyed the Amorites before them, whose height was like
the heigh of the Cedars; and he was strong as the oaks. Amos. 2.9. the
comparison here is not made of things equal, but of things that have some
similitude, The Amorites were tall as the Cedars, and strong like the oaks;
yet there is no equality here. So Judge. 20.17. There were seven hundred
chosen men of Benjamin left handed, every one could sting stones at an hair
breadth and not miss. Here is a comparison betwixt two small things; with that
which the men of Benjamin did aim at, and a hair.

So Ioh. 21.25. says, There are also many other things which Jesus did, the
which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world it
self could not contain the books that should be written. The Evangelist here
compares the less with the more, the writing of Christ's works, with his many
works; so says Christ himself, If these should hold their peace, the stones
would immediately cry out. Luc. 19.40. This is not an hyperbolick speech, but
he compares here the less impossible with the more, to show the
impossibility that the Disciples should hold their peace; for rather than the
Disciples shall hold their peace, the very stones shall speak; as if one should
say, it were as impossible for the King of Spain to overcome the Turk; as for
an Elephant to go through the eye of a needle: so it is as impossible to write
all Christ's miracles, as it is for the world to contain them, if they were
written; and John adds, I suppose, to qualify and modifie this speech, that
it might not seem to be an hyperbolick speech.

There are speeches in defect which seem to be hyperbolick speeches, and yet
are not. Example, Examples of hyperbolick speeches in defect.
Psalm. 22.6. I am a worm and not a man, this is spoken of Christ, which being
taken as the word sounds, is false; but this is only a comparison betwixt
the worm, the vilest creeping thing, and Christ in the estimation of wicked
men; they thought him like a worm or less thin a worm.

When wicked men speak of themselves then it is an hyperbole.
When the Scripture brings in wicked men speaking of themselves, then we are
to grant hyperbolies. Deuteronomy 1.28. The cities are great, and walled up to the
heaven, God himself uttering the selfsame speech that the wicked do, it is
not an hyperbole.
this was an hyperbolick lie in the spies, and was uttered to discourage the
Jews from going to Canaan; but the selfsame speech uttered by God himself,
Deuteronomy. 9.1: is not an hyperbole, but a comparison betwixt the less and the
greater. So Number. 13.33. We were in our own sight as Grasshoppers, and so were
we in their sight; and so Genesis 11.3. Let us build a tower, whose top may reach
to heaven* and 1. King 20.10. The dust of Samaria shall not suffice for
handfuls to the people which follow me. All these were hyperbolick speeches,
because they were uttered by wicked men; but when David says, Psalm. 107.26.
that the waves of the sea mount up to heaven, it is not an hyperbolick speech,
but a comparison betwixt the less and the more, as those things which go very
high, seem to go to the heaven; so that the waves of the sea went very high.

The Scriptures bring not in apologues, but only set down the man that uses
them.
When the Scripture sets down apologues, it brings not in the apologue,
but says only that Iotham said; The trees of the field went out to choose a
King. Judge. 9.7. So the Scriptures show 2. King. 14. how Ehoash the King of
Israel sent to Amaziah King of Judah saying; The thistle that was in Lebanon,
sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, etc. the Scriptures bring not in the
apologue as Aesope does, because they have some show of untruth, but they tell
only what the men said who uttered them.

A man cannot exceed in expressing his sins.
A man speaking of his own sins, he cannot exceed in expressing them; when
Manasseth said, that his sins were more then the sand of the sea; this was
not an hyperbolick speech. So then Paul said, Of all sinners I am the chief,
1. Tim, 1.15. this is an exaggeration of their sins in their own sense and
feeling, they counted themselves the greatest sinners.

The conclusion of this is: Conclusion.
We must shun bragging and ostentative words, for then we may fall into
hyperbolicke speeches, which have some show of lies.

EXERCITAT. VII. Against railing and backbiting. Commandment IX.
1. Cor. 5.11. If any man that is called a brother, be a railer, with such one
eat not.

Psalm. 101.5. Who so privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off.


WE speak evil of our neighbor either in his presence or behind his back.
In his presence, When a man does backbite his neighbor.
this is called (...); behind his back, this is called (...): The Latins
call the first contumelia, (...).
and the second detractio; and this contumely in the presence of of one, is
either (...) or (...). (...).


(...) is a short quipe or taunt which we give to one, as Genesis 37.19. Behold
this dreamer comes. What (...) is properly.
So Micols mock to David, 2. Sam. 6.20. and such the mock of Tobiah the
Ammonite to the Jews, Nehem. 4.3.

What (...).
(...), is when one raileth in a man's face with many and bitter speches, such
was the railing of Rabsache against the Jews, 2. King. 9.14. and the railing
of Shimei against David, 2. Sam. 16.7. and the railing of the heathen against
the Christians, calling them murderers, incestuous, enemies to the state,
worshipers of an ass, (...), eaters of men, worshippers of Bacchus, and Ceres,
because they used bread and wine in the Sacrament; Thyestes fratri epulandes
filios proposuit.
and as Turtullian says of them, Oedipodios incestus and Thyeslinas canas
nobis obijciebant.

When a man raileth in his neighbors face, it is either Contumelia, A
difference betwixt contumelia and convitium.
or Convitium: Contumelia, is properly when they object a sin to him, as
adultery, theft: Convitium is, when they object to him any infirmity of his
body, as blindness, deafness, and such. When Shimei called David a bloody
man, and a man of Belial, this was a contumely, 2. Sam. 16.7. and when the
children said to Elisha, Come up thou bald pate go up thou bald head, this was
convitium. What remedies we should use against railing
2. King. 2.23.

Remedies against this railing are; first, to rejoice, Matt. 5.11. When men
revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you for
my sake, rejoice and be exceeding glad.

Secondly, To bless, Matt. 5. Bless them that curse you.

Thirdly, to hold our peace, and not to answer again, but to spread our
injuries before the Lord, as Hezekiah did when Rabsache railed against him. 2.
King. 19.14. and David, when his enemies spoke mischievous things of him, he
says, I, as a deaf man heard not, and I was as a dumb man that opened not
his mouth; Psalm. 38.15.

Lastly, to answer modestly, as Hanna did to Eli; I am not drunk but a woman
of a sorrowful spirit: So that of Paul to Festus, I am not mad, most noble
Festus, but speak^ the words of truth and sobriety, Act. 26.25. A soft answer
pacifieth wrath: Prove. 15.1. And a soft tongue breaks the bone, Prove. 15.15.
We see how Gedion pacified the wrath of the Ephramites, with a calm and soft
answer, Judge. 8.2. They were angry when he went up against the Madianites, but
this soft answer pacified their wrath: Better is the gleanings of Ephraim than
the vintage of Abiezer, your gleanings in killing of the two kings Oreb and Zeb
are more worth then our vintage in killing so many of the Madianites.

Prove. 26.4.5. Answer not a fool according to his folly, When a fool is to be
answered and when not
lest thou be also like unto him. Answer a fool according to his folly lest
he be wise in his own conceit: here Solomon shows us, when we should
answer to these railing speeches, and when not; when it tends not to the good
of the railer, nor to the profit of the innocent who is reproached, then it is
good to hold his peace. So Hezekiah held his peace, when Rabsache railed, 2.
King. 19. So Jesus Christ held his peace when Pilate accused him, Ioh. 19 9.
But when the answer is profitable to the railer or fool, then we are to answer
him; therefore he says, Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise
in his own conceit: if the truth be impared by our silence, or the enemy be
imboldened to insult the more, then we are bound to answer. Christ when he was
beaten said, Why smitest thou me? Ioh. 18.23. and so did Paul, Act. 23.3. Et
haec est pars tutelae.

Let such railers as these remember, that With such measure as they meet, it
shall be measured to them again, Matt. 7.2. if they speak evil of others,
others will speak evil of them again* if thou say to one, Talmud.
Toll festucam e medio dentium tuorum, thou shall hear it said to the again,
Toll trabem ex oculis tuis. And if thou say to thy neighbor, argentum tuum
factum est scoria; thou shall hear again that which thou would not hear,
Vinum tuum mixtum est aquis, Esaias. 1.22. and he who strikes with the sword
shall die by the sword, so he that strikes with the tongue shall be scourged
with the tongue. A man calumniates his neighbor absent either secretly or
openly.


We speak evil of our neighbor behind his back, either secretly or openly:
he that speaks secretly is called (...), (...).
a whisperer; and the open speaker is called (...): the open backbiter studieth
most to hinder friendship, or to dissolve it, therefore he is called
incendiarius or ardelio, and he puffs at his enemies, Psalm. 10.5. as if he
should blow a coal of fire amongst them, even as Absolon set Ioabs barlie
field on fire. 2. Sam. 14.30. Iterare verbum quid.
Prove. 17.9. Qui iterat verbum disjungit principem; that is, he who carries
tales to and fro, separateth the prince from them that love him; (...)
and these are called Rokelim, Levit. 19.16. Thou shall not go about with
tales to vent them, as the peddler goes about with his wares to sell; David
says, Adders poison is under their lips, Psalm 140.5. The venom of the
spitting is under their tongues; as the serpent spitteth the venom a far
off, so do they their malice behind ones back.

These back biters and traducers of other men's good name in the chaldie tongue
are said, Loqui lingua tertia, Loqui lingua tertia quid apud Hebraeos.
Ecclus, 28.16. Lingua tertia commovit multos: the back-biter is said, loqui
lingua tertia; because like a serpent he stingeth three at once; as the serpent
carries three stings, in her tongue, so he kills three at once, first,
himself; secondly, him to whom he makes the evil report; and thirdly, him of
whom he makes the evil report. As Doeg killed himself, the Priests, and
Saul, (...) duo and (...) os.
and the backbiter is called dophi, Psalm. 50.20. which the Rabbis interpret
do, duo, and pi, os, because he speaks with a double tongue, Prove. 28.6. he
is called perversus duarum viarum, such as those set their mouth against the
heavens; And their tongue walks through the earth. Psalm. 73.9. that is, they
spare no man, but speak evil of him.

How backbiters are to be cured.
The only cure contrary to this, is, to delate and give up such scandalous
persons, this is no backbiting, 1. Cor. 1.11. For it had been declared of you
my brethren, of them who are of the house of Cloe, that there are contentions
amongst you. So Genesis 37.2. And Joseph brought unto his father the evil report
of his brethren. But here we must make a difference betwixt those two phrases
Iabhe dibbath, and motzi dibbath: (...) Detulit rumorem. (...) Protulit rumorem*
Detulit rumorem, and protulit rumorem: Detulit rumorem, he only relates
that which he knows or hears, but Protulit rumorem, who brings it out of
his own corrupt heart, Prove. 10.18. He that brings forth a slander is a
fool.

How shall men behave themselves,

If a bad man report evil of a good man, When to give credit to evil reports.
we should not believe it. If a good man report evil of a bad man we are to
believe it: if a good man report evil of a good man, then we are to suspend
our judgment: but if an evil man speak evil of a bad man, then we are to
suspect it.

The remedies against those detractions are; first, Remedies against
detractions.
to make good use of those backbitings, and to remember, that they are but like
the horse leaches which are ordained, to suck out the bad blood out of a man,
but not the good; study thou to make good use of their backbiting. The first
age contented themselves only, to defend themselves from wild beasts, but the
ensuing age went further, even to make benefit of their flesh and skin. So when
we are railed upon by our enemies, we should make our benefit of their
railings, and as men when they are besieged of their enemies, they are the more
circumspect: so should the children of God be more circumspect when the enemies
are about to mark their haltings, and thus the children of God shall make use
as well of their foes as of their friends.

The second remedy against these backbitings, and railing, is to look up to
the Lord, as David did when Shimei railed against him, 2. Sam. 16.10. the Lord
has said unto him, curse David. When the Israelites were stung with the fiery
serpents in the wilderness, they looked up to the brazen serpent, and then
they were healed: When the children of God find themselves stung with the
fiery tongues of the wicked, then let them look up to Jesus Christ, who was
exalted upon the cross, and that shall cure them.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: All our members should be the weapons of
righteousness, Romans 6.13. therefore our tongues are not our own; neither must
we use them to the hurt of our neighbor.

EXERCITAT. VIII. Against mocking. Commandment. IX.
Prove. 17.5. He that mocketh the poor reproves his maker.
(...), Permutantes nomina.
THe changing of a man's name, is a special sort of mocking, and bearing false
testimony. Thus Esau called Jacob, jagnakobh, as though he had been the
supplanter of him, (...)
Gen 27.36. So when the law was translated into greek by the Seventy, the
Jews changed their names, and called them hakkore lemiphrangh, legentes a
sinistra; and hakkore hagiphthit, legentes Aegyptiace: so the Arrians changed
the name of Athanasius, and called him Sathanasius. So the Greek Church mocked
the Latin Church and called them Azymitas; and the Latins mocked the Greek
Church, and called them, farme^^arios. So the heathen mocked the Jews calling
them Verpi, Recutiti, apellae, and Sabbatarij.

It is lawful to play upon the names of profane and wicked men. (...)
So Abigail played upon the name of Nabal, For as his name is, so he is; Nabal
is his name, and folly is with him. 1. Sam. 25.25.

Another example, the mount of Olives is called, mons hammishah, the hill of
olives, (...) a (...) unxit (...) a (...) corrupit. (...) a (...) The father of
the Kenites of whom he descended, 1. Chr. 4.19. or from (...) Somniare. (...)
Aethiops. (...) Pater Saulis. (...) stercus.
but the holy Ghost plays upon the name, and calls it mons corruptionis,
the hill of corruption, in detestation of the Idolatry which was set up there,
2. King. 23.13.

A third example, Ier. 29.24. the holy Ghost gives a sharp quip to Shemaia
the Nehelamite alluding to his fathers name, and to his false deluding with his
dreams. And we see an excellent quip, Psalm. 7.1. When David called Saul, the
son of Cush the Benjamite, for Kish the Benjamite, because Saul was like the
moore that could not change his color. So the Jews in the time of Hadrian the
Emperor called an imposter, before he had deceived them, bar Hhokebhah, silius
stellae; but after that he had deceived them, they called him bar hhosebhah,
filius mendacij. So they played upon the name Iezabel, Zebhel, stercus est. So
the Church played upon the name Epiphanes, and called him Epimanes, or mad man.
So Sardanapalus, because he was effeminate they played upon his name, (...),
est id quo Viri sumus.
and called him Sardan (...). So Tiberius Claudius Nero, they called him
Biberius Caldius Mero, because he delighed to drink strong wine and hot
waters.

Mocks, are divided according to the object; first, to mock man is a great sin;
secondly, to mock their parents a greater sin; but thirdly, to mock God is
the greatest sin of all.

Names are given to men according to the object, first in any quality of the
body.
First, to mock a man for any infirmity in his body, that is a sin: so they
mocked Elias, and said, Come up thou bald pate; but to give names from the
quality of the person are not nicknames or mockes; so he was called gnesabh,
Genesis 22.22. because he came forth perfect like a man with hair upon him, and
shegnir, hirsutus, and Edom, because he loved red pottage.

(...), distintionis causa.
To give a man a name from some part of his body, or some accident of his body,
for distinctions sake, is not mocking: as Pharaoh Neco, Ier. 26. as ye would
say, Pharaoh with the goutish feet; he was so called to put a distinction
betwixt him and others, who were called Pharaoh: and to distinguish him from
Abraham's Pharaoh, called Teutis; from Joseph's Pharaoh, called Rean; and Moses
Pharaoh, called Talma, and from Pharaoh Hophra, Ier. 44.

Secondly for any defect of the body.
So to give a name from some part of his body for distinctions sake, is not
mockery. Thus Judas is called Thaddeus, as ye would say, the man with the
dugges: So Lebbeus, Corculum, or little heart. So Simon is called Niger, for
distinction sake, Act, 13.1. So James the less, Marc. 15.40. So Darius is
called (...), with the long hand. So Anastasius the Emperor is called (...), a
duplici pupillo oculi: So Edward longshanks.

Thirdly for his estate.
Thirdly, it is not lawful to mock a man for his estate or condition; For he
that mocketh the poor, reproves his maker. Prove. 17.5.

Fourthly for his country.
Fourthly, we should not mock a man for his country; Can any good thing come
out of Nazaret. Ioh. 1.46. So Julian in contempt called Christ a Galilaean.
Ezekiel. 36.15. Thou shall not bear the reproach of the people any more; they
objected to the Jews sterilitie and famine, because if was usual amongst
them, as in the time of Abraham, Jacob, Elimelech, and in the time of Ioram;
when the woman fled to the Philistims for famine. 2. King. 8.

Fifthly, to mock a man for his religion. Psalm. 137. Fifthly for his religion.
Let us hear your Hebrew songs. So 1 Chronicles. 30. they mocked those who kept the
Passover. So when Christ was praying upon the cross; they mocked him and
said, he calls upon Elias. Mat. 27. Such was Ismaels mocking of Isaac. Genesis
21.9. (...)
Metzahhek exposing him to be mocked, not only mocking him himself, but
making others to mock him also; which the Apostle calls persecution. Galat.
4.29. such were the mockers of David. Psalm. 69.12. They that sat in the gate
spoke against me; and I was the song of the drunkards. So when they mocked the
very gifts of the Holy Ghost, as when the Disciples spoke with strange tongues,
they said, They were drunk with new wine. Act. 2.

It is lawful to jest at idolaters and their idolatry, It is lawful to jest
at idolaters,
as Elias jested at the Priests of Baal; the heathen called their god Baal
ragnas, or Baal (...), the God of thunder, but God in dirision calls him
Baal-Peor, or Baal-(...); the Ekronits called Baal-zebub, the God of flies,
(there were no flies seen in the temple of Jerusalem) but God in dirision
calls him Baal-zebub, (...), the God of dung.

Some of the heathen have mocked their Idols, The idolaters jest at their own
Gods.
knowing them to be no gods; Dionysius coming home one one night very cold;
and having nothing wherewith to warm him, he pulled down Hercules Image, and
threw it into the fire and said, This shall be thy thirteenth labor O
Hercules. A Protestant coming into a Popish Church, the Papists did show to
him the image of Christ, and Franciscus upon the one hand, and Dominicus upon
the other: he said, that he knew well that that was the Image of Christ, but
he knew never that those were the two thieves which were crucified with him,
the one at his right hand, and the other at his left: So Erasmus may jest at
the long ears of the Popish saints, although Bellarmine snuff at it.

It is lawful to reply sometimes by way of jest to a profane and bitter fool;
Answer a fool according to his foolishness. Prove. 26.5. When Julian the
Apostate asked, what was the Carpenters son doing, (meaning Christ whom he
called a Carpenters son) the Christians replied, he is making a coffin for
thee; and so it fell out soon afterward, that he was killed in the wars.
Basil says to a profane fellow cook to Valens the Emperor, Basil. tripart.
hist. lib. 6. cap. 6.
when he was prattling of religion; Tuum est de pulpamentis cogitare, sed non
divina dogmata decoquere.

Secondly, to mock the parents is a great sin. Prove. 30:17. The eye that
mocketh at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the Ravens of the
valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it. So Ham mocked his
father Noah. Genesis 9.22.

Thirdly, to mock the Lord is is the greatest sin of all; then they set
their mouth against the heavens. Psalm. 73.9. Thou art a Samaritan and have a
devil. So to mock him in his judgments. Esaias. 28.22. Now therefore be ye not
mockers, lest your bonds be made strong. So Luc. 16.14. and the Pharisees also
who were covetous heard all things, and they derided him. So to mock him in
his fatherly correction; He that mocketh the poor reproves his maker. Prove.
17.5.

Diverse sorts of unlaw-jests. (...) insulsum.
There are sundry sorts of jests which are unlawful; first, jests that have no
profit, such are called Taphel, unsavory. Collos. 4.6. Let your speeches be
poudered with salt. Job. 15.2. Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and
fill his belly with the east wind; the belly here is put for the stomach, and
the stomach is put for the heart; for even as the stomach digesteth meats, so
does the heart things transmitted to it from the sense and fantasy, and by
the wind here, is understood that which is unprofitable or good for nothing.
Hos. 8.7. Ier. 5.17. When a man's heart is filled with this wind, then his jests
are unsavory. The spouses lips are like Lilies dropping down sweet smelling
myrrh. Cant. 5.13.

The second sort of unlawful jests is in mirrhe, and it is called unchaste
mirth, (...); such mirth as is betwixt the whore and the harlot: the Holy Ghost
when he speaks of any unclean thing, either natural or moral, he
expresses it in clean and comely terms; and as we put honor upon the
members of dishonor. So does the holy ghost cover these unclean things with
comely terms, the Jews say Perashtiu cehogen, (...) See Romans 7.
explicavi illud sicut decet; and the Greeks call this (...).

The third sort of jests are biting and virolent jests, as when they mocked
Christ, they said, he calls upon Elias when he said, Eli, Eli, my God my
God. Mat. 27. So that virolent mock of the boys to Elisha, 2 King. 2. Ascend
ye bald-pate, that is, as the whirle-winde took away your master Elias, so it
may make you mount up, and take you away that ye be never seen again. The
trees which grows in new Jerusalem, Revelat. 22.2. bring forth fruit monthly,
and their leaves serve to heal the sores of men: The tongues of the children
of God should be like the tree of life, to heal the sores of men, and not to
gall and wound them: Thou that woundest them with the bitter scoffs and mockes
will never be able to edify them; can a fountain bring forth sweet water and
sour?

The highest degree of this mockery is, when they make a proverb of the
children of God; as Psalm. 69.11. To take up a parable sometimes taken in a good
sense and sometimes in a bad for mocking.
I became a proverb to them. So Ezekiel. 15.44. Behold every one that uses
proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying, as is the mother so is
the daughter. Sometimes again this phrase is taken in a good part. Number. 21.27.
Wherefore they that speak in proverb say, Come unto Heshbou, let the city of
Sihon be built and prepared. So it is taken for the greatest punishment, Deuteronomy.
28.37. And thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb and a byword among
all the nations whither the Lord thy God shall lead thee.

Mockers in gesture are here condemned.
So mocks in gesture are here condemned, as Lagnag, subsannare, the mock which
is made both with the mouth, and with the nose; which the Apostle calls
(...), to fliere with the nose. Gal. 6.7. So the nodding of the head, Psalm.
22.7. They shake the head. Mark a difference betwixt these phrases, Movere
caput, and movere tibi caput ut differunt.
movere caput, and movere tibi caput: movere caput est deridentis; movere tibi
caput cum habet dativum rei vel personae expressum, significat condolere: (...)
Quis movebit tibi caput? (...) Deridendentis sunt.
as Nahum. 3.7. Quis movebit tibi, scil. caput. Who will bemoane thee, because
when we have pity upon one, we move the head. Sometimes to move the head is a
sign of astonishment: Ier. 18 16. Every one that passes thereby shall be
astonished, and wagge his head. So to shut out the tongue: Esaias. 57.4. Against
whom do do ye sport your selves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw
out the tongue? So to shut out the lip: Psalm. 22.7. They shoot out the
lip. So Prove. 16.30. Moving his lips, he brings evil things to pass. So
the putting out of the finger; Esaias. 58.9. If thou take away from the midst of
thee, the yoke and putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity; They
shoot out their middle finger, the rest of their fingers being folded; and
therefore it is called digitus infamis.

So to make a man Letopheth, that is, to hour him out with drums and
tabrets; the Greeks called (...), cum manuum plausu risus excitatur, when they
laugh clapping their hands. Lament. 2.15. All that pass by clap their hands.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: Psalm. 1.1. Blessed is the man that walks not in
the council of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners; nor sits in
the seat of the scornful. It is a great sin to walk in the council of the
ungodly, a greater sin to stand in the way of sinners, but the greatest sin
of all is, to sit in the seat of the scornful: to sit here, is deliberately
and advisedly to sit as Judge, and to mock.

EXERCITAT. IX. Against Flattery. Commandment. IX.
1. These. 2.5. For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know.
THe sin of flattery is a bearing of false witness against our neighbor,
smoothing him up, Flaterie is a bearing of false witness against our neighbor.
and making him believe that he has such things in him which are not in him.
1. Tim. 3.8. The Apostle calls these bili^gues, when they speak one thing
and think another; and the Hebrews say that cor and lingua sunt duae lances
unius staterae, the tongue is as it were another heart; and therefore he that
speaks that which he thinks not, he speaks with a heart, and a heart;
of all sorts of monsters; these are the greatest. There have been men found
who have had two heads, but never one found having two hearts. He that rebukes
a man, afterward shall find more favor, than he that flattereth with the
tongue. Prove. 28.23. Targum paraphraseth it, praedividento linguam suam.
Solomon compares the fair speeches of a flatterer to a potshard of clay laid
ov^r with silver. Prove. 26.23. Clay and silver are not suitable; so neither are
fair words and evil deeds.

Two sorts of flatterers.
There are two sorts of flatterers; first, the baser flatterer, and then the
cunning flatterer; the base flatterer is he who flattereth only for his
belly. Psalm. 35.16. Sanniones placentae, hypocritical mockers in the feasts;
for as R. Solomon witnesses, they who delighted in flattery, used to give
their flatterers caikes baked with honey to make them the more to flatter them,
and to make them speak evil of others; therefore Gnug which signifies a
Pastie, it signifies likewise a flatterer and a backbiter: (...) sanniones
placentae vel cibi.
hence Daniel uses this phrase, comedere accusationes. Dan. 3.8. because when
their masters threw a pastie to them, (...)
then they traduced others; and therefore the devil in the Syriack tongue is
called Akal kartza comedens accusationes. Mat. 4. and the Greeks called these
(...), Those flatter the poor for bread. Job. 22.

Flatterers are either gross or cunning.
Those flatterers again are either gross and palpable flatterers or more
smooth and cunning.

The gross flatterer, such were the flatterers of Herod, who cried, Act. 12.
The voice of God and not of man; such were these, Esaias. 32. who called
darkness light, and light darkness; such were the flatterers of Dionysius,
when he did spit, they licked up his spittle and said, it was sweeter than
Nectar and Ambrosia.

There are other sort of flatterers who are more cunning, David compares the
words of such flatterers to butter and oil, Psalm. 55.21. When the Jews
invited any to a feast, they did two things to them; first, they powered
ointment upon their heads, and then kissed them; ye see that Mary Magdalen
powered ointment upon Christ and kissed his feet. Luc. 7.38.

Those cunning flatterers are of two sorts; first, (...), and secondly, (...);
Romans 16.18.

Cunning flatterers of two sorts.
(...), are those who promised great things, but perform nothing indeed; such
was the offer of the devil to Christ, if he would fall down and worship him
he would give him all the world: And such was the flattery of Rabsache to the
Jews, if they would yield to Senacherib, they should have such and such
commodities.

(...), are these who give fair speeches, but their chief end is only to
deceive: such was the flattery which the Pythonie used to Paul and Barnaboas,
Those are the servants of the living God. Act. 16.17.

This flattery is hardly discerned from friendship; Flattery heardly known
from true friendship.
as hypocrisy is hardly discerned from religion; and as hypocrisy is the ape
of wisdom, so is flattery the ape of friendship; and as some grains grow up
with the wheat, and are hardly separated from the wheat, being of the same
bigness and quantity with the wheat, they are hardly separated from it; so a
flatterer is hardly discerned from a true friend.

A flatterer differs from a true friend; first, The difference betwixt a
flatterer and a friend.
the flatterer Jude. verse. 16.2. Pet. 2.3. but a true friend seeks not theirs
but them; the flatterer through covetousness with fained words makes
merchandise of men, but a true friend never sells his friend.

A true friend neither follows men in all, nor prayseth Joseph learned to
swear by the life of Pharaoh; but the flatterer because he cannot follow the
virtues of those whom he flattereth, he studieth to follow them in their vices;
these are fitly compared to bad painters when they go about to paint a
beautiful face in which there is some blemish, they can cunningly express the
blemish, but they cannot paint the beautiful face.





The cunning flatterer differs much from the gross flatterer.
The cunning flatterer differs much from the gross flatterer; the cunning
flatterer marketh the predominant sin of him whom he flattereth; but the base
flatterer flattereth him in every thing. Secondly, the cunning flatterer
differs much from the gross flatterer; the cunning flatterer is like the
subtle idolater, the subtle idolater changes the names of things; so does
the subtle flatterer; he calls his Idol his Image, so does the subtle
flatterer, if the man be prodigal whom he flattereth, he calls him
liberal; and if he be covetous, he calls him a good husband. The subtle
flatterer has Esau's hands and his voice, but the base flatterer has only
his hands but not his voice.

Remedies against flattery.
Now to free us from this vile flattery, it is fit that we praise men rather
when they are dead, than when they are alive. Eccles. 4.2. Wherefore I praise
the dead which are already dead, more then the living which are yet alive. So
David praised Saul and Jonathan after they were dead. So the widows show the
coats and garments which Doreas made while she was with them, Act. 9.39.
Secondly, rather to praise them behind their backs, then in their faces, so
the Jews commended the Centurion to Christ behind his back, Luc. 7.4.

Of all sorts of flatterers the preacher is most dangerous when he flattereth
and humoureth the people in their sins, Malac. 2.9. suscepistis personas in
lege, Suscipere personas in lege quid. Of all flatterers a flattering preacher
is worst
that is, for gain and for fear ye spared the rich and great men, and then
ye caused men to stumble at the law, and ye corrupted the covenant of Levi;
this sin Ezekiel called dawbing with untempered mortar, Ezekiel. 13.15. and
Gregory expresses the comparison this ways, when a dawber or plasterer comes
to an old ruinous house, he makes the indwellers believe that it is sound
work, and that they may dwell safely in it: so those dawbers promise salvation
and security to the wicked, and then destruction and ruin comes suddenly upon
them; the Apostle calls this (...), to mix water and wine together, as the
Vintner for gain mixed water and wine; so the false teachers take the
acrimonie from the word, when they reprove not because of gain. So Esaias 1. the
city is become a harlot, as the harlot for delight abuses her body, but not to
beget children; so the avaratious pastors delight not to beget children to the
Lord, but they do all for gain, that they may make themselves great men. So
Ezekiel. 13.18. Woe be to the women that sow pillowes to all arme-holes, and make
kerchiefes upon the head of every stature to hunt souls: Will ye hunt the
souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you? the
women who gave themselves out for Prophetesses did use to hang Phylacteries and
(...), about the necks of the people, persuading them, that would save them
from all inconveniences, and they said, that then they might sleep securely,
as if a pillow were under their head, then they did hunt and catch the simple
souls, and made a prey of them, and so they polluted the name of the Lord for
a bandfull of barley, and pieces of bread, Nam Orgyorum merces crat fragmen
panis hordeacei: they would sell the people for the basest things, which the
very priests of Bacchus were content with.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is; Prove. 27.21. As the fyning pot for silver, and the
furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise: that is, as the fyning pot takes
away the dross from the silver, and the furnace purifieth the gold; so a wise
man takes away the dross of flattery from his speeches, and purges them from
all corruption: then they are like a Vessel for the fyner, Prove. 25.4.

EXERCITAT. X. Of Rebukes. Commandment. IX.
Levit. 19.17. Thou shall rebuke thy brother, and not suffer sin to lie upon
him.
The affirmative part of this Commandment.
AS the Commandment forbids us to hurt our neighbor with our tongues: so it
commands us to rebuke him, and not to suffer sin to lie upon him.

In rebukes consider these things: first, who must rebuke: secondly, what
sins are to be rebuked publikly: thirdly, who are to rebuke: fourthly, the
manner of rebuke: fifthly, the time; and lastly, the end and success.

First, who must rebuke; To rebuke belongs to every Christian.
it is a duty which is laid upon every Christian; Increpando increpabis eum,
Levit. 19.17. Admonish one another, 1 Thessalonians. 3.15. If our enemies beast go
astray, we are bound to bring it home again, Exodus 22. much more our
neighbor.

This duty especially concerns preachers, To rebuke belongs especially to
preachers.
it is a part of their ministry to rebuke and comfort: and amongst Christ's
Disciples, there was one who was the son of thunder, Mark. 3. And look
through all the old Testament, (...) Liber obiurgationum. (...) Sectio
obiurgationum.
and ye shall see that the most of their prophesies were rebukes, and
threatenings: and the Jews called Deuteronomie [Sepher tocahhoth] the book of
objurgations, and that section which begins, Deuteronomy. 28.14. they call it
[Parashath tocahhoth] Sectio objurgationum.

The necessity of this duty is such, that he will require the blood of the
people at the hands of their Pastor if he reprove not: The Lord is vindex
sanguinis, and he will require the blood of their souls especially from them.
The shepherd was bound to make good that which was stolen, as Jacob did to
Laban, Genesis 31.39. So is the Preacher if it perish through his default; it is a
necessary duty then of the Pastor to reprove, that he may reclame his people
from sin, and save them.

The Preacher when he reproves a sin in others, he must take heed he be
free from that sin himself, Math. 7.5. Take out the beam out of thine own
eye, before thou take out the mote out of thy neighbors eye. Romans 2.21. Thou
therefore that teach another, A preacher must labor to be free of that
sin which he reproves in others.
teach not thou thy self? A preacher when he reproves sin in others, he
cannot be without sin altogether, as was the angel who did fly in the midst
of the heaven, when he reproved Babylon, Revelat. 14.17. neither can be stand
in the Sun as the angel did when he denounced judgment against the Princes
of the earth, yet he must strive to be free of those gross sins which he
reproves in others.

Secondly, what sins especially are to be reproved?

There are sundry sorts of sin, Vitium saeculi, vitium gentis, vitium
personae.

What sins a preacher must reprove.
That which is vitium saeculi, the preacher may deplore it rather then reprove
it, Polygamie was a sin which was generally practiced through the world, and
yet the Prophets spoke little thing against it.

Secondly, Vitium gentis, when a nation is general^y given to such a sin, as
Egypt is called Rahab, pride, Psalm. 87.4. So an Arabian is called a thief,
Ierem. 2. a Canaanite a consener, Ezekiel. 17.4 Zach. 14.21. sorcery and
witchcraft was the sin of the Chaldeans, Esaias. 2. Thou art full of the
manners of the cast; that is, of the sorceries of the Chaldeans.

How a preacher is to rebuke a nation.
When a Preacher reproves the sin of a nation, first he may reprove them
from the contrary: Righteousness exalts a people, but sin is the reproach
of a nation, Prove. 14.34. See how famous nations are made by the Gospel,
Capernaum was lift up to the heavens by the preaching of the Gospel, but sin
did cast them down to hell, Matt. 11.23. Esaias. 19.18. In that day shall five
cities speak the language of Canaan, and one of them shall be called the city
of the Sun: What is that to speak the language of Canaan? that is, sincerely
they shall worship the Lord, and one of them shall be the city of the S^nne;
that is, Alexandria, it was famous because the Sun of righteousness did
shine upon it; so people when they want the Gospel, they sit but in the shadow
of death, Esaias 9.1.

Secondly, he may reprove the national faults comparing them with other
countries, Has any nation changed their gods, yet ye have changed me. Ier.
2.11. Ezekiel. 57.

But what if a Preacher cannot point particularly at the sin of the land,

Then he may say after this manner, lion, the second by a bear, and the third
by a goat buck, and the last by a terrible and fearful beast that had no
name: so I cannot in particular describe the sin of this nation for the sins
of it make up such a monster, that it has no name.

Thirdly, there is Vitium personae, the personal sins of men, and here
regard is had to the persons who are to be reproved, Jude. verse. 22. calls
this putting of difference, there is some stiffer grain, and some weaker
grain, and therefore the husband man for the one, has the wheel, and forth
other he has the staff, to beat out the fitches: Esaias. 28.27. so the
preachers should have sundry sorts of reproves for sundry sorts of sinners.

Sinners are either infirm or weak sinners, Diverse sorts of sinners are to
be reproved diversely. How weak sinners are to be reproved.
crafty obstinate sinners, or malicious sinners.

The first sort of sinners who are to be reproved are weak and infirm sinners
the Apostle wills us when we deal with such, To restore them with
mildness. Galat. 6. (...), is a speech taken from bone setters, who set the
bones after dislocation very warily; when a man takes a mote out of a man's
eye, he takes it out very warily, lest he put out the eye also, and when we
pull down old houses which join with Churches, we pull them down warily,
lest we pull down some of Gods house with them: so take heed that thou pull
not out some grace of God with the sin in the child of God, preserve Gods
work, and destroy the devils, and before that thou reprove such a one, it is
necessary that thou insinuate thy self, that thou do love him, and commend
him in something, before thou reprove him and as the smith heateth the iron
first, and then beats it: so after thou have softened thy infirm brother,
thou may the more freely rebuke him. And as a good physician had rather cure
his patient with good diet and sleep, then with cutting and fearing; so
should thou with gentle admonitions cure thy weak and infirm brother.

How crafty sinners are are to be reproved. (...)
The second sort of sinners who are to be reproved, are crafty sinners, Prove.
14.9. Fools make a mock of sins, [Evilim jalitz asham;] stultorum quisque
deridet reatum: that is, with fair speches they cover their sin, but here
the Preacher should follow the example of the Lord, Who is froward with the
froward, Psalm. 18.22. So should he be crafty with the crafty, and discover
these fig leaves, wherewith he goes about to hide his sin; (...)
Permutare nomen.
we have an example of this 1. Cor. 5.6. Paul by a figure transferred the
faults of other men upon himself and Apollo, and would not expressly nominate
them, that they might the more easily take up their own faults, for we
discern other men's faults better then our own, and then, per reflexam
cognitionem, we look back to our own sins.

How obstinate sinners are to be reproved.
The third sort of sinners are the obstinate sinners: In reproving such to move
them to repentance, it is fit to bring a long induction of the judgments of
God which lighted upon other sinners round about them, for as an arrow the
farther it be drawn the deeper it pierces; so the farther that the threatening
be enlarged the more it wounds; we have a notable exanple of this Amos, 1.
before the Lord would threaten Israel, For three transgressions and for four;
first he threatened Damascus upon the north, verse. 3. secondly, he threatened
Gaza upon the South, verse. 6. thirdly, he threatened Tyrus upon the north-west,
verse. 9. fourthly, he threatened Edome upon the south, verse. 11. fifthly, he
threatened Ammon upon the east, verse. 13. sixthly, he threatened Moab upon the
south-east: seventhly, he threatened Judah. cap. 2.4. and came nearer to them;
and last of all he threatened Israel, so that by fetching a compass about
them, they might the more easily be brought to confess their sin.

Secondly, The sins of obstinate sinners in reproof are to be exaggerated
from the least to the greatest.
it is fit to exaggerate the sin of obstinate sinners, to go from their
least sins to their greatest, as Amos does to Israel; For three
transgressions, the Lord would have pardoned these nations whom he threatened,
but when it comes to the fourth then he will not spare them.

First he begins with Damascus, verse. 3. What was Damascus fourth sin.
they had many sins, but their fourth and great sin was this, that they
threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron, here they break the law of
nations; when they had taken Gilead captive, to thresh them with instruments of
iron, even as the husband man thresheth his corn, their punishment is set
down, verse. 4, 5. answerable to their sin.

Secondly, he comes to Gaza; What was Gaza's fourth sin.
the sin of Gaza was greater then the sin of Damascus their fourth sin was
this, they carried away the whole captivity to deliver them to Edome: they were
not content to destroy the cities of Judah and Israel, but as many of the
Israelites as they took captive they sold them to the Idumeans who were a
fierce nation, their punishment is set down verse. 7.8.

Thirdly, he comes to Tyrus, What was Tyrus fourth sin.
their sin was greater then the sin of Gaza, their fourth sin was this,
they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the
brotherly covenant: Solomon and Hiram made a covenant together which they
brake, there was no covenant betwixt Gaza, and the Israelites, and therefore
the sin of Tyrus was greater then the sin of Gaza: they also sold the
children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the Grecians, Joel. 3.6.
their punishment is set down, verse. 10. answerable to their sin.

What was Edom; fourth sin.
Fourthly, he comes to Edom; their sin was greater then the sin of Tyrus:
his fourth sin was this, he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did
cast off all pity, and his anger did last perpetually, and kept his wrath for
ever: this sin of Edom was greater then Tyrus sin, there was but only a
covenant of friendship betwixt Tyrus and Judah, but Edom was his natural
brother, (for he was Jacobs brother) and for him to cast off the bowels of
compassion, and to corrupt his affections was a most unnatural sin: and
moreover to keep perpetual hatred, what a detestable sin was this: his
punishment is set down, verse. 12. answerable to his sin.

What was Ammons fourth sin.
Fifthly, he comes to Ammon, their sin was greater then the sin of Edom, their
fourth sin was this, they ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they
might enlarge their borders; their hatred was against Gilead, not for any wrong
which Gilead had done to them, but only for to satisfy their covetous heart,
if they would not have spared the men, yet they should have spared the women,
and if they would not spare the women they should have spared the young
infants; the Lord forbideth to kill the dam sitting upon the young ones, how
much more will he have the children spared who are in the mothers belly: so
that this sin was greater then the sin of Edom, therefore his judgment is
set down, verse. 14.

What was Moabs fourth sin.
Sixthly, he comes to Moab, his sin was greater than the sin of Ammon, his
fourth sin was this, he burnt the bones of the king of Edoms son into lime;
he took the kings son whom he had taken captive, and should have spa^^d,
he took the kings eldest son who should have succeeded to the crown, he
did not only kill him and then burn him, to give him the burial of a King,
but he burnt him to lime, and as the Jews say, incrustavit parietes, he
sparged the walls with his lime; what could he have done more with a dog;
here his cruelty exceeded the cruelty of Ammon, his punishment is set down
cap. 2. verse. 2. answerable to his sin.

Seaventhly, he comes to Judah; What was Iuda's fourth sin.
his sin was greater than the sin of Moab, their fourth sin was this,
they despised the law of the Lord, they had not kept his commandments, and
their lies caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked; they
sinned not only against men, as Moab and Ammon did, but they sinned against
the mighty God, casting off his covenant, and suffering themselves to be
deceived by idols; and here by the way, we may see what a great sin
idolatry is, the greatest cruelty committed against man is not like it, and
the breach of any natural or civil covenant is not like the breach of the
covenant with God: Look how the sins and punishments jumpe together.
their punishment is set down. cap. 2. verse. 5. I will send a fire upon Judah,
and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, that is, Nebuchadnezzar shall
burn the city of Jerusalem, and carry them captive to Babylon.

Lastly, he comes to Israel, that is, What was the fourth sin of Israel.
to the Israelites that were in Christ's time; for this is a prophecy of their
cruelty, and their sin was greatest of all; their fourth sin was this, They
sold the righteous one for silver, that is, Jesus Christ for thirty pieces of
silver. By this gradation we may see that this is the greatest sin, and that
it is meant of the selling of Christ, this is a greater sin to crucify the
Lord of glory, than to commit idolatry; and for this their fourth sin, the
Lord roots them out, that they were no more a people.

After this the Prophet begins at the greater sins and descends to the
lesser, for after that they had sold the righteous one, and crucified him; then
they oppressed the people, selling them for old shoes, they pant over the
heads of the poor, and cast them down into the dust.

Here a Preacher must admonish his hearers to beware of the fourth sin, for
if they add that fourth transgression to the former three; then the Lord will
not turn away his punishment from them.

When the plain and open rebuke may do more evil than good to the Church; it
is more fit to give the rebuke covertly than plainly; we have an example of
this; when the Apostle speaks of the coming of the Antichrist. 2. These. 4.
he says, that the Antichrist shall not be revealed till he that withholdeth
be taken out of the way; he would not say expressly, until the Roman Emperor
be taken out of the way, for then he would have drawn upon the Church at that
time the wrath of the Roman Emperor. So Ier. 25. When the Prophet had threatened
all the Kings that they should drink the cup of Gods wrath; the King of Egypt,
the King of Moab, and the Kings of Arabia, and the Medes; then he comes to
the King of Sheshak, that he shall drink after them; he says not expressly
that the King of Babel shall drink of this cup, for that open and plain
rebuke would have done more harm to the Jews at that time than good, for now
they were to be led captive to Babylon to live there; therefore he would not
say expressly that this King should drink the cup of Gods wrath, but yet
closely he insinuates this, when he names him here Sheshak, where he
alludeth to the drunken feast which the Babylonian Kings kept, called Sheshak;
here we must take heed that we follow not the Jewish curiosity, (...)
who by their Ethbbash, or alphabetum inversum find out Sheshak in Babel,
taking the last letter for the first, and the penult for the second; and
contrariwise the first for the last, and the second for the penult; as may be
seen here.



Fifthly, the time of reproof; The time of reproof.
every time is not a fit time to reprove. When Nabal was drunk Abigail spoke
nothing to him, Will ye catch the wild ass but in her month. Ier. 2. When
she is big with foale, then it is a fit time to catch her; so wild sinners
when they are laden with afflictions, then it is time to catch them; although
they have snuffed up the wind like the wild ass before. Prove. 25.11. Words
fitly spoken are like apples, of gold in pictures of silver. First, words are
like apples; an apple if ye pull it before it be ripe, then it is sour; and if
it hang too long then it rotteth; so a word spoken out of season, is either
bitter or unsavory; and as gold put in a case of cut-worke of silver appears
the more glorious, so are words kept till due time and fit occasion; (...)
and when a word is spoken in season it is verbum datum, [Gnal aphnau] super
rotis suis, upon the wheels of it.

The last thing to be considered here is the end of reproof, The end
wherefore reproves are given.
if thou reclaim thy brother then thou savest both thine own soul and his;
if thou reclaim him not, yet thou savest thine own soul, but if thou reprove
him not, then thou do hazard thine own soul and likewise his soul; in the
first thou give a good account of good sheep, in the second thou give a
good account of bad sheep, but in the third thou give a bad account of bad
sheep.

Oftentimes the success is not answerable to his pains, for they continue
still in their sins after he has reproved them. Prove. 29.9. If a wise man
will contend with a fool, whether he rage or he laugh, there is no rest. that
is, whatsoever way he deals with the foolish and wicked man, he is never a
whit the better; if he speak mildely to him, then he laughes and scorneth; if
he rebuke him then he rages, this is that which Christ him. self says, Mat.
11.17. when he piped to the Jews they would not dance, and when he mourned
to them they would not lament; and the Jews illustrate it by these examples, I
was angry with Ahaz, and gave him into the hand of the King of Damascus, and he
sacrificed to their gods. 2. Chron. 28.23. I played again with Amaziah, and
gave the King of Edom into his hands; but what better was he, for when he had
taken the King of Edom and his gods, yet he fell to worship them. 2. Chron.
25.14. So neither when I piped to them or when I lamented, was I the better.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: Levit. 19.17. In rebuking thou shall rebuke; in the
original it signifies to convict with arguments, as to reason with him. Job.
13.3. To convince him. Job. 32.12. To reprove him. Esaias. 11.4. opposite to this
is, when men hold their peace and rebuke not, as David said neither good nor
bad to Adonijah, so to flatter them in their sins. Prove. 28.23. Thou shall
not suffer sin [Gnalau] upon him, or Thou shall not bear sin for him. Levit.
22.9. Number. 18.32. or Gnalau, is for his sake. Psalm. 49. For thy sake are we
killed all the day. If thou rebuke not thy neighbor thou shall bear his sin,
if thou rebuke him, Thou seek to save his soul from death. Iam. 5.20.

EXERCITAT. XI. How a man should rule his tongue, in speaking of himself or
his neighbor. Commandment IX:
Psalm. 39.1. I said I will take heed to my ways that I sin not with my
tongue.
FOr the observing of this commandment; First, we must know both how to speak
of our selves, and of others; Secondly, when to hold our peace and not to
discover other men's secrets.

Concerning the first, it is a good rule which the Schoolmen set down
concerning the judging of our neighbor, and it is this; Vt bona ejus certa,
meliora; certa mala, minora; dubia bona, certa; dubia mala, nulla judicemus.

This rule may be cleared after this manner in these four; First, there is
God; Secondly, the child of God; Thirdly, the devil; and lastly, the wicked:
And look how these four behave themselves concerning the offenses of the
children of God, and then see how the child of God behaveth himself about his
own offenses, and this will clear this rule.

First, for God; Certa bona meliora aflimat Deus.
those good things which he sees in his children, he never extenuateth them
but inlargeth them. Example, Job. 1.8. Have thou not considered my servant Job,
how that there is not the like of him in all the earth, a perfect and an
upright man, one that fears God, and escheweth evil; but when he comes to
speak of their sins after they were pardoned; Certa mala minora.
see how sparingly he speaks of them. Example, David was a man according to
Gods own heart, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all
his days, save only in the matter of Vrijah the Hittite. 1. King. 15.7. he
speaks neither here directly of his adultery nor of his murder.

Certa bona majora facit.
Then come to the child of God, when he speaks of other men's virtues he
enlarges them. Example. Luc. 7. the elders of the Jews that came to Christ;
s^e how they lay out the virtues of the Centurion, He is worthy for whom thou
should do this, for he loves our nation and has built us a Synagogue; but
when the child of God looks upon other men's sins, he either passes them
by or speaks but sparingly of them. Certa mala minora facit.
2. Sam. 1.23. David passed by the faults that were in Saul, and praised his
virtues, but this is especially to be observed when they are dead.

Bona dubia in melius.
Thirdly, if the good that is in his neighbor be doubtful then he
interprets it to the best sense; when Christ said to Judas, that which thou
do do quickly; the Disciples expounded this to the best sense, thinking
that he had bidden him buy something for the feast.

Dubia mala nulla admittit.
Lastly, those evils which seem doubtful, he turns them to nothing. Prove.
25.23. As the North wind drives away the clouds, so does an angry countenance
a backbiting tongue.

Now let us see how the devil behaveth himself in these things, when he
speaks of the good which is in the children of God he does extenuate it;
Certae bona minora facit diabolus.
Does Job serve thee for nothing, have thou not made an hedge about him; and
about his house, and about all that he has on every side. Job. 1.9. as if he
should say, Job is but a mercenary, and serves thee for himself, and for
those things which thou give him.

Certa mala majora facit.
But when he speaks of their sins, see how this accuser does exaggerate
their faults; we see the example of this in Joshua the high priest. Zach. 3.1.
he objected to the Lord, how Joshua stood before him in soiled and torn
garments, as if he should say, is this a good high priest to serve thee? but
the Lord said unto him, increpat te Iehova, he is but titio, or a firebrand
newly drawn out of the fire, and therefore no marvel that he is not better
dressed.

Thirdly, Certa dubia facit.
he makes things which are certain to be doubtful; the Lord said, That day
that thou eatest of the forbidden tree, thou shall certainly die: but the
devil turns this in a doubtful speech, non moriendo morieris, it may be ye
die, and it may be ye die not.

Lastly, he makes things that are true to be false, Vera facit falsa.
when the Lord commanded the young Prophet that he should not eat bread at
Bethel, yet the devil falsified this commission in the mouth of the old
Prophet, and said, that he had a warrant that he might eat bread at Bethel.

Fourthly, Bona sua majora facit impius.
let us see how the wicked behave themselves here; they are full of their own
praises, the Pharisee said, I fast twice in the week, and I give my tithes:
but when he speaks of his own sins, he extenuateth them and makes them
nothing; I am not an extortioner, etc. Luc. 18. Judas said, is it I master?
Ioh. 13. Mala sua minora facit.
and the whore wiped her mouth and said, she did it not. Prove. 30.

Again see how they behave themselves toward the children of God; Certa bona
dubia facit.
when the Pharisee saw the Publican standing a far off, casting down his
eyes, knocking on his breast; yet how uncharitably does he judge of him?

Lastly, come to the child of God; Bona sua minora facit.
and see how he judges of himself; when the child of God speaks of his
own goodness, he extenuateth it. 1. Cor. 15. I am the least of all the
Apostles, and as one borne out of time. So Prove. 30.2. Surely I am more brutish
than any man, and the knowledge of man is not in me; Paul says of himself, I
was a blasphemer, and persecuted the Church; and so Gideon said, My family is
[attenuate or] poor in Manasseh, and I am the least of my fathers house. Judge.
6.15.

The second thing is to put a bridle to the tongue and not to disclose the
secrets of others; to moderate our speeches, and to speak little. Eccles. 5.1.
Psalm. 141.3. Keep the door of my lips. Qui divaricat labia sua. Prove. 16.30.
A metaphor from a whore, a man should not have a whorish mouth, (...).
the tongue should be restrained with a bit or bridle; a man should not be a
man of lips, that is, of much talk, vir labiorum; Job. 11.2. or (...), a
foolish speaker; but most of all he must put a bridle to his tongue, and keep
it from (...), that his tongue walk not through the earth, as David says.
Psalm. 70.9. (...).
the mouths of such must be stopped, (...). Tit. 1.11. and put to silence. 1.
Pet. 2.15.

Secondly, the tongue is to be bridled that it disclose not other men's secrets
which should not be revealed. Prove. 11.3. The Jews used to write upon the
back of the letters, (...)
nun, cheth, shin, which signified niddui hherem, and shammatha, which were the
three sorts of excommunication amongst them; and thereby they signify that he
who opens letters or revealed secrets concredited to him, deserves these
three sorts of excommunication. When Alexander the great was reading a letter,
Ephestion looked upon the letter, but Alexander took his signet and set upon
his lips, teaching him that he should keep it as secret as if it were a
sealed letter. If the fault be criminal which thou know of another, thou
art bound to reveal it; if it be judicially enquired, thou art bound to
reveal it; if the fa^t be intended and not acted concerning the State, thou
art bound to disclose it.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is: The tongue is an unruly evil. Iam. 3.^. and
therefore had need to be well looked unto; For death and life are in the power
of the tongue. Prove. 18.21.

Commandment. X.
EXERCITAT. I. Against Concupiscence.
Exodus 20.17. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, etc.
THe sin which Adam committed in eating of the forbidden fruit is called
originale originans, Originale origia^^. originatum.

and the punishment of this sin is called orignale originatum, which is that
corrupt habit which staneth and defiles all the actions of men; and in the
first sin, natura Corrupit personam; and in the second, persona corrumpit
naturam, that is, Adams actual transgression corrupted his person, and he
eating of the forbidden fruit, all mankind fell in him.

There are three sorts of habits, natural, infused, Habitus naturali^ infusus
acquisitus.

and acquired habits; natural habits, as original sin; Infused habits as
faith hope and charity; acquired habits, by frequent actions either good or bad.

The first sin which comes from this original sin, is defiderium
informatum vagum and non determinatum, a wandering and a light thought before
it come to consent; there is vitiositas, vitiosus motus, and vitiosa affectio.
Vitiositas is the corrupt habit which is original sin, it is in the will but
not properly from the will. Then there is vitiosus motus, the first motions
which proceed from this corrupt habit and they are partly with the will and
partly against the will; and thirdly, there is vitiosa affectio, the
concupisence and lust which is with full consent and that is altogether from
the will.

The Church of Rome makes three sorts of desires in soul, Motus. primo-primi,
secoundo-primi secundi.

first, Primo-primi motus, then Secundo-primi, and thirdly, Secundi motus.

They say that those Primo-primi motus are neither mortal nor venial because
they arise before the consideration of reason, and the will cannot repress
them because they proceed from our natural disposition. The natural appetite
in man is threefold, A threefold appetite in man.
First (...), which draws food to it, and this is common to the plants
beasts and man. Secondly, (...), in the sensitive faculty common to man and
beast; thirdly, (...), which is joined with reason these three sorts of
appetites considered Physically are not forbidden in this Commandment, but
consider them morally as they have a relation to the Law of God, they may be
sin either in the manner, object, or end in the manner when a man thirsts
for things natural excessiuely, Esaias. 5.11. Woe be to them that are strong to
carry drink. So when it is set upon a wrong object, it is not said, thou shall
not covet a wife, but thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife. Thirdly, when
we covet a thing to a wrong end, The wrong object condemned this command.
Iam. 4.3. Ye ask that ye may consume it upon your lusts. In this
Commandment the wrong object is properly condemned, but if we exceed in the
measure; then it is a breach of some other Commandment. So if it be desired
for a wrong end, and the concupiscenc^ come with full consent, then it is not
within the (...) lists of this Commandment.

Now that we may take up, that these primo-primi, motus are sin, mark thee
degrees which James sets down, Cap. 1.14. First, there is abstraction, the
second is inescation, the third is conception, the forth is consent or action,
or the full consent of the mind; and last is the perfection of it when, it
brings forth death.

The first degree is abstraction when the mind receives a thought cast into it
about the committing of evil; by these means it suffers it self to be
drawn away: the second is inescation, when the mind receives a worse thought
for the committing of sin, as when the fishes delight themselves to play with
the bait. Job compares this to a little poison which a man keeps under his
tongue, cap. 20, 17. he keeps it for a little while, and then spitteth it out
again; the third is conception, when there is a will to commit the evil, the
full consent is oftentimes put for the action, as Exodus 12, 48, The will put for
the action.
and when a stranger shall so journe with thee, and will keep the passover,
that is, has a desire to keep the passover. So Genesis 37, 21, and Ruben heard
it, and he delivered him out of their hands, that is, he would have delivered
him, the fourth degree is the action it self; and the last is the perfection,
and this is the habit of sin.

This abstraction which is the first degree, What degree of sin is cond^mned
in this command.
is condemned in this Commandment, and so inescation which is the second
degree, but the third degree when there is a will and a purpose to commit this
sin, and the action it self and the habit, all these are without the listes
of this Commandment.

These degrees and proceedings in sin may be cleared by this exemple. David
beholding Bethshabe, he had but a confused love to her, this was abstraction:
secondly, there comes suggestio prava or ine: scatio, what if I could get
such a woman. Thirdly, it comes to conception, it were good to have this
woman. Fourthly, to the action, but it never proceeded to the habit; all these
degrees were sin in David before it came to the full consent. The Church of
Rome grants that the full consent is mortal sin. Secondly, that the
delight is a venial sin, because it is but semiplena deliberatio, but they
deny motum suggestionis to be a sin.

If concupiscence it self were not a sin, it would never tempt a man to
sin, for nothing brings out sin formally, but sin: James in the place
cited distinguishes diverse sorts of sin, there are some sins consummated
and finished, and these bring forth death, but it follows not that other
sins bring not forth death, he that calls his brother fool is worthy of
Gehenna, but it will not follow, that he that calls his brother Raca, is not
worthy of Gehenna simply, but only that he is not worthy of Gehenna in that
same degree. So concupiscence consummated brings forth death, therefore
concupiscence not consummated brings not forth death, this will not follow,
but only this, it brings not forth that same sort of death which
concupiscence consummated brings forth.



The diverse exceptions of sin.
This word sin is diversely taken in the Scriptures. First, for the
transgression of the Law it self. Secondly, for the guilt of sin, Genesis 4, 7.
Sin lies before the door, that is, the guilt or punishment; sometimes for
the occasion of sin, as Deuteronomy. 19.20. I burnt your sin in the fire, that is,
the golden calfe which was the occasion of your sin. So Romans 7.7. The Law is
sin, that is, it stirs up men to sin through their corruption. Fourthly,
it is taken for the Sacrifice for sin, as Hos. 2.4. they eat the sins of
the people, that is, the sacrifice for sin, but here concupiscence is taken
properly for sin.

Sometimes concupiscence is put for our corrupt desires concupiscence brings
forth death, that is, Concupiscence how sometimes taken.
the concupiscence of our appetite brings forth actual sins, and sometimes
concupisence is put for the effect of sin brought forth in the act by our
corrupt desires, per metony miam effecti; as To. 7.7. Sin wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence, here it is put for the effect of sin brought fourth
by our corrupt desires, but howsoever it be taken, it is still sin.

The Church of Rome holds that these first cogitations in the heart of man
are not sin; The Church of Rome holds concupiscence not to be sin.
and they read these words. Genesis 8, 21. I will not curse the ground any more
for man's sake, because the heart of man is prone to evil even from his
Youthhead. Phygius the Papist reasons out of this place, perversely
translating it this ways, that for which God spares a man is not sin, but
God spares a man for the thoughts of his heart, therefore they are not sin
in themselves, for that which is sin in it self, provocketh the Lord more to
anger still.

But this reason arises out of a false translation, (...) quamvis.
for the word Ci, should be translated quamvis, although the cogitations of his
heart be evil. So it is taken Genesis 47.15. why should we dye in thy presence,
although the money fails. As though the Lord should say, although the
cogitations of his heart be evil, and I might be justly angry with him, both
for his original and actual sins, and destroy him, as I did in the deluge,
yet in my mercy, I will not do this to him. Again, (...)
they translate Rangh badly here, prena in malu^, where as it should be
translated, altogether evil, and so they translate Minnagnora badly, (...)
ab adolescentia, for the child is called Nagnar, as soon as he stirs in
his mothers belly. And lastly they say, (...)
omne figmentum cogitationis est intentum tantum ad malum, and so they pass by
all the degrees, how the Lord exaggerateth this sin that is in the heart of
man. For it is more to be evil than to incline to evil, and figmentum
cogitationis cordis is more, than cogitationes cordis, jotzer lebh signifies
completas cogitationes cordis, and incompletas: the vulgar Latin takes it
only for the actual imagination of the heart, as if there were some good in
the heart it self; Cornelius a Lapid in Genesis 8.
and they make two shops, as it were, in the heart of an unregenerate man, one
of concupiscence, and another of virtue, it is in man's choice, says he, either
to work in the one, or in the other, and to choose the good if he please, being
assisted by God; as though there were some power in him to concur with God;
but this word rak takes away all this. (...)




Josh. 10. We are under the sin of Baal-peor unto this day, here the fact was
past, and the guilt remained; So the guilt is taken away from a regenerate
person, and yet the concupiscence remains. What part of sin is taken away
in a regenerate man.
There is materiale and formale in peccato; the formal part, which is the
obligation to the punishment, is taken away, although the material part may
remain, Iere. 50.20. In those days, and at that time, says the Lord, the
iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and the sins
of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
And Romans 8.1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. A land-marke
removed out of the land, the material part remains still, to wit, the stone,
but not the formal part which is a relation to be such a mark; when a
Magistrate gives over his place, formale respectivum deest hic, that is, men
respect him not as he is a Magistrate no more, but yet he is a man still; so
this (...), or concupiscence which remains in the children of God after
Baptism, is sin in it self, but this relation, the guilt which is the
obligation to the punishment is taken away, manet vitium, sed tollitur
judicium, cessat (...) sed restat (...).

Again, there is an actual guilt, Reatus Actualis, potentialis.

and a potentiall guilt in sin; the actual guilt is taken away from the
sins of those who are justified; but the potentiall guilt is still in them;
there were serpents in the Wilderness which stung the Israelites, Number. 21. and
there was a viper on Paul's hand which hurt him not, Act. 28.5. The sins of
the wicked are like the Serpents in the Wilderness which stung the Israelites
to death, but the sins of the children of God are like to the viper upon
Paul's hand, although it had a sting in it, yet it was restrained by the power
of God that it could not hurt him; so the guilt of the sins in the children
of God have no power to sting them; but in heaven there shall be neither
political nor actual guilt to hurt them, as there is no sting in the brazen
Serpent at all.

Secondly, That the second first motions are mortal.
they say that secundo primi motus are venial, because men resist them, and
fight against them, they are more worthy of praise than of punishment; and they
add that sin is said to be venial three manner of ways, first, veniale ex
causa, secundo ex forma; tertio, veniale ex eventu. Veniale ex causa forma
eventu.
No sin venial in respect of the cause.


Veniale ex causa, as when a man does a thing of ignorance, here they say his
ignorance makes his sin venial, but this is false, for there was a
sacrifice under the Law for sins of ignorance, to teach us that ignorance
must be purged by the blood of Christ as well as other sins.

Secondly, they make these motions which are with ^trife, to be veniale ex
forma, but every sin is the transgression of the Law, whether they be great
sins or l^sser, that sin which made Paul to cry out, O wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from this body of death was this a venial sin of it
self. (...) venial ^nt.
We acknowledge then, sins only to be venial, ab eventu, that is, through
the merits of Christ, which purges all sort of sin, from Adams original sin,
to the habit of sin and to the idle and flying motion, to the sin with
reluctation, to the full consent and act.

^ct.
They say, as the Physician is not angry with him who is thirsty, but with him
who drinks contrary to his commandment, so God is not angry for
concupiscence, but if the man contrary to his commandment, give the will and
consent to the sin, then he breaks the commandment, and God is angry with
him.



actiones sunt suppositorum, sin is committed by the person in whom it is,
Romans 7. Not I, but the sin that dwells in me.

Paul represents a double person.
Paul represents a double person, first, the unregenerate, when he says, I
allow not that which I do; than of the regenerate, I serve the law of God in
my mind, the a^tions of the regenerate part, are not the actions of the
unregenerate part, yet they are both actions of the whole person. Example, if a
Gardener should ingraft in the stock of a tree, some grafts of the Apple tree,
and some of the Crab tree, none can say that the graft of the Apple tree
bears Crabs, or that the graft of the Crab tree bears Apples: so we cannot
say, the regenerate part brings forth sin, or the unregenerate part
brings forth good, and yet we say Paul brings forth both.

It is a question which much exercises our Divines, what it is which is
condemned in this last Commandment, whether it be the first motions of the
heart, before they come to consent, and in the rest of the Commandments,
whether it be the full consent.

Others hold that they are distinguished thus: the habitual sins are
condemned in the former Commandments, and the concupisence condemned in this
Commandment, are not only the first motions of the heart before they come to
full consent; Whether concupisce^ce before it come to consent, or after it come
to act, b^ condemned in this commandment,
but also when concupiscence bursteth forth into act, although they be not
consummate sins and habitual. Now that those sins are condemned in this
last Commandment which are not habitual, but actual only; they go about to
prove it out of Mark. 10.19. thou know the Commandments, do not commit
adultery, do not kill, do not swear, do not bear false witness, defraud
not, honor thy father and mother. In this enumeration of the Commandments,
they say, that, to steal, and to defraud here, are two diverse Commandments,
to steal, belongs to the eight Commandment, and to defraud to the tenth; and
this defraud they make to be the act manifested, but not the habitual act
only, which is condemned in the former Commandment, but of this we have need
to enquire more.

How shall we know when concupiscence is condemned in the last Commandment,

How we may know may know what concupiscence is within the last command, and
what is condemned in other commands.
When we resist the Temptation, and fight against it, then it is within the
lists of the last Commandment, the Temptation sometimes aggreditur, sed non
ingreditur, as when the devil tempted Christ, here the temptation because it
took no hold upon Christ, it was not a breach of any of the Commandments, and
here it was in him true, scire malum non est malum, Secondly, ingreditur sed
non progreditur, when the devil lays the tentation before the regenerate,
although he oftentimes resist the temptation, yet it takes some hold upon
him, but grace suppresseth it again, and this is within the last Commandment,
and it has some inclination to consent.

Every sort of strife about sin is not within this Commandment, Lucta
Ethica. Theologica.

there is Lucta Ethica, and Lucta Theologica; this Lucta Ethica such as was in
Medea, is not forbidden in this last Commandment: for the conflict was betwixt
her mind and her affection, and not betwixt sin and grace in the same
affection. She may be compared to that cake which the Prophet, Hos. 7.8.
speaks of, which was raw on the one side, and baked on the other side, but
the child of God is like to the Cake somewhat baked on both sides and somewhat
raw on both sides, A difference betwixt the will of Medea and Paul's will.
the will of Medea is only Satan's, although there was some light in her
understanding, but the understanding and the will of Paul are partly regenerate
and partly unregenerate; the understanding of Medea, was like a glass
representing to the will what it should do, but the will was unwilling to
follow it; a sin is perfected more by the perverseness of the will then by
the darkness of understanding, an unregenerate man is compared to the wild
Ass which snuffeth up the wind, Iere. 2.24. that is, who follows the swinge
of his affections altogether, therefore we see though a man by general sort
of knowledge confess that God should be loved above all things; A great
difference betwixt a man's general knowledge of God, and his particular
judgment.
yet in his particular judgment and practice he thinks it a hard thing to
follow Gods will rather than his own, and from this sort of knowledge there
follows an imperfect sort of will which the Schoolmen call rather velleitas
than voluntas; but from the latter sort of understanding, there follows a
full consent which is properly called the will: by the general sort of
judgment, the unregenerate man judges that he should rather-love God than his
base lusts, but when he comes to his particular practice, he had rather
offend God than want his base lust. When the eyes of Balaam were opened, there
were some glimpses of light in his understanding which made this velleitas in
him, but not voluntas.

Where there is a sharp conflict betwixt the flesh and the spirit, that is
within this Commandment, The conflict betwixt the flesh and the spirit, is
like salt Peter and brimstone.
as when two opposite things meet together, cold salt Peter, and hot
Brimstone make a great noise; so when grace and sin meet together in the
child of God, they make a great stir, and make him to cry out, O miser ego,
hence come these words of war, To pull down holds, 2 Cor. 10.4. to buffet
(...), 1 Cor. 9.27. but where there is a little glimpse in the understanding,
and faint desires in the will, they are like the crackling of thorns under a
pot, Eccles. 7, 6.

The faint desires of the will of the unregenerate are soon quenched again,
they are but, Lucida intervalla furiosis, and they see worse after the glimpse
is gone than before, as those who see with a flash of lightning, see worse then
they did before.

Again we may discern when concupiscence is within the lists of this last
Commandment, and when not, How to know when concupiscence is within this
command.
thus; he that wills the end, and wills not the means, this conflict is not
within the lists of this Commandment, as Prove. 13.4, piger vult et non vult.
he wills the end, but he wills not the means tending to the end, Hos. 10.
Ephraim delighted in threshing, but not in plowing; here Ephraim would have
commodity of Religion, but he will not take the pains to mortify his sins,
here he wills, and he wills not when men wish heaven, but wish not the
means, which lead to it, this conflict is not with in the lists of this last
commandment; for in the conflict of the Child of God, he wills both the end
and the means but he is defective in them both.

Grace is like a Prince to the soul, and the soul like a rebel.
Grace is the Prince in the soul, the will in the Child of God may sometimes be
drawn away from the King, and fly to the enemy, as David fled to Achis for
fear, yet when he went abroad to fight he killed the Philistimes in the
South-country, and he carried still a loyal heart to his King: so when the
Child of God is taken Captive, yet he has ever loyal heart to his King; but
the wicked are rebels against their King, take arms against him, draw away his
subjects from him, as Jeroboam did to Rehoboam.

Ethi. 1. cap. vis. The faculties of the soul like the two sides of man in
moving.
The Philosopher compares the two faculties of the mind to the two sides of
man, to the right side, and to the left side, when a man moves the one slowly,
he inclines more to the other; so says he, those who use reason and follow
her, they are more hardly carried after their appetites, and they who follow
their appetites, follow reason the less; and he calls reason the right side,
which is the strongest, and the appetite the left side; this may be said fitly
of the Christian soul, grace the right side, and sin the left side, if sin
prevail, then the left side draws the right, but if grace prevail then the
right side draws the left.

There has been a great question disputed of old, concerning the body and the
soul, whether the soul did more harm to the body, or the body to the soul?
(...) Theophrastus said that the soul was bound to pay a great hire to the
body, because it lodged such an unruly guest in it, but the other said that the
body should pay so much to the soul, because it was defective and performed
not its duty soul, but if the spirit should intend action against the flesh,
as the soul did against the body, what great complaint might be given in
against the flesh? for sometimes the flesh brings the spirit so low that the
spirit scarcely stirs in a man; as in that incestuous Corinthian, there was
the flesh and the spirit in that great fall, Let him be delivered to Satan to
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be safe, 1 Cor. 5.5. Here
there was the flesh and the spirit in him, but the spirit was at a low ebb; a
tyrannous master did never so tread upon his slave, as the flesh does upon the
spirit. Secondly, when the spirit begins to creep out of the fetters, and
to serve God, how unwilling is the flesh, Cant. 5.2. My heart waketh, but I am
a sleep. So, the spirit is ready, but the flesh is weak, Matthew. 26.42.
Thirdly, when the spirit is in the best estate, yet the flesh hangs on still,
Heb. 12. And, these who are washen have need that their feet be washen, Ioh.
13.10.

The comforts which the child of God has in this combat, are these, first,
What comforts the children of God have in their spiritual combat, first in the
aussurance of victory.
he has the commandment of God to go on in the combat. In other combats men
are not certain of the event, and therefore, he should not boast who puts
on the harness, but he that lays it aside. 2 King. 20. but in this combat,
no sooner put we the spiritual armor upon us, but we may be persuaded of the
victory. Jacob had three mighty wrestlings; first, he wrestled with Esau in his
mothers belly. Secondly, when he pleaded with him for the blessing. And
thirdly, when he strove with the Angel. In the first conflict he perceived not
what it meant; in the second conflict he got a great assurance of the victory;
but in the third conflict he got a full assurance of the victory, if thou have
prevailed with God, much more shall thou with men, Genesis 32, 28. So in the
conflict betwixt the flesh and the spirit, the child of God at the first
scarcely perceives this conflict, then the flesh begins to stir more
against the spirit, and then the child of God gets some more certainty of
the victory, at last he gets a full assurance as Israel did, and he shall
prevail as a prince of God.

2 In our second the holy spirit.
Again, in this conflict betwixt the flesh and the spirit, we have a good
Second, the spirit helps our infirmities, Romans 8.26. Grace is very weak in
the children of God, it is like smoking Flax, or a bruised reed, but here is
our comfort, that we have a strong helper, and there are more with us than
against us, 2 King. 6.16.

3 In our Judge Jesus Christ.
Thirdly, we have a favorable Judge in this combat, when Moses saw an Egyptian
and an Israelite striving together, he killed the Egyptian, but saved the
Israelite; So the Lord in the conflict, he favors the regenerate part, and
will kill the flesh, the unregenerate.

4 In our reward.
Fourthly, we have a rich reward, I have fought a good fight, and hence is laid
up for me a crown of glory, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me
at that day, 2 Timothy 4.8.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this, when the children of God feel this conflict betwixt
the flesh and the spirit, they think it very grievous, and they say with
Rebecka, that it had been better for them that they had never conceived; but
let them imitate Rebecka in this, that had recourse to the Lord by prayer, and
she got this answer, The elder shall serve the younger, so shall thou get this
answer, the old man, sin, which molesteth and troubles thee, shall serve the
new man, grace. If violence had been offered to a Maid that was betrothed
under the Law, if she held her peace and cried not, then she was to dye the
death, but if she cried out, then she was not to dye, Deuteronomy. 22.23. So when
these violent temptations are offered to the soul, if we hold our peace and
harbor them, then we are the children of death, but if we cry out for violence
offered to the soul, as Paul did, Romans 7.24. O wretched man, who shall deliver
me from this body of death, then we are not to dye.

EXERCITAT. II. That the tenth Commandment is but one, and should not be
divided in two. Commandment X.
Exodus 20.17. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet
thy neighbors wife, nor his, etc.
THe Lord expressly says, The Church of Rome numbreth up the commandments
falsely.
that there are ten Commandments, Exodus 34, 20. but the Church of Rome,
because the second Commandment touches them somewhat near to the quick,
there they would shuffle in the second Commandment with the first, and make
them all one, and to make up the number of ten, they divide this last
Commandment in two parts, and they make the ninth Commandment to forbid the
coveting of our neighbors wife, and the tenth to forbid the coveting of our
neighbors house and goods.

But if these were two Commandments, we should not know in what order they
should stand, The last commandment cannot be divided in two.
for Exodus 20. it is said, Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house; but Deuteronomy.
5.20. Thou shall not covet thy neighbou^^ wife, is put first, which was in the
last place before.

Secondly, the Apostle, Romans 7. calls it (...), in the singular number, and
not (...) commands in the plural number; Oleaster upon Exodus 20. refuses this
division of theirs, and plainly shows that the last Commandment is but one,
desiderium vxoris non constituit unum praeceptum, and desiderium Asini aliud
praeceptum, sed ambo unum praeceptum faciunt.

Sicut se habet actus ad actum, sic concupiscentia ad concupiscentiam, but the
act of adultery and the act of concupiscence are diverse, therefore the
concupiscence should be diverse.

There is not a twofold concupiscence, bu^ diverse acts of one concupiscence.
There is a difference betwixt the conception of sin and the birth and
perfection of it; when it is brought forth and branched out, then it appears
what kind of sin it is; it being in the seed it cannot be so distinguished,
and if every particular act of coveting does make a diverse Commandment, then
the number of them should be more then ten.

Exodus 20. and Deuteronomy. 5, includes these which we make the first second and
Commandment in one, by the Letter, so Deu. 5. that which we make but one
Commandment, the Hebrews make it two, thou shall not covet thy neighbors
Wife, thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, to be the tenth.

How the Hebrews signify the commands to cohere and to be distinguished.
The Scriptures are distinguished by, called Semucha, noting continued
sentences; and by which signifies Petucha, the beginning of a new, but of a
less section; and these Semuchoth are set down in the Commandes to signify
that there is a cohesion amongst them, for there is a greater cohesion betwixt
the first and second Commandment than betwixt the second and the third, and
therefore Semucha is added to them.

Deuteronomy to be interpreted by Exodus.
Again, although the last Commandment be distinguished by Semucha, Deuteronomy. 5.
yet Exodus 10. it is set down without any Samuch, and we must interpret rather
Deuteronomy by Exodus, than Exodus, by Deuteronomy. For Exodus is the first
setting down of the Law, and Deuteronomy is but the repetition of the Law, and
we are to observe that the Commandments are otherwise pointed then any of the
rest of the Scriptures. The Commandments are pointed and distinguished two
ways. First, in respect of the sentences, and next in respect of the verses.
In respect of the sentences they are but lightly distinguished, because they
join and couple the Commandments together which have greatest affinity, but
in respect of the verses, they are fully distinguished.

The Hebrews have four sorts of distinctions. First, The points of
distinction among the Hebrews.
they have Hypostigma, or semi-incisum, this is their meanest sort of
distinction, and this they use in a continued speech, this distinction they
call Tiphha, (...)
which is less then our Comma, their second distinction which is incisum,
distinguishes somewhat more then semi incisum, and they call it Rebhiang, (...)
it answers to our Comma, and they have two of these, Rebhiang, and
Zakephkaton, the third is the more perfect distinction, distinguishing the
whole member of a verse, and yet continued: and this they call Atnahh,
answering to our Colon, (...)
the fourth distinction is the shuting up of ^ verse fully; (...)
and this they call Silluk answering to our punctum; example, the seventh
Commandment is distinguished from the eighth, both lightly, and fully, (...)
What way the cammands are distingui-one from another.
it is fully distinguished by this point Silluk () from the eight Commandment,
and it is lightly distinguished from it by the point Atnahh (^) So the eighth
is both fully and lightly distinguished from the ninth; and so the first and
second Commandments, which the Church of Rome would make but one, are
distinguished both fully and lightly as the rest are, they are lightly
distinguished to teach us that they must be joined together in our obedience,
How they are distinguished lightly, and fully.
therefore they are set down with a conjunction copulative, thou shall not
kill, and thou shall not commit adultery; and they are fully distinguished, to
note that they are diverse Commandments: but these two thou shall not covet
thy neighbors wife, thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, which they
would make two Commandments, are only lightly distinguished by the point
Atnahh (^) and are not fully distinguished as the rest are, to teach us that
they are but one Commandment; and here we must not regard the distinction so
much which is marked by, as the pointing it self.

Conclusion.
The conclusion of this is, as no man may conjoyne that which God has
separated. So no man may separate that which God has conjoined; God has
distinguished the first and the second Commandment, therefore they should not
conjoyne them; he has conjoined the tenth Commandment, therefore they should
not separate nor divide it.

The conscience binds more than the Law of the superior, Let every soul be
subject to the higher power, Romans 13.1. the supreme power has a Commandment
above inferior powers, and this Commandment binds all men both in soul and
body, and James gives the reason, because There is one lawgiver who is able to
save and destroy, Iam. 4.12. and Christ says, fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to
destroy both soul and body in hell. Matthew. 10.28, it is only contempt of the
Magistrates Law which defiles the conscience, primario it is this, because he
disobeyeth Gods Law which commands obedience to the Magistrate, but the
Commandment of the Magistrate, non influit primario and per se in
conscientiam. The Commandment of an inferior Magistrate, obliges as well as
the Commandments of the superior Magistrate, but the conscience is the
immediate Deputy always under God for the internal obedience, but here we
must put a difference, etc.

In the age before Christ, the Doctors of the Jews took titles to themselves
to be called Rab, Rabbi, and Rabban; and they say Rabbi was less than Rabban,
for they called few of the Doctors Rabban; Rabbi was their common Title, but
Rabban was their highest Title.

But why does Christ forbid to call any man Master.

This Title is not condemned simply by Christ, Rabbi, or Master-ship, so to be
called Master, as the Scholars to have their faith pinned upon their sleeve,
and their faith to rest simple upon them, whereas the Lord will have our faith
immediately depend upon him, and if an Angel from heaven should preach another
Gospel let him be accursed, Galath. 1.8.

The Innocent blood when it was shed, was not expiated but by the blood of him
who killed, but he who casually killed, the blood which he shed did not bring
on guilt properly; but rather a ceremonial pollution, because it defiled the
Land; and therefore it was purged by the death of the high priest.

Polygamy in a large sense is called adultery, and so incest is called
fornication, 1 Cor. 5.1. it is reported commonly that there is fornication
among you, the fathers make it a middle sin betwixt adultery and fornication;
having a respect to their knowledge and the times wherein they lived; but
respecting the first institution, it was adultery.

The bill of divorce was permitted to be given by Moses, to obviate their
unjust divorces; but for adultery there was death, for suspicion of adultery
there was the bitter water.

To praise men in that which they are most defective, is vile flattery, Paul
was far from this, when he said to the Corinthians, what shall I say to you;
shall I praise you in this; I praise you not 1 Cor. 11.22. So to humor them in
their ambition, such was Tertullus to Faelix, Act. 24.2. Seeing that very
worthy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy providence, we accept it always,
and in all places, most noble Faelix, with all thankfulness. Such flatterers
are like a false Glass which makes things to seem more than they are.
