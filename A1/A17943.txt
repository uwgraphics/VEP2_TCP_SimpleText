Here begins the Kalendre of the new Legende of England.



The Prologe.
THe first treatyce of this present book is taken out of the new Legende of
the sayntys of England Irelande / Scotland / and Wales for them that
understand not the Laten tongue / that they at their pleasure may be occupied
therewith / and be thereby ye more apt to learn the resydue when they shall here
the hole Legende / And it is to understand yt not oonly those saints that
were borne in theyse Countries be in the said Legende and i^ this little
treatise / But also diverse other blessed saints that were borne beyond the sea / and that came into any of theyse countries England / Irelande /
Scotla^de / and Wales doing there any notable thing to the honor of god /
and to the profit of the people as to preche to them the Faith of our Lord
/ and to set the people in good order / Or that have lived a blessed life i^
any of theyse Countries to give the people example of good living / Be also in
the said Legende and in this present treatise and be accounted to be of that
country that they so came into / As saint Augustyne the appostell of England
whom blessed saint Gregorye then being pope sent fro Rome with saint Paulyn /
saint Laurence the confessoure and diverse other in his company to preche the
faith of our Lord to the people of this Realm then being Idolatroures and
clearly alyenatyd fro truth whereupon Saint Augustyne Faithfully
accomplysshynge his Auctoryte with his company conuertyd Saint Ethelbert then
king of Kent and all his people to the faith of our lord / And after saint
Paulyne converted saint Edwyn then king of Northamhumbre and all his people /
in which countries Churches were builded Temples of Idollys destroyed or
turned into Churches / bysshoppes and priests ordained in all the country /
And the faith gladly resceyued with great devotion and after ye death of saint
Augustyne and of king Ethelbert king Edbalde yt was sone to king Ethelbert
fell to Idolatrye forsakynge the christian faith / whereby the faith there was
like to have holly perysshed / whom ye said saint Laure^ce which was busshop of
Canterbury next after saint Augustyne by especyall miracle of saint Peter
reduced again to the faith / as in the life of saint Laurence apperyth / and
long after their time other holy men / saint Adryan / saint Honorye / saint
Felyx / saint Beryn / and diverse other came fro beyond the sea and much
edefyed the people i^ this Realm of England and establysshed greatly that
faith which saint Augustyne / saint Paulyne / saint Laurence and their company
had begone / and also diverse countries in England which were not holly
converted in saint Augustynes days / and some that after his days fell again
to Idolatrye the^ they reduced to the faith of our lord. And nevertheless
right few of this Realm of England specially of ye Common people have hard
of any such men in so much yt ye oonly herynge of their names will be a
learning to most men / and so it will be of diverse other blessed men and women
that were borne i^ this Realm / which have done many notable things for the
comen welthe of the people thereof as well profitable for this life as for ye
life to come / as saint Dunstane / saint Deus dedit / saint Wylfryde / Saint
Oswalde / saint Cedd / and saint Chadde bysshoppes / Saint Ethelbert / saint
Edwyn / saint Edgare / and saint Oswalde kyngys / saint Sexburgh / and saint
Ermenylde queen's / saint Wallen / saint Gylbert / saint Wulryke / and diverse
other holy men and women / as in the said Legende / and also in this treatise
apperyth / by which gloryouse sayntys with other borne in other Countries as
before apperyth the faith of our Lord has been p^ched received and greatly
prosperyd in this Realm so that many of our Ancestors neighbors and
friends by the mercy of our lord be now in ye Joys of heuyn to pray for us.
And for all the people and we also by the grace and goodness of our lord be
heyrys apparau^te to the kyngedome of heuyn / And if the law of god had not
ben known i^ theyse parties both we and our Au^cestours might percase have
lived in erroures as other do / wherefore we be much bounden to love them and
honor them / and in likewise to do that is in us to help other as they did
to help us our Au^cestours and frendys / And verily if there were now in
these days the high Charity and perfyte love to almighty god and to our
neighbor yt was in theyse blessed seyntes or at leest a desire thereto with
love of Justice and zele of ye comen welthe and like desire to bring ye people
to good life with hole trust and sure faith i^ our lord as was i^ theyse
blessed men and women. It would renew ye face of this world and bring a new
light among the people / as it did in the time of ye said glorious seyntys in
whom florysshed and shyned all perfeccyon of virtues as euydently will appear
to them that will read their Legende true mekenes inuyncyble pacyence simple
obedyence heavenly wisdom perfyght charity love of Justice with mercy / pity /
and co^passyon upon their neyghbourys riches in pouerte / and pouerte in
riches with other like virtues and gracyous gifts of god many of them were
nedye outward but within forth they were replenyssed with goostlye swetnes
and Comfort / In the sight of the world and in their own sight they were
vile and abiecte / but in the sight of almyghtye god and of all seyntes they
were precious and syngulerly elect / Wherefore the people of Irelande have saint
Patryke for his blessed life and for that he converted much people there to
the faith in great honor and in their necessyties they call unto him for
help with great devotion / And in likewise in Scotland the people there have
saint Nynian co^menlye called saint Tronyon in great honor for the same cause
/ And in Wales they have devotion to saint Dauyd for his blessed life / and for
confermynge and establysshynge of ye people in the faith by his prechynge and
good example / but in this Realm of England what so ever is the occasyon /
few people in comparyson of the multitude have devotion to any of these
blessed seyntes that have labored for the welthe of the people in this Realm
i^ time paste or that have them in honor as other Countries have other
seyntes in like case and yet we know right well that seyntys in heuyn be i^
such favor with almighty god ye their prayer is herd for such persons as
they pray for and we may not dowte but they be redye to pray for us if we do
worship them and call unto them by our prayer for help. God forbede that any
of us should think or say the contrary as thinking in his mind or saying
in this wise / Saints be above i^ heaven and we be here bynethe and therefore
they have no mind upon us for to help us or to pray for us so to think or
so to say is to think plainly and to say that seyntys have no charity and
that is not so for if they had charity when they were here i^ Earth much more
they have it now in heaven But when they were here they had great charity as
it is open by the great labourys that they had for the salvation of the
people of this Realm and prayed for them not called upon so to do / Then
what shall the great charity do that they have now in heaven / Let us believe as
saint Paul says. Charitas nunquam excidit. The charity that any person has
here and does contynewe therein while he lives seasyth not in Heaven neither is
there dimynysshed but it is there encreasyd and made more So of these saints
their charity is more in heaven now then it was here wherefore if the great
charity that they had here made them so ready to pray for the people that called
not unto them for any help or prayer as is aforesaid / shall not their great
charity that they have now i^ heaven make them much more ready to pray specially
for all such as does worship them and call for help unto the^ / More over if
their prayer were hard here byneth in the Earth where they were sofer from ye
blessed p^sence of god / must not then their prayer be herd now above i^ heaven
where they have god p^sent face to face therefore sythen we be sure first of
this yt they be redye to pray for all yt will deuotly call unto them sure also
second of this that their prayer shall be herd let us devoutly as we can with
all our hearts call unto them for help to pray for us and by ye grace of our
lord they shall here our prayer and shall opteyne for us yt we desire or a
another thing yt shall be more prophytable for us and where ye people of this
Realm of England honor the glorious martyr saint George as their chief
patron and defe^der by whose prayer and special proteccio^ they have been i^
time past p^seruyd against their enemies and by ye grace of our lord i^ time
to come shall be yet nevertheless if they also honor theyse glorious seyntes
yt have labored i^ this Country for ye health of ye people as is aforesaid
they shall thereby ryghthyghly please their Patron saint George / and so they
shall do all other saints such as they have honored and had devotion to i^
time past for there is among ye blessed seyntes in heaven / one will / one love
and one full charity / where ye honor to all is honor to one / and the
honor to one is honor to them all / and if any thing herein be mystaken or
not spoken in co^uenye^t English or dew order as it should be or if it be
over shortly touched or not suffycye^tly exp^ssyd / whereby any manner of
person might be offended or take occasion of excepcio^ / yt it will please him
to take it for ye best / for so it is meant and charitably to refourme it by ye
Legende Where need shall be taking ye pryncypall intent of this treatise to be
as a Kalendre / to show ye names of ye seyntes of their country and where
they lie as it shall do / when it apperyth so far in ye Legende as it does
most come^ly but not i^ all places / to show also some little thing of their
virtues and miracles with some perte of their stories shortly towched / yt it
may be as a preparatyfe or a beginning to reduce the people of this Realm ye
rather to have the said blessed seyntes in love and honor for there can no
thing be loved and honored but it be known And for almoche as it is but of
late time sith the said Legende was gathered to gyther in such manner as it is
now / and that every thing in this treatise is shortly touched more like to
be a Kalendre then a Legende co^syderynge also that the most part of tho
saints that be in the said legende and in this calendar were either borne in
this Realm or were abiding therein and that theyse other countries Irelande /
Scotland and Wales / of very right owe to be subject and obedyent to this
Realm of England as it semyth this little treatyce may conuenyentlye be
called the calendar of the new Legende of England.

Moreover next after ye said Kalendre follows the life of saint Byrget
shortly abrygged a holy and blessed wydowe / which life is right expedyent for
every manner of person to look upon most in especial for them that live
imatrymony or in the estate of wydowhod yt they may se what grace and virtue
was in this blessed woman which lived in the same degree as they do / and the
rather to be encouraged to desire to have like grace and virtue In ye latter
end of this book is a little draught of Master water Hylto^ of the meddled
life she wynge how and by whom it should be used and though it have been
Imprynted before this time yet take it charitably / for ye more a good thing
is known the better it is and parcase by this occasyon it may come to the
knowledge of some men, that otherwise should never have hardespeke of it.

De sancto Adriano abbate and confessore.
Saint adryan was abbot of the monastery of viridian / that is a little fro
napuls And for his ^^^tue / and cunning vitalian / the pope would have made
him archebussope of Caunterbury / and he of mekenes refusyd it for his escuse
desired yt saint Theodre might be elected thereto / and so he was upon this
condition that he should accompany saint Theodre into England and he assentyd
and so refusing the honor he took the labor / And when he came into
England he had co^myttyd to him the rule of the monasterye of saint Augustyne
of Caunterbury and there he gadered a great multitude of dyscyples and taught
them metyr astronomye arythmetryke / and also dyuynite / and many of his
dyscyples could greek and late^ tongue as well as their own / and he with
saint Theodre taught ye tewnes of singing in ye church of England which before
their time was only used in Kent / and he passed out of this world full of
good works / and good exaumples the.v. I^^s of January / in the year of our
lord God seuyn hundred ^^iii. and lies in his monastery at Canterbury And
after his death shypme^ of England which were like to have been robbed by
pyratis i^ ye see by prayer to saint Adryan were delivered / he raised a man
fro death / and he appeared to one / and bad him show saint Dunstane yt he
dwelled i^ houses yt were well and sufficiently covered / but ye mother of
almighty god and he / and other her servants lay open to ye heuyns wherefore
anon saint Du^stane repaired the Church of our Lady / and used much to be
there in contemplacyon / and on a night as he was there in prayers he saw
euydently our Lady and saint Adryan in the said Church lauding and honourynge
our Lord.

De sancto aido sieve Aidano abbate.
A Man of Irlonde called sedia / and his wife prayde certyen holy men to Pray
for them that they might have a Child / and after they had prayed / they bad
the man and his wife goo whom and in the night following the husband saw a
bright sterre fall into the mouth of his wife / And she saw a bright moan
fall i^to ye mouth of her Husbo^de / and after they had a sone whom they
called Aidus / or Aidanus / And when he came to age / he and his fellow
Molassus entendyd to goo on Pilgrimage / and they wiste not whether / And by
Inspyracio^ of our Lord they bad.ii. great Trees growinge thereby tell them what
they should do / And anon the two Trees fell down oon toward ye North / and
ye other toward the Southe / And so the Children divided / and saint Aidus
came into the country of Lagmenciu^ / and an An^gell brought him to the place
where he would be / and he went upon the water to a place where two children
were drowned / and by his prayers he reysyd them to life / and after he came to
saint Dauyd into Wales / and was with him a long time / and there for haste as
he went to the wood he left his book open behind him / and though it rayned
in other places / it rayned not upon his Book / And saint Dauyd as he was by
the seesyde blamyd him for leuynge his Book behind him / wherefore anon he lay
prostrat before saint Dauyd / and of mekenes would not rise till he were bydden
/ And saint Dauyd retournyd whom and for gate to bydde him rise / and so the
flow of the sea came / and as he lay ye see rose about him and touchyd him
not / And when saint Dauyd myssed him he was much heavy / and sent Brethren for
him / and they found him lyenge in the bottom of ye see / and drew him up
into their ship etc. And on a time when saint Aidus went fro saint Dauyd into
Irlonde / he forgate his Cymbale behind him in Wales / and when he had need of
it / it was suddenly brought over the sea to him / Wherefore he thanked our Lord
/ and a another time saint dauyd sent for him / and he went to him And when he
should goo again into Irlonde / he asked saint Dauyd how he should get over
the sea / and he bad him goo to the sea side / and any be that he found go
on him to his Monastery / And he found a be like a Horse and on him he went
over the sea into Irlonde / and then the Beast went again into the sea / He
was a great gyuer of Alms / and fastyd.l. days. and.l. nyghtes to gedyr / and
he dyed in great Age full of good Works and virtues the day before the first
kalendas of March. And at saint Dauythys he is called moadoke / and there his
Feast is kept with great honor.

De sa^cto Aidano episcopo and confessore.
THere is a monastery in ye I Will of hii which of old time belo^ged to Brytayne

first co^uertyd by them / And se yt Aida^ being busshope was sent fro yt I Will
to preche to ye people of England / and he taught noon otherwise but as he
lyuyd him self / what so euyr was geuyn to him by the King or Rychemen / He
gave it to pour men / he went on foot to Preche and Rode not without great
need / All that were in company with him should Read or Pray / And when he was
at dinner though it were with the King as it was seldom he would goo fourth
and pray / he would always reprove Rychemen when they offendyd / and not
forbere them for fere / nor for their Auctoryte / he gave oil to a priest
which was called vtta as he was going to fette enflede daughter to king Edwyn
to be married to king oswy / And bad him if any tempest took him in the sea /
that he should cast the oil into the sea And it should cease / and so it
prouyd / and when penda had thought to have burnyd the City of bamburghe for
yt he could not win it by streyngthe / he leyde much wood / and hey nyghe to
the town / and saint aidan then being in ye I Will of Fern to miles fro thens
when he saw the Fire above the City wallys prayed to our lord for help / And
by his prayer the wind changed / and so the town was saved / and he dyed the
day before the kalendas of Septembre the year of Grace.vi. hundred and.li. and
was buried a little fro the said City / And now part of his relykys be at
Duresme and part be had into Scotland / and twyse the house wherein he dyed /

street were burned / and venerable bede yt wrote his life seyth of him that he
was a great lover of peace / and charity and was an ouercomer of Ire and
couetyse / a dispyser of vaynglory / a reprouer of proud men / and a comforter
of syckemen and poor men / and that as far as he could learn this blessed
man omytted nothing (...) he learned by ye euangelystys or prophyttys to be
(...) fulfyllyd it in that he could / how be it in yt he kept (...) Estre at
the due time / Bid prayseth him not / (...) prayseth him for he seyth percase
he knew it not (...) kept it on a sunday / but he praysyth him that
(...)pynge of his Ester / he believed / nor worsh(...) other thing but as we
do / that is to say the Redemption of mankind by the Passion / Resurreccyon /
and Asse^cyon of the medyator betwixt God and Man / our Lord Ihesu Criste /
And in the lyfes of Saint Oswalde / and Oswyn kings / And of Saint Cuthbert
diverse things things be spokyn of this Blessed man.

De sancto Albano martire.
Saint Albon dwelled i^ the Town of verolame that now is called saint Albons /
And in the time of ye persecucyo^ of dioclesyan saint Amphibell came into
Brytayne and lodged in the house of saint Albon / and exortyd him to be
converted / And showed him sumwhat of the believe of our lord / and he gave
little credence to his techynge / And the same night saint Albon saw a vision
yt betokened the Misteryes of ye Incarnaciou / Passion / Resurreccion / and
Assencion of our Lord as in the Legende apperyth / And in the morning he
asked of saint Amphibell what his visyo^ betokened / and when saint Amphibell
had declared the hole misteryes thereof how our Lord suffered Passion and Death /
And how he Rose again and assendyd to Heuyn / he said it was all true that he
said / And anon he Believed / and was Cristened / And then he was complaynyd
on that he was Cristened / Wherefore he was sent for / and was Takyn as he was
prayenge before a Cross / And so he was brought to the Judge / And there

and they Refused / and whenne Saint Augustyne had helyd a blind Man in
proving that their Tradycyons were not good / yet they took longer respyte to

saint Augustyne rose not to them when they came which they Judged to be of
pride / and many of the famous monasterye of Ba^gor wherein were.xxi. hundred

De sancto hugone ep^o and confessore.
Saint hugh when he was but.viii. year old was set to Reguler discyplyne and
was ever brought up in vtue / he never knew pleasurys of ye World nor lernyd
any manner of disportes / after he was made a Chanon regler in a monastery in
Gra^miople where his fader lived under reguler discipline: and as long as his
fader lived he wiped his shone and made his bed and was dylygent to him in
all other things / and after for zele of a streyghter Religion he entered into
relygio^ in ye order of Chartuc and there he was made pressed And when he was at
Mass he ordered himself as if our lord had been visibly there present / and he
used much vigylles fastings and scorgynges often fasted bread and water / and
weer the here as the use of the Relygion is and after when he was made
proctour he thought in his sleep that he that made him pressed came to him and
opened his belly with a Raser and cut fro him a thing like a bylle of fire and
he never after felt temptacion of the flesh / but that he might lightly
despise / After by desire of king Henry the second he was sent into England
to be Pryor of Wythm^ though he much refused it and on a time when he came to
the king for certain things that they neded / and the king gave him little
comfort but fair words / one Gerarde that came with saint Hugh^ said to the
king that he would go home again into his Country / and told the king that
he saw well that all that he gave for his soul health he thought it lost / and
saint Hughe bad him leave such words or hold his peace / and then he spoke to
the king in such sobre and charytable manner yt when he had done the king
enbraced him and said verayly he should never go from him / but yt he would keep
him and take counsel of him for the health of his soul / and anon he gave to
saint Hughe all that he asked / one a time when the king was in great perell
of the sea / he had great trust in ye prayer of saint Hughe and of his
brethren / and as it is said he aduowed that if he came safe to land he would
make him a bishop and forthwith the tempest ceasyd when the building was done
at Wytham he would ever be occupied in prayer redynge medytacyon or in some
spirituell collacion or exortacion / he would never lie in his bed waking
but either rise and go to prayer or i^mediatly sleep again / and when ye
bishop of Lyncoln^ was translated to Rome saint Hughe was elected thereto / And
he said he would in no wise take it upon him without assent of the hedde house /
and when that was opteyned he would not yet agree till he was aserteyned of the
hole assent of all the Chanons of Lyncoln^ / and then the Dean of Lyncoln^ and
the chyef of the Chapter came to him to wytham / and when they had herd him
speak they all desired him with great i^staunce and deuoco^n to take it upon
him / and then he assented ye first night that he came into his Bysshopryche
he hard a voice say to him in his sleep Egressus es i^salute^ ppli tui in
salutem cu^ xp^o tuo: And after saint Hughe accursed ye kings chyef Forster
for doing against the lyberte of ye church / wherefore ye king took great
displesure and that matter not yet determined the king desired of him for one
of his clerks the noi^acion of a Benefyce that was then void and in the gift
of saint Hughe and he denied it / wherefore the king was more angry and sent
for him / and when he came he found the king sitting among his lords and
the king would not suffer any of them to rise to him / and yet nevertheless
when he had hard his answers and his sayings ye king was contented / and
when he deperted committed him to his prayers and every year ones or twyse he
would be at wytham and keep his sell / and sometime when he came forth by reason
of ye famylyer speaking with our lord he had two bright beams came fro his face
/ a voice bad a clerk three times yt he should go to the bishop of Lyncoln^
and bid him speak to the Archebysshop of Canterbury that tharchebysshop
together with him should more dilygently help to reform ye clergy for our
lord was greatly displeased with them Curates were made yt were unable / and
benesyces were set to ferme for temporal profit nothing regarding the health
of the souls / ne yet the comfort of pore men / And when ye clerk made doubt
how the bishop should believe him because of his youth the voice said when he
had showed to the bishop that / that he should se before the Bishop as he was
at Mass he should believe him: And so he went and did his message / and as the
bishop was at Mass he saw the Host when it was lift up bytwyxt the
bysshoppes hands turned into the very body of our lord Ihu^ criste / and it
was like a little child more beauteous then man can tell / and when he had
showed this to the bishop he bad him keep it close and aduertysed him that he
that had seen such things should never busye himself in the world / but that
he should enter into Relygyo^ and so he did and lived a blessed life when king
Richard went into France to war upon the French king / saint Hughe and
the bishop of Salysbury denied to give any thing to the King for they said
they were not bound to help him / but oonly within the Realm / wherefore the
King was meruaylously angry and commanded to sease all that they had / But
there durst no man medell with saint Hughe for fere of the punysshement of
god / then afterward he went over the Sea to the king / and when he came
before the kings presence where he was at Mass / the king looked upon him
with an Angry countenance / and would not speak to him and then he went to
the king and took him about the neck / and had him kiss him for he said
he had deseruyd it / and the king meruaylynge his constaunce smyled and kyssed
him: And at that mass time the king perceived right well that he was a holy
man and when an Archebysshop kyssed the king for the pax the king rose and
kyssed saint Hughe / And after mass he admonysshed the king that he should take heed to the health of his soul and how he did inwardly / And when ye king
told him that he thought his conscyens was clear / but it were for hatred to
his enemies / he said there was a common saying that he kept not his wedlock
and also that he took not head to make good curates / and when he had
admonysshed the king of diverse things he gave the king his blessing and so
departed / and when he was goon the king said that if there were many such
Bysshoppes there durst no prince do against them: And when the king shortly
after had a great victory of the French king he arected it to the prayers of
saint Hugh / he helyd two persons yt were obsessed with deuylles after he fell
syke of a grievous Axes / and when he should be houseled he went bare foot in a
here with a Coule and met the sacrament / and made long prayer and among
other things he said that for love dread or hatered / or for any other cause
he never wyttyngly went fro the truth / And in the year of our Lord god.M.CC.
and syx in the octaues of saint Martyn ye Bishop he went to our lord / as he
was in caryinge to Lyncoln^ four tapres burned contynually by the way that
never went out / At bykleswade by his merytes a man was made hole that had
broken his arm / and at staumforde a cordoner which had great devotion to
saint Hughe bysought almighty god that he might dye and go to heuyn with him /
and so being confessyd and howselyd he dyed fourth with and saint Hughe was
carried fourth to Lyncoln^ and was there buried honorably.

/ and when one of the company meruayled thereat he said it was not best where
was to great a fire to ley to more styckes / but he said by good dylyberacion

to do great wrong to his Monasterye that he should beware yt for his masters
pleasure he went not himself to hell and tho words took sueffecte in that
man that in the morning he said while he lived he would be a friend to the
house / and so his mind changed and the varyaunce ceased / our Lord showed
for him many miracles he appeared to men in the sea that were in perell and
saved them in like manner as it is read of saint Nicholas / and they after
knew him by the Fygoure that appeared to them in the sea / By his prayer a

De sancta Keyna virgin.
Saint Keyne virgyne was daughter to the king of Breghenoke in the West part
of great Brytayne and nygh of kyn to saint David / and awnte to saint Cadoke /
when her mother was with child with her she saw in vision her bosom full of
myrre and balm / and her tetes shynynge of a heavenly light and she thought
that instead of a child she was delivered of a fair wight / and when she was
first borne her face was sometime white like snow / sometime bright shynynge
like the son at her years of marriage she forsook all marriages aduowynge to
keep virginite / and lived in a desert beyond seuerne / where by her prayers
serpents that before yt time had made the country Inhabitable turned into
stones seint Keyne made many orators and after she went to saint Myhellis
mount and there she met with saint Cadoke / and by monicion of an Angel she
went into her country again and dwelled at the foot of a Hylle / where by her
prayers sprange a fair well whereby many have been helyd / she saw in her sleep
a beam of fire descend there where as she lay on a bare pauime^t with grene
bows under her and two aungelles appeared unto her and one of them Reverently
did of a here that she had used to weer and appareylled her with goodly
apparel / and bad her be redye to go with them into ye kingdom of her fader /
and when she gladly would have followed them she awoke felyng her self seek of
the Axes / and then she called saint Cadoke to her and told him she would be
buried in that same place / which she said she would in spirit often vysyte /
before her death she saw a great company of Aungelles ready to take her soul
with great Joy without feere or parell / and when she had told them that
stood about her thereof she departed the.viii. Idus of Octobre / and anon her
face was of a color like red roses and a sweet savor was about her that all
that were there thought it like a Joy of Paradyse / and saint Cadoke buried
her in her oratorye where she had lived a hard and a blessed life many years.

De sancto Kynedo confessore.
THe fader and mother of saint Kynede were of little Brytayne / but seint Kyned
was borne in great Brytayne in the time when king Arthur reigned and his life
is so full of the meruaylous great power and goodness of almighty god that I
leave to write of it in this little kalendre / and refer it to them yt list to
read the hole Legend how he was immediately after his birth cast into the
water preserved in a little crybbe in the great wawes of the sea / and was
taken up out of the sea by birds and in his youth did souke on a belle that
had a little thing like to a tete / which sauoured to him of diverse manners as
Manna did to the children of Israel: and how he had not the fylth yt other
children naturally have / and how a man and his wife found him and brought him
to their house / wherefore ye birds destroyed their house and their bestes so
yt they were feign to bear him again / how he was aft fed with a hynde yt filled
ye said belly with her milk / and how an angel apperyd often to him and told
him what mete he should use and that the harder that it was the better it was
for him / And how he went fro that place by monycion of an Angel after he
had kept an Heremytes life there.xviii. years / and how his servant forsware
him self upon the bell whereupon he went mad and went upon the water to saint
Dauides then called Meniuia where he lived like a be.vii. year with herbs
and rotes his here covering him like a be which after by prayers of saint
Kyned was made hole again and many other things appear in the Legende /
which be here omytted he went to our lord in the kalend of August.

De sancto Kenelmo Rege and martire.
IN the year of our Lord god Eight hundred and xix. Kenulphus king of Mershes
forsook the world and left his sone Kenelmus a young child to be king after
him and when his suster Quendreda / which was desirous to Reygne could not by
any means poison him she enduced Aschebercus that had ye rule of him by great
rewards and by promise that he should be fellow with her in the rule of the
Realm to assent to kill him and so he led ye young king yet being of.vii.
years of age into a wodde as for disporte of hunting / and as the child slept
his ruler made a pytte to burye him in: and when the child awoke he told him
he should not lie there but in a place ferther of / and that he should se that it
was true that he said he struck his staff into the ground which anon grew
/ and after sprange thereof a fair Asshe that is called saint Kenelmys asshe /
Then ye cursid man had him into a deep valey in the wodde called Clent / and
there as it is said the young king said Tedeu^ / and when he came to the verse.
Temartyrum candidatus etc. The cursyd man under a thorn struck of his head /
and there buried him and oftymes a bright beam was seen descend upon ye place
where he lay at which place a Cow vsyd oftymes to be / and could not be kept
away frothens / and when she came home she gauerwyse asmoche milk / as any of
the other / after his death Quendreda took the rule upon her / and then no man
durst speak of the young king nor seek him for fere of quendreda till a byll
was brought by a dove to the pope Leo as he was at mass at rome of this effect
i^ English In clent in Cowbach under a thorn lies king Kenelme his hedde of
shorn / and so the pope sent Legates and Cardynalles to wylfryde bishop of
Caunterbury and other bysshoppes of England yt they should remove him and so he
was taken up and there as he lay sprang up of fair well / and as his suster
looked out of a wyndowe upon a sawter book to have by enchauntement let his
buryenge suddenly her iyen fell upon the book which book is yet to show / and
there she dyed myserably: one that was blind and a another dombe fro their
Natyuyte by merytes of saint Kenelme were made hole / and he lies at

put her into the sea in a little ship of lether without ore wheri^ she was
brought to land more swyftly then a sail could have driven her and i^ a
place called Collenrose she was delivered without help / and the same time of
her delyueraunce saint Sarnan hard aungelles sing in the Air / wherefore in
the morning he went thither and found the mother with the child whom he
brought to his house / and cristened them both and there the child profyted
much in learning and virtue so that saint Sarnan loved him most of all his
disciples wherefore his Fellows enuyed him in somoch that they killed a bird
that saint sarnan louyd and leyd it by assent to Kentegern^ / and he making a
Cross upon the bird raised it again to life / he raised also saint Sarnans
Coke fro death to life / which he was exorted to do by saint Sarnan by
instygacion of his enemies / and yet always his good and virtuous life was a
norysshynge of more envy to his enemies / wherefore he left that place and
went to a place called Glascu / and in ye way he went through the water of
Mallena that divided to him like as did the red see to ye children of Israel.
at Glascu he lived in great abstynence / and was there made bishop / and he

and every Lent he went to some deserte place and lived there with herbs and
rotes / and sometime by especyall grace he fasted all the Lent / he used oftymes
to stand in cold water till he had said the hole Psaulter / In his Iugementes
he always considered the matter and not the person / he made an Abbey wherein
were.ix.C. and.lxv. monks which he divided in three pertes so yt always some
were in the Quere / when he was at dyuyne service sometime a white dove /
sometime a bright beam where seen descend upon him / on sher thursday he would
wasshe the fete of pore men and lepoures and kiss them / he converted much
people to the faith in his Dioc / he destroyed Idolles and made churches and

and diverse of his brethren went in to the same water as he appointed them to
do / and they dyed forth with without pain and went with him into the

Saint Pattern was borne in little Brytayne / and he left his erthly
enherytaunce coueytynge to be hyer of the kingdom of heuyn / and heryng of his
mother that his fader had forsaken his own country and lived a blessed life in
Irlande he purposed to go to him / and.viii.C.xlvii. monks in tho days
purposynge to leave little brytayne and to come into great Brytayne followed him
chewsyng him to be their leder / and so they came into great brytayne where he
made a Monastery in a place called Mauritania / And leuyng his brethren he
went into Irlande to his Fader / where by oonly sight of him two kings and
their hosts were accorded that before were in great malice prepared to
battle: then he returned into brytayne to his brethren and there he found a
brother that he left behind him in little brytayne which could not live
without him wherefore in trust in our lord and in the virtue of saint Pattern
he came out of little bratyne upon a stone that Rose fro the bottom of the sea
sauffe to the said Monastery / Saint david / saint Pattern / and saint Telam by
monycion of an Angel went to Iherusalem. And there they preched none like
them sith the Apostellys and the holy ghost so werked in them that every man
understood in them his own speech as they did of the appostellys and there
they were made bysshoppes by the Patryarch and there was given in reward to
saint Patron a Cote wrought with gold and a staff and after they returned
into Wales deuydynge the country into three Bysshoprykes / A king in wales
called Carodancus subdued little brytayne / and there ye people showed to him
that / but he sent for seint Pattern they could not be contented to be subject
to him / and then the king went over to him and desired him to come thither for
instructyng of the people and so he went where he suffered great perfeccyon
pacyently. When Sampson bishop of that prouynce a holy man went about his
diocyse to gather a certain trybute and came by Cite nygh whereunto seint
Pattern had builded a Monastery one of the monks of the bishop cou^ceyled him
that for proving of the humylyte of the holy man yt came late out of brytayne
he should send for him / and that the messenger should bring him in the same
estate that he found him and the bishop taking the counsel simple sent
forth a messenger and he found him with his one hose on / and the other of /
and when he had told his message saint Pattern knowing what was to come went
with him / and when he came before the bishop the monk that gave the
counseyll laughed at him and forthwith he was taken with a devil and fell to
the ground / then the bishop Sampson perceyuyng that the monk was the cause
of that temptacion asked for gyuenes for him / whereupon saint Pattern drove
away ye devil and made him hole / wherefore the bishop discharged him of all
such paymentes / After at a synod saint Pattern had great trowble of some
that enuyed him / and at last a full peace was made and yet ferynge that
suffraunce might provoke Ire or hurt his humylyte he left that country / and
went in to France where he slepte in our lord the.xvii. Kalend of Maii. Three
years after his death fell no rain or dew in yt country / wherefore the people
reme^brynge yt saint Pattern went out of the country for iniuryes done unto him
by a hole assent went into France to fet his body* and when they could
nothing get / but oonly a bone of one of his arms / yet all their company
could not remove it / wherefore they were meruaylously troubled. Then a noble
man of the cite of Guenet said yt saint Pattern in his life had asked of him
oftentimes a ground to make a Church in / and yt he would not grant it: but
now he was contented / and that said they took the bone lightly and bare it
with them to ye said Cite yt was his bysshoppes see / and there it lies in a
church made in the ground of the said nobleman In his life one of his
servants* yt went to over se ye woddes was killed with theuys and byheded /
wherefore saint Pattern heryng thereof went to the wodde and called ye servant
by his name and asked where he was / and he answered here I am / and then he
went to the place there as he hard hy^ speak and leying ye head and ye body
together lyftyng his ^yen into heuyn he blessed ye deed body / and forthwith he
rose up hole / And thereupon a mighty man in that country came to the bishop
and said they were his mynystres that did it and ferynge that the vengeance of
god would prevent him asked mercy and gave him a part of the groun- and he
benyngly forgave hy^ seying to him yt before his dethde he should please our

De sancto Patricio Ep^o and confessore.
Saint Patrike was borne in Brytayne now called England / and in his youth he
was taken prisoner / and was put to kepeswyne / and a.C. times in the day /
and as many times in the night he prayed after by an Angel he was showed that
he should find a certain thing there as a hog Roted which he should take to
pay his Rraunson / and so he was delivered out of bondage as he was going home
by his prayer his fellows found mete yt had been long without / and be
ra^ted.xxx. days by cause his company offered all their mete to their Idolles
as he slept the devil tempted him strongly and lay upon him three days and
three nyghtper like a stone ye he could not remove / and then he cried hely
help twyse / and hely came and delivered him then ye devil said that after
that day he should have no power ouerhym / And our lord put fro him all
torpoure and heaviness / and his strength clearly restored again unto him. In
his sleep he thought that one brought him a letter and in the beginning was
written her est vox hi^bmensiu^. And as he was redyng of it in the same moment
he hard a voice of many I^fau^tes of diverse Countrees in Irlande saying we
pray the Father that thou come and walk among us / and then he thought it
was the will of god that he should preche in that country. Thereupon because he
would learn scripture he went to the bishop of Antisiodorense and was with
him.xl. years redynge and fulfyllynge holy scripture / after he was with saint
Martyne.xl. days / and of a holy Heremyte he had a staff that our lord had in
his own hand which is called ye staff of Ihesu / and this day the staff
remains in his Cite in Irlande and of a bishop called Amotus he was made
Bishop / and so he went to Rome where he was in great favor with the Pope
Celestyn: and he sent him into Irla^de to co^uerte the people there to the
faith / in the year of our Lord. CCCC xxv. And when he came to the sea a
lepour desired to go over with him and his company would not assent / wherefore
saint Patryke threw his Altar into the sea / and the Lepour sitting thereupon
followed the ship till they came in to the Country of Lagyne / Then he went into
the country of Anathaylt where the people would not receive him / wherefore the sea destroyed all the country. Then he went into the North perte of Irlande to
ye man where he was in bondage / and there he saw much people abiding his
coming for they had herd by prophets that such a man should come / and yet
the king Loegar^ commanded them to put him away and when a fyers dog was
turned to him to have devoured him he was anon made immovable like a stone.
The^ a gyaunt would have killed him which also was made immovable and by the
p^chynge of saint Patryke was converted / Then the gyauntes brother that was a
man of great age / which was called Russeynge his brother converted faught
against saint Partryke and he asked him what he meant of yt age to dispose him
to fight and asked him whether he would believe if he made him young again and
he said ye / then saint Patrike put him to prayer and anon he was made in yt
state of a fair young man / wherefore he and his sons and many other were
cristened / and then Patrike asked of him whether he would live any longer in
this world or straight way to go to heuyn and he desired to go to heuyn / and
so he received ye sacrament and went to our lord / As he was saying Mass a
wytche cast down his Chalys and forth with the ground opened and Swalowed
him up / A great tyrant called Magnil and his company Feyned one to be deed
that saint Patryke attempt to reyse him / and so to be deceived / and when they
saw that he was deed in deed they said among them self verayly this is the
man of god / and anon Magnil was converted and baptized and was ready to take
penance / and then saint Patrike said that he could not Judge him / but god
should Judge him / nevertheless he had him go to the sea taking nothing with
him / but a vile vestement and there to goo i^to a ship of one skyn without
guide or ore / and that he fetter his legs together and throw ye kney into
the sea / and to what place souer the wind brought him there to serve god /
and when he had promised to do it saint Patryke areysed ye man that was deed
and ye same day he went to ye see as he was bydden and came into an I Will called
Manna^ where he found two holy Bishops / and they meruaylynge had pity on
him and took him up gladly / and he taryred with them there and after was made
a bishop and was a great man in that country / where there is a cite called
the cite of Magnil the bishop to this day. Our lord was with him in all yt he
went about he was a great confounder of Enchauntours / and by his prayers he
put away snowes and derkenes that they had made suddenly by help of the
devil / land one yt was much malycyous to him was suddenly lyfted up into the
Air and let fall again / whereof he dyed myserably and an Erthquake suddenly
came and fered a king yt meynteined ye said Enchau^tour / whereby the king
came to repentance He raised a man to life that had been deed.x. years. This
was his daily life he said every day the Psaulter with.CC. prayers and daily said
mass he taught disciples p^ched to the people and every hour he marked
himself with a. C. crosses In the beginning of the night he said.CC. psalms
and CC. times he knelyd / and fro the Cokkes crowyng he stood in water till he
had said his prayers. Then he took sleep lyeng upon a bare stone and a another
under his hedde. Often times he saw heuyn open / and our lord Ihesu stondyng
with his Aungellys in heuyn / wherefore his heart always brenned in an vncomperable
fire of the love of god / He was a Clean and irgyne in body and spirit / and
he changed this life the.xvi Kale^dr of Apryl / And after one oppynion he was
buried in the Cite of Dimense in Irlande / but in the latter end of ye Legende
it is said yt after he had converted Irla^de he came into ye I Will of Aualony and

felaushyp of aungellys and other seyntys / and holy virgyns / so that nothing
was to them heavy or peynfull / in so much that diverse matrones in their
Felaushyp hauyuge your Chylderne in their Arms went as lyghtlye / and as
easily as did the other which bare none / and the said young babes and
Chylderne were as well comfortyd by vysyon of Aungellys and other sayntys as
other were / and made thereof many euydent signs of Joy and gladness in their
manner as they could and ferdermore these Innocentys / and (...) Chylderne
neither greuyd nor noyed their kepers / nor yet lettyd them by soukynge upon
them as they were wont to do / but thrughe the grace / and largess of
^^^yghtye god / they put their fyngers in their own Mowthes and sowkyd out
there full sweet and delycate nourysshyngs wherwyth they were full well fed
and sustained / (...) over they never wet their self with their vryne nor
other wise after the manner as chylderne by course of nature be defould but ever
p^^re and clean as they that were fed with Au^gellys food / in this holy and
merry pilgrimage all thing succedyd prosperously better than they could
thin^ke or desire / for if they disposyd them at morning ^o lodge at such a
city / or place / at night they came thither with case at their pleasure never
lesynge their wey and wheresoever they came in country / or City they
encreasyd in number / for many persons both Kings / Busshoppes / Princes /
Dukys and many other nobles / matrones / and vyrgyns which c^sortyd to them
to behold so wonderful a spectacle seeing and co^syderynge how almighty god
wrought in them / and that it could not be otherwise but by his grace / and
goodness left their Countries / Londys / and goodys / dygnytes and all other
frendys and I^ynyd them in felawshyp with these holy virgyns in hope / and
trust to be parteners with them of their glorious Thryumphe and vyctorye / And
so it was done / for they all suffryd martyrdom with them / Also in this
blessed Pilgrimage Rain / ne dew noyed them / nor any evil Felawshyp nyghed
to them / they were so well / and tenderlye kept / and defendyd by guard or
keeping sent from above high Hyllys / and mou^taynys whereof some semyd
impossyble to pass ascape were to them like easy as plain and feyre ways or
pathis the straight ways noyed them nor tarried them nothing but they passyd
all lyghtlye and easly / Also their apparayle and Clothys were not enpeyryd nor
in any thing yt worse for this Journey little corporal mete served them they
were so well fed and so delycatlye fulfyllyd wtinforth i^ ye souls but it
was rather tedious and grievous to the^ to take it / at Rome certain of these
vgins which were yet vncristenyd were baptized of the holy pope Cyryacus which
Cyryacus warnyd by an Angel left his (...) and all his dygnyte and went to
Coleyne with these by vyrgyns to be partener of their reward / and so did a
holy man called Cesaryus the Busshope of Basyle beforesayde / And at the City
of Magunce / going from Basyle to Coleyne met with them the foresaid noble
prince Olyfernes the spouse of the blessed Uirgyn vrsula with his mother / and
diverse other persons which were Crystenyd / and so went fourth with them to
Coleyne desiring to be parteners with them as well of their labor and Pain
/ as of their Reward and mede / And when they came to Coleyne they found it
besette with the cruel bardaryes / And the Prince and Capytayne of them
seeing this great multitude of virgyns merueylynge much thereat commaundyd
hastily that they should be brought and presentyd before him / and so they
were / And after many questyons / He beholdynge the foresaid Blessed vyrgyn
Ursula admerueylynge her great bautye / her sober and stable countenance / and
steadfast mind / anon was takyn and Rauysshyd in the love of her / but all
that was in vain for neither for his feyre words / and great behestys / ne
yet for his cruel thretenynges she ^^lynyd nothing / nor in any wise assentyd
to him / but stedfastlye / and with bold countenance despysyd him / not
desiring his favor / nor dredynge his malice / wherefore the cruel tyrant
much greuyd and anoyed seeing that he could in nothing prevail by fair
meanys / ne yet by foul caused to be Slain and martyred before her face many
vyrgyns and other of her company among whom was the noble prince Olyfernes
her own spouse before said thinking thereby to peruerte her / But for all
this she was nothing mouyd / nor chau^gyd any countenance but as she which
desired to be with her very spouse christ Jesus not only feryd not death / but
also affectuouslye desired it / and longyd sore in her heart for it knowing
for certain thereby to come to her purpose and her hearts desire / wherefore the
said Tyraunte seeing that she would not in any thing enclyne unto him after
all her company caused her to be slain and martyryd right cruelly There might
a man have seen much tyranny exercysyd by these bochers which as wood dogs
/ or wolfes thrustynge Innocent blood without pytye / or mercy deuoury / and
slew all these Holy vyrgyns with all their company in a rage / and furye and
cut their Bodies into small pecys / and cast and sparkelyd them over all
about the field / and among them were Clayne young Chylderne in their
moders wombes / and as it was showed by reuelacyon they were also receyuyd to
the everlasting life / and parteners with their moders of the Reward of
martyrdom as Baptyzyd in ye Blood of their Moders which were slain for crystys
sake / for otherwise they could not have been sauyd / In the which we may see
the great and Infynyte goodness / and merciful py^^ of our Lord that sows /
and so largely spredyth his mercy / Also these In^au^tys with many other
persons Men / Women / and Chylderne were not accomptyd in ye nombre of
the.xi.M. vyrgyns but were besides them to the nombre of.CCCCC. and above as it
apperyth in y^ hystorye of them in the legende / Also in y^ nombre of the xi.
thousand by vyrgyns was noon ^l^^te / but if she (...)ry pure and chaste for
other which (...) virgyns and were noon through the (...) of almyghtye god to
whom nothing is (...) were put out and not chosen / after the death of these
holy vyrgyne Inmedyatlye al^yghty god not suffrynge these cruel Tyrauntys to
goo all quyte without taking vengeance of the Blood of his holy virgyns which
was shed for his love sent and put into them such a ^eer yt with all their
might they fl^dde and ran away glad to escape with their lyues^ for as them
thought they saw coming upon them to persecute them / such a company and
so great a multitude of armyd men so terrybly that they thought never to have
escaped / and so they fled i^ all haste yt they might where thrughe the woeful
prisoners and all desolute the Cytezyns of Coleyne which had long tym^ be
holden and kept thrall and in dyspayre of life seeing their enemies chasyd and
fled away opened their Gates and went fourth all Joyful and glad of their
sodeyne delyuerau^ce / and co^syderynge this to be the hand of god thrughe the
merytes of thise holy virgyns which they saw lie in the field slain by their
enemies full dylygently gathered the bodies of them togeder / which were full
^yde ca^^ and sparkelyd in pecys and with great honor and reverence buried
them / and unto this day there dare noon burye any other Body within the
co^pass^ wh^t^ they ben buried / which miracle suffyseth to declare and make
open how dear and acceptable these holy and blessed vgyns were to almighty
god and many other miracles appear in the hystory which I omytte for shortness
/ Also saint Elyzabeth that holy vyrgyn in her reuel^cio^s spekyth much of
these holy vgyns which for ye cause before said I leave to speak of / after in
process of time men being forgetful by dulnes of wit / cold anf dry (...)
to believe thyngys which they see not / nor cannot co^prehe^de by their blind
Reason / by their neclygens put these holy virgyns utterly in oblyuyon /
wherefore our lord not sufferyng his deer beloved vgyns so to be forgotten to
his honor and praysynge pryncipally and to the honor of the said glorious
virgyns and also for our socoure / and help many yerys after the passion of
them showed by reuelacyon the foresaid hyst^^ye to him that was the writer and
maker thereof / and furthermore the said blessed saint Ursula diverse other of
the said virgyns apperyd unto him as he was writing thereof affermynge it to
be true as apperyth more at large in ye said legende / there was of the same
company of Blessed virgyns one virgyn called Cordula the which when the other
virgyns were in their martyrdoms hyd hyrselfe all night in the bottom of a
ship / and nevertheless in the morning she offeryd her self freely to death
and as the other vgyns did receyuyd the Crown of martyrdom / and it is not
for any man to think that this Blessed virgyn by yt little fear any thing
hyndred her reward / or Crown of martyrdom when neither Peter denyinge our
Lord / nor Thomas doubting of the resurreccion were a^^^^^ fro the honor to
be Apostyll / And parcase this Blessed Uyrgyne somewhat had presumed by the
purpce of her Life and constaunce of her feyth to put a trust in her self
to suffer Martyrdom so that it was expedyent for her to be m^ked or to learn
to trust in our Lord and not in her self / After many yerys this blessed
virgin Cordula apperyd unto a holy woman called Hellent^ude being and recluse
seyinge unto her I am oon of those blessed virgyns that suffered martyrdom at
Coleyne and lyuyd one night after them / and in ye morning offered my self
gladly unto ye death and so dyinge in our lord I neither left ye company of my
susters ne yet lackyd like reward as they had of ye crown of martyrdom /
wherefore I woll yt thou shalt in my name command the susters that the next
day after yt they shall have served all the hoole company of the said
blessed virgyns that they do some thing to my honor for it is not expedyent
for them that I only be left vnhonouryd among that company / And then the
^eclu^e asked of her what was her name / she bade he look in her forhed what
she saw written there and she lokynge up saw written dystructlye Cordula
whereupon she made relacyon to the Nounes thereof / wherefore in the day
following they hallowed her feast according to the said commandment / a
certain Abbot desired of the abbey of Coleyne ye body of one of those virgyns
promising that he would set her in his Church in a Coffer of silver / And
when he had kept her a hoole year upon the Altar in a Coffer of wood / in a
night as the abbot and covent were (...) matens they saw the said vyrgyn
descend upon the Altar and going down she ^^wyd her (...) to the (...) /
and went thr^ghe the quere yt all the brethe (...) we / and so she departed
wherop^n yt (...) went to the Coffer and finding nothing therein went to the
Abbess of Coleyne and showed he^ then of^ And then they went to the place
fro whens the B^dye was taken and there they found it again / wherfor^ lawght
at it And as he was going to drive a way ye hyndes he fell fro his Horse and
streyghtwaye dyed / After full of good werkys and good exaumples she went to
our Lord and was buried at dereham / After that monastery was destroyed by
Danes / and now there is a parysshe Church And in the year of our
Lord.ix.C.lxxiiii. in the time of King Edgar her Body was translatyd to Ely
which was then newely repayryd by saint Ethelwolde / and all the wey in the
Nyghtys a bright sterre folowyd the Body nyghe all the night long / and in ye
year of our Lord a.M. and.xxvi. her Body was removed by Richard the last
Abbot to the Place where it lies now / And the Body and also the clothes
were found incorrupt / A munke towchyd her Body and found it flexyble and
her chekys rodye as roses like as she had been a live.

De sancta Ursula et vndecim milibus virginu^ martiribus.
THere was in much Brytayne now called England a Christian King which had
a noble and a vertuose Queen to his wife and they lived long togeder without
any child / wherefore they were right heavy and at ye last thorough contynuell
prayers / and good werkys they opteynyd of almighty god to have a daughter whom
they crystenyd and named vrsula and norysshed / and brought her up in ye feythe
of our lord full vertuosly and gracyously with all their might and cunning
which encreasyd so meruaylously in all virtue and grace and thereto was so
feyre that the fame of her was in short time spronge over all into many
Countries and Lands so far that it came to knowledge of a certain King heynge
a Paynym / but he was very mighty and of great power and thereto very Hard
and cruel / but ye Queen his Wife was right noble in all her behauyoure
Courteys and Gentle / and of every person bylouyd / This King had a young
sone called Olyfernes Right lowly / and Courteys / and they herynge of this
Fair and virtuous young Lady vrsula desired much in their hattys to have her
to their sone in marriage / And anon sent messengers with letters full
pleasant to the King her Fader / and to the Queen her mother promising great
gyftys and rewardys if they would assente and furthermore right hard / and
sharp thretenyngys if they would not agree thereto / By reason whereof the said
King her Fader was in great Sorrow / and Heaviness co^syderynge the might / and
power of this other king / and thereto how hard / and cruel he was and also
yt he was an Infydell / wherefore he was right loathe to mary his Daughter to ye
said Kyngys sone / and also of the other side he knew for certain that though
he would agree / yet she would not but rather suffer death she was so steadfast
in the feythe relygyous and chaste / and thus he being in great perplexyte and
doutfull peril / the foresaid Blessed vyrgyne his Donghter was warnyd by an
Angel that she should goo to her Fader and bydde him agree to the other
Kyngys request and desire / and that she should assent thereto / and so should
she comfort and assure her Fader and peacyfye and make glad the other part /
Nevertheless the abbot asked forgynes / and desired that he might have again
that Body / or a noder promising certeynlye that he would put it in a goodlye
coffer which he could in no wise opteyne.

De sancta Wlfhilda virgin.
THe great graundefader of saint Wlfhyde was found in an Egles neest by
Alfryde king of weste saxons which Crystenyd him / and called him nestynge
because he was takyn out of a nest who^ he brought up nobly / and made him earl
/ He had Issu witburdynge which had Issu wlfhelme fader to saint wlfhylde which
with his wife after they had diverse Chylderne lyuyd chaste.xviii. yerys / and
then by monycyon of an Angel they knew ye will of god / and had a daughter
who^ they called wlfhylde / and co^myttyd her to the nonnes at Wylton to bring
up / king edgare in process of time would have married her / and when he
could by no meanys have her assent / ne yet have her to come speak with him
and that he durst not take her out of the Church / he took counceyll of her
Aunte called wenflede / which being desirous to have her nese exaltyd /
dyssymylyd her self to be syke / and so the Blessed vyrgyne came to wharwelle
to vyset her Aunte where she found her not syke but sitting at dinner with the
King in great Royalte / And anon the vyrgyn was apparayled in goodlye apparel
/ and the King made her to sytte between ehym and her Aunte promising her
great Riches / and to be Lady of Brytayne / which in her Heart she abhorryd
though she said it not with her mouth / And dyssymylynge her self to be syke
would ete no mete alweyes thinking how she might escape / which the King
perceived and appoyntyd certain knyghtys to keep her both within the house and
with out / and after with her to maidens she went into a secret house / and
did of her pompyous ornamentys and by a little hole an Angel being her guide
/ she escapyd / and like a poor woman came into a pore woman's house in
wharwell / and all that night she was sought by the kings seruau^tys and
could not be found / and in the morning she went to wylton whyther the King
folowyd and attemptyd all that he could to have her speak with him / and
could not till it happened him to mete her in the cloister whereof he was very
glad / and took her by the sleue and she anon pullyd away her arm / and ye
clothe remaynyd still in the Kings hand more easily seueryd then if it had been cut of / and so she went straight to the high Altar and committed her
virgynyte to our Lord / and the King astonyed at the seuerynge of the sleue /
and a shamyd of his presumpcyon thought that it should betokyn / that she the
spouse of our Lord should be clearly seueryd fro him wherefore he went to her
and bade her not feer for he would no more let her porpose but rather be a
helper of it / whereupon he gave her the monasterye of Barkynge / and newly
repayryd it / after of her own patrimony she made a noder at Horton which is
like far / that is to save nyghe about.xii. miles fro Wylton / Shaftesburye
/ Warram / and Hampton / And in every oon of them the King gave her a Church
/ When she was professyd a whyghte Dove was seen destende upon her Hedde /
with the sign of the Cross she helyd a blind Child / And when Saint
Ethelwolde came to her / the Mynystres told her that she lackyd Drink /
Wherefore for gladness of such a geeste she put her trust in our Lord and
the Uessellys mynysshed not / By meanys of the clerkys of Barkynge / the Queen
alstrude mother to king Ethelrede put her out of Barkynge / and the Clerkys
had the rule / and when she went fourth of the gatys she said to the
Susters weeping for her departing that the same day / and i^ the same gate
after.xx. yerys she should come again / and so she went to the Monasterye of
Horton where she encouragyd the susters as well present as absent by Words /
Exaumples / and by Messyngers to the desire of Heuenlye things / aftre the
Queen was Punysshed as well by Death of brute Beestys / as of men / and at the
last she her self fell syke to whom saint Alburghe apperyd in poor
appareyll with a syklye countenance / which she said was long of her
seyinge / she should never be hoole till she brought Saint Wlfhylde again /
And so^ she brought her again the same Day as she had prophesied / after
that she lyuyd.vii. yerys And was Abbess of both Monasteryes of Barkynge /
and Horton / And she said she should dye on saint Ethel woldes even / And so
she dyed at London the.v. I Would of Septembre / As she was in bringing to
Barkynge one that Saint Wlfhylde had reprouyd for his Sin laid hand to
the Beer / And fourth with it was so heavy that it would in no wise be removed
/ And when he was Confessyd / and did Penance he came again and helpyd to
bear the H^rse as other did / In her oratorye at Horton a woman receyuyd her
Syghte / And as she was admonysshyd she went to Barkynge with great dyffyculte
in manner crepynge where she receyuyd perfyght health.

De sancto Wlrico confessore.
Saint wlryke was borne in contane / that is.viii. mile fro Brystolle / and
being a priest he vsyd both Hunting / and Haukynge after he went to
halesberge / that is.xxx. mile fro Oxforde / And there of his own devotion /
he buried himself to our Lord / and so mortyfyed his Flesh with fastyngys /
and vygyllys / that scarcely the skyn might hang to the Bonys / he ete Breed
made of otys / and drank no manner of Wine / nor any thing that might
dystempre / But only on high Festys for reverence of the Feast / On vygyllys
he watchyd all night / oonles that sykenes lettyd him / He slepte in no Bed
but lenynge his Heed to a wall / and when he wakyd forth with he went to
prayer He weer ye Here next his skin / and thereupon an Haberioyne / On a
time when the haberioyne was to long he clyppyd it with sherys as if it had been clothe / In the nyghtys he would goo into a Uessel of Water / and say the
hoole Psalter whereby he mortyfyed the Temptacyons of his Flesh which he
suffered right much / He saw Deuylls sytte in Judgment where they
condempnyd him as one that was in every thing against them / And as they
drew him about the Church our Lady delyueryd him / On a time he bette the
Devil / and would not let him goo till he promised yt he would never come
again / a wretchyd man not berynge his pouerte pacyentlye had done to the
Devil homage / And aftre when he repentyd and was coming toward saint
Wlryke by the way the Devil held him fast at a water side and would not
suffer him go / wherefore saint wlryke knowing it by an Angel bad a priest go
thither and showed him the place where it was / and that he should cast holy
water and bring the man to him / and so it was done when he was brought to him
he took him by the right hand / and the devil held him by the left hand
and plucked at him with all his might / then saint Wlryke cast holy water /
and drove him away with confucyon / After when ye man was confessyd and was
penytent saint Wlryke brought to him the Sacrament / and asked him whether he
byleued and he said ye for he saw the very body and blood of our Lord
bytwyxt his hands / then saint Wlryke thanked our lord and prayer that it
might appear as it did before and so he was co^muned. The devil had power of
the body of saint Wlryke in so much yt he struck him with byles and worms so yt
al his flesh putrefyed / and sometime he stroke him with intolerable hete /
sometime with intolerable cold / which he always overcame with pacyence two times
his Lantern went out and was suddenly lyghted again / when he had helyd a man
yt had the deuylin him he bad him show it to no man / and in his sleep he was
blamed that he would not let the works of god be known / and so after he
would show them oonly to Relygyousmen / Aprees^ called Osborne on a night
saw in ye church a great light that made all the churchyard bright / and in
the morning saint Wlryke asked him what he saw / and when he had told him he
said it is well that thou see it. It was our lord Ihesu that came to comfort
me his servant and I prayed that thou might se it which scarcely I could
opteyne / Moreover he showed him what Psalms he was then saying / and where
he stood at that time / Water with his blessing turned into wine / whereof a
woman that was nyghe deed drauke and forth which was hole / A lady with all her
company that came to vysyte saint Wlryke with one lofe were fully sacyat / and
of the fragmentes a great company of people that came to have his blessing
were also refresshed as it is said above.xl. persons / A young maid that was
syke thought that in her sleep she went to saint Wlryke and that he gave her
holy water in a cup to drink wherewith she was hole / and whenne she wakyd
she was hole in deed and she showed what manner a man he was and the very marks
of the place where it was done / As he was at mass he was in doubt whether he
put water into the Chaleys wherefore he made his prayer with great devotion /
and whenne his prayer was done / he saw in the chaleys blood rodye as a Rose
as of the lamb immaculate our lord Ihesu criste / which whenne he had
received the host he received y^ as of a most delycate grape / He did many
miracles and signs with holy bread and holy water / and diverse that brought him
presents and stall part were punysshed He told king Henry the first when
he went over the sea that he should dye there and so he did / another time he
told the Earl stephan that he should be king and so he was / He showed to a
priest called Osborne that on the saterdaye at night he should go to our lord
as he had long desired / and so he dyed in the year of our lord god a
Thousand a hundred and.liiii. in the.x. Kalend of March.

De sancto Wlsino Ep^o and confessore.
Saint Wlsyne was borne in London / and by assent of his Fader and mother he was
made monk at Westmynster / and when he was made priest he shyned in all virtue
fighting against the enemy of mankind with vygylles and prayers / He
overcame the coueytousnes of the world with desire of heuynly things and with
all dylygence would note the mocyons of his body and spyrit / He was meke ready
to help his brethren and fulfilled with charity encouragynge his brethren to
al virtue in the best manner that he could to wyn^ them to our lord / After
by help of saint Dunstane king Edgare made him Abbot of Westmynster / and
then how dylygent he was for the health of other and how he faught against the
enemy of the flock of our lord what example he left byhynde him of doctrine
/ and of good life no man can tell / After king Ethelred sone to king Edgare
by a hole assent of the clergy and people made him bishop of Shyrborne / and
all the Lent he would be in the Cloister in fastings / wepynges / and
contemplacyon eschewyng the clamore of the world / And after Ester he would go
about his Diocise prechynge and techynge ye people / and did great reperacyon
upon the old temple at Shirborne / In the fyfth year after he was made bishop
he fell syke and a special friend of his sent to him to know how he did / and
he sent him word again that he should make him redye for on the morrow he
should go with him to the high Court to receive his reward in heuyn / And
whenne the messanger was gone he prayed the brethren that they would carye
both him and his said friend to Shirborne / and then lyftynge up his iy en to
heuyn like saint stephan he said Ise heuyn open / and our lord standing on
the right hand of almighty god / and as he said tho words he yielded his
spirit to the hands of our lord.

De sancto Wlstano Ep^o and confessore.
Saint Wlstano was borne in ye Prouynce of Warwyke And in the Monasterye of
Burghe he had his learning / He said a long Mass and was oonly content with
the offrynges of the people / he was a clean virgyn and a man of great
symplycyte and mekenes / He never took excess of drink and left etynge of
flesh by this occasyon. On a time as he was going to a certain busynes and
had appointed to ete of a goose after mass / as he was at mass / he could in
no wise keep his mind fro ye goose yt was rostynge at ye fire / and the
sauoure thereof was always in his nose / Wherefore he made an oath yt he would
never after ete mete of that kind / after he was made monk at Wygorn^ where
he had diverse offices and at last was made pryor / He used much fastings /
vigylles / and prayers / and most commonly he took sleep in the Church with
his book under his head / every sunday he used to preche to ye people / Wherefore
one reproved him saying a monk should keep his Cloister / And in the night
following yt man in his sleep was brought before a Judge / and was commanded to
be beten and so he was so sore that the marks apperyd upon him whenne he was
awake / And saint Uulstan^ herynge thereof with his blessyng made hy^ hole again.
Three days in the weke he absteyned fro all mete keeping also scylens / the
other three days he ete lekes and wortes soden and barley bread. Whenne he was
chosen to be bishop he would in no wise assent to take it till a holy man
blame^ him for his obstynacye / and then he took it upon him / The king Wyllyam
Conqueroure because saint Wlstan^ could speak no French and that he thought
he was but of small conynge would have deposed him / and whenne saint Lamfranke
then Archebysshoppe of Caunterburye at a counseyll bad him to sign his staff
and his sing he said he knew well he was never worthy to have the ro^e / but
he said saint Edward by Auctoryte of the (...) / and by hole assent as well of
the clergy as of the people leyde that burden in his neck against his will /
Wherefore he said he would resygne to him whereupon he went to saint Edwardes
Shryne / and there put his staff upon the stone that lay upon saint Edward
and said he resygne unto him / and the stone received ye staff and head it
fast. And when the king and saint Lanfranke making his prayers attempted to
have pulled out the staff but it would not remove / And whenne saint Wulstane
took it / it came lightly out wherefore saint Lamfranke he took the bysshopryke
again / He would have all his servants here mass / And when he sent any of
his servants in any Journey he would enjoin them to say prayers.vii. times
every day as clerks be bounden to do / and he that swear any oath should have
a certain punyssheme^t / He hard daly.^. masses and said him self the
third. He helyd a woman and also a man that had deuylles in them and the
woman was after a Nonne and lived a blessed life / A lepur with the water y^
saint Wlfstans washed in was helyd with his blessing helyd a Nonne yt was
king Heroldes (...) of a sort (...) When he rode he would begin ye Psaulter and
not cease till he had done / and one was always ready to give alms / In every of
his towns he had a house wherein he would be (...) till one warned him yt it was
time to go to ^uyce or to go to dinner / When he was at Wygorn he would sing
high mass / and he said he would as gladly resygne his bysshopryke as leave yt
office / He would be at collecion of ye brethren / and when Confession was
done and benediccyon given he would depart. There was a man that by no
Instaunce would forgive the death of his brother / wherefore saint Wlstane
committed yt said man to him whose he was and his body to satan whereupon he
was taken with a spyryte and was not hole till he had clearly forgyuen the
offense. He was desired by Elsyn that sometime was saint Edwardes seruau^te to
halowe a Church i^ a place where was a tree that let the light of the
Church which the said Elsyn because he used sometime to ete and play under
it would not have cut down wherefore saint Wlstane accursed it whereupon it
waxed dry / wherefore the lord cut it down saying there was nothing more
bitter then Wlstanes curse / and nothing more sweet then his blessing / In
the pene of our lord a Thousand.lxvii. the.xiiii. kalend of ^ (...) he went

THe life of this blessed King was found in the book that is called
Cathologus sanctoru^ / when the great Legend was nygh fynysshed and because it
could not be put in after the order of the letters it is ^ette last of all
the seyntes / and in the Kalendre it shall keep the order as other seyntes do
after the letter / Saint Edg^rekynge of England when he was about the age
of.xvi. years began his Raygne in the ^yme of Otho the Emperor at his birth
saint Dunstane Archebysshop of Caunterbury ha^^e the voice of an Angel fro
Heuyn saying peace be to England as l^nge as this child shall Raygne and as
long as our Dunstane shall live / He raygned.xvi. years and every year he
foundyd a new Monastery and gouernyd the Realm i^ high peace and Justice / he
subdued y^ king of scotland / and the kings in Wales to the nombre of ^yue
and diverse other he compellyd to come to his court and took a perpetual ^the
that they should be (...) unto him / What by by polycye / and what with fere he
refreyned his people fro great outragyous drinking and he was so terryble and
straight of punysshement that there was no pry^^t the^^ in all the Country n^
any great Rob^er of the people / He killed al y^ wild b^stes in England that
we^e ^^uenours and lived by blood / and commanded Guydale king ^f ^^^les that
he should for his ^ribute yearly bring unto him three Hundred W^lnes which he
did many years till he said there were no m^^ / Every year afteres Ester he

told him that the king was come to whom he answered that he had hard Mass /
and that he nedyd not any more to say Mass for that day / and when the king

offendyd / and was wherefore reprouyd by the Prophet Natham anon he co^fessyd
his offense cried mercy and did penance in like wise when this blessed king
had offendyd / and saint Dunstane reprouyd him thereof anon ferynge the
Judgment of god he knowlegyd his offense / and did seven years penance as in
the life of saint Dunstane apperyth in the latter end of saint Patrykes life
in the Legende it apperyth that many years after the departing of this blessed
king his body was found vncorrupt / and that when the place that was newly
ordained for him was to little / Oon presumptuously attemptyd to make the body
mete for the place / whereupon incontinent the blood followed so that all that
were there present fearyd greatly and thereupon he was honorably leyde in a
Shryne by the high Altar / which he had given to the said Church and anon
he that so presu^ptuously had offendyd suddenly fell down and expyred A man
that was mad / and also a blind man at the tumbe of this blessed king
received health / and he lies at Glaston bury / Pray we then to these glorious
seyntes that be in this present Kalendre that by merytes of their prayers we

Here (...) the life of saint Birgette.
Saint Birget was of the (...) and lynage of the noble kings of Gothis of the
kingdom of Swecia / her Faders name was Byrgerus and his moders name was
Sighryd / One time as her graun^moder was walking with her servants by the
Monastery of Shoo one of ye No^nes of the said monastery byhold^^ her beauty
and apparel in manner despised her for the great pride that she adiuged to be
in her. And in ye night following there appeared unto the said Nonne a certain
person of a meruaylous beauty / which as it had been with an angrye
cou^tenau^ce said unto her why have thou bakbyten my handemayde adiugynge her
to be proud which is not true / I shall make a daughter to come of her
progeny with whom I shall do great dedys in the world and I shall give her so
great grace that all people shall marvel / After wha^ saint Birget was in her
moders womb / i^ happened her mother for diverse causes to take the sea / where
her ship with much people were drowned with a sodeyn tempest / and she was
brought save to the land. And in the night following a person appeared unto her
with shynynge apparel / And said thou art sauyd for the child that thou haste
in thy body norysshe it / therefore with the charity of god / for it is given to
the of the especyall goodness of almighty god. And after whenne that blessed
child was newly borne a priest / which was curate of a Church thereby and was
after Bishop of Aboens a man of good / and blessed living as he was in his
prayers saw a bright shynynge cloud and in the cloud a virgyne having a
book in her hand / and a voice said unto him Byrgerus has a daughter borne
/ whose meruaylous voice shall be hard thorugh all ye world / which shall be a
voice of gladness and health in the tabernacles of ryghtwyse men / Fro the time
of the birth of this blessed child unto the end of three years she was in
manner as though she had had no tongue and as she should never have spoken /
but suddenly against the common course of children not stuttynge like the manner
of other children that begin to speak / she speak complete and full words of
such things as she hard / and saw in her tender youth she was never ydell
fro doing some good works / And when she was of the age of seven years she
saw nygh unto her bed an Altar and upon the altar she saw our Lady sitting
in bright clothing having in her hand a precious crown which said unto her
Birget / wylt thou not have this crown and she with mylde co^tenaunce
assentyng to our Lady put it upon her hedde / whereby she felt in manner as
though a cerkyll of a crown had gyrde her fast about the hedde and forth
with the vysyon vanysshed away / which she never after could forgette. In
the.x. year of her age / Whenne she on a time had hard in a Sermon of the
passion of our lord the same night our lord appeared unto her like as he had been the same hour newly Crucyfyed / and said unto her loo Birget how I am
woundyd / and she ^hynkynge that it had been newly done said / O lord who
hath^ done thus to the / and our lord answered and said they that do contempne
m^ / and forgette my charity they do this to me. And fro that day ever after
she had such affection to the Passion of our Lord that she syldome
refreyned her from weeping whenne she remembered it serving our lord as the
Appostell techyth with mekenes and terys. And ^boute the.xii. year of her age
her A^^te went on a night unto the bed of the holy virgyne Saint Byrgette /
where she found Saint Birget out of her hedde knelynge all nakyd and she
somewhat suspectynge the lyghtnesse of the virgyn commaundyd a rod to be brought
unto her / and as soon as she laid it upon the back of the virgyn to have
^etyn hirtherwith ye rod break all in small pecys / whereupon her Aunte
merueylyng greatly said unto her Bi^get / what have thou done* has not some
women taught the some fal^ prayers / and she weeping answered and said no Lady
but I rose out of my bed to laud and praise him that is ever wont to help me
to whom the lady said. who is that / The virgyne said our lord Crucyfyed that
I saw of late. And from that day forth her mother in law honored her and
louyd her more fervently then she was wont to do. As saint Byrget was playinge
with Maidens of like age to her / The devil appeared unto her having a
hondreth hands and fete most foul and loathsome to behold / of which sight
she being merueylously a ferde went straight and committed her to the Crucyfyx
where the devil eftsoon apperyd and said I have no power to do any thing to
the / but the crucyfix suffer me to do it / and thereupon he vanysshed away.
And so our lord delivered her from that danger / and when she was.xiii. years
of age though she entendyd by great fervent desire to have lived all her life
in virginite / nevertheless as well by the puruyaunce of almighty god / as by
the counceyll of her Fader she was married t^ a noble young knight called Ulpho
de Ulphasume prince of Neryce of the age of.xviii. years otherwise called Ulpho
Gudhmarson / which also was a virgyn / And by the space of.ii. years after
they were married they lived together clean vgynes. And after with devout
prayers made to almighty god / yt in the act of matrymony he would keep them
without offense / and that it would please him to send them issue to his
pleasur they had.viii. Childrene / that is to say.iiii. sons and.iiii.
daughters. The names of ye sons were these Charles / Birgerus / Benedictus /
and Gudmarus. And the names of the.iiii. daughters be these Merita / Katerina /
Judge burgys / and Cecilia / Charles the eldest sone of saint Byrget was a noble
knight and went with his mother in pylgremage toward Iherusalem ready to have
ieoparde his life for the recouerynge of the holy land / and as he was going
at ^apuls he dyed the.xii. day of March and in the day of the Ascencion of our
lord next following his soul went to heuyn as it was showed to saint Birgette
by reuelacion as in the.vii. book of her reuelacions the.xiii. and.xiiii.
chapter apperyth / And this noble knight had a sone also that was called
Charles / which after he had atteyned great co^nynge in Dyuynyte he left
study and the purpose that he had begone in and took a wife / And on a time as
he after ye death of saint Birget was prayinge at her tumbe she appeared unto him
holding as it had been an Horologe of glass in her hand and said Charles
see thou how nyghe this glass has run his course / and he said ye lady I
se it well and she said ayene so nyghe is the time of thy life / and there is
no more abiding for the but as thou see / But if thou haddyst ben obedyent
to god thou should have lived longer then any other in my progenye / and thou
should have been Bishop of Lyntopens and a notable pyler in the church of
god / Then he prayed her that she would pray for him and said he would gladly
amend in all that he might / And she said nay sone nay verily judgment is
given and the time is paste / and anon after he fell seek and thereupon taking
all the sacraments of the church he dyed and is buried in ye Monasterye of
Watzstenes which saint Birget in her life founded and endowed it suffycyently
for.lx. nonnes and.xxv. brethren Byrgerus the secunde sone of seint Birget
went with his mother to Ihrt'in / and there he was made knight and came with her
agaynet^ Rome / And when saint Birget was deed he and his suster Katheryne
cu^ueyed the relikes and the bones of saint Birget their mother to ye said
Monastery of Watzstenes in Swethyn. And after many great labors and expensys
done by the said Byrgerus by the commandment of our lord about the said
Monasterye of Watzstenes and for his mother the said Byrgerus changed this life
and as it is mekely to bylue took the blessing of god with his seyntes in
heuyn for the generation of ryghtwysme^ shall be blessed. Benedict the third
sone of saint Birgette was long seek in the monastery of Albastra / wherefore
saint Birget wept tenderly and prayed devoutly for him thinking it had been for
the sins of his Fader and mother / Then the devil appeared unto her and said
woman what menest thou with thy great weeping so to feeble thy sight all thy
labor is in vain trowest thou that thy terys can ascend into heuyn. And
anon our lord christ Ihesu was there present and said the sykenes of this
child is not of the sterres nor for his sins / ne yet for the sins of his
fader and mother / but it is of yt condition of his nature / and for his morere
wardei^ heuyn / and where beforetyme he has be called Benedict he shall be from
hensforth called yt sone of we^yng and of prayers and I shall shortly make an
end of his necessyte / and the.v. day after there was herd betwyx the bed
where the child lay and the wall as it had been ye most sweet song of birds
/ and then the soul of the child went from the body. Katheryne the second
daughter of saint Birget was married / and nevertheless she with her husband
lived in pure virginite / and after the death of her husband she was always with
her moderseit Birget / and lived in the estate of wydo whod al her life. This
blessed virgyne Katheryne because she was fervent in devotion and excellent in
grauite of manners and fair of body and lived a blessed life to give other
example of good living ye most honest woman of Rome loved to be in her
company. And when she was on a time desired by ye most noble matrones of the
City of Rome to walk with them for recreacyon without the walls of the City
as they walked here and there among many clusters of grapes. They desired ye
the said blessed virgyne Katheryn because she was of an Eligant stature would
gather them of the said grapes / and as she streched up her arms to ye grapes
it semyd as though her arms had been apperelled with shynyng cloth of gold
where in deed for very volu^tary pouerte yt she had chosyn she had broken
patchyd sleuys. and all yt matrons meruayled yt so meke a creature and devout
person would weer so p^cious apperell as it appeared to them yt she did not /
knowing yt it was the mystery and miracle of god yt they saw. The river of
tyber rose with so great power of wa^ yt it went over ye bridge of Laterane^ce
and ye monastery of saint James with many byldynges theraboute. Wherefore the
Cytezens of Rome dredynge ye destruction of the cite went unto ye house of ye
said blessed virgyn Katheryn praying her yt she would go with them to the River
to pray to our lord for ye cite / and she of mekenes reputyng her se^^ thereto
unworthy desired respyte. and when ye cytezens law yt by prayers they profyted
not somewhat with vyolence / nevertheless reverently they led her out of her
house unto the watersyde. And loo a meruaylous thing ye old miracle was
reuyued for like as in the time of Iosue the water of fleme Iordane was stopped
against ye natural course so at the entryng of the holy virgyn Katherin into ye
water of Tyber such vtue issued out of her by ye power of almighty god yt it
restreyned ye strength of ye water so yt it co^pellyd ye streme with a great
swyftnes to go into ye old course whereof all men ioyed laudyng the great power
of or lord showed i^ his blessed vgyn saint Katheryn. Iugeburges the iii.
dought of seit birget / in her youth was made a no^ne in the Monastery of
Rysaburga / where in short time after she yielded hit soul to almighty god /
And whenne her mother knew that she was deed with great Joy she said O lord
Ihesu criste blessed be thou that thou haste called her to the or the world
had be wrappyd her with sin / and anon after saint Birget was in her oratory
she fell upon such great weeping and sobbing that all that were nygh to her
hard and said loo how she wepyth for the death of her daughter. Then our lord
apperyd to her and said woman why wepyst thou though I know all things / yet
by thy words I will know / to whom she said O lord I weep not for yt my
daughter is deed / but I am glad thereof for if she had lived longer she should
have had before ye a gretter accomptes but I weep for this cause that I have
not informed her after thy commandments and because I have given her
examples of pride. And I have neclygently corrected her when she has offendyd
/ To whom our lord answered and said every mother that wepyth because her
daughter has offen did god and enformyth her after her best conscience she is
a very mother of charity and mother of terys and her daughter is the daughter of
god / for the mother. But that mother yt Ioyeth of that / that her daughter can
behave her after the world not carynge of her living so that she may be
eraltyd and honored in the world she is no very mother / but a stepmoder /
therefore for thy charity and good will thy daughter by the nyghest way shall
goo unto the Kingdom of heuyn / and at the Sepulture of the said glorious
virgyne Iugeburges he done many great miracles. Cecily ye fourth daughter of
saint Birget was the last child that ever she had and she is to be had in
great honor most specially for the synguler grace given unto her by our
blessed lady before she was borne / For when her mother at her birth was in
great parrell and in despair of her life our blessed lady was seen in white
clothing of sylke going to her / and as she stood before the bed she towched
saint Birget in diverse pertyes of her body so that all the women there being
present greatly meruayled thereof not knowing any thing who it was / And as
soon as our lady was gone out of the house saint Birget was delivered without
defyculte / and shortly after our lady said to saint Birget when thou was i^
icopardy at thy delyueraune I came unto the and helpyd the. Therefore thou art
unkind if thou love me not / wherefore labor yt thy children may also be my
children / Aftsei^t Birget induced her husband to life in contyneus many
years. And also they both went on pylgremage to saint James in Gales with great
devotion and after came again into their Country at Swecia / and by comen
assententendyd both to have entered into Relygyon and in that purpose the said
Ulpho her husband dyed the.xii. day of Februarii / the year of our lord god a
Thousand.CCC. and.xliiii. and is buried in the monastery of Albastra / After
his death saint Birget put all her will to the will of god / and thought she
would for the love of god forsake all ye worldly pleasure / and determined her
self with the assystaunce and grace of our lord to live in chaste wydowhed
all her life / and contynuelly made her prayer to almighty god to know by what
way she might best please him / And after she gave all her lands and goods
to her children and to pore men so that she might in pouerte follow our lord
and reseruyd to hirselfe oonly that that would symply and mekely serve her for
mete drink and clothing / and that to live in simple array / After by the
commandment of almighty god following the example of Abraham she left his
own country and her carnal friends and went in pylgremage to Rome / the year
of our lord god. M.CCC.xlvi. and the.xlii. year of her age thereto abide in the
life of penance and to vysyt ye lyghtes of saint Peter and Paul and the
relykes of other seyntes till she had of our lord other commandment having
ever with her.ii. old faders spirituell whereof one was a monk called Peter
which was pryor of Albastra of the order of Cisteux a pure virgyn and was a
man of great conning and of virtuous life / and the other was a priest of
Swecia / which also was a vgyn and a man of holy life / and he by the
commandment of almighty god taught her and her daughter Katheryn gra^mer to
which faders spiritual of her life she obeyed in all virtue as mekely as a
very meke monk is wont to obey his p^late in somoche yt she came into so
perfyte humylyte obedyens and mortyfiynge of her own will yt when she went to
perdons and holy places among the recourse of the people ever accompanied with
ye said priest her fader spiritual she durst not lift up her iyen fro the
ground till she had leave of the the ^ayd fader sperituell. And after the death
of her husband in the honor of the Trinite she weer nere next her bare skyn a
cord of hemp with many knottes hard bounden to her and in likewise about
every of her legs under her knees. And she never used any lynen cloth though
it weer in time of sykenes but oonly upon her head and next her skyn she weer
ever rough and sharp wolen cloth / and her outward appare^ was not after the
condition of her person / but much meke and abiecte / and she not oonly keep
ye fastings or vigylles yt holy church commands but she superadded thereto
many other in so much yt beyond the commandment of the church she
fasted.iiii. times in the weke as well in her husbands life as after. And after
her husbands death unto a little before her blessed passage out of this world
after fastings / prayers / and other dyuyne labors most come^ly she
re^resshed her self with right short sleep in her clothes yt she was wont to weer
lyinge upon a carpet without federbed / matres / straw or any otherthing / and
every friday in remembrance of ye glorious passion of our savior criste Ihesu
she absteyned in bread and water oonly bysyde like abstyne^ce yt she took many
other days in ye honor of diverse other seyntes / and wheder she fasted or
otherwise took her sustynaunce she rose ever with most great sobernes natfully
saciate / and in ye same frydayes she took war candellys and made bre^nyng
drops fall upon her bare flesh so yt ye bre^nynge marks of them
co^tynuelly remained / and gencian which is a much bitter erbe she held
co^tynually in her mouth. And when she was at Rome not dredyng the vigor of
the cold nor the impedyme^t of the great hete rain or foulnes of the way /
ne yet the sharpnes nf the snow or hayle and though she might have ryden /
nevertheless upon ye strength of her lene body she went every day the
Stacyons ordained by the church. And also visyted many other seyntes / She
used so many long knelynges that her knees were waxen hard as it had be of a
Camel / She was of so great and meruaylous mekenes yt ofttymes she sat unknown
with pore pilgrims at ye monastery of saint Laurence in pamsperna in ye cite of
Rome which is of ye order of saint Clare and there she took alms with them /
Ofttymes with her own hands for gods sake she repaired ye clothes of pore
men / and every day in her husbands life she fed.xii. pore men in her house
served and mynystred to them hirselfe such as they neded / Of her own
substance she repaired in her country many desolate hospytalles and as a busy
administratrice mercyful and pytuous she visited ye nedy syke me^ yt were there
and ha^deled and wasshyd their sores without horror or lothsomnes. And she was
of so meruaylouse great pacyence yt ye sykenes that she had her self and
wrongs that were done unto her and the death of her husband and of her sone
Charles with all other aduersyties she suffered most pacyently without murmur
or gruttynge and in all things with high mekenes she blessed our lord being
for such troubles the more constau^te in the faith the more ready in hope and
the more brennynge in Charity and hyghly she loved Justice and equity / The
mocions of the flesh and vayneglory with a busy cure and great trust in our
lord she despised and overcame. She was of such high wisdom and discrecion
that fro her youth unto his last hour asmoche as fraylnes might suffer she
never said good to be evil / nor evil to be good / And every friday in her
husbands life she was confessyd / and after his death she was every day
confessyd. Every sunday she and her daughter Katheryne / which lived with her
all her life in penance and chaste wydowhed with great deuocio^ and humylyte
resceyued the holy body of our lord ever lyuyng^ in secret penance / which
they did not to the apparaunte sight of the world / but secretly to almighty
god in symplenes of heart and cle^nes of spyrit. On a time when the king of
Swecia would have charged his commons with agreat exacion yt he might therwt have
paid a great su^me of money / wherein he was in detted / saint Birget for great
compassyon that she had to the people said to the king. Osyr do not so but
take my two sons and lay them in plegge to yo credytours till ye may pay your
money and do not offend god and yo subiettes. There was a knight yt always
studied to find new inuencyons among the people / which by his words and
evil examples brought many to dampnacion / this knight had great envy to saint
Birget / and because he durst not him self speak ^uyll to her he styred
another that should feign him self dronken / and then he to speak unto her
shameful and co^tumelious words to bring her out of pacyence / which cursed
man as saint Birget was sitting at the table with many honorable persons said
in the herynge of them all. O lady thou slepest to little / ^and thou wakest
to much it were expedyent for the to drink well and to sleep more has god
thynkest thou forsaken Relygyous persons / and speaks with proud people of
the world / It is a vain thing to give any faith to thy words / and as he was
so spekyng they that stood by would have put him away with violence to his
rebuke and shame / And saint Birget prohybyted them and said suffer him to
speak almighty god has sent him hither for I that in all my life have sought
mine own praise why should I not here my rightwysnes. This man says to me y^e
troth And when the knight herd of the great pacyence of saint Birget he took
great repentance and came to Rome and asked forgyuenes of saint Birget / and
there he made a good and a laudable end. The said blessed woman saint Birget
was so adourned and fulfilled with all virtues that our lord received her to
be his spouse and vysyted her many times with merueylous consolacyons and
dyuyne graces / and showed her many heuynly reuelacyons saying unto her / I
have chosen the to my spouse that I may show to the my secrets for it
pleasyth me so to do. And another time he said to her I take the to my spouse
and to my proper delight such as it is my pleasure to have with a chaste soul
/ In which reuelacyons be contained the high secret my steryes of ye most
gloriouse Trinite of the Incarnacyon natyuyte life and passion of our Savior
criste Ihesu with the plain and true Doctrine to know virtue and to follow
it / and to eschew vycesshewynge the reward of virtue / and the great
intolerable pain and dampnacyon that shall fall to sinners that dye in deedly
sin / exortynge also all men to do condign penance for the sins that they
have been shryuen of / to eschew the great and dredefull pains of purgatory
ordained for their purgacyon by the strenght equity of Justice which terryble
pains our Savior showed diverse times to his said spouse saint Birget to
thenten^ she should show them over ye people / which reuelacio^ saint Birget
wrote in her own natural tongue / and the said Pryour of Albastra her Fader
espu^ell by the commandment of almighty god translated them into Latin / and
divided them into.viii. books bysyde a especial reuelacion that she had of
the praysynges and excellencye of our blessed Lady which he appointed for the
Legend of the susters / and bysyde many other Reuelacyons that she had for
the Rule and foundacyon of her said Monasterye of Watzstenes / and four goodly
chappytours for prayers / with certain reuelacyons called the extrauagantes.
And natwithstandynge the great and synguler graces that she had as well in
the said Revelacio^s as otherwise she was not / therefore any thing exalted
but daily with many terys humbled hirselfe the more therefore / and would gladly
have hid and kept clo^^ the especyall gift / yt she had of our lord in ye
said Reuelacions / but that our lord commanded her often times to write and to
speak them boldly to the Pope to the Emperor kings princes and other people
/ that by the reason of them they might the sooner be conuertyd fro their
sins. And when she was in prayer and contemplaco^n she was often times seen by
many devout persons eleuate and lift up fro the ground the hight of a man
or there about an Angel appeared unto saint Birget / and among many other
things that he showed her of the excellencye of our blessed Lady he said y^
she was the maystres of (...) martyrs the techer of Co^fessou^^ ye clereshynyng
glass of virgyns the helper of wydowes / and gyuer of h^^some monycions to
them yt lyuyd in matrymonye and a great strength to all them ye lived in ye
faith of holy church / First he said yt o^ blessed lady showed and declared
to thappostelles many things of her sone yt they knew not before / and yt she
encouraged martyrs gladly to suffer trybulacio^ for ye name of criste wh^^he
for their sake many years suffered great tribulacio^ adding thereto y^ she
hirself.xxxiii. years before ye death of her sone co^tynuelly suffered trouble in
her heart with great paciens* She taught to co^fessoures y^ very true lesso^s of
health and they by his doctrine and example perfytly lernyd to order ye times of
ye da^ and of ye night wisely to ye land and glory of almyght god / and to use
good discreso^n in taking of their sleep of their mete and in labor of their
bodies / and of her most vtuous life vgyns learned to Rule them self honestly /
and strongly to keep their virgynall clennes unto ye death to fle much speech
and al vanyties to discuss with a dylygent p^medytacion al their works yt they
had to do and to examyne them streyghtly in a espu^ell balau^ce To wydowes she
said to their comfort / yt though by moderly charity it had much pleased her y^
her sone had had no more will to have dyed in his manhed then in his godhed /
nevertheless she holy co^fermed her will to ye will of god ^hewsyng rather to ye
fulfylling of ye will of god mekely to sustain al tribulaco^n then for her
plesur anythyng to do against ye will of god / and with such manner of speech she
made wydowes pacient i^ their tribulaco^s and co^stau^tei^ al te^ptacio^s of ye
body. Moreover she (...) them that lived in matrymony that to the body and
soul in perfyght charity not sayued they should lyue^og^ (...) and that to ye
honor of almyg^^y god / they should keep one hole will saying to them of her
self how she had given all her faith and hole intent clearly to almighty god /
and that for his love she never withstode his will in any thing / Ulpho that
was husband to saint Birget on a time after his death apperyd unto her / and
said for a time I felt the great Justice of our lord in purgatory / now but
mercy somewhat draws nere unto me and you shall know that in my lyfelyne ways
I excedyd: of the which when I was feke I took not suffycyent repentance. The
first was that I took to great delight and pleasure in the wantones of the
child that thou know of. The se^^nde i^ that ^f my neclyge^ce I did not
restore a wydowe before my death for certain goods that I bought of her /
therefore that thou shall prove that I say true. to morrow she shall (...) to
the and then give to her what so ever she asks for she will ask nothing but
that y^ is right. The third is yt of ye lyghtnes of my mind I promised a man
to take his part in all his difficultyes by reason whereof he was so ^olde that
he attempted many things against the king and the law. The fourth is that in
^urneys and in vanytes of the world I occupied myself more for the sight of
the world then for any prophet. The fyft is that in the exilynge of a certyn
man I was over much rygorouse against him / for though he were worthy to have
that judgment yet I was less merciful to him then I should have been / then
saint Birget said unto him. O blessed soul what thing has profytyd the to
thy health / or what thing may prefyre the now to thy delyueraunce / and he
answered. Sex things have profited me. The first is my confession that I made
every frydaye when I might have time having full purpose to amend / The
second is that when I sat in Judgment I iuged not for the love of money / or
for favor / But all my Iugementys I examynyd dylygently ready to correct
where I had erryd and to withdraw where I had done that I should not have done
/ The third is that I obeyed unto my ghostly Fader which cou^ceylyd me that I
should not perform the act of matrimony after I knew that the child was
quycke / The fourth is that when I was lodgyd in any place I took head as
nyghe as I could / that by my self / or my Seruauntys I were not unkind to
poor men nor that I was not chargefull to them putting all my stody to se
that I came not into any det / but that I prouydyd how it should be paid / The
fyfte is yt abstynence that I took in the way to saint James for I ordeynyd
so that I drank not betwyxte melys and for that abstyne^ce is pardonyd to me
the long sitting that I had at my table / my loquacyte / and excess / and
now I am sure of my health though I be uncertain of the owre / The syxte is
that I commyttyd my Iugementys to them that I thought were ryghtwyse and that
would pay my dettys / and because I doubtyd to be in det while I was on life I
resygnyd to the king his prouyncys that my soul should not suffer the
Judgment of god Therefore now in asmoche as it is grau^tyd to me by almighty
god that I shall ask help and pray the that by a hoole year thowe make
contynuelly to be song for me / and for all that our Lord would have to be
prayed for / massys of our Lady / of Aungellys / and of all seyntys / and also
of ye passion of our savior criste Ihesu for I trust I shall be shortly
delyueryd and specially be dylygent about poor men to dystrybute to them
such Uessellys / Horsys / and other things wherein in my life I had over much
delight / And also if thowe may / do not forgete to give some chalyces for the
sacryfyce of god / for verily they profit much to ye health of the soul /
and thyn immovable goods leave to our Chylderne for I did never evil purchase
any thing / or evil hold any thing / ne would not have done if I might /
And this blessed woman saint Byrget lyuyd after she went out of her own
country.xxviii. year by all which time she never went to any place but by the
especyall commandment of our Lord by whose commandment she went to
Iherusalem and there dylyge^tlye with great devotion vysyted all ye placys
where our blessed Lady was salutyd by the Angel Gabryell / and where our
Lord was borne / baptized / conuersaunte / or did any miracle / and where he
was Illudyd / Crucyfyed and buried / and where he assendyd into heuyn / and
also at diverse other times she vysytyd many Seyntys in her own country / and
in other countries thereto adioynynge in France / Italye / Spain / Napuls /
and many other placys / and after her said holy pylgrymagys she lyuyd the
resydue of her life in ye cyty of Rome five days before yt saint Byrgette
should pass out of this transytory Life our Lord apperyd unto her before an
Altar that was in her Chaumber / and with a merry countenance said unto her I
have not vysytyd the in this time with consolacyons for it was the time of thy
probacyon / Therefore now thowe art prouyd proceed and make the ready for the
time is come yt that I promised yt shall be fulfyllyd yt is to say yt before mine
Altar thou shalt be clothyd and consecrate a Nun / and from hensforthe thou
shalt not only be reputyd to be my espouse / but also thou shalt be reputyd
to be mother in watzstenys neuertelesse know it for a troth thou shalt leave
thy Body here in Rome unto the time it shall come into the place ordeynyd for
it / and know thou for certain that men shall come when it shall please me
that with all swetnes and Joy shall receive the wordys of the Heavenly
reuelacyons that I have shemyd to the and all things that I have said to the
shall be fulfyllyd / And though my grace be withdrawn fro many for their
unkindness / Nevertheless other shall come that shall rise in their place
which shall opteyne my Grace / And in the morning of the fyfte Day now
next following after thou haste receyuyd the Sacrame^tys of the Church call
to the seuerallye the persons that I have named to the now and tell them
what they shall do and then in their Handys thou shalt come into my joy
everlasting / and thy Body shall be carried to watzstenes / And on the said
fyfte Day she called to her all her household and showed them what they
should do and at the last she gave a great monycyon to her son Byrgerus / and
to her daughter Katheryne chargynge them that above all things they should
persevere in the dread of god / and in the Love of their neyghbourys / and in
good Warkys / and theropon she made her Confession with great dylygens and
Devotion / and receyuynge the blessed Body of our Lord was a noylyd / And as
a Mass was said before her and she had honouryd the blessed Body of our
Lord she lift up her eyes to Heuyn / and said. In manus tuas domine
commendo spiritum meum / which is to seye Lord into thy handys I commit my
spirit / And with tho wordys she yeldyd her soul to our Lord the.xxiii. day
of Iulii / the year of our Lord god a thousand three hundredth.lxxiii. and the
year of her age.lxx. And anon a great fame went thrughe all the City of rome
of the death of this glorious woman / and the people came with great devotion to
se the holy body / gloryfyinge / and lawdynge almighty god / and in such gre^e
recourse of the people the Body was carried to the monastery of saint Laurence
as it was showed by her self that it should be and for the great prese of the
people it could not conuenyently be buried unto the second day / and before
she was buried a woman called Agnes de co^tess a dwelling in the City of Rome
/ which fro her birth had a great gross throat much foul and dyfformyd
came with other to the Body of saint Byrgette / and with her own Gyrdell she
towchyd ye hand of this glorious woman saint Byrgette with great devotion and
bound ye same gyrdell abowte her neck and anon aftyr her throat swagyd by ye
miracle of almighty god was brought in to the due shappe and conformyte / Also
there was a Nonne of the said monastery of saint Laure^ce / which for feebleness
/ and great sykenes that she had in her stomach by the space of.ii. yerys kept
her bed well nere all that time / and she was much famylyer / with saint
Byrgette in her life / this Nonne with great peyn rose fro her bed and with
help came to the Beer and lay by it all the night and cessyd not to pray /
almighty god that by the merytys and Prayers of his gloryouse spouse saint
Byrgette whose Body was there present that she might have so much ease of
her said long sykenes yt she might with her Susters be at deuyne service /
and that she might when need should require goo about ye monastery with out
help / And in the morning she had more health of her Body then she prayed
fore / And the.xxvi. day of the said month of Iulii the Body of Saint
Birgette was buried in the said Monasterye of saint Laurence in a cheste of
wode enclosyd in a tomb of marbull / and in the space of five wekys and a
half the Flesh by Miracle was clearly consumyd and goon / and nothing left
but the clear white shynynge Bonys / and after the said Bonys and Relykes of
saint Birgette were translatyd from Rome to the said Monasterye of watzstenes
in swecia the fourth nonas of Iulii by the said Byrgerus and Katheryne / and
after this blessed woman saint Birgette was canonyzed by pope bonyface of that
name the nynth / ye year of our Lord god a thousand.CCC.lxxxxi. as in the Bull
of her canonyzacion apperyth / A woman of the dyocesse of Lyncope^ce called
Elseby Snara with great pain / and sorrow was delivered of a deed Child / and
when she was after her great pain come to her perfyte remembrance with humble
prayer she besoughte almyghtye god that by ye merytes of his gloryouse espouse
saint Birgette the Child might be restoryd to Life and made a vow that if
the Child came to life that she would vysyte the sepulcre of Saint Birgette /
And anon the Infaun^^ began to wax hot / and to take Brethe and afterward
it was restoryd to full Life wherefore the Mother with great devotion / and
gladness fulfyllynge her auowe / vysytyd the Relykes of Saint Birgette in the
Monasterye of watzstenes about the Natyuyte of our Lord certain persons of
gothlande took the Sea and with a great Tempeste they were driven into a place
which was much shalowe of Water and there their Ship was all to Broysyd /
and they tarried there a se night in great Hunger / and Cold / and Could not
remove their Ship / At the wekys end for asmoche as they were like to have
perysshyd for lack of Sustenau^ce they drew Cuttes among them / which of
them should be kyllyd and made mete for the other / And he upon whom the
Lotte fell with great weeping commyttyd him to Saint Birgette and prayde for
help promising that if he escapyd that Danger / he would vysyte her at her
Monasterye of watzstenes / And anon by Miracle they found a great peace of
Flesh in the Sea / and when they had refresshyd them self therwyth there
arose anon such a great calmenes that in a little small Bote they came by
great long weyes in the Sea to land / And as he upon whom the Lotte fell
was going toward watzstenes to fulfill his a vow / by the way he was takyn
Prisoner / and was grievously betyn and leyde in Prysone with many Irons upon
him wherefore estesones he prayde to saint Birgette for help / and anon as he
had so done / all his Irons / and Bondys fell fro him and he took his
Journey toward saint Birgette without let with great devotion / In the
City of lyptzyge there was a Peynter called Henry / which for the great love
that he had to saint Birgette was wont to sey many things among doctors
of her Holiness and of the Bookys of her Heavenly reuelacyons / wherefore on a
time oon of the Doctors with great Indygnacyon said unto him but thou
leuesayde he to speak of this new he ^esye / and of the Bokys of that old
matrone / I shall cause the to be burnyd for thy error / and so he porposyd
to have don and caused the Paynter to be cytyd / that the day following he
should appear before the Iuges / whereupon the said Peynter went to a Clerk
that had also great denocyon to Saint Birgette to ask him cou^ceyle / and he
comfortyd him right charitably / and aduysyd him to be dylygent in prayer to
almyghtye god / and to saint Birgette and bade him dread nothing but they
would help him / And more over he said that he and another priest called
master John^ Torto which also had great devotion to saint Birgette would pray
for him to saint Birgette / and so they did / In the morning the said
Peynter being much ferefull apperyd before ye Iuges where he was strayghtly
examynyd / and many things were leyde to his charge to have conuyctyd him of
heresye / But by the prayers of Saint Birgette for whom he sufferde that
trowble / the said simple lay man not letterde / was so fulfyllyd with the
holy ghost and speak so effectuouslye great high mysteryes of almyghtye God
that his adversaries could not resyste ye spyryt that speak in him / wherefore
he was dyschargyd / and his adversaries confysyd / Not long after our Lord
took vengeance of him that was the Pryncypall causer of that dysturbaunce /
for as he went on a night hoole to his bed the same night he was smytten with
the Falling sykenes whereof he dyed / And anon his Body rottyd / and corruptyd
with such an horrible stenche that few men durst come nyghe it / And with
handelynge of the Body the Flesche came from the Bonys by great peaces / And at
the last when men for his horrible sauoure refusyd to bear him to his grave /
certain personys that were vsyd to clensevyle stynkynge pryuyes where hyryd to
bear the wretchyd Body to his Grave / and whenne they had don they said
that if they had known before / that he had had so horrible a sauoure / that
they would not have borne him though they might have had the dowble price that
they had.

Hereaftre follows a devout Book compylyd by master Walter Hylton to a
devout man in temperall estate how he should rule him / which is right
expedyent for every man / most in especyall for them that live in the medylde
life and it shewyth what medelyd life is / he that will dylygently look upon it
may thereby the sooner come to some of ye high virtues and blessed life that he
shall read of in the beginning of this present Book of the glorious Seyntys
conteynyd in the same.

How a man yt woll be ghostly must first use much Bodily exercise in
penance and destroyenge of sin. Capitulum. primum.
Dear brother i^ christ two manner of states there are in holy Church by the
which cryste^ soulys please god and get them the bliss of Heuyn / the one is
bodily / and the other is ghostly / bodily werkynge longs pryncypally to
worldly men and wymen ye which lefully use worldly goods / and wylfully use
worldly busynes. Also it longs to all young beginning men the which comen
new out of worldly synnys to ye service of god / for to make them able to
ghostly werkynge and for to break down yt vnbuxumnes of the body by dyscrecyon
/ and by such Bodily werkynge that it might be souple and ready / and not
much co^traryous to the spyryte in ghostly werkynge / for saint poule says as
woman was made for man / and not man for woman / right so bodily werkynge was
made for ghostly / and not ghostly for bodily / bodily werkynge goth before /
and ghostly co^myth after as saint Poule says. Non quod prius spirituale: sed
quod prius animale deinde spirituale / And this is a cause why it behouyth to
be so / for we are borne in sin and corrupcyon of the flesh by the which we are so blyndyd and so ouerlayed yt we have neither the ghostlye knowing of god
by light of understanding / ne ghostlye feeling of him by clean desire of
loving / and therefore we may not suddenly sterte out of this derke night of
this flesshly corrupcyon into yt ghoostly light / for we may not suffer it /
ne bear it for syknes of our self no more than we may with our bodily eyes
when they at sore behold ye light of the son and therefore we must abide and
work by process of time. First by bodyly werkys bysyly till we be dyschargyd
of this heavy burden of sin which lettyth us fro ghostlye werkynge / and till
our souls be somwat clensyd fro great outward sins and abled to ghostly
work / By this bodyly werkynge yt I speak of may thou understood all
manner of good werkys yt thy soul does by ye wits and the me^brys of thy
body unto thy self / as in fasting wakyng and in restraining of flesshely
lusts by penance doing / or to thyn even christian by fullfyllynge of ye dedys
of mercy bodily or ghostly / or unto god by sufferynge of all bodily myscheuys
for ye love of ryghwysenes / All thy se werkys done in troth by charity please
god / without which they are naught / Than who so desyrythe for to be occupied
ghostly / it is syker and profitable to him yt he be first well assayde a
long time in this bodily werkyng for these bodily dedys are a toke^ and a
showing of moral virtues without which a soul is not able for to work
ghostlye / Break down first pride in bodily berynge and also within thy heart
thinking / bostynge / and praysynge of thy self / vayn liking i^ thy self
of any thing yt god has sent to ye bodily or ghostly / Break down also envy
and ire against thyn eue^crysten whether they be rich or poor good or bad
that thou hate him not / ne have dysdeyne of him wylfully neither in word ne
in deed. Also break down couetyse of worldly good that thou for that holding
/ getting / or saving of it offend not thy concyence / ne break not charity
to god and to thyn euyncrysten for love of any worly good / but that thou
gettyst to keep it / and spe^de it without love and vain lykynke of it as
reason askyth in worship of god / and help of thyn euencrysten Break down
also as much as thou may flesshly lykynges either of accydye / or bodily ease
/ glotony or lechery and than when thou have ben we^l traueylyd and well asayde
in all such bodily werkys / than may thou by grace ordeyne the to ghostlye
werkynge.

How a man that is set only to ghostly living / shall rule all his dedys by
dyscrecyon without which they turn often into vice. Ca. ii.
THe grace and the goodness of our Lord Ihesu christ that he has showed to the
in withdrawynge of thyn Heart fro lust / and liking of worldly vanyte / and
use of Flesshely synnys / And in turnynge of thy will entyerly to his Service /
and his plesaunce brings into mine Heart much matter to love him in his mercy
/ and also it steryth me greatly to stre^gthe the in thy good purpose / and in
thy werkynge that thou haste begone for to bring it to a good end if that I
could / And pryncypally for god / and sythen for tender affection of love yt
thou haste to me if I be a wretch and unworthy / I know well the desire of
thyn heart yt thou desyrest greatly to serve our Lord by ghostly occupacyon
all holly withouten lettynge or troublynge of worldly busynes yt thou myghtest
come by grace to more knowing and ghostlye feeling of god and of ghostly
things / this desire is good as I hope and of god for it is set upon him in
charity spyrytually / nevertheless it is to refrain and rule by dyscrescyon
as against outward werkynge after ye state that thou art in / for charity
vnrulyd tourneth sometime into vice and therefore it is said in holy Writ.
Ordinauit in me charitatem / that is to say / our Lord geuynge to me charity
/ set it in order and in rule that it should not be lost through mine
vndyscressyon / right so this charity / and this desire that our Lord has
geuyn of his mercy to the is for to rule and ordeyne how thou shall pursue it
after thy degree askyth / and after the living that thou have vsyd before time
/ and after ye grace of virtues that thou now haste / Thou shall not utterly
follow thy desire for to leave occupacyon and busynes of the worldle ye which are
needful to use in rewlynge of thy self and of all other that are under thy
keeping / and give the holly to ghostly occupacyon of Prayers and holy
medytacyons / as it were a Friar or a Monk / or an other man yt were not
bound to the world be Children and seruau^tys as thou art for it fallyth not
to the / and if thou do so thou kepyst not the order of Charity. Also if thou
woldyst leave utterly ghostly occupacyon namemely now after the grace that god
has geuyn to the and set the holly to the busynes of the world in fulfyllynge
of the works of actyfe Life as fully as an other man that never felyd devotion
/ thou leuyst the order of charity / For thy state askyth for to do both /
each of them in diverse times thou shalt meddle the werkys of actyfe life with
ghostely werkys of life co^templatyfe / And than do thou well / For thou
shalt one time be busye with Martha for to rule / and govern thyn husholde.
Thy children / thy seruauntys / thy neyghbourys / thy tenauntys / if they do
well comfort them therein and help them / if they do evil for to teache them
a mende the^ / and chastyse them / and thou shall also look and know wisely
thy things / and thy worldly goods be ryghtfully kept by thy seruauntys /
gouernyd / and truly spendyd yt thou might ye more ple^teuously fulfill ye
dedys of mersy with them unto thy even christian / Also thou shall with marye
leave busynes of the world and sytte down at the feet of our Lord by mekenes
in prayers and in holy thoughtys / and in contemplacyon of him as he geuyth the
grace / and so shall thou goo fro that one to that other medefully and fulfill
them both / And than kepeste thou well the order of Charity.

Unto what manner of man belo^gyth actyf life. Ca. iii.
Nevertheless that thou ne have wonder of this yt I say / therefore I shall
tell the and declare to the a little of this more openly / Thou shalt
understand yt there is three manners of Living / one is Actyfe life / another
is contemplatyfe / the third is made of both / and that is medelyd / Actyfe
life above longs to Worldly men and wymen the which are lewd in knowing of
ghostlye occupacyon for they ne feel savor ne devotion by feruoure of love as
other men do / ne they can no skylle of it / and yet nevertheless they have
dread of god and of the pain of hell / and therefore they flee sin and they
have desire for to please god / and for to come to heuyn and a good will have
to there eue^crysten / unto these men it is needful and spedefull to use the
werkys of actyflyfe as busylye as they may in the help of themself and of
their euencrysten / for they can not else do.

Unto whom belongyth contemplatyfe life. Ca. iiii.
COntemplatyfe life longs alone to such men and wymen that for ye love of god
forsake all open sins of the world and their flesh / and all busynes /
charges and governance of worldly goods and make them self poor and nakyd
to the bare need of the bodyly kind and flee fro souereynte of all other men
to the service of god / unto these men it longs for to traueyle / and occupye
them inwardly for to get thrughe the grace of our lord clennes in heart and
peace in concyens by destroyinge of sin and receyuynge of virtues / and so
for to come to contemplacyon which clennes may not be had without great
exarcyse of body and contynuell travail of the spirit in devout prayers
fervent desires and ghostly medyracyons.

Unto whom belongs medlyd life. Ca. v.
THe third life ye is the medlyd life lo^geth to men of bodyly church as to
prelatys and to other curatys the which have cure and soueraynte over other
men for to teache and rule the^ both their bodies and their soulys pryncipally
in fulfyllynge of the dedys of mercy bodily and ghostly unto these men it
longyth sometime to use werkys of mercy in actyfe life in help and sustenaunce
of them self and of their subgiettys and of other also / and sometime for to
leave all manner of busynes outward and to give them unto prayers / and
medytacyons as redynge of holy wryt and to other ghostly occupacyo^s after yt
they feel them disposyd / Also it lo^geth to some te^porall men which have
souereynte with much fauer of worldly goods / and have also as it were
lordshyp over other men for to govern and sustain them as a fader has over
his children / and a master over his seruau^tis and a Lord over his tenau^tys
/ ye which men have also receyuyd of our Lords gift grace of devotion / and
i^ party sauoure of ghostly occupacyon / Unto these men also lo^geth medlyd
life yt is both actyfe and contemplatyfe / For is these men sto^dynge ye charge
/ and ye bo^de yt they have takyn will leave utterly yt busynes of the word /
the which ought skylfully to be vsyd i^ fulfyllynge of her charge and holly
give them to co^te^platyf life / they do not well / for they keep not ye order
of charity / for charity as thou knowyst well lies both in Love of god and of
thyn euencristen / and therefore it is yt he yt has charity to use both in
werkynke now to yt one / and now to yt other / for he yt for ye love of god in
co^templacyon leuyth the love of his euencristen and does not to them as he
ought when he is bound thereto / he fulfyllyth not charity / also on ye
contraye wise who so has so great regard to work of actyfe life and to
busynes of ye world yt for the love of his eue^cristen he leuyth gostly
occupacyo^ utterly after yt god has dysposyd him thereto / he fulfyllyth not
charity / this is the saying of saint gregory / for though our lord for to
styre some to use this medlyd life / took upon him self the person of such
manner men both of prelatis of holy church and of such other as are disposed
thereto as I have said and gave them ensaumple by his own werkynge yt they
should use this medlyd life as he did / One time he co^monyd with men / and medlyd
with them she wynge his dedys of mercy for them taught the vnco^nynge and
unknown by his prechynge / he vysityd the syke and helyd them of their
dyseasys / he fed ye hu^gry and he co^fortyd yt sorry nevertheless other times
he left ye co^uersacyo^ of all worldly men / and of this dyscyples and went
into desert upon ye hyllys and co^tynued all night in prayers alone as the
gospel says / therefore this medlyd life she with our lord in him self to
ensau^ple of all other men yt have takyn the charge of this medlyd life / yt
they should one time give the^ to busynes of worldly thyngys at reasonable need /
and to the werkys of actyfe life in profyt of their euencrysten which they
have cure of / and an other time give them holly to devotion and contemplacyon
/ in prayers / and medytacyons.

How holy Busshops vsyd medlyd life. Ca. vi.
THis life led holy busshopys which had cure of mennys souls and
mynystracyon of temporal goods / for these holy men left not utterly the
mynystracyon / and the lokynge / and the dyspendynge of worldly goods and gave
them holly to co^templacyon as much grace of contemplacyon as they had / but
they left full often their own rest in contemplacyon when yt they had well
lever have been stylle / for love of their euyncryste^ / and entermetyd them
with worldly busynes i^ helping of there subgyettys and southly that was
charity / For wisely / and dyscretly they departed their living in two / O
time they fulfyllyd the lower part of charity by werkys of actyfe life / for
they were bound thereto by taking of her prelacye / And an other time they
fullfyllyd the higher party of charity in contemplacyon of god and of ghostly
things by prayers and medytacyons / and so they had charity to god and to there
euencrysten / both in affection of soul within / and also in showing of
bodyly dedys without / other men yt were oonly contemplatyfe / and were fre fro
all curys / and prelacye / they had full charity to god and to their
euencrysten but it was oonly in affection of their soul / and not in outward
showing / and in hap so much it was the more full inward / yt they might
not / ne it nedyd not / ne it fill not for them to show it outward / but
theyse men that were in prelacye / and other also yt were only temporal men
had full charity in affection within / and also in werkynge and that is
properly this medlyd life / both of actyfe / and of co^templatyfe life / and
southly for such a man that is inspyrytuell souereynte as prelatis / and
curatys be / or in temporal souereynte as worldly Lords / and masters are /
I hold this medlyd life best / and most behouefull to them as long as they
are bounden thereto / But to other that are free not bound to temporal
mynystracyon / ne to spyrytuall I hope that life contemplatyfe alone if they
might come thereto southfastly were best / most spedefull / most medefull /
most fair / and most worthy to them for to use and to hold / and not for to
leave it wylfully for any outward warkynge of actyfe life / but if it were in
great need / at great releuynge and comfortynge of other men either of their
bodies or of their souls / and than if need ask at ye prayer and instau^ce of
other / or else at the bidding of his sovereign I hope it be good to show it
to the^ in outward werkys of actyf life for a time in helping of their
euecrysten.

What life most accordyd to him that this was written to / And that a man that
has souerentye shall not give him utterly to deuocio^ and leave wordly busynes.
Ca. vii.
By this that I have said a party may thou understand which is oon / and
which is other / and which accordyth most to thy state of living / and
southly as methynkyth this medlyd life accordyth most to the sythen our lord
has ordeynyd and set the in the state of soueraynte over other men as much as
it is / and has lent the abu^dau^ce of worldly goods / for to rule and
sustain specially all these yt are under thy governance / and thy lordshyp
after thy might and conning / and also therewith thou haste receyuyd grace of
ye mercy of our lord for to know thy self / and gostly desire and sauoure of
his love I hope yt this life yt is medlyd is best and accordyth most to ye for
to travail in and therefore deperte wisely thy living / for wit thou well if
thou leave needful busynes of actyfe life and be rekles and take no keep of thy
worldly goods how they arspe^dyd and kept ne makyst no force of thy subiectys
and of thy euencrysten by cause of desire and will yt thou have only to give ye
to ghostly occupacyo^ / wenynge yt thou art by yt excused / if thou do so thou
do not wysly / for what ar all thy werkys worth whether they be bodyly or
ghostly / but if they be done rightfully and resonably to ye worship of god and
after his bidding / southly right naught / than if thou leave yt thing yt
thou art bound to by ye way of charity of right and reason / and wylt holly
give ye to an other thing wylfully as it were to a more plesaunce of god
which thou art not fully bound to / thou do not worshype dyscretly to him
/ thou art busy to worship his head and his face and to array it fair and
curyously / but thou leuest his body with yt feet raggyd and rent / and take
no keep thereof and there thou worshypest him not for it is vylany and no
worship a man for to be curyouslye arrayed upon his head with perlys and precious
stonys / and all his body nakyd and bare as it were a beggar / right so ghostly
it is no worship to god to crown his head and leave his body bare / thou shall
vndertonde yt our Lord ihesu christ as man is head of his ghostly body which is
holy church / ye me^bres of his body are all crystenyd men some are arms /
some are feet / and some are other me^bres after sundry werkynges yt they use
in their living / tha^ if yt thou be busy with all thy might for to array his
head yt is for to worshype him self by mind of his passion and of his other
werkys in his manhed by deuocyo^ and medytacyo^ of him and forgettyst his feet
yt ar thy children thy seruau^tys / thy tenau^tys and all thyn eue^crysten /
and letyst the^ spyll for defaute of keeping vnarayed / unkept and not tent to
as they ought for to be / thou pleasyst him not / thou do est no worship to him
/ thou make yt to kiss his mothe by devotion and ghostly prayer / but thou
tredest upon his feet and defoulyst them in as much as thou wylt not tend to
them for neclyge^ce of thy self / ye which thou haste take cure of / thus
thynkyth me / nevertheless if thou think yt this is not south / for it were a
feyre office to worship the head of him / as for to be all day occupied in
medytacion of ye manhed / than for to go lower to other werkys and make clean
his feet as for to be busy both in word and i^ deed about ye help of thyn
eue^crysten / think not so for southly he will thank the more for the meke
washing of his feet when they are right foul and stynke upon ye / than for
all the precious peyntynge / and arayenge yt thou can make about his hedde
by mind of his manhed / for it is fair Inoughe / and nedythe not to be arrayed
of ye much / but his fet and his other me^brys yt are sometime evil arrayed and
had need to be lokyd and helped by the namely sythen thou art bound thereto /
and therefore will he cu^ne the more thank if thou wylt mekely and te^derly
look to the^ / for ye more lower service yt thou do to thy Lord for ye love
of him or to any of his me^bres when need and right askyth it with a glad meke
heart / ye more pleasyst thou him / thinking yt it were enough for the to be
at ye leest degree and at the lowyst state sythen it is his will yt it be so /
for it semyth to me sythen he has put ye in yt state for to traueyle and serve
other men / that it is well done that thou should fulfill it after thy might
/ this ensaumple I say to ye not for thou do not thus as I say / for I
hope yt thou do thus and better but I would that thou should do thus
gladly and not think loath for to leave sometime ghostly occupacyon and entermete
with worldly busynes in wise keeping and spending of thy worldly goods in good
rulynge of thy seruau^^ys and of thy tenau^tys and in other good werkys
werkynge to all thyn euyncrysten after thy might / but that thou should do
both werkys in diverse times and with as good will the one as the other if thou
myghtyst / As if thou had prayed and ben occupied ghostly thou shall after
certain time / break of that and then shalt thou busyly and gladlye occupye
the in some bodyly occupacyon to thyn even christian / And also when thou haste
ben busye outward a while with thy seruauntys or with other men profytably
thou shalt break of and turn again to thy prayers and thy deuocyons after
god geuyth the grace and so shall thou put away by grace of our Lord /
sloth / ydylnes / and vain rest that comes of thy flesh under color of
conte^placyon and lettyth the sometime fro medefull / and spedefull occupacyon
in outward busynes and thou shalt be aye well occupied Bodyly / or ghostly /
and therefore if thou will do well thou shall do ghostlye as Jacob did bodyly.

How a man that is well traueylyd and prouyd in dedys of actyf life may pass
forth and atteyne to contemplacyo^ which is fyguryd by iacobes wyfes rachell
and lya. ca. viii.
HOly wryt says yt Jacob when he began to serve his master Laban / he
coueytyd rachell his master daughter to his wife for her fair head / and for
her he served seven year but when he wend to have had her to his wife / he had
first lya ye other daughter i^ stead of Rachell and afterward he took rachell /
and so he had both at ye last / by Jacob i^ holy wryt is vnderstonden an
ouercomer of synnys / By these two Wives are understand as Saint Gregory says
/ two lives in holy Church / actyfe life / and contemplatyfe life / lya is as
much for to say as traueylous / and betokens actyfe life / rachell is as
much to say as sight of beginning that is god / and betokenyth life
conte^platyfe / lya bare children / But she was foreyzed rachell was fair and
lovely / but she was barayn / than rygh as Jacob couetyd rachell for her
fayrhed and yet had her naught when he would / but first he took lya and
afterward Rachell / right so each man traueylynge south fastlye in co^punccyon
by grace for synnys of the worldle and of ye flesh to serve god in cle^nes of
good living / has great desire to have rachell yt is for to have rest i^
ghostly swetnes in devotion and contemplacyon / for it is so fair / and so
lovely / and in hope for to have that life oonly he dysposyth him to serve our
Lord with all his might / but often when he wend to have had Rachell / yt is
rest in devotion / our Lord suffered him to be a said well in traueyle with lya
/ yt is either with te^ptacyons of the world or else of ye devil / or of his
flesh / or else with other worldly business bodyly or ghostlye in helping
of his even christian and when he is well trauaylyd with lya and nereho^de
overcome / than our lord geuyth him rachell yt is grace and devotion and rest
in co^cye^ce / and than has he both Rachell and Lya / So shall thou do after
ensaumple of Jacob take these two lives Actyfe / and Contemplatyfe sythen god
has sent yt both / and use yt oon with ye other By yt on life shall thou
bring forth fruit of many good dedys in help of thyn euyncryste^ / and that
is by actyfe life / and by yt other thou shall be made fair / bright / and
clean in ye souereyn bryghtnes yt is god begynner and ender of all yt is made /
and than shall thou be southfastly Jacob ouergoer / and ouercomer of all sins
/ and after this by grace of god thy name shall be chaungyd as Iacobes name was
/ and tornyd into israel / Israel is as much for to say as a Man seeing god
/ then if thou be first Jacob / and discretlye will use these two lives in
time thou shalt after be Israel that is very contemplatyfe / either in this
Life he will deliver the and make the fre fro chargys / and busynessys the
which thou art bound to / or else after this life full in ye bliss of Heuyn
/ when thou come thither / A man shall desire contemplatyfe for it is fair
and needful / therefore thou shalt aye have it in thy mind and in thy desire
/ but thou shalt have in using actyfe life for it is so needful and so
spedefull / therefore if thou be put fro rest in devotion / when thou had
lever be stell thereat / either by thy children or by thy seruau^tys / or by any
of thyn even christian for her profit or ese of her hertys skylfully asked be
not angry with them / ne heavy ne dredefull as though god would be wroth with
the yt thou leuyst him for any other thing / for it is not so / leave of
lightly thy devotion whether it be in prayer or medytacyon and goo do thy deed
and thy service to thyn euencrysten as lightly as our lord him self bade ye
do so / and suffer mekely for his Love without grutchynge if thou may do both
with out disease and trowblynge of thyn heart by cause of medlyng of such busynes.

That a man shall sometime have the more devotion when he has be lettyd by
outward werkys. Ca. ix.
FOr it may fall sometime that the more trowblynge that thou haste outward
with actyfe werkys the more brennynge desire thou shalt have to god / and the
more clear syghte of ghostly things by grace of our Lord in devotion when
thou co^mest thereto / for it fa^yth thereby as if thou had a little cole and
thou would make a fire therewith and make it to brenne / thou would first
ley to styckys and over hyle the cole with the styckys nevertheless when thou
haste abyden a while and afterward blowest a little / anon shall spring out a
great flame of fire / for the styckys are all turnyd to fire / Right so is
ghostly thy will and thy desire yt thou have to god / it is as it were a little
cole of fire in thy soul / for it geuyth to the some what of light / and of
ghostly hete / but it is but lytyl For often it waryth cold / and turnyth to
flesshly rest / and sometime into Idelnes therefore it is good yt thou put to
styckys that are good werkys of actyfe life / and though it be so yt these
werkys as it semyth for a time let thy desire yt it may not be so clean / ne so
fervent as thou would be not to dredefull therefore / but abide and suffer a
while / and so blow at ye fire yt is first goo and do thy werkys / and after
goo than alone to thy prayers and medytacions / and lift up thy heart to god /
and pray him of his goodness yt he will accept thy werkys yt thou do to his
plesau^ce and hold the then as naught in thy own sight but only at his mercy
/ be a known mekely thy wretchydnes / and thy fraylte and arecte southfastly
thy good dodys to him i^ as much as they are good / and i^ as much as they are
bade and not done dyscretly with all cyrcu^staucys yt are nedeful to a good deed
forde fault of discrecion put them to thy self / and tha^ for this mekenes
shall all thy good dedys turn into a flaine of fire / as styckys is laid up
on a cole / and so shall thy good dedys outward not hyndre thy deuocyo^ but
rather make it more / and more over our lord says i^ holy wryt thus. Ignis in
altari meo semper ardebit and sacerdos surge^s mane subiciet li^gna vt ignis
no^ exti^guarur / Fire shall ever bre^ in mine auter and the priest rysynge at
morrow shall put under stickis yt it be not que^chyd / this fire is love and
desire to god i^ a soul / yt which louyth for to be norisshyd and kept by
laye^ge to ye styckis yt it go not out / these stickis are of diverse matters some
are of a tree and some are of an other / a man yt is letteryd and has
understanding of holy wryt if he have this fire of devotion in his heart / it
is good to him to get him styckys of holy ensaumples and devout prayers and
norysshe the fire with them / An other man vnletteryd may not so redely have at
his hand holy writ ne doctors sayingys / and therefore it nedyth to him for
to do many good dedys outward to his euyncrysten and kyndel the fire of love
with them / And so it is good that each man in his degree after yt he is
dysposyd that he get him styckys of o thing or of other / either Prayers / or
medytacyons / or redynge in holy wryt or good bodily werkys for to norysshe the
fire of love in his soul that it be not quenchyd for yt affection of love is
tender and lightly will vanysshe away but if it be well kept / and by good
dedys bodyly / and ghostly co^tynuelly norysshed / Now than sythen our lord
has sent into thyn heart a lytyl spark of this blessed fire yt is him self
as holy writ says. Dominus noster ignis consumens est. Our lord god is
fire wasting / for as bodily fire wastyth all Bodyly thing that may be wastyd
/ right so ghostly fire that is god wastyth all manner of sin / and therefore
our Lord is lykenyd to fire wasting / I pray the norysshe this fire this
fire is naught else but love and charity / this has he sent into the earth as
he says in the gospel (Ignem veni mittere in terra^ and ad quid nisi vt
ardeat) I am comen to send fire into the earth / and whereto but that it should
Brenne that is god has sent fire of / Love and a good desire / and a great
will for to please him into mannys soul / and unto this end that after that a
man shall know it he may the better keep it and norysshe it and strength it /
and thereby be sauyd / the more desire that thou have to him and for him / the
more is the fire of Love in the / and the less that this desire is in the /
the less is the Fire / the mesure of this desire how much it is neither in
thy self or any other knoweste thou not / ne any man of him self but god
oonly that gyuyth it / and therefore dyspute not with thy self as though thou
would know how much thy desire is / be busy for to desire as much as thou
may / but not for to wit the mesure of thy desire.

What is desire to god for him self. Ca. x.
Saint augustyne says that the life of every good christian man is a co^tynuell
desire to god / and that is of great virtue / for it is a great cryenge in the
erys of god the feruentlyer thou desyrest / the higher thou cryest the better
thou prayest ye wyslyer thou thynkyst / and what is this desire / southly
nothing but lothynge of all this worldys bliss of all flesshly liking in thy
heart / a wonderful loving with a restfull yernynge of endlesblysse and
heavenly Joy / this thing may be called a desire to god for him self / if
thou have this desire as I hope sykerly yt thou have / I pray the keep it well
/ and nourysshe it wisely / and when thou shall pray or think make this desire
beginning and ending of all thy work for to encreace it / look after none
other feeling in thy Bodylye wittys / ne seek after none other bodyly swetnes
neither sownynge ne sauourynge / ne wonderful light / ne aungells sight / ne
though our Lord him self as unto thy sight would apere to the Bodylye /
charge it but a little but that all thy busynes be that thou myghtest feel
south fastly in thy thought a lothynge and a full forsakynge of all manner of
sin / and all manner of uncleanness with a ghost lyesyght of it / how foul /
how vglye / and how paynfull it is / and that thou myghtest have a mighty
desiring to virtues and to mekenes / and to charity / and to the bliss of
heuyn / this thinks me were ghostlye comfort / and ghostlye swetnes in
mannys Soul / as for to have clennes in concyence fro wyckydnes of all wordly
vanyte with stable truth / meke hope / and full desire to god / how so ever
that it be of other comfortys / and swetnessys.

That in clennes of Concyence is the very comfort and swetnesse. Ca. xi.
ME thynkyth that that swetnes is syker and southfast that is felyd in clennes
of conscience by mighty forsakynge / and lothyng of all sin / and with
inward syghte / and fervent desire of ghostly thyngys / All other comfortys /
and swetnessys of any manner of feeling but if they help and led to this end
/ that is to clennes of co^cyence and ghostly desire of god / are not syker to
rest on But now askyste thou whether this desire be love to god as unto this I
say that this desire is not properly love / but it is a beginning / and a
tastynge of love / For love properlye is a full cowpelynge of the lover and
they louyd together / as god and a soul into one / This cowpelynge may not be
fully had in this life but oonly in desire and longing thereto as by this
Ensaumple / if a man love another man which is absent / he desyryth greatly
his presence / Right so ghostly as long as we are in this life our Lord is
absent fro us that we may neither se him / ne here him / ne feel him as he is /
and therefore we may not have ye use of this full love here in full liking /
but we may have a desire / and a great yernynge for to be present to him for to
se him in his Bliss / and fully for to be onyd to him i^ Love / this desire
may we have of his gift i^ this life / by the which we shall be safe / for it
is Love unto him as it may be had here / thus Saint Poule says.

Scientes qm^ dum sumus in hoc corpore peregrinamura dn^o perfidem enim
ambulamus and non persp^em: audemus autem and bonam voluntatem habemus magis
peregrinari a corpore and presents esse ad deum: and iam co^cedimus sieve
absentes sieve presents placere illi. Saint Poule fayeth that as long as we
are in this body / we are Pilgrims fro our Lord that is we are absent fro
Heaven in this excyle we goo by trougth not by sight / that is we live in troth
not in bodyly feeling / we dare and we have a good will to be absent fro the
body and be present to god / that is we for clennesse in Concyence and syker
trust of salvation dare desire partyng fro our body by Bodily death / and be
present to our Lord / Nevertheless for we may not yet therefore we strive
whether we be absente / or present for to please him / that is we strive
ayenste Synues of the world / and liking of the flessh by desire to him / for
to bren in the fire of desire all thing that lettyth us fro him / But yet
askyste thou me / may a man have this desire in his Heart contynuslly / the
thynkyth nay as unto this I may say as me thynkyth that this desire may be
had as for virtue / and profit of it in Heart contynuelly / but not in
werkynge / ne using as by this ensau^ple if thou were seek thou sholdeste have
as each man has a kyndely desire of bodily hele contynuelly in thy heart what
that thou dyddest whether thou sleep / or wake but not aye I like / for it thou
sleep / or wake and thynkest on some worldly things / than thou haste thy
desire in heart oonly and not in werkynge / but when thou thynkyst on thy
Bodylye syknes and on thy hele / than thou have it i^vsynge / right so it is
ghostly of desire to god he yt has this desire of ye gift of god if he sleep
or else think not on god / but on worldly things / yet he has this desire
i^ heart / in his soul till yt he syn dedely / but anon as he thynkyth on god
/ or on clennes of living or of Joys of Heaven / thanne werkyth his desire to
god as long as he kepyth his thought / and his intent to please god either in
Prayers / or in medytacion / or i^ any other good deed of actyfe life / then it
is good that all our busynes before to stere this desire and use it by
dyscrecyon now in oon deed / now in an other after he is dysposyd / and has
grace thereto / this desire is root of all thy werkynge if it be me defull /
for wit thou well what good deed that thou do est for god bodyly / or
ghostlye / it is an using of this desire / and when thou Prayest / or thynkest
doubt not than if thou desire god / and therefore when thou do a good deed or
thynkyst on god / dout not thinking in thy heart whether thou desyrest or not
/ For thy deed shewyth thy desyry / Some are vncunnynge / and wene that they
desire not god but if they ever be cryenge on god with wordys of of their
mouth / or else i^ their heart as if they said thus Lord make me safe / or
else such other / these wordys ar good whether they be said with the mothe /
or fourmyd in the heart / for they styre a man's heart to desiring of god /
But nevertheless without any such wordys a clean thought of god / or of any
ghostlye thing of virtues or of the manhed of Christ / or of the Joys of heuyn
or of understanding of holy writ with love / may be bette^ than such wordys
for a clean thought of god is southfast desire to him and the more ghostly that
the thought is / the more is thy desire / therefore be thou not i^ doubt wha^
thou Prayest / or Thynkyste on god / or else when thou do other outward
good dedys to thy Euencrysten / whether thou desyryst him or not / For thy
dedys show it / Nevertheless though it be so that all thy good dedys
Bodylye / and ghostlye are a showing of thy desire to god / yet is there
dyuersyte betwyt ghostly dedys and bodyly / for dedys of contemplaty flyfe are
not so outward and therefore wha^ thou prayest / or thynkyst on god thy desire
to god is more hole / more feruente / more ghostlye than when thou do other
dedys to thy euencrysten / now if thou ask how thou shall keep this desire /
and norysshe it a little shall I tell the / not that thou shalt use the same
form as I say / but that thou should have thereby if need be some Warning /
and techynge for to rule the in that Occupacyon / For I may not / ne I can not
tell the fully what is best to the for to use / but I shall say the somewhat as
me thynkyth.

How thou shall dyspose the to devotion. Ca. xii.
IN nyghtys after thy sleep / if thou will rise for to pray / and serve thy
Lord / thou shall feel thy self first flesshely / heavy / and sometime lusty /
than shalt thou dyspose the for to pray or to think some good thought for to
quyckyn thy heart to god and set all thy busynes for to draw up thy thought
fro worldly vanytes and fro vain Imagynacyon yt fallyth into thy mind yt thou
may feel some devotion in thy saying / or else if thou wylt think on
ghostlye things yt thou be not lettyd with such vain though tys of the world
/ or of thy flesh / in thinking there are many manner of medytacyons which are
best to the can I not say / But I hope that that thought by the which thou
felyst most sauoure / and most rest in / for the time is best to the / thou
may if thou will sometime think on thy sins before done / and of thy
frayltees that thou fallyst in each day / and ask mercy and forgyuenes for
them. Also after this thou may think on the frayltes the synnys and the
wretchydnes of thy euencrysten bodyly / and ghostly with pity and compassyon of
them / and ask merrye / and forgyuenes for them as tenderly as for thy self /
and as thou haddyst done them / and that is a good thought For I tell the
forsooth thou may make of other mennis Synnys a precious oyntement for to
hele thy own soul when thou have mind on them with compassyon and sorrow for
them / this oyntement is precious though the spycery of it be not clean / For
it is tryacle made of venym for to destroy venym / that is for to say thy
own Sins / and othermennys Synnys / if thou beat them with sorrow of heart
/ Pity / and Compassyon / they turn into tryacle which makyth thy soul hole
fro pride / and envy / and bryngyth in Love / and Charity to thy euencrysten /
this thought is good sometime for to have.

How a man shall have mind on crystes manhed / and of his passion. Ca. xiii.
ALso thou may have mind on the manhed of out Lord in his birth and in
his passion or in any of his werkys and feed thy thought with ghostly
Imagynacyons of it for to stere thy affection more to the Love of him. This
thoutht is good / and spedefull / namelye when it comes freelye of goddys
gift with devotion and feruoure of the spyryte / else a man may not light
lie have sauoure / ne devotion in it / I hold it not spedefull to a man for to
prese than to much thereupon as if he would get it by maystry / for he shall
mow break his head and his body to / and he shall never be the nere / therefore
me thynkyth unto the it is good for to have in mind his manhed sometime / and
if devotion come withal and sauoure / keep it and follow it for a time / but
leave of soon / and hang not long thereupon / Also if devotion comme not with
mind of the passion strive not / ne prese not to much thereafter / take easily
what will come and goo forth to some other thought.

How a man shall think on Uertues / and on sayntys. Ca. xiiii.
ALso other thoughtys there are yt ben more ghost lie as for to think on
virtues and for to se by light of understanding the Virtue of mekenes / what
it is and how a man should be meke / And also what is pacyence clennes /
ryghtwysnes / charity / chastyte / and sobyrte and such other and how a man
should get all these virtues / and by such thoughtys for to have great desire
/ and longing to these virtues for to have them / and also for to have a
ghostly sight of the pryncypall virtues as of truth / hope and charity. By
the sight and desire of these virtues a soul should mow se / and feel much
grace of our Lord / withouten which grace a man's soul is half blind and
withouten sauoure or ghostly swetnes / Also for to think on sayntys / as the
apostles martyrs / confessourys and holy vyrgyns / behold inwardlye the holy
living / the grace / and the virtues that our Lord gave them their living
/ and by the mind of this styre thy own heart for to take ensaumple of them
unto better living.

Of our Lady and of our Lord Ihesu how a man shall behold their holiness. Ca.
xv.
ALso the mind of our Lady saint mary above all other sayntys / for to se with
thy ghostlye eye / the abundaunce of grace in her holy soul when she was here
living yt our lord gave her alone passing all other sayntys / for she was
fulfyllyd with all virtues without wem of sin showing full mekenes and
perfyte charity / and fully with these the fayrnesse of all other virtues so
holly that there might no styrynge of Pride / ne Envy / ne wroth / ne
flesshlye liking / ne no manner of Sin enter into her heart ne defoule ye
soul i^ any perte of it / by ye beholdynge of the fayrehed of this blessed
soul might a mannys heart be styryd into ghostly comfort greatly / And much
more thanne above this is the beholdynge of the soul of our lord Ihesu which
was fully onyd to the godhed / passing with out comparyson / our Lady and all
other creatures / For in the person of Ihesu are two Kings that is god / and
man fully onyd together / By ye vtue of this blesfull onynge which may not be
told ne co^ceyuyd by mannys wit the soul of Ihesu has receyuyd the full
head of wisdom / and love / and all goodness as the Apostle says. Plenitudo
diuinitatis inhabitat in Cristo corporaliter. That is the godhed was onyd fully
to the manhed in the soul of Ihesu / and so by the soul dwelling in the body
/ the mind of the manhed of our Lord was Illumynyd above all other that been /
or shall be / and upon this wise for to behold the virtues and the over passing
grace of the soul of Ihesu / shall be right comfortable to a mannys soul.

Of beholdynge of the might / the wysdom / the goodness and the mercy of god in
his creatures* Ca. xvi.
ALso the mind of ye might / the wisdom / and goodness of our lord in all his
creaturys / for as much as we may not see god fully in himself here living
/ therefore we should behold love / dread / and wonder / his might / his
wisdom / and his goodness in his werkys / and in his creatures / Also for to
think on the mercy of our Lord that he has showed to me / and to the / and
to all Sinful captyues that have been combryd in Sin and spared so long in
the deuyllys prysone / how our Lord pacyently suffryd us live in our Sin
and took no ve^geau^ce on us as he might have done ryghtwyslye / and put us
into Hell if his Love had not lettyd him / but for Love he spared us / He had
pytte on us and sent his grace into our hertys and called us out of our Sin
/ and by his grace has tournyd our will holly to him / And for to have him and
for his love to forsake all manner of Sin / The mind of his mercy / and of
his goodness with other cyrcumstauncys / moo than I can or may rehearse now
bring into a soul great trust of our Lord / and full hope of salvation / and
kyndelyth the desire of Love myghtyly to the Joys of Heaven.

How the mind of the wretchydnes and of peryllys of this world make a soul
to desire to Heaven. Ca. xvii.
ALso for to think on the Wretchydnes / Myscheues / and peryllys Bodyly / and
ghostly that fall in this Life / and after for to think on the Joys of Heaven
how much bliss there is and Joy / for there is neither Sin / ne sorrow /
ne passion / ne pain / hunger / ne thyrste / sore / ne sykenes / dowte / ne
dread / shame / ne shenshyp / ne defaute of might / lacking of light / ne
wantynge of love / but there is sovereign fayrehed / lyghtenes stre^ghte / hele
/ liking / aye lasting wysdom / love / peace worship / sykernes / rest / joy
/ and bliss Enough ever with outen end / the more that thou thynkyste / and
felyste the wretchydnes of this life / the more ferue^tly shall thou desire the
joy / and the rest of the bliss of Heuyn / Many men are covetous of worldly
worshyppes and erthly riches and think now dremynge / now waking / how and
by what meanys they might come thereto and therefore they forgete the mind of
themself / and the peynys of hell / and the Joys of heuyn / southlye they are
not wise / they are like to Children that run after butterflyes / and for
they look not to their feet / they fall sometime sone down and break their
leggys / what is all the pomp / and the worship of this world i^ riches / or
in iolyte but a butterfly / southly no thing else / and yet much less /
therefore I pray the be thou coueytous of the Joys of Heuyn / and thou shall
have worship / and richesse that ever shall last / for at ye last end when
worldly coueytous men bring no good in their hondys for all their worshyppes /
and all their Rychessys are tornyd into naught / save sorrow and pain / than
shall worldly men yt forsake trewely all vain worshyppys / and rychessys of
this world / or else if they have richesse / and worshyppys they set naught
by them / ne they set not their Love / ne liking in them but live ever in
dread / and in mekenes / and in hope / and sometime in sorrow and abide the
mercy of god pacyently they shall thanne have fully that they here coueytyd /
for they shall be crownyd as kings and s^ye up with our Lord Ihesu into the
bliss of Heaven / Also there be many other medytacyons mo than I can say which
that god puts into a mannys mind for to styre the affection / and the
reason of mannys soul to loathe vanytees of this world / and for to desire the
Joys of Heuyn. These words I say not to the as I had fully showed ye manner of
medytacyons as they are wrought in a mannys soul / but I touch them to the a
little that thou myghteste by this have more understanding.

How a man shall do when he felyth no sauoure ne comfort in his medytacyons.
Ca. xviii.
Nevertheless me thynkyth it is good to the y^ wha^ thou dysposyst the to
think on god as I have before said or on otherwise and peraue^ture thou
felyst no sauoure ne devotion in thy thinking but only a nakyd mind and a
weke will / yt thou would feign think on god / but thou canste not / than I
hope it is good to the yt thou strive not to much with thy self for thou
myghtest so lightly fall into more derknes but if thou were more s^ye in thy
werkynge / and therefore I hold it then most syker unto the for to say thy
paternoster and thy Aue / or else thy matens / or else for to read upon thy
saulter / for that is evermore a syker standarde yt will not fail / who so
may cleue thereto he shall not err / and if thou may by thy prayer get
devotion / look than if this devotion be only in affection that is to say in
great desire to god with ghostly delight / hold forth than thy saying and break
not lightly of / for often it fallyth that prayenge with ye mouth / getyth and
kepyth devotion / and if a man cease of saying / devotion vanyssheth away /
Nevertheless if devotion of prayers bring into thy Heart a devout thought of
the manhed of our Lord or of any of the other beforesayde / and this thought
should be lettyd by thy saying than may thou cease of thy saying / and
occupy the with medytacyon till it pass away.

Where of a man nedyth to be ware i^ meditacio^. ca. xix.
BUt of certain things the behouyth to be ware in thy medytacyons sum shall
I tell the / One is when thou haste had a ghostly thought or Imagynacyon of
the manhed of our Lord or of such bodyly things / and thy soul has been
co^fortyd and fed therwyth / and it passyth away by the self / be not to busy
to hold it still with maystry / for it is than turned to pain and to
bytternes / Also if it pass not away but dwell still in thy mind without any
traueyle of thy self / and thou for comfort of it will not leave it / and
therefore it reuyth the of thy sleep in nyghtys / or else in days fro other
good dedys / or else for great feruoure of thy body / thy body or thy hedde
fallyth into great febylnes / Than shall thou wylfully break of when time
commyth / sometime when thou haste most devotion and were lotheste for to
leave it as when it passyth reasonable time or else it turns to disease of
thyn euencrysten / But if thou do so thou do not well as me thinks ne
wisely neither / a worldly man or woman that felyth not perauenture devotion
twyse in a year if he feel by the grace of our lord Ihesu great co^punccyon
for his Synnys / or else have mind on the passion of our Lord / if he were
put fro his sleep / and his rest a night / or two / or three until his Head
work / it is no force / for it commyth to them but seldom / But to the or to
an other man that has the man^r of werkynge in custom as it were each other
day / it is spedefull for to have dyscrecyon in your werkynge and not fully
fall thereto for to follow it as much as will come / and I hold yt it is good
to the to use this manner in what devotion yt thou he that thou hang not to
long thereupon either to put y^ fro thy mete / or fro thy sleep in time / or
for to disease any other man vnskylfully / the wise man says thus (Omnia
tempus habent) all things have time / Another thing that the behouyth to be
ware of is this / wha^ thy thought has been occupied in Imagynacyon of the
Manhed of our Lord / or in any such other / and after this thou art busy
with all the desire of thy Heart for to seek knowing / or feeling more
ghostlye of the godhed / prese not to much thereon / ne suffer not thy desire /
ne thy Heart tarry to long there in / as if thou were abiding after some
quaynte styrynge / or wonderful feeling other than thou haste had before time
/ thou shalt not do so / it is enough to the and to me for to have a desire /
and a longing to our lord / and if he will of his grace frelye over this
desire send us of his ghostlye light / and open our ghostlye eye for to know
more of him than we have had before by common traueyle / thank we him thereof
/ and if he will not for we are not yet meke Inoughe / or else we are not
dysposyd by clennes of living in othersydes to receive that grace / thanne
shall we mekely know our own wretchydnes and hold us paid with desire that
we have to him and with other co^myn thoughtys that now lightly fall under our
Imagynacyon / as of our Sins / or Crystes passion / or such other / or else
with prayers / or of the Sauter / or some other / and love him with all our
heart that he woll give us any part of his grace / And if thou do otherwise
thou may lyghtlye be begylyd by the spyryt of error for thy presumpcyon /
for it is great folly a man by his own wit for to prese so much into
ghostlye things / but if he felyd plente of grace / for the wise man says
(Scrutator maiestatis opprimetur a glorya) That is to say a ransaker of the
might of god and of his mageste / without great clennes and mekenes shall be
ouerleyde and oppressyd in him self / and therefore the wise man says in a
another place on this wise. Alciora te ne quesieris et forciorate ne scrutatus
fueris. That is for to say / High things that are above thy wit and thy
reason seek not / and great things that are above thy might ransake not / By
these wordys the wise man forbedyth not utterly for to seek / and ransake
ghostlye and heavenly thyngys / but he forbid death us yt as long as we are
flesshlye and not clensyd fro vain love of the world that we take not upon us
by our own traueyle ne by our own wit for to ransake or to feel ghostlye
things / ne though we feel ghostlye thyngys and great feruoure of the love of
god so much that we set at naught all erthlye things / and us thynkyth that
we would for goddys love forsake all the Joys and all the welthe of this
world / yet are we not anon able and ready for to seek and behold ghostlye
things that are above us until our soul be made sotyll and till it be made
sad and stable in virtues by process of time and encreasynge of grace / for
asseynt gregory says / no man sodaynelye is made souerayn in grace / but fro
little he begynnyth and by process waxyth until he be perfyte. Amen.
