Here begynnethe the glorious life and passion of seint Albon prothomartyr of
England / and also the life and passion of saint Amphabel / which converted
saint Albon to the faith of Christ.



TO call Clio my dullness to redress
with all systers dwelling at Elicon
what might avail to write the perfytenes
Of the holy martyr slain full yore agone
For Christis faith / the holy man Albon
Called of right through every regyon
Prothomartyr of Brutis Albion
I not acqueynted with muses of Maro
Nor with metris of Lucan / nor Virgile
Nor sugared deties of Tullius Cicero
Nor of Homerus to follow the ^^esshe style
Crooked to clymbe over so high a style
Or for to follow the steps aureate
Of Fraunces Petrake the poet laureate
The golden trompet^^ the house of fame
with full swyfte wings of the pegasee
Has full far the knyghtly man's name
Borne in Verolame a famous old city
Knyghthode in Rome the cronycle who list se
Aand as I find this young lusty man
Took first order by Dyoclesyan
whose life to write / of wit I am barayne
His high perfection curyously to tell
Dredyng my labor should be in vain
That never drank of Pegaseus well
But for his goodness so hyghly does excel
I stand in hope his influence shall shine
My tremblyng pen by grace to enlumyne
In tender age this goodly young Albon
Borne as is said in Brutis Albion
A lords son more lykely was there none
To marciall prowes by disposition
which for his person as made is mention
For conditions and high birth of blood
In great favor of all the land he stood
And for that he in virtue did excel
Beloved and cherysshed of every manner man
By king Seuerus mine auctor can well tell
Sent unto Rome to Dioclesyan
with a young prince called Bassian
They both tweyne as the statute bond
To be made knyghtis of his own hand
with them also went Amphybalus
There baptized by pope zepheryne
Left all the world and becam virtuous
Of wylfull power followed the doctrine
By whose reachyng and virtuous discipline
Blessed Albon as mine auctor says
was afterward converted to our faith
All his process in order for to set
My purpose is / if I have time and space
If ignorance not my style let
By influence only of gods grace
The troubly mystes from me to enchace
Of rude langage / so that I may in deed
To write his life and ceryously proceed
Under supporte of this martyr benygne
My pen direct by mean of his prayer
The gracious stremes sent down for a sign
Of his celestyall goodly eien clear
To forther my labor and teach me the manner
Of his name to write and specify
So as I can the ethymologie
This name Albanus by enterpretation
Compowned is of plente and of whytnes
Plente he had in great perfection
Made white also with lylyes of clennesse
with white roses meant stable in their rudeness
It was well seen that he stable stood
For Christis faith / when paynyms shed his blood
which two colors did never fade
Of these lylyes nor of these roses read
In blessed Albon but ever ylyche glad
within his bapteme the lylyes did sprede
The roses splayed when he did shede
His purpurate blood spared for no death
The storm abydyng till he yafe up the breath
Thus was the chapelet made of red and white
white for his clennes I have so told aforne
To chese the red he did also delight
when from the chafe was tried whete corn
In the holy martyr that has the bront borne
Grain of this frument was this man Albon
In the gospel remembered of saint John
This chose greyne for Christ was mortified
To get increase of his eternal glory
The fruit grew up by faith multipliplied
Through meke sufferance he gate the victory
A palure of conquest to be put in memory
A lauret crown by tryumphes many fold
For his merits set on his head of gold
Now to this martyr crowned high in heaven
Devoutly knelyng with humble and meke visage
which sit so high above the sterres seven
O blessed Albon / fro that celestial stage
Cast down thy light to enlumyne my langage
which of my self am naked and bateyne
In this great need thy favor may be seyne
I have no colors / but only black and white
Of long or short wantyng proporcion
where ought does fail / I must bear the wit
Gold nor asure / nor fresshe vermylyon
But with thy gracious supportation
In hope thou shalt conueye my pen and led
To write thy life / thus I will proceed.
Explicit prologus.
Time remembered of old antiquite
The same time when Caesar Julius
was was passed out of Rome the cite
Over the Alpeys in knyghthode famous
By assent of fortune notable and glorious
This marciall man armed with plate and mayle
Had over ryden the bounds of Itayle
Brought the countres through his high renown
Magre their might to stand in obeisance
And ben subjects to them of Rome town
All Germany conquered in substance
Down descendyng in to the realm of France
Daunted their pride / and after did ordeyne
with a great army to aryne up in Briteyne
Twyes put of by record of Lucane
At his arryuayle / of very force and might
By the prowess of Cassybylan
Touching the title were it wrong or right
Of the said Caesar deem every manner wight
what that him lust / for inconclusyon
Cause of his enter / was false deuisyon
Among them self / whereby he gat that land
Made the Britons to be tributarie
To the Romans by statute and by bond
None so hardy / to be thereto contrary
Cause of this conquest / to write and not tarry
was division / the cronycle ye may se
Between Cassybylan / and duke Audrogee
Ouermaistred was Brutus Albion
By Iulyus sword remembered in scripture
Record the gospel where is division
Froward discention of case or adventure
That region may no while endure
In prosperity / for by discord and tweyne
To subjection was brought all Bryteyne
when Caesar was put in possessyon
Rather by force than by tytell or right
Ordent statutes in that regyon
And this was one / that no manner wight
Sulde in that land receive thorder of knight
For worthynes / for mede / nor favor
But by the hands of the emperor
And this was done / lest parauenture
Sundry persons enclothed with rudenes
Not disposed of blood nor of nature
Should not presume of rural boystousnes
Though he had strength and hardynes
To take upon him / what ever that he be
The sacrament of knyghtly dignite
An other cause in order to devise
was / none such should have governance
whereby he might in many sundry wise
Catch occasyon to make purueyance
By force of kynred / or strength of alliance
Through new rebellyon in token word or sign
Against the Romans proudely to malinge
And in such case / occasions to eschew
The prudent Romans / castyng all thing toforne
For comun profit / thought it was most dew
Of high estate / nor low degree borne
No man should / but if he were sworn
To the Romans / with heart body / and might
Ay to be true / that should be made a knight.
By a decree / concludyng in sentence
with faith assured / as she statute bond
First they should appear in the presence
Of the emperor / sent thither of each land
Than take their oath / next by touch of hand
Toforne the gods / assurance made of new
For life or death / to the emperor to be true.
This statute kept in every region
Being subject to Rome the city /
Stretchynge their lordshyp and dominion
with their Imperial marciall dignity
Over the bounds of many country
So provided by prudent policy
To them was subject all worldly chiualry.
Having all kingdoms ready to their hand
Void of rebellion / when they had ought a do
A prince of knighthood they set in every land
For governance. A steward eke also
Every region to be ruled by hem two
In rightwisnes / laws they did ordain
From wilful surfettes / the commons to restrain.
First provided of high discretion
(As Argus iyed in their inward intent)
To se there were no werre nor conspiration
Against the Emperor / neither thought nor meant.
To redress all thing by judgment
These two estates / of prudence to attend
At prime face all outrages to amend.
It has been sayn and written here beforne
By old expert Poesy / called doctrine
without principles: Leest above the corn
The wede wex / against good grain to malign
To late among is made a medicine
when that a sore wexith ded and corrumpable
For lack of surgiens is waxen incurable.
Semblably / in kingdoms and cities
Stormy troubles for to set aside
Meued sodeinly among the comenties
At the beginning / in all haste to provide
Them to reform / no longer to abide
For first meuers / as law and right observed
Punysshe them duly / as they have deserved.
Like their deserts / receive their reward
Cherisshe the true / robbers to redress
The prince of knights / and also the steward
Ordained were / by law of rightwisnesse
As the statute plainly did express /
Like true Iuges / and kepers of the law
Of high prudence / all riot to withdraw.
And the report of Cronicles that been old
Auctorised by great aduisement
As a Diadem / or a crown of gold
Is of a king called the ornament:
So to a prince does long a garment
Frengid with gold / that people high and low
By that difference their steward might know.
The prince of knights used a pallion
For a prerogatife in especial /
He and the Steward by election
Of the emperor in party and in all
Took their charge / private and general /
No man so hardy pain of death rebel
Against their power to usurp no quarrel.
That same time was reignyng in Britain
King Seuerus / a famous knightly man
who cast him fully to do his busy pain
To please the Emperor Dioclesian
Sent his son / named Bassian
with a thousand and five hundred young of age
Lords sons / fresshe / and lusty of courage.
Some of this nombre were borne in Britain
Some in wales / and some in Cornewaile /
And among all / if I shall not fame
There was one / of stature and entaile /
As far as kind could her craft prevail
By her favor / gave to his person
A prerogatife to be set asoon.
A goodly man / and but young of age /
A princes son of wales / as I find
Called Amphiball / gracious of visage
In whom there was non error found in kind
By disposition / naught was left behind /
In mine Author / as it is compiled
To all languages his tongue was filed.
And for he was borne of high kynred
He was sent forth with notable apparaile
Like his estate / with many a rich wede
Not forgettyng harness of plate and maile
Curiously forged / after most fresshe entaile
As was most likely in every man's sight
To them that should receive the order of knight.
And while they were assembled euerichone
It was a paradise / upon hem to se /
Like as I find / among hem there was one
A lords son / excellyng in beauty
Borne in the city of Verolamy
Called Albanus / right semely of stature
To all virtue disposed by nature.
The said Albon / by descent of line
Borne to be gentill of condition
By aspectes of grace / which is divine
Predestinate by election
For to be called of his region
Prothomartyr / when he the faith has take
And shed his blood for Jesus Christ's sake.
Gracious he was in every man's sight
well beloved / and a likely man /
with his fellowship took the way aright
Toward Rome / rode with Bassian
Come to the presence of Dioclecian /
And for they weren so likely in showing
He passingly was glad of their cummynge.
A chosen people / out piked for the nones
Right well besene / and manly of their chere
Arrayed in gold / perle / and precious stones
As princes children / sovereign and intere
Them demeanynge in port and in manner
That if it shall shortly be comprehended
In them was nothing for to be amended.
This Briton people / likely for the werres
Stood in comparison amyd all nations
As does the son among heavenly sterres
Alike to their birthe weren their conditions
High blood requires through all nations
To resemble in high or low parage
Fully according / like to their lignage.
To high kynred longs high noblesse
On high mountains stand Cedrysse grene
To princes children pertains high prowess
As among stones the Ruby is most shene
The tarage of trees by the fruit is seen:
Semblably / nature did so ordeine
There to make known the blood of Britain.
Upon the Emperor this people (as I told)
were a waityng / as they were of degree /
Being pope in those days old
zepherinus / which kept in Rome his see /
And when that he beheld the great beauty
Of thls people that comen were of new
within him self / sore he began to rue.
Musing in his heart / thus he began complain
Full secretly with sighs lamentable /
Halas (quod he) this people here of Britain
In all their port and manners most notable
So fresshe / so semely / and so honorable /
Halas full often upon the day he says
why stant this people in error from our faith?
The Pope / of ruthe and compassion
Considering with merciful pity:
Ganseke ways / finding occasion
To get leyser and opportunity
How this people / excellyng in beauty
Might by his labor / through spiritual virtue
Receive baptism by grace of Christ Ihesu.
The lord above considering thentent
Of zepheryn in especial
Such a grace to him he has sent
By influence very celestial
To further his purpose / that he has Amphiball
In Christ's faith / grounded by his saw
And converted unto Christ's law.
Amphibalus. as ye have herd the case
A semely man / god being then his guide
First by the pope / when he baptized was
Left his treasure / his pomp / and his pride
For Christ's sake / with poverty chose to abide
Forsook the world kept him self secree
Of great perfection / lived in pouerte
Other there weren that made no delays
Of zepheryn / herynge his preaching
To be baptized devoutly in thoo days
But when the rumor and the knowlegyng
Came to the Emperor / without more tarienge
Through all the city commanded them be sought
To his presence / by force to be brought.
By land and see / his ministers left naught
To search hem out / but in no manner
They were not caught: but than came to ye thought
Of Dioclecian / to work as ye shall here
Them of Britain / to make them to appear /
Upon a morrow / when Phoebus shone full bright
They of his hand to take order of knight
Of antiquity / as put is in memory:
when the emperor should knights make
They did assemble beside an oratory
That reised was / and bylt for martis sake /
In whose worship all night they should wake.
The next morrow / after the manner
At Phoebus vprist / they should appear
The oratory in compass round and large
Beside a temple of Bellona the goddess
where Dioclecian should give first the charge
Of hole assurance to avoid all doublenes
First to keep their bodies in clennesse
For life or death / both in peace and werre
The common profit of thempire to prefer
Next this charge / the emperor anon right
In all his most imperial majesty
Like their rightes girt them with swords bright
So as they weren of state and of degree
Obseruaunces kept of authority
First chargynge them that they should entende
Chiefly their gods to worship and defend.
Of their temples to save the liberties
Prestes of that law in right to make strong
wydowes / maidens / pore folk in cities
Suffer in no wise no man to do them wrong
Appease debates that have endured long
For comun profit / as most sovereign good
In their defense / ready to spend their blood.
withdraw their hand from lucre and couetise
Specially to eschewen idleness
Pursue arms for knightly exercise
In causes known / grounded on rightwisnes
Give their Eaptaines such truth and stablenes
And in such case / rather knightly dye
Than their statutes to break or disobey.
Of common profit devised an image
Called Knighthood / an arm of their defense
To hold up truth / suffer non outrage
Cherishe the pore / do no violence /
After their wages / govern their expense
Full assurance / made with mouth and hand
Sustain truth / both on see and land.
Make providence that no derision
Fall unawarely on high or low estate /
which caused has / great dissolution
Made many a region to be unfortunate /
For where as a strife continues / or debate
By experience of many great city
The light is eclipsed of their felicity.
Of old custom / knighthood took non head
Unto their own singular avail
withdrew their hand from guerdon and fro mede
wrought nothing but by wise counsel
The head of matters peysed with the tail
This is to saine / there should no Roman knight
Begin no quarrel / nor end against right.
For the Romans in their election.
Chose to that order / folk just and stable
Manly of heart and of condition
Sober / not hasty / feithfull / honorable
For common profit preued profitable
Benign of port / not proud / but debonaire
That word and work for nothing be contratre
Take no quarrel grounded on falshed
Specially the pore not to oppress
Flee Tyranny / eschew blood to shed
Of innocents by wilful sturdynesse
Blood cries vengeance to god of rightwisnesse
Falls homicides / contrary to nature
God suffers them no while for to endure
All thing odible to every gentill knight
Hateful murder not support nor maintain
Their office is / as they are bound of right
Maidens / widows / and pore folk to sustain
Fraud and extorcion anon while it it is grene
In knightly wise to search out the offense
And chastise it by marciall violence.
Then tongue and heart by one accord shall draw
On their promise steadfastly to abide
Of antiquity / Romans set a law
To punisshe perjury / spare non homicide
Repress of Tirauntes the vengeable pride
If need fall / their life and blood to spend
The right of gods and temples to defend
In token whereof / who took thorder of knight
This was the usage of old antiquity
He should first be shave of very right
Token to avoid all superfluity
Of vicious living / and all dishonestie
Shaven away by virtuous diligence
All old outrages out of their consciences.
They had of custom also this manner
Roman knights of years young and grene
To enter a bath of water cristall clear
From all ordures to wasshe their bodies clean
which bath / plainly it did mean /
As books old / notably don express
Unto knighthode longs all clennesse
First / specially by attemperaunce
Void all surfettes / live in soberness
By prudence and virtuous governance /
Maintain truth / chastise all falsnesse
Restreine their courage from riotous excess
Dishonest speech / and ribaudry to flee
Eschew auoutry / live chaste like their degree.
Clennesse longs to every gentill knight
As their bathyng does plainly specify
Through their perfection / was made to Mars aright
whilom Romans by prudent policy
Had in custom their bodies to apply
To serve Diana / that was the cast goddess
That Venus had with them non intraunce.
Venus / to virtues contrarious
Causes in youth flesshely insolence
Gives great occasion to folks courageous
Of their nature loves riot and exspence
withdraws in knighthode marciall diligence
For which the bathe was made for a figure
To wasshe away of Venus all ordure.
If they be wedded / hold them to their wives /
If they be syngle / no woman to opresse
For in such case began the blody strives
Between Troy and Greeks / the story berith witness
Caused many a knight to dye in distress
For by thauoutry of Paris and Eleine
Greeks and Troyans their mischiefs did complain
After this bath / tokened by chastity
Fully made fair / and void of uncleanness
with a white shirte he should clothed be
To signify the chief founderesse
Of all virtues / that called is mekenes
Clean of intent / without whom certain
All other virtues stand but bareine
For who so list in books for to read
Chaste in virtue / expert for to be
Most ready way is / his purpose for to speed
Set his foundation upon humility
She berith up all / and has the souereynte
whose buildyng ever / the ground if it be sought
Goes ever upward / and descends naught.
As a shirt the body next does touch
with whose touch the body is not offended
So mekenes (on authors I me auouche)
Among virtues is souereinly commended
She and patience of one stock be discendyd
yet in some case / reken nigh and far
Peace has conqueryd more than has the werre.
By prudent writing and humble patience
King Dindinus was not recheles
To notify the surquidrous science
Of Alisaunder / through mekenes doubtless
To Brigmannus / mekenes brought in peace
Meke language appeasyd the rygour
Of this foresaid famous conqueror.
which considered / the Romans understood
This noble virtue of humility
was in some case needful to knighthode
Most expedient to every comontie
Them to preserve long in prosperity
Very mekenes used in prudent wise
Is not atwited with no cowardice
As to knighthode longs gentilnes
Thing appropried to his religion
Void of surfettes / founded on mekenes
As a lamb in chamber in bataile a lion
where place and time gave just occasion
By manly suffraunce / benign of face and chere
And play the lion when time does require.
By the process of their obseruaunces
Next the shirt of mekenes for more speed
They had a custom / with sundry circumstaunces
Of high prowess from hem to avoid dread
In a mantell / for to be clad of read
To recompense the white shirt of meekness
with Martis color / by knightly high prowess.
This read mantell / so as the matter stood
Touching the color / did plaiinly specify
They should not dread for to spend their blood
For common profit upon any party
By profession of their chivalry
For this cause to avoid all dread
They vsyd of custom a mantell of fine read
This color read / token of high prowess
To sustain and hold up truth and right
Nor entremete of wrongs nor falsnesse
For love nor hate of no manner wight
To no party / for favor cast their sight
Indifferent / stand egall as a line
By non occasion to wrong to decline
A thing far of / fro knightly desires
Strange and foreign to their professions
For to appear at cessions or at shires
By maintenance of falls extorcions
Or to supporte by their protections
Causes unlawful / by brocage surmitted beforne
To make Iurrours falsely to be forsworn.
A thing (god wot) this day to much abused
Experience in deed as it is saine
They have no color of right to be excused
Save to their client / the party to sustain
But if they had before ben wasshen clean
Bathyd as I said / in virtues also made fair
To such places they should have no repair.
It is a manner of apostasy
A knight in peace to play the lion
Not according unto chivalry
To draw his sword / using extorcion
The pore compleine for opression
A thing contrary by signs manifold
To them that were spores of gold
Sporis of gold / round and sharp to ride
So as gold is metal most sovereign
Right so worship to knighthode is chief guide
To high noblesse / by manhood to attain
A sword also Romans did ordeyne
In four causes plainly to be draw
After the rightes of the paynym law.
As I told erste / the first for defense
Of their gods / and next for the fraunchise
Of their temples / that no violence
Be done to them in no manner wise
As far as their power and might may suffice
And the second / never to be present
where dome shall pass of falls judgment
The third point / toforne as I have told
widows / maidens / to help them in their might
Punysshe robbers / and tirauntes that been bold
To spoil the people by their froward might
This was used / when Albon was made knight
The last charge for a conclusion
Never to bear arms against Rome town.
Other articles / mo than I can tell
Told and remembryd by Dioclecian
Notable in knighthode / by them that did excel
when the emperor to dubbe hem first began
Among other / the Briton Bassian
Son of Seuerus / in Britain king
Began thus abraide his conceit declarynge.
My lord (quod he) with supporte of your grace
Sith it is pleasure to your magnificence
As ye have showed / here present in this place
Of your imperial famous excellence
Singular favor / royal diligence
As greatest lord / called on see and land
To make us knights with your own hand
Lowly besechynge to condescende and se
Of your notable prudent policy
Grant us goodly of your high majesty
The first fruits of your chiualry
Mars our patron / knightly to magnify
In your presence / with Iustes or tournay
Or some other famous marciall play
To have in arms knightly exercise
Our grene youth and courages to amend
To learn the manner and the Romain guise
In palestre / day by day to entende
So that ye list of grace to condiscende
Grant us fredom / and a place to assign
Of your imperial support most benign.
The Emperor considering first their cheres
Conde them great thank for their knightly request
And commended greatly their desires
Set a day / and held a royal feast
All nations to come at the leest
As the emperor freely did ordeine
To have adoo with knights of Britain.
with Roman knights / first they had ado
By commandment of Dioclecian
During the vtas / the story tells so
Among all Albon that knightly man
with his Cosyn called Bassian
Gree of the field given to them twain
Among Romans and knights of Britain.
Of Ficulnius came many a worthy knight
Of Spaigne / of Cipre and also of Sardine
And of Almaine / in steel armed bright
Mars was present / the field to enlumine
But among all / to the Briton line
The souerein price above euerichone
was by heraldes given to Albon.
His name worthy to be put in memory
He quit him self so like a manly knight
Granted to him the price and the victory
Through his desert / of very truth and right
Called in Rome the lantern and the light
Of knightly prowes / and Phoebus sovereign
Through all Italy / and day sterre of Britain.
Of blessed Albon / the arms in his shield
Square on his shulders by antiquity
Of fine asure sothely was the field
Therein of gold depicte was a sautree
In whose story / at Leicester who list se
After his passion / as I affirm dare
In his cote armor / king Offa sothely bare.
Of whose mynster he after was founder
As the Cronicle makes mention
A manly knight / a noble governor
In his days / through many a region
His name sprad / and his high renown
Under these arms / as put is in memory
In every field had always the victory.
Aforne provided (I trow of yore agoon)
By grace of god and heavenly influence
And by the merit of the glorious saint Albon
Had in knighthood marciall excellence
And for to acquit him by virtuous providence
To this martyr / called saint Albon
Of that minster laid the first stoon.
After whose hand / masons did wyrche
He bare the cost / of great devotion
The said arms he left unto the church
This king Offa / as made is mention
And finally / by mine opinion
By these arms / again all that does them wrong
with help of Albon they shall be made strong.
The field of Asure betokens stedfastnes
The Sautree / like a cross of saint Andrue
The color heavenly shall give them perfitnes
By the holy cross / force in our lord Jesus
From day to day / to encreas all in virtue
The Prothomartir / their patron saint Albon
Shall them defend fro their mortal foon.
After these iustes and famous tournement
Fully accomplisshed / told here in sentence
Bassian / disposed in his intent
To awaite a time of intiere diligence
Of the Emperor to ask goodly license
with the Barons / being in Rome town
Home to return to Brutes Albiowne.
His request was granted anon
By Dioclecian / made non exception
Save only thus / he said that Albon
Shall not depart by no condition /
To him he had so great affection
For high noblesse and semelynes alone
He should abide / and awaite on his person.
To Albon / egall in fayrnes
with Dioclecian / non so great as he /
Of manly force and hardynes
Famous in knighthode / like Judas Machabe
As Scipion / of prudent advise was he
Of chere benign / discrete and virtuous
Gyuyng council right sad and compendious.
Mars in arms / with Mercury eloquent
Among Roman knights / rekened young and old
For which the Emperor by great aduisement
Of providence (toforne as I have told)
Before all other / Albon he has withholde
On him to awaite and abide day and night
Of his empire / as for most worthy knight.
when Bassian had his leave take
Of Dioclecian / with knights of Britain
The Emperor for Albons sake
At their departing list not for to feign
To make hem chere / and after in certain
For his pleasaunce / as says the croniclere
Fully complete / Albon abode seven year.
This mean while (mine author writes thus)
when this prince was come home in deed
Into his contree: A knight Carauseus
Greatly disposed to kill and blood to shede
Of the Romans gate license (as I read)
And of the Cenate by great auctorite
To be made keeper of the Brittisshe see
Bassianus by just succession
At his coming home to Britain / anon right
was crowned king of that region
His father deed / a full notable knight
Called Seuerus / which in the peoples sightes
Great favor had / but Bassian in that I Will
(The story says) reigned but a while.
By Carauseus (of whom I told beforne)
This Bassian was slain traitrously
Ceptre and crown this young prince has borne
Car^useus vsurpyng most falsely
To be crowned king of that party
Having no title to the regally
But a falls train of murder and tyranny
On Bassian thus when he was awroke
By intrusion the kingdom usurping
To the Romans had his oath broke
And in Britain took upon him to be king
The Roman tribute the which was hanging
To the emperor / he falsely can deny
Granted also within Albany.
To the pietes for to have a dwelling place
The which now is called Scotlonde
And from Rome they bode no longer space
A Cenatour came down with mighty hand
Called Allectus / the malice to withstand
Of Carauseus with Roman champions
Brought in nombre fully three legions
This Carauseus in story as I find
which traitrously had murdered Bassian
Slain by Allectus / his name put out of mind
Roman knights / with many a manly man
For to accomplisshe their purpose they began
Brought Britons through their renown
Almoost by force unto subjection.
To their socour / hoping it should avail
Against Romans to make resistance /
Asclepeodot / duke of Cornewaile
They chose of new / to stand at defense
which through his manly knightly excellence
Slew Allectus of very force and might
And put his fellow Galls to the flight.
The proud Romans he did so encombre
They might before him abide in no manner
He slew of them at London so great a nombre
Through his knighthode / beside a river /
After whose name / as says the Cronicler
Is called there as Romans did blede
Unto this day / walbroke as I read.
In memory of that discomfiture
The noble Britons / after that bataile
Of one assent / did their busy cure
The same day / armed in plate and maile
Proudly to chose the duke of Cornewaile
Asclepeodot / their purpose to attain
To crown him king / and lord of all Britain.
This mighty duke / knowing their intent
Agreed well unto their election /
To be crowned / that would he not assent
But authority from Rome were sent down
By the emperor to Brutes Albion /
For which / caused Dioclecian
To Britain to send Maximian.
The chief cause in sothe of his cu^mynge
(with other matters that were collateral)
Into that land / was for to crown him king
There for to reign in his estate royal
And Dioclecian in especial /
Has a conceit in the mean while
with him to send Albon into that I Will.
Both for trust / plainly to devise
And to govern notably that land
Parcel also to guerdon his seruise
For troth in knighthod in Albon that he fond
Ordained him / and made him suraunce in hand
Prince of knights / and steward sovereign
Under Romans / through all Britain.
He sent him thither also for that intent
For his wysdom and high discrecion
with Maximian for to be present
At this solemn coronacion
Of Asclepeodot / lord of that region
Albon as steward in that solempnitie
And prince of knights receive his dignity.
By the byddyng of Dioclecian
Like custom used of antiquity
Make his oath to Maximian
As prince and steward of most authority
To the emperor in his imperial see
As he was bound by statutes old and new
For life or death / ever to be true.
All things accomplished like as I have told
Maximian returned is again
with a tribute three thousand pound in gold
Beh^nde of old / denied of disdain
which was withdraw / the story says certain
To the Romans the time of Carauseus
A falls tiraunt / cruel and furious
Come into Rome when Maximian
Returned was with all his chiualry
That time the pope named Poncian
That busy was on that other party
In Cecile and in Lombardy
By devout teaching / as mine author says
To turn people unto christ's faith
In that time / made was non obstacle
That year in deed there was (as it was seen)
Through christ's law / turned by miracle
To the nombre of thousands fally sixtene
The church of christ / tender and very grene
when the emperor has the wonders same
was greatly meued of malice and disdain
To christ's faith had so great envy
when that he saw to his confusion
The number of christen encreace and multiply
Let call in haste by falls collusion
All the lords of that region
And all the Cenates before him to apere
At a certain day to treat of this matere.
Echone assemblyd in his high presence
Bid cast their wits together / and take heed
And faithfully do their diligence
In this matter their purpose for to speed
what was to done in so strait a need
For things that touches the welthe of the city
Must of wise council take first authority.
For this matter / touched one and all
A thing expedient for to be amended
which to amend / first they did call
The pope in have / that has their law offendyd
And to this point they be all condescended
To dampne him by hasty judgment
And all christens that were of his assent.
Banyssshe all christens out of Rome town
And punysshe them by mortal cruelty
Not only there / but in each region
with diverse tourmentes / serched every contree
This statute made in Rome the city
Through all the world a decree forth sent
They to be slain / and their bodies brent.
Spare no place / where men did them know
But them pursue upon each party
All their chirches cast down and overthrow
Plain with the ground / where men could them epsy
Thus stood our faith in mortal ieopardie
Of miscreauntes / foes to Christ's law
For dread of death that they have them withdraw.
Against them the painems were so strong
Drove them for fear each man fro his contree
And Amphiball that bare non arms of long
Save in knighthod of wilful poverty
Constrained was with other for to flee
Patiently / with travail and with pain
Passing the sea / came into Britain.
Conveyed he was by grace and virtue
In his repair homewarde (as I read)
His safeconduite strong in our lord Ihesu
who so trusts him / amys he may not speed
The holy ghost did his brydell led
To Verolamy / which of antiquity
was in Britain a great famous city.

OF this place here now I am aduerted
Of this matter for to stynte a while
And to proceed how Albon was converted
To christen faith the process to compyle
The holy martyr direct shall my style
To whose worship first I undertook
The translation of this little book
At the request and virtuous byddyng
Of my father thabbot of that place
A clerk noble perfyte of living
Having in custom every hour and space
To avoid sloth and virtue to purchase
Like any Ampte all seasons of the year
To gader grain and stuffen his garner
By whose notable compylations
Illumyned is not only his gaye library
By also full diligent occupations
Against ydlenes to all virtue contrary
Hat set in order in his famous grauery
A book compyled rycher than gold in coffers
Lives of poets and prudent philosophers
Of his name the Ethymologie
Is said of am Home or stead of whete
Of god provided does clearly signify
whete gleues of the mouth of tholde poet
Greyne / fruit / and flower with rhetoriques sweet
Of philosophers calling to memory
Of his labor the laureat reportory
And as I said by his commandment
I took upon me this translation
First to compyle it in all my best intent
His famous knyghthode and renown
And now to tell of his conversation
To Christis law I cast me for to write
Following the storye his passion to endite
To proceed like as I am bound
For to accomplysshe brefly in substance
This little book and call it the second
Of his martyrdom and meke suffraunce
And put aforne clearly in remembrance
How Amphiball as the cronycle says
Turned Albon unto Christis faith
Each of them (by record of writynge)
was plainly without others remembrance
For Albon had lost the knowlegynge
Of Amphabell / and all old acqueintaunce
But by the mean of gods ordinance
I will declare / as I am bound of det
In Verolamy / to tell how they met.
Plainly proceed / as I undertook
The residue to accomplysshe for his sake
Make here an end of the first book /
But now forsothe my pen I feel quake
Void of all color / save of letters blake
In this process my dullness to acquit
The martyrdom of Albon to endite.
Finis.
Here ends the first book / which treats of the life of Albon before he
was converted to the faith.
Here begins the prologue of the secunde book / treating of the conversion
of the blessed prothomaptyr of England called Saint Albon.
SO as Aurora parts the derke night
Toward the time of Phoebus vprisynge
And Lucifer with agreeable light
Brings kalendes of a glad morning:
So by ensample / the true living
Of old time in saint Albon used
Caused the lord which guerdoneth every thing
That the merits of him were not refused.
Every thing draws to his nature
Like as kind gives heavenly influence
For to disposen every creature
Some to profit / some to do offense
Some to encreace by perfect providence
where virtue has the dominacion
Of god ordained by intere diligence
That sensuality be bridled with reason.
Among painems / Iues have be saine
That virtue has many of them governed
Taught by nature / wrought nothing in vain
But as kind / and reason has us learned
Good grain from chaf was discerned
Thus has he proved in many a sundry place
Good from yuell / by them truly conserned
Record upon Cornelly and on saint Eustace
who taught Troyan whylom to done right
when the wydowe complained her greuaunce
To her grefe the emperor cast his sight
Reason taught him for all his great puissaunce
To her request to hold the balaunce
Of ryghtwysenes to se though he were strong
In her pouerte to persuade her perturbance
By egall dome he to redress her wrong
The storye of old it put in memory
For ryghtwysenes in especial
How that Troyan by prayers of Gregorye
was preserved from the pains eternal
From dampnation and cloister infernal
To exemplify how god takes head
Of his greattest power most imperial
Of right and mercy acquiteth each good deed
And to the purpose of my mattiere
During his life of great power and might
This blessed Albon who so list to here
Though like a prince his power yafe great light
Fostred truth / did wrong to no wight
For which the lord his hand has not wtdrawe
To call and clepe him his own chosen knight
To be converted and turned to his law
His truth / his virtue / his native gentylnes
Of custom stable grounded in many wise
Caused god of his merciful goodness
To the this prince into his service
All falls y dols manly to despise
This choson chapyon borne of the breton tyne
This new Tytan / whose beams did auise
Out of orient to lord to enlemyne
Now hensforth shall be my process
with gods help my pen to apply
How in his time he keped ryghtwysenes
And like a prince / how he did him gye
To set his city upon each party
In governance from right they not twynne
Under the reigns of prudent polycye
which to rehearse / thus I will begin
Here ends the prologe of the second book.
Here begins the second book of the glorious Prothomartyr saint Albon how
he was made governor of the city of Verolamye.
Under the Romans chief and principal
with great auise it lyked them to ordain
By commyssyon and titell imperial
Prince and steward thorughout all Bretayne
To chief Albon / which did first his pain
Like a prince not slow nor recheles
To avoid all trouble / and rule the people in peace
By polecy he has so provided
Set statutes so mighty and so strong
And his laws so virtuously divided
For common profit to endure long
That no man should do other wrong
And where he saw innocents oppressed
Set a pain inhaste to be redressed
The rich he made live to their estate
without extorcion do to the portayle
Repressed riot suffered no debate
Idell people constrained to travail
Aforne provided for plente of vitayle
Like his office with virtuous diligence
By suffisaunce there were none indigence
Beloved and drad with high and low degree
For friend nor so declyued not fro troth
The good him loved for his benignite
The rich drad him / on the pore he had reuth
wrongs to redress there was in him no sloth
In his domes steadfast as a wall
Not singular found nor yet parciall
Nature taught him all vices for to flee
Like the laws / to which he was bound
A chastiser of all dishoneste
Gafe never dome till truth were out found
Another to heavy / another to iocounde
But as time and matter gave him occasyon
So was demened his disposition
He had also of his acqueyntance
Four virtues called Cardynall
The reine of his brydell led temperance
Ryghtwysenes with mercy ruled all
Truth to defend / and manhod marcyall
By force also through high prowes
Spared not to chastise all falsenes
He could appese folk that list debate
Refourme all rancour where he could it espy
Like a prince knyghtly he did hate
Such as could falsely forge and lie
Stopped his ears from all flaterye
To foren quarelles list give no credence
Till the party come unto audience
Envious sclaunder be punyswed rygorously
Compassed of malice hatred and di^^ame
To double tongues ever he was enmye
which to say yuell of custom have no shame
And backbyters that have their lyppes lame
To say well / this prince young and old
Voyded all such out of his householde
By discreeion he could punysshe and spare
His heart ay void of all duplicite
Large of custom / to naked folk and bare
His gate ay open for hospitalite
That if his virtues should rekened be
Here in this book told from young age
I have thereto no connyng nor langage
Oot withstandyng as I have behyght
I will proceed and not excuse me
To declare how god saw to his knight
The time rehearsed / the date also parde
when Amphibalus entered the city
Of Verolamy told eke the occasion
How he and Albon met in the town
Amphibalus entered the city
Of adventure to seek herburgage
By the streets up and down went he
Like a pilgrim of chere and visage
Till it fell so he met in passage
The noble prince plainly to conclude
Blessed Albon with a great multitude
This mighty prince by great fortune
After custom used that time of old
Amyd the city walked in his estate
In a garment frenged all with gold
Amphibalus virtuously made bold
with humble chere and meke visage
Besought him lowly to grant him herbergage
For when that he on Albon cast his look
And him beheld with every circumstance
By long auyse of him good head he took
It fell anon into his remembrance
Full yore agone of his acqueyntance
How they in one of fortune did assent
Out of Brytayn / and unto Rome went
For gods sake this Amphibalus
Of herborgage can lowly him require
To be received and take in to his house
Albon anon as the story does us lere
was in such case strange in no manner
Having a custom to hye and low degree
Freely to grant hospitalite
In to his house him goodly has received
This simple clerk list no longer tarry
His port his there benyngly received
Mynystred to him all that was necessary
From Christis law though Albon did vary
Like a prince benyng and virtuous
Received him full goodly into his house
Not after long only by gods grace
Of knyghtly favor sought oportunyte
To get a time / a leysour / and a space
To avoid from him his people and his main
with this pilgrim alone for to be
And secretly when they were met in fere
To him he said anon as ye shall here
By many signs and tokens that I can
Diverse dangers strange to recure
In soth that ye be a christen man
And of hardynes durst your self assure
To put your body and life in adventure
Among paynyms your person to ieoparte
without death how might ye depart
Quod Amphibalus Christ Jesus of his grace
Of his mercy / be it that I have deserved
From all danger and every peryllous place
Christ gods son my body has preserved
Ben my gyde / and my life conserved
To this city brought me safe to preach
His glorious law and his faith to teach
Quod Albon than / how may this true
what that he is I would feign lere
The son of god / a strange thing and a new
Had god a son declare this mattiere
Quod Amphiball / so ye list to here
Patiently / for nothing will I spare
Curiously the truth to declare
Amphibalus is entreated by reason
On the gospel to ground his process
And to confirm his disputation
Of holy writ he took justly witness
How our believe records in sothnesse
Of god the father and god the son also
This is our belefe take good head thereto
The son most perfyte and most good
For man's health and salvation
was incarnate and took flesh and blood
And semblably for short conclusyon
Of his most benign consolation
Right so as he first made man in deed
So come he down to take our manhede
And as him list of grace and of mercy
By his power / which that is divine
Ordained maidens to live here parfytly
So he again ward plainly to determyne
Took flesh and blood of a pure virgin
The time come there was none obstacle
But that he wroughte his maruaylous miracle
The time approached of grace and gladness
Toward summer when the lustye queen
Called Flora with motleis of swetenes
Clothed the soil all in new grene
And amerous Veer / again the son shine
By the cherysshynge of Apryll with his shores
Brings kalendes of May and of his flowers
So in the season heavenly and divine
Of winter storms was passed all outrage
And in the rain Phoebus began to shine
The same time to our great advantage
Down from heaven was sent a message
which concluded for our felicite
A branch should spring out of iesse
This new tydynge to Nasereth was sent
And Gabrell come on his message
The trynyte hole being in one assent
For to accomplysshe this gracious viage
The holy ghost holding his passage
Down descendyng right as any line
In to the breast of a pure virgyne
Like as Luke in his gospel says
As is remembered in the same place
when Gabryell lowly began abrayde
Mekely said: Hayle Mary full of grace
Thou chosen of god every hour and space
The tabernable of the trinyte
Among all women blessed mote thou be
when she had herd the angel thus express
Troubled in his words of femynyte
Thought in her self of very chaste clennesse
This chosen myrrour of humylyte
This salutation / what it might be
The angel saying her aferde of womanhede
Said: O Mary have hereof no dread
Before god thou have founden grace
Thou shall conceive a child in all clennesse
Of whose birth Bedleme shall be the place
As the gospelll can bear hereof witness
And his name plainly to express
Thou shall him name of most virtue
when he is borne and call him Jesus
How may this be said this glorious maid
That know no man in will deed nor thought
Thangell than unto Mary said
As I toforne have the tidings brought
By the holy ghost this miracle shall be wrought
The virtue also of him that sit highest
Shall ouershadowe and light into thy breast
For that lord that shall of the be borne
As thing most holy men shall him call
The son of god / as prophets wrote beforne
Such heavenly grace is upon the fall
By a prerogatyue above women all
with light surmountyng above the sterres seven
This message I have brought the from heaven
Quod Mary fulfilled be the will
After the word / which thou have brought unto me
Behold this handmayde / and this humble ancille
This was her answer with all humylyte
Thoo god was pleased with her virginite
yet was that lord / doctors bear witness
Pleased more with her devout mekenes
Thus has a maid through her perfytnes
To bear her lord graciously deserved
A chosen daughter by her pure clennes
To bear her father / her chastity concerued
By her merytes that were to her reserved
As I said erst by a prerogatyue
She among women was maiden mother and wife
To god a maid to fulfill his will
And to the lord a servant by mekenes
Daughter and mother / and eke faithful ancyll
which to remember has brought gostly gladness
Of all welfare / our dangers to repress
Aforne by record of prophets in substance
Us to defend again all mortal greuaunce
For which dear host since it may avail
To my doctrine yeueth heartily credence
God has me sent to teach you and counsel
So that ye lust with humble diligence
Become his knight and do him reverence
Obey his law and his precepts all
Takes good head to you what shall befall
His faith to you shall give so great virtue
That blind folk ye shall make for to see
By invocation only of Christ Jesus
Deliver the people from all aduersite
Leprous folk / and tho that lame be
To be made clean / and make them go vpryght
And every sykenes recover through his might
ye shall escape by his prouydence
All myscheues to you that been contrary
Live long time / go free from pestilence
From Christis faith if that ye will not vary
To grant your asking the lord shall not tarry
But at last or ye hens wend
By martyrdom ye shall make an end
By martyrdom ye shall end your life
And blessedly from this world shall pass
Out of all trouble and transitory strife
which day by day / does you here manasse
Through Christis might and influence of grace
ye shall to god / to your great auantage
By meke suffraunce make your passage
This was chief cause and ground of my coming
Sent by Jesus unto this town
As a bedyll to bring you tydyng
How by his mighty visitation
ye shall endure pain and passion
For Christis faith in his most pacient wise
As knight and martyr chosen to his service
That is his will ye shall find in deed
To recompense the great humanyte
which ye have used of fredome and manhede
To indigent folk and people in pouerte
And specially for hospitalite
with other deeds in nombre called seven
Deeds of mercy registered now in heaven
To feed the pore / which had no vitayle
And to viset folks in prison
Receive them that herburgh did fail
Bedred folks that lay in myschiefe down
Comfort the syke mynystre them foysowne
Part with them of that they had need
And vury them that lay in myschiefe deed
To his servants / and all that ye have mynystred
Cronycled ben in the heavenly consistory
In his book perpetually registered
Each good deed the lord has in memory
It to guerdon with a palm of victory
Perpetually with him to reign in joy
Greatter conquest than was the sege of Troy
Since ye your hands have not withdraw
From hospitalite pore folks for to feed
while ye have lived in this paynym law
Causes of the poor to promote and to speed
God forgets not to quite your mede
If this be done after ye be baptized
A double palm for you shall be devised
Like a prince in most knyghty wise
Albon obeyed with entiere diligence
All these words began wisely advertise
Answering these words in sentence
what manner worship / what manner reverence
Shall I do than when I am withdraw
From ydolatry / and turned to Christis law
Amphibalus yafe answer to Albon
ye must believe and in no doubt be
There is no god in this world but one
The father / the son / the holy ghost these three
Joined in one by perfyte unite
The foundation as I can well preue
First article and ground of our believe
This faith in soth shall clearly you direct
If that you list give thereto credence
All old errors to avoid and correct
If ye so done with humble reverence
I dare affirm and conclude in sentence
That your beginning to god is acceptable
And to your soul treasure most profitable
Of the father the power eternal
Of the son souerain sapience
Of the holy ghost in especial
Grace does proceed by virtuous providence
And to descryue the magnificence
Of all the three / called three and one
Undivided / they never asonder gone
And if ye list unto this law turn
Of his most digne^ imperial majesty
He shall you make with him to soiourne
This blessed lord / this blessed trinite
where joy is ever and all felicite
Tofore whose face eternally lasting
Three Ierarchies one Osanna sing
Of this matiere be nothing in doubt
Set aside all ambiguyte
Forsake your mawmettes / and all that false route
For they be made of metal / stone / and tree
which may not help nor forther in no degree
Saturn / Iubiter / Mars / and Appollo
with the false goddessis Dyana and June
Though they have ears / in troth they may not here
with eien great / of lokyng they do fail
They be forged in gold and stones clear
who calls to them they may nothing avail
Now dear host forsake all this rascayle
As I have said / and do in Christ delight
And he by grace shall make you perfyte
A large space Albon kept him close
Feigned in manner as he had disdain
From his place in great have arose
yet or he went he began to said
ye be not wise your doctrine is in vain
If it were wist ye were in this city
ye should endure full great adversity
For your sake there should be practysed
Diverse tourmentes for your destruction
For your blasphemye cruelly chastised
without favor or remyssyon
At the last for short conclusyon
your heed smyten of / without grace
If ye were known or founden in this place
In this matter I can none other feel
For your person somewhat I stand in doubt
you ben here / yet I shall counsel
And you preserve that no man shall take heed
Of your consayte / nor what ye mean in deed
And with that word / out of the place he goth
Shows a chere like as he had been wroth
By grace of god and favor of fortune
All that he said was done with reverence
Of gentylnes he was not importune
Suffered all thing with humble patience
Albeit so he gafe no full credence
To his doctrine of things which he told
Stood in doubt / what party he should hold
Albon in have thought for the best
when Lucyna shone full shene and bright
with sleep oppressed for to take his rest
Amphibalus satte all that long night
Upon his knees as gods own knight
For love of Albon with great devotion
Making full mekely his orison
To whose prayer of grace god took keep
And list to consydre his affection
And in this while as Albon lay and sleep
The same night he had a vision
Strange and diverse by manyfolde reason
And wonder fer from his intelligence
what it meant or what was the sentence
Toward morrow when Albon did abrayde
Out of his sleep / and Phoebus shone full shene
Began to maruayle / and no word he said
Touching his dream / new fresshe and grene
Understood not what it should mean
Rose up in haste / and to the pilgrim went
Besechyng him to declare what it meant
My friend quod he / if all thing be true
which ye have preached of Christ and of his law
Diverse maruayles unknown strange and new
Showed to me this night or it can dawe
I you beseech your wit ye not withdraw
For to declare the exposition
when I have told you mine auision
The which truly as I reherce can
Lokyng up to the heavenly mansion
Me thought sothly that I saw a man
From that place to this world come down
Of whose beauty was no comparysown
Eke me thought of boystous folk and rude
He was beset with a great multitude
This people envious and froward of intent
As it seemed of malice and hatered
with many a sundry fell turment
with sharp scourges made his sides blede
Bound his hands / I took thereof good head
And on a cross they hynge him up full blyue
with spear and nails they yafe him wounds five
Naked he was / body / foot / and hondes
On length and bread drawn with great pain
By the constreynt of mighty strong bonds
Drawn a sonder was every narfe and vein
with a sharp spear his heart cloven in twene
Persed he was so deep and profounde
That blood and water ran out of that wound
with a reed spear they raught I took head
To give him drink / eysell mengled with gall
A crown of thorn set upon his heed
And among his cruel pains all
King of jews in scorn they him call
And in despite malycyously cryenge
Of Iewery saluted him as king
As me thought they greatly did offend
To make all his body so for to blede
And from the cross down bad him discende
If that he were gods son in deed
His skin to rent / all blody was his wede
Like a meke lamb / mine heart did agryse
To se him turment in so cruel wise
After these pains grievous and intolerable
And all his hydous mortal tourmentry
with a great voice pitous and lamentable
Upon the point / when he should die
To his father thus he began to cry
In to thine hands father I commend
My ghost / my spirit / and thus he made an end
And with that cry as he yafe up the go^
From the cross his body they took down
Like well stremes upon every coost
His grene wounds shed out great ^oyson
Of blody drops / and for a conclusyon
Of all his pains / his body was anon
Closed and ensealed under a great stone
And while that he with strong hand was kept close
Maruayle of maruayles most I can maruayle
The deed body / to life again rose
Maugre the knights with all plate and mayle
A soden slombre their hedes did assail
An angel most sovereign of delight
I saw appear / and he was clothed in white
Among other maruayles there was one
which I beheld in mine auision
Out of his grave closed with a stone
He rose up like a strong champyon
with open eien I had aspection
Of all this thing no part left behind
From point to point all marked in my mind
Rad nor songen among the Brytons lays
was never herd so soote an heavenly sown
After the nombre full of forty days
Followed after the resurrection
To the time of his assention
what multitude of angels all in fere
Conueyde him above the sterres clear
I saw this thing and knew it well ynowe
By a manner uncouth appearance
The garments whytter than milk or snow
Of all thangels that did him reverence
This was their song and refret in sentence
Blessed be the father / blessed mote he be
The son eke blessed in his humanyte
These uncouth tidings I saw them in my sleep
And many other things mo withal
Secret things I took of them good keep
Not to be showed to no man mortal
And he told unto Amphibell all
when he a woke in full humble intent
Besechyng him to declare what it meant
which things to here greatly was delyted
within him self of spiritual gladness
Saw that his heart was of god visited
And full devoutly a cross he began forth dress
Lo here quod he / this token bears witness
Of all the signs clear as the son beam
That were unto you showed in your dream
The man which to you did appear
Sent from heaven so fair and glorious
He was the same as I shall you lere
My blessed lord / mine own lord Christ Jesus
Most benyng / most meke / and most virtuous
which on a cross suffered passion
As ye saw clearly in your auision
Only by mercy by his gracious advise
Of the trespass to make redemption
Touching the aple / which in paradise
Adam ate of by false suggestion
Of a serpent to great confusion
First of him self / next of all his line
Till Christis passion / that was our medycyne
Again Adam the serpent was so wode
To staunche his venym was found none obstacle
Till on the cross Christ Jesus spend his blood
A medycyne bawme and chyefe triacle
Lycour of lycours / dystyllyng by miracle
From the cundytes of Christis wounds fine
Man to restore again from death to live
whose blessed passion is our restauratyfe
Health and diffence of most excellence
To assuage the bolynge of our mortal strife
Bawme imperyall against fendes violence
The phylosophre celestial queynt essence
To all welfare mankind to restore
Helps all sykenesses / when leches can no more
Our leche / our ypocras / our gostely galyent
Our samson called that venquisshed the lion
Our mighty cha^pyon the famous strong Achilles
That bare up heaven for our salvation
Hye on the cross making our raunson
He that ye saw was the same man
In your auision that overcame Satan
The multitude that above him stood
were false jews / his death immagynyng
Of cursed malice / nailed him to the rod
List not receive his gracious coming
Of their prophets refused the writing
Knew not their lord / but as folk adversary
For his goodness / were to him contrary
Merciful Jesus gayn death to stynte our strife
List suffer death / from death to make us free
Venquisshed death / with death to bring in life
when life was slain an high upon a tree
Forbode fruit / brought immortalyte
By a round aple was caused all this loss
By fruit reformed / that henge upon the cross
Let me I pray you have very knowlegyng
By your discrete faithful diligence
As ye that been expert in many a thing
what obseruaunce / what due reverence
Unto the father and his magnificence
To the holy ghost / tell on first of those two
And to the son / what service shall I do
when Amphabell began plainly to advertise
His faithful askyng with all humylyte
Began rejoice in many sundry wise
This Albon where as he stood free
was godly moved to ask of these three
By god enspired conceived of reason
Only of grace came this question
Thanked god / and goodly began him dress
To comfort the true affection
Of blessed Albon / and truly to express
Him to quite for short conclusyon
Of his demand made a solution
His conceytes discretely to appese
Thus he said to set his heart in ease
These three persons / which ye have named here
The father the son the holy ghost these three
Ben sothfastly like as ye shall here
Trust me right well on god in trinite
Joined in one by perfyte unite
Believe this justly / and your wits dress
For life or death / this article to confess
This is my faith / and I believe thus
Quod blessed Albon with all humylyte
There is no god but my lord Jesus
which that come down from his fathers see
Mekely to take our humanyte
For our health and our salvation
List of his mercy to suffer passion
He with the father the holy ghost these three
Amphibalus rehersyng unto Albon
They be all one god by perfyte unite
And other god in all the world is none
And this belefe look ye not forgone
This word often rehearsed in sentence
Albon fell down with devout reverence
Toforne the cross / and with great repentance
And said: O lord Jesus on my mysdede
O Jesus mercy / receive my penance
which on the cross list for my sake to blede
And on his knees fast he began him speed
with contryte heart / great to god a lofte
with weeping tears the cross he kyssed often
with all his members has him applied
As on the cross Christ had be present
And he with him when he was crucyfyed
So of hole heart Albon was dilygent
His face his eien with tears all be sprent
This penitent his langour for to lysse
was ever busye Christis foot to kiss
His bitter tears from his eyes tweyne
Like a crystal well encreasyng at a floode
Albon ay busy to make the water reyne
To myngle his weeping with Christis own blood
I mean the wound graven in the roode
Upon the cross that was to him showed
Of drery sobbyng the carectes all be dewed
By grace enspired this Albon began him draw
To take the order of religion
Of Christis faith and bind him to that law
with will and heart and hole affection
And secretly made his professyon
To Christ Jesus time and hour devised
By Amphibalus when he was baptized
with humble heart this was the langage
Of holy Albon quod he I here forsake
The pomp of Satan / and all his baronage
And all the power of the vggely fendes blake
My soul and body to Jesus I betake
which for mankind dyed it is no nay
Thus I believe / and rose the third day
Quod Amphibalus with a glad visage
Be strong of faith our lord is hold with the
He will not fail to confyrme your courage
By tokens showed of his beningnyte
In especial reports this of me
To other aforne you as I rehearse can
That they were taught / they learned it of man
But your langage excellyng in virtue
Experience has give you knowlegyng
By revelation of our lord Jesus
which to you has declared every thing
His birth / his passion / his vprysyng
Of all this thing like as ye had in sight
To call you to him to be his chosen knight
which me seems ought enough suffice
with the surplus of your auision
To you expouned the manner and the gyse
Of Christis faith with full instruction
Mekely of heart with supportation
At my request your highness not ye grieve
For to depart goodly to give me leave
I am meued of very conscience
Other contrees to preach Christis law
I hope to you it shall do none offense
For a season though I me withdraw
It is a by word / and a full old saw
which has be said / fyth gone many a year
Friends always / may not ben in fere
Friends quod Albon never depart asonder
Joined in virtue and knyt by grace
Though one be here and a another yonder
Their hertes ben one every hour and space
In god combined / there parts them no place
Of one wyllaye in that they have to done
Of which I pray / departs not so sone
To abide a weke ye may do me great ease
By your doctrine to have instruction
My lord Jesus how shall I him please
with right hole heart and true affection
To serve him duly like my profession
And in his faith wherein I most delight
with your teaching that I may be perfyte
Amphibalus knowing his intent
List in no wise deny his askyng
The long night they to gether spent
Only in prayer and devout praysyng
For out of sight they chose their abydyng
From noise of folk they began them self withdraw
And all that while they spoke of Christis law
Of Christis faith and of his religion
was their faith and their dalyance
Among to god they maid their orison
Them to detende from fendes accombrance
In this while god yafe them sorry chance
A cursed paynym of malice and envy
where they met the place he did epsy
To avoid them of comfort and refuge
This paynym aforsayd of malice list not spate
For to accuse them both unto the judge
Of their metyng the manner to declare
And moreover yuell mote he fare
Of malycyous froward cursednes
The judge he set a fire with wodenes
with envious sturdy violence
Through the city they serched were and sought
And commanded to appear in the presence
Toforne the judge both two to be brought
The town serched / but they found them naught
Blessed Albon meued of courage
To keep his master and save him from damage
Upon a night before the dawnyng
This blessed Albon his master began conueye
with heavy chere most pituously weeping
Out of the city brought him on the way
At the departing fared as they would dye
So were their hertes joined in one cheyne
Not like to twynne / till death deperte them in twain
O faithful love standing in such a state
By resemblaunce in comparyson
As whylome did Dauyd and Ionathas
Maugre king Saules persecution
Faynyng was none nor dissimulation
Like to endure plainly to termyne
Till Antropos their lives tried atwyne
Their love more sad stable and vertous
In comparyson than the poets made
Of Pyrothe or of Thedeus
Of Norestes / outher of Pylade
Fresshe for a season / that would sone fade
As whylome did the love of Achylles
And Patroclus slain amyd the prees
when that Ector the Troyan champyon
Slow Patroclus for his frowardnes
Maugre Achylles for all his high renown
To exemplify there is no stablenes
In worldly love / but change and doublenes
Be it of blood kynne or alye
without virtue all stands in ieoperdye
Of these tweyne the love was a another
By enterchaungyng / between them set a law
Albon to abide and to dye for his brother
Amphibalus his presens to withdraw
In their hertes the feruence did adawe
Of perfyte love to endure long
As Salamon writes / that love as death is strong
In all such case the love makes hertes bold
And by ensample that love auoydeth dread
Albon for love took his cloth of gold
And like a prince list to change his wede
Of entier heart he began it for to sprede
Over the shulders of Amphibali anon
The hour when they atwynne should gone
From all his fone he justly was assured
who that ever had on this clothe of gold
Till he the place fully have recured
To stand atlarge aforne as I have told
Thus with sobbyng and weeping manyfolde
God suffered them a sundry to deuyde
Forsook them not but was their bothes gyde
A simple sclauenne fortorne and threde bare
Of Amphabals a full old garment
This noble prince Albon list not spare
To cast upon him though it were all to rent
So hole to Christ was set all his intent
And in his pouert to show that he was plain
To his Tygurry returned home again
Amphibalus northwarde to his passage
There of heart / god to be his gyde
For a time to eschew the cruel rage
Of paynyms as fortune list provide
But holy Albon did the bront abide
To live and dye as goddis champyon
Christ bare his standerd / the cross was his penon
His sodayn chance he held it was no loss
Forsook riches took him to pouerte
His treasure was to knele aforne the cross
His hertie joy and his felicite
And for a while thus I let him be
In his prayers / and tell I will in deed
How his enemies against him proceed
There was a statute proclaimed in the town
who that would not do no reverence
Unto their gods / nor mekely knele down
In to their fire for to cast ensence
He should anon by cruel violence
Be take and laid upon an altar bound
Toforne their gods and slain with many a wound
Of his body to make sacrifice
Superstitious was this oblation
which of new paynyms began practice
Again the doctrine and predication
By Amphybalus brought into the town
By the judge set in ordinance
On him and Albon first to do vengeance
So to punysshe one and one by row
without mercy or long auisement
To blessed Albon this statute was well know
Both of their dome and cruel judgment
And ay this prince / stable in his intent
Made strong in god / for life or death tendure
The lords hand / and his adventure
when somer flowers blowed white and read
And were in their highest lusty fresshe season
And fyry Phoebus / from the crabbes hedde
Took his passage toward the lion
At Verolamy / in that royal town
The same time paynyms have auerted
To Christis faith / how Albon was converted
For which against him so obstynate they stood
Like wild boores or tygyrs in their rage
Vengeable of heart furyous and wode
Malancoly and pale of their visage
And all the night with cursed fell langage
Began to manace like wolfes ravenous
This blessed Albon and Amphibalus
The dark tides of the cloudy night
withdrough their shadows and their skies blake
And Lucyfer began show his beams bright
And Aurora has the bed forsake
Of fyry Titan and her leave take
And Phoebus Chariot draws up with flegoute
And began illumyne all the Orisoute
The wholesome bawme began in meddowes flete
Among the flowers and wholesome leaves grene
The silver dew began the soil to wete
Like perles round as any crystal shene
when nature of worldly things the queen
Ordained a day of fresshenes plentous
when Albon was beseged in his house
The paynyms began make their self strong
This noble prince Albon to pursewe
Upon that hour when the larkes song
In their leden and began the day salewe
Their purpose was specially to sewe
Amphibalus but that he was gone
Instead of him they fill upon Albon
Aforne the cross they found him knelyng
In his prayer and they upon him went
He rose up and made no taryeng
And the great multitude that the judge sent
Fell upon him and like wolfes him rent
In their furyous mortal fell deluge
They him present anon before the judge
Meke as a lamb of port and chere benynge
To done his battle / like Christis own knight
His banner was his standerde and his sign
The cross of Jesus / which he bare vpryght
Magre paynyms in their alder sight
Like a champyon again them to warrye
Under that penon cast him to live and dye
God was with him to susteyn his party
Steadfast of heart / hardy as a lion
Put his life for Christ in ieopertye
Of body naked / truth was his habergon
His shield was faith / his sword and his burdon
His spear his pollax / surer than stele to endure
was only hope / the victory to recure
His sabbatons set on ground of truth
And his greues forged with stabilnes
And his polayns plyant without flouthe
And his quisshews borne up with high prowess
A pair of curesse / closed with ryghtwysenesse
And his vauntbrace was trust that went beforne
Rerebrace of charity / which might not be forlorn
Gloves of plate to bear of and defend
was true affection meddled with the deed
A large pauice greatly to commend
Of true meaning to avoid away all dread
And thus in truth who so list take heed
All in virtues enarmed for defense
with a cote armor above of patience
Charity was chief of his counsel
Taught him the manner / again his cruel sone
How that he should do to his great avail
Enter in to the field / and knyghly to gone
All that it so were / that he was but alone
His banner splayed / full erly on the morrow
Grace was his guide with saint John^ to borowe
First he was led by mortal violence
Draw and torn in most cruel wise
The holy cross up borne for his defense
And brought he was to do sacrifice
Unto their ydols / but he them did despise
Asclypiodot the judge there present
And all the city gathered of intent
This gods knight holdyng the cross in hand
Invisible by virtue of that sign
And paynyms that about him stand
Cruel and cursed again him began malygne
Though they were there borne of one line
The judge troubled when that he took head
Of Christis cross / and had in manner dread
Albon always this prince full notable
Stood ay vpryght with look most coragious
Ever of one heart / as any center stable
The cross afforne banner most glorious
Most agreeable and most victorious
And first of all the story does us lere
Of his master / the judge of him did enquere
And asked of him to what party he was gone
By his sleyght and his uncouth wyle
which dispysed their gods every chone
Come of now their city to begyle
At whose words Albon stynt a while
And said at last with sobre countenance
He was departed by gods ordinance
Quod the judge where ever that he be
Either embesyled orels set a side
Touching the faith that he has taught to the
And therein ben thy master and thy guide
And is now fled / and durst not abide
By his doctrine a reason full notable
His preaching is naught or he is not stable
I trow he would have come to presence
If in his faith had be no varyance
Other some remors of his conscience
Has cast his heart in new repentance
If he had had in his faith constance
Like a master he should not have gone
And his disciple in myschefe leave alone
In this doctrine as to mine intent
There is disceyte under some falsenes
Or in his teaching he is fraudolent
which the brought in so great wodenes
To forsake thy treasure and riches
Of all our gods in so froward wise
Of wylfulnes / and malice them to despise
Thou standist now in a full perlous point
The clerk has brought the in so great a snare
And set thy reason so far out of joint
And made thy wit so naked and so bare
That thou art pleynly to declare
In Christis cause / and so from our faith to err
Again all our gods to begin mortal war
which thing considered / as it is skylle and right
And egally paysed in balaunce
wrong to do them by any manner wight
Another by favor / frendshyp / nor suffraunce
May not pass without great vengeance
Upon blasphemy the law does ordeyne
Again the gods / death to be their pain
Unto a fool thou gafe hasty credence
And by his folly he has the begyled
First to the gods / thou do no reverence
Of despite will not be reconsyled
Thou farest as a man which is vnabyled
Stondyng as now from grace desolate
Vile and abiecte out of thine old estate
In such case each man may be disceyued
By such false foren information
But now thine error is clery apperceyued
So by counsel / for thy salvation
Or thou incur the indignation
And or judgment by rygour the manare
Forsake that seete / fall down and axe grace
To thine estate thou may thus be restored
with humble heart / do them sacrifyce
And thy treasure and thy riches shall be mored
And increased in many a sundry wise
To great worship / and suddenly arise
Of towns / castles / lord we shall the make
So thou will the faith of Christ forsake
Of heart and thought very indiuisybel
Albone stood hole and kept his ground and place
The iuges promysse flateryng and fallybel
Boystous threatenings / with which he began manace
Void of dread / of one chere / and one face
This manly prince / this hardy knight Albon
Stood between both / stable as any stone
To the judge said as ye shall here
Thy manaces nor promys of pleasance
In froward speech / nor thy frownyng chere
Shall me not meue on point from my constaunce
In Christ Jesus / is hole my suffisance
For me list not here long process to devise
Thy gold thy treasure thy gods I despise
And where thou have my master eke accused
Of inconstance / and duplicite
Be right well sure god has him excused
That he did / the counsel come of me
He fled not god wot for fear of the
I was assented to keep him absence
And else he had come to audience
From the truth me list not to declyne
All thy words be said but in vain
Of my master / I confess the doctrine
For life nor death / never to turn again
From Christis faith / which stands in certain
For it causes folks lame to go vpryght
And folks blind to recure their sight
This faith so hole infyxed is in my mind
Unto me more precious and more dear
Than all the stones / that comen out of Inde
Or all the riches that thou rehersyst here
Gold or treasure / rekened all in fear
worldly worshyps / pomp or veynglorye
To faith compared be things transytorye.
This faith in god makes me so rich and strong
All worldely good for it I do despise
what should longer draw the alonge
To false gods in no manner of wise
I will not do worship nor sacrifise
Echon ben false and have another wit nor wind
ye that serve them be very mad or blind
Most deceyuable when a man has need
Ben your gods with all your mawmetrye
It has been proved aforne in my kynred
And many other borne of mine allye
All such rascayle of purpose I defye
False and faylyng of old time and new
To all their servants of custom most untrue
I cast never with them to have a do
Nor make fire upon their aulteris
This is mine answer take good head thereto
Nor none ensence cast in their senseres
Nor knele aforne them this.C.M. years
This is in sum for one word and all
My last will and answer fynall.
with this answer there rose up a sodeyn cry
Noise of the people clamor and weeping
About the martyr they went busylye
Like wodemen upon him gauryng
He herd all their speech / spoke again nothing
The iuges manace / the peoples violence
He suffered all / and kept his patience
The people again him vengeable and cruel
Unto their temples brought him anon right
By violence they began him to compel
To their gods to offer and to set up light
Blessed Albon as gods own knight
Stable of heart / and hole in his intent
To sacrifice would never assent
The people then in their furyous hete
By the jews cruel commandment
They strypte him first / and with scourges beat
Till his body and skin was all to rent
But he with glad chere sufferde his torment
His eien vplyfte / to god began abrayde
And to the lord devoutly thus he said
Lord god quod he keep mine inward thought
Grant of thy grace in my grievous pain
Patience / that I ne grudge naught
Of thy mercy O Jesus not disdeyne
My freyle flesh / from murmour to restreyne
Sith that my will stant hole without strife
To the to offer my soul and eke my life
Remember the lord on thy servant Albone
For another flody storms / wind / nor reyne
May hurt that house bylte on stable stone
And semblably it is full selde seyne
who byldeth in Christ / byldeth not in vein
Sith my byldyng stant holy in thy grace
Suffer not my will remeue from this place
My voice / my tongue / my will fully record
All of assent without excepcion
For life for death they never shall discord
But thou Jesus made our redemption
Now by the virtue of thy passion
O blessed lord grant me constance
Among the pains hole will and meke suffrance
whiles the martyr was scourged and beat
This was his voice / on Christ Jesus to cry
To call his help would never let
Another for smerte / nor paynfull tormentrye
Unto paynyms law / he would never apply
Another for manace rebuke nor rygour
For fair speech / for promysse nor favor
Like a dyamande he would not be broke
Nor restreyned from his old constance
From Christis faith they might not revoke
with all their feigned words of pleasance
Than was he put under governance
Of the judge / as a lamb among hounds
Full six wekes not to pass his bounds
During this time the book makes mention
He streytly kept of moo than one or twain
Like a martyr hold in streyte prison
Might not reche further than his cheyne
The elements his wrongs began to complain
In their manner against natures law
Their benefytes of kind to withdraw
Upon the earth / on herb / grass / nor flower
On all these three was no dew seen
The ground to cherysshe come another rain nor shoure
For no moisture fell upon the grene
Flora slepte / that is the flowers queen
Eolus the smothe wyndes soft
All this while enspired not alofte
The earth scaldeth with the feruence of the son
Hete on nyghtes was intolerable
There grew no fruit / the skies were so done
Greynes come none / vplande was not erable
Thus by a manner complaynt lamentable
Heaven and earth complained them of right
The injury done unto gods knight
The people playned for lackyng of vitayle
Demed it cause of some sorsery
That Thelementis list to hold a battle
For Christis knight to hold up his party
Again myscreantes with their tormentrye
Magre their malice to make the martyr strong
To show by signs the paynyms did him wrong
Astlepeodet syttyng as judge than
Though he to Albon had great hatered
yet because of Dioclesyan
To slay the martyr durst not proceed
Till he had sent letters as I read
To the emperor rehersyng how Albon
Forsaken had their gods every chone
Enformyng him of his obstinacy
How all their gods he set also at naught
And how their power pleynly he does defye
And was made christen of heart will and thought
And has also subtylly ways thought
The peoples hertes from our gods withdraw
In their despyte to follow a new law
But the great and kind famylyaryte
which Albon had with the emperor
Because also of his great dignite
And of his kynne had so great favor
That the judge drad for to do rygour
Upon this prince of death or cruelte
Till from the emperor he had auctorite
And but there done great execution
By high advise of all the hole empire
To punysshe all tho from false rebellyon
which to destroy your gods so desire
with which letters the emperor set a fire
Abode no longer / but hastyly began ordeyne
To send his fellow down into Brytayne
And in great have the story tells express
Dioclesyan has sent a great power
with Maxymyan called Herculesse
Into Braytayne to search out the mattier
where that any were found far or nere
Of Christis faith to sleyne euerychone
without mercy / except only Albon
His life to save by a condition
If to their sects he would again restore
From Christis loore / turn his opinion
Of their gods / the stantes to support
To Dioclesyan that they may report
How that Albon does him sore repent
To Christis faith / that he did assent
Made him promise / so that he would turnen
To their idols / with feigned fair langage
Among with thretninges they daily him adiuren
To peruerte his heart and his courage
But ever ylyche of chere and of visage
Between fire and water / now hard now bla^dysshyng
From his constance they might him never bring
Like a strong tower bylte on a high mountain
Took none head of their monitions
Stood in our faith so stable and so certain
Their rich promysse of castles and of towns
with many lordshyps in diverse regyons
He set at naught / by grace and by virtue
His ground to stable he abode in Christ Iesue
Than by precepte of Dioclesyan
If he not change for fayrenes nor for dread
The charge was yeuen to Maxymyan
By judgment and dome to taken head
To assign a knight to smyten of his head
Such one as had in knyghthode high renoune
Should on this prince done executioune
This was so commanded by sentence
Of the emperor that Amphibalus
If he were take by notable violence
without mercy should be served thus
By judgment cruel and furyous
Made naked first and to a stake bound
At his nauyll made a large wound
He compelled among the cruel route
At the nauyll his bowels to be take
And his guts serched round about
Like a long rope tied to a stake
And of his life so an end make
And at last void of all pytye
Smite of his heed by furyous cruelty.
This was the dome touching the torments
Of blessed Albon and Amphibalus
Falsely concluded in the iugementes
Of Maxymyan / mine auctor tells thus
with Asclepeodet wode and contraryus
In that city both two there present
In Verolamy / which yafe this judgment
The citezyns gathered enuiron
For this matter with great diligence
Both of London and many other town
Of judgment to here that sentence
youen upon Albon in open audience
Under these words put in remembrance
As ye shall here rehearsed in substance
Time of the emperor Dioclesyan
when he stood highest in his majesty
At Verolamy the story tell can
when Albon was lord of that city
Tho days called for his dignity
Record of chronicles / which list not feyne
Prince of knights and steward of Bretayne
During his life to have possession
All his power aforne has be practysed
But now for he by false rebellyon
Of wylfulnes and malice has despised
Beforne these days by antiquite devised
The old worshyps notable and famous
Done to Iubyter Appollo and Venus
For which cause let every man take heed
Like as the law concludes of right
By judgment in have he to be deed
His head smyten of first in the peoples sight
By the hands of some old worthy knight
Because the martyr was of high renown
There should a knight done execution
By dome also after when he were deed
The place assigned by sort or adventure
From the body / when parted was the heed
The corpse there should have his sepulture
Passing an other private creature
There to be graven the body with the heed
Joined to gether in a great chest of leed
with him buried his cross and his sclaueyne
A large tomb for a memoryall
This was the dome of the iuges tweyne
In Verolame city full royal
To avenge their gods infernal
Upon Albon when they did deem
Again their laws for a false blaspheme
Dempte he was cause of mysauenture
That their lands brought forth no grain
The benefytes withdrawn of nature
To cherisshe their fruit come noder dew nor reyne
By sodeyn vengeance as ye have herd me seyne
Diuersely their sorrows were made double
To find the cause what made all this trouble
Either it come by some froward adventure
By wytchecrafte or by sorcery
which so long upon them does endure
Either by artmagyke or by nygramancy
Each dempt after his fantasy
within the city they said eke many one
It come for vengeance of saint Albone
with this sodeyn unware aduersite
I troubled was all the regyon
Of Verolamy the greattest of that city
Made among them a convocation
Of all the country / city / borough / and town
The wysest come down from each party
Against this myschefe to shape a remedy
Among them self cast a prouydence
wrong that was don to Albon in that town
Against truth and good conscience
Of this myschefe / was chief occasyon
And by assent to relece his prison
Their aduersite so might be amended
By mean of him / to whom they had offended
Barefote and bare when that he was take
Like a prisoner brought to their presence
Of this matter a counsel they began make
Dempt of reason in him was none offense
For at them self began the violence
And he stood quite in their opinion
Of his injury having compassyon
They considered his blood and his kynred
His alyaunce and his high noblesse
For they stood a parcel in great dread
All the city troubled with heaviness
To se their lord brought in such distress
Causyng that city and that famous town
To stand in rumor and great discention
Saying their steward that was so noble a knight
And a man fre borne of that city
His famous line down descendyng right
From the Romans of old antiquite
By comparyson the cronycle who list se
The stock conveyed of him that was so good
First from Troyans and from Romayn blood
First from the party / for to speak of Troy
He had with Ector magnanimyte
Of whose noblesse all Brytayne may have joy
Sad a Scipion void of duplicite
And Verolamy that famous old city
May well rejoice / renewed ever in lyche
with his relyques that it is made so rich
And to rehearse of his conditions
A ryghtfull prince in all his governance
In him was never found occasyons
Of froward meaning / nor double varyance
Never meant to no man displeasance
Peysed all this alas void of refuge
Now like a thief he stand aforne the judge
But to refourme his birth and lyberte
The chief of the city did their busy pain
This noble prince among them to go free
From bond or fetters / or noise of any chain
But thereupon the martyr began complain
within him self lest such noise and sown
In any wise should let his passion
That kind of mercy / which they did him show
Of his pains by a manner of allegeaunce
The martyr (...) to speak in words few
It was to him most odious vengeance
For his desire and his herty pleasance
was only this short process to make
To suffer death only for Christis sake
with herty sobbyng profounde and deep
Toward heaven mekely he kest his sight
Of inward constreynt pitously can weep
The cross aforne him devoutly held vpryght
Cryenge to Jesus have mercy on thy knight
Let not the fend by no collusyon
Stere the people to let my passion
To the people turnyng his knyghtly face
Said unto them of heart and hole courage
your feigned favor your dissymuled grace
May in this case do me none advantage
Fully disposed to perform my viage
For to accomplysshe like as I have begone
In Christ Jesus my tryumphe may be won
Sith I am ready for to endure pain
Of my free will why suffer ye so long
Of my desire I desire most sovereign
For Christis sake to endure pains strong
My martyrdom / why do ye so prolonge
In your ententagayne me ye do err
That I do covet so long to differ
I maruayle how ye may sustain
Of negligence so long to abide
while the martyr is new fresshe and grene
Execution for to set a side
Look your statutes and thereupon provide
Unto your gods reports how that I
Of all the world am their most ennemy
Sith they be wrought of men that been mortal
Unworthy preued to bear any dignity
But forged ydols of stones and metal
Falsely usurped again the deyte
Foles do wrong to knele upon their knee
For who calls to them they give none audience
Domme as a stock / void of intelligence
A fool is he among foles all
To a blind stock / that kneleth to have sight
And so is he that does for strength call
To him that has no power nor no might
Can not discern between darkness and light
Large lypped words have they none
Of tongue meued / as any stock or stone
O fruteles hope / O false trust dispayred
O vanyte / O rudenes detestable
O appearance with manhood foul appared
O ignorance passing abhomynable
O Idolaters of courage most unstable
why worship ye in your conceytes blind
Cursed mawmets / yt have another wit nor mind
They be proved worse of condition
Less of power sothely than be ye
Of worldly things ye have inspection
They have great eien yet they may not se
Boistous hands / they feel nothing parde
Their arms long they make no diffence
with their defe ears may have none audience
what thing is worse than give the souereynts
Of your handwarke to forge falls images
Defe blind and dombe / unto whose deyte
Though ye call ay afforne their visages
They know nothing thentent of your langages
Of all five wits they be so defectyfe
what causes this / but lack of soul and life
For how might he verrayle in deed
without felyng of joy or heaviness
Restore to life folks that been deed
Or make them hole that plain of their sykenes
For all distress disceyte or doublenes
Of worldely myscheues sought on each party
was first brought in by false ydolatrye
A man that has memory of reason
whom god has made like to his image
Is foul blent in his discretion
To falls ydols to knele or do homage
woe be to them ruin and damage
Trouble myschyefe unto one and all
To such mawmettry that for help call
when the paynyms herd and understood
That they might not remove his conscience
From Christ Jesus that dyed upon the rode
For fair nor foul / for favor nor violence
To do by their counsel and all of one sentence
A place assigned like their opinion
Should at Holmehurst suffer his passion
In their opinion by controuersye
Stood at debate as they were applied
what manner death Albon should dye
which has their gods and their sect denied
Some of a cross would have him crucyfyed
Other there were / that did in malice rave
would have him quick karued in his grave
Some also aforne or he were deed
Of false envy and furyous wodenes
would have his eien out of his heed
That he should in myschefe of blyndnes
All desolate and abiecte in darkness
Follow his master with his eien blind
Of adventure till he might him find
Echeon concludyng that he shall be deed
And finally thus was their judgment
Lad to Holmehurst there smite of his heed
The cruel iuges with paynyms of assent
Like a lamb / monges wolfes all to rent
Toward his death and pitous passion
In cheynes bound led him through the town
No favor showed lettyng nor obstacle
But cruel rygour void of all pity
Like as men gone to some uncouth spectacle
People come down his martyrdom to se
The judge alone left in the city
Like turmentours this was their furyous cry
Out of this town draw forth our ennemy
By experience at eye ye may deem
Like his desert so follows him his chance
To our gods most odious blaspheme
Ground and gynnyng of our sodeyn greuance
On whom they list to show their vengeance
This was their noise far from all reason
As they him lad toward his passion
There was so great concors of folks about
The multitude began always to multiply
Of paynyms contagious was the route
The ground so full on every party
Men might uneath any space epsy
To stand upon / mine auctor list not feyne
wha^ blessed Albon was led toward his pain
The fervent hete of the summer son
Has with his streams / the soil so clad and brent
Up in the lion as his course has run
with his brennyng the ground was almost shent
Under the fete where as the people went
The soil so hot of sodeyn adventure
For enchaufynge they might not endure
Lasting this hete / when Phoebus shone so clear
The people in nombre waxed more then less
Till that they come to a great ryuere
whose sturdy wawis would not suffer them pass
The great depenes began them to manasse
The bridge streite / the people so great and huge
That many one were dreynt in that diluge
Great preace of people down to the water came
The river deep / the bridge narowe and small
They that could over the river swam
who that could not turned over as a ball
The comberous preace caused many a fall
The noise was great the rumor and complaynt
In his passage of people that was dreynt
Favor was none of brother unto brother
They were so busy to pass the river
In that great pride each man oppressed other
To pass the bridge there was so great daungere
The hete importable that time of the year
Caused many one / which on the bridge stood
For great fayntnes / to fall in to the flode
This great myschefe when Albon began behold
Moved of mercy and of compassyon
with weeping eyes as they water would
Unto the earth fill on his knees down
His look vpcast with great devotion
Toward heaven making his prayere
To Christ Jesus said as ye shall here
O lord Jesus out of whose blessed side
when thou for man were nailed on the rode
Through whose heart / there did a spear glyde
At which wound ran water out and blood
O blessed lord most merciful and good
So as I saw in mine auisyon
Out of thyn heart two lycours ran adown
That is to say / red blood and water clear
Those two lycours of our redemption
At my request dry up this river
Staunche the floode and here mine oryson
And take this people under thy protection
Suffer that they with dry fete may wend
Of my passion to se an end
And whyls the tears from his eien ran
Down by his chekes on each party
By devout prayer of this holy man
All suddenly the river was made dry
The flode staunched and vanysshed as a sky
He neded not the manner out to search
when god by grace list any thing to werche
For he that made maugre Pharao
The people of Israel pass the red see
with dry fete / the same lord even so
was that Albon kneled upon his knee
Prayeng the lord of grace and pity
Grant the people to have inspection
And pass the river to sen his passion
An uncouth maruayle / a gracious miracle
Folks drounde / low at the bottom said
with gods might / where may be none obstacle
The river dry / found was again
Void of moisture / smothe was and plain
Of the holy martyr / the virtue always mored
Folk aforne drownde / to life were restored
No token of death was in their faces said
But quick and lively to every man's sight
These great miracles notable in certain
First of the river / dried by gods might
All this considered the self same knight
which was assigned for to do vengeance
On blessed Albon / fill in repentance
The same knight astonyed and aferde
which through Albon toward his passion
Of god visited / cast away his sword
Before the martyr / mekely kneled adowne
And unto god made his confession
Besechyng Albon of comfort and socour
In humble wise beknowyng his error
Servant of god / O blessed man Albon
Thy god only / is very god certain
There is no god sothly but he alon
All other gods bear here name in vein
By the miracles / which that I have seyne
I dare affirm / the troth it does well preue
He is very god / on whom that I believe
I wot right well he is mighty and is good
For in a moment / through his magnyfycence
At thy request voyded has the flood
As lord of lords most digne of reverence
None like to him of power and potence
which on this earth as sovereign lord and king
Passing all other / does maruayles in werchynge
Set all a side the deed bears wytnes
Of no collusyon nor of no false apparaunce
Of godly might showing his greatness
Right as it is in very existence
For which I ask of all old negligence
Mercy / and pray for my trespace
O glorious martyr / that lord to do me grace
There is no lord / but only Christ Jesus
He is my lord and I will be his knight
which made these stremes to depart thus
A great miracle wrought in the peoples sight
His power is great / and he is most of might
All falls gods here I do forsake
And to his mercy all holy I me take
This knight by grace thus suddenly converted
The name of whom was Araclius
which thing when paynyms have aduerted
They fell upon him as wolfes dispitous
Touching the river / said it was not thus
It weren their gods and none other wight
That wrought this miracle by their great might
Our mighty gods most famous and most good
Of their benyngne gracious influence
They have avoided this river and this flood
Of whose secrets we have experience
And in effect full notable evidence
which for our sake / if it be well sought
For our passage this miracle have we wrought
For to accomplysshe that we have begone
Again our most enemy like to our entention
Our god most mighty the fyry fervent son
with his great hete and beams yuyronne
Has rauysshed with a short conclusyon
This glorious Phoebus with his streams clear
The watery moisture of this great ryuere
They have considered our great devotion
which we have toward their deyte
How we labor for execution
Again their most ennemy found in the city
But for hinder their magnanymytie
Though thou in contrary accordyst with Albon
Have an opinion against us euerychone
Thus was their langage and their dalyance
Of hateful malice against this true knight
with great rebukes for his repentance
Fill upon him like wolfes anon right
And called him in all the peoples sight
To their gods he was a falls blaspheme
worthy to dye / of malice thus they deem
Ran upon him with pains full uncouth
Of great malice they had unto Albon
First they smyten the tethe out of his mouth
And there they brake his bones euerychone
without wound membre was left none
Of mind of heart always hole he stood
For in his breast the faith of Christ abode
Only by grace he had this auantage
In his belefe so holy did he stand
which for his faith might suffer no damage
Kept his promise / which he took in hand
He left half deed lyeng upon the strande
Fro wycke or worse / fro crime to crime in deed
Like homycydes the paynyms began proceed
with broke bones / this pytous wounded knight
was on the stronde left with deedly chere
Pale of hew / might not sit vpryght
As the story in order does us lere
By many a stubbe and many a sharp brere
Barefote they led him / void of compassyon
This blessed Albon toward his passion
That he was bare the traces were welll seyne
For with his blood the soil was dyed read
Made his passage toward a high mounteyne
Through sharp stones / quare as speres hedde
Thus entreated aforne or he was deed
without weeping / what erthely creature
Might se a prince / such deadly pain endure
Steadfast of heart his trust would never fail
Grounded in god and in his faith so stable
Goth up the hill to accomplysshe his battle
And there were people verily innumerable
The son was hot / the hete importable
In point almost with feruence and with dust
To slay the people with a sodeyn thurst
Constrained with hete began cry each one
Of cursed malice and great malyncoly
Upon the martyr made assaute anon
And said through his magyke and his sorcery
That they were like through mortal thurst to dye
Against whose deedly furyous cruelte
Blessed Albon began show his charity
To pray for them that did him most turment
This was his custom and his old usage
with hole heart and humble true intent
Prayed god with tears in his visage
Of this myschefe to stynt the great rage
That the people should in no degree
Because of him to suffer aduersyre
O lord quod he / for thy heavenly empire
Like as thou art most mighty of pusance
Thy smothe wind by grace let enspire
Called zepherus to do them allegiance
This rygours air with dew of attemperance
Between hot and cold set a mean in deed
Or thou do vengeance mercy may proceed
Of this myschefe ordeyne a relece
without vengeance suffer people gone
That whylom made thy servant Moses
with his yerde to smite upon a dry stone
At whose touching come water out anon
Now gracious lord with new stremes fresshe
On this hill these people do refresshe
Thy gracious mercy from them do not expelle
Of blessed Albon rehearsed this prayer
At his tete anon sprange up a well
Full plentous with cristall stremes clear
A wonders thing / and a maruaylous to here
From a dry hill of moystyr void at all
To se spryng a well clerer than cristall
Of which water there was so great foyson
And of that spring so gracious habundance
That from above there came a river down
This holsom streme was of so great pleasaunce
To staunche their thurst found there suffisance
The hete aswaged the people out of dispreyre
By gods grace so temperate was the air
Thus was the people refresshed at their lust
By the holy martyr merciful and good
yet of false malice they had a froward thurst
In their corages like furyous folk and wode
Again nature for to shede blood
The blood of him / which in their disease
By his prayer their myschefe did appese
Their thirst was staunched / they were refresshed well
But a false thurst of malice and hatered
In their desires / was staunched never a dele
They were besye the blys full blood to shed
Of him that help them in great need
Like blasphemous / making a false obstacle
Gave unto the son thank for this miracle
with voice vpraysed falsely they began
Thus they said of outragyous clamor
Praysyng and laud be to you the son
which in this myschefe has be our savior
Stau^ched our thurst / with his gracious lycour
By his beams most fresshe and clear shynyng
Us to releue made a well up spryng.
Verba translatoris
O people unkind blinded with falls error
O froward people / rude / dull / and obstinate
O beastiall folk / forthest from all savor
Of grace and virtue / o people unfortunate
In your conceyte / o folk most indurate
That god has showed for love of Albon
ye gyfe thanks to images made of stone
O most unhappy / o people ungracious
worse than beastis / o void of all reason
O cruel tygrys / o wolfes furyous
O folysshe asses / dull of discretion
Falsely to deem in your opinion
Thing that Albon by grace of god has won
ye yefe the laud other to sterre or son
ye set a side the southfast son of life
The son of grace that does all the world gye
which may you save again all mortal strife
To all our sores may do best remedy
ye do great wrong for to defye
This worldly son from temporal bryghtnes
And to forsake the son of ryghtwysenes
Like false blasphemus forsook your creature
And do worship to a creature
The son of life may clyppis no shoure
whose heavenly beams by record of scripture
yeueth light of grace to every creature
But ye arne froward his influence to take
And for your ydols his lordshyps to forsake
what may avail Jupiter or Saturn
Or cruel Mars / that causes strife or war
Or worldely Phoebus / ye one day does her soiurne
The night comes on / the light is fro you far
And eke your Venus / called the day sterre
All these rekened in your mad wodenesse
Called of your custom gods and goddess
God that this day showed here
To magnify his glorious knight Albon
with a fresshe well / and dried the river
Reken up your gods and forget never one
Of these miracles / forsooth his part is none
A fool is he that of them does retche
Since unto such thing their power may not stretche
Of their power me list no more to entreat
which leads men unto their dampnation
Mars nor Jupiter / nor Phoebus with his hete
May do no favor nor mytigation
Again the myschefe like your opinion
The said miracles were wrought by virtue
For love of Albon by grace of Christ Iesue
your disctetions ben so foul blent
your conceyt derke / and false in your opinion
Magre your mawmettes in all my best intent
I woll proceed with hole affection
To accomplysshe up the holy passion
Of saint Albon by grace of his favor
In his translation following mine auctour.
After these miracles showed at the well
A gracious treasure a yefte of great price
Like here toforne as ye have herd me tell
yet for all that following their old auice
The people abode still in their malice
From the mounteyne / cast not for to wend
Of the martyr till they have made an end
First hent his locks that were long and large
Malycyously bound them to a stake
Chose out a knight / and on him laid the charge
Tha^ in all have he should him ready make
And a sword sherpe in his hand take
And they him bad having of god no dread
with a great stroke to smite of his head
The head hynge still / the body fell to ground
His cross also all besprent with blood
Kept for a relyque / when it was after found
Maugre paynyms contagious and wode
For among them secretly there stood
A christen man / the which took keep
The said cross devoutly for to keep
This turmentour this cursed paynym knight
He that smote of the head of saint Albon
By vengeance he has lost his sight
Both his eien fill from his head anon
without recure his worldly joy was gone
which first was glad to make the martyr blede
Like his disceyt deserved has his mede
This wounded knight / which in the valey abode
Araclius as ye have herd me devise
The death of Albon when he understood
which for feebleness might not arise
Began pain him self in full pitous wise
Among paynyms as he might him keep
with hand and foot upon the hylle to crepe
Upon the monition of the same knight
Aforsayd him self on hand and foot to gone
The judge him met and spoke to him thus right
Thou that have so many a broke bone
Clymbe up fast and pray to thyn Albone
Cease not / but cry upon him sore
Thy broke bones and wounds to restore
First of all run to him and take heed
To be made hole of thine infirmyte
unto the body / join again the head
And in all have thou shalt recured be
From all sykenes and aduersyte
And after that oo thy busy cure
To ordeyne for his sepulture
And sith thou art a knight of his doctrine
Let se what he may now do the avail
To make the hole by craft of medycyne
Call unto him fast / and look that thou not fail
And thou shalt find an uncouth marvel
If thou not cesse upon him for to cry
Against all sykenes / thou shalt find remedy
This maimed knight yafe good audience
To that the judge said in derysyon
All set in fire with sodeyn hot feruence
Began to abrayde of great devotion
I trust quod he of hole affection
Only by virtue and merytes of Albon
God unto health me may restore anon
Through his power and his magnyfycence
The eternal lord may by his great might
By the prayer and merciful clemence
Of him that is his master / and he his knight
I that am lame to make me go vpryght
And these words said / with great love and dread
So as he might crope up to the head
with great devotion he began the heed embrace
To the heed he brought it anon right
All bedewed with weeping was his face
Of woeful heart to se that pytous sight
That holy prince albon Christis own knight
By whose merit / when he crepte on the ground
All suddenly he rose up hole and sound
And when he was restored again to his strength
He yafe praysyng laud and reverence
with humble chere fill prostrate in length
Thankyng god of entier diligence
And in the peoples open audience
Seized not saint Albon for to praise
For love of whom Christ Jesus did him raise
His force against Christ made him to recure
The people present might se and know
Than he devoutly made a sepulture
Gadryng stones lyenge on a row
Laid the martyr in the ground down low
And all a lofte his labor was well seen
He covered it with torues fresshe and grene
whereof paynyms had great envy
when they beheld how the same knight
Restored was and hole in each party
So suddenly to his force and might
whereof astonyed was every man and wight
Thought in them self it was again nature
A brosed man so soon forto recure
Again this knight they took their consayle
Among them began his death conspyre
Thought it should be to them great avail
To slay this man they were so set a fire
His hasty death so greatly they desire
Some said that he had in his intent
Some wychecrafte or some experiment
Some other said in their judgment
Like their own false immagynatyfe
This was wrought by inchauntement
Or by some magyke had a preseruatyfe
Not to be slain with dagger / sword / nor knyfe
But so were / the story does remember
That he were hew in pieces every membre
Among them self was great controversy
And each of them began his verdyte show
Till it befell of malice and envy
Falls paynyms in nombre not a few
In pieces small / have him all to hew
Of his recuryng having no manner of dread
All of one assent they smote of his head
This blessed knight as the story says
Stood always in one in his perseverance
Of will / of heart / steadfast in the faith
List not change for turment nor penance
To holy Albon egall inconstance
As he was made fellow of his victory
So is he now partable of his glory
After all this vengeable cruelte
And all this mortal furyous violence
For to go home again to their city
To all the people the judge yafe license
At their departing all of one sentence
And with one voice / homwarde as they resort
Their langage was as the story does report
woe that judge that does none equite
woe be to him that does no ryghtwysenes
And woe to him that can have no pity
woe to that judge governed with wodenes
And woe to him that of false hastynes
works upon will by false collusyon
without title of truth or of reason
This was the noise the rumor and the cry
when they departed home from the mountain
Truth will out magre falls envy
Ryghtwysenes may not be hyd it is certain
As for a time it may be ouerlayne
By ensample as passed is the daungere
Of stormy weders / Phoebus is most clear
Our gracious lord Jesus most benyngne
which all governs by eternal might
List to show many a gracious sign
Following upon the self same night
After the passion of his blessed knight
Out of whose tomb was seen an heavenly stre^^
Assendyng upward bright as the son beam^
The same time when folks to bed went
Over the city / this bright streme began shine
Last all the night no man knew what it meant
Upward erecte right as any line
The people saw / how it did enlumyne
The long night as god did ordain
To all four parts stretchyng of Bretayne
with this uncouth maruaylous miracle
was seen and herd during all the night
People gathered to look upon that spectacle
Between joy and dread / reioysyng of that light
As they could discern and know of right
This was the ditie / which in that light was song
As following is written in latin tongue
Albanus vir egregius martyr extat gloriosus
And were there seen assendyng up and down
In the celestial glorious bright sky
Heavenly angels that made noise and sown
with this refret in this armonye
Let us with song vpreyse and magnyfye
The laud of Albon notable and glorious
This day with martyrs made victorious
Albanus vir egregius martyr extat gloriosus
This song was herd by report through ye town
And remembered upon each party
For a synguler commendation
Of him that was prince of his chyualrye
Steward of Bretons to govern them and gye
whose synguler laud and tryumphe glorious
This day with martyrs is made viccorious
Albanus vir egregius martyr extat gloriosus
This noble prince of Brutis Albion
Has suffered death and mortal turmentrye
Stable of heart this Christis champyon
Having dispite of all idolatrye
This blessed martyr crowned above so high
with angels song soete and melodious
This day with martyrs is made victorious
Albanus vir egregius martyr extat gloriosus.
O prothomartyr full famous of renown
Among paynyms having the maistrye
To be cause ground and destruction
In Verolamy of all false mawmettrye
Thy life for Christ has put in ieopartye
For which this day with song melodyous
Thou art with martyrs made victorious
Be unto that city supportour and patron
Keep them from sorrow / sykenes / and malady
From pestilence and ill infection
And of their enemies repress all tyranny
which be fraunchised with the regallye
Of thy presens / o martyr glorious
with all that longs to the and to thyn house
And blessed martyr most lowly I the requere
which abydest in the heavenly mantion
with laurer crowned above the sterres clear
Only of mercy to have compassyon
If ought be said in this translation
Here begins the third book / which tells of the conversion of many of
the paynims unto the faith. And also of the martyrdom of holy Amphibalus /
which converted saint Albon to the faith of Christ. which Amphibalus was the
princes son of wales.
Miracles showed / and maruayles many fold
This blessed martyr for to magnyfye
As here toforne ye have herd me told
The night illumyned with the golden sky
Song of angels with heavenly armony
The people astonyed tremblyng in the derke
To se how Christ list for the martyr work
But on your breast remember your trespass
To therth fall prostrate down
Prays to the lord for to do you grace
Of your offense and transgression
Or that he take vengeance on your town
Trusts plainly / whether ye be wroth or feign
All this wrought for him that ye have slain
This light from heaven / which yt is descended
For Albon showed / and the golden sky
Let us repent of that we have offended
Of our trespass mercy to Jesus cry
And forsake all ydolatrye
Taking ensample all by one accord
Of this martyr that whylome was our lord
we may consydre a thing against nature
How the night with her derke derkenesse
Passing reason of any creature
Is by miracle turned to bryghtnesse
Of angels herd a melodious swetnes
And all thing brefely to comprehend
For the merytes of Albon to commend
Maugre mawmettes / which can but disceyue
Impotent and very feeble of might
By experience as ye conceive
Bryghter than day has made the derke night
To declare the merytes of his knight
Plainly to show light of his perfytenes
which may not be clypsed by no foreyn derkenes
Again this lord / which is most of might
we have erred in our opinion
And done unto him great wrong and unright
To make our faith and our professyon
To falls idols / which in this royal town
we have so long in our paynem wise
As idolatres do froward service
Let us now dampne all such error
And forsake with entier diligence
All false gods / which may do no socour
To their servants present nor absence
wherefore let us now clear our conscience
And axe forgyfenes of our lord Jesus
which has in Albon showed so great virtue
Let us not tarry / but in all have we can
Go seche means for our salvation
In diverse countres to find up the man
whche by his labor and predication
Converted Albon in the same town
To Christis faith / that martyr most benyngne
This night declared by many an uncouth sign
From our rytes and ceremonies old
And false errors enclypsed with darkness
Done to mawmettes / with whom we were wholde
Of ignorance by consuete rudenes
And to direct and clarifye our blyndnes
From all error and ydolatrye
The best way that I can epsy
By these miracles / which Christ Jesus has wrought
For love of Albon the same night
That his master may in have be sought
For it is lykely according well to right
Sith god has showed such miracle for his knight
He that was cause of his conversion
Might best provide for our salvation
I mean as thus in very equite
Sith god in Albon has showed such virtue
His master should have great authority
That was sent him by grace of Christ Jesus
To put our doubt at a plain issue
By miracles declaryng new and new
His masters teaching faithful was and true
All that people being in presence
Of god enspired as by one assent
with one voice commendyng that sentence
Gafe the favor in all their best intent
Took their way by great auisement
Toward wales and sought on every side
Serchyng the country where he should abide
Of whose preaching notable was the fame
Both in his living and perfyte holiness
Full glad they were / when they herd his name
And toward him fast they began them dress
As the story plainly bears witness
Came by grace where he did teach
The word of god / and to the people preche
And full devoutly upon him they abode
Having aforne him right great audience
As they come to him / even as he stood
And him saluted with great reverence
Greatly reioysyng of his devout presence
Offered to him or they ferther gone
The same cross he yafe unto Albon
The which cross was newly sprent with blood
when he for Christ suffered passion
By which token full well he understood
That he was slain / fell on his knees down
Kyssyng the cross with great devotion
In his arms with tears all be reyned
That holy relyque full swetely he has streyned
He thanked god with devout observance
And that martyrs humble patience
This new people with devout attendance
which was come to yefe him audience
All at ones with full great reverence
And heart contrite knelyng on their knees
Forsook their ydols and old vanytees
Their myspent time to them was great loss
To all virtue an odious spectacle
Till time they were marked with the cross
In their forhede by grace and miracle
with that victorious tryumphall signacle
And following on / like their first intent
Received of baptism the holy sacrament
within a while the fame went abroad
Far about in story as I read
Diverse countres of this thing how it stood
Till at last the noise began sprede
Of Verolamy / how verily in deed
Citezyns their goods have forsake
A full great nombre / and their journey take
To follow the traces of Amphibalus
A new preacher strange and foreyne
Their old rytes false and superstitious
They have renounsed and hold all that ben vain
They have also of very high disdain
From them abiecte / mine aucter list not lie
All their ydols and false mawmettrye
when the rumor was come unto the city
They were troubled / having great maruayle
what it meant or what it should be
At prime face like a great dissauayle
To comen profit they dempt in their counsel
It was full like their city to encombre
Enquered first what failed of their nombre
In their rolls were a thousand found
And their names entytled euerychone
A thing lykely the city to confound
But remedy ordained were anon
That such a nombre by assent were gone
By great auise cast it was dew
A mighty thing tho folk to pursewe
And with strong hand serched out the rote
Of this matter in hope it should avail
They gathered them on horseback and on foot
And began ordeyne a mighty strong battle
Of sundry folk armed in plate and mayle
Against fugytifes gone out of the cite
And on Amphibalus avenged for to be
Of whose person so notable was the fame
Through all wales and contres enuiron
That the report of his good name
Began to increase thorough all the regyon
Of his doctrine and predication
which through wales shone like a lode sterre
Them to direct / which in our faith does err
Tho folk that were come to him of new
From Verolamy his preaching for to here
Like a doctor in Christis faith most true
Received them with all his heart entiere
Informed them and taught them the maniere
Cf Christis law with busy diligence
And they were glad to abide in his presence
Little and little in he began them draw
To catch faith and savor in his doctrine
Of hole heart forsook the paynyms law
And with great will their courage did enclyne
So to persevere / and so their life to fine
In Christis law as folk that list not tarry
So for to abide and never more to vary
Other there were / which began pursewe
The said people of malice and of hate
This new doctrine of Christis trans^newe
which come upon armed with mayle and plate
Sent from that city of purpose to debate
Against them / which that for Christis sake
Faith of paynyms unawarely has forsake
Followed after with rumor noise and sown
To fall upon them with sodeyn adventure
Serchyng in wales about town and town
Of Amphibalus the presence to recure
which like a clerk grounded in scripture
To that people at reverence of our lord
Stood among them / and preached gods word
And one there was for anger almost wode
That brake first out showing his conceyte
To Amphibalus among them as he stood
whereof that people was all and hole receyte
O thou quod he ground of all disceyte
Rote of fraud / falsenes / and treachery
To all our gods traitor and enemy
That thou have done thou may it not forsake
Of froward contempt malyciously practiced
Against our gods a quarrel for to take
Their laws old presumptously despised
As these people contagiously disguysed
To great damage of us and of our cite
which trust me well shall not unpunished be
It is no doubt it shall not abide long
Of their injury and their godly greuance
As they be most mighty and most strong
They suddenly shall take on the vengeance
But if thou will eschew their pusance
First do repent the / to find them more tretable
And seche a mean to make them merciful
First of all do thy business
Of their great ire to appese the rancour
Before these people / show outward thy mekenes
To louse the bonds / which by thy labor
Thou have them brought in full great error
Be so besy again with faithful attendance
Them to counsel to fall in repentance
Gyfe them counsel and make them to assent
with heart and body no danger for to make
To axe mercy and sore repent
Or sodeyn vengeance be on them take
Of that they have our gods forsake
For this no doubt but it be done in deed
we shall again them vengeably proceed
For if they stand in their first error
As they began froward and obstynate
They shall of mercy find no favor
without exception of high or low estate
But like as people most unfortunate
Dye upon the sword take this for full sentence
As is concluded by marcyall violence
yet there was one supprised with feruence
Of Christis law steadfast in the faith
which had both connyng and eloquence
And for his master holy wryt he laythe
To thylke paynym even thus he says
Our lord god / which called is Jesus
Shall be this day our refuge and virtue
And our chief help in tribulation
which shall percase show some miracle
By his most mighty dominacion
Therefore these folk an uncouth spectacle
That there again shall be none obstacle
Through gods might and merciful goodness
Some man to same of his sodeyn sykenes
Our master here whom that ye repreue
In Christis name to show an evidence
From all myschefe some syke man to releue
which lies outraged by mortal violence
But to declare the magnyfycence
Of Christ Jesus anon without more
To health again such one he shall restore
Not incouert but in your alther sight
we have such trust in his parfynesse
Fro whose doctrine as we have behyght
we shall not change for death not distress
without faynyng or any doubleness
your counsellyng in Christis holy name
Follow his teaching and to do the same
ye threte fast to maken us aferde
But god alone he is our defense
Jesus is strong again spear and sword
Under whose pauise of parfyte patience
we shall abide concludyng in sentence
we forsake all false ydolatrye
And for Christis sake ready for to dye
Favor of blood nor none allyaunce
Cherysshyng of treasure nor promise of kynred
Expert kynred nor none acqueyntance
Fair behestes / manaces nor hatered
All set aside both love and dread
The faith of Christ of hole heart we have take
All false ydols and mawmettes we forsake
Of this answer the paynyms almost wode
Like tygrys fell / vengeable as lions
Of innocents to shede the christen blood
with sharp swerdes like ravenous felons
They kill and slay of all conditions
As hongry wolfes in their beastiall rage
whithout exception of old or young of age
The father there again all skylle and right
Of his son took his deadly wound
Brother and brother was slain in that fight
And with their speres / that were square and round
Their nygh cosyns were glad to confound
There was none spared of blood nor kynred
without mercy each others blood to shed
Of aged folk there was no reverence
In that unkindly sodeyn cruel shoure
Myddell age / nor age of innocence
Nor blood of blood list know his neybour
Nor none to other list show his favor
Echon were slain the story tells thus
And were converted by Amphibalus
Froward tyrants that this people sleeth
Most mercyles with pollar sword and knyfe
Each preased in aforne other toward the death
So ametous was that charytable strife
Like folk that were glad to lose their life
Of one courage and of one patience
To dye for Christ / so hole was their feruence
Among these holy seyntes euerychone
That forsook their town and their cite
There was none left alive but one
Of all that come Amphibalus to see
which by occasyon of his infirmyte
Abode behind feeble and impotent
which at their dyenge might not be present
when Anphibalus saw them all deed
Lyggyng in the field / turned up set down
with pitous chere saw their wounds blede
Of woeful heart and compassyon
Devoutly made his commendation
Prayenge Jesus with voice full pytously
On all tho souls to have mercy
At Lychefelde fill all this adventure
This great slaughter and made is mention
Of which flaughter record of old scripture
By days old named was the town
This word Lychefelde by interpretation
Is to say in that tongue as I read
A field that lies full of bodies deed
There these martyrs suffered passion
Of one courage and of one stablenes
The paynyms in their opinion
Most obstinate in their cursednes
Made a vow in their wodenes
Never to eat for none occasyon
Till Amphibalus were brought to their town
Like wodemen they about him ride
The holy man plainly to declare
with speres wounded body back and side
went aforne them with his fete all bare
The more ungoodly / they did with him fare
The more the martyr with chere and visage
Patiently suffered their own outrage
To him they had froward fell langage
The stone weye did him great duresse
And though that he felt in his passage
Under his fete / constreynt of great sharpenes
Mytygation of all his heaviness
was when he the place did approach
where Albon lay grave under a roche
The homecydes of whom to forne I told
Had in this while a manner repentance
Bakwarde among as they began behold
The people slain of their alliance
By their own furyous governance
For they them self like folk that were wode
The slaugter made upon their own blood
Lokyng behind first wha^ they took head and beheld
There own brethern cosyns and kynred
By their hands lay slain in the field
They began to weep / to se their wounds blede
This same time or they took any head
They found a man that lay lanquisshyng
Upon the field most pitous compleynyng
This syke man with a full deadly face
For great constreynt of his malady
Saw Amphibalus forby should pass
with deadly voice began to him cry
Servant of god do me socour or I dye
For Jesus sake lowly I the requere
To help his servant that lies in myschefe here
For by the calling of his holy name
I have such trust in Christ Jesus and the
Though I lie here impotent and lame
By thy merytes thou may help me
To be made hole of this infyrmyte
Maugre paynyms / that can about him prece
Of this clamor would not he sece
In his prayer he does always continue
Such faith he had in his opinion
Paynyms saw he was importune
And so stable in his action
Hadden in disdeyne and in derysion
His great noise / but magre her felnesse
He arose up hole of all his old sykenesse
This seek man that lay bound in pain
Of old sykenesse grievous and importable
By Amphibalus lay bound in a chain
was made all hole / and of his lymmes stable
This can the lord which is most mercyable
Of syke folks here their complayntes
And worche miracles for his holy saints
This miracle gracious and uncouth
First of this man releued of his sykenesse
The death of the martyrs began spring north and southe
Of their wylfull sufferance with mekenes
Homwarde again paynyms began them dress
But this miracle when they did auerte
They were greatly astonyed in their heart
Among them self they brake openly
Though they to Christ were contraryous
Of this miracle wrought suddenly
They spared not plainly to say thus
The god of christen is great and maruaylous
Great is his virtue the deed bears witness
To heal a man so sone in his sykenes
As they told erst / paynyms at last
wonder desirous toward your contre
They rode armed and began to hye fast
And sped them so that they might se
The crested walls of their city
As they thought that time for the best
After labor a while for to rest
They were oppressed with hunger and with thurst
For that time list no forther for to ride
And each one of them following their own lust
Chose his ground a certain home to abide
Their shield their speres set them down a side
Them to refresshe layser they have found
whiles Amhibalus lay in his fecers bound
The turmentours refreshed at the best
As I have told after their werynesse
The holy martyr might have no piece nor rest
Bounden in chains by full great duresse
In his most labor and greattest distress
Maugre paynyms when he a layser caught
To his most soon the word of god he taught
This mean while yt all this thing was wrought
As ye have herd come tydyng to the town
How Amphibalus was to the city brought
Master unto Albon / as made is mention
At whose entering great people there come down
Thought in them self all their heaviness
By his coming was turned in to gladness
Dempte among them both one and all
The matyre had standing other wise
How Amphibalus from Christis faith was fall
Of that law left all his old emprise
Come to their gods to do sacrifice
All their friends with them were repayrde
Of whom toforne they dispayred
The beastiall folk supposed in certain
How all the people that went by assent
To Amphibalus were come home again
By force of them / that were for them sent
But they failed foul in their intent
For through the town the noise went anon
Like as it was / how they were deed euerychone
Again Christis of malice set a fire
Homecydes turmentours that did this cruel deed
which fill upon them in their cruel ire
Tho that made the martyrs for to blede
Of indignation and of great hatered
The self same made relation
Of their slaughter through verolamy town
The fathers wept with sorrowful syghes great
when they herd their sons were deed
Pytous mothers their sobbyng can not let
whose watrye eien with weeping made red
Through the city both in length and bread
wydowes maidens ran with their here to torn
That so suddenly have their friends lorne
Such pitous weeping I trow not there was
At the brennyng of the famous Ilyon
In Troy when the stead of brass
was by sleyght compassed of Synon
For through every street of Verolamy town
This noise was herd deedly and mortal
Like as men sing at feasts funeral
In their most woeful lamentation
They said among them with high and low estate
The time is come of our destruction
Cite of citezyns forsake and desolate
Most outragyous and most disconsolate
To be noted of furyous fell hatered
Blood again blood so felly to proceed
For our defense we have now none excuse
Folk unfortunate by division
we shall from hensforth be called the refuge
As folk abiecte of every nation
So importable is our confusyon
That we be like never to find grace
Among no folk to show ons grace
we can nor may our seluen acquit
For our excuse a reason for to make
But here after that folks will us awyte
Our kynne our blood their gods have forsake
On whom vengeance so mortally was take
In strange country so plainly to descryue
Among also / that none was left alive
Alas alas unburied in the field
Cast out to the beasts that walk in pasture
Kynne again kynne in arms bare on shield
An hateful war / a war again nature
which lie now deed without sepulture
So late done it may not be socoured
Of foul and beast a pray to be devoured
Alas our joy is turned in to despair
The staff broke of our unwieldy age
Our harp troubled / our fortune is not fair
Froward to us she turns her visage
woe to that man that with his langage
Caused Albon our gods to forsake
And magre them / the faith of Christ to take
which has alas perturbed the cite
Brought our welfare to desolation
Ground and gynnyng of this mortalite
Of our alyes and citezyns of the town
whose bodies now lain vpsetdowne
O mighty gods of power immortal
Defend the people of our cite royal
To our request your ears down enclyne
Take vengeance upon our enemy
which is cause of our mortal ruin
And of our myschefe the rote finally
Revenge your wrong ye that be most mighty
On him that causes / that we be seek and groan
Let the vengeance rebounde on his person
Of their plaintes and of their woeful clamours
They seized not like folks most vengeable
Till it fill so that turmentours
Perceived well they were not treatable
How their sorrow was intolerable
Of compassyon list no longer spare
Of all this thing the truth to declare
All suddenly they began to abrayde
Their deedly sorrows and playntes to refrain
Of the most worthy of the town they said
O citezyns / why list ye so complain
Leave your weeping / your tears does restraynt
For by report of us that were present
Void of disceyte or meaning fraudolent
ye have more cause of gladness than weeping
And greatter matter of consolation
Than of distress or of complaynyng
For if the ground be sought out by reason
Touching your friends slaughter and passion
ye have more ground us list not for to feign
For to be glad / than for their death to prayne
By sundry tokens that were contemplatyfe
Of signs showed / the deed bears wytnes
Their death was entered in to everlasting life
End of sorrow concluded on gladness
From this dark valey went up to bryghtnes
where day departed is from the night
And bright Phoebus leseth never his light
It is according full well to nature
A man to weep for friends that be deed
But again ward by record of scripture
For Christis sake / who list his blood to shede
A thousand fold shall receive his mede
And for his life / which is but transytory
Eternally to abide and live in glory
where is no complaynt / nor no part of sorrow
But everlasting gladness in that place
Ilyche new both at eve and at morrow
From woe to joy from sobbyng to solace
where death has lost his power to manace
Fie on dispeyre / for death to make strife
where joy follows of everlasting life
Death in this world should not be complained
Of them that pass from worldely vanite
Such as by grace and mercy have attained
with Christ to reign in his eternal see
where joy is ever and all felicite
And for such folk mydday eve and morrow
It were wodenes for to make sorrow
ye be bound plainly to conclude
To thank god for friends that ye mysse
which has chose so great a multitude
Of this city / and brought them unto bliss
Of joy perpetual they may never mysse
Making a change from this temporal
For thylke life above celestial
Take heed hereto / and yeueth good audience
Of thing that we shall make rehersale
And it imprenteth in your aduertence
Touching your friends slain in battle
whom that we did so mortally assail
All this considered to complain ye do wrong
As ye shall know paraunter or ought long
Aforne rehearsed the same turmentours
with a great oath present there all the town
To them not only / but to their successors
To be reported through all that regyon
Maden there open protestation
Touching this matter they cast to express
Shall have no touch nor spot of falsenesse
They began their matter brefly to conclude
Touching the story to all their intent
In Verolamy to all the multitude
Of great and small being there present
Rehersyng first how that they were sent
with mighty hand to all contres enuiron
To seek their friends / were fled from the town
Under these words spoke for their party
By your byddyng we went as ye well know
with force and armies / serchyng to epsy
To north wales in countres high and low
Till it fell so within a little throw
Lad by fortune / we found them euerychone
with him that whylom was master to Albon
Out of this city they were fled and gone
Some that were full nygh of your allye
Upon the master abydyng of Albon
we found eke gethered a great company
And of Pectis we did also epsy
with walsemen of new that were draw
And converted unto christen law
By thylke clerk that all these things wrought
From whom they would depart in no manner
Among all / our kynred out we sought
Took them aparte / and with full friendly chere
with fair speech requests and prayere
Maynte with manassis / and softness of langage
From that doctrine to revoke their courage
But ever they stood in such obstinacy
On him abydyng each hour and moment
By their answer rather for to dye
All of accord and echeone of assent
List in no wise follow our intent
when we might not our purpose recure
we left our tretes and took our armor
Of which they were not astonyed nor aferde
For Christis sake / each redyer than other
who might first run under the sword
In their metyng brother slain of brother
There was such prese it might be non other
For Christis sake echon were feign
For a prerogatyue / who might first be slain
Upon the son / which was the father heir
The father showed most cruel violence
which in nature was another good nor fair
The son also void of all benevolence
To his father did no manner of reverence
There was no mercy / but marciall outerage
without exception of old or young of age
Patience was captain in the field
Of them that suffered death for Christis sake
Their spear was hope / mekenes was their shield
Other defense they list not for to make
In thylke quarrel / which they had take
List not depart till spent was their blood
which on the plain ran large as a flode
The lord that sytteth above the sterres clear
Saugh and beheld the great patience
Of his knights / whose blood like a ryuere
Ran in the field by mortal violence
whom to comfort of his magnificence
The heaven all open to show his great virtue
Said unto them that blessed lord Jesus
Comes up to me my knights most entere
Proved in battle right victorious
Assendeth up above the sterres clear
My gate is open and ready is my house
Again your coming most rich and glorious
with tryumphe that never shall disseuer
And with a palm that shall lasten ever
O Paradyse / o chosen citezyns
For your notable tryumphall prowess
Making your claim as very denzyns
There to abide your knyghtly nobylnes
To spend your blood / was showed no scarsenesse
For me to suffer death by great outrage
Digne among martyrs / come take your heritage
The amerous fair of fervent desires
In your conquest of most souereyne price
Have give you title to be possessioners
Eternally to claim like your auise
Abydyng space in the heavenly paradise
To be registered fre from all worldly strife
with the holy martyrs in the book of life
From this world we saugh them flee to heaven
By many signs which that did appear
From death to life / above the sterres seven
we stood astonyed beholding the manner
How Christ Jesus with a benyngne chere
List to receive into his regyon
These holy martyrs of Verolamy town
In these nombre of martyrs that were found
Full nine hundred and nynty rekened clean
And nine thereto slain with many a wound
Of whose blood / as it was well seen
All in to read stained was the grene
The flode so great of blood that come down low
That one from an other no man could know
They lay so oppressed under the horse fete
No man might have very knowlegyng
The blody streme did over flow and flete
Their deedly faces upon the ground lyggyng
But suddenly there fell a wonders thing
Each from other only by gods grace
was thorough the field known by the face
By the prayer of Amphibalus
Of the deed bodies with wounds grene
A great miracle the story tells thus
Their wounds hole that no carectes were seen
Joined together and souded eke so clean
A strange sight / a sight of great delight
The blody streme as milk ran all white
Thus by prayer of one ryghtfull man
Of their wounds first fearful and terryble
There was no carecte as we rehearse can
By apperance that outward was visible
For unto god nothing is impossyble
For they that were mangled and disfourmed
By grace and prayer suddenly were reformed
The people froward in their opinion
Seeing this miracle and were there present
By a contraryous exposition
Said aye the worst in their false judgment
And vengably echon of assent
Of false malice did their busy cure
To deny them their kyndly sepulture
But cast them to beastis on malice and disdain
To such as weren disposed to rauyne
without reverence like an old carayne
They again them so felly began malign
But Christ Jesus most gracious and benygne
To preserve his martyrs by miracle
Again paynyms have showed an obstacle
A wolf come down with sturdy violence
Terryble of look and furyous of chere
Again beastis wild to make resystence
Toward the seintes that they came no nere
An egle also with persyng eien clear
Houyng alofte / as all men beheld
Fro touch of foul / kept all day the field
whereof Pictis greatly began maruayle
They of wales had a manner of dread
Thought in them selves these tokes may not fail
It comes of god and of no man's deed
And of reason when they took head
First of the wolf and of the egle alofte
Stood astonyed and began to wonder often
It is appropred to the wolf of nature
As clerks say man's flesh to attame
Among all caryns where they may it recure
They most rejoice / and thereof have most game
But he that makes wild beastis tame
Dau^teth serpents / which on ground low crepe
Has made a wolf his martyrs for to keep
From all beastis disposed to rauyne
By his miracle and gracious worchyng
And by his power heavenly and divine
Of later date he yafe eke the keeping
Of blessed Edmonde / maid / martyr / and king
Unto a wolf the heed most virtuous
It to preserve from beastis ravenous
In this miracle / who can understand
To be noted is great conuenience
Of martyrs / which were with violent hand
Slain for the faith by humble patience
And thylke martyrs / which made no resistance
So were slain for Christ / as it is found
At Lychefelde / with many a blody wound
Following the ensample / these martyrs euerychon
For Christ death sufferyng and full great pain
Of their prince / that called was Albon
In his time steward of Brytayne
As I trust these noble princes twain
Edmonde and Albon / these joined two
Shall save this land in that we have to do
This kings banner of assure is the field
Therein of gold be crowns three
The same camp bears Albon in his shylde
Beat in the mids of gold a fresshe sawtre
Again our enmyes / when they together be
In one assembled / shall make our party strong
Magre all tho that would done us wrong
Of est England king and champyon
Blessed Edmonde shall his baner sprede
The prince of knights in Brutis Albion
And prothomartyr shall us help at need
A thousand martyrs that their blood shede
For Christis faith slain at Lychefelde
Shall us defend with spear sword and shield
These tokens seen / the paynems began to sease
Of their pursuit and furyous wodenesse
And by miracle they suddenly began to prease
To kiss the relyques / on knees began them dress
with many signs and tokens of meekness
And where before as they began to malign
They showed them self most goodly and benygne
Their old malice / and their froward disdeyne
Having the matters first in derysyon
From that conceyte they turned be again
And caught in their heart a new opinion
Them to worship with great devotion
Gafe thankyng to god / and were thereof full feign
That such a nombre in that land was slain
Of holy martyrs and holowed with their blood
which thing to put in token of victory
Perpetually they thought that it was good
Their nombre and names to set in memory
which fro this life fleing and transitory
Be now translated / where they may not mysse
Eternally with Christ to reign in bliss
when the turmentours had their tales told
Right as it fell in order of every thing
Of Verolamy the people young and old
Present there that time / herd all their talking
The more party left their weeping
For by report only of their langage
Of their sorrow / the constraynt began to swage
They began the lord to magnify and praise
And to rejoice the glory of their kynred
which by grace he list so high vprayse
By mertyrdome their precious blood to blede
For his sake dye without any dread
All with one voice at ones in sentence
This was their noise with devout reverence
Great is that god / greatest and glorious
Above all gods of most magnificence
That makes his servants so victorious
To get so great tryumphe by their meke patience
And by his mighty imperyall influence
This lord Jesus most gracious and benign
Showed in their death so many an uncouth sign
Their grene wounds terryble to behold
with sherpe swerdes severed far a sonder
For lack of blood / when they were sterke and cold
One part there / and an other part yonder
The red blood / this was a great wonder
Turned to milk white as openly was said
Their wounds large has souded new again
He may be called a leche verily
which has practiced so high a medycyne
Such mortal hurtes to cure them suddenly
whose royal bawme is heavenly and divine
Galiene could not imagyne
Nor ypocras during all their lives
Such consoudes nor such senatiues
The virtue showed and power glorious
Of Christ Jesus by great experience
And of his martyr blessed Amphibalus
That day declared by notable evidence
By whose prayer they being in presence
These miracles / who so list take heed
The same day accomplysshed were in deed
which thing remembered the judge was nygh wode
whose sodeyn ire no wight could appese
Great preace about in the place there stood
They of this matyr felt so great disease
But for he cast him finally to please
The paynyms in his malencoly
Distraught of rancour thus he began to cry
How long shall we endure or sustain
This great injury / sclaunder / and clamor
Let us search out what it should mean
This hateful noise and furyous romour
But I wot well ground of this error
That this clerk / which not yore agon
As ye well know was master to saint Albon
whose doctrine / if it were virtuous
Or come of god as ye report and say
He should not have demeaned him thus
So great a nombre suffer for to dye
Of innocents that did his lust obey
But it is like I do well apperceyue
This clerk was busye the people to disseyue
By some false craft of incantation
Or by some sotell and strange experience
Folk for to blind by some illusyon
Or by collusyon of false appearance
Like as it were soth in existence
with some comurison or some charm made of new
A thing that is naught to show as it were true
For by his compassed false deception
The worthyest borne of this cite
Have been perysshed / as made is mention
And brought to naught by great aduersite
whereupon I make a new decree
Pain of death yeuyng this sentence
To the bochers / who that yeueth credence
That all other thereby may be aferde
By plain ensample of their punysshon
where they be found go unto the sword
without mercy of any remyssyon
And after this he sent for all the town
High estates and low did do call
And when they come he said to them all
Let us proceed and werken finally
And thereunto set an ordinance
All of Asseus upon our ennemy
As we are bound take on him vengeance
That every man began him self auaunce
with such weapyn plainly as they found
Sword / knyfe / dagger / or what come first to hand
So great people out of wales come than
In their furyous rage and cruelte
That there was left uneaths any man
which that abode within the city
Each cried on other / go we hense let se
who that can first make him self strong
To be avenged upon our great wrong
Their goinge out was to the north party
A medeled people of folks nyse and rude
That no man could remember finally
The great nombre nor the multitude
All the city plainly to conclude
was almost void mine auctor tell can
Left alone of woman child and man
Among the bochers and turmentours strong
One was marked aforne in that passage
which that thought his fellows abode long
Ran forth fast to get him auantage
And like a wolf in his cruel rage
Stynt never till that he found
The place where Amphibalus was bound
Like a bocher persed his entrayles
This homycyde that ran before the route
Raffe his nauyll and took out his bowelles
And at a stake / which that stood without
Tied like ropes even round about
And with a scurge the martyr he began make
In sercle wise to go about the stake
By the grace of god in his sufferyng
Felly assailed with many a great turment
Showed no token of sorrow nor grudgyng
But always one stable in his intent
Till his bowels were rased out and rent
with turmentours in their cruel rage
He changed no chere of look nor visage
Two turmentours accorsed all their lives
Amphibalus set up for a sign
And cast at him sword dagger spear and knyues
And ever the more again him they did malign
The more they found hmn gracious and benign
A pronosticke maruaylous in nature
Save gods grace how he might endure
To wonder upon a merueylous miracle
was seen that day in peoples sight
Now this martyr up set for a spectacle
So long lived again natures right
His blood was spent and lost was all his might
And his humedite called radical
In synewes and joints wasted was at all
His soul his spirit his goostly remembrance
Stood in their strength of spiritual swetnes
His heavenly feruence / his charity in substance
Appalled not by no foren duresse
Fors bore his baner again his mortal feebleness
To preue this text / said ago full long
Now persed love / as any death is strong
O bodily force feeble to stand vpryght
After his flesshely disposition
In goostly strength like Hercules of might
For virtuous noblesse egall to Sampson
Proved this day in Brutis Albion
was Amphibalus / with whom who list aduerte
was nothing left / save only tongue and heart
In his heart as long as there was life
He ceased not gods word to preach
Grace was guide / and truth his preseruatife
Faith bare up all / charity was his leche
His tongue enspired the people for to teach
His body feeble / his members impotent
yet tongue and heart were of one assent
His heart strong stable as a dyamant
Faith had of stele forged his image
His hope in god was so perseuerant
Despair in him might have none auantage
For his gracious influent langage
And by miracles in him showed than
That day to Christ was turned many a man
His doctrine fire in his remembrance
Most souerently than began therein delight
Let their ydols go unto a myschaunce
which might them another help nor profit
God with his grace list them to visit
Of one assent / began them ready to make
After his counsel the faith of Christ to take
They were compuncte and maden their pray
with repentance and voice most lamentable
To grant them part of that he suffered there
Touching his passion grievous and importable
In that joy / which is perdurable
Touching the syghtes that they had seen
Thereof by grace to put them (...)
Like as their trust and their perfyte believe
was in Jesus of heart thought and deed
with hole affection that it shall them not grieve
For Christ's sake their blood in have to blede
They stood so hole having of death no dread
In their opinion our faith to magnyfye
That they despised all ydolatrye
Their prince and judge the while in presence stood
Like a man fall in to a franesye
Void of reason and as a tyrant wode
Commanded all his turmentours to hye
without exception of low or high party
To kill and sleye and no mercy take
That have their gods of dispite forsake
They preased in the martyr to encombre
Like gredy wolfes or tygrys of assent
They slough that day a thousand full in nombre
For to obey his fell commandment
Amphibalus being there present
which in spirit besyly began entende
To Christ Jesus their souls to commend
A cruel paynem stout indurate and bold
Spoke to the martyr of hateful cruelte
which of the city other new or old
In any wise has trespased again the
which have caused their great aduersite
These innocent people in so short a while
with thy traynes and sleyghtes to begyle
Our statutes and laws thou have foiled
By occasyon of thy parlous langage
And our city most cruelly spoiled
Of her people both old and young of age
Cause of their loss and mortal damage
And thou aforne them forwounded to the death
Stondest in point to yield up thy brethe
In such disioynt thou may not recure
Dissentrayled bounden to a stake
And our gods thou have above measure
Felly provoked vengeance on the to take
yet and thou would repent and forsake
Thy Christis sect and fro thy faith withdraw
And of hole heart turn to our law
worship our god / whom thou have offended
And be in will to do so no more
Of thyn hurtes thou myghtest be amended
And axe grace as I have told before
To health again they might well restore
Thy wounds grievous / which seem incurable
Make them full hole they be so merciable
Upon wretches benyngnly to rewe
Such as list fall in their grace
And will repent lowly and be true
Ask mercy of their old trespass
They may not fail within a little space
To be accept wounded halte and lame
By my counsel do thy self the same
which stand now as a spectacle
Afforne the people / which have them in disdeyne
Pray our gods to show some miracle
By their power that it may be seen
That thou maiste be restored new again
To that mercy / and afterward be assured
Of all thy wounds for to be recured
If thou thus do they will be gracious
To modifie their vengable violence
Let be thou paynym / quod Amphibalus
Feeble is their might and mortal in sentence
In thy langage thou do great offense
To yefe laud worship or praysyng
To falls ydoles that have no seeing
For they be void of grace and all virtue
Have another time nor immaginatyfe
There is no god but my lord Jesus
That deed bodies restores again to life
He is my health and my restoratife
All your gods of which now ye tell
Ben but fendes that suffer pain in hell
Them to praise and worship ye be blind
For deep in hell is their abydyng
ye do great wrong them to have in mind
which ever endure in complaynt and weeping
And were tyrants here in their living
And of false dread took their original
To be defied knowing they be mortal
In hell is now their habitation
Perpetually ordained to abide
Of your false gods the commemoration
Is holden therewith all their pomp and pride
with fire beset on every side
which never is queynte of infernal feruence
Nor the worm deed of their conscience
All they that serve them in their live
Shall of their pains be with them partable
Out of charity folk that list to strive
False aduoutrers / detractours detestable
And homycydes most abhomynble
That weren or ben here of their assent
Have and shall have part of their turment
Like their deserts they must have their mede
And thou paynym shalt have thy part in pain
For thy false error but thou repent in deed
Shalt eke with them I tell them certain
Ben embrased in a fyrye chain
with Satan stocked amyd the smokes blake
But if thou will thy mawmettry forsake
Forsake the ryghtes of false ydolatry
Thy sect thyn error of old vanyte
Despair the not / for great is the mercy
Of Christ Jesus / which will accept the
with all other that here present be
So that they will of faith and hole intent
Receive of baptism the holy sacrament
First of baptism the virtue to devise
Like as it is grounded in scripture
It wassheth away / who so list advertise
Of man's sin all fylthe and all odure
Causes a man all grace to recure
Opens heaven as sayen these clerks
Forsakes satan and all his mortal works
Tho that were children of perdition
Under the fend by sin and wretchedness
By grace of baptism as made is mention
Our faith received stands in sykernesse
Flete to the grace and does your business
As I to forne have to you devised
Forsake your gods / and beth in have baptized
water of baptism does sins puryfye
water of confort and consolation
Cleanses the fylthe of all ydolatrye
Original well of our sauation
Condite and river of our redemption
Called in scripture water regeneratyfe
which restores a man unto gostly life
It is the heed spring and the gostly streme
which conueyeth a man to paradise
River and port unto Jerusalem
Of all ryuers this river bears the price
As to folks that be prudent and wise
Such as wasshe them in this wholesome river
Auoydeth from them all infernal danger
And scoureth away all venym serpentyne
And spottis black called original
By grace causes / which that is divine
Renewyng men to be celestial
And for a conclusion in this matter fynall
To forsake your gods / which may do you no good
By my counsel be bathed in this flode
The streme thereof shall glad your city
And race away the rust of old outrages
And with a flow of all prosperity
Renew both your heart and your corages
And you preserve from infernal damages
ye stand free cheseth now of tweyne
Eternal life / or everlasting pain
After these notable exhortations
Grounded on faith and perfyte charity
The paynyms like tygrys or lions
In their hasty furyous cruelte
Fyllen upon the martyr bound to a tree
On each side assailed him at ones
with round kalyons and with sharp stones
A great miracle / god list that day to show
And this martyr like gods champyon
Beset all about with paynyms not a few
Stood aye vpryght / no party down
Stable in prayer and in orison
Erecte to god / not turnyng north ne southe
The word of god never out of his mouth
Save the word of god / and his grace was impossible
To abide that bronte / where he had force or might
In soul and spirit stondyng invisible
The eien up lift of his inward sight
Toward heaven Phoebus was never so bright
At mydsomer in his myd day spear
As he saw Jesus in the heaven appear
On the right side of his father dear
Fine of his tryumphe / and of his turmentry
Herd of angels with sugared notes clear
Celestial song / which in their melody
Began praise the lord / and there he began espy
His blessed Albon clad in purple wede
Token of Christ he list his blood to blede
To that martyr among martyrs all
Of trust assured whylom between them twain
Amphibalus for help began to call
O blessed Albon that sufferdist great pain
For Christis sake of mercy not disdeyne
To pray Jesus that list for us to dye
To send his angels my iournay to conueye
That cruel Satan trouble not my passage
Nor that his malice may claim in me no right
By the martyr rehearsed his langage
Come two angels from heaven with great light
This voice eke herd in all the peoples sight
There as he stood bounden to a stake
Upon the point to dye for gods sake
O Amphibalus after thy devise
with thy disciple glorious prince Albon
Thou shalt this day be in paradyse
Right in earth as ye were both one
with your triumph ye shall together gone
And with your palms ye shall be in glory
with a title of everlasting victory
Among martyrs receive this your mede
Like your deserte of eternal guerdon
A crown of gold / and a purple wede
Forged with saints in the heavenly mansion
Like to rubies most sovereign of renown
Albon and thou perpetually shall shine
In Verolamy the city to enlumyne
In this while two angels down descend
To the holy martyr for his gostly socoure
On his soul benygly to attend
whytter than snow or any lyly flower
His ghost conueyeng unto the heavenly tower
Paynyms this time bydyng in the field
Greatly abashed / when they this thing beheld
Herder of heart than flynt or any stone
After his spirit was borne up to heaven
Turmentours in their malice ay one
Fervent in fyry ire as any beuen
Like as jews fell upon saint Steven
So were they busy of hateful cursednesse
The deed body with stones to oppress
They had the martyr in so great disdain
After his death began make a new affray
That no memory should of him be said
Upon the ground where that he lay
Safe there was one / which that stole away
The deed corpse / and did his busy cure
Most secretly to make his sepulture
He was christen the man which did his pain
The deed corpse to close it in the ground
In secret wise till Jesus list ordeyne
And provide a time that he may be found
which for the faith suffered many a wound
And this done by grace for the nones
Maugre all tho that cast on him stones
Dukes earls and lords of the town
were over come almost with fasting
Among paynyms rose a discention
That would have had the body in keeping
which had auowed in their out going
To bring the martyr by oath and surete
Other quick or deed home to their cite
Among them self of vengeance began to strive
with swords draw fell at division
By their promise outher deed or a live
To bring the martyr with them to the town
which were unworthy to have possession
Of such a treasure till god list shape a time
Of gracious change to send a new pryme
Again their promise god made an obstacle
when they of new began the martyr to manace
The body was besyled by miracle
And eke buried in a secret place
There to abide till god list of his grace
As I said erste this treasure of renown
May be found to glad with all the town
Thus wha^ the paynims had showed their vttra^ce
Of the martyr the doctrine hole forsake
God upon them did openly vengance
All their lymmes and members began to shake
with a palsy their tongues were eke take
with which membre attorne in many wise
The faith of Christ they list falsely to despise
The hands touched of these homicydes
Impotent of power and of might
Their bodies unwieldy back eke and sides
Their legs faltred for to stand vpryght
Their mouths stood wrong / a gogle stood their sight
Each membre and joint out of order stood
And their judge also suddenly wax wode
Hondes to godwarde when they be vengable
Feet that ran of custom for damage
Cruel eien / which be not merciable
Mortal tongues that dampne men in their rage
By detraction / mouths for false langage
Like their deserts of old who list remember
God of his right began punysshe every membre
The eighe for lokyng receive his guerdon
The tongue for speaking takes his salarie
Blood wrongefully shede requires of reason
Hastly vengance though it a while tarry
Murder homycyde / which be to god contrary
Death of martyrs / slaughter of innocents
Cries vengeance to god in their tourmentes
Specially all the turmentours
That were assented for to slay Albon
Faded away as dew on summer flowers
And come to naught almost euerychone
The mind of the martyr abode always in one
And day by day the great laud and glory
Began more and more increase of victory
The sade vengeance no while was conseled
Nor the great noise of their aduersite
Take upon paynems would not be healed
Their trouble and rumor was not kept secret
For dread of which the chief of their city
Meddled with grace as the story says
were all at ones turned Christis faith
with right hole heart and full devout humbleness
From their old sect they began away declyne
Began praise the lord for his ryghtwysnesse
And some by grace heavenly and divine
By influence that did upon him shine
Left all the world treasure and substance
And to Rome went for to do penance
And by grace of our lord Christ Jesus
They renounced all their old error
And saw in their gods there was no virtue
Help at need conforte nor socour
But all at ones with diligent labor
Of false ydols forsook the sacryfyce
Become christen in most humble wise
Miracles showed and vertous doctrine
Of Amphibalus with vertous diligence
Grace annexed which did on them shine
Caused the city of all their old offense
To axe mercy and with hole diligence
Their false gods of new they have dispysed
And most mekely by grace were baptized
And so long continued / till at the last
By a rural person / disciple of pelagiane
His her eticall doctrine / long time begone and past
Newly renewed and fast took rote again
Perverted the people of this Brutis Britayne
And specially in this city of old Verolamy
Much increased this doctrine of infamy
wherewith sore troubled was all the hole clergy
Not strong enough / by lernyng and prudence
These old errors to refourme and rectify
But glad to send for help and defense
To the clergy of France / to be their assistence
where assembled a counsel of clergy in general
To provide remedy for this myschefe in special
Lastely concluded by the hole counsel
Sent unto Verolamy two ancient clerks
In lernyng and virtue / right famous and excel
The one called Germayne a myrour in good warkes
Confou^der of heretykes / and all fyry sparks
Of scismaticall doctrine / by gostly influence
He was consecrate bishop of Antisiodorence
And Lupus the bishop of Trecassinensis
In this holy iournay / with him was associate
And came to this city of Verolaminensis
where the people perverted / were grievously insensate
And from the true faith / crokedly abrogate
By thereticall doctrine of the erroneus person
Declared to the people with deuylysshe illusion
Good people before this time / of fervent devotion
For recours of pylgryms / had builded an oratory
Over the tomb and (...) of holy saint Albon
wheder these bishops of blessed memory
Came and made prayer to the martyr instantly
That he for them in their battle and conflycte
would be mean to god / the heretyke to conuicte
Their prayer to god / by the martyr preferred
As perueth the sequel / was right acceptable
For than the heretics / day ne time detec^ed
was clearly conuicte of their errors detestable
And reduced to grace / by treuthe infallable
By Lupe and Germane in plain disputation
Renounsyng their errors / made abiuration
Than for that grace / given them in especial
Of god by mean of the martyrs intercessyon
To his to^be they returned / with heart and mind effectual
Redoublyng their prayer / with humble devotion
For the great tryumphe / and utter subjection
That thenmyes of god / had sustained that day
Exhortyng the people / to laud god and pray
And mekely on their knees / with all dew reverence
Uncovered the tomb / where the corpse lay
There found the relics in state and essence
All though he had layne there many a long day
And of the same relics they took no part away
But of therth all blody saint Germane took a portion
To bear about with him of fervent devotion
And for the same in full recompense
A cophyn enclosed with relyques many one
Of all thapostels / and (...) with reverence
which he gathered in places where he had gone
There he them offered to blessed saint Albon
For a perpetual memory of that his act and deed
And to all pylgryms to have reward and mede
Than departed Germayne and his fellow Lupus
In to their own countres there to remain
within four years after / again it happened thus
Newly to spring / theresyes of pelagyans
Than the clergy sent of new for saint Germayne
who hastily granted to come and discuss
All doutes associate / with holy Seuerus
who breuely confounded and brought to utterance
All theretykesto their shame and confusyon
That done they returned again into France
The people delivered from deuyllysshe illusion
Albert shortly after / their former abusyon
Returned their minds and brought in appostacy
Their god forgettyng to laud and magnify
And all that was done by the grievous occasyon
Of the furyous saxons / and their pagan ryte
For after that they had in this land made invasion
Churhes and clergy they distroyed quite
To adnull Christis law was all their delight
And compel the christen to their false ydolatry
In such miserable life was all their felicite
Thus by them all this region in manner (...)
From (...) faith / and holy saint Alb^^
The (...) and tomb decayed and (...)
Token or knowledge there was left none
Devotion and prayer forgotten and gone
Till god of his goodness and merciful pity
would reuele his saints / to the laud of his deite
Thus during this time three hundred year and mo
The hertes ot the people / all derke and obumbrate
From the faith of Christ was clearly lost and go
worshyppyng ydols of power aduychilate
Reason of knowledge by will was obnubilate
By long continuance accustomed and used
That good and true doctrine / they utterly refused
Thylke holy saint Albon / to the godhed directed
His devout prayer / his country to reconcile
To Christis own faith / all heresies rejected
with errors and scismes / from them put in exile
The disceytes of the devil / has the long begyle
To abate and suppress / to the christen releue
And to all heretics shame and repreue
His prayer well herd / god has provide
A captain / a ruler / a prince of great pleasance
Over this contre / to reign rule and gye
Descended of blood from royal aliance
That by gods help shortly made purueyance
These fautes to redress / by grace as he may
This noble devout prince called king Offs
It (...)t this king tha^ being at Bygging
Besy^^ ^ynstowe his own manner place
Calling to memory all his former living
How by the blody swerd his peace he had purchase
Co^puncte by contrition calling for grace
Besought god on his knees / with fervent devotion
Some knowledge to have of his sins remyssyon
Than suddenly in the chapel came a marvelous light
Inflamed the king with a sweet fraragrau^t odor
The king first astonyed / to se it so bright
Than after coforted gave laud praise and honor
To that only god / ground of all socour
And set fast in him / his trust and confidence
Daily to serve him / with all dew reverence
This king then lyinge in the city of Bath
Half slepyng in a slombre appeared an angel
Showing that of god such favor he has
And also commandment as he did than tell
All scismes and heresies / from the contre texpell
He should perceive with all diligence anon
To translate the relics of holy saint albon
The king or this time of the pope had purchased
That Lychefelde should be / tharchebysshops see
whereby Canterbury was greatly defased
But for that time there was no remedy
All which I on^ye and returns to our story
How and by whom was done this translation
Of archebysshop and bishops with fervent devotion
After that the angel at Bathe had thus appeared
Of this prothomartyr Albo^ / made the king relacion
He called Humbertus / whom he had than arered
Archebysshop of Lychefeld / and made declaration
Of thangelles commandment / for the translation
Of this holy martyr / than the bishop anon right
Obeyed and prepared thereto w all his might
Accompanied with suffraganes / two he had than
Their names to recount / I let over pass
The king and they to Verolamy / with many noble men
Accompaned / came reverently to the same place
where as a fyrye pyllour bryghtly shynynge was
Over the tomb and place / where as lay saint Albon
By which token / they found the cophyn anon
They took up the bones with all humble devotion
And bate them to the church with ympnes and song
The king and his nobles followed the processyon
where many fair miracle was done than among
The relyques enclosed in a shryne great and long
Of silver and gold set with great riches
Thus with all solempnite / ends this busynes
Not without miracles as the story does us teach
They that were blind / recured have their syghte
The domme also was restored to their speech
Folks lame and podagryd / went than vpryght
Lepres made cleue / by prayer of this knight
And palatyke folk / as the story does remember
And all other diseased / were hole in every membre
Be glad and merry / thy title rich and good
Land of brytane called brutes Albion
which art inbaumed / with the purple blood
Of blessed saint Albon / prince of that region
And specially O noble and ryall town
Of verelamy / rejoice and be iocounde
So rich a treasure / is in thy bounds found.
Richer treasure more worthy to be commended
Much better then in Troy / was ever Palladion
For on thy soil / of new is discendyd
A celestial dew / of grace and all fosion
And specially by / angelical revelation
which on thy land / of new does rebounde
That blessed Albon / is in thy bounds found.
Hector whylom / was Troyans Champion
And Haniball protector of Cartago
Marchus Maluius / saved Rome town
The capitolie / conserved from damage
And in britayne now in more lattre age
Of holy Albon when the corpse was found
Made in that region all things to habounde.
King Offa as I said / having this vision
which of saint Albon / was patron and founder
By miracles showed / for his good devotion
The place where was hyd / this rich treasure
He with cost and diligent labor
Let call to gedre / of diverse regions
Most cunninge masters of wryghtes and masons.
To build the church / of blessed saint Albon
Endowed the same / with lands and possession
So that in all Britayne / like to that is none
Replenished with people / of saint benettes profession
Almost.viii.C. year continued in succession
Taking first auctorite / as the history tell can
Granted by bulls of pope Adriane.
After went him self / this noble worthy king
Of great devotion to Rome the ryall city
Spared no cost / till he in every thing
Had of his purpose grant and authority
Privileges / fredomes / and liberties
By the pope then / confirmed to that place
For love of saint Albon with many especial grace.
By authority / as ye have hard devised
He had his asking / by power spiritual
And for his part / to be more auctorised
He has annexed his power in especyall
with all liberties and fraunchies full ryall
Perpetually bound yt in bread and in lenght
In honor of saint Albo^ / to stand in his strenght
O Verolamy as I have told beforne
O Famous old city / among all nations
which in thy bounds / had such a prince borne
Notable in knyghthode / with all conditions
Of high prowes / by manyfold reasons
wordy by virtue and by ryall lain
To be in degree / above all the worthies nyen.
He that whylom was busy to compyle
This noble history / trewly of intent
In latin tongue to direct his style
Right as he saw / so was he diligent
It to convey / because he was present
yet list he not I suppose of mekenes
Tell what he was nor his name express
To him self / he gave none other name
After the story / as I rehearse can
Except he wrote of dread / and of honest shame
He would be called as he wrote than
Of all wretches the symplest man
Of other name as by his writing
To us he left no manner knowlegyng
Save he of trust and good confydence
which that abode in his opinion
There should come in great reverence
Time coming folk of religion
Specially to Verolamy town
which that should do their busy pain
The faith of Christ / for to preach in Britayne
Than shall the truth be openly knawe
when the error is loused and unbound
Of paynyms and Christis word be saw
Through all the land / false ydols to confound
Than to their hearts / gladness shall rebounde
That uses our faith / when Jesus list by grace
Of his infinite mercy / a time to purchase
This same man / of full true intent
which busy was / this story to endue
Unto the sea of Rome / with the book he went
By great advise his purpose to acquit
And finally like as he does plainly write
All false gods and ydols to forsake
Baptism to receive and Christis faith to take
And as I have told / this book with him he brought
To be seen over with meke and low subjection
To all that court / and humbly he besought
Our lord Christ Jesus with devout intention
After their dew and full examynation
Called to record this story made of new
Like as he wrote that every word was true
This book accomplysshed / notable and famous
Of him that was in Brutis Albion
Called prothomartyr most virtuous
That for Christ suffered passion
That year accounted of his translation
Fro Christis birth and his natiuite
Fully seven hundredth nynty year and three.
Now perfyte reders / that diverse stories has seen
Mark well the times / of this here expressed
when that saint Albon by the paynyms kene
For Christis faith / from this life was suppressed
The coming of saint Germayn for errors to be
After all these / the time of his invention
Done by king Offa / with his holy translation
CC.lxxxx.iii. years of our lord Christ Jesus
The reign of Dioclesyon the.xix. year
Christis holy faith to reuyue and renew
Suffered saint Albon / the story does appear
Maximiane and Asclipiodot / both his iuges were
It was in the second year / of the pope Gaius
That holy saint Albon was martyred thus
Than one hundredth and one year after his passion
Began first theresies of false pelagyane
which was.CCCC.iiii. years / by just computation
After that Christ / had take our nature humayne
The.xiiii. year of the Brittisshe king Graciane
In the.iii. year of the first Anastacious
And the.xvi. year of the emperor Theodosius
Four hundred and forty / of our lord.ix. years mo
And in the first year of Vortigern the king
And the fyfte year of the first pope Leo
Theodose the second emperor than being
In his.xxi. year after just reckoning
Saint Germayn come first / and lupus also
To distroye theresies / that were begone tho
C.xliii. years by just computation
After his passion / thus come saint Germayn
And forty and two year without variation
After the first time of the falce pelagian
yet within five years saint Germayn come again
As is showed before / with holy Seuerus
All former heresies by grace to discus
CCC.xliii. years after saint Germayne
which was seven hundredth / lxxx. and.xiii. year
Of our lord Jesus / as stories does determyne
That thangell at Bath / to king Offa did appear
To translate saint Albon / with all heavenly chere
The first Adrian pope / the.vi. Constantine the emperor
wha^ this translation was done with all honor
Perceive now good reders / and give true judgment
Between the monks of Colen / and of blessed Albon
The Coloners writes after their intent
To cause the pylgryms to wtdrawe their devotion
From Verolamy / and to follow their affection
Saying that they have the very body
To their shame and rebuke / detendyng such folly
And to prove their intent / plainly they say
That these heresies of false pelagiane
Began in the reign of noble kynke Offa
And also in the time of pope Adrian
Affyrmyng that than should come in Germayne
And with him Lupus / a clerk of great substance
And all theresyes were brought than to vttrance
And so by Germayn / were brought unto Rauenus
The body of saint Albon / and there the emperor
Valentiniane / he was nobly received than
And also the body / with all godly honor
where Germayn sore vexed with a mortal dolor
Departed this life and vale of all misery
To theternall life / in the celestial glory
After whose death themperours mother
Placida by name / as Coloners does say
To Rome brought this body / she with many other
with all dew reverence / there abode many a day
Till Otto the emperor / with his mother Theophana
Brought it to Colen / to tharchebysshop Brunon
In to the monastery of holy Panthaleon
Also at the time of this translation in deed
Adrian was pope / and that they confess
And when Valentiniane / to thempyre did proceed
Liberious was pope / in his.xii. year doutlesse
As diverse Historiographers / plainly do express
So that of the sees spiritual nor temporal
Agrees with their accomptes / after their memorial
They say also the body is yet incorrupt
From the thyes upward / they have in possession
which saiynge me seems of truth be interrupte
Onles they will grant any vnsemyng division
Of a corporal body to be cut in perticion
yet I can not know what part they should have
For king Offa found nothing / but the bones in his grave
They say also that king Offa and saint Germayne
was both at one time / at this translation
when therisies was destroyde of false pelagian
In whose times is a great alteration
who lust account by just compotation
Shall find.CCC. years.xliiii. also
That king Offa came after saint Germayn was go
They say also that the emperor Valentiniane
Should mete. s. Germain / wha^ he came to Rauene
which can not be true / but all spoken in vain
For CCC.lxvi. was the years of our lord than
when Valentiniane first began to reign
That was.lxxx.iii. years before that Germayne
Came to distroye theresies of pelagiane.
Therefore good brethren of holy saint Benet
Monks of Colen leave this your bablyng
ye be so far hense / in deed ye can not let
Any devout persons / for to do their offryng
I will not deny / but your untrue surmysyng
May bring some people / pucyll and innocent
For lack of true knowledge / in a wrong judgment
But they that be learned can read as well as ye
Confer histories / and also account the years
Can well perceive how craftily ye do fly
From truth / thistories so plainly apperes
And are not they accursed yt false witness bears
And specially in writing / to the derogation
Of their brethren in god of a another nation
Remember ye ware in England but late
with the.vii. Henry that mighty ryall king
where covertly ye sought means with many a noble
To stay and aid you in this untrue lesing estate
But ye durst not abide the end of the rekenyng
For fear of afterclappes that might have ensued
ye where afraid to drink of such as ye brewed
wherefore reduce your self / false writing revoke
Knowledge your offense / of will more than deed
For if ye continue / ye shall have but a mock
Men knows how ye can in any wise proceed
But if that other ye love god or dread
Follow the truth / so shall ye do best
And in little medlynge / ye shall find much rest.
