The report of a bloody and terrible Massacre in the City of Mosco, with the
fearful and tragical end of Demetrius the last Duke, before him reigning at
this present.
After that Peter Vendronitz Basmaneuf, one of the principallest, and most
valiant Boyars, had been magnificently brought into the City, and most
honorably received, by Boritz Fendronitz Godena, who was then Prince of the
country: and all this, because of his magnanimious defense, and keeping of the
Castle of Novomerskigrod, against the forces of Demetri Ioanavitz, and that for
so valiant an act, he had been rewarded by his said Prince, with great and
rich presents, the which fell out, in the month of February, 1605. It
happened, that about the 13. of April, the said Boritz Fendronitz Godena
suddenly died, not without suspicion, of having been poisoned: and he being
interred the day after, his wife a desolate widdowe, and his son Fender
Borissovitz, were incontinently placed in the Imperial throne, and received
for Prince, and Princess, by every one of the City, and of the Country, who
did them homage, and swear unto them, fidelity, subjection, and obedience.
Wherefore, they dispatched incontinently, the said Peter Fendronitz Basmaneuf
toward the Camp, as he that was General of all the men of war, to swear
them, according to the custom which was performed by the greatest part of
them. But by reason that the Prince Demetri Ioanovitz, drew every day, nearer,
and nearer, and that his force apparently augmented, by reason of the great
multitude of good fighting men, and other hired soldiers, which were sent him
out of Poland, so that those of the champion country, presently joined with
them, principally because by permission divine, all the world was of opinion
and fully persuaded, that he was the man, which should be true heir, and
successor to the Crown: to which in like manner, many of the Boyars, willingly
gave an ear, and those also of Boritz Fendronitz Godenaes party, who knew not
well their own power, and were ignorant how to prevail with their natural
authority: as also, there was a great part of the men of war, which desired
rather to worship the Sun rising, as the said Basmaneuf in like manner did,
to insinuate betimes into the favor of their new Prince, so that in
conclusion, all the Camp revolted, adhering with the greatest part of the
Almaines, to that Prince Demetrius: who drew nearer every day, to the chief
City of the country, and in his way all the world fell down before him, and
thus the 20. of June, he made his entry into the City of Moscovie. The 28. of
the said month, there arived also, the old Princess, who was supposed to be
the Mother, or rather indeed the wife, of the Tyrant Joan Vasiliovitz, who
during her widdow-head, had been shut up, in a little obscure cloister, like a
poor prisoner, which was distant an hundred leagues from the said City. And
the said Prince, (by supposition h^^^onne) presented him self before her,
accompanying her by the chariots side, with his head always uncovered, and on
foot, never mounting so much as on horse back, whilst they entered into the
Castle: where the said pretended mother, betook her self to an other of the
principal Monasteries, wherein there was none, but of the greatest Ladies in
the country, and where she as yet remains, being very well entreated, as a
Princess, or Empress; and as the wife, and dowager, of an Emperor of that
country. This Demetrius stayed not long, but caused himself to be crowned,
the 21. of the said month, notwithstanding, that the Emperors of Russia were
always wont, to put over this inauguration, until the fifth of September,
which is the day, when they begin to count the new year. But it seems
necessity made him hasten the celebration of this solemnity, for very urgent
reasons. He had about his person, a guard of certain Almayne Halberdiers,
which he brought with him out of Poland: but by reason that this was not the
manner and custom of other Princes, upon their residence within the City,
they were all presently discharged, as in like manner all soldiers of any
strange nation, were licensed, and cashierd: the which was put in execution so
confusedly, and suddenly, as diverse were very malcontent therewith, by
reason they gave them not that which was promised, whereby, they found
themselves but evilly rewarded, and slenderly recompensed for their good
services: and namely, there was a certain great Lord, and Prince of Russia
the fair, who was called Adam Visnevetskie, that amongst other of his
complaints, intimated, how he had lent the said Demetrius, while he remained in
Poland, about the sum of 80000 Roubles (a kind of coin.) Wherefore it is, I
cannot well tell, but the said Lord was dislodged, without giving him, either
payment, or contentment: and now there runs a rumor abroad, that he forageth
upon the frontires of that country, with diverse others of the same faction,
like male-contented people, doing there al damage, and waste, that they can
devise. At the very beginning of this Demetrius his Empire, there were many,
which as well in public, as private, affirmed, that he was in no sort, true
successor, heir, or Prince of the country, amongst whom, was also a great
Lord, and a Monk. But the said Monk was quickly dispatched, and the Lord,
whose name was Vasilius Ioanovitz Cinskie (who is now Prince of the country)
was brought into the open market place, before the seat of Justice, and
stripped, ready to have his head cut off with an hatchet, who notwithstanding
at the same instant, and by the intercession of the Chancellor Ossinassi
Ioanovitz, obtained mercy, and preservation of his life, and was very
honorably entertained, and from that time forward, one could hear no speech
of any thing else, but daily treasons, and all kind of conspiracies: whereof
have ensued so many tortures, flagellations, disgraces, releasements,
confiscations, and censure of goods, with new confirmations of estates, as it
was most wonderful to hear: but this cursed race, and perverse generation of
vipers, never ceased, until they had executed their tyranicall designs,
during the government of a strange Prince. For his own person, he maintained
his greatness very well: he was a man of mean stature, brown of hew, prompt
to choler, but quickly appeased, he has broken many a staff, and given
sentence of death, upon the Marshalles, and other officers, when they did but a
little swarve from their duty, he liked well to be on horse back, and loved
to go often on hunting, being a man of great expedition, and that would quickly
order whatsoever came before him, and commanded with excellent forecast, even
in the least matters: he was a great enterpriser, of wonderful courage, and
inwardly conceived, that all the country of Moscovia, was not sufficient for
him, to purchase any great renown, so that he aspired after other countries
also, and monarchies: at the beginning, he was very affable, giving free
access, even to the meanest: but after he grew to know, and understand the
Russians false prankes, he provided himself, of a guard of Livonians, and
afterward also, of Alwaynes, and other strangers, to wit, under three
Captains, a French, an English, and a Scot. Under the French Captain, who was
called Jacques Margarett, he had an hundred Archers, which carried Partisanes,
and were richly cladde in velvet, and cloth of gold. Under the English man,
whose name was Matthew Knowtson, he had an hundred Halbardiers: as also under
the Scot, called Albert Fancy, in like manner an hundred others, who were
apparelled in tawnie cloth, with large gardes of velvet, and on festival
days, in red crymson velvet. The Archers had for the most part, 70. Roubles a
year, and besides this, the revenewe of certain lands, whereon they might
live. The Halbardiers, over and above their revenew of land assigned them, had
40. Roubles a year, and two suits of apparel; and besides these, he yet
farther determined, to have also entertained an hundred Musketeers, yet this
determination was laid a part. Besides the delight which he took in hunting,
he also took great delight, to cast pieces of Artillery, and not only to see
them in hand, but also to prove them himself: for which end, he caused
Ravylines, and Rampires to be erected, to imitate an assault, in which
traynings, and exercises, he would always be in the thickest amongst others,
so that sometimes he was but hardly entreated, and violently repulsed. Whilst
this calm and peace endured, he sent the Lord Ossivassi Ivanovitz Vlussi, his
Ambassador into Poland, to demand the Vayvod of Landimier his daughter in
marriage, and to bring the said his spouse into the country. The Ambassador
arived at Cracovia, and after having procured, and obtained his request, the
avaunt nuptialles, or espousalles, were very royally celebrated, and the said
Lady, was placed at the upper end of the King of Poloniaes table, above the
King, and the Popes Nuntio: the like honor being done to the Ambassador, as
to one, holding the place of the Emperor of Russia. The young Prince of
Polonia, together with the Kings sister, departed presently after, and so the
said Ambassador was conveyed with a most magnificent train, even to the
borders, and arived here with the spouses Father, in the City of Mosco, the
26. of April, where the day following, he presently made his report, to Prince
Demetrius, and the said Vayvod had also his access, in saluting all the
Courtiers, and very friendly embracing one another, who was lodged within the
Castle, in Boritz Fendronitz lodging. The second of May, the new Empress, made
her glorious entry into the Castle, being drawn in a Chariot all gilded,
which was purposely made for her: and the same Lady espousall, was accompanied
with a great number of Lords, and gentlemen, that is to say, first, with my
Lord her father, the Vayvod of Landimier; and his son, my Lord, the King of
Poloniaes Ambassador and the Lord Swisnevitz, brother to the other Vayvod:
also the two brothers, Steri^fskie, and many others, which were of the suit of
the said Princess: and then of the Princes train, there was the Lord Peter
Basmanoff, with all the great Boyars of the country, they being all most
sumptuously clad, after the manner of that region: there was also many other
Coaches, and Carosses of Ladies, and Gentlemen. The Princess showed her self
very benign and gracious, in saluting not only, all the Ladies of the Court,
but also, in discoursing very affably, with diverse citizens wives: and thus
they advanced toward the Castle, where there was an high scaffold set up hard
by the gate, upon the which, a number of trumpets stood, and kettle drums,
making a wonderful sound, with the loud report of their instruments. From
thence the said Lady Princess, was conducted to the Cloister, where the
Ladies and Damoselles were resident, being the widows, and daughters of the
great Lords, and Boyars of the country: and there was also the old Empress,
where she was to stay, and spend the time, till the day of nuptial
celebration. The Russians informed me, that these Ladies were there taught, and
instructed in the articles of the faith, and Russian ceremonies, and that the
same Lady Princess, was constrained to do the like, and that after this, she
must be baptized after the Russian manner: but I rather suppose, seeing
Demetrius frequented thither so daily, and was there so privately, that he
taught her an other Catechism: and so as the entry into this Monastery, was
made on a Friday, so was her coming forth, incontinently on the Wednesday
following. For she was conducted again into the Castle, into lodgings very
richly hung, and the gallerie (through which she was to pass) was all covered
with red crimson cloth, and the hangings of the said chambers, were for the
most part, of cloth of gold. The day following, at Evensong, the espousalles
were solemnized by the Patriarch in our Ladies Church, where she was also
crowned: the Temple round about, was hung with red cloth, with embroyderie of
gold and silk, and the pavement was covered with the like. The Crown,
Scepter, Globe, and Sword, were all carried before the Emperor of Russia, and
the Crown, which was to be put on the Empresses head, was carried upon a
cushen of red velvet: these solemnities continuing about the space of two
hours, and thus they both went out of the Church together, leading one another
by the hand, with crowns on their heads: on the right hand, the Emperor was
led by the Lord Knees, or Duke Fender Ivanovitz Aliholsta: and the Empress on
the left, by the Duchess, wife to the said Lord. The trumpets, kettle drums,
and all other musical instruments, made a great noise, and all the Court, was
in festivitie, and joy. But in the ending, there was no great preparation, for
it seems, that the greatest triumphing, was betwixt the new married couple. I
forgot to relate, how the King of Poloniaes Ambassador brought with him, very
goodly presents, the which he presented, the day after his arivall: which were
vessels of silver, guilt, with a great number of cups, and goblets, and two
goodly horses, with a fair dog: having delivered his letters of credence to
the Emperors own hands, who receiving the letter, and perceiving, that upon
the title of direction, there was mentioned the title of Emperor, and Monarch
of Russia, he presently rejected the said letter, and delivered it himself to
the same Ambassador: whereupon the Ambassador replying, answered, that his
grandfathers, and predecessors, never pretended, nor usurped any such title,
and that therefore, none was enjoined, to entitle him otherwise, then by the
name of great Duke: but if he did affect any higher style then his progenitors,
that then he should endeavor to conquer the Empires of great Tartaria, or
attempt to subdue under himself, the scepter of the Turkish Emperor, and then
he would be acknowledged of all the world, for an Emperor, and Monarch. At
which so sharp, and stinging an answer, the Vayvod, Father to the spouse, was
mightily astonished, and Prince Demetrius so enraged, that he would have
cast his scepter at the Ambassadors head. When this choler was over, some body
demanded of the Ambassador, whether the scepter was thrown at his head or
no? if it had been (said he) I would have taken it up, and gone away with the
scepter, returning presently into my country: notwithstanding, all this
spleen passed over eassely, and they retired themselves peaceably, and very
good friends, but the letter was never read. Money also was thrown abroad, when
the coronation was solemnized, and Friday, which was the 9. of May, that is to
say, the day after the coronation, and consummation of the marriage, the
presents of the Ambassadors, and others of the Court, should have been
delivered, but it seems, that this good Demetrius, who it may be (as having
been heretofore a Monk) was too devout upon his Breviarie, he said too long a
Mass with his new mistress, in whose company, he was so ravished, that he
forgot to rise soon enough in the morning, and so showing himself in public
very late, the same evening also there was no great banqueting at the Court.
But on Satterday, which was a very solemn festival day, so as the Russians
kept it with greater reverence, then their Easter: it vexed the Russians
wonderfully, to see this day profaned by their Princes nuptialles, but
notwithstanding this, the Emperor, with the Empress, having their crowns
upon their heads, were set in a great Hall, where first the Patriarch, and then
the Boyars, and in the end, Merchants strangers, and other men of quality,
entered in, kissing the new Empresses hand, and every one offering of their
presents: amongst whom, was also your brother, and I, but I would to God we
had kept our money in our purses, although we did it in hope, to have obtained
some privileges; this we did out of a good intention, according as we had
before received many fair promises from my Lord Vayvod: but the disastrous end
of all this festivitie, did in like manner frustrate us of our designs.
Wherefore presently the tables were in readiness, and we were invited, and set
in presence of our Emperor, at a most sumptuous dinner, and banquet, but after
the manner of that country, and we strangers were placed at the table, with
our faces toward the Emperor, but the Russians were not permitted to do so,
but they must sit with their backs upon him: this feast might well deserve a
pretty treatise apart, but we must reserve something till we return, to
report unto you, by word of mouth, the brave drafts, that there they carowsed,
and drank off. After this feast, they sent home unto us meat in gilded plate,
but they forgot not quickly to redemaund their plate dishes again, otherwise
it might have been supposed, that we received them in recompense of our former
presents. There was very excellent music which was of Poland, among the
followers of the said Lady, and this was the best pastime we had, but it was a
very short joy and jubilee.

The Sunday following, there was yet far greater feasting, and the king of
Poloniaes Ambassador, made it known before, that he would not sit down at
the table, except they did him the same honor, which was afforded the
Ambassador of Russia, in the royal Court of Cracovia, where he was set down
at the Kings table, and so he requested, he might likewise have his place, at
the Imperial table, to which the Emperor would not in the beginning consent,
but so he let him understand, that he should have his place, above all the
Boyares, and great Lords of the country: the which the said Polonian
Ambassador flatly refused, so that at last, the Emperor permitted him to sit
at his table, and so he came thither with his presents, which were far
ritcher, then any of the former, and the banquet continued till it was late in
the evening. In the retiring of themselves, a Polonian struck a Russian such a
blow, that being fore wounded, he cried aloud, murder. But the vproare was
presently pacified, and the two days following, there was nothing but sounding
of trumpets, and kettle drums, after the Imperial manner. It was supposed
also, that the guard of the Boyares, should have shot off their Harquebuzes,
and that the Artillery, and Chambers laden with balls of artificial fire,
should have been discharged, in sign of joy, the Cannon was now drawn out of
the City, and a Fortress of wood after the modern fashion was built for an
assault: but all this (as an evil presagement) was given over. On Wednesday, a
day, whereon the Russians eat no flesh, all was very silent, and still, as
also the Thursday following, and by reason the Emperor had alittle inckling of
what was a brewing amongst the Russians, having always his ear, and eye
hereupon, he advised all the Poloniaus to stand upon their guard, commanding
all those of his own guard, that they should repair to the Castle, with their
Harquebuzes charged, bullet in mouth, and match light, and in truth, there was
to the number of 15000. Muscovites, which were now in readiness, to effect their
enterprise: but by reason that the Polonians kept good watch, and shot off many
Harquebuzadoes in hearing, making a great rutte with their kettle drums, the
Russians durst attempt nothing: that present night, which might have served the
other well, for an admonition, and foresight: as also they might clearly
perceive, that the joy of this marriage suddenly ceased, and that all the time
passed away, in an uncouth and dead silence, and the Friday after, there was
none that would sell them any powder, or other warlike munition.

In the mean while, the young Empress passed the time merrily amongst her
damoselles, in measures, daunces, and masking, intending to have come the
Sunday following, in a gallant mummerie to find out the Emperor, when he
should be at a banquet, with the great Lords, and to present them yet further,
with some new recreations, but all this was interrupted: for the Russians now
plotted, to put in execution, a design, which long time before they had
resolved upon: which was, the same Satterday, being the 17. of May, according
to the old style, about seven by our clockes in the morning. For this
conspiracy to kill the Emperor, was proiected before the Vayvods coming into
the country with his daughter, they bethinking themselves long before, to
entrap all the Polonians, which should then be there present, with their arms,
and also because by the same mean, they would recover at that instant, all the
treasure which had bin sent out of the country, to the said Vayvod, and his
daughter, and thus this tragedy began. On the same day, most terribly, the
Boyars, with their servants being mounted on horse back, with harness, and
coats of male on their backs, having lances in their hands, iavelines, and
darts, bows, and arrows, cymitars, and all other kind of arms, the common
people running up and down, with their steel mases, stocks, and cymitars in
their hands, the number of them being so great, as it seemed, that the
Myrmidons swarmed as thick as hail stones, all the world ran hastily
toward the Castle, crying no other thing, along the streets as they went,
but, to the murder, to the fire, kill, kill, making one another believe, that
the Polonians massacred the Boyars within the Castle, though very few of them
were lodged within the same: but this was done to no other end, but the more to
flesh the rakehell vulgar, against the poor Polonians.

This vproare was so sudden, that diverse Russians, apparelled after the
Polonian fashion, were slain amiddest the press, and incontinently, they
belayed the Innes, and lodgings of all the Polonian Gentlemen, so as no body
could either come forth, or assist one another, with their arms. They ran in
thousands toward the Castle, where no resistance was made against them, by
the Princes Archers, who were all Russians, and held correspondencie with the
rest. And evil fortune went so hard on this miserable Princes side, that where
as he was wont to have every day, all 100 Halberdiers, in a corpse de guard,
there was not now 30. no, not so much as one Captain to be seen, and yet if
they had been there all together, and performed their best, in defending of
themselves, it had been nothing against so great a multitude of people, but
the slaughter, and butchery had been so much the greater, besides the evident
danger, whereto was Dutch Merchants, and of all other strange nations should
have run into. The Russians therefore, cried out to them of the guard, (so
few of them as there were) that they should lay aside their arms, to come and
join with them, and take their part, and then they should have no hurt at all,
the which they presently did, and willingly yielded themselves, with their
arms laid aside, The Russians then ran up toward the great Hall, with
great press, the above named Peter Basmaneuf going before them, who was a
very faithful friend of the Emperors, and who, heretofore had a servant, who
many times spoke very evillie of the Emperor, and defamed him amongst the
common people; the same was he, who suddenly stroke his old master, in such a
sort, that he died.

The great troop then ran with like haste, through the Chambers, and even to
the Emperors own lodging, who hearing this tumult, leapt out of his bed,
putting on his night gown, and demanding what the matter was: whereupon one
of his household Russes answered, that he knew nothing, and that it might be
they cried out for some fire. No, villainous traitor as thou art, (said the
Emperor) it is not for fire they thus cry out, but there must needs be some
other matter in it, for all the belles, as well of the City, as of the Castle
do ring alarm. Ah (said he further) do you think you have to do with an
other Boritz and so he made himself ready, tucking up his shirt sleeves very
high, and calling for his two edged Curtleaxe, which they were wont to carry
before him, to lay about him, within on all sides, but he who had it in
keeping, could not find it: and when he saw the enemies troop to press
forward, to fly upon him, he requested his Halberdiers which were before the
gate, that they would not thus yield him into the Boyars hands, shutting the
door himself, and so retiring within some other more inward Chambers, even to
the stuff where he was wont to bathe himself, whither he was presently
pursued by his enemies, so that he leaped down out of a window, falling a
mavelous height, upon the pavement; for his lodging was in the top of the
Castle, so as it was a great wonder, that he broke not his arms, and legs, or
that he was not crushed all in pieces. One of his Halberdiers, called
Farstenberg, came presently down the stairs, and found him yet alive, but
allhis breast was bruised, so as he did nothing but vomit blood, and his head
was also all to be crushed, and bloody.

The said Halberdier, with others help, carried him up again into his
Chamber, where he was alittle refreshed with waters and other comfortative
drugges, while he came alittle again unto himself, and then the Boyars had
much talk with him, and interrogated with him upon some points, but it could
never yet he well known, what passed betwixt them. And to the end that the
said Halberdier might divulge nothing of such matters as had passed betwixt
them, they presently killed him, and afterward they slew their Prince, with
many cuttes and thrusts, and so they drew out his body, throwing it down from
aloft with a cord fastened about his privities, and thus hacked, dragged it
toward the market place like a dog or some other vile carrion, leaving thus
his stripped and naked dead body, to the view of all the world, upon a plancher
or stage erected on high, till the fourth day after, and under him, the body of
his friend Peter Basmaneuf. There went every day thither great numbers of men
and women, to see this hideous sight, and they put an ugly visard upon the
Emperors belly, which they had found amongst the Empresses spoils, and in his
mouth the flute, with a kind of little bagpipe, under the arm with a piece of
money of the value of half a Patar, giving to understand by this, that for the
piece of money he gave them a hunts up, or fit of an old song. The popular sort
in the mean while, forbear not to run headlong up and down the Castle, and
into the Polonians lodgings, killing diverse of them, and pilling of their
houses, ransacking them in such sort as they had not a shirt left to put on
their bodies. The Musitions defended themselves a good while, and five or six
of them escaped, but the rest to the number of about twenty persons, were all
hewn in pieces.

The Lord Vayvods house, by reason it was environed with good walls, and had
also a good guard within, was saved: the gates were well baricadoed without, to
the end that no man might go out, or fly away. I leave every man now to
imagine, how this poor Princess with all her Ladies and Damsels, were
discomforted in their hearts: for she was presently robbed and spoiled of all
her riches, jewels, mooveables, apparel; and even the cowches, and beds
whereon she reposed, were taken away from under her: as also all the Lords and
Polonian Gentlemen were robbed of all the jewels and presents that had before
been given them. True it is, that they within the town defended themselves
very valiantly in their Innes, but in the end they were driven to yield, and
leave the boot to the others. The Lord of Vituenetskie only saved himself,
and his train, and killed many Russes, though they had planted the canon
against his house, and at last seeing himself hardly beset, he hung out a
white cloth, in sign that he determined to have yielded, causing presently a
number of ducats to be scattered before his chamber dooze. The Russians ran
thick and threefolde to anoint their fingers herewith, but his people issued
out suddenly upon them, and so slashing and hewing on every side, they slew
above an hundred Russes, and made an open way for themselves to go out, when
in the mean while, diverse Boyars of the Castle came, who took the said Lord
into their protection, and drive out all the common people, so that in the end,
all this allarum was appeased.

A Polish Gentleman called Nimetskie, brought thither sundry jewels of great
value, and had delivered them to the Emperor but the day before: as a servant
of the Lord Vol^kie did the like, having made show in the Court of diverse
goodly tapistries which he brought, all these things were taken from them. But
above others, diverse Almaine and Italian Merchants are to be lamented, amongst
whom, there was a very honorable aged man, who was called John Ambrosio Celari
a Mylanese, that had also delivered out of his hands at the Court, to the
value of three and twenty thousand Florines, who was there most villainously
murdered, by the rascal vulgar. In the same lodging remained also two servants
belonging to Master Philip Henbar, of Ausburg, who were recommended unto me by
my friends at Croeo, and had also delivered for the value of above 25000.
florines in merchandise sold to the Emperor, and yet they had taken from
them, besides above 10000. florins more. There is yet here a merchant of
Ausburg, called Andrew Nathan, which was out in the Court, above 200000.
florins, being robbed also of an 10000. florins, in goods and merchandise. Here
is also a Russian Merchant of Lemberg, called Nicholas, who has also lost
great store of goods. I am afraid they will never recover any repayment
thereof; I spoke twice with the Emperors brother now reigning, by way of
commending unto him, the affairs of these honest men, and presented unto him
their petitions, to the end, that by his mediation, something might be obtained
from the Emperor: but be gave me no other answer, but that this merchandise
was never delivered to the precedent Emperor, by the Treasurer of Russia, but
that the Polonians greased their fingers with it, so that the Russians, will
not now, hear on that side, they alleging further, that none of all these
things were ever found in the Treasury, but that this Royster (for he termed
him Rostrigo, which is to say, a riotous, or debauched monk, for so he called
the dead Prince) had sent it all out of the country, and that there was no
more money remaining in the Treasury, to pay such sums. These Almayne
Merchants, had also one of their servants, which was borne in Antwerpe, being
named Jacques, who was miserably slain, in this popular fury, and was thrown
amongst other dead bodies into a ditch, but I caused him to be found, and
drawn out, and did honorably bury him.

All things had such lamentable issue, in this terrible days work, and the
peoples cry was so dreadful, the alarm bell ringing continually, and there
being no end of slaughter, that I was in great anguish of mind, especially,
when as I saw, that they sacked the next house to my lodging, where the Lord
Peter Basmaneuf dwelled, who was one of the first, that was slain at the
Court, looking every minute, for no better a bargain then the rest: but in the
end, I took courage, and mounting on horse back, I brake through the press,
being accompanied with three of my servants, committing my self to Gods
protection, and I went to find out one of the Lords and Boyars, to obtain from
them a safe conduct, for fear of being massacred in mine own house, the
number of them was so great, whom I met with their cymitars all bloody, in
so fearful a manner, that I was many times exceedingly affrighted, and
thought to have forsaken my way, which had been my apparent death. But God was
so gracious to me, that I met in the streets two Marshalles, which were
officers of Justice in the City, who left me one of their men, for my guide,
and guard, with whom I returned to my lodging, but one of my servants
remained, and went with them, who procured me further fix others of their men,
to withstand them in the Justices name, if the multitude should have gone about
to force my house. I can never be sufficiently thankful to God, for preserving
me in this so evident, and manifest a danger. And so this alarm continued,
from morning till evening, but the night following, there was such a deep
silence over all this great City, as though there had not been one living
soul therein. The Innes of the Polonian Lords, were environed round about, and
kept with a good guard, and all their arms taken from them. If this nation had
kept good centinell, and held themselves in arms, and good order, or but set
fire on some parts of the City, when this alarm began, it had been the
horriblest slaughter, and the greatest effusion of blood that ever was heard
of: for there was a great number of them, and they were well horsed, and had
good arms, and there, the houses are all of wood: but God had his hand
herein, so that of the two, the less calamity happened: for the Polonians
have no goodness in them, but are full out as villainous, and bad as the
Russians.

The fury being thus pacified by this Emperors brother, being assisted by the
principal Lords, and Boyars, they assembled together about the election of
another Emperor, and so they jointly elected for their Prince, the Lord
Vasilius Inavovitz Cintskie, and this election was made, on the 20. of May.
Amongst the Dukes of this country, he is one of the most ancient, and of the
auncientest, and most renowned family, of all the Boyars: God give him a long
and happy life, and make him to govern well and justly.

The 29. of May, Demetrius his body, was dis-interred, and drawn out of the
City, it being there burnt, and consumed to ashes, and the multitude said,
they would have it thus performed: alleging, how it was to prevent the
charms, of that dead Enchaunter. For the same night after he was slain, there
was such a great, and wonderful frost, that all the corn of the fields was
spoiled, and as diverse very old men also affirmed, in their life time, they
never heard of the like, in so forward a season of the spring. All their
fruits, and gardens were spoiled, and the leaves of the trees in the forests,
were so withered, as it was to be feared, that this would cause a great dearth
of all things throughout the whole country: all corn grew presently double,
above the ordinary prise; but the night after his body was burnt, it was yet
a far greater frost, so that these barbarous, and infidel people believe,
that in his life time, he was a great Nigromancer, but they should rather have
ascribed it, to the great enormitie of their own grievous sins.

The thirty day of the same month the Articles of his condemnation were
publicly read, and wherefore they made him to be dispatched after this manner.
First, they alleged that he had been a shaven and graduated monk, whose
kinsmen, sisters, and brothers were yet living, that is, his father in law,
and his own mother, who were brought into the market place before all the
people, and their order is so strict, that every professed Monk, leaving his
order, and profaning his sacred vow, ought to be burned, and the like is
observed toward Nuns, there being no remission or pardon granted for such
an offense. For his father in law, his own mother, and his brother, who were
exposed, (as has been said) to the view of the whole world, they were reputed
to be the same, though they resembled him in nothing at all, and whether they
had suborned them, to confess such a matter in the presence of all men, God
knows, this I may be bold to affirm, that I see them as well as many others,
and I also saw them made, to kiss a cross, and take an oathe thereon, that
his name was Gregory, and in their language Griskie Strepy, and that he was a
Monk of this City in the monastery of the Castle: men say, that in his
youth he was very diligent to read and write, and delighted much to peruse
and read Histories and Chronicles, having sometimes served in the Patriarchs
Court, for a Singing man and a Musician, ever carefully observing whatsoever
might further his intentions, neither would he ever go into the said
monastery, as long as he was emperor, fearing (as men say) to be known by
some of those monks, that were drooping and old, like the good old Jades of
Galicia. Men say likewise, that at Galith, where he was borne, he caused his
father in law, his mother, brothers, and all the rest of his kindred, to the
number of three score persons, to be imprisoned in a tower: all this went
current amongst the common people.

The second point was, that he was a Magitian, and that by enchantment he had
obtained so many victories, and prosperous success in attaining to the Crown,

The third Article was, that he was known to be an heretic, that he never
observed their feasts, nor fasts, and that he made no account of their Images
and ceremonies.

The fourth Article imputed to him, was, that he had entered into a dangerous
and pernicious conspiracy with the Pope, against their Religion, wholly to
supplant that, and to bring in the Roman rites, even as there were written
Letters af the Popes found to that effect, while he was emperor, wherein he
was exhorted, to put in execution, what he had before so oftentimes promised
to the said Pope, persuading him, to procure in such sort, that the Jesuits,
and other Romish Priests, might be established in their Churches, and that
Temples and Colleges might be allotted them, to reform the whole Country.

For the fifth imputation, there were Letters brought forth, wherein he had
treated and concluded with the Vayvod, to give him the principality of
Smolenko, and to his wife, the principality of Novigrod, to their son the
country of Dibiria, and that they had plotted together to have massacred all
the Boyars, to extirpate their whole race, and to plant in their stead, the
Polonian Vayvodes, and to constitute new Castelans, and Starostes, sed haec non
credo: as also that he had drawn the Canon out of the City, and making show,
as though he intended it for some pastime or triumph, to turn them against the
City, and so to have bestowed on them so many canonadoes cross, or a thwart,
for their disseverance one from another, and thereupon the Polonians should
have fallen into the City, and killed all those which made any resistance,
and so to have made themselves absolute Lords of the chief City in the
Country, which might very well have been effected, if the Russians had not
stood well upon their guard: for, whosoever is master of that City, he is
Lord of the whole country. Howsoever it was, I refer my self to a further
time, which will discover all.

Sixthly, they complained greatly, because the Boyars and great Lords of the
country had so little, and in a manner, no access at all to the Prince, who
did disdain them, and after such a sort, as they were feign to attend before
the Palace gate, and oftentimes, were also repulsed by the Halberdiers,
whereas the Polonians, entered as often as they would, and being oftentimes
outraged, by this Polonian nation.

When they made their complaints, surdo narrabant fabulam; there was no justice
done, in revenge of the wrongs they endured, and moreover it was imputed unto
him, that he undertook all his affairs, without demanding their counsalle,
or advise in any thing, and when they replied to any point, difficult, or
doubtful, they were driven away with hand-blowes, disgraced, and sent into
exile.

The seventh was a complaint: about the great, and excessive expense he had
been at. He made him a gilded Throne, on each side of the same, there were six
Lions gilded, all of massy silver, the which no other great Duke ever did, and
the Scepter and Crown was never carried before any other, as it was before
this man, and that exceeding all his predecessors, he had bought many
iewelles, which were found in his cabbinet, as also a number of other precious
things, presenting diverse very prodigally: and having sent into Polonia huge
sums of money, so as the treasure was clean exhausted, and therefore he had
laid great taxes and impositions upon the country, not rewarding for all
this, those which deserved well, but ever favoring, rather Flatterers,
Buffons, and Juglers, to whom he would usually give rich gifts, and that
very largely too.

Eighthly, he was grievously accused to have profaned the sacred calling of
vowed Virgins, in coming to the monastery of Nuns where his wife was: and
going to see them oftentimes in very dissolute fashion, bringing thither
musicians with him, reveling and dancing there, and causing them to sing such
filthy songs, as wherewith these Virgins were greatly scandalized, who reputed
it for a wonderful sin: but above all, for having violated some of them, and
amongst the rest, one of Boritz Fendronitz his daughters, as also for
celebrating his nuptialles on the festival day of Saint Nicholas, which he
should have held in great reverence, according to the custom of all the
country. And further, that he had the image of the holy Virgin Marie standing
upon the bolster of his bed, when he went to lie with his new Spouse: For
making little account of monks and Priests, but causing them to be whipped,
like poor beasts, if they mumbled but a word betwixt their teeth, that he had
been a monk himself: and that he borrowed ten thousand Roubles out of a
Cloister, to repay them, ad calendar Graecas, with other such like matters.

Ninthly, he was accused to have been the Author, and occasion of a great
spoil, and damage, which fell out upon the river of Volga, causing himself
by false marks to be proclaimed the son of Fender Iuanouitz, whom under
this pretext he had suborned to come to his succor, with many thousand
Cosaques, to be the more secured of the country. Surely it must needs be
confessed, that he was the cause of marvelous ruin to the country, for all
the Ports of Astracasses were sacked, and all the goods and merchandise there,
robbed, and pilled: and out of Persia there comes great and inestimable
treasure, and though some will say, that the reuenews of all the country of
Russie amounts to above twelve millions: so we must suppose too, that all
this was too little for such a prodigal Steward, and if he meant to continue
his port and train as he had begun.

The tenth complaint was (and questionless it was an insupportable thing) of
the Polonian insolences, outrages, and villainies, for they esteemed the Russes
but as dogs, threatening them every day, beating them like slaves, and saying
oftentimes, that they would make them slaves. The women, yea the Ladies and
wives of the principallest amongst the Boyars, durst not any more go abroad
in the streets, may they would go and seize upon them in their houses and
lodgings, and where an husband walked with his Wife holding her by the hand,
they have cut off his arm, and led away his Wife. Upon all these complaints,
there was never no Justice executed. It so happened, that a Polonian was to be
put to death, for an offense committed, and as they led the malefactor out of
the town, the Poles issued out and slew the executioner, and frees their
companion, so that this sceemed a scourge and punishment prepared for them, by
the wrath, and vengeance of god. They further allege, infinite other faults,
but if these above alleged, only are true, such a barlet well deserved
death: yet it had been much more laudable, to have performed it, by course
of Justice. Some said, that a little before the very moment of his death, he
requested, that he might make his confession publicly, before all the world,
but it was then too late: I am of opinion, if he had borne him self more
mildely, without meddling with the Polos, and matched with some Lady of the
country, applying him self to their humor, though he had been baser then a
paunch fed Monk, yet might he have kept the Crown on his head: but I believe
that the Pope, with his Seminaries, and Jesuits, were a principal cause of his
ruin, and total subversion. For these murderers of Princes would needs have
made a Donke, too quickly, and they as suddenly light within the Be hiue. It
is pity that their heads, were no better shaven, but they were transformed,
too cunningly in so secular habit: such maskers, never paint themselves
lightly, but in green. I believe likewise, that the Polackes, will take heed
hereafter, how they be so insolent as they have been, they which yet remain
here behind, bear themselves, and go in the streets as meekely as Lambs,
they are distributed into diverse troops, of 2. and 3. hundred in a troop, and
so they are sent to Smolensko, and Polotsko, some horses being appointed them
for their conueyance: and to the end they should not take away those of the
paisants, but finding their guards asleep, they killed about a score of them,
but the rest awaking, revenged themselves presently upon the field, and slew
about six and thirty Polonians, so that they are all cast into gaoles and
prisons, of which, peradventure not one shall escape. I judge that in all, there
came short home about twelve hundred Poles, and four hundred Russes besides.
An Ambassador is sent from hence, into Poland, to inform the King of all which
passed here, and to treat of a peace, and in the mean while, the Vayuod must
stay here with all the Lords and Gentlemen about him (and so according to the
answer good or bad, which he returns, they shall be held or released.)

It is reported since, by those that have lately come over, that Iuan
Basiliuitz son, the right Demetrius, was by this present Emperor dug out
of his grave, having been fifteen years buried before at Ouglitz, whom he
presented to the view of many, his body being yet whole and entire, and holding
nuttes in his hands, with which he was buried, using to play with them when
he was a child. He is inferred in the Castle Church of Archangell, amongst
the Emperors, and the people ascribe unto him the working of miracles, which
they say are daily performed: and when they happen, general notice is given
thereof, by the sound of a Bell. They are determined to build a Church over
him, and to worship him as a Saint.

These be the principallest of such occurrences as happened in this City, I
beseech God to preserve us from a greater sedition yet suspected.

The fifteenth day of June the like began again, for this acursed vulgar are
ever hungry after boot and spoil, they would feign every day begin again
their former garboiles, but this last commotion was presently pacified by the
Boyars.

FINIS.
