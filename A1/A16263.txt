THE Notable Hystory of two faithful Lovers named Alfagus anb Archelaus.
Whearein is declared the true figure of Amytie and Freyndshyp. Much pleasant
and delectable to the Reader.

Translated into English meeter by Edward Ienynges. With a Preface or
Definytion of Freyndshyppe to the same.

Such as are troubled in Publyque afayres,
About common welthes by offices and cares:
In faithful freindshyp can never abide,
For so says Tully the thing has been tryde.

Edward Ienynges to the Reader.
THe wyes Philosopher Arystoetell does say,
Freindship is a virtue most incomparable,
And Tully does his words not denaye,
Saying it is a thing most commendable:
Both fyrme and sure, nothing deceyuable
For freinship with out virtue in no man can remain
Thus the wise Philosopher Tully tells plain.
Tully defyneth freindship on this wise also
Saying it is none other thing at all
But a perfect consent of things for to kno
Which as well to God as to men does befall,
Benevolence and charity embraced of great and small
Nothing is more comodious while men on earth do live
Then this except sapience which God to man does give.
Then which definicion is excelent and true
For in God and all things which of God does come
Nothing of more estemacion does ensue
Then Love called in latin Amoi all and some,
Amicitia desending and coming of Eum
In english called Freindship which taken a way
The life of man will soon fall in decaie.
No house can stand in quiet peace and rest
No feilde can bring his fruit in due season
If hatred and envy does dwell both East and Weste,
All men may judge then parfectly by reason
Finally of man is judged by discretion
He seems from the world to take a way the sum,
That from man's life would freindship daue undone.
Sith frendshyp then to man's life is so pure
Then all other virtues it does far excel.
And only in good men remains, this is sure,
From whose heart and mind no pain may excel:
But fyrmly and sure within them does dwell,
So that thereof none evil may proceed
Ne cause of thing which evil is in deed.
Between all men that be good can not be Amity
Always abiding without some decente,
Except they seem both of on quallitie,
Fourmed all a like by natures pretense:
In manners and study both equally bente,
And specially in manners, for that is the thing
Which knytteth the hearts both of one lykinge.
For Grauytye and Affabylytie be laudable both
And qualyties highlye to be had in este macyon,
So is Seuerytie and Placabylytie forsooth
Magnyfycence and Lyberalytie is of the same fassion
And yet Frugalitie by all wise men's Oracyon
Which shows a life both moderate and sober,
Is higher extolled then any of the other.
Yet wheare these virtues and qualyties be
Seperately a sundre amongst persons many,
Assembled together by tranquillity
May well be parfecte concord truly,
^t freyndshyp is there sildome verelye,
^or that which the one for a virtue imbraceth,
The other contemninge his mind, it neglects.
And there wheare descension of minds does appear
By reason can stand no parfecte Amytie,
Sith freindship is a consent entyre,
Of will and desires in one like quantytie:
Therefore is syldome seen for a certeinty,
That freyndshyp between such parsons should be,
Which in their desires can nothing agree.
Those which be liberal of heart and deed
Withholoyng nothing from them whom they love
Whearby increase of love does proceed,
And in them that be constante and will not remoue^
Is never mystruste nor suspection to prove,
Ne any surmysynge of evil report
Can draw their affection from them in any sort.
And by this thing is freindship made sure
Parpetually for ever both firm and stable,
But if like study or learning procure
Their minds in one thing to be delectable:
Joyeing to those virtues agreeable,
Freindship much rather does happen to stand
By mutual agreement with faithful band.
Nothing evil or vycious to man
In faithful freindship does happen to be,
The first election made of freindes than
Receueth all the importance truly,
Wherefore it would be done nothing rashely,
But with a long proof and great deliberacion
Deseruyng parfectly his former trade and fashyon.
For often times by fortune it comith to pass
A man now in welthe and great prosperytie,
Is brought in a momit much worsse then he was
Standinge in peril and great extremytie:
Freyndshyp often times then fails verily
As Ouy^es sweet sentence to us does declare
Hereafter following with words good and fair.
Whylste fortune thee favors, freindes thou have plenty
The time being troublous thou art alone,
And Culuere haunt houses made white and dayntie
To the ruonous Lowers almost comes none:
Of Emotes innumerable, uneath thou find one
In empty barnes wheare fails substance,
Happens no freinde in whom is assurance.
But if among many one choose to be found
In all cares of fortune his freyndshyp to hold,
The praise of his nane shall highly rebounde
And is more of value then silver or gold,
Or any comodytie that else can be told,
Of kyndred and blood none is so commendable
As one parfecte freynde in nothing deceyuable.
For Tully says from kyndred and line
Benevolence may soon be taken away,
But freyndshyp which never at naught does repine
Can never be severed by night nor by day:
So though benevolence in kindred does stay,
Yet the name of kindred does always stand still
But take it from freindshyp and clean it does spyll.
I am not able of freindshyp to show
A true definycyon in every thing,
Though all a whole year my wit I bestow
In such like sentences still wrytinge,
With many ancient Hystoryes searchynge
Whearin I should find such stoore to indyte
That in a large book I scarce could them write.
But gentle Reader I pray you have patience
In this malabour not worthy of praise,
Acceptinge well my mind and dillygence,
Occupyenge my pen thus on many idle days:
Whereby some profit does come many ways,
For unto all men it shows the virtue
Of amytie and freyndshyp parfecte and true.
Many young wyts desire for to read
Hestoryes oide, in Mecter delectable,
Of diverse good Knights and such as be dead,
Leauyng behind them a fame much commendable,
Yet is the reading thereof nothing profitable,
But in this small treatice a man may behold,
How freyndshyp is better then silver or gold.
The virtue of freindshyp in this shall be seen
Between two parsons most worthy of fame,
More truer in freinship has never none been
Then these Alfagus and Archelaus by name:
Many years living without any blame,
The one of Rome, of Carthage the other
Living more truly then brother and brother.
And unto God with all my heart I pray
That by this treatice some may ensample take
To learn to keep their freinship night and day,
When to their freindes like yromyse they do make:
In wealth and woe them never to forsake,
But now a days I fere but few men do live
That will unto their freyndes such freinshyp give.
And thus concludinge my simple Preface
Most heartily I pray the Readers all,
If in this book parhaps by my trespass
Some thing amysse to them does befall:
Show me my fault and mende it I shall
Desiring no man my work to disdain
Though simple it be and done with small pain.
FINIS.
The famous Hystory of Alfagus and Archelaus. Wherein is declared the true
figure of Amytye and Freindshyp.
Cap. i.
IN Rome sumfyme a Knight did dwell,
Both noble, wise and good.
His stock of auncyente Romans were,
And not of Rascal blood:
Lypodus hyghte this noble man
for so mem did him call,
Beloved he was of all folks in
the Cyttie, great and small.
A Lady had this noble Knighte
of worthy stock and fame,
Between whom God a son did send
Alfagus was his name:
Acomely Child and fair he was
as any man might see,
In learning apt to every thing
which taught to him might be.
This knight therefore when as his son
to lawefull years ded grow,
He thought how he by virtuous trade
might make him wisdom know:
But at the last by musing long
he understood right well,
Of Carthagye that noble place
much praise he hard men tell.
How that was chief and fountain of
all wisdom and all grace,
Next unto God all prudence came
and doctrine from that place:
And noble men from far about
their Children thither sent,
And Lypodus this knight therefore
even of the same intent.
His son Alfagus brought forth with
to Carthagye, that he,
Might learn good letters and also
a Scholar there to be:
And hosted him with one who was
an ancient man and wise,
A Senator of the City who
good council did deuyse.
Of Carthagie that noble place
and Cyttie of great fame,
The chiefest ruler then was he
and Olympus was his name:
This Olympus had a son also
whom Archelaus men did call,
In every part both hand and face
like Alfagus was he all.
Their age was equal both as one
agreeinge just and right,
Their faces so proporshined both
a like in all men's sight:
That no man could deserne the one
and say this is the other,
They were not known but by their names
of father nor of mother.
And as these two young gentlemen
agreid like in lymme,
Alfagus Archelaus unto
and Archelaus to him:
So in short space acquayntaunte grew
the one so to the other,
That inward love oprest their hearts
and each one called brother.
Their wills and Appetites both in one
so God had congulated,
That never since the world began
like them was none created:
At one time they together went
to study and to learning,
At one time they at meals also
took both a like refresshynge.
They both delyted in one kind
of doctrine, and thereby
They profyted and were therewith
both learned equally,
And to conclude, together they
with learning so increased,
That in short time to them might be
in Carthage none compared.
At length deseast Olympus (which was)
Archelaus father dear,
For whom Alfagus as well as he
did mourn with heavy chere
But then Archelaus after that
his father was deseased,
To all men known he was with goods
and riches much increased.
Wherefore to him was proffered
rich maryges many a won,
With maidens fair and bright, but he
set not his mind thereon:
And he then being ^ype of years
of parsonage with all,
Right well ve set in every lymme
a comely man and tall.
Wherefore his freindes and kynsmen all
exhorted him that he,
After this counsel set his mind
to wed some fair Lady:
To the intent his lynage he
might so increase there by,
But this young man his heart had set
so on Philosophy.
And on his friend Alfagus to
his love he set so su^e,
That if he should mary he thought
it cold not still endure,
But that he should leave of from one
and cleave another to,
Wherefore long time he did delay
the thing with much a do.
And would not consent to their mind
for ought that they cold say,
How be it, still they would not rest
to move him day by day,
To mary one that might him please
and gyt some Child her by,
Which might inherit and have his land
when he should chance to dye.
So at the last he granted, because
his freindes on him so sore,
Even by importunat calling on
still daily more and more,
And partly by the aduyce and mind
of Alfagus his friend dear,
And by dysyre of many mo
he drew their purpose nere.
Consenting for to mary one
in whom he might delyght,
And in all things unto his mind
right pleasant in his syght^
With which words all his freindes and kyn
was wondrous glad in heart,
And busyly for him a none
each one did show his part.
And sought wheare they might find a maid
for (...) right fair and good,
Of like years unto him, and of
sow worthy ^euse and blood,
So long they sought that at the last,
a maybe they did espy,
Of parsonage, manners. and in age
in excelent beauty.
A comely damsel and a tall
in equal stature pyght,
With eyes as graye as glass, and skin
most like to snow was white:
Of equal years she was to him
in virtuous manners taught,
Of noble blood full rich also
no better might be sought.
This Lady thought they good, for such
a gentleman of kind,
They thought her apt for him, and he
in her might please his mind:
When Archelaus freyndes and eke
the maidens freindes also,
Had talked all their mind, and when
each one their wyls did know.
And on the couenauntes were agreed
how the marriage should be,
They gave Archelaus chounsaile that
the maiden he should see:
And often repair to her, so that
he might right well at ease,
Know with his heart if that she with
her beauty might him please.
Archelaus goes to see his Lady, Who pleases him right well. He carries
Alfagus with him to see her, who is so taken in her love that he, lies sick
with intolerable pain.

Cap. ii.
AFter the counsel of his freindes
Archelaus did agree,
And went without delay anon,
his Lady for to see:
Who in all parts he found to be
so pleasant to his mind,
That if he should seek all the world
none better could her find.
Nor to his hearts desire he thought,
might be found one so meet,
Wherefore anon with loving words
to her he spoke full sweet:
And said fair Lady is your mind
to have me for your make,
And can you find within your heart
all other to forsake.
Save only I, and cleave to me
how say you Lady bright?
She answered him, (and said) for sooth
all that is in my might,
I am content to do your mind
my hearts desire is so,
And thus when they had talked long
and each their love did knew.
Archelaus did return again
to Alfagus his freinde,
No love of Lady in the world
might take him from his mind:
Yet often times when to study they
together both did go,
Many times Archelaus when
Alfagus did not know.
Stale secretly away, and to
his Lady did resort,
That he with her in pastyme good
might make some pleasant sport:
And not withstandyng the great love
which to his freynd he bare,
Yet often times to his Lady he
on this wise did repair.
But at the last when shamefastnes
surmounted in his breast,
Within his heart he could not have
at no time quiet rest,
Untyll his secret iourneys were
unto Alfagus told,
Wherefore anon these words he spoke
and said with courage bold.
Dear freinde Alfagus so it is
my freindes on me did lie,
As you do know right well enough
to wed some fair Lady:
That so I might increse the stock
of me and of my father,
How be it (god does know) with ye^
to ^yde yet had I rather.
What then? it is so now that I,
have chosen a Lady bright,
Who to my heart in all things is
right pleasant in my sight:
And often times have I stolen away,
from you unknown till now,
When as we were at study both
and ye wist not hynge how.
To goo and see her whom I love
she does me so delyghte,
For with her beauty my whole heart
is fyxed day and night:
To morrow therefore will I go
about this time and tide,
And you with me shall go that theare
to gether we may abide.
An hour or twain and pass the time
with some solace and play,
Where as you may behold and s^e
my Lady fresh and gaye:
Alfagus answered him and said
I am right well content,
To go with you my friend I think
the time no better spent.
And feign I would behold the maid
you playse so much to me,
For since you spoke first of her I
have longed her to see:
Thus when they talked had awhyle
the night on them did draw,
Wherefore to rest they went anon
when best their time they saw.
Thus when the darkness had his course,
and Phoebus beams so bright,
The restles Son I mean did shawe
upon the earth same light:
The morning son, with shininge beams
all lands has over spread.
And from the skies the droppynge shade,
of night away was fled.
Alfagus rose, and longed to see
the maiden bright of hew,
Arise up Archelaus he said
that I may go with you:
To see her whom you praised so
my heart is very feign,
Even now anon Archylaus said
we will go thither both twain.
Where with he rose and so they both
anon to gether did go,
But how they sped, if you will hear
I will unto you sho:
Forth goes these two young gentlemen
and when one hour was spent,
They came whereas the maid did dwell
and into the house they went.
Who of the Damsel was anon
received ioyfullye,
But as soon as Alfagus had
upon her set his eye:
Beholdynge her most comlye face
with parsonage demure,
Adorned all in bew^ie, and
In espectable pure.
Her lyppes as red as any Rose
nothing there was a^ys,
With sober countenance myxed all
with maydenlye shamefastnes:
Her taulke so sweet and pleasant was
for Alfagus to behold.
That with the sight of her anon
his sprytes were very cold.
His heart was persed through out
blind Copyds darte with all,
And with which wound for deadly smart,
almost on sound did fall:
So v^ment and so ferce his pain
increased more and more,
With still beholdynge of that maid,
which stood his eyes before.
That nerther the great study of
Philosophy, nor yet
The remembrance of his most dear freinde,
Archelaus any whyt:
Could once wythdrawe that unkind love
out of his heart and bres^e,
But more and more his pain did grow
not knowing what way to rest.
But that of force he must needs love
and that inordynatelye,
That Lady which Archelaus his friend
had chosen to marry:
All be it with incredyble pains
he kept his thoughts unknown,
Untyll they both returned were
and to their lodgings gone.
The miserable Alfagus then
with wandrynge himself a side,
As though in secret study he
intended to abyde^
All tormented in sorrow and care
with love oppressed sore,
Upon his bed he laid him down
tormented more and more.
Rebukynge there him self of most
unkind and spytefull hate,
For with the sight of that fair maid
which he had seen of late:
He had conspyred such great evil
against his freinde so dear,
Who had him loved so wondrous well
in faythfulnes many a year.
Alas what evil time (quoth he)
was it when I was borne,
Alas for coming to this place
why had I not forsworn:
Alas my father, wherefore brought
you me here to this place?
Why did you not keep me at home
out of this wretched case.
Alas that ever I did acquaynt
my self with one so true,
As you my friend Archelaus are
but I again to you,
Most like a brutyshe beast unkind
from Nature gone awrye.
And have deserved of your part,
great batred to imploye.
And with those words deep sighs and sore,
out from his heart he sent,
That ever he came to Athennes
often times he did repent:
Thus still in dollour and in care
he tombled and he toste,
That little lacked it of his heart
to be in pieces brast.
But unto no man durst he once
dysclose his secret sore,
So that at length most grievous pains
increased more and more:
And forced him would he or not
still on his bed to lie,
Receauyng naught wherewith he might
have him sustuyned bye,
No sleep at all nor rest he took
no sustinaunce nor food,
He would receive wherewith he might
have done his body good:
That he so feeble was and faint
so weak of ly^^^e with all,
That in his legs, his body to bear
no strength there was at all.
Archelaus goes to see Alfagus, who lies suck for love and to whom Alfagus
con^esseth all the cause of his sycknes, greatly reyronynge him self of
unkindness.

Cap. iii.
TO Archelaus was fold a non
part of Alfagus care,
How he full sick to bed was gone
and almost in despair:
With which words he was sore abusht
and went forthwith to see,
How his dear freinde Alfagus did,
and what his pain might be.
But when he did approach the place
where as Alfagus lay,
Beholdynge there his most dear friend
in such paynefull array:
The red Rose colors in his face
which was wont to appear,
All turned into sallow pay
with wan and heavy cheer.
His red lyppes pale and almost black
his eye lyds suncke full low,
That skarce behol^yng in his face
he could his vissage know.
He might from weeping scarce refrain
the teaes ^y force out braste,
But then remembrynge him again
refrayned at the last.
Fear least he thought such sorrowful sight
might most his friend anoy,
Wherefore he turned back again
his countenance unto joy:
Comfortynge his dear friend in all
that ever he might do,
Desiring him and said how came,
this great disease in you.
And why have you been so unkind
not showing me at all,
Of this disease which unto you,
of late time did ^efall:
But thus unkindly and unwise
to seek your own decay,
When as I might by knowing thereof
have sought some help and way.
If any thing for silver or gold
to help you might be bought,
I would not stay my self till all
this regyon I had sought:
And though that it should cost me all
the substance I could make,
Yet would I think it well bestowed
to spend it for your sake.
With which words then the mortal sighs
tenued more and more,
Within Alfagus heart, and he
began to weep full sore:
So that abundauntlie the tears
down from his eyes did fall,
And many a sorrowful syghe he sent
out from, his heart with all.
The which when Archelaus saw
he could no more forbear,
But was resolved to tears a non
his heart all fyxed in care:
And said Alfagus most dear friend
do not your mind delay,
But show me all and every deal
most heartily I you pray.
Alas why are you so unkind
that you will not disclose,
Your secret sickness unto me
when as I did suppose:
You would not have kept back from me
no secret thing at all,
For I would have hid naught from you
what soever might befall.
Therefore I pray you let me know
what grievous pain you have,
That I may seek some help with haste
you from the death to save:
For nothing is to me so dear
nor precious in my sight
But for you^ sake he will anon
depart with it forth right.
Although mine own life I should lose
It would I not delay,
But run and go all that I might
for your help night and day:
The whyth words when Alfagus hard
and saw the moon and grief,
Which his dear friend ^laus made
to seek for his relief.
All ^yng and in shamefast wise
by force as then constrained,
Unto his friend his tale he told
and in this wise complained
My most dear friend and faithful mate
lea^e of your faithful mind,
Call back again the words you spoke
some help for me to find.
And rather slaye me where I lie
draw out your knyfe therefore,
Dyspatch my days that I may see
the ^e^ght of heaven no more:
Most miserable wretch and Traytorfalce
to you my feiende am I,
And of all men upon the Earth,
most worthy for to dye.
For like as god by his great power
has formed us as one,
All like in every form and part,
for men to look upon:
So has he made ou^ minds agree
in every thing alyke,
For look what one of us would have
the other thereto does seek.
Our minds and apetytes are as one
they dyffer naught at all,
I think that never with no men
like friend ship did befall:
And now so soon (alas I say)
so soon this love is gone,
Good friend ship is excluded and
of reason there is none.
No doctrine does anayle, nor man
in wisdom may not trust,
Nor no fydelytye in a friend
in this case may be just:
Yea Archelaus the great trust
Which you on me did lay,
Has caused me for to conspyre
against you now this day.
(Alas against you my dear friend)
to do this thing vn^yght,
How have I ^en inta^g^ed with
some foul ^ous spryght:
What thing was in your mind alas
when wisdom was away.
Why told you me of that fair maid
which is so fresh and gay.
And you have chosen her to wife
(alas) why did you se?
Why had you not left me at home
but let me with you go?
(Ahlas I say) where was your wit
remembrynge not at all,
The great fragillitie of our love
and Natures bond with all.
What need you have regard of me
what pleasure you did find,
In the beholdynge of her whom
you loved in your mind:
Why would you have me se her whom
your self could not behold,
But with the beutie of her face
your love to her had told.
Your mind was fyxed and your heart
was rauyshed her to see,
And yet for that in all this thing
you had no mind of me:
(Alas why did you so forget
and could not think upon
That both our wills and apetytes
has been always as one.
For always that which in your eyes
was pleasant for to see,
Has always been in every part
in like sarte unto me:
What need more words Archelaus for
your trust in me I say,
Has caused me with unkind love
to be intrapt this day.
The raynes and pleasant beams most fair
ensuyng from her eyne,
Whom you have chosen for to love
has pearst this heart of mine:
Yea the remembrance of her and
her virtues manyfold,
Has strouken me with a deadlye wound
and made my heart full cold.
So that I do desire naught else
but like an unkind wretch,
I might depart out of this life
this myserye to dispatche:
As one not worthy to have life
and fellowship with you,
My most dear friend which always has been unto me so true.
But I have been to you unkind
(alas) why should I live?
And with those words out from his heart
full heavy syghes did give:
Desolued all with tears great store
which from his eyes did run,
Con ^dyng these his words in care
as he had them begun.
Archelaus accuses him self of Follye. He renounceth his t^ that he has in
the Lady to Alfagus and shows him the way how he shall have her to his
wife, unawares to all his friends.

Cap. iiii.
WHen Alfagus made an end
and had confessed all,
How with the sight of y^ fair maid
what pain did him befall:
His dear friend Archelaus then
as nothing discontente,
Nor yet astoyned at the thing
in which his friend was be ^te.
But with a merye countinaunce,
Alfagus did embrace,
He kyssed him and on this wise
his words forthwith did place:
Why friend Alfagus at your heart
is this same all the grief?
And had you thought within your heart
there could be no relief.
Alas why? were you so unkind
that ye would not declare,
The cause of this your pain to me
but in your hatte it bare:
Alas why keep you of so long
and would not let me kno,
Why were you so unkind to keep
your secret mind me fro.
I do confess my folly here
wherewith I am attaynte,
You have disclosed my fond wit
to me in your complaynt:
For showing unto you the maid
wom I chose to my wife,
I did remember nothing in
the nature of our life.
Nor how our minds and apetytes
in all things does agree,
Nor yet the unity of our hearts,
remembered was of me:
Wherefore it is no man but I
which has done all this ill,
Surely I can not well excuse
my self by reasons skyll,
For who of right can prove that you
have trespassed at all,
When with the mutable darte of love
your heart was struck with all:
Why think you I am such a fool
which can not understand,
The mighty stroke of Uenus power
whom love does take in hand.
For where she lysteth for to show
the vyolent course of care,
To press the heart oportunatlye
with panges she does not spare:
Have not you well cesysted when
to death you are near brought:
And thus in torments for to slake,
that apetyte you have sought.
What more importunate love of you
may I require then,
More faithful love in all the world
has never ben of men:
And should I seek for to expel
that thing which god has wrought
Seth she, predestinate was to you
before I of her thought.
If I should so think of this thing
my wit were spent in vain,
What were my study all my life
but foolyshe and no gain:
Should I seek for the prudent Art
Phylosophye to know,
Nay, nay, Alfagus in my heart
let never god do so.
But surely I confess in deed
to love the maid as well,
As any man possible may
which wysdomes art can tell:
And took more pleasure in my heart
berbeutye to behold,
Then in my lands my father left
my silver or my goulde.
The which you know does much abou^d
in vallue for to be,
Yet at my heart they are not half
so pleasant unto me:
But now I know within your heart
her love surmouuteth more,
Then five times it has done in me
of all the time before.
Yea without measure in your heart
I know the darte does stinge
Of ragyng love but should I think
that were wanton lustyng:
Or suddayne apetyte of your mind
delyghtyng in solace,
Have I not known the manner of
your life in every place.
How you were honest good and wise
in every kind of way,
Uayne dalliaunce and fond toys unmeet
your use was not to play:
Shall I immagyn then in you,
mallis, disceit or guyle,
Sith you and I have fostered ben
together of long while.
Even from our chyldhood until now
yet could I never see,
But that you have been gentle sweet
and freindelye unto me:
Between us twain was never strife
since one the other knew,
But still agreed in every part
to live like brethren true.
Nay godforbid that noble band
of friend ship which has been,
Alfagus and Archelaus heart
enclosed all within:
To he suspected any deal
of hatred and dispyte,
Or any fantasye of the mind
should press my head unright.
Whereby the honorable love which is
between us all and some,
Might hyndred be in any part
the mountenaunce of a crome:
Nay, nay, Alfagus it is so
as I before have said,
For by selestiall power deuyne
you poynted were that maid.
God had appointed her to you
when first he gave her life,
That only she should be your love
your Lady and your wife:
For such a fervent love as this
oppresses not the heart,
Of any man virtuous and wise
with such an earneste smarte.
But by a prouydence deuyne
wheare at if I should seek,
To make resistaunce any deal
to have the thing I leeke:
I should not only be unjust
against my friend most true,
Witholdinge that thing which of right
belongs unto you.
But also be repugnaunte from,
gods high determynation,
Aduaunsyng up my heart therein
to make a confutacion:
Which thing shall not befounde in me
by help of god with all,
Therefore Alfagus my dear freinde
dysmay you not at all.
Of this the chance of love now fyxte
within your heart to stand,
But ioyouslye do now receive
the yoke of lovers band:
For I am nothing discontente
with this my sudden chance,
But merueylouslye with fervent joy
my heart it does advance.
Sith that it is my chance for you
a Lady for to fond,
Which is so greable to your heart,
and pleasant in your mind:
With whom you may hereafterlyue
in great felycitie,
Receauyng fruit by Gods high power
your children for to be.
Which may amplefie, and increase
great honor to your name,
And all your lynage will rejoice
when they shall see the same:
Wherefore I will renounce to you
my title and my right,
And clearly all that I shall have,
with that fair maid so bright.
I give it clearlye unto you
as it is given to me,
For ever more while life does last
your Lady for to be:
Call to your prestynate courage again
wash clean your vyssage white
Amend your eyes forlorn with tears
by weepyng all this night.
Abandon all your heavy cheer
the day appears nigh,
Which you do know I did apoynt
the maid for to marrye:
Let us consult betimes therefore
how we may bring about,
That you right wyselye may attain,
your purpose through out.
And all your hole desires so
for to atchyue with joy,
Take heed therefore unto my words
and mark well what I say:
you know right well that we are both
so like in every plate,
Preporshioned all in every lymme
both body, head, and face.
Our speech and countenance does agree
so like in every way,
That if we were apparrelled both
alyke in one array:
And both apart for to be seen
yet few men could then know,
Which of us were the other and
unto his fellow show.
Also you do remember well
the custom of this land,
That not withstanding all these words
by ioyoyng hand in hand:
The marryage not confirmed is
all hoollye just and right,
Untyll in Chamber they be come
together both at night:
And that the husband has put on
his wives finger a Ringe,
And also does unloose therewith
the knot of her gyrdlynge:
Then is the marryage fullye knyt
and they be man and wife,
To live so long in one accord
as God shall give them life.
Therefore will I my self be theare
before my friends in place,
Performynge all the brydemans part
in every point and case:
And you I will in secreat hyde
wheare none shall you espy,
Untyll at night when that to bed
each man him self does hye.
And then you shall conuaye your self
in the most secreatest wise,
In to the Chamber of the maid
as I shall best deuyse:
And nothing shall the maid espy
or think of you a mis,
Because your raiment unto mine
so like in all things is.
Your parsonage also, in all points
will seem unto her sight,
So like to mine that by no means
she can epsy the sleyght:
And shortly gea^ you to the bed
delay not long the thing,
And on her finger straight ways then
put on your own gold ring.
Her Gyrdle of virgynitie
undo without delay,
Fulfill your pleasure all the night
as lovers list to play:
Comfort your self Alfagus therefore
my loving friend most dear,
With good refection and solace
relyue your heavy cheer.
That this color wan and pale
your cheeks so lean and thin,
Be not the cause to let the thing
which easily you may win:
I know right well within my mind
that when this thing is done,
And that you do enjoy the maid
by me as now begone.
I shall deryded be of all
the foalke that shall it know,
And all my kynted with dispyte
their Irefull hate will show:
In seeking all the means they can
me to expulce and drive,
Out of this City in short time
a bannyshed life to live.
And think me to be such a one
as has done great out rage,
By geuyng of a great reproach
unto my parentage:
But god shall work his will therein,
my mind is fully bente,
To do the thing that I have said
is all my whole intent.
I force not for the furyous rage
of any spytefull foe,
Ne yet what pain I do abide
by Fortunes frownyng blow:
So that you my friend Archelaus
may live in fortunes grace,
And have felyrytie to increace
your honor with solace.
Archelaus marriethe the Lady for Alfagus. Alfagus confirms matrymonye and
lies with her all the night, Archelaus defireth al his friends to give ear to
the Oracion which Alfa gus would make.

Cappit. v.
With this Alfagus turnde himself
as one awakte from sleep,
And thought he had but seen a dream
more cares on him to heap:
And doubtyng whether he had hard
Archelaus speak or no,
Or seen a vision in his mind
devised to be so.
As he before had hard his friend
with friendly words declare,
But lookynge up with steadfast eyes
right well perceived thar^:
His friend Archelaus standing by,
with tears lamentyng still,
Left Fortune by her fatal wheel
his hole deuyce should spyll.
The woeful Alfagus set him up
not knowing what to say,
But comfortyng his most dear friend
in all that ever he may:
Thankyng him then for his kind words
which were incompetable,
Refusyng it sith that he said
I am so ^aryable.
More better were it that there should
a hundred such as I,
Like unkind wretches to be slain
or some evil death to dye:
Then that so noble a man as you
should sustain any ill.
Or that reproach or damage should
come any ways you till.
But then Archelaus in his arms
his friend Alfagus took,
Comfortyng him all that he might
with many a merye look:
And therewith all did swear and eke
protest as not dysmayd,
That with glad heart al things should be
as he before had said.
He sweetlye kyssed him also
and said my friend most dear,
All things shall be accomplysht well
therefore be of good chere:
Alfagus then perceauyng that
all things were fyrme and sure
And that no feigned friendshyp did
his faithful friend alure.
He set him up with joyful heart
right in his bed as he,
Had felt before no pain at all,
but wakt from sleep to be:
The quick blood in his vyssage then
began for to restore,
Such color as by nature he
received had before.
And after he had well sustained
with some good drink and meat,
His feeble body which before
had no desire to eat,
In few days was brought again
unto his woonted state,
Like to Archelaus in all things
his faithful freinde and mate.
The day of marriage did approach
each one with busye care,
Did seek for such things as should need
the weddyng to prepare,
Archelaus was deuysyng still
the best and surest way,
How he his friend Alfagus might
is to his ro^me conuaye.
Now thought be this, now thought he that
as fancy did him guyd,
At length he found the secr^test feat,
that else be might provide:
And showed Alfagus all the thing
in what place he should stand,
Take heed therefore (quoth he) that you
be reddye at my hand.
At night when we to bed shall go
within the chamber door,
Behind the cloth there is a hole
where you may be full sure:
And before we to bed most come
I will conuaye you that^,
So that when I shall come and bring
with me the maybe so fair.
You shall come forth behind my back
and I will slyp away.
So no man shall ^sp^e the sleyght
because that your array:
Is like to mine in every thing
your vyssage eke also,
Resembles mine so that the maid
of this can nothing ^^o.
Be of good cheer Archelaus said
my friend Alfagus now,
Leave studyeng in all other things
and think on naught but how:
you may accomplish your desire
be of good cheer therefore,
The day is come that now from death
to life I must restore.
The day was come and then anon
the Lady fresh and gaye,
Archelaus took and to the chu^the
her lead without delay:
Acompanyed with his friends and hers
right honorable to behold,
The couenauntes were ag^e^id upon
and each their mind had told.
Unto the other and anon
when all things else was done,
They hasted home where as the feast
with great joy was begone:
That day they passed with much mirth
and sportes in sundry wise,
Each man a sundry game and play
for pastyme did devise:
Between Archelaus and the maid
such entertaynement grew,
That all men theare had great delight
their lovely looks to ^ewe:
Praysyng greatly Gods good gift
sith Nature did agree,
To give them beauty virtue and
the art of curtesye,
Which were right excele^t in these twayn
excelling others far,
That in the City of each sort
before times wededd ware:
What shall I say the day was spent,
and Phoebus beams so bright,
Descended down into the west
where hidden was his light.
The twyncklyng stars by wonted course
appeared in the l^ye.
And every man and woman fast,
unto their rest did by^:
Archelaus and the maiden then
acompaned with her kyn,
were brought unto their chamber door
and as they entered in.
Alfagus hydden in the wall
right well did them behold,
And fearyng least he might not speed,
his heart was very cold.
But then Archelaus thynkyng on
his friend Alfagus case,
Deuysynge how or by what means
he might come in his place.
Dismissed all the foalke away
and thankt them for their pain,
And said I with my lady now
must taulke a word or twain:
Give place to us now at this time
most heartily I you pray,
To morrow will we pass the time
with more disport and play.
Each one departed them anon
no wight was left behind,
But even Archelaus and the maid,
each one to say their mind:
Alfagus living still in hope,
thought every mynute a year,
Archelaus careful was also
that Alfagus might appear.
Howbeit he with ardent love
desired her to have,
Above all worldly treasures but
his friends life then to save:
He had most ardent care of all
fair maid therefore said he,
A little while I must depart
I pray you tarrye me.
And made as though to ease him self
unto the stool he went,
He to Alfagus took his way
naught else was his intent:
Alfagus joyful for to see
his friend Archelaus cheer,
Without delay came forth anon
all frustrate was his care.
Archelaus stood in Alfagus place
and Alfagus forth did go,
Unto the maid the which as then
thereof did nothing kno:
Now is Alfagus laid in the bed
he made no long delay,
The maiden knew not whom he was
and did him not denaye.
For why? we thought naught else but ye
Archelaus had been theare,
But alfagus joyful was to see,
that he so well did fare:
These two young wedded foalkes therefore*
no longerlye they may,
For ^^h man hyed fast to rise
so far spent was the day.
Archelans thought it was most meet
for to disclose his mind,
While all his kynred theu were there
no better time to find:
Alfagus his dear friend therefore
be unto him did ca^ll,
And placed him within the myddest
among his kinds foalke all.
And all the nobles that did dwell
in Carthagye was theare
To whom Archelaus reverence showed
desyryng them full fair:
To give attentyue ear a while
that Alfagus might discus,
A secre at thing Archelaus said
which he will say to us.
Who being placed in his ^owme
amongst the myddest of all,
Declared forth such words to them
as after follow shall.
The Oracion which Alfagus made before the freindes of Archelaus, opening unto
them the hole matter.

Cap. vi.
MY freindes and nobles of Carthage
this day amongst you all,
An insample is showed incredible
which lately did befall:
Which does dyscrybe the deuyne power
of honorable love,
Whose forcyng darte with deadly stroke
excels all above.
This love has brought perpetual fame
and eke great commendacion,
Unto this City and also
unto the Grecians nation:
Wherefore you ought right excelentlye
great comfort for to take,
And give due thanks to God the which
this ardent love did make.
If that among you there remain
such ancient wise report,
As had your noble progenytours
which wear of the like sort:
For what more praise may be to men
that on the earth do dwell,
Then faythfullnes, Benevolence, and constancy
whose virtues does excel.
For lack whereof all countries and
all Cities do decay,
Unto desolacion and ^uen eke
they run without delaye^
Like as by them also they ^ome
to great and high prosperytie,
With high estate and much renown
of Prudence and felycytye.
What shall I long delay the time
or tar^y in the thing,
Coniectyng mine intent and not
to tell my hole meaning:
You know ^yght well each one of you
from whence I came and how,
Unto this City I was sent
whearas I am even now.
And by adventure I did find
the house of Olympus here,
Who of long time a very friend,
he was to me most dear:
His s^nne Archelaus theare I found
of mine own age and state,
Who in all things was like to me
him chose I for my mate.
We were so like in every thing
the one unto the other,
That we could not deserned be
of father nor of mother:
But only that we would our selves
tell one another name,
Unto our parents and also
to others show the same.
So that at length about our necks,
sylke laces they did taye,
Of sundry colors that they might
deserne us by that way:
What mutual love and agreement
has by^ between us twain.
This eight years always since I came
with Olimpus to remain.
You all be witnesses that have been
be holders of the thing,
Tose our sweet conversation you
have always been wandrynge:
And also our consent of mind
in lust and apetye,
You never saw dyscorde, no^ once
wherein we did varrye:
And as for my part after that
my father was deseased,
Not withstandyng that to me
abundantly there happened:
Great possessions and houses fair
with riches eke innumerable,
And proffers of hye dignity
with Ladies fair and amyable.
My freyndes and alyans eke also
their letters to me sent,
Desiring me importunately
to ^od as they have mente:
In coming home for to receive
mine erytage due to me,
Yea them which in the Senate now
of all most ancient be.
Offered me advancement hye
in dignity to raygne,
Amongst those which the publycke wealth
does seek for to maintain,
I will not now remember of
the lamentacions great,
Which my most natural mother made
me homwardes to entreat,
Expressyng with most tended words
in letters to me sent,
All blotted with tears ye which on them
abundantly were sprent:
Where in she did accuse me sore
because I did delay,
The time so long and unto her
not seek to come away.
Saying that I am much unkind
sith nature would agree,
Specially now in her most need
her comfort for to be:
But yet all this within my heart
could not at all prevail,
Ne to remove Archelaus from
but to the bread^h of my nail.
And but that force does me constrayne
by nature so provided,
I could nor may not be with drawn
for any thing contryued:
Once from his company most sweet
and pleasant unto me,
Acsepte with his most gentle heart
he does thereto agree.
I chusynge rather for to live
with him by fatal doom,
His fellow and companyon to be
then counseler of Room:
For which my kind nes has been well
aquitted now this day,
Or else redoubled by his help
if I the troth do say.
Delyueryng me from cruel death
whereto I was so nigh,
That of all deaths I should have dyed
a death most cruelly:
And so Lachesus should have spunne
my fatal thread in yayne,
My pleasant years and youthful days
the fryttell earth should gain.
I do perceive you wonder much
ye noble Athenes now
To hear of these and of atrouth
no marvel is for how
Or what is he so bold of heart
that burst attempt with Ire,
To satysfye his cruel mind
my death for to conspire*
Being a Romayne and decente
of ryall Romans blood,
Or who else think you would be so
malicious, or so wood:
To sley me? whom you all do know
has done no villanye,
To any man or woman which
does dwell within this Cy^ye.
You all shall be my judge therein
if that it be not so,
For if I should mysuse my self
you might well thereof kno:
For in your syghtes I have been still
since to this City I,
Came first, and in Olimpus house
appointed was to lie.
Nay nay my freyndes there is no man
that I herein accuse,
Before you all my friends here
no such talk will I use:
I do perceive you lysten still
and would desire to kno,
What man he was that did presume
or seek to use me so.
With cruel deed and great dyspyte
my life from me to take,
Or in like sort to do this fact
such enterprise did make
It was love, o Carthagines,
even that same love I say,
Which as your Poettes does declare
has wounded many a way.
The chiefest part of all the Gods
to whom ye honor give,
The whylst they were on earth, and here
like earthly men did live:
This love constrained Jupiter
to swym as does a Swan,
And be transformed like a Bull
to hyde his shape of man.
Hercules eke the vanquysher
of monsters great and strong,
Lions fearce and Gyantes huge
with bodies large and long:
The same love caused him by force
upon a Rock to spyn,
Sittyng amongst the maidens clad
a woman's clothyng in.
The same lone also which did cause
the Princes ferse and stout,
Of Greese and eke all Asya to
assemble in a route:
En^am^yng in the fy^^des of Croy
with many (...) fight,
And many storm and tempast they
did sastayne day and night.
The same lone I do say against
whose ferce al^^uites to strive,
May no resistaunce he at all,
that reason can contryue,
Has wounded me so suddenlye
and stroke my heart so sore,
That remediles I should have died
no man could me restore.
Had not Archelaus helped me
through his freindship incomparable,
I should have ended miserabeliye
my woeful fyfe incurable:
I see you do desire to know,
and feign would have me tell,
Whom where, and what she is, that I
have chosen to love so well.
O noble Carthagines in this
no longer will I stay,
But openly declare it now
to you without delay:
It is Andromycus the Lady fair,
the which Archelaus chose,
To be his wife till desteny did
their fatal threddes vniose.
Whom he did love most intyrlie
but when his gentle heart,
Perceived love had strouken me
even with her forsynge darte
And that my love was set as then
more higher in degree,
Then his and that I forced was
to love then his Lady.
And that it never did proseede
of wanton lust nor will,
Neither it of conversation long
whereby to taulke out fill:
Corrupt desire or fantasye
he saw no sway did bear,
But with the only sight of her
so taken in the snare.
That I immediately was strouke
with most incurable care.
Desyring all that ever I might,
death to dyspatche my days,
Prouokyng thereto all I could
by sundry kind of ways:
But he then by his wisdom soon
perceived well the thing,
As I doubt not but that ye do
by this my tale tellyng.
That by predestinacion she
of God was given to me,
And not to him but that she should
my only Lady be:
Whereto be geuyng place as one
both faithful wise and just,
Estemyng more our freyndshyp then
a woman's love and lust.
Whereto he was end^sed more
by his freyndes will and mind,
Then by the vyolence of Cupids darte
constrained after kind:
Wherefore right wyllingly to me
his intrest he did give.
The which he to the damsel had
that so his freynd might live,
And it is I (Alfagus) truly
which did the wayden wed,
I put a Ryng her finger upon,
and went with her to bed:
Of shame fastnes her Gyrdle then
forthwith I did vntaye,
By her I have line all this night
what would you have me say.
I have confyrmed matrymonye
and made her now a wife,
She is mine own and I am hers
while God shall lend us life:
It these words they which present were
began to murmr fast,
And on Archelaus daynusly
full greuouse looks did cast.
Then Alfagus spoke again and said
why look you on him so,
Leave of your gr^dgyng countenaunces
and menassynges which you sho:
Toward my friend Archelaus for
he has done to you all,
Great honor and no deed whereby
reproach to him should fall.
I tell you he accomplysht has
the hole parts of afryend,
And that love which was most certain
he has done to the end:
He knew in Afrycke he might find
another Lady bright,
As fair and eke as rich as she
in whom he might delyght.
And one in whom perchance he might
have better consolacion,
Then to this whom he did not first
agree with contentacion:
But such a friend as I was he
having respect and mind,
Unto our syinylyinde and ^ke
our long approved kyade.
Also of my condycion and
estate he was sure,
Never for to find the like
while his life did endure:
Also the damsel suffers no
dispa^gement in her blood,
Nor hinderaunce in her m^rryage but
has one as rich in good.
And rather is advanced more
to dignity by me,
But to my friend Archelaus would
I, no disprayse should be:
Consider noble Lords also
that I did not her take,
My father living when therein
ye might suppression make,
That as well her great riches as
her beautye did alure,
Me for to take her for my wife
and so my heart procure:
But now my father is disseased
in her I take delyght,
And join my self with faithful love
to be hers day and night.
When I do far exceed her in
possessions and also,
My substance far surmounteth hers
as you right well do kno:
When the most noble men of Room
and eke of Italye,
Desired in my fellowship
to keep me company.
Ye have great cause therefore to thank
Archelaus of this thing,
And as you ought of right you should
in him have reioysyng:
And not to cast such angrye looks
extollyng so thereby.
This kyndnes showed unto me.
by him wrought wonderouslye.
Whereby of we and all my blood
such freindship has he won
That never better friends might be
since first the world begone
And to your City through me
such hap now may you have,
That from your foes through all ye world,
right well we shall you save.
The which thing well considered you
might for Archelaus sake,
In lykenes of him with fine gould
a comlye picture make:
And in the cheifest place of all
your City let it stand,
Upon a Pyller that all men
which dwells in the land.
May have in mind our freindship great
that is incomparable.
And how unto this City there
may benefyts come innumerable:
But if that this persuasion may
nor can not satisfy,
Your (...) but that ye will
imagen now thereby.
Any thing to the damage of
Archelans my friend so dear,
When that I am departed hence
^^auy^g him with you here:
To God the creator of all things,
my vow here I do make,
That as I shall have knowledge thereof
in all have for his sake.
Hither I shall resort and bring
thinuinsible power of Room,
Reuengyng him against his foes
with such a cruel doom:
That all Afrycke thereof shall report
and speak perpetual shame,
Unto their own reproach and eke
dishonor of their name.
And therwithall Alfagus and
Archelans stood vpryght,
But all the other that was theare
of Alfagus stood in flight,
Dyssemblyng all their mallyce and
made seemabelly their cheer,
As they contented in all things
to Alfagus might appear,
Alfagus is sent for to Room. Archelaus is banished his country by his
kyndred. After Alfagus, departing he is feign to beg his bread, and so
poorelye comes to Rome, to seek Alfagus, he thinks thinks him self
despised and enters in to a Barn, lame^ting his fortune.

Cap. vii.
Soon after this by atorytie of
the Senate and people of Rome,
Alfagus sent for was that he
without delay might come:
Home to their City and (...)
his fathers dignity,
Which seeing needs he must obaye
did grant them willynglye.
Appoyntyng them a day when he
without fail would be the are
How be it for Archelaus his
dear freinde he took much care:
And said my loving friend most vere
right joyful should I be,
If that you would forsake this place
and go to Room with me.
The one half of my lands and of
my goods I will you give,
Both unto you and to your heirs
so long as they shall live,
In feloship still we will remain
till desteny does denay,
Lachesus for to spinne her threede
out fatal life to stay.
But then Archelans vad in mind
cousyderyng therwithall,
How necessary his counsel might be
what thing so might fefall:
Unto the City of Carthagye
by many sundry ways,
Remembering that his famylie
thear lived many days.
And how his bounden duty was
the City to maintain,
And for the commonwealth to seek
some prophet or some gain:
Wherefore his friend Alfagus he
desired to be still,
For I (quoth he) may not depart
how be it with ardent will.
I do desyrs your company more
then any earthlye wight,
Great grief it will be unto me
when I forgo your sight:
Alfagus then perceauing that
no reason it should be,
His friend Archelaus should depart
out of his own country.
Considering how his counsel might
the City well uphold,
As other sage and wisemen did
in ancient time of old:
And that by nature bound he was
his countries wealth to seek,
No more he would persuade him then
but said with words meek.
Fare well my most dear friend for now
from you I most depart,
Farewell my loving mate in whom
I always set my heart:
Although in person I be gone
yet have me still in mind,
If ever of me you stand in need
a sure friend shall you fyade.
Archelaus kyssed Alfagus then
whom he loved as his life,
He kyssed eke the Lady fair
which should have been his wife:
So each one now departed i^
and Alfagus took his way,
Toward Room and with him rode
his Lady fresh and gay.
Where at their coming with great joy
Alfagus mother then,
Received was and unto her
most welcome of all men:
Where as he dwelled a^^ ia mirth
and great felicity,
Recrauyng many children by
Andromicus his Lady.
And for his wisdom and learning he
so highlye was esteemed,
That no high office was but that
with honor he atchiued:
And in the noble City of Room
much dignity did veare,
Receiving love and praise of all
the people that were there.
But now let us return again
wheat as we were before,
And of the spytefull kyndred of
Archelaus speak we mors:
And of the Ladies freyndes also
whose malice did remain,
With secret hatred in their heart
Archelaus to dysdayne.
So that soon after Alfagus had
to Room wards took his way,
Malysyously with shameful words
they vexte him day by day:
And vterly abhorred him
for that he did despise,
To take so fytte a make (they said
so rich and eke so wise.
In whom he might have took delyght
but that he did dys^ayne,
The frenship which so him they showed
exceptyng not their pain:
But leauyng her to A^^aus whole
for him they did provide,
Reprouyng him innamerably
with unkind words beside.
And all that ever they could deuyse
by him to do or say,
Malysyously they sought it out
and that without delay:
First they did exclude him from
their counsel and also,
Not thynkyng that to be enough
so light to let him go.
But did prohybyt from him then
all honest company,
And yet not having therwythall
their mind to satesfye:
Finally adjudged him
not worthy for to have,
Any of the possessions which
his father to him gave.
Neither yet any of the goods,
which his parents did leave,
Behind them at their death to him
as their gift did begueath:
Whom he as they supposed did
unnaturally to feign,
A freindship indiscreet and so
his parentage dysdayne.
Wherefore they did dispoyle him clean
of all that ever he had,
And took the raiment from his back
wherewith he then was clad:
And almost naked like a man
whom fortune did dispyse,
Out of the City expuiced him
in the most cruellest wise.
Thus is Archelaus lately one
most welthyest in the City,
Dispoyled of all that ever he had
no man on him takes pytie:
One of the noble^^ in Carthage
in dignity he did raygne,
And now of every woman and man
is had in great disdain.
For his kind heart thus with dyspite
he banyshed is for aye.
And his own country where he might
have lived also with joy:
And as man dis^^yed and tossed,
byfortune to and fro,
He wa^preth up and down and has
^o friend his gryefe to sho.
And no man could he find that would
him ayed in his distress,
But wandered up and down alone
in extreme wretchedness:
Alas (qouth he) what shall I do
in myserye thus remain,
O fortune why thus truellye
have thou me in disdain.
Alfagus my friend is now in joy
he has the maiden fair,
And for his sake I do remain,
oppressed with sorrow and care:
If unto him this thing were toulde
right suit I am that he,
Would have great sorrow and care for this
my pain and myserie.
He would revenge me of my foes
if ouce he might heaz^ te^^,
How for his sake disday^ f^ll^e*
they did me thus expel:
I will no more therefore deley^,
my hapiys hap to sho,
But speedelye all that ever I go.
to Room wathes will I go.
And unto Alfagus my dear friend
declare my hol^e state,
And how my foes with me had de^
most cruelly now of late:
Archelans therefore took his way
so fas^ as he might bye,
Toward Room and all alone,
withouten company.
He trauayleth day by day and is
disdayned of every might,
Sustaynyng hunger in the day
and lies cold all the night:
To beg for meat and brynke then he
was forced to procead,
For why^ he might no more delay
his hungrye Guts to feed.
And often when he came in place
where other Pa^iners were,
He was not known and therefore they
on him did take no care:
He could not do as others did
with many words to crave,
And therefore often went without
when other alms should have.
Whereby he did often times sustain
great honger pain and grief,
And no help could he have at all
but tears for his relief:
Thus many a mi^y day he went
or that he could attain,
To come to Room, but at the length
throog^ traueling long with pain.
Unto the City is he come
in hope to have relyefe,
And said if Alfagus I may find
now gone is all my gryefe:
For Alfagus house of every man
full fast inquireth he,
And at the length is come whereas
right well he may it see.
But then beholding it so fair
so large and eke so amyable,
So Pryncely builded and also
in all things so delectable:
He was a shamed to approach
or nigh the gates to stand,
He thought it would avail him naught
if that he took in hand.
To seek Alfagus since that he
was clad in such array,
In which full poorelye he had gone
and traueyled night and day:
Wherefore to tarry thear besides
he held it for the best,
And so he set him down a while
his weerye lymmes to rest.
And said if fortune so provide
that Alfagus come this way,
I will present my self to him
to hear what he will say:
I know right well be knows me
my face when he does ser,
Therefore if fortune would do so
right joyful should I be.
Archelaus being in this thought
and as he did deuyse,
Alfagus and his Lady he
within his gate espyse:
Who issuing out immedyatly
for their dysporte and play,
Amounted in most pleasant wise
upon their Palfrayes gaye.
And riding thus for their solace
Archelaus did behold,
But seeing him clad with such arare
all ragged in every fold:
So vile and fylthy to their sight
his raiment did appear,
That no regard they had to him,
ne did behoulde his cheer.
And so did pass forth on their way
not knowing whom it was,
The which within Archelaus heart*
such cares did bring to pass:
That sure Al^agns he did think
his fortune had contemned:
That being oppressed with mortal cares
and heaviness long defended.
Down in a sound be fell, for why
no longer might be stand,
But one amongst them which stood by
did take him by the hand:
And with the help of others theare
reuyued him again,
Thinkyng that he had bin sick
not knowing his careful pain.
And when he to him self was come
he made no long delay,
But forthwith did depart and from
the City took his way:
Intendyng to abide no more,
with Alfagus for to taulke,
But as awild beast wander about
through all the world to walk.
But for to rest his wearye lymmes
then force did him constrayne,
Within an old barn for to go
that theare he might complaynt:
His cruel fortune all alone
the which place when he found,
Without respect of death or life
he cast him on the ground,
And weeping with most dolorous cries
his fortune did bewail.
O thou Alfagus then quoth he
why do thou me dysdayne?
O feigned freindship why so long
have thou dwelt with us twain:
Mine own kind heart has caused this
alas why did I so,
Why let I not that unkind wretch
have dyed full long a go.
Alfagus I had thought thou would
not have been so unkind,
To me, which of so many years
has been thy loving freinde:
Alas my kynsfolkes now I find
your words to be full true,
I would to god that I had been*
aruled then by you.
Where is Alfagus thy kind heart
which thou wast wont to show,
Where is thy sweet acquayntau^ce which
between us I did know:
O cruel fortune why have thou
me thus far in disdain,
You spsters three by fatal doom
why do you now refrain?
To stop my breath and send my soul
where Lymbowes kingdoms lie
On Limbo lake in Charons boat
to take my destynie:
I will no longer live quoth he
in this great wretchedness,
But ryd this ^elly Ghost of mine
from pain and eke dystresse.
And therwithall his knyfe he drew
in point him self to kill,
But god so wrought against his mind
and former wicked will:
And by the knowledge which he had
long in Phylosophye,
Consyderyng wisely every thing
withstood that destenie.
Yet often times would he take the knyfe
his fatal wound to make,
But wisdom did persuade him still
his folly to forsake:
And on this wise within him self
alone contendynge still,
With cruel cares and torments thus
between wisdom and will.
Fatigated with long watch
and iourneyes great with all,
As god would have it in this wise
on deadly sleep did fall:
His knyfe wherwyth he did intend
him self as then to slaye,
Fell down him by as he on sleep
his weary bones did lay.
common robber having flayne a man, enters into the Barn wheare Archelaus
sleeps. He takes up the knife and puts it in the dead man's wound, and
lays it again by Archelaus who being so found is accused to dye. At last
he is known of Alfagus who takes the fact upon him to save his friends life,
and offers to dye.

Cap. viii.
THe whilste be on this wyes did lie
as fortune did provide,
A common thief or robber was
a waytyng there beside:
To do sum vyllanous act or deed
on traueylers by the way,
Naught else his practyce was but so
did live both night and day.
And by adventure at that time
a marchaunte traueylyng by,
The fore said thief behind a bushe
did well his time espy:
And suddenly the man he took
who thought no harm ne ill,
And not contented with his goods
forthwith he did him kill.
Wherefore that he might well eskape
and not to be espied,
In the barn where A^chelaus lay
full fast him self he hyed:
Who when he entered was and on
Archelaus did behold,
And that full fast on sleep he lay
as I before have told.
He looked on his face and saw
with cares he was oppressed,
And that the sorrowful tears he shed
all sprynkeled had his breast:
Right well he knew a desperate man
he was, and there did lie,
With sorrowful syghes so brought on sleep,
to ease his myserye.
This man quoth he will serve right well
to hyde my fact with all,
And then took up the knyfe which from
Archelaus hand did fa^l^
Puttyng it in the wound of him
which he before did slaye,
And in Archelaus hand it selte
as there on sleep he lay.
So then the thief with heart full glad
departed with all speed,
And tidings to the City came
of this his cruel deed:
Wherefore they serched dyllyg^ntly
in every hollow tree.
And every place which they suspecte
the thief might hidden be.
At last into the barn they came
where as Archelaus was,
Still fast on sleep be lay and thought
no barme at all alas:
Poor innocent man unto his lot
this man's death now must fall,
The searchers therefore busylie
to wake him they do call.
Who from his sleep when he awooke
to sygh he did not spare,
And entryng in most sorowfully
to his accustomed care:
Complaynyng of his fortune then
as he had done before,
With dolfull tears dystyllyng from
his eyes still more and more.
O curssed be the time quoth he
that ever I did know*
That unkind wretch for wives sake now
I suffer all this woo:
But when the officers earnestlye
unto his charge did lay,
The man's death which they found thereby
and that he did him slaye.
The knyfe a token is they said
that lies down by thee here
For all be blooddyed with the wound
to us it does appear:
Thou must needs suffer death therefore
dyspatche and come at once,
With ropes they bound him hand and foot
which were brought for the nonce.
He nothing did denay at all
but what to him they laid,
Confessed that it was even so
and held him well apayede:
That by so good luck should escape
his vyolent mind and will
When with his own hands he did think
his innocent blood to spyll.
By law now shall I dye quoth he
right glad I am therefore,
Good freindes make haste, dyspatche my days
that I may see no more:
The light of Son ne yet of sky
which on the earth does show
Their glystryng light and gladsome heat
on trees on earth below.
The mournyng feyldes by lymbo lake
I would approach to see,
With those whom love their death did force
that place is best for me:
The officers marueiled greatly then
to see him so content,
To take his death with spedy haste
intreatyng as he went.
That they would not delay the time
wherefore was told anon,
Unto the Senate with report
the deed of such a one:
Who as you hard before was slain
and that in such a place,
Was found a man in Carthage borne
suspected in that case.
And how they found the blood dye knyfe
in his hand being still,
And that it seemed to be he
the which the man did kill:
Wherefore forth with they did command
to bring him to the bar,
Because that time in Judgment seat
the counsel setten were.
Alfagus was chief counceller then
or in like dygnitie,
Syttyng in his royal seat
with great felycitiy:
Archelaus then most miserable man
unto the bar was brought,
With byls and staves most like a thief
and innocent was of thought.
Of whom it was demanded then
if he the man did slaye,
That was found dead as ye have hard
which he did not denaye:
But in most sorrowful manner did
his fortune curse and ^an,
Saying he was in all the world
the most vnfortunatest man.
O miserable wretch (quoth he)
what curssed star did raygne,
When I my fatal thread of life
by nature did obtain:
I would to god Lachesys had
my fatal thread vntayed,
Before I knew that unkind wretch
which has me now vpbrayed.
Thus syghyng in his heart be said
but no man could espy,
For whom he sorrowed in such sort
in care and and mysery:
At length one did demand of him
in what place he was borne,
And how he traueyled had so far
with cotes so rent and torn.
In Carthagye good sir he said
my mother did me bare,
And in my youthful time and days
full well I lived their:
But fortune with her fatal wheel
my good luck did envy,
And therewith on Alfagus he
did cast a sorrowful eye.
With indignation much and braste
into great syghes with all,
Whereby abundantly the fears
down from his eyes did fall:
Which when Alfagus did behold
esspyeng eke also,
A mark upon his vysage which
of certain he did kno.
It was Archelaus his dear freinde
consyderyng therwythall,
That by some evil adventure he
into that case did fall:
Suddenly from his seat he rose
and kneeled on his knee,
Before the judges all and said
my Lords give ear to me.
This man my self I slew quoth he
of old rancour and hate,
The which renewed was by us
of malice now of late:
This man is gyltlesse of the thing
he is a stranger here,
For in the eyes of all men now
right well it may appeete.
That he is desperate in his mind
and cares not for to dye,
And to abreue his sorrows he
does not the fact deny:
He does confess the fact whereof
he is most innocent,
And so to fynysh his sorrowful days
that is his hole intent.
Wherefore the sentence gyne on me
according to my deed:
And have according to the law
some shameful death with speed
Archelaus then perceauyng that
contrary to his expectatyon,
His friend Alfagus did begin
to make there such relacion.
And how he offered for to dye
some shameful death, and so
Deliver him from the death to which
full like he was to go:
He more importunatlye did cry
for judgment to be done,
And that they would proceed on him
like as they had begone.
For I am be withouten fail
that did this man dystroye,
And as he walked by the way
withouten company:
I did suppose to have of him
some Juels rich and sayre,
And started sadeynly from a bushe
before that he was ware.
Geuyng him his deadly wound
whereby I might at ease,
S^rche him well in every place
to do even as I please:
But when I had destroyed him so,
it did me not avail,
For there no riches could I find
my purpose I did fail.
And being then right sore in fear
least any should espy,
This cruel deed that I had done
full fast I did me hye:
Into the barn where I was found
to rest me for a while,
But I had watched long before
and sleep did me begyle.
So that before I was a ware
full fast on sleep I lay,
And had the knyfe still in my hand
the which that man did slaye:
The officers will confess it so
I must needs dye therefore,
And thus he called for his death
on them still more and more.
Alfagus did deny those words
and said he did but feign,
He does invent these words quoth he
the man he has not slain:
For if that he had done the deed
he would have fled away,
And not have tarryed in the place
where as he did him slaye.
Sum other thing was in his mind
when he did draw his knyfe,
By desperate mind perhaps he thought
to have tyd his own life:
Is that a weapon like to fight
or kill a man with all,
No no my Lords it is not so
the knyfe is very small.
And he is like a Palmer poor
which beggeth by the way,
Not like a Ruffen you may see
his coats are nothing gay:
It was even I that slew the man
the cause I told before,
Of old hate which between us was
and kept so long in store.
For as in that place all alone
a hunting I did ride,
By evil adventure in the way
the man there I espied:
And thynkyng that no bertter time
I might avenged be,
But then when as we were alone
and no man else to see.
I drew my sword without delay
and unto him I said,
Thou vy^layne now to find the here
I am right well apayde:
And therwithall on him I laid
without respect or care,
That so denly his deadly wound
he had or I was ware.
Which when I saw out of the way
I drew him by and by,
I took my horse in all the haste
and homwardes fast did fly:
This thing is true which I have said
the law now let me have,
Why do ye defer of so long
no man my life may save.
Archelaus said it was not so
but he the man did slaye,
Alfagus did withstand it tho
and did him still denaye:
Thus argued they long time for death
who might the other save,
Aboundaytly their tears they shed
with wishyng for their grave.
Whereat the Senate and people all
was wonderouslye abasht,
Not knowing what the thing might mean
but stood full sore aghast.
The murderer being moved with pyttie declares the truth. Alfagus takes
Archelaus home to his house, much sorrowful for his adventure. The people
rejoice yt the truth is known, and the murderer is set at liberty.

Cap. ix.
NOw he which was ye thief in deed
and murdered had the man
Did here this thing and in the prease
among the folk did stand:
Who then perceyuyng in his heart
the marvelous great contencion,
Of these two persons which was naught
but of their own inuencion.
He knew they were full innocente
in that which they did say,
yet one to save the others life
would not the deed denaye:
And that it was proceeded of
a freindship most incomparable,
By ardent love on both sides set,
so fyrme and eke vnuaryable.
Most veymently provoked he was
the truth for to dysclose,
So through the prease he breaks fast
and to the bar he gose:
Before the Senate and people all
whereas without delay,
His voice he lyfted up on hye
and unto them did say.
Right noble fathers wise and sage
to you it is well known,
That I am now and has been e^e
full many years a gone:
A common Barator and a thief
and eke is known to you,
Alfagus is of noble blood
and of excelent virtue.
Approved always for a man
both noble wise and sage,
Descended as you know right well
of great and high lynage:
And never toward man nor wife
malycyous was his mind,
By any outward sign at all
that ever wit could find.
This other stranger eke also
does seem a man to be,
Of sober life having his heart
full of symplycytie:
And that is more desperate of mind
for some great grievous pain,
Which he has taken in him self
by fortunes frownyng brain.
And euydently unto your eyes
right well it may appear,
As also it does unto all
the people that he here:
Most reverent fathers in this thing
my heart does now relent,
For unto you I do confess
these are both innocente.
I am the parson which did slaye,
and murder eke the man,
Which was found dead, now of late
with color pale and wan:
I robbed him of all his goulde
and silver every deal,
As I was wont with others mo^
when as I went to steal.
And in the barn I entered then
which stood but there hard bye
This stranger flat upon the ground
full fast on sleep did lie:
Having by him a naked knyfe
wherewith the better to speed,
I put it in the dead man's wound
to hyde my wicked deed.
Which being all be rayed with blood
I made no stay ne let,
But to this stranger came again
and in his hand it set:
Which thing when I had done I made
no stay ne let at all,
I hyed me fast away and thought,
no harm could me befall.
To this man's charge I knew rightwell
all men the deed would lay,
And now I do perceive right well
he does it not denaye:
But pytie so has moved my heart
that needs I must confess,
This fact to save this innocent man
and seek mine own dystresse.
This was my whole deuyce in deed
your judgment to with stand,
But now I do commit my life
even here into your hand:
Rather then this noble man
Alfagus should be slain,
Or that this innocent strangers life
would end with grief and pain.
Whereat the Senate and people all
such great comfort did take,
That with the noise of joyful hearts
the whole court they did shake
Alfagus ran to Archelaus then
and in his arms him caught,
O my most faithful friend he said
why have thou e^e thus sought*
O why has fortune dealt with thee
so cruelly in dispyte?
Why wouldste thou send no word to me
to help thee in thy right:
How could you to this City come
and would not seek for me,
Why did you think I would despise
you in your myserye.
No, no, Archelaus in this world
god let me never live,
If for your safegarde all my goods
and life I would not give:
Declare to me your great myshap
and how it came to pass,
That you are brought to this distress
with careful pain alas.
And therwithall down from his eyes
the salt tears fell so fast,
That uneath could he speak a word
but if his heart should braste:
Archelaus shed much tears also
for joy his freinde to see,
Imbracyng, kyssyng and thankyng him
with great fydelytie.
And said my loving freinde when I
unto your house shall come,
I will declare my whole estate
to you both all and some:
Through all the City publyshed was
this freindshyp most incomperable,
Of Alfagus and Archelaus which
to them was most commendable.
And so extolled and magnyfied them
even all the realm throughout,
That by the mouths of every man
their fame was spread about:
Finally at the instance of
Alfagus and also,
The suit of all the people made
unto the Senate tho.
The thief was pardoned of his fact
and freely sent away,
With charge no more to do the like
to no man night nor day:
Alfagus Archelaus lead
unto his house anon,
And rich aparell on his back
he caused to do on.
Unto Andrmyca of all men
most welcome then was he,
She kyssed and embraced him
with much fair curtesye:
And said my loving friend most dear
what spytefull foes did raygne,
To bring you in such myserye
by force and great disdain.
But be you of good comfort sith
God has you hither sent,
And all the goods shall be as yours
which God to us has lent:
Yea quoth Alfagus with my heart
I wyshe it should be so,
If that ye will abide with me
and no more homewardes go.
But Archelaus my dear friend
feign would I here you tell,
The cause why from your country so
your foes did you expel.
Archelaus showethe Alfagus all his troubles and myserye, who sorowfully
lamented his case. And having provided a great Army, went with Archelaus to
Carthage, where he flew and ponished all his foes, and setting his friend in
quiet rest, returns again to Room.

Cap. x.
O My dear friend Archelaus said
I will to you declare,
How that dyspytefully my ^oes
oppressed me with care:
When that your Lady Andromyca
and you departed was
From Carthegy where many years
in pastyme we did pass.
Your Ladies kyn and mine also
conspyred such dysdayne,
That all the means and ways they sought
how that I might be slain:
But when they culd find naught that way
to do me such outrage,
They sought another kind of trade
their malice to aswage.
And first expulsed me from the seat
where counsel I did give,
But thinkyng that was not y^onghe
so well to let me live:
Prohybetid from me then
all honest company,
And yet not b^yng so content
their wrath to pacefye.
Adjudged me not worthy to
enjoy my fathers land,
Ne nothing else which as you know
did fall into my hand:
For why said they he does disdain
his fathers parentage,
And will not be aruled by
our counsel wise and sage.
But leaves of the Lady whom
for him with care we sought,
With shame he has begyled us
Alfagus has her cought:
My goods and lands all that I had
they took from me therefore,
No not a garment for my back
they would to me restore.
But almost naked like a man
whom fortune did despise,
They drove me from the City in
the most dyspytefull wise:
And no man could I find that once
would seek my help or aid,
For those in whom I trusted most
has chiefly me vpbrayde.
Then wandered I up and down we care
and mysery sore oppressed,
To beg my bread constraynde I was
no place I found of rest:
At length through trauelyng long with pain
I came this City to,
And joyful was my heart as then
in hope to speak with you.
But when I came your palyce nigh
beholdynge it so gaye,
I was ashamed to approach
and to my self did say:
I will abide without the gates
and tarrye for a space,
Perhaps I shall or it be long
behold by fortunes grace.
My freinde Alfagus come this way
so then he shall me see,
And as I was deuysyng thus
the best way that might be:
I did espy you come and eke
your Lady in your hand,
Which made my heart full glad, and I
upon my feet did stand.
That so you might behold me as
ye passed by the way,
But as you passed by and saw
me clad in such array:
No mind on me ye had at all
which made me to surmyse,
That for my poor estate I had
you did me now despise.
And in a sound for care I fell
oppressed with mortal woo,
But being then reuy^ed again
I thought foorthwyth to goo^
Most like a beast about the world
to wander up and down,
And drew my knyfe to slaye my self
where as now I was found.
But god withstood that cruel deed
so I on sleep did fall,
And held the knyfe still which I thought
to slaye my self with all.
O freynd Archelaus, Alfagus said
my heart may not endure,
To hear the woeful state you had
my death it will procure.
I am the chiefest cause of this
alas why did I so,
O spytefull eyes, where was your sight
when as you could not know
My dear freinde standing in the way
in hope to have relief,
Alas, alas, unto my heart
how terryble is the grief.
But when Archelaus saw his freinde
Alfagus to relent,
And inwardly with doulfull tears
his neclygence repent:
Most louyngly embraced him,
and said my freynde be still,
Leave of your sorrowful syghes ye make
your vysage for to spyll.
The things which now are past and gone
no man may call again,
Why hurt you now your self therefore
and weep with grievous pain:
I know right well no fault in you
in this thing was at all,
But my own neclygence causes most
of this unlucky fall.
For if my wit had been so good
when as you paste me bye,
To have declared what I was
and eke my myserie:
I had not felt the half of this
which now I did sustain,
But sith the thing is paste of it
to talk it is but vain.
My friend Archelaus Alfagus said
to god give praise always,
Who has you helped in your cares
unto this present day:
And look what thing there lies in me
demand and you shall have,
My life and goods I will not spare
you my freinde for to save.
If that you will abide in Room
and dwell here still with me,
My house, my goods, my lands and all
even as your own shall be:
In felowwyp we will remain
as long we wonted were,
To ride and go both day and night
for you I will not spare.
My leuyng friend Archelaus said
I thank you hartelye,
For this your kyndnes to me showed
of my part unworthy:
But I intend to go again
my country to behold,
If of your help and aid therein
to crave I might be bold.
All that is mine Alfagus said
as I have told before,
Ye may command now at this time
and shall do ever more:
And since it is your mind to go
into your own country,
You shall have all the aid and help
that can be made by me.
In haste I will provide therefore
an Army fearce and stout,
Whom I to Carthage will conducte
to hunte those rebels out:
Not one of them there shall escape
vnponyshed for the thing,
So that all Carthage round about
of their desarte shall ring.
The Senate by aucthorytie then
their Romayne Host did call,
And twenty thousand men in raye
they set both strong and tall,
Which were on horseback poynted well
for to resyste their foo,
And eke as many foot men stood
in redynes to goo.
Alfagus took his leave then of
Andromyca his Lady,
And Archelaus he did conducte
straight unto Carthagye:
Where as by force of power he slew
and ponyshed those that he,
Might here or learn by any mean
Archelaus foes to be.
And those also which did dysdayne*
to help him in his need,
Alfagus ponyshed sundry wise
according to their meede:
And set his friend Archelaus chief
in dygnytye to raygne,
Above those which in Carthagye
the City did maintain.
Restorynge to him all the land
and goods he had before,
Agmented by the death of them
which hated him before:
Now when Alfagus had done this
and set in quiet peace,
His dear freinde Archelaus whom
with goods he did increase.
He made the Senators all to swear
obedyence for to give,
To his freynde Archelaus whylste
he theare on earth did live:
And no man for to be so boulde
his counsel to despise,
But take him as he is, a man
both noble sage and wise.
This done and all thing set at rest
the best way that might be,
He said freynd Archelaus now
come take your leave of me:
For I must needs to Room again
mine army to conuaye,
And you I shall not see no more
again this many a day.
O friend Alfagus Archelaus said
great kyndnes you have showed,
On me, and I may think my love
on you right well bestowed:
I give you hearty thanks therefore
no better mendes I make,
But look what lies in me to do
I am redye for your sake.
Sease of those words Alfagus said
my loving freinde most dear,
And better then your self let me
not to your eyes appear:
For thanking me in this my pain
now taken for your sake,
Is nothing but as unto you
a symylytude I shall make.
Which is even as though my left hand
my right hand thanks should give,
For sekyng help when it was hurt
the wound for to relyue.
We are as one you know right well
and ever more will be,
And look what any man does for you
he does it eke for me.
For if one member the body to aid
does seek with all indeuer,
To find some redye for to heal
and cure his pain for ever:
Does he ought but his duty then
even so my freynde have I,
And still do while my life does last
though for you I should dye.
In deed quoth Archelaus then
of right it should be so,
And sith it is your mind so soon
to Room wards ye will go:
The gods conduct you on your way
accordyngeto your mind,
And send you quiet passage that
no danger you may find.
Commend me to your Lady fair
and thus I take my leave,
With that he cast his arms abroad
his freinde for to receive:
He kyssed him sweetlye then and said
farewell my hearts delyght,
Farewell my loving friend on whom
I think both day and night.
Alfagus kyssed him also
with the like salutacyon,
And said the host is ready, I have
no longer delyberacion:
But must needs now depart from you
the Gods ye help and guide
And there with all amongst the route
upon his horse did ride.
Who in short space to Rome was brought
with great magnyfycye,
And was received ioyously of
And dromyca his Lady.
