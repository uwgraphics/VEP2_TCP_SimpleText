Against filthy writing / and such like delighting.
WHat mean the rimes that run thus large in every shop to sell?
With wanton sound, and filthy sense, me think it grees not well
We are not Ethnickes we forsooth, at least profess not so
Why range we then to Ethnickes trade? come bak, where will ye go?
Tell me is Christ, or Cupide Lord? does God or Uenus reign?
And whose are we? whom ought we serve? I ask it, answer plain
If wanton Uenus, then go forth, if Cupide, keep your trade
If God, or Christ, come bak the best, or sure you will be made
Does God? is he the Lord in deed? and should we him obey?
Then his commandment ought to guide, all that we do or say
But show me his commandment then, thou filthy writer thou
Let seet, I cease, if not, give place, or shameless show thee now.
WE are no foes to music we, a mis your man does take us
so friends to things corrupt and vile, you all shall never make us
If you deny them such to be, I stand to prove it I*
If you confess (defend them not) why then do you reply?
But such they be I will maintain, which yet you both defend
And judge them fools, that them mislike, would God you might amend
But, substance only I regard, let Accidencis go
Both you and we, be that we be, I therefore leave it so
And yet I wish your terms in deed, upon some reason stayed
If mine be not, reprove them right, I Will blot that I have said
And that I wrote, or now do wrighte, against you as may seem
What cause I had, and have, I yield, to modest men to deem
I wish you well I do protest, (as God will, I will so)
I cannot help, as friend ye wot, nor will not hurt as so
But for the vile corrupting rimes, which you confess to wrighte
My soul and heart abhorres their sense, as far from my delight
And those that use them for their glee, as you do vaunte ye will
I tell you plainly what I think, I judge them to be ill
This boasting late in part has causd, me now to say my mind
Though chalenges of yours also, in every place I find.
Thomas Brice.
